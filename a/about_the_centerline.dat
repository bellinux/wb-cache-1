40|$|The {{wake of a}} {{streamwise}} oscillating cylinder is presently investigated. The Reynolds number investigated is 300, based on the cylinder diameter d. The cylinder oscillates at an amplitude of 0. 5 d and a frequency fe/fs= 1. 8, where fe is the cylinder oscillating frequency and fs is the natural vortex shedding frequency of a stationary cylinder. Under these conditions the flow is essentially two dimensional. A two-dimensional direct numerical simulation (DNS) scheme has been developed to calculate the flow. The DNS results display a street of binary vortices, each containing two counter-rotating vortical structures, symmetrical <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>centerline,</b> which is in excellent agreement with measurements. The drag and lift on the cylinder have been examined. The time averaged drag and lift are 1. 4 and 0, respectively, which {{are the same as}} those on a stationary cylinder at the same Re. However, the fluctuating drag was high, about 2. 68. It has been found that, being symmetrically formed <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>centerline,</b> the binary vortices induce an essentially zero fluctuating lift, which may have a profound implication in flow control and engineering.

The optical fiber includes a fiber grating that has a plurality of grating elements formed therein. At {{least one of the}} grating elements has a spatially varying index of refraction that varies azimuthally <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>centerline</b> of the optical fiber. The fiber grating acts as a band-stop optical spectral filter. In addition, since fiber-cladding modes are weakly-guided modes, their power can be easily dissipated by scattering, bending, stretching, and/or rotating the optical fiber.

40|$|Abstract-The {{effect of}} average strain-rate on the {{interaction}} among shear bands in nonpolar and dipolar thermoviscoplastic materials has been investigated. The uniform temperature and stress fields in a block undergoing simple shearing deformations are perturbed {{when the body}} just starts deforming plastically and the governing nonlinear coupled partial differential equations are solved numerically. The temperature perturbations introduced are symmetric <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>centerline</b> of the block, and have two bumps of unequai heights {{on each side of}} the centerline. For nonpolar materials one band on either side of the centerline eventually emerges, the location of the center of the band and its width depend upon the overall strain-rate. For dipolar materials only one band situated at the center of the block forms irrespective of the applied strain-rate. The initiation of the band is significantly delayed in dipolar materials, especially at the higher overall strain-rate studied...|$|E

40|$|Longitudinal stripes are {{a common}} bed form in {{heterogeneous}} alluvial sediments and consist of periodic, spanwise variations in bed texture and elevation that are aligned parallel to the mean flow direction. This paper quantifies mean and turbulent flow structures over self-formed sediment stripes in a weakly bimodal sand and gravel mixture. Turbulence anisotropy generates two secondary circulation cells across the channel half-width, which produce a cross-stream perturbation in boundary shear stress. The interaction between this flow structure and the selective transport of bed material generates spanwise sediment sorting that is symmetrical <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>centerline.</b> Finer sediments are entrained from regions of high shear stress, transported laterally by the secondary flow, and deposited in regions of lower shear stress. Lateral changes in bed texture further enhance the near-bed secondary flow, which provides a positive feedback mechanism for stripe growth. In bimodal sediments, at shear stresses just above the entrainment threshold, stripes may replace lower-stage plane beds. At higher shear stresses the coarser sediment becomes more mobile and the stripes are replaced by flow transverse bed forms. Read More: [URL]...|$|E

40|$|The {{turbulent}} near-wake {{of three}} side-by-side circular cylinders with equal or unequal spacing has been experimentally investigated using various techniques, including the hot wire, laser Doppler anemometer, and flow visualization. The work aims {{to understand the}} effect of unequal cylinder spacing on the vortex streets behind the three cylinders. When the cylinder center-to-center spacing is identical, i. e., T₁/d = T₂/d = 1. 5, the flow is symmetric <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>centerline,</b> with one wide wake behind the central cylinder and one narrow wake {{on each side of}} the wide wake. The dominant frequency in the narrow wakes is about 5. 4 times that in the wide wake. The observation is consistent with previous reports, thus lending credence to the present measurement. As T₂/d is slightly increased to 1. 6, a remarkable change occurs in the flow. A comparison is made between the cases of equally and unequally spaced cylinders in terms of the pressure around the cylinders, drag, lift, dominant frequencies, and vortex formation mechanisms.

3000|$|Figure  3 a–c {{show that}} the current is so weak that its effect on wave can be {{neglected}} when Re is less than 1.5  ×  105. The flow is essentially symmetric <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>centerline</b> in the y direction during all time history under constant KC number and relatively weak current effect. Flow separations from corners exist but the vortices {{are attached to the}} structure. Under wave-only effect of wave height H =  0.05  m as well as wave period T =  4  s, the value of KC = u p T/L ≈  0.6, where u p [...] is the maximum wave-induced fluid particle velocity, u p  ≈  0.15  m/s [10]. Thus, when the Reynolds number magnitude is smaller than Re_critical = u_p L/v = 1.5 × 10 ^ 5, [...] the effect of Reynolds number on wave is almost very little. The drag force and vortex form caused by wave–current interaction with KC =  0.6 as well as weak current are consistent with that of wave action only. Conversely, when the Reynolds number magnitude is the same as Recritical, the wave–current nonlinear interaction is obvious. Although with the same KC number, the trailing vortex forms differ from one another. With increasing the Reynolds number from 1.5  ×  105 to 6.0  ×  105, the vortex form becomes more complicated; however, the separation point remains at the upstream corners at all times for different Reynolds numbers. From Fig.  3 i–j, it is expected that the vortex feature under wave–current effect becomes much more complicated in comparison to that of the current-only effect due to the presence of wave oscillating motion.|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} of the turbulent fluctuating kinetic energy dissipation in low Reynolds number channel flow is made, both analytically and numerically with means of Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS). The unsteady Navier-Stokes equations are solved at a Reynolds number of 360, based on the shear velocity and channel height, for four grid resolutions 48 ^ 3, 88 ^ 3, 128 ^ 3 and 192 ^ 3. The results are compared with data from Kim et al. (1987) [9], and good agreement is found for the 192 ^ 3 grid resolution. The viscous term in the kinetic energy equation is derived and described, from there the &# 147;isotropic&# 148; dissipation equation is shown to be the homogeneous dissipation equation which is compared with the thermodynamically correct dissipation. The results are {{in agreement with the}} findings of Bradshaw and Perot (1993) [2], with a difference of maximum &# 8776; 2. 5 % from the correct dissipation. The isotropic dissipation, often used as approximation in experiments, is also calculated and compared with the homogeneous dissipation. The results are un- surprisingly poor, and are only in agreement <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>centerline.</b> A comparison with an equation from the k-&# 949;-model is also made, most as a curiosity, and also shows poor agreement. The Kolmogorov length scale is calculated from the dissipation, and it shows clear grid dependency even though the grid is smaller than the Kolmogorov length scale in the z-direction with max(&# 8710;z+/&# 951;+) = 0. 8. The dissipation of the Reynolds stress components are used to create Kolmogorov length scales in x, y and z-direction. They are also grid dependent, even though max(&# 8710;z+/&# 951;+) &# 8776; 0. 7. A length scale tensor analogous to the Kolmogorov length scale is proposed. It is based on the connection between the Reynolds stress equation and the turbulent fluctuating kinetic energy equation. It relaxes the grid restrictions compared to the Kolmogorov length scale, but {{investigation of}} its validity requires simulations with a super computer and is therefore not performed. </p...|$|E
40|$|The wake of {{asymmetric}} bluff bodies was experimentally {{measured using}} particle imaging velocimetry, laser Doppler anemometry, load cell, hotwire, and flow visualization techniques at Re= 2600 – 8500 Re= 2600 – 8500 {{based on the}} freestream velocity and the characteristic height of the bluff bodies. Asymmetry is produced by rounding some corners of a square cylinder and leaving others unrounded. It is found that, with increasing corner radius, the flow reversal region is expanded, and the vortex formation length is prolonged. Accordingly, the vortex shedding frequency increases and the base pressure rises, resulting in {{a reduction in the}} mean drag as well as the fluctuating drag and lift. It is further found that, while the asymmetric cross section of the cylinder causes <b>the</b> wake <b>centerline</b> to shift toward the sharp corner side of the bluff body, the wake remains globally symmetric <b>about</b> <b>the</b> shifted <b>centerline.</b> <b>The</b> near wake of asymmetric bluff bodies is characterized in detail, including the Reynolds stresses, characteristic velocity, and length scale, and is further compared with that of the symmetric ones.

40|$|The {{surface of}} a {{nanostructure}} relaxing on a substrate consists of {{a finite number of}} interacting steps and often involves the expansion of facets. Prior theoretical studies of facet evolution have focused on models with an infinite number of steps, which neglect edge effects caused by the presence of the substrate. By considering diffusion of adsorbed atoms (adatoms) on terraces and attachment-detachment of atoms at steps, we show that these edge or finite height effects {{play an important role in}} the structure's macroscopic evolution. We assume diffusion-limited kinetics for adatoms and a homoepitaxial substrate. Specifically, using data from step simulations and a continuum theory, we demonstrate a switch in the time behavior of geometric quantities associated with facets: the facet edge position in a straight-step system and the facet radius of an axisymmetric structure. Our analysis and numerical simulations focus on two corresponding model systems where steps repel each other through entropic and elastic dipolar interactions. The first model is a vicinal surface consisting of a finite number of straight steps; for an initially uniform step train, the slope of the surface evolves symmetrically <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>centerline,</b> i. e., the middle step when the number of steps is odd. The second model is an axisymmetric structure consisting of a finite number of circular steps; in this case, we include curvature effects which cause steps to collapse under the effect of line tension. In the first case, we show that the position of the facet edge, measured from the centerline, switches from O(t^ 1 / 4) behavior to O(t^ 1 / 5) (where t is time). In the second case, the facet radius switches from O(t^ 1 / 4) to O(t). For the axisymmetric case, we also predict analytically through a continuum shock wave theory how the individual collapse times are modified by the effects of finite height under the assumption that step interactions are weak compared to the step line tension...|$|E

To carry out this objective, a series of 2 / 3 to near full-scale models for low-rise to mid-rise construction were designed according to published guidelines for RCS moment connections with the addition of a reinforced concrete slab. Specimens were tested in two orthogonal directions under quasi-static, reversed-cyclic loading. Joint strength predictions in the continuous beam direction of loading were made according to the ASCE guidelines (ASCE 1994), proposed strength models from Cornell the Architectural Institute of Japan (AIJ 1994). From nted in comparison of measured response to predicted response, recommendations were made for improving the ASCE strength models (1994) to account for the addition of a RC slab, cover plates, and band plates. Results indicated that the addition of a reinforced concrete slab compositely connected to the steel beams framing into a typical RCS joints as defined by the ASCE guidelines (1994), improved the joint panel shear strength by increasing the width of the inner concrete compression strut and/or the outer concrete compression field, depending on the joint configuration. In addition to the direct contribution to joint panel shear strength, cover plate details also seemed to increase the inner and outer concrete panel widths for joint panel shear strength. Band plates also appeared elective in increasing the elective joint width and/or maximum compressive stress in the concrete bearing zone conjoint vertical bearing strength. For the discontinuous direction of loading, proposed joint strength models were further modified. For vertical bearing strength, the moment arm for the bearing elements was reducers as the beams rotate independently <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>centerline</b> of the connecting bolts, instead of as a rigid body about the center of the joint.

40|$|Two of {{the areas}} that have become {{relevant}} recently are the areas of mixing in micro-scale devices, and manufacturing of functional nanoparticles. MicroPIV experiments were performed on two different mixers, one a wide microchannel with the surface grooves, in the laminar regime, and the other, a confined impinging jets reactor, in the laminar and turbulent regimes. In the wide microchannel with surface grooves, microPIV data were collected at the interface and the midplane at the Reynolds numbers of 0. 08, 0. 8, and 8. The experiments were performed on three internal angles of the chevrons, namely 135 °, 90 °, and 45 °. The normalized transverse velocity generated in the midplane due {{to the presence of}} the grooves, is the strongest for the internal angle of 135 °, and in that, the normalized transverse velocity is maximum at the Reynolds numbers of 0. 08 and 0. 8. MicroPIV experiments were performed in a confined impinging jets reactors at Reynolds numbers of 200, 1000, and 1500. The data was collected in the midplane, and turbulent statistics were further computed. The high velocity jets impinge along the centerline of the reactor. Upon impinging, part of the fluid turns towards the top wall and the majority of it turn towards the outlet. This high velocity impingement causes and unstable zone called the impingement zone, which moves <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>centerline</b> line, causing the jets to flap back and forth. Spatial correlations were computed to get an estimate {{of the size of the}} coherent structures. Large eddy simulation was performed on the CIJR for the Reynolds numbers of 1000 and 1500, using OpenFOAM. The Reynolds number is based on the inlet jet hydraulic diameter. Excellent agreement was found with the experimental and simulation data. Turbulent reactive mixing in a rectangular microscale confined impinging-jets reactor (CIJR) was investigated using the pH indicator phenolphthalein in this study for three di_erent jet Reynolds numbers of 25, 1000 and 1500. Laminar flow regime was observed at Reynolds number of 25 whereas the flow was turbulent at Reynolds numbers of 1000 and 1500. An image processing technique was applied to instantaneous images to extract quantitative mixing data by identifying regions with pH ≥ 9. 3 and regions with pH 3 ̆c 9. 3. The ensemble-averages were computed using these thresholded images to compare mixing performance between different Reynolds numbers.

40|$|The {{international}} Low Impact Docking System (iLIDS) {{provides a}} structural arrangement {{that allows for}} visiting vehicles to dock with the International Space Station (ISS) (Fig 1). The iLIDS docking units are mechanically joined together {{by a series of}} active and passive latch hooks. In order to preserve docking capability at the existing Russian docking interfaces, the iLIDS latch hooks are required to conform to the existing Russian design. The latch hooks are classified as being fail-safe. Since the latch hooks are fail-safe, the hooks are not fracture critical and a fatigue based service life assessment will satisfy the structural integrity requirements. Constant amplitude fatigue testing to failure on four sets of active/passive iLIDS latch hooks was performed at load magnitudes of 10, 11, and 12 kips. Failure analysis of the hook fatigue failures identified multi-site fatigue initiation that was effectively centered about the hook mid-plane (consistent with the 3 D model results). The fatigue crack initiation distribution implies that the fatigue damage accumulation effectively results in a very low aspect ratio surface crack (which can be simulated as thru-thickness crack). Fatigue damage progression resulted in numerous close proximity fatigue crack initiation sites. It was not possible to determine if fatigue crack coalescence occurs during cyclic loading or as result of the fast fracture response. The presence of multiple fatigue crack initiation sites on different planes will result in the formation of ratchet marks as the cracks coalesce. Once the stable fatigue crack becomes unstable and the fast fracture advances across the remaining ligament and the plane stress condition at a free-surface will result in failure along a 45 deg. shear plane (slant fracture) and the resulting inclined edge is called a shear lip. The hook thickness on the plane of fatigue crack initiation is 0. 787 ". The distance between the shear lips on this plane was on the order of 0. 48 " and it was effectively centered about the mid-plane of the section. The numerous ratchet marks between the shear lips on the fracture initiation plane are indicative of multiple fatigue initiation sites within this region. The distribution of the fatigue damage <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>centerline</b> of the hook is consistent with the analytical results that demonstrate peak stress/strain response at the mid-plane that decreases {{in the direction of the}} hook outer surfaces. Scanning electron microscope images of the failed sections detected fatigue crack striations in close proximity to the free surface of the hook radius. These findings were documented at three locations on the fracture surface : 1) adjacent to the left shear lip, 2) adjacent to the right shear lip, and 3) near the centerline of the section. The features of the titanium fracture surface did not allow for a determination of a critical crack size via identification of the region where the fatigue crack propagation became unstable. The fracture based service life projections where benchmarked with strain-life analyses. The strainrange response in the hook radius was defined via the correlated finite element models and the modified method of universal slopes was incorporated to define the strain-life equation for the titanium alloy. The strain-life assessment confirmed that the fracture based projections were reasonable for the loading range of interest. Based upon the analysis and component level fatigue test data a preliminary service life capability for the iLIDS active and passive hooks of 2 lifetimes is projected (includes a scatter factor of 4) ...|$|E
40|$|Shock-shock {{interactions}} {{are among the}} most basic gas-dynamic problem, and are almost unavoidable in any high speed light, where shock waves generating from different sources crosses each other paths. These interactions when present very close to the solid surface lead to very high pressure and thermal loads on the surface. The related practical problem is that experienced at the cowl lip of a scramjet engine, where the interfering shock waves leads to high heat transfer rates which may also lead to the damage of the material. The classification by Edney (1968) on the shock-shock interaction patterns based on the visualization has since then served the basis for such studies. Though the problem of high heating on the surface {{in the vicinity of the}} shock-shock interactions has been studied at length at supersonic Mach numbers, the study on the topic at the hypersonic Mach numbers is little sparse. Even in the studies at hypersonic Mach numbers, the high speeds are not simulated, which is the measure of the kinetic energy of the ow. Very few experimental studies have addressed this problem by simulating the energy content of the ow. Also, some of the numerical studies on the shock-shock interactions suggest the presence of unsteadiness in the shock-shock interaction patterns as observed by Edney (1968), though this observation is not made very clearly in the experimental studies undertaken so far. In the present study, experiments are carried out in a conventional shock tunnel at Mach number of 5. 62 (total enthalpy of 1. 07 MJ/kg; freestream velocity of 1361 m/s), with the objective of mapping the surface pressure distribution and surface convective heat transfer rate distribution on the hemispherical body in the presence of the shock-shock interactions. A shock generator which is basically a wedge of angle = 25, is placed at some dis-dance in front of the hemispherical body such that the planar oblique shock wave from the shock generator hits the bow shock wave in front of the hemi-spherical body. The relative distance between the wedge tip and the nose of the hemispherical body is allowed to change in di erent experiments to capture the whole realm of shock-shock interaction by making the planar oblique shock wave interact with the bow shock wave at different locations along its trajectory. The study results in a bulk of data for the surface pressure and heat transfer rates which were obtained by placing 5 kulites pressure transducers, 1 PCB pressure transducer and 21 platinum thin lm gauges along the surface of the hemispherical body in a plane normal to the freestream velocity direction. Along with the measurement of the surface pressure and the surface heat transfer rates, the schlieren visualization is carried out to capture the shock waves, expansion fans, slip lines, present in a certain shock-shock interaction pattern and the measured values were correlated with the captured schlieren images to evaluate the ow build up and steady and useful test time thereby helping in understanding the ow physics in the presence of the shock-shock interactions. From the present study it has been observed that in the presence of Edney Type-I and Edney Type-II interaction, the heat transfer rates on the hemi-spherical body are symmetrical <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>centerline</b> of the body, with the peak heating at the centerline which drops towards the shoulder. For Edney Type-III, Edney Type-IV, Edney Type-V and Edney Type-VI interaction pattern, the distribution in not symmetrical and shifts in peak heat transfer rates being on the side of the hemispherical from which planar oblique shock wave is incident. Also, it is observed that for the interactions which appear within the sonic circle, Edney Type-III and Edney Type-IV, the heat transfer rates observe an unsteadiness, such that the gauges located close to the interaction region experiencing varying heat transfer rates during the useful test time of the shock tunnel. Few experiments were conducted at Mach 8. 36 (total enthalpy of 1. 29 MJ/kg; freestream velocity of 1555. 25 m/s) and Mach 10. 14 (total enthalpy of 2. 67 MJ/kg; freestream velocity of 2258. 51 m/s) for the con gurations representing Edney Type-III interaction pattern to further evaluate the unsteady nature observed at Mach 5. 62 ows. The unsteadiness was evident in both the cases. It is realized that the short test times in the shock tunnels pose a constraint in the study of unsteady flow fields, and the use of tailored mode operation of shock tunnel can alleviate this constraint. Also, limited number of experiments in the present study, which are carried out in a Free Piston Shock Tunnel, helps to understand the need to conduct such study in high enthalpy test conditions...|$|E
40|$|Spatial {{patterns}} of scour and fill in two dryland ephemeral stream channels with sandy bed material have been measured with dense arrays of scour chains. Although {{the depth and}} areal extent of bed activity increased with discharge, active bed reworking at particular locations within the reaches resulted in downstream {{patterns of}} alternate shallower and deeper areas of scour. The variation was such that mean scour depths for individual cross sections varied <b>about</b> <b>the</b> mean for the reach {{by a factor of}} 2 – 4 while the locus of maximum scour traced a sinuous path <b>about</b> <b>the</b> channel <b>centerline.</b> <b>The</b> wavelength of the pattern of scour was <b>about</b> seven times <b>the</b> channel width. During each event, compensating fill returned the streambeds to preflow elevations, indicating that the streams were in approximate steady state over the period of study. Although the patterns of periodically enhanced scour along alternate sides of the channels are consistent with models of periodically reversing helical flow, further work is required to identify the causal relationships between patterns of flow and sediment transport in dryland sand bed channels.

40|$|A {{conducting}} two-dimensional periodic {{composite of}} two anisotropic phases with anisotropic, not necessarily symmetric, conductivity tensors is considered. By finding approximate representations for the relevant operators, an approximation formula is derived for the effective matrix valued conductivity {{as a function}} of the two matrix valued conductivity tensors of the phases. This approximation should converge to the exact effective conductivity function as the number of basis fields tends to infinity. Using the approximations for the relevant operators one can also directly obtain approximations, with the same geometry, for the effective tensors of coupled field problems, including elasticity, piezoelectricity, and thermoelectricity. To avoid technical complications we assume that the phase geometry is symmetric under reflection <b>about</b> one of <b>the</b> <b>centerlines</b> of <b>the</b> unit cell.

40|$|AbstractWake {{structures}} {{behind a}} cylindrical rotator with asymmetric protrusions were investigated through a laboratory experiment. Such a cylindrical rotator could prevent a flood disaster {{due to the}} accumulation of driftwood at bridges. In this study, a rotator composed of a cylinder with five quarter-cylindrical protrusions {{was placed in a}} unidirectional flow. The rotator could rotate freely under hydrodynamic forces. The results indicate that vortices shed from the rotator affected flow structures behind the rotator. The transverse distribution of the time-average longitudinal velocity of the flow with respect to the rotator was asymmetric <b>about</b> <b>the</b> longitudinal <b>centerline.</b> In <b>the</b> accelerating area with rotation of the rotator, five vortices were obviously shed from each quarter-cylindrical protrusion in each period. Where the flow and rotation were in opposite directions, vortices formation was disrupted. A longitudinal series of vortices merged downstream, ultimately becoming a single vortex. Therefore, the wake flow becomes asymmetric in an area behind the rotator where a significant torque acts...|$|R

40|$|The Langley Hypersonic CF 4 Tunnel is a Mach 6 {{facility}} which simulates {{an important}} aspect of dissociative real-gas phenomena associated with the reentry of blunt vehicles, i. e., the decrease in the ratio of specific heats (gamma) that occurs within the shock layer of the vehicle. A general description of this facility is presented along with a discussion of the basic components, instrumentation, and operating procedure. Pitot-pressure surveys were made at the nozzle exit and downstream of the exit for reservoir temperatures from 1020 to 1495 R and reservoir pressures from 1000 to 2550 psia. A uniform test core having a diameter of circa 11 in. (0. 55 times the nozzle-exit diameter) exists at the maximum value of reservoir pressure and temperature. The corresponding free-stream Mach number is 5. 9, the unit Reynolds number is 4 x 10 to the 5 th power per foot, the ratio of specific heats immediately behind a normal shock is 1. 10, and the normal-shock density ratio is 12. 6. When the facility is operated at reservoir temperatures below 1440 R, irregularities occur in the pitot-pressure profile within a small region <b>about</b> <b>the</b> nozzle <b>centerline.</b> These variations in pitot pressure indicate the existence of flow distrubances originating in the upstream region of the nozzle. This necessitates testing models off <b>centerline</b> in <b>the</b> uniform flow between <b>the</b> <b>centerline</b> region and either the nozzle boundary layer or the lip shock originating at the nozzle exit. Samples of data obtained in this facility with various models are presented to illustrate the effect of gamma on flow conditions <b>about</b> <b>the</b> model and the importance of knowing the magnitude of this effect...|$|R
40|$|A {{mechanical}} {{scheme for}} manipulating the forebody vortices of an F/A- 18, therefore creating controlled yawing moments at moderate and high angles of attack, {{was investigated in}} a wind tunnel. The technique consists of rotating miniature strakes (single or dual) <b>about</b> <b>the</b> radome <b>centerline</b> {{very close to the}} tip of the model. Forces, moments, and pressures were measured for angles of attack up to 60 deg and sideslip angles up to - 10 deg. Results indicate that single and dual strakes can produce changes in side force and yawing moment, with magnitudes comparable to, or in some cases higher than, the directional changes produced by a 30 -deg rudder deflection at 0 -deg angle of attack. According to its circumferential position, the strake alters the separation location, inducing different degrees of asymmetry in the forebody vortex flow field that are translated into changes in side force and yawing moment. In comparison, the dual strakes appear to provide more gradual and better behaved changes than the single strake. Excellent correlation was found between this test and water tunnel tests performed on a similar configuration...|$|R
40|$|A flow survey {{has been}} made of the test section of the NASA Langley Research Center 16 -Foot Transonic Tunnel at subsonic and {{supersonic}} speeds. The survey was performed using five five-hole pyramid-head probes mounted at 14 inch intervals on a survey rake. Probes were calibrated at freestream Mach numbers from 0. 50 to 0. 95 and from 1. 18 to 1. 23. Flowfield surveys were made at Mach numbers from 0. 50 to 0. 90 and at Mach 1. 20. The surveys were made at tunnel stations 130. 6, 133. 6, and 136. 0.

40|$|International audienceThe {{physical}} model {{considered in the}} present numerical work is a square air-filled cavity cooled from below and above, with a heated square body located at the cavity center. The aim is to establish the effects of radiation interchanges amongst surfaces on the transition from steady, symmetric flows <b>about</b> <b>the</b> cavity <b>centerline</b> to complex periodic flows. Owing to the low temperature differences involved (1 K ≤ ∆T ≤ 5 K), the two-dimensional model {{is based on the}} Boussinesq approximation and constant thermophysical fluid properties at room temperature. The cavity walls are assumed grey and diffuse. The flow structure is investigated for various Rayleigh numbers, emissivities of the wall surfaces and sizes of the inner body. The results clearly establish the influence of surface radiation, both for steady and unsteady flows. For the geometry and thermal boundary conditions considered, the Rayleigh number for the transition to unsteady flows is considerably increased under the influence of radiation. This work underlines the difficulties in comparing experimental data and numerical solutions for gas-filled cavities partly subjected to wall heat flux boundary conditions...|$|R
40|$|Rural two-lane roads {{generally}} lack physical {{measures such}} as wide medians or barriers to separate opposing traffic flows. As a result, a major crash problem on these roads involves vehicles crossing <b>the</b> <b>centerline</b> and either sideswiping or striking the front ends of opposing vehicles. These types of opposing-direction crashes account for about 20 percent all fatal crashes on rural two-lane roads and result in about 4, 500 fatalities annually. The present study evaluated a potential engineering countermeasure for such crashes — installation of rumble strips along <b>the</b> <b>centerlines</b> of undivided rural two-lane roads to warn/alert distracted, fatigued, or speeding motorists whose vehicles are <b>about</b> to cross <b>the</b> <b>centerlines</b> and encroach into opposing traffic lanes. Data were analyzed for approximately 210 miles of treated roads in seven states before and after installation of centerline rumble strips. An empirical Bayes before-after procedure was employed to properly account for regression to the mean while normalizing for differences in traffic volume and other factors between the before and after periods. Overall results indicated significant reductions for all injury crashes combined (15 percent, 95 percent confidence interval (95 % CI) = 5 - 25 percent) {{as well as for}} frontal and opposing-direction sideswipe injury crashes (25 percent, 95 % CI = 5 - 45 percent) — the primary target of centerline rumble strips. In light of their effectiveness and relatively low installation costs, consideration should be given to installing centerline rumble strips more widely on rural two-lane roads {{to reduce the risk of}} frontal and opposing-direction sideswipe crashes...|$|R
