The current consensus state that, even though the League failed to achieve its ultimate goal of world peace, it did manage to build new roads towards expanding the rule of law across the globe; strengthened the concept of collective security, giving <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> <b>to</b> smaller nations; helped to raise awareness to problems like epidemics, slavery, child labor, colonial tyranny, refugee crisis and general working conditions through its numerous commissions and committees; and paved the way for new forms of statehood, as the mandate system put the colonial powers under international observation.|$|E

His {{books are}} {{remarkable}} accounts of the society he surveys, and their accuracy and insight have helped to give a realistic basis to any schemes for improvement. Above all he has given <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> <b>to</b> the abandoned, forgotten, despairing, nameless, suffering people of Sicily.

Sports columnist Glyn Lewis of The Columbian newspaper in New Westminster, BC published an article saying: “Pushing deadline the other day, The Woolley Jumper attracted some mild attention by standing in the line of my typewriter’s return carriage.

25|$|Al Jazeera {{came to the}} {{attention}} of many in the West during the hunt for Osama bin Laden and the Taliban in Afghanistan after the 11 September 2001 attacks on the United States. It aired videos it received from Osama bin Laden and the Taliban, deeming new footage of the world's most wanted fugitives to be newsworthy. Some criticized the network for giving <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> <b>to</b> terrorists. Al Jazeera's Washington, D.C., bureau chief, Hafez al-Mirazi, compared the situation to that of the Unabomber's messages in The New York Times. The network said it had been given the tapes because it had a large Arab audience.|$|E
25|$|Janis {{remained}} at Woodstock {{for the remainder}} of the festival. She is said to have really enjoyed Sly and The Family Stone's performance immediately after hers. Starting at approximately 3:00a.m. on Monday, August 18, Joplin was among many Woodstock performers who stood in a circle behind Crosby, Stills & Nash during their performance, which was the first time anyone at Woodstock ever had heard the group perform with Neil Young. This information was published by David Crosby in 1988. Later in the morning of August 18, Joplin and Joan Baez sat in Joe Cocker's van and witnessed Hendrix's close-of-show performance, according to Baez's memoir And <b>a</b> <b>Voice</b> <b>to</b> Sing With (1989).|$|E

25|$|Despite their {{systematic}} oppression, a {{class of}} Hutu political intelligentsia influenced by contemporary communist thought emerged, forming a stance against elite rule of the proletariat masses, which was reinterpreted as Tutsi rule over the Hutu. This Hutu counter-elite exploded onto the political scene in the late 1950s as both Belgian colonial influence and their firm support of the Tutsi minority declined. The emerging Hutu counter-elite provided <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> <b>to</b> the majority “Hutu” people, via a series of political proclamations and, later, sweeping electoral victories. Yet the voice that emerged was one embittered by decades of subjugation; one which championed Hutu nationalism and anti-Tutsi sentiment. The result was a “Hutu political consciousness” driven by populist and nationalistic forces, {{with the goal of}} dethroning the privileged Tutsi and driving a deeper wedge between their peoples.|$|E
25|$|In Ten Inny ("The Other"), a {{collection}} of lectures delivered in Vienna, Graz and Cracow, published shortly before his death, Kapuściński laments a state of affairs perpetuated by the myths which inculcate {{the notion of the}} Other as sub-human or non-human. He saw encountering the Other as the main challenge for the twenty-first century. The posthumously published Ho dato voce ai poveri: dialogo con i giovani ("I Gave <b>a</b> <b>Voice</b> <b>to</b> the Poor: Conversations with the Youth"; Trent, Il Margine, 2007; subsequently published in Poland as Dałem głos ubogim. Rozmowy z młodzieżą; Cracow, Znak, 2008) is a record of Kapuściński's interactions with the students of the University of Bolzano in Italy in October 2006; while Rwący nurt historii. Zapiski o XX i XXI wieku ("In the Whirlpools of History: Jottings on the 20th and the 21st Centuries"; Cracow, Znak, 2007) is a compilation of interviews and lectures, reflecting Kapuściński's training as a historian and dealing with contemporary issues and their historical and cross-cultural parallels (including such issues as globalisation, Islam, the birth of the Third World, and the dawn of the Pacific civilisation).|$|E

Thus, according to Johns, [...] "Mannenberg" [...] shared with other great music the characteristic of being [...] "both specific and universal." [...] He added: ...|$|E
500|$|On 10 March 2011, former Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi {{called for}} Dhondup Wangchen's release {{in honor of}} Tibetan Uprising Day. Also in early 2011, Boston's American Repertory Theater and System of a Down's Serj Tankian {{dedicated}} their production of Prometheus Bound to him and seven other activists, stating in program notes that [...] "by singing the story of Prometheus, the God who defied the tyrant Zeus by giving the human race both fire and art, this production hopes to give <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> <b>to</b> those currently being silenced or endangered by modern-day oppressors".|$|E
500|$|Conversely, {{reflecting}} the transformation from script to screen, Dana Stevens of Slate disagrees with Gleiberman's {{suggestion that the}} [...] "film makes you think" [...] and argues that the film's [...] "eagerness" [...] to [...] "drag" [...] the audience [...] "through the lower depths of human experience" [...] leaves little space for independent [...] "conclusions". Stevens noted that while the film is about improvement and self-actualization, [...] "it wields an awfully large cudgel" [...] in contrast to Scott's view of balance: [...] "unsparing force (though not in overly graphic detail)". Perhaps sharing Mathews' view regarding the daunting challenge of adapting the harsh story of Push, Stevens' observes that [...] "Daniels and Fletcher no doubt intended for their film to lend <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> <b>to</b> the kind of protagonist too often excluded from American movie screens: a poor, black, overweight single mother from the inner city." ...|$|E
