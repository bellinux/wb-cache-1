5|$|Two African Americans {{received}} the Medal of Honor for {{action in the}} Korean War, both were soldiers of the 24th Infantry Regiment. Despite a 1948 Executive Order commanding {{the integration of the}} military, segregated units persisted until 1954; the 24th Infantry {{was one of the last}} remaining all-black regiments, <b>and</b> <b>these</b> <b>two</b> men were the last African Americans to receive the Medal of Honor for actions while serving in a segregated unit.|$|E
5|$|A {{challenge}} {{to all of}} these alternative scenarios came when Turner and colleagues in 2007 described a new dromaeosaurid, Mahakala, which they found to be the most basal and most primitive member of the Dromaeosauridae, more primitive than Microraptor. Mahakala had short arms and no ability to glide. Turner et al. also inferred that flight evolved only in the Avialae, <b>and</b> <b>these</b> <b>two</b> points suggested that the ancestral dromaeosaurid could not glide or fly. Based on this cladistic analysis, Mahakala suggests that the ancestral condition for dromaeosaurids is non-volant. However, in 2012, an expanded and revised study incorporating the most recent Dromaeosaurid finds recovered the Archaeopteryx-like Xiaotingia as the most primitive member of the clade Dromaeosauridae, which appears to suggest the earliest members of the clade may have been capable of flight.|$|E
5|$|Tethys is {{the third}} largest of Saturn's inner moons. Its most {{prominent}} features are a large (400km diameter) impact crater named Odysseus on its leading hemisphere and a vast canyon system named Ithaca Chasma extending at least 270° around Tethys. The Ithaca Chasma is concentric with Odysseus, <b>and</b> <b>these</b> <b>two</b> features may be related. Tethys appears to have no current geological activity. A heavily cratered hilly terrain occupies {{the majority of its}} surface, while a smaller and smoother plains region lies on the hemisphere opposite to that of Odysseus. The plains contain fewer craters and are apparently younger. A sharp boundary separates them from the cratered terrain. There is also a system of extensional troughs radiating away from Odysseus. The density of Tethys (0.985g/cm3) is less than that of water, indicating that it is made mainly of water ice with {{only a small fraction of}} rock.|$|E

5|$|At {{the border}} with Deptford Township, Route 47 reaches an {{intersection}} known as Five Points. Here, the road meets Route 41, County Route 603, and County Route 630. Route 47 turns northwest as this intersection and runs through wooded areas with some dwellings, with Route 55 intersecting the route at a cloverleaf interchange a short distance later. Past this interchange, the road continues through wooded inhabited areas, eventually turning due north. It comes to an intersection with the western terminus of County Route 534 as the route heads through more suburban homes along with businesses. Past this intersection, Route 47 passes businesses before crossing over the New Jersey Turnpike without an interchange. From here, it heads through more inhabited areas before entering Westville. Upon entering Westville, the route has a partial cloverleaf interchange with Interstate 295. Past this interchange, the road runs through neighborhoods, intersecting County Route 621 (Almonesson Road) and County Route 551. The latter forms a concurrency with Route 47 <b>and</b> <b>these</b> <b>two</b> routes run northeast through commercial areas as a four-lane undivided road, crossing the Big Timber Creek into Brooklawn, Camden County. Here, {{it comes to a}} traffic circle with U.S. Route 130 and County Route 753, where Route 47 ends and County Route 551 continues on to Camden, forming a brief concurrency with U.S. Route 130.|$|E
5|$|Heathrow is {{the largest}} airport in the country, {{handling}} over 67million terminal passengers in 2006, making it the third busiest airport in the world, and the busiest if measured {{by the number of}} international passengers. Nearly a third of all overseas residents visiting the UK enter the country via this airport, which also handles more than a fifth of all overseas visits by UK residents. Even though there are no dedicated freight services operating out of Heathrow, the practise of transporting cargo in the holds of passenger aircraft means that this airport still accounts {{for more than half of}} all freight handled by UK airports. Gatwick airport, with 34million terminal passengers, is the second largest in the country, eighth busiest in the world for international passenger traffic, and lays claim to the busiest single runway airport in the world. Between them the five London airports handle nearly 137million terminal passengers, 59 per cent of the national total. Stansted and East Midlands airports have both experienced large growth in freight handling over the past decade, <b>and</b> <b>these</b> <b>two</b> airports are the major hubs for express freight operations.|$|E

25|$|According to rabbinic literature, God via the Torah {{commands}} Jews {{to observe}} (refrain from forbidden activity) and remember (with words, thoughts, and actions) Shabbat, <b>and</b> <b>these</b> <b>two</b> actions are {{symbolized by the}} customary two Shabbat candles.

England and Australia also played the first One Day International (ODI) on 5 January 1971. England's first Twenty20 International (T20I) was played on 13 June 2005, once more against Australia.|$|E
25|$|Telecommunications {{engineering}} {{focuses on the}} transmission of information across a channel such as a coax cable, optical fiber or free space. Transmissions across free space require information to be encoded in a carrier signal to shift the information to a carrier frequency suitable for transmission; {{this is known as}} modulation. Popular analog modulation techniques include amplitude modulation and frequency modulation. The choice of modulation affects the cost and performance of a system <b>and</b> <b>these</b> <b>two</b> factors must be balanced carefully by the engineer.|$|E

25|$|Unlike most {{metropolitan}} {{areas that have}} grown up around a central city, the Inland Empire has no one main focus city. Major cities in the region include Riverside, San Bernardino, Rancho Cucamonga, and Ontario. Suburban sprawl spreads out to form a unified/built up connection with the Los Angeles metropolitan area. Further development is steadily, if not heavily, encroaching past the mountains into the outlying desert areas. The Inland Empire borders both Los Angeles and Orange counties. Freeways in Southern California are heavily used, but this comprehensive freeway system has made travel between the Inland Empire <b>and</b> <b>these</b> <b>two</b> counties generally easy; especially to and from Los Angeles County.|$|E
25|$|Motor racing resumed in 1920 after {{extensive}} track {{repairs and}} Grand Prix motor racing was established at Brooklands in 1926 by Henry Segrave, after his {{victories in the}} 1923 French Grand Prix and the San Sebastián Grand Prix (all won on Sunbeam Racing Cars which in various hands had significant success in Brooklands) the following year raised interest in the sport in Britain. This first British Grand Prix was won by Louis Wagner and Robert Sénéchal, sharing the drive in a Delage 155B.

25|$|Consort Wu soon overtook Consort Xiao as Emperor Gaozong's favourite. In 652, {{she gave}} birth to her first child, a son named Li Hong. In 653, {{she gave birth}} to another son, Li Xián. Neither of these sons were in {{contention}} to be Emperor Gaozong's heir because Emperor Gaozong had, at the request of officials influenced by Empress Wang and her uncle, the chancellor Liu Shi, designated his oldest son Li Zhong as his heir. Li Zhong's mother, Consort Liu, was of lowly birth and Empress Wang expected her gratitude. By 654, both Empress Wang and Consort Xiao had lost favour with Emperor Gaozong, <b>and</b> <b>these</b> <b>two</b> former romantic rivals joined forces against Consort Wu, but to no avail. As a sign of his love for Consort Wu, in 654 Emperor Gaozong conferred posthumous honors on her father Wu Shihuo.|$|E
25|$|In the {{replay of}} the {{previous}} year's playoffs with the Cavaliers holding home court advantage against Washington Wizards, the Cavaliers {{took care of the}} Wizards in a four-game sweep, after the season-ending injuries of both Gilbert Arenas and Caron Butler. In {{the second round of the}} playoffs, the Cavaliers faced off against the New Jersey Nets. Again, the Cavaliers had home court advantage, and battled with the Nets through 6 games before becoming victorious in the series. The Cavaliers for only the third time in franchise history, advanced to the conference finals, and this time they were facing a familiar foe. The Detroit Pistons, the number one seed in the Eastern Conference, with their home court advantage, were waiting for the Cavaliers. This was the same Detroit team that knocked the Cavaliers out of the second round last year. The expectations were high after a long 7 game series the previous year <b>and</b> <b>these</b> <b>two</b> teams would not disappoint.|$|E
25|$|George Banta Sr., a Phi Delt from Franklin-Indiana, was {{instrumental}} in expanding the Delta Gamma sorority. For his efforts, {{he was the only}} man ever initiated into Delta Gamma. Banta would later perform initiation ceremonies for new members of the sorority, including Lillian Vawter, his fiancée. Guy Potter Benton, a graduate of the Phi Delt chapter at Ohio Wesleyan University, was president of Miami University in 1902 when he helped with the founding of Delta Zeta. Dr. Benton aided in the preparation of a ritual, badge, and colors. He was a great assistance to Delta Zeta and at one point chased down a man who stole the newly formed ritual of the sorority. For his work, Delta Zeta named him the Grand Patron of the sorority and is the only man to ever wear the Delta Zeta badge. To this day, an amiable friendship exists between Phi Delta Theta <b>and</b> <b>these</b> <b>two</b> sororities.|$|E
