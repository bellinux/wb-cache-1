25|$|On 24 January 2007, Tommaso Ghirardi was {{announced}} as new owner of Parma FC following a public <b>auction</b> <b>sale</b> following a failed bid from ex-Real Madrid director Lorenzo Sanz the previous year, which {{failed to meet}} the then-asking price of €27m. Ghirardi, a 31-year-old entrepreneur and owner of Serie C2 club AC Carpenedolo, also became president of Parma F.C., ending three years of state-controlled management. Having qualifying for the Round of 32 of the 2006–07 UEFA Cup, Parma were eliminated from the competition by S.C. Braga, who prevailed by a single goal to nil in both legs; the home match was played behind closed doors after the Italian Government ruled that Parma's stadium did not meet requirements set out following recent riots in a league match in Sicily. On 12 February, second-last placed Parma fired head coach Pioli and replaced him with Claudio Ranieri who, against overwhelming odds, managed to avoid relegation to Serie B {{on the final day of}} the season, before leaving at the end of the season. In the 2007–08 season, Parma again battled with relegation. Three different head coaches (Domenico Di Carlo, Héctor Cúper, and caretaker Andrea Manzo) took charge that season, but none were able to preserve Parma's Serie A status, as they lost 2–0 at home to champions Internazionale on the final day of the season, Zlatan Ibrahimović eventually sealing their fate and consigning them to Serie B football after eighteen years in the top flight.|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} {{synopsis of}} the film {{was published in the}} Moving Picture World as follows: [...] "Professor Dix has won fame as a scientist and has collected many objects of Egyptian ware, centuries old, that arouse the enthusiasm of his associates. Even Jack Thornton, an active, go-ahead young businessman, is interested in the professor's home, but although he tries to pretend it is Egyptology which interests him, the professor's fair young daughter is really the lodestone. Jack decides to win the old man's respect by posing as an Egyptologist himself. To start his collection, he purchases a mummy at an <b>auction</b> <b>sale,</b> and takes it home expecting that later he can make a great hit with his sweetheart's father, by presenting it to him as a gift. While the mummy is in Jack's room, a live electric wire is by accident brought in contact with it. The body has been so perfectly mummified, that the electric current is all that is necessary to ignite the vital spark, and Jack is amazed to see dancing forth from the case which he thought contained only unattractive rags and bones, a beautiful Egyptian princess. As soon as she is released, the mummy makes violent love to Jack, and causes his sweetheart to quarrel with him (for how can a plain businessman explain the presence in his room of a beautiful barbarian?). When her love is spurned, the visitor from the distant past avenges herself by having Jack made into a mummy and placed in the case in her stead. Her heart relents, however, in time to save him from being 'cut up' by the professor, who with the sharp knife, starts to investigate the contents of the mummy case. But all ends happily when Jack's plain statements of the seemingly impossible facts are proved true by the professor. Jack is reunited to his sweetheart, and the professor, being a widower, also an ardent admirer of everything antique, leads the recreated Egyptian lady to the altar, {{in spite of the fact}} that there is a difference of several thousand years in their ages." ...|$|E
