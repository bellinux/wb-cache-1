500|$|Filmed in real time, {{the episode}} is {{designed}} to look like it was recorded in four uninterrupted eleven-minute takes. Carter explained, [...] "I said [...] 'Wouldn't it be great since we have 44 minutes of programming time if we just did an episode where we did four 11-minute takes and put it all together?' And everyone looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> was nuts." [...] To film the episode, camera operator Dave Luckenbach wore a steadicam. However, the steadicam used could only hold a maximum of four minutes of film, so discreet edits and cuts were necessary. Luckenbach later likened the physical aftermath of filming to playing football, [...] "You'd have a game on Friday, and you'd wake up Saturday and really feel it." [...] The cuts were usually made during whip pans or in scenes when the screen would go dark. With the exception of Mulder jumping off the Queen Anne, the only noticeable editing occurs between scenes, when a side swipe shifts between the two different time periods. Many of the takes needed to be nearly perfect; for example, of the takes made on the eighth day of filming, only two of ten were deemed satisfactory.|$|E

[...] After finishing his college degree, Robinson {{was unable to find}} a suitable career in his hometown of Gulfport. Robinson attributed this to racial discrimination as many of the local garages were under white ownership; speaking to his father, he said, [...] " [...] give me a job sweeping, filling gas tanks, changing tires, or washing, but I'm an engine man... When I talk to [...] about automotive science they smile, look at each other, and then look <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> belong behind a mule and a plow." ...|$|E
2500|$|On May 6, 2015, Bateman and Ginnifer Goodwin were {{announced}} {{as having been}} cast, respectively in the roles of Nick Wilde and Judy Hopps. The filmmakers chose Bateman because they wanted an actor who could bring [...] "a funny yet heartfelt side" [...] with [...] "a wily, dry-witted sort of voice." [...] Bateman described his character as [...] "a crafty, sarcastic schemer," [...] remarking on the role's similarity to many other roles he had done since he was 12. He explained that he had said to the directors: [...] "'What kind of voice do you guys want me to do?' And they just looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> was an idiot and said, 'Just do what you do. Just talk.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Smith found that, at the time, nobody {{believed}} in her concept of stylish activewear. As she later recalled, even major brands like Nike {{did not have}} concept stores for their clothing in those days. When Bill Clarkson showed the products to major department store Myer, their fashion buyers were uninterested and unsure of how to position the garments. He recalls that when he explained the clothes should not be sold in the sports section, [...] "The buyer looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> was crazy. They had no box to put me in." [...] Eventually, Myer bought a small range for five of their stores and stocked it in a corner between swimwear and lingerie. The Lorna Jane corporate website {{goes so far as}} to credit Smith with coining the word [...] "activewear" [...] in 1989, although the Merriam-Webster dictionary notes the word's first known usage was in 1924.|$|E
