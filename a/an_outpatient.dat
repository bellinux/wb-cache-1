5|$|High-dose rate (HDR) {{brachytherapy}} is {{when the}} rate of dose delivery exceeds 12Gy·h−1. The most common applications of HDR brachytherapy are in tumours of the cervix, esophagus, lungs, breasts and prostate. Most HDR treatments are performed on <b>an</b> <b>outpatient</b> basis, but this {{is dependent on the}} treatment site.|$|E

5|$|On 10 February 1889, {{the town}} of Sibu was burnt to the ground. This has caused a {{developmental}} delay in Sibu. The first hospital in Sibu was built by the Brooke government in 1912.

However, the Tua Pek Kong Temple remained intact. The locals considered this a miracle.|$|E

5|$|By 1932, the Vassar {{population}} had outgrown the Alumnae Gymnasium {{and a new}} facility, the Helen Kenyon Hall of Physical Education, was built. Kenyon featured a new indoor pool (which, at , made {{it one of the}} United States' largest indoor swimming pools), as well as tennis, squash, and handball courts. Consequently, in 1933, the Alumnae Gymnasium was renamed Ely Hall after its early benefactor. In that same year, the building underwent minor renovation to convert some of the building's back rooms to <b>an</b> <b>outpatient</b> clinic, nurses' quarters, and doctors' offices.|$|E
5|$|Chlordiazepoxide is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used benzodiazepine for alcohol detoxification, but diazepam may be used as an alternative. Both are used in the detoxification of individuals who are motivated to stop drinking, and are prescribed {{for a short period of}} time to reduce the risks of developing tolerance and dependence to the benzodiazepine medication itself. The benzodiazepines with a longer half-life make detoxification more tolerable, and dangerous (and potentially lethal) alcohol withdrawal effects are less likely to occur. On the other hand, short-acting benzodiazepines may lead to breakthrough seizures, and are, therefore, not recommended for detoxification in <b>an</b> <b>outpatient</b> setting. Oxazepam and lorazepam are often used in patients at risk of drug accumulation, in particular, the elderly and those with cirrhosis, because they are metabolized differently from other benzodiazepines, through conjugation.|$|E
5|$|On 1 August 1940, Governor-General Hans Frank {{issued a}} decree {{requiring}} all Kraków Jews {{to leave the}} city within the next two weeks. Only those who had jobs directly related to the German war effort would be allowed to stay. Of the 60,000 to 80,000 Jews then living in the city, only 15,000 remained by March 1941. These Jews were then forced to leave their traditional neighbourhood of Kazimierz and relocate to the walled Kraków Ghetto, established in the industrial Podgórze district. Schindler's workers travelled on foot to and from the ghetto each day to their jobs at the factory. Enlargements to the facility in the four years Schindler was in charge included the addition of <b>an</b> <b>outpatient</b> clinic, co-op, kitchen, and dining room for the workers, in addition to expansion of the factory and its related office space.|$|E

5|$|Small {{spontaneous}} pneumothoraces do {{not always}} require treatment, as {{they are unlikely to}} proceed to respiratory failure or tension pneumothorax, and generally resolve spontaneously. This approach is most appropriate if the estimated size of the pneumothorax is small (defined as <50% of the volume of the hemithorax), there is no breathlessness, and there is no underlying lung disease. It may be appropriate to treat a larger PSP conservatively if the symptoms are limited. Admission to hospital is often not required, as long as clear instructions are given to return to hospital if there are worsening symptoms. Further investigations may be performed as <b>an</b> <b>outpatient,</b> at which time X-rays are repeated to confirm improvement, and advice given with regard to preventing recurrence (see below). Estimated rates of resorption are between 1.25% and 2.2% the volume of the cavity per day. This would mean that even a complete pneumothorax would spontaneously resolve over a period of about 6 weeks. There; however, is no high quality evidence comparing conservative to non conservative management.|$|E
5|$|Still {{working for}} Lifemark, Scrushy devised {{a plan for}} <b>an</b> <b>outpatient</b> {{diagnostics}} and rehabilitative health clinic chain. He presented the plan to Lifemark, but the company was unable to act on it due to a company merger that was already underway with American Medical International. Scrushy left Lifemark in 1983 and founded Amcare, Inc within a year. The new company opened its first facility in Little Rock, Arkansas and had initial capital between $50,000-$70,000. With the assistance of four partners from Amcare Inc. and a one million dollar investment by Citicorp Venture Capital, Scrushy took the quickly growing company and founded HealthSouth in 1984. Two years after its founding, HealthSouth became a publicly traded company in 1986. The next year, HealthSouth expanded into two new fields, worker’s compensation and sports medicine, allowing the company to double its earnings and obtain assets close to $100 million. By the early 1990s, the company had expanded even more, with facilities {{in each of the}} 50 U.S states and revenues in excess of $181 million.|$|E
5|$|On July 8, 2013, Rice {{signed with}} the Washington Wizards. In the 2013 NBA Summer League, he twice {{registered}} the Summer League Sprite Dunk of the Day (July 14 and 19). Rice made his professional debut in the Wizards' seventh {{game of the season}} on November 12, 2013, against the Dallas Mavericks, making his only shot (a three-pointer) and adding a rebound. After Rice's debuted by playing the final 79 seconds of a loss that caused the Wizards to fall to 25, head coach Randy Wittman said he would probably shuffle the lineup. In the following game against San Antonio on November 13, Rice played 13 minutes and tallied 3 rebounds while registering his first NBA steal. On December 9, with Bradley Beal injured and Martell Webster sitting out, Rice who had totaled 11 points in his first 8 games, was given his first NBA start against Denver. Rice scored 7 points to go along with 3 rebounds and 3 steals. On December 18, Rice had <b>an</b> <b>outpatient</b> procedure in New York to repair a fractured right wrist suffered two days earlier.
