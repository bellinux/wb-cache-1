5|$|The PTBT was a {{first of}} a series of nuclear <b>arms</b> <b>control</b> {{treaties}} in the second half of 20th century. The PTBT has been considered the stepping stone to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) of 1968, which made explicit reference to the progress provided by the PTBT. In addition to the NPT, the PTBT was followed within ten years by the Outer Space Treaty and Treaty of Tlatelolco in 1967, Seabed <b>Arms</b> <b>Control</b> Treaty in 1971, and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 1972. In 1974, the Threshold Test Ban Treaty prohibited underground tests with yields above 150 kilotons.|$|E
5|$|From 1961 to 1968, Fisher {{served as}} the Deputy Director of the U.S. <b>Arms</b> <b>Control</b> and Disarmament Agency in which he took a primary {{negotiations}} role during the Atomic Test Ban Treaty of 1963 between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. At that time he was Deputy to John J. McCloy, Adviser to the President on Disarmament. In 1968, Fisher served {{as one of the}} chief U.S. negotiators of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which was signed by the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and 59 other countries on July 1, 1968. A collection of letters from Adrian Fisher to President Johnson and Secretary of State Dean Rusk regarding his perception and activities on <b>arms</b> <b>control</b> and disarmament is maintained by the Federation of American Scientists.|$|E
5|$|The Cuban Missile Crisis (October–November 1962) {{brought the}} world closer to nuclear war than ever before. The {{aftermath}} of the crisis led to the first efforts in the nuclear arms race at nuclear disarmament and improving relations, although the Cold War's first <b>arms</b> <b>control</b> agreement, the Antarctic Treaty, had come into force in 1961.|$|E

5|$|After the 1971 primary, Combs {{retired from}} {{politics}} and resumed his law practice, maintaining {{an office in}} Frankfort. He continued to represent large coal companies, drawing the ire of local environmentalist and author Harry M. Caudill, who asserted that Combs claimed to represent the powerless while actually representing the powerful. He {{was active in the}} formation of the Rural Housing and Development Corporation and served on the Council on Higher Education. He also served on President Jimmy Carter's General Advisory Committee on <b>Arms</b> <b>Control</b> and Disarmament.|$|E
5|$|East–West {{tensions}} rapidly subsided {{through the}} mid-to-late 1980s, culminating {{with the final}} summit in Moscow in 1989, when Gorbachev and George H. W. Bush signed the START I <b>arms</b> <b>control</b> treaty. During the following year it became apparent to the Soviets that oil and gas subsidies, along {{with the cost of}} maintaining massive troops levels, represented a substantial economic drain. In addition, the security advantage of a buffer zone was recognised as irrelevant and the Soviets officially declared that they would no longer intervene in the affairs of allied states in Central and Eastern Europe.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his visit}} to China, Nixon met with Soviet leaders, {{including}} Brezhnev in Moscow. These Strategic Arms Limitation Talks resulted in two landmark <b>arms</b> <b>control</b> treaties: SALT I, the first comprehensive limitation pact signed by the two superpowers, and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which banned the development of systems designed to intercept incoming missiles. These aimed to limit the development of costly anti-ballistic missiles and nuclear missiles.|$|E

5|$|In 1971 Matlock became Director of Soviet Affairs in the State Department. During Richard Nixon's presidency, {{a period}} known as détente, {{there was a}} {{reduction}} of Cold War tension. Matlock participated in the negotiation of <b>arms</b> <b>control</b> treaties and other bilateral agreements. In fact, he attended {{every one of the}} U.S.-Soviet summits for the 20-year period 1972–1991, {{with the exception of the}} 1979 Carter - Brezhnev summit.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, {{problems}} with the export policy were becoming apparent. The Soviets continued to sell newer aircraft designs to their clients, placing allies of the U.S. at a disadvantage. Denied by the U.S., countries were turning to other vendors for modern fighters, notably France's Dassault Mirage 2000. Barry N. Blechman, Assistant Director of the <b>Arms</b> <b>Control</b> and Disarmament Agency, testified that the US reductions in foreign arms transfers had actually encouraged other nations and increased worldwide arms sales. At the same time, there was considerable pressure to provide a suitable aircraft for Taiwan.|$|E
5|$|Switzerland {{signed the}} Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NTP) on 27 November 1969, and its process of {{ratification}} first {{met with the}} resistance of the Federal Department of Defense. After signing the treaty, Switzerland's policy of pursuing acquiring nuclear weapons was replaced by one of studying acquisition to provide options in case the treaty broke down. Switzerland ratified the treaty on 9 March 1977. Soon after that, Switzerland ratified the Seabed <b>Arms</b> <b>Control</b> Treaty.|$|E

40|$|Most robotic {{grasping}} tasks {{assume a}} stationary or fixed object. In this paper, we explore {{the requirements for}} grasping a moving object. This task requires proper coordination between at least 3 separate subsystems: dynamic vision sensing, real-time <b>arm</b> <b>control,</b> and grasp control. As with humans, our system first visually tracks the object's 3 -D position. Because the object is in motion, this must {{be done in a}} dynamic manner to coordinate the motion of the robotic arm as it tracks the object. The dynamic vision system is used to feed a real-time <b>arm</b> <b>control</b> algorithm that plans a trajectory. The <b>arm</b> <b>control</b> algorithm is implemented in two steps: 1) filtering and prediction, and 2) kinematic transformation computation. Once the trajectory of the object is tracked, the hand must intercept the object to actually grasp it. We present 3 different strategies for intercepting the object and results from the tracking algorithm...|$|R

He was a member of NASA's Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel from 1968 to 1974, and from 1978 to 1987. He became an adjunct professor at the University of California, San Diego in 1988. He was the recipient of the E.O. Lawrence Award in 1966, and of the Department of Energy's Enrico Fermi Award in 1978. Along with Hans Bethe, Agnew was the first to receive the Los Alamos National Laboratory Medal. He {{was a member of the}} National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering.|$|E
5|$|During his {{eighteen}} years as Leader of the USSR, Brezhnev's only major foreign policy innovation was détente. While sharing some similarities with Soviet policies pursued during the Khrushchev Thaw, Brezhnev's adoption of détente significantly differed from Khrushchev's precedent in two ways. The first {{was that it}} was more comprehensive and wide-ranging in its aims, and included signing agreements on <b>arms</b> <b>control,</b> crisis prevention, East–West trade, European security and human rights. The second part of the policy was based on the importance of equalising the military strength of the United States and the Soviet Union. Defence spending under Brezhnev between 1965 and 1970 increased by 40%, and annual increases continued thereafter. In the year of Brezhnev's death in 1982, 15% of GNP was spent on the military.|$|E
5|$|New {{claims on}} Antarctica have been {{suspended}} since 1959, although in 2015 Norway formally defined Queen Maud Land as including the unclaimed area {{between it and the}} South Pole. Antarctica's status is regulated by the 1959 Antarctic Treaty and other related agreements, collectively called the Antarctic Treaty System. Antarctica is defined as all land and ice shelves south of 60° S {{for the purposes of the}} Treaty System. The treaty was signed by twelve countries including the Soviet Union (and later Russia), the United Kingdom, Argentina, Chile, Australia, and the United States. It set aside Antarctica as a scientific preserve, established freedom of scientific investigation and environmental protection, and banned military activity on Antarctica. This was the first <b>arms</b> <b>control</b> agreement established during the Cold War.|$|E

5|$|The 1972–73 {{debate over}} French nuclear {{testing in the}} Pacific mobilised several groups, {{including}} some trade unions. In 1972 the International Court of Justice in a case launched by Australia and New Zealand, and advocated by Dr Helen Caldicott, ordered that the French cease atmospheric nuclear testing at Mururoa atoll. In 1973 Australia's concerns {{saw it as a}} champion and an early adopter of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and around this time, the Government ratified the Seabed <b>Arms</b> <b>Control</b> Treaty. Shortly after this, the Government negotiated with the International Atomic Energy Agency to put in safeguards to ensure Australia could mine and export nuclear material but not breach the intent of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time as the early nuclear <b>arms</b> <b>control</b> work, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Nathan F. Twining, sent a memorandum, in August 1959, to the Secretary of Defense, Neil McElroy, which {{suggested}} that the Strategic Air Command (SAC) formally be assigned responsibility to prepare the national nuclear target list, and a single plan for nuclear operations. Up to that point, the Army, Navy, and Air Force had done their own target planning. This had led to the same objectives being targeted multiple times by the different services. The separate service plans were not mutually supporting as in, for example, the Navy destroying an air defense facility on the route of an Air Force bomber going to a deeper target. While Twining had sent the memo to McElroy, the members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff disagreed on the policy during early 1960. Thomas Gates, who succeeded McElroy, asked President Dwight D. Eisenhower to decide the policy.|$|E

5|$|Kennedy easily {{defeated}} Republican businessman Ray Shamie to win {{re-election in}} 1982. Senate leaders granted him {{a seat on}} the Armed Services Committee, while allowing him to keep his other major seats despite the traditional limit of two such seats. Kennedy became very visible in opposing aspects of the foreign policy of the Reagan administration, including U.S. intervention in the Salvadoran Civil War and U.S. support for the Contras in Nicaragua, and in opposing Reagan-supported weapons systems, including the B-1 bomber, the MX missile, and the Strategic Defense Initiative. Kennedy became the Senate's leading advocate for a nuclear freeze and was a critic of Reagan's confrontational policies toward the Soviet Union. A 1983 memorandum from KGB chairman Viktor Chebrikov to general secretary Yuri Andropov noted this stance and asserted that Kennedy, through former Senator John Tunney's discussions with Soviet contacts, had suggested that U.S.-Soviet relations might be improved if Kennedy and Andropov could meet in person to discuss <b>arms</b> <b>control</b> issues and if top Soviet officials, via Kennedy's help, were able to address the American public through the U.S. news media. Andropov was unimpressed by the idea.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy {{staged a}} tiring, dangerous, and {{high-profile}} trip to South Africa in January 1985. He defied both the apartheid government's wishes and militant leftist AZAPO demonstrators by spending {{a night in}} the Soweto home of Bishop Desmond Tutu and also visited Winnie Mandela, wife of imprisoned black leader Nelson Mandela. Upon returning, Kennedy became {{a leader in the}} push for economic sanctions against South Africa; collaborating with Senator Lowell Weicker, he secured Senate passage, and the overriding of Reagan's veto, of the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986. Despite their many political differences, Kennedy and Reagan had a good personal relationship, and with the administration's approval Kennedy traveled to the Soviet Union in 1986 to act as a go-between in <b>arms</b> <b>control</b> negotiations with reformist Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. The discussions were productive, and Kennedy also helped gain the release of a number of Soviet Jewish refuseniks, including Anatoly Shcharansky.|$|E
5|$|To help {{drive his}} points, Curtis uses {{interviews}} with various political and intellectual figures. In {{the first two}} parts, former <b>Arms</b> <b>Control</b> and Disarmament Agency member Anne Cahn and former American Spectator writer David Brock accuse the neoconservatives of knowingly using false evidence of wrongdoing in their campaigns against the Soviet Union and President Bill Clinton.
