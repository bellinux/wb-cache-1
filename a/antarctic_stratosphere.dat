40|$|The {{formation}} rate of sulfuric-acid-water aerosol particles is calculated {{as a function}} of altitude for the conditions of the winter Arctic and <b>Antarctic</b> <b>stratospheres.</b> The theoretical results indicate that sulfate particle formation can occur in the polar winter stratosphere. Conditions for new particle formation are increasingly favorable as the altitude increases between 20 and 30 km because of the decrease in surface area of preexisting particles and increasing sulfuric-acid vapor supply. The theoretical predictions are consistent with observations of a high-altitude CN layer over Antarctica in the spring.

The freezing of stratospheric aerosols would be important for the nucleation of nitric acid trihydrate particles in the Arctic and <b>Antarctic</b> <b>stratospheres.</b> In addition, the rate of heterogeneous chemical reactions on stratospheric aerosols may be very sensitive to their state. The calculations indicate that homogeneous freezing nucleation of pure water ice in the stratospheric solution droplets would occur at temperatures below about 192 K. However, the physical properties of H 2 SO 4 solution at such low temperatures are not well known, and it is possible that sulfuric acid aerosols will freeze out at temperatures ranging from about 180 to 195 K.

The polar stratospheric clouds in Antarctica are only formed when there are very low temperatures, as low as −80°C, and early spring conditions.

40|$|Interannual {{variations}} of the zonal mean temperature in the <b>Antarctic</b> lower <b>stratosphere</b> are analyzed {{for the past six}} years from 1980 to 1985 by using NMC data. It is found that the <b>Antarctic</b> polar <b>stratosphere</b> tends to cool not only in spring but also in all seasons, remarkably in the polar region. The analysis of the meridional gradient of the zonal mean temperature shows such an interesting feature that the period of temperature decrease toward the pole in winter has become longer and longer in recent years in accord with the Antarctic ozone depletion. From these evidences, the interrelation between the temperature decline and the ozone depletion is considered as follows : Slight cooling induced by the effect of increasing CO_ 2 can form the polar stratospheric clouds, and more clouds are formed by its radiative cooling effect. Hence, enhanced cooling in the polar region can induce the ozone depletion due to less poleward transport of ozone by planetary waves, which become less active in the polar region due to trapping by long-persistent strong westerlies...|$|R

40|$|The annual {{variations}} of ozone near the tropopause {{are derived from}} aircraft exhibit year-to-year differences which are not explicitly {{accounted for by the}} simple, classical ozone transport theory. Phenomena such as tropopause lifting, interannual variations in the rates of stratospheric-tropospheric exchange and meridional mixing, contribute differently to the distribution of ozone in this altitude region. Ozone encounter climatologies have been represented by global maps which show the probabilities of exceeding ambient ozone levels of 200, 300, and 400 ppbV along flight routes during the year. Continuous ozone records obtained from the GASP system revealed the presence of gravity waves whose wavelength is of the order 20 km. The GASP data cannot, however, be utilized for the evaluation of horizontal fluxes of such quantities as ozone, sensible heat, and zonal momentum; the data are too sparsely and irregularly distributed for the computation of stable correlations. Multiple species data from the unique circumglobal flight of a Pan American airliner on 28 - 30 October 1977 are discussed with particular regard to the apparent interhemispheric differences in tropospheric species concentrations, variation between the Arctic and <b>Antarctic</b> <b>stratospheres,</b> to possible covariations between species, and to potential source regions for various constituents...|$|R

40|$|Studies {{of middle}} {{atmospheric}} dynamics under the PPB project have two aspects. On one hand, they {{are necessary to}} predict a feasibility of PPB flight. Recent studies on global-scale disturbances (planetary waves) over the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>stratosphere</b> suggest that the mid-summer (December-January) flight at 30 - 40 km altitudes has a trajectory with meridional fluctuations with ± 2 ° around the initial latitude. The mid-winter (June-August) flight in the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>stratosphere</b> may be much circumpolar than that in the Arctic. The spring (October-November) and autumn (February) flights are not adequate for circumpolar observations. We predict that the north-south drift due to small-scale disturbances (gravity waves) may be within ± 0. 3 °, although this must be confirmed in the future. On the other hand, trajectory analysis and balloon-borne anemometry of PPB would give us useful information for studying the transport process and the gravity-wave effect in the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>stratosphere...</b>|$|E

Even though POAM data are available at only one latitude in the southern hemisphere on each day, their assimilation leads to more realistic ozone distribution throughout the Antarctic region, especially inside the polar vortex. Impacts of POAM data were evaluated by comparisons of assimilated ozone profiles with independent ozone sondes. Major improvements in ozone representation are seen in the <b>Antarctic</b> lower <b>stratosphere</b> during austral Winter and spring in 1998.

A similar ozone increase is produced in a chemistry climate model that allows feedback between constituent changes and the stratospheric circulation through radiative heating. A simulation that excludes the radiative coupling between predicted ozone and the circulation does not capture this ozone increase.

40|$|A {{new type}} of EI Nino event has been {{identified}} in the last decade. During "warm pool" EI Nino (WPEN) events, sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the central equatorial Pacific are warmer than average. The EI Nino signal propagates poleward and upward as large-scale atmospheric waves, causing unusual weather patterns and warming the polar stratosphere. In austral summer, observations show that the <b>Antarctic</b> lower <b>stratosphere</b> is several degrees (K) warmer during WPEN events than during the neutral phase of EI Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Furthermore, the stratospheric response to WPEN events depends of the direction of tropical stratospheric winds: the Antarctic warming is largest when WPEN events are coincident with westward winds in the tropical lower and middle stratosphere i. e., the westward phase of the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO). Westward winds are associated with enhanced convection in the subtropics, and with increased poleward wave activity. In this paper, a new formulation of the Goddard Earth Observing System Chemistry-Climate Model, Version 2 (GEOS V 2 CCM) is used to substantiate the observed stratospheric response to WPEN events. One simulation is driven by SSTs typical of a WPEN event, while another simulation is driven by ENSO neutral SSTs; both represent a present-day climate. Differences between the two simulations can be directly attributed to the anomalous WPEN SSTs. During WPEN events, relative to ENSO neutral, the model simulates the observed increase in poleward planetary wave activity in the South Pacific during austral spring, {{as well as the}} relative warming of the <b>Antarctic</b> lower <b>stratosphere</b> in austral summer. However, the modeled response to WPEN does not depend on the phase of the QBO. The modeled tropical wind oscillation does not extend far enough into the lower stratosphere and upper troposphere, likely explaining the model's insensitivity to the phase of the QBO during WPEN events...|$|R

The analysis suggests that the apparent springtime cleansing of the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>stratosphere</b> is the result of aerosol redistribution through subsidence of the polar vortex air mass and sedimentation of large polar stratospheric cloud particles.

The heterogeneous chemistry of these species together with ClONO 2 has been implicated in the ozone depletion observed in the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>stratosphere</b> during the spring {{in the last eight}} years. The most plausible chemical mechanism involves the removal of nitrogen oxide species via condensation on ice particles in polar stratospheric clouds resulting in a increase in the active chlorine species responsible for the ozone depletion.

40|$|Dehydration in the <b>Antarctic</b> winter <b>stratosphere</b> is a {{well-known}} phenomenon that is annually observed by satellites and occasionally observed by balloon-borne measurements. However, in situ measurements of dehydrated air masses in the Antarctic vortex are very rare. Here, we present detailed observations with the in situ and GLORIA remote sensing instrument payload aboard the German aircraft HALO. Strongly dehydrated air masses down to 1. 6 ppmv of water vapor were observed {{as far north as}} 47 ° S in an altitude between 12 and 13 km in the lowermost stratosphere. The dehydration {{can be traced back to}} individual ice formation events above the Antarctic Peninsula and Plateau, where ice crystals sedimented out and water vapor was irreversibly removed. Within these dehydrated stratospheric air masses, filaments of moister air reaching down to the tropopause are detected with the high-resolution limb sounder, GLORIA. Furthermore, dehydrated air masses are observed with GLORIA in the <b>Antarctic</b> lowermost <b>stratosphere</b> down to 7 km. With the help of a backward trajectory analysis, a midlatitude origin of the moist filaments in the vortex can be identified, while the dry air masses down to 7 km have stratospheric origins. Antarctic stratosphere–troposphere exchange (STE) and transport of dehydrated air masses into the troposphere are investigated. Further, it is shown that the exchange process can be attributed to several successive Rossby wave events in combination with an isentropic exchange of air masses across the thermal tropopause. The transport into the troposphere is caused by air masses that are detached from the potential vorticity (PV) structure by Rossby wave breaking events and subsequently transported diabatically across the dynamical tropopause. Once transported to the troposphere, air masses with stratospheric origin can reach near-surface levels within several days...|$|R

The computed effects of the PSCs on temperatures depend strongly on the surface temperature and on the extent of tropospheric cloudiness, and range from a maximum increase of 6 K for a high amount of PSCs over a warm surface and clear troposphere to a maximum decrease of 2 K for a high amount of PSCs over a cold surface and a troposphere with high clouds.

40|$|The {{nature of}} the Arctic polar {{stratosphere}} is observed to be similar in many respects {{to that of the}} <b>Antarctic</b> polar <b>stratosphere,</b> where an ozone hole has been identified. Most of the available chlorine (CHl and ClONO 2) was converted by reactions on polar stratospheric clouds to reactive ClO and Cl 2 O 2 thoroughout the Arctic polar vortex before midwinter. Reactive nitrogen was converted to HNO 3, and some, with spatial inhomogeneity, fell out of the stratosphere. These chemical changes ensured characteristic ozone losses of 10 to 15 percent at altitudes inside the polar vortex where polar stratospheric clouds had occurred. These local losses can translate into 5 to 8 percent losses in the vertical column abundance of ozone. As the amount of stratospheric chlorine inevitably increases by 50 percent over the next two decades, ozone losses recognizable as an ozone hole may well appear...|$|R

Heterogeneous reactions on ice surfaces could be important in the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>stratosphere.</b> These reactions are thought to convert ClONO 2 and N 2 O 5 into HNO 3 in the solid phase while Cl 2, HOCl, and ClNO 2 are released into the stratosphere as gas-phase products.

The observed mixing ratios are also much less than those predicted by global-scale models of stratospheric chemistry and dynamics. As the NO 2 signal remained very weak when McMurdo was {{at the edges of}} the ozone hole and showed no signs of recovering during October, it is concluded that the geographical and temporal extent of the region of low NO 2 is comparable to or greater than that of the ozone hole.

It is suggested that the evaporation of the clouds, in late August and September, will release HOCl and HNO 3 to the environment. This could be followed by the photodissociation of HOCl to OH and Cl, which would very effectively destroy ozone. However, the ozone destruction mechanism could be halted when enough of the evaporated nitric acid is photolized...|$|R
