5|$|Despite the {{nomenclature}} of Diet (Assembly or Parliament), {{this institution}} should {{in no way}} be construed as a broadly, or popularly, elected group of representatives. Many of the states did not have constitutions, and those that did, such as the Duchy of Baden, based suffrage on strict property requirements which effectively limited suffrage to {{a small portion of}} the male population. Furthermore, this impractical solution did not reflect the new status of Prussia in the overall scheme. Although the Prussian army had been dramatically defeated in the 1806 Battle of Jena-Auerstedt, it had made a spectacular comeback at Waterloo. Consequently, Prussian leaders expected to play <b>a</b> <b>pivotal</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> German politics.|$|E

40|$|It has {{recently}} become evident {{that at least}} five ceramidase (CDase) isoforms are present in human epidermis, and that specifically acidic CDase (aCDase) and alkaline CDase (alkCDase) activities increase during keratinocyte differentiation, and thus might play <b>a</b> <b>pivotal</b> <b>role(s)</b> <b>in</b> permeability barrier function. Prior to investigating their possible <b>roles</b> <b>in</b> the epidermal barrier function, {{it is necessary to}} characterize basic kinetic parameters for these enzymes, as well as {{to determine the effects of}} the established CDase inhibitors and their activities. In this study, assays for both aCDase and alkCDase activities in fully differentiated human epidermis were optimized using a radiolabeled substrate. These studies revealed that aCDase activity is substantially higher than alkCDase activity, and that both isoenzymes are inhibited by a CDase inhibitor N-oleylethanolamine. These findings were also confirmed using an in situ enzyme assay. Copyright © 2007 S. Karger AG...|$|R
