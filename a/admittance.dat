40|$|Abstract — We {{propose a}} realizable RCLK-in-RCLK-out {{parasitic}} re-duction technique. The method employs generalized Y- transformation. In our method, <b>admittances</b> {{are kept in}} their original rational forms of, and their orders are reduced by truncating high-order terms. Therefore reduced <b>admittances</b> match the low-order terms in exact <b>admittances.</b> First-order realization of <b>admittances</b> is guaranteed, and higher-order realization is achieved by template optimization using Geometric Programming. The algorithm uniquely uses common-factor identification and cancelation operations to make Y- transformation numerically stable. The experiment shows that our method can achieve higher reduction ratio than TICER and comparable simulation results with PRIMA...|$|R

5|$|Alexander Stuart, an Army {{captain who}} served as the last {{governor}} of the castle, stripped down what remained of the fortification in the mid-1700s. Some of the stone was reused to build the Bowling Green House – later renamed the Castle Inn – on {{the north end of the}} tennis courts, while the north side of the outer bailey was used to make the bowling green itself. Stuart lived in a house in Ludlow itself, but decorated the Great Hall with the remains of the castle armoury, and may have charged visitors for <b>admittance.</b>|$|E

5|$|Scott {{returned}} to Hollywood and Graham; Zelda {{returned to}} the hospital. She nonetheless made progress in Asheville, and in March 1940, four years after <b>admittance,</b> she was released. She was nearing forty now, her friends were long gone, and the Fitzgeralds no longer had much money. Scott was increasingly embittered by his own failures and his old friend Hemingway's continued success. They wrote each other frequently until Scott's death in December 1940. Zelda was unable to attend his funeral in Rockville, Maryland.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the bark}} {{functions}} as a protective barrier, it is itself attacked by boring insects such as beetles. These lay their eggs in crevices and the larvae chew {{their way through the}} cellulose tissues leaving a gallery of tunnels. This may allow fungal spores to gain <b>admittance</b> and attack the tree. Dutch elm disease is caused by a fungus (Ophiostoma species) carried from one elm tree to another by various beetles. The tree reacts to the growth of the fungus by blocking off the xylem tissue carrying sap upwards and the branch above, and eventually the whole tree, is deprived of nourishment and dies. In Britain in the 1990s, 25 million elm trees were killed by this disease.|$|E

5|$|Corder {{was taken}} back to Suffolk where he was tried at Shire Hall, Bury St Edmunds. The trial started on 7 August 1828, having been put back several days because of the {{interest}} which the case had generated. The hotels in Bury St Edmunds began to fill up from as early as 21 July, and <b>admittance</b> to the court was by ticket {{only because of the}} large numbers who wanted to view the trial. Despite this, the judge and court officials still had to push their way bodily through the crowds that had gathered around the door.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his artistic}} talents, Kim's main {{interest}} was medicine, and {{he applied for}} entrance into medical school upon graduation {{from high school in}} 1940. When he failed to gain <b>admittance,</b> Kim moved to Japan, planning to study and save up money to reapply for medical school. The theater and cinema grew into lifetime interests at this time. Kim often went to Kyoto, where he attended many stage productions and saw many international films. Josef von Sternberg's Morocco (1930) and Fritz Lang's M (1931) made a particularly strong impression on him, and their influence was to show in his mature film style.|$|E
5|$|Francis J. Underwood {{was born}} on November 5, 1959, to Catherine and Calvin T. Underwood in Gaffney, South Carolina. He is an only child. He was raised in impoverished circumstances, {{with the threat of}} bank {{foreclosure}} on the farm they lived on. He entered The Sentinel, a military school in Charleston, South Carolina, loosely based on The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina, in the fall of 1976. He graduated in 1981 and, despite having made poor grades, gained <b>admittance</b> into Harvard Law School. He graduated from there in 1984. While at the Sentinel, he had a homosexual relationship with his roommate, Tim Corbet, which lasted until his first year of law school. Underwood was raised Christian but holds God in complete contempt.|$|E
30|$|The {{sequence}} <b>admittances</b> of a three-phase VSC {{are independent}} of each other when it is operating under normal conditions. However, {{the positive and negative}} sequence harmonic components will be coupled with each other if three-phase grid-connected converter is running with unbalanced grid voltages. This is mainly caused by the negative sequence voltage at the fundamental frequency. This paper proposes a step-by-step modeling method to calculate the matrix of positive and negative sequence <b>admittances</b> of three-phase grid-connected converters under unbalanced grid voltage conditions, based on the method of harmonic linearization. The calculated <b>admittances</b> agree with simulated results within 1.07 dB of magnitude and 2.56 ° of phase, and can be easily applied in stability analysis.|$|R
40|$|From a {{background}} of RC interconnect models in layout-to-circuit extraction, this paper compares two realizable model reduction methodologies based on generalized Y# transformation.

During the Y# transformation, common factors in the numerator and denominator are identified and cancelled. The rational form of the <b>admittances</b> allows realization through e. g. Brune synthesis. The second method represents <b>admittances</b> through a moments expansion up to a user-defined order. It also allows synthesis after a Pade matching step. In that sense, the methods are equivalent. Nevertheless, a comparison shows that the former performs better in the frequency domain...|$|R

5|$|In Anglophone countries, Heathen {{groups are}} {{typically}} called kindreds or hearths, or alternately sometimes as fellowships, tribes, or garths. These are small groups, often family units, and usually consist of {{between five and}} fifteen members. They are often bound together by oaths of loyalty, with strict screening procedures regulating the <b>admittance</b> of new members. Prospective members may undergo a probationary period before they are fully accepted and welcomed into the group, while other groups remain closed to all new members. Heathen groups are largely independent and autonomous, although they typically network with other Heathen groups, particularly in their region. There are other followers of the religion who are not affiliated with such groups, operating as solitary practitioners, with these individuals often remaining in contact with other practitioners through social media.|$|E

These <b>admittances</b> are needed in (1) stability analyses of rocket motors and gas turbine combustors; (2) for the evaluation of 'driving' capabilities of injectors; and (3) for checking the applicability of a theoretical model. The modified standing-wave technique was used to determine the <b>admittances</b> of the combustion processes in coaxial injectors utilizing air-acetylene mixtures. The measurements indicated that (1) coaxial injectors can sustain combustion instabilities over wide frequency ranges; (2) the maximum driving capability of an injector decreases with an increased equivalence ratio; (3) the frequency at which maximum driving is observed decreases with the increased equivalence ratio; and (4) the characteristic combustion time of an injector design decreases with increased frequency...|$|R
