40|$|The {{process and}} {{mechanism}} of zinc electrode shape change is investigated with the radiotracer technique. It is shownthat during repeated cycling of the nickel oxide/zinc battery zinc material is transported over the zinc electrode via the battery electrolyte. During charge {{as well as}} <b>during</b> <b>discharge</b> zinc material is transported over the electrode. The direction ofthe zinc material transport during charge is opposite its direction <b>during</b> <b>discharge.</b> The amount of zinc material displacedover the electrode during charge is smaller than <b>during</b> <b>discharge,</b> so that after one charge-discharge cycle the net zinc material transport is observed in the direction as found <b>during</b> <b>discharge.</b> A new model for shape change is presented: thedensity gradient model. The model {{is based on the}} occurrence of an electrolyte flow during repeated charge-discharge cycling of the zinc secondary battery, which transports zinc material over the electrode. During battery cycling this electrolyte flow arises as a result of density gradients in the solution layer adjacent to the zinc electrode and of volume variationsof the battery electrolyte...|$|R

50|$|The {{first step}} {{involves}} {{looking for a}} suitable location to glacier growing. The preferred terrain, according to glacier growers in Baltistan and Gilgit, is in shadowed scree-slopes overlooked by steep headwalls. Commonly the sites are located between 4,000-5,000 metres above sea level. Such locations are susceptible to snowfall and <b>avalanches</b> <b>during</b> winter and spring, creating an environment conducive to the accumulation of ice.|$|R
