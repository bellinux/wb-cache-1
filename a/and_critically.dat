5|$|Cannon Fodder 3 is an action-strategy PC game {{developed}} and published – originally in Russia – by Game Factory Interactive (GFI), along with developer Burut CT. The game {{is the second}} sequel to Cannon Fodder, a commercially <b>and</b> <b>critically</b> successful game released for multiple formats in 1993. Jon Hare and his company Sensible Software, the developers of Cannon Fodder and its prior sequel, were uninvolved with Cannon Fodder 3. GFI instead licensed the intellectual property from now-owner Codemasters.|$|E
5|$|Chaplin {{was nervous}} about the film's {{reception}} because silent films were becoming obsolete by then, and the preview had undermined his confidence. Nevertheless, City Lights became one of Chaplin's most financially successful <b>and</b> <b>critically</b> acclaimed works. Following the good reception by American audiences, with earnings of $2 million, a quarter of which came from its 12-week run at the Cohan, Chaplin went on a sixteen-date world tour between February and March 1932, starting with a premiere at London's Dominion Theatre on February 27. The film was enthusiastically received by Depression-era audiences, earning $5 million during its initial release.|$|E

Dissidia was well received commercially <b>and</b> <b>critically,</b> with positive reviews and sales of over 1.8 million.

5|$|From the {{perspective}} of the Canadian 1st Army, the battle is remembered for its tactical and strategic miscalculations — the most notable being a highly controversial attack by the Royal Highland Regiment (Black Watch) of Canada on 25 July.

5|$|In August 2014, Van der Sloot was {{transferred}} to Challapalca prison in the mountainous South of Peru, where circumstances are harsh due to the location's altitude.

Although Van der Sloot's wife's claim of a stabbing is contested by Peruvian authorities, photos have been published showing Van der Sloot as suffering from multiple stab wounds from two separate attacks.|$|E

5|$|The Smashing Pumpkins {{broke into}} the musical {{mainstream}} with their second album, 1993's Siamese Dream. The group built its audience with extensive touring and their 1995 follow-up, the double album Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, which debuted at {{number one on the}} Billboard 200 album chart. With 21million albums sold in the United States alone, The Smashing Pumpkins were one of the most commercially successful <b>and</b> <b>critically</b> acclaimed bands of the 1990s. However, internal fighting, drug use, and diminishing record sales led to a 2000 break-up.|$|E

5|$|The {{success of}} The Quatermass Experiment led to two sequels, Quatermass II (1955) and Quatermass and the Pit (1958–59), both {{produced}} {{and directed by}} Cartier and written by Kneale. Both were successful <b>and</b> <b>critically</b> acclaimed, and Cartier's production work on them became increasingly ambitious. For Quatermass II, he pre-filmed {{a significant amount of}} material on location, using 35mm film, opening the drama out from a confined studio setting with the most ambitious location shooting yet attempted in British television. Cartier, with his previous experience as a film director, particularly enjoyed working on these cinema-style filmed scenes.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being well}} {{received}} by fans <b>and</b> <b>critically</b> acclaimed and nominated in 1983 for a BAFTA and Golden Globe as best original score, {{and the promise}} of a soundtrack album from Polydor Records in the end titles of the film, the release of the official soundtrack recording was delayed for over a decade. There are two official releases of the music from Blade Runner. In light of the lack of a release of an album, the New American Orchestra recorded an orchestral adaptation in 1982 which bore little resemblance to the original. Some of the film tracks would, in 1989, surface on the compilation Vangelis: Themes, but not until the 1992 release of the Director's Cut version would a substantial amount of the film's score see commercial release.|$|E

5|$|Despite initial doubts by Nintendo's American staff, Donkey Kong succeeded commercially <b>and</b> <b>critically</b> in North America and Japan. Nintendo {{licensed}} {{the game}} to Coleco, who developed home console versions for numerous platforms. Other companies cloned Nintendo's hit and avoided royalties altogether. Miyamoto's characters appeared on cereal boxes, television cartoons, {{and dozens of other}} places. A lawsuit brought on by Universal City Studios, alleging Donkey Kong violated their trademark of King Kong, ultimately failed. The success of Donkey Kong and Nintendo's victory in the courtroom helped to position the company for video game market dominance from its release in 1981 until the late 1990s (1996–1999).|$|E
5|$|Etty's Cleopatra's Arrival in Cilicia, {{painted in}} 1821, {{featured}} numerous nudes and was exhibited to great acclaim. Its success prompted several further depictions of historical scenes with nudes. All {{but one of}} the works he exhibited at the Royal Academy in the 1820s contained at least one nude figure, and he acquired a reputation for indecency. Despite this, he was commercially successful <b>and</b> <b>critically</b> acclaimed, and in 1828 was elected a Royal Academician, at the time the highest honour available to an artist. Although {{he was one of the}} most respected artists in the country he continued to study at life classes throughout his life, a practice considered inappropriate by his fellow artists. In the 1830s Etty began to branch out into the more lucrative but less respected field of portraiture, and later became the first English painter to paint significant still lifes. He continued to paint both male and female nudes, which caused severe criticism and condemnation from some elements of the press.|$|E
