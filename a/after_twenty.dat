5|$|<b>After</b> <b>twenty</b> {{years of}} career struggles and obscurity, Thelonious Monk {{had become a}} jazz star with a {{residency}} at the Five Spot Café in New York City's East Village. In his first stable job in years, he helped transform the small bar {{into one of the}} city's most popular venues, as it attracted bohemians, hipsters, and devout fans of Monk's music. His employment there was a result of an appeal by his manager Harry Colomby to the State Liquor Authority (SLA) to restore Monk's cabaret card. Monk was stripped of the card in 1951 when he was convicted of narcotics possession; he had refused to betray his friend and pianist Bud Powell to the police after they discovered Powell's glassine envelope of heroin laying beside Monk's feet in the car of Powell's female companion.|$|E

5|$|The essay {{begins by}} declaring that anarchists had {{correctly}} resisted the war from its inception, {{and that the}} authors would prefer a peace brought about by an international conference of European workers. It then submits that German workers would most likely also favor such a conclusion to the war, and presents several reasons why {{it would be in}} their best interest to call for an armistice. These reasons were that the citizens, <b>after</b> <b>twenty</b> months of war, would understand that they had been deceived into believing they were taking part in a defensive war; that they would recognize that the German state had long prepared for such a conflict, and as such it would be inevitably at fault; that the German Empire could not logistically support an occupation of the territory it had captured; and that the individuals living in the occupied territories were free to choose whether or not they would like to be annexed.|$|E
