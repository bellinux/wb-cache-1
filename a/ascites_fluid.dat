40|$|Hybridomas {{secreting}} monoclonal antibodies (MABs) specific for Clostridium perfringens type A enterotoxin {{were produced}} by fusion of P 3 X 63 Ag 8. 653 myeloma cells with spleen cells from BALB/c mice immunized with purified enterotoxin. Wells containing hybridomas secreting immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against enterotoxin were specifically identified by an indirect {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA), and 10 ELISA-positive hybridomas were selected and cloned twice by limiting dilution. All 10 hybridomas produced MABs containing immunoglobulin G 1 heavy chains and kappa (kappa) light chains. These hybridomas were then grown as ascitic tumors in mice, and MABs were purified from the <b>ascites</b> <b>fluids</b> with DEAE Affi-gel blue. The specificity of the MABs for enterotoxin was demonstrated by immunoblotting and ELISA. Competitive radioimmunoassay with 125 I-MABs suggests that these MABs recognized at least four epitopes on the enterotoxin molecule. The enterotoxin-neutralizing ability of MABs from both hybridoma culture supernatants and <b>ascites</b> <b>fluids</b> was assessed by using a 3 H-nucleotide-release Vero (African green monkey kidney) cell assay. Only 2 of the 10 hybridomas produced MABs which completely (greater than 90 %) neutralized the biologic activity of enterotoxin. Preincubation of 125 I-enterotoxin with MABs demonstrated that MAB neutralizing ability correlated with MAB-specific inhibition of specific binding of enterotoxin to intestinal brush border membranes...|$|R

25|$|Anti-gliadin {{antibodies}} can {{be generated}} in mice or rabbits by immunizing whole purified gliadins, proteolytic fragments of gliadin, or synthetic peptides that represent epitopes of gliadin. After developing an immune response, B-cells from mice can be fused with immortalizing cells to form a hybridoma that produces monoclonal antibodies (Mab or MoAb). Mab can be expressed in culture or via <b>ascites</b> <b>fluid</b> production to produce large amounts of a single antibody isoform.|$|E
25|$|After obtaining {{either a}} medi{{a sample of}} cultured hybridomas or a sample of <b>ascites</b> <b>fluid,</b> the desired {{antibodies}} must be extracted.

In both cases, other secretions by the hybridomas such as cytokines may be present. There may also be bacterial contamination and, as a result, endotoxins that are secreted by the bacteria. Depending on the complexity of the media required in cell culture and thus the contaminants, one or the other method (in vivo or in vitro) may be preferable.|$|E
25|$|Congestive heart failure* is {{the result}} of any severe, {{overwhelming}} heart disease that most commonly results in pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs), pleural effusion (fluid around the lungs), and/or <b>ascites</b> (<b>fluid</b> in the abdomen). It can be caused by the above two diseases, congenital heart defects such as patent ductus arteriosus, pulmonary hypertension, heartworm (Dirofilaria immitis) disease, or pericardial effusion. Signs depend on which side of the heart is affected. Left-sided heart failure results in rapid and/or difficulty breathing and sometimes coughing from a build-up of fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema). Right-sided heart failure results in a large liver (congestion) and build-up of fluid in the abdomen (ascites), uncommonly fluid around the lungs (pleural effusion), or, rarely, peripheral edema.|$|E

25|$|A {{physical}} examination, {{including a}} pelvic examination, and a pelvic ultrasound (transvaginal or otherwise) are both essential for diagnosis: physical examination may reveal increased abdominal girth and/or <b>ascites</b> (<b>fluid</b> within the abdominal cavity), while pelvic examination may reveal an ovarian or abdominal mass. An adnexal mass {{is a significant}} finding that often indicates ovarian cancer, especially if it is fixed, nodular, irregular, solid, and/or bilateral. 13–21% of adnexal masses are caused by malignancy; however, there are other benign causes of adnexal masses, including ovarian follicular cyst, leiomyoma, endometriosis, ectopic pregnancy, hydrosalpinx, tuboovarian abscess, ovarian torsion, dermoid cyst, cystadenoma (serous or mucinous), diverticular or appendiceal abscess, nerve sheath tumor, pelvic kidney, ureteral or bladder diverticulum, benign cystic mesothelioma of the peritoneum, peritoneal tuberculosis, or paraovarian cyst. Ovaries that can be felt are also a sign of ovarian cancer in postmenopausal women. Other parts of a physical examination for suspected ovarian cancer can include a breast examination and a digital rectal exam. Palpation of the supraclavicular, axillary, and inguinal lymph nodes may reveal lymphadenopathy, which can be indicative of metastasis. Another indicator may be {{the presence of a}} pleural effusion, which can be noted on auscultation.|$|E
500|$|Certain {{precipitants}} of HRS {{have been}} identified in vulnerable individuals with cirrhosis or fulminant liver failure. These include bacterial infection, acute alcoholic hepatitis, or bleeding in the upper gastrointestinal tract. [...] Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, which is the infection of <b>ascites</b> <b>fluid,</b> is the most common precipitant of HRS in cirrhotic individuals. [...] HRS can sometimes be triggered by treatments for complications of liver disease: iatrogenic precipitants of HRS include the aggressive use of diuretic medications or the removal of large volumes of ascitic fluid by paracentesis from the abdominal cavity without compensating for fluid losses by intravenous replacement.|$|E
40|$|The binding of antimoesin {{antibodies}} from <b>ascites</b> <b>fluids</b> to {{the surfaces}} of human and rodent cells was found to parallel the level of CD 46 expression. No such reactivity was detected with a purified antimoesin antibody which recognized intracellular moesin. In Western blots, antimoesin antibodies were found to react with solubilized CD 46 and a recombinant soluble form of CD 46. Antimoesin antibodies also reacted with CD 46 /CD 4 molecules containing only the SCR I and II domains required for measles virus (MV) hemagglutinin binding onto CD 46. We suggest that the weak cross-reactivity of antimoesin antibodies with CD 46 explains the inhibitory effect of these antibodies on MV entry and that moesin is not directly involved in MV binding...|$|R
30|$|Biological pentameric CRP (pCRP) was {{purified}} {{from human}} pleural or <b>ascites</b> <b>fluids</b> using calcium-dependent affinity chromatography to phosphorylcholine-substituted agarose resin essentially as described (Potempa et al. 1987).

500|$|HRS {{can affect}} {{individuals}} with cirrhosis, severe alcoholic hepatitis, or liver failure, and usually occurs when liver function deteriorates rapidly {{because of a}} sudden insult such as an infection, bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract, or overuse of diuretic medications. [...] HRS is a relatively common complication of cirrhosis, occurring in 18% of people within one year of their diagnosis, and in 39% within five years of their diagnosis. Deteriorating liver function is believed to cause changes in the circulation that supplies the intestines, altering blood flow and blood vessel tone in the kidneys. The kidney failure of HRS {{is a consequence of}} these changes in blood flow, rather than direct damage to the kidney. The diagnosis of hepatorenal syndrome is based on laboratory tests of individuals susceptible to the condition. [...] Two forms of hepatorenal syndrome have been defined: Type 1 HRS entails a rapidly progressive decline in kidney function, while type 2 HRS is associated with <b>ascites</b> (<b>fluid</b> accumulation in the abdomen) that does not improve with standard diuretic medications.|$|E
500|$|The risk {{of death}} in hepatorenal {{syndrome}} is very high; consequently, {{there is a significant}} emphasis on the identification of patients who are at risk for HRS, and prevention of triggers for onset of HRS. [...] As infection (specifically spontaneous bacterial peritonitis) and gastrointestinal hemorrhage are both complications in individuals with cirrhosis, and are common triggers for HRS, specific care is made in early identification and treatment of cirrhotics with these complications [...] to prevent HRS. [...] Some of the triggers for HRS are induced by treatment of ascites and can be preventable. [...] The aggressive use of diuretic medications should be avoided. [...] In addition, many medications that are either used to treat cirrhotic complications (such as some antibiotics) or other conditions may cause sufficient impairment in kidney function in the cirrhotic to lead to HRS. [...] Also, large volume paracentesis—which is the removal of <b>ascites</b> <b>fluid</b> from the abdomen using a needle or catheter in order to relieve discomfort—may cause enough alteration in hemodynamics to precipitate HRS, and should be avoided in individuals at risk. [...] The concomitant infusion of albumin can avert the circulatory dysfunction that occurs after large-volume paracentesis and may prevent HRS. [...] Conversely, in individuals with very tense ascites, it has been hypothesized that removal of ascitic fluid may improve kidney function if it decreases the pressure on the renal veins.|$|E
