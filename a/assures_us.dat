2500|$|Hans Turley {{looks to}} the {{literary}} evidence of Pirates, and in particular Captain Avery, when drawing {{the conclusion of the}} pirate as the [...] "antihero." [...] Avery's story became the stuff of legend to the masses, and the [...] "fictional exaggeration" [...] of Avery cemented {{in the minds of the}} readers the image of a brute bent on theft, ransom, and power. [...] Turley <b>assures</b> <b>us</b> that the stories were lifted beyond the realm of reality but it is impossible to know for sure who the real Captain Avery was, and it was legitimate to believe the stories due to the lack of any evidence to the contrary.|$|E
2500|$|The {{motion of}} a charged {{body in a}} {{magnetic}} field, B involves the velocity through the Lorentz force term v'B, and might seem at first to be asymmetric under T. A closer look <b>assures</b> <b>us</b> that B also changes sign under time reversal. This happens because a magnetic field is produced by an electric current, J, which reverses sign under T. Thus, the motion of classical charged particles in electromagnetic fields is also time reversal invariant. [...] (Despite this, it is still useful to consider the time-reversal non-invariance in a local sense when the external field is held fixed, as when the magneto-optic effect is analyzed. [...] This allows one to analyze {{the conditions under which}} optical phenomena that locally break time-reversal, such as Faraday isolators and , can occur.) [...] The laws of gravity also seem to be time reversal invariant in classical mechanics.|$|E
2500|$|In 1802 the Edgeworths {{toured the}} English midlands. They then {{travelled}} to the continent, first to Brussels {{and then to}} Consulate France (during the Peace of Amiens, a brief lull in the Napoleonic Wars). They met all the notables, and Maria received a marriage proposal from a Swedish courtier, Count Edelcrantz. Her letter on the subject seems very cool, but her stepmother <b>assures</b> <b>us</b> in the Augustus Hare Life and Letters that Maria loved him very much and did not get over the affair quickly. [...] They came home to Ireland in 1803 {{on the eve of}} the resumption of the wars and Maria returned to writing. Tales of Fashionable Life, The Absentee and Ormond are novels of Irish life. Edgeworth was an extremely popular author who was compared with her contemporary writers Jane Austen and Sir Walter Scott. She initially earned more than them, and used her income to help her siblings.|$|E

2500|$|Nour's Viața Basarabiei {{represented}} the legalist {{side of the}} Bessarabian emancipation movement, to the irritation of more radical Romanian nationalists. Cazacu recalls: [...] "Although moderate, the atmosphere was so stuffed, the hardships so great, the attacks of {{the right and the}} left so relentless, that in a short while [...] also succumbed, not without having had its useful effect in the awakening of national sentiment, even among the Moldavians in various parts of Russia, in the Caucasus, and in Siberia." [...] A nationalist historian, Nicolae Iorga, accused Nour of promoting [...] "class fraternity" [...] between the Russians and the Romanians in Bessarabia, citing Nour's explicit rejection of the Russian Revolution. Nour enlisted other negative comments from Iorga when he began writing Bessarabian notices in the Romanian daily Adevărul, which had Jewish proprietors. Iorga, an antisemite, commented: [...] "Mr. Alexe Nour of Chișinău <b>assures</b> <b>us</b> now that his new gazette [...] will not be a philosemitic one". According to Iorga, Nour was given reason to [...] "feel sorry" [...] about the Adevărul collaboration.|$|E
2500|$|Machiavelli {{explains}} {{repeatedly that}} religion is man-made, and {{that the value of}} religion lies in its contribution to social order and the rules of morality must be dispensed with if security requires it. In The Prince, the Discourses, and in the Life of Castruccio Castracani, he describes [...] "prophets", as he calls them, like Moses, Romulus, Cyrus the Great, and Theseus (he treated pagan and Christian patriarchs in the same way) as the greatest of new princes, the glorious and brutal founders of the most novel innovations in politics, and men whom Machiavelli <b>assures</b> <b>us</b> have always used a large amount of armed force and murder against their own people. He estimated that these sects last from 1,666 to 3,000 years each time, which, as pointed out by Leo Strauss, would mean that Christianity became due to start finishing about 150 years after Machiavelli. Machiavelli's concern with Christianity as a sect was that it makes men weak and inactive, delivering politics into the hands of cruel and wicked men without a fight.|$|E
2500|$|In this definition, for {{the sake}} of {{conceptual}} rigour, the quantity of energy transferred as heat is not specified directly in terms of the non-adiabatic process. It is defined through knowledge of precisely two variables, the change of internal energy and the amount of adiabatic work done, for the combined process of change from the reference state [...] to the arbitrary state [...] It is important that this does not explicitly involve the amount of energy transferred in the non-adiabatic component of the combined process. It is assumed here that the amount of energy required to pass from state [...] to state , the change of internal energy, is known, independently of the combined process, by a determination through a purely adiabatic process, like that for the determination of the internal energy of state [...] above. The rigour that is prized in this definition is that there is one and only one kind of energy transfer admitted as fundamental: energy transferred as work. Energy transfer as heat is considered as a derived quantity. The uniqueness of work in this scheme is considered to guarantee rigor and purity of conception. The conceptual purity of this definition, based on the concept of energy transferred as work as an ideal notion, relies on the idea that some frictionless and otherwise non-dissipative processes of energy transfer can be realized in physical actuality. The second law of thermodynamics, on the other hand, <b>assures</b> <b>us</b> that such processes are not found in nature.|$|E

2500|$|In a 2004 {{interview}} (published 9 December), Flew, then 81 years old, {{said that}} he had become a deist. In the article Flew states that he has renounced his long-standing espousal of atheism by endorsing a deism of the sort that Thomas Jefferson advocated ("While reason, mainly in the form of arguments to design, <b>assures</b> <b>us</b> that there is a God, there is no room either for any supernatural revelation of that God or for any transactions between that God and individual human beings"). [...] Flew stated that [...] "the most impressive arguments for God’s existence are those that are supported by recent scientific discoveries" [...] and that [...] "the argument to Intelligent Design is enormously stronger than it was when I first met it". The argument of ID is that evidenced objects and physical concepts are either too simple or too complex to be simply natural, which ever of the two extremes one chooses to be the hallmark of design by an outside intelligence. He also answered in the affirmative to Habermas's question, [...] "So of the major theistic arguments, such as the cosmological, teleological, moral, and ontological, the only really impressive ones that you take to be decisive are the scientific forms of teleology?". He supported the idea of an Aristotelian God with [...] "the characteristics of power and also intelligence", stating that the evidence for it was stronger than ever before. He rejected the idea of an afterlife, of God as the source of good (he explicitly states that God has created [...] "a lot of" [...] evil), and of the resurrection of Jesus as a historical fact, although he has allowed a short chapter arguing in favor of Joshua's/Jesus' resurrection to be added into his latest book.|$|E
