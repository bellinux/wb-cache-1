For she had not the slightest confidence in the power of her influence, whatever Peregrine might say and sincerely believe at present. If there were, more palpably than with all other human beings, angels of good and evil contending for him, swaying him now this way and now that; it was plain from his whole history that nothing had yet availed to keep him under the better influence for long together; and she believed that if he gained herself by these unjust and cruel means the worse spirit would thereby gain the most <b>absolute</b> <b>advantage.</b> If her heart had been free, and she could have loved him, she might have hoped, though {{it would have been a}} wild and forlorn hope; but as it was, she had never entirely surmounted a repulsion from him, as something strange and unnatural, a feeling involving fear, though here he was her only hope and protector, and an utter uncertainty as to what he might do.

40|$|It {{is widely}} known that first movers in any {{industry}} have <b>absolute</b> <b>advantages,</b> which are {{mainly caused by}} barriers to entry. However, the advent of Internet, which now {{is the center of}} economy and business, poses a significant counterargument. That is, Internet-related markets are almost free of an entry barrier as they become complete information markets. As a result, existing companies hardly have an upper hand in the competition. The survival rate of those start-ups, however, is fairly low. This indicates that entry barriers do exist in the Internet-related business as well as in other markets. The paper mainly deals with two questions regarding market entry barriers to venture companies. First, do market entry barriers exist in the Internet-related business? Second, if any, what kind of entry barrier exercises a bigger influence on new comers? Bain (1956) identified three main sources of entry barriers: economies of scale, product differentiation <b>advantages,</b> and <b>absolute</b> cost <b>advantages.</b> Since then, many scholars have added a number of sources as entry barriers. Yet, most of the researchers didn't factor in the Internet, failing to disprove the argument that entry barriers are meaningless now that the Internet enables a perfect competition (Bakos 1997). Therefore this paper selectively presented what is deemed significant as entry barriers in the Internet busines...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{stresses}} {{the role of}} absolute productivities and <b>absolute</b> <b>advantages,</b> instead of relative productivities and comparative advantages, in {{the determination of the}} existence and pattern of international trade. It owes to the contribution of Brewer’s (1985) article, which follows an approach similar to that adopted by Parrinello (1970, 1973) and Metcalfe – Steedman (1973) to deal with the theory of international trade from a Sraffian perspective. We shall argue that a specific theoretical foundation rests behind the intuitive idea that national competitiveness can be a source of possible economic conflict among the national economies of a global economy. This conclusion contrasts with some distinguished views, according to which a national economy must possess a comparative advantage in some productive sector on the basis of an undisputed Ricardian principle. ...|$|R

50|$|This {{statement}} {{uses the}} concept of <b>absolute</b> <b>advantage</b> to present an argument in opposition to mercantilism, the dominant view surrounding trade at the time, which held that a country should aim to export more than it imports, and thus amass wealth. Instead, Smith argues, countries could gain from each producing exclusively the good(s) {{in which they are}} most suited to, trading between each other as required for the purposes of consumption. In this vein, it is not the value of exports relative to that of imports that is important, but the value of the goods produced by a nation. The concept of <b>absolute</b> <b>advantage</b> however does not address a situation where a country has no advantage in the production of a particular good or type of good.|$|E
50|$|This {{theoretical}} shortcoming {{was addressed}} by the theory of comparative advantage. Generally attributed to David Ricardo who expanded on it in his 1817 book On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation, it makes a case for free trade based not on <b>absolute</b> <b>advantage</b> in production of a good, but on the relative opportunity costs of production. A country should specialize in whatever good it can produce at the lowest cost, trading this good to buy other goods it requires for consumption. This allows for countries to benefit from trade {{even when they do}} not have an <b>absolute</b> <b>advantage</b> in any area of production. While their gains from trade might not be equal to those of a country more productive in all goods, they will still be better off economically from trade than they would be under a state of autarky.|$|E

The model allows for <b>absolute</b> and comparative <b>advantages</b> in the labor market and assumes that the population is composed of 8 unknown types. Overall, labor market skills (as opposed to taste for schooling) appear to be the prime factor explaining schooling attainments. The estimates indicate a higher cross-sectional variance in the returns to experience than in the returns to schooling. From various simulations, we find that the sub-population mostly affected by a counterfactual change in the utility of attending school is composed of individuals who have any combination of some of the following attributes: <b>absolute</b> <b>advantages</b> in the labor market, high returns to experience, low utility of attending school and relatively low returns to schooling.

40|$|Much of the {{research}} on the role of firm-specific advantages on firms' subsidiary ownership preferences has been undertaken in the context of advanced-country multinationals, specifically U. S. MNCs. Research has found that U. S. firms derive ownership advantages from their size, experience, and technological and marketing superiority. Perhaps having operated in the most-developed and sophisticated home market, many U. S. firms generate unique skills that give them <b>absolute</b> <b>advantages</b> over firms in almost all foreign host locations. Developing-country MNCs do not have <b>absolute</b> ownership <b>advantages</b> {{similar to those of the}} U. S. firms. The relevance of a particular firm-specific characteristic for a developing-country MNC may be contingent not only upon the home-country characteristics, as in the case of U. S. MNCs, but also upon host-country characteristics. This study investigates the subsidiary ownership preferences among Korean MNCS and finds that the influence of three firm-specific advantages—technological intensity, product differentiation and capital intensity—on subsidiary ownership levels is contingent upon whether the subsidiary is located in a relatively less-developed or a more-developed country as compared to the home country. Although some authors have suggested that the influence of firm-specific advantages may be contingent upon the characteristics of both home- and host-country locations, empirical investigations to this effect have been nonexistent. © 1997 JIBS.
