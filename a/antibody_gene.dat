5|$|Though {{the general}} {{structure}} of all antibodies is very similar, a small region {{at the tip}} of the protein is extremely variable, allowing millions of antibodies with slightly different tip structures, or antigen-binding sites, to exist. This region is known as the hypervariable region. Each of these variants can bind to a different antigen. This enormous diversity of antibody paratopes on the antigen-binding fragments allows the immune system to recognize an equally wide variety of antigens. The large and diverse population of antibody paratope is generated by random recombination events of a set of gene segments that encode different antigen-binding sites (or paratopes), followed by random mutations in this area of the <b>antibody</b> <b>gene,</b> which create further diversity. This recombinational process that produces clonal antibody paratope diversity is called V(D)J or VJ recombination. Basically, the antibody paratope is polygenic, made up of three genes, V, D, and J. Each paratope locus is also polymorphic, such that during antibody production, one allele of V, one of D, and one of J is chosen. These gene segments are then joined together using random genetic recombination to produce the paratope. The regions where the genes are randomly recombined together is the hyper variable region used to recognise different antigens on a clonal basis.|$|E

5000|$|Prognosis varies greatly {{depending}} on into which diagnostic group CLL falls. The {{two or three}} prognostic groups {{are based on the}} maturational state of the cell. This distinction is based on the maturity of the lymphocytes as discerned by the immunoglobulin variable-region heavy chain (IgVH) gene mutation status. [...] High-risk patients have an immature cell pattern with few mutations in the DNA in the IgVH <b>antibody</b> <b>gene</b> region, whereas low-risk patients show considerable mutations of the DNA in the <b>antibody</b> <b>gene</b> region indicating mature lymphocytes. Moreover, usage of specific subgenes (i.e. V3-21) for variable segment of immunoglobulin is a marker for more severe prognosis. It is believed that the structure of variable subgenes of Ig and the whole surface immunoglobulin determines the propensity of chronic or tonic BCR signalling in CLL. Additionally, the usage of certain variable segments (i.e. V2 family) is also connected to the activation of microRNA miR-650, which further influences the biology of CLL.|$|E

50|$|In the 1970s, Australian {{immunologist}} Edward J.

The mechanism involved the somatic selection and clonal amplification of newly acquired <b>antibody</b> <b>gene</b> sequences that were generated via somatic hypermutation in B-cells. The messenger RNA (mRNA) products of these somatically novel genes were captured by retroviruses endogenous to the B-cells and were then transported through the bloodstream where they could breach the soma-germ barrier and retrofect (reverse transcribe) the newly acquired genes into the cells of the germ line.|$|E
40|$|There is {{a plethora}} of {{different}} foreign substances (antigens) that the humoral immune system needs to recognize in order to sustain life.

50|$|SMUG1 is an {{important}} uracil-DNA glycosylases that process uracil in DNA. SMUG1 function is to remove U or its derivatives from DNA. SMUG1 is able to excise uracil from both single- and doubledstranded DNA. Other DNA glycosylases linked to U removal are UNG, TDG and MBD4. Uracil-DNA repair is essential to protect against mutations. Current evidence suggests that UNG and SMUG1 are the major enzymes responsible for the repair of the U:G mispairs. Uracil is also introduced into DNA as part of <b>antibody</b> <b>gene</b> diversification and its removal is critical to antibody diversification.

50|$|Tonegawa’s Nobel Prize work elucidated {{the genetic}} {{mechanism}} of the adaptive immune system, which had been the central question of immunology for over 100 years. Prior to Tonegawa’s discovery, one early idea to explain the adaptive immune system suggested that each gene produces one protein; however, there are under 19,000 genes {{in the human body}} which nonetheless can produce millions of antibodies. In experiments beginning in 1976, Tonegawa showed that genetic material rearranges itself to form millions of antibodies. Comparing the DNA of B cells (a type of white blood cell) in embryonic and adult mice, he observed that genes in the mature B cells of the adult mice are moved around, recombined, and deleted to form the diversity of the variable region of antibodies. In 1983, Tonegawa also discovered a transcriptional enhancer element associated with <b>antibody</b> <b>gene</b> complex, the first cellular enhancer element.|$|E
50|$|Terminal deoxynucleotidyl {{transferase}} (TdT), {{also known}} as DNA nucleotidylexotransferase (DNTT) or terminal transferase, is a specialized DNA polymerase expressed in immature, pre-B, pre-T lymphoid cells, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma cells. TdT adds N-nucleotides to the V, D, and J exons of the TCR and BCR genes during <b>antibody</b> <b>gene</b> recombination, enabling the phenomenon of junctional diversity. In humans, terminal transferase is encoded by the DNTT gene. As {{a member of the}} X family of DNA polymerase enzymes, it works in conjunction with polymerase λ and polymerase μ, both of which belong to the same X family of polymerase enzymes. The diversity introduced by TdT has {{played an important role in}} the evolution of the vertebrate immune system, significantly increasing the variety of antigen receptors that a cell is equipped with to fight pathogens. Studies using TdT knockout mice have found drastic reductions (10-fold) in T-cell receptor (TCR) diversity compared with that of normal, or wild-type, systems. The greater diversity of TCRs that an organism is equipped with leads to greater resistance to infection.|$|E

50|$|By {{the early}} 2000s, his focus changed, and still remains today, on {{molecular}} genetics of antibodies, <b>antibody</b> <b>gene</b> class-switch DNA recombination (CSR) and somatic hypermutation (SHM). Starting, his lab mounted a systematic effort {{to tackle the}} molecular mechanisms underpinning B cell differentiation in immunity, autoimmunity and lymphomagenesis, by addressing the stimuli and signals inducing CSR/SHM and Aicda expression. The findings in his experiments are fundamental in advancing research of the dysregulation of RAB7A, HOXC4 and AID by estrogen in lupus B cells, as derived from patients and lupus mouse models. However, his most recent work {{has been devoted to}} investigating the role of epigenetics, particularly, histone posttranslational modifications and non-coding RNAs, including microRNAs, in targeting and regulating the B cell CSR/SHM machinery and plasma cell differentiation. His investigations have found that HDAC (histone deacetylase) inhibitors (HDIs) specifically downregulate expression of AID and Blimp-1 (master transcription factor of plasma cell differentiation) by upregulating microRNAs that target Aicda or Prdm1 (encoding Blimp-1) 3’-UTR. These specific epigenetic changes effectively modulate CSR/SHM and antibody responses. They also blunt autoantibody responses in lupus-prone mice, thereby alleviating lupus immunopathology, and outline an important role of epigenetic modifications in the regulation of B cell differentiation in autoimmunity.|$|E

5000|$|Class {{switching}} occurs by {{a mechanism}} called class switch recombination (CSR) binding. Class switch recombination is a biological mechanism {{that allows the}} class of antibody produced by an activated B cell to change during {{a process known as}} isotype or class switching. During CSR, portions of the antibody heavy chain locus are removed from the chromosome, and the gene segments surrounding the deleted portion are rejoined to retain a functional <b>antibody</b> <b>gene</b> that produces antibody of a different isotype. Double-stranded breaks are generated in DNA at conserved nucleotide motifs, called switch (S) regions, which are upstream from gene segments that encode the constant regions of antibody heavy chains; these occur adjacent to all heavy chain constant region genes {{with the exception of the}} δ-chain. DNA is nicked and broken at two selected S-regions by the activity of a series of enzymes, including Activation-Induced (Cytidine) Deaminase (AID), uracil DNA glycosylase and apyrimidic/apurinic (AP)-endonucleases. The intervening DNA between the S-regions is subsequently deleted from the chromosome, removing unwanted μ or δ heavy chain constant region exons and allowing substitution of a γ, α or ε constant region gene segment. The free ends of the DNA are rejoined by a process called non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) to link the variable domain exon to the desired downstream constant domain exon of the antibody heavy chain. In the absence of non-homologous end joining, free ends of DNA may be rejoined by an alternative pathway biased toward microhomology joins. [...] With the exception of the μ and δ genes, only one antibody class is expressed by a B cell at any point in time.While class switch recombination is mostly a deletional process, rearranging a chromosome in [...] "cis", it can also occur (in 10 to 20% of cases, depending upon the Ig class) as an inter-chromosomal translocation mixing immunoglobulin heavy chain genes from both alleles.|$|E

50|$|Germinal centers or {{germinal}} centres (GCs) are sites within secondary lymphoid organs - {{lymph nodes}} and the spleen where mature B cells proliferate, differentiate, and mutate their <b>antibody</b> <b>genes</b> (through somatic hypermutation aimed at achieving higher affinity), and switch {{the class of}} their antibodies (for example from IgM to IgG) during a normal immune response to an infection.

5000|$|That {{mutations}} are unpredictable, faithfully replicated, {{and that}} natural selection operates only upon {{the products of}} chance is repeated {{at the start of}} chapter seven entitled [...] "Evolution". Monod states that the decisive factor in natural selection is not the [...] "struggle for life" [...] but is the differential rate of reproduction and the only mutations [...] "acceptable" [...] to an organism are those that [...] "do not lessen the coherence of the teleonomic apparatus, but rather, further strengthen it in its already assumed orientation" [...] (Monod, 119). Monod explains that the teleonomic performance is judged through natural selection and this system retains only a very small fraction of mutations that will perfect and enrich the teleonomic apparatus. Monod gives the example of antibody development to show how chance combinations can give a well defined solution. He states that the source of information for the antibodies associative structure is not the antigen itself but is instead the result of many random recombinations of part of the <b>antibody</b> <b>gene.</b> The antibody that is able to bind to the antigen is multiplied. This remarkable example shows chance as the basis {{for one of the most}} precise adaptation phenomena. Monod makes the point that selection of a mutation is due to the environmental surroundings of the organism and the teleonomic performances. He then gives some examples to show the interconnection of specific performances/behaviors and anatomical adaptations. The author spends the rest of the chapter discussing linguistic and physical human evolutionary development. Language is an utterly different from the various auditory, tactile, and visual forms of communication in that it allows the communication of an original personal association to another individual. Monod hypothesizes that language was not merely the product but one of the driving forces for the evolution of our central nervous system. He believes that rudimentary symbolic communication appeared early on and created a new selective pressure that favored development of linguistic ability and hence the brain. He then talks about the evolution of our ancestors including the development of upright posture which allowed them to become hunters. Monod lastly points out the evidence to suggest the development of the cognitive function of language in children depends upon postnatal growth of the cortex.|$|E
5000|$|Plasma {{cells are}} key {{effector}} {{elements of the}} adaptive immune system. They contribute to immunity by making antibodies that bind with and thereby initiate the process of neutralizing specific antigens that usually are found {{on the surface of}} invading pathogens and foreign substances. Plasma cells develop from B lymphocytes which are stimulated to undergo this maturational development by T lymphocytes during the latter cells' processing of these antigens. As they are stimulated to become plasma cells, B cells refashion parts of their genome in efforts to create a new gene that encodes a functional antibody. Antibodies are composed of two identical heavy chains, i.e. either mu (μ), gamma (γ), alpha (α), epsilon (ε), or delta (δ), and two identical light chains, either kappa (κ) or lambda (λ); there are five different classes of antibodies that are named based on their heavy chain content as IgM, IgG, IgA, IgE, or IgD, respectively. Formation of a this new gene requires B cells and/or their descendent plasma cells to make point mutations at a) the immunoglobulin heavy chain antigen-binding locus gene which is on the short arm of human chromosome 14 at position 32.33 (site notated as 14q32.33); b) the immunoglobulin light chain antigen binding locus gene which is on the short arm of chromosome 22 at position 11q.22; and c) other nearby sites. These mutations are made {{in an effort to make}} a gene encoding a protein that binds the instigating antigen. The next step in this new gene formation involves V(D)J recombinations and class switch recombinations, i.e. the deletion and subsequent recombination of various gene segments at the heavy chain locus so that the gene codes for either an IgM, IgG, IgA, IgE, or IgD antibody isotype. If these gene alterations are successful in coding for a functional antibody (Ig), the maturing B cells and to a greater extent their plasma cell descendants make and secrete an intact antibody, initially IgM but after class switch recombinations, either IgG, IgA, IgE, or IgD. However, the cited gene changes can go awry in plasma cells by, for example, placing a gene that ordinarily controls cell growth adjacent to the normally highly active <b>antibody</b> <b>gene</b> promotor thereby creating a cancer-causing oncogene or, more commonly, by forming extra chromosomes (see trisomy) or chromosomes that have deleted or repetitive sections, any of which such changes may promote malignancy in more complex and less well understood ways. These mutations lead to the uncontrolled overproduction of an IgG, IgA, IgE, or IgD antibody, a κ or λ light chain, or, very rarely, an α, γ, or μ heavy chain or fragments of these proteins. The overproduced immunoglobulins, termed myeloma proteins, commonly circulate in blood, may accumulate in urine, and are the hallmarks of plasma cell dyscrasias including their most malignant forms viz., multiple myeloma, light chain multiple myeloma, and plasma cell leukemia. IgG-secretory, IgA-secretory, and light-chain secretory multiple myeloma represent 52%, 21%, 1nd 16%, respectively, of all multiple myeloma cases; these myelomas are associated with various types of chromosomal aberrancies and mutations. IgD-secretory multiple myeloma occurs in only 1% to 2% of multiple myeloma cases and is commonly associated with somatic mutations in the IgV region. IgE-secretory multiple myeloma has been reported in <50 as of 2013 and is characteristically associated with translocations between the long (i.e. [...] "q") arms of chromosome 11 and 14, i.e. t(11;14)(q13;q32) translocations.|$|E
40|$|Recombinant {{monoclonal}} antibodies (mAbs) {{are one of}} today's {{most successful}} therapeutic classes in inflammatory diseases and oncology. A wider accessibility and implementation, however, is hampered by the high product cost and prolonged need for frequent administration. The surge in more effective mAb combination therapies further adds to the costs and risk of toxicity. To address these issues, <b>antibody</b> <b>gene</b> transfer seeks to administer to patients the mAb-encoding nucleotide sequence, rather than the mAb protein. This allows the body to produce its own medicine in a cost- and labor-effective manner, for a prolonged period of time. Expressed mAbs can be secreted systemically or locally, depending on the production site. The current review outlines the state of play and clinical prospects of <b>antibody</b> <b>gene</b> transfer, thereby highlighting recent innovations, opportunities and remaining hurdles. Different expression platforms and a multitude of administration sites have been pursued. Viral vector-mediated mAb expression thereby made the most significant strides. Therapeutic proof of concept has been demonstrated in mice and non-human primates, and intramuscular vectored mAb therapy is under clinical evaluation. However, viral vectors face limitations, particularly in terms of immunogenicity. In recent years, naked DNA has gained ground as an alternative.
