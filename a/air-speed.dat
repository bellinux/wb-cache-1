2500|$|Whilst {{loosely based}} upon the game of cricket, many aspects are improvised: the playing ground, the rules, the teams, and the equipment. Quite often there are no teams at all; the players take turns at batting and there is often no {{emphasis}} on actually scoring runs. The bat can be anything, {{as long as it}} can hit the ball and can be suitably held in the hands. However, usage of a bat is necessary. A ball is the other essential item. Tennis balls are often used {{due to the fact that}} they are less likely to inflict injuries than a cricket ball. They are also much cheaper and more readily available than a leather cricket ball and are easier to hit due to their slower <b>air-speed</b> and relative lightness. Tennis balls also bounce more than normal cricket balls, especially at low speeds. [...] Often a tennis ball will be heavily taped on one side to give the ball extra 'swing'. This is known as a 'swing ball'—swing balls may be made with: gaffer tape, electrical tape, plumbing tape or any other kind of tape available. The pitch can be any stretch of ground that is reasonably flat. The wicket may be any convenient object – a chair, a cardboard box, a set of long twigs or sticks, a rubbish bin, tree or a drawing on the wall. [...] Often, the wicket is by no means close to the official size, but it is used anyway. A wicket at the non-striker's end is generally a single stump if proper stumps are available and in the absence of larger objects may be just a hat or a shoe. [...] Its main purpose is to mark the bowler's crease, but can be instrumental when there are two batters and one may be run out. Games with relatively few players typically forgo the teams and innings format of professional cricket, opting instead for a batsmen-vs-everyone format.|$|E

5000|$|He started gliding after World War II and was {{a three-time}} winner (1948, 1949, 1953) of the Richard C. du Pont Memorial Trophy, awarded {{annually}} to the U.S. National Open Class Soaring Champion. In 1956, {{he became the first}} American pilot to become the World Soaring Champion. He invented a device that told pilots the best speed to fly a glider, depending on conditions and based on the glider's rate of sink at different <b>air-speeds.</b> Glider pilots still use the [...] "MacCready speed ring".|$|R
50|$|By {{measuring}} {{the rate of}} sink at various <b>air-speeds</b> a set of data can be accumulated and plotted on a graph. The points can be connected by a line known as the ‘polar curve’. Each type of glider has a unique polar curve. The curve can be significantly degraded with debris such as bugs, dirt, and rain on the wing. Published polar curves will often be shown for a clean wing {{in addition to a}} dirty wing with bug splats represented by small pieces of tape applied to {{the leading edge of the}} wing.|$|R

The approach considers kinematic constraints and trimmed flight performance limits of a fixed-wing UAV {{as well as}} local prevailing wind. The planner is capable to plan with multiple <b>air-speeds.</b> For this purpose, a 3 D-roadmap representing collision free flight corridors is created. Based on the 3 D-roadmap, a pseudo-dual graph, in which the path is planned, is created to introduce the aircraft specific constraints. The planned path is a progression of straight flight and turning flight segments. The time parametrized trajectories are super positioned of horizontal and vertical aircraft motion trajectories, described by trochoids in horizontal and 5 th degree polynomials in vertical direction. The approach is evaluated in simple and real world scenarios...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the issues}} related to {{formation}} flights, which requires to be still discussed, is the stability of formation flight in turns, where the aerodynamic conditions can be substantially different for outer vehicles due to varying bank angles. Therefore, this paper proposes a decentralized control algorithm based on a leader as the reference point for followers, i. e. other UAVs and two flocking behaviors responsible for local position control, i. e. cohesion and repulsion. But opposite to other research in this area, {{the structure of the}} formation becomes flexible (structure is being reshaped and bent according to actual turn radius of the leader. During turns the structure is bent basing on concentred circles with different radiuses corresponding to relative locations of vehicles in the structure.

5000|$|The origin for a polar {{curve is}} where the <b>air-speed</b> is zero and the sink rate is zero. In the first diagram a line has been drawn from the origin to the point with minimum sink. The slope of the line from the origin gives the glide angle, {{because it is the}} ratio of the {{distance}} along the airspeed axis to the distance along the sink rate axis. [...] A whole series of lines could be drawn from the origin to each of the data points, each line showing the glide angle for that speed. However the best glide angle is the line with the least slope. In the second diagram, the line has been drawn from the origin to the point representing the best glide ratio. The <b>air-speed</b> and sink rate at the best glide ratio can be read off the graph. Note that the best glide ratio is shallower than the glide ratio for minimum sink. All the other lines from the origin to the various data points would be steeper than the line of the best glide angle. Consequently, the line for the best glide angle will only just graze the polar curve, i.e. it is a tangent.|$|E
5000|$|The {{longer period}} mode, called the [...] "phugoid mode" [...] {{is the one}} {{in which there is a}} large-amplitude {{variation}} of <b>air-speed,</b> pitch angle, and altitude, but almost no angle-of-attack variation. The phugoid oscillation is really a slow interchange of kinetic energy (velocity) and potential energy (height) about some equilibrium energy level as the aircraft attempts to re-establish the equilibrium level-flight condition from which it had been disturbed. The motion is so slow that the effects of inertia forces and damping forces are very low. Although the damping is very weak, the period is so long that the pilot usually corrects for this motion without being aware that the oscillation even exists. Typically the period is 20-60 seconds. This oscillation can generally be controlled by the pilot.|$|E

When operating at maximum speed, the average floor area increased to 151. 0 ft^ 2. At 85 F, the average floor areas for the low speed and maximum speed tests were 31. 8 ft^ 2 and 55. 6 ft^ 2 respectively. The maximum on-center spacing recommended for the tested ceiling fan mounted at 8. 5 ft. above the floor, operating at maximum speed, and providing comfort at a room temperature of 82 F is 14 ft.; and at a temperature of 85 F, it is 9 ft. Future ceiling fans should be designed to create a both a larger main air plume and a larger comfort zone. The ceiling fan provided relatively high <b>air-speeds</b> throughout the largest floor area in the zone from the floor to the 24 in. height.

50|$|In his 1975 book Streckensegelflug (published in English in 1978 as Cross-Country Soaring by the Soaring Society of America), Helmut Reichmann {{describes}} a flight made by Ingo Renner in a Glasflügel H-301 Libelle glider over Tocumwal in Australia on 24 October 1974. On that day {{there was no}} wind at the surface, but above an inversion at 300 metres {{there was a strong}} wind of about 70 km/h (40 knots). Renner took a tow up to about 350 m from where he dived steeply downwind until he entered the still air; he then pulled a sharp 180-degree turn (with very high g) and climbed steeply back up again. On passing though the inversion he re-encountered the 70 km/h wind, this time as a head-wind. The additional <b>air-speed</b> that this provided enabled him to recover his original height. By repeating this maneuver he successfully maintained his height for around 20 minutes without the existence of ascending air, although he was drifting rapidly downwind. In later flights in a Pik 20 sailplane, he refined the technique so {{that he was able to}} eliminate the downwind drift and even make headway into the wind.|$|E

Toyota increased the compression ratio from 9.4:1 to 10.3:1. To correct the <b>air-speed</b> problems of the earlier generations, the intake ports in this cylinder head were re-designed to have a smaller cross-section, and hence it has been nicknamed the [...] "smallport" [...] head. This change in the intake ports negated {{the need for the}} earlier twin-runner intake manifold and it was replaced with a single-runner manifold. Additional engine modifications to extend life and reliability included under-piston cooling oil squirters, thicker connecting rods and other components. Also of note, the pistons were changed to accept a 20 mm fully floating gudgeon pin unlike the 18 mm pressed-in pins of the earlier versions. All non-U.S. market 4A-GEs continued to use a MAP sensor, while all of the U.S.-market 4A-GE engines came with a MAF sensor.
