40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this {{research}} was to analyse the effects of stand structure on biomass allocation and on the <b>accurancy</b> of estimation models for volume and aboveground biomass of Italian stone pine (Pinus pinea L.). Although the species is widely distributed on Mediterranean coasts, few studies on forest biomass estimation have focused on pinewoods. The research was carried out in the Castelfusano&# 8217;s pinewood (Rome) and concerned the two most common structural types: (a) 50 years-old pinewood originated by broadcast seeding; and (b) 62 years-old pinewood originated by partial seeding alternating worked strips to firm strips. Some 83 sample trees were selected for stem volume estimation and a subset of 32 trees used to quantify the total epigeous biomass, the wooden biomass compartment, including stem and big branches (diameter &# 62; 3 cm) and the photosynthetic biomass, including thin branches (diameter &# 60; 3 cm) and needles. Collected data were used to elaborate allometric relations for stem volume, total biomass and specific relations for both compartments, based on one (d 2) or two (d 2 h) indipendent variables, for both structural types. Furthermore, pinewood specific biomass expansion factors (BEF) - indexes used to estimate carbon stocks starting from stem biomass data - were obtained. The achieved estimation models were subjected to both parallelism and coincidence tests, showing significant effects of stand structure on the <b>accurancy</b> of the allometric relations. The effects of stand structure and reliability of tree height curves on the <b>accurancy</b> of estimation models for volume and aboveground biomass and on biomass allocation in different compartments are analysed and discussed...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThree-dimensional {{stacking}} technology {{promises to}} solve the interconnect bottleneck problem by using Through-Silicon-Vias (TSVs) to vertically connect tiers. However, manufacturing steps may lead to partly broken or incompletely filled TSVs that may degrade the performance and reduce the useful lifetime of a 3 D IC. These are latent defects that affect circuit performance and reliability in stacked ICs and can be modeled as small-delay defects (SDDs). Due to combinations of switching activity, supply noise and crosstalk, TSV delays can experience speed-up or slowdown that could let SDDs go undetected by conventional test methods. In this work, we present a metric based on probabilistic delay analysis to detect SDDs induced by resistive opens that occur on signal line TSVs.
