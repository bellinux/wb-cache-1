Jim rebukes Pam for listening to Roy when he is clearly wrong and acting selfish, which creates tension between them. Pam then tells the camera she is happy with her life now, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not even make her dream house in Scranton.

25|$|Furthermore, it {{is argued}} that the {{responsibility}} of learning should reside increasingly with the learner (Glasersfeld, 1989). Social constructivism thus emphasizes the importance of the learner being actively involved in the learning process, unlike previous educational viewpoints where the responsibility rested with the instructor to teach and where the learner played a passive, receptive role. Von Glasersfeld (1989) emphasized that learners construct their own understanding <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not simply mirror and reflect what they read. Learners look for meaning and will try to find regularity and order in the events of the world {{even in the absence of}} full or complete information.|$|E

500|$|From 1996, {{the website}} of the Colchester tourist board {{attributed}} {{the origin of}} the rhyme to a cannon recorded as used from the church of St Mary-at-the-Wall by the Royalist defenders in the siege of 1648. In 1648, Colchester was a walled town with a castle and several churches and was protected by the city wall. The story given was that a large cannon, which the website claimed was colloquially called Humpty Dumpty, was strategically placed on the wall. A shot from a Parliamentary cannon succeeded in damaging the wall beneath Humpty Dumpty which caused the cannon to tumble to the ground. The Royalists (or Cavaliers, [...] "all the King's men") attempted to raise Humpty Dumpty on {{to another part of the}} wall, but the cannon was so heavy that [...] "All the King's horses and all the King's men couldn't put Humpty together again". Author Albert Jack claimed in his 2008 book Pop Goes the Weasel: The Secret Meanings of Nursery Rhymes that there were two other verses supporting this claim. Elsewhere, he claimed to have found them in an [...] "old dusty library, [...] an even older book", but did not state what the book was or where it was found. It has been pointed out that the two additional verses are not in the style of the seventeenth century or of the existing rhyme, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not fit with the earliest printed versions of the rhyme, which do not mention horses and men.|$|E

2500|$|Women {{should wait}} {{a few years after}} they first have {{intercourse}} before they start screening, and should not be screened before age 21. American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and others recommend starting screening at age 21 (since that is a few years after initial sex for most American women). [...] Many other countries wait until age 25 or later to start screening. For instance, some parts of Great Britain start screening at age 25. ACOG's general recommendation is that people with uteruses age 30–65 have an annual well-woman examination, that they not get annual Pap tests, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> get Pap tests at three-year intervals.|$|E

2500|$|The Watch Tower Society {{has stated}} that its early leaders {{promoted}} [...] "incomplete, even inaccurate concepts". The Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses says that, unlike Old Testament prophets, its interpretations of the Bible are not inspired or infallible. Witness publications say that Bible prophecies can be fully understood only after their fulfillment, citing examples of biblical figures who {{did not understand the}} meaning of prophecies they received. Watch Tower publications often cite Proverbs 4:18, [...] "The path of the righteous ones is like the bright light that is getting lighter and lighter until the day is firmly established" [...] (NWT) to support their view that there would be an increase in knowledge during [...] "the time of the end", as mentioned in Daniel 12:4. Jehovah's Witnesses state that this increase in knowledge needs adjustments. Watch Tower publications also say that unfulfilled expectations are partly due to eagerness for God's Kingdom <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not call their core beliefs into question.|$|E
2500|$|Much later, in 1768, an Italian {{priest and}} {{scientist}} Lazzaro Spallanzani proved experimentally that heat killed bacteria, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not reappear if {{the product is}} hermetically sealed. In 1795, a Parisian chef and confectioner named Nicolas Appert began experimenting with ways to preserve foodstuffs, succeeding with soups, vegetables, juices, dairy products, jellies, jams, and syrups. He placed the food in glass jars, sealed them with cork and sealing wax and placed them in boiling water. In that same year, the French military offered a cash prize of 12,000 francs for a new method to preserve food. [...] After some 14 or 15 years of experimenting, Appert submitted his invention and won the prize in January 1810. Later that year, Appert published L'Art de conserver les substances animales et végétales (or The Art of Preserving Animal and Vegetable Substances). This was the first cookbook of its kind on modern food preservation methods.|$|E
2500|$|Bahá'u'lláh {{stated that}} the {{observance}} of the laws that he prescribed {{should be subject to}} [...] "tact and wisdom", <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not cause [...] "disturbance and dissension." [...] Bahá'u'lláh thus provided for the progressive application of his laws; for example certain Bahá'í laws are only applicable to Middle Eastern Bahá'ís such as the limit to the period of engagement, while any Bahá'í may practice the laws if they so decide. Other Bahá'í laws such as the prohibition to drink alcohol have also been applied gradually in countries where it goes against social norms, and for which most Bahá'ís are new to the religion. Shoghi Effendi also stated that certain other laws, such as criminal laws, that are dependent upon the existence of a predominantly Bahá'í society would only be applicable in a possible future Bahá'í society. [...] He also stated that if the laws were in conflict with the civil law of the country where a Bahá'í [...] lives the laws could not be practiced. Furthermore some laws and teachings are, according to Bahá'í teaching, not meant to be applied at the present time and their application depends on decisions by the Universal House of Justice.|$|E

2500|$|Su Shi's trial {{lasted for}} 4 months, {{starting}} {{in the summer of}} 1079: he was accused of writing or allowing writings to circulate that the government might consider to be treasonously derogatory to the person of the emperor or to the state, which were considered to be basically equivalent. The charges were of [...] "denouncing the imperial chariot" [...] (Murck, 49) and of [...] "great irreverence toward the emperor" [...] (Murck, 49): conviction carried a mandatory death penalty by beheading, according to the statutory Song penal code, although this had never yet been applied (Murck, 49). Among the evidence were poems by Su Shi (also known as [...] "Master Dongpo"). Su Shi defended himself, denying accusations, or explaining how the lines of his poems really referred to the results of the actions of corrupt ministers, which according to ancient tradition it was incumbent as a duty of a loyal official to point out. In his trial, Su Shi confessed to such things as comparing the attachment of unscrupulous officials to their salaries with an owl's attachment to eating a rotten rat (Murck, 76). According to Alfreda Murck (92), in a further confession, this time regarding the interpretation of a poem that he had written {{on the occasion of the}} banishment of Zeng Gong to serve in a remote government posting, Su Shi admitted: [...] "This criticizes indirectly that many unfeeling men have recently been employed at Court, that their opinions are narrow-minded and make a raucous din like the sound of cicadas, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not deserve to be heard." [...] However, he omitted to enlighten the court upon his use in this poem of matched rhymes from Du Fu's [...] "Autumn Day in Kui Prefecture", or the added meanings which could then be derived from his poem (Murck, 92). In the end, Su Shi was convicted. The failure of the court to notice the extended meanings derivable by comparison of his rhymes with Du Fu's was apparent (to those in the know), and Su Shi and others, such as Wang Shen, having learned a way to avoid censorial persecution while still being able to express themselves to each other would continue to employ and expand upon this rhyme-matching, in conjunction with similarly coded painting.|$|E
