25|$|Steve Waugh (94 not out) {{continued}} his good {{work the next}} morning, adding another 59 with the tail, but were <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>disappointed</b> not to post a bigger total. The England innings got off to an inauspicious start with Stewart forced to retired hurt after he received {{a blow to the}} hand from McDermott. Atherton (44) was again the early linchpin, adding 30 with Hick and another 79 with Thorpe (51), before the former was given out caught behind decision by Steve Randell, Atherton was adjudged leg before to Warne, and Thorpe was given out caught at silly point off the same bowler. England collapsed from 119/1 to 151/6 in short order, and then from 185/6 to 212 all out, with McDermott (3–72) and Warne (6–64) the main wicket-takers.|$|E
500|$|In 1987, he {{was chosen}} to captain the England B team in a match against the full {{national}} team of Malta, but {{it was to be}} his only appearance in an England shirt, and he has subsequently been described {{as one of the best}} defenders of his era never to be selected for the full England team. Bruce later stated, [...] "I bumped into former England manager Bobby Robson in Benfica (sic). He came up to me and said 'I should have capped you'. It was nice to hear but it still didn't get me one .... I'll always be <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>disappointed</b> I didn't get one." ...|$|E
500|$|In January 2006, Cates {{announced}} that actor, comedian, and {{talk show host}} Jon Stewart, who had previously hosted two consecutive Grammy Awards ceremonies in 2001 and 2002, was chosen as host of the 2006 telecast. Cates explained the decision to hire him saying, [...] "My wife and I watch him every night. Jon {{is the epitome of}} a perfect host — smart, engaging, irreverent and funny." [...] In a statement, Stewart expressed that he was honored to be selected to emcee the program, jokingly adding, [...] "Although, as an avid watcher of the Oscars, I can't help but be <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>disappointed</b> with the choice. It appears to be another sad attempt to smoke out Billy Crystal." ...|$|E

25|$|During his {{period with}} Northamptonshire he twice toured the West Indies; in 1910-11 and 1912-13. In 1910-11 he {{was second in}} the {{tourists}} first class batting averages and led their bowling averages, while 1912-13 his batting was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>disappointing</b> {{but he was still}} second in the tourists' bowling averages.|$|R
500|$|He is lent a {{house by}} the Sultan, who offers him tea and cakes but asks him to teach him to make maps and {{to give him a}} gun and a milking goat, [...] "all of which {{requests}} I evaded as skilfully as I was able". His servant Ali shoots a new bird of paradise, Wallace's standardwing, [...] "a great prize" [...] and a [...] "striking novelty". He is <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>disappointed</b> in the range of insects and birds, but discovers new species of roller, sunbird and is happy to see the racquet-tailed kingfisher. His house is burgled twice; a blacksmith manages to pick his locks and make him a new set of keys; and he discovers a new species of birdwing butterfly.|$|E
500|$|For the {{knockout}} stages, England's first opponents were Argentina. Ramsey again {{showed his}} tactical awareness, and, {{now he was}} no longer using wingers, he decided to switch from 4–3–3 to 4–4–2. With Ball and Peters operating on the flanks, the midfield now boasted Nobby Stiles and Bobby Charlton in the centre. After a violent quarter-final (where the Argentine captain Antonio Rattín refused to leave the field after being sent off), England won 1–0 thanks to Geoff Hurst latching onto a cross from Martin Peters and heading home a goal. Ramsey came under fire when he stopped his players swapping shirts with the Argentinians in protest at their play and was then reported to have described Argentinian players as [...] "animals"; [...] "It seemed a pity so much Argentinian talent is wasted. Our best football will come against the right type of opposition—a team who come to play football, and not act as animals." [...] Jimmy Greaves in his 2009 autobiography, [...] "Greavsie", claims that Ramsey had said [...] "I've been <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>disappointed</b> that the behaviour of some players in this competition reminded me of animals". The belief that he had referred directly to the Argentinians as animals damaged Ramsey's reputation and made successive England teams unpopular abroad, particularly in South America.|$|E
2500|$|Donna Bowman of The A.V. Club {{rated the}} episode with a grade B−. She calls [...] "the {{structure}} familiar in outline, {{but just the}} slightest bit shoddy in execution" [...] and is <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>disappointed</b> by the good episode {{because it is not}} at the same high level {{as the rest of the}} season.|$|E

5000|$|In his Allmusic review, critic Jim Smith {{wrote of}} the album [...] "There is some {{exceptional}} flatpicking here, but even the more manic passages are tempered by a softness that is striking, and perhaps even <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>disappointing,</b> in its modesty. Once the listener gets past the desire to hear hardcore chops, though, the album reveals its full beauty..." ...|$|R

And yet accuracy is surely the touchstone of all Art.|$|R
2500|$|In 2001, Bob Costas {{claimed that}} despite still loving the game, he now felt a certain {{alienation}} from the institution. By {{the time that}} NBC lost Major League Baseball {{for the second time}} in twelve years, the sport endured a strike, realignment, the introduction of the wild card round, and NBC's complete loss of the regular season Game of the Week. Costas would add that since NBC only did a few games each year and he lacked the forum that he would eventually have (on HBO's On the Record with Bob Costas, Inside the NFL and Costas Now as well as Costas on the Radio) to express his views, he to some extent, started editorializing in games. When asked about whether or not the fact that NBC no longer had the baseball rights was disappointing, Bob Costas said [...] "I'm <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>disappointed</b> to lose baseball, but that's the way the business is. And it's not nearly as disappointing as it was when we lost it at the end of the '80s. Because then it was like baseball was the birthright for NBC. ... (Baseball is) not going to affect any decision that I have in the future. It's nowhere near as devastating as a decade ago. Different circumstances, different time. I miss it a little bit but not a lot. I am very philosophical about this stuff. I have had wonderful opportunities in my career and no one wants to hear me complain about anything." [...] In 2009, Costas would become a contributor and occasional play-by-play announcer for MLB Network.|$|E

5000|$|However, Tony Rayns {{felt that}} the film's climax was uninspired, saying that [...] "the generic pay off is <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>disappointing</b> after the edgy, {{character}} based scenes of exposition". Empires Trevor Lewis questioned the skill of the film's inexperienced cast, saying that they [...] "lack the dramatic ballast to compensate for Nolan's erratic plot elisions."

50|$|Even if {{the result}} of Vicenza was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>disappointing</b> for VPPE, it led to an awkward {{federation}} with Christian Democracy and Liga Fronte Veneto. The pact between the three parties, which could become a major political actor in Veneto, was signed in October 2007 by Giorgio Carollo, Raffaele Grazia, Giuseppe Pizza and Fabrizio Comencini. Following this agreement, Carollo became leader of the Christian Democracy in the northeast, while Grazia received the mandate of coordinator of the coalition for Veneto. However, the coalition was soon disbanded.|$|R

40|$|When observing average NMR signals {{originated}} from a rapid equilibrium, the procedure {{to estimate the}} composition of the mixture is to use interpolation. To illustrate the difficulties of this approach, the much-studied case of the NH and OH tautomers of pyrazolinones will be reexamined. Calculated absolute shieldings and coupling constants were compared with experimental data. Although the large predominance of the OH tautomer in DMSO was confirmed, the result is <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>disappointing</b> because no consistency in the percentages was achieved using chemical shifts and coupling constants. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.
