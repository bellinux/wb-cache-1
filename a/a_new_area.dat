5|$|A {{railroad}} {{was being}} built {{and the population}} of Quorn hoped that it would go through the village {{on its way to}} Sioux City, Iowa. However, the railroad did not go through Quorn. One of the many ideas about why the railroad took a different route was due to a disagreement between the Chicago and North Western Transportation Company and the Close brothers. The actual reason is still unknown. Due to the railroad being the main mode of transportation of goods, the villagers {{had no choice but to}} relocate to <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>area.</b> Every business except for a mill was moved to <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>area</b> during 1883.|$|E

5|$|An area of low {{pressure}} tracked across southeastern Canada during the 12th, which brought an arctic front across the Mid Atlantic region {{late on the}} 12th. As this occurred, a strong area of high pressure located across central Canada built down into the Northeast, allowing very cold air to spill southward ultimately leading to what is known as cold air damming. This occurs east of the mountains down through the Mid Atlantic states. Meanwhile, a Pacific storm slammed onto the California coast during the 11th and as it moved eastward, <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>area</b> of {{low pressure}} developed across southeastern Colorado and the Texas Panhandle.|$|E

5|$|Aphids {{and other}} hemipteran insects secrete a sweet liquid called {{honeydew}}, when they feed on plant sap. The sugars in honeydew are a high-energy food source, which many ant species collect. In some cases, the aphids secrete the honeydew {{in response to}} ants tapping them with their antennae. The ants in turn keep predators away from the aphids and will move them from one feeding location to another. When migrating to <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>area,</b> many colonies will take the aphids with them, to ensure a continued supply of honeydew. Ants also tend mealybugs to harvest their honeydew. Mealybugs may become a serious pest of pineapples if ants are present to protect mealybugs from their natural enemies.|$|E
5|$|As of 20April 1942, {{operational}} {{authority over}} all RAAF combat infrastructure, including area commands, was {{invested in the}} newly established Allied Air Forces (AAF) Headquarters under South West Pacific Area Command (SWPA). On 15May, Southern Area, which by then was considered too large, yielded responsibility for operational and maintenance units within New South Wales to <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>area</b> command, Eastern Area. Control of maintenance units under Southern Area {{was transferred to the}} newly established No.4 (Maintenance) Group in Melbourne on 14September. September also saw the formation of RAAF Command, led by Air Vice Marshal Bill Bostock, to oversee the majority of Australian flying units in the SWPA. Bostock exercised control of air operations through the area commands, although RAAF Headquarters continued to hold overarching administrative authority over Australian units.|$|E
5|$|Because he was {{painting}} fresco, the plaster was laid {{in a new}} section every day, called a giornata. At {{the beginning of each}} session, the edges would be scraped away and <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>area</b> laid down. The edges between giornate remain slightly visible; thus, they give a good idea of how the work progressed. It was customary for fresco painters to use a full-sized detailed drawing, a cartoon, to transfer a design onto a plaster surface—many frescoes show little holes made with a stiletto, outlining the figures. Here Michelangelo broke with convention; once confident the intonaco had been well applied, he drew directly onto the ceiling. His energetic sweeping outlines can be seen scraped into some of the surfaces, while on others a grid is evident, indicating that he enlarged directly onto the ceiling from a small drawing.|$|E

5|$|Cane toads pose {{a serious}} threat to native species when {{introduced}} to a new ecosystem. Classified as an invasive species in over 20 countries, there are multiple reports of the cane toad moving into <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>area</b> to be followed by a decline in the biodiversity in that region. The most documented region of the cane toad's invasion and subsequent effect on native species is Australia, where multiple surveys and observations of the toad's conquest have been completed. The best way to illustrate this effect is through the plight of the northern quoll, as well as Mertens' water monitor, a large lizard native to South and Southeast Asia.|$|E
5|$|Central Area was disbanded in August 1941 and its {{responsibilities}} divided between Southern Area, Northern Area, {{and the newly}} formed No.2 (Training) Group. The outbreak of the Pacific War resulted in Northern Area being split in January 1942 into North-Western and North-Eastern Areas, to counter separate Japanese threats to Northern Australia and New Guinea. Southern Area was also considered appropriate for division owing to its size, so the Australian Air Board proposed assigning responsibility for operational and maintenance units within New South Wales to <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>area</b> command, Eastern Area, which would also assume control of units in southern Queensland from North-Eastern Area.|$|E
5|$|Controversy has {{continued}} {{in recent years}} with the demolition of the 1930s Churchill House, a neo-Georgian municipal building originally housing the Electricity Board, {{to make way for}} the new Bath Bus Station. This was part of the Southgate redevelopment begun in 2007 in which the central 1960s shopping precinct, bus station, and multi-story carpark were demolished and replaced with <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>area</b> of mock-Georgian shopping streets. As a result of the changes the city's status as a World Heritage Site was reviewed by UNESCO in 2009. The decision was made to let Bath keep its status, but UNESCO has asked to be consulted on future phases of the Riverside development, saying that the density and volume of buildings in the second and third phases of the development need to be reconsidered. It also says that Bath must do more to attract world-class architecture to any new developments.|$|E

5|$|Initially, Hurricane Iris was {{forecast}} {{to remain}} a tropical cyclone while crossing Central America and to re-intensify in the eastern Pacific Ocean; had it done so, it would have retained the name Iris. Instead, the hurricane rapidly weakened after moving into the mountainous terrain of Guatemala, and within six hours of landfall the hurricane weakened to a tropical storm. Late on October9, within sixteen hours of landfall, the circulation dissipated over extreme southeastern Mexico. As the remnants approached the Pacific Ocean, <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>area</b> of convection developed south of the original circulation of Iris. It gradually organized while continuing westward, developing into Tropical Storm Manuel; the new storm ultimately lasted until October18 before succumbing to cooler waters and wind shear.|$|E

Malaya turned on the two battleships and closed to , well within the range of the Germans' guns, but Lütjens refused to be drawn into an engagement. He instead turned toward the mid-Atlantic, where Scharnhorst sank the Greek cargo ship Marathon. The two ships then refueled from the tankers Uckermark and Ermland on 12 March.|$|E

5|$|On January 22, 2007, green Vekoma track {{resembling}} the track of X-Flight was spotted at Kings Island, a Cedar Fair park in Mason, Ohio. On February 5, 2007, Kings Island officially announced Firehawk {{as the former}} X-Flight roller coaster from Geauga Lake. Construction was scheduled to begin later that month, and the opening was set for Memorial Day weekend later that year. X-Flight's neon green track and dark blue supports were re-painted red and steel gray, respectively. It was built in an area next to Flight of Fear, creating <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>area</b> named X-Base which connects to nearby area Coney Mall. Firehawk officially opened as scheduled on May 26, 2007. It was the first roller coaster to be introduced at the park since Cedar Fair purchased it from Paramount Parks in 2006. The first 2,500 riders received commemorative Firehawk T-shirts.|$|E
5|$|On May20, {{following}} Typhoon Brenda's {{passage through}} the South China Sea, a monsoon trough extending from the area into the Bay of Bengal received enhanced low-level southwesterly flow. An environment of weak wind shear {{in the wake of}} the typhoon allowed <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>area</b> of low pressure to form within the southwesterly flow on May21. With convection becoming persistent and the system's overall presentation more organized by May22, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert at 0300UTC. Around this time, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the system as a tropical depression. Later that day, convection wrapped entirely around the center of circulation; this structural improvement, combined with nearby surface observations, prompted the JTWC to designate the system as Tropical Storm Cecil.|$|E
5|$|On September 13, {{despite being}} in an {{extremely}} hostile environment with very high wind shear, convection redeveloped {{near the center of}} Fred, and regeneration into a tropical cyclone was seen as a possibility. Two days later, the NHC noted that environmental conditions could become marginally favorable for redevelopment of the system. On September16, the circulation of Fred became less defined and only intermittent convection persisted around the system. By September17, the remnant circulation became increasingly disorganized and the system dissipated later that day without regenerating into a tropical cyclone. However, several hours later, <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>area</b> of low pressure formed in association with the remnants of Fred roughly 525mi (845km) south of Bermuda. The remnant low finally dissipated on September19, roughly 520mi (835km) southwest of Bermuda.|$|E

5|$|Subtropical Storm One was a {{short-lived}} subtropical cyclone that brought copious amounts of rainfall to central Florida in late June 1974. The storm originated {{in an area}} of convection that detached from a tropical depression over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico on June24. <b>A</b> <b>new</b> <b>area</b> of low pressure developed underneath the convection and the system began to intensify. Later that day, the storm had become sufficiently organized to be classified as a subtropical depression. Early on June25, it made landfall near Clearwater, Florida with winds of 50mph (85km/h) and later attained its peak intensity over eastern Florida with winds of 65mph (100km/h). After reemerging into the Atlantic Ocean, the system began to weaken as it underwent an extratropical transition. The storm ultimately dissipated off the coast of North Carolina early on June26.|$|E
