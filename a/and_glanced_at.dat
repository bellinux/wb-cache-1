25|$|On lap 17, Bird {{attempted}} to overtake López {{heading into the}} first turn, but the two cars made contact in the corner, causing Bird to run wide and fell to sixth after he was passed by Vergne and di Grassi and was placed under pressure by Abt. Bird lost two further positions when Abt and Prost passed him and López fell to fourth when Vergne overtook the higher-placed Virgin car. Di Grassi passed López entering the first corner shortly after. Buemi was 1.3 seconds behind race leader Rosenqvist by the 20th lap but the latter {{was aware of the}} situation <b>and</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> his rear-view mirrors to ensure he had large enough of an advantage to remain ahead after the pit stop phase. The mandatory pit stop phase for the switch into a second car began on lap 23 when the leading drivers entered the pit lane. After driving out of his team's garage in his second car, Rosenqvist was released into the path of Heidfeld in the other Mahindra car, causing his teammate to swerve to the outside and nearly entered another team's pit gantry. Heidfeld came to a halt without damaging his car. Although he was briefly delayed, Rosenqvist kept the lead. The stewards immediately investigated Rosenqvist for the pit stop release.|$|E

60|$|He sighed faintly, <b>and</b> <b>glancing</b> <b>at</b> the girl, who {{was looking}} {{out of the window}} again, took up his pen and signed his blotting-paper.|$|R
60|$|The desks were opened, and Mr. Porson walked round <b>and</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> each.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Lorry {{glanced at}} the distant House, <b>and</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> the angry Stryver.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge {{scratched}} his chin {{for a moment}} thoughtfully <b>and</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> his diary.|$|E
60|$|He paused <b>and</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> {{the face}} of his prisoner, who still {{maintained}} rigid silence.|$|E
