500|$|Pearl's {{voice is}} {{provided}} by American actress Lori Alan in the series and both feature films. During her audition for the role, she was shown an early drawing of Pearl with the other main characters. She noted how Pearl was {{much larger than the}} rest of the cast, and decided to reflect the character's size in her voice by making it deep and full in tone. She also aimed to make the voice invoke the sound of whales’ low vocalizations while also sounding [...] "spoiled and lovable". In an interview with AfterBuzz TV, <b>Alan</b> <b>said</b> that she knew Pearl [...] "had to sound somewhat like a child," [...] but at the same time needed [...] "an abnormally large voice".|$|E
500|$|Carolyn Lawrence voices Sandy Cheeks. When Lawrence {{was on a}} {{sidewalk}} in Los Feliz, Los Angeles with a friend who knew SpongeBob SquarePants casting director Donna Grillo, her friend said to Grillo that Lawrence had [...] "an interesting voice". Grillo invited Lawrence to audition and she got the role. Mrs. Puff's voice is provided by American actress Mary Jo Catlett, {{who is known for}} her live-action roles on television programs from the 1970s such as Diff'rent Strokes and M*A*S*H. As of 2017, voicing Mrs. Puff has become her only remaining regular television role; Catlett described herself as [...] "basically retired" [...] in 2013, since she feels that voicing Mrs. Puff requires less preparation than her performances in person. Lori Alan voices Pearl Krabs. During her audition for the role, Alan was shown an early drawing of the characters and took note of how Pearl was much larger {{than the rest of the}} cast. She decided to reflect the character's size in her voice by making it deep and full in tone. She aimed to make Pearl's voice invoke the sound of whales’ low vocalizations while also sounding [...] "spoiled and lovable."

6000|$|After this {{announcement}} Jeekie rose {{and walked down}} the room, carrying the cold mutton in his hand. Then he returned, replaced it on the table and standing in front of <b>Alan,</b> <b>said</b> earnestly: ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Alan</b> <b>said</b> {{that the}} plan was good, but Jeekie shook his head, asking {{what would happen if}} Fahni, finding himself safe upon the water, thought it wisest not to come to fetch them.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{will be many}} a long day," [...] <b>Alan</b> <b>said</b> to me on {{our first}} morning, [...] "before the red-coats think upon seeking Corrynakiegh; so now we must get word sent to James, and he must find the siller for us." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Mr. <b>Alan</b> <b>said</b> {{he would}} have his breakfast in his room, miss," [...] murmured the butler, in husky respectfulness, as he {{returned}} to Bessie from carrying Miss Lynde's cup to her. [...] "He don't want anything but a little toast and coffee." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't forget you," [...] <b>Alan</b> <b>said,</b> smiling {{a little}} {{in spite of his}} suffering. [...] "You are the only woman I can ever love--and I can't give you up unless I have to. Won't you be frank with me, dear? Do you {{honestly}} think you can never learn to love me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>Alan</b> <b>said,</b> {{with his}} {{measured}} distinctness: [...] "Nobody cares what you think. Come in, {{and get something}} to carry you over the bridge. Cambridge cars stopped running long ago. I say you shall!" [...] He began to raise his voice. A light flashed in a window across the way, and a sash was lifted; some one must be looking out.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Alan</b> Menken <b>said</b> [...] "It's {{a really}} rich number and I think it's {{possibly}} the best opening number I've ever written for any project".|$|R

5000|$|<b>Alan</b> Watts <b>said,</b> [...] Having a {{conversation}} with him is like dropping a pebble in a well and never hearing it drop. The soundless pebble in the bottomless well." ...|$|R
60|$|Some seven hours' incessant hard {{travelling}} {{brought us}} {{early in the}} morning {{to the end of a}} range of mountains. In front of us there lay a piece of low, broken, desert land, which we must now cross. The sun was not long up, and shone straight in our eyes; a little, thin mist went up from the face of the moorland like a smoke; so that (as <b>Alan</b> <b>said)</b> there might have been twenty squadron of dragoons there and we none the wiser.|$|E
6000|$|There {{are many}} {{incidents}} {{given in the}} trial that point to Alan's fiery spirit and Highland quickness to take offence. One witness [...] "declared also That the said Alan Breck threatened that he would challenge Ballieveolan and his sons to fight because of his removing the declarant last year from Glenduror." [...] On another page: [...] "Duncan Campbell, change-keeper at Annat, aged thirty-five years, married, witness cited, sworn, purged and examined ut supra, depones, That, {{in the month of}} April last, the deponent met with Alan Breck Stewart, with whom he was not acquainted, and John Stewart, in Auchnacoan, in the house of the walk miller of Auchofragan, and went on with them to the house: Alan Breck Stewart said, that he hated all the name of Campbell; and the deponent said, he had no reason for doing so: But <b>Alan</b> <b>said,</b> he had very good reason for it: that thereafter they left that house; and, after drinking a dram at another house, came to the deponent's house, where they went in, and drunk some drams, and Alan Breck renewed the former Conversation; and the deponent, making the same answer, <b>Alan</b> <b>said,</b> that, if the deponent had any respect for his friends, he would tell them, that if they offered to turn out the possessors of Ardshiel's estate, he would make black cocks of them, before they entered into possession by which the deponent understood shooting them, it being a common phrase in the country." ...|$|E
60|$|We left Musselburgh {{before the}} first ninepenny coach was due from Edinburgh, for (as <b>Alan</b> <b>said)</b> that was a rencounter we might very well avoid. The wind, {{although}} still high, was very mild, the sun shone strong, and Alan began to suffer in proportion. From Prestonpans he had me aside {{to the field of}} Gladsmuir, where he exerted himself a great deal more than needful to describe the stages of the battle. Thence, at his old round pace, we travelled to Cockenzie. Though they were building herring-busses there at Mrs. Cadell's, it seemed a desert-like, back-going town, about half full of ruined houses; but the ale-house was clean, and Alan, who was now in a glowing heat, must indulge himself with a bottle of ale, and carry on to the new luckie with the old story of the cold upon his stomach, only now the symptoms were all different.|$|E
5000|$|The Guardians {{editor-in-chief}} <b>Alan</b> Rusbridger <b>said</b> in November 2013 {{that only}} {{one percent of the}} documents had been published. Officials warned that [...] "the worst is yet to come".|$|R

60|$|The {{end of it}} {{was they}} took up their loads again and marched, while behind them walked the terrible and {{gigantic}} Jeekie, the barrels of the shotgun which he carried at full cock and occasionally used to prod them, pointing directly at their backs. A strange object he looked truly, for {{in addition to the}} weapons with which he bristled, several cooking-pots were slung about him, to say nothing of a cork mattress and a mackintosh sheet tied in a flat bundle to his shoulders, a box containing medicines and food which he carried on his head, and fastened to the top of it with string like a helmet on a coffin, an enormous solar-tope stuffed full of mosquito netting, of which the ends fell about him like a green veil. When Alan remonstrated with him as to the cork mattress, suggesting that it should be thrown away as too hot to wear, Jeekie replied that he had been cold for thirty years, and wished to get warm again. Guessing that his real reason for declining to part with the article, was that his master should have something to lie on, other than the damp ground, <b>Alan</b> <b>said</b> no more at the time, which, as will be seen, was fortunate enough for Jeekie.|$|E
5000|$|Campbell {{was kept}} on at Amstrad {{after the end}} of his {{original}} 12-month contract, but in March 2007, after two years at the company, he left to set up Bright Ideas Trust, which aims to give young entrepreneurs a chance to start up in business with equity funding and advice from business angels. Lord <b>Alan</b> <b>said</b> Campbell had been a [...] "great asset".|$|E
5000|$|In one episode, {{while at}} the movies, Alan orders $25 worth of food for Jake, only to tell Charlie that he [...] "forgot" [...] his wallet. This leads to an {{argument}} where Charlie complains that <b>Alan</b> <b>said</b> he would pay for parking, which {{he is unable to}} do, because he does not have his wallet. After a line builds up because of their arguing, Charlie agrees to pay the bill, as soon as Charlie brings out his wallet, Alan orders a bagel-dog to [...] "make it an even $30". In season 9, Alan does exactly the same thing to Walden when they go to the movies.|$|E

2500|$|Tribunal {{chairman}} Judge <b>Alan</b> Mahon <b>said</b> {{there were}} [...] "significant gaps" [...] {{in the money}} trail provided by Mr Ahern which [...] "would have {{made it impossible for}} the tribunal to follow the trail".|$|R

5000|$|In 1988, they {{recorded}} {{their debut}} album, Feel No Shame, which went to {{number one on}} the Irish Albums Chart. Within a couple of months it was certified Gold. However, in August 1988 after the option for their second album had been picked up, Aslan split up. The band recruited Eamo Doyle previously with Dublin band The Lookalikes as lead singer, but as drummer <b>Alan</b> <b>said</b> on the Made In Dublin DVD that [...] "it was like U2 trying to go on without Bono...it was just never going to work". Eamo Doyle went on to play with Les Binks from Judas Priest. The ex-lead singer, Christy, went on to form Dignam & Goff with guitarist Conor Goff and other members went on to form another band, The Precious Stones.|$|E
5000|$|Close to {{the time}} that Alan retired as a Professor at the University of Windsor in 1994, a young man came into his office. He asked, [...] "Dr. Brown, would you write a letter saying that I never {{disrupted}} your class?" [...] <b>Alan</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Well, you never disrupted my class - I know that because I don’t remember you! But what is this about?" [...] The student revealed {{that he was a}} Holocaust denier, and unlike the U.S. where [...] "freedom of speech" [...] reigns, denying the Holocaust was met with punishment, {{and in the case of}} university, expulsion. Alan agreed that he would write the letter for the young man on the condition that he accompany Alan to the Detroit Holocaust Memorial Center. Alan never saw the student again, but Alan realized the imminent need for him to speak publicly about his experiences.|$|E
5000|$|Speaking {{about the}} album, lead singer <b>Alan</b> Donohoe <b>said,</b> [...] "The album was {{inspired}} by a combination of choral music, the television show 24, Bond theme tunes, World War I poets and the Sugababes".|$|R
