Why were my fascinations not to be exercised, <b>as</b> <b>per</b> <b>contract?</b> I {{began to}} suspect the worst, and I was {{thinking}} of nothing else while we drove to the premises of the Bulcester Literary Society. Could Jane have drowned {{herself out of the}} way, or taken smallpox, which might ruin her charms? Well, I had not a large audience, on account of fear of infection, I suppose, and all the people present wore the red badge, like Mr. Warren, only he wore one on each arm. This somewhat amazed me, but as I had never spoken in public before I was rather in a flutter. However, I conquered my girlish shyness, and if the audience was not large it was enthusiastic. When I came to the peroration about wishing them all happy endings and real beginnings of true life, don't you know, the audience actually rose at me, and cheered like anything. Then someone proposed, [...] "Three cheers for young Warren," [...] and they gave them like mad; I did not know why, nor did he: he looked quite pale. Then his father, with tears in his voice, proposed a vote of thanks to me, and said that he and the brave hearts of old Bulcester, his old friends and brothers in arms, were once more united; and the people stormed the platform and shook his hand and slapped him on the back. At last we got out by a back way, where our cab was waiting. Young Mr. Warren was as puzzled as myself, and his father was greatly overcome and sobbing in a corner. We got into the house, where people kept arriving, and at last a fine old clerical-looking bird entered with a red badge on one arm and a very pretty girl in white on the other. She had a red badge too.|$|E

6000|$|In popular legend he is {{made the}} victim of some {{equivocation}} so gross that any court of equity would have ruled in his favor. On the other hand, if the story had been dressed up by some mediaeval Tract Society, the Virgin appears in person {{at the right moment}} ex machina, and compels him to give up the property he had honestly paid for. One is tempted to ask, Were there no attorneys, then, in the place he came from, of whom he might have taken advice beforehand? On the whole, he had rather hard measure, and it is a wonder he did not throw up the business in disgust. Sometimes, however, he was more lucky, as with the unhappy Dr. Faust; and even so lately as 1695, he came {{in the shape of a}} [...] "tall fellow with black beard and periwig, respectable looking and well dressed," [...] about two o'clock in the afternoon, to fly away with the Maréchal de Luxembourg, which, on the stroke of five, he punctually did <b>as</b> <b>per</b> <b>contract,</b> taking with him the window and its stone framing into the bargain. The clothes and wig of the involuntary aeronaut were, in the handsomest manner, left upon the bed, as not included in the bill of sale. In this case also we have a copy of the articles of agreement, twenty-eight in number, by the last of which the Maréchal renounces God and devotes himself to the enemy. This clause, sometimes the only one, always the most important in such compacts, seems to show that they first took shape in the imagination, while the struggle between Paganism and Christianity was still going on. As the converted heathen was made to renounce his false gods, none the less real for being false, so the renegade Christian must forswear the true Deity. It is very likely, however, that the whole thing may be more modern than the assumed date of Theophilus would imply, and if so, the idea of feudal allegiance gave the first hint, as it certainly modified the particulars, of the ceremonial.|$|E

40|$|Chapter 8 The ERDF project {{detailed}} a requirment for {{the scanning}} of an extensive area of 415 square kilometers employing an interferometric sonar. The process, though hampered by high wind and adverse sea conditions was completed <b>as</b> <b>per</b> <b>contract</b> requirements, yielding interesting new information of the bathymetric landscapes of the Maltese Islands. Survey design: The {{campaign for the}} bathymetric survey of the Maltese islands, carried out during the summers of 2012 and 2013, summed total area of about 415 square kilometres and covered depths between 15 and 200 m. Th e total survey area was divided into 28 survey blocks, laid out so each one was completed during {{a full day of}} work. This rule applied to all the blocks except for blocks 16 and 17 which were completed over the course of two days each. Each survey block was completed by running survey lines parallel to the blocks’ longitudinal axis. During rough weather, lines were run parallel to predominant wave direction to minimise vessel roll. Line spacing ranged from 50 to 300 metres and was decided by a combination of the sensor’s accuracy at increasing horizontal range, depth, seabed type and sea state. Crosslines were also run for each block, usually on the boundary, to allow for additional data checks between neighbouring blockspeer-reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Normally, the Extension of Time (EOT) {{shall be}} {{assessed}} {{based on the}} knowledge of the Superintending Officer (S. O) and any additional information given to him by the Contractor. However there are several problems that may delay the process of assessment of the EOT such as lack of details and particulars of submission by the Contractor, late submission of claim by the Contractor and poor demonstration of the impact of delay to the project’s completion date. Apart from that, the Contractor’s failure to provide the requested information is also a factor the S. O can take into account in assessing the EOT. This research was carried out to achieve two objectives; (i) to identify the most common problems associated with the assessment of EOT’s application and (ii) to identify how these problems can be solved by JKR. There are three (3) most common problems encountered by the S. O during assessment process namely lack of details and particulars, inadequate efforts from the Contractor to mitigate the delay and reasons to claim EOT are not relevant events <b>as</b> <b>per</b> <b>contract.</b> The problems were all very highly ranked by the respondents with the frequency of 83 %, 78 % and 70 % respectively. The results imply that strict compliance to the contract requirement is important if the Contractors wanted to secure their entitlement of EOT. In addition, there are six (6) recommended solutions that have been identified to minimize the problems, which include (i) Jawatan Kuasa Lanjutan Masa (JKLM) (ii) training course (iii) progress meeting (iv) proper planning (v) written instruction and (vi) strict enforcement.

40|$|Small {{business}} firms usually obtain finance {{from commercial}} lenders on {{fixed or variable}} rates of interest. These businesses, or any other borrower for that matter, {{will have to pay}} back the principal borrowed along with its stipulated interest {{at the end of the}} specified period. They are willing to pay the interest on the loan over and above the principal borrowed because they expect the borrowed amount of capital would make a marginal contribution in their profit at least equal to the total interest paid. They are legally liable for the payment of the interest and the principal regardless of their actual level of earnings. They must make these payments <b>as</b> <b>per</b> <b>contract</b> even if they suffer heavy losses in the project. This arrangement, which is common in most, if not all countries of the world, may cause a great deal of hardship on the part of the borrowers, especially at times of economic slowdown. There is a method of finance called profit/loss sharing practiced in some South-East Asian and Middle Eastern countries. A number of financial institutions in the Western countries including UK, Denmark, Luxembourg and Switzerland has been applying this method since the early 1980 s. The main objective of this thesis is to find out the attitudes towards, motivations for and probability of using the profit/loss sharing principle of finance by the Australian small businesses and financial institutions. Two surveys were conducted to achieve this objective. Multivariate statistical analysis, especially factor analysis, discriminant analysis and logit and probit regressions, was applied to the survey results. Factor analysis identified five factors which may explain why small businesses are motivated to borrow funds using the profit/loss sharing method of finance. These factors are business support, risk sharing, risk of default in the traditional system, cost of borrowing and suitability of the profit/loss sharing method. Another three factors were identified to provide reasons why small businesses would not borrow funds using this new principle namely, terms of borrowing, management intervention and high cost of borrowing. Discriminant analysis indicates that risk sharing between borrowers and lenders is the most important predictor in discriminating between the two groups of small businesses those who would and those who would not like to borrow funds using this method. The other discriminating variables include motivation for business expansion, cost of borrowing and management intervention. The logit and probit models show that the higher the degree of risk sharing, the lesser the cost of borrowing and the greater the motivation to business expansion, the higher the probability that the small businesses would apply the profit/loss sharing method. The respondents also indicated that the lower the degree of management intervention, the higher the likelihood that the small businesses would be prepared to apply this method of finance. A large number of variables determining the motives of financial institutions to lend funds on the basis of the profit/loss sharing method were reduced to four factors namely, business support, growth in demand for funds, risk of default under the traditional system and potential higher return to lenders. At least three underlying factors may explain why some financial institutions would not like to lend funds on this basis namely, management complication, unfamiliarity of the profit/loss sharing method and risk sharing with borrowers. Discriminant analysis applied to financial institutions suggests that the growth in demand for funds is the most important predictor in discriminating between the financial institutions who are prepared to lend money on the basis of the profit/loss sharing method and those who are not. The other significantly discriminating variables include the potential higher return on funds, depositors 2 ̆ 7 concern, monetary regulation, management complexity and risk sharing with borrowers.
