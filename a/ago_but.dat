5|$|The {{most likely}} star-formation {{scenario}} for Betelgeuse {{is that it}} is a runaway star from the Orion OB1 Association.

5|$|The Compton–Belkovich Thorium Anomaly is a hotspot (volcanic complex) on the Moon. It {{is on the}} {{far side}} of the Moon and was found by a gamma-ray {{spectrometer}} in 1998. It is an area of concentrated thorium, a radioactive element.

5|$|The Snake River Plain is a {{volcanic}} province {{that was created}} {{by a series of}} cataclysmic caldera-forming eruptions which started about 15 million years ago. A migrating hotspot thought to now exist under Yellowstone Caldera in Yellowstone National Park has been implicated. This hot spot was under the Craters of the Moon area some 10 to 11million years <b>ago</b> <b>but</b> 'moved' as the North American Plate migrated southwestward. Pressure from the hot spot heaves the land surface up, creating fault-block mountains. After the hot spot passes the pressure is released and the land subsides.|$|E

40|$|AbstractNuclear cap-binding protein (CBP) 80 / 20 -dependent {{translation}} (CT) {{is one of}} {{the targets}} for miRNA-mediated gene silencing. Here, we provide evidence that human argonaute 2 (Ago 2) competes with CBP 80 / 20 for cap-association, inhibiting CT and thus nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), which is tightly coupled to CT. Tethering of <b>Ago</b> 2, <b>but</b> not of <b>Ago</b> 2 F 2 V 2 which lacks cap-association activity, to the 3 ′UTR of PTC-containing mRNA abrogates NMD. Immunoprecipitation using CBP 80 antibody reveals that <b>Ago</b> 2, <b>but</b> not <b>Ago</b> 2 F 2 V 2, inhibits the binding of CBP 80 / 20 to cap structure.

5|$|The {{fossil record}} for starfish is ancient, {{dating back to}} the Ordovician around 450 million years <b>ago,</b> <b>but</b> it is rather poor, as starfish tend to {{disintegrate}} after death. Only the ossicles and spines of the animal are likely to be preserved, making remains hard to locate. With their appealing symmetrical shape, starfish have played a part in literature, legend, design and popular culture. They are sometimes collected as curios, used in design or as logos, and in some cultures, despite possible toxicity, they are eaten.|$|E
5|$|The {{tradition}} of kulintang {{music has been}} waning throughout the Eastern Malay Archipelago, and has become extinct in some places. Sets of five bronze gong-chimes and a gong making up the totobuang ensembles of Buru island in Central Maluku have also come to disuse. Kolintang sets of bossed kettle gongs were once played in Gorontalo, North Sulawesi long <b>ago</b> <b>but</b> that has all but disappeared, replaced by what locals are presently familiar with—a slab-key instrument known as a kolintang.|$|E
5|$|A 900,000‑year‑long {{period of}} {{quiescence}} followed after the felsic shield-building stage, {{during which time}} erosion ate away at the shield's gentle slopes. This quiescence {{was followed by a}} mafic capping stage between 2.2and 0.8million years <b>ago,</b> <b>but</b> renewed activity might have occurred in the last 340,000years. Alkali olivine basalts of the mafic capping stage were derived from the fractionation of a clinopyroxene, olivine and oxide assemblage. However, the associated hawaiite lavas may have derived from an alkali olivine basalt parent by the fractionation of a clinopyroxene-dominated assemblage at higher pressures. As volcanic activity waned during the mafic capping stage, lava flows became more viscous and decreased in volume. This suggests that parental magmas may have been derived by increasingly smaller degrees of partial melting with time. If volcanic activity of the Itcha Range is related to a hotspot, this temporal and spatial evolution would suggest a waning heat source.|$|E

5|$|A {{persistent}} myth of {{more recent}} origin {{is that of}} the Glastonbury Zodiac, a purported astrological zodiac of gargantuan proportions said to have been carved into the land along ancient hedgerows and trackways, in which the Tor forms part of the figure representing Aquarius. The theory was first put forward in 1927 by Katherine Maltwood, an artist with an interest in the occult, who thought the zodiac was constructed approximately 5,000 years <b>ago.</b> <b>But</b> {{the vast majority of the}} land said by Maltwood to be covered by the zodiac was under several feet of water at the proposed time of its construction, and many of the features such as field boundaries and roads are recent.|$|E
5|$|About 298 {{million years}} ago Permian forests started to cover the continent, and there were tundras as late as 15 million years <b>ago,</b> <b>but</b> the climate of present-day Antarctica does not allow {{extensive}} vegetation to form. A combination of freezing temperatures, poor soil quality, lack of moisture, and lack of sunlight inhibit plant growth. As a result, the diversity of plant life is very low and limited in distribution. The flora of the continent largely consists of bryophytes. There are about 100 species of mosses and 25 species of liverworts, but only three species of flowering plants, {{all of which are}} found in the Antarctic Peninsula: Deschampsia antarctica (Antarctic hair grass), Colobanthus quitensis (Antarctic pearlwort) and the non-native Poa annua (annual bluegrass). Growth is restricted to a few weeks in the summer.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the small}} range of the bluebuck {{at the time of}} European {{settlement}} of the Cape region in the 17th and 18th centuries compared to the much wider area evidenced by fossil remains, it is thought the species was already in decline before this time. The bluebuck was the sole species of Hippotragus in the region until 70,00035,000 years <b>ago,</b> <b>but</b> the roan antelope appears to have become predominant about 11,000 years ago. This might have coincided with grasslands being replaced by, for example, brush and forest, thereby reducing what is presumed to be the preferred habitat of the bluebuck, the grasslands. The results of the sea level changes in the early Holocene may also {{have played a role in}} the decline of the species, and left only the southern population to survive into historical times.|$|E

5|$|In the past, the Doctor {{arrives at}} da Vinci's home but is {{captured}} by Captain Tancredi, who appears identical to Count Scarlioni.

Tancredi is currently employing da Vinci to create copies of the Mona Lisa as to finance Scarlioni's work. After Tancredi leaves, the Doctor knocks out his captor, marks the blank canvases with a felt-tip pen, and leaves a message to da Vinci to paint over his writing before returning to the present.|$|E
5|$|Norfolk has a {{long history}} of human occupation. Both Modern and Neanderthal people were present in the area before the last {{glaciation}} between 100,000 and 10,000years ago, and humans returned as the ice retreated northwards. The archaeological record is poor until about 20,000 years ago, partly because of the prevailing conditions, but also because the coastline was much further north than at present. As the ice retreated during the Mesolithic, the sea level rose, filling what is now the North Sea. This brought the Norfolk coastline much closer to its present line, so that many ancient sites are now under the sea. The oldest signs of habitation on the marshes are prehistoric Clactonian flint blades possibly from 400,000 years <b>ago,</b> <b>but</b> few other prehistoric remains have been recorded here.|$|E
5|$|Paleo-Indians {{visited the}} area about 12,000 years <b>ago</b> <b>but</b> {{did not leave}} much archaeological {{evidence}}. Northern Shoshone created trails through the Craters of the Moon Lava Field during their summer migrations from the Snake River to the camas prairie, west of the lava field. Stone windbreaks at Indian Tunnel were used to protect campsites from the dry summer wind. No evidence exists for permanent habitation by any Native American group. A hunting and gathering culture, the Northern Shoshone pursued elk, bears, American bison, cougars, and bighorn sheep— all large game who no longer range the area. The most recent volcanic eruptions ended about 2,100 years ago and were likely witnessed by the Shoshone people. Shoshone legend speaks of a serpent on a mountain who, angered by lightning, coiled around and squeezed the mountain until liquid rock flowed, fire shot from cracks, and the mountain exploded.|$|E
