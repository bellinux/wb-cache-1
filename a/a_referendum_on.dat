5|$|Europe: Brown {{supported}} the EU Reform Treaty and repeatedly dismissed calls for <b>a</b> <b>referendum</b> <b>on</b> the issue.|$|E
5|$|Brown and the Labour {{party had}} pledged to allow <b>a</b> <b>referendum</b> <b>on</b> the EU Treaty of Lisbon. On 13 December 2007, Foreign Secretary David Miliband {{attended}} for the Prime Minister at the official signing ceremony in Lisbon of the EU Reform Treaty. Brown's opponents {{on both sides}} of the House, and in the press, suggested that ratification by Parliament was not enough and that a referendum should also be held. Labour's 2005 manifesto had pledged to give British public <b>a</b> <b>referendum</b> <b>on</b> the original EU Constitution. Brown argued that the Treaty significantly differed from the Constitution, and as such did not require a referendum. He also responded with plans for a lengthy debate on the topic, and stated that he believed the document to be too complex to be decided by referendum.|$|E
5|$|Corzine {{spent some}} $200,000 {{of public funds}} on {{advertisements}} to promote <b>a</b> <b>referendum</b> <b>on</b> the 2007 New Jersey ballot to borrow $450million to fund stem cell research. The referendum faced strong opposition and was rejected {{despite the fact that}} $270million had previously been approved to build stem cell research centers.|$|E
50|$|Another EU nation, Croatia, banned {{same-sex}} marriages in <b>a</b> constitutional <b>referendum</b> <b>on</b> 1 December 2013. Turnout in Croatia was also less than 50%, but its constitution does not invalidate <b>a</b> <b>referendum</b> based <b>on</b> turnout.|$|R

5|$|In August 2009 the SNP {{proposed}} {{a bill to}} hold <b>a</b> <b>referendum</b> <b>on</b> independence in November 2010. Opposition from all other major parties led to an expected defeat. After the 2011 elections gave the SNP an overall majority in the Scottish Parliament, <b>a</b> <b>referendum</b> <b>on</b> independence for Scotland was held on 18 September 2014. The referendum resulted in a rejection of independence, by 55.3% to 44.7%. During the campaign, the three main parties in the UK Parliament pledged to extend {{the powers of the}} Scottish Parliament. An all-party commission chaired by Lord Smith of Kelvin was formed, which led to a further devolution of powers through the Scotland Act 2016.|$|E

5|$|Arlington was {{incorporated}} as a fourth-class city on May 20, 1903, including {{the remnants of}} Haller City (located north of modern-day Division Street). The incorporation came after <b>a</b> <b>referendum</b> <b>on</b> May 5, in which 134 of 173 voters approved the city's incorporation. The new city elected shingle mill owner John M. Smith as its first mayor. In the years following incorporation, Arlington gained a local bank, a cooperative creamery, a city park, a library, electricity, and telephone service.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{continued}} to be dogged by controversy about not holding <b>a</b> <b>referendum</b> <b>on</b> the EU Treaty of Lisbon. On the morning of 13 December 2007, Foreign Secretary David Miliband stood in for Brown at the official signing ceremony in Lisbon of the EU Reform Treaty, which was attended by all other European heads of government. At the time, Brown was appearing before the Liaison Committee; he went to Portugal to sign the treaty that afternoon. Brown was criticised by opponents {{on both sides of}} the House and in the press. His critics said that neither Brown nor Labour had a mandate to ratify the treaty without public consent. Conservative leader David Cameron pointed to Labour's 2005 manifesto, which had pledged to give the British public <b>a</b> <b>referendum</b> <b>on</b> the original EU Constitution. Brown said the Treaty differed on significant points from the Constitution and was no longer a constitution but an ordinary treaty, and as such did not require a referendum. He also responded with plans for a lengthy debate on the topic and stated that he believed the document to be too complex to be decided by referendum.|$|E
5|$|Gould's {{career as}} justice {{minister}} {{was marked by}} consolidation of the law, tightening of licensing laws and reforms relating to police courts. A supporter of Federation, he nevertheless opposed the 1898 bill, which he believed deprived New South Wales of adequate recognition. He was defeated in the election of that year, but in 1899 {{he was one of}} Premier Reid's twelve appointments to the Legislative Council that enabled the passage of the legislation for <b>a</b> <b>referendum</b> <b>on</b> Federation.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, British prime {{minister}} Gordon Brown {{had a meeting}} with Argentine president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, and said {{that there would be no}} further talks over the sovereignty of the Falklands. In March 2013, the Falkland Islands held <b>a</b> <b>referendum</b> <b>on</b> its political status, with 99.8 percent of voters favoured remaining under British rule. Argentina does not recognise the Falkland Islands as a partner in negotiations; consequently, it dismissed the Falkland Islands' sovereignty referendum.|$|E

Cuban President Fidel Castro described the petition drive as a U.S.-backed conspiracy to overthrow his government.|$|E
5|$|In May 2008, {{the eastern}} {{departments}} pushed for greater autonomy, but Morales' government rejected {{the legitimacy of}} their position. They called for <b>a</b> <b>referendum</b> <b>on</b> recalling Morales, which saw an 83% turnout and in which Morales was ratified with 67.4% of the vote. Unified as the National Council for Democracy (CONALDE), these groups – financed by the wealthy agro-industrialist, petroleum, and financial elite – embarked {{on a series of}} destabilisation campaigns to unseat Morales' government.|$|E

5|$|In the 2010 {{elections}} to the Crimean parliament, the Party of Regions received the largest share of votes, whilst the second-placed Communist Party of Ukraine received {{a much smaller}} share. Both of these political parties would later be targets of the Euromaidan movement. Former president of Crimea Yuriy Olexandrovich Meshkov called for <b>a</b> <b>referendum</b> <b>on</b> restoring the 1992 Constitution of Crimea in July 2011. As a consequence of this, a local court in Crimea deported Meshkov from Ukraine for five years.|$|E
5|$|In {{the general}} {{election}} campaign, Fletcher attempted to make the expansion of casino gambling, rather than the merit system investigation, the central issue. Beshear favored holding <b>a</b> <b>referendum</b> <b>on</b> {{a constitutional amendment to}} allow expanded casino gambling in the state, while Fletcher maintained that expanded gambling would bring an increase in crime and societal ills. The gambling issue failed to gain as much traction as the hiring scandal, however, and Beshear defeated Fletcher by a vote of 619,686 to 435,895.|$|E
5|$|Newfoundland {{recommended}} that the British Government hold <b>a</b> <b>referendum</b> <b>on</b> Newfoundland's future.

5|$|Philadelphia's {{municipal}} election of November 6, 1951 {{was the first}} held under the city's new charter, which had {{been approved by the}} voters the previous April, and the first Democratic victory in the city in more than a half-century. The positions contested were those of mayor and district attorney, and all seventeen city council seats. There was also <b>a</b> <b>referendum</b> <b>on</b> whether to consolidate the city and county governments. Citywide, the Democrats took majorities of over 100,000 votes, breaking a 67-year Republican hold on city government. Joseph S. Clark, Jr. and Richardson Dilworth, two of the main movers for the charter reform, were elected mayor and district attorney, respectively. Led by local party chairman James A. Finnegan, the Democrats also took fourteen of seventeen city council seats, and all of the citywide offices on the ballot. <b>A</b> <b>referendum</b> <b>on</b> city-county consolidation passed by a wide margin. The election marked the beginning of Democratic dominance of Philadelphia city politics, which continues today.|$|E
5|$|The Referendum Party was a Eurosceptic, single-issue {{political}} party that {{was active in}} the United Kingdom from 1994 to 1997. The party's sole objective was for a referendum to be held {{on the nature of the}} UK's membership of the European Union (EU). Specifically, it called for <b>a</b> <b>referendum</b> <b>on</b> whether the British people wanted to either be part of a federal European state or revert to being a sovereign nation that was part of a free-trade bloc without wider political functions.|$|E

With calls growing for <b>a</b> new <b>referendum</b> <b>on</b> the UK’s relationship with the European Union, Oliver Daddow argues that political leaders have largely ceded control of the debate to backbench MPs and an increasingly Eurosceptic media. Unless strong and determined arguments are made by the ‘pro-EU’ side, there is little hope of <b>a</b> new <b>referendum</b> producing the same result as in 197...|$|R
