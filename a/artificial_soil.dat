60|$|Before them {{extended}} a wide, but mountainous landscape: after {{the small and}} very rugged plain {{on the brink of}} which they were posted, many hilly ridges, finally a lofty range. The general character of the scene was severe and savage; the contiguous rocks were black and riven, the hills barren and stony, the granite peaks of the more eminent heights uncovered, except occasionally by the snow. Yet, notwithstanding the general aridity of its appearance, the country itself was not unfruitful. The concealed vegetation of the valleys was not inconsiderable, and was highly cherished; the less precipitous cliffs, too, were cut into terraces, and covered with <b>artificial</b> <b>soil.</b> The numerous villages intimated that the country was well populated. The inhabitants produced sufficient wine and corn for their own use, were clothed in garments woven by themselves, and possessed some command over the products of other countries by the gums, the bees'-wax, and the goats' wool which they could offer in exchange.|$|E
60|$|The terrace towards which Adelheid and {{her father}} {{advanced}} was an irregular walk, shaded by venerable trees that had been raised near the principal or the carriage gate of the castle, on a ledge of those rocks that form {{the foundation of the}} buildings themselves. It had its parapet walls, its seats, its <b>artificial</b> <b>soil,</b> and its gravelled allées, as is usual with these antiquated ornaments; but it also had, what is better than these, one of the most sublime and lovely views that ever greeted human eyes. Beneath it lay the undulating and teeming declivity, rich in vines, and carpeted with sward, here dotted by hamlets, there park-like and rural with forest trees, while there was no quarter that did not show the roof of a château or the tower of some rural church. There is little of magnificence in Swiss architecture, which never much surpasses, and is, perhaps, generally inferior to our own; but the beauty and quaintness of the sites, the great variety of the surfaces, the hill-sides, and the purity of the atmosphere, supply charms that are peculiar to the country. Vévey lay at the water-side, many hundred feet lower, and seemingly on a narrow strand, though in truth enjoying ample space; while the houses of St. Saphorin, Corsier, Montreux, and of a dozen more villages, were clustered together, like so many of the compact habitations of wasps stuck against the mountains. But the principal charm was in the Leman. One who had never witnessed the lake in its fury, could not conceive the possibility of danger in the tranquil shining sheet that was now spread like a liquid mirror, for leagues, beneath the eye. Some six or seven barks were in view, their sails drooping in negligent forms, as if disposed expressly to become models for the artist, their yards inclining as chance had cast them, and their hulls looming large, to complete the picture. To these near objects must be added the distant view, which extended to the Jura in one direction, and which in the other was bounded by the frontiers of Italy, whose aërial limits were to be traced in that region which appears to belong neither to heaven nor to earth, the abode of eternal frosts. The Rhone was shining, in spots, among the meadows of the Valais, for the elevation of the castle admitted of its being seen, and Adelheid endeavored to trace among the mazes of the mountains the valleys which led to those sunny countries, towards which they journeyed.|$|E

The succession of enzyme activities involved in C-, N- and P-cycling gave clear evidence that nutrient limitation drove microbial community structure during the incubation independent of mineral composition. Discriminant analyses of principal components of PLFAs showed that microbial community structure changed over a period of 18 months toward similar communities for all <b>artificial</b> <b>soils</b> at the end of incubation. This was supported by a shift in the soil microbial community from dominance of specific phyla like Betaproteobacteria, which is often referred to as copiotrophic organisms, during the first 6 months of the incubation, toward systems with a higher dominance of e. g. Acidobacteria, which are suggested to follow the oligotrophic life-strategy. The effect of mineral surface properties on enzyme activities was pronounced during the first 6 months of incubation. Microbial colonization and succession on mineral surfaces was likely affected by mineral properties such as surface charge and, at the end of incubation, availability of beneficial nutrients. Charcoal affected the microbial community only during the first 6 months of incubation with slightly increased colonization by bacteria which are often described as oligotrophic organisms. In contrast, illite and montmorillonite probably provided nutrient rich environments with montmorillonite supplying more exchangeable cations. The <b>artificial</b> <b>soils</b> experiment clearly showed that changes in substrate availability as well as mineral properties are important drivers for the development of microbial communities...|$|R
60|$|Filled {{with such}} fearful questionings, half-inarticulate and vague, like the {{thoughts}} of a child, the untutored youth went wandering on, till he reached {{the edge of the}} cliff below which lay his home. It lay pleasantly enough, that lonely Laura, or lane of rude Cyclopean cells, under the perpetual shadow of the southern wall of crags, amid its grove of ancient date-trees. A branching cavern in the cliff supplied the purposes of a chapel, a storehouse, and a hospital; while on the sunny slope across the glen lay the common gardens of the brotherhood, green with millet, maize, and beans, among which a tiny streamlet, husbanded and guided with the most thrifty care, wandered down from the cliff foot, and spread perpetual verdure over the little plot which voluntary and fraternal labour had painfully redeemed from the inroads of the all-devouring sand. For that garden, like everything else in the Laura, except each brother's seven feet of stone sleeping-hut, was the common property, and therefore the common care and joy of all. For the common good, as well as for his own, each man had toiled up the glen with his palm-leaf basket of black mud from the river Nile, over whose broad sheet of silver the glen's mouth yawned abrupt. For the common good, each man had swept the ledges clear of sand, and sown in the scanty <b>artificial</b> <b>soil,</b> the harvest of which all were to share alike. To buy clothes, books, and chapel furniture for the common necessities, education, and worship, each man sat, day after day, week after week, his mind full of high and heavenly thoughts, weaving the leaves of their little palm-copse into baskets, which an aged monk exchanged for goods with the more prosperous and frequented monasteries of the opposite bank. Thither Philammon rowed the old man over, week by week, in a light canoe of papyrus, and fished, as he sat waiting for him, for the common meal. A simple, happy, gentle life was that of the Laura, all portioned out by rules and methods, which were held hardly less sacred than those of the Scriptures, on which they were supposed (and not so wrongly either) to have been framed. Each man had food and raiment, shelter on earth, friends and counsellors, living trust in the continual care of Almighty God; and, blazing before his eyes, by day and night, the hope of everlasting glory beyond all poets' dreams.... And what more would man have had in those days? Thither they had fled out of cities, compared with which Paris is earnest and Gomorrha chaste,--out of a rotten, infernal, dying world of tyrants and slaves, hypocrites and wantons,--to ponder undisturbed on duty and on judgment, on death and eternity, heaven and hell; to find a common creed, a common interest, a common hope, common duties, pleasures, and sorrows.... True, they had many of them fled from the post where God had placed them, when they fled from man into the Thebaid waste.... What sort of post and what sort of an age they were, from which those old monks fled, we shall see, perhaps, before this tale is told out.|$|E

In this paper, we propose the use of artificial soils as a simplified and adjustable tool to disentangle soil processes and test ecological theories on microbial communities. To create an <b>artificial</b> <b>soil,</b> a protocol was designed based on commercially available clays, sand, calcium carbonates and humic acids.
