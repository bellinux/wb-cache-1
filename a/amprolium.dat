50|$|Coccidiosis is a {{significant}} disease of chickens, especially affecting the young chicks. It can be fatal or leave the bird with compromised digestion. There are chick feed mixes that contain a coccidiostat to manage exposure levels and control disease. In an outbreak, coccidiocidal medications are given.

40|$|Three drugs {{effective}} against myxosporeans and {{commonly used to}} treat spore-forming para- sites were tested in sharpsnout sea bream (Diplodus puntazzo) infected by Enteromyxum leei. Two medicated diets were applied, one containing salinomycin and <b>amprolium</b> and the second containing fumagillin. Compared to untreated fish, both treatments resulted in significant reduc- tions in prevalence, intensity of all developmental myxosporean stages, and mortality. The effect was more prominent with the salinomycin and <b>amprolium</b> combination, where the significant reductions in intensity, prevalence, and mortality were unaccompanied by any histopathological evidence of toxic side effects or growth reduction. Sporoblasts and mature spores with distorted structures were observed in both drug treatments, but were more prevalent in the salinomycin and <b>amprolium</b> treatment than in the fumagillin treatment, indicating direct effectiveness on the parasite.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were performed to}} evaluate effects of <b>amprolium</b> administration at specific times and concentrations in replacement broiler breeders of three genetic lines vaccinated against coccidiosis. Effects on performance parameters including body weight and flock uniformity, and post-vaccination oocyst cycling patterns were evaluated in addition to development of immunity following clinical Eimeria challenge according to gross and microscopic lesion scoring, post-challenge body weight gain (BWG), and total oocyst output. Experiment one was conducted on fresh pine shavings while experiment two was conducted on used litter remaining in treatment pens from the first trial. No significant differences were seen among treatment groups with regard to body weight in either trial. Increased magnitude of oocyst shedding was observed in trial one, Line A with the group receiving <b>amprolium</b> on day 10. Trends in the data indicated increased uniformity in Line A related to <b>amprolium</b> administration following day 21. The group in Line A receiving <b>amprolium</b> at day 10 showed a significantly lower degree of total oocyst output following challenge than the other medicated groups. The group receiving <b>amprolium</b> on day 10 in Line B showed significant reduction in post-vaccination oocyst shedding following treatment in both trials while all shedding was delayed in trial two {{when compared to the}} first trial.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the impact of a successful anti-myxosporean medication on the innate immune system of fish intensively cultured in the Mediterranean basin. For this purpose, juvenile and adult gilthead seabream (S. aurata L.) naturally infected with Polysporoplasma sparis in the kidney were used in a small-scale field trial. The infected fish were treated orally with the combination of salinomycin and <b>amprolium,</b> two drugs well known for their anti-coccidial effect in other animals. Drug efficacy and safety was evaluated in terms of changes observed in histopathology, mortality and P. sparis intensity and prevalence rate. Phagocytic functions of head-kidney leucocytes were also investigated at the end as well as one month post the medication. Salinomycin with <b>amprolium</b> exhibited a significant reduction in intensity and prevalence rate in both juvenile and adult fish, and no histopathological evidence for toxic side effects was observed. In addition, the successful treatment was closely correlated with a complete restoration of the diminished phagocytic ability and capacity as well as NO, and lysozyme secretion in a time dependent manner. This data suggests that salilomycin with <b>amprolium</b> can be an alternative treatment for myxosporean infections in warm-water fish, possibly exhibiting their action through the enhancement of host innate functions...|$|E

40|$|The {{potential}} antiparasitic and immunomodulatory {{effect of}} three treatments against myxosporean parasites on the {{innate immune system}} of sharpsnout sea bream (Diplodus puntazzo) was investigated. Fish naturally infected with Myxobolus sp. (Bivalvulida/Platysporina), a histozoic parasite mainly affecting the renal interstitial tissue, were treated by oral administration {{of a combination of}} salinomycin with <b>amprolium,</b> Origanum essential oil or fumagillin in a small-scale field trial. Various leucocyte functions influenced by myxosporean infection were examined in order to determine treatment effects on leucocyte immunocompetence of treated fish. One month post treatment all drugs caused a significant decrease in prevalence and intensity of infection in comparison to untreated, infected fish. The effect was most prominent in salinomycin with <b>amprolium</b> treated fish, which 1 -month post treatment contained either no cysts at all or a few spores free in melanomacrophage centres revealing almost total elimination of the parasite and the antiparasitic action of the treatment. There was no histopathological evidence of drug toxicity. Antiparasitic action was accompanied by a significant enhancement of phagocytic activity demonstrated by ingestion of large numbers of latex beads and the secretion of high levels of reactive nitrogen intermediates by phagocytes in vitro. Complete restoration of the diminished mitogenic responses and serum lysozyme secretion was also detected in salinomycin with amprolium-treated fish compared to untreated, infected fish. These data suggest that salilomycin with <b>amprolium</b> may be a promising treatment for myxosporean infections in intensively cultured warm-water fish, exhibiting action partially via the enhancement of host, innate immune functions and leading to parasite elimination. © 2005 Elsevier B.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the anticoccidial effect of the different concentrations of the acetic acid in the broiler chickens in comparison with the <b>amprolium</b> anticoccidial. A total of 198 chicks were placed 11 per pen with three pens per treatment. The different concentrations (1 %, 2 % and 3 %) of acetic acid and amproilum (at the dose rate of 125 ppm) were given to the experimental groups in drinking water from 10 - 19 th days of age. One group was kept as infected non medicated control and one as non infected non medicated control. All the groups were inoculated orally with 75, 000 sporulated oocysts at the 12 th day of age except non infected non medicated control. Anticoccidial effect was evaluated on the basis of performance (weight gain, feed conversion ratio) and pathogenic (oocyst score, lesion score and mortality %age) parameters. Among acetic acid medicated groups, the maximum anticoccidial effect was seen in the group medicated with 3 % acetic acid followed by 2 % and 1 % acetic acid medicated groups. <b>Amprolium</b> and 3 % acetic acid were almost equivalent in suppressing the negative performance and pathogenic effects associated with coccidiosis (Eimeria tenella) challenge. In summary, acetic acid has the potential to be used as alternative to chemotherapeutic drugs for Eimeria tenella control.

40|$|ABSTRACT Monensin, admixed {{with the}} feed {{at a level}} of 0. 0125 %, {{adequately}} protected chickens against experimental infections of Eimeria tenella initiated by a strain that had no previous exposure to drugs as well as by strains resistant to <b>amprolium,</b> arsenosobenzene, buquinoiate, clopidol, decoquinate, glycarbylamide, nequinate, nicarbazin, nitrofurazone, Nova-stat, Trithiadol, Unistat, or zoalene, respectively. When fed to uninfected chickens, monensin did not affect rate of gain to a significant degree in three of four replicates. Moreover, an analysis of the aggregate data did not indicate a significant difference in rate of gain between the uninfected group. POULTRY SCIENCE 53 : 770 - 772, 1974 MONENSIN has been shown to have a broad spectrum of activity against poultry coccidia in battery trials (Shumar...|$|E
40|$|Anophryoides haemophila is a ciliated {{protozoan}} and the causative {{agent of}} bumper car disease in lobsters. An in vitro system {{was developed to}} assess the effects of chemotherapeutants on ciliate motility and morphology. Monensin, formaldehyde and pyrimethamine + sulphaquinoxaline caused a dose-dependent reduction in ciliate motility and induced cell lysis. The effects of oxytetracycline were dependent upon the incubation solution; no effect was observed on ciliates in seawater and a dose-dependent decrease in ciliate motility and cell rounding occurred in 0. 8 M NaCl. <b>Amprolium</b> {{had no effect on}} ciliate motility or morphology. This system can be used to rapidly screen antiprotozoan compounds for efficacy against A. haemophila prior to selecting compounds for in vivo efficacy and safety studies.
