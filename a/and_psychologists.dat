5|$|Having {{experienced}} a stroke, {{a person may}} be admitted to a stroke unit, and treatments may be directed as preventing future strokes, including ongoing anticoagulation (such as aspirin or clopidogrel), antihypertensives, and lipid-lowering drugs. A multidisciplinary team including speech pathologists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, <b>and</b> <b>psychologists</b> plays {{a large role in}} supporting a person affected by a stroke and their rehabilitation.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} critiques {{of the theory}} from several perspectives. Arguments include that it {{emphasizes}} justice {{to the exclusion of}} other moral values, such as caring; that there is such an overlap between stages that they should more properly be regarded as separate domains; or that evaluations of the reasons for moral choices are mostly post hoc rationalizations (by both decision makers <b>and</b> <b>psychologists</b> studying them) of essentially intuitive decisions.|$|E
5|$|Though these {{theories}} of memory formation are now well established, they were farsighted for their time: late 19th and early 20th century neuroscientists <b>and</b> <b>psychologists</b> were not {{equipped with the}} neurophysiological techniques necessary for elucidating the biological underpinnings of learning in animals. These skills would not come until the later half of the 20th century, {{at about the same}} time as the discovery of long-term potentiation.|$|E

5|$|Swedish {{schoolchildren}} tell Bellman {{jokes about}} a person named Bellman, an antihero or modern-day trickster {{with little or no}} connection to the poet. The first known Bellman joke is in a book from 1835, which quoted a letter written in 1808 by a contemporary of Bellman. 19th century Bellman jokes were told by adults and focused on Bellman's life at court; they often related to sex. In the 20th century, the 'Bellman' character became generic, the jokes were told by schoolchildren, and often related to bodily functions. The jokes have been studied by anthropologists <b>and</b> <b>psychologists</b> since the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the storm, extensive psychological effects were documented. Difficulty during clean-up and recovery lead to increased divorce rates and a spike in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The cases of PTSD primarily impacted children. A sampling of 378adolescents by the University of South Carolina's Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics indicated that 3% of males and 9% of females met the criteria for PTSD. Dozens of children in the area attempted suicide, while counselors reported that between 50 and 60children discussed killing themselves between December1992 and January1993. A panel of psychiatrists <b>and</b> <b>psychologists</b> at the University of Miami agreed that as many as 90% of residents in the worst impacted areas would experience at least a few symptoms of PTSD. Within six months, the circumstances related to {{the aftermath}} of Andrew led to at least five suicides and four homicides.|$|E

25|$|All three Abrahamic {{religions}} {{were founded}} by men, so some scholars <b>and</b> <b>psychologists</b> have theorized {{that they may}} dramatize important themes around men's relationship with their fathers for the western world. Conversely, conservative theologians within these traditions, especially Christianity, see fatherhood itself modeled on God the Father.|$|E
25|$|Hull advised and {{inspired}} {{a number of}} graduate students <b>and</b> <b>psychologists</b> that went on to revise his theories and make contributions {{to the field of}} psychology.

25|$|Electrodermal {{activity}} {{measuring devices}} {{similar to the}} Scientology E-meter have historically been used by counselors of psychology and psychoanalysis.

25|$|The main {{influence}} {{on the development of}} archetypal psychology is Jung's analytical psychology. It is strongly influenced by Classical Greek, Renaissance, and Romantic ideas and thought. Influential artists, poets, philosophers, alchemists, <b>and</b> <b>psychologists</b> include: Nietzsche, Henry Corbin, Keats, Shelley, Petrarch, and Paracelsus. Though all different in their theories and psychologies, they appear to be unified by their common concern for the psyche – the soul.|$|E
25|$|Before long, Knox’s tests became {{well known}} among medical doctors <b>and</b> <b>psychologists</b> {{throughout}} the United States. Other physicians at Ellis Island also published similar articles expressing concerns similar to Knox’s regarding the cultural sensitivity {{of many of}} the established intelligence tests, indicating that he was not alone in his concerns. Yet, Knox left Ellis Island in May 1916, and did not return to the field of intelligence testing.|$|E

25|$|Friedan {{asserted}} {{that women are}} as capable as men for any type of work or any career path against arguments to the contrary by the mass media, educators <b>and</b> <b>psychologists.</b> The restrictions of the 1950s, and the trapped, imprisoned feeling of many women forced into these roles, spoke to American women who soon began attending consciousness-raising sessions and lobbying for the reform of oppressive laws and social views that restricted women.|$|E

25|$|In {{the twentieth}} century, {{division}} of labor by gender has been studied most systematically in women's studies (especially women's history, which has frequently examined the history and biography of women's participation in particular fields) and gender studies more broadly.

Women dominate as accountants, auditors, <b>and</b> <b>psychologists.</b>|$|E
