5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1958, Nasser formed a {{tripartite}} committee consisting of Zakaria Mohieddin, al-Hawrani, and Salah Bitar to oversee developments in Syria. By moving the latter two, who were Ba'athists, to Cairo, he neutralized important political figures who had their own ideas about how Syria should be run. He put Syria under Sarraj, who effectively reduced the province to a police state by imprisoning and exiling landholders who objected {{to the introduction of}} Egyptian <b>agricultural</b> <b>reform</b> in Syria, as well as communists. Following the Lebanese election of Fuad Chehab in September 1958, relations between Lebanon and the UAR improved considerably.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of <b>agricultural</b> <b>reforms</b> has debatable effects on food security in developing countries. This research investigates how such effects influenced maize supply in two developing countries which {{were among the}} first to introduce <b>agricultural</b> <b>reforms.</b> Conclusions from the research suggest that <b>agricultural</b> <b>reforms</b> led to mixed results. This may be attributed to the sometimes stop-go nature of reform implementation. The mixed results are reflected in the weak maize output response to price changes. Overall country economic conditions, state of agricultural development can be attributed to the pace of response, hence effect on agricultural supply. Elasticity of maize output to changes in price and acreage are strongly significant in maize output for the case of Kenya. Both restricted models of maize production suggest that prior to the {{introduction of}} reforms acreage, prices and alternative crops were more elastic when simulated with Zambian data than with Kenyan data. food security, <b>agricultural</b> <b>reforms,</b> elasticity of supply, International Relations/Trade,...|$|R

25|$|Hume {{was very}} {{interested}} in the development of agriculture. He believed that there was too much focus on obtaining revenue and no effort had been spent on improving the efficiency of agriculture. He found an ally in Lord Mayo who supported the idea of developing a complete department of agriculture.

25|$|In August 1945, the {{provisional}} government adopted the first sweeping agricultural reforms in Albania's history. The country's 100 largest landowners, who controlled {{close to a}} third of Albania's arable land, had frustrated all <b>agricultural</b> <b>reform</b> proposals before the war. The communists' reforms were aimed at squeezing large landowners out of business, winning peasant support, and increasing farm output to avert famine. The government annulled outstanding agricultural debts, granted peasants access to inexpensive water for irrigation, and nationalized forest and pastureland.|$|E
25|$|The Sixth Seimas {{adopted a}} number of laws, mostly related to <b>agricultural</b> <b>reform,</b> {{implementation}} of the Constitution of Lithuania {{and the introduction of}} Litas as the national currency. Supervision of financial markets was enhanced after {{a number of}} early financial institutions collapsed and other financial scandals came to light. On the other hand, the slow pace of market reforms, failure to restore the ownership of confiscated private property and weak efforts to fight corruption were criticized by the opposition. The chaotic process of privatization of public assets also came under criticism for allowing well-connected individuals and groups to take control of state enterprises.|$|E

The <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Reform</b> conducted after the war meant that peasants had to give away most of their wheat, grain, and cattle to the state, or face serious imprisonment. Land and property were confiscated on a massive scale. Many people also lost civil rights and their names were smeared.

25|$|Richard Edgeworth was {{comparatively}} {{fair and}} forgiving in {{his dealings with}} his tenants and was {{actively involved in the}} estate's management. After debating the issue with the economist David Ricardo, Maria came to believe that better management and the further application of science to agriculture would raise food production and lower prices. Both Richard and Maria were also in favour of Catholic Emancipation, enfranchisement for Catholics without property restrictions (although he admitted it was against his own interest), <b>agricultural</b> <b>reform</b> and increased educational opportunities for women. She particularly worked hard to improve the living standards of the poor in Edgeworthstown. In trying to improve conditions in the village she provided schools for the local children of all denominations.|$|E
25|$|Almost {{half of all}} {{the laws}} adopted during the period of the Sixth Seimas were related to <b>agricultural</b> <b>reform,</b> {{implementation}} of the Constitution of Lithuania and the introduction of Litas as the national currency. Among other important decisions, the Seimas adopted a structural reform of the judiciary and set up the Constitutional Court. The taxation system was reformed, partly in response to budget deficits that the Sixth Seimas never managed to close, and the Value Added Tax introduced. Dual-layered local government was introduced, with municipal and county administrations sharing the responsibility. On the other hand, the opposition criticized the successive governments and the ruling majority for the slow pace of market reforms, failure to restore the ownership of confiscated private property and weak efforts to fight corruption.|$|E
25|$|Oliver Goldsmith (1730?1774) {{started his}} {{literary}} {{career as a}} hack writer in London, writing on any subject that would pay enough to keep his creditors at bay. He came {{to belong to the}} circle of Samuel Johnson, Edmund Burke and Sir Joshua Reynolds. His reputation depends mainly on a novel, The Vicar of Wakefield, a play, She Stoops to Conquer, and two long poems, The Traveller and The Deserted Village. The last of these may be the first and best poem by an Irish poet in the English pastoral tradition. It has been variously interpreted as a lament for the death of Irish village life under British rule and a protest at the effects of <b>agricultural</b> <b>reform</b> on the English rural landscape.|$|E

500|$|The coup {{took place}} in June 1954. Backed by a US-supplied air force, Castillo Armas led 480 CIA-trained {{soldiers}} into Guatemala. Despite initial setbacks, US support to the rebels made the Guatemalan army reluctant to fight, and Árbenz resigned on 27June. A series of military juntas briefly held power during negotiations that ended with Castillo Armas assuming the presidency on 7July. Castillo Armas consolidated his power in an October 1954 election, {{in which he was}} the only candidate; his MNL was the only party allowed to contest congressional elections. Árbenz's popular <b>agricultural</b> <b>reform</b> was largely rolled back, with land confiscated from small farmers and returned to large landowners. Castillo Armas cracked down on unions and peasant organizations, arresting and killing thousands. He created a National Committee of Defense Against Communism, which investigated over 70,000 people and added 10% of the population to a list of suspected communists.|$|E
500|$|Fishing for herring and cod also grew in {{importance}} during the 19th century. Herring fishing was expanding generally in Scotland at that time, with fishing stations {{being set up}} in remote areas. Herring fishing began in 1814 on Stronsay and soon spread throughout the Orkney Islands. By {{the middle of the}} century, Shapinsay had 50 herring boats. Cod became important largely because the Napoleonic Wars forced English fishing boats to fish further north. Local fishermen, who had been catching fish using lines from small boats for centuries, also began trawling for cod. However, this was largely a part-time venture, unlike in Shetland, where many inhabitants made a living from fishing. A saying originating from this time states, [...] "a Shetlander is a fisherman with a croft, while an Orcadian is a farmer with a boat." [...] Consequently, fishermen from outside the Orkney Islands earned a large share of the profits. Helliar Holm's beaches were used to dry both herring and cod after they had been salted. With the end of the Napoleonic Wars, which led to cheaper sources of soda ash becoming available from continental Europe, the kelp industry collapsed by 1830. This collapse helped fuel <b>agricultural</b> <b>reform,</b> as crofters accustomed to earning a second income had to now earn more from farming.|$|E
500|$|Castillo Armas's junta drew {{support from}} {{individuals}} in Guatemala {{that had previously}} supported the dictator Jorge Ubico. José Bernabé Linares, the deeply unpopular head of Ubico's secret police, was named {{the new head of}} the security forces. Linares had a reputation for using electric-shock baths and steel skull-caps to torture prisoners. Castillo Armas also removed the right to vote from all illiterate people, who constituted two-thirds of the country's population, and annulled the 1945 constitution, giving himself virtually unbridled power. In 1956 he implemented a new constitution and had himself declared president for four years. His presidency faced opposition from the beginning: agricultural laborers continued to fight Castillo Armas's forces until August 1954, and there were numerous uprisings against him, especially in the areas that had experienced significant <b>agricultural</b> <b>reform.</b> Opposition to his government grew during Castillo Armas's presidency. On Labor Day in 1956, members of the government were booed off a stage at a labor rally, while officials who had previously been in the Árbenz administration were cheered. The Guatemalan Communist Party began to recover underground, and became prominent in the opposition. Overall, the government had to deal with four serious rebellions, in addition to the coup attempt by the cadets in 1954. On 25June 1956 government forces opened fire on student protesters, killing six people and wounding a large number. Castillo Armas responded by declaring a [...] "state of siege", and revoked all civil liberties. On the advice of the US ambassador, the protests were portrayed as a communist plot.|$|E

A very important lower social class was also created. According to region and the rights in force, the number of agricultural day workers and servants rose 2.5 times.

2500|$|In 1973, Shevardnadze {{launched}} an <b>agricultural</b> <b>reform</b> in Abasha, popularly {{referred to as}} the [...] "Abasha experiment". This reform was inspired by János Kádár's agricultural policy in Hungarian People's Republic, which returned agricultural decision-making to the local level of governance. Shevardnadze merged all Abasha agricultural institutions into a single entity and established a new remuneration system. If a farmer fulfilled the five-year plan early, he would be awarded a share of the crops. The policy had a positive effect on the Georgian economy and because of the large increase of agricultural output in Abasha, the reform was introduced elsewhere in the republic. The <b>agricultural</b> <b>reform</b> in Georgia became the model of the nationwide Agricultural-Industrial Organisations established by a decree in 1982.|$|E
2500|$|Lord Lytton's {{foreign policy}} {{according}} to Hume {{had led to}} the waste of [...] "millions and millions of Indian money".
