2500|$|The {{extent of}} work occupying the Bacteriological Institute is {{detailed}} in the Public Health Commissioner's annual reports. For 1905–1906, Pound {{stated that the}} institute had received a total of 17,062 specimens (animal and human combined). Specimens that returned positive for disease included: plague 49 (rat 38, human 11), tuberculosis 165 (cattle 2, human 163), typhoid 194, diphtheria 65, and leprosy 17. Unique specimens from medical operations were preserved for the institute's museum using the [...] "formalin-glycerine process". Inoculum for pleuropneumonia was still being supplied to cattle owners in Queensland and other states, [...] "guaranteed ... free from tuberculosis, <b>actinomycosis,</b> and other animal diseases". The institute also tested water and food. Of the 30 water samples examined for bacteria that year, Pound recorded that half were found to contain [...] "coli bacilli" [...] (an indicator of faecal contamination), 3 of which were also found to contain typhoid bacilli. An investigation of specimens from dengue fever patients was summarised with Pound noting that, of the microorganisms isolated, one microscopically distinct bacillus found common to 11 cases failed to prove as the [...] "sole exciting cause" [...] (now known to be viral).|$|E

50|$|In 1890 Bostroem {{reportedly}} {{isolated the}} causative organism of <b>actinomycosis</b> from {{a culture of}} grain, grasses, and soil. After Bostroem's discovery {{there was a general}} misconception that <b>actinomycosis</b> was a mycosis that affected individuals who chewed grass or straw. The agents of <b>actinomycosis</b> are now known to be endogenous organisms of the mucous membranes, in most cases Actinomyces israelii, a species named after surgeon James Israel, who first discovered its presence in humans in the late 1870s.|$|E

50|$|<b>Actinomycosis</b> is a {{quite common}} {{condition}} in cattle, {{where it is}} referred to as lumpy jaw or senfed (moroccan arabic), but it can also occur in horses, swine, dogs and rarely in sheep. In all these species, <b>actinomycosis</b> results in cold abscess, with granulomatous formations on the fistulised place.|$|E
50|$|Staphylococcus aureus {{is usually}} the {{organism}} that causes the infection, however {{it can also be}} caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa or several other species of bacteria.

50|$|Ponfick {{is remembered}} for his pioneer {{research}} of <b>actinomycosis,</b> and his {{recognition of the}} causative role Actinomyces played in human <b>actinomycosis.</b> He is credited with establishing the unity of human and bovine forms of the disease. In 1882 he published Die Actinomykose des Menschen, eine neue Infectionskrankheit (<b>Actinomycosis</b> of humans, a new infectious disease) {{in regards to the}} disease. He also made significant contributions in his research of myxedema, writing two articles on the disorder, Myxoedem und Hypophysis (Myxedema and hypophysis) and Zur Lehre vom Myxoedem (The doctrine of myxedema).|$|E

50|$|<b>Actinomycosis</b> is {{primarily}} caused {{by any of}} {{several members of the}} bacterial genus Actinomyces. These bacteria are generally anaerobes. In animals, they normally live in the small spaces between the teeth and gums, causing infection only when they can multiply freely in anoxic environments. An affected human often has recently had dental work, poor oral hygiene, periodontal disease, radiation therapy, or trauma (broken jaw) causing local tissue damage to the oral mucosa, all of which predispose the person to developing <b>actinomycosis.</b> A. israelii is a normal commensal species part of the microbiota species of the lower reproductive tract of women. They are also normal commensals among the gut flora of the caecum; thus, abdominal <b>actinomycosis</b> can occur following removal of the appendix. The three most common sites of infection are decayed teeth, the lungs, and the intestines. <b>Actinomycosis</b> does not occur in isolation from other bacteria. This infection depends on other bacteria (Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and cocci) to aid in invasion of tissue.|$|E

50|$|Treatment for <b>actinomycosis</b> {{consists}} of antibiotics such as penicillin or amoxicillin for 5 to 12 months, {{as well as}} surgery if the disease is extensive.|$|E
50|$|Disease {{incidence}} {{is greater}} in males {{between the ages}} of 20 and 60 years than in females. Before antibiotic treatments became available, the incidence in the Netherlands and Germany was one per 100,000 people/year. Incidence in the U.S. in the 1970s was one per 300,000 people/year, while in Germany in 1984, it was estimated to be one per 40,000 people/year. The use of intrauterine devices (IUDs) has increased incidence of genitourinary <b>actinomycosis</b> in females. Incidence of oral <b>actinomycosis,</b> which is harder to diagnose, has increased.|$|E
50|$|Actinobacteria are {{normally}} {{present in the}} gums and {{are the most common}} cause of infection in dental procedures and oral abscesses. Many Actinomyces species are opportunistic pathogens of humans and other mammals, particularly in the oral cavity. In rare cases, these bacteria can cause <b>actinomycosis,</b> a disease characterized by the formation of abscesses in the mouth, lungs, or the gastrointestinal tract. <b>Actinomycosis</b> is most frequently caused by A. israelii, which may also cause endocarditis, though the resulting symptoms may be similar to those resulting from infections by other bacterial species. Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans has been identified as being of note in periodontal disease.|$|E

50|$|Many {{species of}} the genus Actinomyces, {{including}} A. naeslundii, cause a chronic disease called <b>actinomycosis,</b> which is characterized by swelling and formation of an abscess which may exude pus. This can be accompanied by tissue fibrosis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Actinomycosis</b> may be {{considered}} when a patient has chronic progression of disease across tissue planes that is mass-like at times, sinus tract development that may heal and recur, and refractory infection after a typical course of antibiotics.|$|E

50|$|In 1877, with {{pathologist}} Otto Bollinger, {{he conducted}} early studies of <b>actinomycosis</b> in cattle, and is credited for naming the causal agent Actinomyces bovis. From his observations, {{he believed the}} culprit to be a mould, related to the genera Botrytis or Monosporium.|$|E
50|$|As {{is often}} the case, there are diseases/conditions with signs and {{symptoms}} {{that are similar to}} <b>actinomycosis.</b> As such, misdiagnoses can occur. Some examples include abscesses caused by grass seeds, woody tongue, bottle jaw, cancerous growths, and irritation caused by lodged objects.|$|E
5000|$|The genus is {{typically}} {{the cause of}} oral-cervicofacial disease. It {{is characterized by a}} painless [...] "lumpy jaw". Lymphadenopathy is uncommon in this form of the disease. Another form of <b>actinomycosis</b> is thoracic disease, which is often misdiagnosed as a neoplasm, as it forms a mass that extends to the chest wall. It arises from aspiration of organisms from the oropharynx. Symptoms include chest pain, fever, and weight loss. Abdominal disease is another manifestation of <b>actinomycosis.</b> This can lead to a sinus tract that drains to the abdominal wall or the perianal area. Symptoms include fever, abdominal pain, and weight loss. [...] Actinomyces species have also been shown to infect the central nervous system in a dog [...] "without history or evidence of previous trauma or other organ involvement." ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Actinomycosis</b> occurs {{rarely in}} humans, but rather {{frequently}} in cattle {{as a disease}} called [...] "lumpy jaw". This name refers to the large abscesses that grow {{on the head and}} neck of the infected animal. It can also affect swine, horses, and dogs, and less often wild animals and sheep.|$|E
50|$|<b>Actinomycosis</b> {{is a rare}} {{infectious}} {{bacterial disease}} caused by Actinomyces species. About 70% of infections are due to either Actinomyces israelii or A. gerencseriae. Infection can also be caused by other Actinomyces species, as well as Propionibacterium propionicus, which presents similar symptoms. The condition {{is likely to be}} polymicrobial aerobic anaerobic infection.|$|E
50|$|Cutaneous <b>actinomycosis</b> is {{a chronic}} disease {{that affects the}} deep {{subcutaneous}} tissue of the skin.
