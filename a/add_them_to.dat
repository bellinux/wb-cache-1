The molecules are absorbed into the plants' vascular system and poison insects feeding on them. Another approach involves spraying dsRNA like a conventional pesticide. This would allow faster adaptation to resistance. Such approaches would require low cost sources of dsRNAs that do not currently exist.|$|E
5|$|The {{entirety}} of Pacific City may be explored {{from the start}} of the game, allowing the player to locate the hideouts of each General and Kingpin, which can be made easier by accessing supply points scattered around the city. Once a supply point is unlocked, the player has the option of returning there to travel to any other supply point, restock on weapons and ammunition, or drop off newly acquired weapons, to permanently <b>add</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> their weapon selection. Should the player die, they can respawn at any open supply point. While exploring, the player is likely to come across enemy resistance, with their aggressiveness based on how badly the player has damaged that particular gang recently. If the player is too aggressive against the non-gang residents of Pacific City, including the Peacekeepers, they are flagged as rogue, and Agency hit squads are dispatched to take them down.|$|E

25|$|Abagnale's early {{confidence}} tricks included writing personal cheque {{on his own}} overdrawn account. This, however, {{would only}} work for a limited time before the bank demanded payment, so {{he moved on to}} opening other accounts at different banks, eventually creating new identities to sustain this charade. Over time through experimentation, he developed different ways of defrauding banks, such as printing out his own almost-perfect copies of checks such as payroll checks, depositing them, and encouraging banks to advance him cash {{on the basis of his}} account balances. Another trick he used was to magnetically print his account number on blank deposit slips and <b>add</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> the stack of real blank slips in the bank. This meant that the deposits written on those slips by bank customers entered his account rather than the accounts of the legitimate customers.|$|E

On the device, users can select an amusement ride {{they wish to}} queue for and the device will <b>add</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> a virtual queue. The Qbot device will notify users once their virtual queue time has elapsed through vibration and beeping. In 2011, the Qband was introduced for use at water parks. The device, which is similar in size and shape to a watch, functions similarly to the Qbot. Currently the Qband is used at waterparks around the world including: Six Flags Hurricane Harbor, Splish Splash, Wet'nWild Sydney, Raging Waters San Dimas. The Qsmart requires users to have a smartphone which they can use to join virtual queues in a similar method to the Qbot. It replaced the Q-txt product which allowed any mobile phone to register a spot in virtual queues.|$|E

500|$|Voiced by Toshimitsu Arai in most titles, Rugal {{makes his}} first {{appearance}} as the boss character from King of Fighters '94. The plot from the game introduces Rugal as an incredibly rich arms and drugs trafficker who organizes a King of Fighters tournament to reunite the strongest fighters from all the world. Once the player meets Rugal, he will reveal {{that he wants to}} turn his victims into stone statues to <b>add</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> his collection of fighters. Once defeated by Kyo Kusanagi and his teammates, Rugal self-destructs his ship to kill his opponents, but fails. In The King of Fighters '95, Rugal organizes a new King of Fighters tournament to take revenge on Kyo. To this end, Rugal brainwashes Kyo's father, Saisyu, to kill him. After Saisyu is knocked unconscious, Rugal proceeds to fight as the boss character, in an enhanced form named [...] However, once defeated, he is unable to control his new powers and his body is destroyed. Although Rugal is not featured in The King of Fighters '96, the new tournament organizer mentions that the man responsible for taking Rugal's right eye and giving him greater power is the game's antagonist, Goenitz.|$|E

Richards referenced the 21.9million downloads and 5.2million albums sold since the series since its May2009 premiere, but commented, [...] "Still, I believe {{that people want to}} hear originals over remakes, so up until the 'Glee' cast's original music it didn't make sense for us to play each latest cover, other than to spotlight it the day of the show." [...] However, Richards complimented the original [...] "Loser Like Me" [...] saying its lyrics would [...] "resonate with kids and parents" [...] and said that she liked it when she first heard it and when she saw it on the show. She also commented that it [...] "is good on its own, and having the Glee name on it gives it a leg up". Dave McKay, program director at WPST also echoed Richards' sentiments that the Glee sales were reason to <b>add</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> airplay, adding [...] "Not many artists or songs enjoy the type of exposure that 'Glee' provides.

500|$|The wailing {{call of the}} loon {{is widely}} used in film and {{television}} to evoke wilderness and suspense, and is referenced in songs such as [...] "Old Devil Moon" [...] ("wanna laugh like a loon"). The common loon {{is central to the}} plot of the children's novel Great Northern? by Arthur Ransome (in which it is referred to throughout as [...] "great northern diver", with the now-obsolete scientific name Colymbus immer). The story is set in the Outer Hebrides, where the main characters—a group of children on holiday—notice a pair of divers apparently nesting there. Checking their bird book, they believe that these are great northern divers. However, these have not previously been seen to nest in northern Scotland, and so they ask for help from an ornithologist. He confirms that these birds are indeed the great northern; unfortunately, it soon transpires that he does not wish merely to observe, but wants to steal the eggs and <b>add</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> his collection, and to do this, he must first kill the birds. Published in 1947, the story is one where the conservationists are the eventual victors over the egg collector, {{at a time when the}} latter hobby was not widely considered to be harmful.|$|E
