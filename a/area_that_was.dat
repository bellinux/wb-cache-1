5|$|A few of {{the roads}} {{surrounding}} the <b>area</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> Monte Ne {{on the edge of}} Beaver Lake have names reflecting what once was there. Highway 94, which once led to Monte Ne, is also called Monte Ne Road. Country Road 1195, which runs along the lake, is also called Pyramid Street and is a few hundred feet from where the Pyramid would have stood. Similarly Canal Street is nearby, named for the waterways that Harvey's gondolas once traveled. Other roads close by include Oklahoma Drive, Vinda Drive, and Monte Ne Estates Drive.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1900s, the {{graveyard}} was overshadowed on its northern side by a warehouse {{built on the}} Quay Street site of the Byrom family residence. The area had been residential—Richard Cobden {{was among those who}} lived nearby and attended the church—but changed in character during the 19th century, as many homes once occupied by affluent families became lodging houses and the locale became increasingly a place of business. Those who did live there, or were patients in the nearby hospitals, were poor and unable to contribute significantly to the funds of the church and its schools. Fundraising bazaars were held in the 1890s and 1900s at the Free Trade Hall, in a nearby <b>area</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> more salubrious.|$|E

5|$|Foresters and ecologists {{argue that}} large {{controlled}} burns in Yellowstone {{prior to the}} fires would not have greatly reduced the <b>area</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> consumed in 1988. Controlled burns would quickly become uncontrolled if {{they were allowed to}} burn with the intensity that many tree and plant communities need for proper regeneration. Consequently, natural fires, rather than controlled burns, are the park's primary maintenance tool. Since the late 1970s, some 300 natural fires have been allowed to burn themselves out. In rare circumstances, natural fires are supplemented by controlled burns that are deliberately started to remove dead timber under conditions which allow fire fighters an opportunity to carefully control where and how much wood fuel is consumed.|$|E
5|$|In late June 1944, {{during a}} {{strafing}} {{attack on a}} railway yard in the Po Valley in northern Italy, Smith was shot down by anti-aircraft fire. Parachuting from his aircraft, he landed without serious injury in the Ligurian Alps, in an <b>area</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> behind German lines, but largely {{under the control of}} anti-German Italian partisans. Smith spent three months working with the local resistance movement before trekking westwards, across the Maritime Alps, with three other Allied personnel, hoping to join up with the Allied forces that had just invaded southern France. After 23 days' hiking, he and his companions were recovered by American troops and repatriated.|$|E
5|$|Newark's Central Ward, {{formerly}} known as the old Third Ward, contains much of the city's history including the original squares Lincoln Park, Military Park and Washington Park. The Ward contains the University Heights, The Coast/Lincoln Park, Government Center, Springfield/Belmont and Seventh Avenue neighborhoods. Of these neighborhood designations only University Heights, a more recent designation for the <b>area</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> the subject of the 1968 novel Howard Street by Nathan Heard, is still in common usage. The Central Ward extends at one point as far north as 2nd Avenue.|$|E
40|$|Motivation: Association {{analysis}} is {{the method of}} choice for studying complex multifactorial diseases. The premise of this method <b>is</b> <b>that</b> affected persons contain some common genomic regions with similar SNP alleles and such areas will be found in this analysis. An important disadvantage of GWA studies <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it does not distinguish between genomic <b>areas</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> inherited from a common ancestor [identical by descent (IBD) ] and <b>areas</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> identical merely by state [identical by state (IBS) ]. Clearly, <b>areas</b> <b>that</b> can <b>be</b> marked with higher probability as IBD and have the same correlation with the disease status of identical <b>areas</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> more probably only IBS, are better candidates to be causative, and yet this distinction is not encoded in standard association analysis...|$|R

5|$|Rights of {{the poor}} was another <b>area</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> {{expanded}} by the ACLU. In 1966 and again in 1968, activists within the ACLU encouraged the organization to adopt a policy overhauling the welfare system, and guaranteeing low-income families a baseline income; but the ACLU board did not approve the proposals. The ACLU {{played a key role}} in the 1968 King v. Smith decision, where the Supreme Court ruled that welfare benefits for children could not be denied by a state simply because the mother cohabited with a boyfriend.|$|E

5|$|The <b>area</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> not reorganized was governed in two administrations {{linked to}} other French colonies. Following this, the {{territory}} of the colony was reestablished in 1902. Though the borders shifted slightly, there was little territorial change until 1933. At that point, the colony of the French Upper Volta (Haute-Volta, modern Burkina Faso) dissolved, and the northern territory was added to French Sudan.|$|E
5|$|After Sulphur Dell was {{dismantled}} on April 16, 1969, the ballpark's sunken {{field was}} filled in with rock, dirt, and {{the remains of}} the demolished Andrew Jackson Hotel. It was then converted to a number of state-owned parking lots for the nearby the Tennessee State Capitol. While Sulphur Dell was nestled in an <b>area</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> home to the city's garbage dump, stockyards, the Atlantic Ice House building, and other various warehouses, First Tennessee Park is now surrounded by new apartments, parking ramps, and restaurants. The facade surrounding the home plate entrance on the stadium's north side is constructed from cast ultra-high-performance concrete planks, zinc panels, and an array of windows that stretches across the full width of the entrance. To the south of the stadium, beyond the outfield wall, is an area that connects the city's Cumberland River Greenway to the Bicentennial Mall Greenway. It will be open to the public on non-game days after the surrounding apartment buildings and retail spaces are completed in spring 2018.|$|E
5|$|At Lebec, California, {{just south}} of the {{epicenter}} of the July mainshock, the San Andreas Fault comes together with the Garlock Fault, which is positioned at the northern border of the Mojave Desert. The San Andreas has been responsible for considerable seismic activity at its northern and southern sections, and traverses the area near the Transverse Ranges. The Kern Canyon Fault mirrors the path of the Kern River, and was thought to have a connection with the White Wolf Fault, but indicators observed following the July 21 earthquake demonstrated that the two are offset. The Owens Valley Fault, {{on the east side of}} the Sierran block, has been mapped and may possibly extend into <b>area</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> affected by the 1952 shocks. Other fault zones are present in the region, and have been of interest because they may have been responsible for minor earthquakes, but they are considered not as significant as the Kern Canyon, Owens Valley, and San Andreas Faults.|$|E

5|$|By 1537 {{the area}} {{immediately}} {{north of the}} new colony of Guatemala was being {{referred to as the}} Tierra de Guerra ("Land of War"). Paradoxically, it was simultaneously known as Verapaz ("True Peace"). The Land of War described an <b>area</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> undergoing conquest; it was a region of dense forest that was difficult for the Spanish to penetrate militarily. Whenever the Spanish located a centre of population in this region, the inhabitants were moved and concentrated in a new colonial settlement {{near the edge of the}} jungle where the Spanish could more easily control them. This strategy resulted in the gradual depopulation of the forest, simultaneously converting it into a wilderness refuge for those fleeing Spanish domination, both for individual refugees and for entire communities. The Land of War, from the 16th century through to the start of the 18th century, included a vast area from Sacapulas in the west to Nito on the Caribbean coast and extended northwards from Rabinal and Salamá, and was an intermediate area between the highlands and the northern lowlands.|$|E
5|$|In 1880, {{after the}} closing of his father's estate and sale his father's property, he moved west to {{homestead}} and farm at Manitoba, in the Little Saskatchewan district, near Minnedosa. A few years later, {{he had come to}} the realization that farming was not an efficient means of business for him; his farm had been situated in an <b>area</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> so far removed from a town that travel to deliver his products had been cumbersome. He then gained employment as a carpenter and builder with the Manitoba and North Western Railway, where he was tasked with building rail bridges and stations. He would later move to Winnipeg where he continued working in his field. He would join the contracting firm of Murray & McDermot, serving as foreman on various projects, including the building of the Manitoba Hotel. After some 13 years, he went to Carberry, Manitoba where he continued contracting, this time also entering the furniture business. In 1902, he would also be involved {{in the construction of the}} Union Bank building there.|$|E
5|$|In South America, C.dirus {{specimens}} {{dated to}} the Late Pleistocene were found {{along the north}} and west coasts, but none have been found in Argentina, an <b>area</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> inhabited by Canisgezi and Canis nehringi. One study found that C.dirus was the most evolutionarily derived Canis species in the New World, and compared to C.nehringi was larger in the size and construction of its lower molars for more efficient predation. For this reason, some researchers have proposed that C.dirus may have originated in South America. In 2009 a proposal was made that C.armbrusteri was the common ancestor for both the North and South American wolves. The following year, a study yielded evidence that led to the conclusion that C.dirus and C.nehringi were the same species and thus that C.dirus had migrated from North America into South America, making it a late participant in the Great American Interchange.|$|E
