50|$|Macadamia oil (or {{macadamia}} nut oil) is the non-volatile oil expressed from the nut meat of the macadamia (Macadamia integrifolia) tree, a native <b>Australian</b> <b>nut.</b> Macadamia oil is sometimes used in food as a frying or salad oil, and in cosmetic formulations as an emollient or fragrance fixative.|$|E
50|$|The Gardens {{includes}} {{native species}} and exotic plants {{from around the}} world, such as the <b>Australian</b> <b>nut</b> tree, a bunya-bunya tree, the largest Norfolk Island pine in Florida, bulrush, strangler figs, royal palms, selloums, banana trees, Peruvian apple cactus, and staghorn ferns, as well as native red maples, oaks and bald cypress.|$|E
50|$|Common {{names of}} the trees are, <b>Australian</b> <b>nut</b> and Queensland nut. Species are “smooth shelled macadamia” called Macadamia integrifolia and “rough shelled macadamia” called Macadamia tetraphylla. Macadamia ternifolia is also the name used for M. integrifolia. Macadamia integrifolia is native to Australia where it grows in rain forests and close to streams. Macadamia tetraphylla is native to Southeastern Queensland and Northeastern New South Wales. The oil content ranges from 65% to 75% and sugar content ranges from 6% to 8%. These factors result in {{variable}} colors and texture when the nuts are roasted under the same conditions.|$|E

50|$|From 1931 the Queensland Department of Agriculture and Stock {{began to}} promote {{macadamia}} tree cultivation {{as an adjunct}} to other farming activities. By November 1933 south-east Queensland growers were having success planting macadamia trees between banana plants, in anticipation that the macadamias would become commercially viable when the bananas began to decline. Reflecting this surge in the industry, the <b>Australian</b> <b>Nut</b> Association was established in 1932 to foster the wider growing of macadamia nuts, although it failed after ten years. Notably for the H2 Hinde macadamia trees growing on Colliston, in 1939 William Hill, then manager of Colliston, and Michael Hinde's brother George, provided assistance with a Queensland Agricultural Journal article identifying where the trees grew wild in the Gilston district and discussing their potential for commercial growing. This was to begin a long association between the managers of Colliston {{and the author of the}} article, John McGregor Wills, the State's Senior Advisor in Horticulture who became a great supporter of the commercial potential of the nut.|$|E

40|$|Background Sequence {{data from}} the {{chloroplast}} genome have {{played a central role}} in elucidating the evolutionary history of flowering plants, Angiospermae. In the past decade, the number of complete chloroplast genomes has burgeoned, leading to well-supported angiosperm phylogenies. However, some relationships, particulary among early-diverging lineages, remain unresolved. The diverse Southern Hemisphere plant family Proteaceae arose on the ancient supercontinent Gondwana early in angiosperm history and is a model group for adaptive radiation in response to changing climatic conditions. Genomic resources for the family are limited, and until now it is one of the few early-diverging 2 ̆ 7 basal eudicot 2 ̆ 7 lineages not represented in chloroplast phylogenomic analyses. Results The chloroplast genome of the <b>Australian</b> <b>nut</b> crop tree Macadamia integrifolia was assembled de novo from Illumina paired-end sequence reads. Three contigs, corresponding to a collapsed inverted repeat, a large and a small single copy region were identified, and used for genome reconstruction. The complete genome is 159, 714 bp in length and was assembled at deep coverage (3. 29 million reads; 2000 x). Phylogenetic analyses based on 83 -gene and inverted repeat region alignments, the largest sequence-rich datasets to include the basal eudicot family Proteaceae, provide strong support for a Proteales clade that includes Macadamia, Platanus and Nelumbo. Genome structure and content followed the ancestral angiosperm pattern and were highly conserved in the Proteales, whilst size differences were largely explained by the relative contraction of the single copy regions and expansion of the inverted repeats in Macadamia. Conclusions The Macadamia chloroplast genome presented here is the first in the Proteaceae, and confirms the placement of this family with the morphologically divergent Plantanaceae (plane tree family) and Nelumbonaceae (sacred lotus family) in the basal eudicot order Proteales. It provides a high-quality reference genome for future evolutionary studies and will be of benefit for taxon-rich phylogenomic analyses aimed at resolving relationships among early-diverging angiosperms, and more broadly across the plant tree of life...|$|E

50|$|The H2 Hinde tree (Macadamia integrifolia), , which survives on Colliston is {{significant}} {{to the commercial}} development of the <b>Australian</b> macadamia <b>nut</b> industry, particularly its establishment phase from the 1960s to the 1980s. Only two Australian-grown varieties of macadamia received official endorsement and gained popularity with commercial orchards throughout this State, as well as New South Wales, following extensive experimentation {{on a range of}} scion and stock material conducted by the Queensland Department of Agriculture and Stock in the late 1940s and throughout the 1950s. The H2 Hinde at Colliston is the parent tree of one of these two varieties. Since World War II, due to determined efforts on the part of government and commercial groups, the macadamia nut industry has become Australia's largest bush foods industry and dominates the world macadamia export market. The H2 Hinde tree cultivated at Colliston has {{played a key role in}} this success, first as scion wood, and in the last twenty years, as the parent of most rootstock used to propagate the large majority of commercial orchard macadamia trees in Australia.|$|R
40|$|Diseases of Fruit Crops in Australia {{is the new}} {{standard}} reference in applied plant pathology in Australia covering important diseases affecting {{the broad range of}} fruit and nut crops grown throughout Australia. It is an essential tool for growers, horticulturists, crop consultants, research scientists, plant pathologists, quarantine officers, agribusiness representatives, pest management personnel, educators and students. The book is generously illustrated with high quality colour images to help diagnose diseases. It explains how to identify and manage each disease, describing the symptoms, its importance, the source of infection and spread, and control measures. Based on the highly regarded 1993 edition of Diseases of Fruit Crops, this new work updates management practices that have evolved since then.

40|$|To date, the Australian {{macadamia}} {{industry has}} not been able to obtain reliable sensory measurements (hedonic and diagnostic) that could be linked to processing and other quality criteria. This study measured consumer preferences for <b>Australian</b> macadamia <b>nuts</b> using consumer preference testing and descriptive sensory profiling. Macadamia were subjected to three main treatments: roast – five levels (raw, 135 °C- 12 min, 135 °C- 18 min, 155 °C- 5 min, 155 °C 8 min), size – three levels (17 mm, 19 mm, 21 mm diameter), and age – three levels (0 weeks, 12 weeks at 40 °C, 12 weeks at 40 °C + 2 weeks at 50 °C). Macadamia kernels were obtained from nine sources (combinations of region/site/cultivar) to investigate possible source variation in sensory quality. The sensory panel was trained to provide diagnostic measures of sensory character and this information was combined with consumer preference data to determine the sensory drivers of consumer preference. Overall, consumers preferred roasted macadamia and the level of roast (temperature x time) was an important means of controlling preferred odour and colour characteristics. Consumers also preferred 19 and 21 mm diameter kernel and discerned differences in the odour quality of fresh and aged kernel. All kernel sources were equally preferred by consumers. The trained panel successfully diagnosed each product treatment in terms of sensory character. Two levels of roasting, varying in temperature and time (135 °C for 18 min or 155 °C for 8 min), had a similar effect on the sensory character of macadamia kernel. While the peroxide value of kernel aged for 14 weeks was within the range of commercially acceptable samples, the trained panel detected a stale/rancid odour, flavour and aftertaste in this kernel. Specific attributes of odour, appearance, flavour, texture and aftertaste that drive consumer preference were identified by combining trained panel diagnostic assessments with consumer preference judgements...|$|R
