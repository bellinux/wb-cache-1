5|$|The freeway {{was built}} in phases with the {{frontage}} roads constructed first followed by the main lanes. The overpasses for Wiseman Boulevard, Westover Hills Boulevard and Military Drive between I-410 and Loop1604 were completed over the main lanes of SH151 in 1987. In 1988, the I-410 overpasses over the SH151 frontage roads were completed, as was the interchange with US90 at the eastern terminus. Also completed in 1988 were the frontage road bridges over Leon <b>and</b> <b>Slick</b> Ranch Creek, which enabled traffic to travel the entire corridor from Loop1604 to US90 {{by way of the}} frontage roads. The main lane overpasses at FM1957 (Potranco Road) and Ingram Road were completed in 1997. The overpasses at Pinn Road and Enrique M. Barrera Parkway were completed in 1998, and completed at Callaghan Road in 2000. Construction of the freeway was completed in 2004.|$|E
5|$|After {{the very}} warm {{practice}} sessions, qualifying on Saturday was run under difficult weather conditions. Qualifying one (Q1) {{started on a}} damp track and therefore on intermediate tyres, while by Q2 the track was almost dry <b>and</b> <b>slick</b> tyres were used. In Q1 Romain Grosjean collided with the slower running HRT of Pedro de la Rosa and lost his front wing. While he succeeded in nursing the car back into the pit lane, {{he was unable to}} change his tyres and was therefore left in a disappointing 18th position on the grid. Michael Schumacher's last ever qualifying did not go well either. He took 14th position, almost half a second down on his teammate, admitting he had perhaps compromised his setup too much for an expected wet race. The McLarens were fastest all weekend and easily took the front row, with Lewis Hamilton securing his last pole position with the team. Title contenders Vettel and Alonso both struggled, taking 4th and 8th position on the grid respectively. Pastor Maldonado was handed a 10-place grid penalty for missing the weighbridge {{in the second part of}} qualifying. He dropped from sixth to 16th, moving Alonso one place up to seventh.|$|E
5|$|Aside from tidal {{flooding}} along rivers, the storm's {{effects were}} primarily concentrated along the coast. A buoy {{off the coast}} of Nova Scotia reported a wave height of , the highest ever recorded in the province's offshore waters. In the middle of the storm, Andrea Gail sank, killing her crew of six and inspiring the book, and later movie, The Perfect Storm. Off the shore of New York's Long Island, an Air National Guard helicopter ran out of fuel and crashed; four members of its crew were rescued, and one was killed. Two people died after their boat sank off Staten Island. High waves swept two people to their deaths, one in Rhode Island and one in Puerto Rico, and another person was blown off a bridge to his death. The tropical cyclone that formed late in the storm's duration caused little impact, limited to power outages <b>and</b> <b>slick</b> roads; one person was killed in Newfoundland from a traffic accident related to the storm.|$|E

25|$|Hagler, {{a natural}} southpaw, opened the fight boxing {{out of an}} {{orthodox}} stance. After the quick <b>and</b> <b>slick</b> Leonard won {{the first two rounds}} on all three scorecards, Hagler started the third round as a southpaw. Hagler did better, though Leonard's superior speed and boxing skill kept him in the fight. But by the fifth, Leonard, who was moving a lot, began to tire and Hagler started to get closer. As he tired Leonard began to clinch with more frequency (in total referee Richard Steele gave him over 30 warnings for holding, although never deducted a point). Hagler buckled Leonard's knees with a right uppercut {{near the end of the}} round, which finished with Leonard on the ropes. Hagler continued to score effectively in round six. Leonard, having slowed down, was obliged to fight more and run less.|$|E
25|$|The {{root cause}} of the {{accident}} was attributed to {{the driver of the}} automobile, Juan Manuel Álvarez of Compton, California, who deliberately drove and left his vehicle onto the tracks while allegedly attempting to commit suicide. Having slashed his wrists and stabbed himself repeatedly in the chest, he parked his car on the tracks to finish the attempt. However, Álvarez changed his mind and attempted to leave the railroad tracks. Because he was unable to dislodge his vehicle from the rain-soaked gravel <b>and</b> <b>slick</b> rails, he abandoned the vehicle moments before the crowded southbound train approached. However, there has been some speculation that Álvarez may have inflicted the wounds on himself after the crash, based on some early reports by witnesses. Both this causation and the end result have many similarities to that of the Ufton Nervet rail crash in the United Kingdom, which occurred only three months previously, although in that case the driver of the car stayed in the vehicle and was killed.|$|E
25|$|The legendary Bill Russell {{was hired}} as the head coach in the {{following}} year, and in 1975 he coached the SuperSonics to {{the playoffs for the}} first time. The team, which starred Haywood, guards Fred Brown <b>and</b> <b>Slick</b> Watts, and rookie center Tommy Burleson, defeated the Detroit Pistons in a three-game mini-series before falling to the eventual champion Golden State Warriors in six games. The next season, the SuperSonics traded Haywood to New York forcing the remaining players to pick up the offensive slack. Guard Fred Brown, now in his fifth season, was selected to the 1976 NBA All-Star Game and finished fifth in the league in scoring average and free throw percentage. Burleson's game continued to strengthen, while Watts led the NBA in both assists and steals and was named to the All-NBA Defensive First Team. The SuperSonics again made the playoffs, but lost to the Phoenix Suns in six games in spite of strong performances from both Brown (28.5 ppg) and Burleson (20.8 ppg) during the series.|$|E

All teams, except Toyota, took part in the testing session where some teams tested their new aerodynamics package <b>and</b> <b>slick</b> tyres. The new look cars did not suit everyone's taste, with BMW Sauber's test driver, Christian Klien, labelling the car the ugliest car he'd ever seen. On 9 March, testing at Barcelona featured for the first time Brawn GP, who made an immediate impact by leading the times early in the day. The test, the first in which all teams used their 2009 cars, had BMW Sauber leading the times while Brawn GP finished fourth. On day three, Brawn GP's Jenson Button was fastest by just over one second to Ferrari's Felipe Massa, while Button's teammate Rubens Barrichello went even faster the next day. At {{the other end of the}} timing sheets, reigning Champion Lewis Hamilton's McLaren team were struggling to adapt to the new regulations, often 1.5 seconds off the pace.
