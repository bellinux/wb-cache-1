5|$|I {{wanted it}} to be almost like <b>a</b> <b>photo</b> <b>album,</b> so every single scene is kind of like a picture that you're kind of looking into our relationship. So it is a 1920s vibe, it's black and white, very high fashion—you know, you'll see me very dapper in 1920s, Frank Sinatra-ish. So you'll see the cars from that era, you'll {{definitely}} feel the vibe of the house having that 1920s vibe as well. So it's very different and very intimate, and it's not a lot of dancing—it's more personal.|$|E
5|$|Scully and Doggett {{arrive at}} the crime scene in Idaho and meet Detective Yale Abbott. He says they are less sure that the bites were made by a human and draws their {{attention}} to the strange footprint, believing that wild animals fed on the bodies after the fact. Scully points out {{that there is only one}} footprint, which looks ominously human, and that if it were left by an animal there would be more footprints leading to the bodies. Scully and Doggett check out the house and find prints leading upstairs and into the attic. Inside, Scully and Doggett find the missing fingers of the undertaker. They look like they have been regurgitated by something and the claw marks in the attic suggest something was hanging from the rafters. Meanwhile, elderly Mrs. McKesson is killed in her attic while looking at <b>a</b> <b>photo</b> <b>album.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Switch's user {{interface}} features tile-based access to games {{that are either}} present in the game card slot or stored within the unit's storage devices. It includes quick access buttons for a News feed from Nintendo, eShop access, and <b>a</b> <b>photo</b> <b>album</b> for screenshots captured during gameplay; the 4.0 update to the software in October 2017 also enabled capturing and sharing video from select games. A single Switch console supports up to eight user profiles, which each can be tied to a Nintendo Account user ID. Profiles can be represented by either a pre-made avatar from an internal gallery, or using a Mii. The Mii creator was upgraded with increased color options for aspects such as hair styles; however, it is integrated into the system settings, rather than being an independent application.|$|E

500|$|Agrippa (A Book of the Dead) {{is a work}} of art {{created by}} science fiction novelist William Gibson, artist Dennis Ashbaugh and {{publisher}} Kevin Begos Jr. in 1992. The work consists of a 300-line semi-autobiographical electronic poem by Gibson, embedded in an artist's book by Ashbaugh. Gibson's text focused on the ethereal nature of memories (the title is taken from <b>a</b> <b>photo</b> <b>album).</b> Its principal notoriety arose {{from the fact that the}} poem, stored on a 3.5" [...] floppy disk, was programmed to encrypt itself after a single use; similarly, the pages of the artist's book were treated with photosensitive chemicals, effecting the gradual fading of the words and images from the book's first exposure to light.|$|E

500|$|The DVD boxset for season eight was {{released}} by 20th Century Fox in the United States and Canada on August 15, 2006, nine years after it had completed broadcast on television. As well as every episode from the season, the DVD release features bonus material including deleted scenes, Animatics, and commentaries for every episode. As with the previous season, the set {{was released}} in two different packagings: a [...] "Collector's Edition" [...] plastic packaging molded to look like Maggie's head, and a standard rectangular cardboard box featuring Maggie looking through <b>a</b> <b>photo</b> <b>album</b> {{while the rest of}} the Simpsons family are taking a picture. The menus continue the same format from the previous three seasons, and the overall theme is various characters posing for photographs.|$|E
500|$|The video {{opens with}} a cover of <b>a</b> <b>photo</b> <b>album,</b> {{superimposed}} with a scene of two children from the videos of [...] "Vogue" [...] and [...] "Far Away". It then has a blurry image of Hamasaki in the post-apocalyptic city, which has now left behind a series of hills. As Hamasaki walks towards the camera, the photo album opens with the city before its destruction. Hamasaki {{stands in the middle}} of a grainy surface, with projectile flames coming from underneath the ground. As she sings, scenes from the [...] "Vogue" [...] and [...] "Far Away" [...] videos appear in the photo album. She walks through the hill surface, finding the photo album the two children left behind. She opens the book, and witnesses the [...] "Vogue" [...] video. The final scene has Hamasaki close the book, which its back cover is a title-less shot of the artwork to [...] "Vogue".|$|E
500|$|A {{particularly}} well-received work by Gibson was Agrippa (a {{book of the}} dead) (1992), a 300-line semi-autobiographical electronic {{poem that}} was his contribution to a collaborative project with artist Dennis Ashbaugh and publisher Kevin Begos, Jr. Gibson's text focused on the ethereal nature of memories (the title refers to <b>a</b> <b>photo</b> <b>album)</b> and was originally published on a 3.5" [...] floppy disk embedded {{in the back of}} an artist's book containing etchings by Ashbaugh (intended to fade from view once the book was opened and exposed to light — they never did, however). Gibson commented that Ashbaugh's design [...] "eventually included a supposedly self-devouring floppy-disk intended to display the text only once, then eat itself." [...] Contrary to numerous colorful reports, the diskettes were never actually [...] "hacked"; instead the poem was manually transcribed from a surreptitious videotape of a public showing in Manhattan in December 1992, and released on the MindVox bulletin board the next day; this is the text that circulated widely on the Internet.|$|E

500|$|The {{accompanying}} music video, {{directed by}} Alek Keshishian, was filmed in June 1992 at Raleigh Studios in Hollywood, California and Malibu Beach. It premiered on MTV on June 30, 1992, {{a day before}} the release of A League of Their Own. The video shows a man viewing <b>a</b> <b>photo</b> <b>album,</b> as Madonna sings in different settings from within the various pictures. Scenes from A League of Their Own also appear on the album during the song's instrumental break. As the video ends, the man having {{reached the end of}} the album, then scrolls backwards through the previous pages. The video was commercially released in 2004 as a bonus feature on the 2-disc special edition DVD of A League of Their Own. According to Rettenmund, unlike most music videos related to film soundtracks, [...] "This Used to Be My Playground" [...] did not give emphasis on having shots from the film in the video itself. Instead Keshishian and Madonna chose introspection as the theme, with simple images to portray them. Rettenmund notes, [...] "At the end, the man who has been looking back at his scrapbook of Madonna lays his head down, sealing the video with the perfect bit of sadness to resonate with Madonna's ennui." ...|$|E
500|$|Gough and Millar {{had five}} months for casting, but their primary {{focus was on}} finding an actor to play Clark Kent. They {{received}} Kristin Kreuk's audition tape {{for the role of}} Lana Lang and liked it so much that they immediately showed her to the network. Tom Welling, after twice turning down the producers' attempts to get him to audition for the role of Clark Kent, eventually accepted the opportunity {{to be part of the}} show. It was David Nutter who finally convinced Welling to read the script for the pilot, after finding Welling's picture in <b>a</b> <b>photo</b> <b>album</b> at the casting director's office. Welling's manager did not want him to take the role because it could hurt his feature film career, but Welling liked the script and agreed to come in for an audition. Welling's reason for turning down the role was because the producers were keeping quiet on what the show was really about, which left him with the impression the show was going to be [...] "Superman in high school", something he did not want to do. Nutter promised to let Welling read the script if he came in and auditioned. After auditioning, Welling was given the script to read, which he thought was [...] "amazing". For one of his auditions, he read the graveyard scene, from the pilot, with Kristin Kreuk; the network thought they had [...] "great chemistry". No one could agree on which actors had the best audition for Lex Luthor. Michael Rosenbaum auditioned twice, and, believing he did not take his first audition seriously, outlined a two-and-a-half-page scene from the pilot. He indicated all the places to be funny, charismatic, or menacing, and performed so well that everyone agreed he was [...] "the guy".|$|E
