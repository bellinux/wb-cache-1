40|$|This paper {{presents}} global tracking {{strategies for}} the attitude dynamics of a rigid body. It {{is well known that}} global attractivity is prohibited for continuous <b>attitude</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> on the special orthogonal group. Such topological restriction has been dealt with either by constructing smooth <b>attitude</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> that exclude a set of measure zero in the region of attraction, or by introducing hybrid <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> to obtain global asymptotic stability. This paper proposes alternative <b>attitude</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> that are continuous in time to achieve exponential stability, where the region of attraction covers the entire special orthogonal group. The main contribution of this paper is providing a new framework to overcome the topological restriction in <b>attitude</b> <b>controls</b> without relying on discontinuities through the controlled maneuvers. The efficacy of the proposed methods is illustrated by numerical simulations and experiments...|$|R

5|$|The {{attitude}} was controlled with three hydrazine thrusters. The satellite transmitted data {{back to the}} ground with S-Band and Very High Frequency (VHF) transmitters, at a rate of 15 Mbit/s and 6 bit quantization. The satellite had three-axis fine attitude control with four wheels, which gave it +/- 0.7 degrees of control. The <b>attitude</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> also used horizon scanners, sun sensors, and a command antenna. A freon gas propulsion system allowed the satellite to make fine attitude adjustments. Landsat 2 could store 30 minutes worth of data on two wide-band video tape recorders.|$|E
5|$|Thrust {{vectoring}} {{was used}} to provide attitude control {{on the first two}} stages. The eight first stage combustion chambers were arranged in pairs which could gimbal either way along one axis. Two of the pairs were arranged perpendicular to the other two, and when all four pairs were used together, they provided roll, pitch and yaw control. The second stage had two combustion chambers, which could gimbal along two axes, providing the same level of control. During a coast phase after second stage cut-off, the rocket was controlled by a reaction control system. The third stage did not have an <b>attitude</b> <b>control</b> <b>system,</b> and was instead spin-stabilised.|$|E

The spacecraft was equipped with a liquid propellant engine to perform rendezvous, and to reboost the space station. The other proposal was for a new spacecraft to be built for unmanned missions, but re-using as many Gemini systems as possible. It would have had a higher cargo capacity than the stripped-down version of the Gemini spacecraft.|$|E

25|$|On May 24, Midas 2 was orbited successfully, but the <b>attitude</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> failed. Some {{data was}} {{returned}} by the infrared sensor before the telemetry system also failed. Several planned experiments such as detection of flares {{on the ground}} and a Titan I missile test were abandoned. The next launch in the series did not take place for over a year and the program now moved to the West Coast, with Point Arguello's SLC-3 1-2 being its base of operations. During this interval, two CORONA satellites also carried and tested Midas sensors. Midas 3, the first operational model, was launched on July 24, 1961 using the new, restartable Agena B stage. The Atlas's programmer reset itself due to a malfunction during booster jettison, but the satellite reached orbit successfully. However, one solar panel failed to deploy, starving Midas 3 of electrical power and it died after a few orbits. Midas 4 (October 21) brought about further frustration when the Atlas lost roll control at T+186 seconds. The satellite was placed into an incorrect trajectory, causing the Agena to exhaust its attitude control gas trying to compensate during its two burns. By the time Midas 4 reached its intended transfer orbit, there was no attitude control gas left and the satellite could not be stabilized. It did manage to detect a Titan I launch from Cape Canaveral before one solar panel failed. A week into the mission, Midas 4 died when its batteries ran down.|$|E

500|$|The Apollo 16 mission {{launched}} from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida at 12:54 PM EST on April 16, 1972. The launch was nominal; the crew experienced vibration {{similar to that}} of previous crews. The first and second stages of the Saturn V rocket performed nominally; the spacecraft entered orbit around Earth just under 12 minutes after lift-off. After reaching orbit, the crew spent time adapting to the zero-gravity environment and preparing the spacecraft for Trans Lunar Injection (TLI), the burn of the third-stage rocket that would propel them to the Moon. In Earth orbit, the crew faced minor technical issues, including a potential problem with the environmental control system and the S-IVB third stage's <b>attitude</b> <b>control</b> <b>system,</b> but eventually resolved or compensated for them as they prepared to depart towards the Moon. After two orbits, the rocket's third stage reignited for just over five minutes, propelling the craft towards the Moon at about [...] Six minutes after the burn of the S-IVB, the Command/Service Module, containing the crew, separated from the rocket and traveled for [...] before turning around and retrieving the Lunar Module from inside the expended rocket stage. The maneuver, known as transposition, went smoothly and the LM was extracted from the S-IVB. Following transposition and docking, the crew noticed the exterior surface of the Lunar Module was giving off particles from a spot where the LM's skin appeared torn or shredded; at one point, Duke estimated they were seeing about five to ten particles per second. The crew entered the Lunar Module through the docking tunnel connecting it with the Command Module to inspect its systems, at which time they did not spot any major issues. Once on course towards the Moon, the crew put the spacecraft into a rotisserie [...] "barbecue" [...] mode in which the craft rotated along its long axis three times per hour to ensure even heat distribution about the spacecraft from the Sun. After further preparing the craft for the voyage, the crew began the first sleep period of the mission just under 15 hours after launch.|$|E
