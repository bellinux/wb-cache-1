5|$|Similar {{budgetary}} difficulties {{were being}} faced by other nations with space station projects, prompting <b>American</b> <b>government</b> officials to start negotiations with partners in Europe, Russia, Japan, and Canada {{in the early}} 1990s to begin a collaborative, multi-national, space station project.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} {{national conference}} was also {{held at the}} hotel by the <b>American</b> <b>government</b> in 1980. In the late 1980s a supposed secret meeting {{was held at the}} hotel by three Republicans—Richard V. Allen, Laurence H. Silberman and Robert McFarlane—with an Iranian emissary. From its opening until May 2005, the hotel was managed by Loews Hotels. For the next five years, it was managed by Crestline Hotels & Resorts, but the Davidson Hotel Company assumed control of its operations in July 2010.|$|E

5|$|Lyon {{also has}} the {{distinction}} of being the only person to be elected to Congress while in jail. On October 10, 1798, he was found guilty of violating the Alien and Sedition Acts, which prohibited malicious writing about the <b>American</b> <b>government</b> as a whole, or of the houses of Congress, or of the president. During the Quasi War with France, Lyon {{was the first person to}} be put to trial for violating the acts after he published editorials criticizing Federalist President John Adams.|$|E

5|$|The project {{also served}} as a {{political}} ruse {{on the part of the}} <b>American</b> <b>government,</b> providing a diplomatic channel for NASA to take part in the funding of the cripplingly under-funded Russian space program. This in turn allowed the newly fledged Russian government to keep Mir operating, in addition to the Russian space program as a whole, ensuring the Russian government remained (and remains) friendly towards the United States.|$|E
5|$|There {{was a lot}} {{of popular}} and {{government}} interest at the time in quantum mechanics – the <b>American</b> <b>government</b> was financing research at SRI into telepathy – and physicists able to understand it found themselves in demand. The Fundamental Fysiks Group used ideas from quantum physics, particularly Bell's theorem and quantum entanglement, to explore issues such as action at a distance, clairvoyance, precognition, remote viewing and psychokinesis.|$|E
5|$|Alarmed, the American {{ambassador}} to Brazil sent a cablegram to his Department of State in September 1906, warning {{them of the}} destabilization that would occur if the situation devolved into a full naval arms race. At the same time, the <b>American</b> <b>government</b> under Theodore Roosevelt tried using diplomatic means to coerce the Brazilians into canceling their ships, but the attempts were dismissed, with the Baron of Rio Branco remarking that caving to the American demands would render Brazil as powerless as suzerain Cuba. The President of Brazil, Afonso Pena, supported the naval acquisitions in {{an address to the}} National Congress of Brazil in November 1906, as in his opinion the ships were necessary to replace the antiquated and obsolete vessels of the current navy.|$|E

5|$|Although other retired {{high-ranking}} officers, including generals James Gavin and Matthew Ridgway, joined Shoup in this, it was Shoup's pointed criticisms {{that regularly}} made {{the front pages}} of newspapers, because they went beyond the war to <b>American</b> <b>government,</b> business, and military leadership. He feared the conflict had endangered the nation's historical identity, and argued increasing the troop levels in Vietnam would only aggravate the strategic problems there. Historian Robert Buzzanco noted that Shoup may have been the most vocal former military member to oppose the war.|$|E
5|$|As a lawyer, Sawyer {{focused on}} civil {{litigation}} in corporate law, {{at which he}} excelled. He also {{spent much of his}} time in the field of civil liberties, for which he became more well-known but less well-compensated. In 1953, he was one of several defense attorneys in the case of United States v. Kuzma, a prosecution of Communist sympathizers under the Smith Act, which barred anyone from advocating for the overthrow of the <b>American</b> <b>government.</b> The defendants were found guilty, but their convictions were reversed in 1957 after the United States Supreme Court overturned the Smith Act in Yates v. United States.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th and the {{beginning}} of the 20th centuries, Chile was engaged in an intense naval competition with its neighbor Argentina. This ended peacefully in 1902, but less than a decade later Argentina responded to Brazil's order for two dreadnoughts with two of its own. The Chilean congress responded by allocating money for its own dreadnoughts, which were ordered from the United Kingdom despite a strong push from the <b>American</b> <b>government</b> for the contracts, probably due to Chile's traditionally strong ties with the British.|$|E

5|$|OSI is an American {{progressive}} rock band, originally {{formed by}} Fates Warning guitarist Jim Matheos in 2002. Chroma Key keyboardist and vocalist Kevin Moore {{is the only}} other full-time member of the band. The collaboration may be considered a studio project, as its members and contributors write and track most of their material independently, sharing and developing tracks long-distance, only coming together {{at the end of}} the process for mixing and additional tracking. The band's name is a reference to the Office of Strategic Influence, a short-lived <b>American</b> <b>government</b> agency formed in 2001 to support the War on Terror through propaganda. The band has featured a number of guest musicians on its albums, including Sean Malone, Steven Wilson, Mikael Åkerfeldt, Joey Vera and Gavin Harrison.|$|E
5|$|On February 18, 1898, Muñoz Rivera's son, Luis Muñoz Marín, was born. By {{this time}} the family had moved to Old San Juan, where Luis was born. On February 16, 1898, Barbosa rushed to Muñoz Rivera's home. He had just learned that the American vessel USS Maine had sunk {{off the coast of}} Cuba, which would most likely spark a war between Spain and the United States. Barbosa {{expected}} the <b>American</b> <b>government</b> to grant Puerto Rico autonomy if they gained control. However, Muñoz Rivera was saddened by the news, knowing that the United States was planning to build a canal in Panama, and that Puerto Rico would be a strategic location to protect the structure. Barbosa insisted that this would not happen, continuing his support towards a military operation.|$|E

5|$|The <b>American</b> <b>government</b> saw the {{evacuation}} {{as an opportunity}} to weaken the communists by providing for and thereby winning the loyalty of the refugees to the anti-communist cause. The United States Operation Mission proposed that aside from helping to evacuate refugees to the south and thereby draining the communist population base, the Americans should provide healthcare, shelter, food and clothing in order to help the anti-communists win the fidelity of their compatriots. Another benefit of participating in {{the evacuation}} was that American personnel would be on the ground in North Vietnam, allowing them to gather intelligence on communist activities.|$|E
5|$|The convoy {{had also}} been {{augmented}} by the United States government, in both cargo and shipping, as repayment for French financial, moral and military support during the American Revolution. In supporting the French Revolution in this way, the <b>American</b> <b>government,</b> urged especially by Ambassador Gouverneur Morris, was fulfilling its ten-year-old debt to France. Friendly relations between the United States and France did not long survive the Jay Treaty which came into effect in 1796; by 1798 the two nations would be engaged in the Quasi War.|$|E
