5|$|Inbreeding {{depression}} {{occurs in}} the great tit (Parus major) when the offspring produced {{as a result of}} a mating between close relatives show reduced fitness.

5|$|According to {{historian}} John V. A.

He was perhaps elevated to the position of despot of Vidin soon after the accession of another Bulgarian noble of Cuman origin, George Terter I (r. 1280–1292), to the Bulgarian throne in 1280. Shishman was likely <b>a</b> <b>close</b> <b>relative,</b> perhaps even a brother, of George Terter I.|$|E
5|$|In general, Megalosaurus had {{the typical}} build {{of a large}} theropod. It was bipedal, the {{horizontal}} torso being balanced by a long horizontal tail. The hindlimbs were long and strong with three forward-facing weight-bearing toes, the forelimbs relatively short but exceptionally robust and probably carrying three digits. Being a carnivore, its large elongated head bore long dagger-like teeth to slice the flesh of its prey. The skeleton of Megalosaurus is highly ossified, indicating a robust and muscular animal, though the lower leg was not as heavily built as that of Torvosaurus, <b>a</b> <b>close</b> <b>relative.</b>|$|E

5|$|Newton's parakeet (Psittacula exsul), {{also known}} as the Rodrigues parakeet or Rodrigues ring-necked parakeet, is an extinct species of parrot that was endemic to the Mascarene island of Rodrigues in the western Indian Ocean. Several of its {{features}} diverged from related species, indicating long-term isolation on Rodrigues and subsequent adaptation. The rose-ringed parakeet of the same genus is <b>a</b> <b>close</b> <b>relative</b> and probable ancestor. Newton's parakeet may itself have been ancestral to the endemic parakeets of nearby Mauritius and Réunion.|$|E
5|$|The role of {{the main}} {{caregiver}} is often taken by the spouse or <b>a</b> <b>close</b> <b>relative.</b> Alzheimer's disease is known for placing a great burden on caregivers which includes social, psychological, physical or economic aspects. Home care is usually preferred by people with AD and their families. This option also delays or {{eliminates the need for}} more professional and costly levels of care. Nevertheless, two-thirds of nursing home residents have dementias.|$|E
5|$|Torosaurus is a ceratopsid genus first {{identified}} {{from a pair}} of skulls in 1891, {{two years}} after the identification of Triceratops. The Torosaurus genus resembles Triceratops in geological age, distribution, anatomy and physical size and it has been recognised as <b>a</b> <b>close</b> <b>relative.</b> Its distinguishing features are an elongated skull and the presence of two fenestrae, or holes, in the frill. Paleontologists investigating dinosaur ontogeny (growth and development of individuals over the life span) in the Hell Creek Formation, Montana, US, have recently presented evidence that the two represent a single genus.|$|E

5|$|A similar {{cladogram}} {{was published}} in 2007, inverting the placement of Goura and Dicunculus and including the pheasant pigeon (Otidiphaps nobilis) and the thick-billed ground pigeon (Trugon terrestris) {{at the base of}} the clade. Based on behavioural and morphological evidence, Jolyon C. Parish proposed that the dodo and Rodrigues solitaire should be placed in the Gourinae subfamily along with the Groura pigeons and others, in agreement with the genetic evidence. In 2014, DNA of the only known specimen of the recently extinct spotted green pigeon (Caloenas maculata) was analysed, and it was found to be <b>a</b> <b>close</b> <b>relative</b> of the Nicobar pigeon, and thus also the dodo and Rodrigues solitaire.|$|E
5|$|Its {{large size}} {{may have been}} due to climactic factors and the {{abundance}} of large prey items, and it may have also been influenced by the evolution of regional endothermy (mesothermy) which would have increased its metabolism. However, since the Otodontidae sharks are considered to have been ectotherms, and megalodon was <b>a</b> <b>close</b> <b>relative</b> to them, megalodon may have also been ectothermic. Contrary to this, the largest contemporary ectothermic sharks, such as the whale shark, are filter feeders, implying some metabolic constraints with a predatory lifestyle. That is to say, it is unlikely that megalodon was ectothermic.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{paleontology}} {{has often}} classified Archaeopteryx {{as the most}} primitive bird. It is not {{thought to be a}} true ancestor of modern birds, but rather, <b>a</b> <b>close</b> <b>relative</b> of that ancestor. Nonetheless, Archaeopteryx was often used as a model of the true ancestral bird. Several authors have done so. Lowe (1935) and Thulborn (1984) questioned whether Archaeopteryx truly was the first bird. They suggested that Archaeopteryx was a dinosaur that was no more closely related to birds than were other dinosaur groups. Kurzanov (1987) suggested that Avimimus was more likely to be the ancestor of all birds than Archaeopteryx. Barsbold (1983) and Zweers and Van den Berge (1997) noted that many maniraptoran lineages are extremely birdlike, and they suggested that different groups of birds may have descended from different dinosaur ancestors.|$|E

5|$|Originally, Opisthocoelicaudia was {{classified}} {{as a member of}} the family Camarasauridae, together with Camarasaurus and Euhelopus. This classification was based on several shared features of the skeleton, most importantly the forked neural spines of the back vertebrae. In 1977, Borsuk-Białynicka considered Opisthocoelicaudia closer to Euhelopus than to Camarasaurus, placing it in the subfamily Euhelopodinae. A 1981 study by Walter Coombs and Ralph Molnar, on the other hand, considered it a member of the subfamily Camarasaurinae and therefore <b>a</b> <b>close</b> <b>relative</b> of Camarasaurus. Today, both Euhelopus and Opisthocoelicaudia are classified outside the Camarasauridae. In 1993, Leonardo Salgado and Rodolfo Coria showed Opisthocoelicaudia to represent a titanosaur and classified it within the family Titanosauridae. The name Titanosauridae is currently considered invalid by many scientists; instead, the name Lithostrotia is often used as an equivalent.|$|E
5|$|The Pacific swift has a {{very large}} range, {{exceeding}} 10,000,000km2 (3,800,000mi2). Its population is unknown, although it is common throughout its breeding range with {{no evidence of any}} decline. It is therefore classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of least concern. There appear to be no significant threats to this bird; predation is low, and this swift is not tied to a particular habitat. Some birds may die through misadventure or become exhausted when lost on migration (the first record for the Western Palaearctic was found resting on a North Sea gas platform), but swifts have high survival rates and are generally long-lived. The common swift, <b>a</b> <b>close</b> <b>relative</b> of the Pacific swift, has been recorded as reaching 21years old.|$|E
5|$|The Virgin Islands dwarf sphaero or Virgin Islands dwarf gecko (Sphaerodactylus parthenopion) is {{a species}} of gecko and {{also one of the}} {{smallest}} terrestrial vertebrates. It has only been found on three of the British Virgin Islands: Virgin Gorda, Tortola, and Moskito Island (also spelled “Mosquito Island”). It was discovered in 1964 and is suspected to be <b>a</b> <b>close</b> <b>relative</b> of Sphaerodactylus nicholsi, a dwarf sphaero from the nearby island of Puerto Rico. It shares its range with the big-scaled least gecko (S.macrolepis), which is found in leaf litter. Unlike this larger gecko, the Virgin Islands dwarf sphaero lives on drier hillsides, yet prefers moist microhabitats found under rocks because it lacks the adaptations necessary for preventing water loss, which is a significant problem due to its small body size.|$|E
