40|$|Abstract. In {{the fast}} moving {{technological}} world, few researchers {{are trying to}} formulate systems with <b>automatic</b> <b>mould</b> design processes {{in order to reduce}} mould design and development time and produce a consistent mould's quality. Currently, no commercial software are able to generate core and cavity without user intervention during the process. Thus, an algorithm is proposed in this research to automatically generate core and cavity of moulds by using slicing and Boolean-based approach. A 3 D moulded part in a standard CAD file format is used as an input for the algorithm and the output is presented as a set of core and cavity in 3 D model. Two criteria to define the best generated core and cavity are considered at this stage which is undercut and floating lump...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} both an algorithm for {{locating the}} minimum volume bounding box of three-dimensional CAD models and a fuzzy weighting scheme for <b>automatic</b> <b>mould</b> parting direction selection in computer-aided design of moulds and dies. When given a three-dimensional CAD {{model of a}} part, the proposed method is applied to find the minimum volume bounding box of the model. Three pairs of possible parting directions are then defined based on the bounding box surface normal. Criteria such as undercut, draw, projected area and designer's preference coded as fuzzy weighting factors are set-up {{for the evaluation of}} the most promising parting direction. Uncertainty that is assumed to be inherent in the assessments of the ratings and weights is accounted for by the proposed fuzzy heuristic. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} <b>automatic</b> <b>mould</b> parting direction selection in computer-aided design of moulds and dies. When given a three-dimensional CAD model, the minimum volume bounding box of the model is found first. Three pairs of possible parting directions are defined based on the bounding box surface normal vectors. They are in the length direction, the width direction and the height direction of the bounding box. Now, a dexel model is constructed along each parting direction. Parting lines corresponding to the three possible parting directions are estimated using a slice method. Finally, criteria such as undercut, draw, projected area and flatness in all parting directions are quantified using the dexel model of the part. A designer's preferences, coded as fuzzy weighting factors, are set-up {{for the evaluation of}} the most promising parting direction. Uncertainty that is assumed to be inherent in the assessments of the ratings and weights is accounted for by the proposed fuzzy heuristic. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Currently on the mould-making {{machines}} {{market the}} companies like: DiSA, KUENKEL WAGNER, HAFLINGER, HEINRICH WAGNER SINTO, HUNTER, SAVELLI AND TECHNICAL play significant role. These companies are {{the manufacturers of}} various solutions in machines and instalations applied in foundry engineering. Automatic foundry machines for compaction of green sand have the major role in mechanisation and automation processes of making the mould. The concept of operation of automatic machines {{is based on the}} static and dynamic methods of compacting the green sand. The method which gains the importance is the compacting method by using the energy of the air pressure. It's the initial stage or the supporting process of compacting the green sand. However in the <b>automatic</b> <b>mould</b> making machines using this method it's essential to use the additional compaction of the mass in order to receive the final parameters of the form. In the constructional solutions of the machines there is the additional division which concerns the method of putting the sand into the mould box. This division distinquishes the transport of the sand with simultaneous compaction or the putting of the sand without the pre-compaction. As the solutions of the major manufacturers are often the subject for application in various foundries, the authors of the paper would like/have the confidence to present their own evaluation process confirmed by their own researches and independent analysis of the producers' solutions...|$|R

2500|$|During 1967 through 1969 KMZ {{built an}} <b>automatic</b> {{die-cast}} <b>moulding</b> line, allowing mass camera production. Camera production {{switched to the}} M42×1 thread (also known as Praktica thread) and an instant-return mirror was also developed. This led {{to one of the}} most famous Zenits — Zenit-E which saw (including its subtypes) over 12 million produced. A heavy and tough camera with a mechanism that was of exceedingly simple design along the lines of [...] "what isn't there, can't go wrong". [...] Automatic diaphragm functionality was not available until the introduction of the Zenit-EM, which used a direct mechanism linking the shutter release button to the aperture mechanism, significantly increasing the effort required to release the shutter. [...] Production included both M39×1 and M42×1 mounts for the Zenit E and Zenit B models. [...] Later models were only produced in the M42×1 with the Pentax K mount available for the latest models.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} {{works is}} focused on design and fabrication of an <b>automatic</b> injection <b>moulding</b> tool for production of CAM BUSH which is used in electrical engines as a connector. An injection mould is a tool which is used for production of plastic components in large numbers in a short span of time. The moulding tool consists of the Top plate, Cavity plate, Core plate, Spacer blocks, Ejector plate and the Bottom plate. In this work, six core pins and six ejector pins are provided on injection mould because the required cam bush has six indexing holes. The material, Oil Hardened Non-shrinking Steel(OHNS) for the core and cavity, EN 353 for the guide pillar, guide bushes, core pins, ejector pins, locator ring and the sprue bush and Mild Steel for other plates are selected. The elements of injection moulding tool have been designed, fabricated and assembled. Submarine gate and Baffle circular hole cooling system has been provided in the moulding tool to increase the productivity and good surface finish. The required Nylon- 66 Cam bush component is produced with this moulding tool by properly controlling the various parameters of injection moulding machine...|$|R
40|$|Malleable iron {{lost the}} {{interest}} and the development stopped in the turbulent seventies of tremendous developments of new technologies. The personal computer, emission spectrometer, thermal analysis, cold-box core system and <b>automatic</b> vertical <b>moulding</b> were introduced into the foundry industry. Experience shows that these new technologies do not always match up with malleable iron. Solidification and mould filling simulation programs are not always capable to handle a low carbon equivalent iron like malleable iron. Recent developments show however by using these new technologies and combined with practical experience, {{it is possible to}} increase the casting yield of malleable iron to the same level as ductile iron. The mechanical properties, especially the yield strength of malleable iron according to the standard are equivalent to those of ductile iron, however the yield strength of oil quenched malleable iron is significantly higher than that of ductile iron. An extensive investigation is made between ductile iron, air quenched and oil quenched malleable irons based on the properties of more than 350 test bars produced under the same conditions. The results are compared with the existing international standards and discussed. Other properties like fatigue strength and response to surface treatments as induction hardening are also discussed. The costs of malleable iron are reviewed and compared with other ferro alloys. These recent developments in increasing the casting yield, the understanding of the strength, makes malleable iron competitive with ductile iron and cheaper than the first grade of ausferritic ductile iron, or steel qualities. It is possible to design lighter and save weight which is essential in the automotive industry. An example of “green cast” development for typical applications, used in automotive transmissions and engines are shown...|$|R
