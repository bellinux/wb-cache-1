5|$|Because Guianan {{cocks-of-the-rock}} form large leks, averaging 55 adult males, {{the males}} in these display leks were {{especially vulnerable to}} attacks and predation by large snakes and other natural predators. In manipulated groups of smaller size, around 6, predation was less likely to occur, giving rise to <b>an</b> <b>inverse</b> <b>relationship</b> between the number and frequency of attacks {{and the size of}} leks. Thus, with a smaller frequency of attacks on the smaller group, the Guianan cock-of-the-rock males was less likely to spook or disperse completely as compared to a large group where a false alarm could trigger a complete flush out 90% of the time. It was found that these birds have relatively ineffective methods of anti-predation and that only social anti-predation and the infrequency of encounters with predators were keeping these lekking males alive.|$|E
5|$|Criticisms of Keynes's ideas {{had begun}} to gain {{significant}} acceptance by the early 1970s, as they were then {{able to make a}} credible case that Keynesian models no longer reflected economic reality. Keynes himself included few formulas and no explicit mathematical models in his General Theory. For economists such as Hyman Minsky, Keynes's limited use of mathematics was partly the result of his scepticism about whether phenomena as inherently uncertain as economic activity could ever be adequately captured by mathematical models. Nevertheless, many models were developed by Keynesian economists, with a famous example being the Phillips curve which predicted <b>an</b> <b>inverse</b> <b>relationship</b> between unemployment and inflation. It implied that unemployment could be reduced by government stimulus with a calculable cost to inflation. In 1968 Milton Friedman published a paper arguing that the fixed relationship implied by the Philips curve did not exist.|$|E
5|$|Genetics {{may play}} a role in a person's {{disposition}} to SAH; risk is increased three- to fivefold in first-degree relatives of people having had a subarachnoid hemorrhage. However, lifestyle factors are more important in determining overall risk. These risk factors are smoking, hypertension (high blood pressure), and excessive alcohol consumption. Having smoked in the past confers a doubled risk of SAH compared to those who have never smoked. Some protection of uncertain significance is conferred by caucasian ethnicity, hormone replacement therapy, and diabetes mellitus. There is likely <b>an</b> <b>inverse</b> <b>relationship</b> between total serum cholesterol and the risk of non-traumatic SAH, though confirmation of this association is hindered by a lack of studies.

5|$|If {{there is}} a pass in the {{mountain}} range, winds will rush through the pass with considerable speed because of the Bernoulli principle that describes <b>an</b> <b>inverse</b> <b>relationship</b> between speed and pressure. The airflow can remain turbulent and erratic for some distance downwind into the flatter countryside. These conditions are dangerous to ascending and descending airplanes. Cool winds accelerating through mountain gaps have been given regional names. In Central America, examples include the Papagayo wind, the Panama wind, and the Tehuano wind. In Europe, similar winds are known as the Bora, Tramontane, and Mistral. When these winds blow over open waters, they increase mixing of the upper layers of the ocean that elevates cool, nutrient rich waters to the surface, which leads to increased marine life.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{westerly}} wind increases {{associated with}} the Madden–Julian oscillation lead to increased tropical cyclogenesis in all tropical cyclone basins. As the oscillation propagates from west to east, it leads to an eastward march in tropical cyclogenesis with time during that hemisphere's summer season. On average, twice per year twin tropical cyclones will form in the western Pacific Ocean, near the 5th parallel north and the 5th parallel south, along the same meridian, or line of longitude. There is <b>an</b> <b>inverse</b> <b>relationship</b> between tropical cyclone activity in the western Pacific basin and the north Atlantic basin, however. When one basin is active, the other is normally quiet, and vice versa. The main reason for {{this appears to be}} the phase of the Madden–Julian oscillation, or MJO, which is normally in opposite modes between the two basins at any given time.|$|E

Therefore the aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the relationship between physical activity in Leisure Time and Juvenile Delinquency in Detained Boys in Yazd city (Center of Iran). Materials and Methods In this descriptive correlation study, 254 boys in Yazd prison, were selected randomly according to the Morgan formula for determine the sample size. Demographic characteristics questionnaires, including Bahrami leisure time questionnaire and Bahrami delinquency rate questionnaire (2013) questionnaires were distributed among them. Finally to ensure the normal distribution of data the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was done and for data analysis Pearson correlation, simple linear regression, one sample t-test and ANOVA test were used.   Results A total of 254 boys, in Yazd prison, participated in this study. Our results demonstrated that there was <b>a</b> significant <b>inverse</b> <b>relationship</b> between training and exercise sessions and delinquency rate in imprisoned boys (P≤ 0. 05). Also there was <b>a</b> significant <b>inverse</b> <b>relationship</b> between delinquency rate and the amount of interest to physical activity in imprisoned boys (P≤ 0. 05). Between the satisfaction of spending leisure time with delinquency rate, there was <b>a</b> significant <b>inverse</b> <b>relationship</b> too (P≤ 0. 05).

Thus the ratio between the force increment produced by adding another motor unit and the force threshold at which that unit is recruited remains relatively constant.|$|E

40|$|Background: Previous {{epidemiologic}} {{studies have}} demonstrated <b>an</b> <b>inverse</b> association between childhood exposure to oral-fecal microbes, such as Helicobacter pylori, {{and the development of}} atopic conditions, such as asthma. Recent studies have also demonstrated immune modulating effects, specifically a decrease in the cytokine profile responsible for asthma, when mice were inoculated with H. pylori virulence factors. This systematic review looks at recent cross-sectional studies to determine if H. pylori colonization is associated with decreased asthma rates. Methods: The medical literature search utilized MEDLINE (through Ovid and PubMed), Web of Science, and Evidence Based Medicine Review and found five case-control observational studies that clearly defined asthma and H. pylori diagnosis. Studies were critically appraised and assessed with GRADE criteria. Results: Five retrospective case-control studies were used in this systematic review. The largest of these case-control studies (7663 participants) found <b>a</b> significant <b>inverse</b> <b>relationship</b> between CagA positive strains of H. pylori, a specific virulence factor, and the development of asthma before age 15 (OR= 0. 63 (0. 43 - 0. 93)). The study was repeated with 7412 participants the following year and found <b>a</b> strong <b>inverse</b> <b>relationship</b> between H. pylori and presence of asthma in children (OR= 0. 41 (0. 24 - 0. 69)) and onset of asthma before age 5 (OR= 0. 58 (0. 38 - 0. 88)). The smallest of these case-control studies (526 participants) found <b>a</b> significant <b>inverse</b> <b>relationship</b> between CagA positive strains of H. pylori and the development of asthma (OR=. 57 (CI 0. 36 - 0. 89)). The Israeli study (6959 children) found a 1. 8 % increased prevalence of asthma in children without H. pylori. The United Kingdom study (3244 participants) found <b>a</b> suggested <b>inverse</b> <b>relationship</b> between H. pylori and asthma (OR= 0. 78 (0. 59 - 1. 05)). Conclusion: The findings suggest that H. pylori and other oral-fecal microbe exposure at a young age may have an immune modulating effect which either delays and/or prevents the development of asthma. Future {{research is needed to determine}} whether H. pylori virulence factors may be utilized in medicine to prevent the development of asthma without causing pathology.
