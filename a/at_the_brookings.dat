50|$|Between 1931-1933 Abrams was a {{research}} fellow <b>at</b> <b>the</b> progressive <b>Brookings</b> Institution in Washington, DC. In 1933 he joined the research department of the London Press Exchange, one of Britain's leading advertising agencies.

His national newspaper readership surveys, which included over 20,000 participants between 1934-38, were landmarks in survey research and helped initiate the ABC1 system of social classification. Abrams's contacts with other social scientists working abroad during this period led to his work retrieving refugees from Nazi Europe (in 1939 helping Sigmund Freud make his final move to England).|$|R

50|$|This report {{contradicts the}} common idea that <b>the</b> <b>Brookings</b> Effect is a Chinook wind, as {{moisture}} {{does not appear}} {{to play a role in}} the moist adiabatic cooling of air on the windward side of a mountain range, followed by dry adiabatic warming on the lee side.

40|$|Excerpt] This book, {{by three}} nationally {{respected}} researchers in <b>the</b> <b>Brookings</b> Institution 2 ̆ 7 s Center on Economic Progress and Employment, addresses two {{problems facing the}} American economy: anemic productivity improvement and consequent slow economic growth, and growing income inequality. Contrary to their distinguished predecessor <b>at</b> <b>Brookings,</b> <b>the</b> late Arthur Okun, who maintained in a widely cited 1975 book that the twin goals of growth and more equal distribution of income conflict with each other (Arthur M. Okun, Equality and Efficiency: the Big Tradeoff [Washington, D. C. : Brookings Institution, 1975]), Baily, Burtless, and Litan argue—correctly, I believe—that growth and equality are compatible goals. 2 ̆ 2 Unless the nation finds better ways to ease the disruptions caused by economic change, 2 ̆ 2 they write, 2 ̆ 2 those most at risk from change will seek to block it. The policies that offer the best opportunity to improve the nation 2 ̆ 7 s long-term economic performance may never be adopted 2 ̆ 2 (p. 6). However, the right policy package, detailed {{in the rest of}} the book, could help the nation achieve both growth and equity objectives...|$|R
