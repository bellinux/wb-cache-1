In 1821 the population of Lurgan was 2,715, this increased to 4,677 by 1841. There were <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>reasons</b> for this large growth in population. Firstly the opportunities provided by the booming linen industry led many to abandon their meagre living in rural areas and migrate to Lurgan {{in the hope of}} gaining employment. Secondly the ever-expanding town gave tradesmen the opportunity to secure work in the construction of new buildings such as Brownlow House.|$|E

It {{is worth noting}} that, in addition to achieving a good rate-distortion performance, there are <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> other <b>reasons</b> <b>of</b> incorporating the ROI-based rate control mechanism with the proposed digital watermarking scheme. First, the ROI coding can benefit the effective and reliable watermark detection, which will be explained later. Second, one may question that vehicles appearing in the surveillance videos are of great importance; so the changes of pixel values from the watermark embedding may not be appropriate. By using the ROI-based rate control, {{we can make the}} quality of the [...] "watermarked vehicles" [...] even better than that in the compressed video without using ROI coding so that the concern of quality degradation in vehicles can be eased.|$|R

The diminishment of UNB as a nationally accredited university, the reduction in accessibility to receive degrees, and there are only <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> the <b>reasons</b> why the community was enraged by the recommendation with support slightly below 90% to keep UNBSJ as it was, and expand the university under its current structure.

25|$|IBL was a {{franchise}} league commercially managed by an Indian sports rights management company, Sporty Solutionz as commercial partners. With the brand value of US$1 million, Indian Badminton League was the richest badminton league in the world. Jwala {{was one of}} the six marquee players and team captains to be auctioned. The auction itself was not short of controversy. The base price of Jwala Gutta and Ashwini Ponnappa was halved from USD 50,000 to USD 25,000, without the players' notice and Women's Doubles event was replaced by a second Men's Singles. This left both Jwala and Ashwini hurt and angry. Jwala was bought for USD 31,000 and captained the Delhi franchise, but the team did not reach the semis and finished fifth. Gutta and Ponnappa after IBL confirmed on that they were set to reunite. Jwala went on to add that the two decided to come together because of <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>reasons.</b> The first was the Indian Badminton League's organisers knocking out the women's doubles category from the tournament, which in turn resulted in the base prices of Jwala and Ashwini.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{important}} evidence for dating 1 Henry VI is the Diary of Philip Henslowe, which records {{a performance of}} a play by Lord Strange's Men called Harey Vj (i.e. Henry VI) on 3 March 1592 at the Rose Theatre in Southwark. Henslowe refers to the play as [...] "ne" [...] (which most critics take to mean [...] "new", although {{it could be an}} abbreviation for the Newington Butts theatre, which Henslow may have owned) and mentions that it had fifteen performances and earned Â£3.16s.8d, meaning it was extremely successful. Harey Vj is usually accepted as being 1 Henry VI for <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>reasons.</b> Firstly, it is unlikely to have been either 2 Henry VI or 3 Henry VI, as they were published in 1594 and 1595, respectively, with the titles under which they would have originally been performed, so as to ensure higher sales. As neither of them appear under the title Harey Vj, the play seen by Henslowe is unlikely to be either of them. Additionally, as Gary Taylor points out, Henslowe tended to identify sequels, but not first parts, to which he referred by the general title. As such, [...] "Harey Vj could not be a Part Two or Part Three but could easily be a Part One." [...] The only other option is that Harey Vj is a now lost play.|$|E

The discussion {{presents the results of}} research about various kinds of Satanism which are representative of the diversities evident today.

Although it is certain that the majority of what is said and written about Satanism is a product of fantasy and prejudice, <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> good <b>reasons</b> are suggested for academic interest. This part of the discussion is based on observation of media representation. I have been a regular participant in the controversies as an academic interviewee almost every time Satanism appears newsworthy to various media. In short, Satanism is mostly a 'self religion' which enjoys presenting a sinister image to wider society. However, accusations about Satanism reveal contemporary social fears and obsessions and might contribute to debates about alterity, legitimation and other interesting issues. The occasional crime committed by alleged Satanists, and a recent trend linking Satanism with vampirism, raise important questions about rationality, fantasy and the effects of media hype...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAs {{proposed}} by Biber et al. (1999 : 966, 972), stance requires the communication of assessments and value judgments concerning the described situation by appeal to evidence (evidentiality), {{assessment of the}} degree of likelihood concerning the described situation (epistemic modality), and the arguments regarding the necessity or desirability of the situation obtaining (deontic modality). The present study investigates authorial stance in doctoral dissertations of native and non-native academic authors of English. It is designed to analyze evaluation adjectives in doctoral dissertations produced in the field of English Language Teaching, Applied Linguistics, English Language and Literature and Modern Languages between 2005 and 2012. Throughout the study, a total number of fifty-one evaluation adjectives were examined across three sets of corpora including dissertations written by native speaking academic authors of English (NAEs), Turkish-speaking academic authors of English (TAEs) and Spanish-speaking academic authors of English (SAEs). The items in question were identified through WS Tools (Scott, 2012) over three corpora, which were subsequently compared with regard to their frequency using a log likelihood test. Findings of the study have revealed that these adjectives were significantly underused by TAEs and SAEs against NAEs. The study offers <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> possible <b>reasons</b> for this particular consequence and a few instructional suggestions for academic writing in a second language...|$|R

40|$|This {{essay is}} based on a case study that {{discusses}} studentsâ attitudes and beliefs about parallel language i. e. studying in two languages instead of only one. The study has been carried through by performing interviews with five students on two occasions as well as one interview with one of the educators at the department of Business Administration. It was found that students are positive towards parallel language even though it requires more time for reading and risk of losing out on content. <b>A</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> the <b>reasons</b> that the students are positive about are that they expect (i) increased language proficiency and (ii) further work opportunities as a result of reading course literature in English. However, according to the educator there is little chance that reading course literature in English will affect employability. The departmentâs main goal is to find good textbooks. It was also revealed that even though students intend to read their textbooks they use different strategies and sometimes try to evade texts entirely. The participants were also asked to participate in a small vocabulary test with the aim of finding out if the students had acquired some of the vocabulary in their textbooks. The results showed that the students who used dictionaries extensively got the highest score, whereas those who believed that they already were proficient enough in English and did not need dictionaries that much showed very poor results...|$|R

From the research on micro- and small-scale entrepreneurs in Sukaregang Leather Craftsmen Centre in Garut, we know that: capital structure is not optimum yet, 1). Equity capital accumulation is very limited; 2). Proportion of a loan utilized for business operational, continuity and expansion is too little; and 3) There are potencies of ineffective loan utilizing. Researchers find some worrying facts: a). Both suppliers and customers are 2 Ì 7 still reluctant 2 Ì 7 to give capital aid; b). Koperasi, BPR, and public banks are known to be able to giant a loan for craftsmen, but high interest rate and other costs, required collateral are factors which inhibit them to get a credit; c). Due to some middle-scale entrepreneurs who do not pay their credit appropriately, these entrepreneurs in this center are "black listâ-ed by more than two banks in Garut, making even fewer chances for them (micro-small entrepreneurs) to get a loan in standard rate and free from demands for various credit requirements, especially collateral.
