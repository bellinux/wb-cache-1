Other associated problems include: issue of bias and deliberate manipulation, establishing a reliable chronological and dating framework, quantification and language shift. These notwithstanding, the usefulness of oral documentation in the contemporary study of African cultures cannot be glossed over. It helps Africans to tell their own story by themselves, it has been found useful in refuting some euro centric views about African history e 3 :nd culture.
