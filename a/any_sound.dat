5|$|In {{addition}} to the standard four difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard, and Expert) for each song and instrument, a new Beginner level has been added in World Tour. This difficulty is aimed for younger and unskilled players; notes are generally simple straight lines in time with bass drum beats, and allowing any or no fret button to be held while the note is strummed (for lead and bass guitar), any drum to be hit (for drums), or <b>any</b> <b>sound</b> to be made (for vocals).|$|E

50|$|Ironically, at present, Colanduno cannot {{tolerate}} <b>any</b> <b>sounds</b> {{or music}} above a low-level, {{and he also}} still experiences lingering effects to his vision and timing, and is still unable to drive as of 2014.|$|R
60|$|Flower {{thanked him}} effusively. He was {{listening}} intently for <b>any</b> <b>sounds</b> outside. If the Tippings {{and the man}} in the gig met, they would scour the country-side, and almost certainly pay the cottage a visit.|$|R
5|$|They {{also agreed}} to fixed limits on how many pop-ups they can {{generate}} on a computer (maximum of 5 per day, 1 per hour), the requirement to provide a mute button for <b>any</b> <b>sound</b> content in the pop-ups {{and be able to}} close the windows, and provide a hyperlink with toll-free number and email utility, to request stopping the pop-ups under certain conditions. The defendants also promised to clearly label any single-click download or install buttons, and not pre-select these as the default.|$|E
5|$|During the happenings of the episode, a man playing Santa at a Christmas-themed ranch {{is shown}} videotaping the {{children}} at his ranch. Billie later tells Mulder that she saw a vision of her daughter in her room and that she said the number 74. Mulder decides he cannot finish the case and wants {{to take time off}} because he's too close to make <b>any</b> <b>sound</b> judgment. On their way to the airport, Scully comes across the Santa park (situated off of California State Route 74) and decides to stop because of the reference to Santa Claus in the notes. Here they find the videotape setup and tapes dating {{all the way back to}} the '60s, including one of Amber Lynn LaPierre. The man who runs the park is promptly arrested, and Mulder finds graves of children all over his ranch.|$|E
5|$|For the {{flashback}} {{scene at}} the gas station, the crew rented out a 7-11 for a day. When Hurley drove in, the van was actually being pushed instead of driven to eliminate <b>any</b> <b>sound</b> from the vehicle. However, every time the van was pushed it would stall or the timing would be off. Once that problem had been solved, it started to rain, but eventually it stopped and the crew {{was able to get}} the shots before ending shooting at midnight. Hurley's dream scene was shot in the Hawaii Film Studio, where the hatch had been constructed. After each take of Hurley eating food in the hatch, the old food would be replaced with newer food. Garcia did not actually eat all the food though, he would sometimes just chew it and then spit it out into a garbage can. The chicken head that Bose had to wear was extremely heavy, causing actor Daniel Dae Kim to have to hold it up while Bose delivered his lines.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hist!" [...] {{said the}} wary woodsman, {{interrupting}} Heyward's exclamation of surprise; [...] "the varlets {{are about the}} place, and <b>any</b> <b>sounds</b> that are not natural to witchcraft would bring them back upon us in a body." ...|$|R
50|$|Drawing a {{contrast}} with composer John Cage, he continues:Cage {{made it his}} project to reveal that music could be <b>any</b> <b>sounds</b> in <b>any</b> order. This involves an equivalence—one thing is like another—that negates value judgment. So goes further: <b>any</b> <b>sounds</b> in <b>any</b> order, but instead of an equivalence between them, there is a radical disparity. Cage famously made an enemy of harmony, but in a sense, he used silence {{in all of his}} pieces after 4′33″ as a kind of harmony—the sounds of the environment always “fit” inside a Cage piece. In So, the silences are dissonant. There are layers of silence and they are in contrast if not outright contest.|$|R

5|$|The Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works has {{protected}} the copyrights on literary, scientific, and artistic works since 1886. Article 9 of the Convention states that: Authors of {{literary and artistic works}} protected by this Convention shall have the exclusive right of authorising {{the reproduction of}} these works, in any manner or form.... <b>Any</b> <b>sound</b> or visual recording shall be considered as a reproduction {{for the purposes of this}} Convention. This means a composer has performing rights and control over how derivative works should be used, and the rights are retained at least 50 years after death, or even longer. Even if a song is a traditional arrangement in the public domain, performing rights can still be violated. Where they exist, performers rights may have a shorter duration than full copyright; for example, the Rome Convention sets a minimum term of twenty years after the performance. This created a market for bootleg CDs in the late 1980s, containing 1960s recordings.|$|E

25|$|The typical {{method of}} {{muffling}} {{is to place}} the pads of the fingers against the head while holding onto the timpani stick with the thumb and index finger. Timpanists are required to develop techniques to stop all vibration without making <b>any</b> <b>sound</b> from the contact of their fingers.|$|E

50|$|In June 1997, Cathedral went live online. The first build of {{this system}} {{included}} streaming audio, streaming video, animation, images, and text. At the time, there were fewer than one million sites on the World Wide Web and fewer than 2% of those made <b>any</b> <b>sounds.</b>|$|R
50|$|MIDI files do {{not contain}} <b>any</b> <b>sounds,</b> only {{instructions}} to play them. To play such files, sample-based MIDI synthesizers use recordings of instruments and sounds stored in a file or ROM chip. SoundFont-compatible synthesizers allow users to use SoundFont banks with custom samples to play their music.|$|R
25|$|In Milan {{she first}} went to {{audition}} with the impresario Bartolomeo Merelli, but was so struck with fright {{that she could not}} produce <b>any</b> <b>sound</b> at all. After this she resolved to return to Bielefeld: but the (later famous) teacher Francesco Lamperti took the situation in hand, and under his guidance her voice and powers returned and flourished.|$|E
25|$|Exit {{takes place}} at the Petrovaradin Fortress, located on the right bank of the river Danube in Novi Sad. It is {{considered}} as {{one of the largest and}} most beautiful European medieval fortresses. The location also offers superb acoustics, allowing different events, and allows them to take place one next to another at the same time, without <b>any</b> <b>sound</b> interference.|$|E
25|$|Alomía Robles {{said in an}} {{interview}} in 1942 that his first exposure to music was when he was six years old and his mother took him to hear mass in Huánuco and he began to sing along with the chorus. Alomía Robles said that he had a good ear and could reproduce <b>any</b> <b>sound</b> that he heard and that he took special pleasure as a child in singing the indigenous songs of Peru.|$|E
60|$|For a moment, I stood rooted with apprehension; I {{dared not}} enter. A horrible dread {{deprived}} me of strength, until from within a piteous sobbing, more musical, more welcome than <b>any</b> <b>sounds</b> which I had ever before heard, {{told me that}} the child I sought was safe.|$|R
5000|$|A Crossbreed : An animal {{described}} by Kafka in [...] "Description of a Struggle" [...] that is half cat and half lamb. Its fur is woolly and soft, {{yet it has}} a cat's face and claws. It does not make <b>any</b> <b>sounds,</b> and refuses to chase after rats.|$|R
60|$|At the end {{of three}} or four minutes, spent in patient waiting without hearing <b>any</b> <b>sounds</b> of a response, the {{stranger}} advanced and repeated the call in a more decided manner. He then fancied he heard footsteps in the hall, and sundry movements of the door-knob, but nobody appeared.|$|R
25|$|To help redress these losses, {{a number}} of minor Crusading expeditions left Europe for the East. The {{abortive}} Crusade of Louis IX of France to Tunis in 1270 was one such attempt. The minor Ninth Crusade of Prince Edward (later King Edward I) of England in 1271–1272 was another. Neither of these expeditions was capable of giving <b>any</b> <b>sound</b> assistance to the beleaguered Latin states. The forces involved were too small, the duration {{of each of the}} Crusades too short, the interests of the participants too diverse to allow any solid accomplishment.|$|E
25|$|Genie {{spent almost}} all of her {{childhood}} locked alone in a bedroom with almost no environmental stimuli, where her father left her severely malnourished and almost always kept her either strapped to a child's toilet or bound inside a crib with {{her arms and legs}} completely immobilized. He refused to speak to or around her, beating her or forcing her brother to do so if she made <b>any</b> <b>sound</b> or showed any emotion, and to discourage her from making any outward expression he would bare his teeth and bark and growl at her like a dog. As a result, she learned not to vocalize or make noise and to remain as unexpressive as possible. On some occasions when she was hungry or seeking some kind of attention she made environmental noises, but otherwise maintained silence at all times.|$|E
25|$|In both {{town and}} country, {{means of access}} between the main house and the servant's wings were kept to a minimum, often the single door would be lined with green baize to deaden <b>any</b> <b>sound.</b> Long and {{complicated}} passages linking kitchens with dining rooms were devised; in some houses the tortuous route through corridors and staircases from kitchen to dining room could be an eighth of a mile – an absence of cooking smells taking priority over hot food. Even the doors linking to the connecting corridors would be covered by screens, sometimes disguised as bookcases with dummy books, or just simply covered in the same wallpaper as that with which the room was decorated, as the existence of servants {{was not to be}} acknowledged. Cleaning had to be performed {{in the early hours of}} the morning while the employers were asleep, and in the grander houses only male servants were allowed to be visible, and then only when required.|$|E
60|$|Pierre and Tiennot, the two sons, {{were sent}} out to fodder the cattle, and keep careful watch for <b>any</b> <b>sounds</b> of pursuers from the convent; and Blaise, in the plenitude of his respects and deference, would have {{followed}} them, but Eustacie desired him to remain to give her counsel.|$|R
50|$|The Haters first {{performances}} did {{not involve}} any deliberate use of sound. Even if there were <b>any</b> <b>sounds,</b> the audio was secondary. Haters performances {{at the time were}} simple actions. Events such as hitting video cassettes with a video camera, watching dust form on a floor, or counting garbage cans along a street.|$|R
50|$|The anteaters can {{communicate}} with each other by leaving scent marks with their anal scent glands. Although infants can be quite vocal, adults rarely make <b>any</b> <b>sounds.</b> If provoked, they can prop themselves up on their hind legs and tails using a tree or rock for support, and lash out with their claws.|$|R

500|$|The {{music of}} Atlas Sound {{utilizes}} computer-based MIDI instruments, created and recorded in musical software Ableton Live; the program allows Cox [...] "to turn pretty much <b>any</b> <b>sound</b> into a MIDI-controllable keyboard", according to him. Effects {{that were not}} already built into the program were seldom used. Brian Foote of the band Nudge assisted Cox {{in the production of}} Let the Blind Lead, by showing him the basics of the software, and aiding in the selection of equipment that would be used on the record. [...] Cox described the process of recording the album as being stream-of-consciousness: [...] "with Atlas Sound, the songs are being written as they're recorded." [...] In addition, all of the lyrics on the album were created as they were being recorded on the first take.|$|E
500|$|The musical {{opened for}} tryouts on October 27, 1958 at Boston's Shubert Theatre. [...] The {{audience}} gave it an enthusiastic response, causing Rodgers {{to leave his}} seat repeatedly and race {{to the back of}} the theatre, looking for someone to hug. [...] The Boston critics thought well of the work, stating that after the show was polished, it was likely to be a hit. [...] Shortly after the Boston opening, Fields suffered a heart attack, and, after his release from the hospital, he had to return to New York to recuperate. [...] Author C. Y. Lee, who had quietly watched the rehearsals, recalled that, at the Boston performances, Hammerstein would have a secretary mark on the script <b>any</b> <b>sound</b> of the chairs squeaking, as indicating that the audience was restless. [...] Hammerstein rewrote some of the book to expand the focus from Ta himself to the romantic relationships of the two couples.|$|E

"It is well," [...] he said, as {{they climbed}} out, [...] "that the knights promised to go one each way, {{to tell the}} watchers on the walls to take no heed of <b>any</b> <b>sounds</b> that they might hear of {{breaking}} ice, for that those leaving the town were doing so by their authority." ...|$|R
