Laurent Detoc, CEO of Ubisoft's North American operations, stated that this achievement [...] " [...] the Just Dance brand as a pop culture phenomenon."

6000|$|A few {{remarks on}} the value of loaded ships will throw {{additional}} light on this subject, and make more apparent the value of the Lifeboat Institution. Take, first, the case of a ship which was actually saved by a lifeboat. She was a large Spanish ship, which grounded on a bank off the south coast of Ireland. The captain and crew forsook her, and escaped to shore in their boats, but one man was inadvertently left on board. Soon after, the wind moderated and shifted, the ship slipped off the bank into deep water, and drifted to the northward. The crew of the Cahore lifeboat were on the look-out, observed the vessel passing, launched their boat, and after a long pull against wind and sea, boarded the vessel, and rescued the Spanish sailor. But they did more. Finding seven feet of water in the hold, they rigged the pumps, trimmed the sails, carried the ship into port, and handed her over to an agent for the owners. This vessel and cargo were valued at 20,000 pounds, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> are justified in saying that England, through the instrumentality of her Lifeboat Institution, presented that handsome sum to Spain upon that occasion! ...|$|E

If we had eyes to see it, a bit of stone from the city wall would certify us of the necessity that man must exist, as readily as the city. That identity makes us all one, and reduces to nothing great intervals on our customary scale. We talk of deviations from natural life, as if artificial life were not also natural. The smoothest curled courtier in the boudoirs of a palace has an animal nature, rude and aboriginal as a white bear, omnipotent to its own ends, and is directly related, there amid essences and billets-doux, to Himalaya mountain-chains[509] and the axis of the globe. If we consider how much we are nature's, we need not be superstitious about towns, as if that terrific or benefic force did not find us there also, and fashion cities. Nature, who made the mason, made the house. We may easily hear too much of rural influences. The cool, disengaged air of natural objects, makes them enviable to us, chafed and irritable creatures with red faces, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> shall be as grand as they, if we camp out and eat roots, but let us be men instead of wood-chucks, and the oak and the elm shall gladly serve us, though we sit in chairs of ivory on carpets of silk.|$|E
6000|$|It was on {{precisely}} such a specious {{basis of}} definite misinformation that General McClellan's next {{proposal for the}} campaign {{by way of the}} Peninsula rested,--precise facts before he sets out turning to something like precise no-facts when he gets there,--beautiful completeness of conception ending in hesitation, confusion, and failure. Before starting, [...] "the roads are passable at all seasons of the year, the country much more favorable for offensive operations than that in front of Washington, much more level, the woods less dense, the soil more sandy" [...] (p. 47). After arriving, we find [...] "the roads impassable," [...] "very dense and extensive forests, the clearings being small and few;" [...] and [...] "the comparative flatness of the country and the alertness of the enemy, everywhere in force, rendered thorough reconnoissances slow, dangerous, and difficult" [...] (p. 79). General McClellan's mental constitution would seem to be one of those, easily elated and easily depressed, that exaggerate distant advantages and dangers near at hand,--minds stronger in conception than perception, and accordingly, as such always are, wanting that faculty of swift decision which, catching inspiration from danger, makes opportunity success. Add to this a kind of adhesiveness (we can hardly call it obstinacy or pertinacity) of temper, which can make no allowance for change of circumstances, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> have a tolerably clear notion of the causes of General McClellan's disasters. He can compose a good campaign beforehand, but he cannot improvise one out of the events of the moment, as is the wont of great generals. Occasion seldom offers her forelock twice to the grasp of the same man, and yet General McClellan, by the admission of the Rebels themselves, had Richmond at his mercy more than once.|$|E

6000|$|This is the {{impression}} {{left on the}} mind of any observing student by too many of his fellows. They seem all frigid old men; and one pauses to think how such an unnatural state of matters is produced. We feel inclined to blame for it the unfortunate absence of University feeling which is so marked a characteristic of our Edinburgh students. Academical interests are so few and far between--students, as students, have so little in common, except a peevish rivalry--there is such an entire want of broad college sympathies and ordinary college friendships, that we fancy that no University in the kingdom is in so poor a plight. Our system is full of anomalies. A, who cut B whilst he was a shabby student, curries sedulously {{up to him and}} cudgels his memory for anecdotes about him when he becomes the great so-and-so. Let there be an end of this shy, proud reserve on the one hand, and this shuddering fine ladyism on the other; <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> shall find both ourselves and the College bettered. Let it be a sufficient reason for intercourse that two men sit together on the same benches. Let the great A be held excused for nodding to the shabby B in Princes Street, if he can say, [...] "That fellow is a student." [...] Once this could be brought about, we think you would find the whole heart of the University beat faster. We think you would find a fusion among the students, a growth of common feelings, an increasing sympathy between class and class, whose influence (in such a heterogeneous company as ours) might be of incalculable value in all branches of politics and social progress. It would do more than this. If we could find some method of making the University a real mother to her sons--something beyond a building of class-rooms, a Senatus and a lottery of somewhat shabby prizes--we should strike a death-blow at the constrained and unnatural attitude of our Society. At present we are not a united body, but a loose gathering of individuals, whose inherent attraction is allowed to condense them into little knots and coteries. Our last snowball riot read us a plain lesson on our condition. There was no party spirit--no unity of interests. A few, who were mischievously inclined, marched off to the College of Surgeons in a pretentious file; but even before they reached their destination the feeble inspiration had died out in many, and their numbers were sadly thinned. Some followed strange gods in the direction of Drummond Street, and others slunk back to meek good-boyism {{at the feet of the}} Professors. The same is visible in better things. As you send a man to an English University that he may have his prejudices rubbed off, you might send him to Edinburgh that he may have them ingrained--rendered indelible--fostered by sympathy into living principles of his spirit. And the reason of it is quite plain. From this absence of University feeling it comes that a man's friendships are always the direct and immediate results of these very prejudices. A common weakness is the best master of ceremonies in our quadrangle: a mutual vice is the readiest introduction. The studious associate with the studious alone--the dandies with the dandies. There is nothing to force them to rub shoulders with the others; and so they grow day by day more wedded to their own original opinions and affections. They see through the same spectacles continually. All broad sentiments, all real catholic humanity expires; and the mind gets gradually stiffened into one position--becomes so habituated to a contracted atmosphere, that it shudders and withers under the least draught of the free air that circulates in the general field of mankind.|$|E

[...] To do this, Hofsommer notes, Aydelott [...] "required that the Rio Grande pay special attention to the needs of customers, who had a choice not only among rail carriers, but, more importantly, also among the various modes of transportation." [...] Aydelott focused on keeping his sales forces constantly in touch with their shippers, and his operating department moving Rio Grande trains expeditiously. In these efforts he was very successful, Hofsommer noting [...] "The Rio Grande [...] [...] [...] gained a favorable reputation among shippers by following this path." [...] Aydelott himself became one of the railroad industry's [...] "most respected leaders." ...|$|E
40|$|Funded by Arts Council England, Disappearing Acts {{looks at}} the idea of {{illusion}} and its disintegration from a choreographic point of view, weaving together movements that <b>we</b> see <b>and</b> movements that <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> see. By using extreme low-light conditions we detach the viewer from everyday distractions of busy and information-rich environments; placing the viewer in a situation devoid of background context, presenting only moving body (or parts of the moving body) within a dislocated space. Through this dislocation we aim to reawaken the viewers' awareness of the moving body, by representing the familiar in a new way. Disappearing Acts operates on the threshold of the visible/invisible, what <b>we</b> see <b>and</b> what <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> see, what is inferred and what our perceptual system brings to the whole.  We are interested in the subtle readings of the body offered by the low-level lighting conditions to ascertain what is it in the movement that is actually being read. Text is similarly used to dislocate the audience, to distract and provoke, working both with and against the choreographic language and lighting states. It brings forth evocative images, stories and wry (at times dark) humour emerging from and giving voice to our experiences of darkness, night-time and politically 'dark times'...|$|R
