5|$|A phase-to-amplitude {{converter}} (PAC), {{which uses}} the phase accumulator output word (phase word) usually as an index into a waveform look-up table (LUT) to provide <b>a</b> <b>corresponding</b> amplitude sample. Sometimes interpolation is {{used with the}} look-up table to provide better accuracy and reduce phase error noise. Other methods of converting phase to amplitude, including mathematical algorithms such as power series can be used, particularly in a software NCO.|$|E
5|$|A toxin-antitoxin {{system is}} a set of two or more closely linked genes that {{together}} encode both a protein 'poison' and <b>a</b> <b>corresponding</b> 'antidote'. When these systems are contained on plasmids– transferable genetic elements– they ensure that only the daughter cells that inherit the plasmid survive after cell division. If the plasmid is absent in a daughter cell, the unstable antitoxin is degraded and the stable toxic protein kills the new cell; this is known as 'post-segregational killing' (PSK). Toxin-antitoxin systems are widely distributed in prokaryotes, and organisms often have them in multiple copies.|$|E
5|$|After Calabi–Yau {{manifolds}} {{had entered}} physics {{as a way}} to compactify extra dimensions, many physicists began studying these manifolds. In the late 1980s, Lance Dixon, Wolfgang Lerche, Cumrun Vafa, and Nick Warner noticed that given such a compactification of string theory, {{it is not possible to}} reconstruct uniquely <b>a</b> <b>corresponding</b> Calabi–Yau manifold. Instead, two different versions of string theory called type IIA string theory and type IIB can be compactified on completely different Calabi–Yau manifolds giving rise to the same physics. In this situation, the manifolds are called mirror manifolds, and the relationship between the two physical theories is called mirror symmetry.|$|E

One member was elected i 1980, and three in 1983; Arvid Fossum, Odd Harsheim and Birger Ruud. Three honorary members were proclaimed after 1960: Erik Plahte in 1969, Herman Smith-Johanssen in 1975 and Jakob Vaage in 1983.|$|E
5|$|Another case of synesthesia is {{swimming}}-style synesthesia {{in which}} each swimming style {{is associated with a}} vivid experience of a color. These synesthetes do not need to perform the actual movements of <b>a</b> <b>corresponding</b> swimming style.

5|$|Apple {{offers several}} iPad accessories, {{most of which}} are {{adapters}} for the proprietary 30-pin dock connector, the iPad's only port besides the headphone jack. A dock holds the iPad upright at an angle, and has a dock connector and audio line-out port. Each generation of iPad requires <b>a</b> <b>corresponding</b> dock. A dock that included a physical keyboard was only supported for the original iPad, but all generations are compatible with Bluetooth keyboards that also work with Macs and PCs. The iPad can be charged with a 10 W standalone power adapter, which is also compatible with iPods and iPhones.|$|E

5|$|Ductility is an {{important}} factor in ensuring the integrity of structures by enabling them to sustain local stress concentrations without fracture.
