The requirement for such a real risk, [...] "while very wide, is not illusory".

The power to punish for contempt of court is vested in the judiciary by virtue of section 7(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act. While contempt of court is a criminal offence, <b>applications</b> <b>for</b> <b>committal</b> are made under Order 52 of the Rules of Court, which is a civil procedure.|$|R
40|$|In 2011 {{there were}} {{increases}} in rape cases, and theft/fraud/robbery cases and decreases in murder cases, drugs cases and road traffic {{cases in the}} criminal courts. In the civil courts, there were increases across all jurisdictions in applications relating to the recovery of debt though there were decreases in <b>applications</b> <b>for</b> possession in the High Court and <b>applications</b> <b>for</b> <b>committal</b> <b>for</b> non payment of debt, in the District Court. In the family courts there was little change in the numbers applying for judicial separation and divorce - with wives applying {{for the majority of}} both. There was a significant reduction in drink driving and other driving offences at District Court level. Judicial and administrative responses to the resources issue •	In the Supreme Court a number of list management initiatives were introduced to address the delay in the hearing of cases and the delivery of judgments. These included the categorisation of appeals where common issues of law arose and the sitting of the Court in two divisions. •	The President of the High Court scheduled additional sittings of the High Court, with the voluntary assistance of High Court Judges, during September 2011. This resulted in the disposal of over 300 additional common law matters. That and the allocation of an extra judge from the following month on helped reduce the waiting time for motions for judgment from 20 weeks to nine weeks. •	The High Court also assumed the hearing of Notices of Motion seeking an order for discovery, previously dealt with by the Master of the High Court. This measure reduced the waiting time in the Master’s Court from 26 weeks to eight weeks. •	The President of the Circuit Court assigned extra judges to deal with criminal cases in 13 provincial venues - thus reducing waiting times in those areas, and bringing justice in a timely manner. •	The President of the District Court scheduled additional sittings in Dublin in August and September to further reduce waiting times. She also facilitated the extension of the catchment area of the Drug Treatment Court - allowing for more people to avail of its resources to restore them as citizens and to restore them to he community. •	Additional adjudicative functions were transferred by Statute to county registrars during the year, which also saw the appointment of five county registrars as vice chairs of the Employment Appeals Tribunal. •	Twenty court venues were amalgamated in 2011 freeing up judicial and staff time to hear extra cases, allocate specific family law and children’s hearings, and reduce waiting times. Drug Treatment Court (page 20) The catchment area for the Drug Treatment Court (DTC) was extended during the year to include participants from additional areas of Dublin. There were four graduations from the third and final (gold) phase of the DTC programme with others completing the first (bronze) and second (silver) phases.

Notwithstanding that an applicant’s financial resources exceed the statutory limit, the Director of Legal Aid may grant legal aid to the applicant if the Director is satisfied that it is desirable in the interests of justice to do so. However, in appeal cases, the Director of Legal Aid must be satisfied that there are meritorious grounds for appeal with a reasonable prospect of success. Notwithstanding the refusal of a legal aid application by the Director of Legal Aid, a judge may himself grant aid if the applicant has satisfied the means test. Applicants in cases involving a charge of murder, treason or piracy with violence may apply to a judge for granting of legal aid, and exemption from the means test and from payment of contribution.|$|R

The Bargaining System was the most extensive and demanding of the postal courses linked with the Project, so the survey was also intended to indicate which students tended to complete the course and in what contexts of trade union activity they operated. Drop-outs The aim of the drop-outs survey was to provide profile information on those who dropped out, why they began a course, how they adapted to study, how useful they found it in their trade union activities, and why they decided not to continue.
