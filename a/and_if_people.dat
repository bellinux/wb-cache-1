Later – in front of some senior players – he told Azhar Mahmood that he will be the next Pakistan captain. Together they would plan the future strategy. But till now this never came to pass.|$|E

25|$|Self-verification strivings {{may have}} {{undesirable}} consequences {{for people with}} negative self-views (depressed people and those who suffer from low self-esteem). For example, self-verification strivings may cause people with negative self-views to gravitate toward partners who mistreat them, undermine their feelings of self-worth, or even abuse them. <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>people</b> with negative self-views seek therapy, returning home to a self-verifying partner may undo the progress that was made there. Finally, in the workplace, the feelings of worthlessness that plague people with low self-esteem may foster feelings of ambivalence about receiving fair treatment, feelings that may undercut their propensity to insist that they get what they deserve from their employers (see: workplace bullying).|$|E
500|$|Bradford Wright {{described}} Watchmen as [...] "Moore's obituary for {{the concept}} of heroes in general and superheroes in particular." [...] Putting the story in a contemporary sociological context, Wright wrote that the characters of Watchmen were Moore's [...] "admonition to those who trusted in 'heroes' and leaders to guard the world's fate". He added that to place faith in such icons was to give up personal responsibility to [...] "the Reagans, Thatchers, and other 'Watchmen' of the world who supposed to 'rescue' us and perhaps lay waste to the planet in the process". Moore specifically stated in 1986 that he was writing Watchmen to be [...] "not anti-Americanism, [...] anti-Reaganism", specifically believing that [...] "at the moment a certain part of Reagan's America isn't scared. They think they're invulnerable." [...] Before the series premiered, Gibbons stated: [...] "There's no overt political message at all. It's a fantasy extrapolation of what might happen <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>people</b> can see things in it that apply to the real America, then they're reading it into the comic [...]" [...] While Moore {{wanted to write about}} [...] "power politics" [...] and the [...] "worrying" [...] times he lived in, he stated the reason that the story was set in an alternate reality was because he was worried that readers would [...] "switch off" [...] if he attacked a leader they admired. Moore stated in 1986 that he [...] "was consciously trying to do something that would make people feel uneasy." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{asked what}} advice {{he would give}} to his character, Barber said [...] "Unfortunately, I don't think he would listen {{to me in the}} first place, but if he could give me the time of day, I would say lighten up on the control because you’re never going to have it." [...] Speaking to Channel 5, Barber {{revealed}} Rhys would not do a lot to redeem himself in the new year, but viewers would get learn more about his back story, which could explain his dark side. During a 2012 interview with Kilkelly, Barber said his character is good at getting what he wants, saying [...] "I {{think at the end of}} the day, he just wants to win and he has this ability to justify why he does things, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>people</b> are hurt in the process, it's their fault. His vision is the one that is most important." [...] Barber said that deep down, Rhys is sensitive and he means well. When asked about the reaction Rhys has received from viewers, Barber believed they liked the character as he is unpredictable and manipulative. He added that the viewers are interested in seeing what Rhys does next. When asked how he felt about playing a bad boy by DNA's Matthew Myers, Barber revealed that he loved it, saying [...] "It's always exciting getting the scripts because I never know which way they are going to turn or who I'm going to be turning on!" [...] The actor quipped that he is always wondering which character he is going to manipulate or [...] "screw over" [...] next and added [...] "But at the core of things Rhys has a heart of gold." ...|$|E

2500|$|Another {{criticism}} often {{leveled against}} the Western Rite {{is based on}} the fact that the majority of the members of Western Rite parishes are converts to Orthodoxy. The argument states that Christians want to be Orthodox but [...] "not too Orthodox" [...] so they keep their familiar rites under a new bishop. The unstated assumption behind this argument, however, is similar to the argument against all non-Byzantine liturgical traditions: that the Orthodox Church includes only the Byzantine Rite <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>people</b> want to be truly Orthodox they must also be Byzantine.|$|E
2500|$|Arius asked Rabbi Jose {{what the}} {{difference}} is between [...] "wise" [...] and [...] "discerning" [...] in [...] Rabbi Jose answered that a wise person is like a rich money-changer.

A discerning person is like a poor money-changer. When people bring coins to evaluate, the poor money-changer evaluates them, but if people do not bring coins to evaluate, the poor money-changer sits and daydreams.|$|E

2500|$|... {{many of the}} {{suggestions}} in Nudge seem like good ideas, and even, as with “Save More Tomorrow,” practical ones. The whole project, though, as Thaler and Sunstein acknowledge, raises some pretty awkward questions. If the “nudgee” can’t be depended on to recognize his own best interests, why stop at a nudge? Why not offer a “push,” or perhaps even a “shove”? <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>people</b> can’t be trusted {{to make the right}} choices for themselves how can they possibly be trusted to make the right decisions for the rest of us? ...|$|E
2500|$|On March 27, 2007, Malakar sang No Doubt's [...] "Bathwater" [...] {{wearing a}} fauxhawk made from {{multiple}} ponytails. The style {{was called the}} [...] "ponyhawk" [...] by host Ryan Seacrest. While singing, Malakar hesitated {{with some of the}} words to the song. Simon Cowell remarked, [...] "Sanjaya, I don't think it matters anymore what we say ... I think you are in your own universe <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>people</b> like you, good luck."

2500|$|Retribution – Criminals {{ought to}} Be Punished in some way. This {{is the most}} widely seen goal. Criminals have taken {{improper}} advantage, or inflicted unfair detriment, upon others and consequently, the criminal law will put criminals at some unpleasant disadvantage to [...] "balance the scales." [...] People submit to the law to receive the right not to be murdered <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>people</b> contravene these laws, they surrender the rights granted {{to them by the}} law. Thus, one who murders may be executed himself. A related theory includes the idea of [...] "righting the balance." ...|$|E
5000|$|Shwe Mann {{has argued}} that {{democracy}} must be seen “as a vehicle for progress.” In an interview, he stated that “the biggest challenge is changing the old mind-set <b>and</b> attitude. <b>If</b> <b>people</b> {{do not understand the}} essence of democracy, there will be more disadvantages than advantages.” ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{rationale}} for the abolition is summarized by former Wall Street Journal reporter Mei Fong: [...] "The reason China is doing this right now is because they have too many men, too many old people, and too few young people. [...] They have this huge crushing demographic crisis {{as a result of}} the one-child policy. <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>people</b> don’t start having more children, they’re going to have a vastly diminished workforce to support a huge aging population." [...] China's ratio is about five working adults to one retiree; the huge retiree community must be supported, and that will dampen future growth, according to Fong.|$|E
2500|$|The total {{percentage}} of Mexico's population who is indigenous varies considerably depending {{of the criteria}} used by the government on its censuses: it is 5.4% if the hability to speak an indigenous language is used as the criteria to define a person as indigenous, if racial self-identification is used it's 14.9% <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>people</b> who considers themselves part indigenous are also included it amounts to 21.5%. Nonetheless all the censuses conclude {{that the majority of}} Mexico's indigenous population is concentrated in the southern and south-eastern Mexican states, primarily in rural areas. Some indigenous communities have a degree of autonomy under the legislation of [...] "usos y costumbres", which allows them to regulate some internal issues under customary law. According to the National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples, the states with the greatest proportion of indigenous residents are: Yucatán at 59%, Quintana Roo 39% and Campeche 27%, chiefly Maya; Oaxaca with 48% of the population, the most numerous groups being the Mixtec and Zapotec peoples; Chiapas at 28%, the majority being Tzeltal and Tzotzil Maya; Hidalgo 24%, the majority being Otomi; Puebla 19%, and Guerrero 17%, mostly Nahua peoples and the states of San Luis Potosí and Veracruz both home to a population that is 15% indigenous, mostly from the Totonac, Nahua and Teenek (Huastec) groups. The absolute numbers of the indigenous population growing, but at a slower rate {{than the rest of the}} population so that the {{percentage of}} indigenous peoples in regards to total population is nonetheless falling. [...] All of the indices of social development for the indigenous population are considerably lower than the national average. In all states indigenous people have higher infant mortality, in some states almost double of the non-indigenous populations. Literacy rates are also much lower, with 27% of indigenous children between 6 and 14 being illiterate compared to a national average of 12%. The indigenous population participate in the workforce longer than the national average, starting earlier and continuing longer. However, 55% of the indigenous population receive less than a minimum salary, compared to 20% for the national average. Many practice subsistence agriculture and receive no salaries. Indigenous people also have less access to health care and a lower quality of housing.|$|E
