5|$|Davies' {{next project}} was The Grand, a period soap drama {{set in a}} Manchester hotel during the interwar period. It was {{designed}} to be a valuable show in a ratings war with the BBC and was scheduled at 9pm on <b>a</b> <b>Friday</b> night. After the original writer abandoned the series, Granada approached him to write the entire show. His scripts for the first series reflect the pessimism of the period; each episode added its own emotional trauma on the staff, including a soldier's execution for desertion, a destitute maid who threatens to illegally abort her unborn child to survive, and a multi-episode storyline centred on the chambermaid, Monica Jones (Jane Danson), who kills her rapist in self-defence, is arrested, and eventually hanged for murder. The show was renewed for a second series despite the first's dark tone.|$|E

At Moe's on <b>a</b> <b>Friday</b> night, a drunk Homer is forced to walk home, but takes a wrong path and {{ends up in the}} woods. In a clearing, he sees a glowing, thin-boned alien. Homer panics and runs home screaming. The rest of the family do not believe Homer's story and his attempts to report the alien sighting to police are dismissed. Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully of the FBI hear of the sighting and go to investigate. After receiving no results from their psychological tests of him, Homer fails to provide any proof that he actually saw an alien. Homer is ridiculed by most of the neighborhood; even Marge refuses to believe in his claims, but Bart admits he believes Homer. The next Friday night, the pair camp out in the forest. The alien arrives and promises peace, but Homer scares it away when he accidentally steps on their camp fire and screams in pain. Fortunately, Bart captures the entire incident on tape.|$|E

5|$|The {{start of}} Johnson's career at League One side Bradford City {{was marred by}} an ankle {{ligament}} injury in a pre-season friendly at Boston United which was expected {{to keep him out}} of the first month of the season. He recovered to make his debut in City's 2006–07 season's opening game at Nottingham Forest as a late substitute. Two weeks later he scored his first Bradford goals by netting twice against his former club Crewe in a 3–0 Bradford victory. Johnson struggled for goals at City, and had only scored another two {{by the time he was}} ruled out for a month after going off at half-time against Chesterfield on 16 December 2006 with a shin injury. He returned to the City team after a six-game absence for <b>a</b> <b>Friday</b> night game with Tranmere Rovers, which ended 1–1. He had a goal disallowed against Yeovil Town a week later for offside. Following a poor run of form, City manager Colin Todd was sacked, with his replacement David Wetherall converting Johnson from a striker to a midfielder after an injury to Marc Bridge-Wilkinson. However, City were relegated after a defeat to Chesterfield with Johnson finishing the season with just four goals.|$|E
5|$|Allison was {{replaced}} as manager by Terry Venables, {{who had been}} his assistant the previous season, and he guided Palace to promotion at the first attempt. The Palace youngsters also won the FA Youth Cup with a side including Kenny Sansom, Vince Hilaire and Billy Gilbert. The following season, 1977–78 saw the youth team became {{the first team to}} win the FA Youth Cup in successive seasons since Chelsea in 1960 and 1961. These talented young players had become regulars in the team by the 1978–79 season which saw Palace vying not only for promotion but also the Second Division Championship. The final game of the season was <b>a</b> <b>Friday</b> night match at home to Burnley. In front of the club's record home crowd of 51,801, there was all to play for: a Palace win, and the club would be champions; a draw, and Palace would be promoted, but hand the championship to fierce rivals Brighton; a loss and Palace would stay down, with Sunderland clinching the final promotion place. At half-time the deadlock had not been broken despite Palace's dominance, but a second-half cross from Vince Hilaire allowed Ian Walsh to head the opener, before a great run by David Swindlehurst was completed by a finish from outside the penalty area to give the Eagles a 2–0 win. Palace were crowned champions, and had reached the top flight again.|$|E
