25|$|Moby Dick—Rehearsed: a {{film version}} of Welles's 1955 London meta-play, {{starring}} Gordon Jackson, Christopher Lee, Patrick McGoohan, and with Welles as Ahab. Using bare, minimalist sets, Welles alternated between a cast of nineteenth-century actors rehearsing a production of Moby Dick, with scenes from Moby Dick itself. Kenneth Williams, a cast member who was apprehensive <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> project, recorded in his autobiography that Welles's dim, atmospheric stage lighting made some of the footage so dark as to be unwatchable. The entire play was filmed, but is now presumed lost. This was made during one weekend at the Hackney Empire theatre.|$|E
25|$|Unable {{to find an}} {{impartial}} jury in Letcher County, the trial was moved to Harlan County, where it was held in March 1968. The prosecution was led by Commonwealth's Attorney Daniel Boone Smith, who recalled that even in Harlan County it was assumed he would not push too hard for Ison's conviction, since many locals approached him to express sympathy for Ison. Boone said his task was to convince the jurors that O'Connor and his crew were respectable {{people who had been}} commissioned by the United States Government to make a film <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> United States, and that the Kentucky shots would only be briefly featured.|$|E
25|$|Critics of New Urbanism {{have argued}} that its {{environmental}} aspect is too focused on transport and excessive individual mobility. The real problem with the unsustainable nature of modern cities {{is not just about}} cars and too much driving - it is <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> urban metabolism of the city (of which auto-mobility is {{less than half of the}} overall ecological footprint and accounts for about half of the GHG emissions/carbon footprint). They have also argued that land-use planning can do little to achieve sustainability without regulating the design and associated technology of the actual development within a zoned area. Distances and density are relatively unimportant; it is the total metabolism of the development that determines the environmental impact. Also, the emphasis needs to shift from sustainability to resilience, and the spatial scope from the city to the whole urban region A further criticism is that the New Urbanist project of compacting urban form is a difficult and slow process. In the new global situation, with the horizontal, low-density growth irreversibly dominant, and climate change already happening, it would be wiser to focus efforts on the resilience of whole city-regions, retrofitting the existing sprawl for sustainability and self-sufficiency, and investing heavily in 'green infrastructure'.|$|E

At the same time, analyses of sea currents, salinity and temperature provided data confirming the Geodetic Survey's findings, by then known in Washington, that the Kuro Siwo had no effect north of the Bering Strait.

500|$|The {{prosecution}} {{case was}} presented {{over the course}} of 56 days, involving hundreds of documents and 112 witnesses (many of them Holocaust survivors). Hausner's intention was to not only demonstrate Eichmann's guilt but to present material <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> Holocaust, thus producing a comprehensive record. Hausner's opening address began, [...] "It is not an individual that is in the dock at this historic trial and not the Nazi regime alone, but anti-Semitism throughout history." [...] Defence attorney Servatius repeatedly tried to curb the presentation of material not directly related to Eichmann, and was mostly successful. In addition to wartime documents, material presented as evidence included tapes and transcripts from Eichmann's interrogation and Sassen's interviews in Argentina. In the case of the Sassen interviews, only Eichmann's hand-written notes were admitted into evidence.|$|E

500|$|The {{remaining}} {{tracks on}} the record discuss her relationship between herself and Sednaoui. The first track on the album to introduce their relationship is [...] "Cowboy Style", a country number that was influenced by Celtic and tribal percussion. It details about Minogue meeting Sednaoui for the first time, and achieves a metaphorical experimentalism throughout its lyrical delivery. However, the theme of frustration was lingered into the album's seventh track, the techno-induced [...] "Drunk", which has Minogue feeling unsatisfied with the relationship, despite [...] "having so much feeling for [...] ". [...] "Limbo", a hybrid between rock, techno and drum and bass beats, was written in Spain, where Minogue discusses her inability to leave a certain country to meet someone, due to bureaucracy laws. Outside of Sednaoui, Minogue mentions her meeting an ex-boyfriend on [...] "Through the Years", feeling insecure and doubtful <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> situation; the composition was compared to Bjork's single [...] "Venus as a Boy" [...] by Cinquemani and R.

500|$|To {{create the}} look of Frozen, Giaimo began {{pre-production}} research by reading extensively <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> region of Scandinavia and visiting the Danish-themed city of Solvang near Los Angeles, but eventually zeroed in on Norway in particular because [...] "80 percent" [...] of the visuals that appealed to him were from Norway. Disney eventually sponsored three research field trips. Animators and special effects specialists were dispatched to Jackson Hole, Wyoming, to experience walking, running, and falling in deep snow {{in a variety of}} types of attire, including long skirts (which both female and male personnel tried on); while lighting and arts teams visited an Ice Hotel in Quebec City, Quebec to study how light reflects and refracts on snow and ice. Finally, Giaimo and several artists traveled to Norway to draw inspiration from its mountains, fjords, architecture, and culture. [...] "We had a very short time schedule for this film, so our main focus was really to get the story right but we knew that John Lasseter is keen on truth in the material and creating a believable world, and again that doesn't mean it's a realistic world– but a believable one. It was important to see the scope and scale of Norway, and important for our animators to know what it's like," [...] Del Vecho said. [...] "There is a real feeling of Lawrence of Arabia scope and scale to this," [...] he finished.|$|E
500|$|After the wedding, Cane {{recalled}} {{a phone call}} he had with his [...] "Uncle Langley" [...] regarding their con with Jill and Katherine. Afterward, Langley was revealed to be the long deceased Phillip Chancellor III in June 2009; Cane was in fact not Jill's son but someone hired by Phillip. Lily and Cane separated upon this revelation, but soon reunited upon her diagnosis with ovarian cancer. Her uterus was taken out during surgery, but the doctors were able to harvest two of her eggs; they decided {{to start a family}} with Mackenzie Browning (Clementine Ford) acting as their surrogate mother. Browning became pregnant with twins. Afterward, an immigration officer arrested Cane and planned to deport him, as he was not truly Phillip. Since he was present for the birth of his children, Charlie and Mattie in June 2010 and helped Lily overcome cancer he was not deported. Cane was then blackmailed by the crime family he turned to in Australia, and embezzled money from Tucker McCall's (Stephen Nichols) company with the help of Sofia Dupre (Julia Pace Mitchell). Cane's biological father, Colin Atkinson (Tristan Rogers), then came to Genoa City in December 2010 to help Blake Joseph blackmail Cane. Colin then became engaged to Jill much to Cane's dismay. Cane then tried to stop their wedding but was shot in the chest by Blake on the church steps; he died afterward, leaving Lily devastated. Lily then began believing she was receiving afterlife messages from Cane and sought professional help. After seeing Cane several times, Lily realized he wasn't a figment of her imagination; it was then revealed in May 2011 that the man shot at the church wasn't Cane, but his identical twin brother, Caleb, who was scheming with Colin to kidnap Charlie and Mattie. However, Cane continued to act as Caleb to stop the plot with Colin and later his mother, Genevieve (Genie Francis). When Lily found out <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> conspiracy, she refused to forgive Cane and divorced him. After Colin tried to kidnap her children, Lily began to forgive Cane and let him protect her. When Cane threatened to return to Australia, Lily let him back into her life. Later, they reunited when she realized the cause of all the secrets: to take down Colin. Cane proposed to her again and they married in Provence, France in February 2012. Genevieve stays in town, and Cane constantly rejects her for everything she has done. Cane and Lily then go to work at Jabot Cosmetics, where Cane is interim CEO. Tyler Michaelson (Redaric Williams) becomes smitten with Lily and the two develop an attraction, making Cane jealous. Lily and Tyler share a kiss, but she turns him down and returns to Cane.|$|E

2500|$|Fimbriae (sometimes called [...] "attachment pili") are protein tubes {{that extend}} {{out from the}} outer {{membrane}} in {{many members of the}} Proteobacteria. They are generally short in length and present in high numbers <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> bacterial cell surface. Fimbriae usually function to facilitate the attachment of a bacterium to a surface (e.g. to form a biofilm) or to other cells (e.g. animal cells during pathogenesis). A few organisms (e.g. Myxococcus) use fimbriae for motility to facilitate the assembly of multicellular structures such as fruiting bodies. Pili are similar in structure to fimbriae but are much longer and present on the bacterial cell in low numbers. Pili are involved in the process of bacterial conjugation where they are called conjugation pili or [...] "sex pili". Type IV pili (non-sex pili) also aid bacteria in gripping surfaces.Pili are absent in gram-positive bacteria and present in gram-negative bacteria.|$|E
2500|$|The {{visit to}} Earth {{begins with a}} deeply pessimistic {{appraisal}} of humanity.

After climbing the highest mountain he had ever seen, the prince hoped to see the whole of Earth, thus finding the people; however, he saw only the enormous, desolate landscape. When the prince called out, his echo answered him, which he interpreted as the mocking voices of others.|$|E
2500|$|Over {{the course}} of his career, Chamberlain became more pessimistic in his conclusions, believing that notions about union-management {{collaboration}} would have scant impact on the corporation's ability to react to external events. [...] He also grew dissatisfied with the development of economic analysis, believing it too formal and beholden to quantitative methods and lacking a value-based look at how corporate management behaved. [...] Indeed, Chamberlain became skeptical about his discipline as a whole. [...] In the context of a 1980 New York Times piece about the hazards of poorly conducted social science research, he was quoted as saying, [...] "We know very little about what we profess to know.

[...] He came to have philosophical doubts <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> study of economics, believing that purposeful action, unforeseen trends, and random occurrences combine to give economic theories that are based upon the observation of what has taken place in the past little predictive ability or policy-making usefulness in terms of what will take place in the future.|$|E
