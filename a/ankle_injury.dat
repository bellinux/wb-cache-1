40|$|Does wearing {{external}} ankle supports prevent ankle sprains in athletes? Evidence-Based Answer: External ankle bracing and taping {{reduce the}} incidence of recurrent <b>ankle</b> <b>injuries</b> (SOR: A, meta-analysis).

40|$|Objective: To {{ascertain}} the epidemiology of <b>ankle</b> <b>injuries</b> in elite youth football. Design: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected injury data from English Football Association (FA) academies. Setting: Forty-one FA football academies, between 1998 and 2006. Participants: For the complete seasons studied, {{a total of}} 14 776 players was registered from U 9 to the U 16 age category, a mean of 2463 players per year. All <b>ankle</b> <b>injuries</b> of sufficient severity to miss 48 h or more of training were studied, 2563 injuries in total. Main Outcome Measure: The incidence and burden of <b>ankle</b> <b>injuries</b> in this population and factors associate...|$|R

5|$|Following the {{resignation}} of Strachan {{at the end of}} the 2008–09 season, Brown's former Hibs boss Tony Mowbray became Celtic manager. Brown underwent surgery during pre-season in an attempt to rectify his ankle problem, but this didn't work, and he played matches despite not being fully fit. Celtic had a fairly good start to their league campaign, going into the first Old Firm match four points ahead of Rangers, but they lost 2–1. Celtic beat Dynamo Moscow in Champions League qualifying, but then lost the play-off to Arsenal, which meant that they dropped into the Europa League group stage. The 1–0 home defeat by Hamburg on 22 October 2009 was Brown's last action of the year, as Celtic initially chose to rest him in another effort to heal the <b>ankle</b> <b>injury.</b> This proved unsuccessful, and he underwent a second operation in Rotterdam to try and clear up his <b>ankle</b> <b>injury.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to investigate the relationship between <b>ankle</b> <b>injuries</b> and future knee injuries. The subjects used for the study were all Division I athletes at Valparaiso University. The question to be answered was: Are <b>ankle</b> <b>injuries</b> precursors to knee injuries? Data was collected through a survey which was distributed to all athletic teams. The survey required information about previous <b>ankle</b> and knee <b>injuries</b> of each athlete. All surveys {{are in the process of}} coding and analysis. Descriptive statistics, correlation, and linear regression for inferential data will be used for analysis. No conclusion has yet been made about the relationship between <b>ankle</b> <b>injuries</b> and future knee injuries as data is under review...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the relationship between exposure time and ankle sprains in soccer. Forty-one teams (639 players) from four male senior soccer divisions {{at different levels of}} skill (divisions I-VI) were followed prospectively for 1 year. The exposure to soccer and the number of injuries per player were higher in higher divisions, but the injury incidence, percentage of <b>ankle</b> <b>injuries</b> and inci-dence of <b>ankle</b> <b>injuries</b> were the same at different levels of skill. Of all injuries 17 to 20 % were ankle sprains and the incidence varied between 1. 7 to 2. 0 <b>ankle</b> <b>injuries</b> per 1000 hours of exposure. Since players with previous ankle problems run an increased risk of reinjury we suggest that these players receive preventive advice...|$|R

5|$|Hokies {{tailback}} Darren Evans {{ran for a}} school-record of 253yards, and exceeded 100rushing {{yards in}} a game {{for the first time}} in his career. The Hokie defense shut down the Terrapins running game and held them to 12yards on 18carries. Maryland also proved unable or unwilling to blitz against Sean Glennon, the Tech quarterback hobbled by an <b>ankle</b> <b>injury.</b> Glennon threw for 127yards and a touchdown.|$|E
5|$|Ludvig Borga was {{scheduled}} to continue his feud with Tatanka in a match at Royal Rumble 1994. Borga sustained a legitimate <b>ankle</b> <b>injury,</b> however, and never returned to the WWF.

40|$|In the {{diagnosis}} of <b>ankle</b> <b>injuries</b> routine radiography is often productive. An international survey of {{the average number of}} radiographs made of injured ankles suggested that two projections are adequate to detect fractures. This was confirmed in a prospective study of 242 patients coming to a hospital emergency department with recent <b>ankle</b> <b>injuries.</b> All the fractures could be identified on an anteroposterior or a lateral projection, although some were more obvious on an oblique view. As well, all the fractures were associated with malleolar soft-tissue swelling. Thus, radiography for acute <b>ankle</b> <b>injuries</b> could safely be restricted to patients with soft-tissue swelling, and fractures could be diagnosed using only two routine projections, though for management purposes additional projections might be needed. With a policy of limiting the use of radiography substantial cost reductions are possible...|$|R
5|$|As a British {{passport}} holder born outside the United Kingdom, FIFA regulations {{at the time}} allowed him to select which of the Home Nations {{he would like to}} represent, which led to interest from the non-English Home Nations. In September 1999, he rejected a call-up from Northern Ireland in favour of joining up with Wales, managed by former Manchester United teammate Mark Hughes and coach Eric Harrison. However, he picked up an <b>ankle</b> <b>injury</b> in the lead-up to the game and missed out on the match-day squad.|$|E
5|$|Borga {{suffered}} a legit <b>ankle</b> <b>injury,</b> however, {{and was replaced}} by Bam Bam Bigelow. Although the substitution took place shortly before the event, Bigelow and Tatanka also had a heated rivalry. In 1993, Bigelow had cut Tatanka's dyed red hair as an insult to his Lumbee heritage. The two faced each other as part of a six-man match at SummerSlam 1993, but the feud continued even after Tatanka's team emerged victorious.|$|E
5|$|His {{appearance}} in the final was remarkable {{for the fact that}} he was the top scorer of the day with five points, despite having suffered an <b>ankle</b> <b>injury</b> in the previous match, and was not expected (or advised) to play.

40|$|The {{role of a}} {{supportive}} wrap {{for the prevention of}} <b>ankle</b> <b>injuries</b> is still a matter of debate.

We report here trials which attempt to place on a sound basis the use of {{a supportive}} wrap for prevention and early mobilization for treatment of <b>ankle</b> <b>injuries...</b>|$|R
5|$|In a December 26 practice, Virginia Tech linebacker Myron Newsome {{suffered}} an <b>ankle</b> <b>injury</b> {{that threatened to}} force him to sit out the Orange Bowl.

Two other Virginia Tech defenders were injured during practice prior to the game. Cornell Brown suffered a minor leg injury, while defensive end John Engelberger broke his nose.|$|E
5|$|Liukin's <b>ankle</b> <b>injury</b> {{required}} surgery, and {{the recovery}} period kept {{her out of}} both national and international competition {{for much of the}} year. In July 2007, although she was still recovering from her injury, she returned to competition {{as a member of the}} American team for the Pan Am Games in Rio de Janeiro. She competed only on bars and beam, contributing to the team's gold-medal finish and winning individual silver medals in the uneven bars and balance beam finals.|$|E
5|$|Manchester United winger Jesper Blomqvist {{was ruled}} {{out with an}} <b>ankle</b> <b>injury,</b> but Roy Keane was fit enough to start his first {{competitive}} match since damaging his ligaments eleven months previously. Defender Jaap Stam, who signed for United in May 1998, made his competitive debut for the club, partnering centre-back Ronny Johnsen. For Arsenal, new signing Nelson Vivas began the match on the substitutes' bench, in spite of being expected to make his full debut, while Dennis Bergkamp started alongside Nicolas Anelka up front.|$|E
