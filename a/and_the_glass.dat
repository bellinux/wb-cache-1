He steals Bernard's cup and, with a lighter borrowed from Beach, proceeds to burn away the wine to reveal a mysterious liquid at the bottom. However, the flight attendant, Leigh Harrison (Brooke Adams), is alerted to Monk's use of a lighter on board, and confiscates both the lighter <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>glass,</b> dumping the liquid down the sink.|$|E
5|$|Between 5–28 June 1926, {{the station}} was closed to allow the Southern Railway to carry out various works, {{including}} the rebuilding of the platforms, relaying of the tracks and installation of {{a new system of}} electrical signalling – the four-aspect colour light scheme. The station was also renovated <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> roof cleaned. The number of platforms was reduced from nine to eight, with five set aside for the new electric trains. The signal box spanning the width of the railway bridge was removed. In July 1939, Cannon Street was closed for a week following a fire in Borough Market which prevented any trains accessing it.|$|E
5|$|The ancient Egyptians could {{fabricate}} a {{wide variety}} of objects from glass with great skill, {{but it is not clear}} whether they developed the process independently. It is also unclear whether they made their own raw glass or merely imported pre-made ingots, which they melted and finished. However, they did have technical expertise in making objects, as well as adding trace elements to control the color of the finished glass. A range of colors could be produced, including yellow, red, green, blue, purple, and white, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> could be made either transparent or opaque.|$|E

5|$|The primary {{literary}} {{influence on}} film noir was the hardboiled school of American detective and crime fiction, led {{in its early}} years by such writers as Dashiell Hammett (whose first novel, Red Harvest, was published in 1929) and James M. Cain (whose The Postman Always Rings Twice appeared five years later), and popularized in pulp magazines such as Black Mask. The classic film noirs The Maltese Falcon (1941) <b>and</b> <b>The</b> <b>Glass</b> Key (1942) were based on novels by Hammett; Cain's novels provided the basis for Double Indemnity (1944), Mildred Pierce (1945), The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946), and Slightly Scarlet (1956; adapted from Love's Lovely Counterfeit). A decade before the classic era, a story by Hammett was the source for the gangster melodrama City Streets (1931), directed by Rouben Mamoulian and photographed by Lee Garmes, who worked regularly with Sternberg. Wedding a style and story both with many noir characteristics, released the month before Lang's M, City Streets has a claim to being the first major film noir.|$|E

25|$|Miller's Crossing, {{released}} in 1990, starred Albert Finney, Gabriel Byrne, and John Turturro. The film is about feuding gangsters in the Prohibition era, inspired by Dashiell Hammett's novels Red Harvest (1920) <b>and</b> <b>The</b> <b>Glass</b> Key (serialized in 1930).|$|E

25|$|The colour {{of white}} wine is {{as varied as the}} types of wines. The term most {{commonly}} cited is yellow.

25|$|The bonding {{between the}} glass or {{ceramics}} <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> solder {{can be either}} covalent, or, more often, van der Waals. The seal can be leak-tight; glass soldering is frequently used in vacuum technology. Glass solders can be also used as sealants; a vitreous enamel coating on iron lowered its permeability to hydrogen 10 times. Glass solders are frequently used for glass-to-metal seals and glass-ceramic-to-metal seals.|$|E

25|$|That morning {{observers}} on the 16th {{floor of}} the M Bank Building in Buffalo watched as a gray wall covered the city; it appeared white as it came closer.

25|$|As {{observed}} by Lord Rayleigh, {{a thin film}} (such as tarnish) {{on the surface of}} glass can reduce the reflectivity. This effect can be explained by envisioning a thin layer of material with refractive index n1 between the air (index n0) <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> (index nS). The light ray now reflects twice: once from the surface between air and the thin layer, and once from the layer-to-glass interface.|$|E
25|$|The station {{concourse}} {{was again}} altered in 1983-4, {{with the total}} cost of refurbishment estimated at £7.4 million.
