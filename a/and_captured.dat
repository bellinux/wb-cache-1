40|$|This paper aims at {{examining}} how firms create <b>and</b> <b>capture</b> value with {{open source software}} (OSS). OSS {{is seen as an}} excellent exemplar of both peer production and open innovation. Nevertheless, the use of OSS as a form of open innovation is such a recent phenomenon that many unanswered questions still persist. The very concept of OSS represents phenomena that require firms to rethink their strategy as the shift in focus from ownership to one of openness requires a reconsideration of the processes that generate value creation <b>and</b> <b>capture.</b> In responding to this research gap, this paper begins a theory building process for examining OSS value creation <b>and</b> <b>capture.</b> In particular, various theoretical frameworks employed for value creation <b>and</b> <b>capture</b> are explored. The findings of this analysis reveal the importance of a value network for value creation <b>and</b> <b>capture</b> with OSS <b>and</b> the paper concludes by using theoretical propositions to illustrate relationships...|$|R
40|$|An {{application}} of the new optimization algorithm called Static/Dynamic Control (SDC) to design low-thrust escape <b>and</b> <b>capture</b> trajectories is pre-sented. SDC is a general optimization method that is distinct from both parameter optimization and the calculus of variations. Trajectories are in-tegrated with a multi-body force model and feature ~ ~~~ ~ solar electric propulsion with a speEifiCimpdG that {{is a function of}} the engine throttle. Test prob-lems include interplanetary scale trajectories that capture or escape at the Earth <b>and</b> Mars. Optimizing <b>capture</b> <b>and</b> escape trajectories with a multi-body force model results in a significant improvement in the mass delivered compared to existing two-body formulations. A variety of optimal escape <b>and</b> <b>capture</b> trajectories types are identified and classified. Three-body (e. g. Sun and Earth gravitating) optimal escape <b>and</b> <b>capture</b> is compared to four-body (e. g. Sun, Earth, and Moon gravitating) optimal escape <b>and</b> <b>capture.</b> SDC is robust for this appiication and does not require a good initial guess. 1...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{the effect of}} gantry {{orientation}} on the photoneutron <b>and</b> <b>capture</b> gamma dose calculations for maze entrance door was evaluated. A typical radiation therapy room made of ordinary concrete was simulated using MCNPX Monte Carlo code. Gantry rotation was simulated at eight different angles around the isocenter. Both neutron <b>and</b> <b>capture</b> gamma dose vary considerably with gantry angle. The ratios of the maximum to the minimum values for neutron <b>and</b> <b>capture</b> gamma dose equivalents were 1. 9 and 1. 4, respectively. On the other hand, comparison of the Monte Carlo calculated mean value over all orientations with Monte Carlo calculated neutron and gamma dose showed that the Wu-McGinley method differed by 5 % and 2 %, respectively. However, for more conservative shielding calculations, factors of 1. 6 and 1. 3 should {{be applied to the}} calculated neutron <b>and</b> <b>capture</b> gamma doses at downward irradiation. Finally, it can be concluded that the gantry angle influences neutron <b>and</b> <b>capture</b> gamma dose at the maze entrance door and it should be taken into account in shielding considerations...|$|R
