40|$|If we <b>assume</b> (<b>a)</b> <b>the</b> {{desirability}} of {{and the demand}} for a global free-access legal information system (LIS); (b) the {{desirability of}} a non-government and non-profit provider; and (c) the severe financial constraints imposed on the development of such a system by the free-access requirement, this dissertation asks (i) is such a goal technically achievable and sustainable, to a satisfactory standard and within a realistic time-frame; (ii) if there are no insurmountable obstacles, which model(s) of technical development are most appropriate; and (iii) what are the principal technical impediments remaining? The aim of this dissertation is to investigate and identify the technical and practical problems likely to be encountered in developing a global web-based free-access LIS for research, and to identify solutions to those problems sufficient to make the task achievable and sustainable within a free-access model. This dissertation does not focus on the political and economic issues, assuming as givens both the desire for cooperation and minimal sustainable funding despite severe funding constraints. The approach adopted is to examine each of the key stages in developing such an LIS in light of the imposed constraints. These include data collection, processing and markup, web publication, searching, interface and language issues. While grounded in technical literature, this dissertation is informed by professional experience and the practical lessons learnt in developing and maintaining the World Legal Information Institute (WorldLII) and other multi-country legal information institutes (LIIs). It is also informed by the experiences of other free-access LIIs and other providers from around the world. A broad approach is needed so that the technical challenges in developing such an LIS as a whole can be considered, while focusing on the key problems and their solutions. The result obtained from this examination and the principal conclusion of the dissertation is that such a system is achievable and sustainable within the necessary financial constraints, and that the model of technical development most likely to be successful is a decentralised multi-layer network of national or multi-country LIIs of reasonable technical consistency (the 'hybrid distributed' model). Some unresolved issues are identified but found not to be intractable. No such attempt to develop a global solution has previously been attempted, nor such a solution previously advanced...|$|E
