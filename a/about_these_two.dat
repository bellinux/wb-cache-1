25|$|In The Murder of Lee Oswald and The Warren Commission Torsten Billman incisively commented {{events in}} the wake of the {{assassination}} of president John F. Kennedy. The Murder of Lee Oswald uncovers, in the condensed black satire, complex links people only could sense but, then, couldn't put into words. Two pictures – made when it happened – who went against the grain of mainstream media and which today has a prophetic force. Bertrand Russell wrote appreciatively to Torsten Billman <b>about</b> <b>these</b> <b>two</b> grisaille woodcuts.|$|E
25|$|Some feminists, such as Carole Pateman, {{believe that}} {{exploitation}} is in both prostitution and sex trafficking. They believe {{that even if}} the women agreed to be a sex worker in a foreign country that the worker was still trafficked because of the preceding conditions that lead her to believe that sex work was the only viable work option. Other feminists such as Kamala Kempadoo, on the other hand, believe that prostitution is a form of labor just like any other migrant labor; however, due to the criminalization of prostitution, prostitutes are then subject to coercion and exploitation and subsequent trafficking. In the USA, each year 80,000 women are arrested for prostitution. Current debates about modifications to Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 policy are based <b>about</b> <b>these</b> <b>two</b> arguments. In providing aid for victims of sex trafficking the government must take a stand on whether or not they believe the sex industry and sex trafficking are inherently linked. These people involved in prostitution have an 80% higher chance of sexually transmitted infections and many never can afford to seek treatment. This results in serious infections, lifelong diseases, and sometimes even death.|$|E

500|$|Hotel Chevalier {{was one of}} the year's most {{discussed}} short films, {{and attracted}} considerable praise from film critics, who compared it favorably to The Darjeeling Limited. Gary Susman of Entertainment Weekly described it as [...] "an exquisite short story where we learn not much but exactly enough <b>about</b> <b>these</b> <b>two</b> characters", adding that [...] "Chevalier sees Anderson working in his customary jewel-box/dollhouse mode, but the form and length really suit each other here." [...] Armond White of New York Press judged the short [...] "moving and genuinely contemporary", citing its [...] "lost-girl poignancy". The film drew some attention for co-star Natalie Portman's extended nude scene, and for her character's bruised body. Portman expressed disappointment at this undue focus, saying [...] "t really depressed me that half of every review … was about the nudity". The episode made the actress reconsider the wisdom of this aspect of her performance, and she subsequently swore off nude appearances in film.|$|E
500|$|A {{pneumatic}} value {{failure in}} the preceding race, the United States Grand Prix, had forced Häkkinen to retire from the Grand Prix. With two races of the season remaining and an eight-point deficit after losing {{the lead in the}} Drivers' Championship, Häkkinen remained confident about his title chances: [...] "I know that what happened to me in the last Grand Prix, when I had to retire, can happen to anyone, It could happen to Michael. So I am very optimistic. I have come here prepared and thinking <b>about</b> <b>these</b> <b>two</b> races together. Not one, two." [...] Michael Schumacher emphasised the pressure of leading the championship going into Japan: [...] "It hasn't been a relaxing time at all and I still haven't completely got over the jetlag from the States. But I'm prepared to sacrifice this and a lot more to bring the title back to Maranello. And {{the same can be said}} of the entire team." [...] Ferrari team principal Jean Todt and former World Champion Jody Scheckter called for Barrichello and Coulthard to race fairly as both drivers were ordered by their teams to assist their teammates in the Championship battle.|$|E

[...] Josiah Hughes of Exclaim! magazine commented that [...] "if the over-the-top aggression of [...] "H•A•M" [...] had you worried {{that this would be}} a Waka Flocka ripoff, fear not, as [...] "Otis" [...] makes the most of its Otis Redding sample with some soulful feel-good boom-bap." [...] Sam Gould The Independent remarked [...] "having seen oddball rap collective Odd Future become the talking point of the blogosphere, Eminem and old partner-in-crime Royce da 5'9" [...] start work on their own bruising , and hazy vibe rappers Wiz Khalifa and Curren$y take steps in the same direction, Jay and Ye have recognised the throne is far from unchallenged, and have come together in the most remarkable dual alliance since André 3000 and Big Boi became Outkast." [...] The New York Observer writer Foster Kamer mused, [...] "remember early Kanye? These guys finally do. 'Otis' is the perfect anti-single for this album, because it's a reminder that what we always loved <b>about</b> <b>these</b> <b>two</b> collaborating is still very much there. Not only do they not need hooks, neither of them need to remind us that they don't. There was that first line of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, 'I fantasized 'bout this back in Chicago,' and then, the relief after it, where you didn't have to worry about the rest of that album", and Billboard claimed [...] "Otis gets better with each play".|$|E

2500|$|The {{first known}} voyage to Punt {{occurred}} in the 25th century BC under the reign of Pharaoh Sahure. The most famous expedition to Punt, however, comes {{during the reign of}} Queen Hatshepsut probably around 1495 BC, as the expedition was recorded in detailed reliefs on the temple of Deir el-Bahri at Thebes. The inscriptions depict a trading group bringing back myrrh trees, sacks of myrrh, elephant tusks, incense, gold, various fragmented wood, and exotic animals. Detailed information <b>about</b> <b>these</b> <b>two</b> nations is sparse, and there are many theories concerning their locations and the ethnic relationship of their peoples. The Egyptians sometimes called the Land of Punt, [...] "God's-Land", due to the [...] "large quantities of gold, ivory, and myrrh that could be easily obtained".|$|E
