40|$|This thesis investigates two {{slender body}} problems, namely the static and dynamic {{analysis}} of submarine pipeline spans and the dynamic analysis of marine risers. In view of structural and environmental similarities, {{these problems are}} closely related and where possible common analysis procedures have been developed. For the problem of pipe spanning, {{attention is focused on}} the possibility of vortex induced vibration and the associated question of span assessment. This situation arises when following the discovery of a span, an assess- ment is required to determine if any remedial repair work required. To assist in this assessment, and also to provide a more fundamental understanding of span behaviour, number of mathematical models are developed. First linear beam-column theory is used to determine the span natural frequencies and buckling load for a single span supported continuously on either side by an elastic foundation. The effects of internal/external pressures and product temperature are included and the results presented terms of two independent nondimensional parameters. Next the effects of pipe/soil friction and change in geometry are considered utilising a nonlinear Finite Element model. Theories are developed for a nonlinear pipe element with axial/bending coupling and a nonlinear nonconservative pipe/soil friction element. The effects of initial seabed geometry and finite amplitude vibration are included and it shown that span frequencies are sensitive to both end friction constraints and seabed geometry.. For marine riser dynamics, an attempt is made to synthesise the best parts from the many and varied analysis methods developed to date, into a simple but flexible design-orientated program. The riser is represented using a Finite Element model similar to that employed for the pipeline spans, and a reduced set of equations obtained using a component mode synthesis method. Several riser/ <b>articulated</b> <b>column</b> designs are considered and the results found to agree with published data...|$|E

For relatively deep wells and harsh environments, the ship is moored at an <b>Articulated</b> Loading <b>Column</b> with a single point mooring system. Nevertheless, for assuring a better positioning and/or uninterrupted loading operations, tankers with additional dynamic positioning capability are employed. In this paper a hybrid control strategy for the ship dynamic positioning is proposed. The control aim is to reduce the plant capital and running costs, trying to pursue a tradeoff between the maximization of a safety index and the minimization of the control effort. For limiting the power peaks and the total energy spent during each loading operation, it is also planned to utilize the main propulsion system to counteract too severe weather conditions. Starting from almost realistic data for the tanker, the mooring, the flexible <b>articulated</b> loading <b>column</b> and the thrusters, and from a statistical characterization of the disturbances and the uncertain dynamics, some simulation results are produced to prove the energy efficiency and show the good performance of the designed controller...|$|R

50|$|On September 10, 1804 {{four members}} of the Lewis and Clark {{expedition}} recorded in their journals a fossil discovery {{along the banks of the}} Missouri River in what is now Gregory County of south-central South Dakota. The find was a 45-foot long <b>articulated</b> vertebral <b>column</b> with some ribs and teeth associated that was located at the top of a high ridge. The men interpreted the remains as originating from a giant fish, but today scientists think the specimen was probably a mosasaur, or maybe a plesiosaur. The expedition sent back some of the fossils, but these were later lost. Later, in 1847, Dr. Hiram A. Prout published a description of a fragmentary titanothere jaw discovered in the White River Badlands in the American Journal of Science. Not long afterward, Joseph Leidy described the Oligocene camel Poebrotherium, which was discovered in the same general region as Prout's titanothere jaw. The government responded to these discoveries by dispatching an expedition into the area. In 1850 the Smithsonian sent its own collectors into the area. The Tertiary deposits of the White River Badlands was active for decades and still ongoing in 1920 when the South Dakota School of Mines published its Bulletin No. 13. This publication summarized the results of all the paleontological fieldwork done in the White River Badlands. In 1877, the United States Geological Survey published a report on the ancient plants and invertebrates of South Dakota.|$|R

40|$|The {{flexibility}} and posture {{of the neck}} in sauropod dinosaurs has long been contentious. Improved constraints on sauropod neck function will have major implications for what we know of their foraging strategies, ecology and overall biology. Several hypotheses have been proposed, based primarily on osteological data, suggesting different degrees of neck flexibility. This study attempts to assess the effects of reconstructed soft tissues on sauropod neck flexibility through systematic removal of muscle groups and measures of flexibility of the neck in a living analogue, the ostrich (Struthio camelus). The possible effect of cartilage on flexibility is also examined, as this was previously overlooked in osteological estimates of sauropod neck function. These comparisons show that soft tissues {{are likely to have}} limited the flexibility of the neck beyond the limits suggested by osteology alone. In addition, the inferred presence of cartilage, and varying the inter-vertebral spacing within the synovial capsule, also affect neck flexibility. One hypothesis proposed that flexibility is constrained by requiring a minimum overlap between successive zygapophyses equivalent to 50 % of zygapophyseal articular surface length (ONP 50). This assumption is tested by comparing the maximum flexibility of the <b>articulated</b> cervical <b>column</b> in ONP 50 and the flexibility of the complete neck with all tissues intact. It is found that this model does not adequately convey the pattern of flexibility in the ostrich neck, suggesting that the ONP 50 model may not be useful in determining neck function if considered in isolation from myological and other soft tissue data...|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} had a central plan {{approached by a}} four-sided portico and surrounded by two connected structures. Access to the portico was through a colonnade which in turn gave access to three portals leading to {{the main body of}} the building.

Towers rose at the four corners of the square building. The whole was topped by a dome of which we know little, this having been lost. The interior was lit by large windows, and probably decorated with marble in the lower parts and with mosaics in the vaults and arches. Of the two side buildings, the smaller was in the east, opposite the entrance: a chapel in the shape of a Greek cross, later on octagonal, dedicated to St Hippolytus. The larger building was to the south, having the function of the imperial mausoleum: tradition attributing its foundation to Galla Placidia, which is why the sacellum took on the name of the chapel of the Queen.|$|R
40|$|With the {{exception}} of the Triassic material of Monte San Giorgio, which is quite abundant and well-preserved, the Italian fossil record about ichthyosaurs {{for the remainder of the}} Mesozoic is very poor, and usually consists of few disarticulated elements. Lower Cretaceous remains have been described from the Northern Apennines, south of Modena and Bologna; another rostrum belonging to Platypterygius sp. has been recently reported from the Lessini Mts., near Verona; and a few vertebrae are reported from the Triassic of Sicily. In the summer of 1976, an ichthyosaur specimen was discovered in the locality of Camponocecchio, near Genga (Ancona, Marche, Italy) in an Upper Jurassic outcrop of the Marche Apennines. The specimen consists of a reasonably complete skeleton crushed on a slab, with a disarticulated skull, partially <b>articulated</b> vertebral <b>column</b> (from the atlas-axis to the tail bend, with few missing vertebrae), part of the pectoral girdles and some elements of the forelimbs. During the Late Jurassic, the Umbria-Marche area was occupied by a pelagic domain consisting of numerous structural highs and lows, as a result of the fragmentation and drowning of the pre-rifting Early Jurassic carbonate platform. The Genga ichthyosaur comes from the Calcari ad aptici e Saccocoma Formation (sensu Galluzzo & Santantonio, 2002), and thanks to the combination of the occurrence/lack of some micro- and macrofossils with biostratigraphic meaning, it has been possible to date the ichthyosaur-bearing level to the late Kimmeridgian – earliest Tithonian. The history of the Genga ichthyosaur has always been problematic, mainly because of the lack of attention that the authorities turn to paleontological findings: it took more than 20 years before the specimen could find a proper location, where it was finally prepared and where it is still exposed, in the Abbey of San Vittore di Genga. Since its discovery, few studies have focused on the Genga ichthyosaur (e. g. Fastelli & Nicosia, 1980; De Marinis & Nicosia, 2000), but never addressing its taxonomy and paleogeographical importance. This is the first time that this Mesozoic marine reptile is described and compared with other Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous ichthyosaurs by including it in the most recent phylogenetic analysis of ophthalmosaurids...|$|R
40|$|An {{excellently}} preserved partial {{skeleton of}} a rhomaleosaurid plesiosaurian (NLMH 106. 058) from the Sinemurian (Lower Jurassic) of Lyme Regis, England, is described. The material consists of a complete cranium, mandible, and <b>articulated</b> cervical vertebral <b>column,</b> and it is noteworthy because large-headed rhomaleosaurids are rare from this stratigraphic horizon and it is taxonomically distinct. The material is referred to a new taxon, Thaumatodracon wiedenrothi gen. nov. et sp. nov, diagnosed by the two autapomorphies: 1. a pronounced transverse trough on the posterior margin of the dorsal ramus of the squamosal; 2. possibly paired anteriorly tapering triangular basioccipital processes. It also possesses a unique combination of other characters including a 'short' premaxillary rostrum (length and width subequal), five premaxillary alveoli, premaxilla-maxilla sutures parallel anterior to the external nares, frontals contact on the midline, prefrontal-frontal suture convex and gently curved medially, mandibular symphyseal region spatulate and 'short' (length and width subequal), prominent dorsally concave medial flange anteromedial to the articular glenoid, robust rod-like axis neural spine with a circular transverse cross section, and cervical neural spines with a mediolaterally expanded apex. The taxon shares some of these characters with earlier Hettangian rhomaleosaurids (e. g. Atychodracon, Eurycleidus), and other characters with later Toarcian rhomaleosaurids (e. g. Rhomaleosaurus sensu stricto and Meyerasaurus). Inclusion of Thaumatodracon as an additional operational taxonomic unit in several existing cladistic analyses demonstrated that it occupies a relatively derived position within Rhomaleosauridae. A morphometric multivariate analysis of Lower Jurassic rhomaleosaurids shows that Thaumatodracon is also proportionally intermediate between known rhomaleosaurid taxa. Thaumatodracon is therefore a stratigraphically and anatomically intermediate taxon that fills a gap in {{our knowledge of the}} evolution of this macro-predatory plesiosaurian clade...|$|R

At {{the back of this}} terrace, are large sculpted river gods {{flanking}} a fountain. Directly above and supplying the water for the fountain is the catena d'acqua or chain of water, a water feature (gioco d'acqua) that can be seen in other 16th-century gardens (such as the Villa Farnese and Villa d'Este); this rill of small basins allows the water to ripple down to arrive at the fountain between the sculpted crayfish claws, a reference to Cardinal Gambero's heraldic device. In the meantime, stairs flanking the catena d'acqua lead up to the next terrace. On the next upper terrace are yet further fountains and grottos and two small casini called the Houses of the Muses, the sides of which frame the large Fountain of the Deluge that terminates the main axis of the garden. A roughened texture has been given to the sides of these small buildings to harmonise with the natural rough rock of the Fountain, and water conduits set in their eaves (and operated by a remote switch) project jets of water to complete a visual ensemble known as the 'theatre of the waters'.

40|$|An ophthalmosaurid {{ichthyosaur}} {{was discovered}} in Upper Jurassic deposits of the Umbria-Marche sedimentary succession near Genga (Ancona, Marche, Italy). While other Mesozoic marine reptiles have been found at different stratigraphic intervals in Italy, this specimen represents the first ichthyosaur ever recorded from the Upper Jurassic of the Apennines. It consists of an almost complete skeleton preserved on a slab, with an <b>articulated</b> vertebral <b>column,</b> and disarticulated skull and pectoral girdle. This paper describes the stratigraphy of the ichthyosaur-bearing deposits. The Umbria-Marche sedimentary succession is characterized by Meso-Cenozoic pelagites and hemipelagites overlying Lower Jurassic shallow-water carbonates (Calcare Massiccio Fm.). The rifting stage, which affected the Western Tethys in the Early Jurassic, produced a complex submarine architecture, resulting in a mosaic of variable facies and thickness differences in the syn- and post-rift succession. Extension linked with opening of the Liguria - Piedmont Ocean dismembered and drowned a huge carbonate platform (Calcare Massiccio paleoplatform), and converted it into a system with small horsts-and-grabens/semigrabens, where pelagic deposits capped the shallow-water carbonates. The original Early Jurassic paleobathymetric differences were levelled by Early Cretaceous times. The basin-fill deposits onlapped the (mostly pre-rift) Calcare Massiccio facies, exposed at the footwall of Jurassic faults {{in the form of}} paleoescarpments, and buried the structural highs while their margins were largely inactive. The area in which the ichthyosaur was found was characterized by numerous structural highs (Mt. Murano, Mt. Revellone, Mt. Scoccioni and Mt. Valmontagnola), onlapped by the Jurassic - Early Cretaceous basin-fill units. In the Middle Jurassic, a huge block (about 0, 7 km longer axis) of Calcare Massiccio - characterizing the Il Sassone sector - collapsed from the western escarpment of the Mt. Scoccioni or from the Mt. Revellone high, due to tectonic/gravitative instability. The olistolith was embedded in the “Calcari e marne a Posidonia” Fm. (late Toarcian-?late Bajocian), and subsequently was onlapped by the “Calcari Diasprigni” (?late Bajocian-early Kimmeridgian) and “Calcari ad aptici e Saccocoma” (Kimmeridgian p. p. -early Tithonian) Fms. Additional stratigraphic evidence for tectonic instability across the study area is found in the Middle Jurassic with gravity flow deposits, slumps and breccias bearing Calcare Massiccio clasts. The specimen {{was discovered in}} the Upper Jurassic deposits onlapping the Il Sassone mega-olistolith. It was embedded in green and reddish limestones and cherty-limestones referable to the “Calcari ad aptici e Saccocoma” Fm. The faunal assemblage includes belemnites (Duvalia spp.), aptychi (Laevaptychus sp., ?Laevilamellaptychus sp.), rhyncholites (Leptocheilus sp.), shark teeth (hexanchiforms), trace fossils (Thalassinoides sp., Chondrites sp.), radiolarians, calcisphaerulids and abundant Saccocoma tenella. These elements, coupled with the absence of S. vernioryi, Chitinoidella spp. and calpionellids, constrain the age of the ichthyosaur to the late Kimmeridgian - earliest Tithonian...|$|R
