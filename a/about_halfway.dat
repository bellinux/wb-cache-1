5|$|As the {{previous}} storm was moving along the coastline {{of the southeastern}} United States, a new hurricane was observed in the western Caribbean Sea, <b>about</b> <b>halfway</b> between Honduras and Jamaica. Its intensity, based on a ship report, was estimated at 105mph (165km/h). The hurricane moved slowly west-northwestward, and another ship experienced its strong winds on October7. There were no further observations, so its complete track is unknown.|$|E

5000|$|Michael O'Brien of Screen Invasion {{praised the}} episode's {{criticism}} of the September 2012 replacement referee controversy, observing that the series' timing enables it to produce episodes that are relevant, though he opined that the running sarcasm dialogue [...] "runs tedious at <b>about</b> the <b>halfway</b> point" [...] and [...] "teeter-totters on the line of hit and miss". O'Brien nonetheless stated that he laughed out loud during the Butters storyline.|$|R
5|$|After {{leaving the}} main line {{immediately}} south of Hellingly, the railway passed over gated level crossings at Park Road and New Road. Farm Siding, a single siding on {{the west of the}} line beyond the crossings, was a collection point for the farm's agricultural produce {{in the early years of}} the railway, but later fell out of use. The line climbed most of the way from here to the hospital at 1 in 50. <b>About</b> <b>halfway</b> between Hellingly and the hospital the line entered the hospital grounds, passing to the west of Park House Siding, which served the hospital's Park House annexe.|$|E
5|$|HMS Audacious {{was ordered}} on 29 April 1867 from Robert Napier in Govan, Glasgow. She was laid down on 26 June 1867 and {{launched}} on 27 February 1869 in a gale. The winds caught {{the rear of}} the ship as she was <b>about</b> <b>halfway</b> down the slipway and twisted her enough that some plates and frames of her bottom were damaged. The ship was completed on 10 September 1870 and commissioned the following month. She cost £256,291 to build.|$|E

5|$|Now a {{tropical}} depression, Gilda remained nearly stationary for another 24 hours before accelerating northeastward, {{under the influence}} of an upper-level trough exiting the east coast of the United States. Cold air from the trough interacted with Gilda, providing a baroclinic environment for intensifying, and on October 24 the storm transitioned into a subtropical storm <b>about</b> <b>halfway</b> between Hispaniola and North Carolina. This made Gilda the first tropical storm on record to transition into a subtropical cyclone. Operationally, tropical storm advisories were still issued on Gilda while it was subtropical, due to the need to maintain consistency and the possibility it could again become tropical. The circulation of the storm became very large, at one point stretching from New England to the Bahamas, and eastward beyond Bermuda, or a diameter of more than 1300 mi (2100 km). On October 25, Gilda passed <b>about</b> <b>halfway</b> between Bermuda and Cape Hatteras, when it reached peak winds of 70 mph (110 km/h). Subsequently it turned northeastward, and on October 27 attained a minimum pressure of 984 mbar, the lowest of its duration while tropical or subtropical. Later that day, Gilda became an extratropical cyclone southeast of the Canadian Maritimes as it moved over colder waters. After passing just southeast of Newfoundland, the storm continued northeastward, becoming nearly stationary off the coast of Greenland before dissipating on October 30.|$|E
5|$|Pistorius {{has been}} using the same Össur blades since 2004. He was born without fibulae and with malformed feet, and his legs were amputated <b>about</b> <b>halfway</b> between knee and ankle so he could wear {{prosthetic}} legs. He wears socks and pads which are visible above the sockets to reduce chafing and to prevent blisters, and the sockets have straps in the front that can be tightened to make the prosthesis fit more snugly.|$|E
5000|$|Awarding {{the album}} three stars from HM Magazine, Barry Stagg writes, [...] "Ace Augustine is stuck trying to serve two masters." [...] Chad Bowar, rating the album three stars for About.com, states, [...] "Their music is {{sometimes}} dark, heavy and brooding, other times melodic and upbeat ... They stay {{mostly in the}} comfortable confines of the genre box, but stretch themselves periodically". Giving the album three stars at Indie Vision Music, Brody Barbour says, [...] "'The Sick and Suffering' starts off strong, but after <b>about</b> the <b>halfway</b> point, the record loses a decent amount of steam save for a few moments." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{segment of}} I-65 north of Indianapolis {{heads in the}} {{direction}} of Chicago, Illinois. US 52 runs concurrently until the north side of Lebanon. From this point US 52 runs parallel to I-65. At <b>about</b> the <b>halfway</b> point to the end of I-65 and Indianapolis, I-65 passes through Lafayette. I-65 crosses the Wabash River in Lafayette and passes next to Prophetstown State Park. North of Lafayette, I-65 passes through the open flatlands of northwest Indiana. Protruding from the fields are some of the hundreds of wind turbines of the Benton County Wind Farm and Fowler Ridge Wind Farm.|$|R
5000|$|IGN {{gave the}} game a [...] "Mediocre" [...] rating of 5.6. [...] GameSpot rated the game 5.4, writing, Beavis and Butt-head Do U. {{feels like a}} game that was rushed out at <b>about</b> the <b>halfway</b> point in the {{development}} process - a suspicion that grew stronger after the game's weak finale. Casual Beavis and Butt-head fans might be satisfied with hearing their favorite cartoon characters say the same old stuff in a brand-new place, but discerning fans - and gamers looking for their money's worth in an adventure game - will likely walk away from this one feeling a little bit cheated.|$|R
5|$|Riders enter a plaza with an arched entrance, {{where they}} see the Batman logo {{covering}} the ground with Gotham theming. Lockers rental is also in this area. Riders then wind through either the Flash Pass Que directly to the station or standby line. The standby line leads through gates and leads upstairs into the Transit-style station. A switchback with Six Flags FunTVs is used during busy times <b>about</b> <b>halfway</b> through the standby line.|$|E
5|$|Styracosaurus {{and other}} horned dinosaurs are often {{depicted}} {{in popular culture}} as herd animals. A bonebed composed of Styracosaurus remains is known from the Dinosaur Park Formation of Alberta, <b>about</b> <b>halfway</b> up the formation. This bonebed is associated with different types of river deposits. The mass deaths {{may have been a}} result of otherwise non-herding animals congregating around a waterhole in a period of drought, with evidence suggesting the environment may have been seasonal and semiarid.|$|E
5|$|Two {{pilots were}} filmed. Fascinated by mathematicians, creators Cheryl Heuton and Nicolas Falacci {{decided to create}} a show about one. With the {{encouragement}} of CBS development executives, they wrote several pilots revolving around mathematicians and scientists, including the pilot for Numb3rs, {{over the course of}} 14 years. Knowing that mathematics would not be readily accepted by the general public on its own, Heuton and Falacci in 2003 decided to use the police procedural format to facilitate the acceptance. When Falacci and Heuton pitched the pilot, CBS agreed to produce it <b>about</b> <b>halfway</b> through their presentation.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{transitioning}} into {{a tropical}} cyclone, the depression executed an elongated counter-clockwise loop to the northeast. Conditions favored further intensification, {{and based on}} ship reports, it is estimated the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Bertha early on July28. Bertha quickly strengthened to attain hurricane status early on July29 <b>about</b> <b>halfway</b> between Cape Canaveral, Florida and Bermuda. The strengthening trend was brief, however, as increased vertical wind shear weakened it back to a tropical storm late on July29, with the center exposed from the deep convection. Bertha continued slowly northeastward to ridging from the Bermuda high extending westward to the United States.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} storm was initially encountered near the Lesser Antilles on September9 by the ship Frank W.. Later that day, the ship Mary Ann was dismasted. It {{is estimated that}} the cyclone intensified into a Category1 hurricane around 12:00UTC on September9, with winds reaching 80mph (130km/h). The system moved north-northwestward or nort hward for several days and closely approached Bermuda late on September11. Around that time, some ships to the southeast of the island were damaged during the storm and put into Bermuda as a result. By early on September13, the hurricane was beginning to move in a more northeasterly direction. The bark Machae was dismasted on September14. The cyclone weakened to a {{tropical storm}} early the following day. On September16, the Glad Tiding last observed the storm <b>about</b> <b>halfway</b> between Newfoundland and Ireland.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} {{the west coast}} of Africa on October3. It tracked westward, reaching the Caribbean Sea on October10. By October13, a large area of convection persisted from Hispaniola southwestward through Panama, and {{over the next few days}} the convection organized and concentrated in the northwestern Caribbean Sea. An anticyclone became established near Jamaica on October15, which created a favorable upper-level environment for the system by reducing wind shear. Around the same time, a low-level trough emerged from the Intertropical Convergence Zone, heading north off the coast of Nicaragua. Early on October 16, the system developed into a broad tropical depression <b>about</b> <b>halfway</b> between Central America and Jamaica.|$|E

50|$|The Chase {{is popular}} with {{cross-country}} mountain bike users. The purpose-built XC 'Follow the Dog' trail is an 11 km technically-challenging route, opened in 2005, starting and finishing at the Birches Valley Visitors/Cycle Centre. It {{is open to}} all; however, it is not recommended for beginners. A new section of XC trail was opened in April 2010. The 'Monkey Trail' (11.2 km) is a more technical trail that splits from 'Follow the Dog' at <b>about</b> the <b>halfway</b> point, then rejoins slightly further on.
