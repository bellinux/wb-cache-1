Therefore, in this paper Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) samples were impregnated with a hot melting amid wax. The <b>apparent</b> <b>densities</b> were measured with helium pycnometry and mercury intrusion porosimetry. The pore size distribution was determined by using mercury intrusion porosimetry and samples were visualized with 3 D X-ray tomography. The remaining air void spaces were calculated with all three methods. The <b>apparent</b> <b>densities</b> ranged from 1. 18 g cm-³ till 1. 19 g cm-³ for treated pine and 1. 21 g cm-³ till 1. 23 g cm-³ for treated beech. As {{a result of the}} wax impregnation, the pore volume decreases from 65 - 68 % to 12 - 13 % for pine and from 53 - 58 % to 7 - 9 % for beech. The pore size distribution shifts to smaller pores. The ratio of the micropores measured by mercury intrusion porosimetry is overestimated. On the one hand blocked large pores are compressed by the movement of wax deposits under high pressure during the mercury intrusion porosimetry (“movement-effect”). On the other hand large pores remain unaccessible or are only accessible via smaller openings (“bottle-neck-effect”). Non-invasive 3 D X-ray imaging detects such macropores but the size of the detected pores is limited by the obtained resolution. Therefore both mercury intrusion porosimetry and X-ray tomography are complementary techniques...|$|R

50|$|Because DXA calculates BMD using area (aBMD: areal Bone Mineral Density), {{it is not}} an {{accurate}} measurement of true bone mineral density, which is mass divided by a volume. In order to distinguish DXA BMD from volumetric bone-mineral density, researchers sometimes refer to DXA BMD as an areal bone mineral density (aBMD). The confounding effect of differences in bone size is due to the missing depth value in the calculation of bone mineral density. Despite DXA technology's problems with estimating volume, it is still a fairly accurate measure of bone mineral content. Methods to correct for this shortcoming include the calculation of a volume that is approximated from the projected area measure by DXA. DXA BMD results adjusted in this manner are referred to as the bone mineral <b>apparent</b> <b>density</b> (BMAD) and are a ratio of the bone mineral content versus a cuboidal estimation of the volume of bone. Like the results for aBMD, BMAD results do not accurately represent true bone mineral density, since they use approximations of the bone's volume. BMAD is used primarily for research purposes and is not yet used in clinical settings.|$|E

40|$|Prescribed fire is an important, ecology-driven {{tool for}} {{restoration}} of grassland systems. However, prescribed fire remains controversial for some grassland managers because of reported reductions in bird use of recently burned grasslands. Few studies have evaluated effects of fire on grassland bird {{populations in the}} northern mixed-grass prairie region. Fewer studies yet have examined the influence of fire on nest density or survival. In our review, we found no studies that simultaneously examined effects of fire on duck and passerine nesting. During 1998 – 2003, we examined effects of prescribed fire on the density of upland-nesting ducks and passerines nesting in north-central North Dakota, USA. <b>Apparent</b> nest <b>densities</b> of gadwall (Anas strepera), mallard (A. platyrhynchos), and all duck species combined, were influenced by fire history of study units, although the degree of influence was not compelling. Fire history {{was not related to}} nest densities of blue-winged teal (A. discors), northern shoveler (A. clypeata), or northern pintail (A. acuta); however, <b>apparent</b> nest <b>densities</b> in relation to the number of postfire growing seasons exhibited a strikingly similar pattern among all duck species. When compared to ducks, fire history strongly influenced <b>apparent</b> nest <b>densities</b> of clay-colored sparrow (Spizella pallida), Savannah sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis), and bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorus).

Prescribed fire is critical for restoring the ecology of northernmixed-grass prairies and our findings indicate that reductions in nest densities are limited mostly to the first growing season after fire. Our results support the premise that upland-nesting ducks and several grassland passerine species are adapted to periodic fires occurring at a frequency similar to that of pre-Euro-American settlement of the region...|$|R

Because bone <b>apparent</b> <b>density</b> (i. e. mass per unit volume of bone inclusive of porosities) is a determinant of compressive strength, and thus indicative of compressive loading, recent comparative studies in primates have proposed a structure–function relationship between <b>apparent</b> <b>density</b> of subchondral bone and locomotor behaviours that vary in compressive loading. If such patterns are found in other mammals, then these relationships would be strengthened further.

Computed tomography osteoabsorptiometry was used to visualize the patterns in subchondral <b>apparent</b> <b>density.</b> Suspensory sloths exhibit relatively smaller areas of high <b>apparent</b> <b>density</b> than quadrupedal anteaters.
