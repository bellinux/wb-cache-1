As the weeks progressed and as public discontent mounting on inaction in the match-fixing scandal <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>no</b> small measure the pressure from the then Union Sport Minister Shukdev Singh Dhindsa, Kapil Dev resigned from his position of Indian Cricket Coach on 12 September 2000 vowing farewell to the game of cricket.|$|E
5|$|Buckner {{was given}} a medical leave of absence {{following}} Chickamauga, returning to Virginia, where he engaged in routine work while recovering his strength. His division was sent without him to support Longstreet in the Knoxville Campaign, while the remainder of Bragg's army was defeated in the Chattanooga Campaign. Buckner served on the court martial of Maj. Gen. Lafayette McLaws after that subordinate of Longstreet's was charged with poor performance at Knoxville. Buckner was briefly given command of Maj. Gen. John Bell Hood's division in February 1864, and on March 8, he was given command of the reestablished Department of East Tennessee. The department was a shell of its former self—less than one-third its original size, badly equipped, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>no</b> position to mount an offensive. Buckner was virtually useless to the Confederacy here, and on April 28, {{he was ordered to}} join Edmund Kirby Smith in the Trans-Mississippi Department of the Confederacy.|$|E
5|$|Under Edward I, {{the massive}} {{gatehouse}} {{was built to}} protect the castle entrance, including special protection against undermining. There has been speculation that the royal architect James of Saint George may {{have been responsible for}} the building work, which occurred between 1292–3 at a cost of £477. The reason for the king extending the castle at this time is unclear, as the castle was relatively far from the Welsh border <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>no</b> particular risk of attack. One popular explanation is that given the quantities of weapons and money being stored at the property by this time, the gatehouse was designed to improve the internal security of the castle; the presence of the additional portcullises would also support this explanation. In 1300, the old wooden chapel was rebuilt in stone and in 1310, an extension to the castle wall was constructed at a cost of £40; called 'the Peel', this followed the line of the old motte and gave additional protection to the keep.|$|E

5|$|With the remanned Maratha {{artillery}} silenced, Wellesley {{turned his}} attention to Pohlmann's reformed infantry. Although Maxwell had suffered heavy losses, he had rallied his cavalry and returned to the field of battle. Wellesley ordered him to charge the Maratha left flank, while the infantry moved forward as a single line to meet the centre and right. The cavalry spurred forward but were met with a volley of canister shot which struck Maxwell, killing him instantly. Their momentum lost, the cavalry did not complete their charge but veered away from the Maratha line at the last moment. The British and Madras infantry marched on against the Maratha position but Pohlmann's men, their morale low, did not wait for the attack and instead retreated northwards across the Juah. Descriptions differ as to the manner of their departure: Maratha sources claim the line marched away from the battlefield in an orderly manner on Pohlmann's orders but British accounts claim the Maratha infantry fled in an uncontrolled panic. Berar's irregulars inside Assaye, now leaderless and having witnessed the fate of the regular infantry, abandoned the village and marched off northwards at around 18:00, followed shortly afterwards by the Maratha cavalry. Wellesley's troops, however, were exhausted <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>no</b> condition to pursue and the native allied cavalry which had remained on the south bank of the Kailna and had not been engaged, refused to pursue without the support of the British and Madras cavalry.|$|E

25|$|Total depravity {{does not}} mean, however, {{that people are}} as evil as possible.

Thus, even acts of generosity and altruism are in fact egoist acts in disguise. All good, consequently, is derived from God alone, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>no</b> way through man.|$|E

25|$|Yet, {{notwithstanding}} {{this difference}} as to origin, Father is one with, co-equal to, co-eternal, and con-substantial with the Son and the Holy Spirit, each Person {{being the one}} eternal God <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>no</b> way separated, who is the creator: all alike are uncreated and omnipotent. Thus, the Divine Unity consists of God the Father, with his Son and his Spirit distinct from God the Father and yet perfectly united together in him.

25|$|Since the mid-20th century, it {{has been}} {{understood}} that Maxwell's equations are not exact, but a classical field theory approximation of {{some aspects of the}} fundamental theory of quantum electrodynamics, although some quantum features, such as quantum entanglement, are completely absent <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>no</b> way approximated.
