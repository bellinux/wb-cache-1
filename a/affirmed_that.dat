5|$|Based on morphology, Leonard Compagno grouped Furgaleus with Hemitriakis, Iago, and Gogolia as {{the tribe}} Iagini within the {{subfamily}} Galeorhininae {{of the family}} Triakidae. A 2006 phylogenetic study by J. Andrés López and colleagues, based on four protein-coding gene sequences, <b>affirmed</b> <b>that</b> Furgaleus and Hemitriakis are sister taxa; the study was equivocal regarding the position of Iago and did not include Gogolia.|$|E

5|$|In 1999, Croatia sued Yugoslavia {{before the}} International Court of Justice (ICJ), {{claiming}} genocide {{had been committed}} in Vukovar. Following Serbia and Montenegro's dissolution in 2006, this suit was passed on to Serbia. In February 2015, the ICJ ruled that the battle and ensuing massacre did not constitute genocide, but <b>affirmed</b> <b>that</b> serious crimes had been committed by the JNA and Serb paramilitaries.|$|E
5|$|Based on morphology, John McEachran and Neil Aschliman {{determined}} in a 2004 phylogenetic study that Platyrhinoidis and Platyrhina together form the most basal clade {{of the order}} Myliobatiformes, and are thus the sister group to all {{other members of the}} order (encompassing stingrays and their relatives). This finding <b>affirmed</b> <b>that</b> the thornback guitarfish is not closely related to the true guitarfishes of the family Rhinobatidae, a possibility that had long been considered by taxonomists.|$|E
5|$|Black's {{majority}} opinion in McCollum v. Board of Education (1948) {{held that the}} government could not provide religious instruction in public schools. In Torcaso v. Watkins (1961), he delivered an opinion which <b>affirmed</b> <b>that</b> the states could not use religious tests as qualifications for public office. Similarly, he authored the {{majority opinion}} in Engel v. Vitale (1962), which declared it unconstitutional for states to require the recitation of official prayers in public schools.|$|E

5|$|Chng Suan Tze was {{followed}} by amendments by Parliament to the Constitution and the ISA in 1989 which purported to return the applicable law regarding judicial review of government discretion under the ISA to that in Lee Mau Seng. The legality of these changes was challenged in Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs (1990). In that decision, the Court of Appeal <b>affirmed</b> <b>that</b> the legislative amendments to the Act were plain and unambiguous, and thus validly established that the subjective test of judicial review now applied to internal security matters.|$|E
5|$|Joaquim José Inácio {{was born}} in Lisbon, Kingdom of Portugal. Although the date on his birth {{certificate}} was 30 July 1808, his mother claimed that the correct birthdate was two days later, on 1 August.

Villagers claimed that some of the dead had been arrested days before their deaths and thus could not have been ambushed, as the Yugoslav authorities claimed. Such claims could not be independently verified by Western reporters. In a 1998 report, Amnesty International <b>affirmed</b> <b>that</b> the 19 men had been killed in an ambush while trying to smuggle weapons into Kosovo.|$|E
5|$|Representative {{democracy}} {{began in}} the 1940s {{when the number of}} elected seats in the legislature gradually increased, until a fully elected Legislative Assembly of Singapore was established in 1958. At present, Singapore legislation establishes various mechanisms that fulfil the doctrine of representative democracy. Parliamentary elections in Singapore are required to be held regularly to elect the Parliament through universal suffrage. Although the right to vote in Singapore law is not expressly mentioned in the Constitution, the Government has <b>affirmed</b> <b>that</b> the right may be implied into the constitutional text.|$|E

5|$|When the Republican {{convention}} {{began in}} Philadelphia that June, no {{vice presidential candidate}} had overwhelming support, but Roosevelt had the broadest range of support from around the country. McKinley <b>affirmed</b> <b>that</b> the choice belonged to the convention, not to him. On June 21, McKinley was unanimously renominated and, with Hanna's reluctant acquiescence, Roosevelt was nominated for vice president on the first ballot. The Democratic convention convened the next month in Kansas City and nominated William Jennings Bryan, setting up a rematch of the 1896 contest.|$|E
5|$|After the season, it {{was rumored}} that the Redskins were {{interested}} in promoting him to replace head coach Turk Edwards, but the franchise denied it and Shaughnessy {{would not comment on}} his plans. In January 1947, he quit as Maryland coach, stating {{that he did not want}} to remain athletic director or resign from the Washington Redskins, both of which the school wanted. Shaughnessy said he would work full-time for the Redskins for the remaining year on his contract, and might return to coach only college football at the end of his term, possibly with Maryland. President Byrd <b>affirmed</b> <b>that</b> Shaughnessy's poor 1946 record was not related to his departure. He was replaced by split T proponent Jim Tatum.|$|E

The then Zambian president Kenneth Kaunda openly asked Malawi to go on war with Zambia to claim the province and also <b>affirmed</b> <b>that</b> Zambia would not have trade relations with Malawi until the claim on territory was withdrawn. The expansionist ambition of Malawi was discontinued and the Eastern Province remained with Zambia.|$|E

5|$|Both Eisenhower's {{speech to}} the excited crowd and {{telegram}} to his running mate were noncommittal. The general applauded his running mate for his speech, but stated that the two had to meet face to face before a final decision could be made. While Eisenhower <b>affirmed</b> <b>that</b> the RNC {{had the power to}} elect a replacement candidate, Eisenhower indicated that the committee would, most likely, be guided by his wishes. Eisenhower asked Nixon to meet with him in person in Wheeling, West Virginia, where the general's campaign was next scheduled to go. Eisenhower's telegram was delayed in transmission and lost among the flood being sent to Nixon's suite, and the latter learned of his running mate's position from a wire service report.|$|E
5|$|However, in 1955, in {{a similar}} case {{involving}} another woman, Mrs. Clarice B. Covert, who had killed her husband in England with an axe, Federal District Court Judge Edward A. Tamm ruled that civilians who accompany military forces overseas could not be imprisoned by military courts. The two cases, Kinsella v. Krueger and Reid v. Covert, went to the US Supreme Court, which <b>affirmed</b> <b>that</b> military trials of civilians were indeed constitutional, only to reverse itself a year later {{in a review of}} the decisions. Dorothy was released, and went to live with Krueger in San Antonio.|$|E
5|$|In {{the days}} {{following}} the earthquake, most of South Africa's major banks and insurance companies had begun receiving insurance claims. By 6August 2014, ABSA had received 200 claims, Standard Bank had received 129 claims and Mutual & Federal had received 11 claims. A survey of 17 insurance companies done by finance website Justmoney showed that 5 out of the 17 companies surveyed would reject insurance claims related to the earthquake if it was proven to be mining-related. In {{a response to the}} Survey, ABSA, who was on the list of 5, <b>affirmed</b> <b>that</b> they have received approximately 1100 claims and {{were in the process of}} finalising them.|$|E
