5|$|A pancake {{machine is}} an electrically-powered machine that {{automatically}} produces cooked pancakes. It {{is believed that}} the earliest known pancake machine was invented in the United States in 1928. Several types of pancake machines exist that perform in various manners, for both commercial and home use. Some are fully automatic in operation, while others are semi-automatic. Some companies mass-produce pancake machines, <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>have</b> been homemade. The Happy Egg Company constructed a novelty pancake machine in 2013 in commemoration of Pancake Day in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Ctenophores form {{an animal}} phylum {{that is more}} complex than sponges, about as complex as cnidarians (jellyfish, sea anemones, etc.), and less complex than bilaterians (which include almost all other animals). Unlike sponges, both ctenophores and cnidarians have: cells bound by inter-cell {{connections}} and carpet-like basement membranes; muscles; nervous systems; <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>have</b> sensory organs. Ctenophores are distinguished from all other animals by having colloblasts, which are sticky and adhere to prey, although a few ctenophore species lack them.|$|E
5|$|Elaborate lattices {{are found}} in Indian Jaali work, carved in marble to adorn tombs and palaces. Chinese lattices, always with some symmetry, exist in 14 of the 17 {{wallpaper}} groups; they often have mirror, double mirror, or rotational symmetry. Some have a central medallion, <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>have</b> a border in a frieze group. Many Chinese lattices have been analysed mathematically by Daniel S. Dye; he identifies Sichuan as {{the centre of the}} craft.|$|E

5|$|Much of the Mendips is open {{calcareous}} grassland, {{supporting a}} wide variety of flowering plants and insects. Some parts are deciduous ancient woodland, <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>have</b> been used intensively for arable agriculture, particularly since World WarI. As the demand for arable land in Britain declined, some areas were returned to grassland, but the use of fertilisers and herbicides has reduced its biodiversity. Grazing by rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), sheep (Ovis aries) and cattle (Bos taurus) maintains the grassland habitat.|$|E
5|$|Reportedly, all {{of those}} under {{scrutiny}} are now rarely seen in public <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>have</b> apparently left the country. They are also reportedly the subjects of an ongoing investigation to determine if any of their business practices warrant criminal prosecution.|$|E
5|$|The basidia (spore-bearing cells) measure 24–33 by 6.6–8.8μm, {{and may be}} {{attached}} to anywhere from one to four spores, although four-spored basidia are most common. They are hyaline to sometimes somewhat yellowish, club-shaped or roughly cylindrical, <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>have</b> a slight constriction around the middle. The cheilocystidia (cystidia {{on the edge of}} a gill) are abundant, forming a sterile band on the gill edge. They are hyaline, fusoid-ampullaceous (with a shape ranging from a spindle to a swollen bottle), with dimensions of 20–45 by 5–8.2μm, and have a filamentous neck measuring 6–11 by 1.6–2.5μm. The pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) are scattered, similar to the cheilocystidia in form and size, hyaline, <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>have</b> bifurcated or branched necks.|$|E
50|$|There {{has been}} {{quite a bit of}} {{criticism}} of the World3 model. <b>Some</b> <b>has</b> come from the model creators themselves, <b>some</b> <b>has</b> come from economists <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>has</b> come from other places.|$|R

5|$|The pygmy {{blue whale}} formed from a founder group of Antarctic blue whales about 20,000 years ago, around the Last Glacial Maximum. This is likely because blue whales were driven north by {{expanding}} ice, <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>have</b> stayed there ever since. The pygmy blue whale's evolutionarily recent origins {{cause it to}} have a relatively low genetic diversity.|$|E
5|$|While {{many species}} of pigeons and doves have benefited from human {{activities}} and have increased their ranges, many other species have declined in numbers <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>have</b> become threatened or even succumbed to extinction. Among the ten species to have become extinct since 1600 (the conventional date for estimating modern extinctions) {{are two of the}} most famous extinct species, the dodo and the passenger pigeon.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the larger}} Languedoc AOC appellations are several sub-districts, or Cru's, with {{distinct}} wine styles of their own. Some of these sub-districts have pending AOC applications to become appellations {{in their own}} right <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>have</b> been granted sub-appellations to the umbrella appellation Languedoc AOC. These include the Quatourze, La Clape, Montpeyroux, St. Saturnin, Picpoul de Pinet, Terrasses du Larzac, and Pic St.-Loup.|$|E

5|$|According to Armando Maya Castro, many {{students}} {{who are members of}} the church have been discriminated against for refusing to partake in celebrations and customs concerning the Day of the Dead in their schools, <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>have</b> been punished for it. In one case reported by a Mexican newspaper, La Gaceta, a female member of the church was pushed by a fellow bus passenger, who then crossed herself because the member was wearing a long skirt. In July 25, 2008, a public official sealed the entrance to a La Luz del Mundo temple in Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco, trapping the congregation inside until other officials removed the seals. This incident occurred because of complaints from individuals who did not like the presence of the church in the area. Reporter Rodolfo Chávez Calderón stated that the church was in compliance with local laws.|$|E
5|$|Arran has a {{particular}} concentration of early Neolithic Clyde Cairns, a form of Gallery grave. The typical style of these structures is a rectangular or trapezoidal stone and earth mound that encloses a chamber lined with larger stone slabs. Pottery and bone fragments found inside the chambers suggest they were used for interment <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>have</b> forecourts, {{which may have been}} an area for public display or ritual. There are two good examples in Monamore Glen west of the village of Lamlash, and similar structures called the Giants' Graves above Whiting Bay. There are numerous standing stones dating from prehistoric times, including six stone circles on Machrie Moor (Gaelic: Am Machaire).|$|E
5|$|Atlus {{has created}} or hosted media {{dedicated}} to the Persona series. A dedicated magazine originally ran for ten issues between 2011 and 2012, and has been irregularly revived since then. An official talk show released on the official Persona website and Niconico, Persona Stalkers Club, began in February 2014. Hosted by freelance writer Mafia Kajita and actress Tomomi Isomura, {{it was designed to}} deepen the connection between Atlus and the Persona fanbase. Concerts featuring music from the Persona series have also been performed, <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>have</b> received commercial releases on home media in Japan. Action figures and merchandise such as clothing related to Persona 3 and 4 have also been produced.|$|E

5|$|Butterflies are {{threatened}} {{in their early}} stages by parasitoids and in all stages by predators, diseases and environmental factors. Braconid and other parasitic wasps lay their eggs in lepidopteran eggs or larvae and the wasps' parasitoid larvae devour their hosts, usually pupating inside or outside the desiccated husk. Most wasps are very specific about their host species <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>have</b> been used as biological controls of pest butterflies like the large white butterfly. When the small cabbage white was accidentally introduced to New Zealand, it had no natural enemies. In order to control it, some pupae that had been parasitised by a chalcid wasp were imported, and natural control was thus regained. Some flies lay their eggs {{on the outside of}} caterpillars and the newly hatched fly larvae bore their way through the skin and feed in a similar way to the parasitoid wasp larvae. Predators of butterflies include ants, spiders, wasps, and birds.|$|E
5|$|Cnidarians form {{an animal}} phylum {{that are more}} complex than sponges, about as complex as ctenophores (comb jellies), and less complex than bilaterians, which include almost all other animals. However, both cnidarians and ctenophores are more complex than sponges as they have: cells bound by inter-cell {{connections}} and carpet-like basement membranes; muscles; nervous systems; <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>have</b> sensory organs. Cnidarians are distinguished from all other animals by having cnidocytes that fire like harpoons and are used mainly to capture prey. In some species, cnidocytes {{can also be used}} as anchors.|$|E
5|$|Due to the BBC's 1970s junking policy, 97 episodes {{from the}} 1960s are missing, {{with the result}} that 26 serials are incomplete, {{although}} all of these still exist as audio recordings, <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>have</b> been reconstructed. In the first two seasons and most of the third, each episode of a serial had an individual title; no serial had an overall on-screen title until The Savages. The serial titles given below are the most common title for the serials as a whole, used in sources such as the Doctor Who Reference Guide and the BBC's classic episode guide, and are generally those used for commercial release. The practice of individually titled episodes resurfaced with the show's 2005 revival, when Doctor Whos serial nature was abandoned in favour of an episodic format.|$|E

Specimens very greatly in color <b>and</b> spots. <b>Some</b> <b>has</b> purplish grey patches on both wings, <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>has</b> ochreous patches on disk and center of margin of both wings. Another morph has ochreous or white suffusion on sub-marginal area of fore wings and postmedial area of hind wings.|$|R
50|$|The PDC {{also held}} {{a number of}} other tournaments during 2007. These were mainly smaller events with low prize money, <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>had</b> {{eligibility}} restrictions. All of these tournaments were non-ranking.|$|R
5|$|Flint scrapers, {{knives and}} other {{materials}} associated with neolithic humans were discovered on the moor in the late 19th and early 20th century by local antiquarians such as Charles Roeder. The Roman road from Manchester (Mamucium) to Ribchester (Bremetennacum) roughly followed {{the line of the}} A56 road (Bury New Road) which is just to the east of Kersal Moor. There was a Roman camp at Rainsough just to the west, <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>have</b> speculated {{that there may have been}} a second camp to the east, in the area known as Castle Hill, making a defensive line across the moor to protect the north of Mamucium.|$|E
5|$|In Great Britain, the Percheron is {{used for}} {{advertising}} and publicity, as well as forestry and farm work. They are crossbred with lighter horses by breeders of heavy hunters {{in order to increase}} size and improve disposition. Purebred Percherons are also ridden, <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>have</b> proven useful at show jumping. Crossbred Percherons have been used successfully in dressage. In both the Falkland Islands and northern Australia, Percherons have been crossed with local mares, primarily Criollos in the Falklands, to produce larger stock horses with greater stamina. These crossbred horses are used extensively in both the sub-Antarctic climate of the Falklands and the sub-tropical climate of Australia for working stock. In Australia they are also crossed with Thoroughbreds for use as mounted police horses.|$|E
5|$|In Iran, some golden jackals carry {{intestinal}} worms (helminths) and Echinococcus granulosus. In Israel, some jackals carry intestinal helminths and Leishmania tropica infection. In Romania, a jackal {{was found}} to be carrying Trichinella britovi. In northeastern Italy, the jackal is a carrier of the tick species Ixodes ricinus and Dermacentor reticulatus, and the smallest human fluke Metagonimus yokogawai that can be caught from ingesting infected raw fish, which can lead to metagonimiasis. In Hungary, some jackals carry dog heartworm Dirofilaria immitis, <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>have</b> provided the first record in Hungary of Trichinella spiralis and the first record in Europe of Echinococcus multilocularis. The jackal is dispersing across Europe through rivers and valleys, bringing parasites into regions where these did not previously exist.|$|E
30|$|The {{majority}} of the participants <b>had</b> <b>some</b> kind of functional arm/arms, i.e. some type of grip function, although approximately only half of the patients had a bilateral proper pincer grasp <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>had</b> very short upper limbs.|$|R
50|$|Many years ago, {{the parish}} of Easington {{included}} Turmarr, Hoton, Northorpe, Dimlington, Old Kilnsea and Ravenser. These villages {{have been lost}} to the ever-encroaching sea, <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>had</b> disappeared as early as 1400.|$|R
