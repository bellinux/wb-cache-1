40|$|Minute {{amounts of}} M protein were {{detected}} in culture supernates of virulent Group A streptococci by type-specific inhibition {{of the long}} chain and the bactericidal tests for <b>anti-M</b> <b>antibody.</b> The amount of M protein that was detected by the inhibition of these biological systems was less than could be demonstrated by precipitation tests. All strains of streptococci rich in M protein which were studied formed long chains when grown in sufficient concentrations of <b>anti-M</b> <b>antibody.</b> Very low concentrations of <b>anti-M</b> <b>antibody</b> escaped detection by the long chain test when strains of excessive M protein content were employed. Under such conditions the bactericidal test detected <b>anti-M</b> <b>antibody</b> more sensitively than the long chain test owing to the smaller inoculum employed in the former method.

40|$|In {{preceding}} studies (1, 2) most virulent {{strains of}} Group A streptococci {{were found to}} form long chains when grown {{in the presence of}} homologous antiserum.

In these initial studies, however, certain exceptional strains of virulent organisms were noted which failed to form long chains in some antisera. Furthermore, some convalescent human sera from patients infected with known serological types of Group A streptococci showed discrepancies between the bactericidal and the long chain tests for <b>anti-M</b> <b>antibody.</b> The present study indicates that the above discrepancies can be explained most often by quantitative relationships between M protein and <b>anti-M</b> <b>antibody</b> in the system.

40|$|The {{interrelation}} {{between the}} humoral and cellular {{factors in the}} development of immunity to experimental streptococcal infection was investigated. Early resistance to infection was caused by stimulating the phagocytic cells to function efficiently in the absence of opsonins. Subsequently, the appearance of cytophilic antibodies provided further means for elimination of streptococci. Thus, {{in the early stages of}} specific antistreptococcal immunity, resistance was observed in the absence of circulating <b>anti-M</b> <b>antibodies.</b> The type-specific antibodies that appeared in the later stage did not seem to improve clearance of streptococci in the splanchnic tissues. After an intravenous lethal challenge of mice with virulent streptococci, these antibodies did not provide increased protection.

After birth, there was a significantly higher increase of IgA and IgM <b>anti-M.</b> leprae <b>antibody</b> activity in sera taken 3 - 6 months after birth from babies of Group 1 compared to Group 2, but the IgA and IgM activity in sera taken after 6 months of age showed the same increase in the two groups.

40|$|Much {{evidence}} supports {{the concept that}} immunity to Group A streptococcal infection is type-specific; that is, that recovery from infection with one type of Group A streptococcus results in immunity to that type only. The M protein antigen in Group A streptococcal cell walls determines the serologic type specificity of various strains and {{is an important factor}} associated with strain virulence. Antibody to the M protein plays a fundamental role in immunity to Group A streptococcal infection and is, indeed, the only antibody known at present to confer significant protection against this organism (1 - 6). Despite the importance of <b>anti-M</b> <b>antibody,</b> extensive studies of its behavior in human streptococcal infections have been seriously hampered by the difficult and laborious biological methods heretofore available for its detection in human sera (7, 8).

Of these volunteers 20 had had severe clinical reactions (influenza-like); there had been 19 moderate reactions (lesser degrees of constitutional illness), and the remaining 141 reactions had been graded mild, very mild, or nil. Only 2 volunteers were shown to have antibodies to M in the pre-trial serum samples, and 11 developed anti-M rises after virus inoculation. Nine of the 11 had had severe reactions, and 2 had had moderate reactions. There was, therefore, a clear correlation between severity of clinical illness and <b>anti-M</b> <b>antibody</b> formation. In general, anti-M increases coincided with increases to the hemagglutinins and nucleoprotein, and with virus shedding.

40|$|The surface M protein {{of group}} A streptococci (GAS) {{is one of}} the major {{virulence}} factors for this pathogen. Antibodies to the M protein can facilitate opsonophagocytosis by phagocytic cells present in human blood. We investigated whether pooled normal immunoglobulin G (IVIG) contains antibodies that can opsonize and enhance the phagocytosis of type M 1 strains of GAS and whether the levels of these antibodies vary for different IVIG preparations. We focused on the presence of <b>anti-M</b> 1 <b>antibodies</b> because the M 1 T 1 serotype accounts for the majority of recent invasive GAS clinical isolates in our surveillance studies. The level of <b>anti-M</b> 1 <b>antibodies</b> in three commercial IVIG preparations was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and the opsonic activity of these antibodies was determined by neutrophil-mediated opsonophagocytosis of a representative M 1 T 1 isolate. High levels of opsonic <b>anti-M</b> 1 <b>antibodies</b> were found in all IVIG preparations tested, and there was a good correlation between ELISA titers and opsonophagocytic activity. However, there was no significant difference in the levels of opsonic <b>anti-M</b> 1 <b>antibodies</b> among the various IVIG preparations or lots tested. Adsorption of IVIG with M 1 T 1 bacteria removed the anti-M 1 opsonic activity, while the level of anti-M 3 opsonophagocytosis was unchanged.

40|$|A micro {{complement}} fixation assay was devised {{to measure the}} type-specificity of <b>anti-M</b> <b>antibody.</b> Unabsorbed sera were from rabbits hyperimmunized with heat-killed streptococci and from humans with naturally occurring antibody or immunized with purified M protein vaccines.

40|$|The surface M protein {{of group}} A streptococci is {{responsible}} for resistance of the organism to complement-mediated opsonization and phagocytosis (1). We have shown that M protein on intact streptococcal cells binds fibrinogen (2, 3) and that the bound fibrinogen prevents opsonization by complement in nonimmune human blood (2). Bound fibrinogen also inhibits opsonization by low concentrations of <b>anti-M</b> <b>antibody</b> of the homologous serotype and can, in some cases, prevent opsonization by heterologous crossreactive anti-M sera (4). The resistance to phagocytosis of M-positive streptococci suspended in serum is intermediate between that of organisms suspended in plasma and organisms from which the M protein has been removed by trypsin (2). Accordingly, we have concluded that binding of fibrinogen contributes to the antiopsonic activity of M protein in whole blood. The present investigation was undertaken to see if digested fibrinogen and fibrin bind to M protein and, if so, whether they retain the antiopsonic properties of intact fibrinogen. This question arises because most streptococcal infection...|$|E

In tuberculoid leprosy patients, a significant increase in IgG <b>anti-M.</b> leprae <b>antibody</b> levels was observed in the more widespread forms of the disease, but positive antibody responses were especially predominant among patients with active lesions. Lepromatous leprosy patients generally demonstrated high levels of both IgG and IgM <b>anti-M.</b> leprae <b>antibodies,</b> but no relation was found between the antibody responses and bacillary load or other clinical parameters.

As previously reported for type 24 streptococci, fibrinogen inhibited the complement-mediated opsonization of types 5, 6, and 19 organisms. Rabbit antisera against large peptide fragments of purified homologous M proteins (pep M proteins) overcame the anti- opsonic effect of fibrinogen in a dose-dependent manner.

Labeling the sections with anti-fibrinogen or anti-fragment D showed that the fibrinogen-binding region lay within a 25 -nm segment of the fibrillae beginning approximately 30 nm from the inner surface of the cell wall. The outer surface of the fibrinogen layer could be labeled with antibody to the amino-terminal half of type 24 M protein, indicating that the fibrillar tips remained exposed after fibrinogen binding. The degree of labeling with anti-fibrinogen, determined by gold particle counting, was the same whether the bacterial cells had been incubated with purified fibrinogen or whole plasma. These {{results indicate that the}} fibrinogen-binding region lies in the distal (amino-terminal) half of the M protein molecule but excludes the most distal portion, which is the site of epitopes that interact with opsonic <b>anti-M</b> <b>antibody,</b> and that plasma proteins other than fibrinogen, a number of which are known to bind to group A streptococci, do not interfere with fibrinogen binding...|$|E
40|$|Antimitochondrial {{antibodies}} {{are found}} in 85 to 95 % of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. Nine different patterns have been identified but only four are associated with primary biliary cirrhosis. <b>Anti-M</b> 2 <b>antibodies</b> are specific for the disease. The M 2 antigen {{was found to be}} composed of five antigen determinants and related to the E 2 component of three multienzyme complexes located within mitochondria. Anti-M 4 and M 8 antibodies appear invariably associated with anti-M 2 and are markers for the "overlap syndrome" between primary biliary cirrhosis and chronic active hepatitis as well as for poor prognosis. <b>Anti-M</b> 9 <b>antibodies</b> are preferentially associated with early and/or asymptomatic disease. Antinuclear antibodies {{are found in}} 24 to 58 % of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. Six various patterns have been reported. Antibodies directed to the 200 kD polypeptide of the nuclear pore and giving a perinuclear fluorescence are specific for primary biliary cirrhosis. Patients with such antibodies exhibit a less symptomatic disease and lower titers of anti-M 2 than those without...|$|R
40|$|To {{demonstrate}} local {{synthesis of}} anti-Mycobacterium leprae antibodies, biopsies from skin lesions of leprosy patients were cultured in vitro {{in a medium}} containing 14 C-labeled lysine and isoleucine, and the culture fluids were analyzed by crossed immunoelectrophoresis with intermediate gel and autoradiography. The results show that <b>anti-M.</b> leprae <b>antibodies</b> were synthesized in vitro in the biopsies from the skin lesions of leprosy patients and that the specificity of the locally produced antibodies varied from patient to patient...|$|R
40|$|The {{pathogenicity}} and invasiveness {{of group}} A streptococci for man, {{as well as}} for laboratory animals, {{have been shown to be}} closely correlated with the presence of the M protein; conflicting evidence, however, has been obtained by several groups of investigators with regard to the r 61 e of the hyalttronic acid capsule in the manifestation of virulence of these microorganisms. A number of studies have been carried out in an effort to ascertain the effect of these substances on the pathogenesis of streptococcal infections. Several workers have studied the protective action in mice, infected with group A streptococci, of immune serum containing antibodies directed against the M substance. Others have studied the protective effect of hydrolyzing the capsular material with an enzyme, hyaluronidase. As a result of the antibody studies the M substance has been shown to be essential for the exhibition of virulence, since <b>anti-M</b> <b>antibodies</b> provide active and passive protection of mice against infection with virulent streptococci of homologous type (1 - 3). On the other hand, the relation of the hyaluronic acid capsule to mouse virulence is not so well defined. While Hirst (4) was able to protect mice infecte...|$|R
