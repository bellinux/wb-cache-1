40|$|Today's Army {{has gone}} through some {{incredible}} transformations {{since the end of}} the Cold War. Since then, the Army has struggled with Force XXI concepts, and more recently, the concept of the "Prototype Brigade. " This monograph examines other periods of transformation to determine whether any of the lessons learned can be applied to current force structure changes. Specifically, the monograph conducts an in-depth study of the 11 th Air Assault Division (Test) from 1963 - 1965, when the Army conducted extensive experimentation with <b>airmobility</b> and helicopter operations. The monograph begins its study with an examination of a framework for analysis. Using the US Army Training and Doctrine Command's "domains " of Doctrine, Training, Leadership, Organization, Material, and Soldier Systems (DTLOMS), the monograph first proves that this is a valid methodology for analyzing change. It does this by showing that all "revolutions in military affairs (RMA) " have occurred when the DTLOMS all converge to provide a synergy to each other. Once the framework of DTLOMS is shown to be valid, the monograph applies the framework to the transformation of the US Army to <b>airmobility</b> in the early 1960 's...|$|E

Mobility was just mobility, it saved lives or took them all the time. Michael Herr, Dispatches Blades thumping rhythmically, the Bell UH- 1 “Huey ” Iroquois helicopter, oneof the many war craft {{carrying}} America into 1960 s Vietnam, flies across the abyss between the late mechanization of World War II and the current virtuality of cyberwar in transparent battlespace. The gas-turbine-powered Huey turboshaft rotor marks an event in early-postmodern war, as America once again finds itself both through and in high technology. The rotor that turned lazily during the early days of battle in Vietnam is now running at full throttle, holding aloft the Boeing Sikorsky RAH- 66 Comanche stealth helicopter as it flies backward, banks verti-cally, and slips sideways, sliding fluidly through the battlefield of C 4 I 2 (command, control, communication, computing, intelligence, and interoperability). The spin-ning machine typifies what Chris Gray (1997 : 50) calls postmodern war, a con-stellation of “computation and information, the increases in speed, the prolifera-tion of contradictory trends, strange marriages and alliances, machine mediations of culture. ” In this essay, I approach the helicopter as a sign of postmodern war from a phe-nomenological perspective. Initially, the helicopter seems to be yet another piec...|$|E
