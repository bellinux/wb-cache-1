5|$|In 1619, King James I {{decreed that}} the American colonists of Jamestown {{would need to}} step up efforts to do their fair share towards {{supporting}} England. The Virginia Company enacted the decree, asking Jamestown's land owners to grow and export 100 hemp plants to help support England's cause. Later the colonists would grow it to support its expansion in the Americas. George Washington grew hemp at Mount Vernon {{as one of his}} three primary crops. The use of hemp for rope <b>and</b> <b>fabric</b> later became ubiquitous throughout the 18th and 19th centuries in the United States. Medicinal preparations of cannabis became available in American pharmacies in the 1850s following an introduction to its use in Western medicine by William O'Shaughnessy a decade earlier in 1839.|$|E
5|$|Roman myth {{has it that}} Venus, {{the goddess}} of love, {{was born in the}} sea and emerged {{accompanied}} by fish and dolphins, with Botticelli depicting her as arriving in a scallop shell. The Romans revered her and erected shrines in her honour in their gardens, praying to her to provide water and verdant growth. From this, the scallop and other bivalve shells came {{to be used as a}} symbol for fertility. Its depiction is used in architecture, furniture <b>and</b> <b>fabric</b> design and it is the logo of Royal Dutch Shell, the global oil and gas company.|$|E

The scenes filmed at the Emerald City were elaborate, utilizing 650 dancers, 385 crew members and 1,200 costumes. Costume designer Tony Walton enlisted the help of high fashion designers in New York City for the Emerald City sequence, and obtained exotic costumes <b>and</b> <b>fabric</b> from designers such as Oscar de la Renta and Norma Kamali. Albert Whitlock created the film's visual special effects, while Stan Winston served as the head makeup artist.|$|E

40|$|Core {{spun yarn}} with shape memory fibre and cotton were {{developed}} using a {{ring spinning frame}} and friction spinning machine. Shape memory fabrics were woven from two kinds of shape memory core spun yarns, and the mechanical and shape memory properties of the yarns <b>and</b> <b>fabrics</b> were examined. The yarns have a good weave ability, and the yarns <b>and</b> <b>fabrics</b> have a good shape memory fix and recovery properties.

5|$|The company {{adapted the}} old {{gas station and}} café to act as the community's chamber of {{commerce}} and visitor center while preserving the building's architectural features and historical authenticity. Old photographs and interviews with residents were used to aid the company in uncovering the buildings original details. They peeled away decades of paint layers <b>and</b> <b>fabric</b> to find the original interior and exterior colors. One of the more difficult aspects was in restoring the neon accents. While historical photographs showed where neon existed, {{they had all been}} taken during the daytime when the neon lights were off, making it difficult to determine what color the lights originally were.|$|E
5|$|Neuroscientist and {{psychologist}} Pascal Wallisch {{states that}} while inherently ambiguous stimuli {{have been known}} to vision science for many years, this is the first such stimulus in the colour domain that was {{brought to the attention of}} science by social media. He attributes differential perceptions to differences in illumination <b>and</b> <b>fabric</b> priors, but also notes that the stimulus is highly unusual insofar as the perception of most people does not switch. If it does, it does so only on very long time scales, which is highly unusual for bistable stimuli, so perceptual learning might be at play. In addition, he says that discussions of this stimulus are not frivolous, as the stimulus is both of interest to science and a paradigmatic case of how different people can sincerely see the world differently, an acknowledgement of which is a precondition for world peace. Daniel Hardiman-McCartney of the College of Optometrists stated that the picture was ambiguous, suggesting that the illusion was caused by a strong yellow light shining onto the dress, and human perception of the colours of the dress and light source by comparing them with other colours and objects in the picture. The philosopher Barry C. Smith compared the phenomenon with Ludwig Wittgenstein and the rabbit–duck illusion.|$|E
5|$|The I-6 had an oval-section {{semi-monocoque}} fuselage {{covered with}} 'shpon', molded birch plywood, {{with a small}} headrest faired into the fuselage, although the engine was enclosed in a metal cowling that left the cylinder heads exposed for better cooling. The two-spar wings were covered in plywood <b>and</b> <b>fabric</b> and had a Clark Y profile. Internal bracing wires were fitted to reinforce the wings. The control surfaces were framed in duralumin, but covered in fabric. The duralumin N-type struts that separated the wings, and attached the upper wing to the fuselage, had a teardrop profile. They were reinforced with steel bracing wires. The conventional undercarriage was fixed with rubber shock absorbers. The wooden propeller was given a spinner. The lighter weight of the air-cooled Jupiter engine, which required neither a heavy radiator nor coolant, meant that the I-6 had an empty weight only 62% of that of the I-3.|$|E

5|$|Until the mid-18th century, {{the region}} in and around Chadderton was {{dominated}} by dispersed agricultural settlements. During this period the population was fewer than 1,000, broadly consisting of farmers who were involved with pasture, but who supplemented their incomes by working in cottage industries, particularly fustian and silk weaving. A fulling mill at Chadderton by the River Irk was recorded during the Elizabethan era, and during the Early Modern period the weavers of Chadderton had been using spinning wheels in makeshift weavers' cottages to produce woollens. Primitive early 18th-century industrialisation developed slowly in Chadderton. However, as the demand for cotton goods increased and the technology of cotton-spinning machinery improved during the mid-18th century, the need for larger structures to house bigger, better, and more efficient equipment became apparent. A water-powered cotton mill was built at Chadderton's Stock Brook in 1776. The damp climate below the South Pennines provided ideal conditions for textile production {{to be carried out}} without the thread drying and breaking, and newly developed 19th-century mechanisation optimised cotton spinning for industrial-scale manufacture of yarn <b>and</b> <b>fabric</b> for the global market. As the Industrial Revolution advanced, socioeconomic conditions in the region contributed to Chadderton adopting cotton spinning in the factory system, which became the dominant source of employment in the locality. The construction of multi-storey steam powered mills followed, which initiated a process of urbanisation and cultural transformation in the region; the population increasingly moved away from farming and domestic weaving in favour of the mechanised production of cotton goods.|$|E
