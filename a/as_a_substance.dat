5|$|On February 5, 2013, Colorado {{representative}} Jared Polis introduced Ending Federal Marijuana Prohibition Act of 2013 (H.R. 499; 113th Congress), a {{bill that}} would decriminalize marijuana on the federal level, instead treating it <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>substance</b> to be regulated in a similar manner to alcohol. The act has not been approved by Congress.|$|E

50|$|In {{pharmacology}} {{the term}} agonist-antagonist or mixed agonist/antagonist {{is used to}} refer to a drug which under some conditions behaves <b>as</b> <b>an</b> agonist (<b>a</b> <b>substance</b> that fully activates the receptor that it binds to) while under other conditions, behaves <b>as</b> <b>an</b> antagonist (<b>a</b> <b>substance</b> that binds to a receptor but does not activate and can block the activity of other agonists).|$|R
50|$|Whereas a {{material}} is considered bioactive {{if it has}} interaction with or effect on any cell tissue in the human body, pharmacological activity is usually taken to describe beneficial effects, i.e. the effects of drug candidates <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>substance's</b> toxicity.|$|R
25|$|A {{popular belief}} exists that the Inuit have {{an unusually large}} number of words for snow. This is not accurate, and results from a {{misunderstanding}} {{of the nature of}} polysynthetic languages. In fact, the Inuit have only a few base roots for snow: 'qanniq-' ('qanik-' in some dialects), which is used most often like the verb to snow, and 'aput', which means snow <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>substance.</b> Parts of speech work very differently in the Inuit language than in English, so these definitions are somewhat misleading.|$|E
25|$|After a cloud, for instance, {{has started}} {{its way to}} {{becoming}} a lightning generator, atmospheric water vapor acts <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>substance</b> (or insulator) that decreases the ability of the cloud to discharge its electrical energy. Over a certain amount of time, if the cloud continues to generate and store more static electricity, the barrier that was created by the atmospheric water vapor will ultimately break down from the stored electrical potential energy. This energy will be released to a locally, oppositely charged region in the form of lightning. The strength of each discharge {{is directly related to the}} atmospheric permittivity, capacitance, and the source's charge generating ability.|$|E
25|$|For Anaximander, the {{principle}} of things, the constituent of all substances, is nothing determined and not an element such as water in Thales' view. Neither is it something halfway between air and water, or between air and fire, thicker than air and fire, or more subtle than water and earth. Anaximander argues that water cannot embrace all of the opposites found in nature — for example, water can only be wet, never dry — and therefore cannot be the one primary substance; nor could {{any of the other}} candidates. He postulated the apeiron <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>substance</b> that, although not directly perceptible to us, could explain the opposites he saw around him.|$|E
50|$|Another famous problem {{arises from}} Descartes’ {{substance}} dualism. For Descartes, <b>a</b> <b>substance</b> {{is that which}} can be conceived independent of everything else and exist independent of anything else. Since Descartes conceived of the mind independent of everything else when doubting everything uncertain, and because {{if he wanted to}} God could produce a world in which only the mind existed, he came to define the mind <b>as</b> <b>a</b> different <b>substance</b> from that of body. For Descartes, the mind is defined <b>as</b> <b>an</b> unextended <b>substance</b> and the body <b>as</b> <b>an</b> extended <b>substance.</b> This raised the fundamental question of how it is possible that mind and body interact with one another.|$|R

25|$|Lavoisier {{employed}} the new nomenclature in his Traité élémentaire de chimie (Elementary Treatise on Chemistry), published in 1789. This work represents {{the synthesis of}} Lavoisier's contribution to chemistry and can be considered the first modern textbook on the subject. The core of the work was the oxygen theory, and the work became a most effective vehicle for the transmission of the new doctrines. It presented a unified view of new theories of chemistry, contained a clear statement {{of the law of}} conservation of mass, and denied the existence of phlogiston. This text clarified the concept of an element <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>substance</b> that could not be broken down by any known method of chemical analysis, and presented Lavoisier's theory of the formation of chemical compounds from elements. It remains a classic in the history of science. While many leading chemists of the time refused to accept Lavoisier's new ideas, demand for Traité élémentaire as a textbook in Edinburgh was sufficient to merit translation into English within about a year of its French publication. In any event, the Traité élémentaire was sufficiently sound to convince the next generation.|$|E

500|$|André-Louis Debierne, a French chemist, {{announced}} {{the discovery of}} a new element in 1899. He separated it from pitchblende residues left by Marie and Pierre Curie after they had extracted radium. In 1899, Debierne described the substance as similar to titanium and (in 1900) as similar to thorium. Friedrich Oskar Giesel independently discovered actinium in 1902 <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>substance</b> being similar to lanthanum and called it [...] "emanium" [...] in 1904. After a comparison of the substances half-lives determined by Debierne, Harriet Brooks in 1904, and Otto Hahn and Otto Sackur in 1905, Debierne's chosen name for the new element was retained because it had seniority, despite the contradicting chemical properties he claimed for the element at different times.|$|E

Metro (2007) were lauded, with the latter earning her a Stardust Award for Breakthrough Performance – Female. Ranaut won numerous awards, including the National Film Award for Best Supporting Actress and a Filmfare Award in the same category for her role <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>substance</b> abusing supermodel in the drama Fashion (2008). Also in 2008, she featured as a village girl in Dhaam Dhoom, her first Tamil film.|$|E
500|$|In 2010, as its use {{became more}} prevalent, many {{countries}} passed legislation prohibiting mephedrone. It became illegal in Croatia and Germany in January, followed by Romania and the Isle of Man in February. In March 2010, it {{was classified as}} an unregulated medicine in the Netherlands, making the sale and distribution of it illegal. The importation of mephedrone into the UK was banned on 29 March 2010. The next day, the ACMD in the UK published {{a report on the}} cathinones, including mephedrone, and recommended they be classified as Class B drugs. On 7 April 2010, the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (Amendment) Order 2010 was passed by parliament, making mephedrone and other substituted cathinones, Class B drugs from 16 April 2010. Prior to the ban taking effect, mephedrone was not covered by the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. It was, though, an offence under the Medicines Act to sell it for human consumption, so it was often sold as [...] "plant food" [...] or [...] "bath salts", although it has no use as these products; this, too, was possibly illegal under the Trade Descriptions Act 1968. In the US, similar descriptions have been used to describe mephedrone, as well as methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV). In May 2010, the Republic of Ireland made mephedrone illegal, followed by Belgium, Italy, Lithuania, France and Norway in June and Russia in July. In August 2010, Austria and Poland made it illegal and China announced it would be illegal as of 1 September 2010. Mephedrone had been reported to be used in Singapore in February 2010, but it was made illegal in November 2010. In December 2010, following the advice of the EMCDDA, mephedrone was made illegal throughout the EU, a move Switzerland also made shortly afterwards. Countries which have not already banned it, such as the Netherlands, Greece and Portugal, will need to change legislation to comply with the EU ruling. In Hungary, a government advisory body recommended mephedrone should be made illegal in August 2010, which was followed, making it illegal in January 2011; Spain followed in February 2011. Mexico, by decree, outlawed mephedrone <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>substance</b> [...] "with low or no therapeutical use which pose a serious threat to public health" [...] in 2014.|$|E
2500|$|On March 15, 2017 the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) {{announced}} recommendations proceeding from a {{risk assessment}} of glyphosate performed by ECHA's Committee for Risk Assessment (RAC).
