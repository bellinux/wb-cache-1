40|$|Pycnidial fungi {{belonging}} to the genus Ampelomyces {{are the most common}} natural antagonists of powdery mildews worldwide. During a study of the interactions between <b>apple</b> powdery <b>mildew</b> (Podosphaera leucotricha) and Ampelomyces mycoparasites, 52 new Ampelomyces isolates were obtained from P. leucotricha and, in addition, 13 new isolates from other species of the Erysiphaceae in four European countries. Their genetic diversity was screened using single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the ribosomal DNA (rDNA). For comparison, 24 isolates obtained from genetic resource collections or other sources were included in this study. Based on the ITS-SSCP patterns, the isolates were placed in eight groups. The isolates belonged to two types based on their growth in culture. The faster-growing and the slower-growing isolates were included in different SSCP groups. A phylogenetic analysis of the ITS sequences of representatives of these groups confirmed the results obtained with the SSCP method, and showed that the faster-growing isolates do not belong to Ampelomyces as suggested by earlier studies. All the isolates from P. leucotricha fell into a distinct SSCP group of genetically homogeneous isolates. This suggests that Ampelomyces mycoparasites which occur in <b>apple</b> powdery <b>mildew</b> are slightly different from the other Ampelomyces groups which contain mycoparasites from various powdery mildew species. This may be because the main growth period of Ampelomyces mycoparasites in <b>apple</b> powdery <b>mildew</b> is isolated in time from that of Ampelomyces isolates that occur in other species of the Erysiphaceae.

40|$|Understanding the {{mechanisms}} responsible for divergence and specialization of pathogens on different hosts is of fundamental importance, {{especially in the}} context of the emergence of new diseases via host shifts. Temporal isolation has been reported in a few plants and parasites, but is probably one of the least studied speciation processes. We studied whether temporal isolation could be responsible for the maintenance of genetic differentiation among sympatric populations of Ampelomyces, widespread intracellular mycoparasites of powdery mildew fungi, themselves plant pathogens. The timing of transmission of Ampelomyces depends on the life cycles of the powdery mildew species they parasitize. Internal transcribed spacer sequences and microsatellite markers showed that Ampelomyces populations found in <b>apple</b> powdery <b>mildew</b> (Podosphaera leucotricha) were genetically highly differentiated from other Ampelomyces populations sampled from several other powdery mildew species across Europe, infecting plant hosts other than apple. While P. leucotricha starts its life cycle early in spring, and the main <b>apple</b> powdery <b>mildew</b> epidemics occur before summer, the fungal hosts of the other Ampelomyces cause epidemics mainly in summer and autumn. When two powdery mildew species were experimentally exposed to Ampelomyces strains naturally occurring in P. leucotricha in spring, and to strains naturally present in other mycohost species in autumn, cross-infections always occurred. Thus, the host-related genetic differentiation in Ampelomyces cannot be explained by narrow physiological specialization, because Ampelomyces were able to infect powdery mildew species they were unlikely to have encountered in nature, but instead appears to result from temporal isolatio...|$|R

40|$|The {{question}} as to why parasites remain generalist or become specialist is a key unresolved question in evolutionary biology. Ampelomyces spp., intracellular mycoparasites of powdery mildew fungi, which are themselves plant pathogens, are a useful model for studies of this issue. Ampelomyces {{is used for the}} biological control of mildew. Differences in mycohost phenology promote temporal isolation between sympatric Ampelomyces mycoparasites. <b>Apple</b> powdery <b>mildew</b> (APM) causes spring epidemics, whereas other powdery mildew species on plants other than apple cause epidemics later in the season. This has resulted in genetic differentiation between APM and non-APM strains. It is unclear whether there is genetic differentiation between non-APM Ampelomyces lineages due to their specialization on different mycohosts. We used microsatellites to address this question and found no significant differentiation between non-APM Ampelomyces strains from different mycohosts or host plants, but strong differentiation between APM and non-APM strains. A geographical structure was revealed in both groups, with differences between European countries, demonstrating restricted dispersal at the continent scale and a high resolution for our markers. We found footprints of recombination in both groups, possibly more frequent in the APM cluster. Overall, Ampelomyces thus appears {{to be one of the}} rare genuine generalist pathogenic fungi able to parasitize multiple hosts in natural populations. It is therefore an excellent model for studying the evolution of pathogens towards a generalist rather than host-specific strategy, particularly in light of the tritrophic interaction between Ampelomyces mycoparasites, their powdery mildew fungal hosts and the mildew host plants...|$|R

This biocontrol agent, an epiphytic yeast isolate called Y 16, affected neither conidia germination of V. inaequalis nor their penetration of the leaf tissue but suppressed the disease caused by this pathogen. The quantity of eggs laid by the codling moth during its second flight period on yeast treated trees was significantly different to the quantity of eggs laid on the untreated trees. In the first season of the experiments, more eggs were laid on the treated trees, especially on those tree parts closest to the fruit. These results, however, were not confirmed the following season: fewer eggs were laid on the treated trees than on the untreated trees. These conflicting observations are attributed to year-to-year variation in environmental conditions, which may affect yeast survival and activity. A 2 -month-long assay was conducted in the orchard during the codling moth's second flight period from mid-July until mid-September.

IPM 2 used an advanced integration of known non-chemical practices, accepting most principles of organic farming guidelines (disease/pest forecasting, delayed fungicide applications with green-list fungicide use, pruning against both diseases coupled with orchard sanitation, biological control and mating disruption against insects). Scab and powdery mildew incidences were not significantly different between IPM 1 and CON while disease incidences were significantly higher in IPM 2 compared to either CON or IPM 1 (P = 0. 05). Overall yield was not significantly different among the three management approaches. However, the amounts of first class fruit were the highest in CON and IPM 1 which were significantly higher (P = 0. 05) than that of in IPM 2.

Samples were examined {{for the presence of}} overwintering structures of Ampelomyces, common mycoparasites of powdery mildews. Pycnidia and resting hyphae resembling those of Ampelomyces were found on six plant species, including apple. Their viability and subsequent mycoparasitic activity of the hyphae emerging from the overwintered fungal structures were studied in vitro to determine whether they can serve as sources of primary inocula of Ampelomyces in the spring. Overwintered pycnidia of Ampelomyces collected in the spring, and produced in both the ascomata and the conidiophores of powdery mildews during the previous season, initiated the life cycle of these mycoparasites when placed close to fresh powdery mildew colonies in vitro. Similarly, thick-walled resting hyphae, found in the dried powdery mildew mycelia which covered the overwintered aerial parts of the host plants, also germinated and gave rise to new intracellular pycnidia of Ampelomyces when powdery mildew colonies were inoculated with them in vitro. On apple trees, Ampelomyces mycoparasites overwintered as resting hyphae in the dried powdery mildew mycelia covering the shoots and in the parasitized ascomata of Podosphaera leucotricha on the bark and the scales of the buds. Approximately 31 % of the field samples collected from apple trees in spring between 1998 and 2003 contained overwintered structures of Ampelomyces. Artificial bursting of apple buds in the laboratory showed that both P. leucotricha and Ampelomyces start their life cycle during or soon after bud burst, but Ampelomyces can only slowly follow the spread of its mycohost on infected leaves. Most probably, the mycoparasites did not overwinter in the dormant hyphae of P. leucotricha in the buds, but only on the bark and the bud scales, as their hyphae were not found in the young hyphae of <b>apple</b> powdery <b>mildew</b> that appeared on the leaf tissues during bud burst.

40|$|Philosophiae Doctor - PhDApple scab, powdery <b>mildew</b> and woolly <b>apple</b> aphid are a {{major concern}} for apple breeders and producers. Control of these {{diseases}} is a significant economic and marketing priority for the South African apple industry. Application of chemicals and orchard management practices are the main methods for controlling these diseases. These diseases require an average of 15 chemical sprays per season, which leads to increased production costs for the farmer. The increased cost of chemical based control programs and demand from consumers for ‘organic apples’ grown with very little to no chemical sprays makes it important to breed for commercial apple cultivars with endogenous disease resistance genes (R-genes). The use of genetic tools (apple genetic linkage maps and the apple genome sequence) to track and introgress endogenous R-genes in breeding and to confer durable disease resistance in commercial apple cultivars {{will lead to a}} more cost effective means of disease control for apple producers. Historically, most breeding programmes rely on recurrent conventional breeding systems. This involves the crossing of apple selections showing resistance to a given disease with a susceptible elite variety. This is followed by phenotyping the progeny to identify trees exhibiting segregating field resistance. Several crosses and backcrossing are required to produce resistant varieties and to fix the resistance trait using this breeding strategy. This breeding technique is time consuming, especially in perennial tree species such as apples, which have a long juvenile period. Molecular markers have enabled the building of genetic maps, which has allowed for tracking of the inheritance of genes contributing towards the observed resistances. This has given breeders the opportunity to start the implementation of marker-assisted-breeding (MAB) and marker-assistedselection (MAS). MAB and MAS greatly reduce the time required to select for favourable genotypes, given that MAB facilitates efficient selection for inherited traits at the seedling stage. With the publication of the apple genome sequence, the identification of the genes involved in disease resistances has been made possible and this will allow researchers to venture into cisgenics for apples, which will further reduce the time required for the introgression of desirable genes into commercial cultivars. The main thrust of this research was to generate dense genetic linkage maps for three mapping populations segregating for apple scab, woolly apple aphid and powdery mildew resistance. The three mapping populations are ‘Mildew Resistant’ x ‘Golden Delicious’, ‘Russian Seedling’ x ‘Golden Delicious’ and Malus platycarpa x ‘Mildew Resistant’ and are Malus full-sib outbreed mapping populations. The generation of the genetic maps was for use in the subsequent identification candidate disease resistance QTLs/genes that can be implemented in apple cisgenics. Integrated genetic maps using SSRs, DArTs and SNP marker data were generated for all the three crosses. The integrated map of ‘Mildew Resistance’ x ‘Golden Delicious’ consists of 1, 563 markers with a total map length of 1, 298. 8 cM. The ‘Russian Seedling’ x ‘Golden Delicious’ genetic map is composed of 979 markers with a total map length of 1, 729. 9 cM. The Malus platycarpa x ‘Mildew Resistant’ integrated map has 616 markers and a total map length of 1, 324. 3 cM. Due to the fragmentation of some of the linkage groups in the ‘Russian Seedling’ x ‘Golden Delicious’ and in the Malus platycarpa x ‘Mildew Resistant’ genetic maps, a phylogenetic analysis was performed to evaluate the genetic distances between the parents of the crosses {{in order to understand the}} cause of the fragmentation of these two integrated genetic maps. QTLs were detected through the statistical correlation of the phenotypic and map data using restricted Multiple QTL Mapping (rMQM) from MapQTL® 6. 0. The genome-wide LOD score minimum QTL detection thresholds were determined using 10 000 permutations for each population. The minimum QTL detection threshold for accepting a putative QTL was then determined to be 4. 5 for ‘Mildew Resistant’ x ‘Golden Delicious’ and 4. 6 for both the ‘Malus platycarpa’ x ‘Mildew Resistant’ and ‘Russian Seedling’ x ‘Golden Delicious’ mapping populations. A total of 17 putative QTLs were detected for the ‘Mildew Resistant’ x ‘Golden Delicious’ population, 10 putative QTLs for the Malus platycarpa x ‘Mildew Resistant’ population and nine putative QTLs for the ‘Russian Seedling’ x ‘Golden Delicious’ population were detected for the three diseases under study. The two putative QTLs for apple scab resistance detected on LG 02 of the ‘Russian Seedling’ x ‘Golden Delicious’ map coincided with the loci previously identified as encoding two apple scab resistance genes Vh 2 and Vh 4 on ‘Russian apple’. The QTL for apple scab resistance identified on the proximal QTL of LG 02 co-localized with SNP marker R_ 8936738 _Lg 2 on the loci where Vh 4 was previously identified. The distal QTL on LG 02 shown to encode the Vh 2 R-gene was linked with the SNP marker R_ 32981524 _Lg 2. With ‘Russian apple’ being known to carry a natural pyramid of R-genes for apple scab on LG 02, therefore, the ‘Russian Seedling’ used in this study was screened by a set of 14 SSR markers to determine if it was related to ‘Russian apple. The 14 SSRs produced identical alleles to those amplified by ‘Russian apple’, which means “Russian Seedling’ and ‘Russian apple’ are closely related or identical. The LG 02 pseudo-chromosome sequence was extracted from the NCBI database housing the apple genome sequence and was then used to mine for the putative R-genes within the two QTL regions. The region corresponding to the Vh 2 loci, which was roughly a 600 kb region, had two clusters of ABC (PDR) disease resistance related genes. These were predicted using a full Pfam domain search and were only detected on the negative strand. The 60 kb region corresponding to the Vh 4 loci comprised a cluster of LRR domains that were also detected on the negative strand using a full Pfam domain search. This 60 kb region was further analysed using Phytozome and Genome Database for Rosaceae (GDR) leading to two candidate disease resistance genes being identified. Ten consensus gene sequences were present within the 60 kb region, with only two transcripts MDP 0000657246 and MDP 0000128458 identified as being disease resistance related genes. The MDP 0000657246 was identified on the contig MDC 000294 of the Malus x domestica reference genome as being a Leucine Rich Repeat protein kinase family, which is one of the most abundant disease resistance family mainly involved in the gene-for-gene resistance mechanism. The MDP 0000128458 locus was identified on contig MDC 015161 as being a Ser/Thr phosphatase 7. The Ser/Thr phosphatase genes have been associated with the regulation of MAP kinase cascades that have been shown to induce the hypersensitive response (HR) in tobacco. Therefore these two genes are likely to be the loci associated with the hypersensitive response associated with the infection of apples with race 4 of apple scab, carrying the Vh 4 apple scab resistance gene. Recurrent putative QTLs were detected that still need to be validated in order to be used for MAB. The ‘Russian Seedling’ x ‘Golden Delicious’ cross produced a single powdery mildew resistance QTL located on LG 08 and conferring a 1 : 1 resistance to susceptible phenotypic segregation ratio. These results indicate that the source of the resistance thus was a single dominant resistance gene. The ‘Mildew Resistant’ x ‘Golden Delicious’ mapping population also showed two stable QTLs one for powdery mildew on LG 03, which co-segregated with SNP GD_LG 03 snp 00866 and in addition SNP R_ 13071892 _Lg 10 was also identified to be co-segregating with the QTL for apple scab resistance on LG 10. However, none of these recurrent QTLs co-localized with known genes or QTLs. For the phylogenetic analysis, re-sequenced data using the Illumina® sequencing technologies and the apple SNP chip data for ‘Russian Seedling’, ‘Mildew Resistant’, Malus platycarpa, a Chinese accession of Malus sieversii and ‘Anna’ where used to infer relatedness of the five genotypes. The Chinese accession of Malus sieversii was included in the analysis since ‘Russian Seedling’ was thought to be relatively close genetically. Whilst ‘Anna’ is known to be a low chilling cultivar of Malus x domestica (Borkh) and therefore would add in the phylogenetic placement of ‘Mildew Resistant’ and Malus platycarpa. These were sequenced to coverage of approximately 60 X for ‘Russian Seedling’ and 6 X for the other four genotypes. The sequence data was aligned to the reference Malus x domestica cv Golden Delicious mitochondrial genome sequence. Phylogenetic analysis was then performed using both the data from the apple SNP-chip and the aligned mitochondrial genomes. The results from both sets of data supported the putative evolutionary distances between the five genotypes. ‘Russian Seedling’ and M. sieversii were closely related, while both were genetically divergent from the closely related ‘Anna’ and ‘Golden Delicious’ commercial cultivars. This analysis however indicated that ‘Mildew Resistant’ was relatively closely related to ‘Golden Delicious’ and hence the low number of markers showing segregation distortions for the ‘Mildew Resistant’ x ‘Golden Delicious’ population in the 17 LGs of the integrated map. However, the other two mapping population exhibited a high number of markers with segregation distortions. Markers which are closely associated with disease resistance to <b>apple</b> scab powdery <b>mildew</b> and woolly <b>apple</b> aphid resistance will play a major role in the identification of the genes responsible for the resistances being observed. The identification of the two candidate genes for the Vh 4 gene associated with apple scab resistance will be the platform from which a cisgenic programme can be implemented in the South African apple breeding program...|$|R
