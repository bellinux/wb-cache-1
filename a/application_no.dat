25|$|But {{the alleged}} {{right to a}} new trial is not a {{sufficient}} guarantee for the defendant, as clearly ruled the ECtHR {{in the case of}} Krombach v. France, <b>application</b> <b>no.</b> 29731/96, and also article 6 of ECHR, the juridical ground of Battisti's claim against extradition, doesn't prescribe a new trial. ECHR establishes that there is not an absolute right to a new trial, after a trial in absentia. Battisti's claim concerned the defendant's knowledge of the trial, and Battisti's lawyers argued that the defendant had not been in a position to know that in Italy there was a trial against him and so his rights had been violated.|$|E

2500|$|In a {{judgement}} {{issued on}} 12 July 2007, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in the Jorgić v. Germany case (<b>Application</b> <b>no.</b> 74613/01), reviewed the German court's judgements against Jorgić. In rejecting Jorgić's appeal, the ECHR affirmed that the German court's ruling {{was consistent with}} {{an interpretation of the}} Genocide Convention foreseeable at the time Jorgić committed the offence in 1992. However, the ECHR highlighted that the German court's ruling, based upon German domestic law, had interpreted the crime of genocide more broadly than and in a manner since rejected by international courts. Under the wider definition that the German judiciary upheld, the ethnic cleansing carried out by Jorgić was a genocide because it was an intent to destroy the group as a social unit, and although the majority of scholars took the view that German genocide law should interpret genocide as the physical-biological destruction of the protected group, [...] "a considerable number of scholars were of the opinion that the notion of destruction of a group as such, in its literal meaning, was wider than a physical-biological extermination and also encompassed the destruction of a group as a social unit".|$|E

2500|$|Williams was {{the first}} showmen to use a {{projector}} produced by Haydon and Urry and his use of their machine (The Eragraph) came about {{as a result of}} three contributing factors: - need, availability, and timing. In early 1897, Haydon and Urry {{were in the process of}} developing their own film projector. The company had recently moved their offices and showroom to 353 Upper Street, Islington [...] and were located just across the street from the Royal Agricultural Hall where Williams was exhibiting. Williams was already acquainted with one of the firm’s employees, James Monte (their chief film maker), having met him a year earlier at a showman’s annual supper committee meeting. [...] By early February 1897, Haydon and Urry’s projector was ready for market and according to accounts from that time, Williams was in need of a new one. He had opened at the World’s Fair with an exhibition of films, but the projector he was using ("the Electroscope") had been condemned as a fire risk by London County officials. [...] Getting a showman as well known as Randall Williams on board with their new projector was no doubt a major coup for Haydon and Urry. The firm applied for a patent (<b>application</b> <b>no.</b> 3572) for their cinematograph on 10 February 1897 - just as the World’s Fair was ending - and just five days prior to the opening of Williams' show at King’s Lynn at the start of the fairground season. [...] The projector used by Williams at King's Lynn would have been the firm’s earliest model and, it was likely the same model he used throughout the summer, leading Haydon and Urry to claim in their advertising that their machine had been used “with unqualified success at Victorian Era Exhibition all Last Season.” ...|$|E
