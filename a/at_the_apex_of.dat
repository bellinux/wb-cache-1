The zoom climb tactic, combined with the thrust from the rocket motor of the missile itself, allowed the missile to achieve its maximum range, or, alternatively, to reach space.|$|E
5|$|In the {{hierarchical}} social order, the emperor was <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>apex</b> <b>of</b> Han society and government. However the emperor {{was often a}} minor, ruled over by a regent such as the empress dowager or one of her male relatives. Ranked immediately below the emperor were the kings who were of the same Liu family clan. The rest of society, including nobles lower than kings and all commoners excluding slaves belonged to one of twenty ranks (ershi gongcheng 二十公乘).|$|E

5|$|Marsh {{and then}} Hatcher {{assumed that the}} animal was aquatic, because of the {{position}} of its nasal openings <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>apex</b> <b>of</b> the cranium. Similar aquatic behavior was commonly depicted for other large sauropods, such as Brachiosaurus and Apatosaurus. A 1951 study by Kenneth A. Kermack indicates that sauropods probably could not have breathed through their nostrils {{when the rest of the}} body was submerged, as the water pressure on the chest wall would be too great. Since the 1970s, general consensus has the sauropods as firmly terrestrial animals, browsing on trees, ferns, and bushes.|$|E
5|$|First {{designated}} by July 1, 1919 along a different routing, M-47 was extended {{several times in}} both directions through the 1920s and 1930s. Two of these extensions replaced sections of M-111 in the Bay City area. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>apex</b> <b>of</b> its length in the 1950s, M-47 stretched from Webberville {{in the south to}} Bay City State Park in the north. Since Interstate 75 (I-75) opened in the Tri-Cities area, the northern section of M-47 was rerouted and truncated as a result of related changes to other highways. The southern end was moved after I-96 opened in the Lansing area. Further changes into the 1970s shortened M-47 more, producing the routing in use today.|$|E
5|$|Following the hasty {{departure}} of PedroI, Brazil {{was left with}} a five-year-old boy as head of state. With no precedent to follow, the Empire was {{faced with the prospect}} of a period of more than twelve years without a strong executive, as, under the constitution, PedroII would not attain his majority and begin exercising authority as Emperor until 2 December 1843. A regency was elected to rule the country in the interim. Because the Regency held few of the powers exercised by an emperor and was completely subordinated to the General Assembly, it could not fill the vacuum <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>apex</b> <b>of</b> Brazil's government.|$|E

5|$|The body cavity {{contains}} the circulatory or haemal system. The vessels form three rings: one around the mouth (the hyponeural haemal ring), another around the digestive system (the gastric ring) {{and the third}} near the aboral surface (the genital ring). The heart beats about six times a minute and is <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>apex</b> <b>of</b> a vertical channel (the axial vessel) that connects the three rings. At the base of each arm are paired gonads; a lateral vessel extends from the genital ring past the gonads {{to the tip of}} the arm. This vessel has a blind end and there is no continuous circulation of the fluid within it. This liquid does not contain a pigment and has little or no respiratory function but is probably used to transport nutrients around the body.|$|E
5|$|The half-length {{portrait}} shows Maria Portinari (born Maria Maddalena Baroncelli in 1456) in a three-quarter view {{turned to}} the left. She has somewhat Nordic features, and is dressed in the high fashion then found <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>apex</b> <b>of</b> Flemish and Italian high society. She is placed against a flat, opaque, dark background, with her hands clasped in prayer. In Memling's early portraits the backgrounds tend to be plain, as was invariably {{the case in the}} work of Jan van Eyck and Roger van der Weyden, and favored within Burgundian court circles. In contrast, Memling's later portraits are set within rich interiors or against landscapes framed by columns, such as in his Portrait of Benedetto Portinari, a fact that has assisted in dating his work.|$|E
5|$|From {{around the}} 1860s to just before World War II {{passengers}} could ride to Kittanning Point station near the Curve. Two branch railroads {{connected to the}} main line at Horseshoe Curve in the early 20th century; the Kittanning Run Railroad and the railroad owned by the Glen White Coal and Lumber Company followed their respective creeks to nearby coal mines. The Pennsylvania Railroad delivered empty hopper cars to the Kittanning Point station which the two railroads returned loaded with coal. Across from the station, a spur track on the hillside supplied a coal trestle, where trains could take on fuel and water during the early 1900s. A reservoir was built <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>apex</b> <b>of</b> the Horseshoe Curve in 1887 {{for the city of}} Altoona; a second reservoir, below the first, was finished in 1896. The third reservoir, Lake Altoona, was completed by 1913. A macadam road to the curve was opened in 1932 allowing access for visitors, and a gift shop was built in 1940.|$|E

5|$|Norman Osborn {{is shown}} to be {{severely}} manic depressive. This has been referenced several times in a myriad of Spider-Man stories. When he is not {{under the direction of}} a psychiatrist and taking medication, he has dangerous mood swings. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>apex</b> <b>of</b> his mania, he is paranoid, delusional, and suffers from visual and auditory hallucinations, including hearing the voice of his Green Goblin persona and seeing its face in the mirror rather than his own. Previously, Osborn's arrogance caused him to refuse to submit to psychiatric treatment unless forced to; he viewed mental illness as an imperfection and therefore would not admit that he is mentally ill. In later conversations with the Sentry, Osborn revealed that he had come to accept his own mental illness. After having rid of his powers after the confrontation with the Superior Spider-Man (Doctor Octopus), Osborn's sanity apparently restored but remains a villain.|$|E
5|$|Omphalotus nidiformis {{occurs in}} two disjunct ranges in {{southern}} Australia. In southwest Western Australia, {{it has been}} recorded from Perth and the Avon wheatbelt southwest to Augusta and east along the southern coastline to Esperance. In the southeast of the continent, it is found from eastern South Australia, {{where it has been}} recorded from Mount Gambier and the Fleurieu Peninsula, the Mount Lofty Ranges around Adelaide, the Murraylands, and north to the Flinders Ranges and from Lincoln National Park <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>apex</b> <b>of</b> the Eyre Peninsula, through to southeast Queensland. It also occurs in Tasmania. It can be found in eucalypt and pine forests, in habitats as diverse as the arid scrubland of Wyperfeld National Park and subalpine areas of Mount Buffalo National Park, as well as in urban parks and gardens. Fruit bodies can be numerous and occur in overlapping clusters on dead wood. Outside Australia, it has been recorded from Norfolk Island. In 2012, it was reported for the first time from Kerala, India, where it was discovered growing on a coconut tree stump.|$|E
5|$|Ordinary {{soldiers}} were merely recruited or conscripted rural farmers, while surrendered bandits and mercenaries also joined the military. Soldiers were not awarded official status by Confucian scholars {{as belonging to}} one of the Four Occupations; the scholar-officials were wary of condoning or legitimizing those whose lives revolved around the uncivilized practices of wu (violence). Even though the military examinations, rankings, and posts were parallel to those of the civil order, scholar-officials and the gentry nonetheless viewed military pursuits as uncultivated. Despite this disdain and argument of moral high ground, scholar-officials often commanded troops and wielded military power. Yet scholar-officials were not <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>apex</b> <b>of</b> the military or even civilian order; at the pinnacle of society was the emperor. The emperor's use of violence was seen as a necessity to rein in rebellious elements of society and dominate violent and uncultivated Inner Asian tribes, who would then submit to the emperor and become transformed by China's superior wen (culture and civilization).|$|E

5|$|The Canadian monarch, {{seen as the}} fount of honour, is <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>apex</b> <b>of</b> the Order of Canada as its Sovereign, {{followed}} by the governor general, who serves as the fellowship's Chancellor. Thereafter follow three grades, which are, in order of precedence: Companion, Officer, and Member, each having accordant post-nominal letters that members are entitled to use. Each incumbent governor general is also installed as the Principal Companion {{for the duration of}} his or her time in the viceregal post and continues as an extraordinary Companion thereafter. Additionally, any governor general, viceregal consort, former governor general, former viceregal consort, or member of the Canadian Royal Family may be appointed as an extraordinary Companion, Officer, or Member. Promotions in grade are possible, though this is ordinarily not done within five years of the initial appointment, and a maximum of five honorary appointments into any of the three grades may be made by the governor general each year. , there have been 21 honorary appointments.|$|E
5|$|The second-brightest star, the yellow-white {{subgiant star}} Alpha Trianguli (3.41m) with a close dimmer companion, {{is also known}} as Caput Trianguli or Ras al Muthallath, and is <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>apex</b> <b>of</b> the {{triangle}}. It lies around 7 degrees north-northwest of Alpha Arietis. Making up the triangle is Gamma Trianguli, a white main sequence star of spectral type A1Vnn of apparent magnitude 4.00 about 112 light-years from Earth. It is around double the size of and around 33 times as luminous as the sun and rotates rapidly. Like Beta, it is surrounded by a dusty debris disk, which has a radius 80 times the distance of the Earth from the Sun. Lying near Gamma and forming an optical triple system with it are Delta and 7 Trianguli. Delta is a spectroscopic binary system composed of two yellow main sequence stars of similar dimensions to the Sun that lies 35 light-years from Earth. The two stars orbit each other every ten days and are a mere 0.1 AU apart. This system is the closest in the constellation to the Earth. Only of magnitude 5.25, 7 Trianguli is much further away at around 280 light-years distant from Earth.|$|E
5|$|This divine {{assemblage}} had a {{vague and}} changeable hierarchy. Gods with broad {{influence in the}} cosmos or who were mythologically older than others had higher positions in divine society. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>apex</b> <b>of</b> this society was {{the king of the}} gods, who was usually identified with the creator deity. In different periods of Egyptian history, different gods were most frequently said to hold this exalted position. Horus was the most important god in the Early Dynastic Period, Ra rose to preeminence in the Old Kingdom, Amun was supreme in the New, and in the Ptolemaic and Roman periods, Isis was the divine queen and creator goddess. Newly prominent gods tended to adopt characteristics from their predecessors. Isis absorbed the traits of many other goddesses during her rise, and when Amun became the ruler of the pantheon, he was conjoined with Ra, the traditional king of the gods, to become a solar deity.|$|E
50|$|Boron suboxide (chemical formula B6O) {{is a solid}} {{compound}} with {{a structure}} built <b>of</b> eight icosahedra <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>apexes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rhombohedral unit cell.

5|$|Maricello's super soft tyres {{began to}} degrade quickly, {{allowing}} Rossi and Vandoorne to draw closer {{over the next}} two laps. Rossi caught Maricello by the start of the sixth lap but the latter remained on the circuit. King, who was delayed by a long queue of vehicles behind him, was the first driver to make a scheduled pit stop on the same lap and rejoined the track in clear air. On lap eight, Matsushita collided heavily with de Jong at the Novelle chicane, causing him to retire and was later penalised with a three-place grid penalty for the sprint race after the stewards judged him to have missed the corner's braking point. De Jong was able to continue. Marciello made his pit stop for new tyres on the next lap, allowing Rossi and Vandoorne to move into the first and second places and both drivers built an advantage over the remainder of the field. Maricello rejoined in eleventh, behind Pic, who made his pit stop one lap later. Sørensen was placed into the Casino Hairpin barriers <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>apex</b> <b>of</b> the corner by Nato on lap ten, ending his race. Nato was issued with a ten-second time penalty, but no safety car was deployed. Marvelov retired from the race in the pit lane with damage to his car after running off the circuit, and drove over a kerb exiting the left-hand Louis Chiron corner, causing him to become airborne, and hit the barriers lining the track.|$|E
