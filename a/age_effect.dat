40|$|The {{semiconductor}} (CMOS) technology following Moore???s law {{has reached}} dimensions in the nano-scale regime. The transistors in nano-scale regime behave differently compare to classical transistors. One {{of the emerging}} non-classical behaviors observed in nano-scale transistors is a class of <b>aging</b> <b>effects</b> which results in transistor performance degradation over time. The dominant <b>aging</b> <b>effects</b> are the Bias Temperature Instability (BTI). In this paper we analyze the impact of transistor <b>aging</b> <b>effects</b> on circuit performance in nano-scale CMOS technologies. This requires adopting proper modeling of <b>aging</b> <b>effects</b> and appropriate consideration of other issues in nano-scale transistors such as variations process (e. g. threshold voltage). The simulation results exhibit threshold voltage variation due to NBTI effect on different types of logic gates.

In this paper, {{the state of}} the art of research concerning these problems is presented. In order to facilitate understanding this subject, the scheduling problems where these effects occur separately, are firstly explained. Then, the papers devoted to scheduling problems combining the effects of learning and ageing are discussed. Particular attention was paid on practical applications of the considered scheduling problems. After thorough analysis it turned out that both scheduling problems with learning <b>effect,</b> and with <b>ageing</b> <b>effect,</b> as well as, in particular, the problems with models merging learning and <b>ageing</b> <b>effects</b> do not have any reasonable real-life applications. This is because the learning and <b>ageing</b> <b>effects</b> are in general long time horizon phenomena observed in repetitive systems and scheduling theory concerns either with repetitive short-horizon planning problems or single long-horizon projects. Therefore, there is no sense to continue research considering these scheduling problems from practical (computer engineering, automatic control, technical and economical) point of view, unless such reasonable real-life example appears.

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of the study was to {{identify}} event-based prospective-memory tasks that provide sensitive and reliable tools for assessing <b>effects</b> of normal <b>aging</b> in prospective-memory performance. Four prospective-memory tasks were selected from the literature or were newly developed, with the tasks differing on various dimensions that, for theoretical reasons or based on previous evidence. might determine task sensitivity to <b>age</b> <b>effects</b> on prospective-memory performance: perceptual saliency of prospective target events, frequency of occurrence of prospective target events. complexity of prospective-memory instructions. and provision of feedback after prospective-memory errors.

40|$|Background. Infection {{with human}} {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV) is associated with clinical symptoms of accelerated aging, {{as evidenced by the}} increased incidence and diversity of age-related illnesses at relatively young ages and supporting findings of organ and cellular pathologic analyses. But it has been difficult to detect an accel-erated <b>aging</b> <b>effect</b> at a molecular level. Methods. Here, we used an epigenetic biomarker of aging based on host DNA methylation levels to study ac-celerated <b>aging</b> <b>effects</b> due to HIV infection. DNA from brain and blood tissue was assayed via the Illumina Infinium Methylation 450 K platform. Results. Using 6 novel DNAmethylation data sets, we show that HIV infection leads to an increase in epigenetic age both in brain tissue (7. 4 years) and blood (5. 2 years). While the observed accelerated <b>aging</b> <b>effects</b> in blood may reflect changes in blood cell composition (notably exhausted cytotoxic T cells), it is less clear what explains the observed accelerated <b>aging</b> <b>effects</b> in brain tissue. Conclusions. Overall, our results demonstrate that the epigenetic clock is a useful biomarker for detecting accelerated <b>aging</b> <b>effects</b> due to HIV infection. This tool can be used to accurately determine the extent of age acceleration in individual tissues and cells. Keywords. HIV- 1; DNA methylation; epigenetics; aging; biomarker...|$|R

40|$|Sherpa Romeo yellow journal (pre-print only; {{accepted}} for publication) Classic theories {{on the evolution}} of senescence make the simplifying assumption that all offspring are of equal quality, so that demographic senescence only manifests through declining rates of survival or fecundity. However, there is now evidence that, in addition to declining rates of survival and fecundity, many organisms are subject to age-related declines in the quality of offspring produced (i. e. parental <b>age</b> <b>effects).</b> Recent modelling approaches allow for the incorporation of parental <b>age</b> <b>effects</b> into classic demographic analyses, assuming that such effects are limited to a single generation. Does this ‘single generation’ assumption hold? To find out, we conducted a laboratory study with the aquatic plant Lemna minor, a species for which parental <b>age</b> <b>effects</b> have been demonstrated previously. We compared the size and fitness of 423 lab-cultured plants (asexually-derived ramets) representing various birth orders, and ancestral ‘birth-order genealogies’. We found that offspring size and fitness both declined with increasing ‘immediate’ birth order (i. e. birth order with respect to the immediate parent), but only offspring size was affected by ancestral birth order. Thus, the assumption that parental <b>age</b> <b>effects</b> on offspring fitness are limited to a single generation does in fact hold for L. minor. This result will guide theorists aiming to refine and generalise modelling approaches that incorporate parental <b>age</b> <b>effects</b> into evolutionary theory on senescence...|$|R
