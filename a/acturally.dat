The sea exploratorium is located in Key Largo, Florida, but could be {{situated}} in any coastal region <b>acturally.</b> This particular site is so unique because of its coral reef formations and their beauty. The entire site is an exploratorium with the habitat, activities, and the connections linking the various components. There are four locations incorporated into the entire scheme, but only one is focused on in the final design, that of the islands, and habitat. The program calls for a one week visit to the island habitats and to exist within the environment {{while at the same time}} making as small a degree of impact in the ecosystem as possible. I N T E R A C T I O N is the key issue of my thesis- to interact in as many different ways as possible both physically and visually. By experiencing gravity, movement, sight, and proportion; in, on, and under the water, the exploratorium provides an awe-inspiring acknowledgment of the actions and reactions of this ecosystem.
