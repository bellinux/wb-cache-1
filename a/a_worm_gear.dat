40|$|Shapes {{different}} from the traditional ones have been proposed for face <b>worm</b> <b>gears</b> and for conical and cylindrical worms that mesh with them. The proposed shapes {{are based on the}} concept of generating <b>a</b> face <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> surface by use of a tilted head cutter instead of by the traditional use of a hob. (As used here, head cutter is also meant to signify, alternatively, a head grinding tool.) The gear-surface-generation equipment would be similar to that used for generation of spiral bevel and hypoid gears. In comparison with the corresponding traditional hob, a tilted head cutter according to the proposal would be larger, could be fabricated with greater precision, and would enable the generation of gear surfaces with greater precision and greater productivity. <b>A</b> face <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> would be generated (see figure) by use of a tilted head cutter, the blades or grinding surfaces of which would have straight-line profiles. The tilt of the head cutter would prevent interference with teeth adjacent to the groove being cut or ground. <b>A</b> <b>worm</b> to mesh with the face <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> would be generated by use of a tilted head cutter mounted on the cradle of a generating machine. The blades or grinding surfaces of the head cutter would have a parabolic profile and would deviate from the straight-line profiles of the head cutter for the face <b>worm</b> <b>gear.</b> The shortest distance between the worm and the cradle would follow a parabolic function during the cycle of meshing in the generating process to provide a parabolic function of transmission errors to the gear drive. The small mismatch between the profiles of the face-worm-gear and worm head cutters would make it possible to localize the bearing contact in the <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> drive. The parabolic function of transmission errors could absorb discontinuous linear functions of transmission errors caused by errors of alignment; this could afford a significant benefit, in that such errors are main sources of noise and vibration in gear drives. The main advantage of using tilted head cutters is that cutting speeds are independent of the shape-generation processes, making it possible to choose cutting speeds that are optimum with respect to requirements to minimize temperatures and deformations during fabrication and improve the quality of finished parts...|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is to {{establish}} a characterisation method for seven polyamide (PA) grades to determine the major material to manufacture <b>an</b> automotive <b>worm</b> <b>gear.</b> The composite properties were measured according to the <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> loadings: tensile strength, Young’s modulus, abrasion and impact resistance. They were also correlated to the PA moisture absorption and its glass fibre (GF) reinforcement. The data from mechanical tests were applied in the finite element analysis (FEA) using the von Mises stress criterion. Before the rig tests of the PA <b>worm</b> <b>gears,</b> the injection process was evaluated, through the capillary rheometry. A higher difficulty to process PA 6 / 6 30 % GF was found, due to its lower apparent viscosity. In the end, the influence of moisture absorption was as decisive to the gear’s material selection as the GF to the pinion. Thus, the PAs with the best performance were: PA 6 with 30 % GF (gear) and with PA 60 % GF (pinion) ...|$|R
5000|$|A gearbox {{designed}} using <b>a</b> <b>worm</b> and worm-wheel {{is considerably}} smaller than one made from plain spur gears, and has its drive axes at 90° to each other.With <b>a</b> single start <b>worm,</b> for each 360° {{turn of the}} worm, the worm-gear advances only one tooth of the gear.

From experimental investigations on gears of real geometry using a cone gear as well as a hypoid gear, a calibration algorithm has been derived.
