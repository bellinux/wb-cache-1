5000|$|Teuchter ( [...] or [...] ) is a Lowland Scots word {{originally}} used {{to describe}} a Scottish Highlander, in particular a Gaelic-speaking Highlander.

The term is contemptuous, essentially describing someone seen to be uncouth and rural.|$|R
25|$|The audience, {{which had}} {{gathered}} to hear Karnad speak, had mixed {{reactions to the}} speech.

However, much of public opinion was on his side. German Kaiser Wilhelm II pardoned him on 16 August 1908.

5000|$|The {{cinematic}} {{accomplishments of}} the movie are decidedly meager, such as the completely unexplained casting of David Warner as both the hero's mentor and the chief villain, {{in addition to providing}} the narration. The dialogue is decidedly campy (at one point Lord Vultare threatens Baydool with [...] "I grow weary of your antics, beggar-man!", which is made all <b>the</b> more <b>amusing</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fact that David Warner is in fact talking to himself in the scene) and the movie has a low-budget atmosphere.|$|R

25|$|According to the Church Tradition, Christianity {{was first}} {{brought to the}} {{territory}} of modern Belarus, Russia and Ukraine by Saint Andrew, the first Apostle of Jesus Christ. He traveled over the Black Sea to the Greek colony of Chersonesus Taurica in Crimea, where he converted several thousand men to new faith. Allegedly Saint Andrew traveled also north along the Dnieper River, where Kiev would be founded around the 5th century, and {{as far north as}} the future location of Veliky Novgorod. The legendary account of the Rus'ian Primary Chronicle tells that Saint Andrew was <b>amused</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Slavic customs of washing in hot steam bath, banya, on his way.|$|E
25|$|Ion Luca Caragiale {{is known}} to have been <b>amused</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> stock {{character}} Robert Macaire, {{at a time when the}} latter had been turned into a comedic character by Frédérick Lemaître. While in Berlin, he purchased the cartoons of French artists Honoré Daumier and Paul Gavarni (although it is not known if their separate portrayals of Macaire were familiar to him)—among these drawings was one showing notabilities embracing one another while picking each other's pockets, which shows similarities with Caragiale's own take on society. According to Cazimir, it is possible that he knew Daumier's work from early on, as several other subjects caricatured by the French artist bear a remarkable resemblance to his texts.|$|E
25|$|The Brontë {{sisters were}} highly <b>amused</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{behaviour}} of the curates they met. Arthur Bell Nicholls (1818–1906) had been curate of Haworth for {{seven and a}} half years, when contrary to all expectations, and to the fury of Patrick Brontë (their father), he proposed to Charlotte. Although impressed by his dignity and deep voice, as well as by his near complete emotional collapse when she rejected him, she found him rigid, conventional, and rather narrow-minded 'like all the curates' – as she wrote to Ellen Nussey. After she declined his proposal Nicholls, pursued by the anger of Patrick Brontë, left his functions for several months. However, little by little her feelings evolved and after slowly convincing her father, she finally married Nicholls on 29 June 1854.|$|E
5000|$|By 1840 Mudie {{was living}} at 243½ The Strand, London, where he gave private lessons in English grammar {{and wrote a}} school {{text-book}} with visual aids: The Grammar of the English Language truly made Easy and <b>Amusing</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Invention of Three Hundred Moveable Parts of Speech (J. Cleave, London, 1840). He had also written a children's alphabet reader: The Illuminated Temple of Letters, and {{announced that he was}} planning to produce books on shorthand writing, the philosophy of grammar and [...] "A Musical and Mechanical key to the Infant Soul", but of these works only the grammar text-book survives.|$|R

25|$|In 751, An again visited Chang'an. On An's {{birthday}} on 20 February, 751, Emperor Xuanzong and Consort Yang rewarded {{him with}} clothing, treasures, and food. On 23 February, when An {{was summoned to}} the palace, Consort Yang, in order to please Emperor Xuanzong, had an extra-large infant wrapping made, and wrapped the obese An in it, causing much laughter among the ladies in waiting and eunuchs. When Emperor Xuanzong asked what was going on, Consort Yang's attendants joked that Consort Yang gave birth three days before and was washing her baby Lushan. Emperor Xuanzong was <b>amused</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> comic situation and rewarded both Consort Yang and An greatly. Thereafter, whenever An visited the capital, he was allowed free admittance to the palace, and there were rumors that he and Consort Yang had an affair, but Emperor Xuanzong discounted the rumors.|$|E
25|$|In {{one of his}} articles, Ion Luca Caragiale commented with irony on the Marxist {{views of}} his friend Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea: he {{compared}} the latter's way of dining on a leg of veal, laboriously carving it into sections, to his philosophical approach. Caragiale thus noted that philosophical skepticism was equivalent to stripping the bone of its flesh piece by piece, and then throwing it to the dogs—without having been able to fully document the leg of veal or its substance. Nevertheless, as Tudor Vianu indicated, although Caragiale preferred observation and spontaneity to speculation, he was not averse to pure philosophical analysis, and frequently quoted the classics in defense of his aesthetic guidelines. Late in his life, Caragiale also sparked debates after deriding the emerging Poporanism, a school of thought which took its inspiration from socialism, agrarianism and traditionalism. He is also {{known to have been}} <b>amused</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> German election of 1907 and the resulting defeat registered by the Social Democratic Party.|$|E
25|$|His {{interest}} in first-hand {{investigation of the}} human nature was accompanied, at least after he reached maturity, by a distaste for generous and universalist theories. Caragiale viewed their impact on Romanian society with a critical eye. Like Junimea, he was <b>amused</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> cultural legacy of 1848 Wallachian revolutionaries, and by its image in National Liberal discourse. Nevertheless, he claimed {{that there was a}} clear difference between the first generation of liberal activists—Ion Câmpineanu, Ion Heliade Rădulescu, and Nicolae Bălcescu—and the new liberal establishment, which, as he believed, had come to cultivate hypocrisy, demagogy, and political corruption. He exemplified the latter group by citing some of its prominent members: Pantazi Ghica, Nicolae Misail and Mihail Pătârlăgeanu. At one point, he argued that, had they not died young, the leaders of 1848 could have found themselves best represented by the Conservatives. He recorded the way in which National Liberal politicians claimed to take inspiration from the revolt, and pointed out that the 1848 slogans had become rallying calls for the most banal causes.|$|E

500|$|Gilbert Gottfried was a {{featured}} comedian at the Comedy Central Roast of Bob Saget {{which first}} aired on August 16, 2008. At Saget's roast, Gottfried jokingly begged listeners {{to disregard the}} (nonexistent) rumor that his fellow comedian [...] "raped and killed a girl in 1990". Gottfried repeatedly warned the audience at the roast not to spread the rumor, which did not exist before the comedian's speech. The audience in attendance at the Comedy Central Roast were both shocked and <b>amused</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> preposterous nature of Gottfried's joke which seemed more ludicrous each time he repeated it.|$|E

500|$|Reviewers have praised Chulip for {{a charming}} presentation, quirky characters, and absurd, Japanese humor. Admitting {{that the game}} had some blurry or {{pixelated}} textures and cramped environments, both Seff and Davis noted the peculiar art style of Chulip to be aesthetically pleasing. Seff specifically found the game [...] "surprisingly easy on the eyes" [...] and to feature unique character designs, [...] "wacky" [...] dialogue, and an art style comparable to other titles like the Mother series and Katamari Damacy. Davis was <b>amused</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> script and the townsfolk's gibberish speech, and was satisfied with largely a cappella soundtrack.
