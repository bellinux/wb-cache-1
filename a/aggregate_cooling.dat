40|$|The {{concept of}} radiation-pressure cooling of atoms was {{independently}} suggested in 1975 {{for the case}} of a gas of neutral atoms by Hänsch and Schawlow, and for atomic ions bound in an electromagnetic trap by Wineland and Dehmelt. While the notion that momentum exchange from a photon moving in the opposite direction could slow an individual atom was well understood, until this time no one had come up with a means for producing an <b>aggregate</b> <b>cooling</b> of a larger ensemble of atoms (a gas). If all atoms in a hot gas absorb photons, then some will be heated and some cooled, and the ensuing equilibrium temperature is not lowered. The general feature of the cooling concepts is that a gas of atoms or ions can be cooled by ensuring that photon absorption takes place preferentially when the atoms o...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Before the {{construction}} of hydraulic structure, <b>aggregate</b> must be <b>cooled</b> or heated by air (we call it <b>aggregate</b> air <b>cooling</b> or heating in this paper) or other technologies to the required temperature. Previous model of <b>aggregate</b> air <b>cooling</b> or heating cannot provide the center temperature of each aggregate. So a more accurate mathematical model is developed to determine the thermal performance of aggregate, and the surface heat transfer coefficient of wet aggregate is revised. This model can predict the center temperature of an aggregate and can accurately calculate the cold down time or temperature distribution of aggregate, so that the refrigeration or heating capacity can be reasonably supplied. It’s significant for foundation engineering of hydraulic structure...|$|R

The paper gathers and reviews {{a considerable amount of}} test data, considering the influence of different test parameters such as initial compressive strength, <b>aggregate</b> type, <b>cooling</b> regime and specimen shape. It is found that the compressive strength of concrete at high temperature is in accordance with the model proposed in the Eurocodes for calcareous concrete. However, during cooling phase, an additional reduction of compressive strength in concrete is observed, which can be as high as 20 % of the initial strength for elevated temperatures around 500 °C. Finally, a generic concrete model for temperature dependent compressive strength, accounting for both growth and cooling phase of temperature is proposed. The model can be used for simulating fire response of concrete structures subjected to natural fires or for the evaluation of residual load capacity of concrete structures after fire.

40|$|We {{present a}} study of the {{structural}} evolution of protein aggregates formed in solutions of a globular protein, β-lactoglobulin (BLG), in the presence of YCl 3. These aggregates are often observed before crystallization starts and they are metastable with respect to the crystalline phase. Here we focus on the characterization of the hierarchical structure of this intermediate phase and its temperature dependent structure evolution using a combination of (very) small angle neutron and X-ray scattering (VSANS, SANS, and SAXS). Results show that the hierarchical structure ranges from nanometer scale protein monomer, dimer and compact protein clusters to micrometer scale fractal protein <b>aggregates.</b> Upon <b>cooling,</b> the overall hierarchical structure is preserved, but the evolution of the internal structure within the aggregates is clearly visible: the monomer–monomer correlation peak reduces its intensity and disappears completely at lower temperatures, whereas the cluster–cluster correlation is enhanced. At a larger length scale, the fractal dimension of protein aggregates increases. The kinetics of the structure change during a temperature ramp was further investigated using time-resolved SAXS. The time dependent SAXS profiles show clear isosbestic points and the kinetics of the structural evolution can be well described using a two-state model.

40|$|Purpose. This study {{examines}} the microstructure, gelation tempera-tures, and flow properties of novel amphiphilogels consisting solely of non-ionic surfactants. Methods. Gels were prepared by mixing the solid gelator (sorbitan monostearate or sorbitan monopalmitate) and the liquid phase (liq-uid sorbitan esters or polysorbates) and heating them at 60 °C {{to form a}} clear isotropic sol phase, and cooling the sol phase to form an opaque semisolid at room temperature. Gel microstructure was ex-amined by light and electron microscopy and by small angle neutron scattering (SANS); gelation temperatures were measured by hot-stage microscopy, a melting point apparatus, and high sensitivity dif-ferential scanning calorimetry (HSDSC). Flow rheograms were per-formed to establish the zero-rate viscosity of the gels and their per-formance under shear. Results. Gel microstructures consisted mainly of clusters of tubules of gelator molecules that had <b>aggregated</b> upon <b>cooling</b> of the sol phase, forming a 3 D network throughout the continuous phase. The gels demonstrated thermoreversibility. Gelation temperature and viscos-ity increased with increasing gelator concentration, indicating a more robust gel network.

These proteins, particularly chitinases and thaumatin-like proteins (TL-proteins), need to be removed, and this is done through adsorption by bentonite, an effective but inefficient wine-processing step. Alternative processes are sought, but, {{for them to be}} successful, an in-depth understanding of the causes of protein hazing is required. This study investigated the role played by ionic strength (I) and sulfate toward the aggregation of TL-proteins and chitinases upon heating. Purified proteins were dissolved in model wine and analyzed by dynamic light scattering (DLS). The effect of Ion protein aggregation was investigated within the range from 2 to 500 mM/L. For chitinases, aggregation occurred during heating with I values of 100 and 500 mM/L, depending on the isoform. This aggregation immediately {{led to the formation of}} large particles (3 mu m, visible haze after cooling). TL-protein aggregation was observed only with I of 500 mM/L; it mainly developed during cooling and led to the formation of finite aggregates (400 nm) that remained invisible. With sulfate in the medium chitinases formed visible haze immediately when heat was applied, whereas TL-proteins <b>aggregated</b> during <b>cooling</b> but not into particles large enough to be visible to the naked eye.

In particular, the photophysical properties of these dyes are of interest since then- ability to generate the cytotoxic species, singlet oxygen ((^ 1) O(_ 2)), is believed to be central to their role in causing tumour necrosis. In this study, a detailed investigation of the photophysical properties of substituted zinc phthalocyanines under various conditions is described. Two novel β-tetra substituted zinc phthalocyanines have been synthesised, ZnPc(CMe(C 0 (_ 2) Me) (_ 2)) (_ 4) and ZnPc(CHMeCO(_ 2) H) (_ 4). The nature of peripheral substituents has little effect on triplet state or singlet oxygen production by ZnPc, however, ZnPc(CHMeCO(_ 2) H) (_ 4) displays a remarkable sensitivity to the ionic strength of non aqueous solutions. Ion concentrations below 10 (^- 4) mol dm(^- 3) induce dimerisation whilst concentrations greater than this promote monomerisation. This behaviour is attributed to ion pairing effects. Photophysical properties of substituted zinc phthalocyanines in heterogenous media and on solid substrates are also described. The temperature and pH of solvent media greatly influence the photophysical properties of phtiialocyanines. Octadecyl zinc phthalocyanine (C 10) <b>aggregates</b> upon <b>cooling</b> to 77 K in ether-pentane-alcohol (5 : 5 : 2) solution. Additional structure in the absorption spectrum is observed, accompanied by the appearance of a fluorescence emission band at 760 nm. Aluminium phthalocyanine chloride in methanol dimerises upon addition of 2. 5 x 10 (^- 5) mol dm(^- 3) fluoride ions. Dimer species are characterised by a blue shifted peak in the absorption spectrum and are non-fluorescent. These results are ascribed to different aggregate geometries and discussed in terms of exciton theory. Low pH induces stepwise protonation of the azomethine bridges of the phthalocyanme ring, Pc + nH(^+) PcH(_n) (^n+) +, where n = 0 to 4. Protonation results in significant changes in absorption, fluorescence and triplet state properties of the phthalocyanine. A dramatic decrease in singlet oxygen generation by the phthalocyanine (ɸ∆ (n = 0) = 0. 54, ɸ∆ (n = 1) = 0. 075) is reported, and occurs under surprisingly mild conditions (pK(_a) of ZnPcS(_ 2) in 1 % Triton X- 100 /H(_ 2) O = 4. 4).

30|$|Removing {{material}} from a solid surface using pulsed laser technology can induce nanoparticle formation. When the laser is shined on a surface, it induces vaporization and removes atoms from the bulk surface, thus enabling the laser pulse to go {{deeper into the}} material. Laser depth depends on factors such as its wavelength and the material’s physical properties. The laser’s electromagnetic fields eject electrons by discharging energy and momentum {{on the surface of}} the material. The energy transfer involved in the laser’s interaction with the material causes its temperature to rise, which in turn causes the formation of an ionized gas known as plasma that will expand like a shockwave around the laser’s focus. Particles are removed from the surface when the laser’s intensity (fluence) is greater than the material’s ablation threshold. The contents of the plasma take the shape of a plume: a region containing a mixture of ions, electrons, and nanoparticles that are highly reactive. When laser ablation is conducted in air, oxidation of the ejected particles may result. As the plume expands, its extremities are cooler than its core [22]. As a result, newly formed particles move toward cooler regions, which causes them to supersaturate, further nucleate, and crystallize into a solid structure. Collisions between gas atoms and the ablated plume in the thin interface layer generate nanoparticles and aggregates. The ambient gas coalesces with the evaporated atoms and ions at high temperatures. As the plume <b>cools,</b> <b>aggregate</b> formation begins. By the end of the laser pulse, aggregate-aggregate and atom-aggregate attachments occur [23].|$|R

The investment cost is dependent of a lot of variables such as the choice of solar collector, the type of <b>cooling</b> <b>aggregate</b> as well as the cost of the aggregate space and available space for the solar collectors. The purpose of this thesis is to give a first insight into the different cooling methods that can be used to produce comfort cooling and to help lay the ground for further research. The advantages and disadvantages are presented for the following five cooling methods: a system based on absorption, on adsorption, on a desiccant, on an ejector pump and finally on a compressor. Furthermore, are investment cost data presented for the following three cooling methods: a system based on absorption, on adsorption and finally on a compressor. The data has been collected both through a literature study and by direct contact with suppliers of cooling systems and solar collectors. It is impossible to say that one method is better than the other. All the different methods have their own advantages and disadvantages. For an installation in the center of Stockholm, where the floor space price is high, a system with small size per effect cooling is beneficial, such as a compressor driven <b>cooling</b> <b>aggregate.</b> If the floor space price does not inflict the decision, a system based on absorption could be a good alternative. Adsorption chillers do not work well together with low temperatures and do therefore not suit the Nordic climate where the aggregates can take damage at night. An adsorption chiller aggregate is, however, more effective than an absorption based system and can be a good alternative in Southern Europe. In table 5 all advantages and disadvantages for each cooling method are presented. Comparing the investment cost of cooling systems based on either a compressor, adsorption or absorption, the adsorption based system is the most cost efficient one. The most cost efficient solar collectors for thermal driven cooling systems are vacuum tube solar collectors, regardless the system type.

40|$|Previous {{studies in}} {{building}} energy assessmnet {{have made it}} clear that the largest potential energy efficiency improvements are conected to the retrofitting of existing buildings. But, lack of information about the building stock and associated modelling tools is one of the barriers to assessment of energy efficiency strategies in the building stocks. Therefore, a methodology has been developed to describe any building stock by the means of archetype buildings.  The aim has been to assess the effects of energy saving measures. The model which is used for the building energy simulation is called:  Energy, Carbon and Cost Assessment for Buildings Stocks (ECCABS). This model calculated the net energy demand <b>aggregated</b> in heating, <b>cooling,</b> lighting, hotwater and appliances.   This model has already been validated using the Swedish residential stock as a test case. The present work continues the development of the methodology by focusing on the UK building stock by discribing the UK building stock trough archetype buildings and their physical properties which are used as inputs to the ECCABS. In addition, this work seekes to check the adequacy of applying the ECCABS model to the UK building stock. The outputs which are the final energy use of the entire building stock are compared to data available in national and international sources.   The UK building stoch is described by a total of 252 archetype buildings. It is determined by considering nine building typologies, four climate zones, six periods of construction and two types of heating systems. The total final energy demand calculated by ECCABS for the residential sector is 578. 83 TWh for the year 2010, which is 2. 6 % higher than the statistics provided by the Department of Energy and Climate Change(DECC). In the non-residential sector the total final energy demand is 77. 28 TWh for the year 2009, which is about 3. 2 % lower than the energy demand given by DECC. Potential reasons which could have affected the acuracy of the final resualts are discussed in this master thesis. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} {{polymers}} with upper critical solution temperature (UCST) in water have been synthesized and characterized. The {{task was to}} answer the question why polymers with UCST in water were largely underrepresented in basic and applied research and to develop a universal approach for the synthesis of new polymers with UCST. Drawing on the example of poly(N-acryloylglycinamide) (poly(NAGA)), a polymer that is well known since 1964, it was shown that traces of ionic groups drastically decrease the UCST. In the past ionic groups have been introduced unintentionally by either acrylate impurities in the monomer, hydrolysis of the polymer side chains and/or usage of ionic initiators or chain transfer agents giving a feasible explanation why the UCST of poly(NAGA) remained unreported until 2010 as a part of this work. The synthesis of NAGA was modified in order to yield acrylate free monomer and the crystal structure was determined. A detailed analysis of the UCST suppressing effects of ionic groups followed. Only 1 ionic group in 1000 repeating units of the polymer is sufficient to completely suppress the UCST behavior. Therefore, conventional analytic methods like NMR, IR, elemental analysis, thin layer chromatography, etc. were not sensitive enough. Special methods like capillary electrophoresis and flame atomic absorption spectroscopy had to be employed to prove the hypothesis. The UCST of poly(NAGA) relies on thermally reversible hydrogen bonding. The sensitivity to ionic groups in the polymer may be explained by the very low heat of transition which could be determined by using ultrasensitive differential scanning calorimetry. Furthermore, in a prelimenary dynamic and static light scattering study it could be shown that when polymer <b>aggregates</b> collapsed upon <b>cooling</b> below the phase separation temperature their density increased by more than two orders of magnitude. In order to study the effect of polymer endgroups and the molecular weight distribution on the phase transition controlled radical polymerization via the radical addition fragmentation transfer process (RAFT) was performed. As expected, polymers with an ionic endgroup showed no UCST in pure water but in electrolyte solution. The addition of salts influenced the cloud points according to the Hofmeister series of ions. The phase transition temperature of poly(NAGA) was shifted by copolymerization with hydrophobic comonomers like butyl acrylate and styrene. The choice of monomer turned out to be crucial for the sharpness and reversibility of the phase transition. Fundamental knowledge obtained from poly(NAGA) and copolymers was subsequently transferred to simple commercially available monomers. A set of rules were established how to obtain polymers with freely tunable UCST in water as well as electrolyte solution. This hypothesis was proven by the synthesis of poly(methacrylamide) and poly(acrylamide-co-acrylonitrile), actually very old polymer systems, that showed a UCST. Finally, knowledge gained in this and previous works was condensed into a review article allowing the conclusion of further structure-property-relationships...|$|R
