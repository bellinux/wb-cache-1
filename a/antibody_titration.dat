40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the titers of neutralising antibodies against rabies virus in five hundred vaccinated owned and stray dogs within the Istanbul province. The levels of the neutralising <b>antibody</b> <b>titration</b> in the blood serum were evaluated by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) method. Sixty five (13 %) of the dogs examined had adequate level (0. 5 IU/ml and over) of <b>antibody</b> <b>titration.</b> Also, the effects on the formation of the neutralising antibody levels following the vaccination of some factors, such as being owned or stray, the number of repetition of vaccination, the age, living area, sex, interval between the last vaccination and sampling, have been evaluated statistically. As a result of the statistical evaluations, it has been determined that interval between the last vaccination and sampling had an important effect on formation of the neutralising <b>antibody</b> <b>titration</b> (P< 0. 001). Also, it was determined that the effect of the age of the dog was also significant for the neutralising antibody levels (P< 0. 05).

40|$|Background: Progress in dengue vaccine {{development}} has been hampered by limited understanding of protective immunity against dengue virus infection. Conventional neutralizing <b>antibody</b> <b>titration</b> assays that use FccR-negative cells do not consider possible infection-enhancement activity. We reasoned that as FccR-expressing cells are the major target cells of dengue virus, neutralizing <b>antibody</b> <b>titration</b> assays using FccR-expressing cells that determine the sum of neutralizing and infection-enhancing activity, may better reflect the biological properties of antibodies in vivo. Methods and Findings: We evaluated serum samples from 80 residents of a dengue endemic country, Malaysia, for neutralizing activity, and infection-enhancing activity at 1 : 10 serum dilution by using FccR-negative BHK cells and FccRexpressing BHK cells. The serum samples consisted of a panel of patients with acute DENV infection (31 %, 25 / 80) and a panel of donors without acute DENV infection (69 %, 55 / 80). A high proportion of the tested serum samples (75 %, 60 / 80) demonstrated DENV neutralizing activity (PRNT 50 $ 10) and infection-enhancing activity. Eleven of 18 serum samples from patients with acute secondary DENV infection demonstrated neutralizing activity to the infecting serotype determined by using FccR-negative BHK cells (PRNT 50 $ 10), but not when determined by using FccR-expressing cells.

Pre-existing antibodies did not modify the early stage (< 3 hr) of venom-induced edema, but significantly accelerated the normalization of this effect within 24 hr. Passive administration of antivenom either 5 or 120 min before venom injection gave similar results, suggesting {{that the presence of}} antibodies in the intravascular compartment may fully neutralize locally acting toxins, in this experimental animal model.

Results: There was no significant difference in <b>antibodies</b> <b>titration</b> between men and women. Approximately 18. 5 % of males and 16. 5 % of females were positive regarding to IgA and 70. 2 % of men and 66. 7 % of women were positive regarding to IgG. The mean of antibodies in rural populations (0. 87 ± 0. 35) was significantly (p< 0. 001) higher than those in urban populations (0. 78 ± 0. 41). The mean of antibodies in patients who had a history of gastrointestinal infection was significantly higher than others (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: Due to the high level of IgA and IgG antibodies in studied populations, especially in rural people, and lack of symptoms in patients, the screen of positive serologic populations can be helpful for the management and control of infections caused by H. pylori...|$|R
40|$|Little {{information}} is available about the cervicovaginal mucosal antibodies against human papillomavirus (HPV) proteins. In this study specific IgG antibodies against HPV 16 E 7 protein were determined in paired samples of cervicovaginal washing fluid and serum from patients with cervical cancer (n = 22), cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) (n = 38), healthy individuals (n = 22), and serum from children (n = 41) by a radioactive immunoprecipitation assay (RIPA). HPV 16 E 7 specific IgG antibodies were found in cervicovaginal washings (n = 8) and in sera (n = 8) of the patients with cervical cancer. About 60 % of the patients with HPV 16 positive cervical cancer had HPV 16 E 7 specific IgG <b>antibodies.</b> <b>Titration</b> studies showed that the IgG antibody reactivity in cervicovaginal washings was {{higher than in the}} paired serum samples of six patients with cervical cancer (P < 0. 001). In the CIN group we found no IgG reactivity in the serum, but in five patients we found a low IgG reactivity in the cervicovaginal washings. No IgG reactivity was found in cervicovaginal washings and sera from healthy individuals and sera from children. HPV 16 E 7 specific IgG antibodies seem to be locally produced in a number of patients with HPV 16 positive (pre) malignant cervical lesions. For more definitive evidence for the local production of these antibodies immunostaining should be performed to demonstrate the presence of specific anti-HPV 16 E 7 IgG producing plasma cells in the cervical epitheliu...|$|R
40|$|To {{study the}} {{occurrence}} of immunocompetent cells directly responsible for antibody production, cells from yolk sac, embryonic liver, bursa of Fabricius, bone marrow, spleen, or thymus were injected together with SRBC and Brucella abortus into 4 -day old cyclophosphamide-treated chicks. A second stimulation was given 4 days later, and samples taken 4 days thereafter were used for <b>antibody</b> <b>titrations.</b> During ontogeny, immunocompetent cells appeared in significant numbers first in the spleen for anti-SRBC responses, but in the bursa for anti-Brucella responses. Later these cells were also found in thymus and bone marrow. In the bursa, cells immunocompetent for anti-SRBC response were not encountered in significant numbers. The slight response to SRBC by transferred bursa cells reflects the presence of stem cells and their immediate descendents in the bursa {{at different stages of}} development. These findings are compared with the development and maturation of the stem cell responsible for humoral immunity. In the bursa, development of the stem cell population precedes that of immunocompetent cells. The opposite relationship was found in bone marrow, spleen, and thymus where immunocompetent cells were always present some weeks before the appearance of cells capable of achieving a long-lasting reconstitution of bursa-dependent functions. These observations reveal that the bursa seeds out immunocompetent cells during its entire postembryonic development, but does not release the lymphoid stem cell population before this population has matured sufficiently and before the bursa itself, after fulfilling its function, starts to involute...|$|R
