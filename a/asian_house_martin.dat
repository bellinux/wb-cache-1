5|$|<b>Asian</b> <b>house</b> <b>martin</b> (Delichon dasypus) {{described}} as Chelidon dasypus by Bonaparte in 1850.|$|E
5|$|The Delichon martins were {{originally}} cliff nesters, breeding in colonies situated under an overhang on a vertical cliff. However, the house martin now largely uses human structures, as, {{to a lesser}} extent, does the <b>Asian</b> <b>house</b> <b>martin.</b> The typical nest is a grass or feather-lined deep closed mud bowl with a small opening at the top, but many Asian house martins leave {{the top of the}} nest open.|$|E
5|$|Delichon is an Old World genus {{with all}} three species {{breeding}} only in the Northern Hemisphere. The common house martin is a widespread migrant breeder across Europe, north Africa and all northern temperate Asia to Kamchatka. Its western subspecies D.u.urbicum winters in tropical Africa, and eastern D.u.lagopodum moves to southern China and Southeast Asia. The <b>Asian</b> <b>house</b> <b>martin</b> breeds further south than common house martin {{in the mountains of}} central and eastern Asia; its nominate subspecies winters in Southeast Asia, but the races breeding in the Himalayan and Taiwan may just move from the high mountains to lower altitudes. The Nepal house martin is resident in the mountains of southern Asia.|$|E
5|$|The {{common and}} <b>Asian</b> <b>house</b> <b>martins</b> have {{sometimes}} been {{considered to be}} a single species, although both breed in the western Himalayas without hybridising. There is also limited DNA evidence that suggests a significant genetic distance between these two martins.|$|R
500|$|Delichon [...] {{is a small}} genus of {{passerine}} {{birds that}} belongs to the swallow family and contains three species named as <b>house</b> <b>martins.</b> These are chunky, bull-headed and short-tailed birds, blackish-blue above with a contrasting white rump, and with white or grey underparts. They have feathering on the toes and tarsi that is characteristic of this genus. The <b>house</b> <b>martins</b> {{are closely related to}} other swallows that build mud nests, particularly the Hirundo barn swallows. They breed only in Europe, Asia and the mountains of North Africa. Two species, the common and <b>Asian</b> <b>house</b> <b>martins,</b> migrate south in winter, while the Nepal <b>house</b> <b>martin</b> is resident in the Himalayas year-round.|$|R
50|$|The eastern form D. n. cuttingi has a wing {{length of}} 99 - 106 mm, {{slightly}} larger than the nominate subspecies at 90 - 98 mm. Both subspecies can be distinguished from the similar <b>Asian</b> and common <b>house</b> <b>martins</b> by their black chin, black undertail coverts and much squarer tail.|$|R
5|$|The {{numbers of}} the two Asian species are unknown, but both can be locally common or abundant, and the <b>Asian</b> <b>house</b> <b>martin</b> is {{extending}} its range in southern Siberia. The lowland breeding common house martin has greatly benefited from forest clearance, creating the open habitats it prefers, and from human habitation which has given it an abundance of safe man-made nest sites, although widespread declines in its numbers have been reported from central and northern Europe since 1970. This is due to factors including poor weather, poisoning by agricultural pesticides, lack of mud for nest building and competition with house sparrows for nest sites. Despite this, the huge geographical range and large {{numbers of the}} common house martin mean that its global status is secure.|$|E
5|$|The Delichon species {{typically}} feed {{higher in}} the air, and take smaller prey than other swallows. It is believed that this reduces inter-specific food competition, particularly with the barn swallow which shares much of the breeding and wintering range of the martins. The insects eaten are mostly small flies, aphids and Hymenoptera such as winged ants. A wide range of other insects are caught, including Lepidoptera, beetles and lacewings. The <b>Asian</b> <b>house</b> <b>martin</b> appears to occasionally take terrestrial springtails and larvae and the common house martin also sometimes feeds on the ground. These martins are gregarious, feeding in flocks often with other aerial predators like swifts, or other hirundines such as the barn or striated swallows. In the case of at least the common house martin, the start of egg laying appears {{to be linked to}} the appearance of large numbers of flying aphids, which provide a stable and abundant food supply.|$|E
500|$|Delichon martins are 13–15cm (5–6in) long, blackish blue above with a {{contrasting}} white rump, {{and with}} white or grey underparts. They are chunky, bull-headed and short-tailed birds, and have feathering on the toes and tarsi. [...] The common house martin {{is the largest}} bird of the three, with an average weight of 18.3g (0.65oz), and has the most deeply forked tail; the Nepalese species is the smallest (15g, 0.53oz) and has the squarest tail. Distinctive species plumage features are the black chin and black undertail coverts of the Nepal house martin, and the greyish wash to the underparts of the <b>Asian</b> <b>house</b> <b>martin.</b> As with other swallows and martins, the moult is slow and protracted {{because of the need}} to maintain efficient flight at all times to enable feeding. Moult normally starts on arrival at the wintering grounds, but overlaps with the breeding season for the non-migratory Nepal house martin.|$|E
5|$|The {{preferred}} {{habitat of}} the common <b>house</b> <b>martin</b> is open country with low vegetation, such as pasture, meadows and farmland, and preferably near water, although it {{is also found in}} mountains up to at least 2,200metres (7,200ft) altitude. As its name implies, it readily nests on man-made buildings, and will breed even in city centres if the air is clean enough. The other two species favour mountainous country (and sea cliffs in the case of <b>Asian</b> <b>house</b> martin); they use buildings as nest sites less frequently than their northern relative. The wintering grounds of the two migrant species include a range of open country and hilly habitats.|$|R
40|$|Afro-Palearctic migrant {{species are}} exposed to parasites at both {{breeding}} and over-wintering grounds. The <b>house</b> <b>martin</b> Delichon urbicum is one such migratory species facing high instances of blood parasite infection. In an attempt to determine whether breeding European <b>house</b> <b>martins</b> harbour similar blood parasite communities to populations breeding in North Africa, birds were sampled at their breeding grounds in Switzerland and Algeria. Moreover, haemosporidian prevalence and parasite communities were compared to published data sets on Spanish and Dutch breeding populations. This study furthermore wanted to establish whether co-infection with multiple genera or lineages of parasites had negative effects on host body condition. Breeding <b>house</b> <b>martins</b> caught in Algeria showed a higher prevalence of avian haemosporidian parasites than did European populations. Swiss <b>house</b> <b>martins</b> showed a prevalence {{comparable to that of}} Spanish and Dutch populations. There were slight differences in the haemosporidian community between European and North-African populations in terms of composition and abundance of each lineage. Similar to the Dutch <b>house</b> <b>martins,</b> but in contrast to the Spanish population, infection status and number of genera of parasites infecting single hosts did not inFLuence Swiss <b>house</b> <b>martin</b> body condition...|$|R

50|$|The <b>Asian</b> <b>house</b> <b>martin</b> is a cliff nester, {{breeding}} in colonies sited {{under an}} overhang on a vertical cliff, usually with the nests not touching. It also frequently nests on large buildings such as temples and bridges, {{but not to}} the same extent as the common house martin. The nest is a deep mud cone lined with grasses or feathers. Unlike its relatives, the <b>Asian</b> <b>house</b> <b>martin</b> frequently does not complete the enclosure of its nest, leaving it open instead like a deeper version of a barn swallow nest. A Russian study found half the nests in its Baikal research area to be of the open type, and the Himalayan subspecies D. d. cashmiriensis has also been recorded as building a shallow cup nest.|$|E
5|$|Nepal <b>house</b> <b>martin</b> (Delichon nipalense) {{described}} by Moore in 1854.|$|R
40|$|The {{intensity}} of parasite infections often increases during the reproductive {{season of the}} host {{as a result of}} parasite reproduction, increased parasite transmission and increased host susceptibility. We report within-individual variation in immune parameters, hematocrit and body mass in adult <b>house</b> <b>martins</b> Delichon urbica rearing nestlings in nests experimentally infested with <b>house</b> <b>martin</b> bugs Oeciacus hirundinis and birds rearing nestlings in initially parasite-free nests. From first to second broods body mass and hematocrit of breeding adult <b>house</b> <b>martins</b> decreased. In contrast leucocytes and immunoglobulins became more abundant. When their nests were infested with ectoparasites adults lost more weight compared with birds raising nestlings in nests treated with pyrethrin, whereas the decrease in hematocrit was more pronounced during infection with blood parasites. Neither experimental infestation with <b>house</b> <b>martin</b> bugs nor blood parasites had a significant effect on the amount of immune defences...|$|R
50|$|The Nepal <b>house</b> <b>martin</b> {{feeds on}} insects taken in flight, hunting along ridges or above treetops. The diet {{is not well}} known, but {{includes}} flies. This bird is gregarious, feeding in flocks often with other aerial predators like the Himalayan swiftlet, or other hirundines such as the barn swallow, striated swallow or common <b>house</b> <b>martin.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{habitat is}} river valleys and wooded ridges at 1000 - 4000 m altitude, {{although}} mainly below 3000 m. When not breeding, birds may descend {{as low as}} 350 m. The range of this species overlaps {{with that of the}} nominate subspecies of <b>Asian</b> <b>house</b> <b>martin,</b> although they breed at different altitudes. The height separation and the small differences in appearance seem sufficient to prevent interbreeding.|$|E

50|$|The {{preferred}} {{habitat of}} the <b>Asian</b> <b>house</b> <b>martin</b> is valleys and gorges in mountainous areas or coastal cliffs, where natural caves or crevices provide nest sites. It will also breed on large man-made sites like temples, hotels or power stations.

5|$|The urban common <b>house</b> <b>martin</b> has {{to compete}} with house sparrows, which {{frequently}} attempt {{to take over the}} nest during construction, with the <b>house</b> <b>martins</b> rebuilding elsewhere if the sparrows are successful. The entrance {{at the top of the}} completed cup is so small that the sparrows cannot take over the nest once it is finished.|$|R
5|$|Common <b>house</b> <b>martin</b> (Delichon urbicum) {{originally}} {{described as}} Hirundo urbica by Linnaeus in 1758.|$|R
50|$|This {{martin has}} blue-black upperparts with a {{contrasting}} white rump, and white underparts. It resembles its close relatives, the <b>Asian</b> <b>house</b> <b>martin</b> and common house martin, but unlike those species {{it has a}} black throat and black undertail. It feeds in flocks with other swallows, catching flies and other insects in flight. It is subject to predation and parasites, but its status within its limited range appears secure.|$|E
50|$|Birds often carry parasites, both {{external}} lice and fleas, {{and internal}} blood parasites. The <b>Asian</b> <b>house</b> <b>martin</b> is {{a host of}} the house martin flea Ceratophyllus hirundinis, and has recently been shown to carry signs of avian malaria. The predators of this martin appear to be little studied, but are presumably {{similar to those of}} the common house martin, namely fast flying falcons such as Oriental hobby which can chase down their prey in flight.|$|E
50|$|This martin breeds in colonies, {{building}} mud nests {{under an}} overhang on a vertical cliff or {{the wall of}} a building. Both sexes build the nest, incubate the three or four white eggs and feed the chicks. The <b>Asian</b> <b>house</b> <b>martin</b> feeds on small insects taken in flight, usually caught high in the air. The presence of terrestrial springtails and Lepidoptera larvae in its diet indicates that food is sometime picked from the ground.|$|E

50|$|The common <b>house</b> <b>martin</b> (Delichon urbicum), {{sometimes}} called the northern <b>house</b> <b>martin</b> or, particularly in Europe, just <b>house</b> <b>martin,</b> is a migratory passerine bird of the swallow family which breeds in Europe, north Africa and temperate Asia; and winters in sub-Saharan Africa and tropical Asia. It feeds on insects which are caught in flight, and it migrates to climates where flying insects are plentiful. It has a blue head and upperparts, white rump and pure white underparts, and is found in both open country and near human habitation. It is similar in appearance to the two other martin species of the genus Delichon, which are both endemic to eastern and southern Asia. It has two accepted subspecies.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Asian</b> <b>house</b> <b>martin</b> (Delichon dasypus) is a migratory {{passerine}} bird of the swallow family Hirundinidae. It has mainly blue-black upperparts, {{other than}} its white rump, and has pale grey underparts. Its three subspecies breed in the Himalayas and {{in central and}} eastern Asia, and spend the winter lower in the mountains or in Southeast Asia. This species is locally abundant and is expanding northward in Siberia, so there are no concerns about its conservation status.|$|E
50|$|The {{nominate}} subspecies of the <b>Asian</b> <b>house</b> <b>martin,</b> D. d. dasypus, breeds in {{the southeast}} of Russia, the Kuril Islands, Japan and sometimes Korea. It migrates through eastern China to winter in the Malay Peninsula, Borneo, the Philippines, Java and Sumatra; a few birds remain around hot springs in Japan. D. d. cashmeriensis breeds in the Himalayas from Afghanistan east to Sikkim and northwards into Tibet and western and central China. It is found between 1500 - 5000 m altitude, although mainly in the 2400 - 4000 m range. This martin is a short-range migrant, mainly wintering at lower altitudes {{in the foothills of}} the Himalayas, but with some birds on the plains of North-eastern India and North-eastern and South-eastern Bangladesh, and smaller numbers further afield in Myanmar and northern Thailand. The third race, D. d. nigrimentalis, breeds in southeastern China and southern Siberia. Its wintering grounds are unknown, but birds in Taiwan just move to lower altitudes in winter. Non-breeding <b>Asian</b> <b>house</b> <b>martin</b> have been recorded as far west as the United Arab Emirates. The range of D. d. cashmeriensis overlaps with that of the Nepal house martin, although they breed at somewhat different altitudes. The height separation and the small differences in appearance seem sufficient to prevent interbreeding.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Asian</b> <b>house</b> <b>martin</b> {{has a large}} {{range that}} {{does not appear to}} be contracting, and its numbers appear to be stable, {{although}} the total population is unknown. Since the range is more than 20,000 km2, and there are more 10,000 mature individuals, in the absence of any large decline in distribution or numbers the species does not appear to meet the criteria to be considered vulnerable, and is currently evaluated as Least Concern. This species is locally abundant and appears to be expanding its range northwards in southern Siberia.|$|E
