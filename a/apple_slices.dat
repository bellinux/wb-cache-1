40|$|Abstract A {{two-dimensional}} {{analysis of}} heat and mass transfer during radio-frequency assisted convective drying of a rectangular <b>apple</b> <b>slice</b> is performed using an implicit finite difference method. Temperature and moisture distributions inside the object are predicted. Effects of level of power density and heat transfer coefficient on moisture and temperature profiles in the product are evaluated. It is shown that increasing the level of power denstiy and heat transfer coefficient increase the temperature and decrease the moisture in the product. The results obtained from the present model are compared with those available the literature and a considerably good agreement is found...|$|R

40|$|Mass Spectrometry Imaging {{allows for}} the study of the {{distribution}} of chemical compounds in tissue sections, opening-up possibilities of much more detailed understanding of biological processes. The size and complexity of the datasets, however, makes the data analysis phase challenging, in particular in the case of untargeted datasets. In this contribution we present a novel approach based on self-organizing maps for the analysis of untargeted imaging datasets. The key idea is to generate a shortlist of prototype images which represent the distribution of related ionic signals. The possibilities and advantages of the new approach are illustrated on an in-house data set of <b>apple</b> <b>slice...</b>|$|R

50|$|Hecht's name reappeared in {{the news}} {{in the course of}} the 2004 presidential {{election}} because of an event during his term in the Senate.

Unable to talk to his colleagues and not wanting to vomit on them, he ran into the hallway, where Senator Kit Bond, a Republican from Missouri, unsuccessfully tried to help Hecht. Senator John Kerry, stepping off an elevator at the time, recognized what was happening and quickly performed the Heimlich maneuver, saving Hecht's life.|$|R

50|$|New Year's Eve (Oud en Nieuw or Oudejaarsavond) in the Netherlands {{is usually}} celebrated as a cozy evening with family or friends. Traditional snack foods are oliebollen (oil dumplings) and appelbeignets (<b>apple</b> <b>slice</b> fritters). On television, the main {{feature is the}} oudejaarsconference, a {{performance}} {{by one of the}} major Dutch cabaretiers (comparable to stand-up comedy, but more serious, generally including a satirical review of the year's politics). Historically, in Reformed Protestant families, Psalm 90 is read, although this tradition is now fading away. At midnight, Glühwein (bishops wine) or champagne is drunk. Many people light their own fireworks. Towns do not organize a central fireworks display, except for Rotterdam where the national fireworks display can be seen near the Erasmus Bridge.|$|R

Different cultivars vary in their propensity to brown after slicing and the genetically engineered Arctic Apples do not brown.

50|$|Leg hold traps {{are covered}} with wet leaves and bait or lure is applied above the trap. Muskrats favor <b>apple</b> <b>slices</b> as bait, or apple extract, cherry extract or muskrat gland as lure. Traps are set in very shallow water and are wired to a small tree growing nearby. When a muskrat is caught, it {{typically}} panics and attempts to swim for deeper water, whereupon it drowns due to {{the weight of the}} trap.|$|E

Savoury fillings include fried vegetables, fried chicken, minced meat, and a variety of added ingredients such as potatoes, mushrooms, cabbage or ham. Another Polish dish reassembling pancakes are racuchy. They are smaller and thicker than naleśniki and can be stuffed with <b>apple</b> <b>slices.</b>|$|E

40|$|We {{conducted}} a study in 2 heavily infested orchards in the mid-Hudson Valley of New York to evaluate methods for detecting the presence of meadow voles (MV, Microtus pennsylvanicus) and pine voles (PV, M. pinetorum) under apple trees. We quantified several possible signs indicating the presence of voles {{in each of the}} 4 quadrants under the canopy of each tree, and then set and monitored traps until capture success in the orchard declined to zero. There was no evidence that the 4 quadrants differed with respect to any of the variables examined. The <b>apple</b> <b>slice</b> index (ASI) was the best indicator for both species. Detection improved significantly (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) when the ASI was used in conjunction with the number of runways (MV) or tunnels (PV) under the tree, although neither of the latter 2 signs was by itself a reliable indicator. The ASI and search for runways and tunnels should be conducted in at least 2 quadrants under each tree. The significance of these findings for managing voles in apple orchards is discussed...|$|R

In [...] "The Squab-Pie. A Devonshire Tale" [...] published in 1827, John Taylor uses verse to tell of the captain of a ship in Plymouth who forgot to get meat for his trip. A boy on the ship goes into town to claim a large squab pie from the bakery for a penny, though it was not meant to be his. Set on a Sunday, the family who had commissioned the pie from the baker, in order to avoid cooking, try to find it, but to no avail. Taylor explains the moral is that if you believe it is a sin to cook on a Sunday, you should not be still having a big meal by getting a baker to cook for you.|$|R
