50|$|A {{standard}} beadlock {{is designed}} to clamp the tire bead between an outer <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>inner</b> <b>ring.</b> The inner ring may be welded onto a standard wheel increasing wheel width by anywhere from 1½ to 2 inches or may be formed {{as part of the}} wheel when the wheel is made in the factory. The outer ring is then bolted onto the inner ring with the bead clamped between them. Anywhere between 16 and 32 bolts at around 10 ft·lbf are used around the circumference of the wheel to keep the clamp tight. The rings and bolts can cause problems with balancing the wheel and tire because all the added weight is on one side. This style is used exclusively for offroad use.|$|E
50|$|Every {{town and}} village has a rider camp inside its walls for the riders and their nighthorses. Generally the rider camp sits between the outer {{walls of the}} town and the inner walls {{surrounding}} the town proper. Large towns like Shamesey split the town proper into an outer ring that borders the rider camp for the workers, <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>inner</b> <b>ring</b> for the wealthy merchants. These merchants are thus shielded not only from sendings from the Wild, but also from sendings from the nighthorses in the rider camps. One notable exception is the industrial town of Anveney. It has no rider camp and no protection from riders. The {{reason for this is that}} Anveney and the surrounding areas are so polluted that no local fauna venture near it.|$|E
50|$|Chatham is {{the hub of}} the Medway Towns. This fact {{means that}} the {{existing}} road system has always proved inadequate for the amount of traffic it has to handle, and various schemes have been tried to alleviate the congestion. The High Street itself is traffic-free, so all traffic has to skirt around it. The basic west-east routes are The Brook to the north and New Road to the south, but the additional problems caused by the situation of the Pentagon Bus Station meant that conflicting traffic flows were the result. In the 1980s the Chatham town centre was remodelled <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>inner</b> <b>ring</b> road - a one-way system - was constructed. This was completed with the construction of the Sir John Hawkins Flyover opened in 1989 carrying the south to north traffic over the High Street.|$|E
5000|$|A {{bonded seal}} {{consists}} of an outer annular ring of a hard material, typically steel, <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>inner</b> annular <b>ring</b> of <b>an</b> elastomeric material {{that acts as a}} gasket. It is the compression of the elastomeric part between the faces of the parts {{on either side of the}} bonded seal that provides the sealing action. The elastomeric material, typically nitrile rubber, is bonded by heat and pressure to the outer ring, which holds it in place. This structure increases resistance to bursting, increasing the pressure rating of the seal. Because the bonded seal itself acts to retain the gasket material, there is no need for the parts to be sealed to be shaped to retain the gasket. This results in simplified machining and greater ease of use as compared to some other seals, such as O-rings. Some designs come with an additional flap of rubber on the internal diameter to locate the bonded seal at the centre of the hole, these are called self-centring bonded washers ...|$|R

40|$|The double-ring {{infiltrometer}} {{is widely}} used to measure soil saturated hydraulic conductivity in the field. Both the <b>inner</b> <b>ring</b> size and outer ring size (two factors in the buffer index) of an infiltrometer affect the measurements of saturated hydraulic conductivity. Few systematic {{studies have been conducted}} to investigate the combined effects of the <b>inner</b> and outer <b>ring</b> sizes of a double-ring infiltrometer on the measurements of field saturated hydraulic conductivity. A total of 7224 numerical simulations were conducted to investigate the optimum combination of <b>inner</b> and outer <b>ring</b> sizes for reliable saturated hydraulic conductivity measurements by using 24 infiltrometers with six <b>inner</b> <b>ring</b> diameters (10, 20, 40, 80, 120, and 200 cm) and, for each ring diameter, four buffer indices (b = 0. 2, 0. 33, 0. 5, and 0. 71). Results demonstrated that the <b>inner</b> <b>ring</b> size is <b>a</b> more important factor to be considered than the buffer index itself (or the outer ring size) in practice, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> larger <b>inner</b> <b>ring</b> diameter assembled with an outer ring (in most cases, with diameter >= 80 cm and b >= 0. 33) is recommended to obtain reliable in situ measurement of soil field saturated hydraulic conductivity...|$|R

5000|$|The first {{attempts}} to use photoionization microscopy {{were performed on}} atoms of Xenon (Xe) {{by a team of}} Dutch researchers in 2001. Photoionization in the presence of an electric field allows the quantum nature of the wavefunction of an electron to be observed in the macroscopic world [...] The differences between direct and indirect ionization create different trajectories for the outgoing electron to follow. Direct ionization corresponds to electrons ejected down-field towards the bottleneck in the Coulomb + dc electric field potential, whereas indirect ionization corresponds to electrons ejected away from the bottleneck in the Coulomb + dc electric field and only ionize upon further Coulomb interactions. The different trajectories caused by direct and indirect ionization gives rise to a distinct pattern that can be detected by a two-dimensional flux detector and subsequently imaged. The images exhibited an outer ring, which corresponded to the indirect ionization process <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>inner</b> <b>ring,</b> which corresponded to the direct ionization process. This oscillatory pattern can be interpreted as being interferences among the trajectories of the electrons moving from the atom to the detector.|$|E
50|$|E0102 is {{the remnant}} of a {{supernova}} that {{exploded in the}} neighbouring galaxy known as the Small Magellanic Cloud. The supernova was caused when a star much more massive than the Sun collapsed under its own gravity. The explosion would have been visible from the Southern Hemisphere of the Earth over 1000 years ago. The appearance of E0102 is best explained by a model in which the ejecta is shaped like a cylinder that is being viewed almost exactly end-on. This model suggests that the explosion that created the E0102 remnant may itself have been strongly asymmetric, consistent with the rapid kicks given to neutron stars after supernova explosions. Another possibility is that the star exploded into a disk of material formed when material was shed from the equator of the pre-supernova red giant star. Such asymmetries have been observed in winds from lower mass red giants that form planetary nebulas. The remnant consists of an outer blast wave produced by the supernova, <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>inner</b> <b>ring</b> of cooler material. This inner ring is probably expanding ejecta from the explosion that is being heated by a shock wave travelling backwards into the ejecta.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to {{evaluate}} the performance characteristics of the preclinical X-PET subsystem of the FLEX Triumph PET/CT scanner based on the NU 4 - 2008 standards of the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA). METHODS: The performance parameters evaluated include the spatial resolution, scatter fraction, count losses and random coincidences, sensitivity, and image-quality characteristics. The PET detector array consisted of 11, 520 individual bismuth germanate crystals arranged in 48 rings and 180 blocks, with an axial field of view (FOV) of 11. 6 cm <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>inner</b> <b>ring</b> diameter of 16. 5 cm. The spatial resolution was measured with a small (22) Na point source (diameter, 0. 25 mm) at different radial offsets from the center. Sensitivity was calculated using the same source by stepping the source axially through the axial FOV of the scanner. Scatter fraction and counting-rate performances were determined using <b>a</b> mouse- <b>and</b> rat-sized phantom with an (18) F line source insert. The NEMA image-quality phantom and rodent imaging were also performed to access the overall imaging capabilities of the scanner. RESULTS: Tangential spatial resolution in terms of full width at half maximum varied between 2. 2 mm {{at the center of}} the FOV and 2. 3 mm at a radial offset of 2. 5 cm. The radial spatial resolution varied between 2. 0 at the center and 4. 4 mm at a radial offset of 2. 3 cm. The peak system absolute sensitivity was 5. 9 % {{at the center of the}} FOV. The absolute system sensitivity was 0. 67 counts/s/Bq, and the relative total system sensitivity was 73. 9 %. The scatter fraction for the mouse-sized phantom was 7. 9 %, with a peak true counting rate of 168 kilocounts per second (kcps) at 0. 3 MBq/mL <b>and</b> <b>a</b> peak noise-equivalent counting rate of 106 kcps at 0. 17 MBq/mL. The rat-sized phantom had a scatter fraction of 21 %, with a peak true counting rate of 93 kcps at 0. 034 MBq/mL <b>and</b> <b>a</b> peak noise-equivalent counting rate of 49 kcps at 0. 02 MBq/mL. Recovery coefficients for the image-quality phantom ranged from 0. 13 to 0. 88. CONCLUSION: The performance of the X-PET scanner based on the NEMA NU 4 - 2008 standards was fully characterized. The overall performance demonstrates that the X-PET system is suitable for preclinical research...|$|R
40|$|After the {{establishment}} of the first quarantine station in the Republic of Ragusa (modern-day Dubrovnik) in 1377, the states and principalities of Italy developed a sophisticated system of defensive quarantine in an attempt to protect themselves from the ravages of plague.

40|$|The {{morphology}} of {{the rings}} of Saturn and the mechanisms proposed to explain their fluctuations and origin are discussed and illustrated with photographs <b>and</b> diagrams in <b>a</b> general review.
