Even when setting lyrics clearly narrated by a man, he often favoured a female voice, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have preferred his best-known cycle, Shéhérazade, to be sung by a woman, although a tenor {{voice is a}} permitted alternative in the score.|$|E
5|$|Richard's time as {{archbishop}} {{was much}} less stormy than Becket's had been, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have had better relations with the king. Richard attended the royal councils, and more than once was with the king in Normandy. Richard was less dogmatic {{on the rights of}} the clergy than his great predecessor had been; but his compromises were regarded by the monastic writers and the followers of Becket as a sign of weakness. Pope Alexander III took Richard to task when Richard acquiesced in the election of bishops taking place in the royal chapel. As part of his diplomatic efforts on the king's behalf, Richard escorted Henry's daughter Joan to Provence on her journey in 1176 to marry King William II of Sicily. Richard also spent part of 1177 in Flanders on diplomatic business for King Henry.|$|E
5|$|Gilli was an eleventh-century Hebridean {{chieftain}} {{whose career}} coincided with {{an era of}} Orcadian overlordship in the Kingdom of the Isles. According to mediaeval saga-tradition, Gilli was a brother-in-law of Sigurðr Hlǫðvisson, Earl of Orkney, having married the latter's sister Hvarflǫð. Traditionally {{regarded as one of}} the most powerful Orcadian earls, Sigurðr appears to have extended his authority into the Isles in the late tenth century. Gilli apparently acted as Sigurðr's viceroy or tributary earl in the region. The time frame of Gilli's apparent authority in the Isles is uncertain, and may date as early as the reign of Guðrøðr Haraldsson, King of the Isles, or as late as the period following the death of this man's eventual successor, Rǫgnvaldr Guðrøðarson, King of the Isles. Gilli's name is probably Gaelic in origin, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have seated himself on either Coll or Colonsay, islands in the Inner Hebrides. It is possible that Gilli is identical to Gilla Ciaráin mac Glún Iairn, an Uí Ímair dynast who was slain at the Battle of Clontarf in 1014. If not, another possibility is that he was the father of a certain Conamal/Conmáel who was killed in 980.|$|E

Nasco and his colleagues, including Ruffo, were influenced by the music of Adrian Willaert, the founder and most famous early member of the Venetian School. Willaert was maestro di cappella at St. Mark's in Venice, which was not far from Treviso; Venice was also the city in which much of Nasco's music was published.|$|E
25|$|Several Bactrian kings {{followed}} after Demetrius' death, and {{it seems}} likely that the civil wars between them made it possible for Apollodotus I (from c. 180/175 BC) to make himself independent as the first proper Indo-Greek king (who did not rule from Bactria). Large numbers of his coins have been found in India, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have reigned in Gandhara as well as western Punjab. Apollodotus I was succeeded by or ruled alongside Antimachus II, likely the son of the Bactrian king Antimachus I.|$|E
25|$|Peter was a well-connected controversialist and propagandist for Henry II. He {{wrote in}} praise of him to {{continental}} contacts, like Walter of the Mill, now Archbishop of Palermo, defending him against the charge that he had deliberately instigated the murder of Thomas Becket. In introducing the subject of Becket's death, Peter mentioned in passing his own clerical order: in verbo Domini et in ordine diaconi vobis dico – “in the Word of God and the order of deacon I speak to you.” At some stage in his education, he had been ordained a deacon <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have avoided ordination to the priesthood.|$|E

Blood is gushing from the head and the neck of the dead Medusa. The richly decorated marble pedestal, also by Cellini, shows four graceful bronze statuettes of Jupiter, Mercurius, Minerva and Danaë. The bas-relief on the pedestal, representing Perseus freeing Andromeda, is a copy of the one in Bargello.|$|E
25|$|His {{last years}} were saddened not merely {{by the death}} of many of his closest friends, but by {{increasing}} ill-health. This did not interfere with the quality of his literary work; he was rarely idle and some of his latest work is among his best. But he indulged the temptation to alter his work repeatedly, and many of his later alterations are not improvements. Towards the end of 1585 his health deteriorated, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have moved restlessly from one of his houses to another for some months. When the end came, which, though in great pain, he met in a resolute and religious manner, he was at his priory of Saint-Cosme in Touraine, and he was buried in the church of that name on Friday, 27 December 1585.|$|E
25|$|Some of the {{key members}} of the court of Senusret I are known. The vizier at the {{beginning}} of his reign was Intefiqer, who is known from many inscriptions and from his tomb next to the pyramid of Amenemhat I. He seems to have held this office for a long period of time and was followed by a vizier named Senusret. Two treasurers are known from the reign of the king: Sobekhotep (year 22) and Mentuhotep. The latter had a huge tomb next to the pyramid of the king <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have been the main architect of the Amun temple at Karnak. Several high stewards are attested. Hor is known from several stelae and from an inscription in the Wadi el-Hudi where he was evidently the leader of an expedition for amethyst. One of the stelae is dated to year nine of the king. A certain Nakhr followed in office attested around year 12 of the king. He had a tomb at Lisht. A certain Antef, son of a woman called Zatamun is known again from several stelae, one dates to year 24 another one to year 25 of Senusret I. Another Antef was the son a woman called Zatuser and was most likely also high steward in the king's reign.|$|E

25|$|After 1510 he {{may have}} lived in London, and it is {{suggested}} that {{he may have}} had some association with the court of Henry VIII. In 1520/21 he was paid by the Dean and Chapter of the Collegiate Church of St Mary, Warwick, to advise on the purchase and installing of a new organ. By 1525 at the latest Aston was settled and working in Leicester, as a verbatim record of his evidence given to a Bishop’s Visitation on 27 & 28 November 1525 is preserved in the Lincoln Diocesan Records, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have stayed in Leicester {{for the rest of his}} life. His appointment in Leicester was that of Keeper of the Organs and Magister Choristerorum (Master of the Choristers) at the major Royal foundation, the Hospital and College of St Mary of the Annunciation. This was first established by Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster in 1330, and re-endowed and substantially enlarged by his son Henry, 4th Earl and later 1st Duke of Lancaster under a Charter of 24 March 1355/6. Later known as The Newarke, the institution had a Dean and twelve Canons (later termed Prebends), thirteen Vicars-Choral, four Lay Clerks and six (boy) choristers. By the late 15th century it had achieved a high status and musical reputation and had acquired the privilege, apparently shared only with the Chapels Royal, of having the right to recruit outstanding musicians and singers from other institutions without their consent, in other words to poach the very best musicians of the country. Perhaps the already highly regarded Aston was himself recruited by The Newarke using this privilege, but there seems to be no surviving documentary evidence of exactly how or when he came to be engaged by the Leicester Choral College.|$|E
500|$|In August that year, Harrison {{set off for}} {{a driving}} holiday around Europe without Boyd, a trip that Huntley {{describes}} as [...] "the first publicly visible signs" [...] of problems in the Harrisons' marriage.

Sometimes he takes Pattie with him, but I feel he just felt like a holiday and wanted to get away." ...|$|E
500|$|Around {{this same}} time, the thirty-two year-old Phips {{had made his}} way to England, where he gained an {{audience}} with Narborough and Charles II. [...] By any measure, this was a remarkable achievement for a poor New Englander like Phips, but it also seems clear that he must have been at {{the right place at the}} right time. His reputation for finding sunken ships may have preceded him, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have had demonstrable gains to show, as one letter writer mentions his 'late successful returns.' Perhaps he delivered the King's portion of these returns to Whitehall in person? [...] In any case, a reckless plan was concocted, probably by Narborough, whereby this New England native, despite having no background in the English navy, would be assigned as the commander of a 20-gun frigate, HMS Rose of Algiers for a treasure hunt, but given no other financial backing. He and his crew would be required to pay for all other expenses of the voyage, including food and diving equipment, and give a deposit of £100. Of the treasure they found, 35% would go to the King, and the rest would be divided among the otherwise unpaid crew.|$|E

500|$|Two {{days after}} Phips left the Boston area, Increase Mather gave a rousing {{speech to the}} deputies and freemen advising them not {{to submit to the}} crown and to resist the quo warranto. One {{historian}} calls this Increase Mather's [...] "first important entry into politics." [...] {Mather's [...] "Remarkable Providences" [...] was distributed this same month, with echoes to the New England government Increase Mather assembles in 1692.} It had been Phips' debut into colonial politics too, if clumsily and involuntarily. [...] To what extent he was swayed by the arguments of Randolph as they crossed the Atlantic, it is hard to know, but Phips certainly played the role with bluster, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have spoken up as a royalist to the Boston government in the meetings he had with Bradstreet and Stoughton, at least as recorded by Knepp. [...] By 1688, Phips would cross over to Increase Mather's side and begin to consistently oppose Randolph and the Dominion government he helped to bring about, and with a vehemence that would seem to suggest some degree of shame and dismay for the role he played as captain of HMS Rose in 1683-4.|$|E
500|$|After the film's release, {{there was}} {{controversy}} over whether several alien characters reflect racial stereotypes. For example, the oafish, slow-witted Jar Jar Binks had long droopy ears reminiscent of dreadlocks {{and spoke with}} what many perceived as a Caribbean patois reminiscent of Jamaican Creole. The greedy and corrupt Neimoidians of the Trade Federation spoke with East Asian accents and the unprincipled trader Watto has been interpreted as a Jewish stereotype reminiscent of Charles Dickens' character Fagin. Lucas has denied all of these implications, instead criticizing the American media for using opinions from the Internet as a reliable source for news stories. Lucas added that it reflected more the racism of the commenters than it does the movie; however, animator Rob Coleman said he viewed footage of Alec Guinness as Fagin in Oliver Twist to inspire his animators {{in the creation of}} Watto. Drew Grant described Jar Jar Binks as [...] "ervile and cowardly...a black minstrel-ish stereotype on par with Stepin Fetchit." [...] Michael Eric Dyson, professor of African-American studies at Georgetown University, said the entire Gungan people seem oddly suggestive of a primitive African tribe. Dyson said [...] "The leader of Jar Jar's tribe is a fat, bumbling buffoon with a rumbling voice, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be a caricature of a stereotypical African tribal chieftain." ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{cast member}} Dan Castellaneta {{occasionally}} voiced Santa's Little Helper for bit parts, American voice artist Frank Welker most often provided {{the sounds of}} the dog and other animals on the show from [...] "Bart's Dog Gets an F", which aired on March 7, 1991, to [...] "Home Sweet Homediddly-Dum-Doodily", which aired on October 1, 1995. He said on his official website in 2007 that he liked portraying Santa's Little Helper because the dog was a [...] "sympathetic" [...] character. Welker has been praised by staff members for his performances on the show. David Mirkin has noted that [...] "he can do anything, and it fits perfectly. You forget you're listening to a guy, and he's a pleasure to work with." [...] Groening has commented that he was [...] "unbelievably good" [...] at doing animal noises. After 1995, Castellaneta voiced Santa's Little Helper on his own while Welker performed other animal noises until his full departure in 2002, when he was denied a pay raise. In the [...] "questions and answers" [...] section on his website, Welker revealed that the reason he stopped performing as Santa's Little Helper was because [...] "The producers thought...

[...] Brian Howe from Paste described the track as [...] "flashy and hollow". The Greyhound gave the song a negative review and believed that [...] "with a lackluster hook and the repetition of the name 'Wale,' the airplay and sales of this single will depend greatly upon the vocals of Lady Gaga." [...] Wilson McBee from Slant Magazine criticized both [...] "Chillin" [...] and the follow-up single, [...] "World Tour", as [...] "tepid Cool & Dre productions in which Wale seems to be attempting Black Eyed Peas-style halftime-show rap."
