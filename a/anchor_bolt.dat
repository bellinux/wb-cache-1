50|$|The {{simplest}} <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt</b> is a cast-in-place anchor. As {{seen in the}} figure, most designs {{consist of}} a standard bolt with a hexagonal head, which is cast in the wet concrete before it sets. There are other designs, some consisting of a bent bolt with a hook on the end, or some other sort of bending. Cast-in-place anchor bolts are the strongest type of fastener, but the casting is difficult, and they are usually only used for heavy machines mounted on poured concrete floors. Another use of this <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt</b> is to connect the concrete foundation of a building to its wall. With this, the building is more resistant to earthquakes. Currently there are several devices to assist in holding and in placing <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt</b> to set in the concrete. These devices are mostly made from composite plastic.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Rock bolting {{is one of}} {{the most}} common methods of rock reinforcement. To {{optimize}} bolt parameters for reasonably playing its properties under safe support condition, it’s a must to study the mechanical characteristics of roadway and bolt. This paper shows that <b>anchor</b> <b>bolts</b> at the top of the rise side has the maximum force, middle of the two sides minimal. Middle of two sides has the largest displacement, top and bottom smallest by using flac 3 d to simulate the force of special-shaped roadway under the support of <b>anchor</b> <b>bolts,</b> combined with field observance of <b>anchor</b> <b>bolts</b> force. Therefore, by optimizing <b>anchor</b> <b>bolts</b> supporting parameters, we can effectively control the deformation of surrounding rocks and improve the whole stability through strengthening support and changing partial <b>anchor</b> <b>bolts</b> supporting parameters...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} {{focuses on}} the vibration response of the wind turbine tower–foundation system to identify and describe the stress state of the system. First, the movements of an existing wind turbine tower-foundation system were measured using accelerometers {{at the top and}} middle of a 20 m tower. Elastic behaviors of the tower and <b>anchor</b> <b>bolts</b> that transfer motion to its foundation were verified using various strain gauges. The spectrum of the strain of the <b>anchor</b> <b>bolts</b> generally agreed with the acceleration spectrum. Next, three-dimensional nonlinear FE analyses were performed to identify stress states of various parts of the system. The FE model was verified through data obtained from a field-based free vibration test. Then, the model was examined with a displacing obtained by processing the field measurement data. The obtained accelerations of the tower were consistent with the measured data; however, the calculated strain of the <b>anchor</b> <b>bolts</b> was larger than the measured strain. Further analysis was conducted to predict the ultimate state at failure. The deformation and stress of the <b>anchor</b> <b>bolts</b> suggested that the <b>anchor</b> <b>bolts</b> are the dominant load-carrying mechanism and failure mode of the tower-foundation system...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a three-dimensional nonlinear finite elemental analysis about the reinforcement concrete beams strengthened by bolting steel plate, {{which is a}} new strengthening method by anchoring plate to beam surface but not using any glue to help bonding. The contact effects between the steel plate with reinforced concrete beam surface was simulated by developing the contact elements. The effects of the plate thickness and the collocation of <b>anchor</b> <b>bolts</b> were investigated. The damage evolution about variable collocation of <b>anchor</b> <b>bolts</b> were investigated. It is declared that the collocation of <b>anchor</b> <b>bolts</b> play an obvious effects on the flexural capacity of strengthened beams, but the plate thickness give a little influence on it. ...|$|R
50|$|A pin shackle {{is closed}} with an <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt</b> and cotter pin, {{in a manner}} similar to a clevis. It is for this reason they are often {{referred}} to, in industrial jargon, as clevises. Pin shackles can be inconvenient to work with, at times, as the bolt will need to be secured to the shackle body to avoid its loss, usually with a split pin or seizing wire. A more secure version used in crane rigging features the combination of a securing nut (hardware) located alongside the cotter pin. Pin shackles are practical in many rigging applications where the <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt</b> is expected to experience some rotation.|$|E
50|$|Resin grouted rebar is used {{in areas}} which require more support than a point <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt</b> can give. The rebar used is of similar size as a point <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt</b> but {{does not have an}} {{expansion}} shell. Once the hole for the rebar is drilled, cartridges of polyester resin are installed in the hole. The rebar bolt is installed after the resin and spun by the installation drill. This opens the resin cartridge and mixes it. Once the resin hardens the drill spinning tightens the rebar bolt holding the rock together. Resin grouted rebar is considered a permanent ground support with a lifespan of 20-30 years.|$|E

50|$|A {{rock bolt}} {{is a long}} <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt,</b> for {{stabilizing}} rock excavations, which {{may be used in}} tunnels or rock cuts. It transfers load from the unstable exterior to the confined (and much stronger) interior of the rock mass.|$|E

50|$|An <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt</b> is a {{fastener}} used to attach objects or structures to concrete. There are {{many types of}} anchor bolts, consisting of designs that are mostly proprietary to the manufacturing companies. All consist of a threaded end, to which a nut and washer can be attached for the external load. Anchor bolts are extensively used on all types of projects, from standard buildings to dams and nuclear power plants. They {{can also be used}} to firmly affix embed plates to a concrete foundation when used with a structural steel element.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Experiments were {{conducted}} to study the attenuation properties of ultrasonic guided wave propagating in <b>anchored</b> rock <b>bolts.</b> Results show that concrete as anchored material at different curing time can represent different bonding quality, and attenuation coefficient value of ultrasonic guided wave in <b>anchored</b> <b>bolt</b> increases as the increasing of curing time. At the mean time, the attenuation coefficient value becomes larger when the anchored length of rock bolt increases. So attenuation coefficient value is an efficient tool to evaluate the bonding quality of <b>anchored</b> rock <b>bolt...</b>|$|R
50|$|Rock bolts work by 'knitting' {{the rock}} mass {{together}} sufficiently {{before it can}} move enough to loosen and fail by unraveling (piece by piece). As in the photo, rock bolts {{may be used to}} support wire mesh, but this is usually a small part of their function. Unlike common <b>anchor</b> <b>bolts,</b> rock bolts can become 'seized' throughout their length by small shears in the rock mass, so they are not fully dependent on their pull-out strength. This has become an item of controversy in the Big Dig project, which used the much lighter pull-out tests for rock bolts rather than the proper tests for concrete <b>anchor</b> <b>bolts.</b>|$|R

The car smashed into the outside wall of the track and then rolled 325 feet along the barrier. The car came to rest in a grassy plot between the wall and Grandstand A, with {{the tail of the}} car on fire. Results showed the {{accident}} was caused by an <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt</b> which fell off the front radius rod support, allowing the front axle to twist and misalign the front wheels when the brakes were applied, which drove the car into the wall.|$|E
50|$|Core shrouds crack {{because the}} heat from the nuclear {{reactions}} combined with the constant flowing water eventually wear out the steel plates. One method used to fix this problem is reinforcing the core shroud plates. This is done using an <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt,</b> which is used to attach additional steel plates to the core shroud surface, thereby reinforcing the structure. This is the most common method used to fix cracks in the core shroud since it is easy and relatively safe. Replacement of the core shroud is also an option, but it is not recommended because the cracked plates must be removed manually, leaving the laborers susceptible to radiation.|$|E
50|$|Point {{anchor bolts}} (or {{expansion}} shell bolts) {{are a common}} style of area ground support. A point <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt</b> is a metal bar between 20 mm - 25 mm in diameter, and between 1 m - 4 m long (the size {{is determined by the}} mine's engineering department). There is an expansion shell {{at the end of the}} bolt which is inserted into the hole. As the bolt is tightened by the installation drill the expansion shell expands and the bolt tightens holding the rock together. Mechanical bolts are considered temporary support as their lifespan is reduced by corrosion as they are not grouted.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, the tensile {{behavior}} of groups of Ajax <b>anchored</b> blind <b>bolts</b> used within concrete-filled steel square hollow sections is investigated. Using Ajax <b>anchored</b> blind <b>bolts</b> moment-resisting bolted connections to concrete-filled steel hollow section columns will be possible. Extensive experimental and numerical studies were undertaken. Bolt sizes and section sizes suitable for medium-rise commercial buildings were used. It {{was concluded that}} the groups of Ajax <b>anchored</b> blind <b>bolts</b> can reach the ultimate capacity of equivalent groups of standard structural bolts. The location of an Ajax <b>anchored</b> blind <b>bolt</b> relative to the section side walls has a significant influence on its behavior. For bolts located close to the side walls of a section, concrete struts developed and transferred the loads {{to the corner of}} the sections. Bolt diameter, concrete grade, and strut angle were found to be the most influential factors in the stiffness of an Ajax <b>anchored</b> blind <b>bolt.</b> A simple theoretical model, based on finite-element (FE) parametric studies, was developed to estimate the tensile {{behavior of}} groups of Ajax <b>anchored</b> blind <b>bolts.</b> This was essential for the application of Ajax <b>anchored</b> blind <b>bolts</b> in building construction practice...|$|R

50|$|Rigid support can be {{provided}} either from bottom or top. In case of bottom supports generally a stanchion or Pipe Clamp Base is used. It can be simply kept on steel structure for only rest type supports. To simultaneously restrict in another direction separate plate or Lift up Lug can be used. A pipe anchor is a rigid support that restricts movement in all three orthogonal directions and all three rotational directions, i.e. restricting al the {{6 degrees of freedom}} This usually is a welded stanchion that is welded or bolted to steel or concrete. In case of anchor which is bolted to concrete, a special type of bolt is required called <b>Anchor</b> <b>Bolt,</b> which is used to hold the support with concrete. In this type of support, normal force and friction force can become significant. To alleviate the frictional effect Graphite Pad or PTFE plates are used when required.|$|E
5000|$|A screw {{will usually}} have a head on one end that {{contains}} a specially formed shape that allows it to be turned, or driven, with a tool. Common tools for driving screws include screwdrivers and wrenches. The head is usually larger than {{the body of the}} screw, which keeps the screw from being driven deeper than the length of the screw and to provide a bearing surface. There are exceptions; for instance, carriage bolts have a domed head that is not designed to be driven; set screws often have a head smaller than the outer diameter of the screw; J-bolts have a J-shaped head which is not designed to be driven, but rather is usually sunk into concrete allowing it to be used as an <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt.</b> The cylindrical portion of the screw from the underside of the head to the tip is known as the shank; it may be fully threaded or partially threaded. The distance between each thread is called the [...] "pitch".|$|E
40|$|AbstractDuring the {{extraction}} {{process of the}} top coal caving working face, the fierce looseness, deformation as well as fracture of the surrounding rocks would usually occur because the slots will get strong disturbance. Meanwhile, <b>anchored</b> <b>bolt</b> and cable-bolt shall deform accordingly. When the deformation of the <b>anchored</b> <b>bolt</b> or cable-bolt comes to the extreme extent, they will crack. Then the catapulting and wounding incident will easily happen if the fractural part of the <b>anchored</b> <b>bolt</b> and cable-bolt is not fully griped by the rocks. In the paper, based on the dynamic mechanism analysis on fracture phenomenon about the anchored cable-bolt, the formulas of the kinetic energy and speed of the fractural catapult of the horizontally anchored cables in the ribs and the vertically anchored cables in the roof have been established. And a bolt support theory “small pretightening force & large expected anchorage strength” has been put forward, which is useful for seriously deformed roadways to prevent anchored cable-bolts from breaking. In addition, a technological method to stop anchored cable-bolt ejecting by means of pipe cap has been put forward...|$|R

5000|$|The tornado then {{crossed into}} McClain County, tearing through {{residential}} areas {{along the north}} edge of Blanchard. According to NWS damage surveyors, the tornado [...] "shrunk and tightened to plausibly EF5 strength" [...] as it approached and crossed Kitty Hawk Road, scouring away a large area of pavement. Sections of asphalt were gouged out by high-velocity debris impacts further along the road, and nearby trees were reduced to completely debarked stumps. As the now narrow, but very intense tornado ripped through the front lawn of a nearby house, all grass and several inches of topsoil was scoured away in a narrow swath. Several homes were reduced to bare slabs in this area, and vehicles were thrown up to 600 yards away, including a pickup truck that was torn into multiple pieces. Due to intensity of the damage in this area, surveyors noted that the tornado was [...] "plausibly EF5" [...] as it clipped {{the north side of}} Blanchard, though the fact that the homes swept away were missing some of their <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt</b> washers led to a high-end EF4 rating being assigned instead. Just to the northeast, the tornado maintained its strength as it struck a steel-reinforced concrete dome home, which was shredded by flying debris and sustained partial cracking of its frame. Asphalt was scoured from the home's paved driveway as well. The tornado then weakened to EF3 strength as it crossed Sandrock Road, debarking trees and heavily damaging or destroying several homes in nearby subdivisions. Several cars were blown out from underneath a nearby overpass and mangled. The tornado weakened further as it passed southeast of Newcastle, with mainly tree and power pole damage noted in that area. Additional minor damage to trees, power lines, and outbuildings occurred as the tornado crossed into Cleveland County, executing a loop in a field before dissipating just west of Moore.|$|E
50|$|The tornado {{touched down}} west of Bradley, causing EF0 to EF1 tree damage as it crossed State Highway 19 (SH-19). Continuing to the northeast, the tornado {{intensified}} further to EF3 strength {{as it passed}} through rural areas of Grady County, snapping and debarking numerous trees. An extensive swath of ground scouring began as the tornado crossed into McClain County. The tornado then reached EF4 strength as it crossed SH-76, leveling and sweeping away several well-built homes. Vehicles were thrown long distances and mangled almost beyond recognition nearby. The tornado weakened and narrowed as it crossed CR 410, with EF2 to EF3-strength damage occurring in that area. The tornado re-intensified to EF4 strength further to the northeast as it passed between Dibble and Washington. Numerous well-built homes were leveled in that area, and some were swept completely away. Unusual cycloidal debris impact scars were noted in open fields as well. One well-built home in this area with numerous anchor bolts {{was reduced to a}} bare slab, though a metal fence immediately next to the house remained standing and grass on the property was not scoured. Another home that was reduced to a bare slab in this area had anchor bolts spaced every two feet (well above the standard of anchoring required for an EF5 rating), though a closer inspection of the home site revealed that a large mobile home frame had smashed into the house during the tornado, and a jacuzzi found in the rubble behind the house was still in usable condition. Due to these contextual discrepancies, damage in this area was rated high-end EF4 rather than EF5. The tornado curved sharply to the north and weakened to EF3 strength as it continued north of Washington, though one final area of EF4 damage occurred southwest of Goldsby as a large, well-built home was completely swept away with only the slab remaining, and large metal storage tanks behind the house were tossed. This home was specifically engineered to be tornado resistant, though close inspection of the foundation revealed that some of the <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt</b> washers were missing, and the ones that were present were slightly too small, preventing a rating higher than EF4. Further to the north, minor EF0 damage occurred near David Jay Perry Airport before the tornado dissipated. Large amounts of debris from this tornado reportedly fell from the sky in Norman.|$|E
