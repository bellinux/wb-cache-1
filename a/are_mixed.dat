5|$|The {{greens are}} mostly verdigris, {{although}} those predominant {{in the landscape}} are mostly blends of blue and yellow pigments, and the green of the cloth worn by Mary Salome is malachite mixed with yellow lake. The browns are blends of reds and blacks. John's red robe is composed from cinnabar and vermilion made from rubia and insect dyes. Some of the reds <b>are</b> <b>mixed</b> with earth colours not susceptible {{to the effects of}} light, and have thus survived close to their original appearance. The black pigments are generally bone blacks but in places from charcoal. The blacks <b>are</b> <b>mixed</b> with chalk in areas, producing a red to brownish 'earthy' appearance.|$|E

5|$|Hummus is {{a staple}} in Palestinian side dishes, in {{particular}} in hummus bi tahini, in which boiled, ground beans <b>are</b> <b>mixed</b> with tahini (sesame paste) and sometimes lemon juice. Hummus is often slathered in olive oil and sometimes sprinkled with paprika, oregano and pine nuts; the latter are especially popular in the West Bank. Chick peas are also mixed with ful (fava beans), resulting {{in an entirely different}} dish, mukhluta, with a distinct flavor and brownish color.|$|E
5|$|In December 2003 the Environment Agency granted {{permission}} {{for the plant}} to co-fire biomass fuels in the station. Since 2004 three different types of biomass fuel been in use at Lynemouth; Sawdust and Wood pellets from FSC certified forests and Olive residues. These fuels <b>are</b> <b>mixed</b> with the coal on the conveyor belt into the power station. In 2004 11,000 tonnes of biomass fuel {{were used in the}} station. Biomass conversion ambitions have increased, with the site currently aiming to be 100% biomass fired from 2015.|$|E
5|$|In Italy, the {{disconnect}} with local production {{has had an}} adverse effect on quality; for example, in the 1990s, some of the dried porcino mushrooms exported to Italy from China contained species of genus Tylopilus, which are rather similar in appearance, and when dried, are difficult for both mushroom labourers and mycologists alike to distinguish from Boletus. Tylopilus species typically have a very bitter taste, a bitterness that is imparted to the flavour of the porcini with which they <b>are</b> <b>mixed.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{industrial}} {{extraction of}} rhodium is complex because the ores <b>are</b> <b>mixed</b> with other metals such as palladium, silver, platinum, and gold {{and there are}} very few rhodium-bearing minerals. It is found in platinum ores and extracted as a white inert metal that is difficult to fuse. Principal sources are located in South Africa; in river sands of the Ural Mountains; and in North America, including the copper-nickel sulfide mining area of the Sudbury, Ontario, region. Although the quantity at Sudbury is very small, the large amount of processed nickel ore makes rhodium recovery cost-effective.|$|E

5|$|Upper {{secondary}} education or framhaldsskóli (lit. “continued school”), follows lower {{secondary education}}. These schools are {{also known as}} gymnasia in English. It is not compulsory, but everyone who has had their compulsory education {{has the right to}} upper secondary education. The typical course length is four years, for students aged between 16 and 20. The length of the course can vary, especially in vocational courses. This stage of education is governed by the Upper Secondary School Act of 2007. Like all other schools in Iceland, upper secondary schools <b>are</b> <b>mixed</b> sex.|$|E
5|$|After {{a player}} makes the first baza, that player {{is allowed to}} {{announce}} declarations. Declaring is allowed until the last two cards are left in the stock (the last faced-down card, and the faced-up trump below it). After these final two cards are picked up, all of the cards the players hold must be played in order to finish the round. When the round is over, the players start to count their scores (see Scoring below). After the counting ends, and their scores are calculated, the cards in the bazas <b>are</b> <b>mixed</b> again in a single stock to be dealt {{at the start of}} the next round.|$|E

40|$|The natural {{invertible}} extension T* of an Nd-action T {{has been}} studied by Lacroix. He showed that T* may fail to <b>be</b> <b>mixing</b> even if T <b>is</b> <b>mixing</b> for d ³ 2. We extend this observation by showing that if T <b>is</b> <b>mixing</b> on (k+ 1) sets then T* <b>is</b> in general <b>mixing</b> on no more than k sets, simply because Nd has a corner. Several examples are constructed when d = 2 : (i) a mixing T for which T*(n,m) has an identity factor whenever n·m < 0; (ii) a mixing T for which T* is rigid but T*(n,m) <b>is</b> <b>mixing</b> for all (n,m) ¹ (0, 0); (iii) a T mixing on 3 sets for which T* <b>is</b> not <b>mixing</b> on 3 sets...|$|R
5|$|Bacteria {{used for}} {{biological}} control infect insects via their digestive tracts, so they offer only limited options for controlling insects with sucking mouth parts such as aphids and scale insects. Bacillus thuringiensis {{is the most}} widely applied species of bacteria used for biological control, with at least four sub-species used against Lepidopteran (moth, butterfly), Coleopteran (beetle) and Dipteran (true fly) insect pests. The bacterium is available to organic farmers in sachets of dried spores which <b>are</b> <b>mixed</b> with water and sprayed onto vulnerable plants such as brassicas and fruit trees. Genes from B. thuringiensis have also been incorporated into transgenic crops, making the plants express some of the bacterium's toxins, which are proteins. These confer resistance to insect pests and thus reduce the necessity for pesticide use. If pests develop resistance to the toxins in these crops, B. thuringiensis will become useless in organic farming also.|$|E
5|$|Compulsory {{education}} {{is divided into}} ten years. Schools which have all ten years, year one to seven, and years eight to ten are common. Those schools which teach from years eight to ten often have a wider catchment area. The size of institutions is widely varied. In the Reykjavík urban area, schools can be up to 1200 pupils in size. In rural areas, schools can have fewer than 10 pupils, and around 50% of schools have fewer than 100 pupils. All compulsory education institutions <b>are</b> <b>mixed</b> sex. Many counselling services are available, including help with studies and specific subjects; psychological counselling is also available.|$|E
5|$|Gojira play a {{technical}} and rhythmic style of heavy metal with precision drumming along with blast beats, unusual rhythm patterns, and start-and-stop riffs. Gojira {{have also been}} known to incorporate textured atmospheric elements and instrumental songs into their music. Gojira songs have progressive and uncommon song structures, rarely using the standard verse-chorus songwriting. The vocal style is varied, using the screamed style often employed in extreme metal, with the death growl style predominantly used in death metal, in addition to clean vocals and higher screams. At times, death metal growls and clean vocals <b>are</b> <b>mixed</b> to create an aggressive but melodic effect.|$|E

5|$|Historians' {{opinions}} {{on the outcome of}} the battle <b>are</b> <b>mixed,</b> with some citing the withdrawal of Tegetthoff's ships, and the greater damage they sustained, as evidence of a tactical victory for Suenson. Other naval historians cite the lifting of the blockade as a strategic victory for the Austrians and Prussians, and others still describe the battle as inconclusive. The Battle of Heligoland was the last naval battle fought by squadrons of wooden ships, and it was also the last time Danish warships fought a major action. Jylland is preserved in Ebeltoft, the last surviving wooden-hulled, screw-driven warship.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, fuel {{flows through}} the main fuel valve into {{regenerative}} cooling systems for the nozzle and MCC, or through the chamber coolant valve. Fuel passing through the MCC cooling system then passes back through the LPFTP turbine before being routed either to the fuel tank pressurization system or to the hot gas manifold cooling system (from where it passes into the MCC). Fuel in the nozzle cooling and chamber coolant valve systems is then sent via pre-burners into the HPFTP turbine and HPOTP before being reunited again in the hot gas manifold, from where it passes into the MCC injectors. Once in the injectors, the propellants <b>are</b> <b>mixed</b> and injected into the main combustion chamber where they are ignited. The burning propellant mixture is then ejected through the throat and bell of the engine's nozzle, the pressure of which creates the thrust.|$|E
