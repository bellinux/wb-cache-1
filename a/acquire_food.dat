25|$|Early {{settlers}} to {{the region}} were hunter-gatherer tribes {{similar to those in}} North Alabama. A variety of Native American populations visited the area that would become Daphne including Tensaw, Choctaw, Creek and Seminole. This area {{came to be known as}} neutral ground where tribes would meet and discuss the relationships between their nations. Small groups worked together to <b>acquire</b> <b>food</b> and to provide for their families. Initially, these groups enjoyed an economy based upon hunting and scavenging but as time passed production of weapons and pottery became more advanced. During the late Woodland stage Native Americans began to practice more elaborate ritual services. Although no burial grounds are known in Daphne, they are scattered throughout nearby Baldwin County.|$|E
25|$|Food {{distribution}} {{involves the}} storage, processing, transport, packaging, {{and marketing of}} food. Food-chain infrastructure and storage technologies on farms can also affect {{the amount of food}} wasted in the distribution process. Poor transport infrastructure can increase the price of supplying water and fertilizer as well as the price of moving food to national and global markets. Around the world, few individuals or households are continuously self-reliant for food. This creates the need for a bartering, exchange, or cash economy to <b>acquire</b> <b>food.</b> The exchange of food requires efficient trading systems and market institutions, which can affect food security. Per capita world food supplies are more than adequate to provide food security to all, and thus food accessibility is a greater barrier to achieving food security.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{described}} the prevalence {{and characteristics of}} financial difficulty <b>acquiring</b> <b>food</b> {{and its relation to}} nutritional biomarkers in older disabled women. METHODS: Baseline data were analyzed from the Women's Health and Aging Study, a population-based survey of 1002 community-dwelling, disabled women 65 years and older from Baltimore, Md. RESULTS: Minority women (49. 5 %) were more likely than White women (13. 4 %) to report financial difficulty <b>acquiring</b> <b>food</b> (odds ratio [OR] = 6. 2, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 4. 5, 8. 6). Of the women reporting financial difficulty <b>acquiring</b> <b>food,</b> only 19. 3 % received food stamps and fewer than 7 % participated in food assistance programs. Women reporting financial difficulty <b>acquiring</b> <b>food</b> had higher levels of psychologic depression than women not reporting such difficulty. Greater likelihood of financial difficulty <b>acquiring</b> <b>food</b> was associated with poorer quality of life and physical performance among White women and with more medical conditions among minority women. Finally, anemia (hemoglobin < 120 g/L) was associated with financial difficulty <b>acquiring</b> <b>food</b> (age-adjusted OR = 2. 9, 95 % CI = 1. 9, 4. 3). CONCLUSIONS: Financial difficulty <b>acquiring</b> <b>food</b> was common, and receipt of nutritional services was rare, in community-dwelling, older disabled women. Nutrition assistance programs for the elderly should reexamine their effectiveness in preventing nutritional deficits in older disabled women...|$|R

25|$|The {{emergence}} of cooking in early Homo may have created problems of food theft from women while food was being cooked. As a result, females would recruit male partners {{to protect them}} and their resources from others. This concept, known as the theft hypothesis, accommodates an explanation {{as to why the}} labor of cooking is strongly associated with the status of women. Women are forced to gather and cook foods because they will not <b>acquire</b> <b>food</b> otherwise and access to resources is critical for their reproductive success. On the contrary, men do not gather because their physical dominance allows them to scrounge cooked foods from women. Thus, women's foraging and food preparation efforts allow men to participate in the high-risk, high-reward activities of hunting. Females, in turn, become increasingly sexually attractive as a means to exploit male interest in investing in her protection.|$|E
25|$|This classic {{theory of}} natural {{selection}} positing a difference in male and female reproductive strategies has recently been reexamined, with an alternate theory being proposed that promiscuity was encouraged among women and men alike, causing uncertainty among males of the paternity of their offspring, allowing for group cooperation in raising all offspring due {{to the possibility that}} any child could be the descendant of a male, similar to observations of the closest relative of humans, the bonobo. Moreover, recent archaeological research done by the anthropologist and archaeologist Steven Kuhn from the University of Arizona suggests that the sexual division of labor did not exist prior to the Upper Paleolithic (50,000 and 10,000 years ago) and developed relatively recently in human history. The sexual division of labor may have arisen to allow humans to <b>acquire</b> <b>food</b> and other resources more efficiently.|$|E

However, in 1316 Flanders was ravaged by famine, and Count Robert allowed Crabbe to return, and {{appointed}} him admiral of a fleet of ships with orders to <b>acquire</b> <b>food</b> to alleviate the famine. Crabbe duly seized two ships owned by merchants of Great Yarmouth. In December of that year Crabbe seized another ship, La Bona Navis de la Strode, off the Isle of Thanet. The Bona Navis was carrying a valuable cargo of wine intended for the English market, and the King {{made a series of}} representations concerning Crabbe's plunder of it to Count Robert during the ensuing five years. Count Robert, however, in a letter of 14 November 1317, disavowed knowledge of Crabbe's whereabouts, claiming that he had been banished for murder, but that he would be punished on the wheel if found.|$|E

25|$|On 7 January 1993, Orthodox Christmas Day, 8th Operational Unit Srebrenica, {{a unit of}} the ARBiH {{under the}} command of Naser Orić, {{attacked}} the village of Kravica near Bratunac. 46 Serbs died in the attack: 35 soldiers and 11 civilians. The attack on a holiday was intentional, as the Serbs were unprepared. The Bosniak forces used the Srebrenica safe zone (where no military was allowed) to carry out attacks on Serb villages including Kravica, and then flee back into the safe zone before the VRS could catch them. 119 Serb civilians and 424 Serb soldiers died in Bratunac during the war. Republika Srpska claimed that the ARBiH forces torched Serb homes and massacred civilians. However, this could not be independently verified during the ICTY trials, which concluded that many homes were already previously destroyed and that the siege of Srebrenica caused hunger, forcing Bosniaks to attack nearby Serb villages to <b>acquire</b> <b>food</b> and weapons to survive. In 2006, Orić was found guilty by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) on the charges of not preventing murder of Serbs, but was subsequently acquitted of all charges on appeal.|$|E
25|$|Anthropologists have {{typically}} assumed that in Paleolithic societies, women {{were responsible for}} gathering wild plants and firewood, and men were responsible for hunting and scavenging dead animals. However, analogies to existent hunter-gatherer societies such as the Hadza people and the Aboriginal Austrialians suggest that the sexual division of labor in the Paleolithic was relatively flexible. Men may have participated in gathering plants, firewood and insects, and women may have procured small game animals for consumption and assisted men in driving herds of large game animals (such as woolly mammoths and deer) off cliffs. Additionally, recent research by anthropologist and archaeologist Steven Kuhn from the University of Arizona is argued to support that this division of labor did not exist prior to the Upper Paleolithic and was invented relatively recently in human pre-history. Sexual division of labor may {{have been developed to}} allow humans to <b>acquire</b> <b>food</b> and other resources more efficiently. Possibly there was approximate parity between men and women during the Middle and Upper Paleolithic, and that period may have been the most gender-equal time in human history. Archaeological evidence from art and funerary rituals indicates that a number of individual women enjoyed seemingly high status in their communities, and it is likely that both sexes participated in decision making. The earliest known Paleolithic shaman (BP) was female. Jared Diamond suggests that the status of women declined with the adoption of agriculture because women in farming societies typically have more pregnancies and are expected to do more demanding work than women in hunter-gatherer societies. Like most contemporary hunter-gatherer societies, Paleolithic and the Mesolithic groups probably followed mostly matrilineal and ambilineal descent patterns; patrilineal descent patterns were probably rarer than in the following Neolithic period.|$|E

500|$|Land-based {{units are}} the most {{prevalent}} in gameplay. Villagers {{are the most}} basic units in Age of Empires. Their primary function is to collect resources, cutting down trees for wood, mining for stone and gold, and hunting, foraging, farming, or fishing to <b>acquire</b> <b>food.</b> Villagers can also construct buildings and repair both buildings and naval vessels, and are capable of engaging in hand-to-hand combat when necessary. Priests are non-combat units which can heal allied units or [...] "convert" [...] enemy units (in which case the target unit changes allegiance). Infantry units, such as clubmen, swordsmen, and hoplites use melee combat to attack at short range. Mounted units include chariots, cavalry, and war elephants. Archers, mounted or on foot, attack at range. Siege units are of two types: catapults and ballista. Catapults hurl stones which generate blast damage, affecting all units in a small area, and are especially effective against buildings and groups of units. The ballista is less damaging against buildings and units, but it fires faster and is cheaper than the catapult.|$|E
