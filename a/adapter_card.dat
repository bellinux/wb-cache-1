50|$|Eiconscript was a PostScript {{printing}} solution {{which used}} a laser 'print engine' connected to an intelligent adapter installed inside a PC. The <b>adapter</b> <b>card</b> ran an Eicon developed {{implementation of the}} PostScript language.|$|E
50|$|An Option ROM {{typically}} {{consists of}} firmware {{that is called}} by the system BIOS. For example, an <b>adapter</b> <b>card</b> that controls a boot device might contain firmware {{that is used to}} connect the device to the system once the Option ROM is loaded.|$|E
50|$|The {{operating}} {{system can be}} located on any storage, but is typically installed on a hard disk or solid-state drive. A Live CD represents the concept of running an {{operating system}} directly from a CD. While this is slow compared to storing the operating system on a hard disk drive, it is typically used for installation of operating systems, demonstrations, system recovery, or other special purposes. Large flash memory is currently more expensive than hard disk drives of similar size (as of mid-2014) but are starting to appear in laptop computers because of their low weight, small size and low power requirements. Computer communications involve internal modem <b>cards,</b> modems, network <b>adapter</b> <b>cards,</b> and routers. Common peripherals and <b>adapter</b> <b>cards</b> include headsets, joysticks, microphones, printers, scanners, sound <b>adapter</b> <b>cards</b> (as a separate card rather than located on the motherboard), speakers and webcams.|$|R
50|$|Although Mwave <b>adapter</b> <b>cards</b> were discontinued, a Linux {{driver for}} the PCI-based Mwave in the ThinkPad 600 and 770 models was {{developed}} and released by IBM.|$|R
50|$|The company's {{revenues}} for 1990 reached $18 million. One year later, Madge's revenues nearly doubled, to $34 million. The rise of computer networking, however, {{had only just}} begun. By the following year Madge's revenues would near $100 million. At the end of 1992 the company had managed to increase {{its share of the}} Token Ring market to seven per cent - still minor compared with IBM's 76 per cent share. Until the early 1990s, Madge had been focusing on producing <b>adapter</b> <b>cards,</b> which were fitted to individual computers to connect them to the network. The company's expanding product line soon included the hubs and switching components needed to route data and allow the <b>adapter</b> <b>cards</b> to communicate.|$|R
5000|$|IBM {{recognized}} {{soon after}} the IBM PC's release in 1981 that its five 8-bit [...] "I/O channel" [...] expansion slots (later named Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) by IBM's competitors) were insufficient. An internal IBM publication stated in October 1981 about the number that [...] "In my opinion, {{it could be a}} problem", reporting that others within IBM advised swapping cards if necessary. Virtually every PC required at least a display <b>adapter</b> <b>card</b> and a floppy disk controller card, leaving only three slots available for a parallel printer port card (if the Color Graphics Adapter was used), a serial port card, memory expansion boards, a 3rd-party hard disk controller card, a second display <b>adapter</b> <b>card,</b> or possible other special adapter cards.|$|E
50|$|In computing, the {{expansion}} card, expansion board, <b>adapter</b> <b>card</b> or accessory card, is {{a printed circuit}} board that can be inserted into an electrical connector, or expansion slot on a computer motherboard, backplane or riser card to add functionality to a computer system via {{the expansion}} bus.|$|E
50|$|Mwave Dolphin drivers version 20D and the Stingray {{version of}} the Mwave adapter {{addressed}} some shortcomings of the Dolphin (Stingray added plug and play support), but IBM eventually stopped using the Mwave <b>adapter</b> <b>card</b> in its Aptiva computers and resorted to conventional sound card and modem options.|$|E
5000|$|Because of {{its high}} {{performance}} in calculating XOR values, the Intel 960 processor family {{is often used to}} control higher-end, RAID-capable SCSI disk array host <b>adapter</b> <b>cards</b> as well as Digital Equipment/Compaq/HP's high-end SCSI and DSSI and eventually Fibre Channel HSx series standalone RAID controllers ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{its first}} version, the <b>adapter</b> <b>cards</b> {{consisted}} of half-size PC cards connected to an external desk-seated radio unit of modest dimensions. The second version, launched at Telecom '95, {{consisted of a}} PCMCIA card and a small external radio unit suitable for portable use.|$|R
40|$|A {{collaboration}} between Fermilab and the Institute for High Energy Physics (IHEP), Beijing, {{has developed a}} beam position monitor for the IHEP test beam facility. This telescope is based on 5 stations of silicon strip detectors having a pitch of 60 microns. The total active area of each layer of the detector is about 12 x 10 cm 2. Readout of the strips is provided {{through the use of}} VA 1 ` ASICs mounted on custom hybrid printed circuit boards and interfaced to <b>Adapter</b> <b>Cards</b> via copper-over-kapton flexible circuits. The <b>Adapter</b> <b>Cards</b> amplify and level-shift the signal for input to the Fermilab CAPTAN data acquisition nodes for data readout and channel configuration. These nodes deliver readout and temperature data from triggered events to an analysis computer over gigabit Ethernet links. Comment: Submitted to TWEPP 201...|$|R
50|$|The then-proposed 802.11g {{standard}} was rapidly adopted by consumers starting in January 2003, well before ratification, {{due to the}} desire for higher speeds and reductions in manufacturing costs. By summer 2003, most dual-band 802.11a/b products became dual-band/tri-mode, supporting a and b/g in a single mobile <b>adapter</b> <b>card</b> or access point.|$|E
50|$|Older {{motherboards}} {{must have}} a WAKEUP-LINK header onboard connected to the network card via a special 3-pin cable; however, systems supporting the PCI 2.2 standard and with a PCI 2.2 compliant network <b>adapter</b> <b>card</b> do not usually require a Wake-on-LAN cable as the required standby power is relayed through the PCI bus.|$|E
50|$|StarBand {{offered the}} first {{residential}} two-way satellite Internet {{service in the}} United States market. Launched in November 2000, StarBand began selling the Gilat Satellite Networks SkyBlaster PCI card VSAT. Initially, {{the only way to}} purchase the StarBand system was to purchase a PC with the send/receive <b>adapter</b> <b>card</b> pre-installed as well as hosting software.|$|E

50|$|A {{riser card}} is a board that plugs {{into the system}} board and {{provides}} additional slots for <b>adapter</b> <b>cards.</b> Because it rises above the system board, it enables you to connect additional adapters to the system in an orientation that {{is parallel to the}} system board and save space within the system case.|$|R
50|$|As the {{original}} 3270 series terminals {{were connected to}} the host computer using coaxial cable, emulators required coax <b>adapter</b> <b>cards</b> to be installed in the PC. Today, many emulators communicate with the mainframe computer through the TN3270 variant of the Telnet protocol common on TCP/IP networks including the Internet, so special hardware is no longer required.|$|R
50|$|The {{technology}} enables one physical <b>adapter</b> <b>card</b> {{to appear}} as multiple virtual network interface cards (vNICs) and virtual host bus adapters (vHBAs). Virtual NICs and HBAs function as conventional NICs and HBAs, and {{are designed to be}} compatible with existing operating systems, hypervisors, and applications. To networking resources (LANs and SANs), they appear as normal cards.|$|E
50|$|Although pitched as an “enterprise-class drive”, it won favour {{with the}} PC gaming and enthusiast {{community}} because the drive {{was capable of}} speeds usually found only on more expensive SCSI drives. Adopting the SATA interface meant {{that it could be}} used easily on all modern motherboards with no separate host <b>adapter</b> <b>card.</b> Also, integration was made easier still by the inclusion of a standard 4-pin Molex power connector in addition to the standard SATA power port.|$|E
50|$|A {{standard}} -inch {{headphone jack}} is provided {{on the back}} of the case, and standard stereo computer speakers can be attached there. However, this jack provides only mono sound, and a third-party <b>adapter</b> <b>card</b> is required for stereo, despite the fact that the Ensoniq and virtually all native software produces stereo audio (stereo audio is essentially built into the machine, but has to be de-multiplexed by third-party cards). Applied Engineering's SonicBlaster is one of a few developed cards for this purpose.|$|E

50|$|Metcalfe {{subsequently}} co-founded 3Com in 1979. 3Com {{began making}} Ethernet <b>adapter</b> <b>cards</b> for many early 1980s computer systems, including the DEC LSI-11, DEC VAX-11 and the IBM PC. In the mid-1980s, 3Com branded their Ethernet technology as EtherSeries, while introducing {{a range of}} software and PC-based equipment to provide shared services over a local area network (LAN) using XNS protocols. These protocols were branded EtherShare (for file sharing), EtherPrint (for printing), EtherMail (for email), and Ether-3270 (for IBM host emulation).|$|R
50|$|Malcolm Ware, {{a former}} {{developer}} on Mwave dates the technology {{back to its}} development in an IBM research lab in Zurich, Switzerland in 1979. The first prototype was tested in an IBM PC in 1981. After being utilized in some other <b>adapter</b> <b>cards,</b> Mwave was given its official name and used in IBM's WindSurfer ISA/MCA card. IBM manufactured Mwave hardware for both Microsoft Windows and its own OS/2. Another revision of the technology was used in IBM's newly renamed Aptiva line.|$|R

5000|$|TI made an {{unsuccessful}} effort in 1987 and 1988 to convince games makers such as Nintendo and Sega to write 3D games {{and create a}} new console market. In 1987 TI provided the first demonstration of true real-time 3D games with stereo sound effects on a personal computer (PC), using a small TMS34010 <b>adapter</b> <b>card</b> (called [...] "The Flippy"). The Flippy was designed {{as the basis of}} a game development system for consoles and as a PC gaming card in its own right.|$|E
50|$|Hobbit was marketed in {{the former}} Soviet Union as a {{low-cost}} personal computer solution for basic educational and office business needs, {{in addition to its}} obvious use as a home computer. Schools would buy it for a classroom, interconnecting several machines in a 56K baud network. It was possible to use either another Hobbit or a single IBM PC compatible computer as a master host on the network; a special Hobbit network <b>adapter</b> <b>card</b> by InterCompex was needed for the IBM PC in the latter case.|$|E
50|$|The SD <b>Card</b> <b>Adapter</b> {{plugs into}} the memory card slot. For use with games exhibiting the SD Card logo, such as Animal Forest e+.
