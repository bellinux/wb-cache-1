25|$|The social {{perception}} in medieval communities was generally one of fear, <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>people</b> {{infected with the}} disease {{were thought to be}} unclean, untrustworthy, and morally corrupt. People with leprosy were also often required to wear clothing that identified them as such or carry a bell announcing their presence. Segregation from mainstream society was common. The third Lateran Council of 1179 and a 1346 edict by King Edward expelled lepers from city limits. Because of the moral stigma of the disease, methods of treatment were both physical and spiritual, and leprosariums were established under the purview of the church.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason of}} Pakistan's {{opposition}} to India's {{entry into the}} Organization of Islamic Cooperation {{is due to the}} human rights issues and problems faced by the Kashmiris in the Indian state of Jammu & Kashmir(J). The Muslim world has always supported Pakistan rather than India, however the role of the OIC concerning the Kashmir issue is that India has the largest Muslim minority <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>people</b> have shown desire to join the OIC. While the First Islamic Summit did not have the issue of the Kashmir people, granting the 60 million Muslims living in India membership in the OIC was discussed. While General Yayha Khan of Pakistan did agree, he showed his extreme displeasure at the fact that at induction of Muslim representative Fakhruddin Ali Ahmad, he took a seat, which caused major controversy. Meanwhile, there were Muslims killed in anti-Muslim riots in Ahmedabad. Pakistan rejected this development and demanded the expulsion of India from the summit.|$|E

Masao Tsuzuki was the leading Japanese authority on the biological effects of radiation. He said there were four causes of injury in the bombed cities: heat, blast, primary radiation and radioactive poisonous gas. In a report that was released by Tsuzuki, he answered the question, [...] "What does strong radioactive energy do to the human body?" [...] His answer was, [...] "damage to blood, then hematopoetic organs such as bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes. [...] All are destroyed or damaged severely. Lungs, intestines, liver, kidney etc are affected and their functions disturbed as a result." [...] The damages were rated by severity. People suffering from severe damage were people who were in within a 1km radius of the hypocenter. The severely affected people typically died within a few days, some living as long as two weeks. Moderate damage was seen in people living in a 1–2km. radius from the hypoenter, <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>people</b> would live for 2–6 weeks. Those people living within a 2–4km. radius had slight damage, and which would not cause death, but would cause some health problems during the several months after the exposure.|$|E

60|$|The Stawell {{region is}} not {{productive}} of gold only; it has great vineyards, and produces exceptionally fine wines.

It yields a choice champagne and a fine claret, and its hock took a prize in France {{two or three years}} ago. The champagne is kept in a maze of passages under ground, cut in the rock, to secure it an even temperature during the three-year term required to perfect it. In those vaults I saw 120,000 bottles of champagne.

But their little game does not succeed. Our people are always there ahead of them Sundays, and take up all the room. When the minister gets up to preach, he finds his house full of devout foreigners, each ready and waiting, with his little book in his hand--a morocco-bound Testament, apparently.
