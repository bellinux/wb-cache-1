5|$|After Pantjawarna, Fred Young drew Njoo and {{his wife}} to the newly {{established}} Majestic Film. Deprived of their director and main star, Oriental hired the journalist Sutan Usman Karim to direct their fourth production, Panggilan Darah (Call of Blood). This film, written by Karim and starring Dhalia and Soerip, told of two young orphans {{as they tried to}} eke <b>a</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> Batavia. This film, which debuted in June 1941, prominently featured the cigarette factory Nitisemito, leading the Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran to suggest that it may have paid for the advertisement. He records it as a modest success, although he notes that reviews were mixed.|$|E
5|$|Middlesex {{has several}} allusions to Greek {{classical}} myths; for example, the protagonist {{is named after}} Calliope, the muse of heroic poetry. Eugenides was partly inspired by the explorations of hermaphrodism in Greek myths to write the novel about an intersex man. In Middlesex, Cal acts out the story of Hermaphroditus, the Greek deity of bisexuality and effeminacy, while eking out <b>a</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> San Francisco. While narrating, Cal enters his ancestors' thoughts and empathizes with them, an ability possessed by Hermaphroditus. The protagonist compared himself to another mythical figureTiresias, the blind prophet of Thebes; the omniscient seer lived sevenyears as a woman because of a curse.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 1970s, the United Kingdom was in a state of social unrest and {{widespread}} poverty as a result of the ineffective social politics of both Conservative and Labour Party governments during a three-year period of economic recession. As a consequence of deindustrialization, the unemployment rate was exceptionally high, especially among working class youth. It continued to rise in the early 1980s, peaking in February 1983. The discontent of so many people caused social unrest with frequent strikes, and culminated in a series of riots (see 1981 Brixton riot, 1981 Toxteth riots). During this period, the mass of young people, deprived of the prospect of even relatively low-skill jobs that were available to the previous generations, searched for different ways to earn money in the music and entertainment businesses. The explosion of new bands and new musical styles coming from the UK in the late 1970s was a result of their efforts to make <b>a</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> the economic depression that hit the country before the governments of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.|$|E
5|$|Unable to earn <b>a</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> New York {{because of}} the {{performance}} ban, Hope toured with trumpeter Chet Baker in 1957 and then began living in Los Angeles. He soon found other musicians who had been influenced by bebop, including saxophonist Harold Land and bassist Curtis Counce. Hope played with Rollins again, and, in October 1957, recorded another album, The Elmo Hope Quintet Featuring Harold Land. In March of the following year Hope became part of Counce's band, {{and went on to}} record two albums with the bassist. Hope also did some arranging for others around this time, including for Land's 1958 Harold in the Land of Jazz. Hope also had his own band, with personnel that varied, and in 1959 he played with Lionel Hampton in Hollywood. Later that year, after performances in San Francisco with two quartets – the first containing Rollins, bassist Scott LaFaro, and drummer Lenny McBrowne; the other with Rollins replaced by Land – Hope travelled north with the Land group to play at a venue in Vancouver.|$|E
