50|$|By {{sampling}} {{the complex}} {{voltage and current}} {{at the point of}} insertion, an SWR meter is able to compute the effective forward <b>and</b> <b>reflected</b> voltages on the transmission line for the characteristic impedance for which the SWR meter has been designed. Since the forward <b>and</b> <b>reflected</b> power is related to the square of the forward <b>and</b> <b>reflected</b> voltages, some SWR meters also display the forward <b>and</b> <b>reflected</b> power.|$|R

40|$|A {{technique}} {{to resolve the}} incident <b>and</b> <b>reflected</b> waves from the records of composite waves is presented. It is applicable to both regular and irregular trains of waves. Two simultaneous wave records are taken at adjacent locations, and all the ampli-tudes of Fourier components are analyzed by the FFT technique. The amplitudes of incident <b>and</b> <b>reflected</b> wave components are estimated from the Fourier components, and the incident <b>and</b> <b>reflected</b> wave spectra are constructed by smoothing the estimated periodograms. The wave resolution is effective in the range outside {{the condition of the}} gauge spacing being even integer of half wavelength. The ratio of incident <b>and</b> <b>reflected</b> wave energies in the effective resolution range is employed in estimating the overall reflection coefficient. The incident <b>and</b> <b>reflected</b> wave heights are estimated from the composite wave heights by energy consideration...|$|R
5|$|Given the {{repeated}} failures and frustrations of workers' revolutions and movements, Marx {{also sought to}} understand capitalism and {{spent a great deal}} of time in the reading room of the British Museum studying <b>and</b> <b>reflecting</b> on the works of political economists and on economic data. By 1857, Marx had accumulated over 800 pages of notes and short essays on capital, landed property, wage labour, the state and foreign trade and the world market, though this work did not appear in print until 1939 under the title Outlines of the Critique of Political Economy.|$|E

Like Mary, his body is shown frontally, his head in three quarters view. He reaches for what seems to be a parrot perched on her lap. At some point the Child's nudity was covered up; this overpaint was removed during a late 20th-century restoration. He is intended to represent both the host and Eucharist, common allusions in Early Netherlandish art <b>and</b> <b>reflecting</b> that the panel was intended for the celebration of mass.|$|E

5|$|The novel deals {{explicitly}} {{with the}} contemporary act of recovering {{the memory of}} WWI, and compiling contemporary understanding of those narratives—a function common to works of historiographic metafiction, like Pat Barker's Regeneration Trilogy, A.S. Byatt's Possession, and Ian McEwan's Atonement. The literary scholar Jerome de Groot calls Birdsong {{one of the first}} novels of its kind, creating a trend in the 1990s of literary fiction rethinking <b>and</b> <b>reflecting</b> on the World Wars and their historical legacy.|$|E
5|$|The novel's {{representations}} of social stratification {{are specific to}} Paris, perhaps the most densely populated city in Europe at the time. Traveling only a few blocks– as Rastignac does continually– takes the reader into vastly different worlds, distinguished by their architecture <b>and</b> <b>reflecting</b> the class of their inhabitants. Paris in the post-Napoleonic era was split into distinct neighborhoods. Three of these are featured prominently in Le Père Goriot: the aristocratic area around the Boulevard Saint-Germain, the newly upscale quarter of the rue de la Chaussée-d'Antin, and the run-down area on the eastern slope of the Montagne Sainte-Geneviève.|$|E

With the help of computers, the extras were multiplied to create a crowd of several hundred thousand people.|$|E

5|$|In the Hanzhong community, {{everyone}} {{was regarded as}} ill in some way. This was because sin caused qi to leave the body, and qi was necessary for life. In order to cure any illness, repentance was a crucial factor in ensuring {{that the loss of}} qi could be staunched. Repentance could be accomplished by spending time in a 'Chamber of Silence,' <b>and</b> <b>reflecting</b> on one's sins, or by beating one's breasts and kowtowing to heaven. Illness could be cured in other ways as well, such as using medicinal herbs and by listening to ritual music. Eating very little was also of extreme importance, and an ideal diet would consist of no food at all, but only of noncorporeal things such as air, which the person could absorb through meditation.|$|E
5|$|The {{final season}} {{of work in}} 1843 was spent in fitting out the interior. By then Alan had become chief {{engineer}} to the NLB and the final work was undertaken {{under the supervision of}} his brother Thomas. The light, which had eight lenses revolving around a four wick lamp with pyramidal lenses above <b>and</b> <b>reflecting</b> prisms below each one, was constructed by John Milne of Edinburgh. The machinery was ready by the beginning of 1844, but it was seven weeks before a landing could be undertaken on the rock. The lamp was finally lit on 1 February and it shone without interruption for the next 110years.|$|E
5|$|The {{new church}} {{is not a}} typical example of the Perpendicular form of Gothic architecture; the low aisles and nave arcades and the very tall {{clerestory}} present the opposite balance to that which was usual in perpendicular churches. As this building was {{to serve as a}} monastic church, it was built to a cruciform plan, which had become relatively rare in parish churches of the time. The interior contains fine fan vaulting by Robert and William Vertue, who designed similar vaulting for the Henry VII chapel, at Westminster Abbey. The building has 52 windows, occupying about 80% of the wall space, giving the interior an impression of lightness, <b>and</b> <b>reflecting</b> the different attitudes towards churchmanship shown by the clergy of the time and those of the 12th century.|$|E

5|$|Three sources {{report in}} some detail on the events {{before and during the}} battle, all of them drawing on {{first-hand}} Catalan accounts <b>and</b> <b>reflecting</b> the Catalan point of view: the near-contemporary chronicle of Ramon Muntaner, the Catalan version of the Chronicle of the Morea, and the account found {{in the history of the}} Byzantine writer Nikephoros Gregoras (ca. 1359). According to the Chronicle of the Morea, the Catalan army comprised 2,000 cavalry and 4,000 infantry, at least 1,100 of whom were Turkish prisoners captured during their previous campaigns, and whose skill as archers they had come to value. Many of these Turks had even converted to Christianity. The sources differ on the size of Walter's army: Gregoras reports 6,400 cavalry and 8,000 infantry, the Aragonese version of the Chronicle of the Morea puts it at more than 2,000 cavalry and 4,000 infantry, while Ramon Muntaner asserts that it comprised 700 knights and 24,000 infantry, mostly native Greeks. Modern scholars consider these numbers to be clearly exaggerated, but they do suggest that the Athenian army had numerical superiority over the Catalans.|$|E
