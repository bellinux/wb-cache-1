5|$|The {{wide variety}} of birds in Basse Casamance was noted by early explorers. While Basse Casamance National Park and Kalissaye Avifaunal Reserve have not been open for years due to the Casamance Conflict, Carabane {{has been found to}} be very conducive to ornithological observation. A study in 1998 {{discovered}} the following species on the island: African darter (<b>Anhinga</b> <b>rufa),</b> Goliath heron (Ardea goliath), palm-nut vulture (Gypohierax angolensis), black-tailed godwit (Limosa limosa), whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus), Eurasian curlew (Numenius arquata), Caspian tern (Sterna caspia), blue-spotted wood-dove (Turtur afer), red-eyed dove (Streptopelia semitorquata), white-rumped swift (Apus caffer), woodland kingfisher (Halcyon senegalensis), grey-backed camaroptera (Camaroptera brachyura), red-bellied paradise-flycatcher (Terpsiphone rufiventer), pied crow (Corvus albus), black-rumped waxbill (Estrilda troglodytres) and yellow-fronted canary (Serinus mozambicus).|$|E

50|$|He was a {{founding}} member of the Société de géographie de Lyon (1873) and the Société préhistorique française (1904). He was also a member of the Société géologique de France (from 1867) and the Société linnéenne de Lyon (from 1885). In 1882 the African darter subspecies, <b>Anhinga</b> <b>rufa</b> chantrei was named in his honour by ornithologist Émile Oustalet.|$|E
50|$|The Oriental darter is {{a member}} of the darter family, Anhingidae, and is closely related to American (Anhinga anhinga), African (<b>Anhinga</b> <b>rufa,</b> with vulsini of Madagascar as a subspecies), and Australasian (Anhinga novaehollandiae) darters. These were for {{sometime}} treated as subspecies of Anhinga melanogaster. The Oriental darter differs in appearance from American darters most recognisably by its white lateral neck stripe.|$|E
50|$|It was {{feared that}} the Levant darter (<b>Anhinga</b> <b>rufa</b> chantrei), a {{subspecies}} of the African darter, and the maxwelli subspecies of the smooth-coated otter had disappeared entirely, but small and threatened populations remain of both.

50|$|John Gould {{described}} the Australasian darter as Plotus novaehollandiae in 1847. Closely related to American (Anhinga anhinga), African (<b>Anhinga</b> <b>rufa),</b> and Oriental (Anhinga melanogaster) darters, the Australasian darter has been classed as a subspecies of the African or African plus Oriental darters. All four {{have also been}} classed as a single species. Examination of the leg bones indicates the three Old World species are {{more closely related to}} each other with the American species more divergent. Genetic analysis showed it differed from A. rufa to a degree equivalent to that between other separate species, and shifted consensus to treating the Australasian darter as a separate species.|$|E
50|$|One subspecies, the Levant darter (<b>Anhinga</b> <b>rufa</b> chantrei), {{occurred}} at Lake Amik (Amik Gölü) in south-central Turkey, in Hula valley lake and marshes in northern Israel {{and in the}} Mesopotamian Marshes of the lower Euphrat and Tigris rivers in southern Iraq. The Turkish population disappeared during the 1930s and the Israeli population during Hula drainage in the 1950s. It was feared that it also had disappeared from Iraq, but a small and threatened population remains {{at least in the}} Hawizeh Marshes (part of the Mesopotamian Marshes), which are also home to numerous other waters birds such as little grebe, pygmy cormorant, marbled teal and sacred ibis.|$|E

50|$|Numerous birds including, storks, small wading birds, waterfowl, eagles {{and even}} small swift-flying birds may be snatched. As a whole, birds are quite {{secondary}} prey, rarely comprising more than 10-15% of crocodile’s diets although are taken fairly evenly across all crocodile size ranges excluding juveniles {{of less than}} 1 m. Birds most often taken are African darters (<b>Anhinga</b> <b>rufa)</b> and reed (Microcarbo africanus) and white-breasted cormorants (Phalacrocorax lucidus), followed by various waterfowl, including most breeding geese and ducks in Africa. Slow-swimming pelicans are also frequently vulnerable to crocodiles. Nile crocodile apparently frequently station themselves underneath breeding colonies of darter and cormorants and presumably snatch up fledgling birds as they drop to the water before they can competently escape the saurian, as has been recorded with several other crocodilians.|$|E
50|$|The flood plains are {{especially}} important for the diversity and richness of their avifauna, particularly migrant birds. The rare species lesser adjutant Leptoptilos javanicus and variety of other species inhabit the floodplains. It {{has been estimated that}} around 75 species winter in the swamps of the flood plains. Frequently seen residents are marsh sandpiper Tringa stagnatilis, wood sandpiper T. glareola, Asiatic golden plover Pluvialis dominica, garganey Anas querquedula, osprey Pandion haliaetus, and black-tailed godwit Limosa limosa. Common residents are eastern large egret Egreta alba, cattle egret Bubulcus ibis, Painted stork Ibis leucocephala, pond heron Ardeola grayii, eastern grey heron Ardea cinerea, pheasant-tailed jacana Hydrophasianus chirurgus, purple coot Porphyrio porphyrio, Indian darter <b>Anhinga</b> <b>rufa,</b> little cormorant Phalacrocorax niger, Indian shag P. fuscicollis, Indian cormorant P. carbo sinensis, brahminy kite Haliastur indus, painted snipe Rostratula benghalensis, black-winged stilt Himantopus himantopus, and red-wattled lapwing Vanellus indicus.|$|E
5000|$|The Central Marshes {{stretched}} between Nasiriyah, Al-'Uzair (Ezra's Tomb) and Al-Qurnah {{and were}} mainly {{fed by the}} Tigris and its distributaries (the Shatt al-Muminah and Majar al-Kabir). They were drained by the (partially artificial) Prosperity Canal, and by the Glory River. The Central Marshes were characterised by tall qasab reeds but included a number of freshwater lakes, of which the largest were the Haur az-Zikri and Umm al-Binni (literally [...] "mother of binni", the latter being a species of barbel.) The marshes support breeding populations of the Basra reed-warbler and marbled teal, along with several other species of non-breeding birds. [...] It was feared that the Levant darter (<b>Anhinga</b> <b>rufa</b> chantrei), a subspecies of the African darter, and the maxwelli subspecies of the smooth-coated otter had disappeared entirely, but small and threatened populations remain of both. It is feared that the Bunn's short-tailed bandicoot rat (Nesokia bunnii, syn. Erythronesokia bunnii), which had only been described from specimens obtained in the Central Marshes, is extinct.|$|E

40|$|Per- and polyfluoroalkyl {{substances}} (PFASs) are a {{group of}} toxic and persistent organic compounds. Their properties make them extremely resistant {{and they have been}} shown to have bioaccumulation and toxic properties in the environment and also to biomagnify in both aquatic and terrestrial food webs. This study has analysed different PFASs in African Darter (<b>Anhinga</b> <b>rufa)</b> eggs from five sites along Vaal River; Orange River, South Africa. Sixteen of 23 analysed PFASs were detected and quantified, and the homologue profiles were studied from all five sites. Total perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) (all structural isomers) was the predominated compound of all PFASs, accounting for 88 - 98 % for all sites, with a median concentration range of 58 ng/g ww to 2473 ng/g ww. The second highest concentration was found for perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA) (1. 9 - 42 ng/g ww), followed by perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) (1. 1 - 14 ng/g ww) and perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) (0. 68 - 6. 0 ng/g ww). The results showed significantly that the three up-stream sites (Welverdiend, Schoemansdrift and Orkney East) had similar patterns and that eggs from Schoemansdrift had the highest levels of PFASs. This may indicate the same source of origin for these three sites and that Schoemansdrift are closest to the contamination source. The three sites (Welverdiend, Schoemansdrift and Orkney East) with similar pattern is closest to Gauteng, which can be where the emission source is located, because it is an industrial area. Perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) and PFOS might originate from different sources and the source for PFCAs could be degradation of fluorotelomer-based precursors. Structural isomer profiles of PFOS showed similar results as the PFAS homologue patterns, which give further indication of the source of origin. The contribution of linear PFOS (L-PFOS) to the total amount of PFOS was between the range of 94 and 97 %. Bloemhof had the highest concentration of branched isomers among all sites. The L-PFOS concentrations in Bloemhof were also significantly differ from Schoemansdrift. This indicate two different sources between Bloemhof and the three up-steam sites, or an effect of environmental fractionation...|$|E
