5|$|After being {{withdrawn}} back to Australia in March 1944, {{the units}} of the 7th Division received six weeks' leave before reforming on the Atherton Tablelands in Queensland. Following this the 2/14th Battalion undertook a period of training before finally being committed to their last campaign {{of the war in}} mid-1945. This campaign saw them take part in the amphibious landings at Balikpapan on 1 July 1945. During the initial landings early on 1 July, the 2/14th came ashore at the wrong place, landing at Yellow Beach when it had been scheduled to land <b>at</b> <b>Green</b> Beach. Nevertheless, the landing was largely unopposed and after 45 minutes of reorganisation the Australians were able to establish themselves at their correct form up point and begin the advance to their first objective: the bridge over the Klandasan Besar. Advancing unopposed they crossed the bridge and at nightfall dug-in in front of the Stalkudo ridge, along the Vasey Highway. The following day, the battalion captured the Sepinggang airstrip as the 21st Brigade began the advance to the east. The 2/27th Battalion subsequently relieved the 2/14th at Sepinggang and on 3 July, the battalion began to move towards the Manggar airstrip. The 21st Brigade then came up against stronger opposition near the Batakan Ketjil River, which held them up until the evening.|$|E
