However, this appears to be limited to brand extensions that contain high quality ingredient brands extended into product categories more similar to the parent category. Findings also indicate that the effectiveness of <b>a</b> branded <b>ingredient</b> strategy can vary by product category and, in some cases, be detrimental to interest in the new product or to perceptions of its overall quality. ...|$|R
