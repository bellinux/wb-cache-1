5|$|After 1912 thirty-one M7 {{locomotives}} were {{equipped with}} push-pull train capabilities with {{the provision of}} a primitive cable and pulley device. This was <b>a</b> <b>modification</b> {{that was designed to}} save time on country branch lines where the locomotive would usually have to run around its train {{in order to make a}} return journey. As a result, it was possible for the driver to drive his train from a cab located at the front of a designated push-pull coach, leaving the fireman to tend the fire and operate the injectors on the locomotive footplate.|$|E
5|$|If a continuous-time real-valued {{stochastic}} process meets certain moment conditions on its increments, then the Kolmogorov continuity theorem {{says that there}} exists <b>a</b> <b>modification</b> of this process that has continuous sample paths with probability one, so the {{stochastic process}} has a continuous modification or version. The theorem can also be generalized to random fields so the index set is -dimensional Euclidean space {{as well as to}} stochastic processes with metric spaces as their state spaces.|$|E
40|$|The role of m 6 A {{methylation}} of RNA {{has remained}} elusive for decades, however recent technological advances are now allowing the mapping of the m 6 A methylation landscape at nucleotide level. This has spurred {{an explosion in}} our understanding of the role played by RNA epigenetics in RNA biology. m 6 <b>A</b> <b>modifications</b> have been tied to almost every aspects of the mRNA life cycle and {{it is now clear that}} RNA virus genomes are subject to m 6 <b>A</b> methylation.

The Australia Council gave the developers AUD $25,000, intended to get the game developed {{to the point that it}} could secure funding from other sources. While a playable section of the game was developed, the developers never received additional funding.

5|$|NSB El 18 is a {{class of}} 22 {{electric}} locomotives built by Adtranz and Swiss Locomotive and Machine Works (SLM) for the Norwegian State Railways (NSB). The class is <b>a</b> <b>modification</b> of the Swiss Federal Railways Re 460 locomotive and built at Adtranz Strømmen in 1996 and 1997. The class remains the only mainline electric locomotive used by NSB, and is predominantly used on some intercity services and all night trains on the Bergen Line, Dovre Line and Sørland Line, {{as well as some}} regional trains.|$|E

5|$|Reversion is {{a serious}} disease {{transmitted}} by the blackcurrant gall mite Cecidophyopsis ribis. It causes a decline in yield and is quite widespread in Europe but is rarely encountered on other continents. Symptoms include <b>a</b> <b>modification</b> of leaf shape in summer and swollen buds ("big bud") in winter, each housing thousands of microscopic mites. As pest control has limited effectiveness, severely infected bushes should be destroyed. All new plants purchased should be certified as virus-free.|$|E
5|$|SMS Prinz Heinrich {{was built}} at the Imperial Dockyard in Kiel. She was laid down in 1898 and {{completed}} in March 1902 {{at a cost of}} 16,588,000 Marks. Prinz Heinrichs design was <b>a</b> <b>modification</b> of Fürst Bismarck, and traded a smaller main battery for higher speed and more comprehensive armor protection. The ship set a precedent for subsequent German armored cruisers by concentrating her secondary armament amidships, as opposed to Fürst Bismarck, which spread the secondary armament {{along the length of the}} ship.|$|E

5|$|The {{status was}} {{introduced}} by the Education Act 1944 as <b>a</b> <b>modification</b> of an existing direct grant scheme to privately endowed schools. There were 179 direct grant grammar schools, which, together with over 1,200 grammar schools maintained by local authorities, formed the most academic tier of the Tripartite System. They varied greatly in size and composition, but, on average, achieved higher academic results than either maintained grammar schools or independent schools.|$|E
5|$|Wang's student Robert Berger {{proved that}} the Domino Problem was {{undecidable}} (so Wang's conjecture was incorrect) in his 1964 thesis, and obtained an aperiodic set of 20426 Wang dominoes. He also described a reduction to 104 such prototiles; the latter did not appear in his published monograph, but in 1968, Donald Knuth detailed <b>a</b> <b>modification</b> of Berger's set requiring only 92 dominoes.|$|E
5|$|As with {{previous}} Star Trek films, existing props and footage were reused where possible to save money, though The Voyage Home required less of this than previous films. The Earth Spacedock interiors and control booth sets were reused from The Search for Spock, although the computer monitors in these scenes featured new graphics—the old reels had deteriorated in storage. Stock {{footage of the}} destruction of the Enterprise and the Bird-of-Prey's movement through space were reused. While the Bird-of-Prey bridge was a completely new design, other parts of the craft's interior were also redresses; the computer room was <b>a</b> <b>modification</b> of the reactor room where Spock died in The Wrath of Khan. After all other Bird-of-Prey bridge scenes were completed, the entire set was painted white for one shot that transitioned into a dream sequence during the time travel.|$|E

5|$|Before the Croatian War of Independence Velebit {{served with}} the 88th Submarine Flotilla of the Yugoslav Navy {{entering}} service during the late 1980s. Velebit, then named Soča, was like other Una-class submarines, named after rivers in Yugoslavia. In 1991, it was being overhauled in Brodogradilište specijalnih objekata {{until the beginning of}} the war, when Croatian forces captured it. In 1993, Brodarski Institut (BI) of Zagreb started <b>a</b> <b>modification</b> program to improve the operational capabilities of the submarine captured two years earlier. The hull was lengthend to create space needed for the installation of a single MTU 105kW diesel generator, a feature the original Una-class design lacked. A new steering system developed by BI was also installed.|$|E

Since 2003, Chelsea have been owned by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich.

5|$|Construction {{work began}} in August 1898, {{although}} the BS was continuing {{to develop new}} route plans. The bill for 1899, published on 22 November 1898, requested more time for the construction works and proposed two extensions to the railway and <b>a</b> <b>modification</b> to part of the previously approved route. The first extension, like the NC's plan from the year before, was to branch from the already-approved route under Park Crescent, but then followed a more northerly route than the NC, running under Regent's Park to cross the park's Outer Circle between Chester Road and Cumberland Gate where a station was to be constructed. The route then followed Cumberland Street West (now Nash Street), Cumberland Market, Cumberland Street East and Edward Street (both now Varndell Street), before ending at a station under Cardington Street {{on the west side}} of Euston station.|$|E
