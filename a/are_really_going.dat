Her last one never came out because it was collecting hamburgers, like fast food. One from McDonald's, one from Burger King, and so on. It tasted good, but it wasn't consistent. Her new record– people <b>are</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> to go crazy about it because it's the real her."

It earned $323.4 million worldwide, becoming the second highest-grossing film based on an animated television show, behind The Simpsons Movie (2007).|$|E

Sean explains why chose {{this to be the}} title, stating that [...] "its because it'll represent who he is". He then said that he feels [...] "like situations <b>are</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> to be relatable to people." [...] He then stated that he [...] "didn't want to just do another club song", and he didn't even wanted to follow these popular music standards. [...] "This is just what the fuck I want to do. Some people are going to like it. Some people are going to hate it; regardless, I'm just doing me." [...] Sean then said that Hall of Fame will be a far more inspirational and a more conceptually-driven project than his debut album. He even went on by saying the fact that he wants to teach, while making his lasting impact on peoples' lives with this second album. During an interview with Power 105, Sean stated that he would include some skits on the album to give it a [...] "classic feel".

500|$|Showrunner and episode writer Steven Moffat {{wanted the}} episode to be [...] "big" [...] {{and say that}} [...] "we are turning {{it up to a}} level, we <b>are</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> mad with it". Atmospheric {{lighting}} was added by director of photography Stephan Pehrsson, who wanted to give it a movie feel. Moffat chose Stonehenge as the primary location for the episode because the monument was large and important enough to be suitable for the fall of someone as powerful as the Doctor. Filming was done at the real Stonehenge in Wiltshire on the night of 2 February 2010. The cast and crew had to abide by regulations; they were not allowed to touch the stones, bring heavy equipment in, and the lighting had to be done from the floor. They could only afford to shoot during one night and spent the only hour of daylight in the morning shooting a three-minute dialogue sequence. This proved to be a challenge, as it typically took {{an hour and a half}} to film similar scenes. The rest of the scenes set at Stonehenge were filmed with a lightweight replica set up in Margam Country Park called [...] "Foamhenge" [...] over four nights. Director Toby Haynes thought that they had [...] "established" [...] Stonehenge at the real site and now could get away with seeing less of it. The Doctor's speech to the alien spaceships was filmed 3 February, while Rory shooting Amy was shot on 4 February. The weather conditions were very cold with wind and rain which caused difficulties as it was hard to communicate over the wind. Haynes wanted the Doctor's speech to be his [...] "big, pop-star moment" [...] and to look as if he was addressing a large site such as Wembley Stadium.|$|E

Sadly {{some of the}} game's signature features, such as the slow-motion focus shooting, are hugely overused and actually drag the game down." [...] He praised Ray's levels but criticized Billy's, especially {{the implementation of the}} whip, and concluded [...] "There are some fun and frantic moments here [...] but overall the level design is a linear letdown." [...] Jonathan Miller scored the Xbox 360 version 7.5 out of 10. He too much preferred Ray's levels, but wrote [...] "Western fans <b>are</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> to enjoy Call of Juarez, a game not afraid to take chances and have fun with itself." [...] He praised the atmosphere, soundtrack, and variety of gameplay styles, concluding [...] "while Call of Juarez isn't particularly great in any [...] area, you have to hand it to Techland for developing one of the most fun Westerns to date." ...|$|E
