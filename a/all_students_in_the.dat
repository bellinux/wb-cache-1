5|$|In 1991, McMaster's School of Medicine adopted {{progress}} testing, {{developing the}} personal progress index (PPI), a {{system based on}} progress testing invented concurrently by the University of Missouri-Kansas City's medical school and the Maastricht University. The PPI is used as an objective method for assessing acquisition and retention of knowledge for students in the medical program. The PPI is administered at regular intervals to <b>all</b> <b>students</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> program, regardless of their level of training, and plots students' scores as they move through the program. Students typically score 20 percent on their first examination, and increase by five to seven percent with each successive examination. Students can monitor the changes in their scores and receive formative feedback based on a standardized score relative to the class mean. Due to the overwhelming success and research supporting {{the use of the}} PPI as an evaluation tool, it is now used in Canada, US, Europe, and Australia.|$|E

The 'local pub' on campus, the revamped Ele house, holds seats, big screen TVs, and pool tables providing a convenient location to socialise. Hertfordshire Students' Union (HSU) is the Students' Union of the University of Hertfordshire. The Students' Union Social Centre was opened in 1977. The Hatfield Technical College's management encouraged {{the establishment of a}} Student Representative Council (SRC) in 1982, {{to create a sense of}} unity and expand the social activities of its day students. The SRC was affiliated to the National Union of Students but initially restricted itself largely to social activities. After 1988 it began to campaign on issues such as improvements to the canteen, lifting the ban on religious or political activity within the then Hatfield Polytechnic, and for a formal students' union. The sectarian ban was finally lifted in 1992 and a Union granted in 1995. However, the canteen continued to be an issue throughout the 2000s. The Students' Union at the University of Hertfordshire represents <b>all</b> <b>students</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> university by organising campus activities and running different clubs and societies, from sports to entertainment.|$|E
