25|$|In {{the second}} half of the 1960s, OKB-240 (as the Ilyushin bureau was {{formally}} known) was restoring positions lost (with Yakovlev, in favour of Tupolev and Antonov) during the Khrushchev era and was well placed to secure design of the <b>aerobus.</b> When the Soviet cabinet's defence industry committee promoted the Aeroflot specification on September 8, 1969 to a preliminary project, (Russian: аванпроект; transliterated: avanproyekt), it entrusted it to Ilyushin. The bureau received specific operational requirements for the <b>aerobus</b> on February 22, 1970.|$|E
25|$|Carris city buses stop at {{the airport}} arrivals section, and connect to Marquis of Pombal Square, and Amoreiras. Night routes run to {{downtown}} Baixa, as well as Cais do Sodré and Gare do Oriente train stations. City buses have a maximum luggage size of 50x40x20cm. Travelers with larger luggage must take the <b>aerobus</b> or airport shuttle.|$|E
25|$|Théodore Clovis Edmond Lemartin, {{known as}} Léon Lemartin (20 October 1883 Dunes, Tarn-et-Garonne – 18 June 1911, Vincennes) {{was a pioneer}} aviator who set a world record on 3 February 1911 at Pau, France when he carried seven {{passengers}} in a Blériot XIII <b>Aerobus.</b> He then took eight, eleven and thirteen passengers aloft the following month.|$|E
25|$|Buses in Barcelona {{are a major}} form {{of public}} transport, with {{extensive}} local, interurban and night bus networks. Most local services are operated by the TMB, although some other services are operated {{by a number of}} private companies, albeit still within the ATM fare structure. A separate private bus line, known as <b>Aerobús,</b> links the airport with the city centre, with its own fare structure.|$|E
25|$|The French {{aviation}} pioneer Louis Blériot {{also established}} a company, Blériot Aéronautique, on the Boulevard Victor-Hugo in Neuilly, where he manufactured the first French airplanes. On 25 July 1909, {{he became the}} first man to fly across the English Channel. Blériot moved his company to Buc, near Versailles, where he established a private airport and a flying school. In 1910, he built the <b>Aérobus,</b> one of the first passenger aircraft, which could carry seven persons, the most of any aircraft of the time.|$|E
25|$|Soon enough {{it becomes}} clear that humans cannot hold the new Wave back and an order to gather the entire {{population}} in the Capital is issued. Robert Sklyarov witnesses the Wave destroying semi-automatic charybdis and tries to pilot one manually to give his friends time to flee. In the end, his charybdis is destroyed, too, but Sklyarov manages to escape and sets off (on a flier) for the Children Village, where his fiancée, Tatiana Turchina, works as a governess. He finds the Village already empty but {{on the way to the}} Capital, he locates a crashed <b>aerobus</b> that was carrying some of the children from the Village as well as Turchina herself. Having to choose whom to take with him (his flier can only carry two people), Sklyarov decides for his fiancée even though he knows that she would hate him for leaving the children behind.|$|E
2500|$|In the mid-1960s, the United States and Western Europe planned airliners seating {{twice the}} then-maximum of some 200 passengers. They {{were known as}} airbuses at the time. The Soviet {{leadership}} wanted to match them with an <b>aerobus</b> (...) [...] Alongside the propaganda motive, the USSR genuinely needed an <b>aerobus.</b> Aeroflot expected over 100 million passengers a year within a decade (the 100th million annual passenger was indeed carried on 29 December 1976.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Many Soviet {{airports}} {{also had}} surfaces too weak for [...] "aerobuses". The Soviet solution again favoured adapting aircraft to existing conditions, rather than reconstructing airports. The <b>aerobus</b> thus had {{to match the}} ground loadings of existing airliners. This called for complex multi-wheel landing gear.|$|E
2500|$|In October 1967, the Soviet {{government}} {{approved a}} Ministry of Civil Aviation (Aeroflot) specification for an <b>aerobus.</b> This called for 350 seats {{and a range}} of 3,600km (1,900nmis) with a 40-tonne payload or 5,800km/3,100nmi with seats taken but no freight. The airliner had to operate from smaller airports (classified as Klass [...] "B" [...] and [...] "V" [...] or [...] "Class B/C" [...] by the Soviets) 2,600m (8,500ft) runways.|$|E
2500|$|Ilyushin {{began work}} on the <b>aerobus</b> in late 1969, {{initially}} by assessing the development potential of existing aircraft. An enlarged Il-62 (the Il-62-250) {{would have had a}} 30-tonne payload, 259 seats and a 6.8 metre/22ft longer fuselage: a virtual analogue of the Douglas DC-8 [...] "Super Sixty" [...] series. Other proposed Il-62 modifications involved double-deck and [...] "two fuselages side-by-side" [...] developments. There was also a project to [...] "civilianise" [...] the Il-76.|$|E
2500|$|In 1912, Méliès {{continued}} making ambitious films, {{most notably}} with the féerie The Conquest of the Pole. Although inspired by such contemporary events as Robert Peary's {{expedition to the}} North Pole in 1909 and Roald Amundsen's expedition to the South Pole in 1911, the film also included such fantastic elements as a griffith-headed <b>aerobus</b> and a snow giant that was operated by twelve stage hands, as well as elements reminiscent of Jules Verne {{and some of the}} same [...] "fantastic voyage" [...] themes as A Trip to the Moon and The Impossible Voyage. Unfortunately, Conquest of the Pole was not profitable, and Pathé decided to exercise its right to edit Méliès's films from then on.|$|E
2500|$|Barcelona {{is served}} by Barcelona-El Prat Airport, about [...] from the centre of Barcelona. It is the second-largest airport in Spain, and the largest on the Mediterranean coast, which handled more than 44.1 million {{passengers}} in 2016, showing an annual upward trend. It is a main hub for Vueling Airlines and Ryanair, and also a focus for Iberia and Air Europa. The airport mainly serves domestic and European destinations, although some airlines offer destinations in Latin America, Asia and the United States. The airport {{is connected to the}} city by highway, metro (Airport T1 and Airport T2 stations), commuter train (Barcelona Airport railway station) and scheduled bus service, e.g. <b>Aerobus.</b> A new terminal (T1) has been built, and entered service on 17 June 2009.|$|E
2500|$|It seems (again {{according}} to Sutter's {{account of the}} aftermath) that this meeting may have made a real difference to Soviet aircraft design, but Boeing's contribution could naturally not be acknowledged publicly by the Soviet side. [...] Ilyushin therefore had to stress {{that it had been}} the first in the world to use podded engines suspended from pylons beneath and ahead of the wing, on the experimental Ilyushin Il-22 four-engined jet bomber of 1946 (first use of this designation). Having thus presented the Il-86's ultimate configuration as indigenously Soviet, the bureau could at last show it in public in 1973, six years after publication of the <b>aerobus</b> specification and four years after the design assignment. A modern six-window flightdeck followed, in place of the 18-to-20 window glazing of the Il-18, Il-62 and Il-76.|$|E
50|$|Their <b>Aerobus</b> {{transports}} {{people and}} goods daily between Aukra and Molde. The company also runs its <b>Aerobus</b> between Molde Lufthavn, the town center and Aukra. The <b>Aerobus</b> has belts on all seats, offers a refrigerating unit and thermo cabinets.|$|E
50|$|<b>Aerobus</b> is a {{self-propelled}} {{electrically powered}} bus-like vehicle riding on a suspended overhead cable. The cable arrangement, {{similar to a}} suspension bridge, allows for long spans of up to 600 metres between pylons. The <b>Aerobus</b> system was invented in the late 1960s by Gerhard Mueller of the GMD Mueller aerial lift company in Switzerland. The patents to <b>Aerobus</b> are currently owned by <b>Aerobus</b> International Ltd. of Houston, Texas, United States.|$|E

50|$|Meant {{primarily}} {{to serve as}} an airport shuttle, as indicated by the name, it is an extended version of the iconic Checker Marathon. From its introduction through the 1964 model year, the <b>Aerobus</b> used Chrysler V8s, but when Checker Motors shifted from Continental to Chevrolet engines for 1965, the <b>Aerobus</b> line followed suit.|$|E
50|$|A {{shuttle bus}} service, <b>Aerobus</b> (199) {{operated}} by ATV, connects Verona-Villafranca Airport directly with Verona Porta Nuova station. This <b>Aerobus</b> runs daily between 6 am and 11 pm and departs every 20 minutes. Journey time takes 20-25 minutes. http://www.aeroportoverona.it/en/aerobus_t2 http://www.atv.verona.it/flex/cm/pages/ServeBLOB.php/L/EN/IDPagina/90?54c8be6e30eed During {{the summer months}} (June to September), ATV (Verona) buses 164, 183 and 184 additionally provide hourly connections between Verona-Villafranca Airport en route to comunes along Lake Garda/Lago di Garda.|$|E
50|$|Checker's {{commercial}} vehicles were usually given letter designations instead of model names (most notably {{variations of the}} Checker Model A). An exception to this rule was the Checker <b>Aerobus,</b> an extended version of its cars, built on a stretched wheelbase allowing for each row of seats {{to have its own}} doors. The <b>Aerobus</b> was often associated with airports and train stations, although vacation resorts also used Aerobuses for transporting guests.|$|E

50|$|Viva <b>Aerobus</b> began {{operating}} in November 2006 with two routes between Monterrey and Tijuana. Nowadays, Viva <b>Aerobus</b> {{offers more than}} 60 routes and in 2013 the airline announced the renewal of its fleet by purchasing 52 Airbus A320 aircraft, becoming the airline with the youngest fleet in Mexico. In addition, {{within the framework of}} the airline's tenth anniversary, Grupo IAMSA acquired a 100% stake in Viva Aerobus; it is now a fully Mexican company.|$|E
50|$|In 2006, Grupo IAMSA, in {{partnership}} with Grupo Irelandia (owner group of the airline Ryanair), founded the low-cost Mexican airline Viva <b>Aerobus.</b>|$|E

50|$|During {{the late}} 1960s and 1970s, Checker sold a few {{specialized}} {{versions of the}} A11. These included the Medicar and the <b>Aerobus.</b> The Medicar was introduced in 1969 and was designed to function as an ambulance, or transporter for wheelchair-bound passengers. The rear doors were large enough to allow a wheelchair to enter the car, and they swung open almost 180 degrees. This car also featured a raised roof, and facilities to lock a wheelchair to the floor when in motion. The <b>Aerobus</b> was a stretched version of the A12W Station Wagon. It accommodated up to 12 passengers and was marketed as an airline shuttle.|$|E
50|$|Following {{the success}} of Viva <b>Aerobus,</b> Grupo IAMSA and Irelandia {{launched}} the airline Viva Colombia in 2012. However, in December 2016, an agreement among the shareholders was established; it Irelandia to buy IAMSA's stake in the airline.|$|E
50|$|The Airport {{is about}} 6 km from Bologna Centrale railway station, {{one of the}} most {{important}} railway stations in Italy. When you arrive at the station, you can reach the Airport by <b>Aerobus</b> - BLQ shuttle service (Travel time: about 20 minutes), or by Taxi.|$|E
5000|$|The Checker <b>Aerobus</b> is an {{automobile}} manufactured {{on two different}} wheelbases by the Checker Motors Corporation from 1962 until 1977 (although none were built in 1975). It was offered as seven- (including the tailgate) or nine-door station wagon, and as a six- or eight-door sedan.|$|E

50|$|At times, a VIA would {{collaborate}} with a well-known solo singer to provide musical backing. Examples include Yury Antonov and VIAs Araks and <b>Aerobus,</b> Alla Pugacheva and VIA Retsital, Sofia Rotaru and VIA Chervona Ruta, Valeriy Obodzinskiy and VIA Verniye Druziya, and Lev Leschenko and VIA Spektr.|$|E
50|$|In a 2008 forum {{discussion}} on long-term transportation plans in Yogyakarta held at Universitas Gadjah Mada, {{the head of}} the Yogyakarta region transportation master plan team, Prof Ahmad Munawar, said that in 2016 modern transport modes including monorail, <b>aerobus,</b> and tram will begin operating in the city and the region.|$|E
5000|$|The early cars used Chrysler's A318 V8 (5.2 L), {{originally}} with 190 hp {{and later}} 200 hp. During 1965, the <b>Aerobus</b> switched to Chevrolet's 5.36 L small-block engine, with [...] at 4,400 rpm. This {{was in a}} lesser state of tune than the 250 hp unit used in the regular Marathons, with lower 8:1 compression and twin rather than quadruple carburetors. Top speed was around 135 km/h. Standard equipment for 1966 included power brakes, windshield washer, and a front stabilizer bar. The rear wheel cutouts were radiused, unlike the sedans. [...] For 1969, the bigger 350 engine (5.7 L) took over, with 200 hp. Output climbed to [...] for 1971, or 155 hp SAE net. By 1974, intended {{to be the last}} year for the <b>Aerobus</b> as Checker ended production of the station wagons, the power was increased to , using a four-barrel carb instead of the two-barrel seen in the Marathons. Available only with an automatic and with standard power steering, top speed for a 1974 is 160 km/h. After none were built in 1975, 107 more eight-door sedans (the only ones built in this configuration) were built in 1976 and 1977. The engine output for 1977 again increased somewhat, to 170 hp. Called the <b>Aerobus</b> 15 since it could seat 15, it did not prove very successful, as luggage space was limited.|$|E
