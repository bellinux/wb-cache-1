2500|$|The Mustang has a MacPherson-strut front {{suspension}} with reverse [...] "L" [...] {{lower control}} arms. The rear suspension {{was a new}} three-link system with a Panhard Rod that controls the vertical and lateral movements of the axle. This live axle rear suspension, while sacrificing handling, provides the benefits of reduced cost and weight over heavier, more expensive independent rear suspensions. In spite of this, Ford has drawn heavy criticism from the automotive journalism community for the decision to equip the 5th generation Mustang with the live <b>axle</b> <b>system.</b> At a press conference, Ford stated that to include an independent rear suspension would have added $5,000 to the showroom price of the car.|$|E

50|$|Pairs of {{tapered roller}} {{bearings}} are used in car and vehicle wheel bearings where they must cope simultaneously with large vertical (radial) and horizontal (axial) forces. Tapered roller bearings are commonly used for moderate speed, heavy duty applications where durability is required. Common real world applications are in agriculture, construction and mining equipment, <b>axle</b> <b>systems,</b> gear box, engine motors and reducers, propeller shaft, railroad axle-box, differential, wind turbines, etc.|$|R
5000|$|The Trans-Asian Railway is {{a project}} to link Singapore to Istanbul and is {{to a large degree}} {{complete}} with missing pieces primarily in Myanmar. The project has also linking corridors to China, the central Asian states, and Russia. This transcontinental line unfortunately uses a number of different gauges, , , [...] and , though this problem may be lessened with the use of variable gauge <b>axle</b> <b>systems</b> such as the SUW 2000.|$|R
5000|$|The Haldex Traction {{system is}} more [...] than preventative, {{in that there}} must be a {{difference}} in slip (or rotational speed) of the two <b>axle</b> <b>systems</b> before the Haldex operates and sends torque to the rear axle. This {{is not the same as}} wheel spin, as the system can react in less than the full rotation of any wheel on the vehicle. The Torsen's permanent 'full-time' even torque split under non-slipping conditions makes slipping less likely to start.|$|R
50|$|The Vanaja lifting tandem <b>axle</b> <b>system</b> {{was adopted}} to Sisu's after the merger. SAT took some {{attempts}} of co-operation with other heavy vehicle producers {{to produce the}} lifting tandem also for other makes, but only few lifting tandems were mounted on Iveco's in the Hämeenlinna factory.|$|E
50|$|International trains change bogies in here, {{because of}} the break-of-gauge between China and Mongolia. China uses the {{standard}} gauge, while Mongolia uses the Russian 1520 mm gauge. The manual bogie exchange is to be supplemented with the faster, automatic Variable gauge <b>axle</b> <b>system</b> of the SUW 2000 type made by ZNTK.|$|E
50|$|There is a {{break of}} gauge where the railway {{systems of the}} two {{countries}} meet. To speed up though traffic, a track gauge changing facility of the SUW 2000 variable gauge <b>axle</b> <b>system</b> has been installed to allow fitted trains to pass through the break of gauge at walking pace.|$|E
50|$|Another form of {{carriage}} was {{the pageant}} wagon of the 14th century. Historians {{debate on the}} structure and size of pageant wagons; however, they are generally miniature house-like structures that rest on four to six wheels {{depending on the size}} of the wagon. The pageant wagon is significant because up until the 14th century most carriages were on two or 3 wheels; the chariot, rocking carriage, and baby carriage are two examples of carriages which pre-date the pageant wagon. Historians also debate whether or not pageant wagons were built with pivotal <b>axle</b> <b>systems,</b> which allowed the wheels to turn. Whether it was a four- or six-wheel pageant wagon, most historians maintain that pivotal <b>axle</b> <b>systems</b> were implemented on pageant wagons because many roads were often winding with some sharp turns. Six wheel pageant wagons also represent another innovation in carriages; they were one of the first carriages to use multiple pivotal axles. Pivotal axles were used on the front set of wheels and the middle set of wheels. This allowed the horse to move freely and steer the carriage in accordance with the road or path.|$|R
50|$|The new rear {{suspension}} was a semi-trailing arm system {{with coil springs}} and lever-arm shocks. This system more closely resembled that of the Triumph 2000 than the swing <b>axle</b> <b>systems</b> used in the Herald or Spitfire. The chassis was redesigned to accommodate the new suspension at the rear, with extensive changes to the side members and cross-bracing. The redesign had the desired effect, with reviewers commenting on the improved ride comfort, although some felt that the car's handling had not improved.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} working {{example of}} the <b>axle</b> changing <b>system</b> at the French-Spain border in 1948 had the axles being changed {{at the rate of}} 8 waggons or 32 axles per hour.|$|R
50|$|A Luttermöller axle is {{an unusual}} steam {{locomotives}} component. Steam locomotives with several axles or wheelsets connected to one another by coupling rods {{are not able to}} negotiate tight curves well. In order to assist such locomotives, the manager of the Orenstein & Koppel factory in Berlin, Dr. Luttermöller, built the <b>axle</b> <b>system</b> named after him.|$|E
50|$|In 1899, Karl Gölsdorf {{introduced}} his famous 180.00 class for the Austrian State Railway, an 0-10-0 for mountain regions {{which had a}} remarkably low axle load. It employed the Gölsdorf <b>axle</b> <b>system</b> and had the drive, unusually, on the fourth axle. The class existed both as simple expansion and as two-cylinder compound engines, and they later worked in Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, Romania and France.|$|E
50|$|The TAPV {{is powered}} by a Cummins QSL diesel engine, which {{provides}} , allowing the vehicle a maximum speed of 105 km/h (65 mph), and a maximum range of 644 km (400 miles). The vehicle utilizes an independent suspension <b>axle</b> <b>system</b> originally developed by Irish Timoney, and it has a central tire inflation system to prevent flat tires during combat operations.|$|E
50|$|There were {{companies}} that installed these upgrades for the previously mentioned manufacturers. Besides the four-wheel drive units NAPCO also provided winches, auxiliary transmissions, tandem drive <b>axles,</b> hydrovac <b>systems,</b> and dump truck bodies.|$|R

50|$|The front <b>axle</b> {{suspension}} <b>system</b> was trailing beam assemblies on coil springs, with a dual {{tire wheel}} {{on each side}} of the beam. With an assembly on each side there were 4 wheels on the axle line.|$|R
50|$|During the 1960s most of {{the narrow}} gauge {{railways}} were converted to standard gauge, and SJ chose to rebuild the locomotives to this gauge, and also change the <b>axle</b> <b>system</b> to D, giving them the designation T23. Of the remaining ten Tps, six were scrapped in the 1970s while the last four remained in service until the 1980s. The latter have all been preserved.|$|E
50|$|The entire {{engine air}} intake and the <b>axle</b> <b>system</b> was fully vented {{to allow for}} {{operation}} while submerged under water. Its full-floating front axle (Dana 25) {{was supported by the}} wheel hub, rather than the axle itself, and provided greater load capacity. The rear axle (Dana 44) was semi-floating. Its drivetrain was the L-head 134.2 cuin L with a T-90 transmission and the Dana 18 transfer case.|$|E
50|$|The Gölsdorf <b>axle</b> <b>system</b> {{is used on}} railway {{locomotives}} {{to achieve}} quiet running and low wear-and-tear when negotiating curves. It comprises a combination of fixed axles and axles that can slide transversely, all within a single, rigid locomotive frame. The system was invented by a young Austrian locomotive builder, Karl Gölsdorf, {{around the end of}} the 19th century. The first locomotive to use this principle entered service in 1897.|$|E

50|$|In {{pneumatic}} <b>axle</b> counting <b>systems,</b> pistons were actuated {{by specific}} loads and speeds. They proved limited in application, and therefore from the 1950s onwards {{were replaced by}} magnetic contacts. Up until that point, track circuits always had a big edge {{when it came to}} reliability.|$|R
50|$|Active Drive I is a {{full-time}} four-wheel drive system that requires no driver input. This system under normal conditions sends all available torque to the front wheels while monitoring {{the speed of the}} front and rear <b>axles.</b> If the <b>system</b> detects that the front axle is moving more quickly than the rear <b>axle</b> then the <b>system</b> will send power through the power transfer unit to the rear axle until the speeds are the same.|$|R
50|$|In 1945, a Spanish engineer, Alejandro Goicoechea, {{developed}} a streamlined articulated train {{able to run}} on existing tracks at higher speeds than contemporary passenger trains. This was achieved by providing the locomotive and cars with a unique <b>axle</b> <b>system</b> that used one axle set per car end, connected by a Y-bar coupler. Amongst other advantages, the centre of mass was only half as high as usual. This system became famous {{under the name of}} Talgo (Tren Articulado Ligero Goicoechea Oriol), and for half a century was the main Spanish provider of high-speed trains.|$|E
50|$|Assuming {{the wheel}} and axle does not {{dissipate}} or store energy, that is it has no friction or elasticity, the power input by the force applied to the wheel must equal the power output at the axle. As {{the wheel and}} <b>axle</b> <b>system</b> rotates around its bearings, points on the circumference, or edge, of the wheel move faster than points on the circumference, or edge, of the axle. Therefore, a force applied {{to the edge of}} the wheel must be less than the force applied {{to the edge of the}} axle, because power is the product of force and velocity.|$|E
50|$|In {{other types}} of {{suspension}} systems, the axles serve only to transmit driving torque to the wheels; the position and angle of the wheel hubs is an independent function of the suspension system. This {{is typical of the}} independent suspensions found on most newer cars and SUVs, and on the front of many light trucks. These systems still have differentials, but will not have attached axle housing tubes. They may be attached to the vehicle frame or body, or integral in a transaxle. The axle shafts (usually constant-velocity type) then transmit driving torque to the wheels. Like a full floating <b>axle</b> <b>system,</b> the drive shafts in a front-wheel drive independent suspension system do not support any vehicle weight.|$|E
50|$|Klosé and Buffet {{took the}} {{standard}} soprano clarinet, adapted {{the ring and}} <b>axle</b> keywork <b>system</b> to correct serious intonation issues on both {{the upper and lower}} joints of the instrument, and added duplicate keys for the left and right little fingers, simplifying several difficult articulations throughout the range of the instrument.|$|R
50|$|The gearbox used in E13TP 8×8 {{models is}} an {{automatic}} 6-speed Allison HD4500SP with a torque converter. The Steyr VG 2000/300 2-step reduction gear contains longitudinal, lockable differential between {{the front and}} rear axles. All axles are driven and produced by Sisu <b>Axles.</b> CTI <b>system</b> is available as an option.|$|R
