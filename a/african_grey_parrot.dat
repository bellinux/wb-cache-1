5|$|An {{unidentified}} dark parrot seen {{alive by}} the Swedish naturalist Fredrik Hasselqvist in Africa {{was given the}} name Psittacus obscurus by Linnaeus in 1758, who again synonymised it with the Mascarene parrot in 1766. Because of this association, some authors believed {{it was from the}} Mascarene Islands as well, but this dark parrot's description differs from that of the Mascarene parrot. This disagreement led some authors to use now-invalid combinations of the scientific names, such as Mascarinus obscurus and Coracopsis obscura. The unidentified parrot may have been an <b>African</b> <b>grey</b> <b>parrot</b> (Psittacus erithacus) instead.|$|E

25|$|Alex (1976– 6 September 2007) was an <b>African</b> <b>grey</b> <b>parrot</b> and {{the subject}} of a thirty-year (1977–2007) {{experiment}} by animal psychologist Irene Pepperberg, initially at the University of Arizona and later at Harvard University and Brandeis University.

25|$|Studies with captive {{birds have}} given insight into which birds {{are the most}} intelligent. While parrots are able to mimic human speech, studies with the <b>African</b> <b>grey</b> <b>parrot</b> have shown that some are able to {{associate}} words with their meanings and form simple sentences. Along with crows, ravens, and jays (family Corvidae), parrots are considered the most intelligent of birds. The brain-to body size ratio of psittacines and corvines is {{comparable to that of}} higher primates. One argument against the supposed intelligent capabilities of bird species is that birds have a relatively small cerebral cortex, which is {{the part of the brain}} considered the main area of intelligence in other animals. However, birds use a different part of the brain, the mediorostral HVC as the seat of their intelligence. These species tend to have the largest hyperstriata, and Harvey J. Karten, a neuroscientist at the University of California, San Diego, who studied bird physiology, has discovered that the lower part of the avian brain is functionally similar to that in humans. Not only have parrots demonstrated intelligence through scientific testing of their language-using ability, but also some species of parrots such as the kea are also highly skilled at using tools and solving puzzles.|$|E
25|$|Dja Faunal Reserve was {{established}} as a faunal reserve in 1950. It was designated by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site in 1987 under Natural Criteria ix and x, {{on account of the}} diversity of species present in the reserve. The Dja River surrounds the reserve on most of its border, except in the northeast. In 1981 it was designated a biosphere reserve under the UNESCO Man & Biosphere Programme covering an area of 526,000 ha. It has a topography with elevation varying between 400 m and 800 m with climate of equatorial type and with average annual precipitation of about 1,570mm. It has dense rain forests and is integral part of the Congo Basin. It is reported as the largest and best-protected of rainforests in Africa with 90 percent preserved in pristine condition mostly due to its difficult accessibility. There are more than 1,500 known plant (canopy of 30-40m rising to 60m) species in the reserve, over 107 mammals including five threatened species and more than 320 bird species in the reserve. The forest canopy consists of 43 tree species. It is well known for its biodiversity and a wide variety of primates such as western lowland gorilla Gorilla gorilla (CR) and western chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) with total reported species of more than 4000. As an Important Bird Area recognised by the BirdLife International, the 1993 inventory records avifauna of 349 resident species and also more than 80 species of regular migrants.

40|$|A few {{animal species}} {{are capable of}} vocal learning. Parrots are well known for their vocal {{imitation}} abilities. In this study, we investigated whether <b>African</b> <b>grey</b> <b>parrots</b> (Psittacus erithacus) emit specific vocalizations in specific contexts. We first described the vocal repertoire and its ontogenesis of four captive <b>grey</b> <b>parrots.</b> After a comparison with vocalizations emitted by wild and other captive <b>African</b> <b>grey</b> <b>parrots,</b> we observed that only three call categories were shared by all <b>grey</b> <b>parrots</b> populations, suggesting that isolated populations of parrots develop population-specific calls. Then, we artificially provoked ten different contexts and recorded vocalizations of four captive <b>grey</b> <b>parrots</b> in these situations. Parrots predominantly emitted call categories in some contexts: distress, protestation, alarm, asking (i. e. emitted when a bird wanted something from an experimenter and contact calls.

40|$|Human {{speech is}} {{considered}} to be unique means of communication. The beginnings of human vocalization, which develops into the speech, however, have some patterns or principles which can also be found in animal communication. It has been discovered that there are similarities between humans and animals in terms of social organization, neural control, cognition and function of vocal signals. Moreover, it seems that birds, parrots specifically, have closer parallels with humans in these respects than with other primates. Vocal ontogeny was, however, at least in parrots, investigated only marginally. Therefore it has become the subject of this study. <b>African</b> <b>grey</b> <b>parrots</b> (Psittacus erithacus) show a wide range of cognitive abilities and are thus suitable species for comparison with humans. The aim {{of this study was to}} map the early vocal development of <b>African</b> <b>grey</b> <b>parrots</b> until age of 11 weeks.

40|$|Some <b>African</b> <b>grey</b> <b>parrots</b> (Psittacus erithacus), {{the most}} famous being Pepperberg's parrot Alex, are able to imitate human speech and produce labels referentially. In this study, {{the aim was to}} teach ten <b>African</b> <b>grey</b> <b>parrots</b> from two {{laboratories}} to label items. Training three parrots from the first laboratory for several months with the Model/Rival method, developed by Pepperberg, in which two humans interact in front of the subject to demonstrate the use of a label, led to disappointing results. Similarly, seven parrots from the second laboratory, having been trained with several variants of Model/Rival attained little success. After the informal observation of the efficiency of other methods (i. e. learning to imitate labels either spontaneously or with specific learning methods and use of these labels referentially), four different teaching methods were tested with two birds: the Model/Rival; Repetition/Association which consisted of repeating a label and presenting the item only when the parrot produced the label; Intuitive in which the experimenter handled an item and repeated its name in front of the subject; Diffusion in which labels with either variable or flat intonation were played back daily to parrots. One bird learned three labels, one of which was used referentially, with the Repetition/Association method. He learned one label non-referentially with the Model/Rival but no labels were acquired using the other methods. The second bird did not learn any labels. This study demonstrates that different methods can be efficient to teach labels referentially and it suggests that rearing conditions and interindividual variability are important features when assessing learning ability of <b>African</b> <b>grey</b> <b>parrots...</b>|$|R
