For most relevant industrial applications, the turnover frequency is in the range of 10−2 - 102 s−1 (enzymes 103 - 107 s−1).1Turnover number of catalase is maximum i.e. 4 X 107 s−1.|$|R
5000|$|The {{opposite}} of a multi-table tournament is a single-table tournament, often <b>abbreviated</b> STT.

[...] Sit-and-go tournaments of more than one table are becoming more common, however, especially in Internet poker.

Bassists who want a more powerful low end may use a subwoofer cabinet. Subwoofers are specialized for very low frequency reproduction, with typical maximum useful high frequencies of about 150 or 200 Hz, so a subwoofer cabinet must be paired with a full range speaker cabinet to obtain the full tonal range of an electric bass or upright bass.

Bass guitar players who use subwoofer cabinets include performers who play with extended range basses with include notes between B0 (about 31 Hz); and C#0 (17 Hz) and bassists whose style requires a very powerful sub-bass response {{is an important part of}} the sound (e.g., funk, Latin, gospel, R & B, etc.).|$|R

5000|$|Common {{lengths of}} the race could be 800 meters or 1600 meters. The 800 meters {{variation}} usually would be two 100 meters legs, a 200 meters leg and a 400 meters leg. The 800 meter version is {{sometimes referred to as}} the Super Sprint Medley Relay to distinguish it from the longer version. More commonly, the 800 meters version is distinguished by <b>abbreviated</b> leg <b>numbers</b> (1-1-2-4). The events are usually not referred to by their cumulative distance as that would tend to indicate 4 legs of the same distance. The 1600 meters variation usually would be two 200 meters legs, a 400 meters leg and an 800 meters leg. It would be named numerically (2-2-4-8). [...] Some have done a 1000 meters variation, which does not fit into an even number of laps, running a 100 meters leg, a 200 meters leg, a 300 meters leg and a 400 meters leg. The (1-2-3-4) format {{is referred to as the}} Swedish relay. At some youth level meets, where the handoff is not as refined, the 400 meters leg has been conducted first. This is consistent with a related event, the Distance medley relay which starts with a longer race. At a higher level of athlete, this would put handoffs for short sprinting legs into theoretical common passing zones unless the track is specifically marked with the 4 turn stagger required to run a 4 x 200 meters relay entirely in lanes. Short sprinters moving around in a common passing zone at the last moment is a potentially chaotic situation.|$|R

Furthermore; in a steady Bénard flow; the entropy productions of the system increase alongside the Ra parameters. It was also found that {{the difference between the two}} entropy productions is the driving force to drive the system to a steady state.

40|$|Vegetation {{in coastal}} areas plays an {{important}} role in its environment. In addition, vegetation can also be utilized for coastal protection. Incoming wave energy could be effectively attenuated by the upstanding vegetation plants. The reduced wave energy results in stabilized seabed and harmonious environment in coastal zones. Nowadays, an increasing number of projects have been carried out to apply vegetation as a soft measure for coastal protection. Wave energy dissipation by vegetation is primarily induced by the work done by drag force acting on the vegetation. A drag coefficient (CD) is introduced to characterize the flow resistance from the plant stems. Knowledge of CD is of great importance for understanding and predicting the wave dissipation process. In previous studies, relations between CD and Reynolds number (Re) have been proposed in pure current or pure wave. In addition, relations between CD and the Keulegan-Carpenter <b>number</b> (<b>abbreviated</b> as KC and KC=Uw*Tw/d, Tw is the wave period and d is the plant stem diameter) have also been suggested. In Keulegan-Carptenter number, the wave period Tw is also considered. Since waves are oscillatory flow, it would be preferable to use the KC number to describe the behaviour of CD in wave-present conditions. However, contradictory conclusions are found in the literature on the CD-KC relation in pure wave condition. Monotonous decreasing of CD with KC has been reported for multiple vegetation mimics. On the contrary, the rise-and-fall variation trend has been observed in pure wave, but only for single cylinder. It is noted that the transition point (from rise to fall) occurs when KC value is small, which is often left out in the experiment with multiple vegetation mimics in previous studies. Hence, it is necessary to investigate the variation trend of CD-KC for multiple vegetation mimics in pure wave with a wider KC range. Moreover, background tidal currents may also play a role in the wave dissipation process. It is often the case that when the tide penetrates the coastal wetlands during flooding phase, waves propagate in the same direction as the tidal currents. The underlying current may affect the behaviour of oscillatory wave flow during the energy-damping process and the CD-KC relation. Yet, the CD-KC relation in combined current-wave flow has not been reported in previous studies. In order to fill the knowledge gap in the CD-KC relation, an experimental approach was adopted by using the laboratory flume to replicate such complicated hydrodynamics. The flume is 40 m long and 0. 8 m wide, with a patch of rigid wooden cylinders as vegetation mimics installed over the entire channel width over a 6 m long test section. Pure wave can be generated by the wave generator. The underlying current can be made by using a water circulation system in the flume. After the generation of underlying current, waves could be generated afterwards and propagate together with the underlying current in the flume. The velocity was measured using EMS within the vegetation patch. Direct measurement data of the force on individual rods within the array were collected by attchaching the rods to the force sensors and embedding them in the false bottom of the flume. Three densities of the vegetation mimics were investigated for two water depths in this study. The results of the experiments reveal a rise-and-fall variation trend of CD-KC for multiple vegetation mimics in pure wave. The rise-part occurs when KC is small, around KC= 3 to 10 and this phenomenon could be phycisally explained based on the changes in vortexes shedding directions. In this range of KC, the vortexes motions would change its propagation direction from lateral to oblique and longitudally parallel with the incoming flow. It is the changes in vortexes directions that lead to the increase of flow resistance experienced by the cylinder. Beyond this range of KC, the vortexes motion would keep moving longitudinally parallel and behave much the same way as in steady current. Natuarally, similar to the behaviour found in steady current conditions, the values of CD would decrease gradually and converge to 1. In the combined current-wave flow conditions, it is necessary to make a distinction between oscillatory-dominated flow and unidirectional-dominated flow. For small underlying current applied in this study, the flow could be regarded as oscillatory-dominated. It is found that the similar rise-and-fall pattern of CD-KC relation occurs in this kind of combined flow. And the transition point of KC locates at around KC= 10, which is also the case found in pure wave conditions. But the peak value of CD would decrease a little bit. However, for larger underlying current conditions, the combined flow is similar to pure current. Consequently, the peak values of CD would collapse. Thus, the values of CD obtained in these conditions are stable and close to 1. The experimental results suggest the vegetation density as well as the water depths has limited effects on the values of CD and its variation trend with KC. It is recommended to carry further investigation concerning the influence on CD caused by vegetation density (N) and relative vegetation height (?) in future studies. The product of this thesis is a general description and explaination for the variation trend of CD-KC in pure wave and combined current-wave flow conditions. Physically, more insights have been gained about the evolution of vortex shedding in different flow conditions, say from pure wave to combined current-wave flow conditions. Moreover, both the calibration approach (used by Mendez and Losada, 2004, etc.) and direct measurement method have been utilised for data processing. The direct measurement method is recommended to apply in all the complicated flow conditions. As to the calibration approach, it should not be applied to obtain CD values in combined current-wave flow. Hydraulic EngineeringHydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
