40|$|This Bachelor's thesis called "Social Security <b>and</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Services</b> in the Past and Present" {{focuses on}} the {{historical}} development as well as current state of <b>social</b> security system <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>services.</b> The <b>social</b> security system in the Czech Republic comprises of social insurance, state <b>social</b> support <b>and</b> <b>social</b> assistance. As a whole, {{the social security system}} serves as a protection and support for people in difficult life situations. The aim of the system is to eliminate or at least mitigate the consequences of such unfortunate life situations. The system achieves this mostly by providing various benefits <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>services</b> that are discussed separately in this thesis. <b>Social</b> <b>services</b> can be divided into social counselling, <b>social</b> care <b>services</b> <b>and</b> preventive <b>social</b> care <b>services.</b> The goal of this thesis was to describe the current <b>social</b> security system <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>services</b> in the Czech Republic and the historical evolution of the system. Next, the thesis also intended to analyse / evaluate the social security system in the historical context. The theoretical part explains the concepts of <b>social</b> security <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>services,</b> defines their purpose and describes the current system in the Czech Republic. The practical part concentrates on the history and development of Czech <b>social</b> security system <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>services.</b> In the practical part, I analysed the historical development of the <b>social</b> security system <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>services</b> in the Czech lands. Specifically, I focused on the so-called Taaffe's reforms in the late 19 th century. Qualitative research was carried out based on 12 publications.

5|$|Williamson {{and other}} members of Jamaica's lesbian, gay, bisexual, and {{transgender}} (LGBT) community decided to form an organisation to campaign for their rights, resulting in the establishment of the Jamaica Forum for Lesbians, All Sexuals, and Gays (J-FLAG) in December 1998. J-FLAG sought to enhance LGBT rights through advocacy and encouraging legal reform, as well as through educational <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>service</b> programs. They also kept a record of anti-LGBT hate crimes including assaults, home invasions, and the corrective rape of lesbians, further recording the murder of 30 gay men between 1997 and 2004. From the time of the group's foundation, its members were subjected to repeated death threats. Williamson became the public face of the group, appearing on radio talk shows and television shows such as Perspective and Nationwide in which he argued against homophobia and called for greater government investment to tackle the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Unlike most other LGBT rights activists in Jamaica, Williamson did not seek to protect himself by using a pseudonym, disguising his voice, or hiding his appearance. Facing hostility and threats of violence, Williamson left Jamaica and moved to Canada and then England, before returning to the island in 2002. There, he moved into an apartment in his Haughton Street compound and decided to take a renewed role within Jamaica's LGBT rights movement. He lived in one room of his apartment block and rented out a number of others.|$|E
