5|$|Baroque {{architecture}} is a European phenomenon originating in 17th-century Italy; it is flamboyant and theatrical, and richly ornamented by sculpture and an effect known as chiaroscuro, the strategic use {{of light and}} shade on a building created by mass <b>and</b> <b>shadow.</b>|$|E
5|$|Disruptive {{coloration}} {{is common}} in military usage, for military vehicles, for firing positions and other installations, and for individual soldiers, where uniforms, equipment such as helmets, and face paint {{may be used to}} break up outlines and features. Disruptive coloration, however, does not always achieve crypsis on its own, as an animal or a military target may be given away by other factors including shape, shine, <b>and</b> <b>shadow.</b>|$|E

5|$|Masaccio's use {{of light}} was also revolutionary. While earlier artists like Giotto had applied a flat, neutral light from an unidentifiable source, Masaccio's light emanated from a {{specific}} location outside the picture, casting {{the figures in}} light <b>and</b> <b>shadow.</b> This created a chiaroscuro effect, sculpting the bodies into three-dimensional shapes.|$|E

5|$|A {{letter of}} support from 120 members of the German parliament, the Bundestag, {{was sent to the}} Russian Ambassador to Germany, Vladimir Grinin. It {{described}} proceedings against the women as disproportionate and draconian. On August 9, 2012, 200 Pussy Riot supporters in Berlin marched, wearing colored balaclavas, in a show of support for the group. Attending the trial, British MP <b>and</b> <b>Shadow</b> Foreign Office Minister for Human Rights, Kerry McCarthy, also backed the group, describing proceedings as “surreal”. Lech Wałęsa criticised the church performance as “tasteless”, but nevertheless wrote to Putin urging him to pardon the women.|$|E
5|$|A {{monument}} to the bicycle kick executed by Ramón Unzaga was erected in Talcahuano, Chile, in 2014; created by sculptor María Angélica Echavarri, the statue is composed of copper and bronze and measures three meters in diameter. A statue in honor of Manuel Negrete's bicycle kick is planned for the Coyoacán district of Mexico City. The Uruguayan novelist Eduardo Galeano wrote about the bicycle kick in his book Soccer in Sun <b>and</b> <b>Shadow,</b> praising Unzaga as the inventor. The Peruvian Nobel laureate writer Mario Vargas Llosa has the protagonist in The Time of the Heros Spanish edition declare that the bicycle kick must have been invented in Callao, Peru.|$|E

5|$|Although not {{traditionally}} {{regarded as}} an apotropaic, mirrors {{have been used to}} ward off vampires when placed, facing outwards, on a door (in some cultures, vampires do not have a reflection and sometimes do not cast a shadow, perhaps as a manifestation of the vampire's lack of a soul). This attribute is not universal (the Greek vrykolakas/tympanios was capable of both reflection <b>and</b> <b>shadow),</b> but was used by Bram Stoker in Dracula and has remained popular with subsequent authors and filmmakers.|$|E
5|$|As for the Harii, {{quite apart}} from their strength, which exceeds {{that of the other}} tribes I have just listed, they pander to their innate savagery by skill and timing: with black shields and painted bodies, they choose dark nights to fight, and by means of terror <b>and</b> <b>shadow</b> of a ghostly army they cause panic, since no enemy can bear a sight so {{unexpected}} and hellish; in every battle the eyes are the first to be conquered.|$|E
5|$|As sweet {{a little}} nook as ever Ulysses mooned away a day in, during his memorable voyage homeward.

In this sunny time, the sheep are bleating from the shores, the yacht lies double, yacht <b>and</b> <b>shadow,</b> and the bay is painted richly with the clear reflection of the mountains.|$|E

5|$|As {{with the}} early days of Sicilian Baroque, the first {{buildings}} of the new neoclassical era were often copies or hybrids of the two styles. The Palazzo Ducezio (Illustration 19) was begun in 1746, and the ground floor with arcades creating play of light <b>and</b> <b>shadow</b> is pure Baroque. However, when a few years later the upper floor was added, despite the use of Baroque broken pediments above the windows, the neoclassical French influence is very pronounced, highlighted by the central curved bay. The Sicilian Baroque was gradually and slowly being superseded by French neoclassicism.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the main}} {{characters}} in the game hold a significant grudge against the Empire and, in particular, Kefka Palazzo, who serves {{as one of the}} game's main antagonists along with Emperor Gestahl. The supporting character Ultros serves as a recurring villain and comic relief throughout the game. A handful of Final Fantasy VI characters have reappeared in later games, such as Secret of Evermore. Additionally, Final Fantasy SGI, a short tech demo produced for the Silicon Graphics Onyx workstation, featured polygon-based 3D renderings of Locke, Terra, <b>and</b> <b>Shadow.</b>|$|E
5|$|Rodin was a naturalist, less {{concerned}} with monumental expression than with character and emotion. Departing with centuries of tradition, {{he turned away from}} the idealism of the Greeks, and the decorative beauty of the Baroque and neo-Baroque movements. His sculpture emphasized the individual and the concreteness of flesh, and suggested emotion through detailed, textured surfaces, and the interplay of light <b>and</b> <b>shadow.</b> To a greater degree than his contemporaries, Rodin believed that an individual's character was revealed by his physical features.|$|E
