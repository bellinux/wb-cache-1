5|$|During the 1600s and 1700s, The Three Fires Confederacy {{controlled}} much of {{the area}} known as {{the hub of the}} Great Lakes, which included the Canadian shore where Sarnia is now located. During this time, it maintained relations with many of the First Nations, including Huron, Sioux, and Iroquois, as well as the countries of Great Britain and France. Their trading partners, the Huron, welcomed La Salle and the Griffon in 1679 after he sailed into Lake Huron.

The Boreidae (snow scorpionflies) are the sister clade to the Siphonaptera.|$|E
5|$|Historically, the {{inclusion}} of genera within Liliaceae has been extremely broad. Of the various published systems, {{one of the best}} known and also the broadest modern circumscription is the Cronquist system (1981), which included nearly 300 genera in Liliaceae. Most of these have been reassigned to other families, <b>as</b> <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> following collapsed list, following ITIS, together with their disposition as APG III transfers to other families and subfamilies, within Liliales and three other orders, Alismatales, Asparagales and Dioscoreales. Current members of Liliaceae are shown in bold.|$|E
5|$|In the {{commentary}} for the episode, Anderson elaborated on Scully and Waterston's original backstory: after Scully and Waterston {{came close to}} having an affair, Scully left to study at Quantico to become an FBI agent. After she left, Waterston become depressed, and his family began to suspect the affair. The emotional turmoil {{was too much for}} Waterston's wife, who killed herself, which made Waterston's daughter, Maggie, resent Scully, <b>as</b> <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> finished episode. Anderson felt that the removal of this backstory made it hard for the audience to understand why Maggie was so angry at Scully.|$|E

5|$|Mutual {{intelligibility}} {{among these}} ASL varieties is high, and the variation is primarily lexical. For example, {{there are three}} different words for English about in Canadian ASL; the standard way, and two regional variations (Atlantic and Ontario), <b>as</b> <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> videos on the right. Variation may also be phonological, meaning that the same sign may be signed {{in a different way}} depending on the region. For example, an extremely common type of variation is between the handshapes /1/, /L/, and /5/ in signs with one handshape.|$|E
5|$|Proteins {{can also}} be natural poisons or antinutrients, such as the trypsin inhibitors (discussed above) that are found in some legumes, <b>as</b> <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> figure above. A less common class of toxins are toxic enzymes: these act as {{irreversible}} inhibitors of their target enzymes and work by chemically modifying their substrate enzymes. An example is ricin, an extremely potent protein toxin found in castor oil beans. This enzyme is a glycosidase that inactivates ribosomes. Since ricin is a catalytic irreversible inhibitor, this allows just a single molecule of ricin to kill a cell.|$|E
5|$|The {{best known}} {{cleaning}} symbioses are among marine fishes, where {{several species of}} small fish, notably of wrasse, are specialised in colour, pattern and behaviour as cleaners, providing a cleaning and ectoparasite removal service to larger, often predatory fish. Cleaner species, <b>as</b> <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> table, vary widely in their degree of dependence on their clients. Some are essentially pure obligate symbionts like the cleaner wrasse; some are opportunistic or facultative symbionts, like the orange chromide or some cleaner shrimps; and some, like the oxpeckers, combine a little eating of parasites (beneficial to client) with taking of blood (harmful to client), their favoured food.|$|E
