25|$|Tower Rock {{was visited}} {{by a member}} of the {{expedition}} again in 1806. The expedition remained a single party after departing Fort Clatsop on the Pacific Ocean. Having reached Traveler's Rest (near present-day Lolo, Montana), Lewis and Clark decided to split the expedition in two. Lewis took nine men and proceeded due east, intending to find the Marias River again. Clark, meanwhile, proceeded south-southeast toward the headwaters of the Missouri, intending to locate the source of the Yellowstone River and explore it until its confluence with the Missouri. Lewis' group did not visit Tower Rock. The main party under Clark followed the Bitterroot River south to Sula, Montana, where it turned south toward Gibbons Pass and the crossing of the Continental Divide. Following a series of creeks and trails southwestward, Clarks' party reached the Big Hole River, following it to the Jefferson River and then to the Missouri again. At Three Forks (where the Jefferson, Gallatin, and Madison rivers join to form the Missouri River), on July 13, 1806, Clark ordered Sergeant John Ordway to take a group of nine <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> the Missouri to the camp at White Bear Island and there await Meriwether Lewis. On the afternoon of July 17, the Ordway party approached Tower Rock. But high winds came up, causing heavy waves which nearly swamped the canoes. The Ordway group was forced to spend the afternoon and night near Tower Rock before proceeding past Half-Breed Rapids the next day. Ordway reached White Bear Island on July 19.|$|E
500|$|Eschewing common jazz practice, Shepp {{does not}} improvise new melodic lines within the spirituals' {{harmonic}} framework, but plays short, impromptu passages around a melodic idea. Parlan plays piano solos on {{only two of}} the album's pieces. Shepp contributes a tonal roughness to the songs with growled sounds, which he plays by singing or humming into his saxophone. He also uses harmonic overtones, breathy tonal weight, and expressive chromatic development of melody to add textural and timbral variety to the songs. Shepp and Parlan's reverent takes on [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] <b>and</b> <b>Go</b> <b>Down</b> Moses" [...] exhibit split tones and fortes.|$|E

2500|$|Film critic Armond White named both The Blood of Jesus <b>and</b> <b>Go</b> <b>Down</b> Death {{as being}} [...] "among the most spiritually adventurous movies ever made.
