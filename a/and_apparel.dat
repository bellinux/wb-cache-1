5|$|All weapons <b>and</b> <b>apparel</b> {{found within}} the Wastelands, {{regardless}} of whether they are a makeshift-weapon such as a lead pipe, or a gun, degrade over time the more they are used, and thus become less effective. For firearms, degrading into poor condition causes them to do less damage and possibly jam when reloading, while apparel that reduces damage becomes less protective as it gradually absorbs damage from attacks. When too much damage is taken, the items breaks and cannot be used. To ensure weapons <b>and</b> <b>apparel</b> are working effectively, such items require constant maintenance and repairs which can be done in one of two ways. The first method is find certain vendors that repair items, though how much they can repair an item depends on their skill level, while the cost of the repairs depends upon the item itself. The second method is for players to find a second of the same item that needs repairs (or a comparable item), and salvaging parts from it for the repair, though how much they can do depends on their character's own skill level in repairs.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze changes in {{undergraduate}} student knowledge of issues of sustainability relevant to the <b>apparel</b> <b>and</b> textiles industry. Assessment occurred prior to and upon completion of a course that addressed topics specific to the global production <b>and</b> distribution of <b>apparel</b> <b>and</b> textile goods. The study also examined modifications in students’ reported apparel purchasing behaviors. Design/methodology/approach – Participants included those in their third, fourth or fifth year of undergraduate education in the <b>apparel</b> <b>and</b> textile discipline at a higher education institution located in the Midwestern USA. All participants were enrolled in a course focused on globalization <b>and</b> the <b>apparel</b> <b>and</b> textile industry.

Findings – Pre and post comparisons revealed significant changes in students’ knowledge of social and environmental issues relevant to the <b>apparel</b> <b>and</b> textile industry. However, the study found no significant adjustments in apparel purchasing behavior. Further, a post hoc analysis revealed no significant relationship between students’ knowledge and their reported purchasing behavior. Originality/value – Limited resources exist which examine methods for educating <b>apparel</b> <b>and</b> textile students about sustainability issues, with even less research documented on assessing the effectiveness of these methods. The paper analyzes the contributions sustainability-focused curriculum can make in modifying the level of knowledge and purchasing behavior of students and recommends further strategies to yield possibly even greater results...|$|R
