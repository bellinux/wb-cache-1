40|$|This is {{the first}} annual report from the current Independent National Security Legislation Monitor, Roger Gyles, who has been tasked with {{assessing}} the appropriateness and effectiveness of Australia 2 ̆ 7 s national security legislation. Introduction This is my first annual report to the Prime Minister as the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor (INSLM). On 11 December 2014 the then Prime Minister appointed me as the acting INSLM, under section 20 of the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor Act 2010 (INSLM Act) (see also section 33 A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901). There was a vacancy {{in the office of}} the INSLM. The first INSLM, Bret Walker SC, held the office from his appointment on 21 April 2011 for a period of 3 years. I acknowledge the significant contribution made by my predecessor, Bret Walker SC, as INSLM to the counter-terrorism and national security aspect of public policy in Australia. There was no person performing the functions of the INSLM following the expiration of the term of appointment of Bret Walker SC in April 2014 until my appointment as the acting INSLM. On 19  March 2014, the Government introduced into the Parliament (the House of Representatives) the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor Repeal Bill 2014, which was designed to repeal the INSLM Act and abolish the office of INSLM. The Government ultimately decided against pursuing that Bill. On 17 July 2014 the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor Repeal Bill 2014 was withdrawn from the House of Representatives Notice Paper. The Bill had been referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee for inquiry and report, but that became unnecessary when the Bill was withdrawn (although the Committee did receive publicly-available submissions on the subject). My initial appointment was on an acting basis due to the requirement for security clearance prior to a substantive appointment. Security clearance was obtained on 24 April 2015. On 20 August 2015 I was appointed to be the part-time INSLM for a period of two years by the Governor-General, acting on the advice of the Federal Executive Council, under section 11 (1) of the INSLM Act. That period is less than the three-year term of the first INSLM and expires prior to the time limit imposed by section 6 (1 B) of the INSLM Act (discussed further below). I was not consulted about the term of the appointment before it took place. This annual report relates to the period of <b>acting</b> <b>appointment</b> between 11 December 2014 and 30  June 2015...|$|E

The new Act provided that Judges would hold office during good behavior whereas, previously they held office during his Majesty’s pleasure. Instead of the ceiling of twenty Judges fixed by the previous Act, the new Act left it to his Majesty to fix the number of Judges separately for each High Court depending upon their requirements. All <b>acting</b> <b>appointments</b> of Judges were left {{in the hands of the}} Governor-General and powers of the Local Governments werewithdrawn. Under the old system, the Chief Justice had always been a Barrister Judge, however, the new Act removed this barrier and opened the Chief Justice-ship to Civilian Judges as well. The old Act fixed a definite proportion of Civilian and Barrister Judges in the composition of the High Court which was removed by the new Act. The new Act also fixed the 60 years age limit for the High Court Judges which did not exist in the old Act but which was otherwise enforced by the terms of the Judges’ appointment. By virtue of the Government of India (High Court Judges) Order, 1937, maximum number of Judges for the several High Courts in India was fixed. In each case the number so stated was exclusive of the Chief Justice but included all additional judges. The maximum number of Judges fixed for the Lahore High Court was 15. The said Order also prescribed the scale of pay and rights as to leave, pension and gratuity etc. of the Judges serving in the different High Courts in India including the Lahore High Court.|$|R
