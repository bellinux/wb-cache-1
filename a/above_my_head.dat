25|$|The {{idea came}} to me in a game, when the guy at bat was all tighted up waiting for my fast ball. I knew he'd swing as soon as I just barely moved. So when I stretched, I paused just a little longer with my arms <b>above</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> Then I threw my left foot forward but I didn't come around with my arm right away. I put that foot of mine down, {{stopping}} for a second, before the ball left my hand. When my foot hit the ground that boy started swinging, so by the time I came around with the whip he was way off stride and couldn't get anywhere near the ball. I had me a strikeout.|$|E
500|$|Film {{historian}} Joseph McBride considered O'Hara's {{performance to}} have been the most powerful and intense emotionally he'd seen since Katharine Hepburn in Mary of Scotland (1936). O'Hara stated that her favorite scene in the film took place outside the church after her character gets married, remarking, [...] "I make my way down the steps to the carriage waiting below, the wind catches my veil and fans it out in a perfect circle all the way around my face. Then it floats straight up <b>above</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> and points to the heavens. It's breathtaking." ...|$|E

5000|$|He {{describes}} his torture as follows: [...] "I was once {{arrested by the}} security police of the apartheid regime. I was tortured for two full days and nights non-stop. I was stripped naked, I was handcuffed behind my back, my ankles were chained, I was blindfolded, I was beaten up, I was insulted, there was a gun that was shot <b>above</b> <b>my</b> own <b>head,</b> I suppose to scare me, I was spat at, {{all sorts of things}} were done, and of course electric shocks..." [...] (ABC Radio National 2004).|$|R
60|$|There was no {{such thing}} {{possible}} for me. You have heard grasshoppers whirring in the grass in the summer-time? Well, I had no sooner closed my eyes than <b>my</b> body, and <b>above</b> all <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> belly, and wrists, seemed to be filled with whirring grasshoppers; and I must open my eyes again at once, and tumble and toss, and sit up and lie down; and look at the sky which dazzled me, or at Cluny's wild and dirty sentries, peering out {{over the top of the}} brae and chattering to each other in the Gaelic.|$|R
60|$|Now {{gathered}} the clouds <b>above</b> <b>my</b> unconscious <b>head.</b> That divine echo, since known {{throughout the world}} as the Great Koh-i-noor, or Mountain of Repetitions, was discovered. It was a sixty-five carat gem. You could utter a word and it would talk back at you for fifteen minutes, when the day was otherwise quiet. But behold, another fact came to light at the same time: another echo-collector was in the field. The two rushed to make the peerless purchase. The property consisted {{of a couple of}} small hills with a shallow swale between, out yonder among the back settlements of New York State. Both men arrived on the ground at the same time, and neither knew the other was there. The echo was not all owned by one man; a person by the name of Williamson Bolivar Jarvis owned the east hill, and a person by the name of Harbison J. Bledso owned the west hill; the swale between was the dividing-line. So while my uncle was buying Jarvis's hill for three million two hundred and eighty-five thousand dollars, the other party was buying Bledso's hill for a shade over three million.|$|R

2500|$|... "After a night {{spent in}} fever and sleeplessness, I {{forced myself to}} take a long tramp the next day through the hilly country, which was covered with pine woods. It all looked dreary and desolate, and I could not think what I should do there. Returning in the afternoon, I {{stretched}} myself, dead tired, on a hard couch, awaiting the long-desired hour of sleep. It did not come; but I fell into a kind of somnolent state, in which I suddenly felt as though I were sinking in swiftly flowing water. The rushing sound formed itself in my brain into a musical sound, the chord of E flat; major, which continually re-echoed in broken forms; these broken chords seemed to be melodic passages of increasing motion, yet the pure triad of E flat; major never changed, but seemed by its continuance to impart infinite significance to the element in which I was sinking. I awoke in sudden terror from my doze, feeling as though the waves were rushing high <b>above</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> I at once recognised that the orchestral overture to the Rheingold, which must long have lain latent within me, though it had been unable to find definite form, had at last been revealed to me."

6000|$|Lone Chief nodded vigorously. [...] "Mutsak speaks true. In {{the time}} that followed, <b>my</b> <b>head</b> was well, {{and it was not}} well. For though the flesh healed and the sore went away, yet was I sick inside. When I walked, my legs shook under me, and when I looked at the light, my eyes became filled with tears. And when I opened my eyes, the world outside went around and around, and when I closed <b>my</b> eyes, <b>my</b> <b>head</b> inside went around and around, and all the things I had ever seen went around and around inside <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> And <b>above</b> <b>my</b> eyes there was a great pain, as though {{something}} heavy rested always upon me, or like a band that is drawn tight and gives much hurt. And speech was slow to me, and I waited long for each right word to come to my tongue. And when I waited not long, all manner of words crowded in, and my tongue spoke foolishness. I was very sick, and when my father, the Otter, brought the girl Kasaan before me--" ...|$|R
40|$|I {{pulled my}} left arm from beneath the warm pile of {{blankets}} and coverlets. With small forefinger I touched the crystalline sheet of ice that covered the small window <b>above</b> <b>my</b> bed. The contact was strange: along my arm the minute, pale hairs rose with the goose pimples; a queer trembling passed through my body; my small bed trembled; and the hairs on <b>my</b> <b>head</b> {{seemed to want to}} pull from their roots. I quickly put my arm back under the comforting warmth of the blankets and pressed my nose into the pillow [...] ...|$|R

My Lord Keeper has sent to invite me to dinner to-morrow, and you'll dine better with the Dean; and God bless you. I forgot to tell you that {{yesterday}} was sent me a Narrative printed, with all the circumstances of Mr. Harley's stabbing. I had not time to do it myself; so I sent my hints to the author of the Atalantis,(2) and she has cooked it into a sixpenny pamphlet, in her own style, only the first page is left as I was beginning it. But I was afraid of disobliging Mr. Harley or Mr. St. John in one critical point about it, and so would not do it myself. It is worth your reading, for the circumstances are all true. My chest of Florence was sent me this morning, and cost me seven and sixpence to two servants. I would give two guineas you had it, etc.|$|R
