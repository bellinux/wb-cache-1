5|$|Naem {{typically}} has a short shelf life, {{which can}} be extended through refrigeration. The sausage can be time-consuming and labor-intensive to prepare. In Thailand, it is typically stored at room temperature, which gives it <b>a</b> <b>shelf</b> life of around one week. It is also produced in areas of Southeast Asia near Thailand.|$|E

40|$|We {{carried out}} {{measurements}} and lighting simulations {{of an existing}} office building in order to clarify the characteristics of indoor lighting environments using daylight with <b>a</b> light <b>shelf.</b> Paired comparison measurements were performed to elucidate the difference between using only <b>a</b> light <b>shelf</b> and using <b>a</b> light <b>shelf</b> with <b>a</b> blind in terms of horizontal illuminance and window luminance. Next, {{the effect of the}} light shelf’s presence or absence on indoor lighting environments was verified through lighting simulations. Measurements and simulations revealed that when <b>a</b> light <b>shelf</b> was available, the luminance of {{the upper part of the}} window was higher than that of the lower part, suggesting that glare does not result from the lower part of the window. We also found that using <b>a</b> light <b>shelf</b> increased horizontal illuminance by about 10 % over the case of no light shelf.

5|$|Cooking {{onions and}} sweet onions are better stored at room temperature, optimally {{in a single}} layer, in mesh bags in a dry, cool, dark, well-ventilated location. In this environment, cooking onions have <b>a</b> <b>shelf</b> life of {{three to four weeks}} and sweet onions one to two weeks. Cooking onions will absorb odours from apples and pears. Also, they draw {{moisture}} from vegetables with which they are stored which may cause them to decay.|$|E
5|$|In April 1940, {{early in}} the Second World War, Nazi Germany invaded and {{occupied}} Denmark. To prevent the Germans from discovering Max von Laue's and James Franck's gold Nobel medals, Bohr had de Hevesy dissolve them in aqua regia. In this form, they were stored on <b>a</b> <b>shelf</b> at the Institute until after the war, when the gold was precipitated and the medals re-struck by the Nobel Foundation. Bohr kept the Institute running, but all the foreign scholars departed.|$|E
50|$|Like {{other members}} of Stethacanthidae, Stethacanthus had unique pelvic girdles, single-crowned and non-growing scales, a {{pectoral}} fin composed of metapterygium with an accompanying ‘whip’ attached and a distinctive first dorsal fin and spine, termed the Spine-Brush Complex. The neurocranium had <b>a</b> narrow suborbital <b>shelf,</b> <b>a</b> broad supraorbital <b>shelf,</b> <b>a</b> short otico-occipital division, large orbits, and cladodontic teeth that aligned precisely. In addition to these features, Stethacanthus also had male pelvic claspers with non-prismatic calcified cartilage at the distal ends.|$|R

5|$|Jif is a {{brand of}} natural {{strength}} lemon juice prepared using lemon juice concentrate and water, whereby the concentrate is reconstituted using water. After reconstitution, it is packaged and marketed. It is sold in the United Kingdom and Ireland by Unilever. Jif {{is used as a}} flavourant and ingredient in dishes, and as a condiment. Two tablespoons is around the equivalent of the juice of one lemon. The product has <b>a</b> <b>shelf</b> life of six months.|$|E
5|$|Jif is {{prepared}} from reconstituted lemon concentrate and water as primary ingredients, and is formulated {{to be the}} same strength as natural lemons.

5000|$|The term [...] "iceport" [...] was {{suggested}} by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names in 1956 to denote <b>an</b> ice <b>shelf</b> indentation, subject to configuration changes, which may offer anchorage or possible access to the upper surface of <b>an</b> ice <b>shelf</b> via ice ramps along one or more sides of the feature.|$|R
50|$|The {{floating}} level {{can be thought}} of as the water level in a hole drilled through the ice into the lake. It is equivalent to the level at which a piece of the ice over it would float if it were <b>a</b> normal ice <b>shelf.</b> The ceiling can therefore be conceived as <b>an</b> ice <b>shelf</b> that is grounded along its entire perimeter, which explains why it has been called <b>a</b> captured ice <b>shelf.</b> <b>As</b> it moves over the lake, it enters the lake at the floating line, and it leaves the lake at the grounding line.|$|R

5|$|Sweet onions have {{a greater}} water and sugar content than cooking onions. This makes them sweeter and milder tasting, but reduces their shelf life. Sweet onions can be stored refrigerated; they have <b>a</b> <b>shelf</b> life of around 1 month. Irrespective of type, any cut pieces of onion are best tightly wrapped, stored away from other produce, and used within two to three days.|$|E
5|$|Unbeknownst to them, Harold is {{following}} Merrigan's truck and calls the police. At a warehouse, Harold grabs a gun from <b>a</b> <b>shelf</b> and Dr. Kroger gestures for Harold to shoot Merrigan and his accomplice, who are emptying the vacuum bag {{to destroy the}} evidence. However, Harold makes some noise. As Merrigan prepares to shoot Harold, the police arrive to arrest Merrigan, but just then, he shoots at Dr. Kroger. Harold intercepts the bullet in his chest and Merrigan is taken away.|$|E
5|$|Franck found a {{position}} at the Polytekniske Læreanstalt in Copenhagen for Arthur von Hippel, who was now his son in law, having married his daughter Dagmar. He decided to provide financial security for his children by dividing his Nobel Prize money between them. The gold medal itself was entrusted to Niels Bohr for safekeeping. When Germany invaded Denmark on 9 April 1940, the Hungarian chemist George de Hevesy dissolved the gold medal, along with that of Max von Laue in aqua regia to prevent the Germans from taking them. He placed the resulting solution on <b>a</b> <b>shelf</b> in his laboratory at the Niels Bohr Institute. After the war, he returned to find the solution undisturbed and precipitated the gold out of the acid. The Nobel Society then recast the Nobel Prize medals.|$|E

5|$|In 1928, {{a man in}} Portland, Oregon, invented an {{electric}} pancake machine that operated {{by the process of}} batter being dropped onto a revolving heated flattop grill from a storage cylinder atop the grill. The grill was heated using electricity. The amount of batter dropped was controlled by using controlled amounts of compressed air, which pushed batter out of the storage cylinder. As the batter revolved on the hot grill, the pancake was flipped halfway through the cooking process by <b>a</b> <b>shelf</b> atop the grill. After being flipped, the completed pancake was ejected from the machine upon contact with a gate.|$|E
5|$|Several weeks later, Kevin tells Wendy of his {{research}} about the explosion of Flight 180 and the subsequent deaths of the survivors, believing that the survivors of Devil's Flight are in a similar situation. Thinking that Kevin is deriding her, Wendy dismisses his theory and leaves. Ashley and Ashlyn are later killed in a tanning salon when their tanning beds short circuit. Then, <b>a</b> <b>shelf</b> falls, trapping them inside, and the girls are burned alive.

5|$|The {{adults of}} some Australian cicada {{are subject to}} a cicada-specific fungus from the genus Massospora, which grows on their {{genitalia}} and abdominal cavity, eventually causing the tail end to drop off. Australian cicadas are further preyed on by the cicada killer wasp (Exeirus lateritius), which stings and paralyses cicadas high in the trees. Their victims drop to the ground where the cicada-hunter mounts and carries them, pushing with its hind legs, sometimes over a distance of 100m (330ft). They are then shoved into the hunter's burrow, where the helpless cicada is placed on <b>a</b> <b>shelf</b> in an often extensive 'catacomb', to form food-stock for the wasp grub growing from the eggs deposited within.|$|E

5|$|The anteroconid on m1 (the frontmost cusp, {{corresponding}} to the anterocone) contains an internal hollow, an anteromedian fossettid. There is an ectolophid, an accessory crest in the valley between the protoconid (the cusp on the labial side, behind the anteroconid) and the hypoconid (the cusp behind the protoconid, at the back labial corner of the tooth). On {{the other side of}} the tooth, the mesolophid (another accessory crest) is also present. On each of the lower molars, an anterolabial cingulum (<b>a</b> <b>shelf</b> on the front labial corner) is present. On m2 and m3, an anterolophid is present—a crest in front of the metaconid (the cusp on the front lingual corner of the tooth).|$|E
