He also grew up in the company of such family friends as the philosophers William James and Josiah Royce. He graduated from Harvard University in 1915 and then received an advanced degree from Harvard in 1916.

25|$|Also in 1966, Ivan Sutherland {{continued}} to innovate at MIT when he invented the first computer controlled head-mounted display (HMD). Called the Sword of Damocles {{because of the}} hardware required for support, it displayed two separate wireframe images, one for each eye. This allowed the viewer to see the computer scene in stereoscopic 3D. After receiving his Ph.D. from MIT, Sutherland became Director of Information Processing at ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency), and later became <b>a</b> <b>professor</b> <b>at</b> <b>Harvard.</b> In 1967 Sutherland was recruited by Evans to join the computer science program at the University of Utah - a development which would turn that department {{into one of the}} most important research centers in graphics for nearly a decade thereafter, eventually producing some of the most important pioneers in the field. There Sutherland perfected his HMD; twenty years later, NASA would re-discover his techniques in their virtual reality research. At Utah, Sutherland and Evans were highly sought after consultants by large companies, but they were frustrated at the lack of graphics hardware available at the time so they started formulating a plan to start their own company.|$|E
500|$|A {{few weeks}} after Ulam reached Los Alamos in February 1944, the project {{experienced}} a crisis. [...] In April, Emilio Segrè discovered that plutonium made in reactors would not work in a gun-type plutonium weapon like the [...] "Thin Man", which was being developed in parallel with a uranium weapon, the [...] "Little Boy" [...] that was dropped on Hiroshima. [...] This problem threatened to waste an enormous investment in new reactors at the Hanford site and to make slow separation of uranium isotopes {{the only way to}} prepare fissile material suitable for use in bombs. [...] To respond, Oppenheimer implemented, in August, a sweeping reorganization of the laboratory to focus on development of an implosion-type weapon and appointed George Kistiakowsky head of the implosion department. [...] He was <b>a</b> <b>professor</b> <b>at</b> <b>Harvard</b> and an expert on precise use of explosives.|$|E
