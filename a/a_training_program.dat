5|$|Campbell {{moved from}} Seattle to San Francisco in 1975, {{getting a job}} in a {{hospital}} near The Castro and immersing himself in the political and social life of the community, which had become a center for the LGBT community over the previous few years. By 1981, he had enrolled in <b>a</b> <b>training</b> <b>program</b> at University of California, San Francisco, to become an adult health nurse practitioner, with a view to focusing on healthcare in the gay and lesbian community.|$|E
5|$|Casualties in Greece {{included}} Mackay's son-in-law, Captain W. H. Travers, who {{was captured}} in the Battle of Crete. Mackay resolved to reform the battalions that had been destroyed in Greece, and to rebuild his shattered division from the remnants that had been evacuated to Alexandria. He developed <b>a</b> <b>training</b> <b>program</b> in Syria in which he attempted to apply {{the lessons of the}} campaign in Greece.|$|E
5|$|In August 2010, General Motors began <b>a</b> <b>training</b> <b>program</b> {{for first}} {{responders}} when performing rescue duties involving the Chevrolet Volt. The program {{began at the}} 2010 Fire-Rescue International in Chicago, using a pre-production Volt for a live extrication exercise. Chicago firefighters demonstrated the sequence of tasks required to safely disable the vehicle’s powertrain and its 12-volt electrical system, which controls its high-voltage components, and then proceed to extricate injured occupants. , additional training workshops {{had taken place in}} several other cities corresponding to the Volt's initial launch markets. An Emergency Response Guide for the 2011 Volt was made available at its Service Technical College for use by emergency responders. The guide also describes methods of disabling the high voltage system and identifies cut zone information.|$|E

5|$|McNair had {{difficulty}} implementing <b>a</b> <b>training</b> <b>program</b> for National Guard units, chiefly {{because of their}} lack of prior military experience other than monthly drills and short annual training periods. He recommended a wholesale demobilization of the National Guard; Marshall and the Secretary of War disagreed, partly because they anticipated political backlash, and partly because the manpower they provided was in demand. McNair also found National Guard senior commanders wanting; in his view, National Guard officers should not progress beyond the grade of colonel, and professional full-time officers should command at the division level and above. In this, he was mostly successful; all but two National Guard division commanders were replaced by regular Army officers, and most National Guard generals carried out stateside assignments, or non-combat overseas assignments. Some served in roles below division commander (such as assistant division commander), or carried out administrative and training roles, such as provost marshal or school commandant. In addition, some accepted reductions in rank so they could serve in overseas assignments.|$|E
5|$|The 19th Air Brigade's {{primary mission}} was to defend the {{industrial}} facilities in northern Kyūshū, and particularly the iron works at Yawata. The brigade's plans {{for the defense of}} the Western District called for its interceptor aircraft to be concentrated over Yawata and not move far from the area. While this inflexible deployment was considered unsatisfactory by the 19th Air Brigade, it was deemed necessary as few aircraft were available, the only searchlight units needed to facilitate night operations were stationed near Yawata and northern Kyūshū was regarded by the Army as being the most important region in the Western District. Prior to the raid on Yawata the 19th Air Brigade undertook joint planning with anti-aircraft units and implemented <b>a</b> <b>training</b> <b>program</b> which included practice in responding to alerts and night flying.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} was highly {{supportive of the}} war efforts. The political left supported the war (unlike World War I, which Socialists opposed.) The churches showed much less pacifism than in 1914. The Church of God, based in Anderson, had a strong pacifist element, reaching a high point in the late 1930s. The Church regarded World War II as a just war because America was attacked. Anti-Communist sentiment has since kept strong pacifism from developing in the Church of God. Likewise the Quakers, with a strong base near Richmond, generally regarded World War II as a just war and about 90% served, although there were some conscientious objectors. The Mennonites and Brethren continued their pacifism, but {{the federal government was}} much less hostile than before. The churches helped their young men to both become conscientious objectors and to provide valuable service to the nation. Goshen College set up <b>a</b> <b>training</b> <b>program</b> for unpaid Civilian Public Service jobs. Although the young women pacifists were not liable to the draft, they volunteered for unpaid Civilian Public Service jobs to demonstrate their patriotism; many worked in mental hospitals.|$|E

5|$|Waleed al-Shehri was {{reported}} to have been found alive by a BBC News article on September 23, 2001, and other news reports {{in the aftermath of the}} September 11 attacks. Reports said that the Shehri brothers were the sons of a Saudi diplomat stationed in New Delhi, Ahmed al-Shehri. The diplomat's son was trained as a pilot at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Florida, and was working as a pilot for Saudi Arabian Airlines. At the time of the attacks, he was in Morocco for <b>a</b> <b>training</b> <b>program.</b> There were also reports that Wail al-Shehri was a trained pilot. In the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, Saudi officials suggested that Wail and Waleed al-Shehri were victims of identity theft, but the diplomat's son was the victim of mistaken identity.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent B-29 raids staging through China {{generally}} did {{not meet}} their objectives. The second raid took place on 7July when 17 B-29s attacked Sasebo, Ōmura and Tobata, causing little damage, and {{on the night of}} 10/11August 24 Superfortresses attacked Nagasaki. Another unsuccessful raid was conducted against Yawata on 20August in which the B-29 force was intercepted by over 100 fighters. Twelve of the sixty-one Superfortresses that reached the target area were shot down, including one which was destroyed in a suicide ramming attack. Japanese government propaganda claimed that 100 bombers had been downed during this attack, and one of the crashed B-29s was placed on display in Tokyo. XXBomber Command's performance improved after LeMay instituted <b>a</b> <b>training</b> <b>program</b> and improved the organization of the B-29 maintenance units during August and September. A raid against Ōmura on 25October destroyed the city's small aircraft factory, though a follow-up raid on 11November ended in failure. The city was attacked again by 61 B-29s on 21November and by 17 bombers on 19December. XXBomber Command made its ninth and final raid on Japan on 6January 1945 when 28 B-29s once again struck Ōmura. During the same period the command conducted a number of attacks on targets in Manchuria, China and Formosa from its bases in China, as well as striking targets in Southeast Asia from India. The command flew its final mission from India, a raid on Singapore, on 29March; its constituent units were then transferred to the Mariana Islands.|$|E

40|$|Class of 2017 AbstractObjectives: To {{determine}} whether pharmacy {{students were more}} willing to receive, administer, recommend and counsel patients about vaccinations after completing <b>an</b> immunization <b>training</b> <b>program</b> Methods: Anonymous and voluntary questionnaires administered on paper during a regularly scheduled class collected ratings of confidence on the willingness of first year pharmacy students to receive, administer, recommend and counsel about vaccinations prior to and {{after the completion of}} <b>an</b> immunization <b>training</b> <b>program.</b> Data on gender, age range, status of completion and source of the immunization <b>training</b> <b>program</b> completed was also collected. This study was approved by the University of Arizona Institutional Review Board (IRB). Results: Questionnaires were completed by 110 students at the Tucson and Phoenix campus. Students were equally willing (p= 0. 235) to receive all vaccinations, even if they were not required to by the UA COP, before and after the immunization <b>training</b> <b>program.</b> There was <b>a</b> statistically significant difference in the willingness to administer (p< 0. 001), to recommend (p= 0. 024) and to counsel (p< 0. 001) about vaccinations after completion of <b>an</b> immunization <b>training</b> <b>program.</b> Conclusions: Completing <b>an</b> immunization <b>training</b> <b>program</b> did not have influence on the willingness of pharmacy students to receive vaccinations. However, the results suggest pharmacy students are more willing to administer, recommend and counsel about vaccinations after the completion of <b>an</b> immunization <b>training</b> <b>program...</b>|$|R
