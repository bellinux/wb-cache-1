40|$|Contemporary {{approaches}} to cross-platform mobile application development, such as hybrid apps from PhoneGap and generated native apps from Xamarin, show promise in reducing development time towards Android, iOS and other platforms. At the same time, {{studies show that}} there are various problems associated with these approaches, including suffering user experiences and codebases {{that are difficult to}} maintain and test properly. In this thesis, a novel prototype framework called Building Blocks was developed with the purpose of investigating the feasibility of utilizing component-based software engineering in solving this problem. The prototype was developed towards Android along with a web interface that allowed users to assemble an Android app using software components. The report concludes that component-based software engineering can be – and already is – utilized successfully to improve cross-platform mobile <b>app</b> <b>development</b> <b>with</b> special regards to user experience. Qualitative data indicate that Building Blocks as a concept is flexible and shows promise for mobile <b>app</b> <b>development</b> in which functionality is often reused, such as enterprise apps. Rapid prototyping using the web-based visual editing tool was another promising area. However, future use of Building Blocks would require further work on the prototype to improve its ease of use. ...|$|R

However, most mobile diabetes applications (Apps) do not include personalised patient education, a key facet of diabetes self-management. We sought the views and ideas of young people with type 1 diabetes to enable the design of innovative new Apps which might help to improve their quality of life. This project highlights an innovative, patient-centric approach to the development and production of a health based mobile App concerning diabetes education about alcohol. Methods Data collected by semi-structured, in-depth qualitative interviews (n= 9) of people with type 1 diabetes aged 18 - 21. Interviews were transcribed and loaded onto the qualitative data analysis tool NVivo. Baseline data analysis was undertaken to locate potential ideas for mobile <b>App</b> <b>development,</b> <b>with</b> suggestions chosen needing to reflect interviewee requirements and to meet clinic goals. Results Interviewees suggested that they would find a guide which could be accessed via a mobile device about alcohol limits {{and the effects of}} alcohol on their diabetes particularly useful on a night out. An App about alcohol and diabetes, ‘Start Safe, Stay Safe’, was developed with further input from young people with type 1 diabetes and clinic staff. Summary In developing a mobile App about alcohol and diabetes, we have shown how young people with type 1 diabetes can participate effectively in the design and implementation of new technology which they can then use to improve their quality of life...|$|R
40|$|The {{valorisation}} of {{the urban}} heritage is presently one of main topics discussed, mostly in the theme related conferences, treaties, conventions and programs. Mobile platforms (especially smartphones and tablets) may be very useful technological means for the agents in the territory. Admitting these assumptions, we created an information model for a mobile application (<b>app)</b> <b>development,</b> <b>with</b> a specific theme (water and city) that represents and describes architectural elements of a city. The selected architectural elements are those related with the water supply system in Lisbon built from XVIII to the XIX century. The inclusion of these elements in a mobile platform requires 3 D modelling, improving the visualization and alphanumeric information access (e. g. historical) very useful to the agents (in particular to the city visitors). 3 D models were created based on terrestrial and UAV surveys, considering rapid and authentic data acquisition. The stages of building the models were: i) Data acquisition (UAV - flight planning and image acquisition); ii) Data processing; iii) Data visualization (App/AR). The created models are very realistic. However, the results may differ when processing the data in different software, especially concerning the level of detail. The technical challenge is to simplify the models to use in mobile platforms and maintain the level of realism. The Communication will present {{a case study of}} 3 D modelling with UAV data and their representation in an Augmented Reality environment through mobile platforms...|$|R
40|$|Aim/Purpose: Despite {{millions}} of apps on the market, {{it is still}} challenging to develop a mobile app that can run across platforms using the same code. Background: This paper explores a potential solution for developing cross platform apps by presenting the hybrid app approach. Methodology: The paper first describes a brief evolution of the different mobile <b>app</b> <b>development</b> approaches and then compares them with the hybrid app approach. Next, it focuses on one specific hybrid <b>app</b> <b>development</b> framework called Ionic. Contribution: The paper presents the hybrid app approach as an emerging trend in mobile <b>app</b> <b>development</b> and concludes <b>with</b> the highlight of its advantages and teaching implications. Findings: The hybrid app approach reduces the learning curve and offers tools to allow the reuse of code to create apps for different mobile devices. Recommendations for Practitioners: The experience that the paper describes in using Ionic framework to create a hybrid app can be adopted in a web design or mobile <b>app</b> <b>development</b> course. Impact on Society	: The advance in hybrid framework {{in general and the}} growing acceptance of open source framework, such as Ionic in particular, may provide an alternative to the native app domination and may trigger the rapid rise of hybrid apps in the years to come...|$|R

Behind the scenes, the platform innovates by drawing content from a remote geo-database that relates to your specific location – this means that more information can be accessed locally than can fit into a normal app, making it scalable for urban, national or even international content. The platform was developed during the AHRC REACT Hub 'Heritage Sandbox' scheme in collaboration with creative economy partner Jo Reid at Calvium who used the sandbox process to explore how this functionality could enhance their AppFurnace <b>app</b> <b>development</b> tool <b>with</b> a new capability. Research and development was undertaken to explore streaming data live into an app from a GIS database, contributing to the GIS database form within the app, background location tracking, authoring multiple hotspots and push notifications.

40|$|Background: Many {{cultural}} and linguistic Deaf people in South Africa face disparity when accessing health information because {{of social and}} language barriers. The number of certified South African Sign Language interpreters (SASLIs) is also insufficient {{to meet the demand}} of the Deaf population in the country. Our research team, in collaboration with the Deaf communities in Cape Town, devised a mobile health app called SignSupport to bridge the communication gaps in health care contexts. We consequently plan to extend our work with a Health Knowledge Transfer System (HKTS) to provide Deaf people with accessible, understandable, and accurate health information. We conducted an explorative study to prepare the groundwork for the design and development of the system. Objectives: To investigate the current modes of health information distributed to Deaf people in Cape Town, identify the health information sources Deaf people prefer and their reasons, and define effective techniques for delivering understandable information to generate the groundwork for the mobile health <b>app</b> <b>development</b> <b>with</b> and for Deaf people. Methods: A qualitative methodology using semistructured interviews with sensitizing tools was used in a community-based codesign setting. A total of 23 Deaf people and 10 health professionals participated in this study. Inductive and deductive coding was used for the analysis. Results: Deaf people currently have access to 4 modes of health information distribution through: Deaf and other relevant organizations, hearing health professionals, personal interactions, and the mass media. Their preferred and accessible sources are those delivering information in signed language and with communication techniques that match Deaf people’s communication needs. Accessible and accurate health information can be delivered to Deaf people by 3 effective techniques: using signed language including its dialects, through health drama with its combined techniques, and accompanying the information with pictures in combination with simple text descriptions. Conclusions: We can apply the knowledge gained from this exploration to build the groundwork of the mobile health information system. We see an opportunity to design an HKTS to assist the information delivery during the patient-health professional interactions in primary health care settings. Deaf people want to understand the information relevant to their diagnosed disease and its self-management. The 3 identified effective techniques will be applied to deliver health information through the mobile health app. Design for Sustainabilit...|$|R
