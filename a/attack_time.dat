25|$|Since {{the samples}} are {{recorded}} in different pitches, pitch conversion is required when concatenating the samples. The engine calculates a desired pitch from the notes, <b>attack</b> <b>time,</b> and vibrato parameters, and then selects the necessary {{samples from the}} library.|$|E
25|$|Compression and {{limiting}} are identical in process but different in degree and perceived effect. A limiter is a compressor {{with a high}} ratio and, generally, a fast <b>attack</b> <b>time.</b> Compression with ratio of 10:1 or more is generally considered limiting.|$|E
50|$|The SLAM {{has four}} {{possible}} modes of detonation—bottom <b>attack,</b> side <b>attack,</b> <b>timed</b> demolition, and command detonation.|$|R
50|$|<b>Time</b> <b>attack</b> and <b>time</b> trial events {{differ by}} {{competition}} format and rules. <b>Time</b> <b>attack</b> has {{a limited number}} of laps, time trial has open sessions.|$|R

25|$|A {{dedicated}} {{electronic hardware}} unit or audio software that applies compression {{is called a}} compressor. In the 2000s, compressors became available as software plugins that run in digital audio workstation software. In recorded and live music, compression parameters may be adjusted {{to change the way}} they affect sounds. Compression and limiting are identical in process but different in degree and perceived effect. A limiter is a compressor with a high ratio and, generally, a fast <b>attack</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{length of}} each period is {{determined}} by the rate of change and the required change in gain. For more intuitive operation, a compressor's attack and release controls are labeled as a unit of time (often milliseconds). This is the amount of time it takes for the gain to change a set amount of dB, decided by the manufacturer—often 10dB. For example, if the compressor's time constants are referenced to 10dB, and the <b>attack</b> <b>time</b> is set to 1ms, it takes 1ms for the gain to decrease by 10dB, and 2ms to decrease by 20dB.|$|E
25|$|The {{mission was}} to be {{launched}} at 08:00 June 23 (all times local time zone), with strikes beginning at 09:30 at all targets. However weather reconnaissance aircraft reported unbroken clouds over the Yalu River, and Weyland postponed the attack at 07:40. As the morning passed, however, the weather system moved south, and Weyland immediately reversed himself and at 13:00 ordered the attacks to proceed, using the heavy clouds as concealment for the attackers en route to their targets, with a new <b>attack</b> <b>time</b> of 16:00.|$|E
50|$|Disgust: In {{comparison}} to neutral speech, disgust is produced with a lower, downward directed pitch, with energy (500 Hz), lower first formant, and fast <b>attack</b> <b>times</b> similar to anger. Less variation and shorter durations are also characteristics of disgust.|$|R

In addition to this, Rado also partipicates in <b>time</b> <b>attack</b> events in a tC particularly in Global <b>Time</b> <b>Attack</b> (GTA) <b>time</b> <b>attack</b> and Super Street Super Lap Battles.|$|R
40|$|Intelligent attackers in {{collaborative}} {{spectrum sensing}} system could act as honest users to conceal themselves and start malicious behavior abruptly since an unpredictable time slot. Affected by honest behavior before <b>attacking</b> <b>time,</b> traditional malicious behavior detection (MBD) algorithms are not agile enough {{to identify the}} abrupt change of behavior. To alleviate this challenge, in this paper, we propose the Rao test-based malicious behavior detection (RT-MBD) algorithm, which could detect the malicious behavior with unknown parameter and unknown starting time. The proposed RT-MBD is not affected by honest behavior before <b>attacking</b> <b>time</b> and has a shorter detection delay with constraint of a certain false alarm rate than conventional algorithms. Performance of RT-MBD is validated by both mathematical proof and numerical experiments...|$|R
25|$|In 2000, Alex Biryukov, Adi Shamir and David Wagner {{showed that}} A5/1 can be cryptanalysed {{in real time}} using a time-memory {{tradeoff}} attack, based on earlier work by Jovan Golic. One tradeoff allows an attacker to reconstruct the key in one second from two minutes of known plaintext or in several minutes from two seconds of known plain text, but he must first complete an expensive preprocessing stage which requires 248 steps to compute around 300 GB of data. Several tradeoffs between preprocessing, data requirements, <b>attack</b> <b>time</b> and memory complexity are possible.|$|E

Platoon commander, 1st Lt. George King was awarded the Silver Star for his leadership during the defense of the town. For the remainder of the month, the companies, supporting the infantry regiments, moved on a seven-mile front to within three miles of the Saar River near Saarlautern.|$|E

2500|$|Brick wall {{limiting}} has a {{very high}} ratio and a very fast <b>attack</b> <b>time.</b> Ideally, this ensures that an audio signal never exceeds the amplitude of the threshold. Ratios of 20:1 [...] {{all the way up}} to ∞:1 are considered 'brick wall'. [...] The sonic results of more than momentary and infrequent hard/brick-wall limiting are harsh and unpleasant, thus it is more common as a safety device in live sound and broadcast applications.|$|E
2500|$|An early {{implementation}} of ADSR {{can be found}} on the Hammond Novachord in 1938 (which predates the first Moog synthesizer by over 25 years). [...] A seven-position rotary knob set preset ADS parameter for all 72 notes; a pedal controlled release time. [...] The notion of ADSR was specified by Vladimir Ussachevsky (then head of the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center) in 1965 while suggesting improvements for Bob Moog's pioneering work on synthesizers, although the earlier notations of parameter were (T1, T2, Esus, T3), then these were simplified to current form (<b>Attack</b> <b>time,</b> Decay time, Sustain level, Release time) by ARP.|$|E

2500|$|Following his {{departure}} from TNA, New Japan announced on August 13, 2012, that Shelley would {{be returning to}} the promotion the following month. Before Shelley's return to Japan, he and A.J. Kirsch unsuccessfully challenged Forever Hooligans (Alex Koslov and Rocky Romero) for the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship on August 26 at a Sacramento Wrestling Federation (SWF) event in Gridley, California. Following the match, Kushida saved Shelley from a beatdown {{at the hands of}} Koslov and Romero. Shelley wrestled his New Japan return match on September 7, when he, Bushi, Máscara Dorada and Ryusuke Taguchi were defeated in an eight-man tag team match by Alex Koslov, Averno, Low Ki and Rocky Romero. Afterwards, Shelley continued teaming with Kushida with the two forming the tag team [...] "Time Splitters" [...] and scoring several wins over Koslov and Romero in multiple man teamed matches, after debuting their new double-team finishing maneuver, the I-94. On October 8 at King of Pro-Wrestling, Time Splitters unsuccessfully challenged Forever Hooligans for the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship. On October 21, the Time Splitters entered the 2012 Super Jr. Tag Tournament, defeating Jado & Gedo in their first round match. On November 2, Shelley and Kushida defeated Suzuki-gun (Taichi and Taka Michinoku) to advance to the finals, where, later that same day, they defeated Apollo 55 to win the tournament and become the number one contenders to the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship. On November 11 at Power Struggle, the Time Splitters defeated Forever Hooligans in a rematch to win the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship. Time Splitters made their first successful title defense on February 10, 2013, at The New Beginning, defeating Forever Hooligans in the third title match between the two teams. Their second successful defense took place on March 3 at New Japan's 41st anniversary event, where they defeated Jushin Thunder Liger and Tiger Mask. On April 5, Shelley received his first shot at the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship, but was defeated by the defending champion, Prince Devitt. Two days later at Invasion <b>Attack,</b> <b>Time</b> Splitters defeated Devitt and Ryusuke Taguchi for their third successful defense of the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship. On May 3 at Wrestling Dontaku 2013, Time Splitters lost the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship back to the Forever Hooligans in their fourth defense.|$|E
