5|$|On August 30, 1987, Parsons was hitchhiking along Interstate 15 near Barstow, California. He {{was picked}} up by 30-year-old Richard Lynn Ernest, a {{concrete}} laborer from Loma Linda, California {{on his way to a}} construction job in Denver, Colorado. Ernest did not know that Parsons was a fugitive. At about 3 a.m. on August 31, Ernest was too tired to drive and stopped at the Lunt Park rest area near Cedar City, Utah to get some sleep. Parsons stabbed Ernest to death <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> <b>off</b> in his blue Dodge Omni.|$|E
5|$|At {{first light}} on 6 November, Carlson and his command group, {{two of his}} companies, {{and a group of}} native scouts and {{carriers}} commanded by Major John Mather of the Australian Army and Sergeant Major Jacob C. Vouza of the Solomon Islands Police Force set out from Aola on the patrol. The group marched along a jungle trail northwest to the Reko River, arriving on 7 November. At the Reko, Carlson learned that the local Christian mission had recently been raided by Japanese troops who had killed two of the missionaries before moving west. Pushing across the river with one platoon of troops, Carlson encountered a small group of Japanese who shot and severely wounded the native scout leading the Marine column. Returning fire, the Marines killed two Japanese soldiers <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> <b>off</b> another three or four. Carlson's main body then arrived and the column bivouacked for the night.|$|E

5|$|On August 6, 2015, police {{released}} a video {{from the night}} before the theft, that is believed to show a dry run of the robbery. Two men appear on the tape; one of them remains unidentified, while the other has been confirmed as Richard Abath, a security guard on duty the night of the heist. The video appears to show Abath buzzing the unidentified man into the museum twice within a few minutes. The man stayed for about three minutes in the lobby, then returned to a car <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> <b>off.</b> Police say the video opens new lines of investigation, and The New York Times points out that it draws new attention to Abath as a potential collaborator. However, the guards have previously been interviewed and deemed too unimaginative to have pulled off the heist.|$|E
5|$|As a {{personal}} cavalry escort, Constantius provided Julian with 200 scholares, a regiment of cataphractarii (heavily armoured cavalry) and some mounted archers (in total 360 men). En route to Gaul from Milan, at Taurini (Turin), {{he received the}} calamitous news that Cologne, Rome's most important city and military fortress on the Rhine, had fallen to the Franks. He spent the winter of 355/356 with his escorting troops at Vienna (Vienne), not far South of Lugdunum (Lyons). For the 356 campaigning season, Julian's first task was to link up with the main Gaul comitatus, which had wintered at Remi (Reims) {{under the command of}} the magister equitum, Ursicinus' recently appointed successor, Marcellus. This involved a long march through country swarming with Alamanni raiding bands, many of which were as large or larger than Julian's own escort and expert at ambuscades. On the way, Julian surprised <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> <b>off</b> a large barbarian force that had surrounded Augustodunum (Autun) and defeated a raiding band in the Morvan wilderness.|$|E
5|$|Hill faced further {{problems}} as he {{planned for the}} operation. The American pilots of the Dakota transport aircraft that would transport the battalion were inexperienced and had never conducted a parachute drop before, {{and there was no}} time for any training or exercises. There were also no photos of the airfield or the surrounding areas, and only a single, smallscale map available for navigation. To ensure that the aircraft found the dropzone and delivered the battalion accurately, Hill sat in the cockpit of the leading Dakota and assisted the pilot. The Dakotas were escorted by four American P-38 Lightning fighters, which engaged <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> <b>off</b> two roving German fighters, but as the Dakotas approached the Tunisian border they encountered thick clouds and were forced to turn back, landing at Maison Blanche at 11:00. It was decided that the battalion would conduct the operation the next day, which allowed the paratroopers to rest for a night. 1st Parachute Battalion took off on the morning of 16 November, and enjoyed excellent weather that allowed the transport aircraft to drop the battalion accurately around the airfield at Souk elArba. Most of the paratroopers landed successfully, but one man was killed when his rigging line twisted around his neck middrop, throttling him; one officer broke his leg on landing, and four men were wounded when a Sten gun was accidentally fired. The battalion's secondincommand, Major Alastair Pearson, remained at the airfield with a small detachment that collected the airborne equipment and supervised the burial of the casualty.|$|E

To ensure that the aircraft found the dropzone and delivered the battalion accurately, Hill decided that he would sit in the cockpit of the leading Dakota and assist the pilot. Despite the battalion's parachutes only arriving at 16:30 on 14 November, and were packed twelve to a container which meant they had to be removed and individually repacked, the battalion was prepared by 15 November and took off at 07:30. The Dakotas were escorted by four American P-38 Lightning fighters, which engaged <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> <b>off</b> two roving German fighters, but as the Dakotas approached the Tunisian border, they encountered thick clouds and were forced to turn back, landing at Maison Blanche at 11:00. It was decided that the battalion would conduct the operation the next day, which allowed the paratroopers to rest for a night. At the same time, 2nd Battalion of the 509th PIR successfully conducted a drop at Tebessa, capturing its objectives and securing the area; it then passed from the control of 1st Parachute Brigade and remained in the area for some time. 1st Parachute Battalion took off on the morning of 16 November, and encountered excellent weather which allowed the transport aircraft to drop the battalion accurately around the airfield at Souk elArba. Most of the paratroopers landed successfully, but one man was killed when his rigging line twisted around his neck middrop, throttling him; one officer broke his leg on landing, and four men were wounded when a Sten gun was accidentally fired.

25|$|In 1872 the {{indigenous}} leader Calfucurá and his 6,000 followers attacked {{the cities of}} General Alvear, Veinticinco de Mayo and Nueve de Julio.

25|$|In the 1790s, {{a whiskey}} excise tax was {{imposed by the}} United States federal government.

After a series of demonstrations by farmers, President George Washington sent troops to stop the rebellion.|$|E
60|$|So saying, he strolled {{carelessly}} {{back to the}} bullock cart, waited {{till the}} animals had finished their feed, <b>and</b> then <b>drove</b> <b>off</b> again; returned the cart to its owner, and started again for Poona.|$|R

25|$|The {{first step}} was to connect Buenos Aires and the Fortines (fortresses) with {{telegraph}} lines. The government signed a peace treaty with chieftain Juan José Catriel. But he broke it a short time later, as together with chieftain Namuncurá and 3,500 warriors, he attacked Tres Arroyos, Tandil, Azul, and other towns and farms. The casualties were higher than in 1872: Catriel and Namuncurá's forces killed 400 settlers, captured 300, <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> <b>off</b> 300,000 head of cattle.|$|E
25|$|In August 1624, Spanish General Don Ambrosio Spinola {{ordered the}} Dutch city of Breda besieged by his forces. The city of Breda was heavily {{fortified}} and defended by a garrison of 7,000 Dutch soldiers. Spinola rapidly gathered his defences <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> <b>off</b> a Dutch relief army under Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange, who {{was attempting to}} cut off his supplies. In February 1625, another relief force, consisting of 7,000 English soldiers under Sir Horace Vere and Ernst von Mansfeld, was also defeated.|$|E

25|$|Lusignan, Saint-Julien, and Alois Liechtenstein {{called for}} another effort. One of Vukassovich's hussar regiments swept {{out of the}} woods, heading for the 57th Line's flank. The left {{battalion}} of the 57th formed square <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> <b>off</b> the horsemen. With their generals displaying front-line leadership, the Austrian attack roared {{out of the woods}} and fell on the French troops lining the first ridge. The push collapsed in the face of converging musketry from the defenders' concave line and a thrust against its left flank by the 3rd Line.|$|E
25|$|Afterwards, Gelman {{abandoned}} DiCrescento's car {{just before}} 1:00a.m. of February 12 and hailed a livery cab before stabbing its driver, Fitz Fullerton. He then approached another {{car with a}} couple inside and attacked the driver, Shelden Pottinger, stabbing him multiple times in the hand. He then stole Pottinger's vehicle <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> <b>off</b> in it. After boarding a northbound 3 train at 34th Street - Penn Station just after 8:00a.m., he stabbed Joseph Lozito, a ticket seller at Lincoln Center. By this time, passengers recognized him from a newspaper article about his killing spree and notified authorities.|$|E
25|$|During {{the ride}} the car passed several service {{stations}} {{but the man}} did not stop. For about 90 minutes he drove back and forth around the backroads near Tracy. When Johns asked why he was not stopping, he would change the subject. When the driver finally stopped at an intersection, Johns jumped out with her daughter and hid in a field. The driver searched for her using his flashlight telling her {{that he would not}} hurt her, before eventually giving up. Unable to find her, he got back into the car <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> <b>off.</b> Johns hitched a ride to the police station in Patterson.|$|E
