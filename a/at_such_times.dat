5|$|The A3 {{section of}} Zagreb bypass is {{currently}} the busiest section of the Croatian motorway network, with annual average daily traffic (AADT) volume exceeding 40,000vehicles, leading to congestion of the six-lane bypass at peak hours, especially during the summer, when tourist traffic adds to the congestion. The mainline toll plazas at Bobovica and Ivanja Reka can both become bottlenecks <b>at</b> <b>such</b> <b>times.</b> The alternative to the bypass is going through the city via Ljubljanska, Zagrebačka and Slavonska avenues. Despite being a shorter and a more direct route, those avenues are much more congested than the bypass at rush hours and they contain at-grade intersections and traffic lights at some of their junctions.|$|E

25|$|A forest butterfly, {{the brown}} awl favours {{openings}} and edges of deciduous and evergreen forests while its caterpillars {{are to be}} found in moist deciduous and semi-evergreen forests.

It can be sometimes seen in bright sunlight visiting flowers, such as Glycosmis, Buddleia, Chromolaena and Lantana, but is very wary and energetic <b>at</b> <b>such</b> <b>times,</b> moving jerkily and rapidly between flowers or across inflorescences. It can also be seen mud-puddling or at bird droppings.|$|E

25|$|The framed tent (1965–1967). This is {{the largest}} and most {{colorful}} of the Westfalia side tents. It's different from the earlier small and large awning-based tents in two important ways: the addition of large, screened windows on the side curtains, and a free-standing frame that allows the tent to be left at the campsite while the bus is driven away for groceries or side trips. The tent also has a rear door that can be zipped closed <b>at</b> <b>such</b> <b>times.</b> Both front and rear flaps can be rolled up and held open by cloth ties or (on later models) straps with lift-the-dot fasteners.|$|E

25|$|Traffic on the Trent and Mersey {{main line}} {{was such that}} it {{suffered}} from water shortage in dry periods, and water levels on the Caldon branch were often too low <b>at</b> <b>such</b> <b>times,</b> as the water was used to keep the main line moving. In 1796, the company {{wanted to build a}} reservoir at Rudyard, to improve the situation, and a branch to Leek was included in the Bill, as {{it was the only way}} to obtain the consent of the Leek authorities and landowners for the reservoir. The Bill was defeated in Parliament, after which the Peak Forest Canal Company proposed to build a branch of their canal from Marple to Leek, and on to join the Caldon branch. It would also have included a reservoir at Rudyard, but the plan was short-lived, as the Trent and Mersey succeeded in getting their bill passed when they submitted it to Parliament for a second time in 1797. To ensure that the water from Rudyard could be used to supply the main line, the Leek branch had to join the top level of the Caldon branch, and so the original route with the three Park Lane locks was closed and a new route built, with a three-lock staircase between the junction and the old line of the canal. This was altered again in 1841 to the present arrangement, where the canal to Froghall passes under an aqueduct on the Leek branch, and three separate locks at Hollinhurst raise the old line up to the summit level.|$|E

It was a form of psychological torture. <b>At</b> <b>such</b> <b>times</b> the mind plays tricks, and one starts to believe that perhaps one is a criminal without knowing it and that, as in some Kafkaesque nightmare, guilt has been pre-ordained and the sentence is inescapable." ...|$|E

[...] Other European nations, faced with similar circumstances, opted for protection, and Disraeli was urged to reinstitute the Corn Laws. He declined, stating that he regarded the matter as settled. [...] Protection would have been highly unpopular among the newly enfranchised urban working classes, as it would raise their cost of living. Amid an economic slump generally, the Conservatives lost support among farmers.|$|E

500|$|Enceladus was {{discovered}} by William Herschel on August 28, 1789, during the first use of his new [...] telescope, then {{the largest in the}} world. Its faint apparent magnitude (HV = +11.7) and its proximity to the much brighter Saturn and Saturn's rings make Enceladus difficult to observe from Earth with smaller telescopes. Like many satellites of Saturn discovered prior to the Space Age, Enceladus was first observed during a Saturnian equinox, when Earth is within the ring plane. <b>At</b> <b>such</b> <b>times,</b> the reduction in glare from the rings makes the moons easier to observe. Prior to the Voyager missions the view of Enceladus improved little from the dot first observed by Herschel. Only its orbital characteristics were known, with estimations of its mass, density and albedo.|$|E
500|$|Costa's overall style {{allowed him}} {{to play in a}} great variety of settings. According to critic Alun Morgan, [...] "his mind was never {{cluttered}} up with thoughts of stylistic divisions. He was at home with any jazz group, provided it swung and generated a feeling of happiness". On piano, his [...] "trademark sound", remarked Ken Dryden, [...] "was the emphasis of the middle and lower registers while nearly ignoring the top two octaves". Some of Costa's more linear, right-hand playing was influenced by his listening to Bud Powell records while in the army. Costa's playing was more than just one-handed lines: during a period when the typical approach to jazz piano was to concentrate on right-hand solos while adding only basic left-hand support, Costa used both hands in creating his own vigorous sound. His piano playing on the informally recorded album Fuerst Set is typical of his style; it was later described by critic Whitney Balliett: Each improvisation resembled an excellent drum solo in its rhythmic intensity, pattern of beats, and elements of surprise. Costa liked to use octave chords in the left hand and single-note lines in the right, and he liked to thunder endlessly down in the lower registers of the piano. <b>At</b> <b>such</b> <b>times,</b> he played chords in both hands and with stunning effect. He would let loose a staccato passage and then an impossible two-handed arpeggio, or he would deliver on-the-beat or offbeat chords – seesawing them, making them into sixty-fourth notes, somehow slurring them, and developing great drive and momentum.|$|E
