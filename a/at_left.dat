A two-time Pro Bowl selection with the Eagles, Walters started in 122 consecutive games <b>at</b> <b>left</b> tackle in his nine years with the team. Following his retirement, he was a radio color commentator for the Eagles from 1984 through 1997.|$|E

5|$|Ahead of 2012–13, Charles {{signed a}} new two-year {{contract}} with the club. He started in the club's first match of the season, a 3–1 home win over AFC Wimbledon in the League Cup, playing the whole match <b>at</b> <b>left</b> back. He scored his first goal {{of the season in}} a 1–1 draw against Shrewsbury Town on 1 September 2012, after cutting in from the wing to strike into the top corner to restore parity in the match. It turned out to be his only goal of the season as Charles played most of the season <b>at</b> <b>left</b> back, making 41 appearances during the season. With a year remaining on his current deal, Charles' contract was extended for a further year in June 2013, keeping him contracted to the club until the summer of 2015.

5|$|Allen {{played as}} the starter at right tackle {{in each of}} the Giants' three minicamps prior to the 2004 preseason, but {{incoming}} head coach Tom Coughlin moved right guard David Diehl to the right tackle position before the first preseason game. Allen was originally designated the primary backup <b>at</b> <b>left</b> and right tackle going into the 2004 season, but he was released after the Giants signed Marques Sullivan off waivers.|$|E
5|$|Carruthers came on as a {{substitute}} on 76 minutes in a 2–2 draw away to Premier League team Fulham on 6 January 2008. By February 2008, he had been dislodged <b>at</b> <b>left</b> back by Joe Jacobson, although he made {{a return to the}} team for a 2–0 home victory over Cheltenham Town after Jacobson was unavailable for selection. He made one more appearance before the end of 2007–08, a 1–1 draw at home to Northampton on 12 March 2008, finishing the season with 24 appearances. He was released by the club in May 2008.|$|E
5|$|Carruthers is left-footed and is versatile, {{being able}} to play as a left back, left wing-back and left midfielder, {{although}} he has stated his strongest position is <b>at</b> <b>left</b> back. He has also played in a more attacking role as a left winger. He predominantly played as a left back for Northampton and Bristol Rovers, but on his arrival at York he was converted to playing in left midfield.|$|E

5|$|In early 2004, Williams {{committed}} {{to play football}} at the University of Kentucky, {{but he did not}} join the team that season. He later re{{committed to}} Kentucky in 2005 and enrolled that year. In the 2005 season, Williams played in five games before starting in the final three matches of the season <b>at</b> <b>left</b> tackle. He started 12 games in his sophomore year and was named the Most Outstanding Offensive Lineman by the team. In early 2007, Williams was indefinitely suspended from the Wildcats for academic reasons, but his suspension was later lifted {{prior to the start of}} the season.|$|E
5|$|In figure <b>at</b> <b>left,</b> {{the various}} {{segments}} {{that form the}} epitope {{have been shown to}} be continuously collinear, meaning that they have been shown as sequential; however, for the situation being discussed here (i.e., the antigen recognition by the B cell), this explanation is too simplistic. Such epitopes are known as sequential or linear epitopes, as all the amino acids on them are in the same sequence (line). This mode of recognition is possible only when the peptide is small (about six to eight amino acids long), and is employed by the T cells (T lymphocytes).|$|E

5|$|The Calgary Stampeders signed Williams as an {{international}} free agent on May 28, 2015. Williams made the Stampeders' active roster following preseason and made his CFL debut on July 18 against the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. He started three games <b>at</b> <b>left</b> tackle before being forced to leave the August 1st game against the Montreal Alouettes with an arm injury. After Williams reportedly had X-rays of his elbow taken, {{he was diagnosed with}} a hyperextended right elbow. He suffered multiple injuries {{during the rest of the}} regular season, causing him to sit out several games. He returned in time to play in both playoff games for Calgary.|$|E

All three players were French-Canadians from Quebec: Perreault from Victoriaville; Robert from Trois-Rivières; and Martin from Verdun, Quebec.

5|$|The West Coast Express was an {{ice hockey}} line that {{played for the}} National Hockey League's (NHL) Vancouver Canucks from 2002 to 2006.

An evaporator produced fresh water for the boilers and for the crew.|$|E
5|$|The {{trioxide}} is {{volatile and}} sublimes at high temperatures. This prevents {{formation of a}} continuous protective (passivating) oxide layer, which would stop the bulk oxidation of metal. Molybdenum has several oxidation states, the most stable being +4 and +6 (bolded in the table <b>at</b> <b>left).</b> The chemistry and the compounds show more similarity to tungsten than to chromium; the instability of molybdenum(III) and tungsten(III) compounds, for example, contrasts with {{the stability of the}} chromium(III) compounds. The highest oxidation state is seen in molybdenum(VI) oxide (MoO3), while the normal sulfur compound is molybdenum disulfide MoS2.|$|E
5|$|Through {{the first}} ten league games of the {{following}} campaign, Rodríguez was once again an ever-present in the squad, featuring in all the outings, starting eight.
