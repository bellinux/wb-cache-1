40|$|A novel {{mathematical}} {{approach that}} allows the analysis of orbital changes occurring during an aerocruise maneuver to be conducted in two distinct stages is presented. In the first stage, the aerodynamic turn is determined using a nondimensional form of the equations of motion that is free of singularities, {{and the way in}} which speed, altitude, angle of attack, and thrust direction should be chosen to maximize the aerodynamic turn for a given propellant expenditure is demonstrated. In the second analysis stage, the aerodynamic turn is translated into changes in the orbital elements with respect to the equatorial plane; analytic solutions for the initial <b>arguments</b> <b>of</b> <b>latitude</b> that maximize the change in inclination and in the longitude of the ascending node are given.

40|$|The author's {{previous}} {{theory of}} the artificial satellite is derived {{in terms of the}}. disturbed eccentric anomaly. The present development, in terms of the orbital true longitude, is a substantial improvement over the earlier work in that it leads to the faster convergence for large eccentricities and to a smaller number of terms in the series representing the perturbations. Moreover, each approximation of the radius vector and of the parameters determining the position of the orbit plane is obtained not {{in the form of a}} truncated infinite series but in the form of trigonometric polynomials in two arguments. These arguments are the mean true anomaly and the mean <b>argument</b> <b>of</b> the <b>latitude.</b> The present theory, like the previous one, permits the computation of perturbations of any desired order. Thus, any future information about earth's gravitational field can easily be included...|$|R

A location's position along a circle <b>of</b> <b>latitude</b> is given by its longitude. Circles <b>of</b> <b>latitude</b> are unlike circles of longitude, which all are great circles with the centre of Earth in the middle, as the circles <b>of</b> <b>latitude</b> get smaller as the distance from the Equator increases.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a fully analytical method {{to describe a}} satellite constellation reconfiguration manoeuvre. By making use of low-thrust propulsion and exploiting the Earth’s natural perturbing forces {{it is possible to}} analytically describe the reconfiguration of a constellation, achieving a desired separation of both Right Ascension of Ascending Node (RAAN) and <b>Argument</b> <b>of</b> <b>Latitude</b> between satellites. An inherent trade-off exists between the time taken for a manoeuvre and the required ΔV, however the analytical solution presented here allows for a rapid visualisation of the trade-space and determination of the ideal transfer trajectory for a given mission. The general method presented can be applied across a range of scenarios, including constellation deployment and repurposing. The results show that for a scenario with an initial orbit semi-major axis of 6878. 14 km, and a desired final semi-major axis of 6778. 14 km it is possible to achieve a separation of 180 ° <b>argument</b> <b>of</b> <b>latitude</b> between a manoeuvring and a non-manoeuvring reference satellite in approximately 68 hours with a ΔV of 200 m/s. To achieve the maximum possible RAAN separation of 90 ° with a ΔV of 200 m/s requires a much longer time of over 218 days. Using two manoeuvring satellites with the same total manoeuvre ΔV was found to be more efficient only for short manoeuvre times. This is quantified and for the case considered it is found that using a 2 -satellite manoeuvre is advantageous when changing the <b>argument</b> <b>of</b> <b>latitude</b> and when changing the RAAN < 10 ° approximately. The ability to identify this turning point clearly is a distinct advantage of the analytical solution presented...|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} {{estimating}} the NORAD SGP 4 atmospheric drag term from minimum osculating orbit states, i. e., two osculating orbits, is developed. The first osculating orbit state is converted into the NORAD TLE-type mean orbit state by iterative procedure. Then the converted TLE is propagated {{to the second}} orbit state using the SGP 4 model with the incremental SGP 4 drag term. The iterative orbit propagation procedure is finished when the difference of the two osculating semi-major axes between the propagated orbit and the given second orbit is minimized. In order to minimize {{the effect of the}} short-term variations of the osculating semi-major axis, the osculating <b>argument</b> <b>of</b> <b>latitude</b> of the second orbit is propagated to the same <b>argument</b> <b>of</b> <b>latitude</b> of the first orbit. The method is applied to the estimation of the NORAD-type TLE for the KOMPSAT- 1 spacecraft. The SGP 4 drag terms are estimated from both NORAD SGP 4 orbit propagation and the numerical orbit propagation results. Variations of the estimated drag terms are analyzed for the KOMPSAT- 1 satellite orbit determination results...|$|E

It should be possible to analyse the change in osculating orbital elements {{around the time of the}} event to determine the likely on-orbit position of Hitomi when the event occurred. Obtaining a solution in this manner may be helpful in confirming, refuting or even refining the solution from the previous close conjunction analysis.|$|E

The figure clearly shows the {{more than three times}} increase in density during the storm, with respect to the quiet conditions prior to the storm. It is also clear to see that the increase in density, caused mainly by increased Joule heating due to ionospheric currents in the auroral zones, started and peaked at high latitudes (around 90 ^∘ and 270 ^∘ <b>argument</b> <b>of</b> <b>latitude).</b> The hotter and therefore denser gas subsequently propagated toward lower latitudes {{over the course of the}} next orbits.|$|E

Analytic and numerical simulations are implemented to illustrate that such a revisiting constellation exists in a large region parameterized by the relative values of right ascension of ascending node and <b>argument</b> <b>of</b> <b>latitude.</b> A global investigation is presented to address the practical time-resolution of the constellation and its topological shape, the existence region, and the relationship to the semi-major axis and inclination...|$|E

40|$|The Earth is not {{perfectly}} spherical and its {{rotational axis}} is not fixed in space, and these geophysical and kinematic irregularities work as dominant perturbations in satellite orbit propagation. The International Earth Rotation Service (IERS) provides the Conventions as guidelines {{for using the}} Earth’s model and the reference time and coordinate systems defined by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). These guidelines are directly applied to model orbital dynamics of Earth satellites. In the present work, {{the effects of the}} latest conventions released in 2010 on orbit propagation are investigated by comparison with cases of applying the previous guidelines, IERS Conventions (2003). All seven major updates are tested, i. e., for the models of the precession/nutation, the geopotential, the ocean tides, the ocean pole tides, the free core nutation, the polar motion, and the solar system ephemeris. The resultant position differences for one week of orbit propagation range from tens of meters for the geopotential model change from EGM 96 to EGM 2008 to a few mm for the precession/nutation model change from IAU 2000 to IAU 2006. The along-track differences vary secularly while the cross-track components show periodic variation. However, the radial-track position differences are very small compared with the other components in all cases. These phenomena reflect the variation of the ascending node and the <b>argument</b> <b>of</b> <b>latitude.</b> The reason is that the changed models tested in the current study can be regarded as small fluctuations of the geopotential model {{from the point of view}} of orbital dynamics. The ascending node and the <b>argument</b> <b>of</b> <b>latitude</b> are more sensitive to the geopotential than the other elements. This study contributes to understanding of the relation between the Earth’s geophysical properties and orbital motion of satellites as well as satellite-based observations...|$|E
30|$|The left {{panel of}} Fig.  12 shows the {{variation}} of density {{over the entire}} period that was processed so far. It is clear that this period started with very low densities in June and July 2014, due to the high orbit and low solar activity conditions at the time. Much higher densities were reached in December 2014, when solar and geomagnetic activity were higher. The orientation of the orbital plane of the satellite was such that the daytime density bulge was sampled during descending passes, which corresponds with the maximum densities being reached between 180 ^∘ and 270 ^∘ <b>argument</b> <b>of</b> <b>latitude</b> during December 2014. In fact, the broad X-shaped pattern in the left panel {{is due to the}} slow precession of the orbital plane with respect to the Sun, modulated slightly by seasonal density variations and more prominently by variations of solar activity.|$|E
40|$|A {{parameter}} estimator {{for accurate}} analytic propagation of Epicyclic orbits {{to be used}} on board a spacecraft is developed as a replacement of high precision computationally expensive numerical propagators. Long term propagation of orbits using analytical descriptions needs proper choice of orbital parameters. The question arises on how to choose these orbital parameters of an analytical approximation appropriate to a given choice of orbital parameters for the numerically propagated orbit obtained from full nonlinear equations of motion such that the two trajectories remain sufficiently {{close to each other}} for long terms usually a week. In this paper we employed statistical data regression technique to accurately determine linear secular growths in <b>argument</b> <b>of</b> <b>latitude</b> and right ascension of the ascending node of an Epicyclic model 1. This enables precise determination of semi-major axis and inclination of the orbit valid for longer durations with fixed secular variations.

40|$|At low Earth orbits, {{differentials}} in {{the drag}} forces between spacecraft {{can be used}} for controlling their relative motion in the orbital plane. Current methods for determining the drag force may result in errors due to inaccuracies in the density models and drag coefficients. In this work, a methodology for relative maneuvering of spacecraft based on differential drag, accounting for uncertainties in the drag model, is proposed. A dynamical model composed of the mean semimajor axis and the <b>argument</b> <b>of</b> <b>latitude</b> is used for describing long-range maneuvers. For this model, a linear quadratic regulator is implemented, accounting for the uncertainties in the drag force. The actuation is the pitch angle of the satellites, considering saturation. The control scheme guarantees asymptotic stability of the system up to a certain magnitude of the state vector, which is determined by the uncertainties. Numerical simulations show that the method exhibits consistent robustness to accomplish the maneuvers, even in the presence of realistic modeling of density fields, drag coefficients, the corotation of the atmosphere, and zonal harmonics up to J(8) ...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} {{statistical}} tools {{have been developed}} over the years for assessing the risk of reentering object to human populations. These tools {{make use of the}} characteristics (e. g., mass, shape, size) of debris that are predicted by aerothermal models to survive reentry. This information, combined with information on the expected ground path of the reentry, is used to compute the probability that {{one or more of the}} surviving debris might hit a person on the ground and cause one or more casualties. The statistical portion of this analysis relies on a number of assumptions about how the debris footprint and the human population are distributed in latitude and longitude, and how to use that information to arrive at realistic risk numbers.
