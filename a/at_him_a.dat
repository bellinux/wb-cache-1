5|$|After the 1969 {{burglary}} {{of a house}} Hendrix was renting in Benedict Canyon, California, {{and while}} he was under the influence of drugs and alcohol, he punched his friend Paul Caruso and accused him of the theft. He then chased Caruso away from the residence while throwing stones <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> <b>A</b> few days later, one of Hendrix's girlfriends, Carmen Borrero, required stitches after he hit her above her eye with a vodka bottle during a drunken, jealous rage.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1892, as the {{aftershock}} of the stand-off was still being felt throughout the county, two alleged horse rustlers were gunned down by range detectives east of the Big Horn River. The killers escaped the law with assistance from Otto Franc, a rancher who had sided with the large cattle company faction. On May 24, 1893, Nate Champion's brother, Dudley Champion, came to Wyoming looking for work before he {{was shot and killed}} in cold blood. Fifteen miles from town, Dudley had come across the ranch of Mike Shonsey, who, after seeing the young man, immediately grabbed a gun and fired <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> <b>A</b> coroner's inquiry ruled Shonsey's actions were self-defense and he was acquitted of murder. Afterwards, Shonsey left the country before the officials could continue with the investigation. A year before, Shonsey actually met Nate Champion near the Beaver Creek Canyon, where a fight almost commenced between the two as Nate suspected that Shonsey was one of the five men who had attacked him in his cabin. He further threatened Shonsey and demanded he give up the names {{of the rest of the}} assassins. This event made Shonsey harbor hatred toward Nate and probably toward his brother Dudley as well. Dudley Champion was the last person killed who was associated with the Johnson County War.|$|E
500|$|In {{the main}} event John Cena faced Rob Van Dam for the WWE Championship. It was evident that the crowd was decidedly anti-Cena even before the match began; {{in keeping with his}} {{traditional}} entrance, Cena threw the T-shirt he wore to the ring out into the crowd, only to have it thrown back <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> number of times. Loud, insulting chants were directed at Cena throughout the match, such as [...] "fuck you, Cena", [...] "same old shit", [...] "overrated" [...] and [...] "you can't wrestle." [...] The action quickly went to ringside, and Van Dam got the advantage on Cena, with a Moonsault Press off the steel steps. Van Dam continued his offense when the action went back inside the ring as he placed a chair on Cena's stomach before executing the Rolling Thunder. Cena later managed to get the advantage, executing a DDT on a steel chair. Cena went for his finishing move, the FU, but Van Dam blocked the attempt. Van Dam would then set up a table in the corner, but Cena got Van Dam in the STFU. When John Cena refused to break the hold after Van Dam got to the ropes, Cena clotheslined the referee, after they had a push and shove. Cena proceeded to deliver Van Dam with a Superplex off the top rope and then hitting Van Dam with steel steps. Replacement referee Nick Patrick officiated the remainder of the match, with Van Dam kicking out of two. As Cena got up he went to deliver Van Dam an FU, Van Dam grabbed onto the rope, which leads Cena to deliver Van Dam an FU out of the ring. As Cena turned around, someone in a motorcycle helmet interfered and speared Cena through a table. The person was revealed as Edge, who won a number one contender's match to challenge for the WWE Championship at Vengeance on June 25, 2006. Edge also knocked out Nick Patrick. The Hammerstein Ballroom crowd chanted [...] "Thank You Edge!". Van Dam then executed the Five-Star Frog Splash on Cena, but there was no referee as Patrick was knocked out. Paul Heyman ran to the ring, and counted the pinfall to three, giving Van Dam the victory. The ECW locker room came to the ring to celebrate with Van Dam, but it was unclear at the time whether Van Dam was [...] "officially" [...] WWE Champion.|$|E

2500|$|While {{on trial}} for that charge, Cepeda was arrested a second time, after a man alleged that Cepeda had pointed a gun <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> <b>A</b> third case was brought by Pino, seeking an {{increase}} in alimony and child support payments. In 1978, after three days at trial, Cepeda was declared guilty of the drug possession charges and sentenced to five years of imprisonment. Cepeda served ten months in jail time and the balance of his sentence on probation. Following his release, a district attorney in Puerto Rico told the prison's warden that if Cepeda returned the mafia would likely attempt to kill him. leading to Cepeda's assignment to a [...] "halfway house" [...] in Philadelphia.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a speech}} laden with pro-socialist and Communist Party rhetoric, Ceaușescu {{delivered}} {{a litany of}} {{the achievements of the}} [...] "socialist revolution" [...] and Romanian [...] "multi-laterally developed socialist society". He blamed the Timișoara uprising on [...] "fascist agitators". However, Ceaușescu was out of touch with his people and completely misread the crowd's mood. The people remained unresponsive, and only the front rows supported Ceaușescu with cheers and applause. About two minutes into the speech some in the crowd actually began to jeer, boo, whistle and yell insults <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> <b>a</b> reaction unthinkable for most of his rule. Workers from a Bucharest power plant started chanting [...] "Ti-mi-șoa-ra! Ti-mi-șoa-ra!", which was soon picked up by others in the crowd. In response, Ceaușescu raised his right hand in hopes of silencing the crowd; his stunned expression remains one of the defining moments of the end of communism in Eastern Europe. He then tried to placate the crowd by offering to raise workers' salaries by 200 lei per month (about 9 U.S. dollars at the time, yet a 5%–10% raise for a modest salary) and student scholarships from 100 to 110 lei while continuing to praise the achievements of the Socialist Revolution. However, a revolution was brewing right in front of his eyes.|$|E
