She {{was friendly}} with Bodger, {{but not enough}} for him to let her know about Badger. She was briefly the acting Headmistress after Mrs Trout was sent back to Teacher Training School, but returned to her old post when Mrs Bogart took over as Headmistress.

25|$|I get {{the tune}} and then I {{just keep on}} singing the tune until the words come out from the tune. It's kind of a {{hypnotic}} state that you reach after a while when you keep on playing it where words just evolve from it. So you take those words <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>let</b> them go whichever way they want...'Moonshadow'? Funny, that was in Spain, I went there alone, completely alone, {{to get away from}} a few things. And I was dancin' on the rocks there... right on the rocks where the waves were, like, blowin' and splashin'. Really, it was so fantastic. And the moon was bright, ya know, and I started dancin' and singin' and I sang that song and it stayed. It's just the kind of moment that you want to find when you're writin' songs.|$|E

5000|$|On the Jamie Isaac remix, Michael Cragg of The Guardian {{stated that}} Jamie Isaac [...] "strips the song {{back to its}} bare bones while is augmenting the central beat by simple handclaps, adds in his own backing vocals, tweaks {{everything}} {{to make it seem}} oddly sinister <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>lets</b> it all simmer gently." ...|$|R
500|$|Davis {{later said}} [...] "Jim Wong [...] {{was a big}} help, too. A lot of the stage {{directions}} point toward farce, but Jim told me to play against that <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>let</b> the situation play out. The Forrest Gump scene was difficult, too. When I prepared it and did it the first time, I was almost Shakespearean in my approach. Jim made me toss it off more, and it worked fine". Chris Owens who portrayed the Young Smoking Man spent time watching how Davis smokes to ensure {{that he did it}} just like him. Owens later appeared as a young version of The Smoking Man again in the episode [...] "Demons", and as his son Jeffrey Spender.|$|E
500|$|Mays {{performed}} a cover version of [...] "I Could Have Danced All Night" [...] from My Fair Lady in the episode [...] "Mash-Up", a studio recording {{of which was}} included as a bonus-track on copies of [...] purchased from Target stores. Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal called the performance [...] "lovely", and Andrea Reiher for Zap2it similarly praised the piece: [...] "wow, she has a nice voice! She's no Julie Andrews, but she'll do." [...] Eric Goldman for IGN commented: [...] "Seeing Emma sing [...] "I Could Have Danced All Night" [...] was sweet, though was it just me (or my TV), or was the volume on her vocals a bit unusually loud? I also could have done without Will's line telling her she should sing to help her keep the beat as she danced – come on Glee, you're a musical. Embrace it <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>let</b> her sing." ...|$|E
500|$|Executive {{producer}} Jeff Pinkner {{decided he}} wanted fellow executive producer David H. Goodman and supervising producer J. R. Orci to collaborate in writing the episode; Goodman wrote the first half, while Orci wrote {{the rest of the}} episode. The two later worked together on only one other episode, [...] "The Equation". Frederick E. O. Toye directed the episode, as he had worked previously with the writers on Alias. The writers had the idea {{for a couple of weeks}} of Olivia walking into an apartment and discovering walls covered with drawings of events that [...] "no man could possibly have known about". They wanted to take [...] "urban myths or legends of strange events" [...] and come up with a fringe science equivalent; this led them to creating the story of Roy, a man with seemingly [...] "psychic" [...] abilities, which they then expanded by offering a real scientific explanation in the form of Walter's past research. In the show's early development, the producers were also unsure about how other aspects should be developed, such as Joshua Jackson's character Peter. For instance, in [...] "The Ghost Network", they debated whether or not Peter would break into his childhood home before finally [...] "stalling <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>let</b> him do it"; Orci came up with Peter's explanation to Olivia, that he used to live there so it wasn't really breaking in.|$|E

500|$|Since its {{original}} airing, critics have listed [...] "Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose" [...] {{among the best}} X-Files episodes. TV Guide called it the tenth greatest episode in television history. Review website IGN named it the best standalone X-Files episode of the entire series, writing that the episode [...] " [...] is a distinctive episode of the series, mixing a healthy amount of humor [...] with some very nasty business [...] In just 44 minutes, Boyle creates a fully formed character who makes a big impact in his one and only appearance." [...] Topless Robot named it the ninth-funniest episode of the series. Starpulse listed it as the third-best X-Files episode. Charlie Jane Anders and Javier Grillo-Marxuach of io9 included it {{on the list of}} [...] "10 TV Episodes that Changed Television". Tom Kessenich, in Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files, named the episode the seventh-best installment of the series, noting that it features [...] "a wonderful blend of humor, drama, and pathos, something The X-Files did better than just about any other show this past decade." [...] The cast and crew of the series have expressed their enjoyment of the installment. Duchovny considers [...] "Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose" [...] to be one of his favorite episodes of the third season. Nutter highlighted it {{as one of the most}} enjoyable entries that he had worked on. He also noted that, [...] "the writing was so tight and so crisp and so fresh that I think, as a director, the only thing you have to do is create the atmosphere, set up the characters, set up the shots and you are basically invisible. Then you step back <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>let</b> it happen." [...] Series writer and producer Frank Spotnitz stated that the episode worked on many levels and that it is his favorite of the episodes written for the show by Morgan. In 2016, Ira Madison of Vulture.com named it the best episode of the series and [...] "one of the best episodes of television ever", stating that the episode [...] "takes every element that made the series so iconic and throws them all into one heartbreaking installment".|$|E
500|$|On {{choosing}} {{his lead}} single, Drake told Rap-Up, [...] "It’s gotta {{be a real}} great song. It’s gotta be something that I feel is timeless and is better than anything that I’ve ever done." [...] Drake exclusively revealed to Rap-Up on February 15, 2010 that [...] "Over" [...] would be the lead single from his debut album, Thank Me Later, and would be produced by Boi-1da, producer of his previous singles [...] "Best I Ever Had" [...] and [...] "Forever". Drake chose to premiere the song on his hometown Toronto's radio station Flow 93.5. In an interview session with the station, Drake said, [...] "I went with 'Over' as the first look because of {{the words in the}} hook," [...] he said. [...] "The hook being the most repetitive part. I got a lot of great songs on my album. I got songs for women who wanna feel special. I got songs for dudes — if you ever thought my music was too soft, this is one you will enjoy. I got a lot of variety on there, but the biggest thing was that opening line on the hook: 'I know way too many people here right now that I didn't know last year'." [...] He went on to explain that the record sums up where he is in his career right now, and called it a [...] "great first impression". Drake did a lot of work for the song and also the album in Jamaica, during which he called the [...] "calm before the storm", and called [...] "Over" [...] the storm. He said, [...] "It's the moment. I wanted to emerge at first from this album <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>let</b> people know 'This is how I'm coming out in the public eye. I'm ready for anything." [...] He then went to explain that after the album people will be like [...] "he's still human" [...] or [...] "he's still thinking the same way", and said he wanted people to [...] "understand I could have lost it. He said, [...] "'Over' could have been my entire album. Just 'cause that's what this industry and game will do to you if you lose yourself." [...] Drake later said that the song was a [...] "warm-up record". He went on to say, [...] "I love the song. I love the message in the song. It's funny, because 'Over' is the fourth song on the album and it's the turning point in the album. It's like, you get three songs of me sort of trying to paint the picture of what the last year has been like for me — trying to fill you in, almost let you into my world as much as I can. 'Over' is that moment where you're almost worried on the album. 'Is this kid about to ... ? What's happening? Is he changing?' I wanted that to come out first. I wanted people to be a little nervous. This whole journey could have changed me drastically. Fortunately I'm able to step out of my shoes and reflect on it and give you some great music. 'Over' is a great alter-ego moment. It's the dark side of things and I really wanted that to come out first." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{instrumental}} backing {{was effectively}} recorded {{live in the}} studio, while Van Vliet overdubbed most of the vocals in only partial sync with the music by hearing the slight sound leakage through the studio window. Zappa said of Van Vliet's approach, [...] " [...] impossible to tell him why things should be such and such a way. It {{seemed to me that}} {{if he was going to}} create a unique object, that the best thing for me to do was to keep my mouth shut as much as possible <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>let</b> him do whatever he wanted to do whether I thought it was wrong or not." ...|$|E

[...] Cliff Lee, Davis's teammate in Texas in 2010, said, [...] "Watching his highlights, you can totally tell that he's relaxed <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>letting</b> it happen.

[...] After the description of the operation, Obrenović was grilled on the VRS capabilities and weaknesses. He later complained that they believed [...] "we never put up resistance to the 28th Division <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>let</b> them through".
