Conventional diesel submarines must periodically resurface or run on snorkel to recharge their batteries. Most modern military submarines generate breathing oxygen by electrolysis of water (using a device called an [...] "Elektrolytic Oxygen Generator"). Atmosphere control equipment includes a CO2 scrubber, which uses an <b>amine</b> <b>absorbent</b> to remove the gas from air and diffuse it into waste pumped overboard. A machine that uses a catalyst to convert carbon monoxide into carbon dioxide (removed by the CO2 scrubber) and bonds hydrogen produced from the ship's storage battery with oxygen in the atmosphere to produce water, is also used. An atmosphere monitoring system samples the air from different areas of the ship for nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, R-12 and R-114 refrigerants, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and other gases. Poisonous gases are removed, and oxygen is replenished by use of an oxygen bank located in a main ballast tank. Some heavier submarines have two oxygen bleed stations (forward and aft). The oxygen in the air is sometimes kept a few percent less than atmospheric concentration to reduce fire danger.|$|E

Amine-based capture {{technology is a}} conventional technology to remove carbon dioxide in natural gas processing, and {{also can be used}} for carbon dioxide removal from flue gas in coal-based power plants. In particular, monoethanolamine is a conventional commercial absorbent to remove carbon dioxide and considered as a standard <b>amine</b> <b>absorbent.</b> Due to the high non-ideality of amine, rate-based models have been suggested to describe absorption and desorption of <b>amine</b> <b>absorbent.</b> However, most suggested models were validated against large-scale pilot plant results, and there were few models to consider both absorber and stripper with rate-based model. In this study, we applied two rate-based models introduced by previous literature to the actual pilot plant operation data in 0. 1 MW-scale Boryeong pilot plant, South Korea and developed a modified model with increased accuracy. The developed model showed good agreements with pilot plant results for both absorber and stripper. However, under low liquid-to-vapor ratio operation with high rich loading value, all model showed worse estimations...|$|E

Four linear primary alkanolamines at varying chain lengths (MEA, 3 A 1 P, 4 A 1 B, and 5 A 1 P), two primary amines with different substituents in the β-position to the nitrogen (1 A 2 P and ISOB), a secondary alkanolamine (DEA), and a sterically hindered primary amine (AMP) were investigated. The relationship between the 15 N NMR data of aqueous amines and their ability to form carbamate, as determined at equilibrium by quantitative 13 C NMR experiments, was analyzed, taking into account structural–chemical properties. For all the amines, the 15 N chemical shifts fairly reflected the observed reactivity for carbamate formation.

In commonly used CO 2 capture technologies, the main technical difficulty {{in the use of}} aqueous solutions of organic <b>amine</b> <b>absorbent</b> for CO 2 capture is that the renewable energy consumption is high.

This {{has been achieved}} using Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR FT-IR) spectroscopy to follow in situ the chemical reactions occurring between CO₂ {{and a series of}} heterocyclic monoamines and novel diamines. The monoamines investigated included piperidine and a series of commercially available functionalised piperidine derivatives, e. g. those with methyl-, hydroxyl- and hydroxyalkyl substituents. The diamines investigated included novel hexahyhropyrimidine (HHPY), methyl hexahydropyrimidines (MHHPY and DMHHPY) and hexahydropyridazine (HHPZ); piperazine (PZ), and 2, 6 - and 2, 5 - dimethylpiperazines (2, 6 -DMPZ and 2, 5 -DMPZ). The effect of structure on CO₂ / amine reactivity was assessed according to a correlation between the infrared active ionic reaction products (carbamate, bicarbonate and protonated amine) and cumulative CO₂ absorption; CO₂ absorption capacity; initial rate of CO₂ absorption; and a correlation between the atomic properties of the amine and carbamate derivative with the infrared spectral data, CO₂ absorption capacity and initial absorption rate. Calculations using B 3 LYP / 6 - 31 +G** and MP 2 / 6 - 31 +G** were performed to investigate the atomic properties of the amines and carbamate derivative. The N-COO- carbamate bond and resonance structure of the carboxylate moiety were analysed.

In this paper, we report direct experimental measurements of the energy cost involved in the solvation of CO 2 in two aqueous amine blends at different temperatures. The chemical solvents were designed as aqueous mixtures of commonly used primary and tertiary amines to study the influence of the different chemical properties inferred by the amine class. We have also applied a thermodynamic model to represent the energetic effects that take place in solution during CO 2 dissolution in these mixtures, where all parameters were taken from previous studies focused on single <b>amine</b> <b>absorbents.</b> The noteworthy agreement observed with the reported experimental heats of absorption and with literature vapor liquid equilibrium properties confirmed the relevance of the underlying molecular mechanisms considered in our model, and suggest that this model would prove useful to investigate CO 2 dissolution in other amine blends...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPost {{combustion}} CO 2 capture using <b>amine</b> <b>absorbents</b> is {{the most}} mature process and therefore the most relevant choice for realising full-scale capture {{within the next few}} years. The health and environmental impact of emissions to air is, however, a potential risk. Amines may react in the process or in the atmosphere post emission to form new substances that may be more harmful than the parent amine itself. The main objective of the current work was to investigate the flue gas degradation of monoethanolamine (MEA) in the process with special emphasis on the NOx induced chemical reactions. Degradation experiments have been carried out at absorber like conditions in the Aminox™ rig, followed by further degradation of the used solvent at higher temperature in a lab scale autoclave. Liquid samples were analysed by a range of methods to identify the formation of degradation by-products, with special focus on potential harmful compounds like nitrosamines and nitramines. On-line FT-IR and MS instruments were used for qualitative detection of volatile degradation products and to measure amine slip. MEA is a primary amine which in itself is unable to form a stable nitrosamine. However, experiments show that under the influence of NOx, MEA degrades to the secondary amine diethanolamine (DEA) which is then nitrosated. This work shows that some nitrosamine formation in the process must be expected from any amine. Based on data from real emission measurements, health and environmental risk assessment should be investigated in further studies...|$|R
40|$|During {{post-combustion}} capture (PCC) of CO 2, <b>amine</b> based <b>absorbents</b> undergo undesirable reactions which increase {{human and}} environmental impacts (due to emission {{and disposal of}} <b>amine</b> <b>absorbents</b> and degradation products), as well as operational and maintenance costs (due to amine consumption and corrosion). This thesis describes: (a) the degradation of a 30 % (w/w) aqueous MEA absorbent during a six month campaign at CSIRO’s PCC pilot plant located at AGL’s Loy Yang brown coal-fired power station; (b) the chemical and physicochemical factors {{that are likely to}} affect the amine degradation; and (c) provides recommendations for technologies and strategies for monitoring and managing amine condition. The aims and objectives of this thesis are defined in chapter 1. The samples of 30 % (w/w) aqueous MEA absorbent from a CSIRO PCC pilot plant are crucial for the research presented in this thesis, and for this reason, the background of the sample set is also described in chapter 1. Chapters 2 - 7 contain publications that have been published in or submitted to respected peer-reviewed journals. Chapter 2 contains a literature review that was published in Environmental Science and Technology during 2012. This literature review considers reasons for the consumption of amine during PCC (including oxidative degradation and carbamate polymerisation), other aspects of amine management (including fly ash, foaming, corrosion and amine reclamation), and environmental management (including nitrosation, atmospheric emissions, waste management). This publication is followed by a brief review of the relevant literature that has been published since 2012. Chapter 3 describes the development, validation and use of a GC-FID method for quantification of MEA concentrations in the samples from a CSIRO PCC pilot plant. The MEA concentrations measured using GC-FID were statistically equivalent to the MEA concentrations measured by acid-base titration, which is the industry standard method. Importantly, this GC-FID method could be used to measure the concentrations of individual species in blended <b>amine</b> <b>absorbents.</b> Chapter 4 uses spectroscopic and elemental methods to: characterise the changes in the organic structure and physiochemical environment of the MEA absorbent; and to evaluate potential methods for on- or at-line monitoring of MEA degradation during PCC. UV-Vis was identified as an effective on- or at-line technique for monitoring the production of N-(2 -hydroxyethyl) imidazole (HEI), an oxidative MEA degradation product. Chapter 5 investigates the processes responsible for the accumulation of inorganic anions, cations and metals in the MEA absorbent. The results obtained in this chapter demonstrate that fly ash was the most significant source of cations and indicates that oxidative degradation was a more significant source of heat-stable salts (HSS) than SOx and NOx from the flue gas. A potential change in corrosion mechanisms was identified from the change in ratios of iron, chromium, manganese and nickel concentrations and a rapid increase in the iron concentration was measured after the tenth sampling event. To enable the quantification of organic degradation products other than organic acids, two sample preparation methods are described and validated in chapter 6. The cation exchange, derivatisation and GC-MS method was used to investigate the changes in the concentrations of organic degradation products during a pilot scale PCC campaign. These changes are discussed in chapter 7 and confirm that HEI is a suitable marker for oxidative degradation of MEA. The results in chapter 7 also suggest that the difference in ratios of organic acid concentrations at different PCC pilot plants {{may be due to the}} influence of operating parameters on the reaction pathways. This chapter also identifies coinciding discontinuities or disturbances in (a) the concentration profiles of all organic degradation products excluding the organic acids; and (b) the ratio of transition metal concentrations and increase in iron concentration. Two possibly related explanations provided for these changes are: (a) a decrease in the alkalinity due to the accumulation of HSS; and (b) the oxidation of residual aldehydes and/or sulphite during extended periods of absorbent storage prior to the last three sampling events. Overall, the information presented in this thesis provides valuable insight into: (a) the rates of different amine degradation pathways; (b) accumulation rates of flue gas and corrosion byproducts during pilot-scale PCC; and (c) enabled the identification of oxidative degradation of MEA and accumulation of iron due to corrosion as the two most significant issues for managing amine condition during PCC...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} meet the global demand of energy from {{combustion}} processes with fossil fuels without interfering with the atmospheric levels of CO 2, carbon capture and storage (CCS) is considered a viable solution. Separation of CO 2 from combustion gas performed by absorption/stripping in columns is today a costly and energy demanding process. One way to reduce the energy requirement of CO 2 absorption is to use DEEA MAPA blends, but they are volatile and their use at industrial level is thus problematic. Membrane based absorption, defined as membrane contactors allow operating with volatile absorbents without emitting more harmful chemicals. This require a membrane that allows high CO 2 and low absorbent permeability. Membrane contactors also have the potential to reduce the capital cost of absorption as effective membrane modules increase the surface area of absorption, and thereby reduce the process volume. This thesis has investigated two different AF 2400 membranes with addition of ZIF- 8 and XT-RGO nanoparticles, and in particular how these nanocomposite membranes affect characteristics that are important to consider in membrane contactor absorption. The membranes were tested together with a volatile 3 rd generation CO 2 absorbent named 3 D 3 M and with MEA as a reference absorbent. It was discovered that the two nanocomposite membranes decreased the permeability of the two <b>amine</b> <b>absorbents</b> substantially compared to the pure AF 2400 membrane.

40|$|World {{energy demand}} is on a {{continuous}} increase and fossil fuels {{will remain the}} dominant energy source for the foreseeable future. Fossil fuel combustion, however, results in greenhouse gas emissions, and in particular of large quantities of CO 2. This contributes significantly to global warming and the subsequent adverse health and environmental effects. CO 2 capture by absorption remains the most mature technology to reduce global anthropogenic CO 2 emissions. The cost of this technology and the potential secondary environmental impacts remain {{some of the issues}} that need to be reduced to facilitate full scale global deployment in industrial processes and power plants. These issues are directly linked to the solvent used in the process. Amines are the most used and studied absorbents and significant progress has been made during the last 10 - 15 years, in particular with regard to heat needed for the CO 2 capture regeneration, reducing this from typical figures of 3. 8 - 4. 2 GJ/ton CO 2 captured to today 2. 6 - 2. 8 GJ/ton CO 2. This is, however, still high, and combined with pressing environmental issues like e. g. degradation and process and atmospheric nitrosamine and nitramines formation, there is a definite need for developing better amines or other new absorbents to improve both efficiency and environmental characteristics. The work in this thesis focuses on finding and developing new absorbents for CO 2 capture. It started by an evaluation of different solvent characterization factors. These are often related and also work against each other in many cases. The work then proceeded with a solvent preselection based on theoretical studies using structure-pKa relationships where solvents with similar structures were arranged according to their pKa values. Relationships were found and explained by electron donation and withdrawal through bonding and resulting solvation effects. Further screening experiments were conducted on selected <b>amine</b> <b>absorbents</b> and a method of combined absorption-desorption analyses was developed for selecting the most promising solvents for CO 2 capture based on the rapid screening experiments. It pointed at TMBPA to be good amine candidate solvent and that when TMBPA was promoted with PZ it showed a good potential to reduce the costs of the CO 2 capture process. This work, however, emphasizes the environmental impact of the new solvents. Thus, also amino acid salts were screened and investigated for CO 2 absorption potentials. In addition, a new <b>absorbent</b> class, <b>amine</b> amino acid salt solutions, was investigated. The amino acid absorbents are benign solvents and they have highly reduced volatility but often do not give the reduction in regeneration heat needed. It was found, however, that the new <b>absorbent</b> class, the <b>amine</b> amino acid salt solution, could have the potential of combining benign solvents, reduced volatility and highly reduced regeneration heat demand, thus providing an overall superior performance for CO 2 absorption than both the conventional amines and amino acid salt systems. For the solvents to be of industrial use they must be characterized. The physicochemical properties, density, viscosity and N 2 O solubility of both the amino acid salt, KSAR and the amine amino acid salt, SARMAPA, necessary for kinetics and mass transfer studies, were measured. The amino acid absorbents were found to have very low physical solubility of CO 2. This was attributed to the salting out effect of the ionic amino acid absorbent. Several different models were tested and developed to represent the experimental results and the agreement between model and experimental results were in general good. Kinetic and mass transfer properties of the absorbent necessary for the absorber design and process modeling were measured using a string of discs contactor, SDC, apparatus. The results obtained were used to re-interpret the termolecular and zwitterion mechanisms by introducing an ionic correction factor to take into account the effect of ionic strength on the pseudo first order kinetic rate constant of an aqueous amino acid absorbent. The reaction rate constant for the amino acid salt was found to be high but still comparable to the amines. The rate constant for amine amino acid salt, SARMAPA, was found to be lower than for KSAR but higher than for MEA. KSAR had the highest overall mass transfer coefficient, KGov, followed by MEA and then SARMAPA. The developed kinetic model for KSAR, when combined with its vapor liquid equilibrium model, adequately predicted both laboratory SDC and pilot plant mass transfer results well. Vapor liquid equilibrium for the unloaded and loaded amino acid absorbents, KSAR and SARMAPA, as well as for MEA was measured using two low and high temperature VLE apparatuses. VLE for the H 2 O-MEA-CO 2 system were measured for four different MEA concentrations: 15, 30, 45, and 60 wt% and for the temperature range 40 - 120 oC. The extended UNIQUAC thermodynamic framework was developed and applied to calculate the nonidealities in the systems represented by the activity coefficients of the species. Non-idealities in the gas phase were calculated using the Soave-Redlich-Kwong equation of state. Measurements with different MEA concentrations enabled the detailed study of the effect of concentration on the CO 2 partial pressure. The physical solubility of CO 2 in aqueous MEA solutions was determined using the N 2 O analogy and was applied in calculating the true activity coefficients of CO 2. Thermodynamic model for the amino acid salt, KSAR and a simplified one for amine amino acid salt, SARMAPA were developed to predict speciation and VLE. The amino acid salt, KSAR, has a highly reduced volatility, and the volatility of the amine in the amine amino acid salt, SARMAPA, was reduced by 50 %. The behavior of the amino acid absorbents was studied further in two laboratory pilot plant campaigns. The results confirmed that the mass transfer rates of the amino acid salt, 3. 5 M KSAR, were higher than those of 30 wt % MEA and 5 M SARMAPA. However, the regeneration energy requirement was found to be much higher than for both SARMAPA and 30 wt% MEA. SARMAPA was found to exhibit a much lower desorption energy requirement than KSAR, and the stripping stream requirement for the SARMAPA system was about half the values for MEA. The amino acid absorbents, KSAR and SARMAPA, showed practically no corrosive effects on process lines during the tests. Amino acid absorbents studied in this work practically reduces or/eliminates volatility problems found in amine systems and the amine amino acid salt studied, SARMAPA, has shown that the amine amino acid salts may be good candidates to reduce the energy requirements of the CO 2 capture processes combined with minimal environmental impact.

40|$|AbstractGlobal {{climate warming}} caused by {{emission}} {{of greenhouse gas}} including CO 2 is one of serious problems nowadays. In an effort to mitigate CO 2 emissions, one of most effectively clean energy plan is to produce power from coal using the integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC). However, the cost of existing CO 2 capture technologies is still too high. Utilization of large-solubility and low-cost absorbent for CO 2 capture in IGCC can effectively reduce the electricity price increase caused by addition of CO 2 removal unit. As it needs to trap CO 2 before combustion under high pressure in IGCC absorption {{is considered to be}} a better choice. HPP (Hot Potash Process) uses aqueous solution of potassium carbonate as the absorbent. Compared to physical solvent absorption method Rectisol and Selexol, HPP has relatively low investment and relatively high CO 2 recovery. Even in comparison with other chemical <b>absorbent</b> <b>amine</b> method HPP still has advantages as good chemical stability and low vapor pressure. In this paper several activators piperidine, piperozine, pyrazine, morpholine, imidazole, N-hydroxyethyl piperozine, Naminoethyl piperozine, AMP was tested respectively at 70  °C. As a result, piperidine activation works best, followed by N-(2 -hydroxyethyl) piperazine, N-(2 -aminoethyl) piperazine, 2 -amino- 2 -methyl- 1 -propanol and piperazine, pyrazine and imidazole is at its worst. Among them, N-(2 -hydroxyethyl) piperazine is less volatile, more stable and suitable as the activator. Absorbing capacity and absorbing rate of CO 2 in carbonate aqueous solution with HPZ increases by 5 % or more than those with PZ. An improved HPP process is presented adopting the new activator. In this process two de-absorption two columns is designed operating at different pressure. This makes it possible to reuse the heat of condensation during high pressure de-sorption in reboiler of low pressure de-sorption. By preliminary calculating the novel process can save energy consumption obviously. The steam consumption, cooling water consumption and power consumption declines by 43. 30 %, 31. 81 % and 10. 57 %, respectively. It is expected to develop a low-cost technology for capture CO 2 from IGCC in the future...|$|R
40|$|Post {{combustion}} CO 2 capture using <b>amines</b> as chemical <b>absorbents</b> is {{a relatively}} mature technology. Rate of reaction and desorption energy demand are normally prime criteria for evaluation of new solvents while degradation and corrosion studies are often postponed. However, degradation and corrosion are in many cases showstoppers and should be considered at an early stage. In this work, a systematic study has been conducted on oxidative degradation of 30 wt% ethanolamine (MEA) for oxygen concentrations: 6, 21, 49 and 98 % and temperatures: 55, 65 and 75 °C. The formation of ten primary degradation compounds (acids, ammonia and alkyl amines) and seven secondary degradation compounds (HEGly, OZD, HEPO, HEF, HEA, HEI and BHEOX was monitored as function of time {{over a period of}} 3 – 6 weeks. The full comprehensive data set is available in the supplementary information for development of models describing the degradation behavior. Suggested mechanisms for formation of seven secondary degradation compounds; HEGly, HEPO, OZD, HEF, HEA, BHEOX and HEI from literature were compiled and discussed in view of the experimental results to suggest pathways which are more likely than others. The rate of MEA degradation increases with increasing temperature and oxygen concentration. The overall nitrogen balances were closed within 83 – 97 %; the higher deviations observed at the highest temperature, 75 °C. HEF, HEI and ammonia were the degradation compounds that most significantly contributed to the nitrogen balance in most experiments. However, at 6 % O 2 content, HEGly was the major nitrogen containing degradation compound identified. Formate was found to be the major anionic compound in all experiments. HEGly formation was found to be independent on O 2 partial pressure, but this may not be true for the further reaction of HEGly. The results suggests OZD formation to be oxygen dependent. However, only one mechanism is so far suggested for an oxygen dependent pathway. Both OZD and HEPO concentrations increase with oxygen concentration. Separate laboratory experiments at constant temperature (55 – 75 °C) do not capture the HEPO formation seen in pilot plant samples indicating that higher temperatures and/or temperature cycles are necessary. The results clearly show that performing accelerated degradation tests with 98 % oxygen cannot easily be extrapolated to what happens at 6 % oxygen, and therefore may not be representative for the situation in an industrial plant both with regard to rates of formation and products formed...|$|R
40|$|AfficheA {{method to}} fight against global warming {{consists}} in reducing CO 2 emissions. Industrial CO 2 capture processes developed to remove CO 2 from industrial effluents are based on repeated absorption-desorption cycles of CO 2 in selective absorbents such as aqueous solutions of amines. Research and development are actually carried out on both absorbent selection [1, 2, 3] and process optimization {{in order to reduce}} total cost of CO 2 capture. Thermodynamic properties are of major importance to study gas dissolution and to design capture process units. Demixing <b>amines</b> are the <b>absorbents</b> considerate in this study. The singularity of aqueous solutions of demixing amines with CO 2 is a liquid-liquid phase separation at a specific temperature and CO 2 loading. Therefore, in regeneration step, the stripper receives only the CO 2 rich phase. In these conditions, some improvements in the CO 2 capture process could be done in order to reduce cost of solvent regeneration. Liquid-liquid equilibria (LLE), excess molar enthalpies of mixing and molar heat capacities were measured for different {water - amine} systems. Calorimetric investigations were performed to study the systems {water - amine - CO 2 } {{in order to determine the}} enthalpies of solution and the limits of gas solubility. The different experimental techniques used in this study are presented here. LLE were measured using both a microDSCIII apparatus from Setaram and an equilibrium cell SPM 20 from Thar Technologies. Molar heat capacities of aqueous solution of amine in the one phase region were obtained from microDSCIII measurements. Excess molar enthalpies of mixing were measured by a flow calorimetric technique using a BT 2. 15 from Setaram. The calorimeter was equipped with a mixing cell developed in the laboratory. In the same way the enthalpies of mixing of CO 2 with absorbent are performed using a C- 80 from Setaram. The techniques and the different results are reported in this presentation. [1] L. Rodier, K.

40|$|The {{removal of}} acid gases {{especially}} CO₂ is highly demand {{due to the}} fact that CO₂ can cause greenhouse effect and also corrosion along the pipeline and at equipment can lowering the heating value of natural gas. In industry most common absorption process is using the <b>amine</b> solution chemical <b>absorbent.</b> However, the use of amine as a solvent to capture CO 2 give some disadvantages which need to be stress in order to make efficient process for CO 2 capture such as foaming, corrosion of equipment and pipeline. In recent research, they found the new solvents that can perform better than amines in absorbing CO 2 which are ionic liquids (ILs). Foaming occurred due to few reasons such as the high gas and the presence of contaminants that enter the process or generated within the process. Since foaming is one of the severe problems in acid-gas removal process, therefore, in this work, two types of ionic liquids are used to study their foaming behavior at different temperature for the removal of CO 2. In this study, the ILs that is used were 1 -n-butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([bmim][BF 4]) and ln- butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium chloride ([bmim] [Cl]) and amine used is Nmethyldiethanolamine (MDEA) with temperature variation from 30 ºC to 60 ºC. 4 M of MDEA and 2 M of ILs in 100 ml of water of each ILs used was prepared. Carbon dioxide gas is then forced into the solution for 5 minutes prior to start the experiment. A constant nitrogen flow is allowed through the diffuser stone into the solution as the bubbling gas. The height of the foam and the time for foam to break until its original height is recorded as the experimental result. Based on the result, it shows that increasing the temperature has lowering the foam formation. Therefore, less foaming is recorded at temperature 60 oC compared to 300 C. This is because the surface tension of the solution is decreasing at the same concentration used for MDEA while for [bmim][BF 4], it is due to the effect of poor foam stability and reduction of the bulk viscosity of the solution. It has also been found that, [bmim][BF 4] solution shows less foaming compared with [bmim][Cl] solution. As a conclusion, it can be said that [bmim][BF 4] solution is a very effective ionic liquids since its ability to capture CO 2 has been proved by researcher and that it also form less foaming compared to MDEA and [bmim][Cl] solution...|$|R
