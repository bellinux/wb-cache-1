5|$|During extreme conditions, some frogs enter a {{state of}} torpor and remain {{inactive}} for months. In colder regions, many species of frog hibernate in winter. Those that live on land such as the <b>American</b> <b>toad</b> (Bufo americanus) dig a burrow and make a hibernaculum in which to lie dormant. Others, less proficient at digging, find a crevice or bury themselves in dead leaves. Aquatic species such as the American bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) normally sink {{to the bottom of}} the pond where they lie, semi-immersed in mud but still able to access the oxygen dissolved in the water. Their metabolism slows down and they live on their energy reserves. Some frogs can even survive being frozen. Ice crystals form under the skin and in the body cavity but the essential organs are protected from freezing by a high concentration of glucose. An apparently lifeless, frozen frog can resume respiration and the heart beat can restart when conditions warm up.|$|E

25|$|Frogs are {{commonly}} found in the springtime, especially after extensive wet periods. Common species include the <b>American</b> <b>toad</b> and species of chorus frogs commonly called spring peepers, which are found in nearly every pond. Some years have outbreaks of cicadas or ladybugs. Mosquitoes, no-see-ums, and houseflies are common insect nuisances, especially in July and August; because of this, windows are nearly universally fitted with screens. Invasive populations of honeybees have sharply declined in recent years. Numerous native species of pollinator insects have recovered to fill their ecological niche, and armadillos have been regularly seen throughout the St. Louis area, especially since 2005.|$|E
25|$|Female {{frogs and}} toads usually spawn {{gelatinous}} egg masses containing thousands of eggs in water. Different species lay eggs in distinctive and identifiable ways. For example, the <b>American</b> <b>toad</b> lays long strings of eggs. The eggs are highly vulnerable to predation, so frogs have evolved many techniques to ensure {{the survival of the}} next generation. In colder areas the embryo is black to absorb more heat from the sun, which speeds up development. Most commonly, this involves synchronous reproduction. Many individuals will breed at the same time, overwhelming the actions of predators; the majority of the offspring will still die due to predation, but there is a greater chance some will survive. Another way in which some species avoid predators and the pathogens eggs are exposed to in ponds is to lay eggs on leaves above the pond, with a gelatinous coating designed to retain moisture. In these species the tadpoles drop into the water upon hatching. The eggs of some species laid out of water can detect vibrations of nearby predatory wasps or snakes, and will hatch early to avoid being eaten.|$|E

40|$|Roads {{are known}} to {{negatively}} affect many vertebrate species and populations. This research quantified a number of effects of roads on Nova Scotia amphibians. The greatest mean Cl- concentrations in roadside ponds occurred in spring, least in early summer, and a rising trend in late summer, probably due to late summer evaporation. Cl- in some ponds exceeded recommendations {{for the protection of}} aquatic life. Amphibian species richness had a negative relationship with Cl- concentration in ponds. Wood frogs, spotted salamanders, and pickerel frogs occupied low Cl- ponds while green frogs, spring peepers, <b>American</b> <b>toads,</b> blue-spotted salamanders, and leopard frogs occupied low and high chloride ponds equally. Chronic exposures of amphibian eggs to road salt indicate no negative effects on hatching success or development with green frogs and spotted salamanders, but significant effects on hatching and development with wood frogs and <b>American</b> <b>toads.</b> Chronic exposures of spotted salamander larvae to road salt showed lengthened larval period, decreased weight at metamorphosis, and mortality in high salt treatments.
