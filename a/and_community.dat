40|$|Abstract. The rapid loss of {{biodiversity}} due to habitat degradation and over exploitation has necessitated the conservation prioritization of habitats, species <b>and</b> <b>communities</b> for conservation. The prioritization of habitats <b>and</b> <b>communities</b> through qualitative <b>and</b> {{quantitative assessment of}} vegetation is prerequisite for initiating any conservation and management programme. Therefore, an attempt has been made to; (i) identify the habitats and communities; (ii) evaluate habitats <b>and</b> <b>communities</b> for species richness, native, endemic, economically important and threatened species; (iii) prioritize habitats <b>and</b> <b>communities</b> for conservation. Fifteen (15) habitats and fourteen forest (14) communities distributed between 2490 - 4000 m were recorded. Overall, 35. 71 % communities were broad-leaved, 57. 14 % coniferous and 7. 14 % mixed. The habitats <b>and</b> <b>communities</b> have been evaluated for the species richness, native, endemic, economically important and threatened species. Based on these attributes habitats <b>and</b> <b>communities</b> have been prioritized. Among communities Abies pindrow- Pinus wallichiana mixed, Fraxinus xanthoxyloides, Picea smithiana- Pinus wallichiana mixed and Cedrus deodara-Acer cappadocicum mixed showed highest CPI and habitats forest, shady moist showed highest CPI value. Regular monitoring of the prioritized habitats <b>and</b> <b>communities</b> has been suggested. Also, mass scale propagation of native, endemic, economically important and threatene...|$|R
