5|$|The U.S. offered two squadrons of Boeing B-47 Stratojets {{for free}} lease pending the {{delivery}} of the F-111; Australia declined the offer in June 1964—despite the aircraft having been demonstrated around the country just before the 1963 election as an interim Canberra replacement, likely <b>another</b> <b>sign</b> of the American preference for Menzies— because the B-47 did not offer significant improvements over the Canberra and, like the V bombers, would require longer runways.|$|E
5|$|When the {{pressure}} within the skull (intracranial pressure, abbreviated ICP) rises too high, {{it can be}} deadly. Signs of increased ICP include decreasing level of consciousness, paralysis or weakness {{on one side of}} the body, and a blown pupil, one that fails to constrict in response to light or is slow to do so. Cushing's triad, a slow heart rate with high blood pressure and respiratory depression is a classic manifestation of significantly raised ICP. Anisocoria, unequal pupil size, is <b>another</b> <b>sign</b> of serious TBI. Abnormal posturing, a characteristic positioning of the limbs caused by severe diffuse injury or high ICP, is an ominous sign.|$|E
5|$|Victorious Boxers {{does not}} use a damage or life meter. Instead, visible damage {{can be seen on}} a boxer's face, which is most {{noticeable}} between rounds when the characters are sitting in their corners. The amount of damage taken is reflected by bruises, swelling, and black eyes on the characters' faces. <b>Another</b> <b>sign</b> of damage is the characters' speed of movement throughout the fight. The characters begin to move slower and the controls become less responsive to simulate fatigue. The more a boxer is hit or uses special moves, the more their stamina is affected. Distance is a factor in determining a punch's damage. For example, a jab thrown while next to an opponent will not do as much damage as it would at arms length. Also, right hooks do not do as much damage if the character is positioned to the opponent's left and vice versa.|$|E

5|$|While the Polish {{king and}} the Senate of Poland were debating on the course of action, the {{patience}} of foreign powers was running out. Eventually, {{one of the most}} prominent opponents of agreeing to the foreign demands, bishop Adam Stanisław Krasiński, was abducted by Cossacks and transported to Warsaw, where the foreign ambassadors demanded that the King and the Senate call in the Sejm (the entire Polish parliament) to ratify the partition. In <b>another</b> <b>sign</b> of their influence, the next meeting of the Senate saw the senators from the annexed territories denied participation (those denied participation included the bishop of Inflanty, the voivode of Ruthenia and the voivode of Witebsk). When no help was forthcoming and the armies of the combined nations occupied Warsaw to compel by force of arms the calling of the assembly, no alternative was available save passive submission to their will. Warsaw was de facto a garrison of the foreign powers, with their forces commanded by the Austrian (or Russian, sources vary) general Abram Romanius (Abraham). On 19 April the Senate agreed to call for the Sejm to convene.|$|E
25|$|The {{departure}} of Brendan Taman on January 13, 2009, was <b>another</b> <b>sign</b> that this era {{was coming to}} an end and a new one was beginning. On February 18, 2009, Milt Stegall did retire from the CFL which formally ended the Milt Stegall era.|$|E
25|$|In 1904 {{a marine}} fish {{hatchery}} was established at Aquarium Point, Portobello. <b>Another</b> <b>sign</b> of changing attitudes to wild {{life was the}} self-establishment of the royal albatross colony at Taiaroa Head in the 1920s which was now carefully nurtured for its scientific interest.|$|E

25|$|Beyond {{the strong}} winds because of updraft/downdraft behavior, heavy rain (and hail) is <b>another</b> <b>sign</b> of a squall line. In the winter, squall lines can occur albeit less {{frequently}} – bringing heavy snow and/or thunder and lightning – usually over inland lakes (i.e. Great Lakes region).|$|E
25|$|India's Left {{parties that}} have criticised Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's {{government}} on the India-US civilian nuclear deal had vehemently protested the exercise, seeing it as <b>another</b> <b>sign</b> of the growing closeness between the two countries. At one time, the Indian government was known to have considered postponing or canceling the exercise but the Indian Navy put its foot down, saying the logistics involved made any delay impossible.|$|E
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>sign</b> of Graves' {{disease is}} hyperthyroidism, i.e., {{overproduction}} of the thyroid hormones T3 and T4. Normal thyroid levels are also seen, and occasionally also hypothyroidism, which may assist in causing goiter (though {{it is not}} the cause of the Graves' disease). Hyperthyroidism in Graves' disease is confirmed, as with any other cause of hyperthyroidism, by measuring elevated blood levels of free (unbound) T3 and T4.|$|E

25|$|While {{this was}} taking place, in 1909 Stieglitz was {{notified}} about yet <b>another</b> <b>sign</b> {{of the increasingly}} difficult times. London’s Linked Ring, which {{for more than a}} decade Stieglitz had looked to as model for the Photo-Secession, finally dissolved in antipathy. Stieglitz knew this signaled the end of an era, but rather than be set back by these changes he began making plans to integrate Camera Work even further into the realm of modern art.|$|E
25|$|On 29 September 1885, as <b>another</b> <b>sign</b> of peace, Bismarck {{proposed}} the Pope as arbiter {{in a dispute}} with Spain about the Caroline Islands and accepted his verdict in favour of Spain. In gratitude but to the great horror of Catholics, the Pope awarded Bismarck the Supreme Order of Christ, the highest order of chivalry to be granted by the Holy See. Bismarck was the only Protestant ever to receive this award.|$|E
25|$|High {{concentrations}} of cytosolic citrate can inhibit phosphofructokinase, the catalyst {{of one of}} the rate-limiting steps of glycolysis. This effect is advantageous: high {{concentrations of}} citrate indicate that there is a large supply of biosynthetic precursor molecules, so {{there is no need for}} phosphofructokinase to continue to send molecules of its substrate, fructose 6-phosphate, into glycolysis. Citrate acts by augmenting the inhibitory effect of high concentrations of ATP, <b>another</b> <b>sign</b> that there is no need to carry out glycolysis.|$|E
5000|$|The work of Vicente Giner {{is still}} {{relatively}} unexplored. To date {{only about a}} dozen works {{have been attributed to}} him. Signed paintings by him are even rarer.

25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>sign</b> of Stickler {{syndrome}} is mild to {{severe hearing loss}} that, for some people, may be progressive (see hearing loss with craniofacial syndromes). The joints of affected {{children and young adults}} may be very flexible (hypermobile). Arthritis often appears at an early age and worsens as a person gets older. Learning difficulties, not intelligence, can also occur because of hearing and sight impairments if the school is not informed and the student is not assisted within the learning environment.|$|E
25|$|In November 2007, the Blue Condominium, a 32-unit, 16 story luxury {{condominium}} {{tower was}} completed at 105 Norfolk Street {{just north of}} Delancey Street, the pixellated, faceted blue design of which starkly contrasts with the surrounding neighborhood. Following {{the construction of the}} Hotel on Rivington one block away, several luxury condominiums around Houston, and the New Museum on Bowery, this new wave of construction is <b>another</b> <b>sign</b> that the gentrification cycle is entering a high-luxury phase similar to in SoHo and Nolita in the previous decade.|$|E
25|$|In Florida, 1964 was {{the year}} when a Republican {{candidate}} for governor polled more than 36.1% in the general election, <b>another</b> <b>sign</b> of changing politics. It was a strong showing for relative newcomer Claude R. Kirk, Jr., a Democrat-turned-Republican from California, as he ran against veteran Democratic U.S. Senator Spessard Holland, the former governor {{and head of the}} Florida Democratic establishment. Trying to build up recognition and support, Kirk appealed to Cramer to address meetings held during the delegate and national committeeman races, and thus became acquainted with Republican party activists.|$|E
50|$|On 7 July 2008, Gygax {{moved to}} 1. FC Nürnberg in Germany. He left the team on 30 June 2010 to join FC Luzern.

50|$|<b>Another</b> <b>signing</b> to the Neat Label were Fist. Thompson {{produced}} some tracks with Fist and actually joined the band guitar {{for a while}} replacing Dave Irwin. His membership of Fist was short-lived and based largely {{on the fact that}} Fist wanted to record some of Thompson's songs but felt that any writer should also {{be a member of the}} band.|$|R
25|$|World War II saw {{the removal}} of {{expatriate}} leadership and a path towards an indigenous church was more clearly set. The Malayan Christian Council (MCC), founded in 1948, coordinated mission groups during the Malayan Emergency. Chinese relocated into 'New Villages' were served by missionaries, sometimes ex-China, who worked alongside local Christians in social and medical work. However, after independence in 1957, many churches were overdependent on expatriates. In the 1970s churches developed structures independent of Singapore {{as well as of}} overseas support. Recent growth in independent churches is <b>another</b> <b>sign</b> of a desire to establish a Malaysian Christian identity.|$|E
25|$|Since 2003, Argentina and Brazil have coordinated their {{positions}} in the multilateral fora, {{as can be seen}} by their joint participation in the agricultural negotiations at the WTO meeting in Cancún, their joint position in regards {{to the creation of the}} Free Trade Area of the Americas, and their articulation at the G-20 to reform the international financial system. The creation of the Union of South American Nations, in 2008, was a landmark in the new foreign policies of Brazil and Argentina. In <b>another</b> <b>sign</b> of mutual trust, since 2003, diplomats from both countries occupy a single seat in the United Nations Security Council when either of them hold a non-permanent seat.|$|E

They continue on, passing a small town, where Eugene is almost hit by a falling walker corpse falling from a roof before Abraham pushes {{him out of the}} way; the incident causes Tara to injury her foot. Abraham argues it is too dangerous to cover for Eugene, but Glenn allows them to use his riot suit to help protect Eugene if Abraham will continue on with them. Abraham agrees, and they find a usable vehicle and some supplies to continue.|$|E
