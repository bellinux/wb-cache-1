The Sunday Business Post stated that what the European Council had offered were Decisions and/or Declarations, not protocols. Decisions and/or Declarations of the European Council are agreements made between all twenty-seven member states of the European Union and {{are not part of}} a treaty, whereas protocols are <b>agreements</b> <b>between</b> <b>states</b> as part of a treaty. Previous examples of Decisions and/or Declarations following a referendum rejection include the 1992 Edinburgh Agreement (following the first Danish referendum on the Maastricht Treaty) and the 2002 Seville Declaration (following the first Irish referendum on the Treaty of Nice). French President Nicolas Sarkozy, speaking to the European Parliament in his capacity as President of the European Council during the six-month presidency of that body by France, stated that the legal guarantees would be added as a protocol later to the treaty, enabling Croatia to join the European Union legally.|$|E

50|$|One {{significant}} part of treaty making is that signing a treaty implies recognition {{that the other side}} is a sovereign state and that the agreement being considered is enforceable under international law. Hence, nations can be very careful about terming an agreement to be a treaty. For example, within the United States, <b>agreements</b> <b>between</b> <b>states</b> are compacts and <b>agreements</b> <b>between</b> <b>states</b> and the federal government or between agencies of the government are memoranda of understanding.|$|E

It does apply, however, to treaties between states within an intergovernmental organization. However, <b>agreements</b> <b>between</b> <b>states</b> and international organizations, or between international organizations themselves, will be governed by the 1986 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties between States and International Organizations or Between International Organizations if it ever enters into force. Also, in treaties between states and international organizations, {{the terms of the}} Convention still apply between the state members. The Convention does not apply to agreements not in written form.|$|E

50|$|The {{biggest problem}} in the {{government}} at the time, in Hamilton’s opinion, was the principle of legislation for states in a collective manner which created multiple sovereigns. This meant that laws passed by the government, while constitutionally binding, became suggestions that the states could either follow, or not follow. This occurred because Confederation legislated only for corporations or communities, not individual people. Such legislation's meant {{that the only way}} laws involving citizens could be enforced was through violence, which would not happen. Hamilton believed that because of this treaties or <b>agreements</b> <b>between</b> <b>states</b> held very little value and could not be depended upon. He also believed the states of a country could stand in relation to one another. While it would not be ideal it would be “consistent and practicable”, and if there was still desire for a national government, it would have to take on different characteristics. The very idea of a government implies the power to make laws, laws that contain a consequence or penalty that can be applied by a court of law or the military, however, no such system existed under the Articles of Confederation that could enforce the laws, which in effect made the government useless. For Hamilton, government was created because the endeavors of men do not conform to the “dictates of reason and justice” and groups of men act with more intelligence than those acting alone {{due to the fact that}} reputation would have less of an influence on their actions. Hamilton also believed that due to the nature of sovereign powers people became obsessed with their own power. Such obsessions would reduce their desire to compromise, proving that a government cannot be run in such a way. Hamilton ends his argument by attacking the Articles of Confederation, stating that this system was destined to fail, not immediately but slowly with everyone “yielding to the persuasive voice of immediate interest and convenience, till the frail and tottering edifice seems ready to fall upon our heads and to crush us beneath its ruins”.|$|E

Recent decisions from the high courts of several states have brought attention to a meaningful tension in the goals of the Multistate Tax Compact, an <b>agreement</b> <b>between</b> <b>states.</b> Though the federal government has ruled that no congressional approval is necessary based on the Compact Clause of the U. S. Constitution, this <b>agreement</b> <b>between</b> <b>states</b> has taken its place as an important accord among the vast majority of jurisdictions. Having operated as the most effective solution to the problems identified by Congress in the 1960 ’s Willis Report, the Compact simultaneously disavows its binding authority and relies on the reliance of States on it to meet its goal of promoting uniformity in state tax administration.

40|$|This paper investigates {{conditions}} under which fisheries <b>agreements</b> <b>between</b> <b>states</b> are self-enforcing. Cooperative solutions can be self-enforcing if {{parties to the agreement}} punish those who depart from the cooperative solution by doing likewise, thereby causing a loss to the deviant that outweighs transient gains from deviation. Two kinds of deviation are examined: (i) effort deviation and (ii) time deviation. Both of these are linked to the excess capacity available in the fishery. It is investigated how the number of players that can be accommodated in a cooperative solution depends on fishing costs, the discount rate, and the growth rate of the fish stock, for a given level of excess fishing capacity. Furthermore, it is investigated how the possibility of maintaining a cooperative solution depends on the level of excess fishing capacity, and whether or not it would be profitable to invest in excess fishing capacity. Finally it is discussed how cost differences among players will affect the viability of the cooperative solution...|$|E

While some compacts assign their administration to existing state agencies, compacts requiring greater coordination among states may establish an interstate agency, typically called a commission, to administer their provisions. Congress must give its consent to compacts that affect the balance of power between the states and the federal government. An example of a congressionally approved environment and natural resource compact is the Tahoe Regional Planning Compact, which created the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (TRPA) to administer its provisions. For such compacts, GAO determined (1) the organizational structures, powers and authorities, and dispute resolution and public accountability mechanisms; (2) the extent to which concerns have been raised about the structure and governance of compacts that have commissions; and (3) how the structure and governance of TRPA compares to those of other similar compact commissions.
