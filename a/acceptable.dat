5|$|Contaminated {{breathing}} gas {{at depth}} can be fatal. Concentrations which are <b>acceptable</b> {{at the surface}} ambient pressure will be increased by the pressure of depth and may then exceed <b>acceptable</b> or tolerable limits. Common contaminants are: carbon monoxide - a by-product of combustion, carbon dioxide - a product of metabolism, and oil and lubricants from the compressor.|$|E
5|$|The {{semantic}} {{attribute of}} animacy is syntactically important: thus the sentence, 'the bread was eaten by me', which is <b>acceptable</b> in English, {{would not be}} <b>acceptable</b> in Mongolian. The reciprocal voice is marked by -ld-, the plurative by -tsgaa-, and the cooperative by -lts-.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} January, Pole {{had dropped}} to twenty-one votes, but the French faction {{remained}} split between Carafa, de Bourbon, Lorraine, and Salviati; Este's candidacy, though desired {{by many in the}} French College, had not yet been put forward, perhaps having been held back in hopes that he would be more <b>acceptable</b> as the conclave dragged on. Toward the end of January, in accordance with traditional efforts to counter dillatory cardinals, the amenities and rations of the conclave were decreased and the upper story windows were closed to reduce the natural lighting and fresh air. Soon afterwards, Ridolfithe French candidate most <b>acceptable</b> to Farnesedied amid accusations of poisoning on January 31.|$|E
5|$|Civil {{divorce is}} not a divorce {{according}} to the Church. If it is deemed {{to be the only}} way of ensuring legal rights, care of children, or protection of inheritance, the Church considers it morally <b>acceptable.</b>|$|E
5|$|Galeazzo Marescotti, {{a member}} of the zelanti, was the first serious {{candidate}} proposed two weeks in to the conclave. He was <b>acceptable</b> to the Spanish, but was opposed by the French because they wanted the new pope who was not strong. Bandino Panciatici was suggested by Pietro Ottoboni, but he was not supported by secular monarchs because he had supported giving benefices to nominees who were independent of the secular authorities. Giacomo Antonio Morigia was <b>acceptable</b> to the secular rulers, but was opposed by the zelanti for lacking governing experience in addition to not being firm or having the energy required. Following the proposal of these candidates, others came up as well, but were quickly rejected.|$|E
5|$|Guitar Hero {{has also}} been {{considered}} to have made the use of special peripherals more commonplace and <b>acceptable</b> for consumers for games that followed, including Nintendo's Wii console and games such as Mario Kart Wii and Wii Fit.|$|E
5|$|Impression Management {{is defined}} as when an {{individual}} attempts to present an <b>acceptable</b> image to those around him or her verbally or nonverbally (480). This definition is based on Goffman’s idea that individuals see themselves as others view them, so in essence they attempt {{to see themselves as}} if they are outside looking in (480). Goffman also dedicating this work to discover the subtle ways humans present <b>acceptable</b> images by concealing information that may conflict with the images for a particular situation. For instance, concealing tattoos when applying for a job in which tattoos would be inappropriate, or hiding a bizarre obsession such as collecting/interacting with dolls which society as a whole may see as abnormal.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Senate Democrats {{suggested}} Sotomayor, among others, to President George W. Bush as an <b>acceptable</b> {{nominee to}} fill the seat of retiring Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.|$|E
5|$|In February 2010, Zardari {{sparked a}} {{standoff}} {{by attempting to}} appoint a Supreme Court candidate without the court's approval, but the confrontation ended after he backed down and nominated a candidate <b>acceptable</b> by the court.|$|E

5|$|Many {{distinct}} factors {{influence the}} strength of welds and the material around them, including the welding method, the amount and concentration of energy input, the weldability of the base material, filler material, and flux material, {{the design of the}} joint, and the interactions between all these factors. To test the quality of a weld, either destructive or nondestructive testing methods are commonly used to verify that welds are free of defects, have <b>acceptable</b> levels of residual stresses and distortion, and have <b>acceptable</b> heat-affected zone (HAZ) properties. Types of welding defects include cracks, distortion, gas inclusions (porosity), non-metallic inclusions, lack of fusion, incomplete penetration, lamellar tearing, and undercutting.|$|E
5|$|Other words {{listed in}} this article, such as suq, umiaq or qiviut, are also <b>acceptable,</b> but since these contain a u, {{they are less}} likely to be useful in the {{situation}} described.|$|E
5|$|Screening of {{toddlers}} {{has been}} suggested, and {{results of a}} trial on 10,000 one-year-olds were published in 2016. Work was needed to find whether screening was cost-effective, and <b>acceptable</b> to families.|$|E
5|$|Some {{processes}} {{convert a}} meat or dairy product into a pareve (neither meat nor dairy) one. For example, rennet is sometimes made from stomach linings, yet is <b>acceptable</b> for making kosher cheese, but such cheeses {{might not be}} <b>acceptable</b> to some vegetarians, who would eat only cheese made from a vegetarian rennet. The same applies to kosher gelatin, an animal product, derived from kosher animal sources. Other gelatin-like products from non-animal sources such as agar agar and carrageenan are pareve by nature. Fish gelatin is derived from fish and is therefore (like all kosher fish products) pareve. Eggs are also considered pareve despite being an animal product.|$|E
5|$|Some {{training}} agencies {{teach the}} concept of minimum gas, rock bottom gas management or critical pressures which allows a diver to calculate an <b>acceptable</b> reserve to get two divers to the surface in an emergency from any point in the planned dive profile.|$|E
5|$|Sportsmanship {{is also an}} {{important}} aspect when it comes to fights. While an enforcer may start a fight in response to foul play, it is generally not <b>acceptable</b> to start a fight to retaliate against an opponent who scored fairly.|$|E
5|$|Subjects may be {{instructed}} not {{to judge}} {{whether or not the}} sentence is grammatically <b>acceptable</b> or logical, but whether the proposition expressed by the sentence is true or false. This task is commonly used in psycholinguistic studies of child language.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} {{exceeded the}} <b>acceptable</b> plot ratio {{in the town}} planning scheme, however the Perth City Council pre-approved the plans nonetheless, {{on the condition that}} Bond Corporation kept the Palace Hotel operating as a hotel.|$|E
5|$|The film grossed {{less than}} its budget of $175 million worldwide, and {{received}} generally negative reviews. Evan Almighty was also notable for {{allegations that the}} many animals used in the film were treated poorly, but Universal Pictures stressed the animals' conditions were <b>acceptable.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{losses of}} the spring {{campaign}} had weakened the Luftwaffe before the Battle of Britain. The service was forced to wait until it had reached <b>acceptable</b> levels before a main assault against the RAF could be made.|$|E
5|$|These {{modifications}} increased {{weight by}} nearly 24,000 pounds, and decreased operational range by 8–11%. This was considered <b>acceptable</b> {{for the increase}} in capabilities.|$|E
5|$|This {{suggested}} that the single reconstructed arch of the Hurva {{could no longer be}} understood as a satisfactory expression of any commitment to rebuild the lost synagogue nor as an <b>acceptable</b> official response to its intentional destruction in 1948.|$|E
5|$|A stay-at-home dad (alternatively, {{stay at home}} father, house dad, SAHD, househusband, or house-spouse) is {{a father}} who is the main {{caregiver}} {{of the children and}} is the homemaker of the household. As families have evolved, the practice of being a stay-at-home dad has become more common, and socially more <b>acceptable.</b>|$|E
5|$|Coat: The Labrador Retriever's coat {{should be}} short and dense, but not wiry. The coat is water-resistant, so the dog {{does not get}} cold when taking to water in the winter. That means that the dog {{naturally}} has a slightly dry, oily coat. <b>Acceptable</b> colours are black, yellow, and chocolate.|$|E
5|$|Ductility is an {{important}} factor in ensuring the integrity of structures by enabling them to sustain local stress concentrations without fracture. In addition, structures are required to be of an <b>acceptable</b> strength, which is related to a material's yield strength. In general, as the yield strength of a material increases, there is a corresponding reduction in fracture toughness.|$|E
5|$|His {{wife was}} the target of an {{attempted}} assassination in Tucson, Arizona, on January 8, 2011. After the shooting, in which six people were killed, both Kelly and Giffords were thrust into the media spotlight. His wife's shooting led to a broad national conversation ranging from the duties of a husband to what is <b>acceptable</b> civil discourse.|$|E
5|$|Planning for a bypass around Northam {{began in}} the 1960s. The {{original}} route through the town centre functioned as both a local access road and primary traffic route, including for heavy vehicles. There were particular concerns {{with the amount of}} traffic congestion, frequency of crashes, and the noise and visual pollution of the highway's traffic. Twelve different alignments were considered for the bypass, which were narrowed down to three options by the 1990s. In 1993 the Environmental Protection Authority assessed the proposal, and found that only the route that deviated furthest away from the townsite would be environmentally <b>acceptable.</b> The closer routes were not <b>acceptable</b> due to the potential impact on the Avon River. The project gained the Minister for the Environment's conditional approval on 24 June 1994. Construction of the Northam bypass began in January 2001, with the new road opened on 17 May 2002.|$|E
5|$|Production of {{the coins}} did not {{commence}} until March11, {{more than a}} week after the passage of the Bland–Allison Act. The first <b>acceptable</b> strike, after adjustments to the press, was coined at 3:17p.m. at the Philadelphia Mint. This piece was given to President Hayes; the second and third were given to Secretary of the Treasury John Sherman and to Mint Director Henry Linderman.|$|E
5|$|Scientists and U.S. {{courts have}} {{rejected}} this objection {{on the grounds}} that science is not based on appeals to popularity, but on evidence. The scientific consensus of biologists determines what is considered <b>acceptable</b> science, not popular opinion or fairness, and although evolution is controversial in the public arena, it is entirely uncontroversial among experts in the field.|$|E
5|$|Several {{proposals}} {{were made in}} mid-2012 to purchase the debt of distressed European countries such as Spain and Italy. Markus Brunnermeier, the economist Graham Bishop, and Daniel Gros were among those advancing proposals. Finding a formula, which was not simply backed by Germany, is central in crafting an <b>acceptable</b> and effective remedy.|$|E
5|$|Sumptuary laws {{regulated}} {{the food}} that one consumed and the clothes that one wore according to status and social class. Clothing was made of hemp or cotton cloths, restricted to a colour standard of black and white. Trousers were the <b>acceptable</b> attire for peasants, soldiers, artisans, and merchants, although wealthy merchants might choose to wear more ornate clothing and male blouses that came down below the waist. <b>Acceptable</b> apparel for scholar-officials was rigidly defined by social ranking system. However, {{as time went on}} this rule of rank-graded apparel for officials was not as strictly enforced. Each official was able to display his awarded status by wearing different-coloured traditional silken robes that hung to the ground around his feet, specific types of headgear, and even specific styles of girdles that displayed his graded-rank of officialdom.|$|E
5|$|The United States Air Force {{monitored}} airborne contamination through nasal swabs of onsite personnel. Of the 9,837 nasal swabs taken, 335 samples had detectable {{levels of}} alpha particle activity, although none was above <b>acceptable</b> levels. Urinalysis was also performed {{but none of}} the 756 samples displayed any detectable level of plutonium.|$|E
5|$|The scheme {{provoked}} {{opposition from}} park users {{who felt that}} any reduction {{in the area of}} the park was not <b>acceptable.</b> 'Surprised by the extent of feeling', Bristol City Council decided to revise the plans. Campaigners then applied to have 'Town Green' status applied to the park, but this was declined in 2009.|$|E
5|$|The {{ultimatum}} {{contained an}} attachment: {{a draft of}} what would be deemed an <b>acceptable</b> response to the ultimatum. The proposed response stated only that Lithuania agreed to establish regular diplomatic relations, send a legation to Warsaw, and guarantee normal conditions of operation for a Polish legation in Kaunas.|$|E
5|$|There comes a {{time when}} the changes are so great that it is no longer enough to create further {{exceptions}} restricting the effect of the proposition, a time when the proposition itself requires examination to see whether its terms are in accord with what is generally regarded today as <b>acceptable</b> behaviour.|$|E
