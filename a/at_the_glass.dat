5|$|Cleveland {{held its}} {{training}} camp {{at the campus}} of Bowling Green State University, as it had the previous two years. Two preseason games were scheduled, one against the Buffalo Bills at the Rubber Bowl in Akron, Ohio and a second against the Baltimore Colts <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Glass</b> Bowl in Toledo, Ohio.|$|E
5|$|Before {{what was}} the second largest crowd to witness a game <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Glass</b> Bowl, Toledo {{defeated}} the Bowling Green Falcons 19–13 to win the Peace Pipe. After a Rusty Hanna field goal gave the Rockets an early 3–0 lead, a pair of Erik White touchdown passes gave the Falcons a 13–3 halftime lead. However, the Toledo defense shutout the Bowling Green offense in the second half, and the Rockets came back to win 19–13. Points were scored in the third on a seven-yard touchdown run by Kevin Meger and a one-yard Troy Parker touchdown run. Hanna added a field goal in the fourth. The victory improved Toledo's all-time record against Bowling Green to 22–29–4.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} game of the season, Toledo {{defeated}} the Arkansas State Indians 43–28 <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Glass</b> Bowl. The Indians scored first on a 24-yard Troy Mabone touchdown run followed by a one-yard Neil Trotter touchdown run for a 7–7 tie {{at the end of the}} first. In the second quarter Trotter scored on a two-yard run and Mabone on a one-yard run before a 38-yard Kevin Meger touchdown pass to Rickey Isaiah and 33-yard Rusty Hanna field goal gave the Rockets a 24–14 halftime lead.|$|E

5|$|In {{what was}} the Rockets' first all-time meeting against Navy, 14 {{unanswered}} points {{in the fourth quarter}} gave the Midshipmen the 14–10 win <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Glass</b> Bowl. Toledo led 10–0 as they entered the fourth quarter with points scored on a 34-yard Hanna field goal in the first and on a six-yard David Andrews touchdown run in the third. Navy came back to win the game in the fourth on a pair of Jason Pace touchdowns. The first came on a nine-yard run and the second on a five-yard reception from Alton Grizzard. The loss effectively resulted in the Rockets failing to get a bowl bid as Central Michigan got the automatic MAC bid to the California Bowl due to having the tiebreaker over Toledo.|$|E

25|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> {{transition}} temperature the resin in the composite softens and significantly increases thermal expansion; exceeding Tg then exerts mechanical overload {{on the board}} components - e.g. the joints and the vias. Below Tg the thermal expansion of the resin roughly matches copper and glass, above it gets significantly higher. As the reinforcement and copper confine the board along the plane, virtually all volume expansion projects to the thickness and stresses the plated-through holes. Repeated soldering or other exposition to higher temperatures can cause failure of the plating, especially with thicker boards; thick boards therefore require high Tg matrix.|$|E
25|$|The 2007 Glasgow Airport {{attack was}} a {{terrorist}} ramming attack which occurred on 30 June 2007, at 15:11 BST, when a dark green Jeep Cherokee loaded with propane canisters was driven <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> doors of the Glasgow Airport terminal and set ablaze. It was the first terrorist attack {{to take place in}} Scotland since the Lockerbie bombing in 1988. The attack took place three days after the appointment of Scottish MP Gordon Brown as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, but Downing Street dismissed suggestions of a connection. A close link was quickly established to the 2007 London car bombs the previous day. Although the doors were damaged, security bollards outside the entrance stopped the car from entering the terminal, where there were 4,000 people, with the potential for many fatalities.|$|E
25|$|Swiss diplomat Carl Lutz rescued tens of {{thousands}} of Jews by issuing Swiss protection papers and designating numerous buildings, including the now famous Glass House (Üvegház) at Vadász Street 29, to be Swiss protected territory. About 3,000 Hungarian Jews found refuge <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Glass</b> House and in a neighboring building. Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg managed to save the lives of tens {{of thousands}} of Jews in Budapest by giving them Swedish protection papers and taking them under his consular protection. Wallenberg was abducted by the Russians on 17 January 1945 and never regained freedom. Giorgio Perlasca, an Italian citizen, saved thousands of Hungarian Jews posing as a Spanish diplomat. Some other diplomats also abandoned diplomatic protocol and rescued Jews. There are two monuments for Wallenberg, one for Carl Lutz and one for Giorgio Perlasca in Budapest.|$|E

500|$|In {{their first}} home {{game of the}} 1990 season, Toledo {{defeated}} the Northern Illinois Huskies 23–14 in {{what was the first}} game played since the completion of an $18 million ($ in [...] dollars) renovation <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Glass</b> Bowl. Toledo scored first on an eight-yard run by Troy Parker to take an early 7–0 lead. The Huskies responded with a 15-yard run by Stacey Robinson to tie the game at 7–7 {{at the end of the}} first quarter. In the second quarter, Rusty Hanna then retook the lead for Toledo with his 23-yard field goal before Northern Illinois responded with a 12-yard Robinson touchdown pass to Ray Patterson for a 14–10 halftime lead for the Huskies.|$|E
500|$|Simpson {{began working}} with his father as a {{draughtsman}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> factory in Harworth. He was riding well; although not selected by Great Britain for the amateur world championships, he made the 4,000-metre team pursuit squad for the 1956 Olympics. In mid-September, Simpson competed for two weeks in Eastern Europe against Russian and Italian teams {{to prepare for the}} Olympics. The seven-rider contingent began with races in Leningrad, continuing to Moscow before finishing in Sofia. He was nicknamed [...] "the Sparrow" [...] by the Soviet press because of his slender build. The following month he was in Melbourne for the Olympics, where the team qualified for the team-pursuit semi-finals against Italy; they were confident of defeating South Africa and France but lost to Italy, taking the bronze medal. Simpson blamed himself for the loss for pushing too hard on a turn and being unable to recover for the next.|$|E

Following these performances, Bloc Party also subheadlined FYF Fest in Los Angeles on 22 August 2015. At these shows, the band confirmed that they've finished recording their next album. The shows marked the live debut for new bassist Justin Harris of the Portland, Oregon, indie rock outfit Menomena, {{who had previously}} opened several Bloc Party U.S. tour dates in April 2009; and Louise Bartle, who was accidentally announced a month earlier as Bloc Party's drummer by instrument manufacturer Natal Drums in a since-deleted tweet, leading to fan speculation regarding her membership that was ultimately proved correct. These shows also included the first performances of two new songs called [...] "Eden" [...] and [...] "Exes" [...] according to the setlist.|$|E

2500|$|Yellowcard {{released}} {{dates for}} concerts {{for part of}} 2010 {{and the majority of}} 2011. The band toured with All Time Low throughout Europe in March 2011, around {{the same time that the}} album was released. On November 13, 2010, the band played its first show after coming back from hiatus <b>at</b> <b>The</b> <b>Glass</b> House in Pomona, California. This was the first time the whole band had played together since December 2007. During the show, Ryan Key revealed the name of the new record after insistent chants. The new record, he announced, was to be titled When You're Through Thinking, Say Yes. Shortly afterward, the group played the first single from the new record, [...] "For You, and Your Denial". Responding to the apparent lack of Yellowcard's older work <b>at</b> <b>The</b> <b>Glass</b> House show, Key stated that it was to keep the energy up in the crowds. In addition to the Europe tour in March, Yellowcard announced a spring 2011 U.S. tour with All Time Low, Hey Monday, and The Summer Set. In the late spring and early summer of 2011, Yellowcard participated in a brief U.S. tour with Good Charlotte and Runner Runner. In June 2011, during an interview with Punkvideosrock.com, Ryan Key stated that the band would participate in a headlining tour in the fall of 2011. In fall 2011, the band headlined a U.S. tour with Go Radio and Every Avenue (with whom Ryan Key had co-written two songs: [...] "Girl Like That" [...] (2009) and [...] "Tie Me Down" [...] (2011)).|$|E
2500|$|In the past, {{prior to}} {{beginning}} of the segment, Cramer would abuse the office chair provided for him by throwing {{it on top of}} other [...] "victims" [...] (damaged office chairs), also damaging the studio's wall and glass displays as well. The damage was made apparent by a caller in the [...] "Lightning Round" [...] on March1, 2006, which prompted Cramer to throw his chair again <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> display, causing it to crack even more. Cramer has said that the reason why he throws chairs is because he hates sitting down on the job. He often had to be at his old hedge fund by 4:30a.m., and if his employees sat down they would often try to go to sleep, so chairs became [...] "the enemy".|$|E

2500|$|The glass {{transition}} temperature (Tg) of atactic PMMA is [...] [...] The Tg values of commercial grades of PMMA range from the range is so wide because of the vast number of commercial compositions which are copolymers with co-monomers other than methyl methacrylate. [...] PMMA is thus an organic glass at room temperature; i.e., it is below its Tg. [...] The forming temperature starts <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> transition temperature and goes up from there. [...] All common molding processes may be used, including injection molding, compression molding, and extrusion. [...] The highest quality PMMA sheets are produced by cell casting, but in this case, the polymerization and molding steps occur concurrently. [...] The strength of the material is higher than molding grades owing to its extremely high molecular mass. [...] Rubber toughening {{has been used to}} increase the toughness of PMMA owing to its brittle behavior in response to applied loads.|$|E
2500|$|Martin {{attracted}} the attention of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Columbia Pictures, but a Hollywood contract was not forthcoming. He met comic Jerry Lewis <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Glass</b> Hat Club in New York, where both were performing. Martin and Lewis formed a fast friendship which led to their participation in each other's acts and the formation of a music-comedy team. Martin and Lewis's debut together occurred at Atlantic City's 500 Club on July 24, 1946, and they were not well received. The owner, Skinny D'Amato, warned them that if they did not {{come up with a better}} act for their second show that night, they would be fired. Huddling in the alley behind the club, Lewis and Martin agreed to [...] "go for broke", they divided their act between songs, skits, and ad-libbed material. Martin sang and Lewis dressed as a busboy, dropping plates and making a shambles of Martin's performance and the club's decorum until Lewis was chased from the room as Martin pelted him with breadrolls.|$|E
2500|$|On July 22, 1968, a riot {{between rival}} teenage gangs {{broke out in}} {{downtown}} Mexico City. Most members of these gangs were students at the Vocational Schools #2 and #5 pitted against members enrolled at the Isaac Ochotorena preparatory school. The fight started when the former threw stones <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> windows of the latter school. The riots resumed the following day. Answering the call to restore order, the police entered with force into Vocational School #5; claiming that it was to capture members of street gangs who had enrolled in the school. The granaderos (riot police) were used by the Mexican government to control and suppress the student demonstrators and they were first used against the students in July 1968. However, the riot police assaulted numerous students and teachers {{in the process of}} clearing Vocational School #5. In an informal interview with some granaderos, Antonio Careaga recounted that, [...] "the granaderos said that the authorities gave the men in the riot squad thirty pesos (three dollars) for every student they clubbed and hauled off to jail." ...|$|E
