5|$|Three {{to seven}} eggs (typically four or five) are laid {{approximately}} 24–72 hours apart. The average egg size is , 10% larger than average for birds {{of its body}} size. The eggs are white to cream in color with brown or grey splotching. Incubation usually lasts 30 days and is mainly {{the responsibility of the}} female, although the male incubates 15–20% of the time. Eggs that are lost are typically replaced in 11–12 days. Hatching takes place over three to four days. Hatchlings are altricial, and are only <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> up after five days. They grow very quickly, reaching an adult weight after 16–17 days. After 28–31 days, their wings develop and they are able to leave the nest.|$|E

50|$|An {{estimated}} 10,500 CSU workers went {{on strike}} in March 1945 and began picketing all the studios resulting in delays of several films, including Selznick's epic Duel in the Sun and the Cole Porter story Night and Day. Unfortunately for CSU, the studios had some 130 films on the shelves {{at the time and}} were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> comfortably <b>sit</b> out a strike for the time being. Regardless, Disney, Monogram and several independents bargained with CSU while Columbia, Fox, MGM, Paramount, RKO, Universal, and Warner did not.|$|R
60|$|Both Francois de Laville and Philip Fletcher {{had been}} {{severely}} {{wounded in the}} battle of Jarnac, and some twenty of their troop had fallen in the fight. They were <b>able,</b> however, <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> their horses until they reached Cognac. The Admiral visited them, as soon as he arrived there. He had noticed the little band, as it emerged unbroken from the charge and, at once, ranged itself up to aid him in retreating from the village of Bassac, until Conde's charge enabled him to draw off. He praised the cousins highly for their conduct and, {{as soon as they were}} <b>able</b> <b>to</b> be about again, he bestowed on both the honour of knighthood; and then sent them to La Rochelle, to remain there until perfectly cured.|$|R
25|$|While {{many other}} members of Australian parliaments (MPs) have {{simultaneously}} served in wars, Newton's tenure was unusual because he was: both preselected and elected while he was overseas; {{one of only a}} few serving members of Australian parliaments to fly on combat operations; neither sworn in, nor <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> in parliament, and; killed in action while he was a MP.|$|E

25|$|The Valée system {{consisted}} {{in various}} technical {{improvements to the}} Gribeauval system and Napoleon I's Year XI system. The system mainly improved the mobility of the artillery train, and simplified maintenance by standardizing limber usage and wheel size, and {{reducing the number of}} carriage types to two. It also allowed for cannoniers to be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> on the ammunition chests of the battery itself during transportation, allowing the whole artillery train to move as fast as the infantry or cavalry.|$|E

25|$|The djed pillar {{was often}} used as amulets for {{the living and the}} dead. It was placed as an amulet near the spines of mummified bodies, which was {{supposed}} to ensure the resurrection of the dead, allowing the deceased to live eternally. The Egyptian Book of the Dead lists a spell which when spoken over a gold amulet hung around the mummy's neck, ensures that the mummy would regain use of its spine and be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> up. It was also painted onto coffins.|$|E
25|$|The F121 engine had a rare set {{of design}} {{parameters}} {{as it is}} designed to be used only once. As a cruise missile engine, it was designed to have a long shelf life (be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> around unused for long periods of time) and then operate when needed for several hours. It was designed to power the AGM-136 Tacit Rainbow, which was to be a stand-off anti radiation missile. Its first flight was on July 30, 1984. The AGM-136 program was canceled several years later.|$|E
25|$|Jon Brion {{provided}} the score and seven original songs for the film. His unique methods for writing previous film scores (Punch-Drunk Love, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind) involved very close {{collaboration with the}} director. Through this process, David O. Russell was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> {{in the same room}} with Brion and watch an early cut of the film. Russell described what he wanted to portray and Brion would compose music to Russell's descriptions. The process can be seen on a featurette on the film's special edition DVD.|$|E

He worked variously as the St. Louis District Organizer of the UCP in the summer of 1920 and as editor of the organization's labor newspaper, The Toiler, in October of that same year. This brought Cannon to New York City, where he was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> regularly <b>sit</b> on the meetings of the Central Executive Committee. After merger of the UCP with the remaining CPA organization, headed by Charles Dirba, Cannon was named the first Subdistrict Organizer of the unified organization for Duluth, Minnesota.|$|R
50|$|Young {{children}} have shorter attention spans so booktalks {{must be kept}} brief. Older children and teens are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> focus and <b>sit</b> at attention {{for longer periods of}} time and so booktalk presentations can be built in to fit within one class period (30-45 minutes). Within this timeframe 15-20 booktalks that are 2-3 minutes in length can be presented. The presenter will want to appeal to as many students as possible so the individual booktalks should consist of many genres.|$|R
25|$|The port {{was under}} the control of the Haitian {{government}} of Toussaint Louverture, which threw the crew of the privateer into prison. The men from Bordelais spent four months in prison but were well treated, with Gordon and the midshipman being permitted to move freely on parole. Eventually all were released to a cartel under the command of Captain Kelpoisson, the commander of the port of Aux Cayes, and the only Frenchman in a position of authority. The British arrived at Port Royal (except for one man who had died), where they found out that the war was over. They returned to Bordelais, where Gordon was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> down in the officers' mess before any of his fellow officers even knew that he had returned.|$|E
25|$|The new {{parliament}} met on 6 March 1679, and on 25 March, Shaftesbury delivered a dramatic {{address in the}} House of Lords in which he warned {{of the threat of}} popery and arbitrary government; denounced the royal administration in Scotland under John Maitland, 1st Duke of Lauderdale and Ireland under James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde; and loudly denounced the policies of Thomas Osborne, Earl of Danby in England. Shaftesbury supported the House of Commons when they introduced a Bill of Attainder against Danby, and voted in favour of the bill in the House of Lords on 14 April 1679. Shaftesbury attempted to neutralise the influence of the episcopal bench in favour of Danby by introducing a bill moving that the bishops should not be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> in the House of Lords during capital trials.|$|E
25|$|There are {{different}} views on optimal timing of surgery after a spinal cord injury. The general consensus is {{to operate the}} patient {{when he or she}} is neurologically stable. Some surgeons try to operate a patient as early as possible. The advantages of this are that the patient {{can take advantage of the}} new functional possibilities before new adjustments and apaptations develop. Other surgeons operate when it becomes feasible. This is usually 12–18 months after injury (can be shortened to 6–7 months) and only after stabilization of motor function. Important spasticity (see further) and neurovegetative complications (i.e. bladder function, bowel function, pulmonary function and pressure sores) must have been treated already. The patient must be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> in a wheelchair so that he/she can move the arm against gravity. Usually a compromise is found between the patient’s wishes and the surgeon when timing the surgery.|$|E

25|$|In {{his final}} term at Oxford Fry {{suffered}} his first (but not last) bout of mental illness, suffering a mental breakdown. There {{were a number}} of contributing factors to this. During his time at Oxford Fry had accumulated disturbingly large debts. In an attempt to alleviate his financial difficulties, Fry capitalised on his reputation to make some much-needed money. As well as writing articles (including one for Wisden), he did some private tutoring but although such activities reduced his debts they did not clear them and, further increased the intense pressure on his time. Fry's continuing indebtedness provides the most obvious explanation for his acceptance of an offer to do some nude modelling. These financial problems combined with his mother being seriously ill, placed an unbearable strain on him. Although he was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> his final exams, he was hardly in any fit state to do so, having hardly read a line for weeks. The result was Fry scraping a Fourth, bringing one of Oxford's most spectacular and successful careers to an inglorious end. So in the summer of 1895, only months after being the toast of Oxford, Fry found himself saddled with mounting debts and no way with which to repay them. In the short term, cricket came to his rescue. He was offered, and accepted, the chance to tour South Africa as a member of Lord Hawke's 1895–96 England touring party.|$|E
25|$|Two {{weeks after}} the {{regiment}} landed at Montauk, he came to Long Island City on a furlough, suffering from pernicious malaria. His salary had been discontinued after leaving the regiment, and his wife was forced {{to give up their}} home. They had been staying at the home of a family friend, Mrs. E. Bracken, at 86 Seventh Street before he was taken to St. John's Hospital in Brooklyn. He was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> up unassisted during his first two days, and hoped to return to work, but his condition grew steadily worse over the next two weeks. Doctor Frank E. Brennan treated Ziegner during his time in Long Island City free of charge and providing for the medicine. He also assisted his wife in getting Ziegner admitted to a private hospital but found difficulty in arraigning a carriage. The hospital then had no ambulance, and the Red Cross were unavailable to assist. Local liverymen sometimes hired out their carriages, but none were willing to carry a malaria patient. By the time one was brought around to the house, Ziegner was too weak to ride. After nearly a week and a half, he was finally brought to St. John's Hospital in Brooklyn on the night of September 8, 1898. His wife accompanied her husband to the hospital and was allowed to remain at his bedside until he died the next evening. His funeral was held at Mrs. Bracken's home on Sunday afternoon, and he was then buried in Calvary Cemetery. Though they had no children, his wife was expecting their first child {{at the time of his}} death.|$|E

40|$|When {{technologies}} are introduced into collaborative settings, {{people are often}} required {{to work together in}} new, unfamiliar ways. This can lead to problems of resistance, and even non-adoption. Conscious of this issue, we have developed a system which is designed to support collaboration, not through any major change to the work process, but rather by improving people’s experience of working together. Here we report on a system designed to support the collaborative use of information accessed by salesperson and customer during the early stages of a sales transaction. The system, embedded in a shared worktable, promotes a number of new user experiences, changing the way people are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> meet, <b>sit</b> together, communicate, and represent what they are discussing. We found that the new user experiences enhance collaboration, supporting the work process while avoiding problems of resistance...|$|R
