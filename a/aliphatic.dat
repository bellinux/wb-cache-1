5|$|Catalytic {{reagents}} {{have been}} less successful, with most variations suffering from poor yield, poor enantioselectivity, or both. There are also issues with substrate scope, most having limitations with methylene transfer and <b>aliphatic</b> aldehydes. The trouble stems from {{the need for a}} nucleophilic sulfide that efficiently generates the ylide which can also act as a good leaving group to form the epoxide. Since the factors underlying these desiderata are at odds, tuning of the catalyst properties has proven difficult. Shown below are several of the most successful catalysts along with the yields and enantiomeric excess for their use in synthesis of (E)-stilbene oxide.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the other}} carbon–halogen bonds, the C–Cl bond {{is a common}} {{functional}} group that forms part of core organic chemistry. Formally, compounds with this functional group may be considered organic derivatives of the chloride anion. Due to the difference of electronegativity between chlorine (3.16) and carbon (2.55), the carbon in a C–Cl bond is electron-deficient and thus electrophilic. Chlorination modifies the physical properties of hydrocarbons in several ways: chlorocarbons are typically denser than water due to the higher atomic weight of chlorine versus hydrogen, and <b>aliphatic</b> organochlorides are alkylating agents because chloride is a leaving group.|$|E
50|$|The {{formation}} of soot depends strongly on the fuel composition. The rank ordering of sooting tendency of fuel components is: naphthalenes → benzenes → <b>aliphatics.</b> However, {{the order of}} sooting tendencies of the <b>aliphatics</b> (alkanes, alkenes, and alkynes) varies dramatically depending on the flame type. The difference between the sooting tendencies of <b>aliphatics</b> and aromatics is thought to result mainly from the different routes of formation. <b>Aliphatics</b> appear to first form acetylene and polyacetylenes, which is a slow process; aromatics can form soot both by this route and also by a more direct pathway involving ring condensation or polymerization reactions building on the existing aromatic structure.|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of shale ash on the pyrolysis of Huadian oil shale was investigated. It {{was found that}} under the catalysis of shale ash, <b>aliphatics</b> in shale oil were partially converted to aromatics, and the long-chain <b>aliphatics</b> were converted to shorter ones. This effect could be improved by increased content of shale ash or by augmented temperature. Beyond the Diels-Alder reaction {{for the formation of}} aromatics, a novel reaction route of cyclization of <b>aliphatics</b> followed by dehydrogenation to aromatics was proposed. The component of CaO in shale ash plays an important role to the general performance of shale ash. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

5|$|The cysts of Azotobacter are spherical and {{consist of}} the {{so-called}} 'central body' – a reduced copy of vegetative cells with several vacuoles – and the 'two-layer shell'. The inner part of the shell is called intine and has a fibrous structure. The outer part has a hexagonal crystalline structure and is called exine. Exine is partially hydrolyzed by trypsin and is resistant to lysozyme, {{in contrast to the}} central body. The central body can be isolated in a viable state by some chelation agents. The main constituents of the outer shell are alkylresorcinols composed of long <b>aliphatic</b> chains and aromatic rings. Alkylresorcinols are also found in other bacteria, animals, and plants.|$|E
5|$|The {{standard}} {{conditions for the}} Weinreb–Nahm ketone synthesis are known to tolerate {{a wide variety of}} functional groups elsewhere in the molecule, including alpha-halogen substitution, N-protected amino acids, α-β unsaturation, silyl ethers, various lactams and lactones, sulfonates, sulfinates, and phosphonate esters. A wide variety of nucleophiles can be used in conjunction with the amide. Lithiates and Grignard reagents are most commonly employed; examples involving <b>aliphatic,</b> vinyl, aryl, and alkynyl carbon nucleophiles have been reported. However, with highly basic or sterically hindered nucleophiles, elimination of the methoxide moiety to release formaldehyde can occur as a significant side reaction.|$|E
5|$|Amino acids are organic {{compounds}} containing amine (-NH2) and carboxyl (-COOH) functional groups, {{along with a}} side chain (R group) specific to each amino acid. The key elements of an amino acid are carbon (C), hydrogen (H), oxygen (O), and nitrogen (N), although other elements {{are found in the}} side chains of certain amino acids. About 500 amino acids are known (though only 20 appear in the genetic code) and can be classified in many ways. They can be classified according to the core structural functional groups' locations as alpha- (α-), beta- (β-), gamma- (γ-) or delta- (δ-) amino acids; other categories relate to polarity, pH level, and side chain group type (<b>aliphatic,</b> acyclic, aromatic, containing hydroxyl or sulfur, etc.). In the form of proteins, amino acid residues form the second-largest component (water is the largest) of human muscles and other tissues. Beyond their role as residues in proteins, amino acids participate in a number of processes such as neurotransmitter transport and biosynthesis.|$|E

40|$|Cork {{samples from}} Betula pendula, Quercus suber and Quercus cerris were {{submitted}} to Py-GC-MS/FID at temperatures between 550 degrees C and 900 degrees C and the pyrolysis-derived compounds (py-products) {{were identified and}} quantified. Corks were compared with wood samples. Py-products include suberin, lignin and carbohydrates derivatives. Suberin py-products are dominated by unsaturated <b>aliphatics.</b> Corks pyrolysis yield and composition were dramatically influenced by temperature in contrast to wood that showed stable results across temperatures. At 850 - 900 degrees C the peaks area of cork pyrograms were approximately two times higher than at 550 degrees C, for which yield was {{about half of the}} woods, and cork py-products were dominated by suberin-derived short chain <b>aliphatics,</b> namely 1 -alkenes, while at 550 degrees C composition was dominated by lignin derivatives. Lignin and carbohydrate derived products decreased dramatically over 750 degrees C while the opposite was observed for unsaturated <b>aliphatics.</b> Cork materials show a high potential as feedstock for production of aliphatic-rich pyrolytic biofuels or as a source of olefins.

5|$|X-ray {{crystallography}} {{has led to}} {{a better}} understanding of chemical bonds and non-covalent interactions. The initial studies revealed the typical radii of atoms, and confirmed many theoretical models of chemical bonding, such as the tetrahedral bonding of carbon in the diamond structure, the octahedral bonding of metals observed in ammonium hexachloroplatinate (IV), and the resonance observed in the planar carbonate group and in aromatic molecules. Kathleen Lonsdale's 1928 structure of hexamethylbenzene established the hexagonal symmetry of benzene and showed a clear difference in bond length between the <b>aliphatic</b> C–C bonds and aromatic C–C bonds; this finding led to the idea of resonance between chemical bonds, which had profound consequences for the development of chemistry. Her conclusions were anticipated by William Henry Bragg, who published models of naphthalene and anthracene in 1921 based on other molecules, an early form of molecular replacement.|$|E
5|$|All {{members of}} Cicuta except C.bulbifera contain {{high levels of}} the {{poisonous}} principle cicutoxin, an unsaturated <b>aliphatic</b> alcohol that is structurally {{closely related to the}} toxin oenanthotoxin found in the plant hemlock water dropwort. Cicutoxin is present at all stages of growth and {{in all parts of the}} plant, but is most concentrated in the roots which appear to be the most toxic in the early spring. Its primary toxic effect is to act as a stimulant in the central nervous system. It is a non-competitive gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor antagonist. Cicutoxin acts on the GABAA receptor causing a block of the chloride channel which results in neuronal depolarization. In the presence of cicutoxin this depolarization continues unabated causing cell overactivity. The hyperactivity in brain cells results in seizures. Cicutoxin is highly poisonous and water hemlock is considered one of North America's most toxic plants. Ingestion of Cicuta can be fatal in humans and there are reports in the medical literature of severe poisoning and death as early as 1670. A number of people have also died following ingestion of the plant in the 20th and 21st century.|$|E

40|$|Pig (Sus scrofa) feces, {{separately}} {{collected and}} amended with wheat straw, was composted in a tunnel reactor {{connected with a}} cooler. The composting process was monitored for 4 wk and the degradation of organic matter was studied by two chemical extraction methods, 13 C cross polarization magic angle spinning (CPMAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Wet-chemical extraction methods were not adequate to study the degradation of specific organic compounds as the extraction reagents did not give selective separation of hemicellulose, cellulose, proteins, and lignins. A new method was proposed to calculate the contribution of four biomacromolecules (<b>aliphatics,</b> proteins, polysaccharides, and lignin) from the 13 C CPMAS NMR spectrum. Pyrolysis GC-MS allowed identification of {{the composition of the}} biomacromolecules. The biomacromolecules showed different rates of degradation during composting. High initial degradation rates of <b>aliphatics,</b> hemicellulose, and proteins were observed, where <b>aliphatics</b> were completely degraded and hemicellulose and proteins were partly recalcitrant during the four weeks of composting. The degradation rate of cellulose was much lower and degradation was not completed within the four weeks of composting. Lignin was not degraded during the thermophilic stage of composting but started to degrade slowly during the mesophilic stage. A combination of 13 C CPMAS NMR and pyrolysis GC-MS gave good qualitative and semi-quantitative assessments of the degradation of biomacromolecules during composting...|$|R

40|$|Low-grade natural iron ore, limonite, is {{proposed}} as an inexpensive catalyst {{to increase the}} light liquid production from coal pyrolysis.
