2500|$|The {{organisation}} {{is said to}} {{be sensitive}} to criticism, either external or internal, which it tends to regard as an attack on the organization. Jackins believed that much criticism was inspired by the hostility of the US government to RC's [...] "profoundly progressive nature and its effectiveness". RC instructs members [...] "to quickly interrupt both attacks and gossip", which are [...] "dramatizations of distress" [...] and unacceptable behaviors within the RC Community. It says that [...] "An attack is not an effective way to resolve disagreements or difficulties." [...] The organisation requires that [...] "People who participate in an attack must first stop the attack and <b>apologize</b> <b>for</b> <b>having</b> participated in it", after which they are to be offered counseling. Critics who persist [...] "should be made to leave the group and their attacks ignored." [...] RC has been criticized for this prevention of internal discussion.|$|E
2500|$|From March 2016, the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly [...] {{received}} {{a total of}} 610 telephone calls of complaint regarding Masuzoe's alleged extravagant spending. Then in May of that year, the Shukan Bunshun weekly news magazine reported on issues regarding public figures' official automobile travel expenses {{and the use of}} political funds for family trips. Masuzoe was the focus of the reports on the use of political funds for family trips, and came under prolonged media criticism. Masuzoe held a press conference that month to <b>apologize</b> <b>for</b> <b>having</b> declared over ¥370,000 spent on dining with his family at restaurants in 2013 and 2014 as [...] "meeting-related" [...] expenses covered by political funds. Among these were hotel expenses, family vacation trips, artwork, comic books as well as the use of government vehicle to travel to his holiday home located in Yugawara, Kanagawa Prefecture. In the following weeks investigations into his activities uncovered further inappropriate spending of public funds. An investigation instigated by Masuzoe and conducted by lawyers determined that he had used ¥4.4 million [...] "inappropriately", but had not committed any crime. Masuzoe subsequently declared that he would refund the misappropriated expenses, but refused to resign over the issue.|$|E
