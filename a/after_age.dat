They all present marked reduction of Rp values, that indicates reduction of the protection provided by the coating. Among all, Saratoga shows the lowest loss of protection, notwithstanding the surface pattern of cracked bubbles observed by SEM. As a matter of fact, although its surface continuity appears compromised, Rp values of aged Saratoga paint is still about two orders of magnitude higher than the untreated samples. Dupli-color paint provides lower protection against corrosion <b>after</b> <b>aging</b> compared to Saratoga, showing Rp values that are only one order of magnitude higher than the untreated surface. The worst performance is given by Talken, which presents Rp values <b>after</b> <b>aging</b> {{very close to the}} untreated samples, indicating that this type of coating does not provide a durable protection against corrosion <b>after</b> <b>aging.</b>|$|R
5|$|MS is {{more common}} in regions with {{northern}} European populations and the geographic variation may simply reflect the global distribution of these high-risk populations. Decreased sunlight exposure resulting in decreased vitamin D production has also been put forward as an explanation. A relationship between season of birth and MS lends support to this idea, with fewer people born in the northern hemisphere in November as compared to May being affected later in life. Environmental factors may play a role during childhood, with several studies finding that people who move to a different region of the world before the age of 15 acquire the new region's risk to MS. If migration takes place <b>after</b> <b>age</b> 15, however, the person retains the risk of his home country. There is some evidence that the effect of moving may still apply to people older than 15.|$|E

For each electrocatalyst, the morphology and composition were characterised using TEM, XRD and chemical analysis. ORR kinetic parameters were evaluated using the Rotating Disk Electrode (RDE) and Rotating Ring Disk Electrode (RRDE) setups. Whilst the oxygen reduction activity of the electrocatalysts barely changes <b>after</b> mild <b>ageing,</b> it decreases <b>after</b> premature <b>ageing</b> following dramatic modifications to both the chemical and crystalline structures of the carbon-supported MnOx nanoparticles.

30|$|For all rag samples, {{the number}} of {{carbonyl}} group contents is considerably lower <b>after</b> <b>aging</b> (20  days).

As the cellulose degradation is not very pronounced, this effect is rather minor. We suspect that, <b>after</b> <b>aging,</b> a portion of low molar mass compounds is washed out during sample pretreatment prior to analysis, carrying a significant number of carbonyls and hence leading to the observed drop. For book paper (IV), the values of carbonyl groups stay in a similar range (50 – 60  µmol/g) before and <b>after</b> <b>aging</b> for 20  days.

The model includes the utilization of the Morse potential function to simulate the interatomic force between the atoms in workpieces.

In addition, distribution of atomic potential and atomic stress in the workpiece become regular in the aging process, and the atoms of the defect structures have much higher potential energy and stress.

An {{extruded}} ZK 60 {{magnesium alloy}} {{was subjected to}} artificial aging at 180 oC for {{an investigation of the}} effect of aging time on its precipitation behavior and mechanical properties.

30|$|With {{respect to}} {{dissociation}} of the hydride, the hydride was still {{observed in the}} cathodically hydrogen-charged specimen <b>after</b> <b>aging</b> {{at room temperature for}} 50 h, whereas hydride dissociation was confirmed in the specimen immersed in 0.2 % APF solution <b>after</b> <b>aging</b> for the same time. <b>After</b> the <b>aging</b> at room temperature for 50 h, hydrogen generated by hydride dissociation can diffuse {{to the center of the}} specimen immersed in 0.2 % APF solution, whereas the remaining hydride cannot diffuse to the center of the cathodically hydrogen-charged specimen. Therefore, the difference in the amount of hydride in each specimen appears to be responsible for the difference in the hydrogen concentration in the vicinity of the surface of each specimen. In addition, the hydrogen diffusion obeys Fick’s second law (Carslaw and Jaeger 1984) when the hydrogen concentration changes with the aging time. According to Fick’s second law, the diffusion rate of hydrogen gradually decreases with the hydrogen concentration in the vicinity of the specimen surface. The hydrogen concentration in the vicinity of the surface of the cathodically hydrogen-charged specimen was less than that of the specimen immersed in 0.2 % APF solution <b>after</b> <b>aging</b> at room temperature for 24 h. Therefore, it is likely that the diffusion rate of hydrogen in the cathodically hydrogen-charged specimen was less than that in the specimen immersed in 0.2 % APF solution <b>after</b> <b>aging</b> at room temperature for 24 h.|$|R
