Hysteresis in these systems can be very effectively reduced using the “phaser”, an ideal frequency domain operator, in <b>a</b> feedback <b>connection.</b> The <b>position</b> stability {{of this type of}} control has not yet been established in spite of the experimental evidence that the resulting systems are stable. This paper shows the dissipativity for the relay operator, for the Preisach model, and then for the lead approximation to the phaser. We then give a proof of stability for the feedback connection of this phaser approximation with systems represented by the Preisach model of hysteresis. ...|$|R
40|$|Tourism plays a {{major role}} in the world economy and is {{expected}} to become even more important in the years to come. According to the European Union Conference, Agenda 2010, 1998, in European tourism small and medium-sized enterprises account for 90 percent of all businesses and more than 94 percent of them are micro operators employing less than ten individuals. The purpose of this bachelor’s thesis is to study how small travel operators are pricing their products, and if there is there any connection between pricing and positioning and if that is the case how the two marketing activities effect each other. In order to achieve this purpose, case studies of two small travel operators were carried out. The required data was gathered through interviews over the telephone. The outcome of this thesis shows that pricing is mostly done based on the non-formal practises, and that there are <b>a</b> <b>connection</b> between <b>positioning</b> and pricing in many aspects. The study also found that smaller travel operators are aware of these connections, but they do not use the knowledge in any scientific way. Instead they use their accumulated experience and are pricing their products according to the upper limit set by the price insensitivity, which varies for each segment.

40|$|Nowhere is {{the dynamic}} {{character}} of the English lexicon more apparent than {{in the case of}} computer vocabulary. Elisabeth Bründl's study investigates this field with two aims in mind (as pointed out in chapter one) : firstly, the author wants to find out which principles underlie the creation of words in this field; secondly, her study aims at the integration of cognitive insights into the tradi-tional field of lexicology. Research in the field of cognitive linguistics as well as its (lack of) applica-tion in lexicology and lexicography is reviewed in chapter two. Key concepts are the mental lexicon, metaphor and metonymy as central processes in the creation of new lexical units (as defined by Cruse 1986 : 77), and iconicity as the cognitive answer to the structural tenet of the arbitrariness of the linguistic sign. Bründl argues that the cognitive approach so far has been mainly applied to the syntactic-semantic level but rarely to the level of word-formation (p. 8). Yet, the study of word-formation can profit from the integration of cognitive insights. For example, there is arguably <b>a</b> <b>connection</b> between the <b>position</b> of...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is to explain to what extent a brand owner could make use of brand {{positioning}} theory to increase long-term effects in building brand strength and loyalty. Applying the critical realism philosophy of science, {{with the use of}} multiple sources of data such as a case study, an in-depth interview and video data, Coca-Cola’s brand positioning effectiveness in engaging consumers and changing their attitude (towards Coke brand) was interpreted and evaluated. The research findings showed that, a brand owner to a large extent could make use of brand positioning theory to increase long-term effects in building brand strength and loyalty. The findings can be used to suggest brand managers in learning from Coca-Cola’s successful brand positioning in the Share a Coke campaign in four aspects: Innovation in communications, Mass-market penetration in terms of social media, Customization and emotional selling, and user-generated content and story telling. This project aims to find a relation between brand positioning and brand loyalty and closes the literature gap by developing <b>a</b> <b>connection</b> to how <b>positioning</b> can increase engagement, change consumers’ attitude and overtime can generate long-term loyalty...|$|R
40|$|Although {{there has}} been {{considerable}} theoretical interest in the relationship be-tween pover and position in a social structure, few researchers have explored this issue empirically. This paper develops a quantitative measure of an individual's structural capacity for "brokerage " in a social network to test hypotheses {{about the effect of}} structural position on pover in community elites. Data on two commu-nity elites are used to show that (1) position in a social network has an effect on perceived influence independent of other influence resources, and (2) pover de-rived from structure and pover derived from resources undermine rather than en-hance each other. Moreover, this relationship between pover and structural posi-tion is dependent on the degree of factionalization and opposition in the elite. Following a series of empirical studies (e. g., Galaskiewicz 1979; Laumann & Pappi 1976) which revealed <b>a</b> <b>connection</b> between <b>position</b> in <b>a</b> social structure and various forms of power or perceived influence, a number of theorists have attempted to explicate the exact nature of this connection. In particular, sociologists have devoted considerable attention to the pro-cess by which structural position in exchange networks can become a source of power. Cook et al. (1983) conducted experiments which demon-strated that strategically located individuals in negatively connected net-works are able to exploit those who are dependent on them for the ex-change of resources. In a similar vein, Marsden (1982, 1983) has devel-oped sophisticated mathematical models which predict the emergence of price-making and brokerage behavior in networks with restricted access. *This material is based on work supported under a National Science Foundation Graduate Fellowship.

40|$|In {{his paper}} 'Nagarjuna as anti-realist', Siderits {{showed that it}} makes sense to perform <b>a</b> <b>connection</b> between the <b>position</b> of the Buddhist Nagarjuna and {{contemporary}} anti realist theses such as Dummett’s one. The aim {{of this paper is to}} argue that this <b>connection</b> is <b>an</b> important one to perform for one’s correct understanding of what Nagarjuna is doing when he criticizes the contemporary Indian theories of knowledge and assertion, first section. But as soon as the theories of argumentation are involved, this connection can be implemented in a better way from an other anti realist perspective, namely the one of Dialogical logic (Erlangen school), in which the signification is given in terms of rules in a language game. The philosophical issues are to hold an interpretation of the type of assertion performed by Nagarjuna. The paper aims at making a rational reconstruction of Nagarjuna's chief claim ‘I do not assert any proposition’ in which a proposition is considered as the set of its strategies of justification. As for the last section, the point will be to apply these analyses to Buddhist practice. The conventional character of human activities will be considered as the fact that any speech act is performed within a dialogue under ad-hoc restrictions; and the question of one’s progress in the soteriological path to liberation will be asked 1...|$|R

According to the bridge connection system, sets of dispatching components (1) and distance-adjusting components (2) with different sizes can be used, and any one set of the dispatching component (1) and distance-adjusting component (2) can be matched with one fixing component (3). Moreover, the distance between the cups and the shapes of the cups can be adjusted according to self conditions and preference without influencing the comfort, the cups with different types, sizes or designs can also be matched for use, and the bridge connection parts with different sizes are repeatedly used, so that the bra utilization rate is improved. 一种可调换的罩杯桥接系统，包括两个罩杯、分别位于罩杯底部的钢圈以及位于两个罩杯之间的桥接部分，所述桥接部分包括用于调节钢圈弯曲程度的调度部件（ 1 ）、用于调节罩杯间距的调距部件（ 2 ）以及用于将调度部件（ 1 ）和调距部件（ 2 ）稳固在罩杯外边缘的固定部件（ 3 ），本发明的桥接系统可以使用多套尺寸不同的调度部件（ 1 ）和调距部件（ 2 ），其中任何一套的调度部件（ 1 ）和调距部件（ 2 ），与一个所述固定部件（ 3 ）搭配。实施本发明的桥接系统，在不影响舒适性前提下，可根据自身条件和喜好调整罩杯间距和罩杯的形状，也可将不同型号、尺寸或设计的罩杯搭配使用，通过重复使用不同尺寸的桥接部分提高胸罩的使用率。Institute of Textiles and ClothingInventor name used in this publication: 陆仕祺Inventor name used in this publication: 余咏文Inventor name used in this publication: 刘丽丽Inventor name used in this publication: 徐民英Title in Traditional Chinese: 一種可調換的罩杯橋接系統Chin...|$|R
