5|$|Cockroaches {{are social}} insects; {{a large number}} of species are either gregarious or {{inclined}} to aggregate, and a slightly smaller number exhibit parental care. It used to be thought that cockroaches aggregated because they were reacting to environmental cues, but it is now believed that pheromones are involved in these behaviors. Some species secrete these in their feces with gut microbial symbionts being involved, while others use glands located on their mandibles. Pheromones produced by the cuticle may enable cockroaches to distinguish between different populations of cockroach by odor. The behaviors involved have only been studied in a few species, but German cockroaches leave fecal trails with an odor gradient. Other cockroaches follow such trails to discover sources of food and water, and where other cockroaches <b>are</b> <b>hiding.</b> Thus, cockroaches have emergent behavior, in which group or swarm behavior emerges from a simple set of individual interactions.|$|E
