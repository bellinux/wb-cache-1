5|$|As {{well as his}} {{two sons}} Ælfhelm left a daughter, Ælfgifu of Northampton, by a woman named Wulfrun; Ælfgifu's {{territorial}} appellation is taken <b>as</b> <b>further</b> evidence that Ælfhelm had territory in the eastern Danelaw. She is perhaps more famous than her father, because at some time between 1013 and 1016 she married Cnut, son of Sweyn Forkbeard, future King of the English.

5|$|At that time, many in Britain {{worried that}} coal {{reserves}} were rapidly dwindling, {{but some experts}} opined that improving technology would reduce coal consumption.

Hence, improving technology would tend to increase {{the rate at which}} England's coal deposits were being depleted, and could not be relied upon to solve the problem.|$|E

He cited the ease in development of features like fluid simulation, copyright issues with the art and more unhindered possibilities <b>as</b> <b>further</b> reasons for not using it. Being used to the text-based graphics in roguelikes, he did not want graphical tilesets. The story-generation originated first from Armok, although present to some extent in dragslay. Tarn and Zach would write different chapters of events they would like to see, mix it together and try to implement it. Most of this story writing is managed by Zach, who has a role in the game's development. He graduated in ancient history and books like The Twelve Caesars and the writings of Assyrian kings influenced the game.|$|E
5|$|After {{the war of}} independence, Lima {{became the}} capital of the Republic of Peru but {{economic}} stagnation and political turmoil brought its urban development to a halt. This hiatus ended in the 1850s, when increased public and private revenues from guano exports led to a rapid expansion of the city. In the next two decades, the State funded the construction of large size public buildings to replace colonial establishments; these included the Central Market, the General Slaughterhouse, the Mental Asylum, the Penitentiary, and the Dos de Mayo Hospital. There were also improvements in communications; a railroad line between Lima and Callao was completed in 1850 and an iron bridge across the Rímac River, the Balta Bridge, was opened in 1870. The city walls were torn down in 1872 <b>as</b> <b>further</b> urban growth was expected. However, the export-led economic expansion also widened the gap between rich and poor, fostering social unrest.|$|E
5|$|Another {{focus of}} the Canadian {{government}} {{was to make the}} Aboriginal groups of Canada sedentary, as they thought that this would make them easier to assimilate. In the 19th century, the government began to support the creation of model farming villages, which were meant to encourage non-sedentary Aboriginal groups to settle in an area and begin to cultivate agriculture. When most of these model farming villages failed, the government turned instead to the creation of Indian reserves with the Indian Act of 1876. With the creation of these reserves came many restricting laws, such <b>as</b> <b>further</b> bans on all intoxicants, restrictions on eligibility to vote in band elections, decreased hunting and fishing areas, and inability for status Indians to visit other groups on their reservations.|$|E

5|$|At this point, time {{appeared}} to be on Trunajaya's side, <b>as</b> <b>further</b> delay {{would allow him to}} strengthen his fortifications and reinforcements, while disease would weaken the VOC's forces. Therefore, Speelman decided to attack. On 12–13 May, the VOC delivered a heavy artillery bombardment on Trunajaya's main works, followed by an assault. The attack succeeded after hard fighting, and Trunajaya retreated inland to establish his new capital at Kediri, capital city of the ancient Kediri Kingdom. In the retreat, he left behind sixty-nine iron cannons and thirty-four bronze cannons (twenty of them small ships' cannons, bassen) and only saved twenty bronze pieces.|$|E

While she almost exclusively releases English songs, Beyoncé recorded several Spanish songs for Irreemplazable (re-recordings of songs from B'Day for a Spanish-language audience), and the re-release of B'Day. To record these, Beyoncé was coached phonetically by American record producer Rudy Perez.|$|E

5|$|Boletus luridus is {{the type}} species of Boletus section Luridi, {{originally}} circumscribed by Fries in 1838. This section includes species producing medium to large fruit bodies with thick, swollen stems, and minute pores that are coloured red, orange, or brown. However, the genus {{as a whole is}} strongly paraphyletic and has been partly fragmented <b>as</b> <b>further</b> studies have resolved relationships to a finer detail. Manfred Binder and David Hibbett showed B.luridus to be most closely related to a group containing B.torosus and B.luteocupreus, with B.vermiculosus and Pulveroboletus ravenelii as more distant relatives, based on molecular phylogenetics inferred from ribosomal DNA sequences. In a separate molecular study of ten frequently eaten European boletes, B.luridus clustered together with B.rhodoxanthus. Genetic analysis published in 2013 shows that B. luridus and many (but not all) red-pored boletes are part of a dupainii clade (named for Boletus dupainii), well-removed from the core group of Boletus edulis and relatives within the Boletineae. For this reason, it is now considered a species of Suillellus.|$|E
5|$|Ceres (2.77AU) is {{the largest}} asteroid, a protoplanet, and a dwarf planet. It has a {{diameter}} of slightly under 1,000km, and a mass large enough for its own gravity to pull it into a spherical shape. Ceres was considered a planet when it was discovered in 1801, and was reclassified to asteroid in the 1850s <b>as</b> <b>further</b> observations revealed additional asteroids. It was classified as a dwarf planet in 2006 when {{the definition of a}} planet was created.|$|E

Nevertheless, the 31st/51st Battalion continued to undertake patrols along the Ratsua front, during which they suffered further casualties, until they were withdrawn from combat operations on 28 June.
