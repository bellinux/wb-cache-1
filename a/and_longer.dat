5|$|The Eocene frigatebird genus Limnofregata {{comprises}} birds whose fossil {{remains were}} recovered from prehistoric freshwater environments, unlike the marine preferences of their modern-day relatives. They had shorter less-hooked bills <b>and</b> <b>longer</b> legs, <b>and</b> <b>longer</b> slit-like nasal openings. Three {{species have been}} described from fossil deposits in the western United States, two—L. azygosternon and L. hasegawai—from the Green River Formation (48–52 million years old) and one—L. hutchisoni—from the Wasatch Formation (between 53 and 55 million years of age). Fossil material indistinguishable from living species dating to the Pleistocene and Holocene has been recovered from Ascension Island (for F. aquila), Saint Helena Island, both in the southern Atlantic Ocean, and also from various islands in the Pacific Ocean (for F. minor and F. ariel).|$|E

5|$|The {{other major}} {{subfamily}} of tyrannosaurids is the Tyrannosaurinae, which includes Daspletosaurus, Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus.

5|$|Based on the star's chromospheric activity, HD 28185 is {{estimated}} to have an age of around 2,900 million years.

5|$|Because {{of similar}} and {{additive}} effects, divers should avoid sedating medications and drugs, such as marijuana and alcohol before any dive. A hangover, {{combined with the}} reduced physical capacity that goes with it, makes nitrogen narcosis more likely. Experts recommend total abstinence from alcohol for at least 12 hours before diving, <b>and</b> <b>longer</b> for other drugs. Abstinence time needed for marijuana is unknown, but owing to the much longer half-life of the active agent of this drug in the body, {{it is likely to}} be longer than for alcohol.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 19th century, as salvage {{operations}} became deeper <b>and</b> <b>longer,</b> an unexplained malady began afflicting the divers; they would suffer breathing difficulties, dizziness, joint pain and paralysis, sometimes leading to death. The problem was already well known among workers building tunnels and bridge footings operating under pressure in caissons and was initially called caisson disease; {{it was later}} renamed the bends because the joint pain typically caused the sufferer to stoop. Early reports of the disease had been made {{at the time of}} Charles Pasley's salvage operation, but scientists were still ignorant of its causes.|$|E
5|$|Compsognathus were small, bipedal {{animals with}} long hind legs <b>and</b> <b>longer</b> tails, which they used for balance during locomotion.

The skull had five pairs of fenestrae (skull openings), the largest of which was for the orbit (eye socket). The eyes were large {{in proportion to the}} rest of the skull.|$|E
