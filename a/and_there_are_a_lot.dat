25|$|Alderfer, {{expanding}} on Maslow's {{hierarchy of}} needs, created the ERG theory. This theory posits {{that there are}} three groups of core needs — existence, relatedness, and growth, hence the label: ERG theory. The existence group is concerned with providing our basic material existence requirements. They include the items that Maslow considered to be physiological and safety needs. The second group of needs are those of relatedness- the desire we have for maintaining important personal relationships. These social and status desires require interaction with others {{if they are to be}} satisfied, and they align with Maslow's social need and the external component of Maslow's esteem classification. Finally, Alderfer isolates growth needs as an intrinsic desire for personal development. Maslow's categories are broken down into many different parts <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of needs. The ERG categories are more broad and covers more than just certain areas. As a person grows, the existence, relatedness, and growth for all desires continue to grow. All these needs should be fulfilled to greater wholeness as a human being. These include the intrinsic component from Maslow's esteem category and the characteristics included under self-actualization.|$|E

This was the second accident involving the class; in October 2012 an Oracle Team USA AC72 also capsized in San Francisco Bay during training, causing substantial damage but no serious injuries. Christopher Clarey, writing in The New York Times, described the class as [...] "high-speed and high-risk." [...] Stephen Park, who heads the British Olympic sailing team, commented: [...] "they're very high powered and the loads on them are huge... these boats are untrodden waters for sailing. A lot of the loads {{and a lot of the}} equipment is new <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of unknowns and things being tested."

[...] Michael Debbage of MainlyPiano writes that Paint the Sky represents Joseph’s most complete recording since his landmark album Rapture.

500|$|Though Sakic {{was a quiet}} individual, he {{was able}} to motivate his team to play at higher levels, which earned him the respect of his peers and executives. The first signs of Sakic's {{leadership}} began to show while still a member of the Swift Current Broncos of the WHL. After the bus crash that killed four of his teammates, Sakic was seen {{as the leader of the}} team, acknowledging that the experience changed his outlook on life. Early in his career with the Nordiques (when Mike Hough was still captain), with the team hoping to rebuild around their top draft pick Eric Lindros, and holding onto Lindros' rights for the season when he refused to sign, Sakic suggested that the team could progress without Lindros, saying, [...] "We only want players here who have the passion to play the game. I'm tired of hearing that name. He's not here <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of others in this locker room who really care about the game." [...] Lindros was traded a year later, bringing in a number of quality players, which vastly improved the Nordiques. Sakic's leadership qualities led him to be courted by other teams, such as in the summer of 1997, when the New York Rangers offered him a large contract in order to replace departed captain Mark Messier, though the Avalanche ultimately matched the offer and retained Sakic.|$|E

500|$|In 1989–90, {{his second}} NHL season, Sakic {{was able to}} switch his number back to his {{familiar}} #19 (Alain Côté had retired over the summer), and scored 102 points, which was ninth overall in the league. At {{the start of the}} next season, 1990–91, he was named co-captain along with Steven Finn (Sakic was captain for home games, Finn for away games) and again passed the 100 point mark, improving to 109 points and sixth overall in the league, but would slip during 1991–92 to 94 points, having missed 11 games. Early on in the season, Sakic showed some of his leadership qualities, even while Mike Hough was serving as captain, as he stood firm in the Eric Lindros holdout issue. With Lindros holding out against the Nordiques, who were one of the worst teams in league, Sakic commented, [...] "We only want players here who have the passion to play the game. I'm tired of hearing that name. He's not here <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of others in this locker room who really care about the game." [...] Lindros was traded a year later, ending the situation and bringing in a number of quality players, which vastly improved the Nordiques. During their first four seasons with Joe Sakic, the Nordiques finished last place in the Adams Division and last in the entire league for three straight years, from 1989 to 1991.|$|E
500|$|Writer Kinberg {{would later}} state that [...] "there {{are a lot}} of things about 'X3' that I love <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of things that I regret", {{detailing}} that he would have preferred the Dark Phoenix as the main plotline and [...] "I would have fought harder" [...] for that, considering that at the period [...] "the darkness of her story was a little bit daunting on a huge $200 million studio movie" [...] leading Fox to ask for rewrites. Previous X-Men director Bryan Singer declared that The Last Stand [...] "isn't what I would have done" [...] and he was dissatisfied with the busy plot and excessive character deaths, but Singer still liked some parts of the movie, such as Ellen Page's casting – leading Singer to bring her back as Kitty Pryde in [...] – and the scenes with Leech, which he described as [...] "really sweet moments". Matthew Vaughn, who was attached as director before dropping out, criticized Ratner's direction: [...] "I could have done something with far more emotion and heart. I'm probably going to be told off for saying that, but I genuinely believe it." [...] While promoting his own installment of the franchise, 2011's , Vaughn would say regarding The Last Stand that [...] "I storyboarded the whole bloody film, did the script. My X3 would have been 40 minutes longer. They didn't let the emotions and the drama play in that film. It became wall-to-wall noise and drama. I would have let it breathe and given far more dramatic elements to it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2001, {{he founded}} the Silverlake Conservatory of Music, a school {{dedicated}} to help youth progress in music, because of this. [...] "I just wanted {{to fill the void}} that public education has cut from their curriculum. They've dropped the ball by cutting out music programs", Flea laments, [...] "I grew up in LA public schools and was in the music department. It was really an important thing for my life, it gave me something to hold onto, and it was an important access for me. Without music I would've gotten into a lot of trouble <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of kids like me out there. I just wanted to try to provide something like what I got." [...] Flea felt the public school system was seriously lacking in exposing children to music by drastically reducing, and sometimes eliminating, art-related programs.|$|E

2500|$|Game Informers Justin Leeper {{scored the}} Xbox version 9.25 out of 10, calling it [...] "a {{tremendous}} game [...] the graphics are outstanding, and the seamless integration between real-time and FMV cutscenes {{will take your}} breath away." [...] GameSpot's Ryan MacDonald scored both the Xbox and the GameCube versions 8 out of 10, calling it [...] "a traditional hack-and-slash action game that features great gameplay mechanics, stunning visuals, and lots of extras." [...] IGN's Hilary Goldstein scored it 7.6 out of 10, writing [...] "while The Two Towers is fun, it's not {{really one of the}} better action games around. It does nothing new <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of problems that detract from the experience." [...] He was critical of the targeting system, the camera, the rigid linearity of each level and the inability to issue commands to AI controlled allies. He also wrote [...] "the Xbox version is inferior to the sharp and stunning quality of what was found on PS2. There's a ton of texture problems, poor contrast, and less detail than what's found on the PS2. That's not acceptable for a game coming out two months later and on a system that is easier to program for and can churn out incredible graphics with little effort." [...] GameSpy's David Hodgson scored it 3 out of 5, writing [...] "with the PlayStation 2 being all [...] "inferior" [...] to the Xbox's presumed power, and the two months of extra development time, surely E.A. must have added an extra aiming reticule for the archery, increased the frame rate from 30, sculpted a few more polygons on the main heroes and adversaries, and added reflections to the underwater orcs and other badly realized reflections. Well, don't bet on it, Bilbo. There are absolutely no differences between this, the GameCube, and the PlayStation 2 versions." ...|$|E
2500|$|Edwards {{decided on}} a {{restrained}} approach similar to when films were fueled by a [...] "sense of anticipation" [...] and relied on [...] "high suspense", with films such as Alien and Jaws. Edwards also wanted Godzilla to feel [...] "universal" [...] {{in a way that}} it could appeal to a general audience like Close Encounters of the Third Kind, which Edwards cited was a heavy influence on the film. Edwards additionally stated, [...] "I grew up watching Spielberg movies, what they did so well — as well as having epic, fantastic spectacle — they made the characters feel real and human. We were trying to do the same thing here." [...] Critics and journalists have also noted the film's nods and homages to Steven Spielberg's style of filmmaking and his films such as Jaws, Jurassic Park, and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Katsuhiro Otomo's Akira had also influenced the visual design of the film, Edwards stated, [...] "...one of our designers on the film - a friend called Matt - when we were designing things, and got stuck, we'd always go, 'What would Akira do?'" [...] For the film's cinematography, Edwards wanted [...] "...to do this beautifully real documentary vibe, but also that classic Spielberg style". Ishirō Honda's 1954 original Godzilla also inspired the film, Edwards stated, [...] "Godzilla is a metaphor for Hiroshima in the original movie. We tried to keep that, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of themes from the '54 movie that we've kept." [...] Real life events such as the 2004 Indian tsunami, Hurricane Katrina, and the Fukushima nuclear disaster served as heavy influences on the realism behind the film's destruction scenes and man vs. nature themes. Edwards had also cited action films from the late 70's and early 80's having influenced the film as well, stating, [...] "We tried to make a blockbuster that harks back to the pace and style of the early ’80s and late ’70s action movies." ...|$|E
