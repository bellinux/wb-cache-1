5|$|<b>A</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>after</b> the JTWC began issuing advisories, the {{depression}} made landfall in Dilasag, Philippines. The next day, after crossing into the South China Sea, {{the depression}} was upgraded to {{a tropical storm}} and named Prapiroon. Several hours later, PAGASA issued their final advisory on the storm as it moved out of their area of responsibility. By the morning of August2, Prapiroon intensified into a typhoon and reached its peak intensity with winds of 120km/h (75mph 10-min). The typhoon maintained this intensity until shortly before landfall near Shangyang, China at 12:00UTC on August3, where it weakened to a severe tropical storm. Prapiroon quickly weakened and dissipated early on August5.|$|E

5|$|After {{entering}} the Gulf of California, an eye began to become apparent on visible satellite imagery, {{and it is}} estimated Isis attained hurricane status late on September 2.

Melvin was born in Halifax in 1941, joining the Metropolitan Police in 1960, then the Criminal Investigation Department. He studied at Bramshill Police College, served with the Flying Squad, and was known for having solved several notorious cases, including that of Kenneth Erskine, the Stockwell Strangler.

5|$|By 26 April, {{the complex}} at Obersalzberg was {{under attack by}} the Allies, so Göring was moved to his castle at Mauterndorf. In his last will and testament, Hitler {{expelled}} Göring from the party and formally rescinded the decree making him his successor. He then appointed Karl Dönitz, the Navy's commander-in-chief, {{as president of the}} Reich and commander-in-chief of the armed forces. Hitler and his wife, Eva Braun, committed suicide on 30 April 1945, <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>after</b> a hastily arranged wedding. Göring was freed on 5 May by a passing Luftwaffe unit, and {{he made his way to}} the American lines in hopes of surrendering to them rather than to the Russians. He was taken into custody near Radstadt on 6 May by elements of the 36th Infantry Division of the United States Army.

5|$|Hurricane Chantal was one {{of three}} {{tropical}} cyclones to make landfall in Texas during the 1989 Atlantic hurricane season. The third named storm and the first hurricane of the season, Chantal slowly developed on July 30 in the southern Gulf of Mexico from a tropical disturbance that was previously within Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) while near Trinidad and Tobago. While heading north-northwestward, the depression steadily intensified and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Chantal on the following day. Thereafter, Chantal quickly strengthen and became a hurricane on August1. After intensifying slightly further, Chantal made landfall near High Island, Texas later that day. The storm quickly weakened upon moving inland and fell to tropical storm intensity <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>after</b> landfall.

5|$|On September 2, <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>after</b> Henriette {{became a}} {{tropical}} storm, {{the government of}} Mexico issued a tropical storm watch for Baja California Peninsula from La Paz southward.

Early on September 4, the hurricane warning was extended northward to 25°N. The threat of Hurricane Henriette prompted a Carnival Cruise Line ship to alter their route. Originally planned to tour Mexican ports, the captain turned the ship to tour the southern California coastline. Many upset passengers demanded refunds, to which the cruise line offered discounts for future cruises and a $40 credit card during their cruise.|$|E

The length of the spacewalk was partially due to some mistakes, including Voss accidentally releasing a small tool. Unable to retrieve it, NASA engineers tracked the tool, and decided to use Discoverys thrusters on 14 March to boost the station four kilometers higher, to ensure the ISS would not collide with the piece of space debris.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Greg was {{the only}} eastern Pacific {{tropical}} cyclone in 1999 to make a direct landfall. Part of the annual hurricane season, Greg originated from a tropical wave that departed Africa in mid-August. The wave entered the eastern Pacific by September1, steadily organizing over subsequent days to become a tropical depression on September5. Amid a favorable environment, the cyclone intensified into Tropical Storm Greg <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>after</b> formation and further organized into a Category 1 hurricane on September6. Greg paralleled the southwestern coastline of Mexico, where it destroyed over 250 homes, cut-off roads, killed 10 people, and left at least 4,000 more injured. The storm weakened to tropical storm intensity as it moved ashore Baja California Sur, although rain was generally beneficial there. Succumbing to cooler waters and high wind shear, Greg ultimately dissipated over the Pacific on September9. Its remnants led to thunderstorms across northern California, with only minor impacts.|$|E
5|$|On 2 September, Walker spoke by {{telephone}} with Major General Doyle O. Hickey, Deputy Chief of Staff, Far East Command, in Tokyo. He described the situation around the Perimeter {{and said the}} most serious threat was along {{the boundary between the}} U.S. 2nd and 25th Infantry Divisions. He said he had started the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade toward Yongsan but had not yet released them for commitment there and he wanted to be sure that General of the Army Douglas MacArthur approved his use of them, since he knew that this would interfere with other plans of the Far East Command. Walker said he did not think he could restore the 2nd Division lines without using them. Hickey replied that MacArthur had the day before approved the use of the Marines if and when Walker considered it necessary. <b>A</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>after</b> this conversation, at 13:15, Walker attached the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade to the U.S. 2nd Division and ordered a coordinated attack by all available elements of the division and the Marines, with the mission of destroying the North Koreans east of the Naktong River in the 2nd Division sector and of restoring the river line. The Marines were to be released from 2nd Division control as soon as this mission was accomplished.|$|E
5|$|Severe Tropical Storm Linfa, {{known in}} the Philippines as Tropical Storm Chedeng, brought deadly {{flooding}} to areas of the Philippines and Japan in May and June2003. The fifth named storm within the northwestern Pacific that year, Linfa developed as a tropical depression just off the western coast of Luzon on May25. The disturbance quickly intensified to reach tropical storm intensity <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>after</b> cyclogenesis. However, intensification leveled off as Linfa executed a small clockwise loop before a subsequent landfall on Luzon on May27. Due to land interaction the storm temporarily weakened and decoupled before reforming in the Philippine Sea. Afterwards Linfa began reintensifying and reached its peak intensity on May29 with maximum sustained winds of 100km/h (65mph) and a barometric pressure of 980mbar (hPa; 28.94inHg). Following its peak the tropical storm began to deteriorate and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on May30; these extratropical remnants continued to track northward through Japan before dissipating in the Sea of Okhotsk on June4.|$|E

40|$|A broadly active {{inhibitor}} {{of viruses}} (vaccinia, polio 1, and vesicular stomatitis) {{was found in}} the culture fluid from many types of normal human and mouse cells in culture. Virus plaque-inhibiting activity appeared in culture fluids within <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hour</b> <b>after</b> incubation of cultures with fresh medium. Peak inhibitory activity occurred within 24 h. Blockade of cellular ribonucleic acid or protein synthesis decreased appearance of the inhibitor, thereby substantiating that it is a cell-produced viral inhibitor. Inhibition of virus required the simultaneous presence of inhibitor, virus, and cells (due to the reversible nature of the inhibition of virus attachment and penetration, as shown in the accompanying paper [T. K. Hughes et al., Infect Immun. 32 : 454 - 457, 1981]). The degree of inhibitory activity depended on the animal species of origin of the inhibitor, the cell type used for assay, and the virus type used for challenge. No cell species barrier against inhibitor action was found. Strong inhibition of multicycle yields of vesicular stomatitis virus and Sindbis virus was caused by low doses of inhibitor. These specific characteristics of the present inhibitor separate it from commonly recognized inhibitors. Possible biological significance of the inhibitor is discussed...|$|R
