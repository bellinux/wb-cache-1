40|$|Axisymmetric {{numerical}} simulations with finite-rate chemistry {{are presented}} for two operating {{conditions in the}} HYPULSE <b>expansion</b> <b>tube.</b> The operating gas for these two cases is nitrogen and the computations are compared to experimental data. One test condition is at a total enthalpy of 15. 2 MJ/Kg and a relatively low static pressure of 2 kPa. This case {{is characterized by a}} laminar boundary layer and significant chemical nonequilibrium in the acceleration gas. The second test condition is at a total enthalpy of 10. 2 MJ/Kg and a static pressure of 38 kPa and is characterized by a turbulent boundary layer. For both cases, the time-varying test gas pressure predicted by the simulations is in good agreement with experimental data. The computations are also found to be in good agreement with Mirels' correlations for shock tube flow. It is shown that the nonuniformity of the test gas observed in the HYPULSE <b>expansion</b> <b>tube</b> is strongly linked to the boundary layer thickness. The turbulent flow investigated has a larger boundary layer and greater test gas nonuniformity. In order to investigate possibilities of improving <b>expansion</b> <b>tube</b> flow quality by reducing the boundary layer thickness, parametric studies showing the effect of density and turbulent transition point on the test conditions are also presented.

40|$|The {{accurate}} {{simulation of}} flow conditions encountered by aircraft {{is imperative to}} the development of aeronautics and astronautics. Test flights are expensive and time consuming, thus, ground based test facilities provide the majority of data in new flight regimes. A mixture of analytical studies, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), experimental results from ground based test facilities and actual atmospheric flights are required to obtain important design parameters. Coupled with this need for aerodynamic information, is a constant desire to simulate higher flow speeds. <b>Expansion</b> <b>tubes</b> provide an option for testing aeroshells such as the new Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) or the high enthalpy end of scramjet flight regime. A unique opportunity already exists in which the fabricated hardware for the RHYFL shock tunnel could be utilized to create the worlds largest <b>expansion</b> <b>tube,</b> RHYFL-X. This thesis continues a project which attempted to investigate if RHYFL-X would be a beneficial experimental tool. This thesis began by installing and commissioning a new single-stage, free-piston driver for the X 2 <b>expansion</b> <b>tube</b> located at the University of Queensland. The new configuration provided a smaller scale version of the RHYFL-X <b>expansion</b> <b>tube</b> on which testing could be performed. It also provided a number of advantages which would lead to increased performance in the X 2 facility. Once installation was complete, a series of experiments was conducted to ensure that the new driver configuration was operating correctly and to determine the capabilities of it. Four conditions were examined. Two air conditions which produced secondary shock speeds of 8. 14 km/s and 8. 61 km/s, a condition to simulate the entry into the Titan atmosphere at 5. 51 km/s and another condition to simulate entry into the Jovian atmosphere at 10. 2 km/s. Numerical one-dimensional models were examined along with hybrid simulations, which used the one-dimensional model up to rupture of the secondary diaphragm and then coupled this to an axisymmetric simulation of the acceleration tube. The results from these numerical simulation models compared well to the experiments and showed that the new driver provided {{a significant increase in the}} stagnation pressures that could be generated in the <b>expansion</b> <b>tube</b> over the old two-stage, free-piston driver. There have been claims in previous studies that an <b>expansion</b> <b>tube</b> nozzle would not only increase the core flow diameter but also the steady time available for testing. However, this claim has never been physically demonstrated. A full-capture, contoured, shockfree nozzle was designed for the new X 2 configuration. The design code for the nozzle incorporated a flow solver for the Parabolized Navier-Stokes (PNS) equations coupled to a Nelder-Mead optimization algorithm. A 1. 4 m nozzle was installed at the end of the acceleration tube and a series of experiments conducted. CFD simulations similar to the hybrid method mentioned above were conducted with the nozzle attached. The experiments again matched well with the numerical models. The results indicated that the addition of the nozzle produced a larger core flow diameter and longer test time as had been claimed. However, the improvements were not as significant as predicted by the axisymmetric simulations. Extremely large boundary layers were formed but sufficient core flow was still generated to enable the testing of models. Both the addition of a single-stage, free-piston driver and a contoured nozzle has significantly increased the capabilities of the X 2 <b>expansion</b> <b>tube.</b> The numerical models that are used in this thesis provide an excellent basis for the prediction of the flow that can be generated in the X-series of <b>expansion</b> <b>tubes</b> located at the University of Queensland.
