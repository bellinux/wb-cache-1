25|$|CIPN often {{follows the}} first {{chemotherapy}} dose {{and increases in}} severity as treatment continues, but this progression usually levels off <b>at</b> <b>completion</b> of treatment.

Pain can often be helped with drug or other treatment but the numbness is usually resistant to treatment. A 2007 American study found that most patients did not recall being told to expect CIPN, and doctors monitoring the condition rarely asked how it affects daily living but focused on practical effects such as dexterity and gait.|$|E
25|$|Negotiations {{subsequently}} turned {{towards the}} amount of that tax, and Switzerland offered {{to build a new}} high-speed rail link through the Alps for the main purpose of intermodal transport, which has been accepted by a public vote on 27 September 1992. The EU finally accepted the offer in 2000, but demanded that the then valid 28-tonne limit for trucks be raised to 48 tonnes. A compromise was reached on a step-by-step raise of the weight limit to 40 tonnes. The bilateral Land Transport Agreement with the European Union was thus signed, agreeing to an increase of the kilometre-based tax on HGVs from 1.6ct/tkm to 1.8ct/tkm <b>at</b> <b>completion</b> of the NRLA.

25|$|The airport's 2024 {{master plan}} calls for the {{completion}} of a rail link that will connect with the Midland Line between Bayswater Station and Ashfield Station at the Tonkin Highway. The rail link was initially theorised to continue above ground along Tonkin Highway to the Great Eastern Highway where it was believed to go underground along Brearley Avenue and to the terminals in operation <b>at</b> <b>completion</b> of the line. The link to the airport was originally proposed in the 1990s by nearby local government bodies, however the proposal was not followed through at the time. In 2014, the rail link plan received its final approval from the state government, and is expected to be complete by 2020, construction started in 2016, the rail link however will be entirely underground, contradicting the original plan of it being partly underground and party above ground. On 17 January 2017, Brearley Avenue was closed to accommodate the construction of Belmont railway station. On 28 May 2017, Airport Central station officially started construction.|$|E
25|$|Between 30 and 40 {{percent of}} {{patients}} undergoing chemotherapy experience chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), a progressive, enduring, and often irreversible condition, causing pain, tingling, numbness and sensitivity to cold, beginning in the hands and feet and sometimes progressing to the arms and legs. Chemotherapy drugs associated with CIPN include thalidomide, epothilones, vinca alkaloids, taxanes, proteasome inhibitors, and the platinum-based drugs. Whether CIPN arises, and to what degree, {{is determined by the}} choice of drug, duration of use, the total amount consumed and whether the patient already has peripheral neuropathy. Though the symptoms are mainly sensory, in some cases motor nerves and the autonomic nervous system are affected. CIPN often follows the first chemotherapy dose and increases in severity as treatment continues, but this progression usually levels off <b>at</b> <b>completion</b> of treatment. The platinum-based drugs are the exception; with these drugs, sensation may continue to deteriorate for several months after the end of treatment. Some CIPN appears to be irreversible. Pain can often be managed with drug or other treatment but the numbness is usually resistant to treatment.|$|E
25|$|In 1901, {{the village}} of Two Harbors decided it needed a high school. On February 12, 1902, Two Harbors Central High School was {{dedicated}} at a total cost of $35,025. This school was on the 400 block of Fourth Avenue. It had fifty students and three teachers. The first of these students to graduate were Mary Rylander and Ann Paulson. The school taught arithmetic, grammar, and American History. Very little English was taught at the time. In 1903 Latin and music were introduced. Courses in science and sewing were added in 1906. Manual training and domestic services were not introduced until 1908. By 1909 the school had almost doubled with ninety-eight students and seven teachers. By 1910 the school library had seven thousand books. Plans for a new building were announced in 1935, at an estimated $100,000. The original Central High School was demolished and the new building was completed in 1939. <b>At</b> <b>completion,</b> and after all additions were made, the total cost was $585,000. A referendum for a new building to be located two miles (3km) north of town on Lake County Highway 2 (CR 2) was passed in 2003. Building was completed and classes began in 2005. Students use the hiking trails in the woods, around ponds, and the football field. The former high school on 4th Avenue was demolished in 2008.|$|E

40|$|After making {{experiments}} concerning 50 infants under {{a perfect}} medical guidance, the following results were revealed by {{an investigation of}} the relation between their ingestion of "weaning food" and their bodily growth in the weaning period. (1) When the period before the beginning of weaning (about six months after birth) was compared with its completion time (about one year after birth), it was found that Kaup's index number rather rose <b>at</b> the <b>completion</b> time. (2) As to those infants whose Kaup's index number <b>at</b> the <b>completion</b> period of weaning became less than the index seen before the starting time, the amount and the percentage of calorie of milk taken daily are less than in the case of those infants whose index number became greater <b>at</b> the <b>completion</b> period than <b>at</b> the beginning.
