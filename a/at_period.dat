30|$|<b>At</b> <b>periods</b> of 24 to 30 s and longer, an E/W {{dichotomy}} can {{be found}} around the RRSZ, with low velocities {{in the western part}} and higher velocities {{in the eastern part of}} the model. This is in good agree by receiver function analyses (Nguyen et al. 2013). <b>At</b> <b>periods</b> sampling the upper lithosphere (24 to 30 s), small variations in the fast direction of anisotropy is observed compared to shorter periods, with a small variation in the direction (30 °/ 40 °) between the fast axis of the ansitropy on both sides of the RRSZ. This can be explained by frozen anisotropy in the lithosphere beneath the region. <b>At</b> longer <b>periods</b> (40 to 50 s), sampling the lithosphere, the small-scale anomalies seem to merge together and display less heterogeneities than <b>at</b> shorter <b>periods</b> (Figure 11 e,f).|$|R

40|$|Induction in {{electrically}} conductive seawater attenu-ates the magnetotelluric (MT) fields and, {{coupled with a}} minimum around 1 Hz in the natural magnetic field spec-trum, leads to a dramatic loss of electric and magnetic field power on the sea floor <b>at</b> <b>periods</b> shorter than 1000 s. For this reason the marine MT method traditionally has been used only <b>at</b> <b>periods</b> of 103 to 105 s to probe deep mantle structure; rarely does a sea-floor MT response extend to a 100 -s period. To be useful for mapping conti-nental shelf structure at depths relevant to petroleum ex-ploration, however, MT measurements {{need to be made}} <b>at</b> <b>periods</b> between 1 and 1000 s. This can be accom-plished using ac-coupled sensors, induction coils for the magnetic field, and an electric field amplifier developed for marine controlled-source applications. The electri-cally quiet sea floor allows the attenuated electric field to be amplified greatly before recording; in deep (1 -km) water, motional noise in magnetic field sensors appears not to be a problem. In shallower water, motional noise does degrade the magnetic measurement, but sea-floor magnetic records can be replaced by land recordings, producing an effective sea-surface MT response. Field trials of such equipment in 1 -km-deep water produced good-quality MT responses <b>at</b> <b>periods</b> of 3 to 1000 s; in shallower water, responses to a few hertz can be ob-tained.
