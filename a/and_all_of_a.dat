5|$|Satchel {{was easier}} to catch. He could throw it in a quart cup. But Rogan {{was all over the}} plate—high, low, inside, outside. He'd walk five-six men, but he didn't give up many runs. Bullet had a little more steam on the ball than Paige—and he had a better-breaking curve. The batters thought it was a fastball heading for them and they would jump back from the plate <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sudden, it would break sharply for a strike. I would rank him with today's best. I have never seen a pitcher like him, and I have caught some of the best {{pitchers}} in the business.|$|E

25|$|This an {{opportunity}} to put people who would normally {{have no reason to}} interact with each other on one team... I want people whose power sets really build on each other so that there are specific limitations that can only become overcome by working together. Nobody's so overpowered that it gets boring and nobody's so underpowered that they have to be saved all the time. I wanted a balance visually and practically... What's also going to be interesting is working out the power structure of the group. You have several people on it who are used to being either their own bosses or in a leadership position, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sudden they're together.|$|E

25|$|Durham were a {{prime example}} of how the lack of three men can change a team. Three months earlier, Michael Hussey, Paul Collingwood and Steve Harmison had been firing for the Durham lads as they beat Leicestershire by an innings and 216 runs, the highest margin of victory in the County Championship so far this season - before this match. Without these three, and only with Nathan Astle and Ashley Noffke by way of replacement, they {{collapsed}} to 167 against the bowling of Glen Chapple and Gary Keedy, before Mal Loye made a double ton and Dominic Cork an unbeaten ton to give Lancashire a 363-run lead on first innings. Then, Chapple took four for 18, as Durham rolled over yet again for 135 - <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sudden the league leaders were transformed into laughing stocks.|$|E
25|$|Another run {{out three}} overs later saw Vincent {{back in the}} pavilion, having added 37, before Hamish Marshall was bowled through the gate for 8 by Yadav, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sudden New Zealand were 115 for 4, and {{patience}} was required from Styris and McMillan. They played that role well, only hitting 16 runs in boundaries between them yet adding 87 together, {{setting the stage for}} hard hitting from wicket-keeper McCullum. Styris, once again, was the highest scorer of the New Zealand innings. After playing himself in, McCullum first hit a six off Agarkar to end the 44th over, before unleashing himself in the 46th. He was caught off a no-ball and dropped off the next delivery, and then smashed the remaining five balls for eighteen, with three fours and one six. Having added 28 in total, he then was caught by Kaif, but the pace was set. New Zealand notched up 31 runs in the final three overs, not bothering much with the loss of wickets, and ended with 278 for 9.|$|E
25|$|On day three, however, Kent hit back. In 33 fiery overs before lunch, Amjad Khan and Min Patel both {{took two}} wickets, and despite more runs from Ervine - who {{finished}} with 74 - Hampshire crumbled to 182 for 7 at lunch. However, Andy Bichel and Nic Pothas added 138 {{for the eighth}} wicket, as Hampshire eked out 325, with Bichel top-scoring from number nine with 87 off 90 balls. Kent got a good start to their attempt to get quick runs and put a big target up for Hampshire, as they moved to 140 for 4 just before the close of play, but Shane Watson took two quick wickets and Shaun Udal one, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sudden {{it was up to}} Justin Kemp and Andrew Hall to save Kent, as they were 153 for 7 overnight. Kemp fell on the fourth morning, as Kent rolled over for 185, setting up a potentially exciting finish with 307 runs to get in 83 overs. A 95-run partnership between Sean Ervine and John Crawley put Hampshire into a good position at 139 for 1, but Hampshire failed to score quickly enough, and three wickets from Simon Cook could not quite force a victory as Hampshire hung on to finish on 241 for 8 and draw the match.|$|E

25|$|In late 1966, {{the then}} Secretary for Chinese Affairs, John McDouall, retired to the United Kingdom and Holmes {{was chosen to}} succeed the post which McDouall had served for a decade. Nevertheless, {{at the time of}} his {{promotion}} the Cultural Revolution had just broken out in the mainland China and the situation of Hong Kong had become increasingly unstable. In the following year, Hong Kong was finally hit by the outbreak of the 1967 Leftist Riots, a series of riots which was triggered by a labour dispute. During the disorder, Governor Sir David Trench happened to be absent from Hong Kong <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sudden there was no one fully in command of the government. As a result, then Colonial Secretary, Sir Michael Gass, became acting-Governor and Holmes became acting-Colonial Secretary, and therefore it was Holmes and Gass who were in charge in the crisis. At the beginning of the riot, there were only general strikes in Hong Kong but the situation worsened quickly when the Communists started to put pipe bombs on the streets. The presence of pipe bombs was a big blow to Hong Kong as it roused public fear, while the British government and the Hong Kong government secretly discussed whether or not to abandon the Crown Colony. It was said that Holmes strongly resisted the idea of retreat in the Executive Council, and he successfully persuaded the British to stay. Under the leadership of Holmes, the government adopted a hard-line policy towards the Communists and called on the general public to denounce the leftists. Finally, the rioting ended in late 1967, and the tough stance held by Holmes was deeply appreciated by the government.|$|E
500|$|Randle {{described}} the feeling {{after the game}} as, [...] "It's like driving down a street and getting every green light {{for the next ten}} miles, and you're just cruising along, and it's just smooth. <b>And</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sudden, you're getting there, you're almost there, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sudden, the fucking light turns red, and you get sideswiped." [...] Randle further laments the loss due to the background of many of his teammates, whom he described as [...] "misfits, guys who just got their second chance." [...] Beyond Moss's legal troubles, Carter had been released by the Philadelphia Eagles early in his career for substance abuse issues, and Cunningham was released by the Eagles and remained unsigned to a team two seasons prior. Randle himself was considered undersized coming out of college and was not heavily pursued by NFL teams.|$|E

500|$|In March 1969, Maryland {{athletic}} director Jim Kehoe called a meeting among 120 players, Ward, his assistants, and a three-man committee. Thirty-one players told Ward {{that they no}} longer wished to play on the team and accused him of using intimidation tactics that included verbal and physical abuse. Ward listened to the player's grievances, but did not respond at the time. Two days later, he resigned as head coach. Later that year, Sports Illustrated interviewed Ward, and he said:"I won't go into all the specifics, but it wasn't the good players who started it. It was the guys who couldn't fight their way out of a paper bag, guys who sat on the bench and couldn't take it and a couple of pip-squeak cub newspaper guys who don't know what football's all about...He gets on the campus newspaper <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sudden he's got power he never thought of having." ...|$|E

500|$|Desert Strike {{underwent}} {{few changes}} from the plans {{outlined in the}} original design documents. The initial concept involved smoothly animated vehicles on an isometric playing field. The developers also aimed to include cinematic scenes, similar to The Revenge of Shinobis introduction sequence. The game began development some time before any discussion of an American invasion of Iraq, originally based on the Lebanese Civil War and titled Beirut Breakout; this was later changed to the Persian Gulf region. John Manley recalled, [...] "We actually wrote most of Desert Strike before Desert Shield happened. We were watching CNN {{at three in the}} afternoon <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sudden it was like, 'Oh my god - it's happening!'" [...] A special point system intended to punish players was omitted; the system would have deducted points from the player's score if they destroyed objects that resulted in negative economic and political results. The control scheme was not well received at internal reviews of the game's early versions, and Posehn had to alter his original design to obtain approval for further development.|$|E
