5|$|This {{concurrency}} ends {{after another}} mile, when US44 diverges {{along the route}} of the former NY44A, going around the village of Millbrook past the Mary Flagler Cary Arboretum, home to the Institute of Ecosystem Studies. The highway returns to a more due-east orientation <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>passes</b> north of the village, then gradually curves to the northeast again <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>passes</b> through a heavily farmed area.|$|E
5|$|Following the interchange, US30 enters Waterford Township, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>passes</b> {{near the}} {{community}} of Atco. The road turns south <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>passes</b> Atco Lake and continues into more wooded areas with some development, eventually heading south-southeast again. New Jersey Transit’s Atlantic City Line runs a short distance to the northeast of the route at this point. US30 continues through Chesilhurst before it enters Winslow Township. Here, the route intersects CR536 and forms a short concurrency with that route before it heads to the east. From this point, the road continues into a mix of woodland, farmland, and development. US30 intersects Route143 and passes over the Atlantic City Line as it turns southeast. The road makes another turn to the south as it crosses CR723.|$|E

5|$|M-124 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with M-50 {{just south of}} Brooklyn. The trunkline runs eastward on Wampers Lake Road through a residential section of town and crosses the River Raisin {{on the north side}} of Vineyard Lake. After passing Vineyard Lake, the highway curves towards the southwest <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>passes</b> several other smaller lakes and heads towards Wamplers Lake. M-124 passes between Wamplers and Mud lakes, curving around the eastern side of Wamplers Lake as it enters Walter J. Hayes State Park from the north. The park is a popular tourist destination for boaters, craft and antique shows and its close proximity to Michigan International Speedway. The road nearly bisects the park <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>passes</b> through near Round Lake before exiting the park and terminating an at intersection with US12.|$|E

5|$|For {{the length}} of this concurrency, it is a divided four lane {{expressway}} with no left turns, known as right-in/right-out (RIRO). At Enterprise Hill, Highway 35 exits the divided highway (which continues as Highway 115 east to Peterborough) and proceeds north as a two lane road.

MD355 passes over I-70/US 40 and ends just north of the overpass, with the road continuing north into Frederick as locally maintained Market Street.|$|E
5|$|Just {{north of}} the {{community}} of Hale the road enters the Huron National Forest near Loon Lake. The trunkline takes a turn to the east <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>passes</b> along the Au Sable River. The River Road National Scenic Byway starts on M-65 at Rollways Road, and the highway generally follows the river <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>passes</b> by a former logging community which is commemorated by Lumberman's Monument. At the intersection with River Road, M-65 turns north to cross the Au Sable, and the byway designation continues east along River Road to follow the river to Oscoda. The M-65 bridge over the Au Sable is just downstream of the Five Channels Dam, crossing high above the water below. The highway turns northwesterly through forest land to cross into Alcona County. North of the county line, the trunkline follows Baker and State roads near Vaughn and Hunters lakes. M-65 meets the western terminus of county road F-30 in the community of Glennie. The highway also crosses the South Branch of the Pine River.|$|E
5|$|The Fulton Chain Lakes which NY28 {{has been}} {{following}} extend into Hamilton County.

5|$|The {{apparent}} {{brightness of}} a star is {{expressed in terms of}} its apparent magnitude. It {{is a function of the}} star's luminosity, its distance from Earth, and the altering of the star's light <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>passes</b> through Earth's atmosphere. Intrinsic or absolute magnitude is directly related to a star's luminosity, and is what the apparent magnitude a star would be if the distance between the Earth and the star were 10 parsecs (32.6 light-years).|$|E
5|$|The {{globular}} cluster Palomar 5, for example, {{is near the}} apogalactic point of its orbit after passing through the Milky Way. Streams of stars extend outward toward {{the front and rear}} of the orbital path of this cluster, stretching out to distances of 13,000 light-years. Tidal interactions have stripped away much of the mass from Palomar 5, and further interactions <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>passes</b> through the galactic core are expected to transform it into a long stream of stars orbiting the Milky Way halo.|$|E
