The seeds are stored in a special low temperature, low humidity facility and {{a complete list of}} accessions {{can be found in the}} GRU's database SeedStor, which was released at the end of 2014. The oldest collection kept in GRU is the Watkins Landrace Wheat Collection, which has a variety of wheat landraces cultivars acquired by A.E. Watkins in the 1930s from 32 different countries in Asia, Europe and Africa. Because the samples were collected before modern Plant Breeding efforts and the Green revolution, it is a very interesting source of genetic variability for novel <b>agronomic</b> <b>trait</b> discovery. The collection was screened in 2014 by John Innes Centre researchers, and a great level of genetic diversity was found.The BBSRC Small Grain Cereal Collection is the largest in the UK and originated from a series of working collections from different plant breeding and research institutes from the UK. The collection was produced alongside public sector breeding programmes, and has the potential to be a source of important traits regarding disease, pest and stress resistance.GRU also houses a Pisum collection, all of the elite varieties that are registered in the UK National Listing, and several specialist genetic collections, such as near-isogenic lines, TILLING collections, precise genetic stocks, mapping populations, host differentials for disease testing and variant collections developed and targeted at the research and breeding communities.|$|E

30|$|Rice {{flowering}} time (heading date), {{which is}} affected by both endogenous and exogenous factors, is an important <b>agronomic</b> <b>trait</b> for regional and seasonal adaption. Heading on a proper time is the most critical step for grain production. Precocious flowering reduces the vegetative phase and leads to reduction of biological yield.

30|$|The {{analysis}} of genetic variation among different genotypes provides basic {{information about the}} germplasm enhancement for breeding. Autotetraploid rice with doubling of chromosomes showed a higher variation in <b>agronomic</b> <b>traits,</b> cellular level, quality and molecular level (Song and Zhang 1992;Luan et al. 2008). In the present study, autotetraploid rice had higher 1000 -grain weight, grain length and grain width, but lower effective spikelet number, number of total panicles per plant and seed set ratio. In comparison with the diploid rice, production-related <b>agronomic</b> <b>traits</b> mainly occurred in autotetraploid rice. Therefore, 14 production-related <b>agronomic</b> <b>traits</b> were {{used to evaluate the}} phenotypic variation, and the results showed that {{there was a significant difference}} in diploid and autotetraploid rice for all <b>agronomic</b> <b>traits</b> under study. These results are in agreement with other studies, that autotetraploid showed significant variation in <b>agronomic</b> <b>traits</b> than their diploid counter parts (Tu et al. 2007;Shahid et al. 2011).|$|R

The objective of this study was to determine the combining ability for resistance to late leafspot and agronomic trailts. Four resistant cultivar and four adapted lines were crossed in M x N mating design.

Such inter-subspecific hybrid male sterility is thought to be controlled by interaction between indica alleles and japonica alleles of several loci such as Sa, Sb, Sc, Sd, and Se (Ouyang et al. 2010).

30|$|Since {{cultivated}} rice, O. sativa, has {{a complex}} population structure, care is needed when {{we attempt to}} study associations of certain DNA natural variations with variations in traits among landraces and cultivars [5, 6, 12, 15]. The population structure of rice indicates that various DNA polymorphisms at scattered chromosomal positions must be observed coincidently in plants within {{a certain type of}} population structure, such as indica, aus, aromatic, tropical japonica, and temperate japonica. Therefore, simple association of a certain DNA polymorphism with an <b>agronomic</b> <b>trait</b> (phenotype) does not necessarily confirm that the polymorphism is responsible for the <b>agronomic</b> <b>trait.</b> In contrast, when tight genetic linkage of a phenotype with certain DNA polymorphisms that are present within natural variations can be confirmed, one can conclude that the polymorphism is responsible for the phenotypic diversity and refer to it as an FNP [16, 27]. If the genotype of the FNP shows an association with phenotypic variation in the corresponding trait among landraces or modern cultivars of a certain type of population structure, this strongly suggests that the FNP is involved in the rice domestication process or the modern breeding process. For instance, when an FNP seems to behave like a mutation in a subspecies, with only some landraces having the FNP in the subspecies showing the characteristic trait, one can conclude that the FNP was involved in the process of establishment of the subspecies. In contrast, if the association fits closely with a certain rice subspecies based on its population structures, {{it is possible that the}} FNP was not directly involved in rice domestication. In this case, the examination for the FNP of existing wild species that could have common ancestors with the subspecies is necessary to discuss the involvement of the FNP in domestication.|$|E
30|$|Rice {{genomics}} has enhanced {{our understanding}} of the genetic control of <b>agronomic</b> <b>traits</b> and provided tools for crop improvement. Most <b>agronomic</b> <b>traits</b> are controlled by multiple genes and show complex, quantitative inheritance. Therefore, efforts have been concentrated on identification of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with beneficial traits. QTL alleles with economic value have been tagged by DNA markers and introduced into elite cultivars by marker-assisted selection (MAS). The complete sequence of the rice genome (IRGSP 2005) has supported sophisticated procedures to facilitate genetic analysis of traits of interest, and several genes for <b>agronomic</b> <b>traits</b> have been cloned (Yamamoto et al. 2009). These studies have contributed to our understanding both of the genetic control of several important traits and of the molecular mechanisms of trait expression.
