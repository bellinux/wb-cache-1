5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Empire {{was faced with}} new enemies. Provinces in {{southern}} Italy faced the Normans, who arrived in Italy {{at the beginning of}} the 11th century. During a period of strife between Constantinople and Rome culminating in the East-West Schism of 1054, the Normans began to advance, slowly but steadily, into Byzantine Italy. Reggio, the capital of the tagma of Calabria, was captured in 1060 by Robert Guiscard, followed by Otranto in 1068. Bari, the main Byzantine stronghold in Apulia, was besieged in August 1068 <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> <b>in</b> April 1071.

5|$|Boganda's {{attachment}} to his chosen calling weakened {{when he met}} <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> <b>in</b> love with a young Frenchwoman, Michelle Jourdain, who was employed as a parliamentary secretary. They were married on 13 June 1950, for which Boganda was expelled from the priesthood and {{cut off from the}} Catholic hierarchy's support. Boganda and Jourdain would later have two daughters and a son. The affair caused a minor scandal in Paris, but it did little to dent his popularity with his people. In the National Assembly he continued to battle, often in vain, against repressive features of the French administration in Oubangui-Chari. Arbitrary arrest, low wages, compulsory cotton cultivation, and the exclusion of blacks from restaurants and cinemas were all targets of his rhetoric.|$|E
5|$|Ernest met <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> <b>in</b> love in mid-1813 {{with his}} first cousin, Duchess Frederica of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, wife of Prince Frederick William of Solms-Braunfels and widow of Prince Louis of Prussia.

Her {{marriage}} to Frederick William {{had not been a}} success; her husband, seeing the marriage was beyond hope, agreed to a divorce, but his sudden death in 1814 removed the necessity. Some considered the death too convenient, and suspected the princess of poisoning her husband. Queen Charlotte opposed the marriage: before the princess had married Frederick William, she had jilted Ernest's brother, the Duke of Cambridge, after the engagement was announced.|$|E

Triumphant, Titus returned to Rome to assist his father in the government, while Berenice stayed behind in Judaea.|$|E

Jefferson did this for a time, but after the Kingpin was arrested and convicted for his crimes, and Jefferson offered a chance to be a full-fledged S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, he refused, not wanting any part of his brother's world. He met Rio a week later <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> <b>in</b> love with her.

5|$|The ballad, The Mermaid of Padstow, tells {{a similar}} story of a local named Tom Yeo, who shot the mermaid mistaking her for a seal. John Betjeman, who was well-acquainted with the area, wrote in 1969 that the mermaid met a local man <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> <b>in</b> love with him. When {{she could no longer}} bear living without him, she tried to lure him beneath the waves but he escaped by {{shooting}} her. In her rage she threw a handful of sand towards Padstow, around which the sandbank grew. In other versions of the tale, the mermaid sings from the rocks and a youth shoots at her with a crossbow, or a greedy man shoots her with a longbow. Mermaids were believed to sing to their victims so that they can lure adulterers to their death.|$|E

There, he grew close to <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> <b>in</b> love with his uncle's daughter, Princess Marie. His grandmother, father and uncle all approved the match, but the mothers—the Princess of Wales and the Duchess of Edinburgh—both opposed it. The Princess of Wales thought the family was too pro-German, and the Duchess of Edinburgh disliked England. Marie's mother was the only daughter of Tsar Alexander II of Russia. She resented the fact that, as the wife of a younger son of the British sovereign, she had to yield precedence to George's mother, the Princess of Wales, whose father had been a minor German prince before being called unexpectedly to the throne of Denmark. Guided by her mother, Marie refused George when he proposed to her. She married Ferdinand, the heir to the King of Romania, in 1893.|$|E
