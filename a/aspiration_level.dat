5000|$|The {{idea of the}} [...] was {{introduced}} by Herbert A. Simon and developed in economics by Richard Cyert and James March in their 1963 book A Behavioral Theory of the Firm. The <b>aspiration</b> <b>level</b> is the payoff that the agent aspires to: if the agent achieves at least this level it is satisfied, {{and if it does}} not achieve it, the agent is not satisfied. Let us define the <b>aspiration</b> <b>level</b> [...] and assume that [...] Clearly, whilst it is possible that someone can aspire to something that is better than the optimum, it is in a sense irrational to do so. So, we require the <b>aspiration</b> <b>level</b> to be at or below the optimum payoff.|$|E

40|$|The {{situation}} of multi-choice <b>aspiration</b> <b>levels</b> (MCAL) may exist in many decision/management problems. However, the problem cannot {{be solved by}} current goal programming (GP) techniques. In order to improve the utility of GP and solve the MCAL problem, this paper proposes a new idea for programming the MCAL problem. The proposed method allows decision-makers (DMs) to set multiple <b>aspiration</b> <b>levels</b> for their problems in which "the more/higher is better" and "the less/lower is better" in the <b>aspiration</b> <b>levels</b> are addressed. In addition, illustrative examples are given to demonstrate the correctness of the proposed model. Goal programming Multi-choice <b>aspiration</b> <b>levels...</b>|$|R
40|$|In a duopoly market, <b>aspiration</b> <b>levels</b> express {{how much}} sellers want to earn given their {{expectations}} about the other?s behavior. We augment the sellers? decision task by eliciting their profit aspiration. In a first experimental phase, whenever satisficing is not possible, sales choices, point beliefs, or <b>aspiration</b> <b>levels</b> have to be adapted. This allows us to investigate which of these three aspects individuals revise more often. In a second phase, testing the absorption of satisficing, participants are free to select non-satisficing sales profiles. The results reveal that most participants are satisficers who tend to adjust <b>aspiration</b> <b>levels</b> if they cannot be satisfied.

3000|$|If {{we do not}} use the sum of probabilities, then we have {{multiple}} probability values for each objective function. Consider the values as <b>aspiration</b> <b>levels</b> of the objective function. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, the problem with multiple aspirations cannot be solved by current GP approaches because in traditional GP with multiple <b>aspiration</b> <b>levels</b> the <b>aspirations</b> are input values while in reality some conditions may influence the desired deviation of goals. Thus, an approach is required to handle different conditions for computing the <b>aspiration</b> <b>levels</b> of objective functions (see Lotfi et al. 1997; Chang 2011). This problem can be solved by an MCGP approach and can be expressed as follows: [...]...|$|R

5000|$|An {{economic}} {{example is}} the Dixon model of an economy consisting of many firms operating in different industries, where each industry is a duopoly. The endogenous <b>aspiration</b> <b>level</b> is the average profit in the economy. This represents {{the power of the}} financial markets: in the long-run firms need to earn normal profits or they die (as Armen Alchian once said, [...] "This is the criterion by which the economic system selects survivors: those who realize positive proﬁts are the survivors; those who suffer losses disappear"). We can then think what happens over time. If firms are earning profits at or above their <b>aspiration</b> <b>level,</b> then they just stay doing what they are doing (unlike the optimizing firm which would always strive to earn the highest profits possible). However, if the firms are earning below aspiration, then they try something else, until they get into a situation where they attain their <b>aspiration</b> <b>level.</b> It can be shown that in this economy, satisficing leads to collusion amongst firms: competition between firms leads to lower profits for {{one or both of the}} firms in a duopoly. This means that competition is unstable: one or both of the firms will fail to achieve their aspirations and hence try something else. The only situation which is stable is one where all firms achieve their aspirations, which can only happen when all firms earn average profits. In general, this will only happen if all firms earn the joint-profit maximizing or collusive profit.|$|E
50|$|What {{determines the}} <b>aspiration</b> <b>level?</b> This {{can come from}} past {{experience}} (some function of an agent's or firm's previous payoffs), or some organizational or market institutions. For example, if we think of managerial firms, the managers {{will be expected to}} earn normal profits by their shareholders. Other institutions may have specific targets imposed externally (for example state-funded universities in the UK have targets for student recruitment).|$|E

Studies involve a firm's innovation performance, <b>aspiration</b> <b>level,</b> and organizational learning. It has been said that in order to be innovative an organization should develop its absorptive capacity.|$|E
5000|$|According to the UTI doctrine, {{each country}} has rights to all water in its region and upstream. These rights are not {{compatible}} since their sum {{is above the}} total amount of water. However, these rights define an upper bound - the largest utility that a country can hope for. This is the utility it could get alone, if there were no other countries upstream: [...] Moreover, the <b>aspiration</b> <b>level</b> of each coalition of countries is the highest utility-level it could attain {{in the absence of the}} other countries. This implies an upper bound on the utility of each coalition, called the aspiration upper bound.|$|E
50|$|Graphical {{representation}} of decision analysis problems commonly use framing tools, influence diagrams and decision trees. Such tools {{are used to}} represent the alternatives available to the decision maker, the uncertainty they involve, and evaluation measures representing how well objectives would be achieved in the final outcome. Uncertainties are represented through probabilities. The decision maker's attitude to risk is represented by utility functions and their attitude to trade-offs between conflicting objectives can be expressed using multi-attribute value functions or multi-attribute utility functions (if there is risk involved). In some cases, utility functions can {{be replaced by the}} probability of achieving uncertain aspiration levels. Decision analysis advocates choosing that decision whose consequences have the maximum expected utility (or which maximize the probability of achieving the uncertain <b>aspiration</b> <b>level).</b> Such decision analytic methods are used {{in a wide variety of}} fields, including business (planning, marketing, negotiation), environmental remediation, health care, research, and management, energy, exploration, litigation and dispute resolution, etc.|$|E

The developed tool is used to analyse and solve a real-world problem defined in collaboration with a pottery company. The tool provides a valuable support in performing various what-if analyses, for example, how changes of batch sizes, <b>aspiration</b> <b>levels,</b> linguistic quantifiers and the measure of acceptable distances affect the final schedule...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} organizational performance on subsequent risk-taking behavior. More specifically, using a sample of 2892 European acquisitions, it is analyzed whether companies {{are more likely to}} conduct risky actions like acquisitions in times of bad organizational performance. Risk theory suggests that the risk-taking behavior of organizations is context-dependent, with a greater risk-appetite in times of failure than in times of success. Past performance is denoted successful whenever company specific <b>aspiration</b> <b>levels</b> were met. Consequently, it is hypothesized that the probability of a company to get actively involved in acquisitions decreases with increasing relative performance. The findings of the analysis support the hypothesized relationship. Organizations are sensitive to performance relative to <b>aspiration</b> <b>levels.</b> The better the performance relative to <b>aspiration</b> <b>levels</b> the lower the propensities to initiate acquisitions. Companies with experience from prior deals are {{more likely to engage in}} acquisitions and less sensitive to relative performance...|$|R

Also, it turns out that prior exposure to a symmetric market makes followers more aggressive which hints at the role of <b>aspiration</b> <b>levels</b> in markets. <b>aspiration</b> <b>levels...</b>|$|R
50|$|Thus, the {{capacity}} to aspire requires practice, and, as Chakravarti argues, when a capacity (or decision making process) is not refined through practice it falters and often fails. The unstable life of poverty often limits the poor's aspiration levels to those of necessity (such as having food to feed ones family) and in turn reinforces the lowered aspiration levels (someone who is busy studying, instead of {{looking for ways to}} get enough food, will not survive long in the poverty environment). Because {{the capacity}} to aspire (or lack thereof) reinforces and perpetuates the cycle of poverty, Appadurai claims that expanding the poor's aspiration horizon will help the poor to find both voice and exit. Ways of doing this include changing the terms of recognition (see previous section) and/or creating programs which provide the poor with an arena in which to practice capacities. An example of one such arena may be a housing development built for the poor, by the poor. Through this, the poor are able to not only show their abilities but to also gain practice dealing with governmental agencies and society at large. Through collaborative projects, the poor are able to expand their <b>aspiration</b> <b>level</b> above and beyond tomorrow's meal to the cultivation of skills and the entrance into the larger market.|$|E

Researchers often assume an <b>aspiration</b> <b>level</b> at zero, which helps to explain several empirical phenomena. In two experiments, we test this assumption. Our experimental design exploits the discontinuity in the utility function at the <b>aspiration</b> <b>level.</b> The lotteries vary in complexity {{in terms of the}} number of outcomes and the use of round or non-round probabilities. We do not find support for an <b>aspiration</b> <b>level</b> at zero, neither for simple lotteries nor for complex lotteries. Overall, our aggregate results are consistent with prospect theory, but can also be explained by a population with heterogeneous aspiration levels instead of a homogeneous <b>aspiration</b> <b>level</b> at zero...|$|E

Whereas an economy in which the investors have low <b>aspiration</b> <b>levels</b> exhibits constant prices and asset holdings, investors with high <b>aspiration</b> <b>levels</b> create cycles, which may be stochastic or deterministic.

40|$|The study {{presents}} {{a theory of}} utility models based on <b>aspiration</b> <b>levels,</b> {{as well as the}} application of this theory to the planning of timber flow economics. The first part of the study comprises a derivation of the utility-theoretic basis for the application of <b>aspiration</b> <b>levels.</b> Two basic models are dealt with: the additive and the multiplicative. Applied here solely for partial utility functions, <b>aspiration</b> and reservation <b>levels</b> are interpreted as defining piecewisely linear functions. The standpoint of the choices of the decision-maker is emphasized by the use of indifference curves. The second part of the study introduces a model for the management of timber flows. The model {{is based on the assumption}} that the decision-maker is willing to specify a shape of income flow which is different from that of the capital-theoretic optimum. The utility model comprises four aspiration-based compound utility functions. The theory and the flow model are tested numerically by computations covering three forest holdings. The results show that the additive model is sensitive even to slight changes in relative importances and <b>aspiration</b> <b>levels.</b> This applies particularly to nearly linear production possibility boundaries of monetary variables. The multiplicative model, on the other hand, is stable because it generates strictly convex indifference curves. Due to a higher marginal rate of substitution, the multiplicative model implies a stronger dependence on forest management than the additive function. For income trajectory optimization, a method utilizing an income trajectory index is more efficient than one based on the use of <b>aspiration</b> <b>levels</b> per management period. Smooth trajectories can be attained by squaring the deviations of the feasible trajectories from the desired one...|$|R

It turns out that if the <b>aspiration</b> <b>level</b> is given by the last payo of the current opponent the population receives the maximal sym-metric payo of the game in the long run. If the <b>aspiration</b> <b>level</b> is determined by independently chosen agents the outcome is related to the evolutionarily sta-ble strategies. This holds for win stay, lose shift as well as for imitation based learning. These results suggest that the choice of peers can be crucial for the eÆciency of learning...|$|E
40|$|When {{pursuing}} multiple goals over time, {{the amount}} of time (i. e., resources) available affects which goal is pursued: people prioritize (i. e., spend time on) the goal furthest from the <b>aspiration</b> <b>level</b> when there is plenty of time available to attain the <b>aspiration</b> <b>level</b> on the multiple goals but switch to prioritize the goal closest to the <b>aspiration</b> <b>level</b> when the time available starts to run out (e. g., Schmidt, Dolis, 2 ̆ 6 Tolli, 2009). Although the <b>aspiration</b> <b>level</b> is the most commonly examined goal level, other goal levels possessing different psychological meanings (e. g., minimally acceptable or status quo goal levels) also exist. I examined the effect of multiple goal levels (i. e., the minimally acceptable level and the <b>aspiration</b> <b>level)</b> on goal prioritization decisions. I hypothesized that when people were provided with both the minimally acceptable level and the <b>aspiration</b> <b>level,</b> they would prioritize attaining the minimally acceptable level over the <b>aspiration</b> <b>level.</b> Participants (N= 316) engaged in a fully within-persons decision-making task where they repeatedly decided which of two goals to allocate their time to. The amount of time available for allocation was systematically varied. Results indicated that people first strived for the minimally acceptable level on one goal. When they attained the minimally acceptable level on that goal, they switched to striving for the minimally acceptable level on the second goal. Only when people attained the minimally acceptable levels for both goals did they strive for the <b>aspiration</b> <b>level</b> (on one of the goals). The only exception is when they had insufficient time to attain both minimally acceptable goal levels; in that case, they focused only on one goal and strived for the <b>aspiration</b> <b>level</b> on that goal. Results imply that when choosing which goal to prioritize, people consider multiple goal levels.

30|$|These {{objective}} functions (supply chain {{cost and}} volume flexibility) and constraints {{are discussed in}} the ‘Methodology’ section. The supply chain model that is developed at strategic level with uncertainty in the objectives is taken care by specifying <b>aspiration</b> <b>levels</b> for the objectives. The decision-maker is able to specify the <b>aspiration</b> <b>levels</b> for each objective. Linear membership functions are defined for each objective depending on their nature. The nature may be approximately less than or equal or {{greater than or equal to}} the specified value. Considering the nature of the fuzzy parameters, linear membership functions of either non-increasing or non-decreasing are formulated. Membership function of total supply chain cost is assumed as non-increasing, and membership function of volume flexibility is assumed as non-decreasing.|$|R
