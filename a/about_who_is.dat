500|$|... "The Food Wife" [...] {{was written}} by {{executive}} producer of The Simpsons Matt Selman. The writing process began around September 2010. According to Selman, the episode mainly revolves around Homer and Marge competing <b>about</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> perceived as the most fun by Bart and Lisa, a situation that he thinks parents can identify with in real-life. The episode also focuses heavily on foodies and food blogs. Selman {{said in an interview}} with New York magazine's Grub Street publication that the foodie culture is [...] "just a world that I always thought was funny and fascinating. The idea of food as not only something you enjoy eating, but as something that you are so passionate about that you're kind of bragging about it. 'I'm the one who discovered this particular Korean pork-neck soup restaurant,' and you can kind of claim that as yours. The blogging just feeds into that kind of territorial element that I always thought was inherently funny. And when I write Simpsons episodes, I try to start with a world I think is funny, and think, 'What's a good story we can tell in that world, using the characters that we have?'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Expectation states theory {{proposes that}} {{individuals}} use available social information to form expectations of competence {{for themselves and}} others. This is thought to help coordinate group members' efforts so that goals can be more easily achieved. One's rank in a group hierarchy is based on status characteristics (race, gender, age, specific abilities, etc.) and dominance behaviors (interruptions, eye contact, rate of speech, etc.). While exhibiting dominant behavior or being of a certain race, for instance, has no direct connection to actual ability, implicit beliefs <b>about</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> relatively better or worse drive group members to [...] "act as if" [...] they believe some people are better than others.
