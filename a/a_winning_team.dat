5|$|Failing to {{turn the}} Braves into <b>a</b> <b>winning</b> <b>team,</b> Bancroft {{requested}} his release from the team after the 1927 season. He signed with the Brooklyn Robins the same day. Stating that {{he was happy to}} no longer have the stress of managing, he played for the Robins for the 1928 and 1929 seasons. During his time with the Robins, he was seen as a possible successor to manager Wilbert Robinson.|$|E
5|$|Following the tie to the Mark Greys, the Panhandles {{traveled}} to Lorain, Ohio, {{to play against}} the Elyria Athletics on Thanksgiving Day. The result of the game was another 0–0 tie, making it the seventh time in nine games the Panhandles were held scoreless. Chris Willis stated this tie was {{not as bad as}} the previous weeks because the Athletics had old players from the Akron Indians, <b>a</b> <b>winning</b> <b>team</b> in the Ohio League.|$|E
5|$|Four days later, on 25 January, it was {{announced}} that the Grizzlies was sold to Chicago-based Michael Heisley for US$160million.

5|$|Although Ruppert and his co-owner, Colonel Tillinghast Huston, {{were both}} wealthy, and had aggressively {{purchased}} and traded for players in 1918 and 1919 to build <b>a</b> <b>winning</b> <b>team,</b> Ruppert faced losses in his brewing interests as Prohibition was implemented, {{and if their}} team left the Polo Grounds, where the Yankees were the tenants of the New York Giants, building a stadium in New York would be expensive. Nevertheless, when Frazee, who moved in the same social circles as Huston, hinted to the colonel that Ruth was available for the right price, the Yankees owners quickly pursued the purchase.|$|E
5|$|As a scout for the Houston Astros, Hal Newhouser {{evaluated}} Jeter extensively {{before the}} 1992 MLB draft. The Astros held the first overall {{pick in the}} draft, and Newhouser, convinced that Jeter would anchor <b>a</b> <b>winning</b> <b>team,</b> lobbied team management to select him. The Astros feared that Jeter would insist on a salary bonus of at least $1million to forgo his college scholarship for a professional contract, so they passed on him, instead choosing Cal State Fullerton outfielder Phil Nevin, who signed with Houston for $700,000. Newhouser felt so strongly about Jeter's potential that he quit his job with the Astros in protest after they ignored his drafting advice.|$|E
5|$|Culverhouse was {{initially}} lauded for bringing professional football to the Tampa Bay area, but eventually {{came to be}} blamed for the team's struggles. His refusal to pay Doug Williams at a salary level {{comparable to that of}} the league's top quarterbacks insulted fans, and was seen as the beginning of the team's decline during the 1980s. It further led to the belief that Culverhouse was unconcerned with fielding <b>a</b> <b>winning</b> <b>team,</b> {{as long as it was}} financially profitable. The Buccaneers' NFL-record streak of fourteen consecutive losing seasons cemented this perception, although Culverhouse did make several notable attempts to improve the team.|$|E

5|$|Handley {{served as}} coach for two mediocre seasons (1991–92), {{in which the}} Giants went from Super Bowl champions to a 6–10 record. He was fired {{following}} the 1992 season and replaced by former Denver Broncos coach Dan Reeves. In the early 1990s, Simms and Taylor played out {{the last years of}} their career with steadily declining production. In 1993, however, the Giants experienced a resurgent season with Reeves at the helm, and Simms and Taylor ended their careers as members of <b>a</b> <b>winning</b> <b>team.</b>|$|E
5|$|Under {{new head}} coach Jim Caldwell, Manning started the 2009 {{season with a}} victory by {{throwing}} for 301 yards. In Week 2, Manning led his 29th fourth quarter comeback (38th game-winning drive) by throwing for 303 yards and two touchdown passes, despite only having the ball for 14:53, the lowest time of possession for <b>a</b> <b>winning</b> <b>team</b> in the NFL since they began tracking the statistic in 1977. Manning was named AFC Offensive Player of the Month {{for the fourth time}} in his career in September. Against the Seattle Seahawks Manning passed for 353 yards and two touchdowns for his fourth consecutive 300-yard passing game set a new franchise record.|$|E
5|$|Villa {{were back}} among the elite as Saunders {{continued}} to mould <b>a</b> <b>winning</b> <b>team.</b> This {{culminated in a}} seventh top-flight league title in 1980–81. To the surprise of commentators and fans, Saunders quit halfway through the 1981–82 season, after falling out with the chairman, with Villa in the quarter final of the European Cup. He was replaced by his softly-spoken assistant manager Tony Barton who guided the club to a 1–0 victory over Bayern Munich in the European Cup final in Rotterdam courtesy of a Peter Withe goal. The following season Villa were crowned European Super Cup winners, beating Barcelona in the final. This marked a pinnacle though and Villa's fortunes declined sharply {{for most of the}} 1980s, culminating in relegation in 1987. This was followed by promotion the following year under Graham Taylor and a runners-up position in the First Division in the 1989–90 season.|$|E

5|$|At the World Cup {{he played}} all three group games against Uruguay, Mexico and France, however in the win against France midfielder Joseph Bonnel racked his studs down Greaves' shin, causing a wound that {{required}} 14 stitches {{and left a}} permanent scar. His replacement, Geoff Hurst, scored the winner in the quarter-final against Argentina and kept his place {{all the way to}} the final, where Hurst scored a hat-trick as England won the tournament. Greaves was fit to play in the final, but manager Alf Ramsey opted against changing <b>a</b> <b>winning</b> <b>team.</b> Only the 11 players on the pitch at the end of the 4–2 win over West Germany received medals. Following a Football Association-led campaign to persuade FIFA to award medals to all the winners' squad members, Greaves was presented with his medal by Gordon Brown at a ceremony at 10 Downing Street on 10 June 2009. In November 2014, Greaves' medal was sold at auction for £44,000.|$|E
5|$|The Houston Astros chose Nevin {{with the}} first overall pick in the 1992 Major League Baseball draft. Hal Newhouser, a scout for the Astros, had {{evaluated}} Derek Jeter extensively prior to the draft. Convinced that Jeter would anchor <b>a</b> <b>winning</b> <b>team,</b> Newhouser lobbied team management to select Jeter, and quit in protest over the Astros' decision to take Nevin instead. The Astros believed that Jeter would insist on a salary bonus of at least $1million to forgo his college scholarship for a professional contract. Signing bonuses given to {{the best player in}} the draft were increasing rapidly. Todd Van Poppel, regarded by many at the time the first pick of the 1990 MLB draft, signed for $1.2 million, while the 1991 MLB draft's first pick, Brien Taylor, signed for $1.55 million after insisting he would otherwise enroll in college. Meanwhile, the Astros were unable to sign their first-round draft pick in 1991, John Burke, who insisted on a bonus of $500,000 as the sixth overall selection. Consequently, the Astros passed on Jeter in the draft.|$|E
