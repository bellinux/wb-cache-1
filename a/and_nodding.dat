40|$|SummaryThe cytosolic sensors <b>Nod</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Nod</b> 2 <b>and</b> Toll-like receptors (TLRs) {{activate}} defense signaling pathways {{in response}} to microbial stimuli. However, the role of <b>Nod</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Nod</b> 2 <b>and</b> their interplay with TLRs during systemic bacterial infection remains poorly understood. Here, we report that macrophages or mice made insensitive to TLRs by previous exposure to microbial ligands remained responsive to <b>Nod</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Nod</b> 2 stimulation. Furthermore, <b>Nod</b> 1 - <b>and</b> <b>Nod</b> 2 -mediated signaling and gene expression are enhanced in TLR-tolerant macrophages. Further analyses revealed that innate immune responses induced by bacterial infection relied on <b>Nod</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Nod</b> 2 <b>and</b> their adaptor RICK in macrophages pretreated with TLR ligands but not in naive macrophages. In addition, bacterial clearance upon systemic infection with L.  monocytogenes was critically dependent on <b>Nod</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Nod</b> 2 when mice were previously stimulated with lipopolysaccharide or E. coli. Thus, <b>Nod</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Nod</b> 2 are important for microbial recognition and host defense after TLR stimulation...|$|R

40|$|Southern {{hybridization}} with nif (nitrogen fixation) <b>and</b> <b>nod</b> (nodulation) DNA probes from Rhizobium meliloti against intact plasmid DNA of Rhizobium japonicum and Bradyrhizobium japonicum strains {{indicated that}} both nif <b>and</b> <b>nod</b> sequences are on plasmid DNA in most R. japonicum strains. An exception is found with R. japonicum strain USDA 194 and all B. japonicum strains where nif <b>and</b> <b>nod</b> sequences {{are on the}} chromosome. In R. japonicum strains, {{with the exception of}} strain USDA 205, both nif <b>and</b> <b>nod</b> sequences are on the same plasmid. In strain USDA 205, the nif genes are on a 112 -megadalton plasmid, <b>and</b> <b>nod</b> genes are on a 195 -megadalton plasmid. Hybridization to EcoRI digests of total DNA to nif <b>and</b> <b>nod</b> probes from R. meliloti show that the nif <b>and</b> <b>nod</b> sequences are conserved in both R. japonicum and B. japonicum strains regardless of the plasmid or chromosomal location of these genes. In addition, nif DNA hybridization patterns were identical among all R. japonicum strains and with most of the B. japonicum strains examined. Similarly, many of the bands that hybridize to the nodulation probe isolated from R. meliloti were found to be common among R. japonicum strains. Under reduced hybridization stringency conditions, strong conservation of nodulation sequences was observed in strains of B. japonicum. We have also found that the plasmid pRjaUSDA 193, which possess nif <b>and</b> <b>nod</b> sequences, does not possess sequence homology with any plasmid of USDA 194, but is homologous to parts of the chromosome of USDA 194. Strain USDA 194 is unique, since nif <b>and</b> <b>nod</b> sequences are present on the chromosome instead of on a plasmid as observed with all other strains examined...|$|R

40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} {{mononuclear cell}} expression {{and function of}} the cytosolic nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing receptors, <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2, in very preterm and full-term infants. Methods: <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 gene <b>and</b> protein expression in very preterm infants, term infants and healthy adult, cord and {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (C/PBMC) were quantified using qPCR and flow cytometry. Cytokine responses of purified infant and adult monocytes to <b>NOD</b> 1 - <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 -specific agonists were assessed using a multiplex immunoassay (Bioplex). Results: <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 were expressed by a range of infant and adult mononuclear cell types, including T- and B cells, with highest expression in classical (CD 14 ++CD 16 -) and intermediate (CD 14 ++CD 16 +) monocytes. <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 expression levels by monocytes from very preterm infant were similar to those in term infants or adults. Monocyte production of TNFα, IL- 6 and IL- 1 β induced by activation of <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 was similar between very preterm infants, term infants and adults. Conclusion: Monocyte expression <b>and</b> function of <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 in very preterm infants are intact and comparable/equivalent to term infants and adults. Functional deficiencies in monocyte NOD signalling pathways are unlikely to contribute to the increased susceptibility to bacterial sepsis in preterm infants...|$|R

40|$|<b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 (nucleotide-binding {{oligomerization}} domain-containing proteins 1 and 2) {{are related}} innate immune receptors responsible for initiating {{a response to}} bacterial infection. They belong to a class of receptors known as Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs), which are germline encoded immune receptors that mediate various innate immune responses. These receptors recognize conserved microbial motifs known as Pathogen-Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs). The PRR-PAMP paradigm forms the bedrock of how innate immunity is understood today. As two of the first intracellular PRRs discovered, <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 came to define an entire subclass of PRRs, the NOD-like receptors (NLRs). PRRs relay their signals through protein:protein interaction motifs that typically adopt a characteristic Death Domain (DD) fold. <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 signal through their respective CAspase Recruitment Domains (CARDs), which {{are part of a}} DD subfamily. The CARDs of <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 interact with multiple downstream effectors and are thus situated at a key point for regulation <b>and</b> coordination of <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 signaling. To better understand this regulation, I structurally and functionally characterized interactions made by the CARDs of <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2. Receptor Interacting Protein kinase 2 (RIP 2) is an effector of both <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 that activates the NF-ΚB pathway to elicit an inflammatory response. I discovered a new binding interaction between the CARDs of <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 <b>and</b> ubiquitin. Furthermore, I elucidated a role for this interaction by showing that ubiquitin binds <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 CARDs competitively with the CARD of RIP 2. Through biophysical and biochemical investigation, I identified mutants of NOD 1 CARD that did not bind ubiquitin and were thus insensitive to its competitive effect on RIP 2 binding. Utilizing this mutant in functional studies defined ubiquitin as a negative regulator of NOD 1 signaling. Characterizing NOD 1 allowed rational design of mutations that uncovered a similar role for ubiquitin in the NOD 2 pathway. This introduces the potential for broader application of these findings in other DD-mediated pathways. <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 also bind the autophagy protein ATG 16 L. I investigated the molecular mechanisms of this interaction <b>and</b> found that <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 bind ATG 16 L through their CARDs. I also found that the domain on ATG 16 L responsible for binding <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 is the C-terminal WD 40 Β-propeller. Furthermore, the CARD:Β-propeller interaction is sufficient to mediate interaction between NOD 1 or <b>NOD</b> 2 <b>and</b> ATG 16 L. The finding that the ATG 16 L Β-propeller also binds ubiquitin leaves open the possibility that ubiquitin regulates pathway selection by <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2. Together, these studies advance our understanding of <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 signaling <b>and</b> lay the groundwork for further mechanistic investigations into coordination of inflammatory and autophagic signaling pathways by the immune system in general...|$|R

Several routes for the entry of peptidoglycan ligands to the host cytosol to trigger activation of <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 have been elucidated.

40|$|Fulltext embargoed for: 12 months post date of publicationPreterm birth {{remains one}} of the most {{important}} issues facing perinatal medicine today, with chronic inflammation and/or infection being the biggest etiological factor. The nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD) intracellular molecules recognize a wide range of microbial products as well as other intracellular danger signals, thereby initiating inflammation through activation of nuclear factor KB (NFKB), a central regulator of the terminal processes of human labor and delivery. The aims of this study were to determine the effect of 1) human labor, proinflammatory cytokines, and bacterial endotoxin LPS on <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 expression <b>and</b> 2) <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 activation on the expression of prolabor mediators in human fetal membranes <b>and</b> myometrium. <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 expression was significantly higher in fetal membranes and myometrium after spontaneous labor when compared to nonlaboring tissues. Bacterial endotoxin LPS and the proinflammatory cytokines TNF and IL 1 B significantly increased NOD 2, but not NOD 1, expression. Furthermore, LPS-induced NOD 2 expression was decreased by the NFKB inhibitor BAY 11 - 7082. In both fetal membranes <b>and</b> myometrium, the <b>NOD</b> 1 ligand bacterial iE-DAP <b>and</b> the <b>NOD</b> 2 ligand bacterial MDP significantly increased the expression and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (IL 6 and IL 8), cyclooxygenase (PTGS 2) expression and subsequent release of prostaglandins PGE 2 and PGF 2 alpha, and the expression and activity of MMP 9. The effects of these <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 ligands were mediated via NFKB, as 1) both iE-DAP and MDP significantly increased NFKB activation and 2) the NFKB inhibitor BAY 11 - 7082 attenuated iE-DAP- and MDP-induced expression and secretion of prolabor mediators. In conclusion, <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 are increased in laboring fetal membranes and myometrium and with bacterial infection. Agonist activation of <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 by bacterial products leads to NFKB activation and transcription of NFKB induced prolabor genes. <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 may thus represent therapeutic targets for the treatment and/or management of preterm birth.
