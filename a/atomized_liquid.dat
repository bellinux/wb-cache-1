2500|$|In {{addition}} {{to the use of}} intercoolers, it is common practice to add extra fuel to the intake air (known as [...] "running an engine rich") {{for the sole purpose of}} cooling. The amount of extra fuel varies, but typically reduces the air-fuel ratio to between 11 and 13, instead of the stoichiometric 14.7 (in petrol engines). The extra fuel is not burned (as there is insufficient oxygen to complete the chemical reaction), instead it undergoes a phase change from <b>atomized</b> (<b>liquid)</b> to gas. This phase change absorbs heat, and the added mass of the extra fuel reduces the average thermal energy of the charge and exhaust gas.

50|$|Industrial scale {{spray drying}} {{has been around}} since {{the second half of the}} nineteenth century. It can only be used to dry liquids, as they are sprayed into hot air of up to 575 °F.

50|$|The valveless pulsejet {{operates}} {{on the same}} principle as the valved pulsejet, but the 'valve' is the engine's geometry. Fuel, as a gas or <b>atomized</b> <b>liquid</b> spray, is either mixed with {{the air in the}} intake or directly injected into the combustion chamber. Starting the engine usually requires forced air and an ignition source, such as a spark plug, for the fuel-air mix. With modern manufactured engine designs, almost any design can be made to be self-starting by providing the engine with fuel and an ignition spark, starting the engine with no compressed air. Once running, the engine only requires input of fuel to maintain a self-sustaining combustion cycle.|$|E

The importance of droplet size was not yet understood, so the efficacy of this first device was unfortunately mediocre for many of the medical compounds. The Siegle steam spray inhaler consisted of a spirit burner, which boiled water in the reservoir into steam that could then flow across the top and into a tube suspended in the pharmaceutical solution. The passage of steam drew the medicine into the vapor, and the patient inhaled this vapor through a mouthpiece made of glass.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The maximum entropy {{principle}} (MEP), {{which has}} been popular in the modeling of droplet size and velocity distribution in sprays, is, strictly speaking, only applicable for isolated systems in thermodynamic equilibrium; whereas the spray formation processes are irreversible and non-isolated with interaction between the <b>atomizing</b> <b>liquid</b> and its surrounding gas medium. In this study, a new model for the droplet size distribution has been developed based on the thermodynamically consistent concept - the maximization of entropy generation during the liquid atomization process. The model prediction compares favorably with the experimentally measured size distribution for droplets, near the liquid bulk breakup region, produced by an air-blast annular nozzle and a practical gas turbine nozzle. Therefore, the present model {{can be used to}} predict the initial droplet size distribution in sprays...|$|R

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} determine the feasibility of using the technique of ultrasonic nebulization of water into the anode gas stream for evaporative cooling of a Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cell. The basic concept of this form of internal evaporative cooling of the PEM fuel cell is to introduce finely <b>atomized</b> <b>liquid</b> water into the anode gas stream, so that the finely <b>atomized</b> <b>liquid</b> water adsorbs onto the anode and then moves to the cathode via electro-osmotic drag, where this water then evaporates into the relatively dry cathode gas stream, carrying with it the waste thermal energy generated within the fuel cell. The thermal and electrical performance of a 50 cm 2 PEM fuel cell utilizing this technique was compared to the performance obtained with conventional water management. Both techniques were compared over a range of humidification chamber temperatures for both the anode and cathode gas streams so as to determine the robustness of the proposed method. The proposed method produced only meager levels of evaporative cooling (at best 2 watts, for which a minimum of 30 watts was required for adequate cooling), but the average cell voltage increased considerably (as much as a 10 % gain), and the technique increased the fault tolerance of the fuel cell (the Nafion?? membrane did not dry out even if cell temperature went well in excess of 70 ?? C despite both anode and cathode humidification temperatures of 55 ?? C). An interesting phenomena was also observed wherein the fuel cell voltage oscillated regularly with a period of tens of seconds, and that the amplitude of this oscillation corresponded inversely {{with the level of}} humidification received by the fuel cell...|$|E

40|$|A new {{approach}} to account for finite thermal conductivity and turbulence effects within <b>atomizing</b> <b>liquid</b> sprays is presented in this paper. The model {{is an extension of}} the T-blob and T-TAB atomization/spray model of Trinh and Chen (2005). This finite conductivity model is based on the two-temperature film theory, where the turbulence characteristics of the droplet are used to estimate the effective thermal diffhsivity within the droplet phase. Both one-way and two-way coupled calculations were performed to investigate the performance of this model. The current evaporation model is incorporated into the T-blob atomization model of Trinh and Chen (2005) and implemented in an existing CFD Eulerian-Lagrangian two-way coupling numerical scheme. Validation studies were carried out by comparing with available evaporating atomization spray experimental data in terms of jet penetration, temperature field, and droplet SMD distribution within the spray.

40|$|An {{experimental}} study on liquid mass distribution in effervescent sprays using water and air as working fluids {{is presented in}} this paper. Optical patternation and techniques of image processing are employed for analyzing the spray. The flow regime inside the effervescent atomizer largely dictates the mass distribution patterns. The patterns are seen to vary from concentrated, poorly <b>atomized</b> <b>liquid</b> lumps to uniformly distributed, fine droplets as the flow regime changes from bubbly flow to annular flow. A large variety of instantaneous spray patterns are observed in bubbly flow regime indicating a highly unsteady atomization process. However, relatively better consistency in spray patterns is observed at higher gas flow rates. Thus, the degree of unsteadiness gradually diminishes as gas flow rate is increased. The axial evolution of the spray in annular mode shows good mixing of liquid and gas across the interface...|$|E
