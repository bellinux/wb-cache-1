5|$|Piaget {{concluded}} that some infants {{are too young}} to understand object permanence, which explains why they do not cry when their mothers are gone ("out of sight, out of mind"). A lack of object permanence can lead to A-not-B errors, where children reach for a thing at <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> should not be. Older infants are less likely to make the A-not-B error because they are able to understand the concept of object permanence more than younger infants. However, researchers have found that A-not-B errors do not always show up consistently. They {{concluded that}} this type of error might be due to a failure in memory or the fact that infants usually tend to repeat a previous motor behavior.|$|E
5|$|Seeing all the singers, {{you really}} {{come face to}} face with a lot of people that are {{predominantly}} younger. That's inspiring, because they come up to you and they're such big fans and they share with you what song touched them the most and how they had to learn every single ad lib and dissect it. As a vocalist it brought me back to, 'Yeah, that's what I used to do to my Whitney Houston record and my Mariah Carey record and my Etta James record.' It brings you back to <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> becomes your personal responsibility to infuse the next generation with more information about learning every intricate note. That's why a song called 'Sing for Me' is a special song. It's one of those singer's songs where if you're not a vocalist you can't mess with that song.|$|E
5|$|The lower {{respiratory}} tract {{is part of the}} respiratory system, and consists of the trachea and the structures below this including the lungs. The trachea receives air from the pharynx and travels down to <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> splits (the carina) into a right and left bronchus. These supply air to the right and left lungs, splitting progressively into the secondary and tertiary bronchi for the lobes of the lungs, and into smaller and smaller bronchioles until they become the respiratory bronchioles. These in turn supply air through alveolar ducts into the alveoli, where the exchange of gases take place. Oxygen breathed in, diffuses through the walls of the alveoli into the enveloping capillaries and into the circulation, and carbon dioxide diffuses from the blood into the lungs to be breathed out.|$|E

25|$|Trivial names often {{arise in}} the common language; they may come from {{historic}} usages in, for example, alchemy. Many trivial names pre-date the institution of formal naming conventions.

25|$|The Moldavians' (as well as Wallachians') {{favourite}} {{military doctrine}} in (defensive) wars was a scorched earth policy combined with harassment of the advancing enemy using hit-and-run tactics and disruption {{of communication and}} supply lines, followed by a large scale ambush: a weakened enemy would be lured in <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> would find itself in a position hard or impossible to defend. A general attack would follow, often with devastating results. The shattered remains {{of what was once}} the enemy army would be pursued closely and harassed {{all the way to the}} border and sometimes beyond. A typical example of successful employments of this scenario is the Battle of Vaslui.|$|E

25|$|Containers are {{intended}} to be used constantly, being loaded with new cargo for a new destination soon after having been emptied of previous cargo. This is not always possible, and in some cases, the cost of transporting an empty container to <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> can be used {{is considered to be}} higher than the worth of the used container. Shipping lines and container leasing companies have become expert at repositioning empty containers from areas of low or no demand, such as the US West Coast, to areas of high demand, such as China. Repositioning within the port hinterland has also been the focus of recent logistics optimization work. However, damaged or retired containers may also be recycled in the form of shipping container architecture, or the steel content salvaged. In the summer of 2010, a worldwide shortage of containers developed as shipping increased after the recession, while new container production had largely ceased.|$|E
25|$|The {{investigators}} were thus able {{to recreate the}} bombers activities. Amrozi, Idris and Ali Imron had simply walked into a dealership and purchased a new Yamaha motorbike, after asking how much they could re-sell it for if they returned it in a few days. Imron used the motorbike to plant the small bomb outside the U.S. Consulate. Idris then rode the motorbike as Imron drove two suicide bombers in the Mitsubishi to the nightclub district in Kuta. He stopped near the Sari Club, instructed one suicide bomber {{to put on his}} explosives vest and the other to arm the vehicle bomb. The first bomber headed to Paddy's Pub. Idris then left the second bomber, who had only learned to drive in a straight line, to drive the minivan the short distance to the Sari Club. Idris picked up Imron on the Yamaha and the duo headed back into Denpasar. Idris dialed the number of the Nokia to detonate the bomb at the Consulate. The two suicide bombers exploded their devices. Imron and Idris dropped the motorbike at <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> eventually attracted the attention of the caretaker.|$|E
25|$|The {{plans and}} {{designs for the}} new {{cemetery}} were drawn up by the Commission's architect, Barry Edwards. One of the immediate problems faced was deciding on a suitable location. The original location of the mass graves was considered as a site for the cemetery (and was offered as such by the landowner), but the ground {{was found to be}} too prone to flooding. The site that was chosen was nearby, about 120metres to the southwest of the original battlefield mass graves, but on a higher piece of land just outside the village of Fromelles. The overall cemetery shape is hexagonal, and the design incorporated radial rows of headstones leading towards a raised Cross of Sacrifice on the southern side of the cemetery. This higher location for the cemetery allowed the deliberate placement of the Cross of Sacrifice at <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> would be visible on the skyline when viewed from the nearby V.C. Corner Australian Cemetery and Memorial. This memorial is one of several locations in and around Fromelles where those who fell in the battle are commemorated. The Fromelles battlefield of 1916 would also be visible from the elevated Cross of Sacrifice terrace. Another consideration in the design was the cemetery orientation, with the headstones orientated to the south to avoid shadows and to increase the daytime visibility of the headstone inscriptions. The exact layout of the burial plots was left flexible as the number of burials needed was not known at that point. A small car park was included in the design. Unlike earlier CWGC cemeteries, this modern cemetery was designed to include ramps to allow accessibility for wheelchair users.|$|E

500|$|In mid-June General Howe marched most of {{his army}} into central New Jersey {{in an attempt to}} lure George Washington's Continental Army to <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> might be better {{attacked}} than its defensive position in the Watchung Mountains. [...] When Washington refused to abandon his position Howe returned to Amboy on June22. [...] Washington's forward divisions, including that of Lord Stirling, shadowed this British movement, and Washington moved his main army out of the hills. [...] Howe seized this opportunity, and on June26 marched two columns of troops out in an attempt to cut Washington off from the high ground. [...] These troops skirmished with Lord Stirling's troops, and eventually engaged in a pitched battle in Scotch Plains. [...] Stirling's outnumbered force retreated, but Washington, alerted to the British movement, had by then retreated back into the hills.|$|E
500|$|James Longstreet {{suffered}} most severely {{from the}} wrath of the Lost Cause authors, not the least because he directly criticized Lee in postbellum writings and became a Republican after the war. His critics accuse him of attacking much later than Lee intended on July 2, squandering a chance to hit the Union Army before its defensive positions had firmed up. They also question his lack of motivation to attack strongly on July 2 and 3 because he had argued that the army should have maneuvered to <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> would force Meade to attack them. The alternative view is that Lee was in close contact with Longstreet during the battle, agreed to delays on the morning of July 2, and never criticized Longstreet's performance. (There is also considerable speculation about what an attack might have looked like before Dan Sickles moved the III Corps toward the Peach Orchard.) ...|$|E
500|$|During this period, Beauregard {{promoted}} innovative naval defense strategies, such {{as early}} experimentation with submarines, naval mines (called [...] "torpedoes" [...] in the Civil War), {{and with a}} small vessel called a torpedo-ram. A swift boat fitted with a torpedo on a pole projecting from its bow under water, {{it could be used}} to surprise an enemy vessel and impale it underneath the water line. He was also busy devising strategies for other generals in the Confederacy. He proposed that some of the state governors meet with Union governors of the Western states (what are called the Midwest states today) for a peace conference. The Davis administration rejected the idea, but it caused considerable political maneuvering by Davis's enemies in the Congress. Beauregard also proposed a grand strategy—submitted anonymously through his political allies so that it was not tainted by his reputation—to reinforce the Western armies at the expense of Robert E. Lee's army in Virginia, destroy the Federal army in Tennessee, which would induce Ulysses S. Grant to relieve pressure on Vicksburg and maneuver his army into <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> could be destroyed. The Confederate Army would continue to Ohio, and induce the Western states to ally with the Confederacy. Meanwhile, a fleet of torpedo-rams built in England could be used to recapture New Orleans, ending the war. There is no record that his plan was ever officially presented to the government.|$|E

[...] As can be seen, while the tradition of the Rabbinic period began with providing legal definition for the practice of polygamy (although this does not indicate the frequency with which polygamy in fact occurred) that corresponded to precedents in the tanakh, {{by the time of the}} Codices the Rabbis had greatly reduced or eliminated sanction of the practice.|$|E
