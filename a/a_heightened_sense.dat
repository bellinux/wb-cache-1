5|$|Tyrannosaurus {{had very}} large {{olfactory}} bulbs and olfactory nerves {{relative to their}} brain size, the organs responsible for <b>a</b> <b>heightened</b> <b>sense</b> of smell. This suggests that the sense of smell was highly developed, and implies that tyrannosaurs could detect carcasses by scent alone across great distances. The sense of smell in tyrannosaurs may have been comparable to modern vultures, which use scent to track carcasses for scavenging. Research on the olfactory bulbs has shown that Tyrannosaurus rex had the most highly developed sense of smell of 21 sampled non-avian dinosaur species.|$|E

Boogie Nights and Magnolia were noted for their large ensemble casts, which Anderson returned to in Inherent Vice. In Punch-Drunk Love, Anderson explored similar themes but expressed a different visual style, shedding the influences and references of his earlier films, being more surreal and having <b>a</b> <b>heightened</b> <b>sense</b> of reality. It was also short, compared to his previous two films, at 90 minutes.|$|E

5|$|The {{paintings}} {{of the first generation}} of Netherlandish artists are often characterised by the use of symbolism and biblical references. Van Eyck pioneered, and his innovations were taken up and developed by van der Weyden, Memling and Christus. Each employed rich and complex iconographical elements to create <b>a</b> <b>heightened</b> <b>sense</b> of contemporary beliefs and spiritual ideals. Morally the works express a fearful outlook, combined with a respect for restraint and stoicism. The paintings above all emphasise the spiritual over the earthly. Because the cult of Mary was at an apex at the time, iconographic elements related to the Life of Mary vastly predominate.|$|E

25|$|The {{main effect}} of {{suspension}} bondage is to create <b>a</b> <b>heightened</b> <b>sense</b> of vulnerability and inescapability, as the subject is made to feel that by attempting to free themselves they may fall and hurt themselves, thus also creating a form of mental bondage {{in addition to the}} physical one that holds them. Being suspended, especially in a large open space, also creates a sense of objectification, submissiveness and erotic helplessness for the subject, which can be erotically stimulating for them and for those observing them. Rope suspension is sometimes done as performance art at BDSM conventions and fetish-themed nightclubs.|$|E

5000|$|Murmuring Judges takes a three-tiered view of {{a single}} {{instance}} of British [...] "justice": the trial, conviction and appeal process of a dubiously guilty accomplice to a theft and kidnapping attack. The case is examined {{from the point of}} view of the police, the lawyers and the judges, as well as from inside the prison system. In each level, the injustices and insensitivities of the current system are highlighted as they are embodied by older proponents who cannot see past the traditions of British [...] "justice". Contextually, the play also underlines problems that the system were facing in the late 80's, early 90's, such as a rise in immigration and <b>a</b> <b>heightening</b> <b>sense</b> of terror, such as the IRA. The play is not entirely bleak as it also showcases the possibility for change through the younger professionals both in the police force and in the legal profession. The overall message is not hopeful - an innocent man, Gerard, remains in prison with his life ravaged by despair and sexual assault. The pessimism is slightly relieved by the final image of the play, two young women, a barrister, Irina and a police officer, Sandra, who set to work on the arduous task of revolutionising the system.|$|R
25|$|In most cases, {{the first}} symptom of {{narcolepsy}} to appear is excessive and overwhelming daytime sleepiness. The other symptoms may begin {{alone or in}} combination months or years after {{the onset of the}} daytime naps. There are wide variations in the development, severity, and order of appearance of cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and hypnagogic hallucinations in individuals. Only about 20 to 25 percent of people with narcolepsy experience all four symptoms. The excessive daytime sleepiness generally persists throughout life, but sleep paralysis and hypnagogic hallucinations may not. A rare subset of narcoleptics also experience <b>a</b> <b>heightened</b> <b>sense</b> of taste and smell known as the supertaster phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|In pre-modern {{societies}}, it was {{the elders}} who possessed the knowledge: they were definable in time and space. In modern societies we must rely on expert systems. These are not present in time and space, but we must trust them. Even if we trust them, we know that something could go wrong: there's always a risk we have to take. Also the technologies which we use, and which transform constraints into means, hold risks. Consequently, there is always <b>a</b> <b>heightened</b> <b>sense</b> of uncertainty in contemporary societies.

50|$|Olfactory {{problems}} {{can be divided into}} different types based on their malfunction. The olfactory dysfunction can be total (anosmia), incomplete (partial anosmia, hyposmia, or microsmia), distorted (dysosmia), or can be characterized by spontaneous sensations like phantosmia. An inability to recognize odors despite a normally functioning olfactory system is termed olfactory agnosia. Hyperosmia is a rare condition typified by <b>an</b> abnormally <b>heightened</b> <b>sense</b> of smell. Like vision and hearing, the olfactory {{problems can}} be bilateral or unilateral meaning if a person has anosmia {{on the right side of}} the nose but not the left, it is a unilateral right anosmia.

In the dynamic cover system, players crouch behind obstacles to gain a tactical advantage during combat. The game features periods without combat, often involving conversation between the characters. Players solve simple puzzles, such as using floating pallets to move Ellie, who is unable to swim, across bodies of water, and using ladders or dumpsters to reach higher areas. Story collectibles, such as notes, maps and comics, can be scavenged and viewed in the backpack menu.|$|E

40|$|Background: In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} a growth in {{leadership}} development frameworks in health for the existing workforce. There has also been a related abundance of leadership programmes developed specifically for qualified nurses. There is a groundswell of opinion that clinical leadership preparation needs to extend to preparatory programmes leading to registration as a nurse. To this end a doctoral research study has been completed that focused specifically on the identification and verification of the antecedents of clinical leadership (leadership and management) so they can shape the curriculum content {{and the best way to}} deliver the curriculum content as a curriculum thread. Objectives: To conceptualise how the curriculum content, identified and verified empirically, can be structured within a curriculum thread and to contribute to the discussion on effective pedagogical approaches and educational strategies for learning and teaching of clinical leadership. Design: A multi-method design was utilised in the research in Australia. Drawing on core principles in critical social theory, an integral curriculum thread is proposed for pre-registration nursing programmes that identifies the antecedents of clinical leadership; the core concepts, together with the continuum of enlightenment, empowerment, and emancipation. Conclusions: The curriculum content, the effective pedagogical approaches and the educational strategies are supported theoretically and we believe this offers a design template for action and a way of thinking about this important aspect of preparatory nursing education. Moreover, we hope to have created a process contributing to <b>a</b> <b>heighten</b> <b>sense</b> of awareness in the nursing student (and other key stakeholders) of the what, how and when of clinical leadership for a novice registered nurse. The next stage is to further test through research the proposed integral curriculum thread...|$|R

40|$|Both {{situational}} (e. g., perceived power) {{and sustained}} social factors (e. g., cultural stereotypes) {{are known to}} affect how people academically perform, particularly {{in the domain of}} mathematics. The ability to compute even simple mathematics, such as addition, relies on distinct neural circuitry within the inferior parietal and inferior frontal lobes, brain regions where magnitude representation and addition are performed. Despite prior behavioral evidence of social influence on academic performance, little is known about whether or not temporarily <b>heightening</b> <b>a</b> person’s <b>sense</b> of power may influence the neural bases of math calculation. Here we primed female participants with either high or low power and then measured neural response while they performed exact and approximate math problems. We found that priming power affected math performance; specifically, females primed with high power performed better on approximate math calculation compared to females primed with low power. Furthermore, neural response within the left inferior frontal gyrus, a region previously associated with cognitive interference, was reduced for females in the high power prime compared to low power prime during approximate, but not exact, calculation. Taken together, these results indicate that even temporarily <b>heightening</b> <b>a</b> person’s <b>sense</b> of social power can increase their math performance, possibly by reducing cognitive interference during math performance...|$|R
40|$|Hub Central {{is an area}} of 10, 500 {{square metres}} that has built its own unique {{community}} that embraces diverse interaction and supports the first year experience. Students were used in the co-creation of a space that has been designed to promote academic achievement by enhancing the student experience. By reflecting on their own needs, roles and contributions, a space has been delivered that is multifunctional, allows repurposing and fosters students developing their own approaches to interaction. A space largely with a philosophy of self management by students and filled with staff that are student centric has resulted in a community with <b>an</b> overall <b>heightened</b> <b>sense</b> of awareness and empathy towards the goals of their peers. The Hub includes 11 bookable student project rooms, 13 student projects booths, 290 fixed student computers, training rooms, Wi-Fi, a student kitchen, 3 commercial food outlets, a general store, the Maths Learning, PASS and Writing Centres and Student and IT Support Services operating extended hours (8 am to 10 pm weekdays, 10 am to 5 pm weekends). The collocation of all this has provided a greater feeling of belonging and encouraged the students to interact in diverse groups beyond the classroom. The paper aims to provide real world examples to encourage discussion of how ‘space’ can be designed and utilised for fostering a sense of belonging for first year students. Hedley Reberge...|$|R
