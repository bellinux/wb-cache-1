By 1859, after seventeen years of childlessness, Ernest took no further interest in his wife.|$|E
5|$|Another {{key figure}} in Skagen, P.S. Krøyer, married Marie Triepcke after {{falling in love with}} her in Paris in 1888. The {{daughter}} of a prosperous German loomery engineer, she was said to be {{the most beautiful woman in}} Copenhagen. However, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>went</b> <b>by,</b> Krøyer's health began to deteriorate and Marie was increasingly unhappy with their marriage. The marriage finally ended in a divorce in 1905 when Marie became pregnant after an affair with the composer Hugo Alfvén whom she then married. Krøyer died in Skagen four years later, apparently as a result of mental illness.|$|E
5|$|In later life, she {{eventually}} adopted more conventional behaviour, took up pious works and even reformed the convent that became her second {{residence in the}} Paris suburbs. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>went</b> <b>by</b> she suffered serious setbacks to her health and the sadness of mourning her eldest son, Grand Prince Ferdinando, for whom {{she had had a}} genuine affection. Rendered financially independent by a legacy, she purchased a house in Paris, from which she spent {{the end of her life}} dispensing charity and keeping up dignified correspondence.|$|E

However, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>went</b> <b>by,</b> Horodecki eventually had to sell the building due to financial troubles, after which it changed ownership numerous times before finally being occupied by an official Communist Party polyclinic until the early 2000s. When the building was vacated, its interior and exterior decor were fully reconstructed and restored according to Horodecki original plans.|$|E
5|$|With {{progress}} in palaeontology, {{the reputation of}} the models declined. In 1895, the American fossil hunter Othniel Charles Marsh scorned the dinosaurs' friends as doing them a great injustice, and spoke angrily of the models. The models and the park fell into disrepair <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>went</b> <b>by,</b> a process aided by the fire that destroyed the Crystal Palace itself in 1936, and the models became obscured by overgrown foliage. A full restoration of the animals was carried out in 1952 by Victor H.C. Martin, at which time the mammals on the third island were moved to less well-protected locations in the park, where they were exposed to wear and tear. The limestone cliff was blown up in the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{was said}} by chroniclers to be good-looking, red-haired, freckled, {{with a large}} head; he had a short, stocky body and was bow-legged from riding. Often he was scruffily dressed. Not as {{reserved}} as his mother Matilda, nor as charming as his father Geoffrey, Henry was famous for his energy and drive. He was also infamous for his piercing stare, bullying, bursts of temper and, on occasion, his sullen refusal to speak at all. Some of these outbursts, however, may have been theatrical and for effect. Henry {{was said to have}} understood a wide range of languages, including English, but spoke only Latin and French. In his youth Henry enjoyed warfare, hunting and other adventurous pursuits; <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>went</b> <b>by</b> he put increasing energy into judicial and administrative affairs and became more cautious, but throughout his life he was energetic and frequently impulsive.|$|E

Schroeder, Lucy van Pelt, and her brother Linus debuted as very young children—with Schroeder and Linus both in diapers and pre-verbal.

The height of {{embellishment}} is found in a chapter in the book Northwestern fights and fighters by Cyrus Townsend Brady. In addition to his claims of carrying Custer's last dispatch, Goldin claimed he joined the Seventh Cavalry in 1873, witnessed the death of Lt. Benjamin Hodgson, and was present for a discussion of strategy between Captain Myles Keogh and General Custer. When others challenged his claims, Goldin claimed that Brady had distorted his letter.|$|E

The decline that began at the Battle of White Wolf Mountain destroyed the Wuhuan identity {{and their ability to}} remain politically independent, and for the most part, the Wuhuan ceased to be viewed as an independent people of the northern frontiers of China.|$|E
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>went</b> <b>by,</b> {{the three}} feudal lords and their {{extensive}} territories became increasingly autonomous. Finally, in 1673, Shang Kexi petitioned Kangxi {{for permission to}} retire to his hometown in Liaodong province and nominated his son as his successor. The young emperor granted his retirement, but denied the heredity of his fief. In reaction, the two other generals decided to petition for their own retirements to test Kangxi's resolve, thinking {{that he would not}} risk offending them. The move backfired as the young emperor called their bluff by accepting their requests and ordering that all three fiefdoms to be reverted to the crown.|$|E
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>went</b> <b>by,</b> Isabella {{became very}} close to her {{daughter}} Joan, especially after Joan left her unfaithful husband, King David II of Scotland. Joan also nursed her just before she died. She doted on her grandchildren, including Edward, the Black Prince. She became increasingly interested in religion as she grew older, visiting a number of shrines. She remained, however, a gregarious member of the court, receiving constant visitors; amongst her particular friends {{appear to have been}} Roger Mortimer's daughter Agnes Mortimer, Countess of Pembroke, and Roger Mortimer's grandson, also called Roger Mortimer, whom Edward III restored to the Earldom of March. King Edward and his children often visited her as well. She remained interested in Arthurian legends and jewellery; in 1358 she appeared at the St George's Day celebrations at Windsor wearing a dress made of silk, silver, 300 rubies, 1800 pearls and a circlet of gold. She may also have developed an interest in astrology or geometry towards the end of her life, receiving various presents relating to these disciplines.|$|E

25|$|The {{intended}} {{mission of}} the college's former patron, the Congregation of the Christian Brothers established in 1902 by Edmund Ignatius Rice, was the education of poor boys in Ireland by providing them with basic levels of literacy. This was the broad aim of the school when it opened its doors in 1856 at Eblana Avenue {{in what was then}} known as Kingstown (now Dún Laoghaire), a port town south of Dublin City. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>went</b> <b>by,</b> the aims of the Christian Brothers got broader and with it so did those of the Dún Laoghaire school. By the 1920s, the school was preparing boys for the state examinations and sending increasing number of students to third level. The growth in population in Dún Laoghaire, with an increasing Catholic middle class demographic, led to an increase in the demand for the school. To that end, a decision was made to procure Monkstown Park in 1949 and to move the entire secondary department to this location. The school then in effect split, with the secondary department (now known as C.B.C. Monkstown) moving location while the primary school (known as C.B.S. Eblana Avenue) remained at the original site. A private junior school was then opened at the Monkstown College with Eblana Avenue taking secondary students again from 1954.|$|E
500|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>went</b> <b>by</b> and {{the king}} became {{increasingly}} prone to outbursts of anger, breaking with all his old relationships, {{it was said that}} only in Caroline and their sons' company did Leopold [...] "recapture some of his vitality and Germanic humour". Caroline was described as having been above average in height, [...] "plump but graceful, with a beautiful complexion and skin", with masses of chestnut hair; in character, she was [...] "haughty, sharp, irritable" [...] and ill-educated, and insisted on being treated with respect or else one would have to face the king's displeasure. She was also said to be in possession of [...] "vivid conversational powers" [...] and [...] "dazzling youthfulness". Caroline was well-used to Leopold's [...] "quirks", such as his extreme hypochondria; for instance, when she needed free time for herself, she coughed and pretended to have a cold; she used this [...] "weapon" [...] to keep scheming female rivals from gaining favor with the king as well, telling Leopold that they had colds. Rather than ignore their age difference, Caroline and Leopold seemed to enjoy it, she calling him Tres Vieux and he calling her Tres Belle.|$|E

She commented, [...] "Pam didn’t have two parents, her father was a drunkard, and she really had to fight for everything she aspired to and achieved. When Bobby married her, he wasn’t marrying milk toast; she was very, very spirited; she was always a good person. I always felt Pam was the moral centre of the programme but she was complicated, and she was fiery, she had opinions, and she was not afraid to voice them. But <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>went</b> <b>by,</b> as JR became more and more evil, the writers felt, and I certainly understand why {{for the benefit of the}} show, that Pam had to become more and more good." [...] When asked about whether she had any input on her characters growth, she said: [...] "Once the show achieved extraordinary world wide fame, I don’t think any of us had much input. [...] You know the old saying, if it's not broken, don’t fix it; I really believe that Lorimar Television looked upon it as something that was working and they did not want to deviate from the formula." ...|$|E
