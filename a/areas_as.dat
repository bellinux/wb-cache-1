5|$|After Narelle {{moved into}} TCWC Perth's area of {{responsibility}} on 9 January, a cyclone watch was issued for areas between Whim Creek and Coral Bay. A blue alert, the Department of Fire and Emergency Services (DFES) lowest level of readiness, was also issued for areas between Mardie and Whim Creek. The following day, the watch was upgraded to a cyclone warning for all areas and a new watch was issued to the west, encompassing <b>areas</b> <b>as</b> far as Cape Cuvier. The watch was further extended early on 11 January to include areas between Cape Cuvier and Carnarvon. As the storm continued on a more westward path than initially anticipated, the warning area was gradually decreased, with areas east of Roebourne receiving the all clear later on 11 January. The watch area, however, continued to expand and encompassed <b>areas</b> <b>as</b> far east as Denham.

5|$|Because of its {{extremely}} bird-like {{anatomy and}} close relationship to other dromaeosaurids, paleontologists hypothesize that Deinonychus was probably covered in feathers.

When conducting studies of such <b>areas</b> <b>as</b> {{the range of}} motion in the forelimbs, paleontologists like Phil Senter have taken the likely presence of wing feathers (as present in all known dromaeosaurs with skin impressions) into consideration.|$|E
