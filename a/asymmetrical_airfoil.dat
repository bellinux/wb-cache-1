50|$|The RotorWay Scorpion {{design was}} updated with an {{aluminum}} tail and full fiberglass cockpit enclosure {{to become the}} Exec.

50|$|The {{tail rotor}} system rotates airfoils, small wings called blades, that vary in pitch in order to vary the amount of thrust they produce. The blades most often utilize a {{composite}} material construction, such as a core made of aluminum honeycomb or plasticized paper honeycomb, covered in a skin made of aluminum or carbon fiber composite. Tail rotor blades are made with both symmetrical and <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>airfoil</b> construction. The pitch change mechanism uses a cable control system or control tubes that run from the anti-torque pedals in the cockpit to a mechanism mounted on the tail rotor gearbox. In larger helicopters, the pitch change mechanism is augmented by a hydraulic power control servo. In {{the event of a}} hydraulic system failure, the mechanical system is still able to control the tail rotor pitch, though the control resistance felt by the pilot will be considerably greater.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{computational}} study of nonlinear effects of unsteady aerodynamics for non-classical aileron buzz. It aims at a comprehensive investigation of the aileron buzz phenomenon under varying flow parameters using the describing function technique with multiple inputs. The limit cycle oscillatory behavior of an <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>airfoil</b> is studied initially using a CFD-based numerical model and direct time marching. Sharp increases in limit cycle amplitude for varying Mach numbers and angles of attack are investigated. An aerodynamic describing function is developed in order to estimate the variation of limit cycle amplitude and frequency with Mach number and angle of attack directly, without time marching. The describing function results are compared to the amplitudes and frequencies predicted by the CFD calculations for validation purposes. Furthermore, a limited sensitivity analysis is presented to demonstrate {{the potential of the}} approach for aeroelastic design...|$|E
50|$|The Hanna Turbine http://www.wetgen.com U.S. patent 8,358,026, {{was invented}} by {{environmental}} activist John Clark Hanna in 2009. The Hanna Turbine was developed to improve upon the pioneering Wells Turbine. As with the Wells, the Hanna device has no moving parts that come {{in direct contact with}} the ocean. The turbine has two rotors with back-to-back <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>airfoils.</b> Both rotors are mirror images with low angles of attack. The airfoils have higher lift coefficients and less drag than the Wells Turbine. This makes the Hanna design less prone to stalling and offers more torque with a larger operating window. The Hanna design also drives two generators that operate outside of the enclosed air duct in a relatively dry environment. This allows for easy maintenance of the generators.|$|R

The objective of this experiment is to find {{the effect of}} this ratio on the airfoil performance for same wingspan but different chord. Three samples of different aspect ratios such as AR= 1. 83, AR= 2. 2 and AR= 2. 75 of <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>airfoils</b> type NACA 2412, were tested in this experiment, with different attack angles from 0 to 20 degrees, at constant wind speed of about 25 m/s.. The test conducted in subsonic wind tunnel of 1 m× 1 m rectangular test section, its maximum wind speed is about 43 m/s. The results of this experiment clarify that the Aspect Ratio (AR) has an important effect on the aerodynamic performance of the airfoils. Finally, the results show that the optimal performance was achieved at AR= 1. 83 with angles of attack ranging from 6 degree to 12 degree with wind speed of 25 m/s...|$|R
40|$|Very {{important}} {{requirement for}} the helicopter rotor airfoils is zero, or nearly zero moment coefficient about the aerodynamic center. Unlike the old technologies used for metal blades, modern production involving application of plastic composites has imposed the necessity of adding a flat tab extension to the blade trailing edge, thus changing the original airfoil shape. Using computer program TRANPRO, the author has developed and verified an algorithm for numerical analysis in this design stage, applied it on <b>asymmetrical</b> reflex camber <b>airfoils,</b> determined the influence of angular tab positioning on the moment coefficient value and redesigned some existing airfoils to include properly positioned tabs that satisfy very low moment coefficient requirement. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{computational}} study of nonlinear effects of unsteady aerodynamics for non-classical aileron buzz. It aims at a comprehensive investigation of aileron buzz phenomenon under varying flow parameters utilizing the classical approach of describing function technique with multiple input variables. Limit cycle oscillatory behavior of an <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>airfoil</b> section has been studied initially using an expensive high-fidelity model basd on a coupled CFD/CSD time marching approach. Using this high fidelity model, a multiple input aerodynamic describing function was developed that can effectively represent lumped nonlin-earities of aerodynamic subsystem. Limit cycles can be closely identified through multiple input aerodynamic describing function representation, taking into account also the bias effect due {{to the use of}} non-symmetric airfoils. Traditional LCO analysis of sensitivity with respect to hinge moment of inertia is performed. Further, outburst points of limit cycle amplitude for varying Mach number and angle of attacks are investigated. By using developed aerodynamic describing function, it has been demonstrated that limit cycle analysis methods may still be used while including the effects of aerodynamic nonlinearities. Results from both methods, direct time marching and multiple input describing function, have been broadly compared for validation...|$|E
40|$|The {{selection}} of an appropriate airfoil profile {{is one of}} the most important considerations in order to improve the aerodynamic performance of a fixed-pitch straight-bladed vertical axis wind turbine (SB-VAWT). The aim of this paper is to investigate the aerodynamic performance of different airfoil profiles that have the potential to improve the self-starting performance of a small-scale fixed-pitch SB-VAWT. Using experimental data sets of low Reynolds number, a preliminary assessment of different airfoil profiles were examined. Seven potential airfoils were identified and compared with the most widely used conversional symmetric airfoil based on a potential flow model theory. The results indicate that the conventional symmetrical airfoil is unsuitable for self-starting of small-scale SB-VAWT. Further, the study found that no particular <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>airfoil</b> has all the desirable characteristics for self-starting. However, two asymmetrical airfoils, namely DU- 06 -W- 200 and S 1210, showed exceptional aerodynamic performance and were further analysed to determine their torque output for a typical wind speed of 5 m/s. The results show that the DU 06 -W- 200 possesses a high starting torque and could be an ideal airfoil to eliminate the problem of self-starting for small-scale SB-VAWT...|$|E
40|$|Downwind wind {{turbines}} have lower upwind rotor misalignment, and thus lower turning moment and self-steered {{advantage over the}} upwind configuration. In this paper, numerical simulation to the downwind turbine is conducted to investigate {{the interaction between the}} tower and the blade during the intrinsic passage of the rotor {{in the wake of the}} tower. The moving rotor has been accounted for via ALE formulation of the incompressible, unsteady, turbulent Navier-Stokes equations. The localized CP, CL, and CD are computed and compared to undisturbed flow evaluated by Panel method.
