5|$|In Subsaharan Africa, Javanese batik was {{introduced}} in the 19th century by Dutch and English traders. The local people there adapted the Javanese batik, making larger motifs with thicker lines and more colours. In the 1970s, batik {{was introduced}} to Australia, where aboriginal artists at Erna Bella have developed it <b>as</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> craft.|$|E

Apparently Michael was displeased with the final form of the treaty negotiated by his envoys, but was forced to comply. Prince Michael said in a conversation with the Polish envoy Lubieniecki: …they did not proceed as stated in their instructions but <b>as</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> good required and obtained privileges for themselves. He would try to avoid the obligations imposed on him {{for the rest of his}} reign.|$|E
5|$|Bradford {{played no}} {{recorded}} pre-season friendlies. Instead, Campbell and Cutts, {{decided on the}} first selection for the opening {{game of the season}} with Grimsby Town by playing a series of Whites v Stripes games between professionals already signed by the club and amateur players. The first squad was signed at a cost of £917 10s 0d, with the players choosing Johnny McMillan <b>as</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> captain.

5|$|By the 15th {{century the}} reach and {{influence}} of the Burgundian princes meant that the Low Countries' merchant and banker classes were in the ascendancy. The early to mid-century saw great rises in international trade and domestic wealth, leading to an enormous increase in the demand for art. Artists from the area attracted patronage from the Baltic coast, the north German and Polish regions, the Iberian Peninsula, Italy and the powerful families of England and Scotland. At first, masters had acted <b>as</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> dealers, attending fairs where they could also buy frames, panels and pigments. The mid-century saw the development of art dealership as a profession; the activity became purely commercially driven, dominated by the mercantile class.|$|E

5|$|During the 1860s and 1870s Verdi paid great {{attention}} to his estate around Busseto, purchasing additional land, dealing with unsatisfactory (in one case, embezzling) stewards, installing irrigation, and coping with variable harvests and economic slumps. In 1867, both Verdi's father Carlo, {{with whom he had}} restored good relations, and his early patron and father-in-law Antonio Barezzi, died. Verdi and Giuseppina decided to adopt Carlo's great-niece Filomena Maria Verdi, then seven years old, <b>as</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> child. She was to marry in 1878 the son of Verdi's friend and lawyer Angelo Carrara and her family became eventually the heirs of Verdi's estate.|$|E
5|$|During the Eastern Han, {{conscription}} {{could be}} avoided if one paid a commutable tax. The Eastern Han court favored the recruitment of a volunteer army. The volunteer army comprised the Southern Army (Nanjun 南軍), while the standing army stationed in and near the capital was the Northern Army (Beijun 北軍). Led by Colonels (Xiaowei 校尉), the Northern Army consisted of five regiments, each composed of several thousand soldiers. When central authority collapsed after 189 AD, wealthy landowners, members of the aristocracy/nobility, and regional military-governors relied upon their retainers to act <b>as</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> personal troops (buqu 部曲).|$|E

5|$|Greece emerged victorious {{after the}} 1912-1913 Balkan Wars, with her {{territory}} almost doubled. The unstable international political {{climate of the}} early 20th century placed Greece in a difficult position. The ownership of the Greek occupied eastern Aegean islands was contested by the Ottoman Empire which claimed them <b>as</b> <b>their</b> <b>own.</b> In the north, Bulgaria, defeated in the Second Balkan War, was engineering revanchist strategies against Greece and Serbia. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria in Sarajevo precipitated Austria-Hungary's declaration of war against Serbia. This caused Germany and Austria-Hungary, and countries allied with Serbia (the Triple Entente) to declare war on each other, starting World War I.|$|E

5|$|No {{consensus}} existed {{regarding the}} taxonomy of Psittaciformes until recently. The {{placement of the}} Strigopoidea species has been variable in the past. They were once {{considered part of the}} Psittacoidea, but recent 21st-century studies place this group of New Zealand species <b>as</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> superfamily next to the Cacatuoidea and remaining members of the Psittacoidea. Many studies have confirmed the unique placement of this group {{at the base of the}} parrot tree. Most authors now recognize this group as a separate taxon containing two families: Nestoridae and Strigopidae. Conversely, the relationships among various cockatoo genera are largely resolved.|$|E
5|$|One theory interprets Putana {{as being}} the first foe faced by Krishna (further {{numerous}} demons are sent by Kamsa to kill Krishna) or as the first obstacle of possessive maternal instinct faced by yogis. The legend assures a devotee liberation if they treat god <b>as</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> son. Another theory interprets Putana as an infantile disease that Krishna survived, which can be cured by forcefully suckling the child affected. Further, the theory relates to Krishna's later life when he fights a demon called Jvara (fever).|$|E
5|$|Red wares were {{imported}} from southeastern Utah until , when the Chacoans switched to orange ware products originating from northeastern Arizona, near Kayenta. After 1000, almost no pottery {{was fired in}} the canyon, but was instead produced in outlying communities with access to {{a steady supply of}} firewood for their kilns. During the period from 1030 to 1100, significantly more pottery was imported to the canyon than before. The extensive Puebloan trade network that dispersed stoneware products throughout the region suggests that, although evidence of large-scale production is lacking, proficient local artisans supplied distant communities as well <b>as</b> <b>their</b> <b>own.</b>|$|E
