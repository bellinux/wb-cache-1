50|$|For 2013 the FJR1300 {{received}} {{a substantial number}} of updates, becoming the 'Gen-III' version. Bodywork is all new on the front half of the bike for better airflow and engine heat management, and a new faster-acting windshield mechanism was introduced. Front turn signal/position lights are now LEDs and there are LED accent lights around the headlights, and there is now one horn instead of two on prior years. In markets outside the US and Canada the AS (<b>AutoShift)</b> model received electrically adjustable suspension and inverted front forks - those suspension changes were introduced into the North American models in the following year as a model option known as the 'ES'.|$|E
5000|$|The Iveco PowerStar is an Australian {{developed}} and built prime mover, assembled in Dandenong, Victoria. It {{is based on}} the European Cab-Over-Engine models, but with a bonnet, it was available as both a day cab, as well as a sleeper cab. When first released in the late 1990s, it was available with Iveco engines, and also American engines, including Detroit Diesel's Series 60, Cummins ISM, ISX and Signature and Caterpillar C12 and C15. A selection of transmissions was also available, such as Iveco's ZF [...] "Eurotronic", Eaton's RoadRanger and Eaton's automated manual the <b>Autoshift.</b> Rear diffs were usually Meritor units, drive shafts were usually Spicer 1810 series on the main shaft and 1710 series on the jack shaft between the two diffs. Rear suspension was either Hendrickson HAS461 or NeWay. Electrical system was a 24 volt system.|$|E
40|$|Radiolocation {{methods of}} probing minor {{celestial}} bodies (asteroids) by the nanosecond pulses {{can be used}} for monitoring of near-Earth space with the purpose of identification of hazardous cosmic objects able to impact the Earth. Development of the methods that allow to improve accuracy of determining the asteroids size (i. e. whether it measures tens or hundreds meters in diameter) is important for correctly estimating the degree of damage which they can cause (either regional or global catastrophes, respectively). In this paper we suggest a novel method of estimating the sizes of the passive cosmic objects using the radiolocation probing by ultra-high-resolution nanosecond signals to obtain radar signatures. The modulation envelope of the reflected signal, which is a radar portrait of the cosmic object, is subjected to time scale transformation to carrier Doppler frequency by means of radioimpulse strobing. The shift of a strobe within the probing period will be performed by radial motion of the object which will allow to forgo the special <b>autoshift</b> circuit used in the oscillographic technical equipment. The measured values of duration of radiolocation portrait can be used to estimate the mean radius of the object by using the average spatial length of the portrait. The method makes it possible to appraise the sizes of cosmic objects through their radiolocation portrait duration, with accuracy that is independent of the objects range...|$|E
50|$|Cable guides {{below the}} bottom bracket can be cheaper, {{just a piece}} of moulded plastic, and, for some bikes with very small chainrings, {{eliminate}} interference between the rear derailleur cable and the bottom of the front derailleur cage. They also make for a cleaner appearance and easier to clean frame in the bottom bracket area. Poor lubrication of bottom-bracket cable guides is a common cause of <b>autoshifting.</b>|$|R
