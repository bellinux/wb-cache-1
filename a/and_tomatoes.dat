5|$|Spanish conquistadors brought {{potatoes}} <b>and</b> <b>tomatoes</b> {{from the}} Americas to Europe in the 16th century, but these vegetables only became commonly grown and consumed in Eastern Europe in the 19th century. Eventually, both became staples of peasant diet and essential ingredients of Ukrainian and Russian borscht. Potatoes replaced turnips in borscht recipes, <b>and</b> <b>tomatoes</b> – fresh, canned or paste – took over from beet sour {{as the source}} of tartness. The turnip is rarely found in modern recipes, and even then, together with potatoes. In Ukraine, beet sour <b>and</b> <b>tomatoes</b> were both used for some time until the latter ultimately prevailed during the last third of the 19th century.|$|E

40|$|The {{cultivation}} of green-chili <b>and</b> <b>tomato</b> {{has become a}} prominent income among the farmers in Sri Lanka. Therefore, establishing a statistically equipped market information system and a comparative study is important to identifying the price fluctuations of green-chili <b>and</b> <b>tomato</b> as well as managing the price risk. For this study, 10 years (2004 - 2013) monthly wholesale prices of green-chili <b>and</b> <b>tomato</b> were obtained from Dambulla Dedicated Economic Centre. The time series {{analysis was used to}} analyze the fluctuations of prices and estimate forecasting models for wholesale prices of both selected vegetables. Based on the trend analysis, the quadratic trend models were selected as the best trend models for both green-chili <b>and</b> <b>tomato.</b> Furthermore,(1, 1, 1) (2, 1, 2) 12 and (2, 1, 2) models were selected as the most suitable model to forecast the wholesale prices of green-chili <b>and</b> <b>tomato</b> respectively. Moreover, the Granger-causality test and VAR method were revealed that there is an unidirectional causality between wholesale prices of green-chili <b>and</b> <b>tomato...</b>|$|R
5|$|Another {{widespread}} and popular dish is moussaka, a baked dish of aubergine or potato with various other ingredients: often minced meat <b>and</b> <b>tomatoes,</b> sometimes {{a layer of}} egg custard or béchamel sauce on top. In its Greek variant, well-known outside the region, it includes layers of aubergine and minced meat with custard or béchamel sauce on top, but that version is a relatively recent innovation, introduced by the chef Nikolaos Tselementes in the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|Common {{starlings}} can eat {{and damage}} fruit in orchards such as grapes, peaches, olives, currants <b>and</b> <b>tomatoes</b> or dig up newly sown grain and sprouting crops. They may also eat animal feed and distribute seeds through their droppings. In eastern Australia, weeds like bridal creeper, blackberry and boneseed {{are thought to}} have been spread by common starlings. Agricultural damage in the US is estimated as costing about US$800 million annually. This bird is not considered to be as damaging to agriculture in South Africa {{as it is in the}} United States.|$|E
5|$|Proper post-harvest storage {{aimed at}} {{extending}} and ensuring shelf life is best effected by efficient cold chain application. Cold storage is particularly useful for vegetables such as cauliflower, eggplant, lettuce, radish, spinach, potatoes, <b>and</b> <b>tomatoes,</b> the optimum temperature {{depending on the}} type of produce. There are temperature-controlling technologies that do not require the use of electricity such as evaporative cooling. Storage of fruit and vegetables in controlled atmospheres with high levels of carbon dioxide or high oxygen levels can inhibit microbial growth and extend storage life.|$|E

5|$|The basic {{staples of}} the Maya diet were maize, beans, and squashes. These were {{supplemented}} {{with a wide}} variety of other plants either cultivated in gardens or gathered in the forest. At Joya de Cerén, a volcanic eruption preserved a record of foodstuffs stored in Maya homes, among them were chilies <b>and</b> <b>tomatoes.</b> Cotton seeds were in the process of being ground, perhaps to produce cooking oil. In addition to basic foodstuffs, the Maya also cultivated prestige crops such as cotton, cacao and vanilla. Cacao was especially prized by the elite, who consumed chocolate beverages. Cotton was spun, dyed, and woven into valuable textiles in order to be traded.|$|E
5|$|In Cuba, sailors on the USS America (CV-66) {{spent about}} 1,700hours to assist Guantánamo Bay in recovery. The sole {{survivor}} of the sinking boat carrying Cuban exiles was tried in a military tribunal. The man was {{held responsible for the}} 44boat deaths and was quickly executed. The United States Coast Guard deployed boats, helicopters, and airplanes to find victims of the boat capsized in the Straits of Florida. In the United States, the price for lettuce <b>and</b> <b>tomatoes</b> rose due to Inez's crop damage in Florida and reduced crop output in California. The country's military sent helicopters and planes to join the Mexican Air Force, as well as trucks by land, to deliver tons of supplies, including food, clothing, and medicine to flood-affected areas in Tamaulipas. In the weeks after the storm, many residents had minimal food access, and some areas remained flooded. Conditions in Tampico, located near where the storm moved ashore, gradually returned to normal. Heavy rainfall in Mexico restored reservoirs, which assisted future crop growing.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{survived the}} energy use {{patterns}} and energy input-output of wheat <b>and</b> <b>tomato</b> productions in Isfahan province of Iran. The face-to-face questionnaire method {{was used to}} collect the data from 75 and 35 farmers for wheat <b>and</b> <b>tomato,</b> respectively. The results showed that total energy input for wheat <b>and</b> <b>tomato</b> production was to 46108 and 115894 MJha- 1, respectively. Among all inputs involved, fertilizer had the highest energy value per hectare for wheat; furthermore, diesel fuel had the highest share of total energy consumption for tomato production. The value of energy ratio for cultivating wheat <b>and</b> <b>tomato</b> productions were calculated at 0. 95 and 0. 75, respectively. The ratio of renewable energy within the total energy in all productions is very low. The share of non-renewable energy for wheat <b>and</b> <b>tomato</b> production was 80 % and 85 %, respectively. The results of CO 2 emission analyzes showed that {{the total amount of}} CO 2 emission for wheat <b>and</b> <b>tomato</b> production was 1. 9 and 4. 7 tonesha- 1, respectively. In the research area, use of further energy made some environmental damages such as global warming, nutrient loading and pesticide pollution. Therefore, {{there is a need to}} develop a new policy to force producers to use all inputs on time and enough undertake more energy efficient practices...|$|R
