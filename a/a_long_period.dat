5|$|Although the Act of Parliament {{defining}} {{high treason}} {{remains on the}} United Kingdom's statute books, during <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>period</b> of 19th-century legal reform the sentence of hanging, drawing, and quartering was changed to drawing, hanging until dead, and posthumous beheading and quartering, before being abolished in England in 1870. The death penalty for treason was abolished in 1998.|$|E

5|$|In 1950, the Finnish {{government}} was criticised for ignoring other options and buying only Vanajas, which {{were said to}} be overpriced.

5|$|The {{construction}} of Canning Dam ended <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>period</b> during which Perth's water supply was generally unsatisfactory in quality (either due to salinity or bacterial pollution or both) and in quantity.

5|$|When {{stationary}} fronts become {{smaller in}} scale, degenerating {{to a narrow}} zone where wind direction changes significantly over a relatively short distance, they become known as shearlines.

5|$|While {{the number}} and {{severity}} of symptoms varies among individuals, repetitive regurgitation of undigested food (known as rumination) {{after the start of}} a meal is always present. In some individuals, the regurgitation is small, occurring over <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>period</b> of time following ingestion, and can be rechewed and swallowed. In others, the amount can be bilious and short lasting, and must be expelled.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>long</b> <b>period</b> of uplift {{and erosion}} was {{concurrent}} with {{and followed the}} above events, creating a major unconformity. Sediments worn off the Death Valley region were shed both east and west and carried by wind and water; the eastern sediments ended up in Colorado and are now famous for their dinosaur fossils. No Jurassic to Eocene sedimentary formations exist in the area except for some possibly Jurassic-age volcanic rock around Butte Valley. Large parts of previously deposited formations were removed; probably by streams that washed the sediment into the Cretaceous Seaway that longitudinally divided North America to the east.|$|E
5|$|A pupil {{like myself}} had {{to submit to}} Balakirev a {{proposed}} composition in its embryo, say, even the first four or eight bars. Balakirev would immediately make corrections, indicating how to recast such an embryo; he would criticize it, would praise and extol the first two bars, but would censure the next two, ridicule them, and try {{hard to make the}} author disgusted with them. Vivacity of composition and fertility were not at all in favor, frequent recasting was demanded, and the composition was extended over <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>period</b> of time under the cold control of self-criticism.|$|E

5|$|Adams {{left the}} club in April 1962 and was {{replaced}} with Sid Abel, who was also head coach. First under Abel as GM and then Ned Harkness, Alex Delvecchio, Lindsay, and Jimmy Skinner in the position, the Red Wings suffered <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>period</b> of decline, from 1967 until 1983, during which they made the playoffs only twice.

5|$|After <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>period</b> of {{remaining}} empty, the castle {{slowly began to}} decay, until in 1812, when Simon Temple, a local businessman, leased the castle from the Strathmores and made it habitable. He re-roofed the chapel (allowing it {{to be used for}} public worship again), added battlements to the wings and cultivated the gardens. However, his failed business ventures prevented him from completing his work, and in 1819 the castle was lived in by a Mr. Thomas Wade.|$|E
5|$|As Petty gets {{further into}} his investigation, Rost's answers become more evasive.

It is not clear at the film's end whether Rost's films are actual snuff in the fictional subplot's context. However, {{it is known that}} he spies on them for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>period</b> of time before asking them to participate.|$|E
