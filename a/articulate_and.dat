5|$|Avoiding overdecoration, {{these artists}} left uncarved spaces where required, {{although}} their elaborate doorjambs are exhibitionistic. Here, {{on the outer}} walls, the sculptures are not overdone, yet they are <b>articulate</b> <b>and</b> discreetly aesthetic. The Hoysala builders used soapstone almost universally as building material, a trend that started {{in the middle of}} the 11th century with Chalukyan temples. Other common artistic features between the two Kanarese dynasties are the ornate Salabhanjika (pillar bracket figures), the lathe-turned pillars and the makara torana (lintel with mythical beastly figure). The tower over the shrine in a Hoysala temple is a closely moulded form of the Chalukya style tower.|$|E
5|$|Bo's {{stint as}} Minister of Commerce {{significantly}} raised his international profile and generated media attention both in China and abroad. Described as good-looking, <b>articulate</b> <b>and</b> open-minded in {{his approach to}} problems, Bo's rise from a municipal official to the central government generated great media fanfare and elevated his status to something of a 'political star.' Bo's political persona was considered {{a departure from the}} generally serious and conservative leadership in Beijing. With his youthful vigour, populism, and purported popularity with female reporters, Bo's political rise had been compared to that of John F. Kennedy.|$|E
5|$|Protected against double jeopardy, Bryant and Milam {{struck a}} deal with Look {{magazine}} in 1956 to tell their story to journalist William Bradford Huie for between $3,600 and $4,000. The interview took place in the law firm of the attorneys who had defended Bryant and Milam. Huie did not ask the questions; Bryant and Milam's own attorneys did. Neither attorney had heard their clients' accounts of the murder before. According to Huie, the older Milam was more <b>articulate</b> <b>and</b> sure of himself than the younger Bryant. Milam admitted to shooting Till and neither of them believed they were guilty or that they had done anything wrong.|$|E

25|$|From 1914 onward, Gramsci's {{writings}} for socialist newspapers such as Il Grido del Popolo {{earned him}} {{a reputation as a}} notable journalist. In 1916, he became co-editor of the Piedmont edition of Avanti!, the Socialist Party official organ. An <b>articulate</b> <b>and</b> prolific writer of political theory, Gramsci proved a formidable commentator, writing on all aspects of Turin's social and political life.|$|E
25|$|The 1928 {{campaign}} {{was the first}} of Thomas's six consecutive campaigns as the presidential nominee of the Socialist Party. As an <b>articulate</b> <b>and</b> engaging spokesman for democratic socialism, Thomas had considerably greater influence than the typical perennial candidate. Although most upper and middle class Americans viewed socialism as an unsavory form of political thought, the well-educated Thomas—who often wore three-piece suits and looked and talked like a president—gained grudging admiration.|$|E

25|$|Founder Paul Brown {{coached the}} team for its first eight seasons. One of Brown's college draft {{strategies}} was to draft players with above-average intelligence. Punter/wide receiver Pat McInally attended Harvard University and linebacker Reggie Williams attended Dartmouth College and served on Cincinnati city council while on the Bengals' roster. Because of this policy, many former players were highly <b>articulate</b> <b>and</b> went on to have successful careers in commentary and broadcasting {{as well as the}} arts. In addition, Brown had a knack for locating and recognizing pro football talent in unusual places.|$|E
25|$|Around that time, one of Williams' acquaintances, a {{coloured}} lawyer named Edgar Maresse Smith, {{petitioned the}} Governor to declare 1 August a holiday for {{the celebration of}} Emancipation. Robinson did not support it but Gorrie did. Even at that time, there was in Trinidad a highly educated, <b>articulate</b> <b>and</b> race-conscious group of black men, among them John Jacob Thomas, Maresse Smith, Mzumbo Lazare, C. E. Petioni, the Reverend Phillip Henry Douglin. Thomas particularly was famous for his book Froudacity (1889), in which he refuted and questioned the view espoused by Oxford historian James Anthony Froude that black people could not be entrusted with self-government. Thomas's ideas certainly inspired Williams.|$|E
25|$|The holotype skull (TMM 43631-1) {{that would}} be named Calsoyasuchus was {{discovered}} in 1997 by members of an expedition composed of crews from Texas Memorial Museum of the University of Texas at Austin, the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University, and the Seba Dalkai Navajo Nation School. It {{was found in the}} middle third of the silty facies of the Kayenta Formation, near the Adeii Eechii Cliffs. The skull is missing the lower jaws, part of the palate, most of the suspensorium (the bones that make up the region where the upper and lower jaws <b>articulate),</b> <b>and</b> the occiput and braincase. Sutures between the skull bones are mostly fused. As preserved, it is about 38.0centimeters (15.0in) long, making its owner a moderately sized animal.|$|E

Volvo agreed to transfer its technology in the assembly of its <b>articulated</b> <b>and</b> bi-articulated bus chassis to Philtrak and Del Monte jointly constituting a tri-partite agreement among the aforestated parties. Together, they intend to introduce the system not only in Metro Manila but all over the Philippines where the need arises especially on traffic clogged areas.|$|R

25|$|The {{ignition}} {{point for the}} definition of modernism as a movement was the austere rejection of popular culture as kitsch by important post-war artists and taste-makers, most notably Clement Greenberg with his essay Avant-Garde and Kitsch, first published in Partisan Review in 1939. During the 1940s and 1950s Greenberg {{proved to be an}} <b>articulate</b> <b>and</b> powerful art critic. In particular his writing on American Abstract expressionism, and 20th-century European modernism persuasively made the case for High art and culture. In 1961 Art and Culture, Beacon Press, a highly influential collection of essays by Clement Greenberg was first published. Greenberg is primarily thought of as a formalist art critic and many of his most important essays are crucial to the understanding of Modern art history, and the history of modernism and Late Modernism.|$|E
25|$|Frequently {{linked with}} Updike is the novelist Philip Roth. Roth vigorously explores Jewish {{identity}} in American society, {{especially in the}} postwar era and the early 21st century. Frequently set in Newark, New Jersey, Roth's work {{is known to be}} highly autobiographical, and many of Roth's main characters, most famously the Jewish novelist Nathan Zuckerman, are thought to be alter egos of Roth. With these techniques, and armed with his <b>articulate</b> <b>and</b> fast-paced style, Roth explores the distinction between reality and fiction in literature while provocatively examining American culture. His most famous work includes the Zuckerman novels, the controversial Portnoy's Complaint (1969), and Goodbye, Columbus (1959). Among the most decorated American writers of his generation, he has won every major American literary award, including the Pulitzer Prize for his major novel American Pastoral (1997).|$|E
25|$|In 1934, Pepper {{ran for the}} Democratic {{nomination}} for U.S. Senate, challenging incumbent Park Trammell. Pepper lost to Trammell in the primary runoff 51%-49%. But Pepper was unopposed in the 1936 special election {{following the death of}} Senator Duncan U. Fletcher, and succeeded William Luther Hill, who had been appointed pending the special election. In the Senate, Pepper became a leading New Dealer and close ally of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. He was unusually <b>articulate</b> <b>and</b> intellectual, and, collaborating with labor unions, he was often the leader of the liberal-left forces in the Senate. His reelection in a heavily fought primary in 1938 solidified his reputation as the most prominent liberal in Congress. His campaign based on a wages-hours bill, which soon became the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. He sponsored the Lend-Lease Act. He filibustered an anti-lynching bill in 1937.|$|E

25|$|In its {{physical}} aspect, singing has a well-defined technique {{that depends on}} the use of the lungs, which act as an air supply or bellows; on the larynx, which acts as a reed or vibrator; on the chest and head cavities, which have the function of an amplifier, as the tube in a wind instrument; and on the tongue, which together with the palate, teeth, and lips <b>articulate</b> <b>and</b> impose consonants and vowels on the amplified sound. Though these four mechanisms function independently, they are nevertheless coordinated in the establishment of a vocal technique and are made to interact upon one another. During passive breathing, air is inhaled with the diaphragm while exhalation occurs without any effort. Exhalation may be aided by the abdominal, internal intercostal and lower pelvis/pelvic muscles. Inhalation is aided by use of external intercostals, scalenes, and sternocleidomastoid muscles. The pitch is altered with the vocal cords. With the lips closed, this is called humming.|$|E
25|$|These criticisms {{are also}} voiced by non-libertarian transhumanist advocates, {{especially}} self-described democratic transhumanists, {{who believe that}} the majority of current or future social and environmental issues (such as unemployment and resource depletion) need to be addressed by a combination of political and technological solutions (like a guaranteed minimum income and alternative technology). Therefore, on the specific issue of an emerging genetic divide due to unequal access to human enhancement technologies, bioethicist James Hughes, in his 2004 book , argues that progressives or, more precisely, techno-progressives must <b>articulate</b> <b>and</b> implement public policies (i.e., a universal health care voucher system that covers human enhancement technologies) in order to attenuate this problem as much as possible, rather than trying to ban human enhancement technologies. The latter, he argues, might actually worsen the problem by making these technologies unsafe or available only to the wealthy on the local black market or in countries where such a ban is not enforced.|$|E
25|$|The President of the United States of America takes {{pleasure}} in presenting the Legion of Merit to Rear Admiral Charles Elliott Loughlin (NSN: 0-72307/1100), United States Navy, for exceptionally meritorious conduct {{in the performance}} of outstanding services to the Government of the United States as Commander Submarine Flotilla SIX from 24 August 1964 to 24 September 1966. As an extremely competent and resourceful leader, Rear Admiral Loughlin exercised military and operational command over a major portion of the Submarine Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet during a period of unprecedented growth. In particular, he supervised the post construction and post overhaul pre-deployment training, Demonstration and Shakedown Operations (DASO) and tactical load out periods for the Fleet Ballistic Missile Submarines in an exemplary manner. By virtue of dynamic leadership and outstanding professional knowledge, he ensured the successful operation of two SSBN replenishment sites and the effective functioning of off crew support operations at Charleston, South Carolina. Rear Admiral Loughlin further {{has proven to be a}} most <b>articulate</b> <b>and</b> impressive spokesman for the Navy. In carrying out all of the foregoing duties, as well as the additional NATO duty of Commander Submarine Force, Eastern Atlantic Area (Designate), Rear Admiral Loughlin has demonstrated the finest degree of judgment and an inspiring devotion to duty which has been fully in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.|$|E
