5|$|Hayward assumed {{command of}} the Naval Ordnance Laboratory at White Oak, Maryland in June 1954. He was the first naval aviator to do so, all the {{previous}} commanders having been naval ordnance officers. Under his guidance, the Naval Ordnance Laboratory developed the Mark 52 naval mine, an air-delivered weapon with acoustic, magnetic and pressure sensors. Hayward encountered some resistance with this project, <b>as</b> <b>mine</b> warfare was a neglected field in the Navy. The Naval Ordnance Laboratory also developed the Mark 90 nuclear bomb, a nuclear depth charge, which was tested during Operation Wigwam in May 1955.|$|E

25|$|Officially {{designated}} <b>as</b> <b>mine</b> destructor vessels, the Cybele {{class was}} a large trimaran vessel, constructed using a steel lattice truss framework. They were intended to be towed through minefields that used pressure mines, creating a pressure wave that would detonate the mines; the open lattice construction of the ships would, according to the design, allow the blast {{to pass through the}} vessel without causing damage to it.|$|E

25|$|The CIO found {{organizing}} textile {{workers in}} the South even harder. As in steel, these workers had abundant recent first-hand experience of failed organizing drives and defeated strikes, which resulted in unionists being blacklisted or worse. In addition, the intense antagonism of white workers toward black workers and the conservative political and religious milieu made organizing even harder. On the other hand, some independent left-wing unions, such <b>as</b> <b>Mine,</b> Mill and the Food, Tobacco, Agricultural, and Allied Workers Union of America.|$|E
25|$|The {{program has}} been dogged by {{controversy}} over {{the treatment of the}} animals and speculation as to the nature of its mission and training. This has been due at least in part to the secrecy of the program, which was de-classified in the early 1990s. Since the program’s inception, there have been ongoing animal welfare concerns, with many opposing the use of marine mammals in military applications, even in essentially non-combatant roles such <b>as</b> <b>mine</b> detection. The Navy cites external oversight, including ongoing monitoring, in defense of its animal care standards.|$|E
25|$|The Argyle diamond mine is {{economically}} feasible because its large reserves and high-grade ore offset a low average diamond value. The estimated value of Argyle diamond production is only US$7 per carat ($35/g); this compares to values of $70 per carat ($350/g) for diamonds produced at the Diavik mine and US$170 per carat ($850/g) at the Ekati mine, both in Canada. However, Argyle has {{two to four}} times the concentration of diamonds (ore grade) of these mines. This makes extraction {{economically feasible}}, <b>as</b> <b>mine</b> costs are mostly related {{to the amount of}} ore processed, not the amount of diamond extracted.|$|E

After a period of decline it revived {{in the early days of}} the New Deal and helped found the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) in 1935. The Mine Mill union was expelled from the CIO in 1950 during the post-war red scare for refusing to shed its communist leadership. After spending years fighting off efforts by the United Steelworkers of America (USWA) to raid its membership, Mine Mill and the CAW merged in 1967 and were able to retain the name Mine Mill Local 598.|$|E
25|$|I don't hate Islam. I {{consider}} it a backward culture. I have travelled much in the world. And wherever Islam rules, it's just terrible. All the hypocrisy. It's a bit like those old Reformed Protestants. The Reformed lie all the time. And why is that? Because they have standards and values that are so high that you can't humanly maintain them. You also see that in that Muslim culture. Then look at the Netherlands. In what country could an electoral leader of such a large movement <b>as</b> <b>mine</b> be openly homosexual? How wonderful that that's possible. That's something that one can be proud of. And I'd like {{to keep it that}} way, thank you very much.|$|E
25|$|The Chinatown in San Francisco {{is one of}} {{the largest}} in North America and the oldest north of Mexico. It served as a port of entry for early Chinese {{immigrants}} from the 1850s to the 1900s. The area was the one geographical region deeded by the city government and private property owners which allowed Chinese persons to inherit and inhabit dwellings within the city. Many Chinese found jobs working for large companies seeking a source of labor, most famously as part of the Central Pacific on the Transcontinental Railroad. Other early immigrants worked <b>as</b> <b>mine</b> workers or independent prospectors hoping to strike it rich during the 1849 Gold Rush. Other cities in North America where Chinatowns were founded in the mid-nineteenth century include almost every major settlement along the West Coast from San Diego to Victoria.|$|E

500|$|Marjorie Gilberg, {{executive}} director of the anti-teenage violence group Break the Cycle, commented that [...] "Love the Way You Lie" [...] can teach listeners about the dangers of abusive relationships if interpreted correctly. She believed that because popular culture often depicts what is socially acceptable, people may accept such violence more easily. She added, [...] "One problem, though,... is that the song reflects myths about domestic violence—myths that lead to blaming the victim." [...] Gilberg said the victim is often accused of being as guilty as the partner but wants to be loved, not abused. Terry O'Neill, a feminist {{and the president of the}} National Organization for Women, criticized the lyric, [...] "But your temper's just as bad <b>as</b> <b>mine</b> is / You're the same as me", saying it is a typical excuse used by abusive men for aggression and that [...] "it's only 2-year-olds and violent men who use violence to get what they want." [...] She added that Rihanna unintentionally glorifies domestic violence in the song despite attempting to fight it.|$|E

It soon meets County Route 523 (Main Street), and U.S. Route 202 makes a right turn {{to head to}} the northeast on Lamington Road. [...] The route heads east through residential areas and crosses the North Branch Raritan River into Far Hills. Upon entering Far Hills, the route intersects County Route 512 (Peapack Road), forming a concurrency that lasts with that route until County Route 512 heads south on Far Hills Road just before U.S. Route 202 crosses New Jersey Transit’s Gladstone Branch near the Far Hills Station. From here, the road heads northeast through wooded areas with some clearings and residences, crossing into Bernardsville. [...] In Bernardsville, U.S. Route 202 heads through rural areas with trees and fields <b>as</b> <b>Mine</b> Brook Road before reaching the town itself. [...] In the town, the route intersects County Route 525 (Claremont Road), briefly running concurrent with that route until it heads south on Mt. Airy Road. From the center of Bernardsville, U.S. Route 202 runs northeast as Morristown Road, crossing into Bernards Township, where it heads through wooded residential areas. In Bernards Township, the road features an intersection with County Route 613 (Childs Road) and North Maple Avenue, the latter providing access to Interstate 287.|$|E
500|$|Temeraire then rammed {{into the}} Redoutable, {{dismounting}} {{many of the}} French ship's guns, and worked her way alongside, after which her crew lashed the two ships together. Temeraire now poured continuous broadsides into the French ship, taking fire {{as she did so}} from the 112-gun Spanish ship Santa Ana lying off her stern, and from the 74-gun French ship Fougueux, which came up on Temeraires un-engaged starboard side. Harvey ordered his gun crews to hold fire until Fougueux came within point blank range. Temeraires first broadside against Fougueux at a range of 100yards caused considerable damage to the Frenchman's rigging, and she drifted into Temeraire, whose crew promptly lashed her to the side. Temeraire was now lying between two French 74-gun ships. As Harvey later recalled {{in a letter to his}} wife [...] "Perhaps never was a ship so circumstanced <b>as</b> <b>mine,</b> to have for more than three hours two of the enemy's line of battle ships lashed to her." [...] Redoutable, sandwiched between Victory and Temeraire, suffered heavy casualties, reported by Captain Lucas as amounting to 300 dead and 222 wounded. During the fight grenades thrown from the decks and topmasts of Redoutable killed and wounded a number of Temeraires crew and set her starboard rigging and foresail on fire. There was a brief pause in the fighting while both sides worked to douse the flames. Temeraire narrowly escaped destruction when a grenade thrown from Redoutable exploded on her maindeck, nearly igniting the after-magazine. Master-At-Arms John Toohig prevented the fire from spreading and saved not only Temeraire, but the surrounding ships, which would have been caught in the explosion.|$|E
