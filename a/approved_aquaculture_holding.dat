50|$|Selective {{breeding}} in <b>aquaculture</b> <b>holds</b> {{high potential}} for the genetic improvement of fish and shellfish. Unlike terrestrial livestock, {{the potential benefits of}} selective breeding in aquaculture were not realized until recently. This is because high mortality led to the selection of only a few broodstock, causing inbreeding depression, which then forced the use of wild broodstock. This was evident in selective breeding programs for growth rate, which resulted in slow growth and high mortality.|$|R

The {{substance}} is an easy to use powder containing hydrogen peroxide; when added to fish ponds hydrogen peroxide gets dissolved and subsequently decomposed into oxygen and water. This article presents the results from measurements in January 2017 in connection with practical application at an organic fish. The study showed that SPC leads to an evenly distribution of hydrogen peroxide {{in the water and}} maintained for a few hours.

50|$|Fish can be {{kept alive}} in {{floating}} cages, wells and fish ponds. In <b>aquaculture,</b> <b>holding</b> basins are used where the water is continuously filtered and its temperature and oxygen level are controlled. In China, floating cages are constructed in rivers out of palm woven baskets, while in South America simple fish yards are built in the backwaters of rivers. Live fish can be transported by methods which range from simple artisanal methods where fish are placed in plastic bags with an oxygenated atmosphere, to sophisticated systems which use trucks that filter and recycle the water, and add oxygen and regulate temperature.|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} decade, proteomic {{technologies}} have been increasingly used in fish biology research. Proteomics {{has been applied}} primarily to investigate the physiology, development biology {{and the impact of}} contaminants in fish model organisms, such as zebrafish (Danio rerio), as well as in some commercial species produced in aquaculture, mainly salmonids and cyprinids. However, the lack of previous genetic information on most fish species has been a major drawback for a more general application of the different proteomic technologies currently available. Also, many teleosts of interest in biological research and with potential application in <b>aquaculture</b> <b>hold</b> unique physiological characteristics that cannot be directly addressed from the study of small laboratory fish models. This review describes proteomic approaches that have been used to investigate diverse biological questions in model and nonmodel fish species. We will also evaluate the current possibilities to integrate fish proteomics with other >omic> approaches, as well as with additional complementary techniques, in order to address the future challenges in fish biology research.

However, with the complexity and diversity of the marine systems, the group requested more time to explore bivalve mollusks (oysters, clams, mussels and scallops) in depth. The National Organic Standards Board <b>approved</b> the <b>aquaculture</b> standards in 2007 and reconsidered the aquatic animal feed and facilities until they synthesized the public commentary in 2008. In 2010, the NOSB approved the recommendations for the bivalve mollusks section.|$|R

40|$|<b>Aquaculture</b> <b>holds</b> {{considerable}} {{potential to}} contribute to poverty alleviation, if it provides poor people with opportunities other than as primary producers. Integration of aquaculture into poverty reduction programmes provides means to diversify production systems and reduce food insecurity but also needs improved markets in locations where aquaculture can offer sustainable livelihoods to poor farming households. This study reviews the current constraints that poor people face in accessing markets in Cambodia and analyses its implications for pro-poor domestic aquaculture development. We use a Geographic Information System-based spatial Bayesian probability model to simulate market accessibility and estimate the numbers of poor people who could potentially benefit from improved market access under four different scenarios. Analysis of secondary data confirms that the potential for poor aquaculture producers to interact with urban markets in Cambodia is currently low. The potential of aquaculture to interact with rural markets is, however, high. It is concluded {{that the development of}} aquaculture has considerable potential to reduce the transaction costs in domestic fish trade by improved access of poor producers and consumers to rural markets in Cambodia. An aquaculture development strategy that improves rural market access could include benefits for up to 1 million poor aquatic resource users...|$|R

40|$|The demand {{studies for}} the fish sector are limited by their high degree of aggregation, {{and the lack of}} {{empirical}} basis for estimating the underlying elasticity of demand. In this study, the three-stage budgeting framework with quadratic almost ideal demand system (QAIDS) model has been used for fish demand analysis by species, using consumer expenditure survey data of India. Income and price elasticities of fish demand have been evaluated at mean level for different economic groups and have been used to project the demand for fish to a medium-term time horizon, by the year 2015. The domestic demand for fish by 2015 has been projected as 6. 7 - 7. 7 million tonnes. <b>Aquaculture</b> would <b>hold</b> the key {{to meet the challenges of}} future needs. Among species, Indian major carps (IMC) would play a dominating role in meeting the fish demand. Results have shown that the estimated price and income elasticities of demand vary across species and income classes. Fish species have not been found as homogenous commodities for consumers. All the eight fish types included in the study have been found to have positive income elasticity greater than one for all the income levels. Hence, with higher income, fish demand has been projected to increase substantially with change in the species mix. The own-price elasticities by species have been found negative and near to unitary.

40|$|Parasitic {{diseases}} in European aquaculture continue to pose economic and ecological threats to farmed and wild fish populations. The primary infection with ectoparasites can {{open the door}} to secondary or super- infections caused by bacterial and viral pathogens. Specifically, the infection with Argulus foliaceus (fish louse) in freshwater cyprinid fish such as common carp (Cyprinuscarpio) can increase production losses in affected aquaculture operations, or stocked water bodies. However, current veterinary drug use regulations in Germany limit the range of medications approved as treatment against ectoparasites in freshwater fish. A comparable parasite Lepeoptheirussalmonis (salmon louse) treatment with Diflubenzuron, Ivermectin and Doramectin (pesticides), has been <b>approved</b> in Salmon <b>aquaculture</b> in various countries. In order to control parasite populations, fish farmers frequently reach for non-approved but available treatments without veterinary supervision, possibly leading to consequences such as environmental damage, emergence of drug resistance or unwanted side effects on cultured and wild fish. The focus {{of this study is to}} investigate possible side effects of Diflubenzuron, Ivermectin, and Doramectin treatments on the innate immune system of a cyprinide fish. The overall research objective is to determine which antiparasitic drug and in what concentration and dose would present an effective treatment of the A. foliaceus without causing measurable side effects on fish neutrophil function. The first specific aim was to determine in vitro effects of commercial formulations of diflubenzuron, ivermectin and doramectin on fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) neutrophil function. Treatment effects in vitro on oxidative burst, degranulation, and neutrophil extracellular trap (NETs) release were studied. Application of ivermectin and doramectin (in estimated plasma concentrations of 308 and 125 ng/ml respectively) caused no significant stimulation of oxidative burst, degranulation of primary granules and NETs release. However, application of diflubenzuron (in estimated plasma concentrations of 200 ng/ml) caused a significant stimulation of oxidative burst. Diflubenzuron treated neutrophils showed up to three timeâs higher activity than the non-treated control. The second specific aim of the study was establishing a cell culture protocol of fathead minnow liver, spleen and kidney cells. In order to examine whether an incubation of the cells in culture of 48 hours with Diflubenzuron would alter the RNA expression in these organs, no significant change in expression of the tested genes (glutathione reductase, glutathione synthase, catalase, glutathione-s-transferase, catalase and CYP A 1) compared to a control could be proven. The observed effect indicates that the tested antiparasitic compounds have the potential to interfere with disease resistance in fish populations by modulating immune responses during treatment. Therefore, further study is required to find optimal therapeutic dose for effective and safe treatment against ectoparasites in cyprinide fish. The following conclusions can be drawn from the presented findings: In vitro studies on the innate immune system as the here presented neutrophil studies can give reliable first answers to questions concerning in vivo diseases and treatments. With studies on the gene expression, far-reaching and profound negative effects can be ruled out, when such investigations remain without significant results, as shown here...|$|R
40|$|<b>Aquaculture</b> and {{fisheries}} <b>hold</b> promise for supplying a growing world population with healthy food produced without undermining the earthâs carrying capacity. However, just as livestock production and agriculture, seafood production can have negative environmental impacts {{and if a}} continuous or even increased supply is to be guaranteed, the pressure on affected ecosystems needs to be limited. Due {{in part to a}} perceived failure of other governance mechanisms in improving the environmental performance of the sector, a large number of voluntary market based standards for farmed and wild caught seafood have been developed. Nonetheless, the knowledge base {{on the extent to which}} implementation leads to environmental improvements remains limited. Moreover, the role of consumers in driving demand for eco-labeled seafood is presently an under-researched area. This thesis aims at reducing this knowledge gap through an examination of the potential environmental effectiveness of aquaculture eco-certification and internal, psychological variables predicted to be of importance for sustainable seafood consumption. Put differently, what is the potential of eco-certification in greening the blue revolution and fuel âturquoise growthâ, and how can consumer demand be spurred? In Paper I, the role of eco-certification in improving the growing aquaculture sector at large was explored. Results showed that environmental effects at global scale likely will be limited due to e. g. partial coverage of species groups and environmental impacts, and a lack of focus on Asian markets and consumers. In Paper II the environmental performance of eco-certified and non-certified mangrove-integrated shrimp farms in Vietnam was compared by using Life Cycle Assessment and put in relation to conventional, more intensive farms. While there was no substantial difference between certified and non-certified farms in terms of environmental impacts, emissions of greenhouse gasses were higher for mangrove-integrated than conventional farms due to mangrove land use change. The results from Paper III demonstrated that the body of literature investigating ecological effects of seafood eco-certification is limited. âSpatially explicit ecosystem service informationâ (ES-information) on e. g. key ecosystem services and biodiversity in a given area is suggested to have potential to improve sustainability standards. Taking guidance from the pro-environmental behavior literature, consumers in Stockholm, Sweden were consulted on awareness of and attitudes towards eco-labeled seafood (Paper IV-V). Two variables, concern for environmental impacts and knowledge about seafood eco-labels were the best predictors for stated eco-labeled seafood purchasing. Moreover, there seemed to be a misalignment between consumersâ expectations on eco-labeled food in general and certification requirements for eco-labeled seafood. From this set of findings, a number of improvements of current seafood eco-certification are suggested. First, include an LCA-perspective in standards to a higher degree than presently done and provide readily available ES-information in the implementation and evaluation phase of certification. Second, introduce standardized mechanisms for capturing potential environmental improvements over time. And finally, stimulate demand by targeting Asian consumers and markets as well as strengthen consumer eco-label awareness and emotional involvement.
