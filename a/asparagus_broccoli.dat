40|$|Epidemiology {{studies have}} shown that {{consumption}} of fruits and vegetables is associated with the prevention of chronic diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular disease. Induction of cellular phase II detoxifying enzymes is associated with cancer preventive potential. Phenolsulfotransferases (PSTs) are traditionally known as phase II drug-metabolizing or detoxifying enzymes that facilitate the removal of drugs and other xenobiotic compounds. Phenolic acids are known to increase the activities of PSTs. In the present study, human HepG(2) cells were used as model to investigate the influence of twenty vegetables on human PST activity and to evaluate the relationships to their antioxidant activity and total phenolics content. The result showed that PST-P activity was significantly (p < 0. 01) induced by <b>asparagus,</b> <b>broccoli,</b> cauliflower, celery and eggplant, whereas PST-M activity was induced by <b>asparagus,</b> <b>broccoli,</b> carrot, eggplant and potato at a concentration of 100 mu g/ml. The vegetable extracts that induced both forms of PSTs activities were found to have higher antioxidant capacities and total phenolic content in the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) and Folin-Ciocalteu assay. The major polyphenols in broccoli, the most potential inducer in both forms of PSTs activities, was antioxidant phenolic acids. HPLC retention times and standard spiked indicated the presence of gallic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, p-coumaric acid, gentisic acid and ferulic acid in broccoli. The overall effect of vegetables tested on the activity of PST-P was well correlated to their ORAC value and total phenolics content (r = 0. 82, p < 0. 05 and r < 0. 78, p < 0. 05). These results imply that vegetables have a capability of inducing PST activity, and the PST induction may be possibly ascribed to antioxidant phenolic acids in vegetable extracts...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} controlled-atmosphere storage (CAS) on the {{survival}} {{and growth of}} Aeromonas hydrophila on fresh <b>asparagus,</b> <b>broccoli,</b> and cauliflower were examined. Two lots of each vegetable were inoculated with A. hydrophila 1653 or K 144. A third lot served as an uninoculated control. Following inoculation, vegetables were stored at 4 or 15 degrees C under a CAS system previously shown to extend the shelf life of each commodity or under ambient air. Populations of A. hydrophila were enumerated on the initial day of inoculation and at various intervals for 10 days (15 degrees C) or 21 days (4 degrees C) of storage. Direct plating of samples with selective media was used to enumerate A. hydrophila. The organism was detected on most lots of vegetables as they were received from a commercial produce supplier. Without exception, the CAS system lengthened the time vegetables were subjectively considered acceptable for consumption. However, CAS did not significantly affect populations of A. hydrophila which survived or grew on inoculated vegetables...|$|E

40|$|Previously {{isolated}} cDNA clones encoding glutamine synthetase (GS, EC 6. 3. 1. 2) {{genes from}} <b>asparagus</b> and <b>broccoli</b> were {{observed that the}} level of transcripts decreased in both plant species during storage. In order to identify factors regulating the postharvest deterioration of another important Asian vegetable bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis) shoot, the present study was conducted to isolate glutamine synthetase (pBA-GS) cDNA clone from a cDNA library prepared from harvested bamboo shoot using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. The partial cDNA clone encodes an mRNA of 832 bp and the derived amino acid sequence is highly homologous to GS from rice, barely and maize. Northern blot analysis showed decrease level of pBA-GS mRNA until 9 d at 20 �C, which coincided well with enzyme activity and ammonia accumulation. Results demonstrated that GS activity decrease during the postharvest storage of bamboo shoot which is a highly perishable vegetable like <b>asparagus</b> spears and <b>broccoli</b> head and {{is likely to be a}} critical feature of their postharvest physiology...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Galactolipids are a {{class of}} {{compounds}} widely found in the plant kingdom, including edible plants, and {{are an important part}} of the cell membranes. Galactolipids in plants consists mainly of monogalactosyldiacylglycerols and digalactosyldiacylglycerols containing one or two saturated and/or unsaturated fatty acids linked to the glycerol moiety. Several galactolipids have been shown to possess in vitro and/or in vivo anti-tumor promoting activity and anti-inflammatory activity. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the galactolipid, 1, 2 -di-O [...] linolenoyl- 3 -O [...] D-galactopyranosyl-sn-glycerol (1), may be important for the anti-inflammatory activity of dog rose (Rosa canina), a medicinal plant with documented effect on anti-inflammatory diseases such as arthritis. This galactolipid also occurs in relative high concentrations in certain legumes (e. g., common bean, pea), leaf vegetables (e. g., kale, leek, parsley, perilla and spinach), stem vegetables (e. g., <b>asparagus,</b> <b>broccoli,</b> brussels sprouts), and fruit vegetables (e. g., chilli, bell pepper, pumpkin). Furthermore, compound 1 has been isolated from spinach and several medicinal plants by bioassay-guided fractionation as a galactolipid with possible cancer preventive effects. In this review, the bioactivity of galactolipids is discussed and their potential role in human diet as important nutraceuticals. Moreover, recent patents on the bioactivity of specific galactolipids and inventions making use of this knowledge are presented and discussed...|$|E

40|$|The {{production}} model that was promoted internationally {{in the wake}} of the Second World War led to some notable gains in terms of economic growth and sharp rises in productivity in a wide range of economic sectors. At the same time, however, it brought consequences to the detriment of natural resources that were intensively exploited, especially underground water. In Mexico's case, the modernisation of agriculture can be divided into two stages. The first, or “inward”, stage took the form of an extraordinary increase in the production of feed-grains, sorghum in particular, for the nation’s pork and poultry industries. The second, or “outward”, phase [...] from 1982 to the present [...] has been typified by the rapid growth of export crops, mainly of vegetables (see Marañón and Wester, 2000; Marañón 2004, and 2002 a). The aim of this analysis, which is based on Mexico’s El Bajío region, is to present the process that led, in the second half of the 20 th century to the deterioration of aquifers as a result of the rapid expansion of commercial and export-led farming. El Bajío is an extensive valley about three hours ’ drive from Mexico City. It includes a large slice of the state of Guanajuato and neighbouring areas of the states of Michoacán and Querétaro, with altitudes that range from 1, 600 to 2, 000 metres above sea level. The region has more than 400, 000 hectares of high-quality irrigated land that produces grains for human and animal consumption, vegetables and fruit. Agro-industry is diversified, ranging from the production of wheat and maize flour, processed animal feed and dairy products to poultry and pork. El Bajío is also the nation’s leading producer of canned and frozen fruit and vegetables, including <b>asparagus,</b> <b>broccoli,</b> cauliflower, baby corn, carrots, Brussels sprouts, yellow squash, mangetout peas and strawberries, among others. The region accounts for 90 percent of Mexico’s exports of frozen produce, and is also the leading exporter of garlic and fresh green asparagus in the summer (Bivings an...|$|E

Growth of the pathogen occurred in whole tomatoes held at 21 degrees C but not at 10 degrees C, while death occurred in chopped tomatoes stored at these temperatures. Likewise, growth patterns of mesophilic aerobic microorganisms, psychrotrophic microorganisms, and yeasts and molds on whole and chopped tomatoes were essentially unaffected by chlorine and modified atmosphere packaging treatments. Populations of L. monocytogenes inoculated into commercially processed tomato juice and sauce and held at 5 degrees C remained constant for 14 days.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 68 - 74) This study investigates {{whether there}} is greater folacin retention in microwave cooked or in conventionally cooked vegetables. Three fresh vegetables: <b>asparagus,</b> <b>broccoli</b> and spinach were studied. Weighed (454 g) vegetable samples, with 57 ml distilled water added, were cooked by microwave oven or by stove-top cookery. Cooked vegetable weights and vegetable broth volumes were recorded. Free folic acid (FFA) and total folic acid (TFA) content of raw and cooked vegetables and drained vegetable broths were determined by a microbiological assay technique using Lactobacillus casei (ATCC 7469). Data were analyzed by computerized analysis of variance and Tukey???s HSD test for post hoc comparison of means. When spinach and broccoli were cooked {{there was a significant}} loss of both FFA and TFA due to either cooking method. Spinach retained significantly more FFA (P <. 01) when cooked by microwaves than when cooked conventionally. There {{was no significant difference in}} TFA content of spinach or in FFA and TFA content of broccoli due to cooking method. There was significant loss of FFA and TFA into the drained vegetable broth of both vegetables, but no significant difference in loss due to cooking method. Losses of FFA in the vegetable broth were 8. 5 % and l. l% for spinach, and 1. l% and 1. 9 % for broccoli for microwave and conventional methods respectively. Losses of TFA in the vegetable broth were 7. 8 % and 14. 9 % for spinach, and 6. 8 % and 4. 6 % for broccoli. Estimated losses due to destruction in cooking were: 13. 9 % and 23. 2 % FFA in spinach; 70. 2 % and 58 % FFA in broccoli; 10. 4 % and 9. 5 % TFA in spinach; 19. 8 % and 22 % TFA in broccoli, for microwave and conventional methods respectively. The F'FA content of asparagus was found to be erratic, probably due to the presence of conjugase in the natural vegetable, so the analysis for asparagus folacin content was discontinued. Based on this study, it can be stated that microwave cooking is as good as, but not superior to, conventional cooking with respect to folacin retention in vegetables...|$|E
40|$|Horticultural produce {{begins to}} {{deteriorate}} {{as soon as}} it is harvested. It begins to lose its flavour and texture, and it is susceptible to infection by pathogens. An effective method of slowing the loss in quality is to cool the produce as soon as possible after harvest. Many crops, such as pome fruits, <b>asparagus,</b> <b>broccoli,</b> peas and beans can be cooled within half an hour or so by drenching them with chilled water in a device known as a hydrocooler. The project described in this report was initiated by Mr Nick Christou of Christou Logistical Services. He was using a water chilling unit to cool water which he sprayed onto vegetables after which the water was discharged. This procedure was a waste of water and energy. He required a hydrocooler capable of cooling up to 6 tonnes per hour of produce, and that is transportable from growing region to growing region, and which is water-efficient. The Smart Water Fund grant enabled a hydrocooler that incorporated water recirculation to be developed and built jointly by Victoria University and Wobelea Pty Ltd. The strategy of recirculating water has reduced the water consumption from a required 60, 000 litres per tonne of broccoli cooled to about 75 litres per tonne. When round fruit such as apples are cooled the water consumption is estimated to be about 35 litres per tonne. Measurements show that broccoli cools by 80 % of its possible cooling range, i. e. from 30 ÂºC when sprayed with water at 0 ÂºC, in about 35 minutes. The total electricity consumption is 20 kWh and 16 kWh when the throughputs are 4 tonnes per hour and 6 tonnes per hours respectively. If the water were not recirculated the electricity consumption would be about 300 kWh per tonne. Outcomes of the project include: The design and operation of a recirculating hydrocooling system. A demonstration that the new system cools horticultural produce to temperatures that will maintain the shelf life and quality of the produce. A demonstration that the hydrocooler is capabale of eliminating contaminants from the recirculated water over brief periods of time. The identification of improvements that can be made to the design of the system. The hydrocooler is now being successfully operated in Wesley Vale near Devonport Tasmania in conjunction with Riverside Australia, Werribee...|$|E

Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated {{transformation}} {{to alter}} ethylene and cytokinin biosynthesis in broccoli. Plant Cell, Tissue and Organ Culture, 70 (1), 41 - 50. Broccoli (Brassica oleracea var. italica) deteriorates rapidly following harvest. The two plant hormones ethylene and cytokinin {{are known to}} act antagonistically on harvest-induced senescence in broccoli: ethylene acts by accelerating the process, whereas additional cytokinin delays it. The overall aim of this thesis was {{to gain a better}} understanding of how these two hormones control postharvest senescence. The effects of exogenous cytokinin (6 -benzyl aminopurine, 6 -BAP), 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylic acid (ACC) and sucrose on senescence-associated gene expression were measured in both wild-type plants and transgenic plants harbouring an antisense tomato ACC oxidase gene (pTOM 13). Exogenous cytokinin caused both a reduction (BoACO) and an increase (BoACS) in ethylene biosynthetic gene expression as well as reduced expression of genes encoding sucrose transporters and carbohydrate metabolising enzymes, indicating a significant role for cytokinin in the delay of senescence. Transgenic broccoli was produced using Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation. Ethylene biosynthesis was targeted via an antisense BoACO 2 gene fused to the harvest-induced asparagine synthetase (AS) promoter from <b>asparagus.</b> In addition, <b>broccoli</b> was transformed with constructs harbouring the Agrobacterium tumefaciens isopentenyl transferase (ipt) gene using the senescence-associated SAG 12 and floral-associated MYB 305 gene promoters to enhance the levels of cytokinin either during senescence or in floral tissue, respectively. The presence of the antisense AS-ACO construct was associated with an increased rate of transformation when compared to control constructs. Physiological analyses of mature plants showed that the antisense AS-ACO gene construct caused delayed senescence in both detached leaves and detached heads. Gene expression analyses of harvested floret tissue from AS-ACO lines showed decreases in transcript levels of senescence marker genes compared to wild-type and transgenic control lines, as well as a reduction in expression of sucrose transporter and carbohydrate metabolising genes, confirming the key role of ethylene in the promotion of senescence. In addition, genes involved with cytokinin biosynthesis and metabolism were isolated by PCR using primers based on Arabidopsis clones. The four broccoli ipt sequences aligned closely to four of the Arabidopsis sequences and were subsequently named BoIPT 4, BoIPT 5, BoIPT 6 and BoIPT 7. A cytokinin oxidase clone (BoCKX) was also isolated from broccoli. The four BoIPT genes were expressed in a number of different tissues, suggesting that the different genes may be involved in different biological processes in the plant. BoIPT 4 was expressed early and BoCKX expressed late in florets during senescence. A model depicting the regulation of senescence in broccoli through the expression of cytokinin biosynthesis and metabolism genes, and their interaction with ethylene and carbohydrate metabolism is presented and discussed...|$|R
