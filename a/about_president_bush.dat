When speaking about the military order issued by <b>President</b> George W. <b>Bush</b> on 13 November 2001, Agamben writes, [...] "What is new <b>about</b> <b>President</b> <b>Bush's</b> order is that it radically erases any legal status of the individual, thus producing a legally unnameable and unclassifiable being.

5000|$|USA Today elected Taking the Long Way {{the best}} {{album of the}} year {{according}} to the publication's music experts, writing, [...] "It was a calculated risk that paid off. Having alienated much of their country constituency with an ill-timed jibe at President Bush, the Chicks declined to beg for forgiveness, defiantly forging ahead with a forthright description of their situation and attitude, 'Not Ready to Make Nice', and releasing it as the album's lead-off single. That alienated even more of the country base, but throngs of new fans — and the majority of USA Today critics — were enthralled by the stance and, more important, the rich, textured, genre-transcendent music the trio and producer Rick Rubin cooked up." [...] Billboard magazine chose 'Taking the Long Way' as one of 2006's fifteen best albums writing, [...] "Once the darlings of country, the Chicks lost many fans — and the support of country radio — after a 2003 incident in which Natalie Maines made a relatively innocuous comment <b>about</b> <b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> from a London stage. The group has finally re-emerged stronger, more defiant and more creatively ambitious than ever. The first-time pairing with Rubin has resulted in a surprisingly cohesive mix of country and rock tunes, including co-writes with Sheryl Crow and Neil Finn. While many former fans remain critical of the group for its outspoken political views — an apparent no-no in country music — tracks like 'The Long Way Around', 'Everybody Knows', 'I Hope', (highlighted by a John Mayer guitar solo) and the chillingly sad 'Voice Inside My Head' are sure to earn the group at least some of its fans back." ...|$|E

" Some people feel that free speech is only acceptable now if the speaker has a Politically Correct point of view. It has been suggested that the students who demonstrated in the 60 's are now tenured faculty and are imposing Political Correctness on the Universities. It is a very sticky problem.

40|$|Bibliography: leaves 91 - 97. For most of {{the last}} five decades, the United States has relied on the autocratic leaders of Egypt, Saudi Arabia and other Arab {{countries}} to help protect its vital interests in the neighborhood. However, on the morning of September 11, 2001, U. S. priorities in the Middle East changed and the call for reform and democratization in the region became a central goal in U. S. foreign policy. Washington perceived the rise of liberal democratic political systems in the Arab world as a basic feature of U. S. national security policy. As they were building their new strategy, U:S. leaders sought to revive their alliance with Europe in order to contain Islamic Fundamentalism in which they saw a new enemy. Therefore, in a joint venture, they launched the Greater Middle East Initiative which aimed at assisting and helping Arab civil societies to reform and develop their countries. Arabs from different factions were skeptical <b>about</b> <b>President</b> <b>Bush's</b> new plan due to the failure of his past commitments in the region. To date, no serious reforms have occurred in the Middle East except for a few cosmetic changes in some countries like Egypt, Morocco, and Jordan {{and to a lesser extent}} Kuwait and Saudi Arabia; however, pressure by Arab societies calling for change has obviously increased, leading to some instability in the region. After providing a background of the American foreign policy in the Middle East, this study tackled the Greater Middle East Initiative trying to assess the real motives behind it, the obstacles it could face, along with Arab and European reactions. Furthermore, it presented the different setbacks of the Initiative along with some analysis based on different opinions. 1 bound copy: iv, 97 leaves; 30 cm. available at RNL...|$|R
