5|$|Dredd persuaded {{new chief}} judge McGruder {{to permit the}} {{citizens}} to vote in a referendum on whether democratic government should be restored, or the existing Judge System should be retained. McGruder agreed because the Judges had lost much of their credibility in failing to protect the citizens from the Dark Judges during Necropolis: since the Judges' argument in favour of their dictatorial rule rested largely on their allegedly unique ability to protect the city and preserve order (which the last elected government had conspicuously failed to do), the Democrats' calls for reform were consequently more compelling than ever. The Democracy Referendum was scheduled for 2113, and was not popular among the rank-and-file judges, or even the senior ranks, since <b>almost</b> <b>everybody</b> predicted that the unpopular Judges would lose the vote by a landslide. So much did the Referendum depend on Dredd's personal support that Judge Grice and other judges even tried to assassinate him to prevent the vote from going ahead.|$|E

It was written by the series creator and showrunner Charlie Brooker and directed by Carl Tibbetts. The episode follows Victoria (Lenora Crichlow), a woman who does not remember who she is and wakes up {{in a place where}} <b>almost</b> <b>everybody</b> is controlled by a television signal. Along with some of the few other unaffected people (Michael Smiley and Tuppence Middleton), she must stop the [...] "White Bear" [...] transmitter while surviving merciless pursuers.|$|E

It's a story of sleuthing, harassment, murder, the FBI — very especially the FBI — and the police, with the usual delicious decor of orchids, fine foods, and happily unconventional and pungent dialogue. <b>Almost</b> <b>everybody's</b> role is unexpectedly askew and you don't see how they can all possibly get their deserts, but they do, convincingly and rather hilariously.|$|R
500|$|Homer captures Molloy at the {{retirement}} home, and the surprisingly amiable cat burglar returns the objects he stole. Chief Wiggum arrests {{him and he}} is imprisoned. While in his cell at the police station, Molloy casually mentions that he assumes Homer and the cops probably {{want to know where}} he hid all of his loot. This piques their interest, and Molloy tells them the stash is hidden under a giant [...] "T" [...] somewhere in Springfield. They all rush out of the station hoping to get the treasure for themselves. In a matter of minutes the entire town hears of the existence of Molloy's stash and <b>almost</b> <b>everybody</b> in Springfield is racing to get there first. After the residents get to the site and dig, they finally discover a box with a note inside. The note tells them that there is no treasure and that while they have been searching, Molloy has escaped from his cell. However, several citizens continue to dig, convinced that a real treasure must be buried deeper.|$|E

But I am worried that on virtually every topic he touches, he reaches conclusions {{radically different from}} <b>almost</b> <b>everybody</b> else. That {{seems to suggest that}} most scientists are wrong, short-sighted, naïve, interested only in securing research funds, or deliberately dancing to the campaigners' tune. Most I know are honest, intelligent and competent. So it beggars belief to suppose that Professor Lomborg is the only one in step, every single time." ...|$|E

60|$|After we {{got rid of}} Colonel No. 2, Marble and I {{continued}} our walk. We passed several {{persons of}} my acquaintance, but not one of them recognised me in my present attire. I was not sorry to see this, as I was wearied of my story, and could gladly remain in a species of incognito, for a few days. But, New York was comparatively a small town in 1804, and <b>everybody</b> knew <b>almost</b> <b>everybody's</b> face who was anybody. There was little real hope, therefore, of my escaping recognition for any great length of time.|$|R

He initially painted genre scenes and conversation pieces, before becoming a specialist drapery painter in the mid-1730s.His works as an independent artist include a view of Covent Garden Market, of which he made at least three versions.

And so would <b>almost</b> <b>everybody</b> that was confronted with the intelligence they got." [...] He also indicated that the lack of focus on post-invasion security was a mistake. He later stated that [...] "knowing what we know now, ...I would not have engaged". [...] "I would not have gone into Iraq", he said. [...] He also argued that the invasion—though perhaps inspired by faulty intelligence—had been beneficial, saying the world was [...] "significantly safer" [...] without Saddam Hussein in power.|$|E
2500|$|Benedict XV was {{a careful}} {{innovator}} by Vatican standards. He {{was known to}} carefully consider all novelties before he ordered their implementation, then insisting on them to the fullest. He rejected clinging to the past for the past's sake with the words [...] "Let us live {{in the present and}} not in history." [...] His relation to secular Italian powers was reserved yet positive, avoiding conflict and tacitly supporting the Royal Family of Italy. Yet, like Pius IX and Leo XIII, he also protested against interventions of State authorities in internal Church affairs. Pope Benedict was not considered a man of letters. He did not publish educational or devotional books. His encyclicals are pragmatic and down-to-earth, intelligent yet at times far-sighted. He remained neutral during the battles of the [...] "Great War," [...] when <b>almost</b> <b>everybody</b> else was claiming [...] "sides." [...] Like that of Pius XII during World War II, his neutrality was questioned by all sides then and even to this day.|$|E

D'Angelo said, [...] "As a primer, however, the film does the job, albeit less thoroughly and with more needless digressions than would even a lengthy magazine article on the subject." [...] The critic thought the documentary easily summarized Fayyad's plan and spent too much time recording the prime minister at photo ops. D'Angelo said, [...] "Ultimately, State 194 wants to rally viewers to the cause of a two-state solution, and that entails glossing over many of the reasons why it hasn't already happened, in spite of it being in <b>almost</b> <b>everybody’s</b> best interest." ...|$|R
60|$|Millicent {{contented}} {{herself with}} a nod. She could not explain {{that in spite of}} the changing mode of thought it is still possible for an old-fashioned landlord to retain <b>almost</b> <b>everybody's</b> good will. Sympathy and tactful advice are appreciated, though not effusively, and even a bluff, well-meant reproof is seldom resented. But when rents are rigorously exacted by a solicitor's or banker's clerk, and repairs are cut down, when indifference takes the place of judicious interest, it is hardly logical to look for the cordial relations that might exist. Nasmyth's tenants stopped and exchanged a cheery greeting or a jest with him; most of Gladwyne's looked grim when he or his friends, the Marples, passed.|$|R
2500|$|The clause was {{included}} {{as part of}} what is known as [...] "The Kitchen Accord". At the end of a conference on the constitution that was poised to end in deadlock, Jean Chrétien, the federal justice minister, as well as Roy McMurtry and Roy Romanow, both provincial ministers, met in a kitchen in the National Conference Centre in Ottawa and sowed the seeds for a deal. This compromise ultimately caused two major changes to the constitution package; the first was that the Charter would include the [...] "notwithstanding clause", and the second was an agreed-upon amending formula. They then worked through the night with consultations from different premiers, and agreement from <b>almost</b> <b>everybody.</b> However, they notedly excluded René Lévesque, the Premier of Quebec, in the negotiations. At any rate, he refused to agree to the deal, and ultimately the Quebec government declined to endorse the constitutional amendment. [...] Chrétien would later say on the notwithstanding clause, [...] "Canada probably wouldn't have had any charter without it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1978, Kramer {{delivered}} {{the final of}} four drafts of a novel that he wrote about the fast lifestyle of gay men of Fire Island and Manhattan. In Faggots, the primary character was modeled on himself, {{a man who is}} unable to find love while encountering the drugs and emotionless sex in the trendy bars and discos. He stated his inspiration for the novel: [...] "I wanted to be in love. <b>Almost</b> <b>everybody</b> I knew felt the same way. I think most people, at some level, wanted what I was looking for, whether they pooh-poohed it or said that we can't live like the straight people or whatever excuses they gave." [...] Kramer researched the book, talking to many men, and visiting various establishments. As he interviewed people, he heard a common question: [...] "Are you writing a negative book? Are you going to make it positive? ... I began to think, 'My God, people must really be conflicted about the lives they're leading.' And that was true. I think people were guilty about all the promiscuity and all the partying." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{town has}} its own newspaper, The Dog River Howler (usually just called [...] "The Howler"), to which <b>almost</b> <b>everybody</b> has contributed {{at one point or}} another. Its {{headlines}} are usually rife with inaccurate, sensationalist reporting. An example of exaggeration can be seen in [...] "Hero Sandwich," [...] in which a proposal to install traffic lights at a four-way intersection prompts the headline [...] "Crosswalk HELL—Mayor Insane." [...] Another example occurs (mentioned in the same episode) when coyotes wander into town to eat cats, prompting the incorrectly spelled headline [...] "Cattle Killed by Werewolfs." [...] An example of simply untrue reporting {{can be seen in the}} first episode, in which a headline reads [...] "Moose Jaw Gets NBA Franchise.", and at an unseen time, they declared that Canada was apparently at war with Switzerland. The paper is also rife with misspellings, for example in the third season that [...] "Hank is PHYCIC (phycic [...] )." [...] (the story was [...] "contunied" [...] on page 30) or in the fourth season that [...] "Cop nabs barely thief" [...] (after Karen mentions that the person who was caught was 'barely a thief' for having stolen a grain truck).|$|E

40|$|For {{the past}} two decades more and more {{universities}} have adopted embedded microprocessors in their Electrical and Computer Engineering Curriculum. The reasons are twofold. First nowadays embedded microprocessors become more and more popular and can be found in <b>almost</b> <b>everybody’s</b> daily lives. Second embedded microprocessors allow more flexibility in low level port accessing and interfacing with other external chips. This paper presents the redevelopment of a junior level introductory microprocessor/microcontroller course, ECE 362 – Microprocessor Systems and Interfacing. The course development transforms the current Intel x 86 family processors to the ARM Cortex microprocessors. The course development includes both the lecture and the laboratory experiments. This transformation is aiming at enhancing the students’ learning objectives with more hands-on experience on interfacing the microprocessor with various peripherals. The learning objectives are mapped into course outcomes for assessment. Students’ course outcome assessment was conducted in the end of the Fall 2014 semester. The assessment results showed that the outcomes were all achieve...|$|R

2500|$|While the anime {{faithfully}} adapts most of {{the characters}} from the manga series, it does make some changes. In the manga, Momiji is half-German and half-Japanese and regularly speaks German, particularly when he first meets Tohru. In the anime, no German is spoken. Shigure's darker side is toned down in the anime; many remarks he makes in the manga that hint at a hidden agenda are left out, along with most of his early scenes with Akito. In the anime, Akito is biologically male and will die {{at a young age}} because of the curse, while in the manga, Akito is biologically female but brought up as male and is not dying. This served as a shocking plot twist in the manga, since <b>almost</b> <b>everybody</b> thought that Akito was male. Additionally, Isuzu [...] "Rin" [...] Sohma, the Horse, and Kureno Sohma, the Rooster, are never mentioned or shown in the anime. Finally, the curse is not lifted in the anime because it only covers the first third of the manga, at the most, and the happy ending does not occur until the series is finished.|$|E

40|$|Automation is a {{trending}} {{topic in the}} 21 st century making it {{play an important role}} in our daily lives. The main attraction of any automated system is reducing human labour, effort, time and errors due to human negligence. With the development of modern technology, smart phones have become a necessity for every person on this planet. Applications are being developed on Android systems that are useful to us in various ways. Another upcoming technology is natural language processing which enables us to command and control things with our voice. Combining all of these, our paper presents a micro controller based voice controlled home automation system using smartphones. Such a system will enable users to have control over every appliance in his/her home with their voice. All that the user needs is an Android smartphone, which is present in <b>almost</b> <b>everybody’s</b> hand nowadays, and a control circuit. The control circuit consists of an Arduino Uno microcontroller, which processes the user commands and controls the switching of devices. The connection between the microcontroller and the smartphone is established via Bluetooth, a widespread wireless technology used for sharing data...|$|R

40|$|The clergy {{abuse scandal}} in the Catholic Church has left its mark on child {{protection}} efforts. It was a major national story about child maltreatment that has dominated the media {{for more than an}} entire year. It has prompted discussions about child exploitation issues in countless homes and organizations. But has it helped the cause of child protection? I do not think the answer is a straightforward yes. The controversy has had a complex kind of impact in the United States, both positive and negative. The scandal certainly kept the child maltreatment topic in the news. The sustaining power of the sexual abuse issue never fails to amaze. Social scientists tend to see public interest in most social problems as reaching some saturation point {{over the course of a}} few years and then subsiding. But sexual abuse keeps managing to reincarnate itself in new guises, just when one thinks it might expire. Before the clergy scandal, backlash concerns seemed to be the major focus in the media. People sensed a negative tide on this issue. But, then ensued, to <b>almost</b> <b>everybody's</b> surprise, a year full of the most credible child maltreatment stories.

5000|$|Walter Kaufmann, on the {{question}} of organisation argued that Hegel's arrangement [...] "over half a century before Darwin published his Origin of Species and impressed the idea of evolution on <b>almost</b> <b>everybody's</b> mind, was developmental." [...] The idea is supremely suggestive but in the end, untenable according to Kaufmann: [...] "The idea of arranging all significant points of view in such a single sequence, on a ladder that reaches from the crudest to the most mature, is as dazzling to contemplate as it is mad to try seriously to implement it". While Kaufmann viewed Hegel as right in seeing that the way a view is reached is not necessarily external to the view itself; since on the contrary a knowledge of the development, including the prior positions, through which a human being passed before adopting a position may make all the difference when it comes to comprehending his or her position, some aspects of the conception are still somewhat absurd and some of the details bizarre. Kaufmann also remarks that the very table of contents of the Phenomenology may be said to 'mirror confusion' and that [...] "faults are so easy to find in it that it is not worth while to adduce heaps of them." [...] However, he excuses Hegel since he understands that the author of the Phenomenology [...] "finished the book under an immense strain".|$|R

After a time, it might be in a week or two, or it might be in a year, the funeral sermon would be preached in the church, and they would go to hear that. Aunt Patsy never finished her crazy quilt, several pieces being wanted to one corner of it; but in the few days preceding her burial two old women of the congregation, with trembling hands and uncertain eyes, sewed in these pieces, and finished the quilt, in which the body of the venerable sister was wrapped, according to her well-known wish and desire. It is customary among the negroes to keep the remains of their friends a very short time after death, but Aunt Patsy had lived so long upon this earth that it was generally conceded that her spirit would not object to her body remaining above ground until all necessary arrangements should be completed, and until all people who had known or heard of her had had an opportunity of taking a last look at her. As she had been so very well known to <b>almost</b> <b>everybody's</b> grandparents, a good many people availed themselves of this privilege.|$|R
