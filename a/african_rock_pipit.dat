50|$|The <b>African</b> <b>rock</b> <b>pipit</b> (Anthus crenatus), {{also known}} as the yellow-tufted pipit, is a species of bird in the family Motacillidae. It is found in the high-altitude, rocky grasslands of South Africa and Lesotho.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian <b>rock</b> <b>pipit</b> {{is closely}} related to the water pipit and the meadow pipit, and is rather similar in appearance. Compared to the meadow <b>pipit,</b> the Eurasian <b>rock</b> <b>pipit</b> is darker, larger and longer-winged than its relative, and has dark, rather than pinkish-red, legs. The water pipit in winter plumage is also confusable with the Eurasian <b>rock</b> <b>pipit,</b> but has a strong {{supercilium}} and greyer upperparts; it is also typically much warier. The Eurasian <b>rock</b> <b>pipit's</b> dusky, rather than white, outer tail feathers are also a distinction from all its relatives. The habitats used by Eurasian <b>rock</b> and water <b>pipits</b> are completely separate in the breeding season, and there is little overlap even when birds are not nesting.|$|R
5|$|The {{water pipit}} {{is a much}} less approachable bird than the Eurasian <b>rock</b> <b>pipit.</b> It is warier than its {{relative}} and if approached it flies some distance before landing again, whereas the <b>rock</b> <b>pipit</b> typically travels only a short distance, close to the ground, before it alights.|$|R
500|$|The Eurasian <b>rock</b> <b>pipit</b> {{is almost}} entirely coastal, frequenting rocky areas {{typically}} below , although on St Kilda it breeds at up to [...] The Eurasian <b>rock</b> <b>pipit</b> is not troubled by wind or rain, although it avoids very exposed situations. It may occur further inland in winter or on migration.|$|R
5|$|The Eurasian <b>rock</b> <b>pipit</b> is a {{much more}} approachable bird than the water pipit. If startled, it flies a fairly short distance, close to the ground, before it alights, whereas its {{relative}} is warier and flies some distance before landing again. Eurasian <b>rock</b> <b>pipits</b> are usually solitary, only occasionally forming small flocks.|$|R
50|$|The Eurasian <b>rock</b> <b>pipit</b> {{is almost}} entirely coastal, frequenting rocky areas {{typically}} below 100 m, although on St Kilda it breeds at up to 400 m.

5|$|The Eurasian <b>rock</b> <b>pipit</b> (Anthus petrosus), or just <b>rock</b> <b>pipit,</b> is {{a species}} of small {{passerine}} bird that breeds in western Europe on rocky coasts. It has streaked greyish-brown upperparts and buff underparts, and is similar in appearance to other European pipits. There are three subspecies, of which only the Fennoscandian form is migratory, wintering in shoreline habitats further south in Europe. The Eurasian <b>rock</b> <b>pipit</b> is territorial {{at least in the}} breeding season, and year-round where it is resident. Males will sometimes enter an adjacent territory to assist the resident in repelling an intruder, behaviour only otherwise known from the African fiddler crab.|$|R
5|$|The Eurasian <b>rock</b> <b>pipit's</b> {{subspecies}} Anthus petrosus littoralis {{in summer}} plumage is particularly close in outward appearance {{to the water}} <b>pipit.</b> The <b>rock</b> <b>pipit</b> normally has a bluer tint to the head, streaking on the breast and flanks, and buff outer tail feathers, and the songs are also different. The species mostly occupy different habitat types even when they occur in the same general area.|$|R
5|$|The Eurasian <b>rock</b> <b>pipit's</b> feeding {{habitat is}} rocky coasts, {{rather than the}} damp {{grassland}} favoured by the water <b>pipit.</b> The Eurasian <b>rock</b> <b>pipit</b> feeds mainly on invertebrates, seeking out most of its prey on foot, only occasionally flying to catch insects. It will venture into shallow water as it follows retreating waves, and may take advantage of human activity that exposes sea slaters or other species that hide under stones.|$|R
50|$|The Eurasian <b>rock</b> <b>pipit</b> is hunted by {{birds of}} prey {{including}} the Eurasian sparrowhawk. As {{with other members of}} its genus, it is a host of the common cuckoo, a brood parasite. Eggs laid by cuckoos that specialise in using pipits as their hosts are similar in appearance to those of the <b>pipit.</b> The Eurasian <b>rock</b> <b>pipit</b> is also a host to the flea Ceratophyllus borealis, and several other flea species in the genera Ceratophyllus and Dasypsyllus. The Eurasian <b>rock</b> <b>pipit</b> can benefit from parasitism of the common periwinkle Littorina littoria by the castrating trematode Parorchis acanthus. Beaches can become attractive where the decline of the periwinkle results in more ungrazed algae, with corresponding increases in invertebrates and a greater diversity of smaller Littorina snails as food for the pipits.|$|R

5|$|The family Motacillidae {{consists}} of the wagtails, pipits and longclaws. The largest of these groups is the pipits in the genus Anthus, which are typically brown-plumaged terrestrial insectivores. Their similar appearances have led to taxonomic problems; the water pipit and the buff-bellied pipit were considered subspecies of the Eurasian <b>rock</b> <b>pipit</b> until they were separated by the British Ornithologists' Union in 1998. The Eurasian <b>rock</b> <b>pipit</b> {{is closely related to}} the meadow, red-throated and rosy pipits as well as its former subspecies.|$|R

Their similar appearances have led to taxonomic problems; the water pipit and the buff-bellied pipit were both formerly considered subspecies of the Eurasian <b>rock</b> <b>pipit.</b> Of these, the <b>rock</b> <b>pipit</b> is the more closely related to the water pipit, based on external and molecular characteristics. Other near relatives are the meadow, red-throated and rosy pipits.|$|R
5|$|Compared to the {{nominate}} form, A. p. kleinschmidti has slightly yellower, less olive, upperparts {{and brighter}} and yellower underparts between the breast streaking. A. p. littoralis may show pinkish underparts and a pale supercilium (eyebrow) in summer, thereby resembling the water <b>pipit.</b> Vagrant Eurasian <b>rock</b> <b>pipits</b> in winter are readily distinguishable from water pipits, but {{very difficult to}} assign to subspecies by appearance or measurements. The western populations {{are known to be}} nearly sedentary, so east of the Elbe basin vagrant Eurasian <b>rock</b> <b>pipits</b> are presumably mostly littoralis.|$|R
5|$|The water pipit's song is {{delivered}} from a perch or in flight, {{and consists of}} four or five blocks, each consisting of about half a dozen repetitions of a different short note. In comparison, the Eurasian <b>rock</b> <b>pipit's</b> song is a sequence of about twenty tinkling cheepa notes followed by a rising series of thin gee calls, and finishing with a short trill. The call of the water pipit is a single or double sharp “dzip” or similar, slightly harsher than soft sip sip sip of the meadow pipit or the shrill pseep of the Eurasian <b>rock</b> <b>pipit.</b> The short, thin fist flight call is intermediate between the sip of the meadow <b>pipit</b> and the <b>rock</b> <b>pipit's</b> feest. The differences between the calls of the pipit species are very subtle, and not diagnostic in the absence of other evidence. The flight call of the subspecies A. s. coutellii is shorter and more buzzing than that of the nominate race.|$|R
5|$|The {{water pipit}} {{is closely related}} to the Eurasian <b>rock</b> <b>pipit</b> and the meadow pipit, and is rather similar to both in appearance. Compared to the meadow pipit, the water pipit is longer-winged and longer-tailed than its relative, and has much paler underparts. It has dark, rather than pinkish-red, legs. The water pipit in winter plumage is also confusable with the Eurasian <b>rock</b> <b>pipit,</b> but has a strong supercilium, greyer upperparts, and white, not grey, outer tail feathers; it is also {{typically}} much warier. The habitats used by Eurasian <b>rock</b> and water <b>pipits</b> are completely separate in the breeding season, and there is little overlap even when birds are not nesting. There is also little mixing with breeding meadow pipits, although since 1960 some overlapping territories have been found where the species coexist.|$|R
500|$|The {{scientific}} {{name of the}} Eurasian <b>rock</b> <b>pipit</b> is from Latin. Anthus is the name given by Pliny the Elder to a small bird of grasslands, and the specific petrosus means [...] "rocky", from petrus, [...] "rock".|$|R
50|$|Several {{other birds}} {{are known to}} use this site {{regularly}} for breeding and these include the tawny owl, sparrowhawk, peregrine, raven and the <b>rock</b> <b>pipit,</b> which is known to breed in only one other site in Cumbria.|$|R

50|$|Peregrine falcons {{have been}} seen flying along the cliffs. Some stonechats and meadow pipits gather on the meadow, while <b>rock</b> <b>pipits</b> move along {{the base of the}} cliffs. House martins make mud nests under the {{overhangs}} of the chalk cliffs.|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} closely related to Eurasian <b>rock</b> <b>pipit</b> (A. petrosus) and water pipit (A. spinoletta), all three forms having {{previously}} been considered conspecific. They can be differentiated by their vocalizations and some visual cues, but <b>rock</b> and buff-bellied <b>pipit</b> are not found sympatrically except as vagrant individuals, and the ranges of buff-bellied and water pipits overlap only in a small area in Central Asia.|$|R
50|$|Amongst {{the visiting}} birds are many {{species that are}} also on the Red List:Osprey, common sandpiper, ruff, redshank, black stork, {{goosander}} and dunlin. Others include: Siskin, <b>rock</b> <b>pipit,</b> Bewick's swan, Whooper swan, hen harrier, little ringed plover, common snipe, smew, common gull, wigeon, pintail, black tern, crossbill and spotted redshank.|$|R

5|$|The Eurasian <b>rock</b> <b>pipit</b> may be hunted by {{birds of}} prey, infested by parasites such as fleas, or {{act as an}} {{involuntary}} host to the common cuckoo, but overall its population is large and stable, and it is therefore evaluated as a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|R
50|$|The long-billed <b>pipit</b> {{or brown}} <b>rock</b> <b>pipit</b> (Anthus similis) is a {{passerine}} bird {{which has a}} wide distribution. A number of subspecies have been created for the populations in Africa, through the Arabian peninsula and South Asia. The systematics of this complex {{is yet to be}} clarified. Most birds are residents or short distance migrants.|$|R
5|$|Adult Eurasian <b>rock</b> <b>pipits</b> have a {{complete}} moult in August–September, at which time juveniles replace their body and some wing covert feathers, giving them an appearance very like the adults. From late January to early March there is a partial moult and individually variable moult of some body and wing covert feathers, and sometimes the central tail feathers.|$|R
5|$|Eurasian <b>rock</b> <b>pipits</b> {{construct}} a cup nest under coastal vegetation or in cliff crevices and lay {{four to six}} speckled pale grey eggs which hatch in about two weeks with a further 16days to fledging. Although insects are occasionally caught in flight, the pipits feed mainly on small invertebrates picked off the rocks or from shallow water.|$|R
5|$|The birds seen on Brean Down include {{peregrine}} falcon, jackdaw, kestrel, collared {{and stock}} doves, common whitethroat, common linnet, stonechat, dunnock, <b>rock</b> <b>pipit</b> and– in 2007 – Britain's {{first and only}} Atlantic yellow-nosed albatross. There are also several species of butterfly, including chalkhill blue, dark green fritillary, meadow brown, marbled white, small heath, and common blue.|$|R

50|$|The strandline is an {{important}} habitat {{for a variety of}} animals. In parts of the United Kingdom, sandhoppers such as Talitrus saltator and the seaweed fly Coelopa frigida are abundant in the rotting seaweed, and these invertebrates provide food for shore birds such as the <b>rock</b> <b>pipit,</b> turnstone and pied wagtail, and mammals such as brown hares, foxes, voles and mice.|$|R
500|$|The first formal {{description}} naming this species was by English naturalist George Montagu in 1798. It {{had previously been}} described in 1766 by Thomas Pennant, in {{the first edition of}} British Zoology, although he did not distinguish it from the common titlark (meadow pipit). It was first shown to be different from that species by John Walcott in the 1789 edition of his Synopsis of British Birds, in which he called it the sea lark. John Latham was the first to give the Eurasian <b>rock</b> <b>pipit</b> a scientific name, Alauda obscura in 1790, but the specimen he examined had been misidentified as to the species and was in fact a dusky lark. In the same year, Montagu, whom Latham had consulted about the bird, discovered the Eurasian <b>rock</b> <b>pipit</b> on the coast of South Wales, where it was known to some fishermen in the region as the [...] "rock lark". He adopted that name for the species and gave it the scientific name Alauda petrosus.|$|R
5|$|Estimates of the {{breeding}} {{population of the}} Eurasian <b>rock</b> <b>pipit</b> vary, but may {{be as high as}} 408,000 pairs, of which around 300,000 pairs are in Norway. Despite slight declines in the British population and some range expansion in Finland, the population is considered overall to be large and stable, and for this reason it is evaluated as a species of least concern by the IUCN.|$|R
5|$|Rare vagrant species {{spotted in}} the area include lesser yellowlegs, white-rumped sandpiper, Pallid Harrier (in spring) and Richard's pipit (in autumn). The birds seen on Brean Down include {{peregrine}} falcon, jackdaw, kestrel, collared and stock doves, whitethroat, linnet, stonechat, dunnock and <b>rock</b> <b>pipit.</b> There are also several species of butterfly, including chalkhill blue, dark green fritillary, meadow brown, marbled white, small heath, and common blue.|$|R
