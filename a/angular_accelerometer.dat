50|$|Yaw dampers usually {{consist of}} a yaw rate sensor (either a {{gyroscope}} or <b>angular</b> <b>accelerometer),</b> a computer/amplifier and a servo actuator. The yaw damper uses yaw rate sensor to sense when the aircraft begins a Dutch roll. A computer processes the signals from the yaw rate sensor to {{determine the amount of}} rudder movement that is required to dampen out the Dutch roll. The computer then commands the servo actuator to move the rudder that amount. The Dutch roll is dampened out and the aircraft becomes stable about the yaw axis. Because Dutch roll is an instability that is inherent to all swept-wing aircraft, most swept-wing aircraft have some sort of yaw damper system installed.|$|E

40|$|With {{the role}} of angular accelerometers in future {{fault-tolerant}} flight control systems, an in-depth evaluation of their performance then becomes a critical issue {{from the perspective of}} control system design. In this paper, a position-based calibration table is utilized to provide a sufficiently accurate angular acceleration reference in the dynamic angular calibration. However, the <b>angular</b> <b>accelerometer</b> measured data contains a high noise level when transmitted through the slip rings. To tackle this issue, a customized sensor Data Acquisition System (DAS) is designed. It is mounted on the turn-table top and has a direct access to the <b>angular</b> <b>accelerometer</b> data channel. To synchronize sensor and table data, two auxiliary signals are generated by the sensor DAS computer to help in the post measurement processing. The first signal is a regular pulse of 100 Hz, which is suitable to align sensor and table data. The second signal is a step function which acts as a data log trigger for the calibration table, as well as a marker of the record starting point. This approach results in a lower <b>angular</b> <b>accelerometer</b> noise level, below the specified limit of 3 mV. The ErrorRMS is 0 : 00195 n, which after being calculated with the measurement results, evidently falls below the Gaussian probability density function specified by the standard of ± 5 : 672.
