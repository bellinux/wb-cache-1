5|$|Agathaeromys is {{characterized}} {{mainly on the}} basis of features of the molar teeth. <b>As</b> <b>usual</b> <b>in</b> muroid rodents, there are three molars {{on both sides of the}} upper jaw (referred to as M1, M2, and M3 from front to back) and lower jaw (referred to as m1, m2, and m3). Agathaeromys is generally similar to other oryzomyines, but differs from other genera in a variety of details of the molar crowns. Agathaeromys donovani (M1 length 2.03–2.84 mm) is substantially larger than A.praeuniversitatis (M1 length 1.77–1.94 mm).|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>usual</b> <b>in</b> oryzomyines, 12 ribs are present. The first rib articulates {{with both}} the last {{cervical}} (neck) and first thoracic (chest) vertebrae, a synapomorphy of the Sigmodontinae. The anapophyses, processes {{at the back of}} vertebrae, are absent from the fifth lumbar. Between the second and third caudal vertebrae, hemal arches (small bones) are present with a spinous back border. The entepicondylar foramen is absent, as in all members of the Sigmodontinae; if present, as in some other rodents, this foramen perforates the distal end of the humerus.|$|E
5|$|Females {{have four}} pairs of mammae, <b>as</b> <b>usual</b> <b>in</b> oryzomyines. Like most rice rats, Transandinomys species have twelve {{thoracic}} (chest) and seven lumbar vertebrae. According {{to a study}} in Costa Rica, T.bolivaris has 58chromosomes {{and the number of}} chromosomal arms (fundamental number) is 80 (2n=58, FN=80). Studies in Ecuador and Venezuela have recorded several different karyotypes in T.talamancae, with the number of chromosomes ranging from 34 to 54 and the fundamental number from 60 to 67.|$|E

5|$|Hipposideros besaoka is an extinct bat from Madagascar in {{the genus}} Hipposideros. It is known from {{numerous}} jaws and teeth, which {{were collected in}} a cave at Anjohibe in 1996 and described as a new species in 2007. The site where H.besaoka was found is at most 10,000 years old; {{other parts of the}} cave have yielded H. commersoni, a living species of Hipposideros from Madagascar, and some material that is distinct from both species. H.besaoka was larger than H.commersoni, making it the largest insectivorous bat of Madagascar, and had broader molars and a more robust lower jaw. <b>As</b> <b>usual</b> <b>in</b> Hipposideros, the second upper premolar is small and displaced from the toothrow, and the second lower premolar is large.|$|E
5|$|The {{mandible}} (lower jaw) is less robust than in T.bolivaris. The coronoid process (a {{process in}} the back part of the bone) is small and the capsular process, which houses {{the root of the}} lower incisor, are small. The mental foramen, located in the diastema between the lower incisor and the first molar, opens towards the side, <b>as</b> <b>usual</b> <b>in</b> oryzomyines. The upper and lower masseteric ridges, which anchor some of the chewing muscles, do not join into a single crest and extend forward to below the first molar.|$|E
5|$|The pieces {{relating}} to Ireland {{are those of}} a public nature; in which the Dean appears, <b>as</b> <b>usual,</b> <b>in</b> the best light, because they do honour to his heart {{as well as to}} his head; furnishing some additional proofs, that, though he was very free in his abuse of the inhabitants of that country, as well natives as foreigners, he had their interest sincerely at heart, and perfectly understood it. His sermon upon Doing Good, though peculiarly adapted to Ireland and Wood's designs upon it, contains perhaps the best motives to patriotism that were ever delivered within so small a compass.|$|E

5|$|The skull is {{delicate}} and lightly built. The rostrum, the front {{part of the}} skull, is narrow and fairly long; it is shorter in eastern voalavo. The narrow zygomatic plate (a plate {{on the side of}} the skull) extends back to about the front of the first upper molar (M1). The zygomatic notch, a notch in the upper part of the zygomatic plate, is small. The zygomatic arches (cheekbones) are narrow, but <b>as</b> <b>usual</b> <b>in</b> nesomyines contain a relatively long jugal bone. The interorbital region (between the eyes) is narrow and short and lacks accessory shelves and ridges. The braincase also lacks such ridges.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>usual</b> <b>in</b> oryzomyines, the molars are pentalophodont (have the mesolophs and mesolophids, {{accessory}} crests, well developed) and bunodont, {{with the}} cusps {{higher than the}} connecting crests. The cusps on the upper molars are arranged in two longitudinal series, not three as in the black and brown rats. The front cusps of the first upper and lower molar (anterocone and anteroconid, respectively) are broad and not divided completely by an anteromedian flexus or flexid. Behind the anterocone, the anteroloph (a smaller crest) is complete and separated from the anterocone. On both {{the second and third}} lower molars, the anterolophid (a crest on the inner front corner) is present, a putative synapomorphy of the genus. The first molars have additional small roots in addition to the main ones, so that the upper first molar has four and the lower has three or four roots.|$|E
5|$|The {{movements}} 1 (Magnificat), 7 (Fecit potentiam) and 12 (Gloria patri) are {{the cornerstones of}} the composition: {{they are}} in the tonic key (E major for BWV 243a, D major for BWV 243), and are the only movements that feature a five-part chorus as well as a tutti orchestra. The chorus also sings in movement 4 (Omnes generationes), accompanied by an orchestra without trumpets and timpani. Each of these four choral movements are, in the version without the Christmas hymns, followed by two movements for a vocal soloist, the second one often with richer scoring. In the movements for vocal soloists the instrumentation is <b>as</b> <b>usual</b> <b>in</b> Bach's cantata's: the soloists are accompanied by an obbligato instrument, only strings and/or continuo. Movement A (Vom Himmel hoch) is the only a cappella movement.|$|E

5|$|The nasal and premaxillary bones do {{not extend}} back beyond {{the point where}} the lacrimal, frontal, and maxillary bones meet. The {{zygomatic}} plate, the flattened front part of the zygomatic arch, is broad and develops a notch at its front end. The plate's back margin is located before the first upper molar. The jugal bone, part of the zygomatic arch, is reduced, <b>as</b> <b>usual</b> <b>in</b> oryzomyines. The sphenopalatine foramen, a foramen (opening) {{at the side of the}} skull above the molars, is small; it is much larger in the marsh rice rat. The narrowest part of the interorbital region is towards the front and the edges are lined by prominent shelves. The parietal bones extend to the sides of the braincase. The interparietal bone is narrow and wedge-shaped, so that the parietal and squamosal bones meet extensively.|$|E
5|$|The upper incisor is opisthodont, {{with the}} cutting edge {{oriented}} backward. <b>As</b> <b>usual</b> <b>in</b> oryzomyines, the molars are brachydont (low-crowned) and bunodont (with the cusps higher than the connecting crests). The first upper molar is narrower than in T.bolivaris. As in this species, but unlike in many other rice rats, including H.alfaroi and E.nitidus, the mesoflexus on the second upper molar, which separates the paracone (one of the main cusps) from the mesoloph (an accessory crest), is not divided in two by an enamel bridge. The hypoflexid on the second lower molar, the main valley between the cusps, is very long, extending more than halfway across the tooth; in this trait, the species is again similar to T.bolivaris but unlike H.alfaroi. Each of the upper molars has three roots (two at the labial, or outer, side and one at the lingual, or inner, side) {{and each of the}} lowers has two (one at the front and one at the back); T.talamancae lacks the additional small roots that are present in various other oryzomyines, including species of Euryoryzomys, Nephelomys, and Handleyomys.|$|E

On the upper third molar, the hypoflexus (which in oryzomyines ranges from a slight indentation on the lingual, or inner, side of the tooth to a conspicuous valley between the main cusps) is more developed in Euryoryzomys than in Transandinomys. The hypoflexid on the second lower molar, the main valley between the cusps, extends more than halfway across the crown; it is much shorter in H.alfaroi, Euryoryzomys, and Hylaeamys yunganus. Each of the upper molars has three roots (two at the labial, or outer, side and one at the lingual, or inner, side) {{and each of the}} lowers has two (one at the front and one at the back); both species of Transandinomys lack the additional small roots that are present in various other oryzomyines, including species of Euryoryzomys, Nephelomys, and Handleyomys.|$|E
