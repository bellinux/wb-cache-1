6000|$|... 'I {{stood with}} the candle, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> liked company, if 'twas only {{a dog or}} cat--maning me; and the chair wouldn't do nohow.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘I said, you know, that I {{should make}} you an {{antidote}} to those black humours; <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> hoped I would consign them to the flames.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|It was Tommy {{who dropped}} her hand first. [...] "Mother," [...] he cried, [...] "your face is wet, you're {{greeting}} sair, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> had forgot the way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your {{daughter}} called <b>you</b> a god <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> that <b>you</b> knew we {{were coming}} to wake you up, which is reading the future," [...] answered Bastin.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, a solicitor; are <b>you?</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> {{last night}} <b>you</b> was commercial! Will you {{be good enough}} to tell us, Mr. Solicitor--for I didn't just catch your name, except that it begins with a dock--and that's where most of your clients are to be found, I suppose--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'but I {{was afraid}} it might {{distress}} him; <b>and</b> as <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> {{would be here}} again soon, Mama, and are the mistress of everything, I determined to take courage and ask you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Percy said I {{could hang}} up the account if I didn't {{want to change the}} bill, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> didn't want to trust any of the young fellows." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You had best {{take a bite}} {{before you}} go," [...] she said. [...] "It's noon now, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> started at daybreak. Always get a meal when you can, say I." ...|$|E
60|$|Algernon. Yes; {{but this}} isn't your {{cigarette}} case. This cigarette {{case is a}} present from some one {{of the name of}} Cecily, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> didn't know any one of that name.|$|E
6000|$|... "You cannot {{think that}} I will accept a compromise. Do you suppose that because I {{am a woman}} I am not made of flesh <b>and</b> blood? <b>You</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> wished to be frank." ...|$|R
60|$|Aca. O, say no more, lest words less kind destroy What {{these have}} raised in me of peace <b>and</b> joy: <b>You</b> <b>said,</b> <b>you</b> did both pity <b>and</b> forgive; <b>You</b> would do neither, should Acacis live. By death alone the certain way appears, Thus to hope mercy, and deserve your tears.|$|R
6000|$|... "It doesn't much matter. <b>You</b> <b>said</b> {{something}} about some property you've got in diamonds, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> once that <b>you</b> must {{go out to}} look after it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And when I {{counted on}} you so, for my tea and {{dinner at the}} club!" [...] {{continued}} Mrs. Dallam. [...] "There were other women dying to come. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> had a headache, and were tired." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Don't {{look at me}} like that, darling; and don't {{shake your}} head so. It is all right! I told you I had my reasons, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> would trust me. I have only done what I thought best!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You have, and yet.... But I don't accuse you, dearest. Yes, {{you have}} given me pleasure. One truly {{pleasant}} time was when we stood together in the summer-house {{on the evening of}} the garden-party, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> liked me to love you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What can {{you want}} better than this?" [...] cried Jock. [...] "By {{the time the}} law {{business}} is over, one may look in vain for such a chance. It is a new country too, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> always <b>said</b> <b>you</b> {{wanted to know how}} those fellows with long-tailed names lived in private life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'What {{have you}} seen?' she cried; and then, as I only pointed to her bonnet, {{she turned to}} <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>said,</b> 'Was it the black dog, father?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{relieves}} me of anxiety, uncle; for {{you know}} you had a letter this morning from Colonel Fitzhugh, {{saying that he had}} been unexpectedly called out of town, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> that <b>you</b> would ask somebody at the club to fill his place, but {{you know you}} very often forget things that you ought to remember." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's all so new to me," [...] pleaded Cleever; [...] "and - <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> {{liked my}} book." [...] - This {{was a direct}} appeal that The Infant could understand, and he began rather flurriedly, with much slang bred of {{nervousness}} - ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'O Frank, {{it is such}} {{a pretty}} dress, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> liked it, and you have to pay for a good cut, and you said {{yourself}} that a wife must not become dowdy after marriage, and it would have cost double as much in Regent Street.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Please, mamma, do tell us {{all about}} it,' said the girl. 'You know I stopped {{directly}} when you made me a sign not to go on asking questions before the little ones. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> should have to make us your friends while papa and the grown-ups are away.' ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{was exactly}} what Arnold was about to do. But it was plain that if he {{admitted}} it just then Sir Patrick (for some unintelligible reason) would decline to listen to him. He answered cautiously, [...] "I asked leave to consult you in private, Sir; <b>and</b> <b>you</b> kindly <b>said</b> <b>you</b> would give me the opportunity before I left Windygates?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Still," [...] persisted Violet, [...] "she nursed {{you when}} you were very ill, <b>and,</b> as <b>you</b> <b>said,</b> set <b>you</b> on your feet again. That would {{probably}} count for a good deal with her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, all <b>you</b> <b>said</b> {{about what}} <b>you</b> saw <b>and</b> heard when <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> were eavesdroppin' {{must have been}} nonsense, you know, for how could <b>you</b> hear <b>and</b> see what {{took place in the}} cave through tons of rock and earth?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There I am {{sure you}} are wronging yourself, Monsieur Fletcher. The Admiral would never have sent you so far, with {{important}} despatches, had he not full confidence that you were wise as well as brave. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> were a chevalier, too. My cousin Antoine looks ever so much older than you do, {{and he has not}} been knighted yet. I know young gentlemen are not made knights, unless they have done something particularly brave." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, {{there is}} not much to look at, Dave, but you have been {{wondering}} ever since you came that you had not come upon any of the gold they must have gathered, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> didn't believe the Indians had taken it away. Now if this was the hut of the leader of the party, it struck me that it would most likely be kept here, and that it may be buried somewhere under this circle of ashes." ...|$|E
60|$|SAVOYARD. Then I went to Vaughan, {{because he}} does music {{as well as the}} drama: <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> thought there would be music. I told him Trotter would feel lonely without him; so he promised like a bird. Then I thought youd like one of the latest sort: the chaps that go for the newest things and swear theyre oldfashioned. So I nailed Gilbert Gunn. The four will give you a {{representative}} team. By the way [looking at his watch] theyll be here presently.|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{that was}} last night," [...] he said, {{in a tone of}} raillery. [...] "I was tired, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> so yourself, <b>you</b> know. But I'm ready to talk now. What shall I tell you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I reckon {{you don't}} {{want to be}} unpopular, do you, uncle? Well, then, don't you put on any exclusiveness in a mining-camp, that's all. The boys admire you; but if you was to leave without taking a drink with them, they'd set you down for a snob. <b>And,</b> besides, <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> had home talk enough in stock to keep us up and at it half the night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh!' he sobbed, 'I cannot bear it! Catherine, Catherine, I'm a traitor, too, and I {{dare not}} tell you! But leave me, and I shall be killed! Dear Catherine, {{my life is}} in your hands: <b>and</b> <b>you</b> have <b>said</b> <b>you</b> loved me, <b>and</b> if <b>you</b> did, it wouldn't harm you. You'll not go, then? kind, sweet, good Catherine! <b>And</b> perhaps <b>you</b> will consent--and he'll let me die with you!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{it would}} be much better if you would not be married," [...] said Celia, drying her eyes, and {{returning}} to her argument; [...] "then there would be nothing uncomfortable. And you would not do what nobody thought you could do. James always said you ought to be a queen; but this is not at all being like a queen. You know what mistakes you have always been making, Dodo, and this is another. Nobody thinks Mr. Ladislaw a proper husband for you. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> would never be married again." ...|$|E
5000|$|After {{a two-day}} trial, the Michigan jury found Kevorkian guilty of second-degree homicide. Judge Jessica Cooper sentenced Kevorkian to serve 10-25 {{years in prison}} and told him: [...] "This is a court of law <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> invited {{yourself}} here to take a final stand. But this trial was not an opportunity for a referendum. The law prohibiting euthanasia was specifically reviewed and clarified by the Michigan Supreme Court several years ago in a decision involving your very own cases, sir. So the charge here {{should come as no surprise}} to you. You invited yourself to the wrong forum. Well, we are a nation of laws, and we are a nation that tolerates differences of opinion because we have a civilized and a nonviolent way of resolving our conflicts that weighs the law and adheres to the law. We have the means and the methods to protest the laws with which we disagree. You can criticize the law, you can write or lecture about the law, you can speak to the media or petition the voters." [...] Kevorkian was sent to a prison in Coldwater, Michigan, to serve his sentence. After his conviction (and subsequent losses on appeal), Kevorkian was denied parole repeatedly until 2007.|$|E
6000|$|... 'He {{said what}} he did because he's a fool, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> what <b>you</b> did because you're very wise and clever--almost too clever to live, unless you're very careful of yourself, Kit.' said Quilp, with great suavity in his manner, but still more of quiet malice about his eyes and mouth. 'Here's sixpence for you, Kit. Always speak the truth. At all times, Kit, speak the truth. Lock the counting-house, <b>you</b> dog, <b>and</b> bring me the key.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I expect {{she feels}} Halliburn's absence a {{positive}} relief,' he <b>said.</b> 'You know <b>you</b> remarked, yourself, {{the last time}} we saw them out, how glum and sulky he looked, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> that if <b>you</b> were in her place you would throw him over without hesitation.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Brice," [...] {{said the}} Southerner, [...] "I want to {{apologize}} for things I've done to <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> about <b>you.</b> I hated you {{for a long time}} after you beat me out of Hester, and--" [...] he hesitated.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{talk about}} the law!" [...] cried Dave. [...] "The law {{will take care of}} you. When I caught you down on Cave Island, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> that <b>you</b> were sorry that you had joined Jasniff in that robbery <b>and</b> that <b>you</b> were going to reform, I felt sorry for you. But you are a faker, Merwell, and I don't believe you ever will reform, and that's the reason I'm going to do my best now to place you {{in the hands of the}} law." ...|$|R
