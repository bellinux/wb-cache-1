25|$|A sign of {{this was}} the {{visibility}} that the hippie subculture gained in various mainstream and underground media. Hippie exploitation films are 1960s exploitation films about the hippie counterculture with stereotypical situations associated with the movement such as cannabis and LSD use, sex and wild psychedelic parties. Examples include The Love-ins, Psych-Out, The Trip, and Wild in the Streets. Other more serious and more critically acclaimed films about the hippie counterculture also appeared such as Easy Rider and Alice's Restaurant. (See also: List of films related to the hippie subculture.) Documentaries and television programs have also been produced until today as well as fiction <b>and</b> <b>nonfiction</b> books. The popular Broadway musical Hair was presented in 1967.|$|E

On {{the strength of his}} book Swish, and his imminent marriage to his fiance Mike, he and Rose were cast. The show filmed from February through May 2010, including Derfner's legal marriage in Iowa, and aired beginning in December 2010. Derfner has since publicly criticized the show's producers for their editing and manipulation of statements and sentiments, which sometimes ended up on air as the opposite of actual fact.|$|E
25|$|Nicolae Batzaria {{eventually}} resettled in Bucharest. He {{embarked on}} a career in writing, publishing a succession of fiction <b>and</b> <b>nonfiction</b> volumes in Romanian. He was, in January 1919, a co-founder of Greater Romania's original journalists' trade union (Union of Professional Journalists), and, in 1921, published his În închisorile turcești with Editura Alcaly. He later produced a series of books detailing {{the lives of women}} in the Ottoman Empire and the modern Turkish state: Spovedanii de cadâne. Nuvele din viața turcească ("Confessions of Turkish Odalisques. Novellas from Turkish Life", 1921), Turcoaicele ("The Turkish Women", 1921), Sărmana Lila. Roman din viața cadânelor ("Poor Leila. A Novel from the Life of Odalisques", 1922), Prima turcoaică ("The First of Turkish Women", n.d.), as well as several translations of foreign books on this subject. One of his stories about Ottoman womanhood, Vecina dela San-Stefano ("The Neighbor of Yeşilköy"), was published by the literary review Gândirea in its June 1922 issue. Around the same time, the Viața Românească publishers issued his booklet România văzută de departe ("Romania Seen from a Distance"), a book of essays which sought to revive confidence and self-respect among Romanian citizens.|$|E

25|$|The Gazettes {{began as}} an experimental, semi-professional, online {{magazine}} featuring fan fiction <b>and</b> <b>nonfiction</b> edited by Flint and (eventually) a volunteer editorial board. At the time of Jim Baen's death {{in the summer of}} 2006 ten Grantville Gazettes were under contract and they had (with some fits and starts) settled into a new version roughly and irregularly three times a year. Baen's production staff was somewhat overworked by the deadline and the serialized magazine gave way to an e-book release from the sixth volume onward—though this was explained by Flint as primarily being due to Flint's other commitments, such as editing the new science fiction magazine Jim Baen's Universe. Earlier on, he'd explained the production delays in terms of overworked proofreaders, executive editors, and so forth. IssuesVI through X, after being released as e-books, seem unlikely to see print; whereas Jim Baen has been releasing (all but the first) issues some months later as hardcover books, the last he bought has yet to appear. Flint has explained that the market for anthologies is always very soft, no matter the genre, and it seems likely that any new print version from the Gazettes will be a Best of The Grantville Gazettes.|$|E
