5|$|A {{number of}} press reports came {{out during the}} Ethics Committee's work that purported to reveal aspects of the {{investigations}}. Chair Heflin was upset by the leaks and two investigations into them were held, one by the General Accounting Office {{acting on behalf of}} the committee and one by the Senate's Temporary Special Independent Counsel. Neither report reached a conclusive finding or directly implicated anyone in the leaks. The special counsel report, released in 1992, ascribed partisanship as the motive for the leaks <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> intended to hurt DeConcini, Riegle, and Cranston; it also gave an inference that McCain and his staff were responsible for key leaks.|$|E
5|$|Tamarod and Al Wefaq {{opposition}} society {{praised the}} protests <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> successful. The government of Bahrain however said protests {{did not affect}} everyday life. The United States said it supported freedom of expression and assembly, and voiced its concern at the chances of violence. Analysts were divided between those who expected protests to be huge and those that did not see them having any chance. They were also divided about the reasons behind the absence of mass protests in Manama, some blaming it on the security forces, others on protest organizers.|$|E
5|$|In April, {{the band}} began demoing material, <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> aiming {{to release a}} new album later in the year. In August, the band {{announced}} they would be recording in a few weeks' time, and were aiming for a spring 2011 release. After some shows in the summer, the band began recording in October. Eric Valentine produced the sessions at Barefoot Recording in Hollywood, California. Valentine also engineered the sessions with assistance from Cian Riordan. The band used Undertone Audio Consoles during recording. At the start of recording, the group had 18 songs. They whittled this number down little by little, and wrote additional songs at Robert Lang Studios in Seattle, Washington. The drums tracks were completed in early October.|$|E

5|$|On October 14, 1853, {{following}} the National Woman's Rights Convention held in Cleveland, Ohio, Stone and Lucretia Mott addressed Cincinnati’s first women’s rights meeting, arranged by Henry Blackwell, a local businessman {{from a family}} of capable women, who had taken an interest in Stone. After that successful meeting, Stone accepted Blackwell's offer to arrange a lecturing tour for her in the western states – considered then to be those west of Pennsylvania and Virginia. Over the following thirteen weeks, Stone gave over forty lectures in thirteen cities, during which a report to the New York Tribune said she was stirring the West on women’s rights “as it is seldom stirred on any subject whatsoever.” After four lectures in Louisville, Stone was begged to repeat the entire course and told she was having more effect there than she could have anywhere else. An Indianapolis newspaper reported that Stone “set about two-thirds {{of the women in the}} town crazy after women’s rights and placed half the men in a similar predicament.” St. Louis papers said her lectures attracted the largest crowds ever assembled there, filling the city’s largest auditorium beyond its capacity of two thousand. Chicago papers praised her lectures as the best of the season, <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> inspiring discussion and debate in the city’s homes and meeting places. When Stone headed home in January, 1854, she left behind incalculable influence.|$|E
25|$|Five days later, the Los Angeles Times named Presser as a U.S. {{government}} criminal informant. The report quoted unnamed FBI officials, {{making this}} the first time that government leaders had confirmed the unverified accusations of mob informants and other reports. Both the FBI and Presser declined to refute the allegations, although FBI officials publicly complained about the report <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> concerned for Presser's safety.|$|E
25|$|Virgin Media and the BPI denied {{reports of}} any {{agreement}} or pilot scheme <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> only in {{talks on the}} matter. However, {{at least one person}} claimed to have received a letter threatening disconnection. Although the UK government backed plans to ban p2p users from the internet, it may soon be overturned by strong condemnation from the European Parliament on the grounds of privacy issues and the importance of internet access.|$|E

25|$|Ronald Lauder, {{writing in}} the German {{newspaper}} Die Welt, called for Israel to be admitted into the Western alliance NATO: “Israel needs real guarantees for its security. European NATO member states – including Turkey – must admit the state of Israel into the Western alliance,” the WJC president wrote. He referred to the uprisings in Egypt and Tunisia <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> reminders of how “unpredictable” developments in the Middle East were. Israeli NATO membership “would send a strong signal to other countries not to take on Israel”, Lauder argued.|$|E
25|$|The {{residents}} {{alleged that}} the police were corrupt and were paid to conceal information. Demands were made for an independent probe into the matter. One of the residents asserted {{that the police were}} claiming credit for discovering the bodies when it was the residents who dug them up. The police denied having found fifteen bodies. They reiterated that they had discovered skulls, bones and other body parts, <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> unable to give a figure for the number of victims. The victims' identities and number could only be established with DNA tests. The police then sealed the house and did not allow news media anywhere near the site.|$|E
25|$|Researchers {{found that}} having an older sibling, {{especially}} an older brother, affected how girls viewed sex and sexuality. Girls with older brothers held more traditional views about sexuality <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> {{less interested in}} seeking sex, as well as less interested responding to the sexual advances of boys compared with girls with no older siblings. Researchers believe this is because older siblings model gender roles, so girls with older siblings (especially brothers) may have more traditional views of what society says girls and boys should be like; girls with older brothers may believe that sexual intercourse is mostly for having children, rather than for gaining sexual pleasure. This traditional view can inhibit them from focusing on their own sexualities and desires, and may keep them constrained to society’s prescribed gender roles.|$|E

500|$|Protesters at the {{demonstration}} wore masks, <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> attempting {{to inform the}} public about what they believed to be [...] "restrictions of free speech and profiteering through pyramid schemes" [...] by the Church of Scientology. They asserted they were not protesting the doctrine of Scientology, but rather alleged actions of individual Scientologists. One protester stated that he had created a Facebook group to organize the protest, explaining [...] "It started online with a group called Anonymous ...

500|$|Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights {{expressed}} its {{concern at}} what it called [...] "violations" [...] against the Bahrain Thirteen. The Al Wefaq political party said that the sentences were hindering efforts at dialogue and damaging the country's international reputation. It rejected the appeal sentence <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> contradictory to solving the crisis. The Bahraini Press Association described the verdict as [...] "unfair and outrageous" [...] and [...] "marred by abuses and violations of all legal and human rights standards". Human rights lawyer Mohamed al-Tajer said the appeal verdict was [...] "shocking" [...] and that [...] "he judge dismissed the appeal". In an op-ed in Al Wasat, Kassim Hussain argued that the most remembered words about the case of Bahrain Thirteen would be Ibrahim Sharif's words: [...] "These [...] trials are trials of ideas".|$|E
500|$|The single, [...] "Say I", is an {{inspirational}} and motivational record; Milian {{wanted to make}} a record that would be an inspiration to both her and her fans. Focusing on an urban audience, Milian said the record was [...] "way more an urban record than anything I've ever done." [...] The singer felt it was necessary to have Young Jeezy feature because he spoke for the streets, and thought his rap was [...] "a very real message. It pertained to his life." [...] The track, [...] "Twisted", {{was one of the first}} songs recorded for the album. Lyrically, the song is about liking someone so much that you [...] "can't even go about [...] day in a normal way".

500|$|Secret Service {{and other}} {{authorities}} {{said they were}} treating the plot very seriously, but acknowledged it {{did not appear to}} have moved to an advanced stage. Authorities said there {{did not appear to be}} any formal assassination plan <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> unable to immediately assess how capable the men were of carrying out the attack. Federal authorities told the Associated Press they did not believe Schlesselman and Cowart had the means to carry out their threat. Barack Obama did not have any campaign appearances planned for Tennessee. One federal law enforcement official told the AP that [...] plans did not include Obama's schedule or a specific time and place for the assassination because, [...] "I don't think they had that level of detail." [...] Authorities said they made several mistakes during their planning, including drawing too much attention to themselves with their car markings. Authorities also felt their inability to carry out a home robbery together indicated they would be unable to carry out a sophisticated assassination plot. When asked whether the alleged threats were real, Daniel Cowart's lawyer, Joe H. Byrd, told reporters, [...] "White top hats and tuxedos? You tell me." ...|$|E

He thought they could be caused by air currents from the impact, since they led towards the crater.
