50|$|MAgPIE takes four {{different}} cost types into account: production costs for crop and livestock production, investments in technological change, land conversion costs and intra-regional transport costs. By minimizing these four cost components {{on a global}} scale for the current time step, the model solution is obtained. Production costs in MAgPIE imply costs for labor, capital and intermediate inputs. They are specific for all crop and livestock types and are implemented as costs per area for crops (US$/ha) and costs per production unit of livestock (US$/ton). MAgPIE has two options to increase total production in agriculture at additional costs: land expansion and intensification. In MAgPIE the latter can be achieved by investments in technological change (TC). Investing in technological change triggers yield increases which lead then to a higher total production. At the same time the corresponding increases in <b>agricultural</b> <b>land-use</b> intensity raises costs for further yield increases. The reason is that intensification on land which is already used intensively is more expensive than intensification on extensively-used land.To increase production another alternative is to expand cropland into non-agricultural land. The conversion causes additional costs for the preparation of new land and basic infrastructure investments, which are also taken into account. Intraregional transport costs arise for each commodity unit {{as a function of the}} distance to intraregional markets and therefore restrict land expansion in MAgPIE. This depends on the quality and accessibility of infrastructure. Intra-regional transport costs are higher for less accessible areas than for more accessible regions. This leads to higher overall costs of cropland expansion in those cases.|$|E

These activities can be summarized as <b>agricultural</b> <b>land-use</b> intensity. We present a measure, called the tau-factor, which is an alternative to current measures for <b>agricultural</b> <b>land-use</b> intensity. The tau-factor is the ratio between actual yield and a reference yield under well defined management and technology conditions. By taking this ratio, the physical component (soils, climate), which is equal in both terms, is removed. We analyze global patterns of <b>agricultural</b> <b>land-use</b> intensity for 10 world regions and 12 crops, employing reference yields as computed with a global crop growth model for the year 2000. We show that parts of Russia, Asia and especially Africa had low <b>agricultural</b> <b>land-use</b> intensities, whereas the Eastern US, Western Europe and parts of China had high <b>agricultural</b> <b>land-use</b> intensities in 2000.

Discussion [...] 5. Conclusion. The impacts of intensive agriculture on underlying groundwater ecosystems {{are not yet}} fully understood, although agricultural practices are firmly implicated in the modification of stygofauna (invertebrate) and microbial populations in aquifers, primarily through changes in water quality associated with irrigated agriculture. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine how biological communities in groundwater vary with agricultural land use, and along environmental gradients. Biological and environmental samples were collected from groundwater under irrigated agricultural landscapes and pasture in the Condamine Catchment (QLD), and Gwydir Catchment (NSW). Bacterial populations were evaluated through the analysis of high-throughput 16 S rDNA sequence data. The findings of this study did not support the hypothesis that stygofauna distributions vary with <b>agricultural</b> <b>land-use.</b> Molecular data did not support a relationship between microbial distributions and <b>agricultural</b> <b>land-use.</b> Microbial assemblages became more dissimilar with increasing geographic distance. Microbial and stygofauna distributions were poorly correlated with groundwater chemistry gradients. In summary, the influence of agriculture on stygofauna community structure is likey to be limited, since their distributions in the landscape are largely defined by physical limitations of the alluvial aquifer environment. In contrast, the influence of <b>agricultural</b> <b>land-use</b> on groundwater quality is likely to have a quantifiable bearing on microbial distributions, although evidence to support this hypothesis was not forthcoming from the environmental and molecular analysis here. To assess the hypothesis that microbial communities differ with <b>agricultural</b> <b>land-use,</b> further studies should use a metagenomic sequencing approach to estimate the relative abundance of microbes between sites.

Our study analyses major cost positions in implementing such projects, particularly the expense of changing or abandoning <b>agricultural</b> <b>land-use</b> for conservation purposes.

This {{paper is}} focused on the {{application}} of linear programming (LP) in combination with a geographic information system (GIS) in planning <b>agricultural</b> <b>land-use</b> strategies. One of the essential inputs for planning any <b>agricultural</b> <b>land-use</b> strategy is a knowledge of the natural resources. This is even more critical in small countries such as those in the Eastern Caribbean, where land-area limitations dictate a greater need for careful assessment and management of these resources. The first step of the proposed methodology is to obtain an assessment of the natural resources available to agriculture. The GIS is used to delineate land-use conflicts and provide reliable information on the natural-resource database. This is followed by combining the data on natural resources with other quantifiable information on available labour, market forecasts, technology, and cost information in order to estimate the economic potential of the agricultural sector. LP is used in this step. Finally, the GIS is applied again to map the crop and land-allocation patterns generated by the LP model.

Understanding these impacts is extremely important given the rapid projected expansion of oil palm cultivation in the basin.

We carried out bird surveys in oil palm plantations of varying ages, primary and secondary forests, and cattle pastures.

Native understorey vegetation richness had the strongest independent effect on the richness, abundance and composition of all fruit-feeding butterflies, as well as a subset of species that had been recorded in nearby primary forests. However, overall patterns were strongly influenced by the most abundant subfamily (Satyrinae), and vegetation richness was not related to the abundance of any other subfamily, or non-Satyrinae species, highlighting the importance of disaggregating the fruit-feeding Nymphalidae when examining butterfly-environment relationships.

This paper compares modelled potential evapotranspiration (PET) and measured actual evapotranspiration (AET) values {{obtained from the}} soil weighing lysimeters, and determines the spatial variability in riparian zone AET in a multiple <b>land-use</b> <b>agricultural</b> watershed in Southern Ontario. Two sites were chosen in two different riparian areas of the watershed, representing the surface conditions dominant in {{the upper and lower}} reaches of the basin. The results indicated that AET was higher in the northern end of the basin than in the southern portion of the basin, while the hydrological and energy balance components were similar at both sites. The causes of the different rates are attributed to the surrounding vegetation on adjacent fields and the differing wind regimes...|$|R
