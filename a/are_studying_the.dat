25|$|Each launch system {{incorporates}} three rails, i.e. {{one system}} carries three missiles. This allows a single aircraft to carry {{large numbers of}} missiles; for example, a Typhoon could carry up to six launch systems, one each on six individual pylons, which gives a maximum payload of eighteen Brimstone missiles, {{in addition to a}} useful air-to-air payload. The missile is carried by the Tornado GR4 in RAF service. In February 2014 the National Audit Office warned of a possible capability gap under existing plans to fit Brimstone to Typhoon in 2021, two years after the Tornado retired; in June 2014 the MoD announced a study to accelerate this to 2018 and look at a common launcher that could also launch SPEAR Cap 3. MBDA have fired test rounds from an MQ-9 Reaper and <b>are</b> <b>studying</b> <b>the</b> use of Brimstone on attack helicopters and from surface launchers. Both the US and France have expressed interest in buying it for their aircraft.|$|E
25|$|There {{are eight}} {{boarding}} houses, nine {{including the one}} no longer in operation, on the campus. The houses are run by a small team of teachers. The House Master (HM) has overall responsibility and is helped by the Assistant House Master (AHM). Either or both of these will be present at the daily house meeting and will oversee homework to make sure pupils <b>are</b> <b>studying.</b> <b>The</b> HM will organise any special house events, decide who the house captain {{will be for the}} term as well as choosing a captain to take care of other house related goings on. The HM is also the person who most pupils would talk to if they had a problem although all teachers are available for help. Both the HM and the AHM normally have residences within the houses and so are very much part of the house. Each house has a matron who helps the pupils through their daily routine as well as a tutor to help the pupils in their studies. The year a pupil is in, and the amount of rooms in the house decides which pupils are allowed a room of their own, although it is normally decided that younger years share whilst senior pupils get their own rooms. All pupils rotate rooms each term.|$|E

2500|$|The Miranda {{character}} receives {{negative comments}} to her videos from viewers who are {{fooled by the}} character and {{believe that they are}} watching a serious video by a bad entertainer. Ballinger told Backstage: [...] "It's sort of like an Andy Kaufman thing. You wouldn't believe the hate mail. ... You would never say that stuff to someone's face, but you can type anything online." [...] TheaterJones commented that [...] "perhaps because the Internet is some crazy postmodern distortion of reality, people ... felt it was their duty to point out how woefully untalented [...] was, in the most horrific ways. ... Her hate mail, which she reads some of on stage, is an art form all its own." [...] Ballinger noted: [...] "The whole reason Miranda went viral is because people were making fun of how stupid it was. If I didn't get hate mail, I wouldn't have a job." [...] The online critics were so harsh that Miranda became a [...] "hero of the anti-bullying movement". Her young fans find the character empowering because they see, perhaps selectively, [...] "a conservatively attired girl who does what she likes, gets lots of attention and has bottomless self-esteem." [...] Miranda also teaches that [...] "Popular girls don’t have to be stylish. ... Fear no one. ... It's [...] to be cranky." [...] An article at The Conversation observed that some YouTubers [...] "use humour and satire to challenge ideas of popular femininity. ... Miranda Sings... puts on monstrous makeup to perform parody music videos [...] being conventionally pretty." [...] Fans of the character who <b>are</b> <b>studying</b> <b>the</b> performing arts say that Miranda is [...] "a role model and a 'strong woman in comedy'" [...] that inspires confidence in their performance and social skills.|$|E
2500|$|Feminism's {{effect on}} {{polygyny}} in Islam {{is different in}} every Muslim society, depending on the different cultures that are interacting with Islam in each location. [...] For example, in Iran, changes to women's rights occurred {{in the wake of}} the Islamic Revolution in 1979. [...] During this revolution the Family Protection Law, which had given some power to women and imposed minimal restrictions on polygyny, was overturned. [...] Muslim women were encouraged to return to their traditional roles. [...] This loss of rights led to the movement realizing that they could not necessarily rely on the government alone to protect their rights. [...] This spurred the creation of the personal status laws, which covered many issues relating to marriage and divorce including polygyny. Passed in 1986, the law [...] "effectively reinstates the provision of the 1975 Family Protection Law granting a wife the right to obtain a divorce if her husband marries a second woman without the wife's permission of if…a man does not treat his wives fairly and equally." [...] This offers Iranian Muslim women some legal protection against polygyny, but the enforcement of the law is still up to the interpretation of the courts. [...] Muslim women's movement organizations have begun to gain more power in Iran due to the increasing number of Muslim women who <b>are</b> <b>studying</b> <b>the</b> Qur'an analytically. [...] These new scholars are able to argue for interpretations of Islam that empower rather than oppress women. [...] They also lead organizations like the Association of Muslim Women and Zeynab. [...] Many Muslim women also go jalasehs where they can openly discuss religious texts in a safe environment. So even though the revolution attempted to reinstate many patriarchal values, like unlimited polygyny, it ended up inspiring women to push for more rights and become more credible by studying religious texts.|$|E
