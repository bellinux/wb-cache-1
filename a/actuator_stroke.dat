40|$|The {{advantages}} of using piezoelectric actuators in ultra-precision applications are often impaired by nonlinear effects, in particular hysteresis, which {{may lead to}} positioning uncertainties of up to 15 % of the <b>actuator's</b> <b>stroke.</b> Model-based compensation strategies are often prescribed in order to overcome this limitation and achieve better dynamical accuracy. This comes, however, {{at the expense of}} increasing identification and implementation complexity, especially when hysteresis is of the asymmetric type, such as prevalent in hard piezoceramic materials. This paper proposes a new compensation strategy based upon (i) treating hysteresis as being separate from other dynamical effects and (ii) formulating a new, simplified model to deal with asymmetric hysteresis, based on applying a linear operator to the conventional hysteresis models. After developing the theoretical background of the compensation strategy, the accuracy improvement due to the new hysteresis-compensation method is demonstrated experimentally. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Abstract—A new {{decoupled}} track-seeking controller for a dualstage {{servo system}} of a magnetic disk drive has been developed. The controller {{is applied to}} the dual-stage system with a push-pull piezoelectric (PZT) micro-actuator and enables high-speed onetrack seeking and short-span track seeking. A one-track seeking controller was designed in three steps: 1) a voice coil motor (VCM) feedforward controller was designed to prevent overshoot in response of VCM actuator; 2) a feedforward loop from the VCM reference signal to the PZT actuator was designed in order to decouple the dual-stage actuator system; 3) a feedforward controller for the PZT actuator was designed such that an output PES (position error signal) only follows a PES reference signal. In the design of the short-span seeking controller, the PZT <b>actuator’s</b> <b>stroke</b> limit was considered. Simulations and experiments show that the proposed dual-stage track-seeking controller performs better than the conventional single VCM servo.

40|$|A {{new design}} for a {{multi-layer}} dielectric elastomer actuator, reinforced with periodic stiffeners is presented. The resulting actuator enables complex out-of- plane motion without the need of the elastomer membrane prestretch. An in situ optical imaging system is used to capture the complex deformation pattern and track the non-planar displacement and curvature under the applied voltage. The role of the stiffeners periodicity, φ, on the macroscopic actuator response is analyzed numerically utilizing ABAQUS finite element software. A user-material subroutine is developed to represent the elastomer deformation under the applied electric field. It is found that the actuator force-stroke characteristics can be greatly changed by varying φ, while maintaining the same overall actuator stiffness. The numerical results showed a band of localized deformation around the stiffeners. The refinement of the stiffener, φ, increases the total actuated volume within the span of the actuator, and thereby the macroscopic <b>actuator</b> <b>stroke.</b> The stored elastic strain energy within the actuator is also increased. φ might be further refined down to the actuator sheet thickness, wherein the localized deformation bands overlaps.

An ATMD is discussed as a potential solution for increasing the operational envelope from original frequency requirements of [50 ± 0. 5 Hz] to the new range while maintaining vibration amplitudes below 20 µm.

40|$|As the {{performance}} of coronagraphs improves, the achievable contrast {{is more and more}} dependent of the shape of the pupil. The future generation of space and ground based coronagraphic instruments will have to achieve high contrast levels on on-axis and/or segmented telescopes. To correct for the high amplitude aberrations introduced by secondary mirror structures and segmentation of the primary mirror, we explore a two deformable mirror (DM) method. The major difficulty of several DM methods is the non-linear relation linking <b>actuator</b> <b>strokes</b> to the point spread function in the coronagraph focal plane. The Active Compensation of Aperture Discontinuities (ACAD) method is achieving this minimization by solving a non linear differential Monge Ampere equation. Once this open loop method have reached the minimum, a close-loop stroke minimization method can be applied to correct for phase and amplitude aberrations to achieve the ultimate contrast.

Runtime: 58 : 28 minutesHumankind has {{had little}} success in replicating the wondrous {{properties}} of natural muscle, which has meant that the most advanced prosthetic limbs, exoskeletons, and humanoid robots lack critically needed capabilities. Use of electrical input power, instead of nature’s choice of high energy density fuel, {{is a problem for}} autonomous operation, which severely limits operational lifetime between recharge. Another problem is the inability to crowd sufficient motors into available space to provide natural movement.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} of real-time control of a morphing wing based on a coupled fluid-structure numerical model. The 2 D extrados profile of an experimental laminar wing is morphed with the purpose to reduce drag, through extension of the laminar flow over the upper wing surface. As a first step, the active structure has been modeled, manufactured and experimentally tested under variable flow conditions in a subsonic wind tunnel (the Mach number ranges from 0. 2 to 0. 3 and the angle of attack from 2 ̆ 21210 to 20). In this work, a real-time closed-loop control strategy is designed to find the optimum <b>actuator</b> <b>strokes</b> using an experimentally measured lift-to-drag ratio (feedback parameter). An extensive wind-tunnel characterization of the laminar wing prototype has been performed to design the algorithm and {{to set up the}} parameters. To calculate the initial <b>strokes</b> of the <b>actuators</b> and thus to accelerate the optimization procedure, a validated ANSYS-XFoil coupled fluid-structure numerical model is used. The robustness and efficiency of the developed real-time control system is tested under two flow conditions.

The proposed control strategy appears to be well suited to benefit from the complete morphing potential (according to the lift-to-drag ratio) of the wind tunnel prototype although higher feedback resolution is recommended from the numerical simulation algorithms.

40|$|In {{the field}} of planet and proto-planetary disk detection, {{achieving}} high angular resolution and high dynamic range is a necessity. Coronography coupled with adaptive optics on Hubble Space Telescope {{is a way to}} get both good spatial resolution and high dynamic range. However, because of the residual figure errors on the primary and on the secondary, HST has a scattered light level that prevents it from detecting extra-solar planets. Our simulations show that by using an active mirror (400 - 1000 actuators) in the optical path of HST with adaptive optics, we can correct the mirror errors and decrease the scattering level by a factor 10 ^ 2 (from 10 ^- 4 to 10 ^- 6 fainter than the star). Furthermore, by controlling the spatial frequencies of the active mirror with a dark hole algorithm we can decrease the scattering level in image zones where planet detection is likely. Using this technique, we have succeeded in decreasing the scattering level to 3 × 10 ^- 8 of the star intensity within 1 arcsec from the central star. This will allow the detection of a Jupiter-like planet 10 ^- 9 times dimmer than the central star located 10 pc away in 1 hour of integration time with a signal-to-noise ratio of 5.
