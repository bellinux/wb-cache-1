5|$|Mrs. Tiggy-winkle {{has been}} {{described}} as one of Potter's most positive creations, but critics consider Lucie an artistic failure. Although Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle is set in an identifiable place and time period, the tale is mythologized by reaching back to <b>an</b> <b>age</b> <b>when</b> household chores were performed manually and without the aid of modern mechanical inventions. The simple dwellings, rustic pathways, and stone fences enhance the tale's timeless aspect and suggest an unchanging countryside and its way of life.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to game, mutton was consumed {{from time to}} time. Keeping sheep provided wool to the household, and when a sheep reached <b>an</b> <b>age</b> <b>when</b> it was unsuitable for wool production, it could be harvested as mutton. Sheep were originally introduced to the Americas through the Spanish in Florida. In the north, the Dutch and English also introduced several varieties of sheep. The casual English practice of animal husbandry allowed sheep to roam free, consuming a variety of forage. Foragebased diets produce meat with a characteristically strong, gamey flavor and a tough consistency, which requires aging and slow cooking to tenderize.|$|E
5|$|In 1678, Ashmole {{stood as}} a {{candidate}} in a by-election for the Lichfield borough parliamentary constituency caused {{by the death of}} one of the two incumbent members. During Ashmole's campaign his cousin, Thomas Smalridge, who was acting as a kind of campaign manager, fell ill and died. Ashmole did not visit the constituency, and, as Ashmole's own horoscope had predicted, he lost the election. He also put himself forward {{as a candidate}} in the general election of 1685. Surviving documents indicate that he was the most popular candidate, but after King James II requested he stand down (in <b>an</b> <b>age</b> <b>when</b> monarchs were likely to interfere with parliamentary elections), Ashmole did so. On election day, all the votes cast for Ashmole, instead of being declared invalid, were declared as votes for the King's candidate, and only {{as a result of this}} ruse was the candidate favoured by the Court (Richard Leveson) elected.|$|E

25|$|In <b>an</b> <b>age</b> <b>when</b> feudalism was {{embedded}} in religion, with every man having a lord above him, a king over the lords and God over all, the Frisian freedoms {{were seen as}} a sort of anarchy, or worse, a rebellion against God's will, and scandalised the rest of Europe.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, {{less than}} six months before his first {{positive}} drug test, Christie won a libel action against the journalist John McVicar. McVicar had insinuated in a satirical magazine that Christie's remarkable rise from 156th in the world to triumph at <b>an</b> <b>age</b> <b>when</b> he should have been in decline could only have been achieved through performance-enhancing drugs.|$|E
25|$|There is {{also the}} {{question}} as to whether having children really is such a positive contribution to the world in <b>an</b> <b>age</b> <b>when</b> there are many concerns about overpopulation, pollution and depletion of non-renewable resources. Some critics counter that such analyses of having children may understate its potential benefits to society (e.g. a greater labor force, which may provide greater opportunity to solve social problems) and overstate the costs. That is, there is often a need for a non-zero birth rate.|$|E

25|$|Amongst {{his daughters}} Swarnakumari Devi (1855–1932) was a gifted writer, editor, song-composer and social worker. She was editor of Bharati, a {{remarkable}} accomplishment in <b>an</b> <b>age</b> <b>when</b> very few girls went to school. She also edited a children's magazine Balak and developed Sakhi Samiti {{as a means}} for improving the lives of women. She was the author of several books. Her husband Janakinath Ghosal was {{one of the founders of}} the Indian National Congress, so she participated in nationalist activities with him.|$|E
25|$|Former {{students}} of Hindu College were strongly {{in favour of}} Thomas Babington Macaulay’s move for western education. They even went {{to the extent of}} supporting his theory, expounded in 1835, “I am quite ready to take oriental learning at the valuation of orientalists themselves. I have never found one among them, who could deny that that a single shelf of a good European library was worth the whole native literature of India and Arabia.” That was <b>an</b> <b>age</b> <b>when</b> India’s past was still to be fully realised.|$|E
25|$|Her {{writing is}} simple and elegant. She {{published}} her first collection of verses Alo Chhaya in 1889, and two more books after that but then took a break from writing for several years following her marriage and motherhood. She was a feminist at <b>an</b> <b>age</b> <b>when</b> merely getting educated was a taboo for a woman. She picked up the cue for feminism from a fellow student of Bethune School, Abala Bose. In an address delivered at a girls' school in Calcutta she declared that the aim of women's education was to contribute to their all-round development and fulfillment of their potential.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} prolific, versatile, and {{universal}} composers of the late Renaissance, Lassus wrote over 2,000 works in all Latin, French, Italian and German vocal genres known in his time. These include 530 motets, 175 Italian madrigals and villanellas, 150 French chansons, and 90 German lieder. No strictly instrumental music by Lassus is known to survive, or ever to have existed: an interesting omission for a composer otherwise so wide-ranging and prolific, during <b>an</b> <b>age</b> <b>when</b> instrumental music was becoming an ever-more prominent means of expression, all over Europe. The German music publisher Adam Berg dedicated 5 volumes of his Patrocinium musicum (published from 1573–1580) to Lassus' music.|$|E
25|$|Pinchot {{sought to}} turn public land policy from one that {{dispersed}} resources among private holdings, {{to one that}} maintained federal ownership and management of public land. As a progressive, Pinchot strongly believed in the efficiency movement. Waste was his great enemy, and he well knew {{the tragedy of the}} commons, the destruction of resources for short-term gains. His successes, in part, were grounded in the personal networks that he started developing as a student at Yale and continued developing throughout his career. His personal involvement in the recruitment process led to high morale in the Forest Service and allowed him to avoid partisan political patronage. Pinchot capitalized on his professional expertise to gain adherents in <b>an</b> <b>age</b> <b>when</b> professionalism and science were greatly valued.|$|E
25|$|He {{spent most}} of his career at the newly founded Dominican priory at Hereford. The Dominicans had been {{fighting}} for a foothold here for eighty years against the resistance of the Dean and Chapter, before they were finally established under the patronage of Edward II in 1322. Bromyard must therefore have been among the first friars to join the fledgeling priory. In <b>an</b> <b>age</b> <b>when</b> manuscript books were prohibitively expensive, it is likely that he embarked on the task of compiling preaching aids as a means of providing the priory with a library to support its preaching mission. The sheer volume of his work suggests that it may well have been produced by a collaborative process involving the other friars at the Hereford priory, with Bromyard acting as editor in chief.|$|E

25|$|On {{his return}} to Rome, he was elected {{military}} tribune, {{a first step in}} a political career. He was elected quaestor for 69 BC, and during that year he delivered the funeral oration for his aunt Julia, and included images of her husband Marius in the funeral procession, unseen since the days of Sulla. His wife Cornelia also died that year. Caesar went to serve his quaestorship in Spain after her funeral, in the spring or early summer of 69 BC. While there, he is said to have encountered a statue of Alexander the Great, and realised with dissatisfaction that he was now at <b>an</b> <b>age</b> <b>when</b> Alexander had the world at his feet, while he had achieved comparatively little. On his return in 67 BC, he married Pompeia, a granddaughter of Sulla, whom he later divorced in 61 BC after her embroilment in the Bona Dea scandal.|$|E
25|$|The Rumford {{fireplace}} {{created a}} sensation in 1796 when Benjamin Thompson Rumford introduced {{the idea of}} restricting the chimney opening to increase the updraught. Rumford fireplaces were common from 1796, when Benjamin Rumford first wrote about them, until about 1850. Thomas Jefferson had them built at Monticello, and Henry David Thoreau listed them among the modern conveniences that everyone took for granted. Rumford and his workers changed fireplaces by inserting bricks into the hearth to make the side walls angled and added a choke to the chimney {{to increase the speed}} of air going up the flue. It produced a streamlined air flow, reducing turbulence so the smoke would go up into the chimney rather than choking the residents. Rumford fireplaces are appreciated for their tall classic elegance and heating efficiency. This simple alteration in the design of fireplaces were copied everywhere in <b>an</b> <b>age</b> <b>when</b> fires were the principal source of heat. The Rumford fireplace is still used in the 21st century.|$|E
25|$|In 382, the Emperor Gratian, a Christian, {{ordered the}} Altar of Victory {{removed from the}} Curia, the Roman Senate house in the Forum, and curtailed the sums {{annually}} allowed {{for the maintenance of}} the Vestal Virgins, and for the public celebration of sacred rites. Symmachus was chosen by the Senate on account of his eloquence to lead a delegation of protest, which the emperor refused to receive. Two years later, Gratian was assassinated in Lugdunum, and Symmachus, now urban prefect of Rome, addressed an elaborate epistle to Gratian's successor, Valentinian II, in a famous dispatch that was rebutted by Ambrose, the bishop of Milan. In <b>an</b> <b>age</b> <b>when</b> all religious communities credited the divine power with direct involvement in human affairs, Symmachus argues that the removal of the altar had caused a famine and its restoration would be beneficial in other ways. Subtly he pleads for tolerance for traditional cult practices and beliefs that Christianity was poised to suppress in the Theodosian edicts of 391.|$|E

500|$|Claudius {{was both}} {{an author and}} a copyist. Although most of his extant works are simple biblical commentaries, his {{writings}} are very personal.

Around 811, Claudius prepared an exhaustive and encyclopaedic commentary on the Book of Genesis {{at the request of}} the emperor. This commentary was edited by Johann Alexander Brassicanus in Vienna before it was first printed in Basel by Hieronymus Froben in 1531.|$|E
500|$|Roberson {{has spoken}} of the {{difficulties}} of writing medieval women, particularly because so many contemporary authors are accused of giving their characters [...] "anachronistic independence of thought and feminist leanings." [...] The author acknowledged that with Eleanor DeLacey, an invented character, she [...] "tread close to the boundaries" [...] but believes Eleanor {{is a reflection of}} women of [...] "loose morals", who indeed existed in the 1190s. Roberson continued, [...] "I choose to believe an Eleanor might well have looked to sexual dalliance as a means of seeking freedom of choice in <b>an</b> <b>age</b> <b>when</b> women had very little." [...] Conversely, Marian, Roberson wrote, [...] "is a truer product of her times, shaped by the ordinary responsibilities and expectations of a medieval woman." [...] Marian only gains the strength and freedom to love after the loss of her good reputation as a captive in Sherwood Forest.|$|E
