The movie has to have humor.... Even in Stoka (the theater she worked with) there was often laughter through tears.” “(A) documentary can only arise when people are open.” Regarding the film “From Fico to Fico” that features the Gorilla protests while attempting to explore their organizational background, she says, “A scene from the film, in which people gathered on the central square trying to debate issues of national defense and economic growth, resembled surreal poetics of the Stoka theater. It's my favorite scene. It shows how the heterarchic system in Slovakia works when people have to agree on something. Scenes like this cannot be invented, they simply inspire you and you capture them. ... Maybe I'm strange, but I want to be constantly surprised.

30|$|Realizing that my {{students}} lacked a holistic understanding of SP, I {{decided in the}} fall semester of 2013 to 2014 {{to participate in the}} above-mentioned project.

For this reason, science education must be grounded in a holistic approach in which students recognize that scientific methods are diverse and that the essence of science is the accumulation of evidence in support of claims.|$|E

My every action, word, thought, had my feeling for Rima as a motive. Why, I began to ask myself, was Rima so much to me? It was easy to answer that question: Because nothing so exquisite had ever been created. All the separate and fragmentary beauty and melody and graceful motion found scattered throughout nature were concentrated and harmoniously combined in her. How various, how luminous, how divine she was! A being for the mind to marvel at, to admire continually, finding some new grace and charm every hour, every moment, {{to add to the}} old.

Ao percorrer algumas bacias hidrogr?ficas da Amaz?nia, essa sempre foi uma quest?o que despertou meu interesse de arquiteto. Trabalhando com o patrim?nio {{cultural}} junto ao Instituto Patrim?nio Hist?rico e Art?stico Nacional (IPHAN), aqui na Amaz?nia, indagava-me sobre essa lacuna na esfera de interesses do Minist?rio da Cultura. O rio Negro ? locus da pesquisa que comecei a desenvolver com essas inquieta??es em mente. A princ?pio, era o patrim?nio imaterial o objeto de interesse mais amplo, que logo foi direcionado para as casas-aldeias, habita??es ind?genas tradicionais dos povos de l?ngua Aruak e Tukano, como foram descritas por etn?logos que se dedicaram ao estudo da cultura material. Os desdobramentos desses trabalhos, ao longo dos ?ltimos sete anos, ampliaram a rede de parceiros. Como assessor do Instituto Socioambiental (ISA), organiza??o n?o governamental, realizei atelieres de arquitetura, junto a comunidades ind?genas, tendo como objeto as casas-aldeias no noroeste Amaz?nico: um atelier em 2005, entre os Tuyuka no alto rio Tiqui?, tribut?rio do rio Uaup?s e outro atelier em Iauaret? A Cidade do ?ndio, em 2007 no Centro Cultural Tariano. Assumindo uma perspectiva etnogr?fica, elaboro narrativas desses eventos e desenvolvo uma abordagem, considerando temporalidades distintas para revelar o sentido das casas-aldeias na atualidade. A ?tica do arquiteto perpassa pela teoria e hist?ria da arquitetura que permite pensar a produ??o do espa?o e tempo; e o pr?prio sentido da arquitetura atrav?s dessas casas-aldeias que guardam em si uma vis?o de mundo. The architectonic {{manifestations of}} the autochthonous people in Brazil do not {{find a place in}} the theories and History of Brazilian architecture, it s as if they had no contribution to offer as models of stability, comfort, and beauty which is what they are. As I traveled around some hydrographic bays of the Amazon that has always been an issue that <b>arouse</b> <b>my</b> <b>interest</b> as an architect. I work with the IPHAN (Historic and National Artistic Heritage Institute), here in the Amazon, and I asked myself about this gap in the sphere of interest of the Ministry of Culture. The Black River is the research s locus which I began developing with these on, which soon was directed to the house-villages, indigenous traditional in habitations of the Aruak and Tukano speaking people, which were described by the ethnologists who dedicated themselves to the study of material culture. The outcome of these works throughout these seven years broadened the net of partners. As the Socioambiental Institute adviser I made many architecture workshops with the indigenous communities, having as object the house-villages in the northwestern Amazon: a workshop in 2005 among the Tuyuka in the upper Tiqui? River, a tributary of the Uaup?s River; and another workshop in Iauaret?, the City of the Indian, in 2007 at the Tariano Cultural Center. Taking on an ethnographic perspective, I drew up narratives of these events and I developed an approach considering distinct temporalities to reveal the sense of housevillages nowadays. The optic of the architect passes through the theory and History of architecture, which allows us to think on the production of space and time, and the sense of architecture itself through these house-villages which keep in themselves a vision of the world...|$|R

My desire to enquire into the whole position of religious instruction {{in the high school}} curriculum grew out of an essay on {{the role of religion in}} the education of the child which I wrote whilst reading for the B. Ed. degree. As background, I read Harold Loukes' classic Teenage Religion, and from then onwards, I felt that it was necessary to undertake an investigation of this kind in the Cape Province. My aim was not only prompted out of a desire to expose what I already knew to be an educationally and religiously unsound and unhealthy state of affairs, but more deeply because I, although an ignorant amateur in theology, am aware that too often the traditional religious foundations, poorly built by unintelligent teaching, are shaken, if not destroyed, by scientific discovery and material advancement...|$|E

Further, they agree that only a very few patients—it is difficult to estimate how many—remain in treatment after the first several interviews. We have tried to understand both some of the factors that tend to keep patients away from recommended therapy and some that seem to help patients seek and stay with psychotherapy.

Russian and British archival and printed sources widen our perspective on the history of the Eastern Question, transforming what many scholars have portrayed as a largely one-dimensional military, naval, and diplomatic subject into a multi-faceted and more animated picture, with strategic objectives intertwined with commercial, religious, and cultural endeavors.

60|$|What {{makes this}} book memorable to me {{apart from the}} natural {{sentiment}} one has for one's creation is the response it provoked. The general public responded largely, more largely perhaps than to any other book of mine, in {{the only way the}} general public can respond, that is by buying a certain number of copies. This gave me a considerable amount of pleasure, because what I always feared most was drifting unconsciously into the position of a writer for a limited coterie; a position which would have been odious to me as throwing a doubt on the soundness of my belief in the solidarity of all mankind in simple ideas and in sincere emotions. Regarded as a manifestation of criticism (for it would be outrageous to deny to the general public the possession of a critical mind) the reception was very satisfactory. I saw that I had managed to please a certain number of minds busy attending to their own very real affairs. It is agreeable to think one is able to please. From the minds whose business it is precisely to criticize such attempts to please, this book received an amount of discussion and of a rather searching analysis which not only satisfied that personal vanity I share with the rest of mankind but reached my deeper feelings and <b>aroused</b> <b>my</b> gratified <b>interest.</b> The undoubted sympathy informing the varied appreciations of that book was, I love to think, a recognition of my good faith in the pursuit of my art--the art of the novelist which a distinguished French writer {{at the end of a}} successful career complained of as being: Trop difficile! It is indeed too arduous in the sense that the effort must be invariably so much greater than the possible achievement. In that sort of foredoomed task which is in its nature very lonely also, sympathy is a precious thing. It can make the most severe criticism welcome. To be told that better things have been expected of one may be soothing in view of how much better things one had expected from oneself in this art which, in these days, is no longer justified by the assumption, somewhere and somehow, of a didactic purpose.|$|R
