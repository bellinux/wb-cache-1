5|$|In some cases, these {{algorithms}} can {{be extended}} to other, non-perfect, classes of graphs as well. For instance, in a circle graph, the neighborhood of each vertex is a permutation graph, so a maximum clique in a circle graph can be found by <b>applying</b> <b>the</b> permutation graph algorithm to each neighborhood. Similarly, in a unit disk graph (with a known geometric representation), there is a polynomial time algorithm for maximum cliques based on <b>applying</b> <b>the</b> algorithm for complements of bipartite graphs to shared neighborhoods of pairs of vertices.|$|E

5|$|These {{operations}} {{define a}} symmetry relation between equivalent grids. Excluding relabeling, and {{with respect to}} the 81 grid cell values, the operations form a subgroup of the symmetric group S81, of order 3!8×2=3,359,232. <b>Applying</b> <b>the</b> above operations on majority of the grids results in 3!8×2×9! essentially equivalent grids. Exceptions are Automorphic Sudokus which due to additional non-trivial symmetry generate fewer grids.|$|E

The purchase of an adjacent lot—and sale of part of it to Obama by the wife of developer, campaign donor and friend Tony Rezko—attracted media attention because of Rezko's subsequent indictment and conviction on political corruption charges that were unrelated to Obama.|$|E
5|$|Arkham Origins was {{considered}} an incremental installment for the series, rather than a transformative one. GameSpot said that Arkham City expanded on Arkham Asylum by <b>applying</b> <b>the</b> game mechanics to a larger open-world setting, but criticized Arkham Origins for replicating Arkham City without moving the series forward. Other critics agreed, saying that the game's well-received elements from the previous game were not significantly developed or augmented and it was routine rather than inspired. However, other reviewers rated it {{on a par with}} Arkham City.|$|E

50|$|Not all {{courts and}} tribunals have {{jurisdiction}} to hear constitutional challenges. The court, at the very least, must have jurisdiction to <b>apply</b> <b>the</b> law. In N.S. v. Martin; N.S. v. Laseur (2003) the Supreme Court re-articulated the test for constitutional jurisdiction from Cooper v. Canada (Human Rights Commission). The inquiry must begin by determining whether the enabling legislation gives explicit authority to <b>apply</b> <b>the</b> law. If so, then <b>the</b> court may <b>apply</b> <b>the</b> constitution. The second line of inquiry looks into whether there was implied authority to <b>apply</b> <b>the</b> law. This can be found by examining {{the text of the}} Act, its context, and the general nature and characteristics of the adjudicative body.|$|R

5|$|Before <b>applying</b> <b>the</b> top {{coats of}} paint, the LMS would apply a matt {{undercoat}} of shop grey {{in which it}} was customary to photograph the locomotive for the first time. The ensuing LMS top coats for the Coronation Class came in two basic colours during this period: Caledonian blue and crimson lake. Linings for streamliners involved the renowned 'speed whiskers' comprising stripes emerging from a fixed point in the lower centre of the front of the locomotive to run in parallel along the sides. Non-streamliners carried the standard LMS-style lining.|$|E
5|$|Compression of a {{white dwarf}} will {{increase}} the number of electrons in a given volume. <b>Applying</b> <b>the</b> Pauli exclusion principle, this will increase the kinetic energy of the electrons, thereby increasing the pressure. This electron degeneracy pressure supports a white dwarf against gravitational collapse. The pressure depends only on density and not on temperature. Degenerate matter is relatively compressible; this means that the density of a high-mass white dwarf is much greater than that of a low-mass white dwarf and that the radius {{of a white}} dwarf decreases as its mass increases.|$|E

Tourism Company of Puerto Rico (1986), affirmed the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico's conclusion that Puerto Rico's Games of Chance Act of 1948, including the regulations thereunder, was not facially unconstitutional.
