An error was found in calculations for the band pass amplifier discussed in Group 9 of the Electronics Progress Report,MLM- 306, March 1 [...] 31, 1949, on the Cathode-Follower Probe. New calculations have been made and a band pass filter constructed to match the new values. Work on the cathode-follower circuit for coupling a Boron-wall tube to its linear amplifier indicated that the limit to the sharpness of a pulse which could be achieved was possibly caused by poor <b>amplitude</b> <b>versus</b> <b>frequency</b> response of the linear amplifier. To check this theory, modifications were made on an existing scaler {{which resulted in a}} frequency response flat up to 4. 5 megacycles.

In 4 of the 5 rats, the averaged backscatter slope of the regions of interest in the tumor was significantly (P <. 05) dif-ferent from that of the surrounding tissue, and the fifth case had a moderate difference (P =. 20).

We {{have shown that}} cardiomyocytes exhibit high-amplitude, self-sustained, and synchronous oscillations of bioenergetic parameters when the mitochondrial network is stressed to a critical state. Computational studies suggested that additional low-amplitude, high-frequency oscillations were also possible. Herein, employing power spectral analysis, we show that the temporal behavior of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) in cardiomyocytes under physiological conditions is oscillatory and characterized by a broad frequency distribution that obeys a homogeneous power law (1 /fβ) with a spectral exponent, β = 1. 74. Additionally, relative dispersional analysis shows that mitochondrial oscillatory dynamics exhibits long-term memory, characterized by an inverse power law that scales with a fractal dimension (Df) of 1. 008, distinct from random behavior (Df = 1. 5), over at least three orders of magnitude. Analysis of a computational model of the mitochondrial oscillator suggests that the mechanistic origin of the power law behavior {{is based on the}} inverse dependence of <b>amplitude</b> <b>versus</b> <b>frequency</b> of oscillation related to the balance between reactive oxygen species production and scavenging.

For waves propagating in the up-dip direction the <b>amplitude</b> <b>versus</b> <b>frequency</b> curves for a constant depth to the interface change slowly with increasing dip for dip angles less than 20 °. However, for waves propagating in the down-dip direction, the character of the amplitude curves changes rapidly. It is found in these cases that the diffracted wave plays an important role. In addition to satisfying the boundary conditions at the surface and between the media, the diffracted wave must also satisfy additional conditions along a dipping surface lying between the free surface and the boundary between the two media due to the geometrical nature of the reflected wave solution. It is found that the phase velocities vary rapidly with both period of the wave and depth to the interface, particularly for propagation directions close to an angle which corresponds to vertical incidence in the horizontally layered case...|$|R

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Three groups of guinea-pigs received TiO 2 -blasted implants in both tibiae. One week after installation test implants were loaded 5 days/week during 4 weeks. The contra-lateral implants were the unloaded controls. Strain rate was kept constant (1600 micro epsilon/s), while amplitude and frequency were varied per group. Implant stability was followed by resonance frequency analysis. Animals were sacrificed, and ground sections were prepared to rate bone-to-implant contact and bone mass. RESULTS: All implants (n= 78) integrated uneventfully. A significant positive effect (p= 0. 03) of early loading on bone mass was observed in the distal medullar cavity. A significant difference in bone mass between test and control implants was evidenced between the groups (p= 0. 03 and 0. 04). A significant increase in implant stability and bone-to-implant contact could not be shown. CONCLUSIONS: Early controlled stimulation of peri-implant bone is related to amplitude/frequency and not to strain rate as such, considering a constant stimulation time. An increase of bone mass around early-loaded implants was shown. This cortical bone model is most sensitive to low-frequency/high-amplitude stimulation. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Stub {{resonators}} {{can be used}} {{to assess}} the dielectric properties of fluids. The resonance frequencies, determined from the <b>amplitude</b> <b>versus</b> <b>frequency</b> (AF) response of such resonators, are mainly determined by the permittivity of the fluid while damping arises from dielectric losses. Even though this methodology has been extensively reported in the literature, without almost any exception these studies refer to (near) ideal behavior regarding for example, geometry and negligibly low conductivity of the fluid studied. Online stub resonator-based sensors (i. e., flow-through) in use for industrial applications, however, quite often suffer from high dielectric losses, non-ideal material choice of the conductors from an electrical point of view and unconventional resonator geometry. Therefore, in order to ensure correct data interpretation, a straightforward model accounting for the effects of dielectric losses, conductor losses (skin effect) and impedance mismatches on the AF response is highly desirable. In addition, such a model can help to optimize future sensor designs. Here, we present a lumped parameter model, essentially based on telegrapher's equations, that accounts for the skin effect, dielectric losses and impedance mismatches between the transmission lines to the resonator and the resonator respectively. The adequacy of the method, even in the case of impedance mismatch, is demonstrated by comparing these model simulations with experimentally obtained AF curves for both flow-through coaxial stub resonators and microstrip resonators immersed in the fluid under investigatio...|$|R

3000|$|The {{concept of}} impact-echo testing, invented by the US National Bureau of Standards (NBS) in the mid- 1980 s, applies {{acoustic}} methods for non-destructive evaluation {{of concrete and}} masonry structures. The principle of the impact-echo method involves transmission of energy of a mechanical impact from a small steel sphere into the mass of a structure to generate transient sinusoidal stress (sound) waves. Low-frequency impact stress waves propagating into a structure are reflected by internal surfaces and flaws (Sansalone and Streett 1998). The patterns present in the reflected waveforms and spectra provide information about the existence and locations of structural flaws, e.g., de-bonding. Multiple reflections of stress waves between the impact surface and flaws give rise to transient resonances, which can be identified in the frequency spectrum, and {{used to evaluate the}} integrity of the structure. The resulting wave displacement signals in the time domain are transformed into the frequency domain in which plots of <b>amplitude</b> <b>versus</b> <b>frequency</b> (spectra) are obtained. Surface displacements caused by these wave reflections are recorded by a transducer located adjacent to the point of impact. Impact-echo tests on concrete structures, such as CFRP plates applied to bridge structural members, produce distinctive waveforms and frequencies, in which dominant patterns in the number and distribution of peaks in the spectra are easily identified. Voids and de-laminations (flaws) in the CFRP–concrete structure change impact waveform patterns (frequency spectra) and provide qualitative and quantitative information about the existence and location of the structural deficiencies (Ray et al. [...] 2007).|$|R
40|$|The {{reliability}} of usual assumptions regarding the wavefield composition in {{applications of the}} Diffuse Field Approach (DFA) to passive seismic prospecting is investigated. Starting from the more general formulation of the DFA for full wavefield (FW), the contribution of each wave to the horizontal- and vertical-component power spectra at surface are analyzed for a simple elastic waveguide representing the continental crust-upper mantle interface. Special {{attention is paid to}} their compositions at low and high frequencies, and the relative powers of each surface wave (SW) type are identified by means of a semianalytical analysis. If body waves are removed from the analysis, the high-frequency horizontal asymptote of the H/V spectral ratio decreases slightly (from 1. 33 for FW to around 1. 14 for SW) and shows dependence on both the Poisson’s ratio of the crust and the S wave velocity contrast (while FW-H/V asymptote depends on the former only). Experimental tests in a local broadband network provide H/V curves compatible with any of these values in the band 0. 2 – 1 Hz, approximately, supporting the applicability of the DFA approximation. Coexistence of multiple SW modes produces distortion in the amplitudes of vertical and radial component Aki’s coherences, in comparison with the usual predictions based on fundamental modes. At high frequencies, this effect consists of a decrement by a constant scaling factor, being very remarkable in the radial case. Effects on the tangential coherence are severe, including a π/ 4 phase shift, slower decay rate of <b>amplitude</b> <b>versus</b> <b>frequency,</b> and contribution of several velocities for large enough distances...|$|R

Fourier <b>amplitudes</b> (<b>amplitudes</b> <b>versus</b> <b>frequencies)</b> of the foundation motion connected with the soil-structure interaction and differential motions of the foundation-structure contact due to the wave passage are considered. We expect that the motion of the flexible foundation will be larger than the existing solutions for the motion of the rigid foundation. As the foundation becomes stiffer, the Fourier amplitudes (transfer functions) on the building-foundation contact will decay and will approach the solution for the case of rigid foundation. The wave propagation approach in solving the problem is taken into account. The wave equation will be solved numerically in the domain consisting of the soil, foundation, and superstructure using the explicit Lax-Wendroff numerical scheme. Because in the real world, the problem is defined in infinite domain in the soil, we will incorporate an artificial boundary in the truncated domain which corresponds with the Sommerfeld radiation boundary condition at infinity. The velocities and the displacements at the points of the stress-free boundaries will be updated in each time step using the vacuum formalism approach. The stresses, the velocities, and the displacements at the points of soil-foundation and foundation-building contacts will be computed from the continuity of stresses and the continuity of displacements at those points.

This study was undertaken to improve upon current prediction techniques with regard to the psychoacoustic descriptor of loudness and an improved binaural summation technique. The feasibility of this project was first investigated through a loudness matching experiment involving thirty-one subjects and pure tones of constant sound pressure level. A dependence of binaural summation on frequency was observed which had previously not been a subject of investigation in the reviewed literature. A follow-up investigation was carried out with forty-eight volunteers and pure tones of constant sensation level. Contrary to existing theories in literature the resulting loudness matches revealed an <b>amplitude</b> <b>versus</b> <b>frequency</b> relationship which confirmed {{the perceived}} increase in loudness when a signal was presented to both ears simultaneously as opposed to one ear alone. The resulting trend strongly indicated that the higher the frequency of the presented signal, the greater the increase in observed binaural summation. The results from each investigation were summarized into a single binaural summation algorithm and inserted into an improved time-varying loudness model. Using experimental techniques, it was demonstrated that the updated binaural summation algorithm was a considerable improvement over {{the state of the art}} approach for predicting the perceived binaural loudness. The improved function retained the ease of use from the original model while additionally providing accurate estimates of diotic listening conditions from monaural WAV files.

40|$|The {{resonance}} of semi-diurnal tidal elevations is investigated with a forward numerical forced damped global tide model and an analytical model of forced-damped tides {{in a deep}} ocean basin coupled to a shelf. The analytical model contains the classical half-wavelength and quarter-wavelength resonances in the deep ocean and shelf, respectively, {{as well as a}} forcing-scale dependence which depends on the ratio of the phase speed of open-ocean gravity waves to that of the astronomical forcing. In the analytical model, when the deep ocean and shelf resonate separately at the same frequency, the resonance in the coupled system shifts to frequencies slightly higher and lower than the original frequency, such that a ‘double bump’ is seen in plots of elevation <b>amplitude</b> <b>versus</b> <b>frequency.</b> The addition of a shelf to a resonant open ocean tends to reduce open-ocean tides, especially when the shelf is also near resonance. The magnitude of this ‘back-effect’ is controlled by shelf friction. A weakly damped resonant shelf has a larger back-effect on the open-ocean tide than does a strongly damped shelf. Numerical simulations largely bear out the analytical model predictions, at least qualitatively. Idealized simulations show that continents enhance tides by enabling the half-wavelength resonance. Simulations with realistic geometry and topography but varying longitudinal structure in the astronomical forcing display an influence of the forcing scale on tidal amplitudes somewhat similar to that seen in the analytical model. A frequency sweep in the semi-diurnal band in experiments with realistic geometry and topography reveals weakly resonant peaks in the amplitudes of several shelf regions and in the globally averaged open-ocean amplitudes. Finally, the backeffect of the shelf upon the open ocean is seen in simulations in which locations of resonant coastal tides are blocked out and open-ocean tidal elevations are significantly altered (increased, generally) as a result...|$|R
40|$|We present {{experimental}} and theoretical investigations of dynamic pull-in of electrostatically actuated resonators. Several experimental data are presented, showing regimes of ac forcing <b>amplitude</b> <b>versus</b> ac <b>frequency,</b> where a resonator {{is forced to}} pull in if operated within these regimes. Results are shown for primary and secondary resonance excitations. The influences of the initial conditions of the system, the ac excitation amplitude, the ac frequency, the excitation type, and the sweeping type are investigated. A shooting technique to find periodic motions and a basin-of-attraction analysis are used to predict {{the limits of the}} pull-in bands. When compared with the experimental data, the results have shown that the pull-in limits coincide with 30 %- 40 % erosion lines of the safe basin in the case of primary resonance and 5 %- 15 % erosion lines of the safe basin in the case of subharmonic resonance. Bifurcation diagrams have been constructed, which designers can use to establish factors of safety to reliably operate microelectromechanical-systems resonators away from pull-in bands and the danger of pull-in, depending on the expected disturbances and noise in the systems...|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{the measurement of}} mass of the absorbing micro-particle trapped in air by optical forced oscillation. When the trapping light intensity is modulated sinusoidally, the particle in the trap undergoes forced oscillation and the amplitude of the oscillation depends directly on the modulated frequency. Based on a simple spring model, we fit the <b>amplitudes</b> <b>versus</b> the modulated <b>frequencies</b> and obtain the stiffness of the optical trap and {{the mass of the}} trapped particle. The fitting results show that, for a certain particle, the stiffness varies linearly with the trapping light intensity while the mass is consistent. The density of the micro-particle is then estimated and could be used to classify different kinds of absorbing particles, like C and CuO...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} five {{fluorescent}} and ionic dimethylamino stilbazolium homologues with increasing conjugation length (from ethenyl to decapentaenyl) is investigated by high-frequency, amplitude-modulated femtosecond hyper-Rayleigh scattering at 1300 nm. A hyperpolarizability value {{that is not}} overestimated {{by the presence of}} a multiphoton fluorescence contribution is obtained from the Fourier analysis of the hyper-Rayleigh scattering signal. The demodulation curve (decrease of Fourier <b>amplitude</b> <b>versus</b> modulation <b>frequency)</b> is characterized by both the hyperpolarizability value and the fluorescence decay parameters. The fluorescence decay parameters are accurately determined independently by single-photon counting. A detailed analysis of the fluorescence decay parameters from the hyper-Rayleigh scattering demodulation curve and of their relation to the fluorescence decay parameters obtained from single-photon counting experiments is presented. The inherent hyperpolarizability value for these chromophores shows a maximum of (2045 +/- 35) x 10 (- 30) esu or (760 +/- 13) x 10 (- 50) C- 3 m(3) J(- 2) for the hexatrienyl conjugation length. A comparison with theoretical calculations suggests the importance of trans-cis isomerization in the excited state.
