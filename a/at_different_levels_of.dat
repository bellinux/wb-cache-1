As the noise increases it becomes hard to recover the noisy digital image. Different median filters have been suggested to recover it. Size of the window taken in the filter is also the important factor <b>at</b> <b>different</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> noises. The performance of standard median filter (SMF), centered weighted median (CWM) filter and directional weighted median (DWM) filter is tested on gray scale images corrupted with variable percentage of salt & pepper noise impulse noise. It is also tested for different window sizes of filters. Some filter performs better at low noise while some performs better at high noise. At higher <b>level</b> <b>of</b> noise, large window size in the filters works better than small window size.

According to Brother Matthias, Ruth was standing to one side laughing at the bumbling pitching efforts of fellow students, and Matthias told him to go in and see if he could do better. Ruth had become the best pitcher at St. Mary's, and when he was 18 in 1913, he was allowed to leave the premises to play weekend games on teams that were drawn from the community. He was mentioned in several newspaper articles, for both his pitching prowess and ability to hit long home runs.|$|E
