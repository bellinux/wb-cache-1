50|$|Amateur use of VHF and UHF {{allocations}} {{exploded in}} the late 1960s and early 1970s as repeaters started going on the <b>air.</b> <b>Repeater</b> use sparked a huge interest in the 2-meter and 70-centimeter (420-450 MHz) bands, however, this interest never fully {{found its way into}} the 1.25-meter band. Many amateurs attribute this to the abundance of commercial radio equipment designed for 136-174 MHz and 450-512 MHz that amateurs could easily modify for use on the 2-meter and 70-centimeter bands. There were no commercial frequency allocations near the 1.25-meter band, and little commercial radio equipment was available. This meant that amateurs who wanted to experiment with the 1.25-meter band had to build their own equipment or purchase one of the few radios available from specialized amateur radio equipment manufacturers. Many of the repeaters which have been constructed for 1.25-meter operation have been based on converted land-mobile base station hardware, often extensively modifying equipment originally designed for other VHF bands.|$|R
50|$|Unlike FM and AM, {{unlicensed}} use {{of television}} bands is prohibited for broadcasting. The amateur television channels do allow for some very limited non-entertainment transmissions however, with some <b>repeaters</b> <b>airing</b> NASA TV during Space Shuttle missions {{when they are}} not in local use.|$|R
5000|$|When Coiler Corporation {{was founded}} in 1991, its focus was mainly on {{manufacturing}} electronic engine equipment. In 1994 it started to diversify and began its RF division where the company's portfolio included GSM and DCS gain adjustable repeaters, AMPS small <b>repeaters</b> and single-band <b>car</b> boosters. In 1999 the company developed a medium-sized band selective repeater and later added a dual-band car booster.|$|R
50|$|However, a {{year later}} in 1968, an {{agreement}} was reached between CFCN and CJLH to share space on the CJLH tower and building for technical equipment. On September 3, CFCN went on the <b>air</b> with a <b>repeater</b> station on channel 13. That same year, the station's first 2-inch black and white videotape recorder was installed, and a repeater in Brooks began operations, transmitting at low power on VHF channel 3.|$|R
50|$|The station {{signed on}} the air on July 23, 1986 as W29AD, {{broadcasting}} on UHF channel 29. It moved to UHF channel 15 and acquired the W15AM calls on January 12, 1988. In the station's early days, it was a translator for World Harvest Television from WHME-TV in South Bend, Indiana, {{which is owned by}} LeSEA Broadcasting. The station eventually switched to LIN TV's Local Weather Station (LWS) format with the call sign WOWD-LP (variation on WOOD-TV). WOWD and its low-power network of <b>repeaters</b> <b>aired</b> 24-hour weather information direct from WOOD-TV's weather center. This was in an early pre-digital format comparable to the now defunct NBC Weather Plus.|$|R
50|$|Yes TV (stylized as yes TV) is a {{television}} system in Canada owned by Crossroads Christian Communications. It {{consists of three}} stations (located in the Greater Toronto Area, Calgary, and Edmonton), two rebroadcast transmitters, and several partial affiliates. Formerly known as the Crossroads Television System (CTS), the Yes TV stations and <b>repeaters</b> <b>air</b> a lineup consisting predominantly of Christian faith-based programming, such as televangelists and Crossroads' flagship Christian talk show 100 Huntley Street. During the late-afternoon and evening hours, Yes TV broadcasts secular, family-oriented sitcoms, game shows, and reality series; the system's September 2014 re-launch as Yes TV emphasized its newly acquired Canadian rights {{to a number of}} major U.S. reality series, such as American Idol and The Biggest Loser.|$|R
50|$|KXMN-LD {{first went}} on the <b>air</b> as a <b>repeater</b> of KXLY-TVâ€”first as K09FZ channel 9, then K11VT channel 11, then later as KUUP-LP (reflecting an unrealised UPN affiliation). On May 24, 2006. KUUP-LP became KXMN-LP, after picking up the My Network TV affiliation, soon after the network was first announced. KXMN-LP began {{separate}} programming on September 5, 2006. Programming from MeTV was added on September 3, 2012, and {{as a part of}} an out given by the network in 2009 as part of its conversion from a conventional broadcast network to a syndicated programming service by voiding all affiliation agreements, the station disaffiliated from My Network TV and began airing the full MeTV schedule on October 1, excluding local information program Explorer HDTV, which left the schedule several months later.|$|R
40|$|Apart {{from being}} {{the primary cause of}} death during {{childhood}} and adolescence, scientific evidence points in the direction that road traffic injuries make a major contribution to social inequalities in health during this period of life. The aim of the thesis is to advance knowledge and understanding of social differences in road traffic injury morbidity among young people in Sweden. The thesis is composed of five register-based nation wide cohort studies. In the first study, socioeconomic group of the household is studied in relation to hospital-based road traffic injuries as pedestrians, bicyclists, moped-riders, motorcyclists and car drivers, for the period 19871994 (when subjects were aged 2 - 24 years). Morbidity differences between groups are observed in all categories of road users, but most prominently among motorized-vehicle drivers. In spite of more injuries occurring among boys than girls, similar social patterning emerges for both sexes. The following two studies investigate whether the social distribution of road traffic injuries for different age groups and for different types of road users varies according to how socioeconomic position of the family is measured. Consideration is paid to parental education, socioeconomic group of the household (based on occupation) and household disposable income. Among young children (Study II), road traffic injuries as pedestrians, bicyclists, and car passengers are studied for the years 1991 - 1999, and among older ones (Study III), road traffic injuries as car drivers for the years 1991 - 1996. The groups were followed respectively up to 14 years and up to 23 years. It is observed that both parental socioeconomic group and parental education impact on the risk of road traffic injuries in the two age groups. By contrast, disposable income of the household is a risk factor of greater importance among the younger ones. Studies IV and V focus on young adult car drivers and distinguish their socioeconomic position of origin, based on the socioeconomic group of the household, and their position of destination, considering subject's educational attainment at age 28 - 30 years. In study IV, the social patterning of injury repeaters is examined as compared to that of the once-injured, based on in-patient treatment when subjects were aged 18 - 26 years, an age period otherwise at high risk of injuries as car drivers. The study shows that injury <b>repeaters</b> as <b>car</b> drivers are uncommon and that their social patterning is much similar to that of once-injured drivers. For Study V, car-to-car and single crashes are analysed, paying attention to various injury severity levels (consequences) and various crash patterns (circumstances). Crash data come from the police reports for the period 1988 - 2000, i. e., when subjects were 18 - 30 years. Relative risks of road traffic injuries are compiled considering age at licensing of the subjects. Socioeconomic differences appear clearly for both crash consequences and crash circumstances. The excess risk for young drivers from lower socioeconomic groups is more pronounced as severity increases. Whereas gender modifies the effect of socioeconomic position of destination, it does not modify the effect of socioeconomic position of origin. The results of the studies forming the thesis suggest differences in the impact of road traffic injuries among children and young people from different socioeconomic group in Swedish society. Further, the excess risk for young drivers from lower socioeconomic groups is consistent across crash severity levels, and becomes more pronounced as severity increases...|$|R
