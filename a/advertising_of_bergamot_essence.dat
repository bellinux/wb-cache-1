40|$|Objectives : There is {{very little}} information, to date, on the {{antifungal}} activity <b>of</b> <b>bergamot</b> oil. In this study, we investigated the in vitro activity <b>of</b> three <b>bergamot</b> oils (natural <b>essence,</b> furocoumarin-free extract and distilled extract) against clinically relevant Candida species. We studied the two derivatives, components of Italian pharmaceutical products, {{that are supposed to}} be less toxic than the essential oil. Methods : In vitro susceptibility of 40 clinical isolates of Candida spp. (Candida albicans, n = 20; Candida glabrata, n = 13; Candida krusei, n = 4; Candida tropicalis, n = 2; Candida parapsilosis, n = 1), associated with symptomatic and asymptomatic vulvovaginal candidiasis, was determined using a modification of the NCCLS M 27 -A 2 broth microdilution method. MICs were evaluated for each of the oils alone and combined with sub-inhibitory concentrations of the well-known antiseptic, boric acid.

In the first classification of mass modeling, the lowest determining coefficients were as R 2 = 0. 87 and R 2 = 0. 88 based on length and width, respectively, while all the other determining coefficients were higher than R 2 = 0. 90. The highest determining coefficient in all mass models was obtained based on actual volume as R 2 = 0. 99. Based on the results, all determining coefficients for surface area modeling were higher than R 2 = 0. 92.

5000|$|The {{bergamot}} {{essential oil}} is particularly subject to adulteration being an essential oil produced in relatively small quantities. Generally adulteration is to [...] "cut" [...] the oil, i.e. adding distilled essences of poor quality and low cost, for example of bitter orange and bergamot mint and/or mixtures of terpenes, natural or synthetic, or [...] "reconstruct" [...] the essence from synthetic chemicals, coloring it with chlorophyll. Worldwide, each year, around three thousand tonnes <b>of</b> declared <b>essence</b> <b>of</b> <b>bergamot</b> are marketed, while the genuine <b>essence</b> <b>of</b> <b>bergamot</b> produced annually amounts {{to no more}} than one hundred tons.Natural source analysis based on the Carbon-14 method can identify adulterated essences by detecting synthetic chemicals manufactured from petroleum that are used to mimic the chemical profile <b>of</b> <b>bergamot</b> oil and other essential oils.|$|R

MICs were evaluated for each of the oils alone and combined with sub-inhibitory concentrations of the well-known antiseptic, boric acid. To boric acid, all isolates had MIC values ranging from 0. 094 % to 0. 187 % (w/v). RESULTS: At 24 h readings, the MIC(90) s (for all isolates) were (v/v) : 5 % for natural <b>essence</b> <b>of</b> <b>bergamot,</b> 2. 5 % for the furocoumarin-free extract, and 1. 25 % for the distilled extract. At the 48 h reading, these values increased to > 10 %, 5 % and 2. 5 %, respectively. At both readings, MIC(90) s for all oil+boric acid combinations were significantly lower than corresponding values for the oils alone (P < 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that bergamot oils are active in vitro against Candida spp., suggesting their potential role for the topical treatment of Candida infections...|$|R

40|$|Bergamot (Citrus bergamia, Risso et Poiteau) {{cultivation}} {{started in}} Italy {{at the beginning}} of the 18 th century. Italian bergamot production is limited in a narrow strip of the Calabrian coast, along the Ionian and the Thyrrenian seas. Bergamot is cultivated for the essential oil representing an important raw material for cosmetic and food industry. Among non-volatile fraction components <b>of</b> the <b>bergamot</b> essential oil there are coumarins, whose fluorescence was widely investigated in the past.

Bergamot juice reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) release and other important pro-inflammatory mediators, such as nitric oxide (NO), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cycloxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) protein expression. Moreover, the cytoprotective haem-oxygenase- 1 (OH- 1) enzyme expression in LPS-stimulated J 774 A. 1 macrophages was enhanced.

40|$|Myeloid angiogenic cells (MACs) play a {{key role}} in endothelial {{repairing}} processes and functionality but their activity may be impaired by the lipotoxic effects of some molecules like stearic acid (SA). Among the dietary components potentially able to modulate endothelial function in vivo, (poly) phenolic compounds represent serious candidates. Here, we apply a comprehensive multidisciplinary approach to shed light on the prospects <b>of</b> <b>Bergamot</b> (Citrus bergamia), a citrus fruit rich in flavanones and other phenolic compounds, in the framework of lipotoxicity-induced MACs impairment. The flavanone profile <b>of</b> <b>bergamot</b> juice was characterized and 16 compounds were identified, with a new 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl (HMG) flavanone, isosakuranetin- 7 -O-neohesperidoside- 6 ″-O-HMG, described for the first time. Then, a pilot bioavailability study was conducted in healthy volunteers to assess the circulating flavanone metabolites in plasma and urine after consumption <b>of</b> <b>bergamot</b> juice. Up to 12 flavanone phase II conjugates (sulfates and glucuronides of hesperetin, naringenin and eriodyctiol) were detected and quantified. Finally, the effect of some of the metabolites identified in vivo, namely hesperetin- 7 -O-glucuronide, hesperetin- 3 ′-O-glucuronide, naringenin- 7 -O-glucuronide and naringenin- 4 ′-O-glucuronide, was tested, at physiological concentrations, on gene expression of inflammatory markers and apoptosis in MACs exposed to SA. Under these conditions, naringenin- 4 ′-O-glucuronide and hesperetin- 7 -O-glucuronide were able to modulate inflammation, while no flavanone glucuronide was effective in curbing stearate-induced lipoapoptosis. These results demonstrate that some flavanone metabolites, derived from the in vivo transformation <b>of</b> <b>bergamot</b> juice phenolics in humans, may mitigate stearate-induced inflammation in MACs...|$|R
