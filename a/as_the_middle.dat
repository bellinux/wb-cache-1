Furthermore, several of the world's largest investment banks have offices in Amman including Standard Chartered, Société Générale, and Citibank.|$|E
5|$|Literary {{activity}} also flourished {{during the}} reign of Ivan Alexander. Several important literary works were created in the period, such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> Bulgarian translation of the Manasses Chronicle (1344–1345), currently preserved in the Vatican Secret Archives in Rome, the richly illustrated Tetraevangelia of Ivan Alexander (1355–1356), now exhibited in the British Library, the Tomić Psalter (1360), today in Moscow, and the Sofia Psalter (1337).|$|E

5|$|The {{existence}} of the Book of the Dead was known as early <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> Ages, well before its contents could be understood.

5|$|Although {{classified}} as poisonous, reports of human deaths resulting from its ingestion are extremely rare. After parboiling—which weakens its toxicity and {{breaks down the}} mushroom's psychoactive substances—it is eaten in parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. Amanita muscaria is noted for its hallucinogenic properties, with its main psychoactive constituent being the compound muscimol. The mushroom {{was used as an}} intoxicant and entheogen by the peoples of Siberia, and has a religious significance in these cultures. There has been much speculation on possible traditional use of this mushroom as an intoxicant in other places such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> East, Eurasia, North America, and Scandinavia.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{it was by}} far {{the largest}} battle ever fought in North America. If the Royal Navy is included, over 40,000 men took part in the battle. Howe {{reported}} his losses as 59 killed, 268 wounded and 31 missing. The Hessian casualties were 5 killed and 26 wounded. The Americans suffered much heavier losses. About 300 had been killed and over 1,000 captured. As few as half of the prisoners survived. Kept on prison ships, then transferred to locations such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> Dutch Church, they were starved and denied medical attention. In their weakened condition, many succumbed to smallpox.|$|E

5|$|By 1:00 pm, the two fleets were roughly {{facing each}} other, but sailing on {{opposite}} tacks. In order to engage, {{and to avoid}} some shoals (known <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> Ground) {{near the mouth of}} the bay, Graves around 2:00 pm ordered his whole fleet to wear, a manoeuvre that reversed his line of battle, but enabled it to line up with the French fleet as its ships exited the bay. This placed the squadron of Hood, his most aggressive commander, {{at the rear of the}} line, and that of Admiral Francis Samuel Drake in the van.|$|E
5|$|Dromaeosaurid fossils {{have been}} found across the globe in North America, Europe, Africa, Japan, China, Mongolia, Manchuria, Madagascar, Argentina, and Antarctica, with fossilized teeth giving {{credence}} {{to the possibility that}} they inhabited Australia as well. They first appeared in the mid-Jurassic Period (late Bathonian stage, about 167 million years ago) and survived {{until the end of the}} Cretaceous (Maastrichtian stage, 66 ma), existing until the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. The presence of dromaeosaurids as early <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> Jurassic has been suggested by the discovery of isolated fossil teeth, though no dromaeosaurid body fossils {{have been found}} from this period.|$|E
5|$|East Anglia {{was settled}} by the Anglo-Saxons {{as early as}} around 450, earlier than many other regions. It emerged from the {{settlement}} and political consolidation of Angles in the approximate area of the former territory of the Iceni and the Roman civitas with its centre at Venta Icenorum, close to Caistor St Edmund. According to Bede, the East Angles (as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> Angles, the Mercians and the Northumbrians) were descended from natives of Angeln (now in modern Germany). The first reference to the East Angles is from around 704–713, in the Whitby Life of St Gregory.|$|E

5|$|Free {{from their}} loyalties to the pharaoh, local rulers began {{competing}} {{with each other}} for territorial control and political power. By 2160BC, rulers in Herakleopolis controlled Lower Egypt in the north, while a rival clan based in Thebes, the Intef family, took control of Upper Egypt in the south. As the Intefs grew in power and expanded their control northward, a clash between the two rival dynasties became inevitable. Around 2055BC the northern Theban forces under Nebhepetre Mentuhotep II finally defeated the Herakleopolitan rulers, reuniting the Two Lands. They inaugurated a period of economic and cultural renaissance known <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Native ponies {{existed in}} Wales before 1600 BC, and a Welsh-type cob {{was known as}} early <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> Ages. They were {{influenced}} by the Arabian horse, and possibly also by the Thoroughbred and the Hackney horse. In 1901, the first stud book for the Welsh breeds {{was established in the}} United Kingdom, and in 1907 another registry was established in the United States. Interest in the breed declined during the Great Depression, but revived in the 1950s. Throughout their history, the Welsh breeds have had many uses, including as a cavalry horse, a pit pony, and as a working animal on farms.|$|E
5|$|On 15 August 1971, {{though the}} Shah of Iran was {{claiming}} historical sovereignty over Bahrain, he accepted a referendum {{held by the}} United Nations and eventually Bahrain declared independence and signed a new treaty of friendship with the United Kingdom. Bahrain joined the United Nations and the Arab League later in the year. The oil boom of the 1970s benefited Bahrain greatly, although the subsequent downturn hurt the economy. The country had already begun diversification of its economy and benefited further from the Lebanese Civil War in the 1970s and 1980s, when Bahrain replaced Beirut <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> East's financial hub after Lebanon's large banking sector was driven {{out of the country}} by the war.|$|E
