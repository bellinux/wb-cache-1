25|$|Being on the Derwent - Eden watershed, Bowscale Fell {{has further}} {{topographical}} significance {{by providing the}} link between the Northern and Eastern Fells. The eastern ridge continues <b>almost</b> <b>imperceptibly</b> beneath Raven Crag, crossing the road before rising again to form Little Eycott and Eycott Hills. From here the watershed runs south across Great Mell Fell and ultimately climbs onto Great Dodd in the Helvellyn range.|$|E
25|$|Farther east {{the terrain}} changes {{abruptly}} {{to the flat}} lowlands of the coastal plain. This area, about sixty kilometers wide, is generally featureless and covered with gravel or sand. In the north is the Ad Dibdibah graveled plain and in the south the 'Al Jafurah sand desert, which reaches the gulf near Dhahran and merges with the Rub al Khali at its southern end. The coast itself is extremely irregular, merging sandy plains, marshes, and salt flats <b>almost</b> <b>imperceptibly</b> with the sea. As a result, the land surface is unstable; in places water rises almost to the surface, and the sea is shallow, with shoals and reefs extending far offshore. Only the construction of long moles at Ras Tanura has opened the Saudi coast on the gulf to seagoing tankers.|$|E

500|$|While {{they are}} common in the {{northern}} portion of Florida, no underground springs feed water into the Everglades system. An underground reservoir called the Floridan Aquifer lies about [...] {{below the surface of}} South Florida. The Everglades has an immense capacity for water storage, owing to the permeable limestone beneath the exposed land. Most of the water arrives in the form of rainfall, and a significant amount is stored in the limestone. Water evaporating from the Everglades becomes rain over metropolitan areas, providing the fresh water supply for the region. Water also flows into the park after falling as rain to the north onto the watersheds of the Kissimmee River and other sources of Lake Okeechobee, to appear in the Everglades days later. Water overflows Lake Okeechobee into a river 40 to [...] wide, which moves <b>almost</b> <b>imperceptibly.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{development}} of Scriabin's style {{can be traced}} in his ten piano sonatas: the earliest are composed in a fairly conventional late-Romantic manner and reveal the influence of Chopin and sometimes Franz Liszt, but the later ones are very different, the last five being written without a key signature. Many passages in them {{can be said to}} be atonal, though from 1903 through 1908, [...] "tonal unity was <b>almost</b> <b>imperceptibly</b> replaced by harmonic unity." ...|$|E
2500|$|Vowel nasalization in some dialects of Brazilian Portuguese is very {{different}} from that of French, for example. In French, the nasalization extends uniformly through the entire vowel, whereas in the Southern-Southeastern dialects of Brazilian Portuguese, the nasalization begins <b>almost</b> <b>imperceptibly</b> and then becomes stronger {{toward the end of the}} vowel. In this respect it is more similar to the nasalization of Hindi-Urdu phonology (see Anusvara). In some cases, the nasal archiphoneme even entails the insertion of a nasal consonant such as , as in the following examples: ...|$|E
2500|$|The initial issue arising in {{countries}} {{occupied by the}} Red Army in 1944 and 1945 was {{the manner in which}} to transform occupation power into control over domestic development. At first, western countries' willingness to support [...] "antifascist" [...] action and for [...] "democratization" [...] with a socialist element helped Soviet efforts to permit communists in their respective countries to initiate a process of gradual <b>almost</b> <b>imperceptibly</b> slow Sovietization. [...] Because communists were relatively small minorities in all countries but Czechoslovakia, they were initially instructed to form coalitions in their respective countries.|$|E
2500|$|Although the AFL {{had once}} preached {{the inevitability of}} class {{conflict}} {{and the need to}} abolish 'wage slavery', it slowly and <b>almost</b> <b>imperceptibly</b> began to proclaim the virtues of class harmony and the possibilities of a more benevolent Capitalism." [...] For example, Alex Heron attributes the following quote to Gompers: [...] "The greatest crime an employer can perpetrate on his employees is to fail to operate at a profit". Gompers began to take a neutral stance in politics after his failure to successfully elect Henry George as mayor of New York, but Gompers remained a Single Tax Georgist later in life.|$|E
2500|$|The decades between 1920 and 1970 were {{characterized}} by industrial decline and population shift from {{the city to the}} suburbs. Like most other cities which faced a loss of their industrial base, Harrisburg shifted to a service-oriented base, with industries such as health care and convention centers playing a big role. Harrisburg’s greatest problem was a shrinking city population after 1950. [...] This loss in population followed a national trend and was a delayed result of the decline of Harrisburg’s steel industry. This decline began <b>almost</b> <b>imperceptibly</b> in the late 1880s, but did not become evident until the early 20th century.|$|E
2500|$|Species {{assigned}} to the genus Leptotes have a short cylindrical rhizome. They have small pseudobulbs that <b>almost</b> <b>imperceptibly</b> prolongate in one, rarely two, terete fleshy leaves. They have variable characteristics and can be short or long, erect or hanging, dark green or purple, and often have a wrinkly surface and a deeper ridge in the face. The inflorescence is apical, generally short, and grows from {{the apex of the}} pseudobulb without a protecting spathe and bears up to seven flowers, although fewer are more common. The flowers are relatively large when compared to the overall plant dimensions, normally partially bent and in some species forming groups with a very showy aspect. They are fragrant and this perfume can last from ten to twenty days.: Serra dos Órgãos sua história e suas orquídeas, p. 240. Rio de Janeiro, 2006.|$|E
2500|$|Early in {{the second}} half, Michigan scored its second {{touchdown}} and converted the extra point to take a 12–5 lead. [...] Widman ran 65 yards for the touchdown on a [...] "delayed pass" [...] on the most exciting play of the game. [...] The Chicago Daily Tribune described Widman's run:"Widman scurried {{out of the back}} of the mass of players with the ball under his arm and down the field with nothing in sight ahead of him except the goal posts. [...] All the fast men of the Chicago team went in fast pursuit. [...] It was a beautiful race down the field. [...] Three Chicago men were close behind. [...] But the blue-legged runner gained <b>almost</b> <b>imperceptibly</b> at times, and then barely held his own. [...] He could run as fast as his pursuers, and with his start was safe. [...] If one or two of those Chicago players had made a dive for him perhaps he might have been stopped. One of them did try up near the goal, but missed him, tripping him slightly, but he rolled over the line. [...] Michigan had another touchdown and the game, and the Western championship in its pocket." ...|$|E
2500|$|The late 16th century Safed {{commentator}} Moshe Alshich {{noted that}} [...] appears to repeat [...] "Be careful lest you forget the Lord your God." [...] Alshich {{explained that the}} evil urge ( [...] , yetzer hara) works iteratively to subvert a person's character. The evil urge knows that {{it is easier to}} subvert successful people into believing in the success of their own efforts than to convince people of average means that they do not need God. Alshich taught that [...] thus reflects the way that the evil urge works. The process of moving away from serving God can be gradual, <b>almost</b> <b>imperceptibly</b> slow. It can start not by failing to observe the commandments, but by failing to see them as God's will. Thus [...] reflects that one can observe the commandments only for the sake of obtaining the reward that the Torah promises. [...] reflects the next step that one might eat and be satisfied without giving credit to God. After this, as [...] reports, one might give one's self credit for one's success. Still later, in [...] one might give credit to idols. Moses thus warns against the insidious, indirect way that the evil urge attacks.|$|E
