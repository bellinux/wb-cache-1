5000|$|One {{example of}} a non-transitive {{relation}} is [...] "city x {{can be reached via}} <b>a</b> direct <b>flight</b> <b>from</b> city y" [...] on the set of all cities. Simply because there is <b>a</b> direct <b>flight</b> <b>from</b> one city to a second city, and <b>a</b> direct <b>flight</b> <b>from</b> the second city to the third, does not imply there is <b>a</b> direct <b>flight</b> <b>from</b> the first city to the third. The transitive closure of this relation is a different relation, namely [...] "there is a sequence of direct flights that begins at city x and ends at city y". Every relation can be extended in a similar way to a transitive relation.|$|R

5|$|Levin {{was interviewed}} by police in November 1985, when he said Winston Silcott had led the attack with a machete; he told the court in 2014 that {{that had been a}} mistake. The court heard that, during Nove's 1992–1994 investigation, police offered Levin {{immunity}} from prosecution, gave him £5,000 and paid for <b>a</b> <b>flight</b> <b>from</b> Spain when he missed his flight home from a holiday. They approached him again in January 2008 for his testimony and helped him with expenses and a deposit for accommodation.|$|E
5|$|Petersen {{has claimed}} in an {{interview}} that one of the film's scenes forced the crew to adopt a guerrilla filmmaking approach. The scene in which Petersen's character Will Graham falls asleep while studying crime scene photographs during a flight required the use of an airplane during shooting. Michael Mann had been unable to gain permission to use a plane for the scene and booked tickets for the crew on <b>a</b> <b>flight</b> <b>from</b> Chicago to Florida. Once on board, the crew used their equipment, checked in as hand luggage, to shoot the scene quickly, while keeping the plane's passengers and crew mollified with Manhunter crew jackets.|$|E
5|$|Star Dust (registration G-AGWH) was a British South American Airways (BSAA) Avro Lancastrian {{airliner}} which {{crashed into}} Mount Tupungato in the Argentine Andes on 2 August 1947, during <b>a</b> <b>flight</b> <b>from</b> Buenos Aires to Santiago, Chile. A comprehensive {{search of a}} wide area (including what is now {{known to have been}} the crash site) was fruitless, and the fate of the aircraft and occupants remained unknown for over 50 years. An investigation in 2000 after wreckage of G-AGWH had been found determined that the crash was caused by weather-related factors, but until then speculation had included theories of international intrigue, intercorporate sabotage and even abduction by aliens.|$|E

5|$|A 1989 {{document}} generally {{known as}} Aspects of Christian meditation set forth {{the position of}} the Holy See with respect to the differences between Christian and eastern styles of meditation. The document, issued as a letter to all Catholic bishops, stresses the differences between Christian and eastern meditative approaches. It warns of the dangers of attempting to mix Christian meditation with eastern approaches since that could be both confusing and misleading, and may result in the loss of the essential Christocentric nature of Christian meditation. The letter warned that euphoric states obtained through Eastern meditation {{should not be confused with}} prayer or assumed to be signs of the presence of God, a state that should always result in loving service to others. Without these truths, the letter said, meditation, which should be <b>a</b> <b>flight</b> <b>from</b> the self, can degenerate into a form of self-absorption.|$|E
5|$|A Junkers F.13 {{called at}} Lympne on 10 January 1923 {{to clear customs}} and then flew to Croydon where it was {{inspected}} by Secretary of State for Air Sir Samuel Hoare. In February, {{it was reported that}} Lympne had taken part in a test of the newly introduced Mayday radio signal used by aircraft to indicate that they were in distress. Georges Barbot won a prize of F.25,000 from Le Matin when he made <b>a</b> <b>flight</b> <b>from</b> St Inglevert to Lympne and back again on the same day, 6 May. He flew the route in a Dewoitine aircraft fitted with a Clerget engine. On landing a bracing wire in the undercarriage of the aircraft broke, but repairs were effected within half an hour. Problems starting the engine then delayed his departure slightly. On 28 October the Light Aircraft Trials were held (see below). In 1923, Air Union started a service flying newspapers to Lympne using a Farman F.60 Goliath.|$|E
5|$|In Guam, {{the threat}} of Typhoon Isa {{postponed}} <b>a</b> <b>flight</b> <b>from</b> Guam to Honolulu, Hawaii for 48hours. The flight was the last in , which was a multimillion-dollar humanitarian effort to transport more than 6,600Kurds in a political asylum to the mainland of the United States. The threat of the typhoon also canceled {{the first round of}} the Omega Tour golf event, which was the second professional golf tournament in the island's history. Though Typhoon Isa passed well to the south of Guam, one of its outer rainbands stalled across the island, which dropped heavy rainfall of 15–25cm (6–10in) across the island. The rainfall was welcome as it occurred during the dry season, and largely contributed to rainfall at the Guam International Airport being 45% above normal from the period between January through April. The rainband also produced wind gusts that reached 86km/h (53mph) at the island's Naval Air Station; the winds resulted in sporadic power outages across the island. The typhoon caused some light damage to buildings, particularly on the south side of the island. The combination of winds and sea salt caused damage to the island's tomato, okra, cucumber, and soy bean crops.|$|E

5|$|Less {{than a year}} later, one of Crosby's game-worn sweaters {{disappeared}}. The jersey he wore in {{his first}} NHL game, played against the New Jersey Devils, disappeared from his father's luggage during <b>a</b> <b>flight</b> <b>from</b> Pittsburgh to Buffalo. The jersey was later found at the Pittsburgh International Airport between {{a piece of equipment}} and a stairwell. Crosby's jersey from his third NHL game was the highest-selling NHL jersey in an auction for Hurricane Katrina relief – it sold for $21,010. During an online auction held by the NHL and the NHL Players Association to benefit Hockey Fights Cancer, Crosby's game-worn jersey from the first period of the 2007 All-Star Game earned the most money. Crosby's sold for $47,520, more than eight times the next highest price—$5,681 for the jersey worn by Brendan Shanahan of the New York Rangers.|$|E
5|$|Still hankering after a {{full-time}} career in flying, Holden {{enlisted the help}} of friends to purchase a de Havilland DH.61 Giant Moth in 1928. He named it Canberra, and used it to start a charter operation out of Mascot Aerodrome in Sydney. Holden became a national celebrity in April 1929 when he successfully undertook an aerial search of the north-western Australian wilderness to locate Charles Kingsford Smith and Charles Ulm, after the pair had gone missing on <b>a</b> <b>flight</b> <b>from</b> Sydney to England in the Southern Cross. Two other searchers, Keith Anderson and Bob Hitchcock, were lost in their aircraft, the Kookaburra. The media of the day turned on Smith and Ulm, accusing them of a publicity stunt, and the Sydney Citizens' Relief Committee, which had commissioned Holden to undertake the rescue operation, withheld payment of his expenses. He nevertheless continued flying commercially, and is credited with making—in September 1931—possibly the first flight from Sydney to New Guinea, where he started an air freight service. Returning to Sydney the following year, he established Holden's Air Transport Services. He also acquired two more aircraft for his New Guinea operations, a Waco and a Moth, to supplement the Canberra.|$|E
5|$|Malley relinquished his {{appointment}} in the Commonwealth Military Forces on 18June 1925. The following day, he was commissioned a flight {{lieutenant in the}} Citizen Air Force, the part-time active reserve of the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). He served as a pilot with No.3 Squadron, which operated Airco DH.9s and Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5s. Formed at RAAF Point Cook, Victoria, the squadron transferred to the newly opened RAAF Richmond, New South Wales, on 30June. From 1925 to 1928, Malley was {{vice president of the}} Australian Flying Corps Association. In January 1928, he was promoted to honorary squadron leader, and temporarily commanded No.3 Squadron in March–April. That year, he gave up his position with Malley's to become an aviation consultant to Australian National Airways (ANA), as well as a director of the company. In January–February 1929, he again temporarily commanded No.3 Squadron. That April, {{he was a member of}} the citizens' committee responsible for organising and funding the search for the Southern Cross and its crew, Charles Kingsford Smith and Charles Ulm, who had force-landed in North West Australia during <b>a</b> <b>flight</b> <b>from</b> Richmond to England. Les Holden eventually located the missing airmen near the Kimberley region. In 1930, Malley transferred to the (inactive) RAAF Reserve.|$|E
