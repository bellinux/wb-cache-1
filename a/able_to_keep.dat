5|$|According to the {{theology}} of Twelvers, the Twelve Imams are exemplary human individuals who not only rule over the community with justice, but also are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> and interpret sharia and the esoteric meaning of the Quran. Muhammad and Imams' words and deeds are a guide and model for the community to follow; as a result, they must be free from error and sin (known as ismah, or infallibility) and must be chosen by divine decree, or nass, through the Prophet.|$|E
5|$|Although Michael Kopper {{worked at}} Enron {{for more than}} seven years, Lay did not know of Kopper even after the company's bankruptcy. Kopper was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> his name {{anonymous}} in the entire affair. Kopper was the first Enron executive to plead guilty. Chief Accounting Officer Rick Causey was indicted with six felony charges for disguising Enron's financial condition during his tenure. After pleading not guilty, he later switched to guilty and was sentenced to seven years in prison.|$|E
50|$|On 27 August 2009, the ACMA {{announced}} that the station would be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>keeps</b> its frequency with ABC Local Radio having to find another location to broadcast to the region. This followed widespread support from listeners and Local Government for The Pulse.|$|R

5|$|Although silk {{was well}} known in Europe and most of Asia, China was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> a near {{monopoly}} on silk production. The monopoly was defended by an imperial decree, condemning to death anyone attempting to export silkworms or their eggs. Only around the year 300 CE did a Japanese expedition succeed in taking some silkworm eggs and four young Chinese girls, who were forced to teach their captors the art of sericulture. Techniques of sericulture were subsequently introduced to Japan {{on a larger scale}} by frequent diplomatic exchanges between the 8th century and 9th centuries.|$|E
5|$|Around midnight 7/8 June, {{during the}} slow voyage across the Channel, a German {{airplane}} hit West Honaker with two skip bombs. Because the ship, already {{prepared for a}} fast sinking for the blockship duties, began taking on water, {{a large portion of}} the crew, including Chief Engineer Poropat, abandoned ship. After drifting in the Channel for most of the rest of the moonless night, they were picked up in the morning by a British trawler and returned to the UK. In the meantime, the master of the ship was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> West Honaker in the convoy headed to Utah beach.|$|E

As a result, the Big Ten set a record for most matchups between two top 10 opponents in conference play {{with a total of}} 9 such games. Michigan played in six with a 3–3 record and Indiana played in five, winning all of them. Michigan State, Minnesota and Ohio State also played in top 10 games.|$|E

5|$|Caroline and {{her second}} husband {{divorced}} soon after, and she was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the bulk of her wealth intact (though she settled on Durrieux a sum of one million dollars in order to retain custody of her two sons). Various suitors often in her entourage, such as Count Boni de Castellane and Gaston Bonnefoy, were reported to be engaged or interested in her, particularly after her divorce. She never remarried. Caroline's younger son died in 1914, but the elder lived a long, quiet life on his inherited wealth, dying in 1984.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{suffering}} {{shortages of}} pilots and equipment, No.84 Wing was generally <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> {{pace with the}} army's requirements. A detachment of No.36 Squadron, flying C-47 Dakotas, was employed to augment the wing's supply capabilities. Up {{until the end of}} June 1945, No.5 Squadron had flown almost 2,000 sorties and No.17 AOP Flight over 1,300, while No.10 Local Air Supply Unit and the No.36 Squadron detachment had accounted for almost 1,000 between them. As the navigational efficiency of the New Zealander pilots increased, demands on the Boomerangs and Wirraways lessened, and the bulk of the reconnaissance duties fell to the Austers of No.17 AOP Flight.|$|E
5|$|Dinoflagellates may use {{bioluminescence}} for defence against predators. They shine {{when they}} detect a predator, possibly making the predator itself more vulnerable by attracting {{the attention of}} predators from higher trophic levels. Grazing copepods release any phytoplankton cells that flash, unharmed; if they were eaten they would make the copepods glow, attracting predators, so the phytoplankton's bioluminescence is defensive. The problem of shining stomach contents is solved (and the explanation corroborated) in predatory deep-sea fishes: their stomachs have a black lining <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the light from any bioluminescent fish prey which they have swallowed from attracting larger predators.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} part of the 18thcentury, John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, kept red and white King Charles type spaniels for hunting. The duke {{recorded}} that they were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> up with a trotting horse. His estate was named Blenheim in honour of his victory at the Battle of Blenheim. Because of this influence, the red and white variety of the King Charles Spaniel and thus the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel became known as the Blenheim.|$|E
5|$|In 1605 Charles, now Charles IX, the King of Sweden, {{launched}} a new offensive, but his efforts were crossed by Chodkiewicz's victories at Kircholm and elsewhere and the Polish naval successes, while the war continued without a decisive resolution being produced. In the armistice of 1611 the Commonwealth was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> {{the majority of the}} contested areas, as a variety of internal and foreign difficulties, including the inability to pay the mercenary soldiers and the Union's new involvement in Russia, precluded a comprehensive victory.|$|E
5|$|The {{expedition}} {{into the}} Peloponnese {{was a disaster}} for Epiriote ambitions. Although Helenus was permitted by Antigonus {{to return to his}} homeland with the remainder of his army, Epirus ceased to be a regional power. Pyrrhus' son and successor, Alexander II of Epirus was granted generous terms by the Macedonian king. Epirus was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> Pyrrhus' conquests of Tymphaea, Parauaea and Atintania in western Macedon. Antigonus realised that an independent Epirus was essential in order to act as a buffer against the Illyrians to the north.|$|E
50|$|Stacie {{says that}} the home she and Laurel have made {{together}} {{is more than just}} a house to them, and that she would like <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> it following Laurel's death. As an auto mechanic, Stacie does not earn much money and would be unlikely <b>to</b> be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> afford <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the house without the pension. Laurel and Stacie are also struggling to pay doctors' bills for Laurel's treatment. Laurel says that if they were a heterosexual couple there would be no problem with Stacie receiving the pension. With not long to live, Laurel says that her only priority is spending time with Stacie and obtaining justice for her.|$|R

50|$|Graduate {{members of}} Delta Psi {{immediately}} undertook a fundraising campaign {{to pay for}} the renovation of the aging Delta Psi house, as well as maintain the unoccupied property until such time as the undergraduate organization could be restored. By 2005 they reported raising $1.2 million from alumni, short of the $2 million needed.When the house lost its property tax exempt status due to lack of student occupancy, the fraternity was no longer <b>able</b> <b>to</b> pay <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> it.

5|$|The next German {{aircraft}} on the scene, a Junkers 88, {{was engaged}} by a RAF Bristol Beaufighter which {{had appeared in}} the area earlier. Both machines crashed into the sea. Other German planes arrived but were driven off by Beaufighters and Hudsons from Coastal Command. The Atlantic weather conditions deteriorated. Amid concerns about the growing German threat and the realisation that the damaged small ships would not be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> up, Commander Sayer ordered the crews off the smaller boats and had them sunk.|$|E
5|$|The road charged 25 cents ($ {{in modern}} dollars) for saddle horses and twice that for two-axle stagecoaches. The tolls, {{collected}} at three separate gates, primarily reflected {{the cost of}} retaining a large crew of men with snow shovels to keep the road open in wintertime; they were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the road open through its first five winters. When the snow was too deep, sleighs were used instead. During the summer the stages {{were able to take}} the switchbacks at full speed, with dogs running in advance to warn other traffic. A typical voyage over the pass required 10–25 hours and five changes of horses.|$|E
5|$|The {{werewolf}} {{is revealed}} to be Angelika's father, who is under the Queen's spell. It turns out that he is only <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> on living due to an enchanted spike that is lodged into his chest and, without such, the spell is broken. Angelika is drowned by her father, becoming the 12th victim. The Brothers reach the tower while the Queen breathes an ice wind that puts out the forest fire. Delatombe notices that the Grimms have escaped and goes after them with Cavaldi. When Cavaldi refuses to kill the Grimms, Delatombe shoots him but is later impaled by Will.|$|E
5000|$|A {{significant}} {{advantage that}} bio-batteries have {{in comparison to}} other batteries is their ability to allow an instant recharge. [...] In other words, through a constant supply of sugar, or glucose, bio batteries are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> continuously <b>keep</b> themselves charged without an external power supply. Bio batteries are also a source of non-flammable, and non-toxic fuel. This provides a clean alternative renewable power source.|$|R
5000|$|After making {{only six}} Premier League starts, scoring no goals and having zero assists, {{and not being}} <b>able</b> <b>to</b> help <b>keep</b> West Ham out of relegation, Barrera's first season in England was {{considered}} a [...] "flop".

5|$|Upon the {{rejection}} of these conditions, there was an outburst of strikes that rapidly spread throughout the island, and was marked by violent social conflict, almost rising {{to the point of}} insurrection. The leaders of the movement were not <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the situation from getting out of control. The proprietors and landowners asked the government to intervene, and Prime Minister Francesco Crispi {{declared a state of emergency}} in January 1894, dissolving the organizations, arresting its leaders and restoring order through the use of extreme force. Some reforms followed, including workmen's compensation and pension schemes. The suppression of the strikes also led to an increase in emigration.|$|E
5|$|With Baker {{guarding}} the crossing at San Felipe de Austin, and Martin {{guarding the}} Morton Ferry crossing at Ford Bend, Santa Anna opted on April 12 {{to cross the}} Brazos halfway between at Thompson's Ferry, with Sesma's men and artillery crossing over the next day. The Mexican army attacked the steamer numerous times {{in an attempt to}} capture it, but Ross successfully used cotton bales to protect the steamer and its cargo, and was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the Yellowstone away from Mexican control. Houston released the steamboat from service on April 14, and it continued to Galveston.|$|E
5|$|Although Morton was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> {{the state}} united {{during the first}} phase of the war, once {{emancipation}} became an issue in 1862, the Republicans suffered a major defeat in the mid-term elections, and Morton lost the support of the strong Democratic majority in the legislature. Before the new legislature convened in 1863, Morton began circulating reports that the Democrats intended to seize control of the state government, secede from the Union, and instigate riots. The Democrats responded with harsh criticisms of Morton and Lincoln, the conduct of the war, and the issues of emancipation and the loss of constitutional rights, among others. Accusations on both sides created a tense atmosphere that only worsened relation between the two parties and guaranteed further confrontations.|$|E

25|$|Even {{before the}} {{downlink}} signal was lost due to distance, the hydrazine attitude control {{fuel on board}} the spacecraft was considered likely to freeze, as the radioisotope thermal generators (RTGs) failed to generate enough power for the heaters to overcome radiative heat loss into space. Once the hydrazine froze, the spacecraft {{would no longer be}} <b>able</b> <b>to</b> maneuver <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> its high gain antenna pointing towards Earth, and the downlink signal would then be lost in a matter of days. The failure of the X-band communications subsystem hastened this, because the coldest part of the fuel pipework was routed over the X-band TWTAs, because when one of them was operating, this kept this part of the pipework warm enough.|$|R
