5|$|The {{hurricane}} produced light {{rainfall and}} high tides <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> Coast of the United States. Some low-level flooding was reported, but damage was slight. In Mexico, the hurricane caused strong winds and moderate rainfall. The winds caused extensive damage to villages in northeastern Mexico, with about 25,000 people left homeless. The rainfall, reaching over 17.52inches (445mm), caused flooding and mudslides which killed eleven people in Tamaulipas. Overall damage is unknown.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} requiem sharks, the blacktip shark {{exhibits}} vivipary. Females typically {{give birth to}} four to seven (range one to 10) pups every other year, making use of shallow coastal nurseries that offer plentiful food and fewer predators. Known nurseries include Pine Island Sound, Terra Ceia Bay, and Yankeetown <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> Coast of Florida, Bulls Bay {{on the coast of}} South Carolina, and Pontal do Paraná on the coast of Brazil. Although adult blacktip sharks are highly mobile and disperse over long distances, they are philopatric and return to their original nursery areas to give birth. This results in a series of genetically distinct breeding stocks that overlap in geographic range.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{the city}} of Galveston was a booming {{metropolis}} with a population of 37,000. Its position on the natural harbor of Galveston Bay <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> of Mexico made it the center of trade in Texas, and one of the largest cotton ports in the nation, in competition with New Orleans. Between 1838 and 1842, 18 newspapers were started to serve the island's rapidly growing population (The Galveston County Daily News is the sole survivor). A causeway linking the island with the mainland was finished in 1860, which paved the way for railroad expansion.|$|E

5|$|In the United States, {{the storm}} wrought {{extensive}} damage <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> Coast. At least 371 {{people were killed}} by the storm; however, this is considered a conservative estimate and the true death toll may never be known. Of the known fatalities, 353 took place in Louisiana and 18 in Mississippi. This makes the 1909 Grand Isle hurricane the eleventh deadliest hurricane in United States history. However, {{at the time of its}} occurrence, it was the sixth deadliest storm in the country. Damage throughout Louisiana and Mississippi was estimated to be at least $10million (1909USD).|$|E
5|$|Learning {{from his}} father, Favre became fluent in the {{languages}} of French, English, Spanish, and the Muskogean languages including Choctaw and Chickasaw.

On September 3, 1783 the British ceded their lands in both East and West Florida to Spain under the Treaty of Versailles. Favre's father had just died the year before this treaty, and Simon Favre followed his father's career, also inheriting his father's plantation on the Pearl River, though continuing to reside in Mobile near his mother.|$|E

5|$|Proxy records {{based on}} paleotempestological {{research}} {{have revealed that}} major hurricane activity <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> of Mexico coast varies on timescales of centuries to millennia. Few major hurricanes struck the Gulf coast during 3000–1400 BC and again during the most recent millennium. These quiescent intervals were separated by a hyperactive period during 1400 BC and 1000 AD, when the Gulf coast was struck frequently by catastrophic hurricanes and their landfall probabilities increased by 3–5 times. This millennial-scale variability {{has been attributed to}} long-term shifts in the position of the Azores High, which may also be linked to changes in the strength of the North Atlantic Oscillation.|$|E

About 24hours prior to landfall, the watch was replaced with a warning from Santa Fe to San Evaristo, and the tropical storm watch was extended along both sides of the peninsula. Prior to it making landfall, more than 2,500families in susceptible areas left their homes. Officials opened several shelters in the area where the storm struck.|$|E

5|$|The 1987 Gulf Coast {{tropical}} storm caused flooding <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> Coast of the United States. The second tropical cyclone and first {{tropical storm}} of the 1987 Atlantic hurricane season, it originated from a tropical wave in the Gulf of Mexico, southeast of Texas, on August9. Initially a tropical depression, the cyclone moved north-northwestward and slightly intensified into {{a tropical storm}} later that day. By August10, it made landfall between Galveston and Beaumont. The system weakened after moving inland and turned towards the east and later southeast. Briefly reemerging over the Gulf on August15, the depression moved onshore a second time in Florida, before dissipating over eastern Georgia on August17.|$|E

In Mississippi, over 300,000 cotton bales were ruined during the hurricane, amounting to $12,000,000 in damage. Damage in New Orleans was minimal; however, Lake Pontchartrain overflowed, flooding the city. The hurricane killed a total of 134 people.|$|E
