50|$|The {{cleaning}} {{performance of}} the bristle blasting process {{is a consequence of}} synchronized impact of the bristle tips onto the target surface. The tool head with the bristle belt rotates at approximately 2,500 rpm. A so-called 'accelerator bar' detains the bristle tips and by releasing them increases their kinetic energy with which they strike the surface. Immediately after the bristles strike the corroded steel surface, they retract (rebound) from the surface ('single-impact'), which results in corrosion removal and a micro-identation that exposes the sheer metallic surface. The multitude of such primary impact craters generates a texture and surface which in visual cleanliness and roughness (<b>anchor</b> <b>profile)</b> mimics those obtained by grit blasting processes. The cleaned and coarsened surface is deemed favorable for the subsequent application and adhesion of protective films and industrial coatings.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) -anchored mucins of Trypanosoma cruzi trypomastigotes play an {{important}} immunomodulatory role {{during the course of}} Chagas disease. Here, some biological activities of tGPI-mucins from four T. cruzi isolates, including benznidazole-susceptible (BZS-Y), benznidazole-resistant (BZR-Y), CL, and Colombiana, were evaluated. GPI-mucins were able to differentially trigger the production of interleukin- 12 and nitric oxide in BALB/c macrophages and modulate LLC-MK 2 cell invasion. The significance of these variations was assessed after analysis of the terminal a-galactosyl residues. Enzymatic treatment with a-galactosidase indicated a differential expression of O-linked a-galactosyl residues among the strains, with higher expression of this sugar in BZS-Y and BZR-Y T. cruzi populations followed by Colombiana and CL.

40|$|Bristle {{blasting}} {{is a new}} {{and unique}} corrosion-removal process that is rapidly gaining widespread acceptance among engineers and practitioners in the corrosion/ surface preparation community. Engineers from the ship construction and repair industries face a constant corrosive threat to ships 2 ̆ 7 steel infrastructure and welded joints. To this end, great care is exercised in protecting the vessels 2 ̆ 7 structural integrity and longevity, while maintenance engineers in the ship-building industry seek new methods to improve surface preparation that will not compromise the surface cleanliness and <b>anchor</b> <b>profile</b> required for proper adhesion of paints and coatings. In this study, the cleanliness and texture of surfaces generated by the bristle blasting process are examined and reported. Specifically, the present work is aimed at evaluating the cleanliness, surface profile, and material removal performance {{that can be achieved}} for steels (ABS-A and AH- 36) that are commonly used in ship-building Industries. In addition, the bristle-blasting process 2 ̆ 7 ability to clean and prepare welded joints fabricated from both ABS-A and AH- 36 steel is evaluated as well. The experiments carried out in this study also assess the relationship between tool longevity and surface texture performance, which can form a basis for estimating the overall life expectancy of the bristle-blasting tool. The results of the surface generated by the bristle-blasting process is compared to that generated by other conventional surface-finishing tools. A direct comparison with visual standards that are commonly used for training and certification purposes is carried out, hence, ensuring the proper characterization of the bristle blasting process in the ship construction and repair industry...|$|E

40|$|Despite {{advances}} in paints and coatings technology, protective coatings {{are prone to}} eventual corrosion, degradation and/or failure. Consequently, a corrosive layer will develop that can undermine the performance and integrity of structural components. Therefore, both the corrosive layer and defunct coating must be periodically removed, and an acceptable level of surface cleanliness and texture must be obtained prior to the reapplication of new paint. Currently, an array of processes and equipment are used for efficiently cleaning and conditioning metallic surfaces, such as grit blasting, needle guns, {{and a variety of}} non-woven and coated abrasive tools. This research investigates the method termed the 2 ̆ 2 bristle blasting 2 ̆ 2 process. The process utilizes a specially designed rotary bristle tool, which is dynamically tuned to a power tool spindle that operates at approximately 2, 500 rpm. The present research suggests that the repeated collision of hardened bristle tips with a corroded steel surface results in both the removal of a friable corrosive layer and simultaneous exposure of fresh subsurface material. Surfaces generated by the bristle blast process are shown to mimic the visual cleanliness and <b>anchor</b> <b>profile</b> that is characteristic of grit blasting processes. One particular application evaluated during this research was offshore pipeline refurbishment and pre-treatment of weld seams prior to the application of protective coatings. Comparative analysis was done with conventional methods of surface treatment on the basis of visual cleanliness, surface profile generation and coating adhesion strength. The results obtained suggest that this novel technology performs better than the existing conventional power tool methods and is on an equal par with grit blasting methods. Moreover, the bristle blasting process is eco-friendly and does not use or generate hazardous waste, thereby providing a 2 ̆ 2 green 2 ̆ 2 approach to corrosion removal and surface preparation of steel components...|$|E
40|$|Headquarters National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) {{chartered}} the Acquisition Pollution Prevention (AP 2) Office {{to coordinate}} agency activities affecting pollution prevention issues identified during system and component acquisition and sustainment processes. The primary {{objectives of the}} AP 2 Office are to: (1) Reduce or eliminate the use of hazardous materials (HazMats) or hazardous processes at manufacturing, remanufacturing, and sustainment locations. (2) Avoid duplication of effort in actions required to reduce or eliminate HazMats through joint center cooperation and technology sharing. To achieve a substrate condition suitable {{for the application of}} a coating system, both new and old (in-situ) substrates must undergo some type of surface preparation and/or depainting operation to ensure adhesion of the new coating system. The level of cleanliness or <b>anchor</b> <b>profile</b> desired is typically a function of the type of coating to be applied and the specification being adhered to. In high performance environments, cleanliness and surface profile requirements for carbon steel (the dominant substrate for facilities, structures and equipment) dictates the use of abrasive media. Many of the abrasive media currently used across NASA and Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) installations generate large quantities of fugitive particulate emissions and waste. The high quantities of airborne dust and waste generated from these operations pose significant environmental concern. Efforts to contain emissions and the reduce quantity of waste generated have significant implications on project cost; this is often a deterrent to engaging in maintenance activities. In response to recent technological developments and NASA's and AFSPC's need to undertake environmentally conscious corrosion prevention projects, a review of the industry needs to be undertaken to evaluate surface preparation technologies (materials and processes) for embrace. This project will identify, evaluate and approve alternative surface preparation technologies for use at NASA and AFSPC installations. Materials and processes will be evaluated with the goal of selecting those processes that will improve corrosion protection at critical systems, facilitate easier maintenance activity, extend maintenance cycles, eliminate flight hardware contamination and reduce the amount of hazardous waste generated. This Field Evaluations Test Plan defines the field evaluation and testing requirements for validating alternative surface preparation/depainting technologies and supplements the JTP. The field evaluations will be performed at Stennis Space Center, Mississippi, under the oversight of the Project Engineer.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{study is}} presented on {{the shape of}} the interface between coexisting isotropic and nematic phases in contact with a solid vertical wall. The interface profile is determined by a competition between three surface tensions, two anchoring strengths, gravity, and the Frank elastic constants of the director field. In the weak-anchoring limit, the director field is rigid and uniform, and we find the capillary rise height to depend nontrivially on the orientation of the director field relative to the solid-fluid interface. For strong surface anchoring, the director field adjusts to the preferred homeotropic or planar anchoring at the solid-liquid and liquid-liquid interfaces. The shape of the interfacial profile is now a function of the balance between the surface energy and the splay and bend elastic deformation energies. Interestingly, for both weak and strong <b>anchoring</b> the <b>profile</b> decays nonmonotonically albeit only very weakly so.

We present a method to modulate existing electron density models by multiplication: M (h, &#x 03 C 6;, &#x 03 BB;, t) = L (h, &#x 03 C 6;, &#x 03 BB;, t) &#x 00 D 7; S 1 (h, &#x 03 C 6;, &#x 03 BB;, t) &#x 00 D 7; S 2 (h, &#x 03 C 6;, &#x 03 BB;, t) &#x 00 D 7; [...] . S n (h, &#x 03 C 6;, &#x 03 BB;, t) M : resulting electron density distribution, L : large scale model, S 1 [...] . S n : modulating models for n the smaller scale structures; h : height; φ, λ : geographic coordinates, t : Universal Time. There are no restrictions {{to the nature of}} the large scale model provided it takes height and horizontal coordinates as input. Examples are models of the "profiler" type which use large scale "maps" for <b>profile</b> <b>anchor</b> points (e. g., E, F 1, F 2 peak properties) like the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI). Typical examples for smaller scale structures are ridges, troughs and wavelike disturbances. The advantage of modulation by multiplication is that there is no danger to get zero or negative values of electron density as long as the background and modulations are > 0 everywhere. For each modulation model, unity means "undisturbed"...|$|R
40|$|Chemically {{resolved}} {{atmospheric aerosol}} data sets from the largest intercomparison of the Aerodyne aerosol chemical speciation monitors (ACSMs) performed to date were {{collected at the}} French atmospheric supersite SIRTA. In total 13 quadrupole ACSMs (Q-ACSM) from the European ACTRIS ACSM network, one time-of-flight ACSM (ToF-ACSM), and one high-resolution ToF aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) were operated in parallel for about 3 weeks in November and December similar to 2013. Part 1 of this study reports on the accuracy and precision of the instruments for all the measured species. In this work {{we report on the}} intercomparison of organic components and the results from factor analysis source apportionment by positive matrix factorisation (PMF) utilising the multilinear engine 2 (ME- 2). Except for the organic contribution of mass-to-charge ratio m/z 44 to the total organics (f(44)), which varied by factors between 0. 6 and 1. 3 compared to the mean, the peaks in the organic mass spectra were similar among instruments. The m/z 44 differences in the spectra resulted in a variable f(44) in the source profiles extracted by ME- 2, but had only a minor influence on the extracted mass contributions of the sources. The presented source apportionment yielded four factors for all 15 instruments: hydrocarbon-like organic aerosol (HOA), cooking-related organic aerosol (COA), biomass burning-related organic aerosol (BBOA) and secondary oxygenated organic aerosol (OOA). ME- 2 boundary conditions (profile constraints) were optimised individually by means of correlation to external data in order to achieve equivalent / comparable solutions for all ACSM instruments and the results are discussed together with the investigation of the influence of alternative <b>anchors</b> (reference <b>profiles).</b> A comparison of the ME- 2 source apportionment output of all 15 instruments resulted in relative standard deviations (SD) from the mean between 13. 7 and 22. 7 % of the source's average mass contribution depending on the factors (HOA: 14. 3 +/- 2. 2 %, COA: 15. 0 +/- 3. 4 %, OOA: 41. 5 +/- 5. 7 %, BBOA: 29. 3 +/- 5. 0 %). Factors which tend to be subject to minor factor mixing (in this case COA) have higher relative uncertainties than factors which are recognised more readily like the OOA. Averaged over all factors and instruments the relative first SD from the mean of a source extracted with ME- 2 was 17. 2 %...|$|R
40|$|Corrections {{to general}} {{relativity}} that introduce long-ranged scalar fields which are nonminimally coupled to curvature typically predict that neutron stars possess a nontrivial scalar field <b>profile</b> <b>anchored</b> to the star. An observer {{far from a}} star is most sensitive to the spherically symmetric piece of this profile that decays linearly with the inverse of {{the distance to the}} source, the so-called scalar monopole charge, which is related to the emission of dipolar radiation from compact binary systems. The presence of dipolar radiation has the potential to rule out or very strongly constrain extended theories of gravity. These facts may lead people to believe that gravitational theories that introduce long-ranged scalar fields have already been constrained strongly from binary pulsar observations. Here we challenge this “lore” by investigating the decoupling limit of Gauss-Bonnet gravity as an example, in which the scalar field couples linearly to the Gauss-Bonnet density in the action. We prove a theorem that neutron stars in this theory cannot possess a scalar charge, due to the topological nature of the Gauss-Bonnet density. Thus Gauss-Bonnet gravity evades the strong binary pulsar constraints on dipole radiation. We discuss the astrophysical systems which will yield the best constraints on Gauss-Bonnet gravity and related quadratic gravity theories. To achieve this we compute the scalar charge in quadratic gravity theories by performing explicit analytic and numerical matching calculations for slowly rotating neutron stars. In generic quadratic gravity theories, either neutron star–binary or neutron star–black hole systems can be used to constrain the theory, but because of the vanishing charge, Gauss-Bonnet gravity evades the neutron star–binary constraints. However, in contrast to neutron stars, black holes in Gauss-Bonnet gravity do anchor scalar charge, because of the difference in topology. The best constraints on Gauss-Bonnet gravity will thus come from accurate black hole observations, for example through gravitational waves from inspiraling binaries or the timing of pulsar–black hole binaries with radio telescopes. We estimate these constraints to be a factor of 10 better than the current estimated bound, and also include estimated constraints on generic quadratic gravity theories from pulsar timing...|$|R
40|$|Video based {{remote sensing}} {{techniques}} are {{well suited to}} collect spatially resolved wave images in the surf zone with breaking waves and dynamic bathymetric changes. An advanced video-based depth inversion method is developed to remotely survey bathymetry in the surf zone. The present method involves image processing of original wave image sequences, wave property estimation based on linear feature extraction from the processed image sequences, and is combined with a nonlinear depth inversion model. The original wave image sequences are processed through video image frame differencing and directional low-pass filtering schemes to remove wave-breaking-induced foam noise having high frequencies in the surf zone. The features of individual crest trajectories are extracted from the processed and rectified image sequences, i. e. processed image cross-shore timestacks, by tracking pixels of high intensity within an interrogation window of a Radon-transform-based line-detection algorithm. The wave celerity is computed using space-time information of the extracted trajectories of individual wave crests in the cross-shore timestack domain. The presented retrieval of nearshore bathymetry from video image sequences {{is based on a}} nonlinear depth inversion using the nonlinear shallow water wave theory. The nonlinear wave amplitude dispersion effects at the breaker points are determined by combining the nonlinear shallow water celerity equation with a wave breaker criterion, thereby computing water depths iteratively from the celerity measured from the video data. The water depths estimated at the breaker points present initial bathymetric <b>anchor</b> points. Bathymetric <b>profiles</b> in the surf zone are inverted by calculating wave heights dissipated after wave breaking with a wave dissipation model and wave heights shoaled before wave breaking with a wave shoaling model. The continuous wave amplitude dispersion effects are subtracted from the measured celerity profiles, resulting in nearshore bathymetric profiles. The nonlinear depth inversion derived bathymetric estimates from nearshore imagery match the measured values with a biased mean depth error of about + 0. 06 m in the depth range of 0. 1 to 3 m. In addition, the wave height estimates by the depth inversion model are comparable to the in-situ measured wave heights with a biased mean wave height error of about + 0. 14 m. The present depth inversion method based on optical remote-sensing supports coastal management, navigation, and amphibious operations. Ph. D.
