40|$|In 1935, {{following}} years of drought, economic depression, and massive relief expenditures, {{the federal government}} of Canada passed the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Act (PFR Act) to arrest soil drifting, improve cultivation techniques, and conserve moisture on the Canadian prairies. Activities under the act were to last {{no more than five}} years and cost no more than five million dollars. By 1937, the act was amended to remove unsuitable land from cultivation permanently, and develop federally controlled <b>community</b> <b>pastures.</b> Settlers on unsuitable land were relocated to reduce relief expenditures, and farmers on quality land could balance their operations by grazing livestock on nearby pastures. The first ten years of the <b>community</b> <b>pasture</b> program (1937 - 1947) represented an important stage in the federal interpretation of the prairie region. For decades, Ottawa had administered the prairies with policies that reflected a sense of the region's uniformity and a faith in the power of dry farming techniques. The <b>community</b> <b>pasture</b> program acknowledged the ecological diversity of the prairies and the need for agricultural activities to suit the region's natural limitations. Efforts to develop <b>community</b> <b>pastures</b> were complicated however, by economic, political and social circumstances. By the five-year mark of the program, pasture development was at a virtual standstill. But as federal rehabilitation officials negotiated with prairie governments and private landowners for control of land in <b>community</b> <b>pastures,</b> the region was increasingly understood. In practice, the <b>community</b> <b>pasture</b> program reflected the understanding that broadly-based land use policy had to be flexible in order to accommodate the ecological and social diversity of the prairies...|$|R
40|$|Fecal {{samples were}} {{collected}} systematically in the spring from cows and yearlings entering, and in the fall from calves leaving, five <b>community</b> <b>pastures</b> in central Saskatchewan. Fecal samples were also collected systematically in the spring from cows entering, and in the fall from calves leaving, an experimental rotational grazing system. Samples were collected from 1398 animals and were examined by a quantitative fecal flotation technique with a sensitivity of ten eggs per gram. Distributions of nematode egg counts for 11 of the 12 cattle populations sampled were well described {{by a series of}} negative binomial distributions. A common value of k (a measure of aggregation) could be fitted to the counts from animals of all ages in four of the five <b>community</b> <b>pastures,</b> {{as well as to the}} counts from the cows from the fifth <b>community</b> <b>pasture</b> and from the rotational grazing system. A second value of k could be fitted to the counts from the calves from these two pasture. In addition, in three of the <b>community</b> <b>pastures</b> animals in the different age groups had the same mean count...|$|R

50|$|This {{district}} is atypical in several respects: while most districts in Norway are bounded by geographical barriers such as fjords and mountain ranges, the Dovre region comprises <b>alpine</b> <b>communities</b> that straddle the mountain range of Dovrefjell.

40|$|Thirteen floristic {{communities}} are recognized by numerical {{analysis of the}} vegetation of {{a part of the}} West Coast Range containing the climatic station with the highest mean annual precipitation in temperate Australia, and a variation in altitude from 400 to 1200 m. These communities form an altitude-related sequence with a perceptible break at the transition to alpine vegetation. Within rainforest three intergrading groups also form an altitudinal sequence. However, total environmental stress, as reflected in growth rates, is hypothesized to control this floristic and richness gradient. Direct and indirect gradient analysis reveals a lowland successional sequence from sedgeland to rainforest. Although some <b>alpine</b> <b>communities</b> are clearly the product of firing of others, there is no analogue of the lowland sedgelands. Fire-induced change in both alpine vegetation and rainforest can be extremely long term. Soil drainage is important in the differentiation of both lowland and <b>alpine</b> <b>communities...</b>|$|R

5000|$|The berries are an {{important}} food source subalpine zones, and especially in <b>alpine</b> <b>communities</b> which do not have very many edible plants. Animals that feed on the berries include black bear, birds, mice, and chipmunks, while rabbits and deer eat the foliage. The berries are a favorite among humans, due to their intensely sweet flavor, and can be eaten fresh, dried, or cooked in various dishes. The berries were a staple in the diet of Native Americans in the Columbia Plateau region, who would often travel long distances to harvest the berries. Some tribes even performed prescribed burns to create more favorable habitats for the plant. [...] After naturally occurring and prescribed forest fires in <b>alpine</b> <b>communities,</b> V. deliciousum is oftentimes {{one of the most}} successful surviving plant species. [...] Since the shrub is rhizomatous, it is sometimes possible to transplant and cultivate cuttings for agricultural or landscaping purposes. However, V. deliciosum oftentimes has difficulty growing at elevations below 2000 ft.|$|R
40|$|In India, common {{property}} resourcesinclude <b>community</b> <b>pastures,</b> <b>community</b> forests, wastelands,common dumping and threshing grounds, watershed drainages, village ponds, rivers, rivulets, their {{banks and}} beds. These CPRs {{are among the}} most neglected areas in development planning. To all but the poorest they are almost invisible. Thispaper, by focusing on CPRs in India, documents micro-level evidence on the contribution of CPRs to poor people's livelihoods, their steep declines in area and production over the last 40 years, the collapse of traditional management systems, and the consequent pauperisation of the poor. Inconclusion, the author suggests courses for immediate action to offset some of these alarming trend...|$|R

40|$|Cushion {{plants are}} one of the most common growth forms in alpine habitats. Their low stature, dense canopy, and compact form allow them to {{decouple}} their microclimate from the surrounding environment, mitigating the effect of low temperatures and drought, enhancing the survival of other species. In this study, we evaluated the modifications on soil temperature and moisture over an entire growing season by two cushion species (Laretia acaulis and Azorella monantha) in <b>alpine</b> <b>communities</b> located at two different elevations in the central Chilean Andes. Additionally, we performed seedling survival experiments with two native herbaceous species (Hordeum comosum and Erigeron andicola) and the non-native forb Cerastium arvense to assess if seedling survival is higher within cushions than outside them. Our results indicated that cushions ameliorated extreme low and high substrate temperatures, improved soil moisture, and enhanced seedling survival of the three herbaceous plant species evaluated. Our results suggest that microclimatic modifications associated with cushion plants could be important for the establishment and survival of other plant species, both native and non-native, in the high <b>alpine</b> <b>communities</b> of central Chile...|$|R
