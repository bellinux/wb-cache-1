After doing so, he is granted access to the Colosseum {{at the top of}} the building. There, he is greeted by a large crowd. A Cipher man named Nascour tells Wes that he will have to face four trainers. After Wes defeats all four trainers, Nascour fights him. Once defeated, Nascour tries to leave, only to be {{interrupted}} by Es Cade. Es Cade reveals that he is really none other than Evice, the head of Cipher, and battles Wes. When Wes defeats him, Evice attempts to escape by helicopter, but the legendary Pokémon Ho-Oh swoops in and blasts it out of the sky. Evice and Nascour are presumably arrested.|$|E
25|$|When {{there is}} a talk about women and Buddhism, I have noticed that people often regard the topic as {{something}} new and different. They believe that women in Buddhism has become an important topic because we live in modern times and so many women are practicing the Dharma now. However, {{this is not the}} case. The female sangha has been here for centuries. We are not bringing something new into a 2,500-year-old tradition. The roots <b>are</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> we are simply re-energizing them.|$|E
25|$|A {{few years}} after Miró’s 1918 Barcelona solo exhibition, he settled in Paris where he {{finished}} a number of paintings that he had begun on his parents’ summer home and farm in Mont-roig del Camp. One such painting, The Farm, showed a transition to a more individual style of painting and certain nationalistic qualities. Ernest Hemingway, who later purchased the piece, compared the artistic accomplishment to James Joyce’s Ulysses and described it by saying, “It has in it all that you feel about Spain when you <b>are</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> all that {{you feel when you}} are away and cannot go there. No one else has been able to paint these two very opposing things.” Miró annually returned to Mont-roig and developed a symbolism and nationalism that would stick with him throughout his career. Two of Miró’s first works classified as Surrealist, Catalan Landscape (The Hunter) and The Tilled Field, employ the symbolic language that was to dominate the art of the next decade.|$|E

500|$|The episode's {{title is}} a {{reference}} to Biblical apocrypha, which series creator Chris Carter felt was appropriate to the episode's thematic concerns—hidden documents and truths not brought to light. Director Kim Manners had directed a number of stand alone [...] "monster of the week" [...] episodes, but this was his first mythology-centered episode. Manners explained that [...] "there is some individual creative contribution from the directors" [...] in stand-alone episodes, but that with mythology episodes [...] "what you need to as a director is {{to be sure that}} the performances <b>are</b> <b>there</b> ... <b>and</b> that the yarn is presented in its cleanest and most interesting fashion".|$|E
500|$|Although {{the band}} is of German origin, their music {{is based on the}} American style of death metal. Drummer Lille Gruber explained, [...] "Blues and rock music was {{developed}} in the U.S., that means it all goes back to this country. The roots <b>are</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> I think the best musicians will always be there." [...] When asked about the difference in terms of sound and direction between Psalms of the Moribund and Prelude to the Tragedy, Gruber stated, [...] "We got our own style on Psalms to the Moribund where Prelude to the Tragedy had very obvious hints of the bands we idolized. Psalms of the Moribund splits in two extremes, it went more chunky, brutal, thick and deep, {{but at the same time}} that math-approach and the technicality went up a lot!" ...|$|E
500|$|Chopin's successes as a {{composer}} and performer {{opened the door}} to western Europe for him, and on 2 November 1830, he set out, in the words of Zdzisław Jachimecki, [...] "into the wide world, with no very clearly defined aim, forever." [...] With Woyciechowski, he headed for Austria again, intending to go on to Italy. Later that month, in Warsaw, the November 1830 Uprising broke out, and Woyciechowski returned to Poland to enlist. Chopin, now alone in Vienna, was nostalgic for his homeland, and wrote to a friend, [...] "I curse the moment of my departure." [...] When in September 1831 he learned, while travelling from Vienna to Paris, that the uprising had been crushed, he expressed his anguish in the pages of his private journal: [...] "Oh God!... You <b>are</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> yet you do not take vengeance!" [...] Jachimecki ascribes to these events the composer's maturing [...] "into an inspired national bard who intuited the past, present and future of his native Poland." ...|$|E

500|$|Having {{finished}} the books, Alice finds a magical coin {{on the front}} cover of the sixth book. Called downstairs by her mother, she misses seeing Cornelius and Velvet, both in Pooka form, take the coin and leave a seventh book. In this book, Gwyndolyn is rescued by Oswald, who carries her to the Cauldron before collapsing. Velvet and Cornelius <b>are</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> Velvet finds Titrel on Gwyndolyn's hand. Using Titrel, Velvet turns their psyphers back into phozons to power the Cauldron and revives the land, turning into a Pooka due to Valentine's curse. Oswald and Gwyndolyn {{bear witness to the}} rebirth of the land, and become the ancestors to the new humanity; Mercedes is reincarnated as its World Tree. In a special ending set thousands of years after the events of Odin Sphere, Cornelius and Velvet have successfully gathered all the coins and use their combined power to break their curse. A post-credits scene shows an unseen author, who is writing a book called [...] "Odin Sphere", talking with a merchant while the main characters pass by. A new scene in Leifthrasir shows Ingway's spirit resting within the World Tree's roots, reunited with the reincarnated Mercedes.|$|E

Marshall, on a patrol to locate the King, learns they <b>are</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> quickly rides to the village {{with a group of}} his soldier friends. Hopkins, however, having earlier learned that Sara was in Lavenham, has set a trap to capture Marshall. Hopkins and Stearne frame Marshall and Sara as witches and take them to the castle to be interrogated. Marshall watches as needles are {{repeatedly}} jabbed into Sara's back, but he refuses to confess to witchcraft, instead vowing again to kill Hopkins. He breaks free from his bonds and stamps on Stearne's face, {{at the same time that}} his army comrades approach the castle dungeon. Marshall grabs an axe and repeatedly strikes Hopkins. The soldiers enter the room and are horrified to see what their friend has done. One of them puts the mutilated but still living Hopkins out of his misery by shooting him dead. Marshall's mind snaps and he shouts, [...] "You took him from me! You took him from me!" [...] Sara, also apparently on the brink of insanity, screams uncontrollably over and over again.|$|E

Luke and a man called the General <b>are</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> summon spartoi to hunt the {{official}} quest group, who are currently in the National Air and Space Museum nearby. Percy runs to warn them, but they are attacked by the Nemean Lion before they can leave. They flee, and, {{on the advice of}} Apollo, travel to Cloudcroft, New Mexico. In Cloudcroft, Grover senses the presence of Pan, who sends the Erymanthian Boar to help them escape the spartoi who have caught up with them. The boar carries them as far as Gila Claw, Arizona and the [...] "junkyard of the gods". After a brief encounter with Ares and Aphrodite, the group enters the junkyard, where Bianca tries to take a cursed statuette for Nico. Her theft awakens a prototype of Talos, and she gives her life to bring it down. The remaining quest members travel to the Hoover Dam, and, after narrowly escaping the spartoi again, arrive in San Francisco on the backs of two bronze flying angels.|$|E

500|$|It's {{something}} that's {{very difficult}} for me. Because it is lines on paper when I {{do it in the}} comic book series. It's like, 'Oh, okay, Charlie Adlard [...] doesn’t have to draw that arrangement of lines anymore, that person is dead.' But it's very uncomfortable for me to be on set, because I see these actors that <b>are</b> <b>there</b> <b>and,</b> in the source material, I have killed all but two of them. I walk through the set and I'm like, 'Yep, killed that one, killed that one, killed that one.' And it is firing those people. I feel really bad for Emma Bell, just because she was great and I {{would have liked to have}} had her in the show. But, you know, this is The Walking Dead, characters have got to die. Thankfully, Emma was brought onto the show with the understanding that she was only going to be in a certain number of episodes and she knew that she was going to die from the very beginning. But it doesn’t really make it any easier. When they were shooting those scenes, I had to fly to Comic-Con and so I wasn’t actually there for when she died. But it was very emotional on set and I know that she was very upset about having to leave the crew and the actors. You kind of become a family when you're doing a TV show and it’s a little upsetting to have to get rid of somebody.|$|E

[...] The review concludes [...] "Boardwalk Empire” is at great pains to give viewers a sense that they <b>are</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> yet rarely did I feel engrossed in the show. Even if its point is to show you the ugly side of fun, Boardwalk Empire should be much more fun to watch." ...|$|E

Chinese music itself is built on the same principle and I am planning out the composition called the evolution of music. I hope to show the growth of harmony. First, so many musicians will come out in Indian costume, play some primitive melody. Others will follow playing something more advanced, and so on until the whole band is on stage and we are rendering the best grand opera." ...|$|E
