And I was kind {{of looking at it}} like an outfit. So it was, ‘if this was an outfit, what would this song need now?’ So we had the pretty dress, which was the chorus. We had the lovely shoes, which was the verse. ‘But what do we need to really set this song off? A big, fancy, bow in the hair would really set this song off.’ So when I got to the middle eight I wanted to go really erratic, almost like taTu on <b>All</b> <b>The</b> <b>Things</b> <b>She</b> Said.

[...] "Dance for You" [...] is a midtempo R and synthpop song, in which Beyoncé adopts sensual vocals. The instrumental elements used on it include echoing drum patterns and clapping synthesizers.

500|$|Tenar {{begins to}} {{question}} her beliefs {{when she hears}} Kossil defying the Nameless Ones, and sees {{that they do not}} punish her. She has a conversation with Penthe, her only friend, who expresses an [...] "unfaith" [...] in the divinity of the God-king. Though Tenar reacts to this with shock, the incident opens a new perspective to her. In her own thoughts, [...] "she felt as if she had looked up and suddenly seen a whole new planet hanging huge and populous right outside the window, an entirely strange world, one in which the gods did not matter." [...] Ged acts as a catalyst for this stream of thought, because he is completely alien to her; he is male, brown-skinned, and has a picture of the world is so different from Tenar's own. After speaking to him, she begins to wonder whether the Nameless Ones, despite their power, deserve her worship, and begins to lose faith in them and in <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>she</b> has been taught. She expects to find only evil in Ged, according to what she has been taught; but instead she finds light and love, further challenging her belief.|$|E

500|$|... "Turn Up the Radio" [...] was {{recorded}} at MSR Studios, New York City and Sarm West Studios, Notting Hill, London. It {{was produced by}} both Madonna and Solveig, the latter also working on the synth arrangement, the drums and the instrumentation for the song. Tordjman assisted Solveig on the synth arrangement. Demacio [...] "Demo" [...] Castellon, who represented The Demolition Crew group, was responsible for recording and mixing the track. Philippe Weiss and Graham Archer assisted Castellon on the recording, while Angie Teo assisted on the mixing. Lastly Jason [...] "Metal" [...] Donkersgoed did the additional editing of the song. According to Solveig, [...] "Turn Up the Radio" [...] was his first composition which Madonna approved for the album. On {{the first day of}} recording, the singer prepared <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>she</b> wanted to change in the song and how she wanted to have the final version. She wanted to change the top lines and the melodies from the demo sung by Williams. During recording, Solveig muted the vocals and just played the instrumentals, then Madonna sang the song. The producer added that among all the songs they recorded, [...] "Turn Up the Radio" [...] was the most characteristic of a Madonna track.|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, Hasta la Raíz {{received}} universal acclaim {{from music}} critics. Beverly Bryan of The Village Voice {{stated that the}} album [...] "casts a spell with deep feeling, and melodies and lyrics that linger in the mind. Elegantly adorned with subtle strings and velvety production, it {{has the kind of}} warmth people are always saying they can hear on old vinyl records". Bryan also predicted that this release would be recognized in the future as the singer's [...] "most profound and enduring statement". In another positive review, Natalia Cano of the magazine Rolling Stone Mexico, referred to the album as [...] "fresh and honest pop, a reflection of her musical maturity", reiterating that the album [...] "continues to place her {{as one of the most}} important composer and performer of Latin America." [...] AllMusic's Mariano Prunes gave the album 4.5 out of 5 stars ranking, and on his review stated that [...] "these are extremely well-written songs in the spirit of the great Latin America romantic tradition of which Lara was a founding father, but infused with a contemporary perspective". Luis Romero of the website Coffee and Saturday said that the album is one of the best pop releases of the year, praising Lafourcade's evolution as a musician, but was critical of Lafourcade for not having extended [...] "her comfort zone", since it is too early in her career to become settled in one type of music, [...] "and the proof is that the best album tracks are those where she is helped by Leonel García, Torreblanca and María Daniela". An editor from Televisa Espectáculos wrote a mixed review, commenting that the album has to be listened to twice to [...] "fall in love with at least one song", comparing positively the title track with Lafourcade's work on her previous album (Mujer Divina) and the songs [...] "Mi Lugar Favorito" [...] and [...] "Te Quiero Ver" [...] with her album Hu Hu Hu, creating a [...] "mix of sounds" [...] on which Lafourcade shows <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>she</b> learned after working with Agustín Lara's catalog. Lissette Corsa, of MTVIggy, stated that [...] "despite moments of darkness and heartfelt sadness, Hasta la Raiz bristles with a sense of adventure and optimism", and noted the influence of Chilean songwriter Violeta Parra in the track [...] "Vámonos Negrito", as part of Lafourcade's [...] "eclectic artistry". Corsa also noted that the singer [...] "drew from Joni Mitchell, Charles Bradley, and Amy Winehouse".|$|E

60|$|After my lady, {{as it was}} my duty to call her, {{was thrown}} into jail for a debt {{she was unable to}} pay, she gave her mind wholly up to devotion. Whether it was from a {{thorough}} sense of her wretched state, or any other reason, I could never learn; but this I may say, that she was a sincere penitent, and in every action had all the behaviour of a Christian. By degrees <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>she</b> had in the world were sold, and she began to find an inward decay upon her spirits. In this interval she repeated all the passages of her ill-spent life to me, and thoroughly repented of every bad action, especially the little value she had for her children, which were honestly born and bred. And having, as she believed, made her peace with God, she died with mere grief on the 2nd of July 1742, in the sixty-fifth year of her age, and was decently buried by me in the churchyard belonging to the Lutherans, in the city of Amsterdam.|$|E
6000|$|So it {{had come}} to pass, in her {{distended}} and demoralised conscience, that with <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>she</b> despised in her life and <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>she</b> rather liked, between being worn out with her husband's inability to earn a living and a kind of terror of his consistency (he had a theory that they lived delightfully), it happened, I say, that the only very definite criticism she made of him to-day was that he didn't know how to speak. That was where the shoe pinched--that was where Selah was slim. He couldn't hold the attention of an audience, he was not acceptable as a lecturer. He had plenty of thoughts, but it seemed as if he couldn't fit them into each other. Public speaking had been a Greenstreet tradition, and if Mrs. Tarrant had been asked whether in her younger years she had ever supposed she should marry a mesmeric healer, she would have replied: [...] "Well, I never thought I should marry a gentleman who would be silent on the platform!" [...] This was her most general humiliation; it included and exceeded every other, and it was a poor consolation that Selah possessed as a substitute--his career as a healer, to speak of none other, was there to prove it--the eloquence of the hand. The Greenstreets had never set much store on manual activity; they believed in the influence of the lips. It may be imagined, therefore, with what exultation, as time went on, Mrs. Tarrant found herself the mother of an inspired maiden, a young lady from whose lips eloquence flowed in streams. The Greenstreet tradition would not perish, and the dry places of her life would, perhaps, be plentifully watered. It must be added that, of late, this sandy surface had been irrigated, in moderation, from another source. Since Selah had addicted himself to the mesmeric mystery, their home had been a little more what the home of a Greenstreet should be. He had [...] "considerable many" [...] patients, he got about two dollars a sitting, and he had effected some most gratifying cures. A lady in Cambridge had been so much indebted to him that she had recently persuaded them to take a house near her, in order that Doctor Tarrant might drop in at any time. He availed himself of this convenience--they had taken so many houses that another, more or less, didn't matter--and Mrs. Tarrant began to feel as if they really had [...] "struck" [...] something.|$|E
