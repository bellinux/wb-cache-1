5|$|Governments {{such as the}} Netherlands and New Zealand {{have responded}} to the public's {{concerns}} by outlawing invasive experiments on certain classes of non-human primates, particularly the great apes. In 2015, captive chimpanzees in the U.S. were added to the Endangered Species Act adding new road blocks to those wishing to experiment on them. Similarly, citing ethical considerations <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> alternative research methods, the U.S. NIH announced in 2013 that it would dramatically reduce and eventually phase out experiments on chimpanzees.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1930s, {{aviation}} design teams worldwide started {{developing a}} new generation of all-metal, low-wing fighter aircraft. The French Dewoitine D.520 and Germany's Messerschmitt Bf 109, for example, were designed to take advantage of new techniques of monocoque construction <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> new high-powered, liquid-cooled, in-line aero engines. They also featured refinements such as retractable undercarriages, fully enclosed cockpits, low drag and all-metal wings (all introduced on civil airliners years before but slow to be adopted by the military, who favoured the biplane's simplicity and manoeuvrability).|$|E

5|$|The Classic was an {{adaptation}} of Jerry Manock's and Terry Oyama's 1984 Macintosh 128K industrial design, as had been the earlier Macintosh SE. Apple released two versions that ranged in price from $1,000 to $1,500. The price <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> education software led to the Classic's popularity in education. It was sold alongside the more powerful Macintosh Classic II in 1991 until its discontinuation the next year.|$|E
5|$|The Poor Law system {{fell into}} decline at the {{beginning}} of the 20th century owing to factors such as the introduction of the Liberal welfare reforms <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> other sources of assistance from friendly societies and trade unions, as well as piecemeal reforms which bypassed the Poor Law system. The Poor Law system was not formally abolished until the National Assistance Act 1948, with parts of the law remaining on the books until 1967.|$|E

5|$|An area {{in which}} the island {{operates}} as a single market is electricity. For much of their existence electricity networks in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland were entirely separate. Both networks were designed and constructed independently post partition. However, as a result of changes over recent years they are now connected with three interlinks and also connected through Great Britain to mainland Europe. The situation in Northern Ireland is complicated by the issue of private companies not supplying Northern Ireland Electricity (NIE) with enough power. In the Republic of Ireland, the ESB has failed to modernise its power stations <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> power plants has recently averaged only 66%, one of the worst such rates in Western Europe. EirGrid is building a HVDC transmission line between Ireland and Great Britain with a capacity of 500 MW, about 10% of Ireland's peak demand.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the arrival}} of Europeans in the area, {{wildebeest}} used to roam widely, probably in relation to {{the arrival of}} the rains <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> good forage. They never made such extensive migrations as the blue wildebeest but at one time, they used to cross the Drakensberg Range, moving eastwards in autumn, searching for good pastures. Then they returned to the highvelds in the spring and moved towards the west, where sweet potato and Karoo vegetation were abundant. They also moved from north to south as the sourgrass found north of the Vaal River matured and became unpalatable, the wildebeest only consuming young shoots of sourgrass. Nowadays, almost all black wildebeest are in reserves or on farms and the extent of their movements is limited.|$|E
5|$|Decompression {{theory is}} not an exact science. Decompression models {{approximate}} a physiological process that is incompletely understood, and rather complex, by simple mathematical models, {{in the hope of}} producing a useful procedure with acceptably low risk of injury to the user. New information allows theories and models to be modified to provide more reliable results, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> faster and more powerful computer processors at low cost has made more exhaustive numerical methods more practicable, and the computation of relatively far more complex models is now quite possible, even in real time.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{richness}} of high-quality habitats in Yosemite, the brown bear, California condor, and least Bell's vireo have become extinct in the park within historical time, and another 37 species currently have special status under either California or federal endangered species legislation. The most serious current threats to Yosemite's wildlife and the ecosystems they occupy include loss of a natural fire regime, exotic species, air pollution, habitat fragmentation, and climate change. On a more local basis, factors such as road kills <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> human food have affected some wildlife species.|$|E
5|$|Drug {{resistance}} poses {{a growing}} problem in 21st-century malaria treatment. Resistance is now common against all classes of antimalarial drugs apart from artemisinins. Treatment of resistant strains became increasingly dependent on this class of drugs. The cost of artemisinins limits their use in the developing world. Malaria strains found on the Cambodia–Thailand border are resistant to combination therapies that include artemisinins, and may, therefore, be untreatable. Exposure of the parasite population to artemisinin monotherapies in subtherapeutic doses for over 30 years <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> substandard artemisinins likely drove {{the selection of the}} resistant phenotype. Resistance to artemisinin has been detected in Cambodia, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam, and there has been emerging resistance in Laos.|$|E
5|$|In 2001 {{the total}} {{workforce}} in {{national and state}} governments and the quasi-government sector was 620,000, {{and the private sector}} employed 219,000. Key service industries are information technology, telecommunications, hotels, banking, media and tourism. Construction, power, health and community services and real estate are also important to the city's economy. Delhi has one of India's largest and fastest growing retail industries. Manufacturing also grew considerably as consumer goods companies established manufacturing units and headquarters in the city. Delhi's large consumer market <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> skilled labour has also attracted foreign investment. In 2001, the manufacturing sector employed 1,440,000 workers and the city had 129,000 industrial units.|$|E

5|$|In each level, {{the player}} must {{complete}} certain objectives and then exit the stage. The requirements are varied, with many levels requiring the recovery {{and use of}} numerous high-tech gadgets. If Joanna is killed or fails an objective, the player must start the level again. Three distinct difficulty settings are available for each level, the choice of which will affect aspects such {{as the number of}} objectives that must be completed, enemy accuracy and damage, the effectiveness of the game's optional aiming assistance, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> ammunition and protective shields. If all the levels are completed on the highest difficulty, an additional setting becomes available, allowing players to customise various aspects of enemies, such as their health, their aiming accuracy and the damage they inflict. In addition to the main campaign, there are four bonus missions, with three enabling the player to control other characters with unique special abilities. Players can also unlock cheats by completing the levels within certain time limits.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{ambulances}} {{are typically}} powered by internal combustion engines, {{which can be}} powered by any conventional fuel, including diesel, gasoline or liquefied petroleum gas, depending on the preference of the operator <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> different options. Colder regions often use gasoline-powered engines, as diesels {{can be difficult to}} start when they are cold. Warmer regions may favor diesel engines, as they are thought to be more efficient and more durable. Diesel power is sometimes chosen due to safety concerns, after a series of fires involving gasoline-powered ambulances during the 1980s. These fires were ultimately attributed in part to gasoline's higher volatility in comparison to diesel fuel. The type of engine may be determined by the manufacturer: in the past two decades, Ford would only sell vehicles for ambulance conversion if they are diesel-powered. Beginning in 2010, Ford will sell its ambulance chassis with a gasoline engine in order to meet emissions requirements.|$|E
5|$|More people {{joined the}} middle class in the 1950s, with more money to spend, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> {{consumer}} goods expanded along with the economy, including the automobile. Americans were spending more time in their automobiles and viewing them {{as an extension of}} their identity, which helped to fuel a boom in automobile sales. Most businesses directly or indirectly related to the auto industry saw tremendous growth during the decade. New designs and innovations appealed to a generation tuned into fashion and glamour, and the new-found freedom and way of life in the suburbs had several unforeseen consequences for the inner cities. The 1950s saw the beginning of white flight and urban sprawl, driven by increasing automobile ownership. Many local and national transportation laws encouraged suburbanization, which in time ended up damaging the cities economically.|$|E

A few species are defying the trend and showing local increases, including the Arctic tern in Scandinavia, Forster's tern around the Great Lakes, the Sandwich tern in eastern North America and its yellow-billed subspecies, the Cayenne tern, in the Caribbean.|$|E
5|$|No. 77 Wing's three {{dive bomber}} squadrons {{returned}} to Australia during March 1944 to be re-equipped with Consolidated B-24 Liberator heavy bombers. The RAAF had previously intended to establish new squadrons {{to introduce the}} Liberator into service, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> the Vengeance-equipped units simplified this process. All of the squadrons' dive bombers departed Nadzab on 13 March, and their ground crews followed soon afterwards. No. 21 Squadron was transferred to Camden, New South Wales, No. 23 Squadron to Higgins Field in Cape York where it operated as an army-cooperation unit as part of No. 75 Wing, and No. 24 Squadron to Lowood. Al three units ceased flying Vengeances shortly afterwards. No. 4 OTU was also disbanded on 30 April 1944. No. 12 Squadron remained at Merauke until July 1944, when it was withdrawn to Strathpine, Queensland, and handed in its Vengeances ahead of also receiving Liberators.|$|E
