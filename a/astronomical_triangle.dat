50|$|Burt's {{instrument}} {{was used to}} take azimuths, altitude, time and declination with one observation when properly manipulated. There were two principal rings. The inner latitude ring could rotate 90 degrees inside the outer meridian ring. An azimuth ring {{was attached to the}} meridian ring. A ship's bearing was determined by settings of the <b>astronomical</b> <b>triangle</b> consisting of declination, latitude, altitude, hour angle, and azimuth. Three of these were used. The main purpose of Burt's new {{instrument was}} to determine the variation of the needle in the magnetic compass for a more accurate reading of a ship's position at sea.|$|E

[...] In astronomy, the spherical triangle formed by the zenith, the celestial north pole and the Sun is called the <b>astronomical</b> <b>triangle.</b> Its sides and two of its angles are important astronomical quantities. The sides are 90° - φ where φ is the observer's terrestrial latitude, 90° - δ where δ is the Sun's declination and 90° - a [...] where a is the Sun's altitude above the horizon. The important angles are the angle at the zenith which is the Sun's azimuth and the angle at the north pole which is the Sun's hour angle. The problem is to compute two of these elements when the other three elements are specified. There are precisely ten different possibilities and Tantrasamgraha contains discussions of all these possibilities with complete solutions one by one in one place. [...] "The spherical triangle is handled as systematically here as in any modern textbook." ...|$|E
