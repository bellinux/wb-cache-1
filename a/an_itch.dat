25|$|Bodine's racing career {{seemed to}} be on track right from the start as his father and grandfather, Eli Bodine Jr. and Sr. built Chemung Speedrome just a year after he was born. He began {{learning}} his racing skills at this track in the micro-midget division when he was only five years old. He had such <b>an</b> <b>itch</b> to race that he disguised himself as a lady and entered a Powderpuff Division Race when he was 15. In 2011, he drove for Tommy Baldwin Racing in the Sprint Cup Series, alternating between the Nos. 35 and 36 teams, with sponsorship from Luke & Associates.|$|E
25|$|Referred itch is the {{phenomenon}} {{in which a}} stimulus applied in one region {{of the body is}} felt as <b>an</b> <b>itch</b> or irritation in {{a different part of the}} body. The syndrome is relatively harmless, though it can be irritating, and healthy individuals can express symptoms. Stimuli range from a firm pressure applied to the skin – a scratch – to irritation or pulling on a hair follicle on the skin. The referred sensation itself should not be painful; it is more of an irritating prickle leading to the compulsion to scratch the area. The stimulus and referred itch are ipsilateral (the stimulus and the referred itch occur on the same side of the body). Also, because scratching or putting pressure on the referred itch does not cause the stimulus area to itch, the relationship between the stimulus and the referred itch is unidirectional. The itching sensation is spontaneous and can cease with continued stimulation.|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to the abnormal movements of other movement disorders (for example, choreas, dystonias, myoclonus, and dyskinesias), the tics of Tourette's are temporarily suppressible, nonrhythmic, and often preceded by an unwanted premonitory urge. Immediately preceding tic onset, most individuals with Tourette's are aware of an urge, similar {{to the need to}} sneeze or scratch <b>an</b> <b>itch.</b> Individuals describe the need to tic as a buildup of tension, pressure, or energy which they consciously choose to release, as if they [...] "had to do it" [...] to relieve the sensation or until it feels [...] "just right". Examples of the premonitory urge are the feeling of having something in one's throat, or a localized discomfort in the shoulders, leading to the need to clear one's throat or shrug the shoulders. The actual tic may be felt as relieving this tension or sensation, similar to scratching <b>an</b> <b>itch.</b> Another example is blinking to relieve an uncomfortable sensation in the eye. These urges and sensations, preceding the expression of the movement or vocalization as a tic, are referred to as [...] "premonitory sensory phenomena" [...] or premonitory urges. Because of the urges that precede them, tics are described as semi-voluntary or [...] "unvoluntary", rather than specifically involuntary; they may be experienced as a voluntary, suppressible response to the unwanted premonitory urge. Published descriptions of the tics of Tourette's identify sensory phenomena as the core symptom of the syndrome, even though they are not included in the diagnostic criteria.|$|E

500|$|The game's {{story and}} {{characters}} also received praise. Snider {{said that the}} story {{is driven by the}} characters, and that the choices presented in the game were difficult, making him regret some choices for weeks after completing the game. He added that the game's main quest was well written, and its quality boosted by excellent voice acting; he called the performance of Claudia Black as Morrigan {{one of the best in}} the game. VanOrd commended the game's story, saying that it was memorable and crafted with care, successfully making players care about the game's world and characters. He added that the deep character development made every choice [...] "momentous". GamesRadar thought that the story and the Warden's appearance felt generic, but that the story become more and more engrossing as it progressed. Nick Tan from Game Revolution liked the banter between companions as a humorous change of pace within the game. Gerald Villoria from GameSpy praised the exclusion of the moral system for making the characters feel more complex. Juba wrote that the story was good but predictable, not straying far from standard fantasy stories. Wesley Yin-Poole from VideoGamer.com called the story memorable, saying that it [...] "leaves <b>an</b> <b>itch</b> in your mind", and has attracted players to return to the game [...] "like an addict seeking a hit of relief." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>An</b> <b>itch,</b> {{also known}} as pruritus, is {{classified}} as a sensory stimulation to scratch a certain area of the skin. [...] <b>An</b> <b>itch</b> can be a fleeting sensation, as with a random tickle or prick, or persistent, as with a rash such as eczema or other skin irritant such as an allergen. Itch has been demonstrated to be closely related to pain and to share many of its physiological mechanisms. The relationship between pain and itch {{is evident in the}} fact that itch sensations occur along a similar neurological and sensory pathway as sensations of pain, and the fact that individuals who are insensitive to pain are also insensitive to itch.|$|E
2500|$|Referred itch is {{the class}} of {{referred}} sensation {{that focuses on the}} situation in which <b>an</b> <b>itch</b> in one place on the body simultaneously triggers <b>an</b> <b>itch</b> in a different location. [...] Other examples of referred sensation include sensations of temperature, pain, and pressure. Referred itch is commonly observed in completely healthy individuals and can often go unnoticed depending upon the particular person’s self-awareness of their itches and the causes of those itches. The ephemeral nature of referred itch and its restriction to a very small area on one’s body (the itch is precisely located, it does not induce widespread itching) make it difficult to document or even notice.|$|E

2500|$|Immediately {{preceding}} tic onset, {{most individuals}} {{are aware of}} an urge {{that is similar to}} the need to yawn, sneeze, blink, or scratch <b>an</b> <b>itch.</b> Individuals describe the need to tic as a buildup of tension that they consciously choose to release, as if they [...] "had to do it". [...] Examples of this premonitory urge are the feeling of having something in one's throat or a localized discomfort in the shoulders, leading to the need to clear one's throat or shrug the shoulders. The actual tic may be felt as relieving this tension or sensation, similar to scratching <b>an</b> <b>itch.</b> Another example is blinking to relieve an uncomfortable sensation in the eye. Some people with tics may not be aware of the premonitory urge. Children may be less aware of the premonitory urge associated with tics than are adults, but their awareness tends to increase with maturity.|$|E
2500|$|The {{location}} of the reference point for each individual that experiences referred itch is well conserved and specific to each person, in that a certain location will elicit the phenomenon repeatedly for a given person while itches elsewhere may not. [...] However, frequent and repetitive stimulation of the same original itch location can weaken the phenomenon, making the referred itch increasingly more discrete with each repeated trial. [...] There is also {{no evidence of a}} relationship between the site of the original stimulus and that of the referred itch. [...] Though the {{location of}} the referred itch may remain fairly constant and precise for a particular stimulus location on a single individual, there is no substantial evidence linking any two locations in a definite origin/referred location relationship. [...] Thus, referral patterns are extremely variable and offer little to no indication of where a referred itch will occur if the {{location of the}} original itch is known. [...] It {{should also be noted that}} the phenomenon is unidirectional. [...] Consequently, scratching <b>an</b> <b>itch</b> in a location that has previously served as the point of a referred itch does not induce <b>an</b> <b>itch</b> in the person’s typical origination site.|$|E
