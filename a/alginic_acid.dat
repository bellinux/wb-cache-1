Quantitative content of polysaccharides, <b>alginic</b> <b>acids,</b> reducing sugars, pentosans, iodine, cellulose, mannitol, proteins, lipids, agar was determined. In comparison with Fucus and Ahnfeltia higher concentration of the following content was noted in Laminaria: <b>alginic</b> <b>acids</b> (1. 4 and 5. 75 times higher), polysaccharides (1. 3 and 1. 4 times), iodine (4. 5 and 1. 8 times), mannatol (1. 5 and 2. 5 times) (data received is statistically reliable). Impropriety of storm algae for processing was shown as law quality raw material. The highest concentration of active substances was revealed in Laminaria thalluses which were procured at the depth of 10 m in a period from September to October. Active accumulation of sodium, potassium, calcium, iron, magnesium, manganese corresponding to similar sea water composition was established in algae. Mathematical equations of regression between protein and manganese, protein and iron content in algae were deduced. Under proper conditions of drying and storage high quality of the materials can be preserved during 3 years. Based on the findings of photochemical researches, taking into account squares of plantations and possible exploitation stocks, the possibility and prospectivity of industrial processing of Fucus vesiculosus and Ahnfeltia plicata together with Laminaria saccharina as plant sources of polysaccharides (mainly alginates) was proved. </p...|$|R

Most of the fouling is reversible (80 %). Organics are barely (15 % of humic acids) retained by the membrane.

Two <b>alginic</b> <b>acids</b> (polymer and dimmer, AA), abietic acid (AbA), colominic acid (CA), and N-acetylneuraminic acid (NA) were selected as MOCs to test their membrane fouling potential through flux decline and SP.

CA also caused external fouling of the two membranes; however, AbA caused internal (solute adsorption on the pores wall of membrane) and irreversible fouling of the PES membrane. NA, which contained amino sugars, exhibited very low fouling of both membranes. The hydrophilic YM 100 membrane experienced less fouling than the hydrophobic PES membrane with all MOCs.

An improved fit between experimental observations and the model predictions of adsorbed plus internalised Pb in the presence of DOM of different compositions was observed by assuming that each individual component adsorbed by the algae gave access to additional binding sites for Pb.

Complex formation of organotin(IV) moieties with {{a great number of}} inorganic and organic ligands in aqueous solution is reviewed here in the light of their environmental and biological impact. To this end, complex species formation was considered in different ionic media and at different ionic strengths, with reference to the composition of natural waters and biological fluids. In particular, the interaction of alkyltin(IV) compounds with the following ligands was taken into account: hydroxo, chloride, sulfate, fluoride, carbonate and phosphate; carboxylates, amines, amino-carboxylates, nucleotides, saccharides, S-containing ligands and antibiotics. Moreover, the interaction of organotin(IV) cations with synthetic (polyacrylate) and natural occurring (fulvic and <b>alginic</b> <b>acids)</b> polyelectrolytes was also considered.

With its 70 % of the surface of our planet marine ecosystem still remains largely unexplored, understudied and underexploited in comparison with terrestrial ecosystems, organisms and bioprocesses. The biological adaptation of marine organisms {{to a wide range}} of environmental conditions in the specific environment (temperature, salinity, tides, pressure, radiation, light, etc.) has made them an enormous reservoir of interesting biological material for both basic research and biotechnological improvements. As a consequence marine ecosystem is valued as a source of enzymes and other biomolecules exhibiting new functions and activities to fulfill human needs. Indeed, in recent years it has been recognised as an untapped source of novel enzymes and metabolites even though, with regard to the assignment of precise biological functions to genes, proteins and enzymes, it is still considered as the least developed. Using metagenomics to recover genetic material directly from environmental samples, this biogenetic diversification can be accessed but despite the contributions from metagenomic technologies the new field requires major improvements. A few words on the complexity of marine environments should be added here. This complexity ranges from symbiotic relationships to biology and chemistry of defence mechanisms and from chemoecology of marine invasions up to the strategies found in prokaryotes to adapt to extreme environments. The interdisciplinary study of this complexity will enable researchers to find an arsenal of enzymes and pathways greatly demanded in biotechnological applications. As far as marine enzymes are concerned they may carry novel chemical and stereochemical properties, thus biocatalytically oriented studies (testing of suitable substrates, appropriate checking of reaction conditions, study of stereochemical asset of catalysis) should be performed to appropriately reveal this “chemical biodiversity” which increases interest for these enzymes. Among other biomolecules, polysaccharides are the most abundant renewable biomaterial found on land and in oceans. Their molecular diversity is very interesting; except polysaccharides used traditionally in food and non-food industries, the structure and the functionality of most of them are unknown and unexplored. Brown seaweeds synthesize unique bioactive polysaccharides: laminarans, <b>alginic</b> <b>acids</b> and fucoidans. A wide range of biological activities (anticoagulant, antitumor, antiviral, anti-inflammation, etc.) have been attributed to fucoidans and their role with respect to structure-activity relationship is still under debate.

40|$|Bio{{polymers}} are polymers {{produced by}} living organisms. A more broad classification would embrace also those polymers synthesized from renewable sources which {{are able to}} display biodegradability. The demand of biopolymers has been continuously growing along these last decades. The main reason for such increasing interest is their sustainability; the renewable origin of biopolymers makes them inexhaustible in contrast with synthetic polymers produced from finite fossil sources. Biodegradability is a second advantage; due to the presence {{in the nature of}} enzymes able to degrade biopolymers under environmental conditions to give non-toxic products, their impact on the environment is basically trivial. Finally, the use of more or less modified biopolymers as biomaterials, owing to their unique properties of biocompatibility and biodegradability, has aroused their interest in several disciplines. As a result of all these considerations, great efforts in biopolymers research including chemical modification, characterization and property evaluation are today being carried out to develop new materials able to replace traditional plastics in a wide diversity of applications. In the present Thesis, a selection of carboxylic biopolymers has been studied for their capacity to form stable ionic complexes with cationic surfactants suitable to render new materials with advanced properties. Previous studies on polyelectrolytesurfactant complexes carried out in our group have demonstrated that these coupled systems tend to be self-assembled in well-ordered structures that can be exploited for building films and particles with singular properties as biomaterials. The main goal of this Thesis is the study of polyelectrolyte-ionic complexes based on naturally occurring polyacids and cationic surfactants. One part of the work delves into the complexes of poly(g-glutamic acid), a system that has been object of continuous research in our group from 90 s. The aim is to progress in the development by making them "greener" through coupling with bio-based surfactants, and by improving their basic properties through blending with nanoclays. The other part is dedicated to explore the ionic complexes made from poly(uronic acid) s and cationic surfactants. This {{is the first time that}} such complexes are examined and their structural features and properties compared to those displayed by complexes based on poly(glutamic acid). Experimentally, the Thesis embodies a multidisciplinary task work including preparation, structural characterization and evaluation of thermal properties of a series of ionic complexes, as well as a preliminary valuation of the suitability of some of them to be used as drug delivery systems. Hence, the specific objectives in this Thesis are enumerated as follows: 1. Synthesis and chemical characterization of ionic complexes of poly(uronic <b>acid)</b> s (pectinic, <b>alginic</b> and hyaluronic <b>acids),</b> with trimethylalkylammonium surfactants of n= 18, 20 and 22. Structural and thermal analysis of these complexes and critical comparison of results with those available for complexes made of poly(glutamic acid). 2. Synthesis and characterization of choline-based surfactants for the preparation of fully bio-based polyglutamic complexes as an alternative to complexes based on trimethylalkylammonium surfactants in their potential use as biomaterials. Structural and thermal analysis of these complexes and their preliminary evaluation as nano-particulated drug delivery systems. 3. Preparation of composites of poly(glutamic acid) -cationic surfactant complexes with organo-modified nanoclays, their extensive structural characterization and the evaluation of their thermal and mechanical properties compared to those displayed by the neat complexes. The Thesis is organized in five Chapters. After a very brief summary of the whole work with explicit definition of the objectives, Chapter I is an introduction to the subject, in which an extensively referenced account of the main hints previously achieved in the field is provided and the state-of-art is described. The following three Chapters correspond to the three specific objectives enumerated above. Chapter II gathers the synthesis, characterization and properties evaluation study carried out on ionic complexes of poly(uronic acid) s. Chapter III is focused on the study of ionic complexes of polyglutamic and alkanoylcholines, the synthesis and characterization of the surfactants, the preparation of their complexes with poly(glutamic acid) and their possibilities as potential biomaterials. Chapter IV covers the preparation of the composites made of Cloisite 30 B and poly(glutamic acid) complexes along with a detailed study of their structure by X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy and modeling, and a correlative analysis of their structure with their thermal and mechanical properties.
