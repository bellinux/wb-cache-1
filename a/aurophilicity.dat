[...] In accordance with theoretical calculations, which predict a local maximum for relevant relativistic effects for gold atoms, none of these other interactions are as strong as <b>aurophilicity.</b> Although metallophilic interactions are not inherently relativistic in their nature, they are complemented by it.|$|E
5000|$|The {{similarity}} in strength between hydrogen bonding and aurophilic interaction {{has proven to}} be a convenient tool in the field of polymer chemistry. Much research has been conducted on self-assembling supermolecular structures, both those that aggregate by <b>aurophilicity</b> alone and those that contain both aurophilic and hydrogen-bonding interactions. [...] An important and exploitable property of aurophilic interactions relevant to their supermolecular chemistry is that while both inter- and intramolecular interactions are possible, intermolecular aurophilic linkages are comparatively weak and easily broken by solvation; most complexes that exhibit intramolecular aurophilic interactions retain such moieties in solution.|$|E
50|$|The main {{evidence}} for <b>aurophilicity</b> {{is from the}} crystallographic analysis of Au(I) complexes. The aurophilic bond is assigned a length of about 3.0 Å and a strength of about 7-12 kcal/mol, which {{is comparable to the}} strength of a hydrogen bond. The aurophilic interaction is thought to result from electron correlation of the closed-shell components, which is unusual because closed-shell atoms generally have negligible interaction with one another at distances on the scale of the Au-Au bond. This is somewhat similar to van der Waals interactions, but is unusually strong due to relativistic effects. Observations and theory show that, on average, 28% of the binding energy in aurophilic interaction can be attributed to relativistic expansion of the gold d orbitals.|$|E

First, a brief historic account of <b>aurophilicity</b> in organogold chemistry is given, focusing on the pioneering results which {{set the stage for}} its association with catalytic intermediates (gold vinyl and gold aryl complexes); this is followed by an introduction to cationic gold(I) as an electrophilic catalyst, and the first isolation of organogold intermediates from catalysis. In the main section, the growing number of reports observing aurophilic interactions in catalysis or illustrative model systems is reviewed in a non-comprehensive tutorial way. The effects of <b>aurophilicity</b> are discussed in the following structures: (1) the geminal diauration of C(sp 2) -atoms; (2) geminal diauration of other atoms; (3) σ-π-diauration of terminal alkynes. It is apparent that in most cases efficient catalysis is hindered by aurophilic effects as less active aggregates tend to be formed from more active species [LAu] +, but there are a growing number of reports using <b>aurophilicity</b> as a driving force to access new reactivity and selectivity...|$|E

40|$|Spectroscopic and quantum {{mechanical}} {{studies of}} the Et(3) PAuCl complex were performed to characterize the effect of <b>aurophilicity</b> on the optical properties. When excited with UV light at low temperature, the crystalline complex produced a deep luminescence in both the blue (high-energy) and red (low-energy) regions of the spectrum. The intensity of the low-energy luminescence was markedly reduced in the powdered state and quenched in the solution state. Time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations on electronic structures of both the ground and excited states of aggregates [Et(3) PAuCl](n) (n = 1 - 3) indicated that the low-energy luminescence was attributable to Au-centered transitions, which are significantly affected by aurophilic interactions.

40|$|Abstract: We {{review the}} crystal structures, {{electrospray}} ionization mass spectra (ESI-MS) data and chiral HPLC {{data for the}} racemic and optically pure mononuclear AuL 2 complexes, and for racemic [AuLI]n and optically pure [AgLII]n polymers (LI thiomalate, LII 13 -penicillamine). We postulate an equilibrium between polymeric, mononuclear and free ligand species for [AuLII]n (gold sodium thiomalate or GST). The ESI-MS results clearly show a tetrameric principal species in the 1 : 1 gold polymers, [AuLI]n. For the 1 : 1 silver: 13 penicillamine complex, [AgLII]n, a non-molecular crystal of double helical structure, the ESI-MS results show multi-ligand-silver species, including tetramers, pentamers and hexamers.

40|$|The redox capacity, {{as well as}} the <b>aurophilicity</b> of the {{terminal}} thiol side groups, in poly(Cysteine) lend a unique characteristic to this poly(amino acid) or polypeptide. There are two major application fields for this polymer: (i) biomedical applications in drug delivery and surface modification of biomedical devices and (ii) as coating for electrodes to enhance their electrochemical sensitivity. The intended application determines the synthetic route for p(Cysteine). Polymers to be used in biomedical applications are typically polymerized from the cysteine N-carboxyanhydride by a ring-opening polymerization, where the thiol group needs to be protected during the polymerization. Advances in this methodology have led to conditions under which the polymerization progresses as living polymerization, which allows for a strict control of the molecular architecture, molecular weight and polydispersity and the formation of block copolymers, which eventually could display polyphilic properties. Poly(Cysteine) used as electrode coating is typically polymerized onto the electrode by cyclic voltammetry, which actually produces a continuous, pinhole-free film on the electrode via the formation of covalent bonds between the amino group of Cysteine and the carbon of the electrode. This resulting coating is chemically very different from the well-defined poly(Cysteine) obtained by ring-opening polymerizations. Based on the structure of cysteine a significant degree of cross-linking within the coating deposited by cyclic voltammetry can be assumed. This manuscript provides a detailed discussion of the ring-opening polymerization of cysteine, a brief consideration of the role of glutathione, a key cysteine-containing tripeptide, and examples for the utilization of poly(Cysteine) and poly(Cysteine) -containing copolymers, in both, the biomedical as well as electrochemical realm...|$|E
40|$|Trabajo presentado a la XXXV Reunión Bienal de la Real Sociedad Española de Química celebrada en A Coruña del 19 al 23 de julio de 2015. Recent {{interest}} in luminescent metal complexes {{has been driven}} by possible applications in OLED display technology as dopant emitters, in solar photoconversion chemistry as chromophores, and in sensor development for luminescence detection. Potentially attractive in this regard are gold(I) complexes that, in many cases, possess intense, long-lived luminescence in the solid state or in solution with emission energies spanning the visible spectrum. Part of the fascination of gold(I) chemistry is due to the frequent formation of inter- and intra-molecular gold-gold interactions (<b>aurophilicity)</b> and the tendency to adopt linear coordination. Two common strategies in the synthesis of gold(I) compounds consist in the use of a) reactions between gold complexes with the gold center as acid and some basic ligands, or b) reactions in which the gold center can be the base and can interact with acid complexes. The required conditions for a gold complex to show luminescence depend {{of the nature of the}} ligands, the geometry around the gold center or the presence of gold-gold interactions in the complexes. Nevertheless, the conjunction of more than one of these conditions makes the assignment more complicated. In addition, the presence of new metal centers can modify the relative energy of the frontier orbitals of gold and create new orbitals, as a consequence of the gold–metal interaction. We will see some examples of three-coordinate complexes, with gold-gold or gold-thallium interactions, with charge-transfer or intraligand transitions. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|There {{is intense}} {{activity}} {{in the area of}} theoretical chemistry of gold. It is now possible to predict new molecular species, and more recently, solids by combining relativistic methodology with isoelectronic thinking. In this thesis we predict a series of solid sheet-type crystals for Group- 11 cyanides, MCN (M=Cu, Ag, Au), and Group- 2 and 12 carbides MC 2 (M=Be-Ba, Zn-Hg). The idea of sheets is then extended to nanostrips which can be bent to nanorings. The bending energies and deformation frequencies can be systematized by treating these molecules as an elastic bodies. In these species Au atoms act as an 'intermolecular glue'. Further suggested molecular species are the new uncongested aurocarbons, and the neutral Au_nHg_m clusters. Many of the suggested species are expected to be stabilized by aurophilic interactions. We also estimate the MP 2 basis-set limit of the <b>aurophilicity</b> for the model compounds [ClAuPH_ 3]_ 2 and [P(AuPH_ 3) _ 4]^+. Beside investigating the size of the basis-set applied, our research confirms that the 19 -VE TZVP+ 2 f level, used a decade ago, already produced 74 % of the present aurophilic attraction energy for the [ClAuPH_ 3]_ 2 dimer. Likewise we verify the preferred C 4 v structure for the [P(AuPH_ 3) _ 4]^+ cation at the MP 2 level. We also perform the first calculation on model aurophilic systems using the SCS-MP 2 method and compare the results to high-accuracy CCSD(T) ones. The recently obtained high-resolution microwave spectra on MCN molecules (M=Cu, Ag, Au) provide an excellent testing ground for quantum chemistry. MP 2 or CCSD(T) calculations, correlating all 19 valence electrons of Au and including BSSE and SO corrections, are able to give bond lengths to 0. 6 pm, or better. Our calculated vibrational frequencies are expected to be better than the currently available experimental estimates. Qualitative evidence for multiple Au-C bonding in triatomic AuCN is also found.
