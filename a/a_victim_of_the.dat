5|$|A {{number of}} lives of Edward {{were written in}} the centuries {{following}} his death {{in which he was}} portrayed as a martyr, generally seen as <b>a</b> <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Queen Dowager Ælfthryth, mother of Æthelred. He is today recognized as a saint in the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Roman Catholic Church, and the Anglican Communion.|$|E

5|$|Another source may be Aesop's Fables as {{published}} by William Caxton—scholar John MacQueen considers this {{more likely than}} Disciplina clericalis—although the tale itself is not Aesopic but rather of the beast fable (also beast-epic) genre. The plots of such works are more complicated than their Aesopic counterpart, tend more towards ribaldry, and feature the fox making <b>a</b> <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wolf.|$|E
5|$|Competition from {{road traffic}} {{starting}} {{in the early twentieth}} century put pressure on the railway, and it was later <b>a</b> <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Beeching cuts. The line was seen as unprofitable, and it closed to passengers in 1964, and to goods traffic in 1967. Part of the trackbed today provides a section of the Milton Keynes redway system.|$|E

5|$|Critical {{commentary}} {{appeared in}} the media concerning the knighthood awarded to John Armitt in the 2012 New Year Honours for services to engineering and construction.

5|$|De Mauro {{was kidnapped}} {{on the evening}} of September 16, 1970, while coming back home from work, in the via delle Magnolie in Palermo. Thousands of police and Carabinieri with {{helicopters}} and dogs combed Sicily in vain in search of the reporter. De Mauro’s body has never been found, <b>a</b> <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> so-called lupara bianca, despite intensive search efforts by Palermo police assisted by top-level forces from Rome and even a special investigative committee of the Italian Parliament.|$|E

5|$|The Rommel myth, {{also known}} as the Rommel legend, as a term used by {{critical}} historians, refers to common depictions of German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel in popular culture and academic writings as an apolitical, brilliant commander, and <b>a</b> <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Third Reich due to his participation in the 20 July plot against Adolf Hitler. According to critical historians, such depictions are not accurate.|$|E
5|$|The named {{plaintiff}} in the case, Deborah Peterson, is {{the sister of}} <b>a</b> <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Beirut barracks bombings; joined by victims and other relatives of victims, she had won a default judgment in 2003 against Iran for {{its role in the}} bombings. Because of the large number of plaintiffs in the case—almost 1,000—the judge appointed special masters to determine each plaintiff's right to collect damages and appropriate amount of damages; in 2007, the judge entered a default judgment against Iran for $2,656,944,877 in damages.|$|E
5|$|Warwick's {{historical}} legacy {{has been a}} matter of much dispute. Historical opinion has alternated between seeing him as self-centred and rash, and regarding him as <b>a</b> <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whims of an ungrateful king. It is generally agreed, however, that in his own time he enjoyed great popularity in all layers of society, and that he was skilled at appealing to popular sentiments for political support.|$|E

5|$|After his career, Washington {{has complained}} of {{treatment}} {{he has received}} in relation to his punching of Tomjanovich. Washington has sought to portray himself as <b>a</b> <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fight and appears to have exaggerated some of the misfortunes that came his way {{as a result of}} it. Washington told The New York Times that he has been refused work as a coach time and again. However, Tom Davis hired him as an assistant coach at Stanford, and Davis wanted to bring him to Iowa when he went to coach there. Washington stayed at Stanford and later quit his assistant coaching position, and he subsequently worked as strength and conditioning coach for the Portland Trail Blazers.|$|E
5|$|An {{observance}} is {{held each}} year to remember {{the victims of the}} bombing. An annual marathon draws thousands, and allows runners to sponsor <b>a</b> <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bombing. For the tenth anniversary of the bombing, the city held 24days of activities, including a week-long series of events known as the National Week of Hope from April 17 to 24, 2005. As in previous years, the tenth anniversary of the bombing observances began with a service at 9:02a.m., marking the moment the bomb went off, with the traditional 168seconds of silence—onesecond for each person who was killed {{as a result of the}} blast. The service also included the traditional reading of the names, read by children to symbolize the future of Oklahoma City.|$|E
5|$|Monroe's {{enduring}} {{popularity is}} linked to her conflicted public image. On the one hand, she remains a sex symbol, beauty icon {{and one of the}} most famous stars of classical Hollywood cinema. On the other, she is also remembered for her troubled private life, unstable childhood, struggle for professional respect, and her death and the conspiracy theories surrounding it. She has been written about by scholars and journalists interested in gender and feminism, such as Gloria Steinem, Jacqueline Rose, Molly Haskell, Sarah Churchwell, and Lois Banner. Some, such as Steinem, have viewed her as <b>a</b> <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> studio system. Others, such as Haskell, Rose, and Churchwell, have instead stressed Monroe's proactive role in her career and her participation in the creation of her public persona.|$|E
