These mutants were unable {{to grow in the}} presence of toluene (<b>log</b> <b>Pow</b> 2. 8) but they could grow in medium overlaid with organic solvents having a <b>log</b> <b>Pow</b> value higher than that of toluene such as p-xylene (<b>log</b> <b>Pow</b> 3. 1), cyclohexane (<b>log</b> <b>Pow</b> 3. 4) and n-hexane (<b>log</b> <b>Pow</b> 3. 9).

The AcrAB-TolC efflux pump system is involved in maintaining intrinsic solvent resistance. We inspected the solvent resistance of ΔacrAB and/or ΔtolC mutants {{in the presence of a}} large volume of solvent. Both mutants were hypersensitive to weakly harmful solvents, such as nonane (<b>log</b> <b>POW</b> = 5. 5). The ΔtolC mutant was more sensitive to nonane than the ΔacrAB mutant. The solvent entered the E. coli cells rapidly. Entry of solvents with a <b>log</b> <b>POW</b> higher than 4. 4 was retarded in the parent cells, and the intracellular levels of these solvents were maintained at low levels. The ΔtolC mutant accumulated n-nonane or decane (<b>log</b> <b>POW</b> = 6. 0) more abundantly than the parent or the ΔacrAB mutant.

Whole-cell biocatalysts are available in two-phase systems consisting of organic solvent and an aqueous medium, that are potentially advantageous for the bioconversion of hydrophobic and/or toxic organic compounds (Schmid et al. 1998;Sardessai and Bhosle 2004; Heipieper et al. 2007). The use of a second organic phase improves productivity levels and product recovery, unlike the case with conventional media whose substrate solubility is poor. One of the main limitations {{in the application of}} whole-cell biocatalysts in two-phase systems is the instability of biocatalysts due to the toxicity of organic solvents toward the cells.

So far, {{the main drawback of}} the SiFA {{technology for the}} synthesis of PET-radiotracers is the high lipophilicity of the resulting radiopharmaceutical. Consequently, we synthesized new SiFA-octreotate analogues derivatized with Fmoc-NH-PEG-COOH, Fmoc-Asn(Ac?AcNH-?-Glc) -OH, and SiFA-aldehyde (SIFA-A). The substances could be labeled in high yields (38 ± 4 %) and specific activities between 29 and 56 GBq/?mol in short synthesis times of less than 30 min (e. o. b.). The in vitro evaluation of the synthesized conjugates displayed a sst 2 receptor affinity (IC?? = 3. 3 ± 0. 3 nM) comparable to that of somatostatin- 28. As a measure of lipophilicity of the conjugates, the <b>log</b> <b>P(ow)</b> was determined and found to be 0. 96 for SiFA-Asn(AcNH-?-Glc) -PEG-Tyr³-octreotate and 1. 23 for SiFA-Asn(AcNH-?-Glc) -Tyr³-octreotate, which is considerably lower than for SiFA-Tyr³-octreotate (<b>log</b> <b>P(ow)</b> = 1. 59). The initial in vivo evaluation of [¹?F]SiFA-Asn(AcNH-?-Glc) -PEG-Tyr³-octreotate revealed a significant uptake of radiotracer in the tumor tissue of AR 42 J tumor-bearing nude mice of 7. 7 % ID/g tissue weight.

The cells were grown in a medium containing 33 % (v/v) alkanes of increasing <b>log</b> <b>Pow</b> values. The outer membrane proteins were extracted by alkaline extraction from the late log phase cells {{and changes in the}} protein expression were studied by 2 -D gel electrophoresis. Seven protein spots showed significant differential expression in the solvent exposed cells. The tryptic digest of the differentially regulated proteins were identified by LC-ESI MS/MS. The identity of these proteins matched with porins OprD, OprE, OprF, OprH, Opr 86, LPS assembly protein and A-type flagellin. The reported pI values of these proteins were in the range of 4. 94 - 8. 67 and the molecular weights were in the range of 19. 5 - 104. 5 kDa. The results suggest significant down-regulation of the A-type flagellin, OprF and OprD and up-regulation of OprE, OprH, Opr 86 and LPS assembly protein in presence of organic solvents. OprF and OprD are implicated in antibiotic uptake and outer membrane stability, whereas A-type flagellin confers motility and chemotaxis. Up-regulated OprE is an anaerobically-induced porin while Opr 86 is responsible for transport of small molecules and assembly of the outer membrane proteins.

At the primary school, 100 % of treated water samples had no detectable levels of total coliform bacteria (TCB) in buckets filled by researchers. For all treated school buckets, 74 % of samples achieved less than or equal to 1 CFU/ 100 mL and 3. 2 <b>average</b> <b>log</b> reduction of TCB.
