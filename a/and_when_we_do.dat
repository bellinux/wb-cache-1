500|$|The {{lives of}} all five become more miserable, and each {{conforms}} to the regime's demands even as they lose their jobs for apparently political reasons. They discuss fleeing the country, and Georg {{is the first to}} do so. Weeks after he arrives in Germany, he is found dead from a fall from the window of a Frankfurt hotel. The narrator and Edgar likewise acquire passports and go to Germany, but continue to receive death threats after emigrating. Kurt remains in Romania, no longer working; he is later found hanged. The novel ends with the same passage as it began: [...] "When we don't speak, said Edgar, we become unbearable, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>do,</b> we make fools of ourselves".|$|E
2500|$|Becnel {{reacted to}} Williams' {{execution}} by saying, [...] "We {{are going to}} prove his innocence, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>do,</b> {{we are going to}} show that Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger is, in fact, himself a cold blooded murderer." ...|$|E

60|$|It was a {{good while}} after that before we ventured to steal any more grapes, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>we</b> stirred up another {{troublesome}} brigand, and then we ceased all further speculation in that line. I suppose that fellow that rode by on the mule posted all the sentinels, from Athens to the Piraeus, about us.|$|R
2500|$|On September 27, 2005, Burnett {{was asked}} by the Marlins to leave the team. The request came a day after he made {{comments}} criticizing the organization: [...] "We played scared. We managed scared. We coached scared", he told reporters following the Marlins' 5–3 loss at Turner Field. [...] "I'm sick of it, man. It's depressing around here. A 3–0 ballgame, I give up one run and leave guys on base, it's like they expect us to mess up. <b>And</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>do,</b> they chew us out. There is no positive, nothing around here for anybody." ...|$|E
2500|$|Upon arrival, Bree {{was shown}} as a polite and sensitive, well trained doctor, sharply {{contrasting}} her sister Brooke (Beth Allen). The character made friends quickly and appeared overly generous. However, as the character developed, {{it was revealed}} she too had a nasty side and {{was a lot more}} similar to Brooke than originally thought. Blampied enjoyed playing the personality change, labelling it as; [...] "making a great descent" [...] and stating; [...] "It's a massive change from how the character arrived and through her relationship with Brooke and Vinnie, it goes haywire. I'm looking forward to the challenge of how to justify those decisions she makes." [...] Bree's manipulative persona was blamed on her [...] "tumultuous upbringing" [...] which saw her be fostered by several families before being adopted at 10. As a result, she suffered from self-consciousness. Blampied enjoyed playing such a complex character, stating: [...] "It's definitely a lot more interesting than always being the nice guy because you do get to say and do some things you would never do and it's the furthest thing from my personal character and demeanor, so it is quite a turnaround." [...] Blampied went on to explain her mixed opinions of Bree: [...] "I obviously don't agree with what she's doing. Sometimes I read the script and go, 'Why are you doing that? There are a hundred easier ways to do that.' I have days where I really don't like Bree and what she's doing." [...] The character has been described as [...] "conniving" [...] and [...] "scheming". Blampied did not at first realise how manipulative Bree was to become and when she realised the extent to which writers were pushing her antagonistic characterisation, she described it as [...] "daunting". However Blampied had been warned, [...] "Someone told me, if you're on Shortland Street, always play your character as if you have a secret – because you will have a secret!" [...] To portray Bree's penultimate breakdown, Blampied researched borderline personality disorder and severe narcissism. Blampied enjoyed how Bree was portrayed in her final scene, stating: [...] "We don't often see Bree's vulnerable side side <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> she's still being manipulative and deceitful ... I really like the way she ends up because {{there is an element of}} real sadness to it ... when she realises how wrong she's been." [...] Blampied cared for her character and hoped for an uneventful future for Bree, [...] "I'd like to see her get well, hold down a job and maybe even get into a relationship. Life is hard for her and always has been. I care about Bree and I know that sounds like a weird thing to say." [...] Describing Bree upon her return, Blampied stated, [...] "She's still mentally very fragile, and her manipulative tendencies are most definitely still at the surface", but affirmed, [...] "she's a lot more aware now though".|$|E

6000|$|... 'Wait, Seth,' Rube said; 'we don't {{know where}} the darned brute is kept. He warn't up at the hut, and we might waste an hour in finding him, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>did,</b> he ain't a critter to be wiped out like a babby.' ...|$|R
500|$|In 1991, Drummond admitted: [...] "We didn't {{listen to}} 1987 What The Fuck's Going On {{for a long}} time, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>we</b> were embarrassed by {{it because it was}} so badly recorded. But I still felt {{we were able to get}} a lot out of {{ourselves}} through it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, we'll be in soon, Sara," [...] I said impatiently. But we didn't {{go in for}} an hour, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> Sara was cross, {{and after}} Walter had gone she told me I was a very silly girl to be so {{reckless}} of my health and risk getting pneumonia loitering out in the dew with a sentimental boy.|$|R
6000|$|... "Much {{obliged to}} you, ma'am!" [...] says Mr. Guppy, {{divesting}} himself of his wet dreadnought in the hall. [...] "Us London lawyers don't often get an out, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>do,</b> {{we like to}} make the most of it, you know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know; I only guess. We used to ride {{often to}} White Sage and Lund; now we go seldom, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> {{there seem to}} be Navajos near the camp at night, and riding the ridges by day. I believe Father Naab knows." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We mustn't {{lose any}} time here, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> start {{it must be}} quickly. We will follow this track in, and keep right on in it; for we shall either find the team now in the bushes, or else the men will have done as I feared--passed us while {{we were on the}} road." ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{interview}} Sachs {{also had}} a funny anecdote about the casting of Arye Gross who played gang member Turbo in the movie: [...] "He came in and read for me, {{and he was talking}} like Marlon Brando, through his nose. It was fantastic, so I gave him the part. <b>And</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> the scene, he didn’t talk like that. I said, ‘You’re not talking like you did in your reading!’ And he said, ‘I had a cold.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A few hours, probably. This {{tranquil}} {{moment is}} yours {{make the most}} of it <b>and,</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> can <b>do</b> no more for him, we'll comfort one another." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{a moment}} Sophy was round my neck, {{as well as}} the child, and her husband was a-wringing my hand with his face hid, and we all had to shake {{ourselves}} together before we could get over it. <b>And</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> begin to get over it, and I saw the pretty child a-talking, pleased and quick and eager and busy, to her mother, in the signs that I had first taught her mother, the happy and yet pitying tears fell rolling down my face.|$|R
6000|$|... "As for {{the date}} of our departure, it is still {{impossible}} for me to give you any definite information. Eustace recovers very slowly; the doctor has not yet allowed him to leave his bed; <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> travel we must journey by easy stages. It will be at least six weeks, at the earliest, before we can hope to be back again in dear Old England.|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite right, Brom," [...] cried my father; [...] "colonels {{are good}} enough for us; <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> make a man that, even, we are a little {{particular}} about his being respectable and fit for the office. Nevertheless, learning will not hurt Corny, and to college he shall go, let you do as you please with Dirck. So that matter is settled, and no more need be said about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm not blaming you, Ralph, for I {{know as well}} as you do that it was {{not your}} fault. It was a portion of one of Bob's schemes, and, without caring how much he has injured us, he is {{probably}} congratulating himself on its perfect success. But come, let's go and lie down for a little while, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> get away from here in the morning, we will be careful not to place ourselves where Bob can use us again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When <b>we</b> talk of <b>doing</b> good to people," [...] {{said the}} archdeacon, [...] "we often make terrible mistakes. It so often happens that <b>we</b> don't know <b>when</b> <b>we</b> are <b>doing</b> good <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> are <b>doing</b> harm." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2009, Microsoft's COFEE {{forensic}} tool {{was leaked}} on the site. The software was later removed by administrators. The What.CD staff {{said of the}} removal: [...] "Suddenly, {{we were forced to}} take a real look at the program, its source, and the potential impact on the site and security of our users <b>and</b> staff. <b>And</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>did,</b> <b>we</b> didn't like what came of it. So, a decision was made. The torrent was removed (and it is not to be uploaded here again)." [...] The leaked program is now available through several torrent sites, and can be found on Wikileaks or via Google.|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, we {{white men}} are hogs," [...] Smoke {{filled in the}} interval, resentful himself at the part he was {{compelled}} to play. [...] "We'd sell our souls for gold, and all that; but {{once in a while}} we forget about it and turn loose and do something without a thought of how much there is in it. <b>And</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> that, Cultus George, watch out.

6000|$|... "Sir Thomas {{would not}} have had it any other way," [...] said Lady Tringle, with a little severity, feeling that Lucy's accord had hardly been as generous as it should be. But she {{recovered}} herself quickly, remembering how much it was that Ayala was to get, how much that Lucy was to lose. [...] "But, my dear, we shall see you very often, you know. It is not so far across the park; <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> have a few parties again--" ...|$|E
60|$|A full {{stomach is}} a great aid to poetry, and indeed no {{sentiment}} of any kind can stand upon an empty one. We have not time or inclination to indulge in fanciful troubles until we have got rid of our real misfortunes. We do not sigh over dead dicky-birds with the bailiff in the house, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not know where on earth to get our next shilling from, we do not worry as to whether our mistress' smiles are cold, or hot, or lukewarm, or anything else about them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Running {{from the}} cover of brush to the {{trenches}} was no easy matter," [...] says one Rough Rider who was there. [...] "We had dug the trenches in a hurry, and had no passages from the rear leading to them. All <b>we</b> could <b>do</b> was {{to wait for a}} signal, and then rush, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> that, the Spaniards would open a hot fire and keep it up for perhaps fifteen minutes. The sun was enough to turn a man's brain, and more than one poor fellow caught a fever there that proved fatal to him." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It's come to me," [...] said Mrs. Lecks, {{speaking}} very gravely, [...] "that it's {{no use for}} us to talk of {{the family}} bein' here, or bein' there, till we've gone over this house. If we find that they have, as far as we know, gone away in good health and spirits, that's all well enough; but if anything's happened in this house, I don't want to be here with what's happened--at least, without knowin' it, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> go over the house, I want a man to go with us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Truly, Beric, {{you have}} profited by your lessons," [...] Aska said, laying his hand kindly on the lad's shoulder. [...] "The Druids spoke wisely when they prophesied a great future for you. Before {{we have done}} we may have many Roman strongholds to capture, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> I will see that the council order that your advice be taken {{as to how they}} shall be attacked; but in this matter {{tomorrow}} things must remain as they are. Unser is a proud chief, and headstrong, and would not brook any interference. Should he be repulsed in the assault, I will advise the queen to call up the Sarci, and allow you to proceed in your own manner." ...|$|E
60|$|To avoid {{misconception}} we must {{repeat the}} necessary cautions about accepting evidence as to high gods of low races. The missionary {{who does not}} see in every alien god a devil is apt to welcome traces of an original supernatural revelation, darkened by all peoples but the Jews. We shall not, however, rely much on missionary evidence, <b>and,</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>do,</b> we must now be equally on our guard against the anthropological bias in the missionary himself. Having read Mr. Spencer and Mr. Tylor, and finding himself among ancestor-worshippers (as he sometimes does), he is apt to think that ancestor-worship explains any traces of {{a belief in the}} Supreme Being. Against each and every bias of observers we must be watchful.|$|E
6000|$|... "Stick close together," [...] yelled Jones, as we {{launched}} forward. We {{made the mistake}} of not going back to cross the canyon, for the hounds soon went up the opposite side. As we rode on and on, the sounds of the chase lessened, and finally ceased. To our great chagrin we found it necessary to retrace our steps, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> get over the deep gully, so much time had elapsed that we despaired of coming up with Jim. Emett led, keeping close on Jim's trail, which showed plain in the dust, and we followed.|$|R

60|$|We were {{a square}} party of four--Sir Charles and Amelia, myself and Isabel. We had nice big rooms, {{on the first}} floor, {{overlooking}} the lake; and as none of us was possessed with the faintest symptom of that incipient mania which shows itself {{in the form of}} an insane desire to climb mountain heights of disagreeable steepness and unnecessary snowiness, I will venture to assert we all enjoyed ourselves. We spent most of our time sensibly in lounging about the lake on the jolly little steamers; <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> a mountain climb, it was on the Rigi or Pilatus--where an engine undertook all the muscular work for us.|$|R
