5|$|By 05:50 the <b>airborne</b> <b>troops</b> {{had secured}} {{the area as}} well as the nearby village of Kanne, but they were then {{subjected}} to a strong counter-attack which was only repulsed with the aid of air support from Stuka divebombers. The defenders launched several more counter-attacks during the night, ensuring that the <b>airborne</b> <b>troops</b> could not be relieved until the morning of 11 May. Group Iron suffered the heaviest casualties of all three assault groups assigned to capture the bridges with twenty-two dead and twenty-six wounded. One of the <b>airborne</b> <b>troops</b> assigned to the Group was taken prisoner by the Belgians. He was later freed by German forces at a British prisoner of war camp at Dunkirk.|$|E
5|$|On 10 May 1940, Hitler {{launched}} the Battle of France, a major offensive against France and the Low Countries. The SS supplied {{two of the}} 89 divisions employed. The LSSAH and elements of the SS-VT participated in the ground invasion of the Battle of the Netherlands. Simultaneously, <b>airborne</b> <b>troops</b> were dropped to capture key Dutch airfields, bridges, and railways.

5|$|The nine {{remaining}} gliders transporting the <b>airborne</b> <b>troops</b> {{assigned to}} Group Granite successfully {{landed on the}} roof of Fort Eben-Emael, using arrester-parachutes to slow their descent and rapidly bring them to a halt. The <b>airborne</b> <b>troops</b> rapidly emerged from the gliders and began attaching explosive charges to those emplacements {{on the top of the}} Fort which housed the artillery pieces that could target the three captured bridges. In the southern part of the Fort, Objective No. 18, an artillery observation casemate housing three 75mm artillery pieces was damaged with a light demolition charge and then permanently destroyed with a heavier charge, which collapsed the casemate's observation dome and part of the roof of the Fort itself. Objective No. 12, a traversing turret holding two more artillery pieces was also destroyed by <b>airborne</b> <b>troops,</b> who then moved to Objective No. 26, a turret holding another three 75mm weapons; although explosives were detonated against this and the <b>airborne</b> <b>troops</b> assigned to destroy it moved off, this proved to be premature as one of the guns was rapidly brought to bear against the attackers, who were forced to assault it for a second time to destroy it. Another pair of 75mm guns in a cupola was disabled, as was a barracks known to house Belgian troops. However, attempts to destroy Objective No. 24 proved to be less successful; the objective, twin turrets with heavy-calibre guns mounted on a rotating cupola, was too large for <b>airborne</b> <b>troops</b> from a single glider to destroy on their own, forcing troops from two gliders to be used. Primitive unlined shaped charges were affixed to the turrets and detonated, but whilst they shook the turrets they did not destroy them, and other <b>airborne</b> <b>troops</b> were forced to climb the turrets and smash the gun barrels.|$|E

5|$|As these {{secondary}} {{objectives were}} attacked, a single glider landed {{on top of}} the Fort, from which emerged Oberleutnant Rudolf Witzig. After his glider had unintentionally landed in German territory, he had radioed for another tug, and it landed in the field with a replacement glider. Once the <b>airborne</b> <b>troops</b> had broken down fences and hedges obstructing the aircraft, they boarded the new glider and were towed through anti-aircraft fire to the fort. Having achieved their primary objectives of disabling the artillery pieces possessed by the fort, the <b>airborne</b> <b>troops</b> then held it against Belgian counter-attacks, which began almost immediately. These counter-attacks were made by Belgian infantry formations without artillery support and were uncoordinated. This allowed the <b>airborne</b> <b>troops</b> to repel them with machine-gun fire. Artillery from several smaller Forts nearby and Belgian field artillery units also targeted the <b>airborne</b> <b>troops,</b> but this too was uncoordinated and achieved nothing and often aided the <b>airborne</b> <b>troops</b> in repelling counter-attacks by Belgian infantry units. Patrols were also used to ensure that the garrison stayed in the interior of the fort and did not attempt to emerge and mount an attempt to retake the fort. Any attempt by the garrison to launch a counter-attack would have been stymied {{by the fact that the}} only possible route for such an attack was up a single, spiral staircase, and any embrasures looking out onto the Fort had either been captured or disabled. The plan for the assault had called for Group Granite to be relieved by 51st Engineer Battalion within a few hours of seizing the Fort, but the Group was not actually relieved until 7:00 on 11 May. Heavy Belgian resistance, as well as several demolished bridges over the River Meuse, had forced the battalion to lay down new bridges, delaying it significantly. Once the <b>airborne</b> <b>troops</b> had been relieved, the battalion, in conjunction with an infantry regiment that arrived shortly after the engineers, mounted an attack on the main entrance to the fort. Faced with this attack, the garrison surrendered at 12:30, suffering sixty men killed and forty wounded. The Germans captured more than a thousand Belgian soldiers. Group Granite suffered six killed and nineteen wounded.|$|E
5|$|However, the Russian Army's {{transformation}} into a professional army was not deemed as successful. In September 2008, General Vladimir Boldyrev acknowledged {{that many of}} the professional soldiers did not have better training than the conscripts. Russian <b>Airborne</b> <b>Troops</b> and special forces conducted most of the land fighting. Due to the Russian Air Force's inability to penetrate Georgian air defence, <b>airborne</b> <b>troops</b> could not be airlifted behind Georgian lines. An ambush of a ground-troop commander, in which only five of thirty vehicles in his convoy survived, indicated intelligence and surveillance negligence. Many Russian land units reportedly had an insufficient ammunition supply.|$|E
5|$|In the {{northern}} {{section of the}} fort, similar actions were taking place, as the <b>airborne</b> <b>troops</b> raced to destroy or otherwise disable the fortifications housing artillery pieces. Objective No. 13 was a casemate housing multiple machine-guns whose arcs of fire covered {{the western side of}} the Fort; to destroy the casemate, the <b>airborne</b> <b>troops</b> used a flamethrower to force the Belgian soldiers manning the weapons to retreat, and then detonated shaped charges against the fortification to disable it. Another observation cupola fitted with machine-guns, Objective No. 19, was destroyed, but two further objectives, Nos. 15 and 16 were found to be dummy installations. Unexpected complications came from Objective No. 23, a retractable cupola housing two 75mm artillery pieces. It had been assumed that the weapons in this fortification could not stop the airborne assault, but this assumption was found to be false when the weapons opened fire, forcing the <b>airborne</b> <b>troops</b> in the area to go to cover. The rapid fire of the weapons led to air support being summoned, and a Stuka squadron bombed the cupola. Although the bombs did not destroy the cupola, the explosions did force the Belgians to retract it {{throughout the rest of the}} fighting. Any exterior entrances and exits located by the <b>airborne</b> <b>troops</b> were destroyed with explosives to seal the garrison inside the Fort, giving the garrison few opportunities to attempt a counter-attack. The <b>airborne</b> <b>troops</b> had achieved their initial objective of destroying or disabling the artillery pieces that the fort could have used to bombard the captured bridges, but they still faced a number of small cupolas and emplacements that had to be disabled. A number of these included anti-aircraft weapons and machine-guns.|$|E
50|$|Major General John DeForest Barker, U.S. Air Force, {{opined that}} {{the failure of the}} Joint <b>Airborne</b> <b>Troop</b> Board and the other joint boards was not {{remarkable}} because they had been tasked to resolve at a lower organizational level problems which could not be resolved at as higher level.|$|R

5|$|Ten of {{the eleven}} gliders {{transporting}} Group Concrete landed next to the Vroenhoven bridge at 05:15, the eleventh glider having been hit by anti-aircraft fire {{en route to the}} bridge and being forced to land prematurely inside Dutch territory. The gliders were engaged by heavy anti-aircraft fire as they landed, causing one of the gliders to stall in mid-air. The resulting crash severely wounded three <b>airborne</b> <b>troops.</b> The rest of the gliders landed without damage. One of the gliders landed near to the fortification housing the bridge detonators. This allowed the <b>airborne</b> <b>troops</b> to rapidly assault the position. They killed the occupants and tore out the wires connecting the explosives to the detonator set, ensuring the bridge could not be destroyed. The remaining Belgian defenders resisted fiercely by mounting several counter-attacks in an attempt to recapture the bridge. They were repelled with the aid of several machine-guns dropped by parachute to the <b>airborne</b> <b>troops</b> at 06:15. Constant Belgian attacks meant that Group Concrete were not withdrawn and relieved by an infantry battalion until 21:40. They suffered losses of seven dead and twenty-four wounded.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle was}} a {{strategic}} {{victory for the}} German forces, with the <b>airborne</b> <b>troops</b> landing {{on top of the}} fortress via the use of gliders and using explosives and flamethrowers to disable the outer defences of the fortress. The Fallschirmjäger then entered the fortress, killing a number of defenders and containing the rest in the lower sections of the fortress. Simultaneously, the rest of the German assault force had landed near the three bridges over the Canal, destroyed a number of pillboxes and defensive positions and defeated the Belgian forces guarding the bridges, capturing them and bringing them under German control. The <b>airborne</b> <b>troops</b> suffered heavy casualties during the operation, but succeeded in holding the bridges until the arrival of German ground forces, who then aided the <b>airborne</b> <b>troops</b> in assaulting the fortress a second time and forcing the surrender of the remaining members of the garrison. German forces were then able to utilize two bridges over the Canal to bypass a number of Belgian defensive positions and advance into Belgium to aid in the invasion of the country. The bridge at Kanne was destroyed, forcing German engineers to construct a new bridge.|$|E
5|$|The divisional {{training}} exercise {{took place}} around Camp Mackall, North Carolina, and {{suffered from a}} number of difficulties and problems. Poor weather delayed the beginning of the exercise until the night of 25 September, and it was only then that the aircraft carrying the first three battalions of paratroopers could take off and attempt to drop the <b>airborne</b> <b>troops</b> on three separate drop zones. A combination of poor visibility, and a lack of sufficient training for the pilots of the transport aircraft, resulted in the paratroopers being dispersed widely when dropped. Only sixty-five percent of the <b>airborne</b> <b>troops</b> and equipment dropped on the first drop zone were ready for action ninety minutes later, and in the second drop zone the <b>airborne</b> <b>troops</b> were so scattered that by 10:00 the next morning the commander of the battalion only had control over twenty percent of his men. A similar number of paratroopers missed the third drop zone, although the majority were dropped in a relatively small area where they could gather. Further problems were encountered, as a plane crash killed eight paratroopers and four aircrew, and the glider-borne elements of the division due to land were delayed by poor weather. After the initial night, the exercise continued for a further three days and included a complex supply mission designed to test whether it was possible to supply an isolated battalion of <b>airborne</b> <b>troops.</b>|$|E

50|$|On 26 April 1951, the Joint Chiefs of Staff {{approved}} {{the first two}} chapters of Joint Action Armed Forces. On 19 September 1951, the United States Departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force jointly published the Joint Action Armed Forces Manual (Army: FM 110-5, Navy: FAAF, Air Force: AFM 1-1).

5|$|The two commanders {{believed}} that training by both <b>airborne</b> <b>troops</b> and aircrews could {{be completed by}} the end of February, when there would be suitable meteorological conditions for such an operation to take place. Training for the raid was begun immediately, but encountered several problems. 38 Wing was a new unit {{still in the process of}} formation, so No. 51 Squadron RAF under Wing Commander Percy Charles Pickard was selected to provide the aircraft and aircrew needed for the operation, although Group Captain Nigel Norman of 38 Wing would remain in overall command. Another problem encountered was the state of training of the unit of <b>airborne</b> <b>troops</b> chosen to raid the installation.|$|E
5|$|Even as {{the initial}} 400 gliders were being produced, several {{problems}} with the Hotspur's design were uncovered, the primary one being that the glider did not carry sufficient troops. Although it had been designed to transport eight <b>airborne</b> <b>troops</b> and a cargo of , this {{was found to be}} inadequate. Tactically it was believed that <b>airborne</b> <b>troops</b> should be landed in groups far larger than eight, and the number of aircraft therefore required to tow the gliders needed to land larger groups would be unfeasible; there were also concerns that the gliders would have to be towed in tandem if used operationally, which would be extremely difficult during nighttime and through cloud formations. Its disappointing glide ratio was also a contributing factor to reevaluate the assault glider concept.|$|E

5|$|After {{a period}} of {{extensive}} training, the airborne force took off in two aircraft–glider combinations {{on the night of}} 19 November 1942. Both managed to reach the Norwegian coast, but neither was able to reach their objective. The first pair suffered from navigational difficulties and severe weather, which resulted in the tow rope snapping and the first glider crash–landing, with its towing aircraft returning to base; three <b>airborne</b> <b>troops</b> were killed outright, with the survivors captured shortly after the crash. The second pair fared even worse, with both aircraft and glider crashing into a mountain for unknown reasons; the aircrew and some <b>airborne</b> <b>troops</b> were killed outright, and those who survived were taken prisoner. None survived for very long, being executed as a result of Adolf Hitler's Commando Order, which stated all Commando personnel were to be immediately executed upon capture. At the end of the war, Wehrmacht personnel were tried and condemned to death for their part in the executions.|$|E
5|$|All {{but one of}} the ten gliders {{carrying}} the <b>airborne</b> <b>troops</b> assigned to Group Iron were able to land next to their objective, the bridge at Kanne. Due to a navigation error by the pilots of the transport aircraft towing the gliders, one of the gliders was dropped in the wrong area. The other nine gliders were towed through heavy anti-aircraft fire and released at 05:35. As the gliders began to descend towards their objective, the bridge was destroyed by several demolition explosions set off by the Belgian garrison. Unlike the garrisons of the other two bridges, the Belgian defenders at Kanne had been forewarned, as the German mechanized column heading for the bridge to reinforce Group Iron arrived twenty minutes ahead of schedule. Its appearance ruined any chance of a surprise assault and gave the defenders sufficient time to destroy the bridge. As the gliders came in to land, one was hit by anti-aircraft fire and crashed into the ground killing most of the occupants. The remaining eight landed successfully, and the <b>airborne</b> <b>troops</b> stormed the Belgian positions and eliminated the defenders.|$|E

5|$|All nine gliders {{carrying}} the troops assigned to Group Steel landed {{next to the}} bridge at Veldwezelt at 05:20, the barbed-wire wrapped around the landing skids of the gliders succeeding in rapidly bringing them to a halt. The glider belonging to Leutnant Altmann had landed {{some distance from the}} bridge, and a second had landed directly in front of a Belgian pillbox, which began engaging both groups of <b>airborne</b> <b>troops</b> with small-arms fire. The non-commissioned officer in charge of the troops from the second glider hurled grenades at the pillbox whilst one of his men laid an explosive charge at the door and detonated it, allowing the bunker to be assaulted and removed as an obstacle. Simultaneously, Altmann gathered his troops and led them along a ditch running parallel to the bridge until two men were able to reach the canal bank and climb onto the girders of the bridge and disconnect the demolition charges placed there by the Belgian garrison. Thus the <b>airborne</b> <b>troops</b> prevented the Belgians from destroying the bridge, though they still faced the rest of the Belgian defenders. The defenders held on until a platoon of German reinforcements arrived and forced them to retire to a nearby village. However, the assaulting force's small-arms fire could not overcome two field-guns located five hundred metres from the bridge, thus forcing Altmann to call for air support. Several Junkers Ju 87 Stukas responded and knocked out the guns. Group Steel was to be relieved by 14:30, but Belgian resistance delayed their arrival in strength until 21:30. During the fighting, the attacking force left eight <b>airborne</b> <b>troops</b> dead and thirty wounded.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 27 February, {{after a period of}} intense {{training}} and several delays due to poor weather, a company of <b>airborne</b> <b>troops</b> under the command of Major John Frost parachuted into France {{a few miles from the}} installation. The main force then assaulted the villa in which the radar equipment was kept, killing several members of the German garrison and capturing the installation after a brief firefight.|$|E
5|$|Several modern {{historians have}} also praised the {{operation}} and the improvements that were made for Varsity. G. G. Norton argued that the operation benefited from the lessons learned from previous operations, and Brian Jewell agrees, arguing that the lessons of Market Garden had been learned as the airborne forces were concentrated and quickly dropped, giving the defenders little time to recover. Norton also argues that improvements were made for supporting the airborne troops; he notes {{that a large number}} of artillery pieces were available to cover the landings and that observers were dropped with the airborne forces, thus augmenting the firepower and flexibility of the <b>airborne</b> <b>troops.</b> He also highlights the development of a technique that allowed entire brigades to be landed in tactical groups, giving them greater flexibility. Dropping the airborne forces after the ground forces had breached the Rhine also ensured that the <b>airborne</b> <b>troops</b> would not have to fight for long before being relieved, a major improvement on the manner in which the previous large-scale airborne operation, Market Garden, had been conducted.|$|E
