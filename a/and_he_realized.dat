5|$|Hubert Humphrey got {{his start}} in Minnesota {{politics}} in the early 1940s. He was an organizer of the Minnesota Democratic Party at the time, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> that the party's best chance of success would come if the Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party merged with the Democratic party. Other party leaders had been discussing the merger, but Humphrey's idea {{was to keep the}} Farmer-Labor name {{in the name of the}} merged party, in order to gain the strength of thousands of loyal voters. Thus, the party got the name Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party.|$|E

But shortly after they talk, Pam learns her father has sought a separation and will be looking for his own apartment. Pam assumes it is because of something Jim said to her father, and blames him for their breakup. Pam later confronts her father about why he left her mother while Jim looks on through the window. Pam returns to the office and tells Jim her father left because Jim told him how much he loves Pam, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> that he had never felt that way about her mother even at their best. Pam comes to terms with the separation and tearfully embraces Jim. Later, she expresses confidence that the two are true soul mates. Andy overhears her comments about her real life scenario, still thinks she is talking about the film they watched and concludes that he cannot be a movie critic because he is not as insightful as Jim and Pam.|$|E

25|$|After {{the failure}} of the Feltre meeting and the first bombing of Rome, the crisis accelerated. The day after Feltre, 20 July, Mussolini met Ambrosio twice. During the second meeting, in the evening, the Duce told him that he had decided to write to Hitler, confessing the need for Italy to abandon the alliance. Still angry about the missed {{opportunity}} to do this in Feltre, the indignant Ambrosio offered his resignation to the Duce, who rejected it. For Ambrosio, after Feltre Mussolini was useless, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> that any hope that he could pull the chestnuts out of the fire was an illusion.

He says; {{that while he was}} going to America, he was on the boat (ferry), and he saw the way the boat he was travelling in – was rocking in the huge sea – all under the control of Allah without it sinking or capsizing. At that point he realized the power of Allah. He said Iman (belief) entered into his heart due to this. His second scenario was in San Francisco, when he went on top of a mountain, and he could see the whole of creation in front of him, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> the beauty and harmony that existed amongst the creation as a whole.

[...] He advanced his army to the Green Spring Plantation, and, based on intelligence that only the British rear guard was left at the crossing, sent General Wayne forward to attack them on July 6. [...] In reality, the earl had laid a clever trap. [...] Crossing only his baggage and some troops to guard them, he sent [...] "deserters" [...] to falsely inform Lafayette of the situation. [...] In the Battle of Green Spring, General Wayne managed to escape the trap, but with significant casualties {{and the loss of}} two field pieces. [...] Cornwallis then crossed the river, and marched his army to Suffolk.|$|E
500|$|In June, Hamilton's {{return to}} Fort Hamilton {{with a large}} group of militia-aligned Native Americans coincided with the arrival of one of the {{survivors}} of the June 14 Spafford Farm massacre. The survivor, Francis Spencer, arrived at the fort around the same time as Hamilton did - accompanied by U.S. aligned Menominee. Afraid that the fort, like his party at the farm, had also been attacked, Spencer retreated back into the woods. He avoided the fort for between six and nine days, when hunger finally drove him into the open <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> his mistake. On June 16, about an hour after the fight at Horseshoe Bend, Hamilton arrived on the battlefield with U.S. aligned Menominee, Sioux and Ho-Chunk warriors. According to Dodge, the warriors were given some of the scalps his men had taken, with which they were [...] "delighted". Dodge also reported that the allied warriors then proceeded onto the battlefield and mutilated the corpses of the fallen Kickapoo.|$|E

500|$|... "Telepathy" [...] {{garnered}} {{a positive}} response from music critics. Writing for Idolator, Mike Wass was initially underwhelmed by [...] "Telepathy" [...] upon its release. According to him, he downloaded the song regardless, and added it {{to what he calls}} his [...] "Upbeat Xtina" [...] playlist. He writes that a few months later, the song played on shuffle <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> that he had previously brushed off what he now believed {{to be one of the}} best and most underrated songs of 2016. Robbie Daw of the same publication was complimentary of Aguilera's vocal performance, opining that she [...] "sings beautifully amidst a swirling wall of sound." [...] He continued to write that it was a welcome change of tempo following the release of her previous single, [...] "Change". Samuel Suri of the Daily Mail similarly praised the singer's vocals, writing that she [...] "bringing her breathtaking blend of growling and belting to a disco anthem." ...|$|E
500|$|As the battlecruiser squadrons {{closed on}} each other, Regensburg ordered the torpedo boats {{to make a}} general attack on the British formation. The British had {{similarly}} ordered an attack with their destroyers, {{which led to a}} hard-fought battle at close range between the opposing destroyer forces, supported by light cruisers and the battlecruisers' secondary guns. Shortly after 19:00, Regensburg led an attack with several torpedo boats on the cruiser [...] and four destroyers. She disabled the destroyer [...] and then shifted fire to Canterbury, which turned away into the mist. By 20:15, the British and German main fleets had engaged, and Scheer sought a withdrawal; he therefore ordered the I Scouting Group to charge the British line {{while the rest of the}} fleet turned away. This was in turn covered by a massed torpedo boat attack, which forced the British to turn away as well. Regensburg and her torpedo boats were ordered to join the attack, but the I Scouting Group had passed in front of his ships, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> the British had turned away, which put them out of range of his torpedoes.|$|E

2500|$|Both Labor and Liberal {{politicians}} {{who visited the}} United States were highly impressed with the rapidly growing importance of political broadcasts. [...] The 1931 national election {{was the first to}} feature heavy use of political broadcasts. Labor Prime Minister James Scullin was in a difficult contest, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> that radio receivers were now widespread, and the medium was much more effective and much cheaper than stumping in person using long-distance train travel. The New South Wales Labor Party leader Jack Lang emulated President Roosevelt's [...] "fireside chat" [...] format.

2500|$|After the Battle of Hatcher's Run, Lee {{knew his}} army lacked {{the number of}} men needed to {{continue}} extension of his line <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> Grant would continue to press them to do just that.

[...] He told Breckinridge and Lieutenant General James Longstreet that supplies should be collected at Burkeville, Virginia in preparation for the army to move west. Lee wanted to move when local roads became passable as spring rains decreased and before Union reinforcements from Sheridan's cavalry from the Shenandoah Valley, recent new recruits for Grant's force, and possibly even men from Major General William T. Sherman's armies already operating in North Carolina, could arrive at Petersburg.|$|E

2500|$|John Augustus Tulk, who had {{exercised}} {{his right}} to buy half the gardens, was keen {{to build on the}} land and proposed creating a covered market to encompass the square and the buildings he owned around it, but the judgement the Tulks had earlier won against Moxhay proved troublesome because it stipulated that the space must be kept as either a garden or a pleasure garden. Popular feeling was that the gardens should be preserved as an open space, and the bill put before Parliament for the establishment of [...] "Regent Market" [...] was rejected. Tulk attempted to sell his interest in the gardens to a speculator, J. L.

2500|$|In 1922, Georges Friedel {{described}} {{the structure and}} properties of liquid crystals and classified them in 3 types (nematics, smectics and cholesterics).

In 1936, the Marconi Wireless Telegraph company patented the first practical application of the technology, [...] "The Liquid Crystal Light Valve". In 1962, the first major English language publication on the subject [...] "Molecular Structure and Properties of Liquid Crystals", by Dr. George W. Gray. In 1962, Richard Williams of RCA found that liquid crystals had some interesting electro-optic characteristics <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> an electro-optical effect by generating stripe-patterns in {{a thin layer of}} liquid crystal material by the application of a voltage. This effect is based on an electro-hydrodynamic instability forming what are now called [...] "Williams domains" [...] inside the liquid crystal.|$|E
2500|$|Anderson {{started to}} get ideas for Magnolia during the long editing period of Boogie Nights (1997). [...] As he got closer to {{finishing}} the film, he started writing down material for his new project. After the critical and financial success of Boogie Nights, New Line Cinema, who backed that film, told Anderson {{that he could do}} whatever he wanted and the filmmaker realized that, [...] "I was in a position I will never ever be in again". Michael De Luca, then Head of Production at New Line, made the deal for Magnolia, granting Anderson final cut without hearing an idea for the film. Originally, Anderson had wanted to make a film that was [...] "intimate and small-scale", something that he could shoot in 30 days. He had the title of [...] "Magnolia" [...] in his head before he wrote the script. As he started writing, the script [...] "kept blossoming" [...] <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> that there were many actors he wanted to write for and then decided to put [...] "an epic spin on topics that don't necessarily get the epic treatment". He wanted to [...] "make the epic, the all-time great San Fernando Valley movie". Anderson started with lists of images, words and ideas that [...] "start resolving themselves into sequences and shots and dialogue", actors, and music. The first image he had for the film was the smiling face of actress Melora Walters. The next image that came to him was of Philip Baker Hall as her father. Anderson imagined Hall walking up the steps of Walters' apartment and having an intense confrontation with her. Anderson also did research on the magnolia tree and discovered a concept that eating the tree's bark helped cure cancer.|$|E
