5|$|Transmissions {{took place}} {{from a single}} {{arrowhead}} antenna mounted on {{the nose of the}} aircraft. This consisted of <b>a</b> <b>folded</b> dipole with a passive director in front of it, both bent rearward at about 35 degrees, projecting from the nosecone on a mounting rod. For vertical reception, the receiver antennas consisted of two half-wave unipoles mounted above and below the wing, with a reflector behind them. The wing acted as a signal barrier, allowing the antennas to see only the portion of the sky above or below the wing as well as directly in front. These antennas were angled rearward at the same angle as the transmitter. The horizontal receivers and directors were mounted on rods projecting from {{the leading edge of the}} wing, the antennas aligned vertically. The fuselage and engine nacelles formed the barriers for these antennas.|$|E
5|$|SR22 {{begins at}} exit50 on the {{concurrent}} I-82 / US12 as a hybrid diamond–partial cloverleaf interchange The route heads south through farmland towards {{the town of}} Toppenish in Yakima County, which {{is also part of}} the Yakama Indian Reservation. 13.3 mi (1 cm = 8.42 km)|section=G5 - G6}} While in Toppenish, the highway passes over double track belonging to BNSF Railway. On the south end of town, SR22 intersects US97, turning southeast as US97 heads south. Traveling southeast, SR22 passes through more farmland, passing the small census-designated place of Satus and an interchange with SR223. The city of Mabton is located just north of the highway, and is accessible by turning onto SR241. The highway leaves the reservation and turns southwest after passing the Sunnyside Wildlife Recreation Area, and crosses the Yakima–Benton county line, continuing through farmland until approaching the outskirts of Prosser, the county seat of Benton County. SR22 serves as a bypass of Prosser, turning north until intersecting Wine Country Road and the Desert Wind Winery {{on the east side of}} Prosser before turning back southwest on Wine Country Road and terminating at <b>a</b> <b>folded</b> diamond interchange, exit82, on I–82.|$|E

5|$|The turnpike {{continues}} east along I-70 {{and crosses}} Tecumseh Creek. The Topeka Service Area {{is located on}} the north side of the road east of here at mile 188. It is accessed by ramps on the right side of the highway in both directions. Just east of the service area, the turnpike enters Douglas County while passing over US-40 without an interchange. The route then curves to the southeast and runs roughly parallel to US-40. A series of curves takes the turnpike farther east as it reaches Exit 197 (Lecompton), <b>a</b> <b>folded</b> diamond interchange with the western terminus of K-10. After this, the highway continues farther east and enters the city of Lawrence, where it shares a diamond interchange with McDonald Drive at Exit 202 (West Lawrence). McDonald Drive leads to US-59 south of the turnpike. East of here, the highway bends east-northeasterly, crosses the Kansas River, and then intersects US-40 and US-59, which run concurrently, at Exit 204 (East Lawrence).|$|E
5|$|As the {{original}} freeway begins, it passes under an extension to the 1925 Avenue 26 Bridge, {{one of four}} bridges over the Arroyo Seco that predate the parkway's construction. A southbound exit and northbound entrance at Avenue 26 complement the Figueroa Street ramps, and similar ramps connect Pasadena to both directions of I-5. SR 110 continues northeast alongside the Arroyo Seco, passing under the Gold Line light rail and Pasadena Avenue before junctioning Avenue 43 at {{the first of many}} folded diamond interchanges that feature extremely tight (right-in/right-out) curves on the exit and entrance ramps. The next interchange, at Avenue 52, is a normal diamond interchange, and soon after is Via Marisol, where the northbound side has standard diamond ramps, but on the southbound side Avenue 57 acts as <b>a</b> <b>folded</b> diamond connection. The 1926 Avenue 60 Bridge is the second original bridge, and is another folded diamond, with southbound traffic using Shults Street to connect. The 1895 Santa Fe Arroyo Seco Railroad Bridge (now Gold Line) lies just beyond, and after that is a half diamond interchange at Marmion Way/Avenue 64 with access towards Los Angeles only. After the freeway passes under the 1912 York Boulevard Bridge, the pre-parkway bridge, southbound connections between the freeway and cross street can be made via Salonica Street. As the Arroyo Seco curves north to pass west of downtown Pasadena, the Arroyo Seco Parkway instead curves east, crossing the stream into South Pasadena. A single northbound offramp on the Los Angeles side of the bridge curves left under the bridge to Bridewell Street, the parkway's west-side frontage road.|$|E
