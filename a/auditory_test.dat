However, children with symptoms of APD typically have no evidence of neurological disease and the diagnosis is {{made on the basis of}} performance on behavioral auditory tests. Auditory processing is [...] "what we do with what we hear", and in APD there is a mismatch between peripheral hearing ability (which is typically normal) and ability to interpret or discriminate sounds. Thus in those with no signs of neurological impairment, APD is diagnosed on the basis of auditory tests. There is, however, no consensus as to which tests should be used for diagnosis, as evidenced by the succession of task force reports that have appeared in recent years. The first of these occurred in 1996. This was followed by a conference organized by the American Academy of Audiology. Experts attempting to define diagnostic criteria have to grapple with the problem that a child may do poorly on an <b>auditory</b> <b>test</b> for reasons other than poor auditory perception: for instance, failure could be due to inattention, difficulty in coping with task demands, or limited language ability. In an attempt to rule out at least some of these factors, the American Academy of Audiology conference explicitly advocated that for APD to be diagnosed, the child must have a modality-specific problem, i.e. affecting auditory but not visual processing. However, an ASHA committee subsequently rejected modality-specificity as a defining characteristic of auditory processing disorders.|$|E

2500|$|The {{issue of}} modality-specificity {{has led to}} {{considerable}} debate among experts in this field. [...] Cacace and McFarland have argued that APD should {{be defined as a}} modality-specific perceptual dysfunction that is not due to peripheral hearing loss. They criticise more inclusive conceptualizations of APD as lacking diagnostic specificity. A requirement for modality-specificity could potentially avoid including children whose poor auditory performance is due to general factors such as poor attention or memory. Others, however, have argued that a modality-specific approach is too narrow, and that it would miss children who had genuine perceptual problems affecting both visual and auditory processing. It is also impractical, as audiologists {{do not have access to}} standardized tests that are visual analogs of <b>auditory</b> <b>tests.</b> The debate over this issue remains unresolved. It is clear, however, that a modality-specific approach will diagnose fewer children with APD than a modality-general one, and that the latter approach runs a risk of including children who fail <b>auditory</b> <b>tests</b> for reasons other than poor auditory processing. Although modality-specific testing has been advocated for well over a decade, to date no tests have been published which would allow audiologists to perform a modality-specific evaluation (i.e., no clinical versions of visual analogs to <b>auditory</b> processing <b>tests</b> exist).|$|R

The present study investigated hearing-impaired children's ability to discriminate Persian vowels. It aimed to describe {{the extent to which}} children have difficulty comprehending and discriminating phonetic features of vowels. Methods: To fulfill this aim, a researcher-made test, which was based on the Auditory Perception Test 2001, investigated the phonetic discrimination of vowels in Persian-speaking and hearing-impaired children aged five to eight years. The test has two sections, auditory-visual and just auditory discrimination of vowels, which included five subtests assessing discrimination of front and back vowels. Through this test, the phonetic discrimination ability of 22 hearing-impaired children was evaluated. The gathered data were analyzed using matched t-test and repeated measures ANOVA. Results: The findings showed that there is a significant difference between correct responses to the sections on front and back vowels (p< 0. 05). The audio-visual test showed that the /â/ vowel is easier to discriminate than other back vowels. Moreover, in the <b>auditory</b> <b>test</b> the /â/ vowel had the highest mean. The audio-visual test showed that the /i/ vowel is easier to discriminate than the other front vowels (/e/ /æ/).
