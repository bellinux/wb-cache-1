The case was not brought before a court because a transaction settlement was reached between Eurlings and the Dutch public prosecution service, but details about the transaction have not been officially released. The transaction formally constituted an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>persecution</b> and hence Eurlings now has a criminal record.|$|R
2500|$|In March 2000 John PaulII visited Yad Vashem, the {{national}} Holocaust memorial in Israel, and later made history by touching {{one of the}} holiest sites in Judaism, the Western Wall in Jerusalem, placing a letter inside it (in which he prayed for forgiveness for the actions against Jews). In part of his address he said: [...] "I assure the Jewish people the Catholic Church … is deeply saddened by the hatred, <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>persecution</b> and displays of anti-Semitism directed against the Jews by Christians {{at any time and}} in any place," [...] he added that there were [...] "no words strong enough to deplore the terrible tragedy of the Holocaust."

60|$|The party I {{speak of}} (like some amongst us who would disparage {{the best friends}} of their country) {{resolved}} to make the king either violate his principles of toleration or incur the odium of protecting Papists. They therefore brought in this bill, and made it purposely wicked and absurd {{that it might be}} rejected. The then court party, discovering their game, turned the tables on them, and returned their bill to them stuffed with still greater absurdities, that its loss might lie upon its original authors. They, finding their own ball thrown back to them, kicked it back again to their adversaries. And thus this act, loaded with the double injustice of two parties, neither of whom intended to pass what they hoped the other would be persuaded to reject, went through the legislature, contrary to the real wish of all parts of it, and of all the parties that composed it. In this manner these insolent and profligate factions, as if they were playing with balls and counters, made a sport of the fortunes and the liberties of their fellow-creatures. Other <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>persecution</b> have been acts of malice. This was a subversion of justice from wantonness and petulance. Look into the history of Bishop Burnet. He is a witness without exception.|$|E

Mr Moxon claimed that it would be an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>persecution</b> to dismiss the chief steward without an inquiry being held into the allegations against him. However, the firemen were unmoved. At the request of Senator Guthrie, the general secretary of the Firemen and Seamens Union in Melbourne, Mr Moxon then broke off the negotiations. Meanwhile, Senator Guthrie arranged for a fresh crew of 16 men, accompanied by two executive officers, to travel from Melbourne to Adelaide by express train, and from Adelaide to Fremantle by steamer.|$|R

She further advised that it was for the German court to decide whether the punishment that Mr. Shepherd would face if convicted of desertion in the U.S. would count as an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>persecution.</b> She also advised that the German court would need to determine whether there was a reasonable likelihood of Shepherd being involved in war crimes, if he were deployed to a conflict zone, without needing to establish that fact beyond reasonable doubt.|$|R

2500|$|The {{origin of}} haftarah reading is lost to history, and several {{theories}} {{have been proposed}} to explain its role in Jewish practice, suggesting it arose {{in response to the}} <b>persecution</b> <b>of</b> the Jews under Antiochus Epiphanes which preceded the Maccabean revolt, wherein Torah reading was prohibited, or that it was [...] "instituted against the Samaritans, who denied the canonicity of the Prophets (except for Joshua), and later against the Sadducees." [...] Another theory is that it was instituted after some <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>persecution</b> or other disaster in which the synagogue Torah scrolls were destroyed or ruined - it was forbidden to read the Torah portion from any but a ritually fit parchment scroll, but there was no such requirement about a reading from Prophets, which was then [...] "substituted as a temporary expedient and then remained." [...] The Talmud mentions that a haftarah was read in the presence of Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus, who lived c.70 CE, and that by the time of Rabbah (the 3rd century) there was a [...] "Scroll of Haftarot", which is not further described, and in the Christian New Testament several references suggest this Jewish custom was in place during that era.|$|R

5000|$|During the {{military}} regimes in Argentina, and {{especially during the}} dictatorship known as the Proceso de Reorganización Nacional, serious <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> anti-Semitic <b>persecution</b> occurred.

In the secret detention centers it was common practice to burn the Star of David onto the bodies of Jewish prisoners. Ramon Camps, the Chief of Police in Buenos Aires, who allegedly kidnapped and tortured Jacobo Timerman, claimed that Zionists were enemies of Argentina and had a plan to destroy the country.

Modern scholarship on the other hand is not as clear as to the motivations of the emperor, i.e. whether the death of Stephen, the execution of the nineteen officials and other <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>persecution</b> was due to his hardening stance against iconophile sentiment, or had political motives as a reaction to plots against his life (in which Stephen too may have been implicated).|$|E

5000|$|Claudia Setzer draws a {{distinction}} between Jews and Christians (both Jewish and Gentile) as to when the perception of Christianity as a Jewish sect was replaced by an understanding of Christianity as a new and separate religion.

5000|$|In {{the history}} of the Roman Empire, the [...] "Little Peace of the Church" [...] was a roughly 40-year period in the latter 3rd century when Christianity flourished without {{official}} suppression from the central government. It is particularly associated with the reign of Gallienus (253-268), who issued the first official declaration of tolerance regarding Christians. Among the series of imperial edicts that halted <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>persecution</b> against Christians, one addressed to the bishops of Egypt has survived, recognizing places of worship and cemeteries as ecclesiastical property and restoring them to Christian ownership. The Church for the first time even asked a Roman emperor to arbitrate an internal dispute. In 272, after Paul of Samosata was accused of heresy but refused to be deposed as bishop of Antioch, Aurelian ruled in favor of his successor, who was in good standing with the church hierarchy.|$|E
