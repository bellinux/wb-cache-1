25|$|According to Abel, Mittleman, and Becker (1985) and Ward et al. (1995), {{there are}} {{generally}} large {{distinctions between the}} characteristics of pedophilic and non-pedophilic molesters. They state that non-pedophilic offenders tend to offend at times of stress; have a later onset of offending; and have fewer, often familial, victims, while pedophilic offenders often start offending at an early age; often have {{a larger number of}} victims who are frequently extrafamilial; are more inwardly driven to offend; and have values or beliefs that strongly support an offense lifestyle. One study found that pedophilic molesters had a median of 1.3 victims for those with girl victims and 4.4 for those with boy victims. Child molesters, pedophilic or not, employ a variety of methods to gain sexual access to children. Some groom their victims into compliance with attention and gifts, while others use threats, <b>alcohol</b> <b>or</b> <b>drugs,</b> or physical force.|$|E

He was particularly strict on the separation of sexes in temples.

[...] Alcohol consumption was forbidden by him even for medicinal purposes. [...] Many of {{his followers to}}ok vows before becoming his disciple. He stated that four elements need to be conquered for ultimate salvation: dharma, bhakti (devotion), gnana (knowledge) and vairagya (detachment). Doctrinally, Swaminarayan was close to eleventh century philosopher Ramanuja and was critical of Shankaracharya's concept of advaita, or monistic non-dualism. Swaminarayan's ontology maintained that the supreme being is not formless and that God always has a divine form.|$|E

[...] Amnesty International has also raised extensive concerns about the use of other electro-shock devices by American police and in American prisons, as they can be (and according to Amnesty International, sometimes are) used to inflict cruel pain on individuals. For example, Eric Hammock of Texas died in April 2005 after receiving more than 20 Taser shocks by Fort Worth police officers. Maurice Cunningham of South Carolina, while an inmate at the Lancaster County Detention Center, was subjected to continuous shock for 2 minutes 49 seconds, which a medical examiner said caused cardiac arrhythmia and his subsequent death.

Aims: Conduct a feasibility study, testing whether a intervention successful in the UK, aimed at helping family members {{of people with}} <b>alcohol</b> <b>or</b> <b>drug</b> problems (the 5 -Step Intervention), would also be applicable in Italy. Method: Feasibility study. Results: It is feasible to deliver this intervention in Italy.
