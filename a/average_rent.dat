5|$|Park Lane is {{the second}} most {{valuable}} property in the London edition of the board game Monopoly. The street had a prestigious social status when the British version of the Monopoly board was first produced, in 1936. On the board, Park Lane forms a pair with Mayfair, the most expensive property in the game. The squares were designed to be equivalents of Park Place and Boardwalk, respectively, on the original board, which used streets in Atlantic City, New Jersey. In 1988, the World Monopoly Championships were held at the Park Lane Hotel, sponsored by Waddingtons, manufacturers of the British version. Since the game's original production, prices on the real Park Lane have held their value, though <b>average</b> <b>rent</b> costs have been overtaken by Bond Street.|$|E

As {{well as for}} medicinal purposes, salts were {{extracted from}} the waters; and used by local calicoprinters to fix their dyes. By the mid-eighteenth century, many houses in Shadwell had been rebuilt.

In 1767, London coal workers who were protesting for higher wages began shooting at the landlord of the Roundabout Tavern in Shadwell; as a result, seven of them were hanged in the Sun Tavern fields. Their execution was witnessed by around 50,000 spectators, the largest crowd at a hanging since the hanging of Laurence Shirley, 4th Earl Ferrers in 1760. in 1794, many houses on the Ratcliffe Highway were destroyed by a fire which [...] "consumed more houses than any one conflagration has done since the Great Fire of London", and also destroyed many boats, and around £40,000 of sugar.|$|E
2500|$|Fixed {{prices on}} goods were rare {{during the first}} Empire; almost every product or service was subject to bargaining. However, bread prices were set by the government, {{and the price of}} a loaf of four pounds ranged between fifty and ninety centimes during the Empire. A {{kilogram}} of beef, depending on quality, cost between 95 and 115 centimes; a liter of ordinary wine from Macon, between 68-71 centimes. A pair of silk stockings for a woman cost 10 francs, a pair of a man's leather shoes cost 11 to 14 francs. The Emperor's famous hats, purchased at the hat maker Poupard, cost sixty francs each. A bath in a bath-house cost 1.25 francs, a haircut for a woman 1.10 francs, a consultation with a doctor cost 3-4 francs. The price of room for two persons on the third floor in the low-income Saint-Jacques neighborhood was 36 francs a year. The <b>average</b> <b>rent</b> of modest-income Parisians was about 69 francs a year; the wealthiest one-eighth of Parisians paid rents of more than 150 francs a year; in 1805 the sculptor Moitte, with a household of seven persons, paid annual rent of 1500 francs for an apartment with a grand salon and bedroom overlooking the Seine, two other bedrooms, dining room, bathroom, kitchen, and cave, in the Faubourg Saint-Germain.|$|E
2500|$|The zamindari {{system was}} one of two {{principal}} revenue settlements undertaken by the Company in India. In southern India, Thomas Munro, who would later become Governor of Madras, promoted the ryotwari system or the Munro system, in which the government settled land-revenue directly with the peasant farmers, or ryots. It was first tried in small scale by Captain Alexander Read in the areas that were taken over from the wars with Tipu Sultan. Subsequently, developed by Thomas Munro, this system was gradually extended all over South India. This was, in part, a consequence of the turmoil of the Anglo-Mysore Wars, which had prevented the emergence of a class of large landowners; in addition, Munro and others felt that ryotwari was closer to traditional practice in the region and ideologically more progressive, allowing the benefits of Company rule to reach the lowest levels of rural society. At the heart of the ryotwari system was a particular theory of economic rent—and based on David Ricardo's Law of Rent—promoted by utilitarian James Mill who formulated the Indian revenue policy between 1819 and 1830. [...] "He believed that the government was the ultimate lord of the soil and should not renounce its right to 'rent', i.e. the profit left over on richer soil when wages and other working expenses had been settled." [...] Another keystone of the new system of temporary settlements was the classification of agricultural fields according to soil type and produce, with <b>average</b> <b>rent</b> rates fixed for the period of the settlement. According to Mill, taxation of land rent would promote efficient agriculture and simultaneously prevent the emergence of a [...] "parasitic landlord class." [...] Mill advocated ryotwari settlements which consisted of government measurement and assessment of each plot (valid for 20 or 30 years) and subsequent taxation which was dependent on the fertility of the soil. The taxed amount was nine-tenths of the [...] "rent" [...] in the early 19th century and gradually fell afterwards. However, in spite of the appeal of the ryotwari system's abstract principles, class hierarchies in southern Indian villages had not entirely disappeared—for example village headmen continued to hold sway—and peasant cultivators sometimes came to experience revenue demands they could not meet. In the 1850s, a scandal erupted when it was discovered that some Indian revenue agents of the Company were using torture to meet the Company's revenue demands.|$|E

40|$|This article aims {{to present}} the {{application}} of Homogeneity analysis {{as an alternative to}} the analysis of qualitative data. Homogeneity analysis is a multivariate technique that has two basic purposes: dimensionality reduction and structural analysis. The work examined actual values of <b>average</b> <b>rents</b> for residential sites in 24 districts of the city of Rio de Janeiro in December 2010 for living room and bedroom, living room and two bedrooms and living room and three bedrooms. The study aimed at the grouping of localities due to similarity in their <b>average</b> <b>rents.</b> As the result of the analysis, we identified 3 homogeneous groups, coexisting in the same space. Profile 1 is formed by neighborhoods with rents in lower ranges. Most of the neighborhoods in this profile are on the westside and northside. Profile 2 is formedby neighborhoods with rents in the intermediate ranges. They include the south zone and Barra. Profile 3 is formedby neighborhoods with rents in higher ranges. They include only neighborhoods in the South side. These results are important to highlight the importance of Homogeneity analysis as to decisions by real estate administrators...|$|R
