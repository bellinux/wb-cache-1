The Wagga Wagga <b>Advertiser</b> is still published today as The Daily <b>Advertiser</b> and commenced in 1868. Until the 1860s most goods were transported to markets by bullock wagon. For a short time, the arrival of faster, cheaper and more reliable riverboats allowed goods to be transported more easily to export markets.

Although there were eight attempts to force a new Licensing Act through Parliament between 1697 and 1713, none of them succeeded. Despite {{the freedom of the}} press from censorship by the government, the judiciary held a different view; it regularly tried people for seditious libel if they printed material attacking the government. From 21 November 1768, letters written by a man under the pseudonym of Junius were published in the Public <b>Advertiser,</b> a London newspaper run by Henry Sampson Woodfall. In them, Junius attacked many political leaders, including Lord Granby and Mansfield.

40|$|Websites {{increasingly}} allow <b>advertisers</b> {{to choose}} whether {{to bid for}} advertising on a per-impression or per-click basis. We present the first analysis of this new hybrid auction market. The conventional wisdom in this industry is that brand <b>advertisers</b> (e. g., Coca-Cola) will bid for impressions, while direct response <b>advertisers</b> (e. g., Amazon. com) will bid for clicks. We find that in an auction setting {{similar to that used}} by Facebook and Google, brand <b>advertisers</b> may have an incentive to bid for clicks, while simultaneously lowering their click through rates. We suggest a variant on the current hybrid auction used in practice to incent brand <b>advertisers</b> to bid for impressions, which leaves the seller of online advertising weakly better off.

5000|$|Targeting {{in online}} {{advertising}} is when <b>advertisers</b> use {{a series of}} methods in order to showcase a particular advertisement to a specific group of people. <b>Advertisers</b> use these techniques {{in order to find}} distinct individuals that would be most interested in their product or service. With the social media practices of today, advertising has become a very profitable industry. [...] People are constantly exposed to advertisements and their content, which is key to its success. In the past, <b>advertisers</b> had tried to build brand names with television and magazines; however, <b>advertisers</b> have been using audience targeting as a new form of medium. The rise of internet users and its wide availability has made this possible for <b>advertisers.</b> Targeting specific audiences has allowed for <b>advertisers</b> to constantly change the content of the advertisements to fit the needs and interests of the individual viewer. The content of different advertisements are presented to each consumer to fit their individual needs.|$|R

50|$|CPC (Cost Per Click) or PPC (Pay per click) means <b>advertisers</b> pay {{each time}} a user clicks on the ad. CPC {{advertising}} works well when <b>advertisers</b> want visitors to their sites, but it's a less accurate measurement for <b>advertisers</b> looking to build brand awareness.

50|$|<b>Advertisers</b> will {{separate}} the market into different age group categories because consumers of similar ages {{will have the}} similar interests, wants and needs. Therefore, when <b>advertisers</b> divide up the market by age categories {{they will be able}} to target the group or groups that will be most interested in their product and communicate directly to them. This allows the <b>advertisers</b> to find the most appropriate way to communicate with each group. As different age groups respond to various methods of communication differently. Over time consumers will mature and their wants and needs will change. this means that <b>advertisers</b> either have to change how they communicate with their current target market. Therefore, dividing the market into age groups allows for <b>advertisers</b> to target the age range that will find their product the most appealing.|$|R
