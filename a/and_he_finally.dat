5|$|The many negative, untruthful stories bothered Earp a great deal, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>finally</b> {{decided to}} tell his own story. Earp also tried to track J.M. Scanland, {{the author of the}} LA Times article, and extract a written {{retraction}} from him, which he finally did in 1927.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{was carried}} back to Chinon on a litter, {{where he was}} {{informed}} that John had publicly sided with Richard in the conflict. This desertion proved the final shock <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>finally</b> collapsed into a fever, only coming to {{for a few moments}} during which he gave confession. Henry died on 6 July 1189, aged 56; the King had wished to be interred at Grandmont Abbey in the Limousin, but the hot weather made transporting his body impractical and he was instead buried at the nearby Fontevraud Abbey.|$|E
5|$|At a Jewish synagogue, where Grace and Leo's {{wedding is}} to take place, Grace learns from her mother, Bobbi (Debbie Reynolds), that her father {{will not be able}} to walk her down the aisle. Grace panics, but Karen {{suggests}} that Will should walk with her instead. She agrees and calls upon him. Although Will at first declines to give her away because of the prior argument, they make up <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>finally</b> escorts her down the aisle. After the wedding reception, Will, Grace, Leo, Jack, and Karen walk through Central Park enjoying Grace and Leo's marriage.|$|E

5|$|Escoffier also {{simplified}} {{and organized}} the modern menu {{and structure of}} the meal. He published a series of articles in professional journals which outlined the sequence, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>finally</b> published his Livre des menus in 1912. This type of service embraced the service à la russe (serving meals in separate courses on individual plates), which Félix Urbain Dubois had made popular in the 1860s. Escoffier's largest contribution was the publication of Le Guide Culinaire in 1903, which established the fundamentals of French cookery. The book was a collaboration with Philéas Gilbert, E. Fetu, A. Suzanne, B. Reboul, Ch. Dietrich, A. Caillat and others. The significance of this is to illustrate the universal acceptance by multiple high-profile chefs to this new style of cooking.|$|E
5|$|Grimsby's ageing {{team made}} a bright start in 1952–53 with five {{straight}} wins but eventually slipped and finished in fifth place. In 1953–54, Shankly became disillusioned when the board {{could not give}} him money to buy new players. He was reluctant to promote some promising reserves because of loyalty to the older players (a fault that was to resurface at Liverpool years later) <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>finally</b> resigned in January 1954, citing the board's lack of ambition as his main reason. In his autobiography, {{he said that he}} and his wife were feeling homesick in Grimsby and, when an opportunity came to manage Workington, he was attracted to the challenge partly because they would be closer to Scotland.|$|E
5|$|More than 800,000 Varkaris {{travel to}} Pandharpur for the yatra on Shayani Ekadashi, the 11th {{day of the}} waxing moon in the lunar month of Ashadha. Both Shayani Ekadashi and Prabodhini Ekadashi (in the waxing half of Kartik), are {{associated}} with the mythology of Vishnu. Hindus believe that Vishnu falls asleep in Ksheersagar (a cosmic ocean of milk), while lying on the back of Shesha-nāga (the cosmic serpent). His sleep begins on Shayani Ekadashi (literally the 'sleeping 11th') <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>finally</b> awakens from his slumber, four months later, on Prabodhini Ekadashi. The celebrations in Ashadha and Kartik continue until the full-moon in those months, concluding with torchlight processions. Inscriptions dating to the 11thcentury mention the Ekadashi pilgrimages to Pandharpur. On Shayani Ekadashi and Prabodini Ekadashi, the chief minister or a minister of Maharashtra state performs ritual components of worship on behalf of the Government of Maharashtra. This form of worship is known as sarkari-mahapuja.|$|E

Meanwhile, Plankton finally finds the perfect opportunity to steal the Krabby Patty secret formula. He fails, having been caught by Mr. Krabs. The eleventy-seventh anniversary celebration then goes ahead.|$|E
5|$|Davis {{completed}} A Short History of the Confederate States of America in October 1889. On November 6, he left Beauvoir {{to visit}} his plantation at Brierfield. While in New Orleans, he {{was caught in a}} sleety rain, and on the steamboat trip upriver, he had a severe cold; on November 13 he left Brierfield to return to New Orleans. Varina Davis, who had taken another boat to Brierfield, met him on the river, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>finally</b> received some medical care; two doctors came aboard further south and found he had acute bronchitis complicated by malaria. They arrived in New Orleans three days later, and he was taken to the home of Charles Erasmus Fenner, an Associate Justice of the Louisiana Supreme Court. Davis remained in bed but was stable for the next two weeks; however, he took {{a turn for the worse}} in early December. Just when he appeared to be improving, he lost consciousness on the evening of December 5 and died at 12:45a.m. on Friday, December 6, 1889, in the presence of several friends and with his hand in Varina's.|$|E

Naz and Asher {{end up having}} sex, but he abandons her afterwards and Sol finds her and apologises. They reconcile but she feels guilty. The next day they wake up after spending {{the night in the}} same bed, and Naz later watches Sol at dance rehearsals. Asher returns a necklace to Naz, and Sol sees this. He confronts her about it and she reveals she had a one-night stand with Asher but it meant nothing to her. She insists she did not receive Sol's text message but he is still angry. In an attempt to get Naz and Sol to reconcile again, Stevie pretends to swallow the key to the flat's front door, leaving them trapped. Naz reveals she is going to Turkey to meet Ekin's family and Sol angrily says she can stay there. When left alone, they get close again, but Asher interrupts them when he returns. Stevie drops the key revealing she did not swallow it and Sol thinks Naz was in on the plan so he sarcastically tells her to enjoy Turkey before leaving. She returns home and prepares to leave for Turkey but her father discovers she has escaped through a window. She returns to the flat but her father and Ekin come after her and try to take her back home. Sol stops the car and Naz gets out and they kiss.

While his car was left undriveable, Fox emerged with only a sore right knee. He again felt pain in December, but chose to ignore it until the end of {{basketball}} season. By March 1977, the pain had intensified <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>finally</b> went to a hospital, where he was diagnosed with osteosarcoma, a form of cancer that often starts near the knees. Fox believed his car accident weakened his knee and left it vulnerable to the disease, though his doctors argued there was no connection. He was told that his leg had to be amputated, he would require chemotherapy treatment, and that recent medical advances meant he had a 50-percent chance of survival. Fox learned that two years before, the figure would have been only 15 percent; the improvement in survival rates impressed on him the value of cancer research.|$|E

Targhi could not penetrate the fortifications of the Siri Fort <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>finally</b> retreated to his Kingdom in Central Asia.

McCarthy himself would not face the drop though as he moved to Celtic in May 1987.|$|E

25|$|On July 23, 1988, Rick Gibson ate {{the flesh}} of another person in public.
