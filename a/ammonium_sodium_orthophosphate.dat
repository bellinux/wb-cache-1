40|$|BACKGROUND: Persulfate salts {{have been}} {{associated}} with both allergic contact dermatitis and bronchial asthma. Because there is currently no experimental data available on the sensitizing properties of persulfate salts (<b>ammonium,</b> <b>sodium,</b> and potassium persulfates), we determined their dermal sensitizing capacity, using the murine local lymph node assay (LLNA). MATERIAL AND METHODS: For three consecutive days, BALB/c mice were dermally treated with <b>ammonium,</b> <b>sodium,</b> or potassium persulfate or with the vehicle alone (dimethyl sulfoxide) on each ear (2 x 25 microl). On D 6, mice were injected intravenously with [(3) H]-methyl thymidine. The draining auricular lymph nodes were removed, and the incorporation of [(3) H]-methyl thymidine was compared with that of vehicle-treated control mice. A stimulation index (SI) relative to the vehicle-treated control value was derived. The sensitizing potency of the chemicals tested was determined by estimating the concentration of chemical required to induce a SI of 3 (EC 3). RESULTS: All three chemicals provoked positive responses in the LLNA, with dose-dependent increases in proliferation. Maximal SIs recorded were 6. 8 +/- 1. 8, 6. 5 +/- 1. 2, and 5 +/- 1. 0 at 5 % for <b>ammonium,</b> <b>sodium</b> or potassium persulfate, respectively. The EC 3 values were 1. 9 %, 0. 9 %, and 2. 4 % for <b>ammonium,</b> <b>sodium,</b> and potassium persulfates, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: All three persulfate salts need to be considered strong-to-moderate sensitizers according to the murine LLNA. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The {{tribological}} {{behaviors of}} {{three types of}} sodium phosphates (sodium ortho-, pyro-, and metaphosphate) with different chain lengths are evaluated using the ball-on-disk tribometer at 800 °C. The tribological results show that all three sodium phosphates can reduce friction by approximately 45 − 65 % and wear rate by 80 − 90 %, and, among these, shorter-chainlength phosphate shows a lower friction and wear. XPS spectra indicate a phosphate glassy film consisting of Na, Fe, P, and O elements formed on the tribostressed area. The tribochemistry of tribosurface investigated by XPS and XANES reveals that NaPO 3 and Na 4 P 2 O 7 react with oxide wear debris to produce mixed short-chain Na/Fe polyphosphate in the tribostressed area, leading to a severe depolymerization for NaPO 3 and a slight polymerization for Na 4 P 2 O 7.
