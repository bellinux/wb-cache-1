The effect of immunoproteasome expression in APCs and in peripheral cells on CD 8 + T-cell self-tolerance was evaluated. Splenocytes (SP) {{were used as}} a source of APCs and CD 8 + T-cells. Renal epithelial cells (RC) from the same mouse strain were used as peripheral cells. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used for increasing immunoproteasome expression, whereas transduction with lentiviral particles encoding short-hairpin RNA targeting LMP 7 (LnLMP 7) were used for decreasing the expression of the LMP 7 subunit of the immunoproteasome in SP and/or RC. LMP 7 expression was tested with Western blotting, while the cytotoxicity of isolated CD 8 + T-cells against RC with LDH release assay. LPS increased LMP 7 expression in SP, while did not affect its expression in RC. LnLMP 7 decreased LMP 7 expression in both LPS-treated and untreated SP and RC. CD 8 + T-cell <b>auto-reactivity</b> increased in case of LPS-treated APCs, further enhanced in the event of both APCs and RC treated with LPS. Transduction of APCs or RC with LnLMP 7 decreased CD 8 + T-cell <b>auto-reactivity,</b> which was further decreased in case of concurrent transduction of both APCs and RC.

The human heart {{is of particular interest}} for regenerative medicine, as cardiac tissue damage is repaired by the formation of rigid scar tissue, which causes inevitable structural changes and progressive functional decline leading to heart failure. Cardiac regenerative medicine aims to prevent scar formation or replace existing scars to halt or reverse adverse remodeling and therapeutic approaches include the use of biomaterials, gene therapies, delivery of growth factors and (stem) cell therapies. Regenerative therapies, however, face significant obstacles in a hostile microenvironment.

The broad B cell <b>auto-reactivity</b> {{is known to be}} predominately T cell-dependent, but the mechanism underlying such a systemic loss of self tolerance has yet to be fully understood. Regulatory T cells (Treg) play important roles in the maintenance of peripheral tolerance.

Aberrant Treg frequencies and functions have recently been demonstrated both in lupus patients and in the animal models which develop spontaneously a lupus-like disease. These findings provided potentially therefore a plausible explanation for the systemic nature of the disease.

A cohort of 16 people with multiple sclerosis were studied for one year following a single pulse of Campath- 1 H treatment. In addition to reporting on their clinical course, serial detailed immunological investigations were performed focusing on immunoregulation and homeostasis. Two phases of lymphocyte reconstitution following Campath- 1 H treatment were observed. In {{the first six months}} lymphocyte proliferation increased and the residual T cell pool was dominated by memory T cells, especially regulatory T cells. In the later phase these changes reversed. The relative fall in regulatory T cell numbers coincided with a period of susceptibility to novel autoimmunity offering a mechanism by which proliferating auto-reactive T cells might escape control. Total CD 4 + numbers remained below 50 % of pre-treatment levels at twelve months despite a sustained increase in IL- 7. However CCL 21 and Il- 15 responses to lymphopaenia appear to be suboptimal explaining the delayed lymphocyte reconstitution. Auto-reactive lymphocytes exist in the normal T Cell repertoire.

During the same period, numerous tissues, such as adipose tissue, placenta, or umbilical cord, have been used as alternative sources of MSC in comparison with bone marrow. In particular, considering the accessibility and ease to harvest fat tissue, adipose-derived MSC have gained interest above bone marrow-derived MSC. More recently, the discovery of MSC immunomodulatory properties made MSC-based therapy progressively slip from the field of regenerative medicine to the one of autoimmunity. Indeed, in this group of disorders caused by aberrant activation of the immune system resulting in loss of self-tolerance and <b>auto-reactivity,</b> conventional immunosuppressant may be harmful.

Previously, we demonstrated that, during the development of T 1 D in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, a set of immune/inflammatory reactivity genes were differentially expressed in T lymphocytes. However, the posttranscriptional control involving miRNA interactions that occur during the evolution of thymocytes into PILs remains unknown. In this study, we postulated that miRNAs are differentially expressed during this period and that these miRNAs can interact with mRNAs involved in <b>auto-reactivity</b> during the progression of insulitis. To test this hypothesis, we used NOD mice to perform, for the first time, a comprehensive survey of miRNA and mRNA expression as thymocytes mature into peripheral CD 3 + T lymphocytes and, subsequently, into PILs.

Little or no ANA development was observed in DBA/ 2 or BALB/c strains when syngeneic or nonautoimmune allogeneic marrow was grafted, or when NZB marrow was injected into untreated DBA mice or mice receiving 200 rads of x-irradiation. Transfer of 5 × 106 spleen cells from 8 -day-old NZB mice into lethally irradiated BALB/c mice effected substantial ANA formation by the ninth day after transfer, compared to a 20 -day latency following transfer of {{the same number of}} bone marrow cells. This earlier conversion with splenocytes may have been due to the presence of immunocompetent T and B cells, since stem cell numbers of the two tissues were similar. Transplantation of NZB marrow to lethally irradiated H- 2 incompatible SJL/J (H- 2 s) and C 57 B 1 / 6 (H- 2 b) strains brought about less ANA conversion than the transfer of compatible (SJL × NZB) F 1 and (C 57 B 1 × NZB) F 1 marrow cells to the respective nonautoimmune SJL or C 57 B 1 parental strain. Graft-versus-host reactions thus did not appear to play a requisite or determining role in the autoimmune development observed following grafting of NZB hemopoietic tissues.

The developmental pathway of 10 E 8 might therefore serve as a promising template for vaccine design, but samples from time-of-infection-often used to infer the B cell record-are unavailable. In this study, we used crystallography, next-generation sequencing (NGS), and functional assessments to infer the 10 E 8 developmental pathway from a single time point. Mutational analysis indicated somatic hypermutation of the 2 nd-heavy chain-complementarity determining region (CDR H 2) to be critical for neutralization, and structures of 10 E 8 variants with V-gene regions reverted to genomic origin for heavy-and-light chains or heavy chain-only showed structural differences > 2 Å relative to mature 10 E 8 in the CDR H 2 and H 3. To understand these developmental changes, we used bioinformatic sieving, maximum likelihood, and parsimony analyses of immunoglobulin transcripts to identify 10 E 8 -lineage members, to infer the 10 E 8 -unmutated common ancestor (UCA), and to calculate 10 E 8 -developmental intermediates. We were assisted in this analysis by the preservation of a critical D-gene segment, which was unmutated in most 10 E 8 -lineage sequences. UCA and early intermediates weakly bound a 26 -residue-MPER peptide, whereas HIV- 1 neutralization and epitope recognition in liposomes were only observed with late intermediates.

Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that small molecules derived from the microbial riboflavin biosynthetic pathway (vitamin B 2) bind monomorphic MR 1 molecules and activate mucosal associated invariant T cells (MAIT), another population of semi-invariant T cells. Novel insights in the biological relevance of non-peptide specific T cells have emerged with the development of tetrameric CD 1 and MR 1 molecules, which has allowed accurate enumeration and functional analysis of CD 1 - and MR 1 -restricted T cells in humans and discovery of novel populations of semi-invariant T cells.

Concurrent modulation of CD 1 transcription and lipid biosynthetic pathways upon TLR stimulation, coupled with efficient lipid antigen processing result in the increased cell surface expression of antigenic CD 1 -lipid complexes. Similarly, MR 1 expression is almost undetectable in resting APC and it is up-regulated following bacterial infection, likely due to stabilization of MR 1 molecules by microbial antigens.

It was found that the extent of cross-reaction of a given myoglobin was not dependent on the species in which the antisera were raised. This indicated that the antibody response to sperm-whale myoglobin (i. e. its antigenic structure) is independent of the species in which the antisera are raised and is not directed to regions of sequence differences between the injected myoglobin and the myoglobin of the immunized host. Indeed, in each antiserum from a given species examined, that antiserum reacted with the myoglobin of that species. The extent of this <b>auto-reactivity</b> for a given myoglobin was comparable with the general extent of cross-reactivity shown by that myoglobin with antisera raised in other species. The cross-reactivities and auto-reactivities (both of which are of similar extents for a given myoglobin) can be reasonably rationalized in terms of the effects of amino acid substitutions within the antigenic sites and within the residues close to these sites. These findings confirm that the antigenicity of the sites is inherent in their three-dimensional locations...|$|E
40|$|Immunoglobin-A and the {{pathogenesis}} of schistosomal glomerulopathy. Several observations suggest that the evolution of schistosomal glomerulopathy into clinically overt and progressive disease may involve pathogenetic mechanisms other than simple glomerular deposition of parasitic antigens. In a previous study, IgA was suggested tobe a mediator of late glomerular lesions in this disease. This issue is further addressed in this work. The study includes 32 patients with hepatosplenic schistosomiasis, of whom 16 had overt glomerular involvement, along with four control groups: (a) 15 healthy volunteers; (b) 15 patients with simple intestinal mansoniasis; (c) 17 patients with non-schistosomal chronic liver disease; and (d) 21 subjects with primary nephrotic syndrome not associated with schistosomiasis. Routine assessment was done for all subjects including confirmatory tests for schistosomal infection, liver and renal function tests, hepatitis viral markers and abdominal ultrasonography. The total serum concentrations of IgG, IgM, IgA were measured, as well astheir respective circulating immune complexes, rheumatoid factors, anti-gliadin- and anti-DNA-antibodies. Liver and renal biopsies {{were obtained from the}} relevant groups and studied by light microscopy. Renal biopsies were also examined by immunofluorescence. Patients with simple intestinal schistosomiasis had a significant increase in IgM antigliadin antibodies. Those complicated with hepatosplenic involvement also had {{a significant increase in the}} mean IgG anti-gliadin antibodies, IgG rheumatoid factor and IgM anti-DNA activity. Cases further complicated by overt glomerular disease showed a distinct IgA predominance, mainly expressed in the serum anti-gliadin antibody pool and anti-DNA activity. This profile was essentially similar to that observed in control cirrhotics. There was a significant increase in the frequency of IgA glomerular deposits in renal biopsies obtained from patients with overt schistosomal glomerulopathy, in contrast to control nephrotics. The deposits were mainly mesangial, but were also encountered in subendothelial, subepithelial and peritubular locations. Their frequency was significantly higher with more advanced lesions as seen by light microscopy. The relevance of these data is discussed, leading to the following conclusions: (a) serum IgA-anti-gliadin and -anti-DNA antibodies, and glomerular IgA deposits are markers of significant renal involvement in patients with hepatosplenic schistosomiasis, (b) IgA may be involved in {{the pathogenesis}} of advanced glomerular pathology when superimposed on parasite-induced lesions, (c) There is a significant increase in serum <b>auto-reactivity</b> in hepatosplenic schistosomiasis, which may also have pathogentic implications, (d) Increased production by the inflammatory bowel lesions, impaired clearance by the fibrotic livers and probable switching of immunoglobulin synthesis are suggested to explain the observed IgA predominance in those who develop renal complications...|$|E
40|$|Project 1 : Invariant natural killer T-­cells (iNKT) are {{a subset}} of {{unconventional}} T-­cells arising from the same pool of CD^ 4 + 8 ^+ double-­‐positive (DP) precursors as conventional T-­cells, but are distinct in their T-­cell receptor (TCR) specificity -­ recognizing CD 1 d-­bound glycolipids -­ as well as constitutive expression of memory cell markers and cytokine mRNA. Development of iNKT within the thymus is drastically different {{in terms of both}} the molecular requirements, and the transcriptional processes involved. However, like conventional thymocytes, they are known to undergo positive and negative selective processes to screen TCR functionality and auto-­reactivity, albeit on contrasting cell types – DP thymocytes and dendritic cells respectively. Progressive maturational stages are defined by expression of activation and NK-­ cell markers. Conventional thymocytes up-­regulate the chemokine receptors CCR 4 and CCR 7 post-­positive selection, which control re-localization to the medulla, where they are negatively selected on self-­‐antigens promiscuously expressed by medullary epithelial cells. On deletion of these chemokine receptors, development is unaffected, but auto-­reactive T-­ cells escape deletion, and cause auto-­immunity in the periphery. Our work has demonstrated that deletion of either receptor severely impedes thymic generation of iNKT, although only CCR 4 is expressed on developing iNKT, suggesting localization of other CCR 7 ^+ cell types with iNKT is vital to their development. Project 2 : Natural regulatory T-­cell (nTreg) are a T-­cell subset developed in the thymus which possess the unique capability to actively suppress antigen-­specific CD 4 responses in the periphery, which {{have been shown to be}} essential in the prevention of auto-­immunity through deletion of their lineage-­defining transcription factor Foxp 3. Foxp 3 ^+ nTreg possess T-­cell receptors (TCRs) with high <b>auto-reactivity</b> relative to conventional cells, and are believed to require strong TCR-­ligation and co-stimulation during negative selection for the production of CD 25 ^+ precursors. More recently, it has been demonstrated that peripheral Treg are a heterogenous population, consisting of death-­prone, as well as highly suppressive effector-­memory subsets, which can be separated on the basis of expression of the activation markers ICOS and CD 44. In this study, we have demonstrated ICOS^+CD 44 ^+ memory Treg to have unique homeostatic requirements from conventional CD 4 memory cells, which depend on provision of co-­stimulation by TNF superfamily members CD 30 L and OX 40 L for survival. We did however discover a role for OX 40 signaling in development of nTreg, as well as establishing redundancy in mTEC expression of the co-stimulatory molecules CD 80 / 86 and ICOSL, the former of which has been identified as a key molecule for generation of both nTreg precursors and ICOS^hiCD 44 ^hi Treg. ...|$|E
40|$|T {{cells of}} the {{adaptive}} immune system recognize and kill infected cells by interacting with pathogenic peptides displayed on major histocompatibility complexes (MHC) through its T-cell receptor (TCR). TCR interactions with peptide/MHC complexes occur throughout the lifespan of T cells, from development to activation, with {{the origin of the}} peptide varying between self and foreign. The vast universe of foreign peptides that could appear on infected cells presented by polymorphic MHCs is by far outnumbering the size of the Tcell repertoire. Thus, a property that characterizes T cells is cross-reactivity which enables weak recognition of self-peptides and activation by foreign peptides. Despite being crossreactive T cells are known to be highly specific for cognate antigens, which might seem like a paradox. Therefore, dual recognition of MHC and peptide with the need to be crossreactive yet specific presents challenges to T cells and occurs through mechanisms that are not entirely understood. The studies within this thesis made use of the P 14 T-cell system to investigate how the TCR P 14 can differentiate between peptides {{to learn more about the}} molecular basis dictating specificity, sensitivity and cross-reactivity. P 14 is sensitive to the mutation Y 4 F at the main TCR-recognition site p 4 Y of the viral peptide gp 33, which is utilized by the Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) to escape P 14 T cells. Surprisingly, alanine substitution at p 4 (Y 4 A) of gp 33 is weakly recognized by P 14 through the use of a different thermodynamic signature. At the center of these studies was a peptide modification where position 3 had been substituted to proline (p 3 P), enhancing both TCR affinity and peptide/MHC stability through independent mechanisms. Importantly, p 3 P did not alter the peptide conformation, which is important for T-cell cross-recognition. Weak interactions between p 3 P and the conserved H- 2 Db residue Y 159 accounted for the increased MHC stability, whereas enhanced TCR affinity seemed to arise from decreased binding entropy. The p 3 P modification was applied to the viral escape mutant Y 4 F, which reestablished P 14 recognition. Co-crystal structures of P 14 in complex with gp 33 /H- 2 Db and the p 3 Pmodifed gp 33 /H- 2 Db visualized the structural basis for enhanced TCR affinity as well as the central role of p 4 Y of gp 33 explaining its sensitivity to mutations. Finally, P 14 also weakly recognizes the self-peptide mDBM which under certain circumstances can lead to <b>auto-reactivity.</b> The p 3 P modification was also applied to mDBM, which increased TCR affinity and MHC stability, facilitating crystallization. mDBM was found to be a structural mimic of gp 33, despite a moderate sequence homology. The ternary structure of P 14 in complex with mDBM(3 P) /H- 2 Db demonstrated that flexibility in the CDR 3 β loop mediated cross-reactivity between gp 33 and mDBM. In conclusion, the results here visualize the different faces of TCRs; sensitivity, specificity and cross-reactivity on a molecular basis. Certain peptide substitutions are tolerated through TCR flexibility and peptide adjustments, whereas others are not. Finally, p 3 P substitution increased the immunogenicity of our H- 2 Db-restricted peptides and could present a novel strategy for designing peptide vaccines with increased MHC binding properties...|$|E
40|$|Guillain-Barre {{syndrome}} (GBS) is {{an inflammatory}} polyradiculoneuropathy with acute onset and usually a spontaneous recovery. Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) is a chronic progressive inflammatory neuropathy. GBS and CIDP {{are associated with}} high morbidity despite treatment with immunomodulatory drugs. Both conditions are associated with inflammation of spinal nerve roots and/or distal nerves of the peripheral nervous system (PNS). GBS {{is assumed to be}} induced by infection + abnormal autoimmunity, whereas the immunopathogenesis of CIDP remains obscure. Previous studies have shown up-regulation of myelin-reactive T cells, and of levels of blood cytokines, indicative of T cell <b>auto-reactivity</b> in GBS. Few studies have addressed the balance between Th 1 and Th 2 cytokines over the course of GBS. GBS, but not CIDP, is associated with anti-GM 1 and anti-GD 1 a anti-ganglioside serum antibodies (abs), but the temporal profile of anti-ganglioside abs over the course of GBS is not known. Despite the presumed importance of the role of prior infections in GBS pathogenesis, the nature of the antigen-presenting cells involved in this putative process is unclear. Dendritic cells (DC) are believed {{to play an important role}} in the induction of adaptive and innate immune responses. The myeloid subset of DC activates T and B cells, and the plasmacytoid subset of DC may induce tolerance. The role of DC has not been examined in GBS and CIDP. The aims of the study were to explore the roles of cytokine-secreting cells, anti-ganglioside abs and DC in blood, CSF and PNS over the course of GBS and CIDP, in relation to clinical parameters and immuno-modulatory treatment. Patients examined in the acute phase of GBS prior to treatment with intravenous high dose immunoglobulin (IvIg), had elevated levels of IL- 10, but not of IFN-gamma secreting blood mononuclear cells (MNC). Pre-treatment levels of IL- 10 secreting MNC correlated with neurophysiological signs of axonal damage and with levels of anti-ganglioside serum IgM abs. The highest titers of anti-GM 1 serum IgG abs were observed in GBS patients examined 40 days after onset of GBS, while peak anti-GD 1 a IgM antibody titers were measured in the recovery phase, i. e. 90 days after onset of GBS. Patients developing steadily increasing levels of serum anti-GM 1 IgG- and anti- GD 1 a IgM abs over the course of GBS, followed by a drop in levels of abs (i. e. patients developing peak ab titers) had a worse clinical outcome. Patients examined in the acute phase of GBS prior to lvIg treatment had also high levels of IL- 6 secreting blood MNC. Patients examined in the recovery phase of GBS had lower levels of TNF-alpha secreting MNC vs. controls. Levels of IL- 12 p 70 secreting blood MNC were not altered. Percentages of freshly isolated blood DC expressing cell surface molecules CD 1 a (involved in antigen- presentation), CD 80 and CD 86 (co-stimulatory molecules), CD 54 (adhesion molecule), CD 11 c (marker of myeloid DC) and CD 123 (marker of plasmacytoid DC) as well as the chemokine receptors CCR 1, CCR 2, CCR 5, and CXCR 4 were not altered in patients with GBS and CIDP compared to controls. In contrast, levels of CD 11 c+ DC were elevated in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of CIDP patients, and of CD 123 + DC in CSF of GBS patients prior to immunomodulatory treatment. Small numbers of immature myeloid CD 11 c+CD 14 -CD 16 - DC were detected in the perineurium of sural nerve biopsies of patients with CIDP as well as in controls. Chemokines released by nerve tissue or in CSF are assumed to be responsible for recruiting DC to sites of inflammation. The CSF levels of chemokines MCP- 1 and IP- 10 were elevated in GBS patients and of IP- 10 and MIP- 3 beta in CIDP prior to treatment. The absence of a clear systemic Th 1 cytokine secretion profile in GBS, as well as presence in CSF of plasmacytoid DC, may be one of the explanations for the self-limited course of the auto-aggressive attack against PNS in GBS. Myeloid DC, which may enter the CSF due to elevated levels of MCP- 1, may be retained by MIP- 3 beta and thus contribute to sustained PNS inflammation in CIDP. DC in the CSF and in peripheral nerves, may be responsible for uptake of antigen released from the inflamed PNS, whereby antigen may be presented to T and B cells locally and/or in draining lymph nodes. Further studies of the cause of differential recruitment of DC subsets to CSF as well as the role of CSF chemokines in GBS vs. CIDP are warranted...|$|E
40|$|In T 1 D patients, auto-Ags of {{pancreatic}} insulin-producing ß-cells {{are targeted}} by auto-reactive T cells. The underlying events triggering this excessive <b>auto-reactivity</b> remain unknown, but clearly involve genetic predisposition, allowing inappropriate interaction of environmental factors with the immune system. When diagnosed with T 1 D, patients {{are limited to}} exogenous insulin administrations to control their aberrant glucose metabolism. However, this does not fully prevent the occurrence of complications at later stages in the disease, {{making it difficult to}} pursue normal life quality and quantity. Moreover, this does not address the underlying Ag-specific autoimmunity. Various auto-Ags  a. o. PINS, GAD 65 and IA- 2  are involved in the pathogenesis of T 1 D. Numerous studies in preclinical models have highlighted the potential of Ag-specific approaches to restore tolerance in a highly specific and safe manner. Oral auto-Ag administration uses the tolerogenic nature of the gut-associated immune system to induce Ag-specific tolerance, a phenomenon referred to as oral tolerance induction. However, due to gastric degradation, proper mucosal product delivery often imposes a challenge. Recombinant L. lactis have proven to be effective and safe biological carriers for gastrointestinal delivery of therapeutic products. Preclinical successes with systemic broad immune modulating or Ag-specific therapies have repeatedly failed to demonstrate prolonged efficacy in the clinic, urging the need to explore new therapeutic strategies, such as combinatorial immune approaches, targeting multiple molecular pathways. Previously, recombinant L. lactis secreting PINS and IL- 10 have demonstrated to induce diabetes remission in a well-defined mouse model for T 1 D, when combined with low-doses anti-CD 3 mAbs. Here, we wanted to explore (i) whether targeting other prominent auto-Ags  GAD 65 and IA- 2  could enhance the therapeutic success of this combination strategy and (ii) whether co-administration of systemic immunomodulators are essential for therapeutic efficacy. First, we generated recombinant L. lactis secreting human GAD 65 or IA- 2, two major diabetes-related auto-Ags, by themselves and combined with the anti-inflammatory cytokine human IL- 10. Prohibitive sequence obstacles hampering Ag secretion were resolved by trimming the full size proteins. GAD 65370 - 575 and IA- 2635 - 979 showed to be efficiently secreted by recombinant L. lactis while maintaining sufficient bacterial growth. Our data demonstrated that secretion efficiencies could be influenced by mere physico-chemical properties, such as hydrophobic regions, but emphasized that engineering strategies based on functional epitope-distribution could provide a more relevant secretion product in terms of epitope density and secretion efficiency. To explore the tolerogenic potential of mucosally delivered GAD 65 and IA- 2, recent-onset diabetic NOD mice received intragastric inoculations of recombinant L. lactis secreting GAD 65370 - 575 or IA- 2635 - 979 and IL- 10. In combination with short-course low-dose anti-CD 3, L. lactis secreting GAD 65370 - 575 and IL- 10 stabilized insulitis, preserved functional ß-cell mass and restored normoglycemia in recent-onset NOD mice, even when hyperglycemia was severe at diagnosis. Combination therapy did not eliminate pathogenic effector T cells, but significantly decreased the inflammatory profile of islet cell infiltrates locally in the pancreas. Moreover, this combi-GAD therapy increased the presence of functional CD 4 +Foxp 3 +CD 25 + Tregs in the PLN. In addition, we show, for the first time, that also IA- 2 enholds the potential to normalize hyperglycemia in recent-onset NOD mice. Regardless of IL- 10 co-delivery, recombinant L. lactis secreting IA- 2635 - 979 induced diabetes remission when combined with low-doses anti-CD 3 mAbs. Moreover, efficacy for both auto-Ags was similar in mice with mild and severe hyperglycemia at time of diagnosis. The combined delivery of the three prominent auto-Ags  PINS, GAD 65370 - 575 and IA- 2635 - 979  in our combination setting did not enhance efficacy. The comparable success rates suggest that, at least in part, Treg-mediated bystander suppression could account for the tolerogenic effects, as was partly demonstrated in cured combi-GAD-treated mice. These data further suggest that inherent features of the NOD mouse model, such as insufficient ß-cell mass or fullblown inflammation levels in a subgroup of diagnosed mice, could account for the limited efficacy. We further explored an innovative Ag-specific combination strategy that could open up new therapeutic possibilities for T 1 D. As a general conclusion, we can say that recombinant L. lactis are an exquisite and flexible biological delivery platform that could be applied for oral tolerance induction in the emerging field of autoimmune diseases. In the NOD mouse model, we have demonstrated therapeutic efficacy with a combinatory approach whereby systemic immunomodulation installs the tolerogenic conditions needed for Ag-specific immune regulation to stably restore tolerance. Small Ag-steered differences in therapeutic efficacy favor the exploration of a patient-tailored clinical validation. In order to ensure efficient clinical translation of combination therapies, a substantially validated choice of monotherapies, defined target groups and relevant endpoints are key and need to be carefully considered. Taken together, our data point to a clear opportunity of combinatory strategies, where recombinant L. lactis could make the difference in medicine. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} (RA) is an {{autoimmune disease}} that primarily affects thejoints and {{is characterized by}} bone and cartilage erosion. These patients have {{an increased risk of}} developing co-morbid cardiovascular disease (CVD). In this study the vascular adventitia from patients with coexisting RA and CVD was investigated to identify factors in the vascular environment that could affect the immune component of RA. This included the histological evaluation of aortic adventitial sections for known RA-associated autoantigens; B cells their survival factors and associated cytokines. In addition, these human studies were the impetus for the initiation of a study to investigate the effect of B cell depletion on atherosclerosis. Citrullinated proteins (CP), RA associated antigens, are an inflammation specific entity. These modified proteins are processed by (PADI), a calcium dependent enzyme expressed by inflammatory cells and some microbial species. The presence of RA specific autoantibodies (ACPA) suggests a role for citrullinated proteins in RA pathogenesis. The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine whether the inflammatory milieu in the vascular adventitia of RA patients had any association with CP. The expression of CP was confirmed in the vascular adventitia, and CVD patients with coexisting RA were found to have increased levels of CP compared to non-RA CVD patients. In addition, ACPA levels were detectable in serum samples of only RA patients. When ACPA positive RA patients were sub grouped (CP> 5. 5), a strong association was observed between ACPA levels and C-reactive protein (CRP) in this subgroup (CP> 5. 5). This is suggestive of a CP and ACPA link in vascular inflammation in patients with coexisting RA. The presence of B-lymphocytes has been shown in both murine and human vascular adventitia. In this study we demonstrated that the presence of B cell aggregates is tissue specific, since matched internal mammary artery (IMA) had no detectable B cells in the adventitia. Furthermore, BAFF and APRIL are present in the aortic adventitia and support the conclusion that a survival niche is present in the aortic adventitia; cytokine expression was demonstrated in lymphocytes, adipocytes and vascular endothelial cells. Interestingly, smoking resulted in higher levels of BAFF expression in the aortic adventitia of CVD patients. Previous studies have shown that smoking induces vasoconstriction of small vessels (vasa vasorum), and hence hypoxia of the vascular endothelial cells. We hypothesised that hypoxia would induce the increased expression of BAFF and APRIL in vascular endothelial cells. Using murine vascular endothelial cells we investigated the effect of hypoxia on BAFF and APRIL mRNA transcript levels. However, hypoxia did not have any effect on transcript levels. In addition, significant correlations were observed in RA patients only, between B cells and APRIL, B cells and CP, APRIL and CP. This part of my thesis demonstrates that the aortic adventitia of RA patients with coronary heart disease is associated with an environment that is conducive to B cell survival and harbours a known RA-associated self-antigen. Importantly, these insights provide a rationale for the perpetuation of B cell <b>auto-reactivity</b> outside of both lymphoid tissue and the joint in RA. Previous studies have shown that atherosclerosis is a T cell mediated disease with an imbalance in Th 1 and Th 2 responses. Macrophages and interleukin 18 (IL- 18, proatherogenic) cytokine have been demonstrated in aortic adventitia of humans in previous studies. However, their expression in the vascular adventitia of RA patients has not been investigated. The present study confirmed macrophage IL- 18 expression in vascular adventitia, which is similar among the Subgroups (RA vs. non RA) and (smokers vs. non smokers). Furthermore, a Th 2 phenotype has been proposed as atheroprotective, mediated by anti oxLDL antibody producing B cells. Interestingly, recent studies have demonstrated interleukin 33 (IL- 33) a Th 2 cytokine to reduce the atherosclerotic lesion in an experimental model of atherosclerosis. However, it’s expression and significance in human vessels has not been extensively investigated. In this study, using immunohistochemistry, IL- 33 was localised to vascular endothelial cells of vasa vasorum in aortic adventitia and lining layer of IMA. Importantly, IL- 33 was down regulated in smoker’s AA suggestive of failed protective mechanism of this Th 2 cytokine. In contrast, IL- 33 expression was not affected by smoking in the matched IMA tissue. In the past B-lymphocytes have been shown as an atheroprotective pathway; whereas the use of B cells depletion therapy (Rituximab) suggests a proinflammatory role of these cells in RA. Could B cell depletion therefore mediate unexpected deficit on vascular lesions in RA? My thesis revealed expression of B cells and their survival factors in the aortic adventitia. Therefore to investigate the impact of B cell depletion therapy on atherosclerosis, a mouse model (huCD 20 /ApoE-/-) was generated. The preliminary data are suggestive of reduction in atherosclerotic plaques with B cells depletion. These studies will be extended in future to formally test the above hypothesis. In summary I have shown for the first time the cytokine and cellular niche that exists in human aorta in RA patients. Such data will in due course inform the mechanism of accelerated vascular pathogenesis in RA. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
