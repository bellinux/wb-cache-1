40|$|In the safeguards, arms control, and nonproliferation regimes {{measurements}} are required which give {{the quantity of}} fissile material in an <b>accounting</b> <b>item,</b> e. g., a standard container of plutonium or uranium oxide. Because {{of the complexity of}} modeling the absorption of gamma rays in high-Z materials, gamma-ray spectrometry is not customarily used for this purpose. Gamma-ray measurements can be used to determine the fissile mass when two conditions are met: (1) The material is in a standard container, and (2) The material is finely divided, or a solid item with a reproducible shape. The methodology consists of: (A) Measurement of the emitted gamma rays, and (B) Measurement of the transmission through the item of the high-energy gamma rays of Co- 60 and Th- 228. We have demonstrated that items containing nuclear materials possess a characteristic ''fingerprint'' of gamma rays which depends not only on the nuclear properties, but also on the mass, density, shape, etc [...] The material's spectrum confirms its integrity, homogeneity, and volume as well. While there is attenuation of radiation from the interior, the residual radiation confirms the homogeneity of the material throughout the volume. Transmission measurements, where the attenuation depends almost entirely on Compton scattering, determine the material mass. With well-characterized standards, this methodology can provide an accurate measure of the contained fissile material...|$|E

40|$|Background and problem: The {{purpose of}} {{financial}} reporting is to supply information to {{users of the}} financial statements. The information can include complex accounting items such as ‘deferred revenues’, which need to be communicated from a subsidiary (agent) to an owner (principal). In {{order to reduce the}} complexity of accounting items, the information must be communicated, so that both agent and principal gain {{a deeper understanding of the}} accounting items and the economic events from which they arise. Purpose: The purpose of the study is to investigate the role of communication within an agency relationship between a municipality and a municipally owned real estate entity. The research will show how communication is reducing the complexity of accounting items in such a relationship. Method: This study examines the communication within an agency relationship through a case study on a municipally owned real estate entity, investigating the <b>accounting</b> <b>item</b> ‘deferred revenues’. The empirical data is gathered through archival research and semi-structured interviews. Analysis and conclusion: The analysis shows how the three communication channels (information groups, common intranet and internal reporting system), reducing the complexity of ‘deferred revenues’, are linked to the matrix of communication. Furthermore, it shows the communication channels’ relation to the assumptions of information asymmetry and information as a commodity within agency theory. This study proves that communicating information reduces the complexity of accounting items within an agency relationship. MSc in Accountin...|$|E
30|$|Based on {{a sample}} of 405 firm-quarters and 202 article-firm-quarters of US {{financial}} firms that report DVAs between 2007 and 2014, I give comprehensive descriptive evidence on the occurrence, size, and reporting by managers and the financial press of controversial debt value adjustments due {{to a change in}} own credit risk (DVAs). I found that DVAs occur mainly for few, very large US financial firms who apply the fair value option for liabilities thoroughly. For these firms, I found that DVAs occur regularly and that DVA gains and DVA losses occur about equally often and on average with comparable size. I further found that managers mention DVAs in 60.5 % of their quarterly earnings press releases but scarcely give directional DVA information that could help unravel DVAs’ perceived “counterintuitiveness” (26.4 %). Consistent with claims from the public DVA debate, I found that managers give specific DVA information more often for large negative DVAs than for large positive DVAs. Also, I found evidence that managers give rather profound DVA information more often when they have strategic incentives to do so. Concerning financial press’ DVA reporting, I found that the press potentially acts as a counterweight to this behavior by covering large positive DVAs more often than large negative DVAs. However, I also find evidence that the press’ decision to cover DVAs follows the emphasis that managers put on DVAs. Finally, I found that the financial press possibly enhances investors’ understanding of DVAs by providing new DVA information on income-increasing DVAs and when managers’ DVA reporting is scarce. The evidence provides insights into the properties and the informational environment of a novel <b>accounting</b> <b>item</b> {{that is the subject of}} a public debate.|$|E

40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{the financing}} decision of raising equity through a rights {{issue in a}} developing market, the Athens Stock Exchange (ASE), during a particular emerging period. Specifically, this study examines the information content of <b>accounting</b> <b>items</b> derived from published financial statements the year prior to a 'hot' period in explaining post-issue stock price performance. We are using data from listed companies in the ASE during the 'hot period' of year 1999 when stock prices burst and an unusual large number of seasoned equity offerings (SEOs) took place. Our empirical results do not verify a statistically significant relationship between discretionary accruals in the year preceding the issue and post-issue stock returns. Moreover, historical <b>accounting</b> <b>items</b> do not provide value relevant information and cannot be used to explain post-issue stock returns. Market trend prior to the issuing is {{proved to be the}} only significant variable in explaining post SEO returns. The overall findings are in line with the market timing theory which claims that managers just time their equity issues in an upward moving market in order to increase the offering proceeds. ...|$|R

40|$|Motivated by the European Union (EU) {{decision}} to mandate {{application of the}} International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) to the consolidated financial statements of all EU listed firms (Regulation (EC) 1606 / 2002), starting in December 2005, we compare the value relevance of accounting information in 14 European countries in the year prior to and {{the year of the}} mandatory adoption of the IFRS. We focus on three <b>accounting</b> information <b>items</b> for which measurements under IFRS are likely to differ considerably from measurements under domestic accounting practices across the EU countries prior to the introduction of the international standards: goodwill, research and development expenses (R&D), and asset revaluation. These three items, selected on an a priori basis, have been shown in previous research to differ in the effect of uncertainty on their future benefits. We use valuation models that include these three variables and in addition the book value of equity and earnings. Overall, our study suggests that the adoption of the IFRS has increased the value relevance of the three accounting numbers for investors in equity securities in the EU. Association tests support our two hypotheses: (1) in the year prior to the mandatory adoption of the IFRS, the incremental value relevance to investors of the three domestic GAAP-based <b>accounting</b> <b>items</b> was greater in countries where the respective domestic standards were more compatible with the IFRS; and (2) the higher the deviation of the three domestic GAAP-based <b>accounting</b> <b>items</b> from their corresponding IFRS values, the greater the incremental value relevance to investors from the switch to IFRS. These associations prevail when considering cross-country differences in the institutional environments, which tend to provide complementary effects. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose-The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to provide a judgment on the comparability of financial statements prepared under IFRS and US-GAAP. We developed two research questions for evaluating comparability within Europe (IFRS) and within the US (US GAAP) and for testing whether comparability is higher or lower when the US companies are included with the European countries. Design/Methodology/Approach-The T index framework was used to summarize the level of comparability for 13 <b>accounting</b> <b>items</b> using data from 250 companies. Findings-Empirical results are mixed. Of 13 <b>accounting</b> <b>items</b> considered, international comparability is significantly lower for 7 items and significantly higher for 4 items when the US companies are included. Furthermore, comparability amongst companies using IFRS is not consistently higher or lower than comparability amongst companies using US GAAP. Practical implications-Answers to the research questions may provide useful suggestions for IASB’s current policy direction towards global accounting standards convergence, and in particular for the IASB-FASB convergence project. The results also have implications for companies or countries considering shifting to IFRS or US GAAP. Research limitations/implications-Lack of comparability within countries, rather than between countries, suggests a need to focus on reducing options within standards rather than on differences between standards or countries. Originality value-Our empirical results show that in most cases lack of comparability may be driven by options within a standard rather than by explicit differences between standards...|$|R
