500|$|The review {{aggregation}} website Rotten Tomatoes sampled 29 reviews, {{and gave}} Fame {{a score of}} 83%, with an average score of 7.2 out of 10. The website's consensus reads, [...] "Just because Fame is a well-acted musical doesn't mean it flinches against its surprisingly heavy topics." [...] Initial reactions among film critics were mixed. Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune awarded the film two-and-a-half stars out of four, writing, [...] "When the kids perform, the movie sings, but their fictionalized personal stories are melodramatic drivel." [...] Dave Kehr of the Chicago Reader wrote, [...] "The film is cut at such a frenzied pitch that it's often possible to believe (mistakenly) that something significant is going on." [...] Variety magazine wrote, [...] "The great strength {{of the film is}} in the school scenes – when it wanders away from the scholastic side as it does with increasing frequency as the overlong feature moves along, it loses dramatic intensity and slows the pace." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times awarded the film three-and-a-half stars out of four writing, [...] "Fame is a genuine treasure, moving and entertaining, a movie that understands being <b>a</b> <b>teen-ager</b> as well as Breaking Away did, but studies its characters in a completely different milieu." [...] William Gallagher, in his review for the BBC, wrote, [...] "Alan Parker manages to make this a fairly horrible story even while it remains entertaining. You come away from it with all your preconceptions about the glamour of showbusiness wiped away and you can't help but admire the characters who get through." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, {{the album}} {{garnered}} general acclaim from critics. Rolling Stones Rob Hoerburger {{commented that the}} [...] "sharp-tongued" [...] Janet Jackson is [...] "more concerned with identity than with playlists", as Control declares {{she is no longer}} the Jacksons' baby sister. Hoerburger expressed the view that tracks such as [...] "Nasty" [...] and [...] "What Have You Done for Me Lately" [...] erased the former [...] "pop-ingénue image" [...] of Jackson's first two albums, and that [...] "Control is a better album than Diana Ross has made in five years and puts Janet in a position similar to the young Donna Summer's—unwilling to accept novelty status and taking her own steps to rise above it." [...] Steven Ivory of Billboard expressed [...] "ocally, Jackson is more aggressive than ever. Indeed, her exhibition of sass and funkiness is certainly more provocative" [...] in comparison to her previous work. NME wrote: [...] "Jackson has gone a long way in shaking off the experience of being a shadow Jackson child. She is an artist in her own right." [...] Newsweek stated [...] "n an era of big-voiced pop-soul divas... her current hit album, is taut, funky, hard as nails, an alternative to the sentimental balladry and opulent arrangements of Patti LaBelle and Whitney Houston." [...] Robert Christgau [...] "scoffed at Janet's claims of autonomy", but gave the album a B rating based on [...] "its entertainment value". Los Angeles Times critic Connie Johnson wrote: [...] "Though still <b>a</b> <b>teen-ager,</b> this singer's stance is remarkably nervy and mature. She has a snotty sort of assurance that permeates several cuts, plus the musical muscle to back it up." [...] Jon Pareles of The New York Times notes Control takes obvious influence from Prince, describing [...] "he album's pacing, its clipped vocal lines—even the spoken introduction that starts things off" [...] as pure Minneapolis sound; he adds [...] "ut where the Prince style is usually connected with heavy-breathing come-ons, Miss Jackson is cheerfully standoffish." ...|$|E

5000|$|Jama Williamson {{appeared}} in the 2002 Off Broadway stage musical adaption of the 1978 pornographic film Debbie Does Dallas, which was shown at the Jane Street Theater starting October 2002. She played Roberta, one of Debbie's attractive young friends who perform sexual services for money. Williamson, along with other female members of the cast, was praised by The New York Times theater critic Bruce Weber as [...] "for {{lack of a better}} word, adorable", and appeared to be [...] "having great fun while they wait for better jobs". During the show, she performs a sexually-themed duet called [...] "Make That Candle Work for You", in which Roberta and her boss sing at the candle store where Roberta works. During the song, girls dance with candles shaped like erect penises. The song was sung by Williamson in the Debbie Does Dallas Original Cast Recording soundtrack, which was released on compact disc in 2003. Her singing voice, along with those {{of the rest of the}} cast, was praised in a Los Angeles Times review. From October to November 2003, Williamson played the title role in Sylvia, a comedy by A. R. Gurney, at Playhouse on the Green in Bridgeport, Connecticut. The show was about a dog (played by a human) named Sylvia who is adopted by a couple, which creates drama in their relationship. Irene Backalenick of the Connecticut Post said of Williamson's performance, [...] "Jama Williamson is just not doggy enough, playing it more like <b>a</b> petulant <b>teen-ager.</b> She is really convincing as Sylvia the dog only when she lies down, putting her chin on Greg's knee." ...|$|R

[...] Almond also applauded Ruck's performance, going so far as saying he deserved the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor of 1986: [...] "His performance is what elevates the film, allows it to assume the power of a modern parable." [...] The New York Times reviewer Nina Darnton criticized Mia Sara's portrayal of Sloane for lacking [...] "the specific detail that characterized the adolescent characters in Hughes's other films", asserting she [...] "created a basically stable but forgettable character." [...] Conversely, Darnton praised Ruck and Grey's performances: [...] "The two people who grow in the movie—Cameron, played with humor and sensitivity by Alan Ruck, and Ferris's sister Jeanie, played with appropriate self-pity by Jennifer Grey—are the most authentic. Grey manages to play <b>an</b> insufferably sulky <b>teen-ager</b> who is still attractive and likable." ...|$|R
