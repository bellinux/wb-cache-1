50|$|When Pichushkin arrives, Rick and Vicki shoot his bodyguards, {{before he}} reveals {{that he is}} {{carrying}} a suitcase nuke and has possession of a remote <b>arming</b> <b>device.</b> As he flees, Sarah and Vicki pursue him, while Chuck joins Casey and Rick to disarm the bomb. Sarah finds Pichushkin, who informs her that the <b>arming</b> <b>device</b> is wired to his heartbeat to activate when he dies, drawing a gun on Sarah. Before Sarah can warn her, Vicki shoots Pichushkin, arming the nuclear device. Rick declares that the bomb is too complicated for the Intersect to disarm, but Chuck attempts to do so nonetheless. After flashing on the detonator, Chuck realizes the component is from a Chinese submarine and must {{have been designed to}} deactivate in the presence of salt water in case of hull breaches. He then uses the sodium in his apple juice to defuse the bomb.|$|E

5000|$|The {{final design}} for the T-13 hand grenade {{utilized}} a pressure trigger {{as well as an}} in-flight <b>arming</b> <b>device.</b> The grenade was designed to be thrown as a traditional baseball, and as such it was held with two fingers on a weighted and knurled [...] "butterfly cap" [...] and the arming pin was removed. Once thrown, the cap detached from the body of the grenade and a length of nylon string unwound until a secondary arming pin attached {{to the far end of}} the cord was pulled, arming the grenade to detonate upon impact with a hard surface. While the original design called for a 5.5 oz total weight, it was later decided that this was too light and the weight was increased to 12 oz.|$|E

Methods : Forty-eight participants (33 women and 15 men, mean age 81. 3 ± 8. 0 years) had their BP measured with a wrist device with position sensor and an <b>arm</b> <b>device</b> in random order in a sitting position. Results : Average BP measurements were consistently lower with the wrist than <b>arm</b> <b>device</b> for systolic BP (120. 1 ± 2. 2 vs. 130. 5 ± 2. 2 mmHg, P Conclusion : Compared with the <b>arm</b> <b>device,</b> the wrist device with position sensor systematically underestimated systolic as well as diastolic BP. The magnitude of the difference is clinically significant and questions the use of the wrist device to monitor BP in elderly persons.

50|$|Combination fuze design {{attempts}} to maximize optimum detonation while recognizing dangers of early fuze function (and potential dangers of late function for subsequent {{occupation of the}} target zone by friendly forces or for gravity return of anti-aircraft munitions used in defense of surface positions.) Series fuze combinations minimize early function by detonating at the latest activation of the individual components. Series combinations are useful for safety arming devices, but increase the percentage of late and dud munitions. Parallel fuze combinations minimize duds by detonating at the earliest activation of individual components, but increase the possibility of premature early function of the munition. Sophisticated military munition fuzes typically contain an <b>arming</b> <b>device</b> in series with a parallel arrangement of sensing fuzes for target destruction and a time fuze for self-destruction if no target is detected.|$|E

Jaffa calls Hassan from a private jet, telling him he is free and on his way to Algeria, but Hassan will not be swayed from his plan.

40|$|MEMS {{processing}} {{technology can}} manufacture any complex structures in a plane, using this point, a variable stiffness design {{idea for the}} planar micro-spring is proposed. That is, using one type of structure named contact pairs to achieve stiffness change during the micro-spring’s stretching process. Using contact pairs, three types of variable stiffness springs are designed: stiffness increase spring, stiffness decrease spring and stiffness hump spring. Finally, the variable stiffness springs’ application for fuze setback <b>arming</b> <b>device</b> is discussed. When {{the three types of}} springs are used in setback <b>arming</b> <b>device,</b> the stiffness decrease spring is better than the other two springs from security analysis. Kinematic analysis shows that, if the variable stiffness spring’s design is reasonable, the setback <b>arming</b> <b>device</b> not only can effectively solve the safety and reliability issues for rocket fuze, but also applies in small caliber grenade fuze’s working environment without changing the setback arming device’s size and structure. Analysis result indicate that the setback <b>arming</b> <b>device</b> based on MEMS variable stiffness spring is universal for rocket fuze and small caliber grenade fuze. ...|$|E
