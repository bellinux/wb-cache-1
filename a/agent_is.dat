The chelate that is thus formed is nontoxic and can be excreted in the urine, initially at up to 50 times the normal rate. The chelating agents used for treatment of lead poisoning are edetate disodium calcium (CaNa2EDTA), dimercaprol (BAL), which are injected, and succimer and d-penicillamine, which are administered orally.|$|E

5|$|Diagnosis of a {{cerebrospinal}} fluid leak is performed {{through a combination}} of measurement of the CSF pressure and a computed tomography myelogram (CTM) scan of the spinal column for fluid leaks. The opening fluid pressure in the spinal canal is obtained by performing a lumbar puncture, also known as a spinal tap. Once the pressure is measured, a radiocontrast <b>agent</b> <b>is</b> injected into the spinal fluid. The contrast then diffuses out through the dura sac before leaking through dural holes. This allows for a CTM with fluoroscopy to locate and image any sites of dura rupture via contrast seen outside the dura sac in the imagery.|$|E

Harris made the final roster. Me made his debut on October 29 against the Toronto Raptors in which he scored 8 points. Harris' <b>agent</b> <b>is</b> Henry Thomas.

30|$|We have {{implemented}} a software {{system based on}} the methodology proposed in this paper. Each agent has a graphical user interface (GUI) and a software module to interact with other agents in the system. The requirements of an order <b>agent</b> <b>are</b> specified by a GUI and are represented and stored in XML format. In addition, a workflow agent consists of a proper GUI to specify its properties and represent its workflow model. The workflow model is described by a timed Petri net model. The properties of a workflow <b>agent</b> <b>are</b> described by an XML file. The activities of the workflow to be performed by resource <b>agents</b> <b>are</b> also represented by timed Petri net models. The capabilities of a resource <b>agent</b> <b>are</b> defined by a GUI and are also described by an XML file. The order requirements are the inputs of order <b>agents</b> and <b>are</b> represented in XML in our system. The inputs of workflow <b>agents</b> <b>are</b> the workflow Petri net models represented in PNML, and the inputs of resource <b>agents</b> <b>are</b> the activity Petri net models represented in PNML.|$|R

5|$|Kant's Formula of Autonomy {{expresses the}} idea that an <b>agent</b> <b>is</b> obliged to follow the Categorical Imperative because of their {{rational}} will, rather than any outside influence. Kant believed that any moral law motivated {{by the desire to}} fulfill some other interest would deny the Categorical Imperative, leading him to argue that the moral law must only arise from a rational will. This principle requires people to recognize the right of others to act autonomously and means that, as moral laws must be universalisable, what is required of one person is required of all.|$|E

5|$|NSAIDs are {{the usual}} {{first-line}} treatment for gout. No specific <b>agent</b> <b>is</b> significantly {{more or less}} effective than any other. Improvement may be seen within four hours and treatment is recommended for one to two weeks. They are not recommended, however, in those with certain other health problems, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, kidney failure, or heart failure. While indometacin has historically been {{the most commonly used}} NSAID, an alternative, such as ibuprofen, may be preferred due to its better side effect profile in the absence of superior effectiveness. For those at risk of gastric side effects from NSAIDs, an additional proton pump inhibitor may be given. There is some evidence that COX-2 inhibitors may work as well as nonselective NSAIDs for acute gout attack with fewer side effects.|$|E
5|$|Sections 21–23 {{cover the}} review of agents and the {{liability}} of trustees for agents actions. Section 21 identifies that review and liability occurs when the trustees appoints agents, nominees and custodians under the Act or under similar provisions in the trust instrument. Section 22 provides a duty on trustees who delegate their powers, with the duty consisting of three elements. Firstly, trustees are required {{to make sure that}} <b>agent</b> <b>is</b> suitable for the job he is employed to do. Secondly, they are required to consider whether or not to intervene in the appointment if circumstances demand it. Thirdly, trustees are required to intervene after appointment if the circumstances demand it. Section 23 establishes trustees' liability for the actions of agents; a trustee is liable for negligence if he violates the general duty of care set out in Section 1, but not otherwise.|$|E

Only a few <b>agents</b> <b>are</b> present in a large number of locations; most <b>agents</b> <b>are</b> limited to one location only.

5|$|In {{an effort}} to prevent poisoning, often a bittering agent called denatonium benzoate, known by the trade name Bitrex, is added to {{ethylene}} glycol preparations as an adversant to prevent accidental or intentional ingestion. The bittering <b>agent</b> <b>is</b> thought to stop ingestion {{as part of the}} human defense against ingestion of harmful substances is rejection of bitter tasting substances. In the United States, eight states (Oregon, California, New Mexico, Virginia, Arizona, Maine, Tennessee, Washington) have made the addition of bittering agents to antifreeze compulsory. Three follow up studies targeting limited populations or suicidal persons to assess the efficacy of bittering agents in preventing toxicity or death have, however, shown limited benefit of bittering ethylene glycol preparations in these two populations. Specifically, Mullins finds that bittering of antifreeze does not reduce reported cases of poisoning of preschoolers in the US state of Oregon. Similarly, White found that adding bittering agents did not decrease the frequency or severity of antifreeze poisonings in {{children under the age of}} 5. Additionally, another study by White found that suicidal persons are not deterred by the bittered taste of antifreeze in their attempts to kill themselves. These studies did not focus on poisoning of domestic pets or livestock, for example, or inadvertent exposure to bittered antifreeze among a large population (of non-preschool age children).|$|E
