5|$|Theophrastus groups {{together}} the cereals and the legumes (peas and beans), and includes millet and other many-seeded plants like sesame also. These {{can only be}} grown from seed. They can be sown early, as with wheat, barley and beans, or in spring after the equinox, for plants like lentils, tares and peas. Vetch and chickpeas can, he reports, be sown at either season. When sprouting, beans form a shape like a penis, from which the root grows down and the leafy stem upwards. Wheat and barley flower {{for four or five}} days, whereas the legumes flower for much longer. Theophrastus reports that these plants grow differently according to the region, so for instance crops in Salamis appear earlier than those elsewhere in Attica. Wheat varieties are recorded as being named for their localities; they differ in colour, size, growth habit and food value. In a place near Bactra in Asia the wheat grains are said to grow <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> stone of an olive, whereas pulses do not in Theophrastus's view vary to the same extent.|$|E

First, the scoreboard was renovated and after completion, is now twice <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> old scoreboard.

25|$|Because demosaicing is not {{required}} for the Foveon X3 sensor to produce a full-color image, the color artifacts ("colored jaggies") associated with that process are not seen. The separate anti-aliasing filter commonly used to mitigate those artifacts in a Bayer sensor is {{not required}}. This is because little aliasing occurs when the photodiodes for each color, {{with the assistance of}} the microlenses, integrate the optical image over a region almost <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> spacing of sensors for that color.|$|E

It started in 1934 when the Washington Redskins were first {{known as the}} Boston Redskin; the Redskin defeated the Eagles 6–0, and lead the all-time series 81–78–5. The Redskins have owned the rivalry since 2010, most recently extending their winning streak against the Eagles to 5 consecutive games with a 27–22 victory at the Linc on December 11, 2016. The last time the Redskins won 5 or more consecutive games against the Eagles was 1981–84, during which they won 6 consecutive games.|$|E
25|$|Two years later, astronomers Roger G. Clowes and Luis E. Campusano {{discovered}} the Clowes–Campusano LQG, a large quasar group measuring two billion light years at its widest point, {{and was the}} largest known structure in the Universe {{at the time of}} its announcement. In April 2003, another large-scale structure was discovered, the Sloan Great Wall. In August 2007, a possible supervoid was detected in the constellation Eridanus. It coincides with the 'CMB cold spot', a cold region in the microwave sky that is highly improbable under the currently favored cosmological model. This supervoid could cause the cold spot, but to do so it would have to be improbably big, possibly a billion light-years across, almost <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Giant Void mentioned above.|$|E
25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} any {{pool of water}} that mingles with the water of a mikveh is as valid as the mikveh itself.

Rabbi Judah taught that this is the case when it stands by itself (and forms an {{independent}} pool separated by a wall from the pool in the cavern), but if it does not stand by itself, one may immerse in it just as it is (for {{it is part of the}} pool in the cavern).|$|E

25|$|In a {{turbulent}} flow, {{there is a}} range of scales of the time-varying fluid motion. The size of the largest scales of fluid motion (sometimes called eddies) are set by the overall geometry of the flow. For instance, in an industrial smoke stack, the largest scales of fluid motion are <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> diameter of the stack itself. The size of the smallest scales is set by the Reynolds number. As the Reynolds number increases, smaller and smaller scales of the flow are visible. In a smoke stack, the smoke may appear to have many very small velocity perturbations or eddies, in addition to large bulky eddies. In this sense, the Reynolds number is {{an indicator of the}} range of scales in the flow. The higher the Reynolds number, the greater the range of scales. The largest eddies will always be the same size; the smallest eddies are determined by the Reynolds number.|$|E

500|$|During the 1960s Birmingham was {{the home}} of a music scene {{comparable}} to that of Liverpool. Although it produced no single band <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>as</b> <b>The</b> Beatles it was [...] "a seething cauldron of musical activity", and the international success of groups such as The Move, The Spencer Davis Group, The Moody Blues, Traffic and the Electric Light Orchestra had a collective influence that stretched into the 1970s and beyond. The city was the birthplace of heavy metal music, with pioneering metal bands from the late 1960s and 1970s such as Black Sabbath, Judas Priest, and half of Led Zeppelin having come from Birmingham. The next decade saw the influential metal bands Napalm Death and Godflesh arise from the city. Birmingham was the birthplace of modern bhangra in the 1960s, and by the 1980s had established itself as the global centre of bhangra culture, which has grown into a global phenomenon embraced by members of the Indian diaspora worldwide from Los Angeles to Singapore. The 1970s also saw the rise of reggae and ska in the city with such bands as Steel Pulse, UB40, Musical Youth, The Beat and Beshara, expounding racial unity with politically leftist lyrics and multiracial line-ups, mirroring social currents in Birmingham at that time.|$|E
500|$|The chicks are {{at first}} covered with greyish-white down and develop rapidly. Within a week {{they can hold}} their heads up and shuffle around in the nest. The female tears up the food brought by the male and {{distributes}} it to the chicks. Initially these make a [...] "chittering" [...] sound but this soon changes into a food-demanding [...] "snore". By two weeks old they are already half their adult weight and look naked {{as the amount of}} down is insufficient to cover their growing bodies. By three weeks old, quills are starting to push through the skin and the chicks stand, making snoring noises with wings raised and tail stumps waggling, begging for food items which are now given whole. The male is the main provider of food until all the chicks are at least four weeks old at which time the female begins to leave the nest and starts to roost elsewhere. By the sixth week the chicks are <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> adults but have slimmed down somewhat by the ninth week when they are fully fledged and start leaving the nest briefly themselves. They are still dependent on the parent birds until about thirteen weeks and receive training from the female in finding, and eventually catching, prey.|$|E
