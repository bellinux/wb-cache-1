5|$|In 2002, Hwang et al. {{found that}} Microraptor {{was the most}} {{primitive}} dromaeosaurid. Xu and colleagues in 2003 cited the basal position of Microraptor, along with feather and wing features, <b>as</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> the ancestral dromaeosaurid could glide.

5|$|It is {{possible}} that the anti-Semitic passages in her memoir were intended to be used <b>as</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> she was not Jewish; alternatively, she may have been influenced by Ezra Pound's anti-Semitic radio broadcasts. Whatever the case, she did help a Jewish couple escape Italy, providing passage on a ship to the United States.

5|$|Mallory's {{nomination}} as Secretary of the Navy {{was submitted}} to the Provisional Congress {{as soon as the}} act establishing a navy was passed.

5|$|The Japanese High Command {{believed}} that the raid had been conducted in preparation for an invasion of south China.

5|$|The {{circuits}} in the cerebellum {{are similar}} across all classes of vertebrates, including fish, reptiles, birds, and mammals.

5|$|The {{filaments}} exhibit random {{orientations and}} are often wavy, which has been interpreted <b>as</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> they were soft and pliable in life. Microscopic examination shows that individual filaments appear dark along the edges and light internally, suggesting that they were hollow, like modern feathers. Compared to modern mammals the filaments were quite coarse, with each individual strand much larger and thicker than the corresponding hairs of similarly sized mammals.|$|E

5|$|The {{fossils of}} the Burgess Shale were hidden in store rooms until the 1960s. When Whittington {{and his colleagues}} first began to publish their Burgess finds in the early 1970s, the fossils became central to the debate about how quickly animals arose, and were {{interpreted}} <b>as</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> all the living bilaterian phyla {{had appeared in the}} Early Cambrian, along with many other phyla that had become extinct {{by the end of the}} Cambrian.|$|E
5|$|Alchimowicz {{provided}} the underground with highly-sensitive {{material on the}} MBP’s covert operations, internal organization and senior personnel as well <b>as</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> {{the results of the}} people’s referendum of June 1946 had been forged by the MBP to favor the communists and their allies.

5|$|Analyzing the results, The Burlington Free Press {{pointed to}} Shumlin's {{relatively}} soft numbers in opinion polls – {{he was in}} the mid-40s in the last four polls of the race – <b>as</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> voters were dissatisfied with the progress the state had made in instituting single-payer health care, with rising property taxes, and with the unsuccessful roll-out of Vermont Health Connect, the state's federal health care exchange. Shumlin's internal polls showed a close race and he touted an endorsement from U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy to try to put him over 50%. By comparison, Milne lagged in fundraising and spending, with $100,000 available compared to Shumlin's $1.1 million, which meant that he could not afford to pay for polling.|$|E

5|$|Another claim {{involved}} alien invasion. In December 2010, an article, {{first published}} in examiner.com and later referenced in the English-language edition of Pravda claimed, citing a Second Digitized Sky Survey photograph <b>as</b> <b>evidence,</b> <b>that</b> SETI had detected three large spacecraft due to arrive at Earth in 2012. Astronomer and debunker Phil Plait noted that by using the small-angle formula, one could determine that if the object in the photo were as large as claimed, {{it would have had}} to be closer to Earth than the Moon, which would mean it would already have arrived. In January 2011, Seth Shostak, chief astronomer of SETI, issued a press release debunking the claims.|$|E
5|$|Boycott's {{eight seasons}} of {{captaincy}} were among Yorkshire's least successful. The club {{failed to win}} any competitions and ranked low in the Championship table, in contrast to their one-time dominance of English cricket. The {{beginning of the end}} of his captaincy came after BBC Radio Leeds interviews in which two Yorkshire committee members and former players, Don Brennan and Mel Ryan, said that a change in leadership was needed. Boycott himself did not suffer a loss of form to mirror that of his county; in his first year as captain, he scored 2,503runs at an average of 100.12, included a century in his first match as captain. His success was cited by Trueman <b>as</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> his selfish nature was harming Yorkshire.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the raid}} one {{civilian}} and three American soldiers had been killed and eight wounded including the Ojo de Agua post's commanding officer, Sergeant Schaffer, who was included among the former.

A Japanese man was found among the dead, as were two Carranzista soldiers, a fact which was seen <b>as</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> the Carranzistas had been supporting the Plan of San Diego.
