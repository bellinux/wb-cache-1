40|$|Abstract. This paper {{contrasts}} two existing type-based {{techniques for}} the analysis of authentication protocols. The former, proposed by Gordon and Jeffrey, uses dependent types for nonces and cryptographic keys to statically regulate the way that nonces are created and checked in the <b>authentication</b> <b>exchange.</b> The latter, proposed by the authors, relies on a combination of static and dynamic typing to achieve similar goals. Specifically, the type system employs dependent nonce types to statically define certain tags that determine the typed structure of the messages circulated in the <b>authentication</b> <b>exchange.</b> The type tags are then checked dynamically to verify that each message has the format expected at the corresponding step of the <b>authentication</b> <b>exchange.</b> This paper compares the two approaches, drawing on a translation of tagged protocols, validated by our system, into protocols that type check with Gordon and Jeffrey’s system. This translation gives new insight into the trade-offs between the two techniques, and on their relative expressiveness and precision. In addition, it allows us to port verification techniques from one setting to the other. ...|$|E

Authentication based on public key cryptography has an advantage over many other authentication schemes because no secret information has to be shared by the entities involved in the exchange.

40|$|Specification {{documents}} for real-world authentication protocols typically mandate {{some aspects of}} a protocol’s behavior but leave other features optional or undefined. In addition, real-world schemes often include parameter negotiations, authenticate associated data, and support a multiplicity of options. The cryptographic community has routinely elided such matters from our definitions, schemes, and proofs. We propose encompassing them by explicitly modeling the presence of unspecified protocol functionality. To demonstrate, we provide a new treatment for mutual authentication in the public-key setting, doing this in the computational cryptographic tradition. In our model, compactly described in pseudocode, a protocol core (PC) will call out to protocol details (PD), but, for defining security, such calls will be serviced by the adversary.
