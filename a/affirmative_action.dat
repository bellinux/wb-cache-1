5|$|Ginsburg {{has also}} been an {{advocate}} for using foreign law and norms to shape U.S. law in judicial opinions, a view not shared by some of her conservative colleagues. Ginsburg supports using foreign interpretations of law for the persuasive value and possible wisdom, not as precedent which the court is bound to follow. Ginsburg has expressed the view that looking to international law is well-ingrained in tradition in American law, counting John Henry Wigmore and President John Adams as internationalists. Ginsburg's own reliance on international law dates back to her time as an attorney; during her first argument before the court, 1971's Reed v. Reed, she cited two German cases. In her concurring opinion in Grutter v. Bollinger 539 U.S. 306 (2016), a decision upholding Michigan Law School's <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> admissions policy, Ginsburg noted there was accord between the notion that <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> admissions policies would have an end point and agrees with international treaties designed to combat racial and gender based discrimination.|$|E
5|$|Heins {{discusses}} the Supreme Court case Regents of the University of California v.

The case (decided in 1978) upheld <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> in {{the admission of}} minority students as one of several factors to consider, not the primary one. In the lawsuit, the affirmative-action standards at UC Davis School of Medicine were challenged; the school had a policy of holding 16 out of 100 slots for minorities in the incoming class of students, regardless of qualification. Potential student Allan Bakke, a qualified white applicant, challenged the practice after he {{was rejected by the}} school. In an opinion written by Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr., the court ruled against racial quotas at the school while allowing minority status to remain one of several criteria in the admissions process.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Rawls' Justice Theory {{establishes}} {{that a fair}} {{society must}} allow less advantaged people {{to have access to}} the benefits of social cooperation. In this line of thought, the <b>affirmative</b> <b>actions</b> established by Law 12, 711 / 2012 aim at promoting inclusive education in Higher Education. Evaluating the performance of <b>affirmative</b> <b>actions,</b> specifically their impact on the dropout level, has been a theme of debate in scientific literature. Besides representing a personal frustration, dropout is associated with significant academic, social, and economic losses. In this context, this research aims at analyzing whether the adoption of <b>affirmative</b> <b>actions,</b> as established by Law 12, 711 / 2012, affects the dropout rates of students in Accounting Sciences and other courses in the Business field. The study was conducted through documentary research in a Brazilian public Higher Education institution (HEI). The results of binomial analysis showed that out of the 2, 418 students who entered in the first semester of 2013, 520 (22 %) dropped out from university {{until the end of the}} first semester of 2014. It was found that the dropout rate among entrants in the Business field, either through broad competition or using the system of quotas, was 29 %. In the course of Accounting Sciences, the dropout rate among entrants admitted through broad competition was 25 % and using the system of quotas it was 23 %. Contrary to other investigations, this study found that there is no statistical difference between the dropout rates among entrants in the Business and Accounting Sciences fields through broad competition and quotas, suggesting that <b>affirmative</b> <b>actions</b> do not affect significantly the dropout rates...|$|R

5|$|The Supreme Court {{ruled in}} Regents of the University of California v. Bakke (1978) that <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> {{in the form}} of racial quotas in public {{university}} admissions was a violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; however, race could be used as one of several factors without violating of the Equal Protection Clause or Title VI. In Gratz v. Bollinger (2003) and Grutter v. Bollinger (2003), the Court considered two race-conscious admissions systems at the University of Michigan. The university claimed that its goal in its admissions systems was to achieve racial diversity. In Gratz, the Court struck down a points-based undergraduate admissions system that added points for minority status, finding that its rigidity violated the Equal Protection Clause; in Grutter, the Court upheld a race-conscious admissions process for the university's law school that used race as one of many factors to determine admission. In Fisher v. University of Texas (2013), the Court ruled that before race {{can be used in a}} public university's admission policy, there must be no workable race-neutral alternative. In Schuette v. Coalition to Defend <b>Affirmative</b> <b>Action</b> (2014), the Court upheld the constitutionality of a state constitutional prohibition on the state or local use of <b>affirmative</b> <b>action.</b>|$|E

Even if the Constitution of 1988 doesn’t include an express mention to the so-called Ações Afirmativas, they must be considered in line with the Constitution: the reference to right-principle to equality (interpreted {{in the light of the}} democratic and inclusive process that has characterized the works of the Constituent Assembly in the two years 1987 - 88) and the individuation of specific categories of “weak subjects” constitute sufficient elements to acknowledge the constitutional legitimacy.

40|$|In {{this article}} I {{reflect on the}} {{controversy}} generated in the higher education expansion context in Brazil by the quotas measure for black and indigenous students at the University, {{to see what the}} discourses reveal about the perceptions of <b>affirmative</b> <b>actions.</b> To do this, I analyze two manifestos delivered to the National Congress in 2006 by Brazilian intellectuals who laid their position publicly in relation to the quota policy. The analysis, guided by a conception of Bakhtinian language, shows that the concept of “affirmative action” appeared in dispute: first it is taken as a racist measure and it is percieved as unequal while on second place it is understood as a measure of racism deconstruction. By characterizing the debate in the Brazilian scenario, I sought to contribute to the construction of a regional overview on race and <b>affirmative</b> <b>actions</b> in the Latin American context...|$|R

5|$|The riots {{caused a}} major change in the government's {{approach}} to racial issues, and led to the introduction of an aggressive <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> policy strongly favouring the Malays, the New Economic Policy (NEP).

However, during the 1990s Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad rejected this approach, with his Bangsa Malaysia policy emphasising a Malaysian instead of Malay identity for the state. During the 2000s decade politicians began stressing ketuanan Melayu again, and publicly chastised government ministers who questioned the social contract.|$|E

Although some agencies, such as the Rural Industrial Development Agency (RIDA), which attempted to aid Malay entrepreneurs, existed, their programs were criticised as being based on handouts and favouring the politically connected. RIDA was renamed as the Majlis Amanah Rakyat (The Indigenous People's Trust Council) or MARA in 1965, and came to symbolise the development of Malay entrepreneurship.|$|E

A investigação foca-se na situação de grupos discriminados por questões de raça e/ou etnia; e que, como consequência disso, situam-se à margem do direito social, {{fundamental}} para o pleno exercício da cidadania a educação. Analisa-se a questão conceitual, teórica e empírica da implantação das políticas públicas de inclusão social sob a modalidade de ações afirmativas, caracterizando sua finalidade, elementos e conteúdos. Apresenta-se um breve histórico da implantação dessas políticas no contexto norte-americano, onde, aliás, essas políticas têm seu nascedouro. Analisa-se comparativamente a validade e a pertinência da adoção dessas políticas e a necessidade de maior permuta internacional, que tenha por objetivo a integração e o estudo comparativo das políticas públicas de ações afirmativas. O trabalho indica e propõe questões que devem ser levadas em conta na intervenção do Estado para garantir, de maneira substancial, o princípio da igualdade de oportunidades.

5|$|While the {{selection}} process is need-blind and race-blind, most of the best high schools and preparatory schools in Brazil are private and very expensive, and represent a majority of admissions in Brazilian public universities, leading to increased inequality in the country. To remedy this, Unicamp introduced in 2004 the Social Inclusion and <b>Affirmative</b> <b>Action</b> Program (PAAIS, in Portuguese Programa de Ação Afirmativa e Inclusão Social) that allows high schoolers coming from public schools to receive a bonus score in their overall vestibular score. While not focused on racial and ethnical factors, over the years, the PAAIS initiative has {{increased the number of}} admission of minorities from public high school, especially black and native-Brazilians, historically the most economical and social fragile groups in Brazil.
