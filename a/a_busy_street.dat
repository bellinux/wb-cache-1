Knox takes him to hospital, where he is diagnosed as a drug addict. Zero is sedated, but becomes agitated when two men enter the hospital lobby; Knox helps him escape, believing his life is in danger. The two men, Wright and Patterson, quarantine the area, as Zero is carrying a highly contagious disease.|$|E

Residents blamed the government. Witnesses in the camp told Reuters by telephone that the mortars hit <b>a</b> <b>busy</b> <b>street</b> as people were preparing a Ramadan meal to end their fast. 26 were killed in Dera'a; of which 13 were killed in the bombardment of Busra al-Harir.|$|E
25|$|La risata (1911, The Laugh) is {{considered}} his first truly Futurist work. He had fully parted with Divisionism, and now {{focused on the}} sensations derived from his observation of modern life. Its public reception was quite negative, compared unfavorably with Three Women, and it was defaced by a visitor, running his fingers through the still fresh paint. Subsequent criticism became more positive, with some considering the painting a response to Cubism. It was purchased by Albert Borchardt, a German collector who acquired 20 Futurist works exhibited in Berlin, including The Street Enters the House (1911) which depicts a woman on a balcony overlooking <b>a</b> <b>busy</b> <b>street.</b> Today the former also {{is owned by the}} Museum of Modern Art, and the latter by the Sprengel Museum in Hanover.|$|E
25|$|A {{few days}} after the attack on Mody, another Indian was beaten into a coma; this time on <b>a</b> <b>busy</b> <b>street</b> corner in Jersey City Heights. The victim, Kaushal Saran, was found {{unconscious}} at Central and Ferry Avenues, near a city park and firehouse, according to police reports. Saran, a licensed physician in India who was awaiting licensing in the United States, was discharged later from University Hospital in Newark. The unprovoked attack left Saran in a partial coma for over a week with severe damage to his skull and brain. In September 1992, Thomas Kozak, Martin Ricciardi, and Mark Evangelista were brought to trial on federal civil rights charges in connection with the attack on Saran. However, the three were acquitted of the charges in two separate trials in 1993. Saran testified at both trials that he could not remember the incident.|$|E

25|$|McCloskey won the 1942 Caldecott Medal for Make Way for Ducklings. The story set in Boston, Massachusetts {{features}} a mallard pair that nests {{on an island}} in the Charles River. After some time raising eight ducklings on the island, the mother leads them to the Public Garden downtown. Famously, a friendly policeman stops traffic for them to cross <b>a</b> <b>busy</b> <b>street.</b> The story soon became a Boston institution. Sculptor Nancy Schön created a bronze version of Mrs. Mallard and the ducklings in 1987, installed along a walkway between pond and street. There thousands of children climb them every year and many more people photograph them; the park is also the annual site of a Make Way for Ducklings Mother's Day parade, featuring hundreds of children dressed in the costumes of their favorite characters. Since 2003 Make Way for Ducklings is the official children's book of Massachusetts.|$|E
25|$|Alison is {{increasingly}} worried about Ben's lack {{of responsibility and}} commitment, and has doubts about the longevity of their relationship. These thoughts are due to her sister's unhappy marriage. Debbie's husband, Pete (Paul Rudd), works as a talent scout for rock bands, but he leaves at odd hours in the night, which makes her suspect he is having an affair. Upon investigating, she learns that he is actually part of a fantasy baseball draft, which he explains he participates in {{to be free from}} Debbie's controlling manner. This results in their separation, and when Ben expresses amusement at Pete's deception, it leads to a heated argument with Alison as they drive to her doctor. Angered, she ejects him from her car and abandons {{him in the middle of}} <b>a</b> <b>busy</b> <b>street.</b> He tracks her down to her appointment and they both start another argument, leading to their own breakup.

25|$|Among {{the crimes}} {{believed}} to have been associated with gang activity was a deadly shooting in May 2003, on <b>a</b> <b>busy</b> <b>street,</b> which may have been in retaliation for a driver having backed his bus into a rival; as revenge, two buses were set on fire in 2004. There was a fatal stabbing in October 2003, as well as another, unrelated stabbing in 2004. In January 2004, the boyfriend of a bus worker was lethally shot {{in what appeared to be}} a bus feud, and in March 2004, a Chinatown bus operator was killed in another fatal shooting. In a June 2004 incident tied to criminal gangs, two people—a Chinatown bus driver and a bystander—were murdered in a bar in Flushing, Queens, and another was shot in the leg. The accused shooter was arrested in Toronto in 2011 and extradited to the United States. After the 2004 shootings, the New York City Police Department started enforcing Chinatown bus rules more strictly.|$|E

25|$|By 2012, the Cázares {{claimed the}} Tamaulipas agency had not {{questioned}} potential suspects or eyewitnesses of the kidnapping, nor had they visited the locations {{relevant to the}} case. The Cázares have insisted that authorities should start by investigating the house they were taken following their kidnapping, given that it is located just {{a block away from}} <b>a</b> <b>busy</b> <b>street</b> in Matamoros. In March 2012, an electricity bill was found {{on the door of the}} premises. The bill showed that the service was used exponentially during the month the family was kidnapped, and that the last time someone paid the bill was on January 2011. A neighbor who lived near the house where the Cázares were held hostage said he did not know who the owners of the property were but did acknowledge seeing suspicious activity during the evenings. On March 7, about 10 months after the mass kidnapping, Gérald Martin, the General Consul of France in Mexico, told the Cázares family that a squadron of Mexico's Federal Police had been dispatched to Matamoros to work directly on the case. The family claims, however, that were not sure if the investigation was actually carried out. They said they did not receive any documents of the investigation. By October 2012, a criminal court in Jalisco under judge Francisco Martín Hernández Zaragoza was assigned to investigate the case. The family claims they do not know the details of the investigation.|$|E
500|$|... "Come into My World" [...] was {{released}} as {{the fourth and}} final single off the album on 11 November 2002. It generated a favourable response from music critics, who enjoyed its lyrical content. Commercially, the single performed fairly well and peaked in the top 10 in Australia, Belgium (French-speaking Wallonia region), and the United Kingdom. In the United States, the song peaked at number 91 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. It received a gold certification in Australia for sales of 35,000 units. An accompanying music video for the song was directed by Michel Gondry and features Minogue strolling around <b>a</b> <b>busy</b> <b>street</b> in Paris, France; every time she completes a full circle, a duplicate of her appears {{through one of the}} stores, {{and by the end of}} the video there are four Minogues present together.|$|E
500|$|... "City of Blinding Lights" [...] was {{performed}} on every night of the Vertigo Tour, opening 86 of the 131concerts and a public dress rehearsal immediately before its launch. Performances frequently began with confetti falling from the ceiling, serving as a bridge to engage the audience. The song made extensive use of the stage's LED curtains for its visual effects; Wired noted that [...] "they do a fine imitation of Shinjuku on speed, and the lighting design for 'City of Blinding Lights' takes advantage of that... the visual effect manages {{to be far more}} [...] the sum of its parts." [...] The Vancouver Sun described the result as [...] "akin to <b>a</b> <b>busy</b> <b>street</b> at night through a misted windshield", later saying it provided [...] "a theme for the night – the sparse, elegant stage was constantly bathed in vivid colours". During the Vertigo Tour, the piano introduction was played by Adam Clayton on a keyboard. Sound engineer Joe O'Herlihy believed Clayton's bass in the live setting to be [...] "the driving implement that pushes the sound along".|$|E
