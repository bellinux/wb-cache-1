Loans are a bank’s primary <b>asset</b> <b>category</b> and when loan quality becomes suspect, {{the foundation of a}} bank is shaken to the core. While always an issue for banks, declining asset quality has become a big problem for financial institutions.There are several reasons for this, one of which is the lax attitude some banks have adopted because of the years of “good times.” The potential for this is exacerbated by the reduction in the regulatory oversight of banks and in some cases depth of management. Problems are more likely to go undetected, resulting in {{a significant impact on the}} bank when they are discovered. In addition, banks, like any business, struggle to cut costs and have consequently eliminated certain expenses, such as adequate employee training programs.|$|E

By combining the data from the 1992, 1995, 1998, 2001 and 2004 Survey of Consumer Finances, this study investigated racial differences in households' financial asset allocation over the years. This study categorized the financial assets into four categories: equities held directly or indirectly, bonds held directly or indirectly, cash account and other financial asset. Based on Heckman Selection model, the probability of having each financial <b>asset</b> <b>category</b> and the ratio of financial asset invested in each category were regressed on year, race, other demographic variables (age, education, gender, marital status and number of kids), socio-economic variables (income, wealth, working status, having defined benefit plans vs. having defined contribution plans, inheritance, homeownership and business ownership) and an attitudinal factor (risk tolerance). Race has four categories: white, black, Hispanic and others. To fully analyze racial differences in holding each of the four financial asset categories, 20 interaction terms of the four racial categories and five years (1992, 1995, 1998, 2001 and 2004) are included in each model to examine the racial differences in holding of each financial <b>asset</b> <b>category</b> over time...|$|E

In particular, the 20 % <b>asset</b> <b>category,</b> which primarily includes government agency securities is associated with increases in market risk, indicating assets in this category are exposed to higher interest rate risk and prepayment risk. The market risk is lower for those institutions who concentrate on one-to-four family residential mortgages, suggesting home mortgages are well collateralized assets with low perceived credit risk. The off-balance sheet activities on average exhibit no significant impact on market risk. The results also suggest that the market perception of the insurer's expected liability is heavily influenced by Tier 1 capital ratio. ...|$|E

40|$|I {{examine the}} {{determinants}} {{and consequences of}} corporate pension plan investments in hedge funds and private equity, {{commonly referred to as}} ‘alternative assets’. I find that highly leveraged firms with low market-to-book ratios and volatile earnings performance are more likely to invest in alternative assets, indicating that financially constrained firms choose alternative investments to increase asset returns and minimize pension contributions. I also find a nonlinear relationship between plan funding status and alternative investing – very underfunded and well-funded plans are less likely to make alternative investments compared to moderately underfunded plans, suggesting that such plan sponsors may avoid these investments to minimize contribution volatility. I find that plans with alternative investments earn higher returns in the pre-crisis period, but also perform more poorly during the crisis period, suggesting that the potential diversification benefits from investing in this <b>asset</b> <b>category</b> may be overstated. ...|$|E
