50|$|Economic <b>adjustment</b> <b>efforts</b> {{during this}} period were impeded by the {{recurrence}} of drought in 1984 and 1985 along with {{the closure of the}} land border with Nigeria from 1984 to 1986. Niger's dependence on external financial assistance was increased. Relations with the United States (by now the country's principal source of food aid) assumed considerable importance. Meanwhile, a period of renewed tension between Niger and Libya had fueled Libyan accusations of the persecution of the light-skinned, nomadic Tuareg population by the Kountché regime. In May 1985, following an armed incident near the Niger-Libya border, all non-Nigerien Tuaregs were expelled from the country.|$|E
50|$|Austerity {{measures}} {{imposed by}} the Busia administration, although wise in the long run, alienated influential farmers, who until then had been PP supporters. These measures were part of Busia's economic structural <b>adjustment</b> <b>efforts</b> to put the country on a sounder financial base. The austerity programmes had been recommended by the International Monetary Fund. The recovery measures also severely affected {{the middle class and}} the salaried work force, both of which faced wage freezes, tax increases, currency devaluations, and rising import prices. These measures precipitated protests from the Trade Union Congress. In response, the government sent the army to occupy the trade union headquarters and to block strike actions—a situation that some perceived as negating the government's claim to be operating democratically.|$|E
50|$|Djibouti has {{experienced}} stable {{economic growth in}} recent years as a result of achievements in macroeconomic <b>adjustment</b> <b>efforts.</b> Fiscal adjustment measures included downsizing the civil service, implementing a pension reform that placed the system on a much stronger financial footing, and strengthening public expenditure institutions. From 2003 to 2005, annual real GDP growth averaged 3.1 percent driven by good performance in the services sector and strong consumption. Inflation has been kept low (only 1 percent in 2004, compared with 2.2 percent in 2003), due to the fixed peg of the Djibouti franc to the US dollar. However, as mentioned above, unemployment has remained high at over 40 percent in recent years. Djibouti's gross domestic product expanded by an average of more than 6 percent per year, from US$341 million in 1985 to US$1.5 billion in 2015.|$|E

40|$|When {{comparing}} {{the speed and}} extent of economic development in different geographic {{regions of the world}} over the past 20 years, the under-average performance of Arab countries in general and Arab Mediterranean countries in particular is striking. This is despite an overall favorable geo-strategic situation at the crossroads of three continents, with excellent connections to sea and waterways and in direct proximity to the European Union, one of the world’s economic hubs. It is also despite the minor importance of negative factors such as a high-burden diseases or high levels of ethnic fractionalization. In this paper, I focus on identifying the most important constraints on Arab Mediterranean economic development. I use state-of-the-art econometric tools to quantify constraints that have been identified through economic theory and studies of the political economy characteristics of the region. The empirical results offer support for the central hypothesis that limited technological capacities and political economy structures are the primary constraints on economic development. With a view to international structural <b>adjustment</b> <b>efforts,</b> my findings imply that the limited success of the Euro-Mediterranean policy to stimulate the economic development of the Arab Mediterranean countries might be because structural <b>adjustment</b> <b>efforts</b> do not tackle—or at least do not sufficiently tackle— these constraints. economic development, quantitative analysis, political economy, Arab countries...|$|E

We compare direct forgiveness and buybacks on the secondary debt market, and we show that this two modes of debt relief are equivalent if buybacks are financed by loans of IFI that are seniors. If loans of IFI are juniors, these operations are inconsistent with the situation of the debtor and lead private creditors to refuse all financing to a country with an important cost of the adjustment.

Under these programs, the Togolese Government introduced a series of austerity measures and major restructuring goals for the state enterprise and rural development sectors.

Togo made good progress under the international financial institutions' programs in the late 1980s, but movement on reforms ended with the onset of political instability in 1990. With a new, elected government in place, Togo negotiated new 3-year programs with the World Bank and IMF in 1994.|$|R

Thus, in cases of uncertainty, it is highly advisable to implement preliminary adaptations in the field before adapting an entire computer-based test.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model to}} explain how IMF programmes can catalyse private capital flows following a financial crisis, a concept {{that was at the}} heart of the IMF's strategy for dealing with capital account crises in the late 1990 s. In the model, the IMF lends funds below the prevailing market interest rate and it is this subsidy that induces the borrowing country to exert <b>adjustment</b> <b>effort</b> to avoid default. By preventing default, future marginal rates of return on investment are kept high, thereby encouraging private capital flows. The IMF may also have a signalling role if it has superior information about debtor type and can affect the interest rate charged in the immediate aftermath of a crisis. In practice, however, IMF programmes based on the catalytic approach have been disappointing and actual private capital flows have been considerably below those projected. Therefore, the paper also considers how capital flows derived from the model are sensitive to the assumptions made. The paper concludes by discussing the policy implications of the analysis for IMF programme design. ...|$|R
