5|$|Newton {{wrote the}} words from {{personal}} experience. He grew up without any particular religious conviction, but his life's path {{was formed by}} a variety of twists and coincidences that were often put into motion by his recalcitrant insubordination. He was pressed (conscripted) into service in the Royal Navy, and after leaving the service, he became involved in the Atlantic slave trade. In 1748, a violent storm battered his vessel off the coast of County Donegal, Ireland, so severely that he called out to God for mercy, <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>that</b> marked his spiritual conversion. He continued his slave trading career until 1754 or 1755, when he ended his seafaring altogether and began studying Christian theology.|$|E
5|$|As Rosenbaum {{describes}} it, Lex views Lana as this beautiful, charming {{girl with}} a little naïveté. It is this naïveté that allows Lex {{to believe that he}} can trust and confide in Lana, and that she is his one true love. Lex also knows that Lana will always love Clark, but he expects her to love him for who he is just the same. Rosenbaum does not believe that Lana gives that to Lex. Writer Holly Harold finds parallels between Lex's relationship with Lana, and that of Lionel's relationship with Martha. Both men believe that these two women will be their saving grace, and pull them back from the dark side. In Lex's defense, Rosenbaum contends that Lex is not using Lana in an effort to hurt Clark, but that he really does love her. The actor believes that Lex's problem {{lies in the fact that}} every time he has loved someone and opened up to them he has been hurt, or betrayed. Even though Lex loves Lana more than anyone else before her, he just cannot bring himself to open up completely for fear of repeating the past. Rosenbaum believes that the eventual dissolution of the marriage between Lex and Lana was a tragic moment in both characters' lives. It is <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>that</b> solidifies Lex's history of opening up to women and having them hurt him.|$|E
25|$|In round seven, {{however, the}} 104,943 in {{attendance}} witnessed <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>that</b> would {{live on in}} boxing history. With Tunney trapped against the ropes and near a corner, Dempsey unleashed a combination of punches that floored the champion. Two rights and two lefts landed on Tunney's chin and staggered him, and four more punches deposited him on the canvas. It {{was the first time}} in Tunney's career that he'd been knocked down.|$|E
6000|$|CRAMPTON (looking {{steadily}} at her). Indeed? That's surprising. You {{meet your}} father after eighteen years; {{and you actually}} {{want to speak to}} him for <b>a</b> <b>moment!</b> <b>That's</b> touching: isn't it? (He rests his head on his hands, and looks down and away from her, in gloomy reflection.) ...|$|R

25|$|In 1947, Turner {{appeared}} in all 12 games for a Bears team that compiled an 8–4 record and finished {{in second place}} in the NFL Western Division. During the 1947 season, Turner intercepted a Sammy Baugh pass and returned it 96 yards for a touchdown, <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>that</b> Turner later selected as the highlight of his career. At the end of the season, he was picked as a first-team All-Pro by the AP, NYDN, and PFI.|$|E
25|$|Matsuōmaru's wife, Chiyo, {{arrives at}} the school {{to pick up her}} son, and Genzō and Tonami fear for <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>that</b> they may have to kill her too, rather than reveal their deception. But Matsuōmaru himself arrives, and {{explains}} to all involved that the boy killed was his own son, and that he did this intentionally, in order to make up for his past transgressions against Kan Shōjō and the Court, and his involvement in Shihei's schemes.|$|E
25|$|The Salinas {{prepare to}} attend a ball, {{one of the most}} {{important}} of the Palermo social season. The Prince is both excited and concerned about the evening to come. It will be the first time Angelica and her beauty are to be presented to the public. However, he remains concerned that Don Calogero will make a complete fool of both himself and the Salinas. When Angelica (looking beautiful) and Don Calogero (looking acceptable) arrive shortly after, Angelica, thanks to detailed training in etiquette given to her by Tancredi, makes a huge social success. The Prince, after being satisfied that Angelica has been accepted, wanders through the rooms of the Palazzo Ponteleone where the ball is being held, becoming increasingly gloomy at the callowness of the young men, the boredom in the older men, and the silliness of the girls. The Prince notices Tancredi and Angelica dancing happily together, oblivious to the other's desperation, ambition, and greed. As he watches, the Prince comes to realize and accept, if only for <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>that</b> whatever happiness the lovers feel is to be celebrated, no matter what.|$|E

25|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity at {{the risk}} of his life above and {{beyond the call of duty}} while serving with a marine division, in action against enemy Japanese forces during extremely hazardous landing operations at Cape Torokina, Bougainville, Solomon Islands, on 1 November 1943. Forced to pass within disastrous range of a strongly protected, well-camouflaged Japanese 75-mm. regimental gun strategically located on the beach, our landing units were suffering heavy losses in casualties and boats while attempting to approach the beach, and the success of the operations was seriously threatened. Observing the ineffectiveness of marine rifle and grenade attacks against the incessant, devastating fire of the enemy weapon and aware of the urgent need for prompt action, Sgt. Owens unhesitatingly determined to charge the gun bunker from the front and, calling on 4 of his comrades to assist him, carefully placed them to cover the fire of the 2 adjacent hostile bunkers. Choosing <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>that</b> provided a fair opportunity for passing these bunkers, he immediately charged into the mouth of the steadily firing cannon and entered the emplacement through the fire port, driving the guncrew out of the rear door and insuring their destruction before he himself was wounded. Indomitable and aggressive in the face of almost certain death, Sgt. Owens silenced a powerful gun which was of inestimable value to the Japanese defense and, by his brilliant initiative and heroic spirit of self-sacrifice, contributed immeasurably to the success of the vital landing operations. His valiant conduct throughout reflects the highest credit upon himself and the U.S. Naval Service.|$|E
500|$|The game's {{graphics}} and audio were not well-received, with IGN commenting, [...] "There's never <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>that</b> makes you {{step back and}} say wow. The textures are muted, the Predator looks alright, but everything is pretty forgettable." ...|$|E
500|$|Before {{the episode}} aired, a {{photograph}} depicting Tony and Ziva dancing while in Germany was released and promoted, and Glasberg commented, [...] "This {{is a very}} personal moment of vulnerability where her guard goes down and she lets herself melt into his arms. I think it's <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>that</b> our Tiva fans will truly enjoy." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{final scene}} in the episode, {{featuring}} Bart and Lisa fighting in the arena, has received overwhelmingly positive remarks from reviewers. Canning wrote that it was [...] "a classic moment for the series [...] This almost felt like <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>that</b> could have closed out the series." [...] Hughes commented that it was [...] "the best moment of the night" [...] as it [...] "would have been a typical ending" [...] {{if it had not}} added the twist preceding the credits. Melissa and Randall Baker of TV Guide magazine said that the scene was a moment of [...] "girl power", as Lisa knocks out Bart easily with one punch.|$|E
500|$|The young Max {{was exposed}} to music early on, {{attending}} Broadway shows weekly {{from the age of}} two and liking the big sound put forth by the pit orchestras. He then liked the rhythms of country and western music. He knew {{he wanted to be a}} drummer from the age of five, when he saw Elvis Presley and his drummer, D. J. Fontana, appear on The Milton Berle Show in April 1956. Decades later, Weinberg said, [...] "I think anybody who wanted to develop a life in rock 'n' roll music had <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> <b>That</b> was my moment," [...] and Fontana became a major influence on him.|$|E
500|$|In a Top 100 list {{compiled}} by VH1 and Entertainment Weekly in 2000, Jackson's performance was ranked as the sixth greatest rock 'n' roll TV moment. Five years later, Entertainment Weekly named Jackson's Motown 25 performance {{as one of}} the most important pop culture moments in history. [...] "It was <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>that</b> crossed over in a way that no live musical performance ever had. There was a messianic quality to it", Entertainment Weekly editor Steve Daly commented. The performance has been shown on television numerous times. It is also featured on the DVDs: HIStory on Film, Volume II and the bonus DVD of Thriller 25.|$|E

500|$|Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode an A, {{explaining}} [...] "Horror. Confusion. It's <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>that</b> finds Fringe at its finest". New York Magazines Tim Grierson loved all {{the interactions between}} Noble and Weller, and thought they were so [...] "compelling together that they helped justify an episode that could have very easily been terribly hokey — instead, {{it was one of}} the season’s best standalone stories". Josh Wigler from MTV also thought the scenes between Noble and Weller were the best thing about the episode. Jane Boursaw of TV Squad wrote it was [...] "another great episode that served to propel the story forward, and another great performance by John Noble". Television Without Pity gave the episode a B+.|$|E
500|$|The {{scene where}} Ray Patterson is {{reinstated}} (to which he enters and exits to the Sanford and Son theme song) was {{a reference to}} <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>that</b> occurred during a stand up show of comedian Redd Foxx (who starred on Sanford and Son). During a show in Vegas, Redd Foxx came on stage to the Sanford and Son theme song, {{only to find that}} there were very few people in the audience. Foxx angrily stated that he refused to do a show with such a small audience and walked off the stage. The house orchestra, puzzled by Foxx's leaving, simply played him off with the Sanford and Son theme song again. The same incident was the basis for the joke in [...] "The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons" [...] where Moe Szyslak walks onto the stage and, without breaking his stride, walks off.|$|E
500|$|The family {{returned}} to Downe on 27 August, and Darwin again {{wrote to the}} Gardeners' Chronicle appealing for assistance as he was [...] "very anxious to examine a few exotic forms". His requests to the wealthy enthusiasts who had taken up the fashionable pursuit of growing rare orchids brought large numbers of specimens. These would be a test of his theory: previously aspects such as coloration {{of plants and animals}} had often been regarded as having no adaptive function. For example, Thomas Henry Huxley was strongly influenced by German idealism and in 1856 had asked if it was [...] "to be supposed for <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>that</b> the beauty of colour and outline... are any good to the animals?... Who has ever dreamed of finding an utilitarian purpose in the forms and colours of flowers... ?" [...] Darwin had, and in the orchids he tackled the most difficult case. His ideas would transform the way naturalists thought about coloration.|$|E

500|$|Zinta's next {{release of}} 2006 was Shirish Kunder's romantic musical Jaan-E-Mann, a story {{set in the}} United States about two men, played by Salman Khan and Akshay Kumar, who love the same woman. The film opened to mixed reviews from critics and its {{eventual}} box office profit was poor. Zinta {{played the role of}} Piya, the cynosure of two men. She was mostly criticised for taking a role of minimal importance, though her performance was generally well received. Raja Sen labelled her role an [...] "ornament throughout," [...] but further stated that she [...] "comes vividly alive in the film's last scene, <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>that</b> makes you lament why filmmakers today don't let the babyfaced actress have more fun instead of forcing her to sob copiously. She doesn't have much to do in Jaan-E-Mann, but looks appropriately attractive." [...] Zinta said that the film was a great relief after the more emotionally intense Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna, as Jaan-E-Mann was [...] "easy, happy and much more simple".|$|E
500|$|Tessa's death {{occurs in}} the fourth episode of the second season; [...] "The Darkness". The {{creative}} staff decided Tessa would die in a random carjacking incident. Tessa's death played {{no role in the}} episode's main storyline. It was not formulaic; the writers wanted to shock the audience. Abramowitz said that [...] "...it would have been easier to kill her off in the episode," [...] but the writers [...] "...wanted it to be a surprise and show how shocking [...] was to [...]" [...] Horvath said that [...] "...losing a loved one to a random act of violence isn't something that only happens to television action heroes or Immortals or people in another type of life, it happens in the real world too- totally unexpectedly, at <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>that</b> makes no sense dramatically." [...] Tessa's death scene shows MacLeod kneeling next to Tessa and holding her corpse, then Richie reviving as an Immortal and speaking with MacLeod.|$|E
500|$|... {{utterance}} of 'you're my James Dean / {{you make}} me feel like I'm seventeen' on 'Rather Die Young' is made tolerable by her honeyed vocal slides. Certainly, the 'bad boy' Beyoncé is in love with is more a physical representation of countless painfully banal fantasies about guys who 'drive too fast' and 'smoke too much' than an actual person, but at least it feels tangible. For once, the pop song trying to make a connection with its listener doesn't feel like a total fraud. Forget Lady Gaga's song about her relationship with her father or Britney Spears' lullaby to her babies – here, I'm convinced, if only for <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>that</b> Beyoncé really would rather die young than to live her life without her lover, that she cares, even if you don't. This doesn't fully explain why 4 is as enjoyable as it is, but it does convey just how convincing Beyoncé can be when given the right tools – {{and it turns out that}} those tools consist of not much more than Beyoncé's voice itself.|$|E
