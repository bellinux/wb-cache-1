500|$|Initially, {{the song}} [...] "Everyone's at It" [...] was {{announced}} {{to be released}} as the lead single from the album, but it was ultimately decided on [...] "The Fear". While discussing It's Not Me, It's You, Allen stated that her intention was to make [...] "bigger sounding, more ethereal songs, real songs. [...] I think I've grown up a bit {{as a person and}} I hope it reflects that." [...] She released a demo version of the song, which was then called [...] "I Don't Know", onto her Myspace account, along with another song, [...] "I Could Say", in April 2008. The singer declared about the inspiration for the song, which has to do with materialism and the pressures of being rich and famous: [...] tell you where the inspiration for it came from. I was walking down this street, in this village {{in the middle of the}} countryside in the U.K., and there was this little girl who must have been eight or nine, walking down the street with her mum in, like, high-waisted hot pants and a little crop top. And I just thought, 'That's not really right.' <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> she was the kind of girl that would be trying out for Pop Idol in five years time, and wants to be famous when she grows up. And there's definitely the whole culture of that where I come from, and it's not necessarily a culture that I think is particularly healthy. But at the same time, I'm very aware that I am a part of that culture – but it's not something that I feel particularly comfortable with.|$|E

Some witnesses located on higher mountainside locations, such as Loveland Pass at , reported seeing it flying below them. Crash survivor Rick Stephens {{was a senior}} guard and stated in 2013, [...] "...as we flew along over I-70, that there were old mines and old vehicles above us. I noticed we were quite a bit below {{the top of the}} mountains. [...] I got up to go to the cockpit, which wasn't unusual to do, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> we were in trouble, looking out the window and seeing nothing but green in front of us." ...|$|E

The album was {{certified}} gold by the RIAA with 500,000 copies shipped as of February 1, 2008. Regarding the album's sales in 2010, Corgan stated that the album [...] "went gold. But people didn't listen to it. I could tell that people weren't listening to the album. In the past if you put out an album, people at least knew the first song. We {{would go out and}} play [...] "Doomsday Clock" [...] <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> that they hadn't even listened to it. I don't view it as a gross disappointment. It's disappointing to me that what I was trying to communicate didn't get the chance to be communicated." ...|$|E

2500|$|On February 5, 1985, twin {{brothers}} Bill and Bob Clark sighted a 60+ {{foot long}} sea serpent in San Francisco Bay that crashed onto a submerged rocky ledge only 20 {{yards away from}} where {{they were sitting in}} their car. It was around 7:45 a.m. and the water was calm. The Clark brothers were sitting in their car drinking coffee when they noticed a group of seals in the water. Then they noticed what they thought was another seal approach the group. The group of seals began to swim away and one of them headed for the seawall where the Clarks were parked. The seals were followed by the creature and according to Bob, [...] "Bill started saying it was moving strange. He said it was not a seal, it's a snake." [...] Bob continued, [...] "We watched it coming in, undulating in a vertical manner. Where most snakes undulate side to side, this was up and down, creating humps in the water. Bob said, [...] "The seals were leaping through the water in front of it. I think it was going to eat them. It was behind the seals arched above the water line <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> it was a large animal when the arch appeared to stay in one spot. I could see the body moving through the arch." [...] The Clarks said the water was so clear that morning they could easily see the creature as it undulated at amazing speed like an uncoiling whip. [...] They both estimated the length of the creature to be at least 60 feet. As it swam over the submerged rocky ledge it stopped dead in its tracks then it appeared to slide a few feet across the water creating a light spray. It apparently got stuck on the rocks. Bob said the animal turned clockwise and exposed its midsection. [...] "It turned over like a corkscrew in midsection. We could see the belly of the animal. It reminded me of an alligator stomach, creamy white, soft leathery looking, but with a tint of yellow in it." [...] He continued saying, [...] "After it twisted over and showed the underbelly, another section behind the underbelly came up about three feet out of the water. I got an excellent view of a fin-type appendage, which opened up like an accordion fan. It stayed up about five seconds, long enough for me to tell my brother, 'Bill, I'm going to look at it as long as I can so I can remember it.' [...] " [...] After it twisted the midsection off of the submerged rocky ledge, Bill said they watched the creature sit [...] "motionless in the water for five or ten seconds". Then it began to swim away, using a [...] "violent, downward thrust of its upper neck which sent a pack of coils backwards towards the midsection. After a few seconds of undulations, the creature moved rapidly, just {{below the surface of the}} water northward toward deeper water in the middle of the Bay." [...] Bill concluded his account by saying, [...] "I don't care if anyone believes me. I know what I saw. It was too mind-blowing and close to me not to say something about it." ...|$|E

60|$|During {{this time}} I saw Steele twice, at night {{out in our}} rendezvous.

60|$|He paused <b>and,</b> why <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell,</b> <b>I</b> grew weak {{with fear}} of I knew not what, and bethought me of flight.|$|R
60|$|It was {{one o'clock}} {{the next morning}} before Guest and I turned homeward to our rooms, for we had thought it well to separate, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> him what had passed between Lady Dennisford and myself.

6000|$|... "Well," [...] she said, [...] "I {{knew the}} time would come when I {{would be called}} upon, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> many a story about things that have {{happened}} to me.

60|$|In our own country, in the {{unsettled}} {{parts of}} many of the States, the black bear is still quite common; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> you of places where, if you pushed carefully up mountain-paths and through lonely forests, you might come upon a fine black bear, sitting at the entrance of her cave, with two or three of her young ones playing about her.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{overlook}} that as I should your {{breaking into}} my house if you saw it was on fire.

60|$|She done it, too; and {{she done}} it {{beautiful}}. She done it so beautiful {{it was good}} to hear; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> wished <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> her a thousand lies, so she could do it again.|$|R
60|$|Then {{began the}} voice {{of it in the}} {{dripping}} stillness, a tramping of weary feet, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> that this advancing shadow was formed of men, millions of them moving all at one speed, very slowly, as if regulated by the march of the most tired among them. They had blotted out the road, now, from a few yards away to the horizon; and suddenly, in the dusk, a face showed.|$|E

They are too clever for us unaided. I could take Mademoiselle Delora to Scotland Yard to-day, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> them what we fear.

60|$|In the {{foreground}} I saw the youth who had discovered us, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> {{from the way}} he carried himself that he was quite overcome by his own importance. The warriors about him were all fine looking fellows, though shorter and squatter than the Sarians or the Amozites. Their color, too, was a bit lighter, owing, no doubt, to the fact that much of their lives is spent within the shadow of the world that hangs forever above their country.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, lad, I'm goin' {{with the}} committee, more to tell 'em what {{they ought to}} do, as you might say, than to serve as a private soldier, for you see I know Ticonderoga root <b>and</b> branch. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> you the whole story from the meanin' of the name down to who is in command of it this very minute, if there was time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{when it was}} done, Esther," [...] said my darling, [...] "I {{was always}} {{thinking}} how to tell you {{and what to do}} for the best. <b>And</b> sometimes <b>I</b> thought you ought to know it directly, <b>and</b> sometimes <b>I</b> thought you ought not to know it and keep it from my cousin John; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> what to do, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> fretted very much." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'They {{ought to}} know. I felt myself a wicked hypocrite when Wilmet {{would come and}} read me the Psalms, <b>and</b> yet <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> her. Tell them, Felix; I cannot bear it without.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Enough of this fooling," [...] was his not {{inappropriate}} exordium. [...] "To business. Mark me closely. I am an Australian. My name is John Dickson, {{though you}} mightn't think {{it from my}} unassuming appearance. You will be relieved to hear that I am rich, sir, very rich. You can't go into {{this sort of thing}} too thoroughly, Pitman; the whole secret is preparation, and I can get up my biography from the beginning, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> it you now, only I have forgotten it." ...|$|E
6000|$|Above {{the roar}} and {{crackling}} of the unquenchable fire, my ear, quickened by the straits in which I lay, caught just once {{the sound of}} the words they were saying. I had learnt a fair amount of Hawaiian since my arrival, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> that in their talk [...] "the anger of Pélé," [...] "victim" [...] and [...] "stranger," [...] occurred frequently. Could it be that they meant deliberately to leave me there unaided to die? Were they afraid to meddle with the prisoners of the goddess? ...|$|E
60|$|Adventures {{are to the}} adventurous. They abound {{on every}} side; but only the chosen few {{have the courage to}} embrace them. And they will not come to you: you must go out to seek them. Then they meet you half-way, and rush into your arms, for they know their true lovers. There were eight Blighted Fraus at the Home for Lost Ideals, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> by simple {{inspection}} that they had not had an average of half an adventure per lifetime between them. They sat and knitted still, like Awful Examples.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't blame yourself, dear," [...] remonstrated the girl, [...] "when {{it was all}} my fault. <b>I</b> begged <b>and</b> begged {{and begged}} until you had to consent, and I'm not sorry either--if nothing happens to you because of our coming.

60|$|Darius {{was always}} ready to spin a yarn, which was much in his favor {{according}} to my way of thinking; but he couldn't seem to rattle the words off easy like except when his mouth was full of tobacco, therefore Jerry <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> always <b>tell</b> whether the story was to be long or short, {{by the amount of}} roughly-cured plug he stowed between his jaws.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am her bondman," [...] he said, [...] "body <b>and</b> soul. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> you at {{this moment}} whether I hate her or love her the more; but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not live without seeing her." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{that chair}} I had {{anticipated}} this scene {{more than once}} of late.

So now I was only repeating the tale, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> it without emotion, because it was nigh nineteen years old; and I did not look at Gavin, for I knew that his manner of taking it could bring no change to me.|$|E
60|$|Had {{there been}} secrets, the {{presence}} of a stool in the dungeons would have kept the men quiet, As it was, having all sworn to tell the truth, they talked openly before Ignatius Irvine. The one great puzzle was the dynamite, of which they were as much in the dark as was I. They appealed to me. If I knew anything about the dynamite they begged me to confess it and save them all from further misery. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> them only the truth, that I knew of no dynamite.|$|E
60|$|The Fire-Men squatted {{around the}} fire and slept with their heads bowed forward on their knees. They did not sleep soundly. Their ears twitched in their sleep, and they were restless.

Lop-Ear <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> them by their sounds. There were wild dogs and a hyena, and for a time there was a great yelping and snarling that awakened on the instant the whole circle of sleeping Fire-Men.|$|E
6000|$|... "My faith, sir," [...] {{said the}} fellow with a shrug, [...] "it might be carrots, <b>and</b> still <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> you. How should I know? The house is kept like a garrison, as you perceive." ...|$|R
6000|$|For a {{long time}} the Indian {{remained}} silent, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> by the expression of his grave face whether my reasoning weighed with him or not; I therefore offered up a brief prayer that the Spirit of God might open his eyes--as well as my own--to see, and our hearts to receive, the truth, whatever that might be. Then I said,--"The thoughts of Big Otter are deep, what do they lead to?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Some half-ludicrous idea of Miss Altifiorla and {{her present}} {{difficulties}} came across her mind, as she contradicted his assertion with another shower of kisses.
