40|$|Peripheral blood normal B {{lymphocytes}} {{were found}} to be poor stimulators in the mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR), in contrast to normal activated B cells which were strong stimulators. This increased capacity to stimulate a strong MLR correlated with an increased expression of the ICAM- 1 (CD 54) molecule on the surface of these cells. Similarly, the capacity of leukaemic B cells to induce an <b>allogenic</b> <b>stimulation</b> in the MLR was limited to the ICAM- 1 (CD 54) positive leukaemic cells. The ability of normal activated or leukaemic B cells to induce an MLR was blocked by antibodies directed against ICAM- 1...|$|E

Spleen cells from AKR mice aged 1 to 10 months produced a significant graft-versus-host reaction when injected into 8 -day-old AKR × C 57 Bl/ 6 F 1 hybrids. Splenic lymphocytes from similarly aged mice were also capable of responding to <b>allogenic</b> <b>stimulation</b> in a mixed lymphocyte reaction. AKR mice aged 1 to 10 months developed a contact sensitivity response to picryl chloride.

40|$|Lung {{transplantation}} is now {{an accepted}} therapeutic option for patients with end-stage lung disease, and an early diagnosis of rejection is essential {{in the management of}} these patients. Adult T-cell leukemia-derived factor (ADF), known as a human homolog of thioredoxin, {{has been shown to be}} induced by a variety of stresses. In this study we examined ADF expression in lung tissues and bronchoalveolar lavage cells after canine lung transplantation to determine whether it could be induced by <b>allogenic</b> <b>stimulations</b> and could be used to diagnose early rejection. Allotransplantations were performed in adult mongrel dogs, and immunosuppression was performed from the day of operation to the fifth postoperative day. No immunosuppressant was given from the sixth to the tenth postoperative days. Animals were put to death on the tenth postoperative day. Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed on the fifth and tenth postoperative days, and the lavage cells and lung tissues were examined immunohistochemically with anti-ADF antibody. The grades of rejection were as follows: grade 1 in two animals, grade 2 in three animals, and grade 3 in two animals. The percentages of ADF high-producer cells in bronchoalveolar lavage cells on the fifth and tenth postoperative days were 4. 29 %± 2. 65 % and 26. 6 %± 3. 99 %, respectively (p< 0. 01). The percentages of ADF high-producer cells in normal healthy dogs and in those with grade 1, grade 2, and grade 3 rejection were 3. 00 %± 6. 50 %, respectively. The percentage in each rejection group was significantly higher than that in normal healthy dogs (p< 0. 05). These results suggest that examination of bronchoalveolar lavage cells with ADF staining may be useful in the early diagnosis of rejection...|$|R
40|$|A girl, 13 {{months of}} age, {{presented}} with generalised granulomatous skin, hair and mucosal candidiasis. Her lymphocytes {{failed to respond}} in vitro to Candida antigen (CA); the intradermal test with CA was also negative. Serum immunoglobulins, complement components, granulocyte functions (phagocytic and fungicidal), T-cell subsets, mitogenic and <b>allogenic</b> lymphocyte <b>stimulation,</b> natural killer cell activity and immune interferon production were all found to be normal. No circulating immune complexes were detected. Ketoconazole, an antimycotic drug, 5 mg/kg twice daily for 1 month and 2. 5 mg/kg twice daily for another month spectacularly cleared all lesions. Afterwards, 4 -monthly injections with transfer factor (TF) were given. Intradermal reactivity to CA was observed after the second TF injection. The lymphocyte responsiveness to CA in vitro became strongly positive 3 months after the last TF injection. The level of CA precipitins in serum, which was very high (11 lines) before ketoconazole treatment, decreased to 4 lines. No serum inhibitor of lymphocyte proliferation to CA could be demonstrated in the patient's serum before or after treatment. This specific CA unresponsiveness was not due to an excess of OKT 8 + (suppressor) cells; macrophage migration inhibiting factor (MIF) production was normal. The nonresponsiveness {{might be due to}} antigenic overload or to suppressor cell induction not demonstrable in the present studies.

40|$|We {{report a}} study on immunoregulation of in vitro {{antibody}} to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) synthesis induced by pokeweed mitogen (PWM) from {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMC) in chronic hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) carriers and in 'high responders' (anti-HBs RIA ratio ≥ 20 in serum), recently boosted with anti-hepatitis B vaccine. Anti-HBs was detected in 11 days PBMC supernatants (SN) from 24 out of 36 'high responders', but in none from 31 chronic HBsAg carriers, despite detectable amounts of polyclonal IgG and antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) were produced. The lack of anti-HBs production by chronic HBsAg carriers {{did not seem to be}} determined by suppressor influences because T lymphocytes from the majority of chronic HBsAg carriers, co-cultured with 'high responders' PBMC did not suppress anti-HBs production. Co-cultures between HBsAg carriers T 4 positive (helper/inducer) cells and allogenic 'high responder' non-T cells produced anti-HBs antibody, indicating that HBsAg carrier T cells are not deficient in this allogenic helper function under PWM <b>stimulation.</b> <b>Allogenic</b> cocultures between HBsAg carrier non-T cells and 'high responder' T 4 positive cells failed in anti-HBs production: a specific B lymphocyte defect might be involved in the lacking anti-HBs synthesis in chronic HBV patients.

A study of lymphocyte markers has shown that 2 - 6 per cent of E rosettes only were recovered in the B cell-enriched population. Lymphocyte stimulation in vitro was obtained with PHA, con A and PWM in unseparated and T-cell populations, but never in B-cell suspensions. Experiments of recombination between the two purified fractions have demonstrated that 10 % of T cells added to B cells were able to induce a response to PHA and PWM.

40|$|Allogeneic {{bone marrow}} {{transplantation}} (BMT) is an effective therapy for hematologic malignancies. However graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a major limiting factor for a successful patient outcome. GVHD {{is a result of}} alloimmune responses of donor T lymphocytes attacking the recipient's cells and tissues. Chemokine receptor CCR 5 plays a role in solid organ allograft rejection and mediates murine GVHD pathogenesis. Herein, we report that infiltrating lymphocytes in the skin of human acute GVHD (aGVHD) samples are predominantly CCR 5 + T cells. In addition, we characterized the features of the CCR 5 expression on alloreactive T lymphocytes. We found that the CCR 5 + population exhibits the characteristics of the activated effector T cell phenotype. CCR 5 expression is upregulated upon <b>allogenic</b> <b>stimulation,</b> and CCR 5 + cells are proliferating with coexpression of T cell activation markers. Furthermore, the activated T cells producing inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α, interleukin (IL) - 2, or interferon (IFN) -γ, are positive for CCR 5. Thus, CCR 5 is a marker for GVHD effector cells and CCR 5 + T cells are active participants in the pathogenesis of human aGVHD...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between expression of Ia antigens or Fc gamma receptors (Fc gamma R) and different cytolytic activities of mixed leukocyte culture (MLC) -activated T-cell populations was studied. Lymphocytes mediating specific lysis of target cells bearing the stimulating alloantigens (CTL) could clearly {{be distinguished from}} cells mediating antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) in that CTL were Fc gamma R- while cells mediating ADCC were Fc gamma R+. In contrast, MLC-generated natural killer (NK) cells were distributed in both the Fc gamma R- and Fc gamma R+ cell fractions. The {{presence or absence of}} Ia antigens did not correlate with any of the cytolytic activities studied. In addition, Fc gamma R- and not Fc gamma R+ cells responded in the secondary MLC. Thus, although Fc gamma R+ cells are generated in large numbers in MLC, they do not appear to play a direct role in specific cytotoxicity nor do they proliferate in response to secondary stimulation. However, their ability, following MLC generation, to mediate NK activity and ADCC, both of which may contribute to in vitro and in vivo lysis of allogeneic cells, might explain their appearance following <b>allogenic</b> <b>stimulation...</b>|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Interleukin- 8 (IL- 8, CXCL 8) {{is readily}} {{produced}} by human malignant cells. Dendritic cells (DC) both produce IL- 8 and express the IL- 8 functional receptors CXCR 1 and CXCR 2. Most human colon carcinomas produce IL- 8. IL- 8 importance in malignancies has been ascribed to angiogenesis promotion. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: IL- 8 effects on human monocyte-derived DC biology were explored upon DC exposure to recombinant IL- 8 {{and with the}} help of an IL- 8 neutralizing mAb. In vivo experiments were performed in immunodeficient mice xenografted with IL- 8 -producing human colon carcinomas and comparatively with cell lines that do not produce IL- 8. <b>Allogenic</b> T lymphocyte <b>stimulation</b> by DC was explored under the influence of IL- 8. DC and neutrophil chemotaxis were measured by transwell-migration assays. Sera from tumor-xenografted mice contained increasing concentrations of IL- 8 as the tumors progress. IL- 8 production by carcinoma cells can be modulated by low doses of cyclophosphamide at the transcription level. If human DC are injected into HT 29 or CaCo 2 xenografted tumors, DC are retained intratumorally in an IL- 8 -dependent fashion. However, IL- 8 did not modify the ability of DC to stimulate T cells. Interestingly, pre-exposure of DC to IL- 8 desensitizes such cells for IL- 8 -mediated in vitro or in vivo chemoattraction. Thereby DC become disoriented to subsequently follow IL- 8 chemotactic gradients towards malignant or inflamed tissue. CONCLUSIONS: IL- 8 as produced by carcinoma cells changes DC migration cues, without directly interfering with DC-mediated T-cell stimulation...|$|R
40|$|Dendritic cells(DC) are {{professional}} antigen presenting cells {{bridging the}} innate and adaptive immune systems by detecting pathogen- and- damage associated molecular pattern(PAMP, DAMP) molecules. This triggers maturation and migration to regional lymph nodes where they stimulate T lymphocytes. In tissues normally exposed to relatively {{high level of}} PAMP molecules, such as the liver, DC have a higher threshold to stimulation and therefore maintain an immature phenotype under conditions that would stimulate DC at other sites. In these studies we tested the hypothesis that interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) /Signal Transducer and Activation of Transcription- 3 (STAT 3) activity increases the activation/maturation threshold of hepatic and bone marrow(BM) DC towards innate immune signals. Results show that liver nuclear STAT 3 activity is significantly higher than other organs and is IL- 6 -dependent. Hepatic DC in normal wild-type(IL- 6 +/+) mice are phenotypically and functionally less mature than DC from IL- 6 -deficient(IL- 6 -/-) or STAT 3 inhibited IL- 6 +/+ mice, as determined by surface marker expression, pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion, and <b>allogenic</b> T-cell <b>stimulation.</b> IL- 6 +/+ liver DC produce IL- 6 in response to exposure to PAMPs, but resist maturation compared to IL- 6 -/- liver DC. Conversely, exogenous IL- 6 inhibits LPS-induced IL- 6 -/- liver DC maturation. Oral antibiotic depletion of commensal gut bacteria in IL- 6 +/+ mice decreased portal blood endotoxin levels, lowered IL- 6 /STAT 3 activity and significantly increased liver DC maturation. BM derived IL- 6 +/+DC with elevated STAT 3 activity are also significantly less mature than IL- 6 -/- BMDC. The reduced maturation was especially pronounced when IL- 6 +/+ BMDC when cultured in elevated IL- 6 conditions. IL- 6 neutralization increased BMDC maturation. Blocking STAT 3 activity increases maturation in IL- 6 +/+ BMDC but not in IL- 6 -/- BMDC, which have low basal STAT 3 activity. Compared to IL- 6 -/- BMDC, IL- 6 +/+ BMDC significantly resisted maturation in response to low concentrations of the PAMP molecules. At higher concentrations of these same ligands stimulation of both IL- 6 +/+ and IL- 6 -/- BMDC induced maturation. In Conclusion, gut-derived bacterial products, by stimulating hepatic IL- 6 /STAT 3 signaling, inhibit hepatic DC activation/maturation. Elevated IL- 6 /STAT 3 activity raises the threshold needed for DC to translate triggers of innate immunity into adaptive immune responses. Manipulating gut bacteria or IL- 6 /STAT 3 activity may therefore be an effective strategy to alter intra-hepatic immune responses...|$|R
40|$|We have {{recently}} demonstrated that heterologous transplantation of horse amniotic membrane-derived mesenchymal cells (AMCs) {{can be useful}} for cell therapy applications in tendon diseases, and hypothesized that these cells may promote tendon repair via paracrine-acting molecules targeting inflammatory processes. To test this hypothesis, here we examined the immunomodulatory characteristics of AMCs and of their conditioned medium (AMC-CM) in vitro, and studied the potential therapeutic effect of AMC-CM in thirteen different spontaneous horse tendon and ligament injuries in vivo. Our results demonstrate that AMCs are capable of inhibiting peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) proliferation after <b>allogenic</b> <b>stimulation</b> either when cocultured in cell-to-cell contact, or when the two cell types are physically separated by a transwell membrane, suggesting that soluble factors are implicated in this phenomenon. Our hypothesis is further supported by the demonstration that PBMC proliferation is inhibited by AMC-CM. In our in vivo studies, no significant adverse effects were observed in treated tendons, and clinical and ultrasonographical evaluation did not reveal evidence of inappropriate tissue or tumor formation. Clinical outcomes were favorable and the significantly lower rate (15. 38 %) of reinjuries observed compared to untreated animals, suggests that treatment with AMC-CM is very efficacious. In conclusion, this study identifies AMC-CM as a novel therapeutic biological cell-free product for treating horse tendon and ligament disease...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Reactivation of HIV- 1 {{expression}} in persistent reservoirs {{together with an}} efficient HAART has been proposed as an adjuvant therapy aimed at reaching a functional cure for HIV. Previously, H 3 K 9 methylation was shown {{to play a major}} role in chromatin-mediated repression of the HIV- 1 promoter. Here, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of histone methyltransferase inhibitors (HMTIs) in reactivating HIV- 1 from latency. DESIGN: We evaluated the reactivation potential of two specific HMTIs (chaetocin and BIX- 01294, two specific inhibitors of Suv 39 H 1 and G 9 a, respectively) in ex-vivo cultures of resting CD 4 T cells isolated from HIV- 1 -infected HAART-treated individuals. METHODS: We measured HIV- 1 recovery in ex-vivo cultures treated with an HMTI alone or in combination with other HIV- 1 inducers (in absence of IL- 2 and of <b>allogenic</b> <b>stimulation)</b> of CD 8 -depleted peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or of resting CD 4 T cells isolated from 67 HIV-infected, HAART-treated patients with undetectable viral load. RESULTS: We demonstrated, for the first time, that chaetocin induced HIV- 1 recovery in 50 % of CD 8 -depleted PBMCs cultures and in 86 % of resting CD 4 T-cell cultures isolated from HIV- 1 -infected, HAART-treated patients, whereas BIX- 01294 reactivated HIV- 1 {{expression in}} 80 % of resting CD 4 T-cell cultures isolated from similar patients. Moreover, we showed that combinatory treatments including one HMTI and either the histone deacetylase inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid or the non-tumor-promoting NF-kappaB inducer prostratin had a higher reactivation potential than these compounds alone. CONCLUSION: Our results constitute a proof-of-concept for the therapeutic potential of HMTIs in strategies aiming at reducing the pool of latent reservoirs in HIV-infected, HAART-treated patient.

40|$|Successful {{in utero}} {{hematopoietic stem cell}} {{transplantation}} represents a potential step forward {{in the management of}} patients with severe inherited hernatological, metabolic and immunological disorders. Animal data from a number of species have demonstrated evidence of engraftment, but to date the only effective in utero transplantations (IUTx) in humans have been performed in fetuses with severe immunodeficiencies, suggesting that the fetal immune system {{play a vital role in}} the success or failure of in utero transplantation. To study the capacity of allogenic response of the human fetus in first and second trimesters, mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) of fetal liver cells (FLC) was performed. FLC were able to recognize and react to <b>allogenic</b> <b>stimulation</b> already from 12 weeks' gestation and in some cases even earlier. This response varied according to not only gestational ages, but also between fetuses of the same gestational age. In all responding livers there was a tendency for increased responsiveness with increasing gestational age and the number of responding fetuses also increased with gestational age. Depletion of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class 11 + cells from the stimulator cells resulted in a decreased stimulation index (SI) in a majority of the experiments, indicating that the reactivity is HLA class H dependent. In order to further study the role of CD 3 + (T-cells) and CD 56 + (NK-cells) cells in the alloreactivity in fetal cells, MLC was performed prior to and after depletion of these cellsubpopulations. The MLC response was reduced either after CD 3 + or CD 56 + cell depletion from responder cells. Both cell- types may exhibit complementary effects in fetal alloreactivity. The possibility to decrease colony-forming capacity in FLC was also explored. Such regimens have been discussed as a way to create an advantage for transplanted cells to increase the potential for homing and engraftment after in utero stem cell transplantation. Parvovirus B 19 is known to inhibit erythropoietic colony formation in vitro. The hypothesis that recombinant B 19 empty capsid proteins (VP 1, VP 2) could themselves suppress erythropoietic colony formation in the absence of nonstructural proteins, was explored. The B 19 capsids were shown to inhibit colony formation of BFU-E (70 - 95 %). When B 19 capsids were pre-incubated with anti-B 19 monoclonal antibody or IgG positive sera, the inhibitory effect on BFU-E was completely blocked. The B 19 capsids inhibitory effect could also be reduced by at least 25 % by pre-incubating the FLC with anti-P monoclonal antibody. The sensitivity of fetal hematopoietic stem cells to chemotherapeutic and immunomodulative agents, measured as colony-forming capacity was tested. FLC were incubated with doxorubicin, daunorubicin, antithymocyte-globulin (ATG), Ortoclone OKT- 3 and betamethasone. All drugs tested were capable in variable degrees to decrease colony-forming capacity of fetal hematopoietic progenitor cells. However, cytotoxic drugs may adversely affect the fetus. These potential risks needs to be compared to the severity of the disease to be treated and the gains of transplantation. A case of IUTx with cryopreserved FLC given at 14 weeks by a single intraperitoneal injection to a male fetus with X-linked SCID is reported. Engraftment was detected at 24 weeks, and the fetus had a normal T-cell count at 33 weeks. Complete reconstitution of T-cells was achieved before birth, and the clinical course during the first two years of life has been completely uneventful. Although experience of IUTx in X-linked SCID is still limited, IUTx might be offered as a therapeutic option in cases where the parents are considering termination of an affected fetus identified at prenatal diagnosis...|$|E
