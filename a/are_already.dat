5|$|At {{the end of}} the episode, Locke {{enters the}} cabin alone and meets the figure of the {{deceased}} Christian Shephard (John Terry), who claims he is speaking on Jacob's behalf and is accompanied by his daughter Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin). Christian warns Locke that Keamy's mercenaries from the Kahana <b>are</b> <b>already</b> en route to the Island, and that the Island must be moved.|$|E

5|$|Birth {{control is}} another consideration: women with SCI {{are usually not}} {{prescribed}} oral contraceptives since the hormones in them {{increase the risk of}} blood clots, for which people with SCI <b>are</b> <b>already</b> at elevated risk. Intrauterine devices could have dangerous complications that could go undetected if sensation is reduced. Diaphrams that require something to be inserted into the vagina are not usable by people with poor hand function. An option of choice for women is for partners to use condoms.|$|E
5|$|Cerium-doped {{lanthanum}} bromide and {{lanthanum chloride}} are the recent inorganic scintillators, {{which have a}} combination of high light yield, best energy resolution, and fast response. Their high yield converts into superior energy resolution; moreover, the light output is very stable and quite high over a very wide range of temperatures, making it particularly attractive for high-temperature applications. These scintillators <b>are</b> <b>already</b> widely used commercially in detectors of neutrons or gamma rays.|$|E
5|$|Corrupt {{politicians}} <b>are</b> <b>already</b> {{beginning to}} speculate on them as possible capital for their schemes and to fill their poor heads {{with all sorts of}} vagaries. Florida is the State into which they have, more than anywhere else, been pouring. Emigration is positively and decidedly setting that way; but as yet it is mere worldly emigration, with the hope of making money, nothing more.|$|E
50|$|Fehmarn <b>is</b> <b>already</b> {{connected}} by bridge with the German mainland, and Lolland <b>is</b> <b>already</b> {{connected by}} a tunnel and bridges with Zealand over the island Falster. Furthermore, Zealand <b>is</b> <b>already</b> connected with the Swedish coast via the Øresund Bridge. Although there <b>is</b> <b>already</b> a fixed connection between Zealand and Germany, going via the Great Belt, Funen and Jutland, the Fehmarn Belt fixed link would provide an easier and speedier route from Germany to Zealand, Sweden, and Norway.|$|R

5|$|Credit Information: The {{use of the}} Lebanese Identity Card can {{enable the}} banks in the Republic of Lebanon to easily {{establish}} persons credit-worthiness from the Credit Referencing Agencies any time they apply for a loan. This may lead drastically to the reduction in bank rates on loans since the banks can establish whether they <b>are</b> <b>already</b> servicing a loan from another bank which {{will result in a}} reduction in the incidents of bad debts.|$|E
5|$|Dean Smith of North Carolina has won {{the most}} awards with eight. Thirteen other coaches have won the award more than once. Five former ACC Coaches of the Year have been {{inducted}} into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as coaches; Mike Krzyzewski (inducted 2001) of Duke and Roy Williams (inducted 2007) of North Carolina {{are the only two}} active coaches who <b>are</b> <b>already</b> members.|$|E
5|$|Emergency Care Practitioner – This position, {{sometimes}} called 'Super Paramedic' in the media, {{is designed to}} bridge the link between ambulance care and {{the care of a}} general practitioner.

50|$|TOI {{was born}} in 2007 when {{interior}} designer and visual artist Mei Tayengco took {{up the idea of}} introducing singer Pauline Diaz to guitarist Patrick Tirano, to see if their musical approaches were compatible.

5|$|Figures were {{published}} in June 2006 showing that 76.2% of all young people aged 16–18 <b>are</b> <b>already</b> in further education or training, meaning that the rise might only affect around 25% {{of young people who}} may have otherwise sought employment immediately upon finishing compulsory education. This did not specifically state that young people would remain in secondary school, but rather by law be required to continue their education full or part-time, whether that be in sixth form, college or work based training.|$|E
5|$|I {{was anxious}} that such details {{should be put}} on record because some of these {{regional}} cooking pots <b>are</b> <b>already</b> becoming {{very hard to find}} in France, so that in some sense Juliet Renny's drawings constitute a little historical record in their own right.|$|E
5|$|If {{there is}} a clause both of whose {{variables}} <b>are</b> <b>already</b> set, {{in a way that}} falsifies the clause, then the algorithm backtracks to its most recent choice point, undoing the assignments it made since that choice, and reverses the decision made at that choice. If there is no choice point, or if the algorithm has already backtracked over the most recent choice point, then it aborts the search and reports that the input 2-CNF formula is unsatisfiable.|$|E
50|$|The consecration of Monsignor Treanor as Bishop of Down and Connor was {{the first}} consecration of a newly {{appointed}} Bishop as Bishop of Down and Connor since the consecration of Daniel Mageean in 1929.

5|$|In clade-based phylogenetic taxonomy, Ceratopsia {{is often}} defined {{to include all}} marginocephalians {{more closely related to}} Triceratops than to Pachycephalosaurus. Under this definition, the most basal known ceratopsians are Yinlong, from the Late Jurassic Period, along with Chaoyangsaurus and the family Psittacosauridae, from the Early Cretaceous Period, all of which were {{discovered}} in northern China or Mongolia. The rostral bone and flared jugals <b>are</b> <b>already</b> present in all of these forms, indicating that even earlier ceratopsians remain to be discovered.|$|E

5|$|MHL pares {{down the}} three TMDS {{channels}} {{in a standard}} HDMI connection to a single one running over any connector that provides at least five pins.

The USB port switches to MHL mode when it detects a compatible device is connected.|$|E
5|$|Metagenomic {{analysis}} pipelines use {{two approaches}} in the annotation of coding {{regions in the}} assembled contigs.

5|$|ReactOS's network stack {{is built}} on the TCP portion of OSKit's port of the network stack in FreeBSD, along with an {{internally}} developed implementation for packet-oriented protocols like IP.
