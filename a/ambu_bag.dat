50|$|The German {{engineer}} Dr. Holger Hesse, and his partner, Danish anaesthetist, Henning Ruben, {{invented in}} 1956, the world's first non-electric, self-inflating resuscitator {{known as the}} <b>Ambu</b> <b>bag.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>Ambu</b> <b>bag</b> {{resuscitator}} revolutionized {{possibility of}} providing artificial respiration. Today the resuscitator {{is produced by}} the Ambu company, which still produces {{a wide range of}} single-patient and multi-use resuscitators.|$|E
40|$|Health {{care workers}} (HCWs) {{treating}} infectious patients, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) patients, {{are at high}} risk of nosocomial infection. The concern is particularly serious during the bioaerosol-induced procedures, in which droplets and bioaerosols emitted by an infectious patient may enter the respiratory system of the HCW in dose contact with the patient. These medical procedures include endotracheal intubation, bronchoscopy, <b>ambu</b> <b>bagging,</b> among others. Infection control professionals have identified local exhaust ventilation (LEV) as a promising solution to remove the contagious pollutants for protection against nosocomial transmission of diseases. In this study, computation fluid dynamics (CFD) models were developed to simulate the transport of droplets and bioaerosols for design optimisation of a LEV system, taking into account the important particle deposition and turbulence effects. A LEV prototype was built and tested. The details of the computational analysis and empirical results are presented in this paper. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
5000|$|The {{first of}} these - a self-inflating {{resuscitator}} designed in collaboration with Danish anesthetist Henning Ruben and marketed under the name 'Ambu' - was launched in 1956. The name Ambu was subsequently (in 1986) chosen as the new company name. Today, Ambu resuscitators are in use {{all over the world}} in every emergency medical environment. The Ambu name has become an example of a Genericized trademark, as all manual bag resuscitators in medical settings are now often referred to generically as [...] "Ambu bags," [...] even though <b>Ambu</b> brand resuscitator <b>bags</b> are still produced and other companies are not allowed to use the Ambu trademark.|$|R
40|$|Background: Aerosol {{therapy has}} been {{established}} as an efficient form of drug delivery to pediatric and adult patients with respiratory diseases; however, aerosol delivery to the pediatric population is quite challenging. While some studies compare jet nebulizer (JN), vibrating mesh nebulizer (VMN), or JN and pMDI, there is no study comparing these three devices in pediatric and young children. The {{aim of this study}} quantifies aerosol deposition using JN, VMN, and pMDI/VHC in a simulated pediatric with active and passive breathing patterns. Methods: Each aerosol generator was placed between manual resuscitator <b>bag</b> (<b>Ambu</b> SPUR II Disposable Resuscitator, Ambu Inc, Glen Burnie, MD) and infant facemask (Mercury Medical, Cleanwater, FL), which was held tightly against the SAINT model. Breathing parameters used in this study were Vt of 100 mL, RR of 30 breaths/min, and I:E ratio of 1 : 1. 4. Active and passive breathing patterns were used in this study with aerosol device; active breathing pattern was created using a ventilator (Esprit Ventilator, Respironics/Philips Healthcare, Murrysville, PA) connected to a dual chamber test lung (Michigan Instruments, Grand Rapids, MI), which was attached to an absolute filter (Respirgard II, Vital Signs Colorado Inc, Englewood, CO), to collect aerosolized drug, connected to the SAINT model. Pediatric resuscitator bag was run at 10 L/min of oxygen and attached to aerosol generator with facemask. In passive breathing pattern, SAINT model was attached to test lung and ventilated using the resuscitator bag with the same breathing parameters. Each aerosol device was tested three times (n= 3) with each breathing patterns. Drug was eluted from the filter and analyzed using spectrophotometry. The amount of drug deposited on the filter was quantified and expressed {{as a percentage of the}} total drug dose. To measure the differences in the inhaled drug mass between JN, VMN, and pMDI/VHC in active or passive breathing, one-way analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA) was performed. To quantify the difference in aerosol depositions between the two breathing patterns, independent t-test was performed. A p 3 ̆c 0. 05 was considered to be statistically significant. Results: Although the amount of aerosol deposition with the JN was the same in passive and active breathing without any significant difference, the VMN was more efficient in active breathing than the JN (p = 0. 157 and p = 0. 729, respectively). pMDI/VHC had the greatest deposition in the simulated spontaneous breathing (p= 0. 013) Conclusion: Aerosol treatment may be administered to young children using JN, VMN, or pMDI/VHC combined with resuscitator bag. Using pMDI/VHC with resuscitator bag is the best choice to deliver albuterol in spontaneously breathing children. Further studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of these aerosol generators with different type of resuscitator bag and different breathing parameters...|$|R
50|$|The first cardiac {{crash cart}} {{was created in}} 1962 at Bethany Medical Center in Kansas City, Kansas, home to the first Cardiac Care Unit in the country. The first crash cart was {{fabricated}} by the father {{of one of the}} doctors. It contained an <b>Ambu</b> <b>bag,</b> defibrillator paddles, a bed board and endotracheal tubes.|$|E
5000|$|Improper care during arrest. Jackson had a {{respiratory}} arrest, and Murray did {{not follow}} the protocol for such an event. During respiratory arrest, the patient stops breathing, causing the oxygen levels in the blood to drop lower and lower, which causes the heart rate to increase. Lack of oxygen weakens the heart, and the heart will have electricity present but will not contract (pulseless electrical activity). Finally, the heart's electricity dies (asystole). Murray should have tried to arouse Jackson, placed an <b>ambu</b> <b>bag</b> over his mouth, cleared the airway, called 911 and administered flumazenil. Instead, Murray started chest compressions, which do not help respiratory arrest. [...] "The heart was already working, he didn't need chest compressions". Even then, the CPR was of poor quality, since it should have involved having both hands on a hard surface rather than having one hand on a bed.|$|E
5000|$|Propofol {{was being}} {{administered}} in the home, with no equipment, no medical personnel, no back-up and no physical observation by the attending physician. [...] "Each of these individually {{would be an}} extreme deviation on their own". Equipment needed for propofol: alarm on the pulse oximeter, automated blood pressure cuff, EKG to monitor heart rhythm, <b>ambu</b> <b>bag</b> for ventilation assistance, a backboard for chest compressions, a back-up generator in case the power goes out, a way to summon help and a device for keeping the airway open such as an endotracheal tube. Murray had none of this equipment. Personnel required: Intubation specialist to rescue the airway, nurses for the procedures, emergency personnel close by, and an anaesthesiologist. Personnel trained in basic life support and advanced life support should be in attendance {{to deal with the}} airway maintenance, IV maintenance and any arrests that may occur. Drugs required during sedation {{in the event of an}} emergency: flumazenil, naloxone, lidocaine, atropine, beta blockers, dopamine, epinephrine, methylprednisolone. All of these should be available in a crash cart very close by.|$|E
5000|$|A bag valve mask, {{abbreviated}} to BVM and sometimes {{known by the}} proprietary name <b>Ambu</b> <b>bag</b> or generically as a manual resuscitator or [...] "self-inflating bag", is a hand-held device commonly used to provide positive pressure ventilation to patients who are not breathing or not breathing adequately. The device is a required part of resuscitation kits for trained professionals in out-of-hospital settings (such as ambulance crews) and is also frequently used in hospitals as part of standard equipment found on a crash cart, in emergency rooms or other critical care settings. Underscoring the frequency and prominence of BVM use in the United States, the American Heart Association (AHA) Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiac Care recommend that [...] "all healthcare providers should {{be familiar with the}} use of the bag-mask device." [...] Manual resuscitators are also used within the hospital for temporary ventilation of patients dependent on mechanical ventilators when the mechanical ventilator needs to be examined for possible malfunction, or when ventilator-dependent patients are transported within the hospital. Two principal types of manual resuscitators exist; one version is self-filling with air, although additional oxygen (O2) can be added but is not necessary for the device to function. The other principal type of manual resuscitator (flow-inflation) is heavily used in non-emergency applications in the operating room to ventilate patients during anesthesia induction and recovery.|$|E
5000|$|Next {{to testify}} was Elissa Fleak, a Los Angeles County coroner {{for the past}} eight years. [...] Her duties include {{investigating}} deaths (natural/suicide/homicide) and working with medical examiners to determine causes of death. Fleak went to UCLA Medical Center at 5:20 pm on June 25, 2009, to examine Jackson's body and get information surrounding his death. She examined the body in a private room, as well as notes and photographs, and looked for external wounds/injuries; any sign to signal the cause of death. None were found. She took four vials of Jackson's blood for toxicology testing and went to Jackson's house to perform an onsite investigation. While in Jackson's bedroom, she found an empty 20ml propofol bottle and an empty 5ml flumazenil bottle {{on the floor next to}} the bedside table. She also recovered other prescription drugs, such as diazepam, lorazepam, and tamsulosin (Flomax), one bottle prescribed to Mick Jackson, and some medicines prescribed by Alan Metzger. Other drugs found were Benoquin, hydroquinone, lidocaine, and an oxygen tank beside the bed. Medical equipment recovered included alcohol prep pads, a 10cc syringe with the needle removed, an IV catheter on the floor under an <b>Ambu</b> <b>bag,</b> an aspirin bottle, a syringe box, catheters, a jug of urine, and an IV pole with a saline bag and tubing draped over it.|$|E
5000|$|It {{was heard}} from White that {{administering}} propofol without careful bedside monitoring could be dangerous. [...] "Do you agree there were instances where Dr. Murray deviated from {{standard of care}} on June 25, 2009?" [...] "Yes". Walgren asked [...] "have you ever administered propofol in someone's bedroom?" [...] "No". [...] "Have you heard anyone else doing it?" [...] "No." [...] Dr. White agrees Dr. Murray deviated from the 'standard of care' of Jackson but doesn't know to what degree. [...] "Do you disagree with Dr. Shafer's opinion that failure to keep medical records 'egregious and unconscionable' deviation?" [...] White doesn't know what the words egregious and unconscionable mean in this case. [...] "Would you administer propofol to a patient without proper airway-opening equipment?" [...] "I would certainly have means for ventilation, means of ventilation could be an <b>ambu</b> <b>bag</b> and a mask, not necessarily other respiratory equipment". It was heard that Dr. White has received $11,000 so far for his testimony in this case. He usually charges $3,500 per day and any expenses such as airfares. He doesn't think the defense have this much so will not bill them that much. Dr. Safer testified for many days, and performed numerous simulations for both the prosecution and defense for free. [...] "Was Dr. Murray offered money to provide Jackson's propofol?" [...] "It is my understanding that Dr. Murray was offered money to be Jackson's personal doctor." [...] Walgren then asked [...] "If you injected 25 mg propofol, {{is it ok to}} walk out of the room?" [...] "25 mg only lasts 15-30 minutes, after that I see no problem in leaving the patient's bedside." [...] "If the patient liked to 'push' propofol themselves, would you walk out of room?" [...] "No." [...] Upon being asked about Murray's actions after he found Jackson, Dr. White said [...] "I would have done things differently. I would have called for help, called 911 and initiated CPR." [...] When being asked about Murray's delay to call 911 he stated [...] "I would have called 911 earlier but do not believe it would have made any difference in this case." [...] "3-5 minutes after finding him I would call 911." [...] It was heard that [...] "forgetting to mention propofol was a detail overlooked, could also be a lie?" [...] "Yes." [...] After Dr. White mentioned he believed that Jackson had his own stash of propofol, Walgren asked the judge to admonish witness to respond the question only. Judge asked jurors to leave the courtroom. Walgren asked [...] "Do you reject that Jackson drank propofol and that caused his death?" [...] "Yes. I speculated that oral administration may have played a role. I don't reject completely the self-administration theory. The evidence suggests that Jackson did not drink propofol". Flanagan then asked Dr. White: [...] "If patient died on noon, would it matter if help came 5 minutes later?" [...] "Unlikely." [...] Dr. White continued and added, [...] "Propofol does not have a reversal treatment, only treatment for propofol overdose is time." ...|$|E

40|$|Difficulties {{arise when}} a doctor on board an {{aircraft}} {{is called to}} attend to emergencies. ', 2 My experience on a flight with Malaysian Airline System (MAS) may be of value to ease some of the difficulties encountered. In a flight from Hongkong to Kuala Lumpur, I was called to attend to an elderly unconscious patient. He was given oxygen by mask with-out bagging equipment by two Swedish nurses. He was cyanosed, had occasional gasps and the pulse was irregular at 30 to 40 beats/min. felt only at the carotid; there was gross oedema of the feet. I {{had no idea how}} to resuscitate him without drugs as he barely responded to oxygen by mask. One of the nurses urged me to request for the "captain's bag " of which I heard for the first time. The steward soon fetched the mysterious bag and the <b>Ambu</b> <b>bag.</b> The contents of the captain's bag included a stethoscope, plenty of syringes, needles, drip sets, dextrose/saline infusion bottles, and vials of adrenaline, aminophylline, digoxin, hydrocortisone, lasix, morphine, sodium car-bonate, etc. The patient was ventilated with oxygen using the <b>Ambu</b> <b>bag</b> through a mouth tube and treated for acute cardiac failure; he was in a satisfactory condition when we reached Kual...|$|E

40|$|Aims: In the {{critical}} life threatening situations, {{efforts of the}} emergency centers personnel are to eliminate the threatening factors, to keep airways open and save the victim life. To achieve these aims, proper equipments such as instruments for opening and keeping airways open are important. The {{aim of this study}} was to survey the status of equipment which are used for airway management of victims in critical situations by personnel of Mazandaran emergent teams. Methods: By using a descriptive study design, Mazandaran province divided into three geographic zones included West, East and Center zone. Three cities randomly chosen from each zone. Emergency centers of these selected cities visited research team members and by using of a checklist, all airways management equipments such as endotracheal tubes, airways, and <b>Ambu</b> <b>bag,</b> a flexible reservoir bag connected by tubing and a non-rebreathing valve to a face mask or endotracheal tube which used for artificial ventilation, surveyed...|$|E
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} {{and safety of}} anesthesia with fentanyl and etomidate were evaluated in 44 patients undergoing elective cardioversion. No drop in blood pressure was observed; endotracheal intubation was never necessary, and <b>ambu</b> <b>bag</b> assisted ventilation was needed in only five patients. Anesthesia was induced within 7 min in all patients with a mean dose of 09 mg of fentanyl and 15 - 4 mg of etomidate. After cardioversion, naloxone 0 - 2 mg intravenously was used to antagonize fentanyl; patients were fully awake on average 9 min after the last cardioversion discharge. Complete amnesia was observed in all patients, both I hour after cardioversion and the next morning. For cardioversion, fentanyl-etomidate is as safe, more effective and less time-consuming than diazepam. Cardioversion consists of a transthoracic electrical discharge triggered by the QRS complex of the electrocardiogram and is intended to depolarize all cardiac cells simultaneously in patients with supra-ventricular or ventricular tachyarrhythmias, {{in order to allow}} resumption of a regular sinu...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} {{a rise in the}} number of {{patients}} requiring long-term ventilation, both in the in-hospital and the out-of-hospital setting. Despite this, little is known about the subsequent clinical course of these patients fol-lowing hospital discharge. The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency and management of respiratory incidents in patients with invasive out-of-hospital ventilation living in a nursing home allied to a weaning centre. We evaluated retrospectively the protocols that are used to monitor the patients over a period of 2 months. The average time from hospital discharge was 386 + 330 days. Of the total 17 patients, 9 (53 %) patients remained free from any respiratory incidents, while the remaining 8 (47 %) patients were responsible for a total of 95 respiratory incidents. Patients that suffered respiratory incidents had been venti-lated at home for an average of 194 days, while the others were receiving out-of-hospital ventilation for an average of 557 days. Desaturation (17), dyspnoea (17) and reduced general condition (10) were the most com-mon respiratory incidents. Also, the use of an <b>Ambu</b> <b>bag</b> (bag valve mask; 17), request for a pneumologist review (12) and replacement of the tracheal cannula (7) were the most common interventions. Respiratory incidents are common in invasive home mechanical ventilation, and so home mechanical ventilation needed to be organized safely. Being allied to a weaning centre helps to organize invasive home mechanical ventilation in a safe manner over the long-term ventilation...|$|E
40|$|Airwaymanagement {{by using}} supraglottic airway devices in {{cardiopulmonary}} resuscitation {{is so far}} only an alternative for experienced healthcare professionals, whereas laypersons are deprived of this method. They are only trained in the technique of mouth-to-mouth ventilation in Basic Life Support courses to provide a secured airway in case of emergency. On the assumption that mouth-to-mouth ventilation seems to be antiquated and the contact with the mucous membrane of a victim may deter potential first aiders from ventilation, we conducted a prospective study with 179 medical students in the first term. After a very short training session with the Laryngeal Mask Airway the subjects were instructed to ventilate an airway trainer by using four different supraglottic airway devices: The Laryngeal mask airway, the Cobra PLA, the LMA Fast Trach and the Laryngeal Tube. Therefor they had to insert the device and insufflate a sufficient tidal volume using an <b>ambu</b> <b>bag.</b> Time to correct placement of the device, number of attempts until sufficient ventilation, tidal volume and order of device usage were documented. In addition, {{the students were asked}} to provide a subjective assessment of the devices. The results of the study show, that after minimal training all study participants were able to perform a correct insertion and sufficient ventilation with at least 500 ml in the manikin study, most students even needed just one attempt. In both the statistical data analysis and the subjective assessment as the best device, the LMA Fast Trach provided the best results. This implies the recommendation to reform the resuscitation guidelines and implement supraglottic airway devices into Basic Life Support Algorithm. It is a necessary and substantial progress in emergency medicine to develop training programmes in using supraglottic airway devices for non-professionals. Incorporating particularly the Fast Trach into Basic Life Support courses may allow that precious time until the arrival of professional rescuers to an emergency case can be used more efficiently and thus save many lives...|$|E
