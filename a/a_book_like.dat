5|$|Sirrus and Achenar beg the Stranger not {{to touch}} the green book that is stored in the same {{location}} as their final pages. They claim that it is <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>like</b> their own that will trap the Stranger. In truth, it leads to D'ni, where Atrus is imprisoned. When the book is opened, Atrus asks the Stranger to bring him a final page that is hidden on Myst Island; without it, he cannot bring his sons to justice. The game has several endings, depending on the player's actions. Giving either Sirrus or Achenar the final page of their book causes the Stranger to switch places with the son, leaving the player trapped inside the Prison book. Linking to D'ni without the page Atrus asks for leaves the Stranger and Atrus trapped on D'ni. Linking to D'ni with the page allows Atrus to complete his Myst book {{and return to the}} island. Upon returning to the library, the player finds the red and blue books gone, and burn marks on the shelves where they used to be.|$|E

With a producer to guide them, the siblings sat on Healy's lounge-room floor, continuing to record songs, using vintage guitars and microphones. The rest of the tracks were recorded in their mother's lounge room back in Newport with Pritchett. 2007 commenced with the duo playing at January's Big Day Out.|$|E
500|$|In 2011, Mark Melvin, {{an inmate}} at the Kilby Correctional Facility, was banned from {{reading the book}} by Alabama Department of Corrections officials. They {{described}} it as [...] "an attempt to incite violence based on race, religion, sex, creed or nationality". Melvin filed a lawsuit stating that his First Amendment rights had been violated. Blackmon said of the officials' actions that [...] "The idea that <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>like</b> mine is somehow incendiary or a call to violence is so absurd".|$|E
2500|$|In the 1970s, as {{adoption}} {{search and}} support organizations developed, there were {{challenges to the}} language in common use at the time. <b>As</b> <b>books</b> <b>like</b> Adoption Triangle by Sorosky, Pannor and Baran were published, and support groups formed like CUB (Concerned United Birthparents), a major shift from [...] "natural parent" [...] to [...] "birthparent" [...] occurred.

500|$|Dillard's {{primary reader}} for Pilgrim was a Hollins {{professor}} called John Rees Moore. [...] After finishing a chapter, she would {{bring it to}} Moore to critique. [...] Moore specifically recommended that she expand the book's first chapter [...] "to make clear, and to state boldly, what it was [...] was up to," [...] a suggestion that Dillard at first dismissed, but would later admit was good advice. [...] Previous to publication, chapters of the book appeared in publications including Harper's Magazine, The Atlantic, and The Living Wilderness. [...] Pilgrim at Tinker Creek was published by Harper's Magazine Press in 1974, and was dedicated to Dillard's husband. [...] Editor in chief Larry Freundlich remarked upon first reading the book: [...] "I never expected to see a manuscript this good in my life .... The chance to publish <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>like</b> this is what publishers are here for." ...|$|E
500|$|Diane McWhorter, Pulitzer Prize-winning {{historian}} of the Birmingham civil rights campaign, asserts that To Kill a Mockingbird condemns racism instead of racists, and states that every child in the South has moments of racial cognitive dissonance when they {{are faced with the}} harsh reality of inequality. This feeling causes them to question the beliefs with which they have been raised, which for many children is what the novel does. McWhorter writes of Lee, [...] "for a white person from the South to write <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>like</b> this in the late 1950s is really unusual—by its very existence an act of protest." [...] Author James McBride calls Lee brilliant but stops short of calling her brave: [...] "I think by calling Harper Lee brave you kind of absolve yourself of your own racism... She certainly set the standards in terms of how these issues need to be discussed, but in many ways I feel... the moral bar's been lowered. And that's really distressing. We need a thousand Atticus Finches." [...] McBride, however, defends the book's sentimentality, and the way Lee approaches the story with [...] "honesty and integrity".|$|E

2500|$|When St. Martin's Press {{heard of}} a November 2007 InTouch Weekly cover story on the {{contents}} of the book, the publisher responded by stating that InTouch had not received an advance copy of Tom Cruise: An Unauthorized Biography and was simply speculating. [...] Brian Smith of St. Martin's Press was interviewed for the InTouch article, and commented on the book: [...] "No one has dared to write <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>like</b> this.

2500|$|In {{his essay}} [...] "Good Bad Books", George Orwell {{presented}} Lewis as the exemplar {{of a writer}} who is cerebral without being artistic. Orwell wrote, [...] "Enough talent to set up dozens of ordinary writers has been poured into Wyndham Lewis's so-called novels, such as Tarr or Snooty Baronet. Yet {{it would be a}} very heavy labour to read one of these books right through.

Angus & Julia Stone have released four studio albums: <b>A</b> <b>Book</b> <b>Like</b> This (2007), Down the Way (2010), Angus & Julia Stone (2014), and Snow (2017).

2500|$|Dr. Chris Harrison (Publishing Director {{of social}} science {{publishing}} for Cambridge University Press), anticipating the level of controversy <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>like</b> The Skeptical Environmentalist would likely provoke, took extra care with the book's peer-review process. Instead of choosing candidates from the usual list {{of social science}} referees, Cambridge University Press chose from a list provided by their environmental science publishing program. Four were chosen: [...] a climate scientist, an expert in biodiversity and sustainable development, a specialist on the economics of climate change (whose credentials include reviewing publications for the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)) and a [...] "pure" [...] economist. [...] All four members of Cambridge's initial review panel agreed that the book should be published.|$|E

2500|$|Debuting {{with sales}} of 12,500 (around the [...] "break even" [...] mark for a color comic, {{although}} [...] "like ten thousand more" [...] than Bendis' previous book, Torso), Powers was faced with an uncertain future, as sales of comics tend to dwindle over subsequent issues. However, Image Comics publisher Jim Valentino and head of marketing Anthony Bozzi both read and enjoyed the first three issues (lettered and laid out by Bendis himself, a hang-over from his earlier fully creator-owned works where he took on the complete roles of several individuals), with Bozzi reportedly saying, [...] "If we can't make <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>like</b> POWERS sell we really should stop making comics." [...] Image offered to double-ship the second issue, effectively doubling the orders for that issue {{as an attempt to}} boost sales: the gamble worked, and issue #1 was soon reprinted, while according to Bendis, [...] "issues #3–11 saw an upswing" [...] in sales every issue. The reported Diamond pre-order figures show sales climbing above 23,000 by issue #7, and topping 30,000 with issue #14 and stabilizing between 25,000 and 30,000 {{for the remainder of the}} titles' Image run. [...] These strong sales allowed Oeming to quit his job as a security guard, while Bendis' launch of Ultimate Spider-Man had a positive effect on Powers sales as readers searched out his comics.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2009, after touring {{for over}} a year in support of the duo’s first studio album, <b>A</b> <b>Book</b> <b>Like</b> This (September 2007), Stone {{released}} his debut solo album, Smoking Gun, under the pseudonym, Lady of the Sunshine. It was recorded over six weeks during 2008 with Finn (Govinda Doyle) – who also provided drums and bass guitar – in a converted old water tank on Finn's property in North Queensland. In an interview on national radio station, Triple J, with Richard Kingsmill, Stone said that the album came out of “growing an appetite for wanting to rock out". Stone explained that he had played in rock bands while in high school, they covered material by Rage Against the Machine and Red Hot Chili Peppers – these influences are loosely present on Smoking Gun. To accompany the album Stone wrote [...] "Every emotion in my head has its own voice and this record is what came of them .... I wanted these songs to have their own style. I enjoyed watching how the songs took on their own ride, most from the simplest of ideas". The album reached the top50 on the ARIA Albums Chart. One of his tracks, [...] "Big Jet Plane", from Smoking Gun was later re-recorded by Angus & Julia Stone and released by the duo as a single in May 2010.|$|E
