PC plating investigated {{over a wide range}} of pulse frequencies (20 Hz– 200 kHz) and duty cycles produces coatings with compositions that differ only slightly from those obtained by DC plating at the same current density. On the other hand, the use of PR plating can be dramatic, producing Pb contents both well above and below that achievable by DC plating.

Precise assessment of corrosion rate (CR) is of prime importance to evaluate the structural safety {{as well as for}} estimation of service life of concrete structures.

The reliability of GPT in determining the CR under passive and active state of rebar has been carried out using small size laboratory specimens and large scale aged concrete structures. The CR determined by the GPT is compared with the CR obtained by Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy Technique (EIST) and weight-loss method. The study reveals that an <b>anodic</b> <b>pulse</b> of 100 μA with a pulse duration of 10 seconds is able to determine the CR from 1 - 663 μm/y (from negligible to higher corrosion activity) on the rebar network more precisely even up to 65 mm of cover concrete.

In the case of passive state of rebar, the CR predicted by EIST is very close to weight-loss method whereas GPT predicts 10 times higher.

The Mn–Co–Cu system features the best ORR electrocatalytic activity in terms of electron transfer number, onset potential, half-wave potential and current density.

The measured faradaic current is about 104 times smaller than that predicted by this model initially, but the two converge after the initial {{period of time when}} p approaches 1. This discrepancy may be caused by several reasons. Our nonuniform oxide thickness hypothesis was supported by: similar p x characteristics for the same film obtained from different polarization experiments, where x is the solid-state barrier layer thickness of the oxide film; model 2 ̆ 7 s capability of predicting film structure change due to pretreatment such as NaOH dissolution, H 2 SO 4 immersion, and electropolishing; the capacity of predicting long-time current decays using high field model; the lower anodic current of the foils subjected a short <b>anodic</b> <b>pulse</b> previously.;In the second part, the effect of H 3 PO 4 immersion on pit nucleation on aluminum during anodic etching in hot HCl solution was investigated.

40|$|Objective. In {{motor cortex}} {{stimulation}} (MCS) for central and trigeminal pain Resume leads are placed epidurally over the motor and sensory cortex. Several bipolar combinations {{are used to}} identify the cortical target corresponding to the painful body segment. The cathode giving the largest motor response is chosen for chronic stimulation. The cathode of a bipole is considered as the active electrode and the anode {{is assumed to be}} the indifferent electrode, as in spinal cord and peripheral nerve stimulation. This study aims to analyse whether this assumption is correct in MCS. Methods. A computer model of MCS was used to calculate the response of cortical nerve fibres with different orientations to cathodic and anodic stimulation. Results. A cortical fibre model parallel to the paddle of the epidural lead is depolarized when a cathodic pulse is applied and has the lowest possible threshold for its excitation. When the fibre model is turned towards 90 o (normal to the paddle) the threshold stimulus for its excitation is increased until it is hyperpolarized and gets unexcitable. When an <b>anodic</b> <b>pulse</b> is applied the fibre response is opposite: a fibre model parallel or normal to the paddle is hyperpolarized or depolarized, respectively. Opposite fibre responses are also obtained when the same fibre type is either in the wall of the Central Sulcus or in the Precentral Gyrus. Discussion. The results are in accordance with experimental data (1 - 4). In anodic stimulation on the Precentral Gyrus pyramidal tract fibres are excited directly and at a lower threshold than in cathodic stimulation when pyramidal tract fibres are activated after a longer delay (trans-synaptically). When the active electrode is above the Central Sulcus fibre responses are inverted. Conclusion. When bipolar stimulation is applied the motor response is evoked under the anode. This electrode should be used as the cathode in stimulation for chronic pain relief. References 1. Patton HD, Amassian VE.

It appeared that there is still a great need for a simple screening device as a convenient means to provide a heavy metal profil in forensic and clinical toxicology. Therefore the potentials of differential <b>pulse</b> <b>anodic</b> stripping voltammetry (DPASV) in these areas have been studied. [...] . Zie: Summary...|$|R
40|$|SELECTIVE, ACCURATE, SENSITIVE, SIMPLE AND RAPID METHOD IS DESCRIBED FOR THE DETERMINATION OF TRIBUTYLTIN IN THE PRESENCE OF OTHER ORGANOTIN COMPOUNDS AND INORGANIC TIN IN WATER SAMPLES AND SEDIMENTS AND MOLLUSES. THE ORGANOTIN COMPOUNDS WERE DETERMINED AS SPECIES BY ALTERNATING CURRENT POLAROGRAPHY, DIFFERENTIAL <b>PULSE</b> <b>ANODIC</b> STRIPPING VOLTAMMETRY AND HYDRIDE ATOMIC ABSORPTION SPECTROSCOPY. THE ACCURACY OF THE METHODS WERE TESTED IN THE FRAMEWORK ON INTERCOMPARISON EXERCISES ORGANIZED BY THE BCR. ...|$|R
40|$|The direct {{determination}} of some metals impurity in uranium by using differential <b>pulse</b> <b>anodic</b> stripping voltammetry (DPASV) method at a hanging mercury drop electrode {{and in a}} carbonate buffer media was developed. It {{was found that the}} carbonate buffer show the strongest affinity for uranium and gives the best separation between the DPASV peaks of heavy metals impurities. The carbonate concentration markedly affects the oxidation and reduction the major and the minor constituents of the uranium samples. In 0. 1 M carbonate buffer solution pH 10, copper, bismuth, thalium, lead, cadmium, zinc, could be determined without the removal of the uranium matrix. Recovery and relative standard deviation (RSD) of this method was in the range of 174 % - 85. 2 % for recovery and 36. 8 % - 1. 2 % for RSD. The larger error of analytical result was obtained for Zn at low concentration. In general, the analytic results error and RSD decreased with increasing metals concentration.   Keywords: heavy metal determination, differential <b>pulse</b> <b>anodic</b> stripping voltammetry, uraniu...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Waste {{materials}} like {{fruit and}} vegetable refuses were utilized as component of sensors capable of detecting heavy metals like lead ions and mercury ions by electrochemical method. The ability of the fabricated sensors to detect the presence of heavy metals was analyzed using electrochemical methods like cyclic voltammetry and differential <b>pulse</b> <b>anodic</b> stripping voltammetry. Results showed that the fabricated electrode were able to detect the presence of mercury and lead ions in aqueous solutions...|$|R

The {{development}} of low-cost, mass-produced electrochemical sensors based on screen-printing technology has attracted considerable attention in recent years. In this paper we fabricated the Screen-printed carbon electrodes(SPCE) and realized the simultaneous detection of heavy metal ions(Cu,Pb,Zn) {{complied with the}} use of differential <b>pulse</b> <b>anodic</b> stripping voltammeter(DPASV) and optimized the detection conditions.

Samples (segregated, cleaned and powdered) were digested by the wet method in the microwave mineralizer. Differential <b>pulse</b> <b>anodic</b> stripping voltam-metry (DPASV) was used for determination of Cd, Ni, Mo, Pb and Zn.
