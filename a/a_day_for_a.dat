Hungary was an ally of Germany during the war, but it had resisted turning over its Jews until Germany invaded that March. A rail spur leading directly into Birkenau was completed that May to deliver the victims closer to the gas chambers. From 14 May until early July 1944, 437,000 Hungarian Jews, half of the pre-war population, were deported to Auschwitz, {{at a rate of}} 12,000 <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> considerable part of that period. The incoming volume was so great that the SS resorted to burning corpses in open-air pits {{as well as in the}} crematoria. The last selection took place on 30 October 1944.|$|E

In 1912, shortly after {{the founding of the}} Republic of China, the mine went bankrupt and the owners fled, cheating Peng out of half his annual wages. Peng returned home in 1912 and took a number of odd jobs. In 1913 Hunan suffered another drought, and Peng participated in a public demonstration that escalated into the seizure of a grain merchant's storehouse, and the redistribution of grain among the peasants. Village police issued a warrant for Peng's arrest, and he fled to northern Hunan, where he worked for two years as a construction laborer {{for the construction of a}} dam near Dongting Lake. When the dam was completed, in 1916, Peng assumed that he was no longer in danger of being arrested and returned home, joining the army of a local Kuomintang-aligned warlord, Tang Xiangming.|$|E
25|$|Necrophoric {{behaviour}} {{occurs in}} the red imported fire ant. Workers discard uneaten food and other such wastes away from the nest. The active component was not identified, but the fatty acids accumulating {{as a result of}} decomposition were implicated and bits of paper coated with synthetic oleic acid typically elicited a necrophoric response. The process behind this behaviour in imported red fire ants was confirmed by Blum (1970): unsaturated fats, such as oleic acid, elicit corpse-removal behaviour. Workers also show differentiated responses towards dead workers and pupae. Dead workers are usually taken away from the nest, whereas the pupae may take <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> necrophoric response to occur. Pupae infected by Metarhizium anisopliae are usually discarded by workers at a higher rate; 47.5% of unaffected corpses are discarded within a day, but for affected corpses this figure is 73.8%.|$|E

In total, 2,220 men were recorded as receiving pay that year, {{at a cost to}} the Crown of £2,208. [...] Although most garrisons were paid for by the Crown, in some cases the local community also had a role; at Brownsea, the local town was responsible for providing a garrison of 6 men, and at Sandsfoot the village took up the responsibility for supporting the castle garrison, in exchange for an exemption from paying taxes and carrying out militia service.|$|E

[...] Most of the post-production work was done on Mac workstations using After Effects for compositing and Final Cut Pro for editing (seven workstations were dedicated to visual effects and production editing). The distinctive look of the film was achieved by running footage through a diffusion filter and then tinting it in black and white before color was blended, balanced and added back in.|$|E

[...] Since they could not shoot all over the world, Madonna wanted the video to have an [...] "omnipresent feel", with the middle section of the song generating a sense of congregation. Renck suggested that they include a boombox, used {{as a means of}} uniting everyone and everything since it was through listening to songs on a boombox that street dancing started. Though some scenes in the video feature cities like London, Paris, New York, Los Angeles, Shanghai and Tokyo, in reality the actual sets were constructed in Los Angeles and London only. A London suburb was made to look like a Parisian one, where the routine for Parkour takes place, whereas a restaurant in London's Chinatown was used for the Shanghai sequence and Compton stood in for the Bronx.

A single dose of 4 mg has a half-life of 7.7 ± 4.63 h and a single dose of 8 mg has a half-life of 11.9 ± 4.3 h. The increase of half-life with dose is possibly attributed to there being more individual concentration per time points below the lower limit necessary for quantification in the lower single dose.|$|R
