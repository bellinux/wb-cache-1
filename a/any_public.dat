5|$|The Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) (Assemblies and Processions) Rules {{made under}} the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act require a permit for <b>any</b> <b>public</b> {{assembly}} or procession {{of five or}} more persons in <b>any</b> <b>public</b> place. The rationale given for this law is that {{a large group of}} people who gather for a peaceful purpose can turn violent. In the 1950s and 1960s there were several violent riots in Singapore, the last incident being the 1964 race riots in which 36 people were killed. Although there have only been a few minor protests since then, the authorities continue to take a tough stance against unlicensed outdoor protests. On 31 December 2000, 15 members of Falun Gong consisting of 13 foreigners and two Singaporeans were arrested at MacRitchie Park for holding an illegal assembly.|$|E

In his version of events, he claimed that {{he was sitting in}} his cab across the street when he heard shouting, then saw a police vehicle, and heard the sound of gunshots. Upon seeing his brother appearing disoriented across the street, Abu-Jamal ran to him from the parking lot and was shot by a police officer. Abu-Jamal's brother William Cook, who had been stopped by the police officer, did not testify or make any statement until April 29, 2001.

The Quarrymen played at parties, school dances, cinemas and amateur skiffle contests before Paul McCartney joined the band in October 1957. George Harrison joined the band in early 1958 at McCartney's recommendation, though Lennon initially resisted because he felt Harrison (still 14 {{when he was first}} introduced to Lennon) to be too young. Both McCartney and Harrison attended the Liverpool Institute.|$|E

Throughout Mbeki's presidency, Mandela continued to support the ANC, usually overshadowing Mbeki at <b>any</b> <b>public</b> events that the two attended. Mandela was more at ease with Mbeki's successor, Zuma, although the Nelson Mandela Foundation was upset when his grandson, Mandla Mandela, flew him out to the Eastern Cape to attend a pro-Zuma rally {{in the midst of a}} storm in 2009.|$|E

5|$|The 1873 mahant–Elokeshi {{incident}} {{was not the}} first incident against a mahant of Tarakeswar. Mahant Shrimanta Giri was executed in 1824 for the murder of his mistress's lover. However, according to Sarkar (author of Hindu wife, Hindu nation), while the 1824 scandal hardly created <b>any</b> <b>public</b> outrage and faded quickly from public memory, the 1873 affair was embedded in public memory and created a huge sensation in contemporary Bengal. When a satyagraha was organised against the reigning mahant of Tarakeswar, Satish Giri, in 1974 for his sexual and financial misconduct, the 1873 affair was alluded to several times.|$|E

5|$|The {{historian}} David C. Large wrote that, like <b>any</b> <b>public</b> pronouncements, these bylaws did {{not tell}} the full story about HIAG's real goals. By investigating how these statutes were applied in practice, he was able to tease out what the organisation stood for. For example, HIAG claimed to represent the entire Waffen-SS membership, surviving and fallen, as well as their families: 500,000 in total. In reality, the organisation's rolls did not exceed 20,000. HIAG attained this number in the late 1950s, and held it until the early 1960s.|$|E
5|$|The {{private sector}} has {{also played a}} large role in revitalizing the area, even without public aid and incentives. Developers have been {{attracted}} to the historic buildings and their surrounding neighborhoods, calling it the city's strongest asset, although they have complained about past stalemates in city government. One initiative has often led to others. River Street's development into a center for antique stores came about without <b>any</b> <b>public</b> effort or intent, and the restoration of the music hall at the Savings Bank led to many new restaurants opening in the neighborhood. The blocks of River Street north of Monument Square have a dozen woman-owned businesses.|$|E
5|$|As the New Hampshire primary neared, Rockefeller {{began to}} attack Goldwater, {{claiming}} he supported a voluntary social security {{plan that would}} bankrupt the nation. Goldwater denied the charge. He campaigned in New Hampshire until the primary vote, spending approximately $150,000 as opposed to $250,000 by Rockefeller. Voters grew wary of Goldwater's stances on social security, Cuba, {{the military and the}} role of the Federal government, and were likewise turned off by Rockefeller's very public divorce. As a result, the electorate sought out other candidates. Surprisingly, Ambassador to South Vietnam Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr. won the primary with 35.5 percent as a write-in candidate while still serving in Vietnam and without making <b>any</b> <b>public</b> appearances in New Hampshire. Goldwater finished in second with 22.3 percent, followed by Rockefeller with 21.0 percent. Neither won any delegates from the primary. The chairman of the Florida GOP attributed the defeat to a divided campaign, which he also witnessed in his state, where party leaders such as Congressman William C. Cramer disagreed over a delegate slate.|$|E
