50|$|The driving {{impedance}} of {{the antenna}} {{is equal to}} the characteristic impedance of the wire with respect to ground, somewhere between 400 and 800 ohms, depending on the height of the wire. Typically a length of 50-ohm or 75-ohm coaxial cable would be used for connecting the receiver to the <b>antenna</b> endpoint. A <b>matching</b> <b>transformer</b> should be inserted between any such low-impedance transmission line and the higher 470-ohm impedance of the antenna. A transformer with a turns ratio of 3:1 would provide an impedance transformation of 9:1, which will <b>match</b> the <b>antenna</b> to a 50-ohm transmission line. A transformer with a turns ratio of 5:2 would provide an impedance transformation of 6.25:1, which will <b>match</b> the <b>antenna</b> to a 75-ohm transmission line. Alternatively, a parallel-wire transmission line (twin lead) of 600 ohms makes a fairly good <b>match</b> to the <b>antenna.</b>|$|R

This paper presents a comparative study of traction transformers such as Scott, YNvd, Leblanc and Impedance <b>Matching</b> <b>Transformer</b> for reducing the total harmonic distortion and thereby improving the power quality in a co-phase traction system. A dual converter with a compensator is employed together with special traction balanced transformers to reduce the harmonics, voltage unbalance, negative sequence current and reactive power problems.

40|$|The issue {{involved}} in the simultaneous matching of H+ and H- beams between an RFQ and DTL {{lies in the fact}} that both beams experience the same electric-field forces at a given position in the RFQ. Hence, the two beams are focused to the same correlation. However, matching to a DTL requires correlation of the opposite sign. The Brown-Servranckx [1] quarter-wave (λ / 4) <b>matching</b> <b>transformer</b> system, which requires four quadrupoles, provides a method to simultaneously match H+ and H − beams between an RFQ and a DTL. The method requires the use of a special RFQ section to obtain the Twiss parameter conditions βx = β y and α x = αy = 0 at the exit of the RFQ [2]. This matching between the RFQ and DTL is described below. O/ 4 <b>Matching</b> <b>Transformer</b> Figure 1 shows the two-quadrupole-λ 4 <b>matching</b> <b>transformer</b> with an additional quadrupole placed at each end to produce the appropriate Twiss parameters to match to the FODO lattice of the downstream DTL. This 4 -quadrupole transport section will transform a beam with Twiss parameters βx 1 = β y 1 and α x 1 = −αy 1 to a beam having Twiss parameters βx 2 = β y 2 and α x 2 = −αy 2. The middle two focusing elements plus the three drift lengths comprise the λ 4 - (quarter wave) transport. Quadrupole Q 1, placed where βx = β y and α x = −αy, adjusts α while preserving the condition α x = −αy and is used to adjust the beam size at Q 2 while the quarter wave transformer preserves the condition βx = β y and α x = −αy. Quadrupole Q 2 is used to obtain the final desired α while again preserving the condition α x = −αy. Because of the time varying nature of the RFQ, the H+ and H − beams have the relationship α x (H+) = α x(H −), and α y(H +) = αy (H −) at the exit of the RFQ; but, in a dc quadrupole channel, the matched beam satisfies α x (H+) = α y(H −) and α y(H +) = αx (H −). By setting α x = αy = 0, for both H and H − at the end of the RFQ, the Brown-Servranckx [1] <b>matching</b> <b>transformer</b> can be used for matching...|$|R

50|$|The {{very high}} output {{impedance}} of valves (compared with transistors) usually requires <b>matching</b> <b>transformers</b> to drive low impedance loads such as loudspeakers or cutting lathe heads. The transformer {{is used as}} the load, {{in place of the}} resistor usually used in small-signal and driver stages. The reflected impedance of the transformer primary at the frequencies in use is much higher than the DC resistance of the windings, often kilohms. High performance transformers are, however, severe engineering compromises, are expensive and, in operation, are far from ideal. Output transformers dramatically increase the cost of a valve amplifier circuit compared to a direct-coupled transistor alternative. However, in both tube and solid state amps, <b>matching</b> output <b>transformers</b> are required for public address applications where low-loss high impedance/high voltage lines are used to connect multiple distant loudspeakers.|$|R
