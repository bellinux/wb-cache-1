40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to give voice to school nursing as a primary health care specialty, and to promote the {{development}} of school nursing in New Zealand. School nursing is an invisible practice specialty that is largely funded from within the education sector, to address the health needs of student clients. School nursing is a significant primary health care initiative that can positively influence student health outcomes. My school nursing practice experience and philosophy is presented prior to reflecting upon the history of school nursing, and the health concerns present within the student population. The work then moves to review and critique school nursing literature from New Zealand, Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. This thesis highlights the need for collaborative policy and practice development initiatives including a legislative requirement for school nurses, school nursing competencies and standards, school nurse to student ratios, postgraduate training, professional liaison, practice funding, and research. A discourse on the reflective topical autobiographical method introduces <b>autobiographical</b> <b>poetry</b> from school nursing practice and reflective inquiry, as the central research endeavour of this thesis. <b>Autobiographical</b> <b>poetry</b> is offered as a window to this specialty practice, and accompanying reflections allow access to a further layer of practice knowledge. Student health needs, the scope of nursing intewentions, and the essences of school nursing practice have been distilled from the poetry. Poetic representation and subsequent reflection has facilitated {{the development of a}} school nursing framework for use within the New Zealand context, entitled Health Mediation in School Nursing. School nursing is presented throughout this thesis as an important child and adolescent primary health care initiative, which has the potential to reduce health barriers to learning, improve student health outcomes, and build student success in the social, emotional, and educational domains...|$|R
40|$|THESIS 10462 In {{his review}} of Maggot (2010), {{published}} in The New York Times Book Review, Richard Eder writes that ?Paul Muldoon is a shape-shifting Proteus to readers who try to pin him down?

This thesis examines Muldoon?s poetic first- person voice {{in light of the}} concepts of autobiography and autofiction. My intent is not to put his poetry within specific theoretical strangleholds, but rather argue that theories of <b>autobiographical</b> <b>poetry</b> and of autofiction may open up new ways of reading his work and understanding the poetic ?I?. This thesis argues that, although Muldoon weaves unmediated autobiographical elements into his writing, he also creates a strategically fictional first-person voice in order to blur the frontiers between authenticity and artfulness...|$|R

40|$|Research {{suggests}} that, {{compared to}} heterosexual counterparts, {{gay men and}} other sexual minorities are at higher risk of developing emotional distress and mental disorders.

Little {{research has been done}} to illuminate the lived experience of exposure to prejudiced behaviors and attitudes and this inquiry aims to begin to fill this gap by addressing the following questions: What is the experience of being mistreated for being gay or perceived as gay? What is the experience of being exposed to sexual prejudice when one is gay? Using the writing of <b>autobiographical</b> <b>poetry</b> as a process of inquiry and the resulting poems as narrative data, I explore my own experiences with antigay encounters and sexual prejudice over the course of my life.

5000|$|Ulrich {{is famous}} for his {{supposedly}} <b>autobiographical</b> <b>poetry</b> collection Frauendienst (Service of the Lady). He writes {{of himself as a}} protagonist who does great deeds of honor to married noblewomen, following the conventions of chaste courtly love. The protagonist embarks on two remarkable quests. In the first quest, he travels from Venice to Vienna in the guise of Venus, the goddess of love. He competes in jousts and tourneys and challenges all the knights he meets to a duel in the honour of his lady. He breaks 307 lances and defeats all comers. The noblewoman, however, mostly spurns his affections and demands more deeds and even mutilation for even the honour to hold her hand. In the second quest, he takes on the role of King Arthur ("Artus"), with his followers becoming Arthurian Round Table characters. Regrettably, the first two pages of the beginning have been lost to time. The protagonist, Ulrich, wanders through Styria and Austria in the guise of King Arthur inviting all knights to [...] "break lance" [...] (that is, to joust) three times with him for honor's sake. In this disguise he attended many tournaments. The story illustrates how a worthy knight-errant was supposed to wander about defeating opponents in honorable combat. The story intersperses some songs and courtly advice to knights and some admonitions to greedy nobles and faithless squires. The collection was finished in 1255.|$|R

[...] He describes recovering from this [...] "five years ago last All Saints" [...] - 1 November 1414 (Complaint, 11.55-6) - but nevertheless still experiences extreme social alienation as a result of gossip about this period of insanity. The Series continues with the [...] "Dialog with a Friend," [...] which claims to be written after his recovery and gives a pathetic picture of a poor poet, now fifty-three, with sight and mind impaired; in it he tells the unnamed friend about his plans to write a tale he owes his good patron, Humphrey of Gloucester, and of translating a portion of Henry Suso's popular Latin treatise on the art of dying (a task the friend discourages him from, pointing out that too much study was the cause of his mental illness). The Series then fulfills this plan, continuing with his moralized tales of Jereslau's Wife and of Jonathas (both from the Gesta Romanorum). The Series next turns to the Learn to die, a theologically and psychologically astute verse translation of Henry Suso's Latin prose Ars Moriendi (Book II, Chapter 2 of the Horologium Sapientiae).

40|$|In 1967, La Prensa Literaria, Nicaragua’s {{most highly}} {{regarded}} literary magazine, laments that Nicaragua is “overpopulated” by “poetesses” who outnumber male poets 1, 000 to 700 {{in the capital}} alone. Nicaraguan women were virtually invisible in their nation’s literary history until {{the future of a}} revolutionary “new Nicaragua” was being imagined by an idealist, nationalist, socialist, but not always feminist, Sandinista movement. Through the literary magazines founded by the Sandinista National Liberation Front, these spokeswomen and activists published transformative <b>autobiographical</b> <b>poetry</b> chronicling the aesthetic, social, and political birth of the “new woman” in Nicaragua. This poetry introduced a new voice – that of a self-reflective revolutionary womanhood. The focus of this paper is the construction Sandinista womanhood through its autobiographical depiction in a full range of embodied self-expression. This paper will examine the poetry of six influential guerilla poets of the revolution – Daisy Zamora, Gioconda Belli, Yolanda Blanco, Michele Najlis, Vidaluz Meneses, and Rosario Murillo, wife of Sandinista leader and president of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega – all of whom vocalize the emergence of the “New Nicaraguan Woman” as experienced in the physical body. 	Unapologetically presented in cycles of menstruation, states of pregnancy, labor of childbirth, and climaxes of erotic ecstasy, these poets challenge the bourgeois chivalry of the ruling class for which graphic references to the female body are considered indecent. Depicted as well in acts of volunteerism, advocacy, and armed rebellion, these poets reveal bodies in the act of creating the New Nicaragua and defy the overshadowing masculinist content typical of testimonial poetry dedicated to the insurrection of macho rebel leaders...|$|R

In 1974, he moved to West Los Angeles where he met and befriended future Germs band members Darby Crash and Pat Smear at University High. After graduating from high school, Roessler went on to study {{classical}} music at California State University, Northridge, for a few semesters before leaving in early 1978 to join innovative electropunk band, The Screamers. After two successful years, The Screamers found themselves rapidly disintegrating as a band, causing Roessler to leave in January 1980, and would {{then go on to}} play in Nervous Gender with former Germs drummer Don Bolles as well as in Geza X and the Mommymen. After a few months of going between bands, he was recruited by Nina Hagen to join her for an upcoming European tour. After touring Europe and America with Hagen, they recorded Nunsexmonkrock. Before Roessler's second tour with Hagen, Pat Smear from the Germs joined the band. Later, when Smear left the band, Roessler left also. In 1981, he formed the band Twisted Roots with Smear and sister Kira Roessler. During this time, he was playing with 45 Grave, Josie Cotton, DC3 (with Dez Cadena of Black Flag) and Crimony (with Mike Watt) as well. Roessler was also doing sessions with many other bands such as the Dead Kennedys and Saccharine Trust. Roessler has continued to work with Nina Hagen and Josie Cotton.

40|$|For most {{scholars}} of Romanticism, honor is a traditionalist value. It underwrites Edmund Burke's defense against revolutionary radicalism; {{it is the}} code of medieval crusaders and tribal highlanders in Walter Scott's novels; {{and it is a}} quality reserved for nobles such as Lady Catherine de Bourgh in Pride and Prejudice, who relies on honor to assert her privilege {{in the face of the}} rising middle-class. Despite these conservative connotations, The Life of Honor shows that early-nineteenth-century writers did not simply consider honor a reactionary ethos. Rather, they saw how honor could be progressive and egalitarian [...] a modern virtue that allowed them to grapple with the dilemmas of emerging liberal society. A personal sense of communal obligation, the modern honor ethic balanced the individualism emphasized by the republican political movement with the demands of a rapidly changing social order. Reading texts from a variety of authors and genres [...] Godwin's Jacobin novel, Wordsworth's <b>autobiographical</b> <b>poetry,</b> Scott and Austen's historical fiction, and the brutal slave narrative of Mary Prince [...] I demonstrate how this ancient civic virtue was reinvigorated in response to some of the most pressing cultural questions of the day, conflicts between the self and society that could not be resolved through the operations of sympathy or the power of the imagination. Because this modern form of honor emerged from post-revolutionary life, it was associated with a new political order: liberalism, a set of civic norms that began to thrive in the late-eighteenth-century and that still prevails in Europe today. While the Romantic honor code drew upon the liberal commitment to universal dignity and individual merit, Romantic honor simultaneously illuminated the conceptual problems of liberalism [...] its propensity to rank independence over obligation; to connect private commercial success with public virtue; and to abstract social predicaments from identity categories like race and gender. Responding to recent scholarship on the liberal disposition in Romantic pedagogy and nineteenth-century Realist aesthetics, The Life of Honor reveals the paradox of a civil society built around the pursuit of individual esteem and thus the wager of Romanticism's political commitments...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{a crucial}} {{area in the}} translation of poetic discourse, the translatability of modern Arabic metaphor into English. Two main questions are addressed. Firstly, what makes a particular metaphor easy to translate? Secondly, what makes another metaphor difficult or even impossible to translate? The thesis consists of two parts, theory and data analysis. The first part, theory, contains five chapters. In chapter 1 general theories of metaphor are discussed; interaction, imagination and experientialist theory. In chapter 2 poetic metaphor is examined; its interpretation, its aesthetic values, the part played by the imagination in processing metaphor, the importance of cultural knowledge and the problems of translation. In chapter 3 the metonymymetaphor relationship is assessed, and in chapter 4 the notion of dead metaphor is examined. In chapter 5, light is shed {{on the use of}} poetic metaphor in the Arab media and in particular on its use as an effective device to persuade the audience to accept the current peace discourse in the Middle East. Part 2, data analysis, also consists of five chapters of which chapter 6 is the introduction to the data analysis, and links the two parts of the thesis together. Chapters 7 to 10 concern the translation of metaphor in particular categories of poetry: in chapter 7 the emphasis is on <b>autobiographical</b> <b>poetry</b> (Ghäzi al-Ghusaybi : "In the Grip of My Fifties" and "Making Me a Grandfather"). In chapter 8 {{the focus is on the}} poetry of exile (Fadwä Tüqän: "Ruqayya" and "The Call of the Land"). In chapter 9 nationalist poetry is discusses (Fadwä Tüqan: "My Sad City" and "Hamza"), while in chapter 10 socio-political poetry is considered (Salah `Abd al-Sabür : "Sadness"). The findings of this research may be summarised as follows: the translation of Arabic poetic metaphor into English requires most importantly the recreation of a similar cultural experience in the TL. The data analysis shows that, in certain cases, it is easy to restructure the ST metaphoric experience with the same experience in the TL. On numerous occasions, however, the SL metaphoric experience has to be rendered by a different metaphor exhibiting a similar, or parallel, experience. Lastly, the data also demonstrate to the reader how, in certain contexts, the ST metaphor is untranslatable, simply because the host language cannot express satisfactorily the ST thought in the same or a similar way...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MA (Afrikaans en Nederlands)) [...] PU vir CHO, 1996 This study {{investigates the}} character, manifestation and {{function}} of <b>autobiographical</b> codes in <b>poetry</b> and specifically in the poetry of T. T. Cloete. Method A distinction is made between a poem with autobiographical codes and an autobiographical poem. Although autobiographical codes are used in both, the autobiographical contract is clearly manifested in the autobiographical poem {{with the result that}} the poet becomes more than a mere intertext - the poet also becomes the text. The autobiographical information then not only broadens the written text, but also assists in exposing the poet himself. The theory of autobiography is used to explicate this distinction as well as to indicate how the autobiographical poem is accommodated within the genre. Concerning the poem with autobiographical codes, this study is based on a systems theory approach which pays special attention to the importance of codes in the creation of meaning and comprehensibility. At the same time, emphasis is placed on the role of intertextuality during decoding – especially on the author or poet as intertext. In this instance the poetry of T. T. Cloete, rich with autobiographical reference, is interpreted according to the theoretical conclusions drawn. Conclusion Through the investigation of <b>autobiographical</b> codes in <b>poetry,</b> this study proves that there is a remarkable distinction between an autobiographical poem and a poem with autobiographical codes. This distinction directs the reader towards the most suitable theoretical substructure and act as guidelines for a reading strategy. The identification and use of autobiographical codes in the poetry of T. T. Cloete - with regard to the distinctions mentioned above - broaden the analysis and interpretation of the poems on a cognitive as well as an emotive level. Master...|$|R
40|$|The {{critical}} component of this thesis investigates <b>autobiographical</b> medical <b>poetry</b> written {{from the perspective of}} doctor, patient and parent {{in the context of a}} growing global interest in the relationship between medicine and poetry, and in the medical humanities. Its focus is the poets’ use of medical discourse and the discourse of the personal, social world, and the ways in which their poems often echo the work of sociologists, revealing an inequity in doctor-patient relationships. The research also reveals a bias among some reviewers towards the poetry of doctors, and a contrasting tendency to accuse the patient-poets of solipsism, or the inability to go beyond self-referential anecdote. In response to such reviews, the {{critical component}} analyses the ways in which the poems have been carefully crafted, with attention to the blending or juxtaposition of biomedical and lifeworld discourses to a polemical end, moving the personal to the universal, and calling for more individualised patient care. In this way, the poetry of all three groups is found to be reflective of the contemporary socio-cultural backdrop of narrative medicine and medical humanities programmes around the world. The creative component, a book-length manuscript of poems called “Family History,” explores the relationship between biomedical and lifeworld discourses in the light of the study undertaken in the critical component and also in response to the personal medical experience of the author and her family...|$|R
40|$|Part myth, part <b>autobiographical</b> essay, part <b>poetry,</b> part bestiary, this {{collection}} of prose/poems interrogates the Mexican immigrant condition by imagining it as a physical space—a dark, liminal forest, where Mexican immigrants {{have been reduced to}} animals to exist in a kind of purgatory. The Beast Meridian is a line and a condition that confines the animals and the speaker, Alma, to their animal form in a cursed forest shadowland, which renders the animals invisible to their former life and {{to the rest of the}} world. Each animal narrates from behind the Beast Meridian, a border which, if crossed, could transfigure these animals back into their human form, but each attempt to cross further curses them, relegating them to deeper darkness and obscurity. The cursed forest these animals inhabit is at once a metaphor for depression, suicide, poverty, and the reality of racism and oppression toward Mexican immigrants in the US, which renders them invisible while they are stripped of their humanity, treated as animals and pests to be exterminated, worked like beasts of burden, consigned to hard labor in long shifts behind the scenes, and bound to the shadows of society...|$|R
40|$|Autobiography is a {{slippery}} genre, if, indeed, it is a genre. To deal with its slipperiness I use action research and qualitative inquiry {{to create a}} bricolage, an artist's book, Tissue. Within the patchwork, stitched-together form of Tissue, digitised text and images (<b>autobiographical</b> stories, <b>poetry,</b> photographs, drawings and paintings) sit in varying relationships to each other. Also, I use poetic language and images to display aspects of the discourse of memory in digitally manipulated text/images where language and image are not illustrative of each other but are interconnected and equal, synergetic, creating new meanings. To simultaneously enhance the handleability of the pages and distance their electronic nature, I use {{a number of different}} papers and fabrics as the skins of the images. Using the ideas of Roland Barthes (principally) and others as reference points, in this exegesis Re-picturing my life, I address {{the ways in which the}} present is informed by the past; self, identity and the body; the function of memory, and its mediation and articulation in the narration of autobiography; the significance of autobiographical objects and landscapes, and the nature of an autobiographical author. I also explore the effects on myself, as a migrant, of the fragility of identity in the face of major social disruptions such as mutiple migrations, and consider whether the narration of personal experience through autobiography aids in the construction of a new identity that is more grounded in the new surroundings. In this exegesis I argue that, in this process of revisiting the past and reconstructing narrative, text and image in my artist's book, I have both re-written and re-pictured my life. Yet, while this process of regaining and articulating my lost family information seems to have initiated some bodily changes, and, more importantly, appears to have strengthened and stabilised my sense of self, it has not alleviated my feelings of exile. Indeed, my feelings of exile and the absence of any single identifiable homeland have strengthened...|$|R
40|$|The American poet Elizabeth Bishop (1911 - 1979) {{published}} {{only four}} small volumes of poetry during her lifetime. When she died her reputation was modest, {{but since then}} her poetry has gradually gained respect and popularity with a general audience.

I discuss her artistic development from “antiautobiographical” to <b>autobiographical</b> poet. Bishop’s <b>poetry</b> is subjective right from the start, but none of the early poems are explicitly autobiographical. However, as her writing emerged she became more directly personal, and the poems of her last book are deeply rooted in childhood memories and loss.
