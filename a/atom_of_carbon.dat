The number of organic compounds is immense and the known number of defined compounds is close to 10 million. However, an indefinitely large number of such compounds are theoretically possible. By definition, an organic compound must contain at least one <b>atom</b> <b>of</b> <b>carbon,</b> but this criterion is not generally regarded as sufficient.

50|$|Carbon is {{the fourth}} most {{abundant}} element in the universe by mass after hydrogen, helium and oxygen and {{is the second most}} abundant element in the human body by mass after oxygen, the third most abundant by number of atoms. There are an almost infinite number of compounds that contain carbon due to carbon's ability to form long stable chains of C — C bonds. The simplest carbon-containing molecules are the hydrocarbons, which contain carbon and hydrogen, although they sometimes contain other elements in functional groups. Hydrocarbons are used as fossil fuels and to manufacture plastics and petrochemicals. All organic compounds, those essential for life, contain at least one <b>atom</b> <b>of</b> <b>carbon.</b> When combined with oxygen and hydrogen, carbon can form many groups of important biological compounds including sugars, lignans, chitins, alcohols, fats, and aromatic esters, carotenoids and terpenes. With nitrogen it forms alkaloids, and with the addition of sulfur also it forms antibiotics, amino acids, and rubber products. With the addition of phosphorus to these other elements, it forms DNA and RNA, the chemical-code carriers of life, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the most important energy-transfer molecule in all living cells.|$|E

40|$|Usual heat {{treatments}} of steels like austenitization are generally conducted in air. In such atmosphere, a part <b>of</b> the <b>atoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>carbon</b> could {{be removed from}} the superficial zone of steel. Indeed, those <b>atoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>carbon,</b> combined with oxygen present in atmosphere, can take gaseous form <b>of</b> <b>carbon</b> monoxide due to the great attraction between <b>atoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>carbon</b> and oxygen. This well-known phenomenon is called decarburizing. It can change microstructure to a large extent and, as a result, bring dramatic modifications of mechanical properties of steel, like decrease of fatigue lifetime. To characterize the extent of decarburizing phenomenon, observations by optical microscopy and/or hardness profiles measurements must be performed in a cross section, as it is advised by international standard. Until today, the eddy current technique is used to detect superficial defects. In practice, the control consists to create two groups of available samples or not, from a large sampling. In this study, we propose to estimate the decarburizing extent. In the present work, different durations of austenitizing at 920 °C temperature before oil quenching (50 °C) were performed on the SAE 92 V 45 steel in order to obtain various morphologies and different total depths of the decarburized zone. We will show, in the continuation, how eddy currents control is used to assess the level of decarburizing after a Fourier transformation performed on the output signal. This analysis allows us to link the harmonic decomposition of the signal to the duration of the heat treatment and/or to the total decarburizing depth and, consequently, to the mechanical properties...|$|R

Chemical equilibrium is determined by either of the equilibrium constant and the minimization of the Gibbs free energy. In equilibrium modeling, it is assumed that biomass is dry and ash free and contains of C, H, and O; the elements nitrogen and sulfur were not considered because biomass contains a negligible amount of both in comparison with carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, while these are significant elements in coal.

The organic carbon and the oxygen consumption kinetics were evaluated; RESULTS: Irrespective of to the experimental condition, the leachates were mainly utilized for catabolic processes (i. e., respiration), mineralization was slightly faster in an aerobic environment (1. 22 fold) and in this condition, the yield of refractory products was smaller (2. 3 %); the O/C stoichiometric ratios values (oxygen consumed per <b>atom</b> <b>of</b> <b>carbon)</b> from mineralization of the 2 types of leachates were similar (ca. 1. 12); CONCLUSIONS: According to these results we conclude that the leachate from selected macrophytes is rapidly decomposed and subsidize primariy the microbial catabolism (aerobic or anaerobic); in addition, we propose that S. molesta contributes more to the input of dissolved organic matter within the reservoir...|$|E
