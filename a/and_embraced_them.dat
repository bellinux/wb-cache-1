25|$|Truffaut {{was born}} in Paris on 6 February 1932. His mother was Janine de Montferrand. His mother's future husband, Roland Truffaut, {{accepted}} him as an adopted son and gave him his surname. He was passed around to live with various nannies and his grandmother {{for a number of}} years. It was his grandmother who instilled in him her love of books and music. He lived with his grandmother until her death when Truffaut was eight years old. It was only after his grandmother's death that he lived with his parents for the first time. The identity of Truffaut's biological father was unknown, though a private detective agency in 1968 revealed that their inquiry into the matter led to a Roland Levy, a Jewish dentist from Bayonne. Truffaut's mother's family disputed the findings but Truffaut himself believed <b>and</b> <b>embraced</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E

Joseph took them from between his knees, bowed deeply, and brought them to Jacob, with Ephraim in his right hand toward Jacob's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Jacob's right hand. But Jacob laid his right hand on Ephraim, the younger, and his left hand on Manasseh, the firstborn, and prayed that God bless the lads, let Jacob's name be named in them, and let them grow into a multitude. The second reading ( [...] , aliyah) ends here.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the time}} he was {{appointed}} governor, Clark appreciated his own capabilities <b>and</b> <b>embraced</b> <b>them</b> rather than turning them away. [...] when he took office, America was involved in the War of 1812 with the British. [...] Clark feared the influence the British would have on the Native Americans. [...] British tactics would include the use of Indians as allies in the fighting against the United States. In return for British victory, Indians would either be able to continue to occupy their current land or receive lands back that were taken from them previously by the United States Government. Clark held office for the next seven years until he was voted out of office in 1820, in the first election after Missouri became a state. He was defeated by Alexander McNair.|$|E
50|$|The film {{plays with}} clichés and stereotypes, mocking <b>and</b> <b>embracing</b> <b>them</b> {{at the same}} time. Luhrmann has also commented that the film {{revolves}} around stories similar to David and Goliath, Cinderella and The Ugly Duckling.|$|R

60|$|Tom thanked her; and the woman, {{sitting down}} on the floor, drew up her knees, <b>and</b> <b>embracing</b> <b>them</b> with her arms, looked fixedly before her, with a bitter and painful {{expression}} of countenance. Her bonnet fell back, and long wavy streams of black hair fell around her singular and melancholy-face.|$|R

[Sidenote: Sir Tristram and Sir Blamor are reconciled] Then {{those two}} noble, {{excellent}} knights took {{one another by}} the hand and went forward together to where King Arthur sat in high estate, and all those who looked on and beheld that reconciliation gave loud acclaim. And when King Arthur beheld them coming thus, he arose from where he sat and met them <b>and</b> <b>embraced</b> <b>them</b> both, and he said: [...] "I do not believe that any king can have greater glory in his life than this, to have such knights about him as ye be." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{letter was}} very simple, and Isa, {{when she had}} written it, {{subsided}} into all her customary quiescence. Indeed, when Herbert came to the Ludwigs Strasse, not in the evening as he was bidden to do, but instantly, leaving his own dinner uneaten, and coming upon the Heines {{in the midst of}} their dinner, she was more than usually tranquil. But his love was, as she had told him, boisterous. He could not contain himself, <b>and</b> <b>embraced</b> <b>them</b> all, and then scolded Isa because she was so calm.|$|E
60|$|Although Ned was a lad of sixteen, {{he had a}} great cry {{over this}} letter, but it did him good, and it was with a softer heart that he {{prepared}} to receive his mother and her husband that evening. The meeting passed off better than he had anticipated. Mrs. Mulready was really affected at seeing her children again, <b>and</b> <b>embraced</b> <b>them,</b> Ned thought, with more fondness than she had done when they went away. Mr. Mulready spoke genially and kindly, and Ned began to hope that things would not be so bad after all.|$|E

It is known that Wolverine and Sabretooth were victims of the Cold War supersoldier program Weapon X, and that Sabretooth saw Wolverine as competition and therefore antagonized him. While Wolverine is depicted as suppressing his more savage qualities, Sabretooth does the opposite <b>and</b> <b>embraces</b> <b>them,</b> until the events of AXIS.|$|R

60|$|Their {{borrowed}} finery {{was soon}} got rid of, {{and in their}} shirts and trousers the boys proceeded. Presently they came suddenly upon four peasants seated on the ground, who upon seeing them leaped {{to their feet and}} greeted them with signs of vehement joy, making signs to them to follow them, and presently led them to a spot where the remains of the insurgent band were gathered. A shout greeted them {{as soon as they were}} recognized, and Count Stanislas, running forward, threw his arms round their necks <b>and</b> <b>embraced</b> <b>them,</b> while the other leaders crowded round.|$|E
60|$|Look, {{the sun was}} rising. On {{the eastern}} sky of a sudden two golden doors had opened in the canopy of night, and {{in and out of}} them seemed to pass glittering, swift-winged things, as souls might tread the Gate of Heaven. Look, too, at the little clouds that in an unending stream floated out of the gloom--travellers pressed onwards by a breath of destiny. They were leaden-hued, all of them, black, indeed, at times, until they caught the radiance, and for a while became like the pennons of an angel's wings. Then one by one the glory overtook <b>and</b> <b>embraced</b> <b>them,</b> and they melted into it to be seen no more.|$|E
60|$|There was {{not much}} more {{in the way of}} speech {{possible}} to any of them, for even Aunt Letty was far gone in tender wailing; and it was wonderful to see the liberties that were taken even with that venerable bonnet. The women had first of all taken hold of her hands to kiss them, and had kissed her feet, and her garments, and her shoulders, and then behind her back they had made crosses on her, although they knew how dreadfully she would have raged had she caught them polluting her by such doings; and they grasped her arms <b>and</b> <b>embraced</b> <b>them,</b> till at last, those who were more daring, reached her forehead and her face, and poor old Aunt Letty, who in her emotion could not now utter a syllable, was almost pulled to pieces among them.|$|E
5000|$|She {{left behind}} the {{traditional}} feminist movement, because she considered it banal, antisexual and over-politicized.

She looks {{forward to the day}} we can all be just [...] "sexual." [...] In recent years she has criticized Eve Ensler's The Vagina Monologues, which she believes has a negative and restrictive view of sexuality and an anti-male bias.|$|R
5000|$|The Bodo League (National Guidance Alliance, 국민보도연맹; gukmin bodo rungmaeng, 國民保導聯盟) was {{established}} on April 20, 1949, {{in order to}} convert left-wingers residing in South Korea, including former members of South Korean Workers Party(남조선로동당; 南朝鮮勞動黨), <b>and</b> <b>embrace</b> <b>them</b> as citizens of the [...] "democratic" [...] South Korea. However, its goal was an apparent manipulative tactic of the right-wing South Korean government to identify potential communists within the South and eventually eliminate them by execution {{around the time of}} the Korean War.|$|R
6000|$|And so Captain Boltrope was my father. Heavens! Was it a dream? I {{recalled}} his stern manner, his observant eye, his ill-concealed uneasiness when in my presence. I longed to embrace him. Staggering to my feet, I rushed in my scanty apparel to the deck, where Captain Boltrope was just then engaged in receiving the Governor's wife and daughter. The ladies shrieked; the youngest, a beautiful girl, blushed deeply. Heeding them not, I sank at his feet, <b>and,</b> <b>embracing</b> <b>them,</b> cried,-- ...|$|R
60|$|While the Princess was {{dressing}} the Princes went {{to throw}} {{themselves at the}} Sultan their father's feet, and pay their respects to him. But when they came before him they found he had been informed of their arrival by {{the chief of the}} Princess's eunuchs, and by what means the Princess had been perfectly cured. The Sultan received <b>and</b> <b>embraced</b> <b>them</b> with the greatest joy, both for their return and the recovery of the Princess his niece, whom he loved as well {{as if she had been}} his own daughter, and who had been given over by the physicians. After the usual ceremonies and compliments the Princes presented each his rarity: Prince Houssain his tapestry, which he had taken care not to leave behind him in the Princess's chamber; Prince Ali his ivory perspective glass, and Prince Ahmed his artificial apple; and after each had commended their present, when they put it into the Sultan's hands, they begged of him to pronounce their fate, and declare to which of them he would give the Princess Nouronnihar for a wife, according to his promise.|$|E
60|$|Then the eldress {{sat down}} and an elder arose, who bade the young people come forward to {{the centre of the}} line, where the elders and eldresses were sitting. He took his place behind them, and once more and for the last time he conjured them not to persist if they felt any doubt of themselves. He warned them that if they entered into the married state, and {{afterwards}} repented to the point of seeking divorce, the divorce would indeed be granted them, but on terms, as they must realize, of lasting grief to themselves through the offence they would commit against the commonwealth. They answered that they were sure of themselves, and ready to exchange their troth for life and death. Then they joined hands, and declared that they took each other for husband and wife. The congregation broke into another hymn and slowly dispersed, leaving the bride and groom with their families, who came up to them <b>and</b> <b>embraced</b> <b>them,</b> pressing their cheeks against the cheeks of the young pair.|$|E
6000|$|This witness's manner {{when making}} the {{deposition}} at her residence was afterward {{described by the}} district attorney as most extraordinary. Twice she had refused to testify, and once, when the deposition lacked nothing but her signature, she had caught it from the clerk's hands and torn it in pieces. She had called her children to the bedside <b>and</b> <b>embraced</b> <b>them</b> with streaming eyes, then suddenly sending them from the room, she verified her statement by oath and signature, and fainted-- [...] "slick away," [...] said the district attorney. It {{was at that time}} that her physician, arriving upon the scene, took in the situation at a glance and grasping the representative of the law by the collar chucked him into the street and kicked his assistant after him. The insulted majesty of the law was not vindicated; the victim of the indignity did not even mention anything of all this in court. He was ambitious to win his case, and the circumstances of the taking of that deposition were not such as would give it weight if related; and after all, the man on trial had committed an offense against the law's majesty only less heinous than that of the irascible physician.|$|E
5000|$|Billboard {{magazine}} {{recognized the}} group as one of K-pop’s top competitive music producers of today: [...] "Co-writing and producing on nearly every track, the K-pop phenoms proved how they can compete with top pop acts." [...] All {{members of the group}} participate in composing and producing the group’s songs. The Daily Dot describes them as [...] "setting a standard for the bands that will come after them. Their souls are in their performances because they helped to create them—an investment that makes all the difference between memorizing dance routines <b>and</b> <b>embracing</b> <b>them</b> with passion." ...|$|R

[p.291] Scarcely had I {{taken my}} {{place at the}} cool windowsill,-it was {{the best in the}} room,-when the {{visitors}} began to pour in, and the Shaykh rose to welcome <b>and</b> <b>embrace</b> <b>them.</b> They sat down, smoked, chatted politics, asked all manner of questions about the other wayfarers and absent friends; drank coffee; and, after half an hour's visit, rose abruptly, <b>and,</b> exchanging <b>embraces,</b> took leave. The little men entered the assembly, after an accolade at the door, noiselessly, squatted upon the worst seats with polite conges {{to the rest of the}} assembly; smoked, took their coffee, as it were, under protest, and glided out of the room as quietly as they crept in.|$|R
6000|$|Our sympathies {{were excited}} at the outset. We beheld a lady-like woman who {{answered}} {{to the name}} of [...] "Grace;" [...] and an old gentleman, dressed in dingy black, who personated her father, the Curate; and who was, on this occasion (I presume through unavoidable circumstances), neither more nor less than--drunk. There was no mistaking {{the cause of the}} fixed leer in the reverend gentleman's eye; of the slow swaying in his gait; of the gruff huskiness in his elocution. It appeared, from the opening dialogue, that a pending law-suit, and the absence of his daughter Fanny in London, combined to make him uneasy in his mind just at present. But he was by no means so clear on this subject as could be desired--in fact, he spoke through his nose, put in and left out his hs in the wrong places, and involved his dialogue in a long labyrinth of parentheses whenever he expressed himself at any length. It was not until the entrance of his daughter Fanny (just arrived from London: nobody knew why or wherefore), that he grew more emphatic and intelligible. We now observed with pleasure that he gave his children his blessing <b>and</b> <b>embraced</b> <b>them</b> both at once; and we were additionally gratified by hearing from his own lips, that his [...] "daughters were the h'all on which his h'all depended--that they would watch h'over his 'ale autumn; and that whatever happened the whole party must invariably trust in heabben's obdipotent power!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Nay, my brethren, {{the saints}} under the Levitical Law, {{who had not}} the new {{covenant}} sealed or confirmed any further than by promise that it should be; I say, they, when they thought of the glorious privileges that God had promised should come, though at that time they were not come, but seen afar off, how confidently were they persuaded of them, <b>and</b> <b>embraced</b> <b>them,</b> and were so fully satisfied as touching the certainty of them, {{that they did not}} stick at the parting with all for the enjoying of them. [Shall not we then that see all things already done before us make it a strong argument to increase our faith (Heb 11).] How many times doth David in the Psalms admire, triumph, and persuade others to do so also, through the faith that he had in the thing that was to be done? Also Job, in what faith doth he say he should see his Redeemer, though He had not then shed one drop of blood for him, yet because He had promised so to do; and this was signified by the blood of bulls and goats. Also Samuel, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Zechariah, etc., how gloriously in confidence did they speak of Christ, and His death, blood, conquest, and everlasting priesthood, even before He did manifest Himself in the flesh which He took of the Virgin. [For they were so many sure promises, with a remembrance in them, also for the better satisfaction of them that believed them]. We that have lived since Christ, have more ground to hope than they under the old covenant had, though they had the word of the just God for the ground of their faith. Mark, they had only the promise that He should and would come; but we have the assured fulfilling of those promises, because He is come; they were told that He should spill His blood, but we do see He hath spilt His blood; they ventured all upon His standing Surety for them, but we see He hath fulfilled, and that faithfully too, the office of His Suretyship, in that, according to the engagement, He hath redeemed us poor sinners; they ventured on the new covenant, though not actually sealed, only [...] "because He judged Him faithful who had promised" [...] (Heb 11:11). But we have the covenant sealed, all things are completely done, even as sure as the heart-blood of a crucified Jesus can make it.|$|E

50|$|At the altar, we {{see what}} has terrified the captive women: a lumbering beast emerges from the jungle, {{humanoid}} but grossly misshapen. It approaches the nude women <b>and</b> <b>embraces</b> <b>them</b> in a bizarre appropriation of the sex act and then tears them limb from limb. The next morning, Alma tells Jim that the beast's appearance is what has driven her people back to their primitive ways, sacrificing village girls to the monster. She explains that the creature only wants women; the mutilations are its way of sexually satisfying itself. Her people believe {{that if they do}} not sacrifice their girls, the creature will destroy them all.|$|R
50|$|From {{the notion}} of the {{existence}} of God results the conception of the uniqueness of God; for the supposition of a plurality in His essence would nullify {{the notion of}} His existence. What the unit is to other numbers—forming <b>and</b> <b>embracing</b> <b>them,</b> yet still differing from them in essence—God is to the created beings. With the doctrine of the unity of God is connected the doctrine of the divine attributes. Here Joseph is in advance of his predecessors Saadia Gaon and Bahya ibn Paquda; and, like Maimonides, he concludes that no positive attributes, whether essential or unessential, can be posited of God, who is indefinable.|$|R

Lucien, an engaged young man arrives, soon followed by his fiancée, Angele, and her idiot-savant cousin, Bebe. Lucien wishes to have one last fling with his mistress, Claudine, before he marries; he has made up a man named Dondidier, like Algernon's Bunbury, so that he may visit him in the country. His bride-to-be has a jealous admirer, Maurice, who persuades her to follow her future husband to witness his philandering.|$|R

"Color Him Father" [...] is an unabashedly sentimental song {{in which}} a boy expresses his love for his stepfather, a hardworking and generous man who married his widowed mother, who had seven children, <b>and</b> <b>embraced</b> <b>them</b> as his own after her first husband was [...] "killed in the war." [...] ("She said she thought that she could never love again/And then there he stood with that big, wide grin.") The song's lyrics {{resonated}} strongly with the public in 1969, {{the height of the}} Vietnam War. The word [...] "color," [...] in the song, means [...] "label" [...] or [...] "call" [...] and follows the 'color' motif set in Barbra Streisand's 1963 release of My Coloring Book.

60|$|The two lime merchants, {{with their}} escort, entered the dominions of Miss Abbey Potterson, to whom their escort (presenting {{them and their}} pretended {{business}} over the half-door of the bar, in a confidential way) preferred his figurative request that 'a mouthful of fire' might be lighted in Cosy. Always well disposed to assist the constituted authorities, Miss Abbey bade Bob Gliddery attend the gentlemen to that retreat, and promptly enliven it with fire and gaslight. Of this commission the bare-armed Bob, leading the way with a flaming wisp of paper, so speedily acquitted himself, that Cosy seemed to leap out of a dark sleep <b>and</b> <b>embrace</b> <b>them</b> warmly, the moment they passed the lintels of its hospitable door.|$|R

The main objective of this group was to develop metapsychological [...] "techniques, methods, and training material" [...] for psychologists seeking to practice TIR. Gerbode strongly believed in TIR as a way to treat patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). TIR is based on Freud's metapsychology, which is the basis of psychoanalysis. Metapsychology promotes a person-centered process, based on direct experiences, to eliminate psychological symptoms experienced by people who experiences traumatic incidents.|$|R
40|$|Although {{discounts}} in art {{markets are}} commonplace, the phenomenon remains largely unresearched. This paper looks at how art market actors understand {{the functions of}} discounts, focusing on ‘suppliers’ {{of the market and}} drawing on qualitative interviews with artists and art dealers from New Delhi and Mumbai, conducted in January-April 2013. The theoretical basis of this paper is a cultural sociological stance on the functioning of markets, showing how a shared system of norms and values affects the operation of a market. Two circuits of commerce are distinguished in the Indian art market: internationally oriented artists and dealers, whose attitude towards discounts is shaped by the desire to defend the aesthetic value of art; and locally oriented artists and dealers, who are positive about giving discounts <b>and</b> <b>embrace</b> <b>them</b> as a legitimate element of their national culture...|$|R
