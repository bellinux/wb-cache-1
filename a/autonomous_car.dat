As technologies become smarter, the potential for {{swarm robotics}} improve and the coordination of multi robot system finds applications in various fields. This paper adds new perspective to <b>autonomous</b> <b>cars</b> by proposing to incorporate swarm robotics into it. This paper summarizes various algorithms used in swarm robotics that can also be used in <b>autonomous</b> <b>cars.</b> The current working of <b>autonomous</b> <b>cars</b> would tend to be inefficient in future when streets would be populated with them, by using our idea the efficiency would be improved massively...|$|R

25|$|In August 2013, Nissan {{announced}} {{its plans to}} launch several driverless cars by 2020. The company is building in Japan a dedicated autonomous driving proving ground, {{to be completed in}} 2014. Nissan installed its <b>autonomous</b> <b>car</b> technology in a Nissan Leaf for demonstration purposes. The car was demonstrated at Nissan 360 test drive event held in California in August 2013. In September 2013, the Leaf fitted the prototype Advanced Driver Assistance System was granted a license plate that allows to drive it on Japanese public roads. The testing car will be used by Nissan engineers to evaluate how its in-house autonomous driving software performs in the real-world. Time spent on public roads will help refine the car’s software for fully automated driving. The autonomous Leaf was demonstrated on public roads {{for the first time at}} a media event held in Japan in November 2013. The Leaf drove on the Sagami Expressway in Kanagawa prefecture, near Tokyo. Nissan vice chairman Toshiyuki Shiga and the prefecture’s Governor, Yuji Kuroiwa, rode in the car during the test.|$|E

50|$|<b>Autonomous</b> <b>car</b> {{liability}} (or {{liability of}} driverless cars, self-driving cars, or robotic cars) is a developing area {{of law and}} policy that will determine who is liable when an <b>autonomous</b> <b>car</b> causes harm to persons or property. As autonomous cars shift the responsibility of driving from humans to <b>autonomous</b> <b>car</b> technology, {{there is a need}} for existing liability laws to evolve in order to fairly identify the appropriate remedies for damage and injury. Increases in the use of <b>autonomous</b> <b>car</b> technologies (e.g. advanced driver-assistance systems) is not only causing incremental shifts in this responsibility of driving but also reducing the frequency of on the road accidents. As higher levels of autonomy are commercially introduced (level 3&4), the insurance industry stands to see greater proportions of commercial and product liability lines, while personal automobile insurance shrinks.|$|E

The first self-sufficient and truly <b>autonomous</b> <b>cars</b> appeared in the 1980s, with Carnegie Mellon University's Navlab and ALV projects in 1984 and Mercedes-Benz and Bundeswehr University Munich's EUREKA Prometheus Project in 1987. Since then, numerous major companies and research organizations have developed working prototype autonomous vehicles, including Mercedes-Benz, General Motors, Continental Automotive Systems, IAV, Autoliv Inc., Bosch, Nissan, Renault, Toyota, Audi, Hyundai Motor Company, Volvo, Tesla Motors, Peugeot, Local Motors, AKKA Technologies, Vislab from University of Parma, Oxford University and Google. In July 2013, Vislab demonstrated BRAiVE, a vehicle that moved autonomously on a mixed traffic route open to public traffic. In 2015, five US states (Nevada, Florida, California, Virginia, and Michigan) together with Washington, D.C. allowed the testing of fully <b>autonomous</b> <b>cars</b> on public roads.

30|$|As anticipated, the {{automotive}} industry could be transformed within the next decade due to this evolution, so corporations have also been exploring autonomous mobility. Interestingly though, those focusing on <b>autonomous</b> <b>cars</b> vary significantly, from traditional car manufacturing firms (e.g., Audi, Renault, Volkswagen, Volvo) to newly established ones manufacturing electric cars (e.g., Tesla) or global software firms (e.g., Apple, Google) with no prior experience in this industry.

40|$|Fully {{automated}} self-driving cars, with expected benefits including improved road safety, {{are closer}} to becoming a reality. Thus, attention has turned to gauging public perceptions of these autonomous vehicles. To date, surveys {{have focused on the}} public as potential passengers of <b>autonomous</b> <b>cars,</b> overlooking other road users who would interact with them. Comparisons with perceptions of other existing vehicles are also lacking. This study surveyed almost 1000 participants on their perceptions, particularly with regards to safety and acceptance of autonomous vehicles. Overall, results revealed that <b>autonomous</b> <b>cars</b> were perceived as a “somewhat low risk“ form of transport and, while concerns existed, there was little opposition to the prospect of their use on public roads. However, compared to human-operated <b>cars,</b> <b>autonomous</b> <b>cars</b> were perceived differently depending on the road user perspective: more risky when a passenger yet less risky when a pedestrian. <b>Autonomous</b> <b>cars</b> were also perceived as more risky than existing autonomous trains. Gender, age and risk-taking had varied relationships with the perceived risk of different vehicle types and general attitudes towards <b>autonomous</b> <b>cars.</b> For instance, males and younger adults displayed greater acceptance. Whilst their adoption of this autonomous technology would seem societally beneficial – due to these groups’ greater propensity for taking road user risks, behaviours linked with poorer road safety – other results suggested it might be premature to draw conclusions on risk-taking and user acceptance. Future studies should therefore continue to investigate people’s perceptions from multiple perspectives, taking into account various road user viewpoints and individual characteristics...|$|R

50|$|Some demonstrative systems, precursory to <b>autonomous</b> <b>cars,</b> {{date back}} to the 1920s and 1930s.

A major milestone was achieved in 1995, with CMU's NavLab 5 completing the first autonomous long distance drive in the United States. Of the 2,849 miles between Pittsburgh, PA and San Diego, CA, 2,797 miles were autonomous (98.2%), completed with an average speed of 63.8 miles per hour (102.3 km/h). Since then, numerous major companies and research organizations have developed working prototype autonomous vehicles.Among the potential benefits of <b>autonomous</b> <b>cars</b> is a significant reduction in traffic collisions; the resulting injuries; and related costs, including a lower need for insurance. <b>Autonomous</b> <b>cars</b> are also predicted to offer major increases in traffic flow; enhanced mobility for children, the elderly, disabled and poor people; the relief of travelers from driving and navigation chores; lower fuel consumption; significantly reduced needs for parking space in cities; a reduction in crime; and the facilitation of different business models for mobility as a service, especially those involved in the sharing economy.|$|R
