5|$|There have {{previously}} been attempts at pre-season friendlies between the reigning league <b>and</b> <b>cup</b> champions. For instance, the 2002 pre-season match between Rosenborg and Viking was played between the reigning league <b>and</b> <b>cup</b> champions, {{although it had}} no official status. Superfinalen was the first attempt to make an official tournament. Such a super cup is common between the domestic league <b>and</b> <b>cup</b> winners in many European countries, such as the English Charity Shield. Superfinalen also introduced philanthropy into such a match: the game was to be baked into a larger television event which would include concerts and entertainment {{in an attempt to}} generate revenue for charity. The matchday profits from the inaugural season were, along with the television fundraising, given to UNICEF, who used the revenue to fund part of a school project in Africa, which had been fronted by Ole Gunnar Solskjær.|$|E

He scored 19 goals in 37 league games in the 1965–66 season to help the team to a seventh-place finish. He scored 21 goals in 35 league <b>and</b> <b>cup</b> games in the 1966–67 season, but his 'free spirit' nature frustrated Gillies, who sanctioned Dougan's sale despite his good form.|$|E
