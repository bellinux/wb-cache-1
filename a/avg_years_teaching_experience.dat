40|$|Teachers bring {{a complex}} array of beliefs and attitudes to the {{teaching}} of literacy. The purpose of the study reported in this article was to investigate the nature of teacher attitudes towards the learning and teaching of writing {{in the first year of}} school and to identify any broad underlying attitudinal dimensions. The secondary aim was to examine the influence of experience on these attitudinal dimensions. Government school teachers (n= 228), from two Australian states, were surveyed using an instrument consisting of attitude statements which related to the learning and teaching of early literacy and more specifically early writing. An exploratory factor analysis was undertaken which indicated that, although most items appeared to be unrelated, a set of eight items coalesced to form a scale referred to as Teacher Attitudes towards Language, Thinking and Scaffolding. Analyses of variance were conducted to examine the relationship between <b>teaching</b> <b>experience</b> in general as well as specific early <b>years</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>experience</b> with the teacher attitude measure as the dependent variable. General <b>teaching</b> <b>experience</b> was not found to be significantly related to teacher attitude but increased amounts of early <b>years</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>experience</b> were found to significantly relate to support for a Vygotskian approach to the learning and teaching of writing in the first year of school. The outcomes identify the potential impact of accrued early years experience on teacher attitudes towards the learning and teaching of literacy to young children. While many of the teacher attitudes appeared to be disparate, the identified dimension indicates that there may be a consistent pattern of attitudes related to a Vygotskian approach to learning and teaching early writing. A second implication may be that longer periods of early <b>years</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>experience</b> may foster positive attitudes towards a Vygotskian teaching approach more quickly than general <b>teaching</b> <b>experience</b> in other settings...|$|R

40|$|Retaining highly {{qualified}} career and technical education teachers {{is important in}} maintaining and growing quality secondary career and technical education programs. Therefore, {{the purpose of this}} study was to identify factors contributing to teacher retention specifically in the area of career and technical education (CTE) and determine predictability of the factors‟ influence on secondary CTE teachers‟ intent to stay in or leave the teaching profession. The career and technical areas of family and consumer sciences, trade and industrial, health occupations, and agriculture in the state of Kansas made up the population for this study. The six factors that data were collected on were educational preparation, teacher commitment, first <b>year</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>experience,</b> skills and abilities, Social integration and institutional factors. Participants in this study perceived their educational preparation overall as good. No item was given an overall rating of excellent leaving room for improvement in this area. Overall, participants agreed with their commitment to teaching, items pertaining to the first <b>year</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>experience,</b> and their skills and abilities in the profession. Within the category of Social integration, teachers rated that gaining student respect was extremely important. CTE teachers surveyed rated an inner sense of knowing they are doing a good job as extremely important in the construct of institutional factors. All overall ratings of the six factors indicate that teachers tended to agree or rate as important the items under these constructs. Predicting the intent to stay in or leave the profession of teaching was analyzed quantitatively using discriminant analysis. Findings indicate the independent variables of educational preparation, teacher commitment, first <b>year</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>experience,</b> skills and abilities, Social integration, institutional factors, and content area did not have an influence in predicting CTE teachers‟ intent to stay in or leave the profession of teaching...|$|R
