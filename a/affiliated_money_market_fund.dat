40|$|The {{failure of}} the Reserve Primary <b>Fund,</b> a US <b>money</b> <b>market</b> <b>fund,</b> in September 2008 {{triggered}} a widespread withdrawal of assets from other <b>money</b> <b>market</b> <b>funds</b> in the US. The withdrawals led the US Government to adopt emergency measures to maintain market stability. The ability of <b>money</b> <b>market</b> <b>funds</b> to rapidly withdraw funding from the financial system also showed during the European sovereign debt crisis {{in the summer of}} 2011. The crisis prompted further regulatory debate {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic on how to make <b>money</b> <b>market</b> <b>funds</b> more resilient to investors’ runs and systemic shocks. The solutions that are currently discussed propose to eliminate the essential bank-like feature of <b>money</b> <b>market</b> <b>funds</b> – their ability to transact at a stable share price – and thereby reduce their attractiveness to investors seeking cash management options outside the banking system. This thesis detaches from those discussions originally enquiring on how should <b>money</b> <b>market</b> <b>funds</b> be regulated in the US and in the EU. As a theoretical premise, this research identifies two overarching goals for <b>money</b> <b>market</b> <b>funds</b> regulation, namely, investor protection and systemic stability. The prevalent proposals for regulation are thus seen as misguided because the change in <b>money</b> <b>market</b> <b>funds</b> pricing mechanisms and the accounting convention would demonstrably not satisfy these goals. In order to formulate the new propositions for the regulation of <b>money</b> <b>market</b> <b>funds</b> in the US and the EU, therefore, this thesis first critically evaluates the existing US and EU regulatory frameworks applicable to <b>money</b> <b>market</b> <b>funds</b> from the standpoint of the dual policy goal of investor protection and systemic stability. Secondly, it introduces an alternative path for achieving this dual goal. It is argued that the blueprint of the international <b>money</b> <b>market</b> <b>fund</b> regulation ought to focus on full disclosure of the funds’ assets and liabilities – portfolio holdings and fund investors – as the primary measure of investor protection. Such disclosure also addresses systemic stability concerns by empowering regulators to properly monitor the transmission channels of funding risk. While my study does not purport to do away with risk limiting rules for <b>money</b> <b>market</b> <b>funds,</b> it cautions against copying the US-centric view of the investment standards to the much shallower European markets under the banners of harmonisation. Instead, this thesis advocates a harmonised international approach to the transparency of <b>money</b> <b>market</b> <b>fund</b> activities and the creation of a global database of market 5 exposures that would subject asset managers to public scrutiny and enable regulators to monitor the major risk transmitting channels. By these means the dual regulatory goal in <b>money</b> <b>market</b> <b>fund</b> regulation – investor protection and systemic stability – shall be upheld...|$|R

30|$|An {{outstanding}} {{example of}} how institutional factors {{can lead to the}} emergence of financial innovations is <b>money</b> <b>market</b> <b>funds</b> (Wall, 2014). In 1933 and 1935, banking acts were passed in the United States that gave the Federal Reserve the freedom to ceil interest rates paid by commercial banks on savings and time deposits. This regulation is famously known as Regulation Q. This regulation created an institutional barrier for investors (mostly small investors) who sought interest payment on their deposits. To overcome this regulatory constraint, Bruce R. Bent and Henry B. R. Brown created an alternative in 1971 called a <b>money</b> <b>market</b> <b>fund.</b> The fund was named the Reserve Fund, and it offered services to investors who wanted to secure a modest rate of return on their cash and earnings. <b>Money</b> <b>market</b> <b>funds</b> invested in low-risk securities that paid interest rates in line with market rates, such as certificates of deposit. As Regulation Q ceilings continued to fall behind market rates in the late 1970 s, investments in <b>money</b> <b>market</b> <b>funds</b> grew rapidly, and many more funds were created (Fink, 2011).|$|R
40|$|The {{announcement}} by the Reserve Primary Fund, in September 2008, {{that it was}} “breaking the buck,” triggered a widespread withdrawal of assets from other <b>money</b> <b>market</b> <b>funds</b> and led the U. S. Government to adopt emergency measures to maintain {{the stability of the}} short term credit markets. In light of these events, the SEC heightened the regulatory requirements to which <b>money</b> <b>market</b> <b>funds</b> – a three trillion dollar industry [...] are subject. Regulators and commentators continue to press for further regulatory change, however. The most controversial reform proposal would eliminate the ability of <b>money</b> <b>market</b> <b>funds</b> to purchase and sell shares at a stable $ 1 /share price. This article argues that the debate over a floating NAV is misguided. First, under current law, <b>money</b> <b>market</b> <b>funds</b> can maintain a $ 1 share price only under limited conditions. Second, a floating NAV would not achieve the goals claimed by its proponents. Third, and most important, a stable share price is critical to the existence of the <b>money</b> <b>market</b> <b>funds</b> industry. A required floating NAV would eliminate the fundamental attraction of <b>money</b> <b>market</b> <b>funds</b> for investors and, as a result, jeopardize the availability of short term capital. The more important regulatory question, on which existing commentary has not focused, is what happens if an MMF breaks the buck. This article takes the position that this event should neither require the fund to be liquidated nor permit the board unfettered discretion in suspending redemptions. Instead the article proposes two procedural reforms designed to provide flexibility and predictability in these circumstances by allowing a <b>money</b> <b>market</b> <b>fund</b> to convert to a floating NAV and allowing investors to redeem most of their shares without awaiting completion of a fund’s liquidation. In conjunction with a modest amendment requiring improved fund disclosure about the circumstances under which a fund may be unable to maintain a stable share price, these changes will increase liquidity, address the pressures that may lead to a “run,” preserve the economic viability of <b>money</b> <b>market</b> <b>funds,</b> and allow them to respond to the preferences of investors...|$|R
