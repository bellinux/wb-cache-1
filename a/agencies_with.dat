5|$|The National Register of Electors is updated {{to reflect}} various {{changes in the}} Canadian population, {{including}} address changes, reaching voting age, naturalisation, and death. Every year, about 3,000,000 address changes are processed by Elections Canada from information obtained from the Canada Revenue Agency, Canada Post, provincial and territorial motor vehicle registrars, and provincial electoral <b>agencies</b> <b>with</b> permanent voters lists.

Additionally, 120,000 individuals a year become naturalised Canadians, and {{are added to the}} National Register of Electors by Elections Canada based on information obtained from Citizenship and Immigration Canada. Collectively, these represent about 20% of the entries in the National Register of Electors.|$|E
