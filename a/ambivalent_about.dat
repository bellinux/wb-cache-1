5|$|Chinese and North Vietnamese {{documents}} {{state that}} relations between them worsened in 1973–75. A Vietnamese document claimed that China hindered the eventual reunification, while Chinese documents {{claimed that the}} source of the conflict was Vietnamese policy towards the Spratly and the Paracel Islands. However, the core issue for the Chinese was to minimize Vietnam's cooperation with the Soviets. Increasing Soviet/Vietnamese cooperation left China <b>ambivalent</b> <b>about</b> reunification.|$|E
5|$|Friedrich Schleiermacher, an {{influential}} nineteenth-century Reformed theologian, saw baptism {{as the way}} the church receives new members and taught that faith is a precondition for baptism. He was <b>ambivalent</b> <b>about</b> the practice of infant baptism, teaching {{that it was not}} an essential institution, but could be continued as long as the church was faithful in bringing children to confirmation. Schleiermacher also saw baptism as primarily individual rather than initiating one into a covenant community, and rejected the idea that baptism should be connected with Old Testament circumcision.|$|E
5|$|Regarding the {{continuation}} of Slipknot, Taylor told NME Gray would want them to continue and he felt they should but he was <b>ambivalent</b> <b>about</b> returning to the band. Slipknot returned to touring in 2011, performing {{a small number of}} shows in Europe with bassist Dennis Curlee. They headlined the Sonisphere Festival and Rock in Rio alongside Iron Maiden and Metallica, and performed at Belgium's Graspop Metal Meeting. Donnie Steele substituted for Gray in the concerts; he was positioned behind Jordison and obscured from the audience's view.|$|E
50|$|Due to the <b>ambivalent</b> {{language}} <b>about</b> homosexuality in Buddhist teachings, {{there has}} been no official stance put forth regarding the issue of marriage between members of the same gender.|$|R
500|$|... (1893–1933), {{but they}} were {{separated}} by his army service in World War I. She had <b>ambivalent</b> feelings <b>about</b> her Jewish heritage given the strong antisemitism of that era and joked that she married to escape her name.|$|R
25|$|President René Préval has {{expressed}} <b>ambivalent</b> feelings <b>about</b> the UN security presence, stating “if the Haitian people {{were asked if}} they wanted the UN forces to leave they would say yes.” Survivors frequently blame the UN peacekeepers for deaths of relatives.|$|R
5|$|Therese's boyfriend, Richard, {{wants her}} to go to France with him, hoping they will marry, but she is <b>ambivalent</b> <b>about</b> their relationship. A mutual friend, Dannie, invites Therese to his workplace, The New York Times, and offers to {{introduce}} her to a photo editor friend. Meanwhile, Carol is going through a difficult divorce from her neglectful husband, Harge. Carol calls Frankenberg's to thank the clerk who returned the gloves and invites Therese to lunch. Therese visits Dannie and he kisses her, but she becomes uncomfortable and leaves.|$|E
5|$|While <b>ambivalent</b> <b>about</b> much of The Five's music, Tchaikovsky {{remained}} on friendly terms {{with most of}} its members. In 1869, he and Balakirev worked together on what became Tchaikovsky's first recognized masterpiece, the fantasy-overture Romeo and Juliet, a work which The Five wholeheartedly embraced. The group also welcomed his Second Symphony, subtitled the Little Russian. Despite their support, Tchaikovsky made considerable efforts to ensure his musical independence from the group {{as well as from}} the conservative faction at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory.|$|E
5|$|However, in 2003 Michael Woodburne {{and colleagues}} revised the phylogenetic {{analysis}} published by Luo and colleagues, making several {{changes to the}} data, particularly in the monotremes. Their results (Figure 3, bottom) challenged the division between Australosphenida and Boreosphenida, as proposed by Luo et al. Instead, they excluded monotremes from Australosphenida and placed the remaining australosphenidans close to Eutheria, with Ambondro most closely related to Asfaltomylos. In 2007, Guillermo Rougier and colleagues described another australosphenidan, Henosferus, from the Jurassic of Argentina; they argued against a relationship between Eutheria and Australosphenida (Figure 3, top), but were <b>ambivalent</b> <b>about</b> the placement of monotremes within Australosphenida. Based in part on Martin and Rauhut's earlier work on wear facets in australosphenidans, they questioned {{the presence of a}} true functional protocone on the upper molars of non-monotreme australosphenidans—none of which are known from upper teeth—and consequently suggested that australosphenidans may not, after all, have had truly tribosphenic teeth.|$|E
50|$|In 1997, O'Connor made <b>ambivalent</b> {{comments}} <b>about</b> the AECL's {{proposal to}} store nuclear {{waste in the}} Canadian Shield. He argued that the plan was technologically possible, but was skeptical of {{whether it would be}} properly funded by the government (Winnipeg Free Press, 28 January 1997).|$|R

50|$|In 1917, she met {{and married}} a Wall Street stockbroker, Edwin Pond Parker II(1893-1933), but they were {{separated}} by his army service in World War I. She had <b>ambivalent</b> feelings <b>about</b> her Jewish heritage given the strong antisemitism of that era and joked that she married to escape her name.|$|R
5|$|The Great Depression {{provided}} a political opportunity for Hitler. Germans were <b>ambivalent</b> <b>about</b> the parliamentary republic, which faced challenges from right- and left-wing extremists. The moderate political parties were increasingly unable {{to stem the}} tide of extremism, and the German referendum of 1929 helped to elevate Nazi ideology. The elections of September 1930 resulted in the break-up of a grand coalition and its replacement with a minority cabinet. Its leader, chancellor Heinrich Brüning of the Centre Party, governed through emergency decrees from President Paul von Hindenburg. Governance by decree became the new norm and paved the way for authoritarian forms of government. The NSDAP rose from obscurity to win 18.3 percent of the vote and 107 parliamentary seats in the 1930 election, becoming the second-largest party in parliament.|$|E
5|$|In 1313–1314, Władysław conquered Greater Poland. In 1320, {{he became}} the first king of Poland crowned in Kraków's Wawel Cathedral instead of Gniezno. The {{coronation}} was hesitantly agreed to by Pope John XXII in spite of the opposition of King John of Bohemia, who had also claimed the Polish crown. John undertook an expedition aimed at Krakow in 1327, which he was compelled to abort; in 1328, he waged a crusade against Lithuania, during which he formalized an alliance with the Teutonic Order. The Order {{was in a state of}} war with Poland from 1327 to 1332 (see Battle of Płowce). As a result, the Knights captured Dobrzyń Land and Kujawy. Władysław was helped by his alliances with Hungary (his daughter Elizabeth was married to King Charles I in 1320) and Lithuania (in a pact of 1325 against the Teutonic State and the marriage of Władysław's son Casimir to Aldona, daughter of the Lithuanian ruler Gediminas). After 1329, a peace agreement with Brandenburg also assisted his efforts. A lasting achievement of King John of Bohemia (and a great loss to Poland) was his success in forcing most of the Piast Silesian principalities, often <b>ambivalent</b> <b>about</b> their loyalties, into allegiance between 1327 and 1329.|$|E
5|$|Tchaikovsky {{remained}} friendly {{but never}} intimate {{with most of}} The Five, <b>ambivalent</b> <b>about</b> their music; their goals and aesthetics did not match his. He took pains to ensure his musical independence from {{them as well as}} from the conservative faction at the Conservatory—an outcome facilitated by his acceptance of a professorship at the Moscow Conservatory offered to him by Nikolai Rubinstein, Anton's brother. When Rimsky-Korsakov was offered a professorship at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory, it was to Tchaikovsky that he turned for advice and guidance. Later, when Rimsky-Korsakov was under pressure from his fellow nationalists for his change in attitude on music education and his own intensive studies in music, Tchaikovsky continued to support him morally, told him that he fully applauded what he was doing and admired both his artistic modesty and his strength of character. In the 1880s, long after the members of The Five had gone their separate ways, another group called the Belyayev circle took up where they left off. Tchaikovsky enjoyed close relations with the leading members of this group—Alexander Glazunov, Anatoly Lyadov and, by then, Rimsky-Korsakov.|$|E
50|$|Mamah's {{apartment}} in Berlin, 1910. As Mamah translates some verses from German, {{she comes to}} terms with her strongly <b>ambivalent</b> feelings <b>about</b> her life with Wright, recognizing, despite her love for him, that her dream of an equal partnership with him is and will remain just that. Sullivan, in Chicago, echoes the sentiment.|$|R
5000|$|Her sole novel, Harley Radington: A Tale (1821), is, {{according}} to the critic Isobel Grundy [...] "a greater tour de force of imagination than her poems". In it [...] "she assumes {{the voice of a}} male protagonist-narrator, in whose story she has found a means of heightening and dramatising her own <b>ambivalent</b> feelings <b>about</b> being a Shetlander." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{first song}} that Crosby and Raymond co-wrote, [...] "Morrison", was {{performed}} {{live for the}} first time in January 1997. The song recalled Crosby's <b>ambivalent</b> feelings <b>about</b> the portrayal of Jim Morrison in Oliver Stone's The Doors (1991). The success of the band's initial 1997 tour spawned a studio album, CPR, which was released in March 1998.|$|R
25|$|Some Cherokee Freedmen {{descendants}} {{have continued}} to embrace this historical connection. Others, after having been excluded from the tribe for two decades {{in the late twentieth}} century and subject to a continuing citizenship struggle, have become <b>ambivalent</b> <b>about</b> their ties. They no longer think identifying as Cherokee is necessary to their personal identity.|$|E
25|$|Wounded by the {{criticism}} and <b>ambivalent</b> <b>about</b> the wide publicity she stirred up, Fern tried {{to reduce the}} autobiographical elements in her second novel, Rose Clark. But while it features a conventionally sweet and gentle heroine, a secondary character makes a poor marriage of convenience, an act which Fern had regretted in her own life.|$|E
25|$|To {{counter the}} Vichy regime, General Charles de Gaulle created the Free French Forces (FFL) after his Appeal of 18 June, 1940 radio speech. Initially, Winston Churchill was <b>ambivalent</b> <b>about</b> de Gaulle and he dropped ties with Vichy {{only when it}} became clear they would not fight the Germans. Even so, the Free France {{headquarters}} in London was riven with internal divisions and jealousies.|$|E
50|$|Indonesian {{physicians}} {{were initially}} not {{very interested in}} jamu. During the second conference of the Indonesian Association of Physicians, held in Solo in March 1940, two presentations on the topic were given. During the Japanese occupation, Indonesia's Jamu Committee was formed in 1944. During the following decades, the popularity of jamu increased, although physicians had rather <b>ambivalent</b> opinions <b>about</b> it.|$|R
50|$|Centuries of {{cultural}} influence from Tibet resulted in many Gurungs gradually embracing Tibetan Buddhism over the centuries, especially the Nyingma school, and particularly among Gurungs in the Manang region. Gurungs generally believe in Buddha and bodhisattvas. Mainstream Tibetan Buddhist lamas harbor <b>ambivalent</b> opinions <b>about</b> Gurung Dharma (Pye Ta Lu Ta) practices, and syncretic Gurung Dharma {{may be reluctant}} to disclose their practices to outsiders.|$|R
50|$|Publishers Weekly (June 28, 2010) {{wrote about}} Miłoszewski's novel Entanglement {{and gave it}} a starred review: Miloszewski takes an {{engaging}} look at modern Polish society in this stellar first in a new series starring Warsaw prosecutor Teodor Szacki. (...) Szacki, who's undergoing a midlife crisis and has <b>ambivalent</b> feelings <b>about</b> his wife, considers an affair with journalist hoping to get exclusive details on his inquiry. Readers will want {{to see more of the}} complex, sympathetic Szacki.|$|R
25|$|Unions have {{recently}} been engaged in a developing field of transnational labor regulation embodied in corporate codes of conduct. However, O'Brien cautions that unions have been only peripherally involved in this process, and remain <b>ambivalent</b> <b>about</b> its potential effects. They worry that these codes could have legitimizing effects on companies that do not actually live up to good practices, and that companies could use codes to excuse or distract attention from the repression of unions.|$|E
25|$|The {{music of}} Autechre has {{exhibited}} a gradual shift in aesthetic throughout their career, from their earlier work with clear roots in techno, electro, and hip hop to later albums {{that are often}} considered experimental in nature, featuring complex patterns of rhythm and subdued melodies. While heavily associated with the 1990s electronic genre later known as intelligent dance music (IDM), Booth and Brown are <b>ambivalent</b> <b>about</b> relating their sound to established genres.|$|E
25|$|Former United States Congressman Ron Paul {{and former}} United States Senator Barry Goldwater popularized libertarian {{economics}} and anti-statist rhetoric in the United States and passed some reforms. United States President Ronald Reagan tried {{to appeal to}} them in a speech, though many libertarians are <b>ambivalent</b> <b>about</b> Reagan's legacy. Since 2012, former New Mexico governor Gary Johnson has been seen as {{one of the leaders of}} the libertarian movement in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|De Gaulle {{personally}} had <b>ambivalent</b> feelings <b>about</b> Britain, {{possibly in}} part because of childhood memories of the Fashoda Incident. As an adult he spoke German much better than he spoke English; he had thought little of the British Army’s contribution to the First World War, and even less of that of 1939-40, and in the 1930s he had been a reader of the journal Action Française which blamed Britain for German foreign policy gains at France’s expense. De Gaulle explained his position: ...|$|R
5000|$|Kincaid is {{introduced}} in the episode [...] "Sweeps" [...] as an Assistant District Attorney in the Manhattan DA's office. She is portrayed as an idealistic, outspoken feminist and agnostic who becomes increasingly disillusioned with her job. She is vocally pro-choice, opposes the death penalty, and has <b>ambivalent</b> feelings <b>about</b> drug prohibition. These political views often come into conflict {{with the realities of}} the legal system. She graduated from Harvard Law School, where her stepfather Mac Geller (played by Len Cariou) had been one of her professors.|$|R
50|$|Her work {{impressed}} Corman {{enough to}} give her her first full directing job on It's a Bikini World (shot in 1965 but not released until 1967), which he financed. However she did not enjoy the experience:I became very depressed after making It's a Bikini World. I had very <b>ambivalent</b> feelings <b>about</b> continuing to be a director if that was all I {{was going to be}} able to do. So I literally went into a kind of retirement for several years until more than anything in the world, I wanted to make films.|$|R
25|$|He was <b>ambivalent</b> <b>about</b> {{requiring}} written {{opinions of}} arbitrators. While generally opposing {{them on the}} grounds that they would slow the process down, since the losing party would in many instances simply use it as the starting point for an appeal, he allowed that arbitrators should at least have to put it in writing if they were making their decision on one aspect of the case. The SEC ultimately agreed and declined to order written opinions of arbitrators.|$|E
25|$|England {{probably}} became <b>ambivalent</b> <b>about</b> {{this sort}} of piratical collaboration as it attacked Algiers in 1621 in order to free Christian captives there. In 1629, Louis XIII attacked Salé to free 420 French captives. Louis XIV also later bombarded Algiers in retaliation. Catholic religious orders, especially the Trinitarians and the Lazarists under Saint Vincent de Paul, himself a former slave, accumulated donations to ransom and liberate Christian slaves. It is estimated that the missionaries liberated 1,200 slaves until the death of Saint Vincent de Paul in 1660, {{for a total of}} 1,200,000 livres.|$|E
25|$|Historian Rita Heller, who {{conducted}} {{a survey of the}} students in 1982, found that while some of the respondents were <b>ambivalent</b> <b>about</b> the program's usefulness, most credited it with improving their self-image and social skills and believed the school had helped them advance in their careers. Many went on to take leadership positions in their communities, churches, and trade unions. Elizabeth Nord became chairman of the New England Silk and Rayon Workers Union; Carmen Lucia became vice president of the United Hatters, Cap and Millinery Workers International Union; and Rose Finkelstein Norwood led the Boston chapter of the Women's Trade Union League.|$|E
50|$|On December 1908, Juan Vicente Gómez {{came into}} power with a coup d'état against the {{government}} of Cipriano Castro. Gómez stayed in power {{until his death in}} 1935, and during this time the Dictator, having <b>ambivalent</b> feelings <b>about</b> the purpose of educating free minds when he could hire foreigners to exercise any technical requirements for the nation, decided to close the university from 1912 to 1922. When it reopened, the Rector Felipe Guevara Rojas had reorganized the traditional division of only a few schools and separated them into departments.|$|R
50|$|Richard Clarke Cabot and Ella Lyman Cabot {{were both}} {{prolific}} letter-writers. Their lifelong correspondence, {{from the beginning}} of their courtship in 1888 through the year of Cabot's death, documents her <b>ambivalent</b> feelings <b>about</b> leaving her own family to accept Richard's proposal of marriage, and their initial disagreement about having children. The letters also clearly show their nearly fifty years of shared religious and philosophical inspiration, and their emotional reliance upon each other. During the last 15 years of Cabot's life the correspondence consists largely of birthday and Christmas letters.|$|R
500|$|Olds {{developed}} <b>ambivalent</b> feelings <b>about</b> West Point, admiring its {{dedication to}} [...] "Duty, Honor, Country", but {{disturbed by the}} tendency of many tactical officers to distort the purpose of its Honor Code. In March 1943, Olds was braced by an officer upon returning from leave in New York City, and compelled on penalty of an honor violation to admit he had consumed alcohol. The infraction reduced him in rank from cadet captain to cadet private, characterized by Olds in his memoirs as [...] "only the second cadet {{in the history of}} West Point to earn that dubious honor." ...|$|R
