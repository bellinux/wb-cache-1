30|$|The {{ligament}} entheseal <b>attachment</b> <b>angle</b> {{was significantly}} larger in the posterior {{rather than the}} anterior sections. This angle difference {{may be attributed to}} differences in entheseal profile between anterior and posterior sections since the most convex and concave profiles were found in the anterior and posterior sections, respectively. To our knowledge, the entheseal <b>attachment</b> <b>angle</b> and its regional differences have not been reported before. According to the simplified finite element model of the pubovisceral muscle enthesis, the entheseal <b>attachment</b> <b>angle</b> is inversely related to the strain concentration magnitude in the inferior margin (Kim et al. 2011). This suggests that, within the inferior margin of the femoral enthesis, the anterior region may experience a greater strain concentration than the posterior region, at least in the knee position examined herein (15  ° of knee flexion). This may partly explain the greater amount of fibrocartilage in the antero-inferior region than in the postero-inferior region. Conversely, the greater <b>attachment</b> <b>angle</b> in the posterior enthesis section is, in part, caused by the concave surface profile there; this may be an architectural mechanism to reduce the entheseal strain concentration in that region. This systematic variation in the angular orientation of the fibers forming the ACL femoral enthesis should be taken into consideration as new ACL reconstruction approaches are explored and developed. Although the location of the femoral tunnel has been investigated extensively (Xu et al. 2016), its direction has not, to our knowledge. This is an important factor to consider because the direction of the tunnel influences the angle of insertion of the collagen fibers in the graft. It remains to be determined, therefore, whether selecting a femoral tunnel direction that maximizes the <b>attachment</b> <b>angle</b> should be recommended given that acute angles present with strain concentrations of greater magnitudes (Kim et al. 2011).|$|R

40|$|The femoral {{enthesis}} of {{the human}} anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) {{is known to be}} more susceptible to injury than the tibial enthesis. To determine whether anatomic differences might help explain this difference, we quantified the microscopic appearance of both entheses in 15 unembalmed knee specimens using light microscopy, toluidine blue stain and image analysis. The amount of calcified fibrocartilage and uncalcified fibrocartilage, and the ligament entheseal <b>attachment</b> <b>angle</b> were then compared between the femoral and tibial entheses via linear mixed‐effects models. The results showed marked differences in anatomy between the two entheses. The femoral enthesis exhibited a 3. 9 ‐fold more acute ligament <b>attachment</b> <b>angle</b> than the tibial enthesis (p[*]<[*] 0. 001), a 43 % greater calcified fibrocartilage tissue area (p[*]<[*] 0. 001), and a 226 % greater uncalcified fibrocartilage depth (p[*]<[*] 0. 001), with the latter differences being particularly pronounced in the central region.

30|$|Aside from {{differences}} between angiosperms and gymnosperms or {{the timing of}} leaf senescence for different species, tree size and its influence of branch morphology mostly superseded the effect of species.

We observed many weakly attached branches on Liberty elms, which is consistent with the smaller mean <b>attachment</b> <b>angles</b> measured on that species, as well as the number of defective branches that did not fail. <b>Attachment</b> <b>angle</b> may affect snow accumulation, and can also be associated with the presence of included bark, which we recorded as a defect and reduces the strength of branch attachments (Smiley 2003). MOR also differs among species (Kretschmann 2010), but the lack of correlation between MOR and the probability of failure was not surprising considering that failure depends on both applied stress and MOR: stronger wood only reduces the likelihood of failure if the snow-induced bending stress is similar between two branches.|$|R

In this study, a novel MRI based modelling approach {{was applied to the}} first dorsal introsseus muscle (FDI), to determine whether the 10 % rule may be applied to the FDI and may be partially explained by the arrangement of the anatomical components of the FDI. Methods Initially the force generated by the thumb segment during an isometric pushing task in the horizontal plane was measured from 25 strongly right-handed young males. Nine of these participants then had structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) of the thumb and index osseous compartment. A modelling technique was developed to extract the muscle data and quantify the muscle line of action onto to the first metacarpal bone segment in order to quantify the muscle force at the point of momentary rotation – equilibrium. Results Eight of 25 subjects exhibited stronger force from the left hand. Six out of nine subjects from the MRI possessed significantly greater <b>angles</b> of <b>attachment</b> of the index osseous compartment on the left (non-dominant) hand. These six subjects also generated greater maximal isometric forces from the FDI of the left side. There was a significantly greater muscle volume for the right FDI muscle as compared to the left as measured from the reconstructed MRI slice data. Conclusions The calculated force produced by the muscle is related to the <b>angle</b> of <b>attachment</b> of the muscle to bone in the index osseous compartment.

30|$|Recent {{advances}} {{in the development of}} animal-borne accelerometers (data loggers) make it possible for researchers to monitor pitch angle of aquatic animals in situ by attaching an acceleration sensor (accelerometer) along the longitudinal axis of the body. When a data logger is positioned exactly parallel to the longitudinal axis of an animal, the calculated angle of the data logger {{is the same as the}} pitch angle of the animal. Nonetheless, it is impossible to align the logger exactly parallel to the longitudinal axis of an animal in field studies. A few methods have been previously described to account for the discrepancy between the pitch angle of data loggers and the longitudinal axis in field studies. In one instance, Watanuki et al. [4] designated the <b>attachment</b> <b>angle</b> to the lower back of seabirds as 0 ° when they were at the water surface, a time in which they were essentially horizontal before release. This methodology is well suited for birds that can be maintained in a horizontal position at the water surface. However, for animals that have a flexible body, it is difficult to keep them positioned horizontally for an extended period of time. In addition, this methodology cannot be applied for obligate swimming fish because of fatal risk for lack of adequate gill ventilation. Another approach to account for the discrepancy between the pitch angle of data loggers and the longitudinal axis was reported by Sato et al. [5] in Weddell seal. In this study, the <b>attachment</b> <b>angle</b> was calculated by using the data logger along with the speed sensor. Sato et al. [5] used the data logger (UWE 1000 -PD 2 GT: 22 [*]mm diameter, 124 [*]mm length; 80 [*]g in air; Little Leonardo Co., Tokyo, Japan) which contains a propeller and reported that the <b>attachment</b> <b>angle</b> for a specific dive of Weddell seal could be determined using equations including the number of propeller rotations, surging acceleration (m/s 2), the acceleration of gravity (9.8 [*]m/s 2), and body angle (degrees). This methodology can only be applied for large animals due to the relatively large size of data loggers that have a propeller. Furthermore, this method is only applicable for diving animals that must come to the surface to breathe. Lastly, in a third study, the <b>attachment</b> <b>angle</b> in flatfish was assigned as 0 ° when they lay on the substrate as reported by Kawabe et al. [6]. This method is only applicable for benthic animals that remain on the bottom. There are currently no reported methods to apply for continuous swimming fish.|$|R
30|$|For each {{digital image}} of the tissue sections, the {{relative}} area of CF, depth of UF, and ligament entheseal <b>attachment</b> <b>angle</b> were measured. CF relative area was quantified by outlining the CF tissue with a digital pen display (Cintiq 24 HD w/ grip pen, Wacom, Kazo, Saitama, Japan) and dividing its area by {{the length of the}} enthesis. This enthesis length was defined as the length of the profile of the tidemark. Using the same tools, UF depth was measured at 500 -μm intervals across the entire enthesis. Average depth, and not relative area, was selected as the method of choice for UF quantification for two reasons: first, the interface between this tissue and the adjacent distal tissue—dense fibrous connective tissue—is more ambiguous than between the CF and bone; and second, sampling UF depth at a constant interval is an established method (Beaulieu et al. 2015 a; Evans et al. 1990). Lastly, the ligament entheseal <b>attachment</b> <b>angle</b> was quantified as the angle between a line parallel to the fibers of the ligament and a line of best fit (first order polynomial) to the profile of the digitized interface between the entheseal calcified and uncalcified tissue, also known as the “tidemark”. All measurements were made in ImageJ (Schneider et al. 2012). The average CF relative area and UF depth were calculated for four regions of interest of the femoral enthesis (Fig.  1): (1) antero-superior; (2) antero-inferior; (3) postero-superior; and (4) postero-inferior. Anatomically, regions 1 – 2 correspond to the origin of the anteromedial (AM) fibers, while regions 3 – 4 correspond to the origin of the PL fibers. These four regions were selected to allow for comparisons between the AM and PL fibers of the ACL, as well as between the superior and inferior margins.

40|$|AbstractPreviously, Battelle has {{investigated}} the behaviour {{of a series}} of related multi-axial weld fatigue situations and developed effective analysis procedures. The first was a flange-to-tube joint under torsional-dominant loading. The second was a multi-axial stress state under uniaxial loading consisting of a tensile-loaded plate with either a fillet welded pipe or <b>angled</b> <b>attachment.</b> For multi-axial fatigue evaluation, an effective equivalent structural stress range (ΔEESS), defined as a combination of the equivalent normal structural stress range and the equivalent in-plane shear structural stress range in a von Mises form, derived from the Battelle structural stress method (BSSM), was formulated and used to clearly illustrate the differences in the behaviour of these two situations. As an extension of these multi-axial fatigue situations, the BSSM for fatigue life evaluation is examined herein for bi-axial loading of welded plate joints that otherwise require special treatment. However, when the BSSM is applied to bi-axially loaded plate joints, the failure location can be predicted correctly, and fatigue life predictions using the master S-N curve approach are very accurate compared with fatigue test results from the literature. This is because the BSSM captures the bi-axial loading effects, including the ratio of the load magnitudes and their phase difference that define the local variations of ΔEESS within the joint and thus define the failure location of the joint. In this investigation, {{it was found that the}} failure locations are influenced by the maximum normal structural stress (normal to weld line) not by the in-plane shear structural stress (parallel to weld line) which becomes negligible. In addition, it was also found that the cycles-to-failure data from the subject joint types were comparable with the master S-N curve for Mode I loading dominant behavior (inverse slope of 3. 125). Therefore, the master S-N curve that was developed for Mode I failures can be equally applicable for fatigue life predictions for these plate joints under bi-axial loading...|$|R

To generate locomotor thrust, labrids employ the paired pectoral fins in motions that range from a fore-aft rowing stroke to a dorso-ventral flapping stroke. Species that emphasize {{one or the other}} behavior are expected to benefit from alternative fin shapes that maximize performance of their primary swimming behavior. We document the diversity of pectoral fin shape in 143 species of labrids from the Great Barrier Reef and the Caribbean. Pectoral fin aspect ratio ranged among species from 1. 12 to 4. 48 and showed a distribution with two peaks at about 2. 0 and 3. 0. Higher aspect ratio fins typically had a relatively long leading edge and were narrower distally. Body mass only explained 3 % of the variation in fin aspect ratio in spite of four orders of magnitude range and an expectation that the advantages of high aspect ratio fins and flapping motion are greatest at large body sizes. Aspect ratio was correlated with the <b>angle</b> of <b>attachment</b> of the fin on the body (r = 0. 65), indicating that the orientation of the pectoral girdle is rotated in high aspect ratio species to enable them to move their fin in a flapping motion. Field measures of routine swimming speed were made in 43 species from the Great Barrier Reef. Multiple regression revealed that fin aspect ratio explained 52 % of the variation in size-corrected swimming speed, but the <b>angle</b> of <b>attachment</b> of the pectoral fin only explained an additional 2 %. Labrid locomotor diversity appears to be related to a trade-off between efficiency of fast swimming and maneuverability in slow swimming species.

40|$|Grafting the {{circumflex}} {{coronary artery}} {{has been more}} difficult technically than the right or anterior descending because of its posterior location and the angles of its marginal branches. However, grafting this artery has been substantially simplified by a method wherein the graft is passed directly through the transverse sinus and anastomosed {{to the back of}} the ascending aorta. This follows the most direct course to the ascending aorta and the graft is much shorter than one brought anterior to the heart. There is little chance of kinking the graft, since its <b>angle</b> of <b>attachment</b> is ideal, and due to the anatomical configuration of the transverse sinus, there is more room for the graft and compression is unlikely. This allows more room on the anterior surface of the aorta for grafts to other coronary arteries. This method has been used in 50 cases and blood flows have been excellent. Twelve of these cases have been restudied postoperatively and the grafts are patent...|$|R
