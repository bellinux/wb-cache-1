She also meets an attractive young writer, Christian Thompson, who offers to help her with her career.

5|$|Clara {{explored}} eastern religions for a {{few years}} and then eventually became a Christian Scientist, although there is some question as to her seriousness <b>and</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> it. She authored a book on the subject: Awake to a Perfect Day, published by Citadel Press, NYC, 1956 After originally objecting to the release of her father's Letters from the Earth in 1939, she changed her stance shortly before her death in 1962 and allowed them to be published. She also published biographies of both her father (My Father, Mark Twain in 1931) and of her first husband (My Husband: Gabrilowitsch in 1938).|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} season, {{the format of}} the show changed drastically. The maximum age dropped from 31 to 28. The cast of season two were given {{mandatory}} non-profit jobs to help them build a work ethic and to experience the stabilizing effect of being interdependent with others, for example in teamwork <b>and</b> <b>commitment,</b> <b>to</b> equip them for success in later life. Quitting the job or failure to attend resulted in mandatory removal from the show. The girls were given the jobs of planning, decision making, and building cooperation.

The NSF denied the appeal, explaining that the superior enthusiasm for <b>and</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> the project demonstrated by Florida State led to the decision to relocate the lab.|$|E
5|$|Wail and Waleed al-Shehri {{disappeared}} {{after going}} to Medina, calling their father just once; in the conversation, the brothers were vague {{about when they}} would return.

Before disappearing, the Shehri brothers went to Al-Seqley Mosque {{to swear an oath}} <b>and</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> jihad, as did Ahmed al-Nami and Saeed al-Ghamdi. Wail presided over the ceremony, dubbing himself Abu Mossaeb al-Janubi after one of Muhammad's companions.|$|E
5|$|Educated at {{home until}} she was seven, Bishop then went to a private {{elementary}} school {{until the age of}} nine. In 1909, then ten years old, she entered the progressive Fielden School in her hometown of Manchester, where she studied for three years. She completed her high school education at the Manchester High School for Girls. Though Bishop intended to study chemistry, her lack of education in physics meant that she could not pursue her preferred course in the Honours School of Chemistry. Instead, she matriculated at Manchester University in October 1918 to study botany, chemistry, and zoology. That first-year course in zoology sparked her lifelong interest in <b>and</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> the field. She graduated with honours from the School of Zoology, receiving her Bachelor of Science degree in 1921; she received her master's degree in 1922. During her undergraduate years, under the tutelage of the helminthologist R.A. Wardle and the protozoologist Geoffrey Lapage, Bishop studied ciliates acquired from local ponds.|$|E

5|$|Zemeckis and Gale {{wrote the}} script after Gale mused upon {{whether he would}} have befriended his father if they had {{attended}} school together. Various film studios rejected the script until the financial success of Zemeckis' Romancing the Stone. Zemeckis approached Steven Spielberg, who agreed to produce the project at Amblin Entertainment, with Universal Pictures as distributor. The first choice {{for the role of}} Marty McFly was Michael J. Fox. However, he was busy filming his television series Family Ties and the show's producers would not allow him to star in the film. Consequently, Eric Stoltz was cast in the role. During filming, Stoltz and the filmmakers decided that the role was miscast, and Fox was again approached for the part. Now with more flexibility in his schedule and the blessing of his show's producers, Fox managed to work out a timetable in which he could give enough time <b>and</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> both.|$|E
5|$|Goebbels {{first took}} an {{interest}} in Adolf Hitler and Nazism in 1924. In February 1924, Hitler's trial for treason began {{in the wake of his}} failed attempt to seize power in the Beer Hall Putsch of November 8–9, 1923. The trial attracted widespread press coverage and gave Hitler a platform for propaganda. Hitler was sentenced to five years prison, but was released on 20 December 1924, after serving just over a year. Goebbels was drawn to the NSDAP mostly because of Hitler's charisma <b>and</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> his beliefs. He joined the NSDAP around this time, becoming member number 8762. In late 1924, Goebbels offered his services to Karl Kaufmann, who was Gauleiter (NSDAP district leader) for the Rhine-Ruhr District. Kaufmann put him in touch with Gregor Strasser, a leading Nazi organizer in northern Germany, who hired him to work on their weekly newspaper and to do secretarial work for the regional party offices. He was also put to work as party speaker and representative for Rhineland-Westphalia. Members of Strasser's northern branch of the NSDAP, including Goebbels, had a more socialist outlook than the rival Hitler group in Munich. Strasser disagreed with Hitler on many parts of the party platform, and in November 1926 began working on a revision.|$|E
