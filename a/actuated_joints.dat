40|$|The paper {{addresses}} the geometric synthesis of Orthoglide-type mechanism, {{a family of}} 3 -DOF parallel manipulators for rapid machining applications, which combine advantages of both serial mechanisms and parallel kinematic architectures. These manipulators possess quasi-isotropic kinematic performances and {{are made up of}} three <b>actuated</b> fixed prismatic <b>joints,</b> which are mutually orthogonal and connected to a mobile platform via three parallelogram chains. The platform moves in the Cartesian space with fixed orientation, similar to conventional XYZ-machine. Three strategies have been proposed to define the Orthoglide geometric parameters (manipulator link lengths and <b>actuated</b> <b>joint</b> limits) as functions of a cubic workspace size and dextrous properties expressed by bounds on the velocity transmission factors, manipulability or the Jacobian condition number. Low inertia and intrinsic stiffness have been set as additional design goals expressed by the minimal link length requirement. For each design strategy, analytical expressions for computing the Orthoglide parameters are proposed. It is showed that the proposed strategies yield Pareto-optimal solutions, which differ by the kinematic performances outside the prescribed Cartesian cube (but within the workspace bounded by the <b>actuated</b> <b>joint</b> limits). The proposed technique is illustrated with numerical examples for the Orthoglide prototype design...|$|R

In particular, fish are able to exploit wakes that are generated by objects in flowing water. A powerful demonstration that this {{is largely due to}} passive body properties are studies on dead trout. Inspired by that, we developed a multi-joint swimming platform that explores the potential of a passive dynamic mechanism. The platform has one <b>actuated</b> <b>joint</b> only, followed by three passive joints whose stiffness can be changed online, individually, and can be set to an almost arbitrary nonlinear stiffness profile. In a set of experiments, using online optimization, we investigated how the platform can discover optimal stiffness distribution along its body in response to different frequency and amplitude of actuation. We show that a heterogeneous stiffness distribution - each joint having a different value - outperforms a homogeneous one in producing thrust. Furthermore, different gaits emerged in different settings of the <b>actuated</b> <b>joint.</b> This work illustrates the potential of online adaption of passive body properties, leading to optimized swimming, especially in an unsteady environment...|$|R

40|$|Optimization {{and control}} of {{stiffness}} for parallel kinematic mechanisms (PKM) are critical issues because stiffness {{is directly related to}} the precision and response characteristics of the end-effector of PKMs. Unlike nonredundant PKMs, redundant PKMs have additional actuators exceeding their essential degrees-of-freedom (DOF), resulting in an increase in the redundancy of control. The stiffness of redundant PKMs is divided into passive and active stiffness. Active stiffness is changeable even in cases of fixed kinematic parameters and end-effector posture. However, it is not easy and intuitive to control the active stiffness of redundant PKMs for the complexity of Hessian matrix operations. This paper describes a new decoupling method for explicit stiffness analysis of redundant PKM with the well-known two-DOF and one-redundant planar five-bar PKM. Three <b>actuating</b> <b>joints</b> are decoupled to three groups containing two <b>actuating</b> <b>joints.</b> With this mathematical configuration, the stiffness matrix for one-redundant actuation is also divided into three stiffness matrices for nonredundant actuation, and the contribution of each actuator can be intuitively investigated. Stiffness matrices for the original and decoupled cases are compared in detail. In particular, this decoupling method is applicable to redundant PKMs with many passive joints. Finding optimal joints for one- or two-redundant actuation with various candidates is more intuitive with this decoupling method...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{addresses}} motion {{generation of}} a basic gymnastic maneuver on the horizontal bar, {{referred to as}} the kip motion, as a difficult goal-directed movement under a nonholonomic constraint. First, we show the results of the motion measurement of the kip movements performed by two expert gymnasts, where the movements of each subject are very similar among trials. Second, we attempt to elucidate whether the kip motion of the expert gymnasts can be understood by the criteria proposed for explaining the hand reaching movements or not. To this end, the body of the expert gymnasts is modeled as a rigid 3 -link with an unactuated joint at the hand and <b>actuated</b> <b>joints</b> at the shoulder and the hip, where the angle profiles of the <b>actuated</b> <b>joints</b> are approximated by fifth spline functions. Moreover, it is confirmed that the model’s motion is approximately consistent with the measured motion. By using the above model, the kip movements are generated with the minimum torque change criterion [2][3] explaining the hand reaching movements, and motion segmentation assuming the initial, via- and final postures. The results of the numerical analysis suggest that the measured movements of the expert gymnasts could be almost reproduced in this way. Thus, it is suggested that motion determination/generation of the hand reaching and kip movements could be understood by the common criterion...|$|E
