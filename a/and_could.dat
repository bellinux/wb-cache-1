5|$|Infantes (young children) and furiosi ("lunatics") were {{considered}} incapable of formulating the necessary intention <b>and</b> <b>could</b> therefore not commit furtum.|$|E
60|$|Then {{later the}} spring {{would come and}} all the plain was bright with flowers <b>and</b> Serge <b>could</b> pick them. Then the rain came <b>and</b> Serge <b>could</b> catch it in a cup. Then the summer came and the great heat and the storms, <b>and</b> Serge <b>could</b> watch the lightning.|$|R

5|$|A {{few years}} later, {{inspired}} by Madame de Genlis's Adèle et Théodore (1782), Trimmer commissioned sets of illustrations of the Bible {{for which she}} provided the commentary; she also published print/commentary sets of ancient history and British history. These various sets were very popular <b>and</b> <b>could</b> be purchased together (commentary and prints) or individually. The prints were usually hung on walls or bound into books.|$|E
5|$|A replica wooden bridge {{runs from}} the outer defences over the water to an island called a ravelin, which is in turn linked to the inner defences by another replica bridge, {{protected}} with two drawbridges. The ravelin formed a physical barrier to incoming artillery fire aimed {{at the entrance to}} the inner defences <b>and</b> <b>could</b> also have directed fire against enemy forces that breached the outer defensive line.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sure <b>and</b> I <b>could,</b> yer honour.

5000|$|The {{producers}} {{decided that}} only Amedeo, Chiara, Kiran, Martina <b>and</b> Vito <b>could</b> be nominated that week. Ilenia was the favourite housemate {{of the public}} <b>and</b> she <b>could</b> save one of the nominees. She saved Martina.|$|R
5|$|A small {{downhill}} {{ski area}} provided recreation for personnel and their dependents, {{operating on the}} base from the early 1960s until Loring's closure in 1994. This ski chalet also included a lighted skating rink <b>and</b> <b>could</b> be used to host events in the area. The base also offered trips to regional ski resorts periodically, and cross country skiing was offered at the local golf course.|$|E
5|$|Affeldt {{had three}} {{different}} kinds of pitches: a sinking fastball (which is rare for a lefty), a curveball, and a split. His fastball travelled in the low nineties, and while his curveball was not fast, it had late breaking action and {{got a lot of}} swing-throughs. Affeldt induced groundballs at a high rate with his sinking fastball <b>and</b> <b>could</b> also get the strikeout when the situation called for it.|$|E
5|$|Aircraft could undergo maintenance, {{and most}} {{functional}} and equipment tests carried out aboard - {{either in the}} hangar or on the deck. Some components <b>and</b> <b>could</b> be repaired on board, but other work was {{to be carried out}} by the workshops on the engine repair and component repair ships that would accompany the maintenance carrier.|$|E

5|$|Although Vainio {{himself did}} not consume alcohol, he was {{tolerant}} about others' alcohol use <b>and</b> <b>could</b> {{spend time with}} his friends even if they drank, keeping alcohol in his house in case his friends came over. He also began discussing the topic of drinking in his lyrics. Getting rid of his alcohol problem did not solve Vainio's domestic problems; he and Taina ended up divorcing.|$|E
5|$|Any {{extended}} ocean voyage without {{fresh water}} or food would prove {{difficult for a}} large, warm-blooded (homeothermic) mammal, but today many small, nocturnal species of lemur exhibit heterothermy, which allows them to lower their metabolism and become dormant while living off fat reserves. Such a trait in a small, nocturnal lemur ancestor would have facilitated the ocean voyage <b>and</b> <b>could</b> have been passed on to its descendants. However, this trait has not been observed in the closely related lorisoids studied to date, <b>and</b> <b>could</b> have evolved on Madagascar {{in response to the}} island's harsh environmental conditions.|$|E
5|$|At that time, many in Britain {{worried that}} coal {{reserves}} were rapidly dwindling, {{but some experts}} opined that improving technology would reduce coal consumption. Jevons argued that this view was incorrect, as further increases in efficiency would tend to increase the use of coal. Hence, improving technology would tend to increase {{the rate at which}} England's coal deposits were being depleted, <b>and</b> <b>could</b> not be relied upon to solve the problem.|$|E
50|$|The P.24A <b>and</b> P.24B models <b>could</b> carry 4 x 12.5 kg bombs, {{while the}} P.24C, F <b>and</b> G <b>could</b> carry 2 x 50 kg bombs.|$|R
5|$|Siege towers <b>and</b> ladders <b>could</b> {{be fitted}} with a long, narrow tilting beam at the top, gouged with a groove, so that hot oil <b>and</b> water <b>could</b> be poured down on the enemy {{defenders}} during an escalade.|$|R
5000|$|... 1989: In May 1989, Sequoia Data Corp. Introduced Compumarket The first {{internet}} based {{system for}} e-commerce. Sellers <b>and</b> buyers <b>could</b> post items for sale <b>and</b> buyers <b>could</b> search the database and make purchases {{with a credit}} card.|$|R
5|$|Block II {{had already}} been planned to use a {{completely}} redesigned hatch which opened outward, <b>and</b> <b>could</b> be opened {{in less than five}} seconds. Concerns of accidental opening were addressed by using a cartridge of pressurized nitrogen to drive the release mechanism in an emergency, instead of the explosive bolts used on Project Mercury.|$|E
5|$|But in the {{following}} seven months, Cairano records successive advances and balances for trophies in full production mode that does not affect his other works, whereas Tamagnino only realises two Caesars and seventeen leonine busts. The creation of leonine busts was considered repetitive <b>and</b> <b>could</b> be consigned to low calibre stonecutters, and Tamagnino was paid {{much less than the}} average payment received by Cairano for artefacts of the same type.|$|E
5|$|Casting {{the role}} of Dimitri gave All My Children difficulty. The series' casting director, Judy Blye Wilson, tested between fifteen and twenty actors, <b>and</b> <b>could</b> not find the right actor for the job. Wilson then learned that the former Dynasty star, Michael Nader was {{available}} and suggested the show offer him the part.|$|E
50|$|The {{registration}} {{rules were}} somewhat restrictive; for instance government employees <b>and</b> non-government employees <b>could</b> {{not belong to}} the same union or even to unions affiliated with each other, <b>and</b> union funds <b>could</b> not be used for political purposes. Under these rules the GLU's were un-registerable <b>and</b> therefore <b>could</b> not operate legally.|$|R
2500|$|One way {{in which}} {{language}} games could be organized is by language, for example, Pig Latin, Ubbi Dubbi, <b>and</b> Tutnese <b>could</b> all be in the [...] "English" [...] category, <b>and</b> Jeringonza <b>could</b> be in the [...] "Spanish" [...] category.|$|R
60|$|Well, Claus did {{not know}} how about that; perhaps he <b>could,</b> <b>and</b> perhaps he <b>could</b> not.|$|R
5|$|Communications usually {{consisted}} of FuG X, the later FuG 10 (Funkgerät), navigational direction finder PeilG V direction finder (PeilG - Peilgerät) and the FuG 25 IFF and FuBI 1 blind-landing devices. The crew communicated by EiV intercom. A primitive autopilot device, the Siemens K4Ü, was installed <b>and</b> <b>could</b> maintain bearing using the rudder's control surfaces.|$|E
5|$|Conditions on {{the other}} {{terrestrial}} planets, Mercury and Venus, appear to be too harsh to support {{life as we know}} it. But it has been conjectured that Europa, the fourth-largest moon of Jupiter, may possess a sub-surface ocean of liquid water <b>and</b> <b>could</b> potentially host life.|$|E
5|$|Contraceptive use in {{developing}} countries is estimated to have decreased the number of maternal deaths by 40% (about 270,000 deaths prevented in 2008) <b>and</b> <b>could</b> prevent 70% of deaths if the full demand for birth control were met. These benefits are achieved by {{reducing the number of}} unplanned pregnancies that subsequently result in unsafe abortions and by preventing pregnancies in those at high risk.|$|E

25|$|Re-design of cities, telecommuting, mass transit, higher {{housing density}} <b>and</b> walking <b>could</b> also reduce {{automobile}} fuel consumption. Carpooling, flexcars, Smart cars, <b>and</b> shorter commutes <b>could</b> all reduce fuel use.|$|R
