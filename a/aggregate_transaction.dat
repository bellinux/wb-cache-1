However, it is a product difficult to chart: "exporters" of tourism do not ship it abroad, but they welcome importers inside the country.

40|$|Abstract. barter is a scalable, highly-available and ecient {{electronic}} commerce system that facilitates digital content trade {{over an open}} net-work. barter is designed to operate over a large-scale, global and het-erogeneous communication network infrastructure. The barter proto-cols address two vital requirements from an {{electronic commerce}} system, neglected from existing systems: scalability and transactional eciency. barter suggests three basic protocols, oering dierent levels of trust in the system. barter’s novelty is twofold: First, by distributing signature verication away from barter servers, the overhead of online transaction processing is reduced by orders of magnitude. Nevertheless, this does not sacrice strong security requirements, namely the ability to <b>aggregate</b> <b>transaction</b> commitments and to resolve disputes. Second, barter integrates scalability considerations into several system components {{that are likely to}} suer service degradation in a world-wide setting. These components are the authentication subsystem, the ac-count management subsystem, and the maintenance of global data (such as transaction identier lists). In addressing these issues, barter takes into account the inherent asynchronous, unreliable, insecure and failure-prone environment assumptions. We contend that by employing service distribution, barter is expected to scale well, meeting the demands of a world-wide setting, over which it is intended to operate. ...|$|E

A number of design alternatives are presented, including a flat schema, a terraced schema, a star schema and a snowflake schema. We also define a new type of schema called a star cluster schema.

40|$|This paper explores {{institutional}} investor trades in stocks grouped by {{style and the}} relationship of these trades with equity market returns. It <b>aggregates</b> <b>transactions</b> drawn from a large universe of approximately $ 6 trillion of institutional funds. To analyze style behavior, we assign equities to deciles in each of five style dimensions: size, value/growth, cyclical/defensive, sector, and country. We find, first, strong evidence that investors organize and trade stocks across style-driven lines. This appears true for groupings both strongly and weakly related to fundamentals (e. g., industry or country groupings versus size or value/growth deciles). Second, the positive linkage between flows and returns emerges at daily frequencies, yet becomes even more important at lower frequencies. We show that quarterly decile flows and returns are even more strongly positively correlated than are daily flows and returns. However, as the horizon increases beyond a year, we find that the flow/return correlation declines. Third, style flows and returns are important components of individual stock expected returns. We find that nearby style inflows and returns positively forecast future returns while distant style inflows and returns forecast negatively. Fourth, we find strong correlations between style flows and temporary components of return. This suggests that behavioral theories {{may play a role in}} explaining the popularity and price impact of flow-related trading. ...|$|R
30|$|One {{limitation}} {{of previous studies}} is that they mainly addressed inter-firm relationships within a country, so they have little {{to say about the}} linkages of firms in different countries. Important exceptions include studies on global ownership structure [20], and global R&D partnerships [21]. However, no work has yet investigated the structure of global customer-supplier linkages, which is the key to understanding the nature of the above incidences (i.e., the global financial crisis and the disruption of global supply chains by natural disasters). Given this background, we investigate the global aspect of inter-firm linkages using a unique dataset that contains information on business relationships (both domestic and international) for about 400, 000 firms worldwide. This is the first contribution of this paper. Note that if one <b>aggregates</b> <b>transactions</b> (purchases and sales) at the firm level, one obtains transactions at the country level, called international trade by economists. The network structure of international trade has recently been studied by economists and physicists [22 – 28]. Our investigation of international transactions at the firm level is closely related to those studies, but our firm level data reveal that firms are more likely to transact with other firms in the same industry rather than other firms in the same home country, which is quite different from what is assumed in studies on international trade. We will expand this point below.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} a macroeconometric disequilibrium model for West Germany is {{presented}} and its quality for policy simulations and forecasting are analyzed using stochastic in-sample simulations. The model {{is built on}} a dynamic disequilibrium model of firms' behaviour. Due to delayed adjustment of production inputs, and sluggish adjustment of wages and prices, a market disequilibrium can arise on labour and goods micro markets. Aggregation leads to an explicit functional form for <b>aggregate</b> <b>transactions</b> on labour and goods markets dependent on aggregate supply, demand, and mismatch. The empirical application of the model confirms that underutilization of labour and capital are important phenomena. Shares of firms facing different constraints on the goods and labour market {{can be derived from}} the model. These proportions changed considerably during the last three decades. Some deterministic simulations of different shocks affecting the economy including fiscal and monetary shocks, and migratory movements showed a strong influence of the prevailing rationing regime on the outcomes. The robustness of these results is assessed using stochastic in-sample simulations for the period 1981 - 1988. Simulations using stochastic errors for the model's 23 estimated equations help to evaluate the effects of non-linearities and dynamic features on the forecasting quality of the model. Furthermore, a comparison between deterministic and different stochastic simulations allows the conclusion to be drawn that notwithstanding the non-linearities and dynamic features the Simulation properties of the model are reasonable in general...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of an optimal-weighted portfolio strategy is evaluated when transaction costs are penalized {{compared to an}} equal-weighted portfolio strategy. The optimal allocation weights are found by maximizing a modified Sharpe ratio measure each trading day, where modified refers to the expected return of an asset in this context. The leverage of the investment is determined by a conditional expectation estimate {{of the number of}} portfolio assets of the next-coming day. A moving window is used to historically measure the transition probabilities of moving from one state to another within this stochastic count process and this is used as an input to the estimator. It is found that the most accurate estimate is the actual trading day’s number of portfolio assets and this is obtained when the size of the moving window is one. Increasing the penalty parameter on transaction costs of selling and buying assets between trading days lowers the <b>aggregated</b> <b>transaction</b> cost and increases the {{performance of}} the optimal-weighted portfolio considerably. The best portfolio performance is obtained when at least 50 % of the capital is invested equally among the assets when maximizing the modified Sharpe ratio. The optimal-weighted and equal-weighted portfolios are constructed on a daily basis, where the allowed VaR 0 : 05 is € 300 000 for each portfolio. This sets the limit on the amount of capital allowed to be invested each trading day, and is determined by empirical VaR 0 : 05 simulations of these two portfolios...|$|R
40|$|As, in Europe, many {{institutional}} {{reforms have}} been undertaken {{to establish an}} economic union, it can be expected that the relevance of borders has decreased over time. For the EU 15, we investigate the expected integration process {{of the market for}} corporate control - an illustrative market for studying integration issues - over the period from 1995 to 2007. Our gravity regressions show that borders lost relevance from 1995 up to the bursting of the new economy bubble. During this period, the transition from the European Economic Community to the European Union at the end of 1993 and the introduction of the euro may have led to accelerated integration. However, thereafter we find no evidence for further progress driven by institutional factors. On the other hand, geographical distance became less relevant for M&As for the entire time span from 1995 to 2007. The continued lack of full integration is also evidenced by heterogeneity inside Europe. This becomes apparent in differing and continuing bilateral border effects. Country pairs with supposedly liberal capital market thinking, such as the Netherlands, Germany and the UK are found to be divided by relatively small barriers. Hence, a still existing lack of integration in Europe may not be a result of missing institutional reforms. In the Poisson estimations, the results depend neither on the choice of the number of observations nor on the log of <b>aggregated</b> <b>transaction</b> value as the dependent variable; however, the use of the levels is inappropriate.

Each service is described in the catalogue according to a form specifying data fields, geographical coverage, temporal span, search criteria and reporting facilities on data records. The information has been derived from WEB sites, email contacts with service providers, trial runs, and interviews with users. Services listed herein offer data on imports and exports on all types of commodities over the last decade. The use of the data is generic: they can support studies related to trade in diverse domains and applications. Trade data described in this catalogue have a regulatory origin because they stem from declarations made by importers and exporters to customs authorities. The data are collected at national level, processed, and released for public access under formats respecting national provisions on data confidentiality. Trade data are released in transactional or statistical format and may have a national or multi-national scope. Services on trade transactions are run by companies and are accessible after the payment of subscription fees.

Perhaps the most complex and least well understood segment is that downstream from the packer, e. g., the processor, wholesaler, exporter, retailer and food service (or restaurant) operator. One portion of the Livestock and Meat Marketing Study provided an overview of marketing and pricing methods used in this sector and, in particular, the results of analyses {{of the relationship between}} use of alternative marketing arrangements (AMAs) and the distribution and sales of meat products downstream from the packer. The analyses include both beef and pork products, are descriptive and focus on the relationships among industry articipants beyond the packing plant. The information used includes the results of the industry interviews, data from the industry surveys, and transactions data from meat processors. Primary conclusions related to meat processing, distribution, and sales, are as follows: • Firms differ greatly in the sales, purchase, and pricing methods for meat. Firms rely heavily on the spot market but also use other methods. They also mix-and-match purchase and pricing methods, e. g., buying on the forward market, but pricing on a formula. • Meat processors play an important distribution role in the meat value chain by purchasing large lots from a few sources and selling small lots to many firms. • Packers sort cattle purchased under various marketing arrangements {{to meet the needs of}} its buyers, but <b>aggregate</b> <b>transactions</b> data suggest that downstream marketing arrangements have little or no relationship to cattle purchase methods or branded beef sales programs.
