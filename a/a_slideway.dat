5000|$|Examples of {{stick-slip}} can {{be heard}} from hydraulic cylinders, tractor wet brakes, honing machines etc. Special dopes {{can be added to}} the hydraulic fluid or the cooling fluid to overcome or minimize the stick-slip effect. Stick-slip is also experienced in lathes, mill centres, and other machinery where something slides on <b>a</b> <b>slideway.</b> Slideway oils typically list [...] "prevention of stick-slip" [...] as one of their features. Other examples of the stick-slip phenomenon include the music that comes from bowed instruments, the noise of car brakes and tires, and the noise of a stopping train. Stick-slip also has been observed in articular cartilage in mild loading and sliding conditions, which could result in an abrasive wear of the cartilage. Another example of the stick-slip phenomenon occurs when musical notes are played with a glass harp by rubbing a wet finger along the rim of a crystal wine glass. One animal that produces sound using stick-slip friction is the spiny lobster which rubs its antennae over smooth surfaces on its head. Another, more common example which produces sound using stick-slip friction is the grasshopper.|$|E

40|$|The {{construction}} of a long-range tunneling profilometer based on <b>a</b> ''Nanostep'' <b>slideway</b> is reported. This profilometer has potential capability of measuring surface profiles over a complete traverse of 50 mm horizontally and 15 mum vertically. Its characteristics have been investigated over both long and short scanning ranges. Results are presented {{of a series of}} repeat measurements over 1. 4 -mm traces on a gold-coated silicon wafer. A repeatability of better than 0. 2 nm is obtained and surface features of a few nanometers have been resolved laterally. Anomalies in the characteristic of tunneling current with the bias voltage are discussed in terms of surface contaminants and physical contact between tip and sample. Some problems in the application of STM in nanometric metrology are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Hysteretic {{behavior}} {{in the direction of}} sliding is investigated for kinematically constrained slideways, using a special system produced to study the limits of performance of thin-film polymer on glass bearings. A typical configuration for <b>a</b> superprecision instrument <b>slideway</b> using PTFE pads and a Zerodur counterface is shown to exhibit around 200 -nm sliding hysteresis. Moreover, this value is strongly dependent on the total load on the bearing system. The pattern of dependence is consistent with an established model of contact under oblique forces, although the materials conditions at the interface are much more complex than those assumed in that model. Full isolation of these properties is not possible with the present experiments, but they indicate that die shear modulus of the interface layer is more than ten times greater than that of bulk polymer.

40|$|The {{flatness}} {{of machine}} slideways and surface plates is often {{critical to the}} precision of machined surfaces or the accuracy of measurements. Yet {{there are very few}} viable methods or techniques for measuring this important parameter. The most common methods use auto-collimators or electronic levels to measure angular deviations in the surface to arrive at an estimation of the flatness. These methods are time-consuming and result in a limited number of data points. The error motions of an assembled machine tool or metrology instrument can also be measured using conventional methods, but the contribution due to the slideway flatness is difficult to determine directly. A prototype grazing incidence interferometer capable of performing these measurements has been designed, built and tested at Tropel. Results of measurements of a variety of surfaces are given in order to illustrate the prototype instrument’s capabilities. In particular, the results of measurements from <b>a</b> machine tool <b>slideway</b> and <b>a</b> granite surface plate are provided. 1...|$|R
30|$|An S-lay crane barge, named CNOOC 201, {{has been}} built for pipe laying in {{deepwater}} oil/gas fields in the South China Sea. It is due to be commissioned {{by the end of}} the year 2010. A special lifting system is developed to meet the challenge that installing deepwater risers from an S-lay barge is difficult and has not been achieved. The purpose of this paper was to investigate the model test on such an innovative system, which has to be done before field application. By applying the similarity theory, the movement of the S-lay barge is simulated through a six degrees-of-freedom motion platform, and a truncated model riser is utilized for the model testing. The displacement and force boundary conditions at the truncated position of the riser are obtained from the catenary governing equation and become realized by <b>a</b> <b>slideway</b> cart and a loading system designed to control the configuration of the model riser, which presents a similar configuration to a real riser in deepwater. The test results are in very good agreement with theoretical calculations, showing that the active truncated test is applicable for controlling the configuration of the deepwater riser in model testing investigation.|$|E
40|$|Expressions for the {{load-carrying}} capacity, {{stiffness and}} damping rate of pressurized oil film bearings are derived and {{expressed in terms}} of the variables available to the designer. By adding a simple automatic flow valve, operated by pressure feed-back, the pressurized oil film exhibits infinite stiffness to steady normal loads. The method can be adapted for a system, embodying pilot pad control of a main bearing pad, in which the pilot pad slides on a flat strip and the film thickness of the main pad is varied to compensate for undulations in the main <b>slideway.</b> <b>A</b> further experimental and theoretical investigation is described in which feed-back control is used to support concentrically the shaft of a journal bearing. With a shaft diameter of 2 in. and a radial clearance of 0, 002 in. the eccentricity is generally not greater than 2 x 10 - 5 in., as inferred from the pressure measurements, for loads exceeding 300 Ib and rotational speeds up to 1200 rev/&. It is argued that much greater loads and higher rotational speeds can be attained with virtually no eccentricity. NOTATIO...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} <b>a</b> novel <b>slideway</b> {{bearing design}} comprised of a thin-film (0. 1 mm- 0. 2 mm) of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) bound to a rigid hemispherical substrate. Two prototype bearing designs were fabricated and tested {{to characterize the}} coefficient of friction (dynamic and static) and wear of the polymer. In addition, similar bearings were incorporated into a kinematically constrained rectilinear carriage to determine the repeatability of motion during multiple traverses. The first bearing had a radius of curvature {{on the order of}} 2. 38 mm incorporating an UHMWPE film thickness between 0. 1 mm and 0. 2 mm. The friction coefficient was measured to be between 0. 155 and 0. 189 for normal loads of 11. 5 N and 2. 2 N, respectively at a surface speed of 4. 2 mm {center_dot} s{sup - 1 }. This bearing failed after a traverse of approximately 700 m at a load of 11. 5 N. A similar evaluation procedure was carried out on a bearing of radius 6. 35 mm resulting in a friction coefficient between 0. 125 and 0. 185 at loads of 27. 8 N and 2. 2 N, respectively, and the bearing endured a traverse of over 2. 2 km at a load of approximately 28 N (in both air and vacuum conditions) with a surface speed of 4. 2 mm {center_dot} s{sup - 1 }. The second bearing prototype was further subjected to a repeatability test. In this setup, a carriage incorporating five bearings was traversed in a nominally linear path while vertical deviations for multiple traverses were measured by a custom built displacement sensor. Deviations from a linear path were observed to repeat to within a few nanometers about nominal variations of less than 10 nm for a traverse distance of 10 mm. This system and other subsystems used to characterize the friction coefficient and noise of the polymer bearing are presented...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{deterministic}} structuring of {{a surface}} {{is having a}} profound effect on many industrial products by allowing the manufacturer to significantly alter the way in which a surface functions. This has led to a clear need in industry and academia for traceable areal surface texture measurements. To address this need traceable transfer artefacts and primary instrumentation are required. The National Physical Laboratory (NPL) is working on two projects – one to develop areal transfer artefacts and one to develop a traceable areal surface texture measuring instrument. The authors describe the development of the artefacts and instrument, and present some of the challenges that are still required to be able to offer an areal traceability measurement service to industry. The instrument has a working volume of 8 mm × 8 mm × 0. 1 mm and uses <b>a</b> co-planar air-bearing <b>slideway</b> to move the sample. It also uses a novel vertical displacement measuring probe, incorporating an air-bearing and an electromagnetic force control mechanism. The motions of the slideway and the probe are measured by laser interferometers thus ensuring traceability of the measurements to the definition of the metre. The artefacts were manufactured using a range of machining technologies and in a range of geometries suitable for stylus and optical based instruments...|$|R
40|$|The {{determination}} of rockfall impact force {{is crucial in}} designing protection measures. In the present study, laboratory tests are carried out by testing the weight {{and shape of the}} falling rock fragments, drop height, incident angle, platform on the slideway, and cushion layer on the protection measures to investigate their influences on the impact force. The test results indicate that the impact force is positively exponential to the weight of rockfall and the instantaneous impact velocity of the rockfall approaching the protection measures. The impact velocity is found to be dominated not only by the drop height but also by the shape of rockfall and the length of the platform on the <b>slideway.</b> <b>A</b> great drop height and/or a short platform produces a fast impact velocity. Spherical rockfalls experience a greater impact velocity than cubes and elongated cuboids. A layer of cushion on the protection measures may reduce the impact force to a greater extent. The reduction effects are dominated by the cushion material and the thickness of the cushion layer. The thicker the cushion layer, the greater the reduction effect and the less the impact force. The stiffer the buffer material, the lower the buffering effect and the greater the impact force. The present study indicates that the current standard in China for designing protection measures may overestimate the impact force by not taking into consideration the rockfall shape, platform, and cushion layer...|$|R
