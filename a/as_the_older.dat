5|$|Christopher Eccleston was {{the only}} one of the four lead actors who was already an {{established}} television face, having previously co-starred in the ITV crime drama series Cracker. Eccleston first heard about the project while working with Danny Boyle on the film Shallow Grave in the autumn of 1993. Initially, Eccleston had been considered by the production team as a candidate to play Geordie, but he was more interested in playing Nicky, who he saw as a more emotionally complex character. Eccleston was particularly concerned about being able to successfully perform with the Newcastle Geordie accent. He did not even attempt the accent at his audition, concentrating instead on characterisation. He drew inspiration for his performance <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> Nicky from Peter Flannery himself, basing aspects of his characterisation on Flannery's personality. He even wore some of the writer's own colourful shirts.|$|E
5|$|The DDL design evolved {{during the}} late 1960s. As a result of {{planning}} conducted during 1967 and 1968, it gradually {{became clear that the}} ships would replace rather than complement the Navy's three s and four early s. Accordingly, it was specified in 1969 that the DDLs would be more capable and flexible than originally conceived, allowing the RAN to maintain its capabilities <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> destroyers retired. The intended roles for the DDLs' were set in 1970 by an agreement between the RAN and Department of Defence, which specified that the ships were to be capable of destroying equivalent surface warships, carrying out maritime interdiction duties, commanding groups of patrol boats and aircraft, have reasonable anti-aircraft and anti-submarine capabilities and be able to provide naval gunfire support to land forces.|$|E
5|$|When the War of the Austrian Succession started, Winterfeldt {{was sent}} {{on a mission}} to St. Petersburg, which, however, failed. He then {{commanded}} a grenadier battalion with great distinction at the Battle of Mollwitz, and won further glory in the celebrated minor combat of Rothschloss, where the Prussian hussars defeated the Austrians on 17 May 1741. One month later, Winterfeldt was made a colonel, as also was Zieten, the cavalry leader who had actually commanded at Rothschloss; the latter, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> in years and service, resented the rapid promotion of his junior. After this promotion, Frederick chiefly employed Winterfeldt as a confidential staff officer to represent his views to the generals, a position in which Winterfeldt needed extraordinary tact and knowledge of men and affairs, {{and as a matter of}} course made many enemies.|$|E

5|$|These {{ships were}} {{designed}} by Sir Edward Reed, the Director of Naval Construction, as replacements for the various gunvessels built for the Crimean War. Being built of green timber, their hulls were starting to rot after {{a decade or more}} in service, but their engines were still generally sound. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> ships were broken up their engines were salvaged and transferred to Beacon-class ships under construction. Combat experience against Chinese fortifications had shown that the single 32-pounder smoothbore armament of the earlier ships was not powerful enough so Reed was directed to prepare a twin-screw, shallow draft design suitable for riverine operations that incorporated a pair of steam engines from the older gunboats, a heavy armament, and enough freeboard to allow for service at sea. These rather contradictory requirements forced Reed to discard traditional wooden framing for these ships and the Beacon class became the first ships of the Royal Navy to be framed in iron with wooden planking.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, Warrandyte became a popular {{destination}} for {{artists of the}} Heidelberg School, who sought subject matter further into the bush.

25|$|Since {{characterisation}} and {{the choice}} of law rules were operating inflexiblly, the solution has been to allow the growth of judicial discretion within both parts of the system.

It is accepted that the words have the same apparent spirit <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> approach, which requires some caution in their evaluation.|$|E

25|$|Ancient Greek, ancient Roman {{and medieval}} {{philosophers}} usually combined the geocentric {{model with a}} spherical Earth.

25|$|Even {{among those}} reconstructionist groups who see {{themselves}} {{as part of the}} broader, Pagan or Neopagan spectrum, or who simply see some members of the Pagan community as allies, there is still a refusal to accept or identify with {{what they see as the}} more problematic aspects of that community, such as the above-noted eclecticism, cultural appropriation or Wiccan-inspired ritual structures. Many Polytheistic Reconstructionists see Reconstructionism <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> current in the Pagan community, and are unwilling to give up this part of their history simply because eclectic movements are currently more fashionable.|$|E

It could be fired {{from all of the}} same platforms <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> rockets and many of the older launchers were converted to be used with the newer rocket by installing adapter rails, although it also had its own purpose-designed launcher, the 30 cm Raketenwerfer 56.
