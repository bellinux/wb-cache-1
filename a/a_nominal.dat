5|$|The {{confiscation}} of Jewish property gave Göring {{the opportunity}} to amass a personal fortune. Some properties he seized himself or acquired for <b>a</b> <b>nominal</b> price. In other cases, he collected bribes for allowing others to steal Jewish property. He took kickbacks from industrialists for favourable decisions as Four Year Plan director, and money for supplying arms to the Spanish Republicans in the Spanish Civil War via Pyrkal in Greece (although Germany was supporting Franco and the Nationalists).|$|E

This would be his only chance of a smoke for hours, and the billiard-room was the best place for it.|$|R
40|$|This paper studies, in a {{model of}} entry deterrence, {{conditions}} under which a small cost of changing nominal prices combined with a real rigidity leads to <b>a</b> large <b>nominal</b> rigidity. The entry deterrence environment, which generates the real rigidity, provides an appealing explanation as to why firms sometimes react to shocks by changing output instead of prices. As in Ball and Romer (1990), <b>a</b> large <b>nominal</b> rigidity arises with some parameter values; it is not, however, monotonically increasing as real prices become more rigid.

5|$|After {{returning}} to Kathmandu, in complicity with Rana Bahadur, Bhimsen indulged in appropriating the palaces and properties of deposed members of Shah family, which he shared {{between himself and}} his supporter Rangnath Paudel. This aroused resentment and jealousy among Sher Bahadur Shah (Rana Bahadur's step brother) and his faction, since they did not receive any portion of this confiscated property, despite their help in reinstating Rana Bahadur to power. They were also wary of Bhimsen's growing power. By this time, Rana Bahadur was <b>a</b> <b>nominal</b> figure and Kaji Bhimsen Thapa was single-handedly controlling the central administration of the country, being able to implement even unpopular reforms like Baisathi Haran.|$|E

5|$|After {{the mint}} closed, it {{performed}} {{a variety of}} functions for the Federal government.

Then, in 1932, the assay office closed and the building was converted into a Federal prison, in which capacity it served until 1943. The Coast Guard then took over the building as <b>a</b> <b>nominal</b> storage facility, though in truth the structure was largely abandoned and left to decay until it was transferred to the state of Louisiana in 1965. During the Cold War, when many believed there to be a high risk of nuclear war, the old Mint was considered to be the best fallout shelter in the city.|$|E
5|$|An {{independent}} {{company at}} this time had <b>a</b> <b>nominal</b> strength of 20 officers and 275 other ranks.

5|$|By December 1942 {{there were}} {{concerns}} that even Oak Ridge {{was too close}} to a major population center (Knoxville) in the unlikely event of a major nuclear accident. Groves recruited DuPont in November 1942 to be the prime contractor for the construction of the plutonium production complex. DuPont was offered a standard cost plus fixed-fee contract, but the President of the company, Walter S. Carpenter, Jr., wanted no profit of any kind, and asked for the proposed contract to be amended to explicitly exclude the company from acquiring any patent rights. This was accepted, but for legal reasons <b>a</b> <b>nominal</b> fee of one dollar was agreed upon. After the war, DuPont asked to be released from the contract early, and had to return 33 cents.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} article is to explicate the {{structure}} of metaphors. In section 1, we outline the main theories on metaphors, including selection restriction, comparison of similarities, converstational principles and semantic extension, {{and then point out}} their respective problems. Section 2 deals with nominal metaphors among three types of metaphors, namely, nominal ones, predicative ones and sentential ones. The nominal metaphors consist of <b>a</b> subject <b>nominal,</b> <b>a</b> predicate <b>nominal</b> and copula "be". Firstly, the former two are analyzed {{from the point of view}} of their referentiality. Secondly, the characteristics of the copula "be" are explored in terms of the intension function/ the extension function. Considering these facts, section 3 leads us to the epistemological representation of metaphors...|$|R
