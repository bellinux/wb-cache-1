5|$|To use <b>absolutely</b> no {{word that}} does not {{contribute}} to the presentation.|$|E
5|$|I {{wanted to}} speak a little about people who {{impressed}} the most, and somehow I kept on ignoring his performances in my previous two banters during this Olympiad, which is ridiculous, but I think pride of place goes to Eugenio Torre. You probably know who he is, and you probably have read about his results by now, but what he achieved during this Olympiad is <b>absolutely</b> tremendous. He {{is by no means}} a young man by now and he... played a tremendous level of opposition. The Philippines are a decently strong team and they played very, very decent opposition almost throughout the tournament. The result Eugenio showed in this event is <b>absolutely</b> fantastic.|$|E
5|$|Recommendation #3: Assured {{access to}} the balance in the Nuclear Waste Fund (NWF) and to the {{revenues}} generated by annual nuclear waste fee payments from utility ratepayers is <b>absolutely</b> essential and must be provided to the new nuclear waste management organization.|$|E
5|$|The Annal stone gives <b>absolutely</b> no {{indication}} of {{a division of the}} Egyptian realm. Barta, TeVelde, Wilkinson and Edwards argue that the theory of state division is untenable. An administrative reorganization or split in the priesthood sects is more likely.|$|E
5|$|This {{property}} {{expresses the}} completeness of Euclidean space: that a series that converges <b>absolutely</b> also converges {{in the ordinary}} sense.|$|E
5|$|Adiantum viridimontanum {{closely resembles}} the other {{species in the}} A.pedatum complex (A.pedatum and A.aleuticum), and {{distinguishing}} the three {{in the field is}} difficult. Paris and Windham, in their study of the complex, noted that while each species, collectively, can be distinguished from the others, no single morphological character was <b>absolutely</b> distinctive among species. Sterile triploid hybrids between A.viridimontanum and the other two species may occur, further complicating field identification.|$|E
5|$|Do I wish I {{had never}} endured post-partum depression? <b>Absolutely.</b> But {{to deny the}} {{experience}} is to deny who I am. I still mourn the loss of what could have been, but I also feel deep gratitude for those who stood by me, for the lesson that we must never be afraid to ask for help, and for the feeling of summer that still remains.|$|E
5|$|For Jains, lacto-vegetarianism (generally known {{simply as}} vegetarianism in India) is mandatory. Food which {{contains}} even small particles of the bodies of dead animals or eggs is <b>absolutely</b> unacceptable. Some Jain scholars and activists support veganism, as the production of dairy products is perceived to involve violence against cows.|$|E
5|$|I {{am afraid}} my {{men will be}} very angry when they see it. I cannot {{understand}} why the old man cannot do justice to those to whom he owed so much {{and the whole thing}} is so <b>absolutely</b> inconsistent with what he had already cabled.|$|E
5|$|I did not {{interfere}} {{in any way}} with the dispositions made by the police authorities on the spot. I never overruled those authorities nor overrode them. From beginning to end the police had an <b>absolutely</b> free hand.... I did not send for the Artillery or the Engineers. I was not consulted {{as to whether they}} should be sent for.|$|E
5|$|In April 2015, metal {{detectors}} were installed {{as a permanent}} fixture to the entrance. The attraction officially had {{metal detectors}}, security with metal detecting wands, and a zero tolerance policy for cell phones, wallets, coins, watches, cameras, {{anything that could be}} placed in one's pockets; all pockets were to be <b>absolutely</b> empty prior to boarding. Persons in violation would be sent to the lockers or possibly ejected from the park without a refund.|$|E
5|$|It's my {{definitive}} {{statement in}} regards to the incredible pay-back I've received for having the nerve to talk about the things that I did {{in the past few years}} with my Sex book and my record. It's getting it off my chest. It is defensive, <b>absolutely.</b> But it's also sarcastic, tongue-in-cheek. And I'm not sorry. I do not apologize for any of it.|$|E
5|$|Mike was in {{character}} the entire time. He and Madonna {{really had a}} great chemistry together. This video shows her <b>absolutely</b> hysterical sense of humour, and it's great {{for everyone to see}} that side of her. This was by far the most fun I've ever had making a video.|$|E
5|$|P. p. barbarus, {{described}} by Charles Vaurie under its current name in 1954, is resident in North Africa and on La Palma in the Canary Islands. Compared to P. p. erythropthalmus, it is larger, has a longer tail and wings, and its plumage has a greener gloss. It is the longest-billed form, both <b>absolutely</b> and relatively.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{this story}} was simply content to show {{absolute}} power corrupting <b>absolutely.</b> Unfortunately, aside from Persis, none of the Augments stop {{to think about what}} they're doing or why, and the story of Malik is content to blandly repeat the story of Khan, but without the crucial personal motivator of revenge. I think the writers owed the material more than this.|$|E
5|$|Spacetime {{events are}} not <b>absolutely</b> defined {{spatially}} and temporally but rather are known {{relative to the}} motion of an observer. Minkowski space approximates the Universe without gravity; the pseudo-Riemannian manifolds of general relativity describe spacetime with matter and gravity. String theory postulates the existence of additional dimensions.|$|E
5|$|The entire Lackawanna {{region is}} idle. Week before last this region sent nearly 150,000 tons of coal to market. Last week {{it did not}} send any... The {{situation}} here is <b>absolutely</b> painful, {{and there is no}} knowing what moment an outbreak will occur.|$|E
5|$|There is <b>absolutely</b> {{no doubt}} that before the restoration, the whole ceiling was dirtier, more muted and more {{monochrome}} than Michelangelo ever intended, but when images of the frescoes are viewed in their stained and unrestored state the subtle washes and intense definitions, described by Beck and Arguimbau, still make their presence known, giving mass and bulk to the forms.|$|E
5|$|This is {{yet another}} example of a devoted fanbase and a policy of {{openness}} combining to fill in blanks left by old media barriers. The entire NIN camp is <b>absolutely</b> thrilled that treating our fans with respect and nurturing their creativity has led to such an overwhelming outpour of incredible content, and that we now have such a high quality souvenir from our most ambitious tour ever.|$|E
5|$|Throughout her {{undergraduate}} and medical school attendance, she dated Duane M. J. Green, an engineer. The couple married {{while she was}} studying at the University of Kansas. The couple lived together in Independence, Missouri, while Debora finished her residency, but by 1978 they had separated and then divorced. Debora cited basic incompatibility {{as the reason for}} the divorce—"e had <b>absolutely</b> no common interests", she was later quoted as saying—but the divorce was friendly.|$|E
5|$|While {{predictions}} of the future can never be <b>absolutely</b> certain, present understanding in various fields allows for the prediction of far-future events, if only in the broadest outline. These fields include astrophysics, which has revealed how planets and stars form, interact, and die; particle physics, which has revealed how matter behaves at the smallest scales; evolutionary biology, which predicts how life will evolve over time; and plate tectonics, which shows how continents shift over millennia.|$|E
25|$|Any <b>absolutely</b> {{continuous}} function is uniformly continuous. On the other hand, the Cantor function is uniformly continuous but not <b>absolutely</b> continuous.|$|E
25|$|Other {{releases}} include <b>Absolutely</b> Not, a bloopers and outtakes collection, and <b>Absolutely</b> Fabulous: A Life, a mockumentary including 15minutes of {{new material}} interspersed with clips from the series. Both were only released on VHS in the UK; {{the latter was}} also released as a special feature on the box set release <b>Absolutely</b> Everything in America.|$|E
25|$|Comparison test 1 (see Direct {{comparison}} test): If ∑bnnbsp& is an <b>absolutely</b> {{convergent series}} such that |annbsp&|nbsp&≤ Cnbsp&|bnnbsp&| for some number Cthinsp& and for sufficiently large nnbsp&, then ∑anthinsp& converges <b>absolutely</b> as well. If ∑|bnnbsp&| diverges, and |annbsp&|nbsp&≥ |bnnbsp&| for all sufficiently large nnbsp&, then ∑anthinsp& also fails to converge <b>absolutely</b> (though {{it could still}} be conditionally convergent, e.g. if the annbsp& alternate in sign).|$|E
25|$|Comparison test 2 (see Limit {{comparison}} test): If ∑bnthinsp& is an <b>absolutely</b> {{convergent series}} such that |an+1nbsp&/annbsp&|nbsp&≤ |bn+1nbsp&/bnnbsp&| for sufficiently large nnbsp&, then ∑anthinsp& converges <b>absolutely</b> as well. If ∑|bnnbsp&| diverges, and |an+1nbsp&/annbsp&|nbsp&≥ |bn+1nbsp&/bnnbsp&| for all sufficiently large nnbsp&, then ∑anthinsp& also fails to converge <b>absolutely</b> (though {{it could still}} be conditionally convergent, e.g. if the anthinsp& alternate in sign).|$|E
25|$|In North America, all episodes {{have been}} {{released}} on DVD by BBC Video and Warner Home Video, including a complete collection named <b>Absolutely</b> Everything. The Last Shout and Gay (which were released in the UK individually) were released as a collection called <b>Absolutely</b> Special in 2003. Another feature-length special White Box was released exclusively to the American market. It was eventually released in the United Kingdom on 15 November 2010 with its inclusion in the <b>Absolutely</b> Everything box set.|$|E
