5|$|Geologically the Sulphur Creek {{watershed}} {{was once}} {{part of a large}} and shallow sea that covered most of southern California. As the San Joaquin Hills rose and river sediments were deposited, land gradually emerged to form the present-day Orange County coast. Sulphur Creek is located in <b>a</b> <b>crumpled,</b> hilly area {{in the southern part of}} this range, formed differently from the continuous mountain chain to the north. Historically, being south of Aliso Creek, the Sulphur Creek watershed was part of the territory of the semi-nomadic Acjachemen Indian group, conquered by Spanish conquistadors in the 17th and 18th centuries and renamed the Juaneño by them.|$|E

For peritoneal inclusion cysts, which have <b>a</b> <b>crumpled</b> tissue-paper appearance {{and tend to}} follow the contour of adjacent organs, follow up is based on clinical history. Hydrosalpinx, or fallopian tube dilation, can be mistaken for an ovarian cyst due to its anechoic appearance. Follow-up for this is also based on clinical presentation.|$|E

25|$|Most early landscapes {{are clearly}} imaginary, {{although}} from {{very early on}} townscape views are clearly intended to represent actual cities, {{with varying degrees of}} accuracy. Various techniques were used to simulate the randomness of natural forms in invented compositions: the medieval advice of Cennino Cennini to copy ragged crags from small rough rocks was apparently followed by both Poussin and Thomas Gainsborough, while Degas copied cloud forms from <b>a</b> <b>crumpled</b> handkerchief held up against the light. The system of Alexander Cozens used random ink blots to give the basic shape of an invented landscape, to be elaborated by the artist.|$|E
25|$|La Nausée allows Sartre {{to explain}} his {{philosophy}} in simplified terms. Roquentin is the classic existentialist hero whose attempts to pierce the veil of perception lead him to a strange combination of disgust and wonder. For {{the first part of}} the novel, Roquentin has flashes of nausea that emanate from mundane objects. These flashes appear seemingly randomly, from staring at <b>a</b> <b>crumpled</b> piece of paper in the gutter to picking up a rock on the beach. The feeling he perceives is pure disgust: a contempt so refined that it almost shatters his mind each time it occurs. As the novel progresses, the nausea appears more and more frequently, though he is still unsure of what it actually signifies. However, at the base of a chestnut tree in a park, he receives a piercingly clear vision of what the nausea actually is. Existence itself, the property of existence to be something rather than nothing was what was slowly driving him mad. He no longer sees objects as having qualities such as color or shape. Instead, all words are separated from the thing itself, and he is confronted with pure being.|$|E

2500|$|In 2009, the ASA {{challenged}} {{whether a}} press ad which showed a large green arrow {{bearing down on}} a smaller yellow arrow with <b>a</b> <b>crumpled</b> tip and [...] "Asda 2955 products cheaper" [...] should set out how the general price claims made in the ads could be verified by consumers. Because {{it was not possible}} for consumers or competitors to check the products and prices used in the comparison using mySupermarket.co.uk, and because the ads did not set out how consumers and competitors could check that information for themselves, the ASA concluded that the ads did not satisfy the criterion of verifiability as defined in the 2006 European Court of Justice ruling, and were therefore in breach of the advertising Codes.|$|E
2500|$|... 28 January 1972 – A British Caledonian Vickers VC10-1109 (registration: G-ARTA) with no {{passengers}} aboard sustained severe {{structural damage}} {{as a result}} of a hard landing at Gatwick at the end of a short ferry flight from Heathrow, where the aircraft had been diverted due to fog at Gatwick. After touching down on runway 08 and applying spoilers and reverse thrust, the aircraft became airborne again, bounced twice and landed heavily. This resulted in a burst front wheel tyre, a separated wheel and <b>a</b> <b>crumpled</b> fuselage (immediately in front of and behind the wings). A survey of the aircraft's damage revealed that its airframe was bent out of shape, requiring extensive repairs to be restored to airworthiness. Since the repairs were not cost-effective, the airline's management decided to cannibalise the aircraft for spare parts before scrapping it at Gatwick in 1975.|$|E

2500|$|In 1953, {{one of the}} {{earliest}} paintings of his career as an artist presented <b>a</b> <b>crumpled</b> American flag defaced with the word 'Peace'. Thomas E. Crow contrasts this work with Jasper Johns’s [...] "anonymous stenciling", drawing attention to the way Hedrick mimics the flamboyant calligraphy found in the decoration of hot-rod cars. Crow sees the work in contrast to Johns’s reticence, as a protest aimed against the waste of lives in Korea, and at Cold War adventurism in general. Additionally, Peace (1953), [...] "demonstrates an intuitive understanding of 'language as symbol' which predates the present postmodern use (of language) by twenty years. Hedrick’s pre-pop paintings were included in John Coplan’s historical “Pop Art, USA," [...] the first exhibition to attempt a collective look at the movement in the United States, presented at the Oakland Art Museum during September, 1963. [...] Even after his Pop Art phase, Hedrick continued [...] "his risk-taking forays into regions where, mostly, angels fear to tread".|$|E

This was achieved by using two shoulder-height roll bars, <b>a</b> <b>crumple</b> zone around the front wheel and an aluminium roll cage creating a car-like safety cell. It also had twin seatbelts reminiscent of an aviation style four-point harness to keep the rider in place.|$|R
