25|$|On 5 October 1992, the Board of Governors of the Bundesbahn and the Reichsbahn {{determined}} {{the route of}} the new line. The spatial planning procedure was launched on 20October 1992. The Free State of Bavaria gave its opinion on the 1March 1993. It confirmed the compatibility of two options with the goals of land planning. The essential requirements were an ICE stop in Coburg, the replacement of embankments by bridges in ecologically sensitive areas, the relocation of the planned over-taking station in Dorfles-Esbach to the south and the lowest possible crossing of the Main valley to the north of Ebensfeld. An option, which involved a route through Coburg, was abandoned in this context. In its opinion of 20 April 1993, the State of Thuringia sought, among others, an Interregio stop in the Ilmenau area, a shift of the line in the Gehren / Gräfinau-Angstedt area to the west, a western bypass of Molsdorf to protect the drinking water catchment area of Erfurt and the bundling of the route with the A71 autobahn between Erfurt and Ilmenau. The planning <b>approval</b> <b>procedure</b> (as of mid-1994) would be carried out jointly in accordance with the railway law for both routes in this section.|$|E

The problem of consensus improvement is also analysed. Suggestions for better structuring of the decision process in transmission planning, with high involvement of stakeholders, are made.

30|$|The table {{shows that}} in the sector of railway construction, the public display of project {{documents}} is as rare as in procedures according to the Federal Immission Control Act. In road construction, public participation differs from federal state to federal state. In the state of Saxony, 216 public planning permission procedures and 205 planning <b>approval</b> <b>procedures</b> took place between 1990 and 2002.15 In the sector of road construction in Rhineland-Palatinate, there were 295 planning permission procedures and only 28 administration-internal planning <b>approval</b> <b>procedures</b> between 1994 and 2001 (Ahlborn 2006 : 303). In Thuringia, however, the proportion of planning permission <b>procedures</b> to planning <b>approval</b> <b>procedures</b> between 1992 and 2000 was 123 – 381. Generally, there is the tendency that in the Eastern states more road construction projects are approved within the administration only than in the Western states.|$|R

It was continued between 2013 and 2015 with three changes in planning procedures and concluded by an approval on 30 July 2015. Construction work in section between Breitengüßbach (km68.9+73) and Zapfendorf (km77.7+07) began in 2015 and is due to be completed in late 2017 (status: February2014). The corresponding building contract was awarded to Leonhardt Weiss & Co. KG in October 2015 for €145 million. The mainline was completely blockaded from 11 January to 4 September 2016. The cost of the substitute buses was about €3.5 million. The planning approval process also applied to changes at Nuremberg Hauptbahnhof.|$|E

30|$|Formalised public {{participation}} in project <b>approval</b> <b>procedures</b> is rarely addressed in technology assessment. Empirical data about {{public participation}} processes {{are taken into}} account even more rarely. This article explores the practice of public participation in infrastructure projects in the Federal Republic of Germany on the basis of empirical data from the period of 1990 to 2010. The author compares the empirical data about participation processes with the targets of the public participation and asks for the reasons for the lack of participation in formalised <b>approval</b> <b>procedures.</b> Furthermore, the author contrasts participation formats used in technology assessment with formalised public participation. In his conclusions, he advocates for a stronger combination of formalised and informal public participation in technology assessment.|$|R
30|$|Even though {{environment}}-relevant <b>approval</b> <b>procedures</b> are of high {{environment and}} socio-political importance, systematic {{research into the}} actual participation in formalised <b>approval</b> <b>procedures</b> was carried out only marginally in Germany over the last 20  years (Wende 2001; UfU 1993, 2002). The public debate {{on the effectiveness of}} formalised participation procedures in Germany is conducted without knowledge of the concrete practice of environment-relevant <b>approval</b> <b>procedures.</b> Even though it is important and correct to discuss and develop new formats and designs of participation and to address the question about how to combine formalised participation procedures with informal formats of participation, the current experience with formalised participation procedures should not be ignored (see Dialogics 2011; Bertelsmann-Stiftung 2011). To ensure the necessary blending of formalised participation procedures and informal formats of participation, it is important to research and analyse the practise of the formalised participation as it is now. The relevant questions in this context are how many permission procedures with public participation are taking place, what are the topics objections and comments from citizens or recognised environmental organisations in the context of technology-related permission procedures, and what effects the objections and comments have on the permission process.|$|R
