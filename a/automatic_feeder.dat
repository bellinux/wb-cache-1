5000|$|Another {{hypothesis}} {{dates to}} 1907, [...] "when John Brandtjen convinced two young machinists from Oslo, Norway named Abel and Eneval Kluge to service and install presses for his fledgling printing equipment firm". In 1919, the brothers invented an <b>automatic</b> <b>feeder</b> for printing presses which, by 1929, allowed Brandtjen and Kluge {{to move into}} a 3-story building in St. Paul, MN. While the <b>automatic</b> <b>feeder</b> was a success, unverified sources claim that it developed a reputation for being [...] "temperamental, subject to frequent breakdowns, and devilishly difficult to repair — but oh, so clever!" [...] The Kluge brothers continued to innovate, and the company remained active as of 2017. Given that the feeder bore the Kluge name, it seems reasonable that it became a byword for over-complex mechanical contraptions. The Free Online Dictionary of Computing (FOLDOC) claims that the term kluge [...] "was used in connection with computers {{as far back as the}} mid-1950s and, at that time, was used exclusively for hardware kluges". The fact that it was originally applied only to hardware again points back to the paper feeder as the origin. FOLDOC goes on to say, [...] "TMRC and the MIT hacker culture of the early 1960s seems to have developed in a milieu that remembered and still used some WWII military slang (see also foobar). It seems likely that 'kluge' came to MIT via alumni of the many military electronics projects run in Cambridge during the war (many in MIT's venerable Building 20, which housed TMRC until the building was demolished in 1999)."

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{main goal}} of modern {{intensive}} fish farms {{should be to}} increase productivity at a low cost. The automation of fish feeding {{plays an important role}} in this scenario since it may improve feed efficiency and reduce organic waste emissions. The aim of this experiment was to provide basic information for the development of feeding techniques using <b>automatic</b> <b>feeders.</b> The experiment was done from September to December, with tilapia weighing 185 g, fed 48 meals a day at 22 or 30 minute intervals, with feeding rates of 2, 3 and 4 % of live weight. Eighteen 1 m 3 net cages equipped with <b>automatic</b> <b>feeders</b> were distributed in one pond. During the experimental trial the mean values for dissolved oxygen, pH and temperature were 3. 20 mg/l, 8. 03 and 25. 43 °C, respectively. The highest average weight of 683. 73 g was achieved for fish treated with 4 % of live weight at 30 minute intervals between meals. There was no difference for viscero-somatic index, demonstrating no alteration in the final carcass quality. These results demonstrate that a higher feeding rate added to efficient feed management can be used at the final stages of raising Nile tilapia in cages without compromising final fish productive quality...|$|R

The first trial involved 72 sows penned on a slatted floor in a dynamic group with connected drinkers and <b>automatic</b> <b>feeders,</b> whereas the second trial was carried out on 4 small groups of 6 sows penned on a concrete floor with straw and fed in individual stalls. Firstly, an algorithm was built from video recordings of 24 sows on the slatted floor (2 x 2 h sequences per sow, 96 h). Secondly, {{the accuracy of the}} algorithm was assessed by recording and sequencing 96 h and 109 h, respectively, on the slatted floor and concrete floor with straw. The respective sensitivities of the lying, standing and moving behaviours on the slatted floor were 94. 4 %, 66. 9 % and 68. 4 %. With straw, lower sensitivity values were found: 93. 65 % for lying, 68. 35 % for standing and 38. 83 % for moving, linked to more investigative behaviours using the head. The final step was to use these data to improve the feeding practices of pregnant sows, taking their activity level into account. The strong inter- and intra-individual variability shown in the physical activity is a limiting factor for detection of health problems, such as lameness, through the accelerometers. Thus we need additional information, especially the behaviour data generated by identified drinkers and <b>automatic</b> <b>feeders...</b>|$|R

40|$|In general, {{demand feeding}} devices are {{equipped}} with a mechanical trigger switch. Such a switch is not suitable for juvenile fish with a small body size, because the body weight is insufficient to trigger the feeder. An infrared light sensor that {{does not require the}} fish to push a feeder switch is more suitable for small fish. The brown-marbled grouper Epinephelus fuscoguttatus is an important fish species in Southeast Asia. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare the growth rates (GRs) of brown-marbled grouper juveniles reared using customised demand feeding devices with an infrared light sensor (the infrared light demand feeder (IRDF) group) and automatic feeding devices (the <b>automatic</b> <b>feeder</b> (AF) group). The results indicated that GRs of standard lengths and body weights showed no significant differences using one-way analysis of variance; however, the standard length of the IRDF group showed a tendency of a higher GR than the AF group. Although the feed conversion ratio (FCR) also showed no significant difference, the FCR of the IRDF group was more efficient, indicating that the IRDF group yielded a more desirable FCR. These results indicate that IRDF can be used in the culture of brown-marbled grouper juveniles. In view of the working schedule of the fish farm staff, IRDF are superior to other feeding devices, because they are less labour-intensive than usual tasks. We conclude that IRDF is a useful feeding system for aquaculture...|$|E

40|$|State {{estimation}} has 			been {{adopted by}} the power system researchers in the late 1960 s. 			Later on, state estimation {{was applied to the}} transmission system. 			Recently state estimation has become cornerstone among the modern 			control centers tools for the automation of distribution system. In 			this research work, state estimation has been implemented for 			<b>automatic</b> <b>feeder</b> reconfiguration. <b>Automatic</b> <b>feeder</b> reconfiguration 			can be accomplished by matching the impedances of two different 			feeders. Once the impedances are matched, static transfer switch 			perform the feeder reconfiguration effectively and efficiently. 			The liability of power distribution companies is to provide reliable 			and good quality power to the customers. Due to the technological 			advancement and the large scale production, usage of the sensitive 			equipment has been increased. The sensitive equipment requires 			quality power through reliable power delivery system. Power delivery 			system includes feeders and laterals to transfer power from the 			substation to the consumer end. As the feeders and the laterals are 			radially operated, therefore the chances of power interruption 			always exist. Power interruption may occur either due to faults or 			due to the maintenance or replacement of any components of the 			distribution system e. g. a distribution transformer. Voltage sag is 			another cause of interruption of sensitive equipment. To overcome 			this problem, sensitive equipment should be fed through two 			independent feeders. If the preferred feeder fails, the sensitive 			load should be transferred to the alternate feeder. A fast and 			efficient transfer switch can complete this transfer. Static 			transfer switch (STS) system has been developed to transfer the load 			from the preferred feeder to the alternate feeder when voltage sag 			or fault occurs on the preferred feeder. The most important 			parameter of the STS-system is the speed of operation or the 			transfer time so that the load should not be interrupted. To reduce 			the transfer time and hence to expedite the transfer process, it is 			necessary that both feeders have the same voltage angle at the 			point-of-installation (PoI) of the STS. If the impedances of both 			the feeders are identical then voltage phase difference will be 			zero. To match the impedance, state estimator has been designed to 			estimate the voltage angle of both the feeders. To mitigate the 			voltage phase difference, shunt capacitor has been installed and 			consequently the transfer time of the STS has been reduced. 			However, the control logic strategy of the STS-system also affect 			the transfer time. Two different control logic techniques namely 			delay logic and forced commutation technique, have been developed 			and simulated using PSCAD/EMTDC software. If the delay logic 			technique is utilized then the voltage phase angle of both feeders 			must be identical. The developed state estimation technique can be 			implemented to match the impedances and hence the voltage angle to 			reduce the STS transfer time. However, forced commutation technique 			can accommodate the phase difference by commutating the outgoing 			thyristor forcefully. But forced commutation technique require more 			components e. g. capacitor, inductor, auxiliary thyristors etc. Both 			techniques are implemented to solve the problems related to the 			feeder overloading. 			The problem of overloading has been solved through feeder 			reconfiguration. STS-system installed at critical location, transfer 			the sensitive load to the lightly loaded alternate feeder. This 			phenomenon can be termed as feeder reconfiguration using 			load-balancing. The development of the STS-system has solved the 			problem of load interruption. The reliability of the power 			distribution system has been improved and the sensitive load now 			operates without power interruption...|$|E

40|$|The {{first goal}} {{of this study was}} to gain insight in the {{behaviour}} of a herd of Asian elephants in captivity and to test if their behaviour varies over a longer period. On the other hand, the influence of the use of an enrichment feeder on the behaviour of the elephants was tested. For the first part of the study, the herd and some environmental variables were observed during several weeks, spread over the course of a year. For all observed periods, the frequency of behaviour was the highest for feeding, standing and locomotion. A difference was defined between behaviour that all the animals of the herd showed and individual behaviour. The synchronicity of certain behaviours was tested and the elephants were found to eat and stand synchronous. For locomotion, door directed behaviour and standing by an entrance, a significant difference in behavioural frequency was found between several observation periods. The frequency of stereotypic behaviour, door directed behaviour and standing by an entrance showed a highly significant positive correlation with the mean daily temperature. Also, the longer the animals spent outside, the higher the frequency of standing by an entrance was. The effect of the enrichment feeder was tested using an A 1 BA 2 design.
