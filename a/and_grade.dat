This study proposes a new technique to use principal component analysis (PCA) on 3 D surface points for sizing <b>and</b> <b>grading</b> wearable products. The accuracy of the proposed method is illustrated by developing a sizing <b>and</b> <b>grading</b> rule for the feet. After developing a model using the feet data of 60 participants and validating using the feet data of 10 different participants, results showed that sizing <b>and</b> <b>grading</b> using PCA is more accurate than traditional techniques. Compared with traditional foot sizing, PCA based sizing <b>and</b> <b>grading</b> showed an improvement of about 25 % in accuracy. In addition, results also indicated that the grading rule derived from PCA loading was better than the proportional grading.

40|$|The {{assessment}} {{reform movement}} {{has focused on}} classroom assessment <b>and</b> <b>grading</b> practices as a potential means to improving teaching and learning. Many researchers agree {{that the best way}} to enhance learning for a diverse range of students is through appropriate, reliable, and valid classroom assessment <b>and</b> <b>grading</b> practices. This is of particular importance in Saskatchewan because the inclusive philosophy has been mandated for all schools. Classroom teachers are responsible for the instruction, assessment, <b>and</b> <b>grading</b> of students with mild disabilities, learning, emotional, and behavioral challenges, and other needs that require specific attention. This study examined secondary classroom teachers’ assessment <b>and</b> <b>grading</b> practices in one urban school division. A survey instrument adapted from the work of Duncan and Noonan (2007) and McMillan (2001) asked current secondary teachers, within inclusive classrooms, to indicate their current assessment <b>and</b> <b>grading</b> practices. Evidence from the survey demonstrated that teachers in this division have diverse assessment <b>and</b> <b>grading</b> practices <b>and</b> that they have begun to explore the potential for assessment to assist all students in their learning. This study has provided data to move forward with some professional development opportunities for teachers and further research in assessment <b>and</b> <b>grading</b> with particular focus on students with special needs in inclusive classrooms...|$|R

From 1539 to 1707 the park was owned by the Duke of Somerset, Sir Edward Seymour, brother of Queen Jane; the Thynne family of Longleat, and the family of Sir Henry Gould.

5|$|The first {{discussion}} {{of improving the}} intersection <b>and</b> <b>grade</b> crossing was a study in 1898, since which there have been about three dozen more. The most recent, a 2009 study of the downtown area, examined the possibility of depressing Route 126 under the grade crossing and intersection {{as well as several}} other alternatives including bypasses. The Route 126 depression was deemed to create barriers to walkability downtown, and the recommended alternative was to depress Route 135 under the intersection to prevent it from being affected by trains passing through the grade crossing.

5|$|The {{first modern}} relocations along {{what is now}} K-383 {{occurred}} in Norton. US-36 and US-83 originally entered the city along Washington Street, turned north onto First Avenue, and turned east onto Main Street. The highway followed Main Street {{out of town and}} along a road paralleling the railroad to the present highway. The first realignment was authorized in 1936 to eliminate several right-angle turns and several at-grade railroad crossings. East of the intersection of First and Main, US-36 and US-83 turned north onto State Street and followed the highway to Holme Street, where the highways joined the present course. By 1941, this change was deemed unsatisfactory due to the continued existence of right-angle turns <b>and</b> <b>grade</b> crossings. Shortly thereafter, the highways were moved to their present course bypassing downtown Norton.|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this {{qualitative}} research is to describe the learning experiences of assessment <b>and</b> <b>grading</b> of new teachers and to describe how teaching experience at a school can affect teachers' learning experience. Science method pre-service teachers from a university in New South Wales who gained fulltime employment on completion of their course {{were invited to participate}} in the research project during their first year of teaching. Data was collected from the interested participants to identify their conceptions, actual and intended practices of assessment <b>and</b> <b>grading</b> in three stages using a questionnaire and semi structured interviews in a longitudinal study. Data collected at different stages was compared to describe the learning experiences of new teachers. Furthermore, qualitative data from interviews was analysed to describe how school based teaching experience affect the learning of new teachers. It was found that new teachers experience changes in their conceptions and practices of assessment <b>and</b> <b>grading</b> during the first school semester of their teaching experience. There was minimal change in the teachers' conceptions about the general purpose of assessment <b>and</b> <b>grading.</b> However, there were noticeable changes in the teachers' conceptions about the quality of assessment <b>and</b> <b>grading</b> in terms of what constitutes as acceptable practices of assessment <b>and</b> <b>grading.</b> This suggests that school based teaching experience play a significant role in the learning of the new teachers about assessment <b>and</b> <b>grading,</b> although teachers did not attribute this change to their teaching experience at this school. Findings of this research study have implications for pre-service education programs offered by universities, indicating a need to include more explicit courses in the area of assessment <b>and</b> <b>grading.</b> New teachers also need to be provided with more support in the area of assessment <b>and</b> <b>grading</b> as part of their induction and mentoring systems offered at schools...|$|R

5|$|Modular {{system of}} architecture, eight {{standard}} grades: Although other texts preceded it, {{such as the}} 'National Building Law' of the Tang Dynasty (618–907) which was partially preserved in other texts, the Yingzao Fashi published in 1103 by the Song Dynasty (960–1279) scholar-official Li Jie (1065–1110) is the oldest known Chinese architectural treatise that has survived fully intact. It contains descriptions and illustrations detailing the cai fen system (材份制) of eight standard dimensions for module components of timber architecture and structural carpentry. The eight standard grades of module timber components in the Yingzao Fashi, with grade I being the largest <b>and</b> <b>grade</b> VIII the smallest, {{were used to determine}} the ultimate proportions and scale of a building as a whole, as all timber hall types—palaces, mansions, ordinary houses, and pavilions—were hierarchically categorized along the lines of which cai fen grade was employed. For example, palace type buildings used only grades I through V, while mansion type buildings never used components larger than grade III and no less than grade VI. In this system of structural carpentry, the smallest grade of VIII is represented by one cai; one cai is equal to the modern equivalent of 15cm (5.9in), while one cai is also divided into fifteen fen (hence the title of this modular system).|$|E

The railway line to Crewe follows the same general alignment as the canal, but a little further to the south, as both follow the valley of the River Gowy.

5|$|The highway {{was created}} in the 1930s from an {{existing}} system of roads linking Perth with the Goldfields. Though the name Great Eastern Highway was coined to describe the route from Perth to Guildford on the northern side of the Swan River (modern-day Guildford Road), it was actually used for the road through Belmont, south of the river. This section was constructed in 1867 using convict labour, with the road base made from sections of tree trunks. Over the years the road has been upgraded, with the whole highway sealed by 1953, segments reconstructed and widened, dual carriageways created in Perth and Kalgoorlie, <b>and</b> <b>grade</b> separated interchanges built at major intersections. Great Eastern Highway Bypass in Perth's eastern suburbs opened in 1988, allowing through traffic to avoid the Guildford and Midland townsites, and in 2002 a new bypass diverted the highway around Northam. A future route to replace Great Eastern Highway's current ascent of the Darling Scarp has been identified. The planned route is a controlled-access highway along Toodyay Road to Gidgegannup, and then across to Wundowie via a new alignment.
