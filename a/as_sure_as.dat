In the past {{he had been able to}} “feel twilight gather” but something has changed and he’s no longer <b>as</b> <b>sure</b> <b>as</b> he once was.

500|$|During {{the late}} 1860s and early 1870s, from within his father's firm in Charing Cross and, by late 1874, {{from a nearby}} address in Craig's Court, Carte began to build an operatic, concert and lecture {{management}} agency. His two hundred clients eventually included Charles Gounod, Jacques Offenbach, Adelina Patti, Mario, Clara Schumann, Antoinette Sterling, Edward Lloyd, Mr. and Mrs. German Reed, George Grossmith, Matthew Arnold, James McNeill Whistler and Oscar Wilde. Hesketh Pearson said of Carte: [...] "His acute business sense was aided by a frank and agreeable manner.... He took what other people thought were risks, but he felt were certainties. He knew everyone worth knowing... and his practical judgement was <b>as</b> <b>sure</b> <b>as</b> his sense of artistry." ...|$|E
500|$|In early August 1886, Dunlap {{was sold}} to the Detroit Wolverines for $4,700, the most {{expensive}} purchase price at the time. [...] In addition to the sum paid to the Maroons to grant the release, the Detroit team signed a contract to pay Dunlap $4,500 a season for two seasons, with an advance of $1,500 {{on the first day}} of November 1886 and 1887, respectively. [...] The mid-season sale led to concerns about the Maroons: [...] "The transfer of Dunlap to Detroit is a small thing in itself, but its bearing on the entire base ball world is so great as to almost revolutionize the present order of things. [...] He was the king pin of the St. Louis Club and his sale makes a certainty of the dissolution of the Maroons." [...] The Detroit management was praised for their [...] "pluck and enterprise" [...] in making the bold [...] "business stroke." [...] The Sporting News wrote at the time:"Dunlap has joined the Detroits and now that team will fly the League pennant just <b>as</b> <b>sure</b> <b>as</b> time flies and the world grows. [...] From the day the old St. Louis Union team went out of existence Dunlap has been anything but a favorite in St. Louis. [...] Still there was no one in the world but was willing to concede that he was the greatest second baseman America has ever known." ...|$|E

2500|$|John Dominic Crossan {{considers}} the passage important in establishing that Jesus existed and was crucified, and states: [...] "That he was crucified is <b>as</b> <b>sure</b> <b>as</b> anything historical can ever be, since both Josephus and Tacitus... {{agree with the}} Christian accounts on at least that basic fact." [...] Bart D. Ehrman states: [...] "Tacitus's report confirms what we know from other sources, that Jesus was executed by order of the Roman governor of Judea, Pontius Pilate, sometime during Tiberius's reign." [...] Eddy and Boyd state {{that it is now}} [...] "firmly established" [...] that Tacitus provides a non-Christian confirmation of the crucifixion of Jesus.|$|E

A flying costumed bald man probably in his forties appears in Smallville and starts helping people using his fantastic inventions. He later moves his operations to {{the nearby town of}} Hadley. Superboy finds he is using his inventions to set the town up so he can rob their bank, and stops him. In the last panel, Amazing Man is in jail and he tells Superboy he will regret it <b>as</b> <b>sure</b> <b>as</b> his name is Luthor and Superboy thinks that he will be Superman by the time he gets out and that Luthor's talents might make him an arch enemy.|$|E

2500|$|Modern primality {{tests for}} general numbers n {{can be divided}} into two main classes, {{probabilistic}} (or [...] "Monte Carlo") and deterministic algorithms. Deterministic algorithms provide a way to tell for sure whether a given number is prime or not. [...] For example, trial division is a deterministic algorithm because, if performed correctly, it will always identify a prime number as prime and a composite number as composite. [...] Probabilistic algorithms are normally faster, but do not completely prove that a number is prime. These tests rely on testing a given number in a partly random way. [...] For example, a given test might pass all the time if applied to a prime number, but pass only with probability p if applied to a composite number. [...] If we repeat the test n times and pass every time, then the probability that our number is composite is 1/(1-p)n, which decreases exponentially with the number of tests, so we can be <b>as</b> <b>sure</b> <b>as</b> we like (though never perfectly sure) that the number is prime. [...] On the other hand, if the test ever fails, then we know that the number is composite.|$|E
2500|$|One {{commentator}} {{has said}} that the exterior of the Cathedral is probably the most complete and consistent of all Petre's churches. [...] "The majesty of the dome is best seen from the rear, and from most parts of the city it registers powerfully above the Christchurch flatness in a manner reminiscent of Brunelleschi's dome in Florence". George Bernard Shaw during his 1934 visit was unimpressed with Gilbert Scott's Anglican cathedral but generous in his praise of Petre's Catholic one. [...] "In fact it was Shaw {{who was one of the}} first to open local eyes to the quality of this building." [...] In 1970 under Bishop Ashby, [...] "years of grime deposited from the [...] nearby railway station and gasworks were cleaned off and restoration work was carried out." [...] "The great joy of the cathedral, however, is the interior. Petre's handling of natural light is <b>as</b> <b>sure</b> <b>as</b> ever, the nave and sanctuary are suffused with daylight. The [...] fine Corinthian and Ionic columns down each side of the nave are a development of the design of St Patrick's Basilica, Oamaru, here doubled in height, for obviously single columns in this great nave would have required enormous girth. The sanctuary dome is undoubtedly the climax of the interior; it is here that the full power of the design is unleashed. This was Petre's finest achievement in forty years of practice. Fascinating vistas are gained through the arches which transmit the enormous weight of the dome to the four massive piers. These are decorated with subtle flutings, a fresh variation on an ancient theme. In this sanctuary the liturgy can be seen as drama and it receives a fitting setting for its movement and colour".|$|E
