5|$|A varsity {{baseball}} team is an established part {{of physical education}} departments at most high schools and colleges in the United States. In 2008, {{nearly half a million}} high schoolers and over 35,000 collegians played on their schools' {{baseball team}}s. The number of Americans participating in baseball has declined since the late 1980s, falling well behind the number of soccer participants. By early in the 20th century, intercollegiate baseball was Japan's leading sport. Today, high school baseball in particular is immensely popular there. The final rounds of the two annual tournaments—the National High School Baseball Invitational Tournament in the spring, and the even more important National High School Baseball Championship in the summer—are broadcast around the country. The tournaments are known, respectively, as Spring Koshien and Summer Koshien after the 55,000-capacity stadium where they are played. In Cuba, baseball is a mandatory part of the state system of physical education, which begins at <b>age</b> <b>six.</b> Talented children as young as seven are sent to special district schools for more intensive training—the first step on a ladder whose acme is the national baseball team.|$|E

5|$|At <b>age</b> <b>six,</b> Rainilaiarivony began {{two years}} of study {{at one of the}} new schools opened by the London Missionary Society (LMS) for the {{children}} of the noble class at the royal palace in Antananarivo. Ranavalona shut down the mission schools in 1836, but the boy continued to study privately with an older missionary student. When Rainilaiarivony reached age 11 or 12, the relatives who had raised him decided he was old enough to make his own way in the world. Beginning with the purchase and resale of a few bars of soap, the boy gradually grew his business and expanded into the more profitable resale of fabric. The young Rainilaiarivony's reputation for tenacity and industriousness, as he fought against his predestined misfortunes, eventually reached the palace, where at the age of 14 the boy was invited to meet Queen Ranavalona I. She was favorably impressed, awarding him the official ranking of Sixth Honor title of Officer of the Palace. At 16 he was promoted to Seventh Honor, then promoted twice again to Eighth and Ninth Honor at age 19, an unprecedented ascent through the ranks.|$|E
5|$|Higgins {{was born}} in Melbourne, Victoria, to Christopher Higgins, an English-Australian general practitioner, and Margaret (née Morrison), an Australian {{childcare}} centre operator. Her sister, Nicola, is seven years older, and brother, David, is six years older. She learned to play classical piano from <b>age</b> <b>six,</b> {{following in the footsteps}} of Christopher and David, but realised she wanted to be a singer at about 12 when she appeared in an Armadale Primary School production of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. Bored with practice, she gave up playing piano at that time. Hoping for more freedom, she urged her parents to send her to Geelong Grammar School, an independent boarding school attended by her siblings. At Geelong she took up the piano again, this time playing jazz including performing with her brother David's group on weekends. She was introverted and found that piano practice helped her cope with living at boarding school.|$|E
5|$|The arch gateway at {{the western}} end of the churchyard bears a skull and {{crossbones}} at the top of each pillar. The memorials in the churchyard are mainly dated 1750–1850, and most are lined against the churchyard's south wall or are flush with the ground. Some show fine carving, commensurate with commercial success. They include the memorials of French-born wine merchant Jean Gaudin and the Litherland brothers, founders of Royal Crown Derby. From 1804, French prisoners of war were quartered in Ashby, and those who died before their release, or who stayed and married local women, are also buried in the churchyard. A group of memorials are for members of a prosperous local family, the Mammatts. Edward Mammatt, church organist for 40 years and a successful scientist despite being blinded at <b>age</b> <b>six,</b> also has a monument in the church, and one of the Victorian windows is dedicated to his widow by their sons.|$|E
