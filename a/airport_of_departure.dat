40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to analyse the pricing policy adopted by Ryanair, the main {{low-cost}} carrier in Europe. The first part of the study reviews the results of literature addressing the subject of dynamic pricing, with specific reference to the air transport industry. The methodological section contains the models of reference for determining the optimal price and the demand function regarding the individual routes. The second part describes and analyses the data base that was used, giving price information relating to all Ryanair’s European flights from 1 st July 2005 to 30 th June 2006. In the empirical analysis section there is an estimation of the optimal pricing curve for each monitored route, by means of a family of hyperbolic curves as described in the literature. Subsequently, the parameters of the estimated price functions are connected with specific aspects relating to routes, competition, airports and served territories. The analysis shows that a positive correlation exists between the average price of each single route and its length, the frequency of flights operating on that specific route and the percentage of fully booked flights; greater the impact the carrier has on operations at the <b>airports</b> <b>of</b> <b>departure</b> and arrival, more negative is the correlation. With reference to the intensity of the dynamic pricing phenomena, the correlation to route length and frequency of flights is negative. Viceversa, greater the competition, higher are the discounts given on advance bookings, a variable which is not correlated to the level of average prices. Finally, the cost component relating to taxes and fares of the carrier is positively correlated to prices, to the degree of dynamic pricing activity and to the percentage of fully booked flights. To put it briefly, the study confirms the European low fare airline leader’s attention to the latent demand in the air transport industry and to the context in which it operates. air transport, low cost, pricing...|$|R
40|$|Based {{on field}} {{observations}} {{and interviews with}} controllers at BOS and EWR, we identify the closure <b>of</b> local <b>departure</b> fixes as the most severe class <b>of</b> <b>airport</b> <b>departure</b> restrictions. A set of simple queueing dynamics and traffic rules are developed to model departure traffic under such restrictions. The validity of the proposed model is tested via Monte Carlo simulation against 10 hours of actual operations data collected during a case-study at EWR on June 29, 2000. In general, the model successfully reproduces the aggregate departure congestion. An analysis of the average error over 40 simulation runs indicates that flow-rate restrictions also significantly impact departure traffic; work is underway to capture these effects. Several applications and what-if scenarios are discussed for future evaluation using the calibrated model...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – The {{efficient}} scheduling <b>of</b> <b>departure</b> runways {{is an important}} part of surface operations planning, with the goal of increasing the throughput <b>of</b> <b>airports.</b> <b>Departure</b> scheduling is a complex problem that needs to address the needs of diverse stakeholders including the airport operators, air traffic control and the airlines. The challenge lies in optimizing different ob-jective functions such as maximizing departure throughput, min-imizing average delay, and ensuring fairness among the airlines, while simultaneously enforcing wake-vortex separation minima, safely accommodating active runway crossings by arrival air-craft, and complying with downstream flow constraints imposed by the terminal airspace, in a dynamic and uncertain environ-ment. This paper presents a new class of techniques based on dynamic programming that can determine, in real-time, efficient departure schedules that satisfy the various upstream and down-stream constraints imposed on the departure runway system, thereby providing a valuable asset to departure management. ...|$|R

40|$|This article explores {{different}} meanings of mobility and place {{by examining the}} interweaving of people, things and airports in Guinea-Bissau and Portugal. Based on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in two <b>airports</b> – <b>of</b> <b>departure</b> and arrival <b>of</b> this migratory route – I look at the practices of sending and receiving objects by migrants in Lisbon and their kin in Bissau. The transnational yet grounded setting helps to provide {{a better understanding of}} the complexity associated with different forms of mobility – including corporeal, imagined and desired – and their key role in socially and relationally constructing a lived airport space, as well as wider social landscapes. Bringing in evidence from a less-explored setting – a small airport in a West African country – will particularly challenge some of the assumptions that tend to associate mobility with ‘modernity’ and fixity with ‘tradition’. It will show how people in Guinea-Bissau are, as much as migrants abroad, dynamically involved in global practices of movement – materialised in trading and reciprocating objects between two continents – through local performances of mobility that do not necessarily involve corporeal travel across borders...|$|R

We therefore propose an agent-based scheduling approach for solving the aircraft deicing problem where stakeholders are modelled as autonomous agents. Based on our view that multi-agent scheduling is scheduling combined with agent coordination, we propose a simple first come, first served heuristic combined with the concept of decommitment penalties. We demonstrate the feasibility of the approach through a series of experiments. ...|$|R

40|$|Increased {{air traffic}} demand {{over the past}} two decades has {{resulted}} in significant increases in surface congestion at major airports in the United States. The overall objective of this thesis is to mitigate the adverse effects <b>of</b> <b>airport</b> surface congestion, including increased taxi-out times, fuel burn, and emissions. The thesis tackles this objective in three steps: The first part deals with the analysis <b>of</b> <b>departure</b> operations and the characterization <b>of</b> <b>airport</b> capacity; the second part develops a new model <b>of</b> the <b>departure</b> process; and the third part of the thesis proposes and tests, both on the field and in simulations, algorithms for the control <b>of</b> the <b>departure</b> process. The characterization and estimation <b>of</b> <b>airport</b> capacity is essential for the successful management of congestion. This thesis proposes a new parametric method for estimating the <b>departure</b> capacity <b>of</b> a runway system, the most constrained element <b>of</b> most <b>airports.</b> The insights gained from the proposed technique are demonstrated through a case study of Boston Logan International Airport (BOS). Subsequently, the methodology is generalized to the study of interactions among the three main <b>airports</b> <b>of</b> the New York Metroplex, namely, John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK), Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) and LaGuardia Airport (LGA). The individual capacities <b>of</b> the three <b>airports</b> are estimated, dependencies between their operations are identified, and the capacity of the Metroplex as a whole is characterized. The thesis also identifies opportunities for improving the operational capacity of the Metroplex without significant redesign of the airspace. The proposed methodology is finally used to assess the relationship between route availability during convective weather and the capacity of LGA. The second part of the thesis develops a novel analytical model <b>of</b> the <b>departure</b> process. The modeling procedure includes the estimation of unimpeded taxi-out time distributions, and the development of a stochastic and dynamic queuing model <b>of</b> the <b>departure</b> runway(s), based on the transient analysis of D(t) =Ek(t) = 1 queuing systems. The parameters of the runway service process are estimated using operational data. Using the aircraft pushback schedule as input, the model predicts the expected runway schedule and the takeoff times. It also estimates the expected queuing delay and its variance for each light, along with the congestion level <b>of</b> the <b>airport,</b> sizes <b>of</b> the <b>departure</b> queues, and the departure throughput. The model is trained using data from EWR in 2011, and is subsequently used to predict taxi-out times at EWR in 2007 and 2010. The final part of this thesis proposes dynamic programming algorithms for controlling the departure process, given the current operating environment. These algorithms, called Pushback Rate Control protocols, predict the <b>departure</b> throughput <b>of</b> the <b>airport,</b> and recommend a rate at which to release pushbacks from the gate in order to control congestion. The thesis describes the design and field-testing of a variant of Pushback Rate Control at BOS in 2011, and the development of a decision-support tool for its implementation. The analysis shows that during 8 four-hour test periods, fuel use was reduced by an estimated 9 US tons (2, 650 US gallons), and taxi-out times were reduced by an average of 5. 3 min for the 144 flights that were held at the gate. The thesis concludes with simulations of the Pushback Rate Control protocol at Philadelphia International <b>Airport</b> (PHL), one <b>of</b> the most congested airports in the US, and a discussion of the potential benefits and implementation challenges. by Ioannis Simaiakis.

The aim of this research is to explore such heuristics and catalog their solution characteristics. A greedy approach as well as a k-interchange approach were developed to find improved takeoff sequences. When possible, the optimal solution was found to benchmark the performance of the heuristics, in general the heuristic solutions were within 10 - 15 % of the optimal solution.

Collegiate aviation institutions that are interested in upgrading their training aircraft fleets will need to design new curricula for aircraft with glass panel cockpits and this new training environment must accommodate adult learners from diverse backgrounds who have different learning styles. The {{purpose of this study is}} to identify which learning styles are best accommodated by scenario-based training (SBT) for the Garmin G 1000 avionics suite. The sample population included collegiate aviation flight students enrolled in a 4 -year baccalaureate program at a medium-sized state university.

Paired t-tests were performed using pilot performance assessment pretest-posttest scores within each learning style group to analyze any significance differences in performance, or in this case, learning. Next, the researcher conducted an ANOVA analysis to find significant differences in flight performance between learning style groups. Results suggested that there were no statistical differences within and between learning style groups regarding their learned behavior during the course of the semester.
