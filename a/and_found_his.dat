5|$|To escape racial discrimination, his {{children}} passed into white society: the four surviving sons married white spouses; his unmarried daughter {{lived with a}} brother. They worked as teachers, a lawyer, and business people. Smith's unique achievements as a pioneering African-American doctor were rediscovered by 20th-century historians. They were relearned by his descendants {{in the twenty-first century}} when a three-times-great-granddaughter took a history class <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>his</b> name in her grandmother's family bible. In 2010, several Smith descendants commissioned a new tombstone for his grave in Brooklyn. They gathered to honor him and their African-American ancestry.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 15, Henry—he {{was known}} by his middle name as a boy—was sent to Union College in Schenectady, New York. Admitted to the sophomore class, Seward was an {{outstanding}} student and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. Samuel Seward kept his son short on cash, and in December 1818—during the middle of Henry's final year at Union—the two quarreled about money. The younger Seward returned to Schenectady, but soon left school in company with a fellow student, Alvah Wilson. The two took a ship from New York to Georgia, where Wilson had been offered a job as rector, or principal, of a new academy in rural Putnam County. En route, Wilson {{took a job at}} another school, leaving Seward to continue on to Eatonton in Putnam County. The trustees interviewed the 17-year-old Seward, <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>his</b> qualifications acceptable.|$|E

5|$|In the morning, the {{supporting}} British armour {{was nowhere to}} be seen and the artillery and anti-tank units were unable to break through, leaving the two New Zealand brigades in position on the exposed ridge. Kippenberger inspected the brigade's position <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>his</b> battalions under fire from German tanks. Unable to contact nearby units by radio and realising the degree to which his men were exposed, he raced off under fire in a Bren carrier to locate the British armour. Coming across an armoured brigade four miles away, he implored its commander to bring his unit forward but was refused meaningful support until the intervention of Major General Herbert Lumsden, commander of the British 1st Armoured Division. By the time the tanks had arrived, the men of the 22nd Battalion had been largely killed or captured. The headquarters element of the 23rd Battalion were also prisoners of war. By nightfall, the 4th Brigade had been overrun. Kippenberger asked for and received permission to withdraw his brigade from the ridge. Although awarded a Bar to his DSO for his dash for help from the British, Kippenberger was bitter about the poor planning of the operation and admitted his own errors of judgement.|$|E
5|$|Murat and Kellermann {{immediately}} {{pounced on}} the supporting Liechtenstein Dragoons who were {{too slow to}} respond and routed them as well. The fleeing Austrian horsemen crashed {{into the ranks of}} Pilatti's rattled troopers and carried them away. As the mob of terrified cavalry stampeded past them, the exhausted Austrian infantry of the main body lost heart, provoking a wild rush to the rear. The gun teams fled, pursued by French cavalry, while their whole infantry line advanced westward. The second grenadier brigade under GM Karl Philippi von Weidenfeld and some unpanicked cavalry delayed Boudet’s advance long enough for O’Reilly’s cavalry to return, and together with Frimont, they mounted a last defense around Marengo village as night fell, allowing the Austrian centre to reach safety behind the Bormida. Ott with the Austrian left failed to intervene <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>his</b> retreat through Castel Ceriolo blocked by French troops advancing northwest from the centre, but managed to fight {{his way back to the}} Bormida bridgehead.|$|E
5|$|On March 8, 2011, former Alice in Chains bassist Mike Starr {{was found}} dead {{at his home in}} Salt Lake City. Police told Reuters they were called to Starr's home at 1:42pm <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>his</b> body; Starr was 44. Reports later {{surfaced}} that Starr's roommate had seen him mixing methadone and anxiety medication hours before he {{was found dead}}. Later reports indicated Starr's death may have been linked to two different types of antidepressants prescribed to him by his doctor. A public memorial was held for Starr at the Seattle Center's International Fountain on March 20, 2011. A private memorial was also held, which Jerry Cantrell and Sean Kinney attended according to Mike Inez.|$|E

5|$|The {{flagship}} of the Russian Pacific squadron, Bogatyr under Rear Admiral Andrey Alexandrovich Popov, officially made {{a friendly}} visit to Melbourne in early 1863. According to information {{passed on to}} Australian authorities in June 1864, Rear Admiral A.A. Popov had {{in the first half}} of the year 1863 received orders and a plan of attack on the British naval ships positioned near the Australian shore. The plan also included shelling and destruction of the Melbourne, Sydney and Hobart coastal batteries. The information was attributed to the Polish lieutenant Władysław Zbyszewski of the Bogatyr, who had deserted from service in Shanghai soon after Bogatyr left Australia, <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>his</b> way to Paris to join the Polish January Uprising. This information about Popov's plans was forwarded by a fellow Pole, a certain S. Rakowsky. Similar attack orders are known to have been given to the Atlantic squadron under Rear Admiral Lessovsky, that was sent to New York at the same time.|$|E
5|$|The Burnets {{moved to}} Terang in 1909, when Frank was posted {{to be the}} bank manager there, having {{declined}} a post in London. Burnet {{was interested in the}} wildlife around the nearby lake; he joined the Scouts in 1910 and enjoyed all outdoor activities. While living in Terang, he began to collect beetles and study biology. He read biology articles in the Chambers's Encyclopaedia, which introduced him to the work of Charles Darwin. During his early teens, the family took annual holidays to Port Fairy, where Burnet spent his time observing and recording the behaviour of the wildlife. He was educated at Terang State School and attended Sunday school at the local church, where the priest encouraged him to pursue scholastic studies and awarded him a book on ants as a reward for his academic performance. He advised Frank to invest in Mac's education and he won a full scholarship to board and study at Geelong College, one of Victoria's most exclusive private schools. Starting there in 1913, Burnet was the only boarder with a full scholarship. He did not enjoy his time there among the scions of the ruling upper class; while most of his peers were brash and sports-oriented, Burnet was bookish and not athletically inclined, <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>his</b> fellow students to be arrogant and boorish. During this period he kept his beetle-collecting and disapproval of his peers a secret and mixed with his schoolmates out of necessity. Nevertheless, his academic prowess gained him privileges, and he graduated in 1916, placing first in his school overall, and in history, English, chemistry and physics. The typical university path for a person of his social background was to pursue studies in theology, law or medicine. By this time, he was becoming disillusioned with religion and chose medicine. Due to World War I, military service was a possibility and he felt that a medical background would increase his chances of being given a non-combat post.|$|E
25|$|He {{struggled}} {{in the first}} two Tests against England, recording a 32-ball duck during the second match as Pakistan were bundled out for 72.

25|$|A genetic {{investigation}} into the remains of Rollo's grandson, Richard the Fearless, and his great-grandson, Richard the Good, was announced in 2011 {{with the intention of}} discerning the origins of the historic Viking leader. On February 29, 2016, Norwegian researchers opened Richard the Good's tomb <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>his</b> lower jaw with eight teeth in it. Unfortunately, the skeletal remains in both graves turned out to significantly predate Rollo and therefore are not related to him.|$|E

25|$|During a chili cook-off he was hosting at Vortex Spring in December, Kelly {{reportedly}} {{fell down}} the stairs and hurt his head. A person present took him to his home in Ponce de Leon, where he helped Kelly shower and, afterwards, put a blanket over him and left him to rest in the bathtub. In the morning, a different person came to the house, <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>his</b> condition had worsened overnight. Emergency medical services responded to a call and took him to a hospital in Pensacola.|$|E
25|$|In 1907, {{after serving}} five years’ {{probation}} for ordination as a minister, which he considered was long overdue, Domingo {{was sent to}} Loudon mission to prepare for ordination {{under the supervision of}} Donald Fraser. He had already demonstrated a degree of independence, <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>his</b> continued subordination to a European minister intolerable. After a public dispute with Fraser, he left his post in November 1908, travelled to the south of Nyasaland and received baptism from John Chilembwe, effectively ending any connection with what was now the United Free Church of Scotland.|$|E
25|$|Featherston serves in {{the series}} as an analog to Adolf Hitler. (In , Sgt. Adolf Hitler – never {{explicitly}} named but his identity confirmed by Turtledove - appears as an aide to Lt. Col. Guderian, and after hearing him rant about Jews, an American soldier notes how similar he is to Jake Featherston.) One reviewer, however, {{has pointed out that}} Featherston is not an exact parallel to Hitler <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>his</b> image, rhetoric, and propaganda techniques for the most part credibly adapted to the American South.|$|E

25|$|Waltrip {{was born}} on February 5, 1947 in Owensboro, Kentucky. Starting his driving career in Go-karts at age 12, Waltrip entered his first stock car race just four years later. Waltrip and his father built a 1936 Chevrolet coupe and headed to a local dirt track near their Owensboro home. The first night out was far from a success as the youngster, barely old enough to drive on the street, Waltrip slammed the wall and heavily damaged the coupe. Waltrip soon left the dirt <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>his</b> niche on asphalt where the {{smoothness}} he learned in the karts proved a valuable asset.|$|E
25|$|At 2 PM on May 11, 1883, Stone {{was working}} at his home on Euclid Avenue. He spoke several times with his {{business}} secretary, and was advised by his wife to rest. Stone then retired to his bedroom. At 4 PM, Julia Stone went {{to check on her}} husband, <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>his</b> bed empty and his bathroom door locked. She called for a butler, who climbed through the transom and found Stone dead. He had shot himself in the heart and then fallen forward so that his head and shoulders lay in the bathtub. A gun lay by his side.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} his life, Hummel saw {{the rise}} of a new school of young composers and virtuosi, <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>his</b> own music slowly going out of fashion. His disciplined and clean Clementi-style technique, and his {{balanced}} classicism, opposed him to the rising school of tempestuous bravura displayed by the likes of Liszt. Composing less and less, but still highly respected and admired, Hummel died peacefully in Weimar in 1837. A freemason (like Mozart), Hummel bequeathed a considerable portion of his famous garden behind his Weimar residence to his masonic lodge. His grave is in the Historical Cemetery, Weimar.|$|E
