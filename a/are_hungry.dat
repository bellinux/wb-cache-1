5|$|Bryant's career did not recover. She {{attempted}} to stage comebacks in Eureka Springs, Arkansas in 1992, Branson, Missouri in 1994 ("People {{who come to}} my performances <b>are</b> <b>hungry</b> for the truth. They thank me for reminding them {{of the importance of}} God and country."), and Pigeon Forge, Tennessee in 1997. However, at each venue her audiences dwindled and investors were non-existent. By 2002, Bryant and her second husband Charlie Dry had claimed bankruptcy in three states. As of 2006 Bryant was living in Oklahoma City.|$|E
5|$|Owing to {{the close}} {{similarity}} between play and hunting, cats prefer {{to play with}} objects that resemble prey, such as small furry toys that move rapidly, but rapidly lose interest (they become habituated) in a toy they have played with before. Cats also tend to play with toys more when they <b>are</b> <b>hungry.</b> String is often used as a toy, {{but if it is}} eaten, it can become caught {{at the base of the}} cat's tongue and then move into the intestines, a medical emergency which can cause serious illness, even death. Owing to the risks posed by cats eating string, it is sometimes replaced with a laser pointer's dot, which cats may chase.|$|E
5|$|Pelagic {{stingrays}} may segregate by sex, vertically in {{that males}} {{are found in}} deeper water than females, and perhaps horizontally as well. Captive individuals often act highly aggressively towards ocean sunfish (Mola mola), biting and harassing them, particularly if they <b>are</b> <b>hungry.</b> This species is preyed upon by oceanic whitetip sharks (Carcharhinus longimanus), great white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias), toothed whales, and other large, ocean-going carnivores. Its all-around dark coloration likely serves to camouflage it against its featureless habitat. The venom on its tail spine is also quite potent, causing it to be avoided by other fishes. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Acanthobothrium benedeni, A. crassicolle, and A. filicolle, Rhinebothrium baeri and R. palombii, and Tetragonocephalum uarnak, and the monogenean Entobdella diadema.|$|E

25|$|Binge eating {{disorder}} is an {{eating disorder}} characterized by frequent and recurrent binge eating episodes with associated negative psychological and social problems, but without subsequent purging episodes (e.g. vomiting). People who have this disorder can experience an uncontrollable urge to consume large amounts of food {{regardless of whether or}} not they <b>are</b> <b>hungry</b> and can feel like they have no control while they are eating.|$|E

25|$|In {{juvenile}} {{red deer}} (Cervus elaphus), the preorbital gland appears {{to play a}} role in the response to stress. The preorbital gland is closed in a relaxed calf, whereas it is opened in a stressed calf. One example of this is the signalling of hunger and satiety. Fawns open their preorbital glands as a signal that they <b>are</b> <b>hungry,</b> and close the gland after feeding, when they are no longer hungry.|$|E
25|$|These pheromones could {{directly}} communicate {{between the}} queen and her court or indirectly between her court and other workers due to the ingested pheromones. This is merely speculation, as no direct evidence has been collected to suggest the latter. V. mandarinia communicates acoustically, as well. When larvae <b>are</b> <b>hungry,</b> they scrape their mandibles against {{the walls of the}} cell. Furthermore, adult hornets click their mandibles as a warning to other creatures that encroach upon their territory.|$|E
25|$|The Socialist Party, however, {{refused to}} condemn the McNamara brothers, arguing that their actions were {{justified}} {{in view of the}} supposed employer- and state-sponsored terror their union had faced for the last 25 years. Haywood and Debs echoed that sentiment. Wrote Debs:It is easy enough for a gentleman of education and refinement to sit at his typewriter and point out the crimes of the workers. But let him be one of them himself, reared in hard poverty, denied education, thrown into the brute struggle for existence from childhood, oppressed, exploited, forced to strike, clubbed by the police, jailed while his family is evicted, and his wife and children <b>are</b> <b>hungry,</b> and he will hesitate {{to condemn the}}se as criminals who fight against the crimes of which they are the victims of such savage methods as have been forced upon them by their masters.|$|E

500|$|In 2012, New York artist Sophia Wallace {{started work}} on a {{multimedia}} project to challenge misconceptions about the clitoris. Based on O'Connell's 1998 research, Wallace's work emphasizes the sheer scope {{and size of the}} human clitoris. She says that ignorance of this still seems to be pervasive in modern society. [...] "It is a curious dilemma to observe the paradox that on the one hand the female body is the primary metaphor for sexuality, its use saturates advertising, art and the mainstream erotic imaginary," [...] she said. [...] "Yet, the clitoris, the true female sexual organ, is virtually invisible." [...] The project is called Cliteracy and it includes a [...] "clit rodeo", which is an interactive, climb-on model of a giant golden clitoris, including its inner parts, produced with the help of sculptor Kenneth Thomas. [...] "It's been a showstopper wherever it's been shown. People <b>are</b> <b>hungry</b> {{to be able to talk}} about this," [...] Wallace said. [...] "I love seeing men standing up for the clit [...] Not having access to the pleasure that is your birthright is a deeply political act." ...|$|E

[...] His grandfather represented Cambridge in the 1930s, and his uncle, Alexander Lindsay, rowed for the losing Oxford crew in the 1959 race before triumphing the following year. [...] Cambridge boat club president and Canadian international rower Brad Crombie was also making his third Boat Race appearance, attempting to complete a hat-trick of victories. [...] Sean Bowden was the head coach of Oxford. His Cambridge counterpart, Robin Williams, suggested [...] "it still feels like all or nothing to us. [...] The fear of defeat, the aim of trying to push the limits is motivation itself". [...] Just {{as he had done}} in the 1993 race, umpire Mark Evans introduced modifications to the starting procedure, suggesting that he would be content to hold the crews for up to ten seconds between issuing the [...] "set" [...] and [...] "go" [...] commands. [...] Cambridge's Williams remarked: [...] "I'm happy as long as both crews abide by it", Bowden was nonplussed [...] "Go is when you start races. [...] I'm happy." ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{a meeting}} of the Dakota, the U.S. {{government}} and local traders, the Dakota representatives asked the representative of the government traders, Andrew Jackson Myrick, to sell them food on credit. His response was said to be, [...] "So far as I am concerned, if they <b>are</b> <b>hungry</b> let them eat grass or their own dung." [...] But the context of Myrick's comment at the time, early August 1862, is historically unclear. Another version is that Myrick was referring to the Indian women who were already combing the floor of the fort's stables for any unprocessed oats to then feed to their starving children along with a little grass.|$|E

By November 2009, Little, Brown and Company had purchased the North American rights to the series. The series will have some overlap with his previous series, A Series of Unfortunate Events, but will not involve its protagonists, the Baudelaire orphans. Daniel Handler, the author behind the Snicket pen name, clarified that the series [...] "is mostly an entirely new story. But if you are a close reader of the series you will see some overlap. There will be something for people who <b>are</b> <b>hungry</b> for that sort of thing." [...] He reiterated: [...] "It does have some overlap with the series, but it's not a continuation." ...|$|E
