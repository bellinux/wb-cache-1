40|$|The {{effect of}} {{starvation}} and re-feeding was investigated on growth, hematology and biochemical parameters in juvenile Persian sturgeon (Acipenser persicus). Three hundred and seventy five fish (108 ± 0. 63 g) {{were divided into}} five feeding groups. The control group (C) was fed to satiation {{three times a day}} during the experiment. The four groups were starved for 1 (W 1), 2 (W 2), 3 (W 3), and 4 (W 4) weeks respectively, and then fed to satiation during a 4 week re-feeding period. The results indicated that some parameters including final weight, specific growth rate,body weight increase, plasma enzymes (ALT, Alanine aminotransferase, <b>AST,</b> <b>Aspartat</b> aminotransferase and ALP, Alkaline phosphatise, hematological parameters [Mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) ]were significantly affected by feeding regimes. The plasma cortisol, hematocrit, lymphocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, and monocytes were not affected by starvation and subsequent re-feeding. These findings showed that short term starvations had no significant negative effects on growth performance, most biochemical and hematological parameters in Persian sturgeon could recover when re-feeding resumed...|$|E
40|$|Liver {{is a real}} {{important}} organ to live, because liver becomes center of body metabolism. The damage of liver happened covers structural damage and also trouble function of liver. The laboratory test frequently applied to ascertain diagnosis and watch disease and therapy. Common liver function test is <b>AST</b> (<b>aspartat</b> trasnsaminase) and ALT (alanine transaminase) will show if happened damage or chafes at liver network. Mulberry (Morus alba) {{is one of a}} real useful fruit because it’s containing of anthocyanin is having the character as antioxidant and can protect liver cell. The purpose of this research is to know the influence of pigment mulberry (Morus alba) extract as antioxidant to rate SGOT and SGPT at white mouse (Rattus novergicus) what induceed acetaminophen. The type of this research is True Experimental that to planning applied that Completely randomized design (RAL) consists of 6 group of treatment that is: group of A (control negative), Group Of positive B (control), Group Of C (AF + 0, 10 mg/BB), Group Of D (AF + 0, 17 mg/BB), Group Of E (AF + 0, 24 mg/BB), Group Of F (AF + 0, 31 mg/ BB) with 4 times restating. This research done in Laboratorium Kimia Universitas Muhammadiyah Malang on 11 Decembers - 28 Decembers 2007.

40|$|The muscle quality traits (pH 1 and pH 24 and colour of M. longissimus dorsi), blood stress {{indicators}} (CPK – creatine phosphokinase, LDH – lactate dehidrogenase, <b>AST</b> – <b>aspartat</b> aminotransferase and glucose) {{and trimmed}} cut lean yield (proportion of selected lean meat of hams, loin, shoulders and neck) were evaluated for traditional Black Slavonian (BS) and modern pig genotypes: Large White × Swedish Landrace (LW×SL) and Large White × Swedish Landrace sired with Duroc (LW×SL) ×D {{used for the}} production of Slavonian Kulen sausages. The BS pigs had the lowest serum CPK and AST activity which indicates their lower suspectability to stress (P< 0. 05). The pH values were inside normal pork quality range for all evaluated genotypes but the older BS and (LW×SL) ×D pigs have more desirable loin colour (lower L * and higher a * values) for Slavonian Kulen processing. The trimmed cut lean yield (%) of hams was the lowest in BS pigs (29. 31 % of primal cut and 7. 04 % of carcass, P< 0. 05). The (LW×SL) ×D group had the highest trimmed cut lean yield of loin (34. 14 % and 4. 93 %, P< 0. 05) and the LW×SL group had the lowest utilization of neck (22. 31 % and 1. 12 %, P< 0. 05). For shoulders there were no statistically significant differences. In total, the utilization of primal cut...|$|R
40|$|Background: Radiation {{generates a}} variety of free {{radicals}} during the exposure of biological tissues through radiolysis of water. These free radicals are highly reactive and cause oxidative damage to biological molecules. The present study was carried out to investigate the synergestic effect of danazol and radiation exposure on certain functional disorders in female rats. Material and methods: Mature female rats weighing about 120 - 150 g were divided into four groups. Group 1 : control animals, group 2 : animals orally administrated with danazol at a daily dose of 1. 8 mg/ 100 g b. wt/day for four weeks., group 3 : animals exposed to whole body gamma irradiation (5 Gy), group 4 : animals orally administrated with danazol two weeks before and two weeks after irradiation. Results : Blood and liver samples were obtained two week post irradiation. Erythrocyte counts, haemoglobin concentration (Hb), hamatocrite percentage (Ht) and leucoyte counts (WBc,s) were determined in blood. Total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-c), low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-c), glucose as well as gamma glutamyle transferase (-GT), transmaminase <b>aspartat</b> (<b>AST),</b> alanine (ALT) and estradiol serum hormone level were assessed. Peroxidative hepatic damage was investigated by assessing thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) and total protein content in liver tissues. The data obtained revealed that exposure of rats to gamma radiation and / or danazol treatment or dual treatment caused {{a significant increase in}} ALT, AST, glucose, -GT, TC, TG, LDL-c and liver TABRS. While a significant decrease were recorded in RBc,s Hb, Wbc,s and HT. On the other hand, serum HDL, estradiol and liver total protein in group treated with danazol declined compared to control group. Conclusion: The results are of great importance from the stand point of radiation protection and drug safety...|$|R
40|$|This study {{describes}} {{an investigation of}} lead and cadmium pollution of Kosovo environment {{as a result of}} outflow from the coal processing industry. In a comparative study of lead and cadmium concentration in blood of human population of two different environments in Kosovo, one nearby Kosovo Thermo Power Plants, (Obiliq) a highly polluted environment and the other that is considered as relatively clean rural environment (Dragash). Analysis has shown that emission of particulate in fly ash from Thermo Power Plants during 2005 has exceeded EU standards by 400 - 500 % and that lead concentration was 18 mg kg - 1 and cadmium concentration was - 1 of ash. A series of determinations of lead and cadmium concentrations in blood of population that lives in this environment, have shown direct effects in biochemical parameters CRE (Creatinin), DB (Direct Bilirubine), TB (Total Bilirubine), <b>AST</b> (<b>Aspartat</b> Aminotransferaza), CK (Creatin Kinaza) and CHE (Cholenisteraza) in human organism. The results that were achieved in this study showed a significant difference in average lead and cadmium concentration in the blood of the investigated group of peoples that lives in the area near by the Power Plants, from a control group that lives in a rural unpolluted environment. Lead and cadmium has been analyzed in 50 samples taken from persons from industrial zone and 25 samples in controlled group. The level of lead concentration was 23. 0 - 112. 1 µg L - 1 in geometric average 46. 05 µg L - 1, cadmium concentration was 0. 44 - 6. 02 µg L - 1 in geometric average of 1. 56 µg L - 1. Controlled group from the rural relatively clean environment showed lead concentration of 6. 7 - 33. 8 µg L - 1 in geometric avarage 17. 76 µg L - 1 and cadmium concentration of 0. 21 - 1. 8 µg L - 1 or in geometric average of 0. 73 µg L - 1. In conclusion in exposed subjects, pollution from coal burning in Power Plant is very important factor for level of lead and cadmium concentration in blood of tested population...|$|E
