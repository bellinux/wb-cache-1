5|$|All of the wharves {{along the}} coast of Mississippi were {{reportedly}} ruined. In Mobile, Alabama, the storm uprooted trees and damaged several buildings, including a church. Tides rose several feet above normal, flooding low-lying streets such that fishermen were able to deliver their catches directly to market by boat. Some businesses sustained minor water damage, but overall, the city was spared <b>any</b> <b>significant</b> destruction, and received little impact on shipping. To the east, there were unconfirmed reports of significant damage to wharves and warehouses along the Florida Panhandle, but these accounts may have been exaggerated by rival companies.|$|E
5|$|Although the Kentucky Constitution {{prohibited}} governors {{from serving}} consecutive terms, Beckham {{announced he would}} seek a full term as governor in 1903. His candidacy was challenged in court, but the court ruled Beckham had not served a full first term and was eligible to run. Due to his record of reconciliation and supporting non-controversial reforms, he had no significant opposition in winning his party's nomination. His record also deprived his Republican opponent, Morris B. Belknap, of <b>any</b> <b>significant</b> campaign issue in the general election. Beckham defeated Belknap and three minor candidates.|$|E
5|$|As Julia never posed <b>any</b> <b>significant</b> {{threat to}} land, damage {{related to the}} storm was minimal. Trace amounts of rain {{reportedly}} fell across the Cape Verde islands, causing locally light flooding and minor inconveniences. Gusts battering the territory peaked at 30mph (48km/h), resulting in some wind damage to crops. In addition, these winds produced rough sea conditions, and high waves posed few threats along coastlines.|$|E
