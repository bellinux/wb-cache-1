To receive an award from a panel representing all the key football figures in the game, including the Professional Footballers' Association, the League Managers Association and the media is one of the highest accolades I have ever had.|$|E
500|$|Clive Russell, who portrayed Blackfish, {{spoke about}} working with Gwendoline Christie as Brienne of Tarth, noting [...] "There's {{something}} very curious, by the way, I'm probably about 6'6" [...] tall. I think she's about 6'3", but all the time I worked with her, I {{felt like she was}} taller than me. Now I don't really know what {{that has to do with}} it. It might be something to do with being confronted by a physically charismatic very tall woman, or maybe it's that she's caught the impressiveness of the character of that woman, that soldier. She's also an extraordinarily hilarious woman. We had great fun together. It was great fun to play." [...] Gwendoline Christie also spoke about filming with Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who portrays Jaime Lannister, again, saying [...] "I was excited, It was really fun to be with Nikolaj again, and I thought the way of which their reunion happens is not really expected. I just loved that it was so formal, because within the confines of such formality, and having to negotiate with each other, there <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> stories begging to be told in those moments. There's a slow process of creeping familiarity among two people who haven't been together for a long time; it was allowed to build." [...] Coster-Waldau also spoke about their first reunion scene, stating [...] "It's a great scene. These characters are so much about holding their cards so close to their chest and they don't want to reveal how they're feeling. But we know there's history between them, that this is more than two knights meeting. But they would never acknowledge that." ...|$|E

Madius said the party supports former de facto Law Minister Datuk Zaid Ibrahim's position that the ISA should only be used against those who posed a threat to national security, such as terrorists: [...] "Clearly {{in the case of}} Seputeh MP, Teresa Kok, Raja Petra Kamaruddin, and Sin Chew Daily reporter, Tan Hoon Cheng, there <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> public order laws that can be used against them if, at all, there is a case to do so." ...|$|E

60|$|Lightly and swiftly they skimmed {{over the}} ground, and I could {{not in the}} least {{understand}} how it was I kept up with them so easily.

60|$|Of theology, {{the middle}} class schoolboy gets rather less than poorer children, less {{absolutely}} and less relatively, because there <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> claims upon his attention.

60|$|When I hear of a {{young man}} sitting down by himself as the master of a household, without a wife, or even without a mother or sister to guide him, I always {{anticipate}} danger. If he does not go astray in any other way, he will probably mismanage his money matters. And then there <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> ways. A house, if it be not made pleasant by domestic pleasant things, must be made pleasant by pleasure. And a bachelor's pleasures in his own house are always dangerous. There is too much wine drunk at his dinner parties. His guests sit too long over their cards. The servants know that they want a mistress; and, in the absence of that mistress, the language of the household becomes loud and harsh--and sometimes improper. Young men among us seldom go quite straight in their course, unless they are, at any rate occasionally, brought under the influence of tea and small talk.|$|E
60|$|We {{know that}} self-fertilised {{seedlings}} are inferior {{in many respects}} to those from a cross; and as with plants {{in a state of}} nature pollen from the same flower can hardly fail to be often left by insects or by the wind on the stigma, it seems at first sight highly probable that self-sterility has been gradually acquired through natural selection in order to prevent self-fertilisation. It is no valid objection to this belief that the structure of some flowers, and the dichogamous condition of many others, suffice to prevent the pollen reaching the stigma of the same flower; for we should remember that with most species many flowers expand at the same time, and that pollen from the same plant is equally injurious or nearly so as that from the same flower. Nevertheless, the belief that self-sterility is a quality which has been gradually acquired for the special purpose of preventing self-fertilisation must, I believe, be rejected. In the first place, there is no close correspondence in degree between the sterility of the parent-plants when self-fertilised, {{and the extent to which}} their offspring suffer in vigour by this process; and some such correspondence might have been expected if self-sterility had been acquired on account of the injury caused by self-fertilisation. The fact of individuals of the same parentage differing greatly in their degree of self-sterility is likewise opposed to such a belief; unless, indeed, we suppose that certain individuals have been rendered self-sterile to favour intercrossing, whilst other individuals have been rendered self-fertile to ensure the propagation of the species. The fact of self-sterile individuals appearing only occasionally, as in the case of Lobelia, does not countenance this latter view. But the strongest argument against the belief that self-sterility has been acquired to prevent self-fertilisation, is the immediate and powerful effect of changed conditions in either causing or in removing self-sterility. We are not therefore justified in admitting that this peculiar state of the reproductive system has been gradually acquired through natural selection; but we must look at it as an incidental result, dependent on the conditions to which the plants have been subjected, like the ordinary sterility caused in the case of animals by confinement, and in the case of plants by too much manure, heat, etc. I do not, however, wish to maintain that self-sterility may not sometimes be of service to a plant in preventing self-fertilisation; but there <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> means by which this result might be prevented or rendered difficult, including as we shall see in the next chapter the prepotency of pollen from a distinct individual over a plant's own pollen, that self-sterility seems an almost superfluous acquirement for this purpose.|$|E
