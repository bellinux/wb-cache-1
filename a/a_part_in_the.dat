5|$|Although England trailed behind other European {{powers in}} {{establishing}} overseas colonies, {{it had been}} engaged during the 16th century in the settlement of Ireland with Protestants from England and Scotland, drawing on precedents {{dating back to the}} Norman invasion of Ireland in 1169. Several people who helped establish the Plantations of Ireland also played <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early colonisation of North America, particularly a group known as the West Country men.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the genetic}} {{strength}} of the desert-bred Arabian horse, Arabian bloodlines have played <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> development of nearly every modern light horse breed, including the Thoroughbred, Orlov Trotter, Morgan, American Saddlebred, American Quarter Horse, and Warmblood breeds such as the Trakehner. Arabian bloodlines have also influenced {{the development of the}} Welsh Pony, the Australian Stock Horse, Percheron draft horse, Appaloosa, and the Colorado Ranger Horse.|$|E
5|$|Cagney {{remained}} in retirement for 20 years, conjuring {{up images of}} Jack L. Warner every time he was tempted to return, which soon dispelled the notion. After he had turned down an offer to play Alfred Doolittle in My Fair Lady, he {{found it easier to}} rebuff others, including <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Godfather Part II. He made few public appearances, preferring to spend winters in Los Angeles, and summers either at his Martha's Vineyard farm or at Verney Farms in New York. When in New York, Billie Vernon and he held numerous parties at the Silver Horn restaurant, where they got to know Marge Zimmermann, the proprietress.|$|E

5|$|Casson {{set up a}} {{residential}} clinic for women with mental disorders at Dorset House in Bristol in 1929 with enough residential space for 800 patients, and she opened the first school of occupational therapy in the UK {{in the same building}} the following year.

5|$|Competition {{can play}} <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mating rituals of {{species such as}} burying beetles (Nicrophorus), the insects {{fighting}} to determine which can mate. Many male beetles are territorial and fiercely defend their territories from intruding males. In such species, the male often has horns on the head or thorax, making its body length {{greater than that of}} a female. Copulation is generally quick, but in some cases lasts for several hours. During copulation, sperm cells are transferred to the female to fertilize the egg.|$|E
5|$|During the War of 1812, Presque Isle played <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{victory over}} the British in the Battle of Lake Erie. Oliver Hazard Perry, {{commander}} of the American fleet, made strategic use of the bay {{as a place to}} construct six of the nine ships in his fleet. Using this location protected the men by creating an obstacle, forcing potential attackers to circumnavigate the peninsula to reach them.|$|E

5|$|Following a Viking raid in 994, a {{peace treaty}} was agreed {{with one of the}} raiders, Olaf Tryggvason. Besides {{receiving}} danegeld, Olaf converted to Christianity and undertook never to raid or fight the English again.

5|$|Freshwater {{habitats}} include rivers, streams, lakes, ponds, {{marshes and}} bogs. Although some organisms are found across {{most of these}} habitats, the majority have more specific requirements. The water velocity, its temperature and oxygen saturation are important factors, but in river systems, there are fast and slow sections, pools, bayous and backwaters which provide a range of habitats. Similarly, aquatic plants can be floating, semi-submerged, submerged or grow in permanently or temporarily saturated soils besides bodies of water. Marginal plants provide important habitat for both invertebrates and vertebrates, and submerged plants provide oxygenation of the water, absorb nutrients and play <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> reduction of pollution.|$|E
5|$|He was {{in great}} {{form for the}} Belgian spring classics, but a fall and {{material}} malfunction kept him from playing <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final of both the E3 Harelbeke and Gent–Wevelgem. Cancellara {{was one of the}} favourites to win the renewed Tour of Flanders but played no part in the final due to a crash in the feed zone. It was caused by a discarded water bottle. He suffered a four-part fracture of the right collarbone which ruined his spring campaign.|$|E

5|$|In 2015, Ben Serotta helped {{redesign}} {{the bicycle}} {{to include a}} new seat, a simpler gear shifting mechanism, fewer and brighter lights, and a European-style center kickstand. All of Citi Bike's bicycles were to be renovated to include this new design. However, in 2016, a thousand of the newly redesigned Citi Bikes were taken out of service due to <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> front wheel degrading faster than expected. In early 2017, {{as part of a}} pilot program with a firm named Blaze, 250 bikes received anterior laser lights that project a teal silhouette on the ground to warn drivers and pedestrians in their path.|$|E
5|$|In June 2004, Williamson {{was murdered}} in his {{apartment}} by an acquaintance, Dwight Hayden, whom he had been aiding with financial handouts. Police believed that Hayden's motive was robbery, although J-FLAG also suggested that homophobia may have played <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> killing. Hayden was subsequently {{sentenced to life in}} prison. Upon learning of the murder, a crowd assembled in New Kingston to celebrate Williamson's death, chanting homophobic slogans and lyrics. Conversely, the Jamaican LGBT community held a secret memorial for him, while protests against the killing were held by LGBT rights groups in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 9th century, Leo V reintroduced {{the policy of}} iconoclasm, but in 843 empress Theodora {{restored}} the veneration of icons {{with the help of}} Patriarch Methodios. Iconoclasm played <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> further alienation of East from West, which worsened during the so-called Photian schism, when Pope Nicholas I challenged the elevation of Photios to the patriarchate.|$|E

5|$|Intellectually, Scott {{and figures}} like Thomas Carlyle played <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{development}} of historiography {{and the idea}} of the historical imagination. Romanticism also influenced science, particularly the life sciences, geology, optics and astronomy, giving Scotland a prominence in these areas that continued into the late nineteenth century. Scottish philosophy was dominated by Scottish Common Sense Realism, which shared some characteristics with Romanticism and was a major influence on the development of Transcendentalism. Scott also played a major part in defining Scottish and British politics, helping to create a romanticised view of Scotland and the Highlands that fundamentally changed Scottish national identity.|$|E
5|$|Keynsham played <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Civil War as the Roundheads {{saved the}} town and also camped there for the night, using the pub {{now known as the}} Lock Keeper Inn as a guard post. During the Monmouth Rebellion of 1685 the town was the site of a battle between royalist forces and the rebel Duke of Monmouth. Bridges Almshouses were built around 1685 and may have been for the widows of those killed in the rebellion.|$|E
5|$|Kisnorbo scored {{his first}} goal for Leeds against Millwall {{on his return}} to the {{starting}} lineup after missing the previous game against Norwich City having picked up an illness on international duty. His international call-ups along with other internationals at Leeds resulted in games against Swindon Town and Bristol Rovers being postponed. Kisnorbo missed the games against Kettering Town, Oldham Athletic and local rivals Huddersfield Town through an injury he picked up in training. He had not recovered from injury {{to be able to have}} <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> squad in the FA Cup replay to Kettering. Instead, the Australia international returned to the Leeds starting line up against Brentford.|$|E
