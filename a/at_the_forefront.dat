Roundtable {{discussion}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>forefronts</b> in portion size conference HA Raynor As portion size has increased in the United States, greater concern has arisen regarding the positive relationship between portion size and consumption, and how this relationship may negatively impact weight management. This article is a summary of a roundtable discussion from <b>the</b> <b>Forefronts</b> in Portion Size Conference held in Philadelphia, PA, USA in May 2013. The roundtable included four discussants, five speakers who had presented research on various components of portion size <b>at</b> <b>the</b> conference, two organizers and the moderator. Topics discussed included methods to reduce portion size that can assist with reducing energy intake, societal norms about portion size, values associated with portion size and methods to promote smaller portion sizes.

50|$|The Chase {{family is}} an American family {{involved}} in politics in the 19th century. Originating in Chesham, England, brothers Aquila Chase II and Thomas Chase journeyed to New England in 1636, shortly after the Pilgrims.

Lawyers such as Scott Lord (whose mother was a Chase) and Salmon Portland Chase, Chief Justice of the United States, were produced. Chase politicians included Dudley Chase, Champion S. Chase, Dudley Chase Denison, and Margaret Chase Smith.
