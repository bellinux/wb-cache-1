500|$|Tom Laskin of Isthmus {{wrote that}} the {{significant}} [...] "sonic tweaking and abundant sampling" [...] of Version 2.0 is discarded as the songs are supported primarily by [...] "bass, drum, and guitar configurations".

[...] He added that, overall, the album is [...] "far less commercially accommodating {{than any of the}} band's previous work. It embraces no particular sound or style. It comes across with ideas and commentary that challenge rather than coerce, and the playing lacks the burnished, artificial quality that's characteristic of so much youth-oriented music these days." [...] Peter Robinson of the NME {{wrote that the}} album was a [...] "departure from the sound Garbage had established on their first two records"; It is [...] "marked by expanding on the musical variety, with stronger melodies, more direct lyrics, and sounds that mix rock with hip hop, electronica, new wave, and girl groups." [...] Sound on Sound described the band's approach to recording guitars as [...] "distinctive", observing the [...] "distorted crunches cheek-by-jowl with delicate acoustics and treated sounds which are almost unrecognizable."

[...] Before the season finale aired, Jensen ranked this as the second best moment {{of the season and}} put the scene in which the monster attacks the mercenaries in ninth place. [...] Dan Kois and Lane Brown of New York magazine thought that this [...] "episode didn't exactly feel like the usual moderately paced, secret-revealing drama Lost usually is; it felt like an action movie... it was like watching Die Hard on an island". [...] Chris Carabott of IGN gave the episode a 9.3/10, concluding that [...] "if 'The Shape of Things to Come' is any indication of the level of quality that [...] should expect from here on out then we <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> some incredible storytelling" [...] and [...] "Alex's death will probably be remembered as one of the more pivotal scenes in the entire series [...] it is such a phenomenally shot, edited and acted moment... it would be incredibly hard not to feel for [...] here." [...] Upon grading the best episodes of the first five seasons, the episode ranked second, beating episodes like [...] "Through the Looking Glass" [...] and the pilot and losing to [...] "The Constant." [...] Erin Martell of AOL's TV Squad summed up [...] "The Shape of Things to Come" [...] as [...] "a brilliant episode... tons of action, several big revelations, and more questions to ponder". [...] Don Williams of BuddyTV decided that the episode was [...] "worth waiting five weeks for" [...] and [...] "so jam packed that I need to give my brain time to rest". [...] Williams's colleague Oscar Dahl ranked the scene in which Alex is killed as the fifth best moment of the season, noting that [...] "it was perfectly paced... and provided a huge shock... and some of the best acting you'll ever see". [...] Jay Glatfelter of The Huffington Post wrote that [...] "'The Shape of Things to Come' was the perfect episode to get everyone back into the swing of Lost. [...] It wasn't a [...] à la 'The Constant'. [...] It was an edge-of-your-seat thrill ride, which to me matched the 'Pilot' bombastic grandeur".|$|E

The lead brigade under Fulkerson was repulsed, so Jackson decided to move around the Union right flank, about 2 miles west on Sandy Ridge, which appeared to be unoccupied. If this were successful, his men could move down {{the spine of the}} ridge and get into the Union rear, blocking their escape route to Winchester. Kimball countered the maneuver by moving his brigade under Col. Erastus B. Tyler to the west, but Fulkerson's men reached a stone wall facing a clearing on the ridge before the Union men could.

2500|$|Terpening’s second thriller, League of Shadows (2005), was a {{contemporary}} novel of intrigue with an extensive back story {{that takes place}} in Italy during the Fascist Era. The historical scenes depict the efforts of three spies in 1943 to infiltrate Italian leader Benito Mussolini’s secret police, the OVRA. Decades after that intrigue went horribly wrong, an unknown enemy begins to hunt down the former secret agents, and their one hope for survival is an ex-cop obsessed with his mission. The Midwest Book Review called the novel “an addictive read, weaving together human drive, determination, and betrayal into a gripping whole”, while Lucille Cormier, in The Historical Novels Review, said that “You can race through this suspense thriller riding the whirlwind of drug busts, jungle guerrilla attacks, gun fights, assassinations, and love affairs right into the breathtaking climax. Or, if you are disciplined enough, you can turn each page slowly and savor the extraordinary visual and historical detail Ron Terpening has painted into his complex story. Either way, you <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> a treat.

If 'Inner Child' is any indication, we <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> a very satisfying and engaging journey for the rest of the season." [...] Alan Sepinwall's review in The Star-Ledger was overall positive, [...] "As far as the episode as a whole goes, I thought it was fairly solid procedural hour of 'Fringe.' No, it didn't follow up on any of the revelations from 'Ability,' but it also didn't feature any of Agent Harris, and both the serial killer case and Olivia's rapport with the kid were compelling enough that I can wait on the mythology stuff for later." [...] Jane Boursaw at TV Squad rated the episode very highly in her recap, and also mooted a theory about the Child, [...] "My theory is that the boy is another Observer. They certainly looked a lot alike, didn't they? Could the boy have come from another dimension and ended up beneath the building? And why did the CIA guy say that they'd found 'another one.'"

2500|$|At {{the time}} of release, {{professional}} reviews were overall mixed. Record Mirror stated: [...] "Assuming that the title {{should be taken to}} mean that the group are trying to visit the territorial war grounds of their golden years in the singles charts I reckon they <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> a shock. I expect a little more than references to Big Brother, Stereo, Radio etc, in the otherwise catchy [...] "Sign of the Times" [...] and the reflection of [...] "Born to Run" [...] in [...] "Wheels Ain't Coming Down". On [...] "Nuts Bolts & Screws" [...] and [...] "My Baby's Got It" [...] Slade start to rock, but there's nothing here to distinguish them from any other rocking combo. I wasn't expecting another [...] "Cum On Feel the Noize" [...] or [...] "My Friend Stan" [...] but just something a little more inspired. From a new band this would be a fairly good debut, from Slade I want more." [...] Sounds were similar in their reception, writing: [...] "Slade have managed to pull a fair to impressive performance out of the bag with this one. Sure to new wave lugs it sounds dated, but Return to Base still rocks like a good un', utilising standard rock 'n' roll/hard rock foundations for commendable displays of tightness and old time rock bite. Noddy's got one of the all time classic rock voices as he belts through ten steamy originals and one Chuck Berry cover. Slade may have stood still, but their own brand of rock shout clout still sounds good to these biased ears." ...|$|E
2500|$|The San Francisco Chronicles Peter Hartlaub {{gave the}} film a {{negative}} review. He said, [...] "It doesn't go much of anywhere until the infuriating last 10 minutes, {{when everything is}} sort of tied together while still producing more unanswered questions. The movie seems at times to be told in random order, often with flashbacks, and {{the closest thing to}} a plot is a weak story about the father who keeps confronting the people responsible for his son's drunken-driving death". He pointed out the lack of realism in the script, saying [...] "One incredibly large and intricate torture device in this movie couldn't have been made without four or five subcontractors, but we're supposed to believe a mentally unbalanced ex-junkie who weighs 100 pounds put it together in, at most, a few months". Michael Ordoña of the Los Angeles Times said that [...] "More gore is really all Saw III has to offer", saying that [...] "the first few minutes cram in more graphic brutality than you can shake a bloody, pointed stick at". He listed other problems being [...] "flat dialogue, uninvolving characters and a creeping sameness in the no-brain- required puzzles". He concluded his review saying, [...] "Bottom line, those in the Saw factory know their audience and have brought along the appropriate buckets and bibs. Even devotees, however, may note pacing problems and tire of Jigsaw's selective omnipotence (he can acquire copious amounts of deadly nerve agent but not a bottle of Ativan?). Those who see Saw III <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> ups and downs".|$|E
2500|$|Alex Lai of Contactmusic {{likewise}} noted that, [...] "Those who {{are familiar}} with the earlier work of NFG <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> a shock. Beginning in more relaxed fashion than expected, [...] "Oxygen" [...] is a grand love ballad, serious in tone but retaining the group's ability to produce a catchy hook. Far from being a one-off experiment, these are actually the characteristics to the album and like Blink-182 before going on hiatus, New Found Glory have allowed their music to mature." [...] Jack Foley of Indie London, gave the album four stars out of five and described it as [...] "utterly engaging". While mentioning standout tracks, he added, [...] "The low-key [...] "Make Your Move" [...] drops some beautifully cascading riffs, while, the chiming piano chords that open [...] "It’s Not Your Fault" [...] give way into an effortlessly inspiring song." [...] People magazine declared that Coming Home is [...] "their best album yet", while Dan Aquilante of The New York Post awarded a score of three stars out of four and wrote that the album is [...] "a smart, stylistic mix rich in vocal harmonies, it's driven by guitar and piano breaks. The notion of getting back to family, friends and better days connects the 13 tracks." [...] British rock publication Kerrang! awarded the album a [...] "great" [...] four K! rating. Rae Alexandra opined that Coming Home [...] "displays a new level of sensitivity and subtlety; a new take on harmonies and melodies." [...] He noted that while the album isn't as immediate as previous material, it will [...] "move you far more deeply in the long run. It's hopeful; learned; masterfully executed. It's everything New Found Glory have been leading to all this time; and it's everything we never knew they had in them. Absolutely stunning." [...] Florida-based newspaper, The Palm Beach Post were also highly favorable and graded the album as an [...] "A-". They wrote, [...] "It's all written in beautifully vulnerable, snarkless, shout-it-out-loud terms, with an unself-conscious joy in the lyrics, the do-do-dos and the muted hand claps that find a sweet, genuine current of emotion without sacrificing edge. Pundik's delivery is never cloying, ironic or dumb. Underscored by drummer Cyrus Bolooki's strong beat, the songs are like a pre-made mix tape about {{the ups and downs of}} making yourself honestly vulnerable to another human being. Bravo." [...] Rock Sound journalist Tim Newbound rated the album at nine out of ten and particularly praised the band's progression. Writing that, [...] "New Found Glory have come of age. Their punchy punk-pop styling of old may have temporarily waned, but their knack of writing inducing melodies amid sincere delivery has only intensified. Pundik's nasal-edged vocals have now blossomed into a fuller pitch, perfectly complimenting his band's more tuneful and matured musicianship. Top notch." ...|$|E
