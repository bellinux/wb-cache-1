25|$|From the mid-1990s, {{the major}} focus of the campus turned to dryland agriculture, natural {{resource}} management and <b>animal</b> <b>production.</b> The campus is also now home to South Australia's first pre-service Veterinary Science training program, which commenced in purpose-built facilities in 2010. In 2013, the focus on veterinary science was expanded {{with the opening of}} the Equine Health and Performance Centre, a state-of-the-art facility for equine surgery, sports medicine, internal medicine and reproduction.|$|E
25|$|Animals {{that feed}} on grain or rely on grazing require more water than grain crops. Producing 1kg of meat {{requires}} up to 15,000 liters of water. According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), growing crops for farm animals requires {{nearly half of}} the US water supply and 80% of its agricultural land. Animals raised for food in the US consume 90% of the soy crop, 80% of the corn crop, and 70% of its grain. However, where an extensive farming system (as opposed to a feedlot) is used, some water and nutrients are returned to the soil to provide a benefit to the pasture. This cycling and processing of water and nutrients is less prevalent in most plant production systems, so may bring the efficiency rate of <b>animal</b> <b>production</b> closer to the efficiency of plant based agricultural systems. In tracking food <b>animal</b> <b>production</b> from the feed through to the dinner table, the inefficiencies of meat, milk, and egg production range from a 4:1 energy input to protein output ratio up to 54:1. The result is that producing animal-based food is typically much less efficient than the harvesting of grains, vegetables, legumes, seeds, and fruits.|$|E
25|$|The {{state has}} {{invested}} in aerospace, education, health care, banking, and various heavy industries, including automobile manufacturing, mineral extraction, steel production and fabrication. By 2006, crop and <b>animal</b> <b>production</b> in Alabama was valued at $1.5 billion. In contrast to the primarily agricultural economy of the previous century, this was only about 1% of the state's gross domestic product. The number of private farms has declined at a steady rate since the 1960s, as land has been sold to developers, timber companies, and large farming conglomerates.|$|E

50|$|<b>Animal</b> <b>productions</b> are {{integrated}} with crop productions. Moreover, livestock such as cattle are primarily fed on pastures, crop residues, and fallows. An integrated farming system aims to achieve acceptable profits and high and sustained production levels. Mixed farming systems {{are the largest}} category of livestock system in the world.|$|R
25|$|The United States Bureau of Labor Statistics {{collects}} no {{figures for}} cowboys, so {{the exact number}} of working cowboys is unknown. Cowboys are included in the 2003 category, Support activities for <b>animal</b> <b>production,</b> which totals 9,730 workers averaging $19,340 per annum. In addition to cowboys working on ranches, in stockyards, and as staff or competitors at rodeos, the category includes farmhands working with other types of livestock (sheep, goats, hogs, chickens, etc.). Of those 9,730 workers, 3,290 are listed in the subcategory of Spectator sports which includes rodeos, circuses, and theaters needing livestock handlers.|$|E
25|$|The {{environmental}} impacts of <b>animal</b> <b>production</b> vary with the method of production. A grazing-based production can limit soil erosion and also allow farmers to control pest problems with less pesticides through rotating crops with grass. However, in arid areas, this may catalyze a desertification process. The ability of soil to absorb water by infiltration is important for minimizing runoff and soil erosion. Researchers in Iowa reported that a soil under perennial pasture grasses grazed by livestock was able to absorb far more water than {{the same kind of}} soil under two annual crops: corn and soybeans. Corn and soybean crops commonly provide food for human consumption, biofuels, livestock feed, or some combination of these.|$|E
25|$|The Faculty of Veterinary Medicine was {{established}} at JUST in 1990 {{as a response}} to the national objective of improving animal health and productivity by increasing their efficiency and thereby reducing the cost of <b>animal</b> <b>production.</b> It is the only Faculty of Veterinary Medicine in Jordan. It also houses a Veterinary Health Center (VHC), which serves the purpose of clinical training for students and provides veterinary services to the public. The faculty is a research and a consultative center, in addition to its basic function in promoting and sustaining high standards of undergraduate and postgraduate programs. The faculty is an active member of the Arab Association of Veterinary Medical Faculties and it houses its office.|$|E

25|$|Agriculture {{has been}} and {{continues}} as Willow Bunch’s largest industry, with spring wheat, durum, oats, barley, and flax seeing the most consistent production over the last 30 years, since 1982. Among these top five crops, the most productive year over the past 70 was in 1993 when 71.5 bushels per acre of oats were produced. These numbers are gathered from the rural municipality of Willow Bunch, RM 42, an area spanning 1,047.8 square kilometres. As of the 2011 Canadian census, there were 102 farms in the Willow Bunch area, operated {{by a total of}} 125 farmers. The average age of farm operators in the area is 53.4, while the average farmer's age overall in Saskatchewan is 54.2. In the area, there are 16 <b>animal</b> <b>production</b> farms and 86 crop production farms.|$|E
25|$|Pets have a {{considerable}} environmental impact, especially {{in countries where}} they are common or held in high densities. For instance, the 163 million dogs and cats kept in the United States consume about 20% {{of the amount of}} dietary energy that humans do and an estimated 33% of the animal-derived energy. They produce about 30% ± 13%, by mass, as much feces as Americans, and through their diet, constitute about 25–30% of the environmental impacts from <b>animal</b> <b>production</b> in terms of the use of land, water, fossil fuel, phosphate, and biocides. Dog and cat animal product consumption is responsible for release of up to 64 ± 16 million tons CO2-equivalent methane and nitrous oxide, two powerful greenhouse gasses. Americans are the largest pet owners in the world, but pet ownership in the US has considerable environmental costs.|$|E
25|$|Willow Bunch's {{agriculture}} {{generates the}} most profit from grain yields; {{as a result}} there is much less emphasis on livestock. Surveys from the 1930s show high poultry production, and moderate production of horses, cattle, sheep and swine. Sheep production saw a major drop from 1931 to 1936 and never rose again. The 1950s continued these pre-existing trends with low sheep production, high cattle production, and very high poultry production. The trend has since continued unabated, with far more land dedicated to crops than pasture fields. A 2011 census shows no farms dedicated to animals other than beef cattle ranches and animal combination farms. Furthermore, there are no farms dedicated to general apiculture. The small presence of livestock is characteristic of the farming division, however. While areas like Old Post, Waverly and Excel have many farms dedicated to cattle ranching/farming, these municipalities have few other farms dedicated to <b>animal</b> <b>production.</b>|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} {{influences}} {{on the creation of}} agricultural policy, including consumers, agribusiness, trade lobbies and other groups. Agribusiness interests hold a large amount of influence over policy making, in the form of lobbying and campaign contributions. Political action groups, including those interested in environmental issues and labor unions, also provide influence, as do lobbying organizations representing individual agricultural commodities. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) leads international efforts to defeat hunger and provides a forum for the negotiation of global agricultural regulations and agreements. Dr. Samuel Jutzi, director of FAO's <b>animal</b> <b>production</b> and health division, states that lobbying by large corporations has stopped reforms that would improve human health and the environment. For example, proposals in 2010 for a voluntary code of conduct for the livestock industry that would have provided incentives for improving standards for health, and environmental regulations, such as the number of animals an area of land can support without long-term damage, were successfully defeated due to large food company pressure.|$|E
25|$|Outlying campuses {{cater to}} a range of {{research}} activities including crops research, animal reproduction, public health and watershed management. The Colorado Agricultural Experiment Station (CAES) was established in 1888 in accordance with provisions of the Hatch Act of 1887, calling for experiment stations at land-grant universities. State and federal funds support CAES research programs. In 2007, research activities included pest management, food safety and nutrition, environmental quality, plant and <b>animal</b> <b>production</b> systems, and community and rural development. The NSF Engineering Research Center for Extreme Ultra Violet Science and Technology, funded by the National Science Foundation, partners industry with Colorado State University, CU-Boulder, and the University of California-Berkeley.

500|$|With {{approval}} from the committee, Belshaw asked McClymont in July 1953 to prepare a paper further explaining his ideas {{on the topic of}} educational curricula related to farm <b>animal</b> <b>production.</b> [...] McClymont's paper, submitted on 8 September 1953, was titled, [...] "Planning Rural Science and Possible Curriculum". [...] In the paper, McClymont further expounded his views and, as the title indicated, suggested that a better name for the prospective faculty would be [...] "rural science." [...] In February 1954, Robert Madgwick, vice-chancellor of the newly independent university, reviewed McClymont's paper. [...] Convinced by McClymont's reasoning, Madgwick recommended to the university council the establishment of a faculty of rural science. [...] On 16 October 1954 the University of New England offered McClymont the position of Chair of the soon-to-be established Department of Rural Science.|$|E
500|$|McClymont's work {{experiences}} {{caused him}} to feel disastified {{with the quality of}} education he had received in his degree program at Sydney. [...] He felt the veterinary science specialization was too narrow, especially in the area of animal husbandry and livestock production.

[...] For example, as an undergraduate, he received only three lectures on statistics, a skill he had to teach himself during his first few years as an animal nutritionist advisor. [...] As a result, he took an interest in education and curriculum development. [...] McClymont later said that he had [...] "seen the educational deficiencies of narrow specialization, whether of veterinary graduates as specialists in animal health and disease or of agricultural science graduates as specialists in aspects of soil and plants.
