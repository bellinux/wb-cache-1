40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} whether the placement of a SmartSite <b>antireflux</b> <b>valve</b> between a bag of fluid with line giving set and an intravenous cannula decreases the flow rate. Fluid flow rates were compared in paired experiments with and without an <b>antireflux</b> <b>valve</b> using a pressure infuser or allowing fluid to flow by gravity only for four different sizes of intravenous cannulas (20 - 14 G). Antireflux valves significantly decreased the fluid flow rates for all cannula sizes, irrespective of whether a pressure infuser was used. The decrease in the flow rate was most marked for larger cannulas [gravity only: 14 G: 52 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) : 37 - 68), 16 G: 39 % (95 % CI: 34 - 43); pressure bag: 14 G: 74 % (95 % CI: 70 - 78), 16 G: 56 % (95 % CI: 54 - 57); all P< 0. 001]. Where maximum fluid flow rates are desirable, clinicians should consider not using an <b>antireflux</b> <b>valve.</b> Griffith Health, School of MedicineNo Full Tex...|$|E

Very little has been written in recent surgical literature about permanent feeding gastrostomies. Dissatisfaction with the conventional Stamm and Witzel gastrostomies prompted the authors to devise an improved method that creates a stapler-constructed, proximally based, antral gastric tube with an <b>antireflux</b> <b>valve</b> made by imbricating the gastric wall {{around the base of the}} gastric tube.

40|$|Intragastric {{pressure}} measurements and cineradiographic contrast studies {{were done in}} monkeys {{in order to determine}} the pressure at which esophageal reflux occurred. Antireflux operative procedures were performed above and below the diaphragm, and the results compared. The Nissen fundoplication proved to be the most effective type of mechanical <b>antireflux</b> <b>valve</b> and worked equally well placed above and below the diaphragm. Of 200 consecutive adult patients undergoing operative correction of esophageal reflux, 19 had severe esophageal strictures. Through a transthoracic approach, two patients had subdiaphragmatic Nissen fundoplications, one with adenocarcinoma of the esophagus had an esophageal resection, and 16 had supradiaphragmatic Nissen fundoplications; those 16 patients form the basis of this report. No patients died; superficial, temporary esophageal ulcerations developed in two. Follow-up times have ranged from six months to eight years; the results in all cases have been good. Experimental and clinical evidence supports the belief that this less radical approach is the treatment of choice in the management of severe esophageal strictures secondary to reflux esophagitis...|$|E

40|$|The present {{research}} {{was aimed at}} defining the surgical anatomy of the biliopancreatic ducts and of Oddi's sphincter. The numerous anatomic variations of the papilla, the millimetric distribution of its muscle fibres, and any morphological detail of clinical significance have been investigated. An integrated analysis of radiographic, tridimensional (casts), and histologic findings {{has been carried out}} in 49 of 64 autoptic bilio-duodenopancreatic specimens. Exact limits of the choledocus and Wirsung sphincters were defined. A consistent accumulation of circular muscle fibres could be seen, on the choledocus duct side, up to a mean distance of 13. 6 mm from the papillary pore. However, more rarefied fibres were present up to 20. 5 mm. Muscle fibres were seen to stop roughly on the pancreatic duct side at 7. 3 mm from the papillary pore. The beginning of the sphincter was observed 2 - 3 mm above the papillary pore. There was no evidence suggesting the presence of upper, middle, and lower biliary sphincters. Five anatomic diversities of the Wirsung-choledocus confluence were found. The Y type was the most frequent (61. 2 %), followed by the U type (22. 4 %), V (14. 3 %), and II (2. 1 %). Santorini's duct with a normal papilla was present in 16 per cent of the cases. These data along with other interesting observations on <b>antireflux</b> mechanisms (Santorini's <b>valves)</b> and on the ductal space orientation appear to be useful guidelines for a physiopathological understanding of bilio-pancreatic diseases and for any therapeutic procedure on these structures...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBiliary {{drainage}} in malignant biliary obstruction improves patient {{survival and}} quality of life. Although bypass surgery was historically the main method of treating malignant biliary obstruction, stent insertion using endoscopy or interventional radiology is currently recognized as the first-line of treatment. Biliary stents have undergone various modifications in terms of material and structure, {{with the aim of}} increasing stent patency. One such modification is the antitumor-agent-eluting stent, which is intended to suppress tumor ingrowth through chemical changes in the membrane. Another modified stent is the antireflux stent, which physically prevents the reflux of food by using an <b>antireflux</b> <b>valve.</b> Although the safety of these modified stents has been demonstrated in both animal and human studies, their efficacy, compared with conventional stents, remains unknown. Although the development of these functional stents is challenging, their potential is promising. Effort is necessary to increase stent patency, which requires much modification and development, to prolong patient survival...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} complications and owner impressions of a low profile gastrostomy device (LPGD) for enteral feeding in dogs. Medical records of dogs that had placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube followed by a LPGD between 1995 and 2003 were reviewed. Fifteen dogs had 29 devices placed for a variety of disease states in which enteral nutritional support was indicated. The individual tubes were placed for a median duration of 212 d. Most complications occurred more than 15 d after placement and were of no health risk to the animals. The most common reason for LPGD replacement was leakage through the 1 -way <b>antireflux</b> <b>valve.</b> Fourteen of 15 owners that were contacted were supportive of the device. Based on its durability, ease of placement, minor complications, and positive owner impressions, we conclude that the LPGD is a valuable device for long-term enteral nutritional support of dogs...|$|E
40|$|The use of stents for esophageal strictures {{has evolved}} rapidly {{over the past}} 10 years, from rigid plastic tubes to {{flexible}} self-expanding metal (SEMS), plastic (SEPS) and biodegradable stents. For the palliative treatment of malignant dysphagia both SEMS and SEPS effectively provide a rapid relief of dysphagia. SEMS are preferred over SEPS, as randomized controlled trials have shown more technical difficulties and late migration with plastic stents. Despite specific characteristics of recently developed stents, recurrent dysphagia due to food impaction, tumoral and nontumoral tissue overgrowth, or stent migration, remain a major challenge. The efficacy of stents with an <b>antireflux</b> <b>valve</b> for patients with distal esophageal cancer varies between different stent designs. Concurrent treatment with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy seems {{to be safe and}} effective. In the future, it can be expected that removable stents will be used as a bridge to surgery to maintain luminal patency during neoadjuvant treatment. For benign strictures, new stent designs, such as fully covered SEMS and biodegradable stents, may potentially reduce complications during stent removal...|$|E
40|$|Gastrostomy {{has been}} {{increasingly}} indicated for daily feeding ofneurologically impaired children with swallowing abnormalitiesthat hinder {{the use of}} the mouth. Therefore, the enteral route hasstill been used by means of oral, nasogastric or nasojejunal tube. However it is no longer the preferential method, mainly in cases ofprolonged use. Today gastrostomy is the most often utilizedprocedure, particularly Stamm gastrostomy. Many of thesepatients present pulmonary abnormalities due to a possiblegastroesophageal reflux (GER). After the study by Jolley et al. (1), in 1985, fundoplication has become a systematic and routinecomplement to gastrostomy. The neurologically impaired patientshave been submitted to two surgeries, leading to possible andpredictable increase in morbidity and mortality rates. Althougheffective when properly indicated, this simple management hasrecently been very much debated and rejected. Thus, an updatingbased on recent studies is necessary to make pediatric surgeonsand pediatricians aware of other manners to solve this problem,which aim at correctly feeding these children with impairedswallowing and GER and helping them have a better quality of life. The literature reviewed was searched in PubMed/Medline, fromJanuary 1994 to May 2003. Other articles read and mentioned inthis review and published before 1994 were collected based onarticles cited in the references. Thus, we could assess thechronological progression in management of neurologicallyimpaired children who need gastrostomy for their feeding, andcarry out an analysis of current fundoplication and the questionwhether the use of a prophylactic <b>antireflux</b> <b>valve</b> is compulsoryor not...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Introduction Hydronephrosis, reflux and {{renal failure}} are serious {{complications}} {{that occur in}} patients with neurogenic bladder associated with myelomeningocele. When the bladder compliance is lost, {{it is imperative to}} carry out surgery aimed at reducing bladder storage pressure. An ileocystoplasty, and for patients not suitable for intermittent catheterization, using the Mitrofanoff principle to form a continent stoma and the subsequent closure of the bladder neck, can be used. We report here, {{for the first time to}} the best of our knowledge, an association between two previously described techniques (the Mitrofanoff principle and the technique of Monti), that can solve the problem of a short appendix in obese patients. Case presentation A 33 -year-old male Caucasian patient with myelomeningocele and neurogenic bladder developed low bladder compliance (4. 0 mL/cm H 2 O) while still maintaining normal renal function. A bladder augmentation (ileocystoplasty) with continent derivation principle (Mitrofanoff) was performed. During surgery, we found that the patient's appendix was too short and was insufficient to reach the skin. We decided to make an association between the Mitrofanoff conduit and the ileal technique of Monti, through which we performed an anastomosis of the distal stump of the appendix to the bladder (with an <b>antireflux</b> <b>valve).</b> Later, the proximal stump of the appendix was anastomosed to an ileal segment of 2. 0 cm that was open longitudinally and reconfigured transversally (Monti technique), modeled by a 12 -Fr urethral catheter, and finally, the distal stump was sutured at the patient's navel. After the procedure, a suprapubic cystostomy (22 Fr) and a Foley catheter (10 Fr) through the continent conduit were left in place. The patient had recovered well and was discharged on the tenth day after surgery. He remained with the Foley catheter (through the conduit) for 21 days and cystostomy for 30 days. Six months after surgery he was continent with good bladder compliance without reflux and fully adapted to catheterization through the navel. Conclusion The unpublished association between the Mitrofanoff and Monti techniques is feasible and a very useful alternative in urologic cases of derivation continent in which the ileocecal appendix is too short to reach the skin (i. e., in obese patients) ...|$|E
