5|$|Douglas {{was up for}} {{re-election}} in 1858, and Lincoln hoped to defeat the powerful Illinois Democrat. With the former Democrat Trumbull now serving as a Republican Senator, many in the party felt that a former Whig should be nominated in 1858, and Lincoln's 1856 campaigning <b>and</b> <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> support Trumbull in 1854 had earned him favor in the party. Some eastern Republicans favored the reelection of Douglas for the Senate in 1858, since he had led {{the opposition to the}} Lecompton Constitution, which would have admitted Kansas as a slave state. But many Illinois Republicans resented this eastern interference. For the first time, Illinois Republicans held a convention to agree upon a Senate candidate, and Lincoln won the party's Senate nomination with little opposition.|$|E
5|$|Entering {{his fifth}} {{season with the}} Predators, Weber {{continued}} his stellar record. At the February Olympic break, Weber accumulated 35 points in 59 games for the Predators. He also established a strong leadership role <b>and</b> <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> defend his teammates, highlighted by three consecutive games in March 2010 in which he fought opposing players. Weber's offensive production slowed after the Olympic break and he finished the season with 43 points in 78 games played. Despite a decrease in offence from the previous season, Weber was a Norris Trophy candidate {{for the third consecutive}} year, receiving a single first place vote and 96 voting points to finish as the sixth runner-up behind winner Duncan Keith (1,096 points). Weber also received a single fifth-place vote, tying for 23rd with six other players in Hart Memorial Trophy voting, and was the seventh-ranked defenceman in NHL All-Star Team voting with 83 voting points.|$|E
5|$|Fingleton {{enlisted in}} the {{military}} during World War II and was eventually sent to work on media matters for Prime Minister John Curtin {{and one of his}} predecessors, Billy Hughes. After the war, Fingleton worked as a political correspondent in Canberra and commentated on cricket during the summer months in Australia and England. He was a prolific author, {{regarded as one of the}} finest and most stylish cricket writers of his time, producing many books. Fingleton was known for his forthright opinions <b>and</b> <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> criticise, and his cricket reports were published by newspapers in several countries. He was known for his ongoing feud with Bradman—the pair repeatedly spoke out against one another's judgement and play on the field long after they retired.|$|E

A survey was conducted to 209 respondents that have boughtMalaysian products {{in the past three}} months and lived in Jabodetabek (Jakarta, Bogor, Depok, and Bekasi) area. The result shows that ethnocentrism mediated the relationship between animosity <b>and</b> consumers’ <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> purchase; while it does not work as a mediator in the relationship betweenallocentrism <b>and</b> consumers’ <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> purchase. In addition, product quality comparison does not moderate the relationship between animosity <b>and</b> consumers’ <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> purchase as well as ethnocentrism <b>and</b> consumers’ <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> purchase.

5|$|Most Catholic clergy in Buenos Aires willingly backed Rosas' regime. The Jesuits, {{the only}} ones who refused to do so, were {{expelled}} from the country. The lower social strata in Buenos Aires, which formed the vast majority of its populace, experienced no improvement in the conditions under which they lived. When Rosas slashed expenditures, he cut resources from education, social services, general welfare and public works. None of the lands confiscated from Indians and Unitarians were turned over to rural workers, including gauchos. Black people did not experience any improvement in their conditions either. Rosas was himself a slave-owner, and helped revive the slave trade. Despite doing little to promote their interests, he remained popular among blacks and gauchos. He employed blacks, patronized their festivities and attended their candombles. The gauchos admired his leadership <b>and</b> <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> fraternize with them to some extent.|$|E
5|$|Scattered evidence, {{including}} the records in Irish annals {{and the images}} of warriors like those depicted on the Pictish stone slabs at Aberlemno, Forfarshire and Hilton of Cadboll in Easter Ross, suggest that in Northern Britain, as in Anglo-Saxon England, society was dominated by a military aristocracy, whose status was dependent in a large part on their ability <b>and</b> <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> fight. Below {{the level of the}} aristocracy it is assumed that there were non-noble freemen, working their own small farms or holding lands as free tenants. There are no surviving law codes from Scotland in this period, but codes in Ireland and Wales indicate that freemen had the right to bear arms, represent themselves in law and to receive compensation for murdered kinsmen.|$|E
5|$|The NMP {{scheme was}} not {{introduced}} without controversy, which may {{lead one to}} question {{the effectiveness of the}} scheme in strengthening representative democracy. Despite the protests of many PAP MPs, the party whip was enforced to effect the passing of this scheme. Criticism of the scheme mainly revolved around the dilution of the democratic legitimacy of the Parliament since the electorate has no say in choosing the NMP based on his or her merits. Further, there may be doubts as to the NMP's commitment <b>and</b> <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> serve as an MP, since the NMP bypasses the electoral process. The scheme has also given rise to allegations that it serves as another platform for the PAP to undercut support for the opposition.|$|E

5|$|The Percheron is a {{breed of}} draft horse that {{originated}} in the Huisne river valley in western France, part of the former Perche province from which the breed takes its name. Usually gray or black in color, Percherons are well muscled, and known for their intelligence <b>and</b> <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> work. Although their exact origins are unknown, the ancestors of the breed {{were present in the}} valley by the 17th century. They were originally bred for use as war horses. Over time, they began to be used for pulling stagecoaches and later for agriculture and hauling heavy goods. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Arabian blood was added to the breed. Exports of Percherons from France to the United States and other countries rose exponentially in the late 19th century, and the first purely Percheron stud book was created in France in 1883.|$|E
5|$|The breed {{is popular}} for {{recreational}} and competitive driving, {{to which it}} is well suited in temperament. In 1997, the rules of driving events in France were modified {{to take into account the}} speed of execution of the course, which made lighter, faster horses more competitive. The Norman Cob and the lighter type of Boulonnais were particularly affected. The Norman Cob's gaits, calm temperament <b>and</b> <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> master technical movements make it an excellent competitor, and in 2011, more than a third of the horses represented in the French driving championships were Norman Cobs. Many Norman Cobs represent France in driving events at the international level.|$|E
5|$|The second {{cross is}} tall and slender, a free {{standing}} monolith pillar-cross, with a slender rounded shaft (changing to square above) and a free armed head formed by notching the shaft. It is carved with figures in traditional Welsh style. One figure in particular, which looks much like {{the figure of a}} saint, is inscribed low on the north face. The Cross of St Padarn is granophyre and has Celtic interlace in panels down one face. It is uncertainly dated between the ninth and eleventh century. Though not comparable with the great Irish high crosses, it shows sophisticated carving, <b>and</b> <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> bring the stone from the Mawdddach estuary, Gwynedd.|$|E

5|$|The {{suppression}} of the Whiskey Rebellion met with widespread popular approval. This {{was the first time}} the new government had been directly opposed, and through a clear show of federal authority, Washington established the principle that federal law is the supreme law of the land, and demonstrated that the federal government had both the ability <b>and</b> <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> suppress violent resistance to the nation's laws. The government's response to the rebellion was, therefore, viewed by the Washington administration as a success, a view that has generally been endorsed by historians. This also was one of only two times in U.S. history that an incumbent president has personally commanded the military in the field; James Madison would command an army in 1814.|$|E
5|$|This was {{the last}} European war of the old style, in which armies maneuvered sedately at a {{distance}} while diplomats hustled between capitals to resolve their Majesties' differences. Given the length of time—six months—the cost in life and treasure was high. In light of the scale of warfare experienced in Europe less than a generation later in the French Revolutionary Wars and Napoleonic Wars, though, this six-month engagement seems mild. Yet while historians often dismissed it {{as the last of}} the archaic mode of Ancien Régime warfare, elements of the war foreshadowed conflicts to come: the sheer sizes of the armies deployed reflected emerging abilities <b>and</b> <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> conscript, train, equip and field larger armies than had been done in previous generations.|$|E

Oates' players praised his positive outlook <b>and</b> <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> work closely with them as a primary reasons why the team was able to turn its season around. The Capitals were defeated {{in the first round}} of the 2013 Stanley Cup playoffs, however, losing to the New York Rangers in seven games.|$|E

5|$|A 2013 {{study by}} Joseph E. Peterson and colleagues {{identified}} lesions in skulls of Stegoceras and other pachycephalosaurs, which were interpreted as infections caused by trauma. Lesions {{were found on}} 22% of sampled pachycephalosaur skulls (a frequency consistent across genera), but were absent from flat-headed specimens (which have been interpreted as juveniles or females), {{which is consistent with}} use in intra-specific combat (for territory or mates). The distribution of lesions in these animals tended to concentrate {{at the top of the}} dome, which supports head-butting behaviour. Flank-butting would probably result in fewer injuries, which would instead be concentrated on the sides of the dome. These observations were made while comparing the lesions with those on the skulls and flanks of modern sheep skeletons. The researchers noted that modern head-butting animals use their weapons for both combat and display, and that pachycephalosaurs could therefore also have used their domes for both. Displaying a weapon <b>and</b> <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> use it can be enough to settle disputes in some animals.|$|E
5|$|In particular, after 1849, Wagner resented Meyerbeer's {{continuing}} {{success at}} a time when his own vision of German opera had little chance of prospering. After the May Uprising in Dresden of 1849, Wagner was for some years a political refugee facing a prison sentence or worse should he return to Saxony. During his period of living in exile he had few sources of income and little opportunity of getting his own works performed. The success of Le prophète sent Wagner over the edge, and he was also deeply envious of Meyerbeer's wealth. In reaction he published, under a pseudonym, his 1850 essay 'Jewishness in Music'. Without specifically naming Meyerbeer, he interpreted the popular success of the latter as the undermining of German music by alleged Jewish venality <b>and</b> <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> cater to the lowest tastes, and attributed the supposed poor quality of such 'Jewish music' to Jewish speech and song patterns, which 'though the cultured son of Jewry takes untold pains to strip them off, nevertheless they shew an impertinent obstinacy in cleaving to him'.|$|E
5|$|One {{reason for}} the mission's success was that it worked by example. Also {{important}} was Gregory's flexibility <b>and</b> <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> allow the missionaries to adjust their liturgies and behaviour. Another reason was the willingness of Æthelberht to be baptised by a non-Frank. The king would have been wary of allowing the Frankish bishop Liudhard to convert him, as that might open Kent up to Frankish claims of overlordship. But being converted by {{an agent of the}} distant Roman pontiff was not only safer, it allowed the added prestige of accepting baptism from the central source of the Latin Church. As the Roman Church was considered part of the Roman Empire in Constantinople, this also would gain Æthelberht acknowledgement from the emperor. Other historians have attributed the success of the mission to the substantial resources Gregory invested in its success; he sent over forty missionaries in the first group, with more joining them later, a quite significant number.|$|E

5|$|The Phantom brings Christine {{back down}} to his lair. Madame Giry shows Raoul where the Phantom lives, and he goes to rescue Christine. The Phantom forces Christine to don the wedding dress and once again professes his love, and orders Christine to marry him. Christine tries to {{convince}} the Phantom {{that she does not}} fear his ugliness, but rather his anger <b>and</b> <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> kill to get what he wants. Just then, Raoul enters the lair, and the Phantom ties him to a gate and threatens to kill him if Christine refuses to marry him. Christine reflects over the impossible choice before passionately kissing the Phantom to show him he is not alone in the world. The Phantom is shocked from experiencing real human love {{for the first time in}} his life. Ashamed of his murderous actions, he allows Christine and Raoul to leave and orders them to never return. He finds comfort in a little monkey music box. Christine approaches the Phantom, who tells her that he loves her, and she silently gives him the diamond ring from her finger to remember her by. After Christine and Raoul leave, the Phantom smashes every mirror in his underground lair and disappears through a secret passage behind a velvet curtain just before the police arrive. Upon entering, Meg finds only the Phantom's white mask.|$|E
5|$|While Totti was a {{prolific}} goalscorer, {{he was also}} renowned for his ball control, vision, creativity, and range of passing, {{as well as his}} ability to set the pace in midfield and provide through-balls and assists for his teammates, often through his trademark use of the no-look pass or backheel, in particular when holding up the ball or playing with his back to goal. Throughout his career, Totti drew particular praise from pundits for his excellent vision, technique, and precise long passing ability, which allowed him to play the ball first-time. Due to his movement and wide range of skills, his role has at times been described as that of a hardworking, generous, quick and dynamic centre forward, known as a centravanti di manovra in Italian. Known for his work rate, longevity, <b>and</b> <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> contribute defensively, Totti underwent an athletic development during his time under Zeman: he undertook a muscle-strengthening programme to adapt to the rhythms of 21st-century football, gaining physical strength, stamina, fitness and shooting power to the detriment of some of his speed and agility, which also enabled him to maintain a consistent level of performance in his later career.|$|E
