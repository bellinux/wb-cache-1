2500|$|If a Diophantine {{equation}} has as an <b>additional</b> <b>variable</b> or variables occurring as exponents, {{it is an}} exponential Diophantine equation. Examples {{include the}} Ramanujan–Nagell equation, , and the equation of the Fermat-Catalan conjecture and Beal's conjecture, [...] with inequality restrictions on the exponents. A general theory for such equations is not available; particular cases such as Catalan's conjecture have been tackled. However, the majority are solved via ad hoc methods such as Størmer's theorem or even trial and error.|$|E
2500|$|... “Blazars” (BL Lac {{objects and}} OVV quasars) classes are {{distinguished}} by rapidly variable, polarized optical, radio and X-ray emission. BL Lac objects show no optical emission lines, broad or narrow, {{so that their}} redshifts can only be determined from features in the spectra of their host galaxies. The emission-line features may be intrinsically absent or simply swamped by the <b>additional</b> <b>variable</b> component. In the latter case, emission lines may become visible when the variable component is at a low level. OVV quasars behave more like standard radio-loud quasars {{with the addition of}} a rapidly variable component. In both classes of source, the variable emission is believed to originate in a relativistic jet oriented close to the line of sight. Relativistic effects amplify both the luminosity of the jet and the amplitude of variability.|$|E

However, the main criticism is that <b>additional</b> <b>variables</b> are not able to go much beyond the original dimensions [64]. It is also important to mention that <b>additional</b> <b>variables</b> might cause model over-fitting rather than representing a refined model.|$|R

To solve this problem, we propose to substitute the coefficients of the linear regression by the coefficient of the PLS regression in the Prefmap method. The graph obtained is made operational thanks to contour lines of quality of representation and it becomes richer than the Prefmap one.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{considers}} in {{a somewhat}} general setting when a combinatorial optimization problem can be formulated as an (all-integer) integer programming (IP) problem. The main result is that any combinatorial optimization problem can be formulated as an IP problem if its feasible region S is finite {{but there are many}} rather sample problems that have no IP formulation if their S is infinite. The approach used for finite S usually gives a formulation with {{a relatively small number of}} <b>additional</b> <b>variables</b> for example, an integer polynomial of n 0 − 1 variables requires at most n + 1 <b>additional</b> <b>variables</b> by our approach, whereas 2 n - (n + 1) <b>additional</b> <b>variables</b> at maximum are required by other existing methods. Finally, the decision problem of deciding whether an arbitrarily given combinatorial optimization problem has an IP formulation is considered and it is shown by an argument closely related to Hilbert's tenth problem (drophantine equations) that no such algorithm exists...|$|R
