5|$|Some sexually {{transmitted}} diseases are communicable between women, including human papillomavirus (HPV)—specifically genital warts—squamous intraepithelial lesions, trichomoniasis, syphilis, and herpes simplex virus (HSV). Transmission of specific {{sexually transmitted}} diseases <b>among</b> <b>women</b> {{who have sex with}} women depends on the sexual practices women engage in. Any object that comes in contact with cervical secretions, vaginal mucosa, or menstrual blood, including fingers or penetrative objects may transmit {{sexually transmitted diseases}}.

40|$|Summary We have {{examined}} the relation of lactation, by total duration, with breast cancer risk <b>among</b> preand post-menopausal <b>women.</b> In a hospital-based case-control study conducted in Athens (1989 - 91), involving 820 patients with confirmed breast cancer and 795 orthopaedic patient controls and 753 hospital visitor controls, logistic regression was used to analyse the data controlling for demographic, nutritional and reproductive factors, including parity and age at any birth. <b>Among</b> post-menopausal <b>women,</b> there was no association between breastfeeding and breast cancer risk, but <b>among</b> premenopausal <b>women</b> those who had breastfed for>e 24 months had an odds ratio of 0. 50 (95 % confidence interval 0. 23 - 1. 41). A reduction of the odds ratio was also evident <b>among</b> premenopausal <b>women</b> who had breastfed between 12 and 23 months (odds ratio 0. 70; 95 % confidence interval 0. 34 - 1. 60).
