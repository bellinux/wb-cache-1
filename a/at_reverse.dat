Gaga urged fans to [...] "please take these down as much as possible" [...] and {{provided}} {{instructions on how to}} report information regarding the unauthorized distribution of her song to her label's parent company, Universal Music Group. In response, fans reported websites seen distributing or linking to the snippets of the single, with nearly 2,500 individuals sending a singular link to Universal's takedown page. However, despite such efforts, a leak was eminent. So Gaga released the song a week early onto various radio stations across America. The single was made available in most countries just before midnight (EST) on the iTunes Store, coupled with a pre-order of Artpop.

25|$|Flumazenil is very {{effective}} <b>at</b> <b>reversing</b> the CNS depression associated with benzodiazepines but is less effective <b>at</b> <b>reversing</b> respiratory depression. One {{study found that}} only 10% of the patient population presenting with a benzodiazepine overdose are suitable candidates for flumazenil. In this select population who are naive to and overdose solely on a benzodiazepine, it can be considered. Due to its short half life, the duration of action of flumazenil is usually less than 1 hour, and multiple doses may be needed. When flumazenil is indicated the risks can be reduced or avoided by slow dose titration of flumazenil. Due to risks and its many contraindications, flumazenil should be administered only after discussion with a medical toxicologist.|$|R

As a result, Rino Rappuoli and other scientists turned towards bioinformatics to design a functional vaccine.|$|E

The QD-EAM is a p-i-n ridge waveguide structure with intrinsic layer thickness of 0.4 μm, width of 10 μm, and length of 1.0 mm. Photocurrent measurement reveals a Stark shift of ~ 5 meV (~ 7 nm) <b>at</b> <b>reverse</b> bias of 3 V (75 kV/cm) and broadening of the resonance peak due to field ionization of electrons and holes was observed for E-field larger than 25 kV/cm. Investigation at wavelength range of 1, 300 – 1320 nm reveals that the largest absorption change occurs at 1317 nm. Optical transmission measurement at this wavelength shows insertion loss of ~ 8 dB, and extinction ratio of ~ 5 dB <b>at</b> <b>reverse</b> bias of 5 V.
