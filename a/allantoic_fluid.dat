40|$|Because of the {{peculiar}} {{properties of the}} psittacosis-lymphogranuloma group of viruses, the pattern of multiplication in the allantois of the chick embryo {{of one of their}} number, meningopneumonitis virus, was studied. This was done by determination of the changes in its infectivity for mice and chick embryos. Titration of infectivity in embryos proved to be a more sensitive procedure than titration in mice; the latter procedure however, had the advantage of greater simplicity and gave more clear-cut results. The mouse titration method was used in most of the experiments. Following inoculation of virus into the allantois, there was a slow decrease in infectivity in the <b>allantoic</b> <b>fluids</b> followed by an increase due to appearance of new virus between 24 and 48 hours. The slope of declining infectivity in the <b>allantoic</b> <b>fluids</b> in ovo was similar if not identical with the slope of decreasing infectivity in <b>allantoic</b> <b>fluids</b> in vitro caused by thermal degradation of virus. Multiplication of the virus in allantoic membranes was characterized by the following pattern: (a) Increase in infectivity in the first few hours (exact duration of increase depended on concentration of virus in inoculum) due to adsorption of virus. (b) Decrease in infectivity up to about 20 to 24 hours. (c) Increase in infectivity due to appearance of the new generation of virus.

40|$|We {{recently}} reported an unusual abundance of arginine (4 – 6 mM) in porcine <b>allantoic</b> <b>fluid</b> during early gestation. How-ever, {{it is not}} known whether such high concentrations of ar-ginine are unique for porcine <b>allantoic</b> <b>fluid</b> or whether they represent an important physiological phenomenon for mam-mals. The present study was conducted to test the hypothesis that arginine is also the most abundant amino acid in ovine al-lantoic fluid. Allantoic and amniotic fluids, as well as fetal and maternal plasma samples, were obtained from ewes between Days 30 and 140 of gestation. Glycine was the most abundant amino acid in maternal uterine arterial plasma, representing ap-proximately 25 % of total a-amino acids. Alanine, glutamine, glycine, plus serine contributed approximately 50 % of total a-amino acids in fetal plasma. Fetal:maternal plasma ratios for amino acids varied greatly, being less than 1 for glutamate dur-ing late gestation, 1. 5 – 3 for most amino acids throughout ges-tation, and greater than 10 for serine during late gestation. Marked changes were observed in amino acid concentrations in amniotic and allantoic fluids associated with conceptus devel-opment. Concentrations of alanine, citrulline, and glutamine in <b>allantoic</b> <b>fluid</b> increased by 20 -, 34 -, and 18 -fold, respectively, between Days 30 and 60 of gestation and were 24. 7, 9. 7, and 23. 5 mM, respectively, on Day 60 of gestation (compared with 0. 8 mM arginine). Remarkably, alanine, citrulline, plus gluta-mine accounted for approximately 80 % of total a-amino acids in <b>allantoic</b> <b>fluid</b> during early gestation.

The {{changes in}} {{concentration}} of oestrone, oestradiol (- 17 =a and- 17 =b, oestrone sulphate and the oestradiol sulphates have been measured in allantoic and amniotic fluids and in maternal peripheral plasma throughout gestation.

It was measurable in <b>allantoic</b> <b>fluid</b> before Day 52 and reached a peak concentration of 475 ng/ml around Day 133. A lower peak occurred in the amniotic fluid around Day 110.

It grows to high titer {{in the eyes}} and brains of intracerebrally inoculated mice in which it induces cataract, uveitis, and chronic brain infection. SMCA in high titer may also be recovered from the tissues of embryonated hen eggs in which the infection is lethal within 4 to 9 days. Fine-structural studies of ultrathin sections of pellets obtained by ultracentrifugation of SMCA-infected egg <b>allantoic</b> <b>fluids</b> have revealed pleomorphic structures with morphological characteristics typical of mycoplasma.

40|$|Equal {{mixtures}} of influenza A (PR 8) and B (Lee) viruses, based on predetermined ID 50 {{values of the}} individual preparations, were titrated in closely spaced steps near the 50 per cent infectivity end-point. Typing of the hemagglutinins found in the <b>allantoic</b> <b>fluids</b> after incubation of the eggs for 72 hours showed an approximately equal distribution between types A and B, when less than 2 ID 50 of the mixed seed had been injected.

"Negative" fluids obtained from embryos injected with as little as one-eighth of an ID 50 upon passage yielded on occasion virus of one or the other type. Similar closely spaced titrations near the 50 per cent end-point of single strains (PR 8) indicated that if hemagglutinins were found after incubation of 72 hours they were of high titer, as a rule.

However, the data indicate that in infectivity titrations the ID 50 end-point obtained at 72 hours, or even after 96 hours, does not reflect the total amount of virus present in the material titrated. The data also denote that separation of variants, or mutants or "genetic recombinants" by the limiting dilution technic, although possible, does not represent an absolutely safe procedure...|$|R
40|$|The deposit or {{precipitate}} formed after storage at - 20 °C of <b>allantoic</b> <b>fluids</b> {{infected with}} influenza virus contains {{a considerable amount}} of the virus. It has been found that by treatment of this material, after thawing, with sodium chloride and subsequent purification of the treated fluid, all the virus originally present can be recovered, thus ensuring against loss of virus and irregular titration results. The authors describe in detail the method developed, which should prove useful in large-scale production of influenza vaccine when the material has to be stored in the deep-freeze for some time...|$|R
40|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{studying}} incubation periods of infectious diseases, observations were made with experimental infections of embryonated eggs with Newcastle Disease Virus and the growth curve of virus, interrelation {{between the amount of}} inoculated virus and the lengths of incubation periods were examined. 1) The growth curves of NDV in both <b>allantoic</b> and amniotic <b>fluids</b> of inoculated eggs are most adequately represented by negative reciprocal exponential functions ae- h/t. 2) The lengths of latent periods, during which <b>allantoic</b> or amniotic <b>fluids</b> obtain hemagglutinating activities, are inversely proportional to the amount of inoculated virus, but successive virus multiplication in the following periods show closely similar growth curves irrespectively of the amount of inoculated virus. 3) Amniotic and <b>allantoic</b> <b>fluids</b> at the time of death of infected embryo, indicate almost constant CCA titers, unrelated to the amount of inoculated virus. 4) There are negative correlations between the amount of inoculated virus and incubation periods, namely the length of times from inoculation of virus to death of infected embryo. 5) The movements of chick embryos of infected eggs and pulsations of blood vessels are retarded only after the CCA of the fluids reached maximam titer...|$|R
