40|$|Indonesia has a {{long history}} of aquaculture, dating from the 15 th century. Subsequently, the country has become a {{significant}} contributor to global aquaculture production, destined for both international and domestic markets. In 2009 the Government of Indonesia announced its vision to see Indonesia become the highest (volume) producer of aquaculture products in the world by 2015, with production targets equivalent to an overall increase in production of 353 % between 2009 and 2014. This paper comprises a PEEST (policy, economic, environmental, social, technical) review undertaken as a background study for a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) analysis, the outcomes of the SWOT analysis and a discussion of possible approaches to support sustainable aquaculture development in Indonesia. To meet the vision of a dramatic expansion of aquaculture production, one or more of the following strategies is required: intensification and production segmentation, areal expansion, and/or production diversification. Most likely the continued development of aquaculture in Indonesia will be a combination of these three strategies, with the relative influence of each depending on production sector and market demands. A key issue identified in the PEEST review and SWOT analysis is the dominance (in terms of number) of Indonesian aquaculture by smallholder <b>aquaculture</b> <b>farmers.</b> We argue that a range of influences, including aquaculture production expansion and changing international market requirements, have the potential to negatively impact smallholder <b>aquaculture</b> <b>farmers</b> in Indonesia, and that further policy development should specifically address these issues. © 2013 Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{identify}} the level of good aquaculture practice (GAqP) among aquaculture farmers; and to analyse the factors influence the level of practice and the importance of GAqP in increasing farmer’s income. Design/methodology/approach – Primary data were obtained through a survey conducted on 216 <b>aquaculture</b> pond fish <b>farmers.</b> The descriptive study was employed to identify the profile of respondents and their level of GAqP practices. The structural equation modelling (SEM) method was applied to analyse the factors influence the level of GAqP practice, and the influence of GAqP on the total income of <b>aquaculture</b> <b>farmers.</b> Findings – The results showed that the pond management by brackish water fish farmers is better than freshwater fish farmer, indicated by 77 per cent of them adopt GAqP at a level of 60 per cent and above, as compared to only 20 per cent by freshwater farmers. Physical and human assets were revealed to be most significant factors influence the practice of GAqP. The results also proved that GAqP was among the significant factor contributes to increasing in farmers’ household income; in addition to their other livelihood assets. Originality/value – To the best of the author’s knowledge, this is the very first study that employs SEM method to analyse the relationship between GAqP with livelihood asset and farmer’s income simultaneously in Malaysia. Furthermore, since the empirical studies related to GAqP is very few, the study will contribute to development of knowledge in the field of aquaculture.

However, coastal aquaculture in the region is among the activities most affected by increasing global climate change, which threatens sustainable development of the fisheries sector, as well as food security of the country. Within the action plan framework for adaptation and mitigation for climate change in the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development and the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS), climate-smart aquaculture (CSA) trials have been conducted in Hoang Phong commune, Thanh Hoa province in 2015 by WorldFish, the Vietnam Institute of Economics and Planning (VIFEP) and Thanh Hoa Agriculture Extension Center (TEC).

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 08 Aquaculture is {{the fastest}} growing food {{producing}} sector in the world. It currently supplies over half of all food fish consumed globally, and this number {{is expected to reach}} two thirds by 2030 in order to meet an increasingly wealthy and populous world’s demand for fish and seafood products. The majority of aquaculture output is produced in Asia, and the largest producer segment by number is rural smallholders. As production is set to increase, more attention must be paid to these important and numerous consumers, both in terms of development and environmental outcomes. Smallholder <b>aquaculture</b> <b>farmers</b> must invest in their farming activities in order to grow output sustainably and increase their income, however these same farmers are, due to various barriers, locked out of formal financing options and left to source investment capital informally, often at usury rates. There is a growing body of evidence that supports the financial inclusion of smallholders to provide this access to credit from formal intermediaries, to achieve development and environmental outcomes. This thesis explores financial inclusion and presents a conceptual framework, based on evidence from agriculture, through which to consider financial inclusion interventions to assist smallholders in aquaculture. Two solutions, value chain finance and mobile phone finance, are then evaluated against the key barriers to financial access smallholders in aquaculture face, to determine their suitability in this sector. A case study analysis of a smallholder shrimp cooperative in Aceh, Indonesia is then explored using the framework to consider potential solutions to scale these farmers sustainably...|$|R

The result of the analysis shows that the fish farmers were operating at the positive increasing returns to scale (RTS = 2. 055). The study shows that if the amount of fingerlings, hired labour, family labour, quantity of feeds and annual cost of materials were increased by 100 % in aquaculture production, total fish output in the aquaculture farms will increase by 40. 2 %, 136. 9 %, 6. 5 %, 26. 5 %, and 7. 6 % for each of the increase in the input respectively [...] This establishes the fact that these resources were under utilized in aquaculture production in Edo State.

30|$|In the {{stochastic}} frontier production approach, {{the technical}} efficiency is either {{defined as a}} minimum set of inputs required to produce a given level of output or alternatively as the maximum output attainable using a given set of inputs (Farrell 1957). Very few studies applied the stochastic frontier analysis in assessing the technical efficiency of the aquaculture sector of Malaysia and of other developing countries. Among the few studies, Sharma (1999), Sharma and Leung (1998), Dey et al. (2000) and Bhattacharya (2009) used the stochastic frontier production function to measure the technical efficiencies of various aquaculture products such as carps, tilapia and shrimp. Similar studies were conducted for aquaculture farms in Taiwan, Philippines, Vietnam and India (Chiang et al. 2004; Irz and McKenzie 2003; Nguyen and Vu 2007; Jayaraman 1998). The main findings of these studies showed {{that there was a}} high degree of technical inefficiency among the <b>aquaculture</b> <b>farmers.</b> Iinuma et al.

There is a lack of understanding about the problems in the small scale semi intensive cage farms in tropics region (Beveridge 2004). The output and productivity of cage farming may be affected by external factors such as marine pollution, climate change and other environmental factors which are beyond the control of the culturists. Studies found that there is increased risk of disease occurrence within cage reared fish (Merican 2006; Tan et al. 2006) and the potential risk of transfer of diseases to and from natural fish populations (Ferguson et al. 2007). Further research is required to understand the cage farm management systems (Rimmer et al. 2005).|$|R

The objective {{of this study was}} to analyse factors influencing farmer use practices of antimicrobials and other compounds by a questionnaire and observational survey conducted with 60 whiteleg shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) and 25 fish farmers in three coastal provinces in Northern Vietnam. Personnel in 22 shops distributing feed and chemicals for aquaculture were interviewed about their advice on sale to the farmers. Results showed that 20 different antimicrobial products were used for disease prevention and treatment in shrimp and marine fish culture. Banned products used included chloramphenicol, enrofloxacin and malachite green. Cage fish farmers said they purchased antimicrobial tablets readily available at a local pharmacy and sold for human use. Chinese traders were the main drug suppliers to the shrimp farmers in Quang Ninh and others provinces. Their products were sold with labels and product information written in Chinese only. Farmers appeared to have little awareness and concern about the disease aetiology when applying specific antimicrobials. Up to 50 % of the shrimp farmers used up to 20 different disinfectants, e. g. chlorine-based compounds, to disinfect water in storage ponds, often without knowledge of the type of disinfectants and their mode of action. A variety of probiotics, vitamins, minerals and herbal extracts were routinely used by mainly shrimp farmers to enhance shrimp immunity. There is an urgent need to provide <b>aquaculture</b> <b>farmers</b> access to diagnostic and independent disease control advisory services and quality medicated feed, since the current indiscriminate use of antimicrobials and other compounds are inefficient, costly, and hazardous to the aquatic animal and farmer’s health, the environment and food safety...|$|R

The study showed {{that a large number}} of farmers were engaged in fish cage culture and small-scale fisheries as main occupations. However, the income from these economic activities could not provide enough for their basic expense, this caused by the effects of tsunami on cage culture. Therefore many farmers have to work as labors. A Post-Tsunami Rehabilitation Program since year 2005 has been trying to help and support farmers a fund to improve the materials of aquacultural cages and fishing gears. The analyses showed that the quality and quantity of equipment, seeds and feeds invested in aquaculture farms were increased (P< 0. 01) comparison to pre-recovery period. Importantly, the farm area, growth rate, amount of product and revenue were improved (P< 0. 05) during the post-tsunami rehabilitation period. Additionally, the area and quality of house, household consumption, household infrastructures, health care and education were also improved (P< 0. 01). The satisfaction of farmers regard to the recovery programs was quite high (WAI= 3. 88). However, their expectation was to have more support of fund and knowledge/technology transfer. In this study, we also found that the knowledge on fish marketing and culture techniques were poor. Lack of alternative income generation would threat on cage culture and small-scale fisheries.

40|$|Thailand {{has seen}} a scaling up of pig {{production}} in numbers and structure. Nonetheless, in-house separation and agricultural reclamation of pig solid waste are common practice. Waste reclamation is not taking place under small-scale farming and its environmental dynamics cannot be simply understood as a direct projection to larger scales. Scaling up has transformed the environmental significance of waste reclamation, including waste transfer from livestock to agriculture farmers. Waste transfer benefits pig farmers by trade and removal of waste by agriculture and <b>aquaculture</b> <b>farmers</b> and {{is key to the}} environmental dynamics of pig production. However, waste reclamation is not clearly defined as a management option in environmental frameworks. Waste management is mainly addressed as in-farm wastewater with limited attention to agro-environmental values of present practices. To recognise present practices in agro-environmental policies this thesis suggests a descriptive strategy focused on the transfer of waste. Such strategy would avoid command-and-control norms, avoid conflicting with an environmental culture centered in biogas technology and support knowledge transfer in agriculture. A focus on waste transfer from animal farms to agriculture [and aquaculture] plots is interpreted as off-site waste management. Off-site waste management calls for the inclusion of geographical variables beyond animal farms. This leads to an extended area of environmental influence (EAEI). Resulting environmental dynamics allows an interpretation of environment beyond resource in classical agricultural geography to a connotation where environment is also significant to agriculture and livestock because of the impacts from production. The recognition of reclamation practices and, consequently, of the integral environmental dynamics, and hence the connotation of environment, would contribute to connect livestock with agriculture through environmental geography. Intensive livestock is then defined as distribution and not location. Formalisation of reclamation practices entails the acknowledgment of agro-ecological cycles in livestock...|$|R
40|$|The {{monitoring}} of <b>aquaculture</b> <b>farmers</b> by the UNDIP/WUR-team aims {{to assess the}} progress towards reaching the goals set by the project Building with Nature – Demak. As planned in this first year the sample was taken in one village: Tambakbulusan. As farmers implemented the learning from the Coastal Field Schools during the same season as the training was given, no baseline for this sample was measured. In the village six ponds were monitored during one cropping season; we report on five ponds {{as one of the}} ponds was the demonstration pond on which Blue Forest will report. Before stocking the ponds were dried for at least 5 days and composted goat manure was mixed to the sediment. Thereafter an good dosage of home-made organic fertilizer was added to improve water quality; during the culture period a smaller dose was added weekly to maintain the plankton growth in the pond. The farmers prepared the organic fertilizer (compost), called MOL, from fermented rotten fruits, vegetables and household waste. One farmer used an industrial compost and another fed manufactured pellets; thus the five farmers implemented partly the promoted LEISA technology. Several of the cropping cycles couldn’t be completed due to heavy rains or flooding. The ponds were restocked. Some ponds were harvested early to avoid risk of mortality due to increase of salinity of shrimp showing disease symptoms. Other water quality parameters were within the limits for recommended limits for shrimp culture. For one production cycle only from five ponds in one village, the shrimp produced per ha was three times higher for the three LEISA farmers and for the other two 20 times higher than the average found in the Demak baseline for one full year, The average gross margin (income) was IDR 46 million/cycle, i. e. 4. 5 times higher, but for the three LEISA farmers this was IDR 14 million/cycle, i. e. 40...|$|R
40|$|Research PaperNew Zealand’s quota {{management}} system, the QMS, has for years been {{considered as one}} of the most successful rights-based fisheries management system in the world. Although the hard evidence is at best patchy, New Zealand’s fishing industry is performing well ahead of most competitors, both in economic, biological and administrative terms. Part of the explanation to this relative success has been the co-management system set up between industry and government. Most operators are now organised in Quota Owner Associations (QOAs) and these have in many cases been allocated important management functions. Central functions like the registry service is now delegated to the industry (Fishserve) and the industry is also paying 60 % of the total management costs. For years co-management has been considered an issue between government and the fishing industry, with the claim that ”user pay, user say”. More recently other stakeholders, such as Maori customary and recreational fishers, <b>aquaculture</b> <b>farmers</b> as well as environmental interests have challenged this vision of co-management. All claim rights, that are not compatible with the QMS in its most narrow sense. One solution could imply making other user-rights compatible with the QMS and let the market decide, a solution advocated by many economists. Another way around the problem is to solve the user conflicts through local planning, a solution that is now being introduced in the form of Fisheries Plans. Both solutions seem to be running into severe difficulties, indicating that fisheries management is more than ”getting the incentives right”. The main thrust of the article is to indicate that co-management in its traditional form can be perceived as an obstacle to a wider stakeholder participation. Giving secure rights only to one group (as the QMS) will in the next instance create conflicts and demands from other participants involved. The empirical evidence is largely based on my role as participant observer in the Ministry of Fisheries in 2000 / 2001, further detailed in Hersoug (2002) ...|$|R
40|$|Freshwater {{community-based}} aquaculture was introduce to village irrigation {{tanks in}} the dry zones of Sri Lanka in order to off-set the limited supply of animal protein available to residents in inland areas.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyFood ScienceJustin KastnerMany Chinese <b>aquaculture</b> <b>farmers</b> use unapproved {{chemicals}} {{to treat their}} fish, {{many of which are}} diseased {{as a result of the}} country’s poor waste management and environmental practices. During 2006 - 2007, the United States (U. S.), the European Union, and Japan rejected large amounts of Chinese seafood imports due to the presence of unapproved chemicals or the presence of approved chemicals at concentrations that exceeded permitted levels. This dissertation examines the sources of environmental health and food safety problems in China; it also examines how effective the U. S. and Chinese governments’ regulations are in protecting consumers from hazards in Chinese aquaculture products. The study looks at specific chemical contaminants found in Chinese aquaculture imports, explores their potential toxicity or carcinogenicity, and examines the reasons for their prohibition from human food. The study exploits the available U. S. seafood consumption patterns (courtesy of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey—NHANES—database) and then uses probabilistic modeling (courtesy of CREMe Software Limited) to determine the extent to which specific sensitive U. S. consumer subpopulations were exposed to aquaculture chemical contaminants in the food supply in a contrived scenario using real consumption data (from NHANES) and actual contamination data (from the FDA). The study compares exposure between children and adult consumers, and also looks at exposure among women aged 18 years and older and the elderly aged 60 years and older. This study suggests a strong likelihood that NHANES children, as well as female consumers aged 18 years and older and elderly consumers aged 60 years and older, were (in the contrived scenario) all exposed to violative intake levels of chemical contaminants from Chinese aquaculture imports. Children forming the 99. 5 th and 99. 9 th percentiles of NHANES seafood consumers were exposed to higher levels of nitrofuran, gentian violet, and malachite green contaminants per kilogram of body weight than were their adult counterparts. Conversely, children were exposed to lower levels of fluoroquinolone contaminants per kilogram of body weight than were their adult counterparts. The 50 th, 95 th, and 99. 9 th percentiles of female consumers aged 18 and older and elderly consumers aged 60 years and older were exposed to violative daily intake levels of contaminants in Chinese aquaculture. The study concludes by examining what the U. S. and Chinese governments should do to address aquaculture safety...|$|R
