40|$|R. Clausius proved Carnot's theorem basing on {{postulate}} "Heat cannot, of itself, {{pass from}} <b>a</b> <b>colder</b> to <b>a</b> hotter body". Alexander Gukhman demonstrated that Carnot's theorem can be proved {{based on the}} postulate "Heat cannot, of itself, pass from a hotter to <b>a</b> <b>colder</b> body". He concluded that Carnot's theorem does not follow from Clausius' postulate. The following paper gives a detailed justification of Gukhman's derivation. Comment: 6 page...|$|R
5|$|September 2, 2006– The {{remnants}} of Hurricane John, an East Pacific storm, cause moderate to heavy rainfall. In northern Texas, {{moisture from the}} storm combined with <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> front produces rainfall of over , helping alleviate severe drought.|$|E
5|$|Sinatra with <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> is Picasso without paint, Ferrari without fuel--only worse. For {{the common}} cold robs Sinatra of that uninsurable jewel, his voice, cutting into {{the core of his}} confidence, and it affects not only his own psyche but also seems to cause a kind of {{psychosomatic}} nasal drip within dozens of people who work for him, drink with him, love him, depend on him for their own welfare and stability. A Sinatra with <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> can, in a small way, send vibrations through the entertainment industry and beyond as surely as a President of the United States, suddenly sick, can shake the national economy.|$|E
5|$|The bath complex {{featured}} {{an entrance}} room (vestibulum), an exercise hall (basilica thermarum), a sweating room (sudatorium), <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> room with <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> pool (frigidarium), a warm room (tepidarium), {{and a hot}} room with a hot plunge bath (caldarium). An unsheltered exercise yard (palaestra) also formed part of the complex. The baths had mosaic floors and were heated by a hypocaust under-floor system connected to three furnaces. Such furnaces required several metric tons of wood each day.|$|E

5|$|After {{crossing}} into Virginia, Jeanne transitioned into an extratropical cyclone by September 29 near Washington, D.C. In Wilmington, Delaware, {{the storm}} spawned an F2 tornado. Across the Mid-Atlantic and New England, {{moisture from the}} storm produced light to heavy rainfall, with totals of over 7inches (175mm) near Philadelphia and Nantucket. Subsequent to becoming extratropical, the remnants of Jeanne turned eastward, exited into the Atlantic Ocean, and merged with <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> front.|$|E

5|$|An {{occluded}} front is formed {{during the process}} of cyclogenesis when <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> front overtakes a warm front. The cold and warm fronts curve naturally poleward into the point of occlusion, which is also known as the triple point in meteorology. It lies within a sharp trough, but the air mass behind the boundary can be either warm or cold. In <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> occlusion, the air mass overtaking the warm front is cooler than the cool air ahead of the warm front, and plows under both air masses. In a warm occlusion, the air mass overtaking the warm front is not as cool as the cold air ahead of the warm front, and rides over the colder air mass while lifting the warm air. A wide variety of weather can be found along an {{occluded front}}, with thunderstorms possible, but usually their passage is associated with a drying of the air mass. Occluded fronts are indicated on a weather map by a purple line with alternating half-circles and triangles pointing in direction of travel. Occluded fronts usually form around mature low pressure areas.|$|E
5|$|Archie Clement led {{the guerrillas}} after Anderson's death, {{but the group}} {{splintered}} by mid-November. Most Confederate guerrillas lost heart around that time, owing to <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> winter {{and the failure of}} General Price's 1864 Missouri campaign, which ensured that the state would remain under Union control. As the Confederacy collapsed, most of Anderson's men joined Quantrill's forces or traveled to Texas. Jim Anderson moved to Sherman, Texas, with his two sisters.|$|E
5|$|As {{it moved}} northward, Jeanne {{continued}} to drop moderate to heavy rainfall, including over 7inches (175mm) in southern Georgia. <b>A</b> <b>cold</b> front {{across the region}} caused the depression to accelerate northeastward, combining moisture from the Gulf of Mexico with cool and stable air over the Carolinas. This combination produced severe thunderstorms across the region, spawning six tornadoes in Georgia, eight in South Carolina, and eight in North Carolina.|$|E

5|$|Campbell {{was born}} in Newark, New Jersey in 1910. His father was <b>a</b> <b>cold,</b> impersonal, and unaffectionate {{electrical}} engineer. His mother, Dorothy (née Strahern) was warm but changeable of character and had an identical twin who visited them often and who disliked young John. John was unable to tell them apart and was frequently coldly rebuffed by the person he took to be his mother.|$|E
5|$|East Antarctica is <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> {{region with}} a ground base {{above sea level}} and {{occupies}} most of the continent. This area is dominated by small accumulations of snowfall which becomes ice and thus eventually seaward glacial flows. The mass balance of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet {{as a whole is}} thought to be slightly positive (lowering sea level) or near to balance. However, increased ice outflow has been suggested in some regions.|$|E
