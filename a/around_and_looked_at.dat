60|$|They {{all three}} turned <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the {{wonderful}} bank of pink roses {{within a few}} feet of them.|$|E
60|$|At {{this she}} turned <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> him. Even into her strong mind the sharp edge of {{distrust}} began to insert itself.|$|E
6000|$|... "Good-bye, Shaggy Man," [...] called Dorothy, and {{ran after}} Toto. The little dog pranced briskly along for some distance; {{when he turned}} <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> his {{mistress}} questioningly.|$|E
5000|$|... "Turn <b>Around</b> <b>and</b> <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> Me" [...] (Jerry Capehart, Glen Campbell) - 2:50 ...|$|R
5000|$|... What type of {{structure}} (shape) does my work propose? It is organic, geometric? What if I turn the stain <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it from different angles? ...|$|R
60|$|George {{had turned}} to reenter the cook room. He moved slowly <b>around</b> <b>and,</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> his face, {{it seemed to me}} that he was turning over the wisdom and {{knowledge}} of centuries in his head.|$|R
60|$|The Frenchman ushered him in. The {{door was}} closed and {{carefully}} locked. Then Monsieur Guillot swung <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> his visitor with some curiosity. Granet was still wearing his uniform.|$|E
60|$|Sophy, {{struck by}} {{something}} in his voice, swung <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> him. Then she thrust both her arms through his, clasped her two hands together, and led him firmly away. A glimmering of the truth was beginning to dawn upon her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Got here," [...] he said abruptly, {{and then}} swung <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> Grenfell. [...] "This {{is the other}} man? Well, he can stay and bring along the baggage. There's most a freight-car full. They'll give him a wagon and team at the hotel." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Prove it yourself. Turn <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him. You've {{got him in}} profile. <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> his nose. That's Isaac Ford's. Yours is a thin {{edition of}} it. That's right. Look. The lines are fuller, but they are all there." ...|$|R
60|$|The Prince turned <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> inquiringly <b>at</b> the surgeon.|$|R
60|$|Dave was peering <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>looking</b> anxiously <b>at</b> the heavy, leaden sky.|$|R
60|$|As {{the leader}} sprang forward his gleaming eyes caught {{the play of}} the {{fountain}} and he rushed toward it and drank eagerly of the sparkling water. Many of the other Phanfasms drank, too, in order to clear their dry and dusty throats. Then they stood <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> one another with simple, wondering smiles.|$|E
6000|$|... "Get home, Franco!" [...] said Jonas again; and, stooping down, {{he took a}} {{piece of}} {{hardened}} snow or ice from the road, and threw it towards him. The ice fell, before it reached Franco, and rolled along towards his feet, which made him scamper along a little farther; and then he stopped, and turned <b>around,</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> Jonas, as before.|$|E
60|$|He {{did not sit}} long. His mind, {{working in}} its {{customary}} way, like a steel trap, canvassed the idea in all its bearings. It was big--bigger than anything he had faced before. And he faced it squarely, picked it up in his two hands and turned it over and <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> it. The simplicity of it delighted him. He chuckled over it, reached his decision, and began to dress. Midway in the dressing he stopped {{in order to use}} the telephone.|$|E
50|$|Humor is an {{on-going}} feature, a {{thing he}} focuses a lot on. One of his idols, Stephen King, once said his biggest wish was {{that someone would}} die of terror after reading his book. To that JÃ¼rgensen has remarked that his biggest wish is that someone will laugh so hard from reading his book {{that people in the}} bus will turn <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him.|$|R
5000|$|Guests {{have often}} praised the {{chemistry}} between Ferguson and Peterson during their interviews on The Late Late Show. Regis Philbin said [...] "Y'know the robot? I've actually [...] in love. I wasn't {{sure of the}} robot but he's grown on me. I think it's a great combination. You Ferguson say something funny, you turn <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him, <b>and</b> he Peterson says something funnier!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Boys, I can't really waste Australian funds. You {{know the}} public subscribed money {{so we could}} come over for a reason. I think we should just go <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> Rome <b>and</b> some of the villages on the outskirts. David Cheshire, Manager, [...] It was a really big effort because they medical teamdidn't know {{how we were going}} to travel - we didn't know how we were going to travel either. Kevin Coombs, athlete ...|$|R
60|$|After he had rested a bit, {{he turned}} <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> his new home, {{for that is}} what it was, {{although}} he had not come there to live yet, and no one knew of it, no one but jolly, round, red Mr. Sun, who, peeping between the branches of the old apple tree, had caught Johnny Chuck at work. But he wouldn't tell, not jolly Mr. Sun! Looking down from the blue sky every day he sees all sorts of queer things and he learns all kinds of secrets, does Mr. Sun, but he never, never tells. No, Sir! Mr. Sun never tells one of them, not even to Old Mother West Wind when at night they go down together behind the Purple Hills.|$|E
60|$|I pitied {{the poor}} old fellow, who, {{if he had}} been a horse, would have been no more than {{fourteen}} hands high, and as he went puffing along, tugging and grunting as if I was a load of coal, I felt as if I couldn't stand it another minute, and I called out to him to stop. It did seem as if he would drop before he got me back to the hotel, and I bounced out in no time, and then I walked {{in front of him and}} turned <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> him. If it is possible for a human hack-horse to have spavins in two joints in each leg, that man had them; and he looked as if he couldn't remember what it was to have a good feed.|$|E
60|$|For a {{few minutes}} he watched it from the top rail of the old fence. Then he scurried {{down to the ground}} and, a few steps at a time, {{stopping}} to watch sharply between each little run, he drew nearer and nearer to that queer acting string. It gave him a funny feeling inside to see a string acting like that, so he was very careful not to get too near. He looked at it from one side, then ran <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> it from the other side. At last he got where he could see that one end of the string was under an old board, and then he began to understand. Of course there was somebody hiding under that old board and jerking the string.|$|E
50|$|When the bluebirds gather <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> ominously <b>at</b> Catfish Stu, Robear and Robert, {{the scene}} is {{reminiscent}} of the Alfred Hitchcock movie The Birds.|$|R
2500|$|Featured on the {{nationwide}} broadcasts of the Opry, Oswald created a sensation playing his resonator guitar on such songs as [...] "Old Age Pension Check". The instrument, {{developed in the}} late 1920s, was still relatively new. Oswald and the Acuff band were featured in a Hollywood film, Grand Ole Opry for Republic Pictures, which gave the instrument even greater exposure. [...] "People couldn't understand how I played it and what it was, and they'd always want to come <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it." ...|$|R
5000|$|Deux members Lee Hyun Do and Kim Sung-jae {{met when}} they worked as back-up dancers for Korean rapper Hyun Jin-young. They debuted in 1993 with the album, Deux, which {{featured}} the hit song, [...] "Turn <b>Around</b> <b>and</b> <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> Me." [...] In addition to helping introduce hip hop and new jack swing to Korea, the duo is also notable for popularizing hip hop-influenced choreography and fashion. After releasing three more albums, {{they broke up}} in 1995 to pursue solo careers.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Herring's blunt {{expression}} of his sentiments {{was not intended}} for other ears than ours, I am sure. In confidence, one may say many things to friends which he would prefer to withhold from an indiscriminating public. We are well assured, indeed, that Mr. Herring is a loyal American, with America's best interests at heart, {{but he does not}} regard our present national activities as leniently as we do. I have been endeavoring, in my humble way, to change his attitude of mind," [...] here Herring swung <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the speaker stolidly, [...] "and though I admit he is a bit obstinate, I venture to assure you, Miss Burrows, that Silas Herring will stand by the Stars and Stripes {{as long as there is}} a shred of our banner to wave in the breeze of freedom, justice and democracy." ...|$|E
6000|$|King was a polo pony from St. Louis, and Prince a many-gaited love-horse from Pasadena. The {{hardest thing}} was {{to get them to}} dig in and pull. They rollicked along on the levels and galloped down the hills, but when they struck an up-grade and felt the weight of the breaking-cart, they stopped and turned <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> me. But I passed them, and my {{troubles}} began. Milda was fourteen years old, an unadulterated broncho, and in temperament was a combination of mule and jack-rabbit blended equally. If you pressed your hand on her flank and told her to get over, she lay down on you. If you got her by the head and told her to back, she walked forward over you. And if you got behind her and shoved and told her to [...] "Giddap!" [...] she sat down on you. Also, she wouldn't walk. For endless weary miles I strove with her, but never could I get her to walk a step. Finally, she was a manger-glutton. No matter how near or far from the stable, when six o'clock came around she bolted for home and never missed the directest cross-road. Many times I rejected her.|$|E
5000|$|On March 13, 1991, Mobley {{was interviewed}} by {{investigators}} from the Hall County Sheriff's Department and the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. Mobley made a voluntary oral confession to Collins's murder and dictated a written confession. He made further statements on March 14 and 15, including the statement: [...] "The guy I was robbing turned <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> me. I said 'don't look at me, face the wall.' I pointed the gun up in his direction and turned my head away and fired." ...|$|E

6000|$|They {{came from}} all directions, and there were {{thousands}} of them: big mice and little mice and middle-sized mice; and each one brought a piece of string in his mouth. It was about this time that Dorothy woke from her long sleep and opened her eyes. She was greatly astonished to find herself lying upon the grass, with thousands of mice standing <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> her timidly. But the Scarecrow told her about everything, and turning to the dignified little Mouse, he said: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will come}} with pleasure," [...] Burton replied. [...] "This afternoon, if you could spare a few minutes?" [...] the {{auctioneer}} suggested. [...] "We might go <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> that Romney which has just been unearthed. I have been to Christie's three times already to see it, but I should like to take you. There's something about the face which I don't quite understand. There is a landscape there, too, just sent up from some country house, which I think would interest you." ...|$|R
5000|$|Roh {{enrolled}} in Michigan's College of Literature, Science and the Arts {{and joined the}} football team for summer practice in August 2009. He impressed the coaching staff during summer practice and earned {{a spot in the}} starting lineup as a true freshman. His speed and athleticism were attributes that drew the coaches' attention. Michigan's tailback, Carlos Brown, described seeing the big freshman running by his side, and keeping up. Brown added, [...] "He turned <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> me, and I said, 'That's Craig Roh running with me right down the field?' It's ridiculous. He's real fast." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Simon Wells, {{one of the}} movie's directors, {{describes}} {{the moment when the}} singer recorded the song. [...] "He just came in and set the whole studio on fire." [...] Brenda Chapman, another director on the project, adds, [...] "It was great. I turned <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> everyone in the booth as he was singing, and people just had these big grins on their faces, because he WAS Jethro when he was doing this." [...] Brian's dynamic rendering of [...] "Through Heaven's Eyes," [...] in concert with the spectacular, colorful animation, brings the scene and character to life in one of THE PRINCE OF EGYPT's most breathtaking sequences." ...|$|E
50|$|After a few {{talks with}} the islanders, Lucas turned <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the hole where Caitlyn was peeking through and waved goodbye, and ran, the islanders chasing him. When Caitlyn saw this, she went out of hiding and ran {{as fast as she}} can just to get to Lucas. When Lucas got to the mudflats, which is very dangerous, since one wrong step can lead to death by sinking, he didn't stop while the villagers stayed in place. When Caitlyn got there she took the first step, but didn't get through all the way to Lucas, because Dom and John took a hold of her, because it was deadly, leaving Caitlyn {{thrashing}} around and shouting 'Lucas'.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{meantime}} Raju's enemies are conspiring {{against him and}} they collapse a bridge which was under Raju's supervision. He gets the blame and soon realises that the glamorous world of the rich is not what he wants. In the end, Raju decides to leave. Most people were asking Jai when Raju would come back. Jai told them when he turns his head <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> Renu he will {{have no choice but}} to come back. Just a second ago Jai said [...] "Palat" [...] (meaning turn) then Raju turns <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> Renu. He <b>and</b> Renu finally get reunited again.|$|R
5|$|Michael (turned {{back into}} a zombie) and his fellow corpses then back the frightened girl {{into the corner of}} a nearby {{abandoned}} house. Michael then reaches for his date's throat as she lets out a bloodcurdling scream, only to awake and realize it was all a dream. Michael then offers to take her home, and she happily obliges. As they walk out of the house, Michael turns <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> the camera, thus revealing his yellow werewolf eyes and fangs {{from the beginning of the}} video, as we hear Vincent Price's haunting laugh, while Michael grins.|$|R
500|$|In 2011, on the 20th {{anniversary of}} his record-breaking stolen base, the Oakland A's held [...] "Rickey Henderson Bobblehead Day." [...] At Henderson's insistence, the {{giveaway}} plastic dolls had one atypical modification: [...] "I told them, put a little dirt on mine, make sure that [...] like I'm playing the game." [...] Almost eight years after his final game, Henderson also reiterated his desire to return: [...] "Sometimes when I sit <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the game <b>and</b> things ain't going right, I just think, 'Just let me put on the uniform and {{go out there and}} take a chance'." ...|$|R
