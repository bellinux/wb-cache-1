As of the 2011–12 season, the only European competition the club have {{taken part in}} is the Anglo-Italian Cup, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>never</b> progressed past the group stage of that tournament. Luton Town have also qualified for the UEFA Cup, as winners of the Football League Cup in 1987–88; however, {{they were unable to}} compete due to the ban of English clubs from European competitions following the Heysel Stadium Disaster.|$|E
5|$|Del Valle {{was born}} in Jalisco, Mexico. His father, Antonio del Valle, was {{a soldier in the}} Spanish army who came to California in 1819 and was mayordomo (administrator and/or foreman) of Mission San Fernando Rey de España. Ygnacio joined the army as a cadet in 1825 at the Presidio of Santa Barbara. In 1828 he was {{promoted}} to second lieutenant and transferred to the Presidio of San Diego. In 1832, his commander became involved in a power struggle with the commandant of the Presidio of Monterey, where Antonio served. Ygnacio's side won the conflict on the battlefield, causing a rift between father and son, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>never</b> spoke again.|$|E

Nickerson Field, Harvard Stadium, Fenway Park, and Alumni Stadium all served as home fields during their time in the American Football League. They played in only one AFL championship game, following the 1963 season, in which they lost to the San Diego Chargers 51–10. They did not appear again in an AFL or NFL post-season game for another 13 years.|$|E

5|$|Charig et al. {{pointed to}} the {{presence}} of hairline cracks in the slabs running through both rock and fossil impressions, and mineral growth over the slabs that had occurred before discovery and preparation, as evidence that the feathers were original. Spetner et al. then attempted to show that the cracks would have propagated naturally through their postulated cement layer, but neglected to account {{for the fact that the}} cracks were old and had been filled with calcite, and thus were not able to propagate. They also attempted to show the presence of cement on the London specimen through X-ray spectroscopy, and did find something that was not rock; it was not cement either, and is most probably a fragment of silicone rubber left behind when moulds were made of the specimen. Their suggestions have not been taken seriously by palaeontologists, as their evidence was largely based on misunderstandings of geology, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>never</b> discussed the other feather-bearing specimens, which have increased in number since then. Charig et al. reported a discolouration: a dark band between two layers of limestone – they say it is the product of sedimentation. It is natural for limestone to take on the colour of its surroundings and most limestones are coloured (if not colour banded) to some degree, so the darkness was attributed to such impurities. They also mention that a complete absence of air bubbles in the rock slabs is further proof that the specimen is authentic.|$|E

25|$|A two-volume {{supplement}} to the third edition was published in 1801, having 1,624 pages and 50 copperplates by D. Lizars. A revised edition was published in 1803. This supplement was published by a wine-merchant, Thomas Bonar, the son-in-law of the Britannica's owner Andrew Bell; unfortunately, the two men quarreled <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>never</b> spoke {{for the last ten}} years of Bell's life (1799–1809). Bonar was friendly to the article authors, however, and conceived the plan of paying them as well as the article reviewers, and of allowing them to retain copyright for separate publication of their work.|$|E

25|$|In 1883 {{her father}} died, leaving her a modest {{inheritance}} to live on. She continued taking minor roles at the Folly, but changed her stage name back to Florence Farr {{when she began}} performing at the Gaiety Theatre in May. Her commanding presence and beautiful speaking voice were noted by Shaw. She soon attained modest success on London's West End stages. In 1884 she married fellow actor Edward Emery. It {{turned out to be}} a disastrous marriage, and she chafed under the restrictions expected of a Victorian wife. In 1888, her husband left for an extended tour of America, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>never</b> saw each other again. She eventually obtained a divorce in 1895 on the grounds of abandonment and never remarried.|$|E

25|$|Cooperation was {{hindered}} by Fighter Command retaining rigid {{control of its}} units. The Admiralty complained that RAF methods did not permit direct contact by RAF operational staff liaising with the naval command. Time was lost and the fluidity of aerial warfare, meant that RAF aircraft came into action {{at the wrong time}} or place, often in numbers too small to defend the evacuation ships. Vice Admiral Max Horton the Commander-in-Chief Dover, responsible for organising the evacuation (Operation Dynamo), asked to meet Dowding in late June, to prevent the operational difficulties occurring again. Horton was told to put his complaints on paper and send them to Dowding, with a copy to the Air Ministry <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>never</b> met. It was felt by the Admiralty that the RAF was fighting a separate war, with little consideration given to joint operations.|$|E
25|$|After beating Mars Bar in a foot {{race and}} goading him into {{crashing}} Piper's birthday {{party at the}} McNabs' house, Jeffrey is homeless again. He moves back into the buffalo pen, and runs for miles every morning before Two Mills wakes up. Before long, Mars Bar starts running with him as if by coincidence, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>never</b> {{say a word to}} each other. One day they come across a hysterical Piper McNab, who frantically leads them to Russell, stuck on the trolley trestle where Jeffrey's parents died. He walks away silently, nearly unconscious and stunned by fear, while Mars Bar rescues Russell, becoming a hero in his eyes. Jeffrey retreats once again to the buffalo pen, where Mars Bar leads Amanda to it. She brings him to her house in a huff, with Jeffrey and Mars Bar following her.|$|E
25|$|The couple's {{divorce is}} {{finalized}} in 1987 and Angie damages Den by demanding a large divorce settlement. Den runs The Queen Vic alone, initially assisted by Jan, but this relationship ends when Jan grows disillusioned with Den's treatment of her. Den has a fling with the Vic's caterer, Magda Czajkowski (Kathryn Apanowicz), but is scorned when she eventually opts to date Simon Wicks (Nick Berry) instead. When he discovers {{that they are}} seeing each other, he punches Simon, sacks him and throws {{him out of his}} home in the Vic. Whilst single again, Den begins to realise that The Vic's trade is floundering without Angie. With some meddling from Sharon, Den and Angie decide to reunite as business partners and she returns to live at The Vic. However, it is short-lived, because Angie falls in love with her friend, Sonny. Realising that Angie is planning to leave him, Den visits a solicitor and makes certain that Angie has no claim on The Queen Vic. Angie leaves Walford for Spain in May 1988 with nothing, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>never</b> see or hear anything of each other again.|$|E

25|$|By {{shuffling}} his cabinet, Jackson {{hoped to}} keep the talented McLane in his service by removing from him the obligation to implement his planned permanent destruction of the Second Bank of the United States. Appointed U.S. Secretary of State in a recess appointment, McLane served from May 29, 1833 until June 30, 1834. He quickly managed the first major reorganization of the department, by establishing seven new bureaus. He also managed a dispute with France, over what were known as the “Spoliation Claims”. In 1832 France had agreed to reimburse the United States for certain shipping losses incurred during the Napoleonic Wars. However, successive French governments had failed to appropriate the funds required, all the while maintaining their desire to do so. Jackson was impatient {{to resolve the issue}} and worked with McLane to develop a hard line policy, confronting the French. Martin Van Buren was now Vice President and felt otherwise. Without consulting McLane, he intervened directly and convinced Jackson to give the French more time. McLane was furious with his old mentor for this intervention, and resigned his position, recognizing his apparent lack of authority in a direct area of responsibility. The incident also ended his friendship with Van Buren, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>never</b> spoke again.|$|E
25|$|During World War I the Assyrian Genocide {{took place}} within the Ottoman Empire, which {{decimated}} the Nochiyaye, {{along with all the}} other Assyrian Tribes of the Hakkari mountains. In 1915 The Assyrians of the Hakkari mountains, under the rule of Patriarch Shimun XXI Benyamin, joined the Allied side of the war due to being promised independence and aid by the British, because the Turks were at the time massacring other ethnic Assyrians(particularly Chaldean and Syriac Catholics) in Bitlis and Diyarbakir, and because the Turks executed his brother who was studying in Istanbul in April of that year. Therefore, The Patriarch declared war against the Ottoman Empire and rallied his people alongside the British, Russians, and Armenians, in what was known as the Caucasus Campaign. The Assyrians of the Hakkari Mountains fought hard against the Turks for three years, but were eventually forced to flee the region, as their allies abandoned them, with the Russians leaving due to the Russian Revolution, and the Armenians being too overwhelmed to give aid, while The British decided not to give them any aid, and in doing so betrayed them. Therefore, The Assyrians had to leave because they were surrounded by hostile Muslim Turks and Kurds and had no means to continuously fight against them as they were too severely outmanned and outgunned without Allied support. So in 1918, all the Assyrians of the Hakkari mountains fled to Iran to catch British train lines which would take them to Iraq, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>never</b> returned again.|$|E
