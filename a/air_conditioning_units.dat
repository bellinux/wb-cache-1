5|$|The tornado {{touched down}} at 6:18p.m. CST (00:18UTC) near Castleberry High School {{northwest}} of downtown Fort Worth. Initially, the tornado lacked a condensation funnel, and {{could only be}} visually identified as dust swirls near the ground beneath the rotating wall cloud aloft; the tornado maintained this appearance {{for the first five}} minutes of its lifespan, after which a condensation funnel eventually developed. The first signs of damage occurred in the River Oaks area along Texas State Highway 183 where metal roof panels were stripped off of a vacant fast food restaurant. After crossing the highway, the tornado inflicted sporadic F0damage to an older residential area, breaking tree branches and causing some damage to outbuildings; a few chimneys were toppled off of homes. At the time, the tornado's damage path was only a few hundred feet wide. A roof of a home near Roberts Cut Off Road was partially removed, signifying the first instance of F1damage. Several large and rotted trees were uprooted by the tornado's strong winds as it moved through the area. The tornado then passed directly over Castleberry High School, causing significant damage to the school's field house. Tornadic debris—including rooftop <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>units,</b> gravel, and other detached construction—was thrown by the tornado at the school's western façade, causing minor damage. Throughout River Oak, three homes sustained major damage while 51others experienced minor damage.|$|E

25|$|As {{originally}} built, most Pentagon {{office space}} consisted of open bays which spanned an entire ring.

Stringent new requirements including demands for increased operating efficiencies and the reduction or elimination of harmful emissions are enhancing copper's role in modern HVAC systems.|$|E

Walter P. Chrysler had seen to the invention of Airtemp air conditioning back in the 1930s for the Chrysler Building, and had ostensibly offered it on cars in 1941-42, and again in 1951-52, but none {{are known to have}} been sold in the latter form until the 1953 model year. In actually installing optional Airtemp <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>units</b> to its Imperials in 1953, Chrysler beat Cadillac, Buick and Oldsmobile which added air conditioning as an option in the 1953 model year.|$|E

40|$|Within a {{research}} project at the Fraunhofer Institute for Machine Tools and Forming Technology IWU, vibration description methods are applied using the example of an <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>unit</b> (AC unit) from a railway vehicle. The AC unit consists of several components, where usually the compressors and fans contribute most to the radiated sound power resp. to the transmitted structure-borne sound into the vehicle. In a first step, forces F and accelerations a under steady-state conditions were measured {{on each of the}} six mounting brackets of the <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>unit.</b> Afterwards, all of the dominant vibration sources of the unit were investigated individually concerning their contribution at each of their contact points. Finally, knowing the mobilities Y of the contact points between sources and unit enables detailed analysis of the system itself. Moreover, it also indicates "weak points" which have to be avoided according to an improved vibrational behavior of the complete <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>unit...</b>|$|R

Heavy ash falls may cause telecommunication lines, masts, cables, aerials, antennae dishes and towers to collapse due to ash loading. [...] Moist ash may also cause accelerated corrosion of metal components.|$|E

500|$|As {{with most}} of Arizona, Phoenix does not observe {{daylight}} saving time. In 1973, Governor Jack Williams argued to the U.S. Congress that due to <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>units</b> not being used as often {{in the morning on}} standard time, energy use would increase in the evening should the state observe daylight saving time. He {{went on to say that}} energy use would also rise early in the day [...] "because there would be more lights on in the early morning." [...] Additionally, he said that daylight savings time would cause children to go to school in the dark.|$|E

40|$|The <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> (AC) <b>unit</b> {{is one of}} the {{dominant}} sound sources for exterior and interior noise of a railway vehicle. The design of such devices is a compromise between major functions like efficiency, fluid mechanics, thermodynamics and acoustics. The vibrational and acoustical behavior of an <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>unit</b> needs to be quantified in every state of the development process, starting in an early design phase. Therefore preferably simple and fast calculation tools are needed, which can be easily built up and adapted {{in a short period of}} time. Within a research project at the Fraunhofer Institute for Machine Tools and Forming Technology (IWU) an acoustical calculation model, based on transfer matrices of the different components, has been created to give a sufficiently accurate description of the sound power radiated by the <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>unit.</b> In a first step the sound power of relevant sources has been characterized by measurement data. Furthermore the acoustical transfer behavior of ducts, chambers and additional components like condensers or evaporators have been individually investigated and implemented in the model using -port elements. Finally, the sources and transfer components were combined to get a complete representation of the acoustical properties of the <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>unit,</b> which can be used for parameter variation studies...|$|R

500|$|Wonder Mountain is a steel structure, its meshing {{covered in}} autumn 1980 {{with three layers}} of gunnite, a special type of cement that was later {{roughened}} {{to make it look}} like rock. Pumps within the mountain push the water over at the rate of 35,000 gallons a minute. This water helped cool the park's <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>units,</b> stored in a 100 by 40 foot room inside the mountain. The waterfall itself is named Victoria Falls, and was reportedly based on Victoria Falls, the largest waterfall in the world, which straddles the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe. In 2011, the park's [...] "Victoria Falls" [...] was still listed as powering its air conditioning. The mountain itself was slow to be named. Park publicist Mike Filey suggested in July 1980 that it might be named after Canadian-born Max Aitken, Lord Beaverbrook. Beaverbrook is typically associated with New Brunswick, where he moved at age 13 and started his first newspaper, and with the United Kingdom, where he became a newspaper baron. The Globe and Mail speculated that it might be named Mount Maple, to soothe relations with the local community, or that there might be a naming contest.|$|E
