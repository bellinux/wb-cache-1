25|$|The Rabbis {{taught in}} a Baraita that {{if a child is}} {{intelligent}} enough to ask the four questions, the child asks them. If the child is not intelligent enough, the wife asks them. If the wife does not <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions,</b> the leader of the seder asks them. And even two scholars who know the laws of Passover must ask one another (if no one else can ask).|$|E
25|$|The {{object of}} The Guide to Science was to present answers to over 2000 {{questions}} about common phenomena. There are questions {{dealing with the}} man-made objects such as candles, stoves and chimneys as well as answers seeking to explain natural phenomena such as thunder and lightning (including a mention of ball lightning), clouds, dew and rainbows. Brewer intended that his book should be intelligible to a child, since children might often <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> he was seeking to answer, but without being so foolish as to offend the scientific.|$|E
500|$|Adam Baldwin as Jayne Cobb– a mercenary. He and Mal {{met when}} they were on {{opposite}} sides of a dispute; Mal, while held at gunpoint, offered Jayne his own bunk and a higher cut than his current employer, so Jayne switched sides and shot his then-partners. In the original pilot, [...] "Serenity", he intimates to Mal that he did not betray him because [...] "The money wasn't good enough." [...] However, previously he had pointedly asked the Alliance agent whether he would be required to turn on the captain to help him, and in [...] "Ariel" [...] defends his actions in alerting the authorities regarding Simon and River by claiming he had not intended to betray Mal. He is someone who can be depended on in a fight. He tends to act like a [...] "lummox" [...] who thinks he is the smartest person in space, but occasional hints of intelligence peek through this façade, giving the impression that he acts dumber than he is. As Whedon states several times, Jayne is the man who will <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> that no one else wants to. Even though he is a macho character, he has shown a particularly intense fear of Reavers, more so {{than the rest of the}} crew. Despite his amoral mercenary persona, he sends a significant portion of his income to his mother, again suggesting that there is more to his character than what he presents to the rest of the crew.|$|E
40|$|A {{time delay}} {{procedure}} {{was used to}} teach 3 children with autism to <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> "What's that?" when novel stimuli were presented during an instructional task. Once <b>the</b> ability to <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> was acquired, <b>the</b> children's ability to learn novel information by <b>asking</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> was assessed. <b>The</b> children were then taught to <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> within a less structured context. All three studies used a multiple baseline across participants. Generalization was assessed in a different room, to a new person, and to novel stimuli. All of the children learned to <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> within <b>the</b> instructional context, while on {{a walk in the}} school building, and to request information about three-dimensional objects. The acquisition of novel information was consistent for receptive and expressive tests for 2 of the children, with varied results for the 3 rd. These studies indicate that children with autism can be taught to ask questions that lead to the acquisition of new information...|$|R

2500|$|One of Crosby's songwriting {{contributions}} to the album, [...] "What's Happening?!?!", began his penchant for writing abstract songs asking irresoluble questions, a trend that has continued throughout his career with Crosby, Stills & Nash and as a solo artist. During a 1966 interview, Crosby admitted {{that it was a}} strange song, noting [...] "It asks questions of what's going on here and who does it all belong to and why is it all going on. I just <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> because I really don't know the answers." [...] Like [...] "Eight Miles High", the song exhibits the strong influence of Indian classical music with its droning guitar and melody. [...] "What's Happening?!?!" [...] is also notable for being the first song written solely by Crosby to appear on a Byrds' record.|$|E

Then he asked himself if he really were engaged to Statira. He had told her that he liked her better than any one else in the world, and she had said as much to him.
