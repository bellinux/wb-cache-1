25|$|On 7 November, just 3 weeks <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>quake,</b> Super Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda) {{struck the}} region. Although the storm's eye missed the area {{affected}} by the earthquake, it sent some 40,000 Boholanos still living in temporary shelters back to evacuation centers and disrupted relief efforts in the province.|$|E
25|$|Population loss <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>quakes</b> necessitated {{expansion}} of the electorate in the 2013/14 redistribution, with the electorate gaining Mairehau and Shirley from Christchurch Central, Bromley from Port Hills and the remainder of Marshland from Waimakariri.|$|R
50|$|In 2010, he led <b>the</b> <b>Quakes</b> to <b>the</b> Eastern Conference Final of the MLS Cup playoffs, {{the club}} {{reaching}} {{the playoffs for}} the first time since 2005.

50|$|Chung retired <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>Quakes</b> {{moved to}} Houston <b>after</b> <b>the</b> 2006 season. Upon his retirement, {{he had played}} in 278 league matches. In 2008, he played one game with the Treasure Coast Galleons of the Florida Elite Soccer League.|$|R
25|$|Many Bohol {{residents}} were left without adequate {{safe drinking water}} and sanitary facilities <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>quake.</b> Consequently, serious public health issues arose such as cases of diarrhea and water-borne diseases. Worst affected were the municipalities closest to the epicenter, such as Sagbayan, San Isidro, Calape, Tubigon, Clarin and Catigbian.|$|E
25|$|Police {{promptly}} {{arrested a}} couple of opportunists who had broken into a liquor store shortly <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>quake</b> and attempted to take alcohol. Police emphasised this was only an isolated incident. The alleged offenders subsequently appeared in Court on burglary and theft charges {{in connection with the}} looting.|$|E
25|$|A tsunami wave flooded Sendai Airport at 15:55 JST, about 1 {{hour after}} the initial quake, causing severe damage. Narita and Haneda Airport both briefly {{suspended}} operations <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>quake,</b> but suffered little damage and reopened within 24 hours. Eleven airliners bound for Narita were diverted to nearby Yokota Air Base.|$|E
40|$|Geodetic {{measurements}} of the 1964 Niigata, Japan earthquake and of three other examples are briefly examined. They show exponentially decaying subsidence for a year <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>quakes.</b> <b>The</b> observations confirm the dilatancy-fluid diffusion model of earthquake precursors and clarify the extent and properties of the dilatant zone. An analysis using one-dimensional consolidation theory is included which agrees well with this interpretation...|$|R
5000|$|On August 13, 2012, the Dodgers {{promoted}} Puig to <b>the</b> Rancho Cucamonga <b>Quakes</b> of <b>the</b> Class A-Advanced California League. He {{played in}} 14 games with <b>the</b> <b>Quakes</b> and hit [...]327. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>Quakes</b> season, {{he was scheduled}} to join the Mesa Solar Sox of the Arizona Fall League, but a staph infection in his right elbow required surgery and sidelined him for several months. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> infection healed, he opted to play winter ball in Puerto Rico to keep his development on schedule.|$|R

25|$|The Forsyth Barr Building {{survived the}} {{earthquake}} but many occupants were trapped {{after the collapse}} of the stairwells, forcing some to abseil out <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>quake.</b> Search of the building was technically difficult for USAR teams, requiring the deconstruction of 4-tonne stair sets, but the building was cleared with no victims discovered.|$|E
25|$|Rail {{service was}} briefly interrupted, with full Amtrak and {{expanded}} Metrolink service resuming in {{stages in the}} days <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>quake.</b> Metrolink used the interruptions to road transport {{as a reason to}} experiment with service to Camarillo and Oxnard, which continues to the present. During the interruption, Metrolink leased equipment from Amtrak, San Francisco's Caltrain and Toronto, Canada's GO Transit to handle the sudden onslaught of passengers. All MTA bus lines operated service with detours and delays {{on the day of the}} quake. Los Angeles International Airport and other airports in the area were also shut down as a 2-hour precaution, including Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport (now Bob Hope Airport) and Van Nuys Airport, which is near the epicenter, where the control tower suffered from radar failure and panel collapse. The airport was reopened in stages <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>quake.</b>|$|E
25|$|A Japanese {{government}} {{study found}} that 58% of people in coastal areas in Iwate, Miyagi, and Fukushima prefectures heeded tsunami warnings immediately <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>quake</b> and headed for higher ground. Of those who attempted to evacuate after hearing the warning, only five percent {{were caught in the}} tsunami. Of those who didn't heed the warning, 49% were hit by the water.|$|E

However, a magnitude 7.8 earthquake on 25 April 2015 effectively shut down the Everest climbing season. 2015 {{was the first time}} since 1974 with no spring summits, as all climbing teams pulled out <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>quakes</b> and avalanche.|$|R
50|$|Rescue teams {{continued}} {{searching for}} survivors through the night, Iranian {{officials said they}} expected the death toll to rise. Between ten and twenty villages close to the epicenter were still cut off from aid {{and it would take}} some time to reach them. The Iranian government estimated at least 16,000 people spent <b>the</b> first night <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>quakes</b> in emergency shelters.|$|R
25|$|There {{were also}} threats to public health. Community health centers and {{hospitals}} were rendered useless, {{resulting in the}} use of makeshift wards outside the affected buildings. Food supply was also disrupted with many markets unable to operate a week <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>quake.</b> Furthermore, prolonged periods of aftershocks forced the population to take residence in makeshift shelters, afraid to go inside weakened buildings, and causing psychological trauma.|$|E
25|$|Detectable {{levels of}} {{radiation}} {{were found in}} an apartment building in Nihonmatsu, Fukushima, where the foundation was made using concrete containing crushed stone collected from a quarry near the troubled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, situated inside the evacuation-zone. Of the 12 households living there were 10 households relocated <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>quake.</b> After inspection at the quarry – situated inside the evacuation-zone around the nuclear plant—in the town of Namie, Fukushima between 11 and 40 microsieverts of radiation per hour were detected one meter above gravel held at eight storage sites in the open, while 16 to 21 microsieverts were detected in three locations covered by roofs. From this place about 5,200 metric tons of gravel was shipped from this place and used as building material. On 21 January 2012 the association of quarry agents in the prefecture Fukushima asked its members to voluntarily check their products for radioactivity to ease public concerns over radioactive contamination of building materials. The minister of Industry Yukio Edano did instruct TEPCO to pay compensation for the economical damages. Raised radiation levels were found on many buildings constructed <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>quake.</b> Schools, private houses, roads. Because of the public anger raised by these finds. the government of Nihonmatsu, Fukushima decided to examine all 224 city construction projects started <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>quake.</b> Some 200 construction companies received stone from the Namie-quarry, and the material was used in at least 1000 building-sites. The contaminated stone was found in some 49 houses and apartments. Radiation levels of 0.8 mSv per hour were found, almost {{as high as the}} radiation levels outside the homes. None of these represents a potential danger to human health.|$|E
25|$|Over 7,000 schoolrooms {{collapsed}} {{in the course of}} the earthquake, mostly in rural areas, reportedly leading to the death of nearly 5,000 students (though some parents believe the real figure is twice that officially cited) and the injury of over 15,000 students. The total death toll of the quake was around 70,000 people, with some 375,000 injuries. A month <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>quake,</b> nearly 20,000 people remained missing, while five million were rendered homeless.|$|E

50|$|A day <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>quakes,</b> {{more than}} 36,000 {{people had been}} given {{emergency}} shelter, and the Iranian government had dispatched nearly 100 ambulances, 1,100 Red Crescent workers, 44,000 food packages and 5,600 tents. According to Red Crescent officials, more than 1,000 villages were affected by the disaster, and at least 5,000 people were injured. Hospitals in the region's major cities were overcrowded and struggling {{to cope with the}} large number of people waiting for treatment.|$|R

25|$|The {{processing}} of collective trauma soon {{became an important}} theme in Murakami's writing, which had previously been more personal in nature. Murakami returned to Japan {{in the aftermath of}} the Kobe earthquake and the Aum Shinrikyo gas attack. He came to terms with these events with his first work of non-fiction, Underground, and the short story collection <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>quake.</b> Underground consists largely of interviews of victims of the gas attacks in the Tokyo subway system.|$|E
25|$|Some {{ten days}} <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>quake,</b> reports {{began to emerge}} of {{incidents}} of looting and theft in quake and tsunami-hit areas. By 20 March 2011, 250 thefts, with ¥4.9 million (US$43 thousand) in merchandise stolen from stores and ¥5.8 million (US$52 thousand) in cash, were reported to the Miyagi Prefectural Police. Witnesses reported thieves stealing cash and bank books from smashed houses, looting goods from stores, and siphoning gas from abandoned or damaged vehicles. Around ¥40 million (US$358 thousand) was reportedly stolen from a bank in Kesennuma, Miyagi.|$|E
25|$|Over 20 {{workers had}} been injured by 18 March, {{including}} one who was exposed to {{a large amount of}} ionizing radiation when the worker tried to vent vapour from a valve of the containment building. Three more workers were exposed to radiation over 100mSv, and two of them were sent to a hospital due to beta burns on 24 March. Two other workers, Kazuhiko Kokubo, 24, and Yoshiki Terashima, 21, were killed by the tsunami while conducting emergency repairs immediately <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>quake.</b> Their bodies were found on 30 March.|$|E

50|$|Sixty-six {{rescue teams}} {{were sent to}} the {{affected}} region, along with about 200 ambulances and five helicopters. 130 villages were 70-90% destroyed, and 20 were completely leveled. At least 45 people died and more than 500 were injured in Ahar, where electricity and phone lines were cut <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>quakes.</b> More than 40 people died in the city of Varzaqan and 50 were killed in Heris. The medical infrastructure in the catastrophe stricken region is not sufficient, and many heavily injured did not survive the rather long way to the nearest hospital.|$|R
50|$|With the Voyager crew {{returned}} and on Otrin's signal, they launch photon torpedoes that will explode {{in the atmosphere}} with the nanoprobes, which will start a chain reaction to restore the planet. The chain reaction causes {{a great deal of}} seismic activity, frightening Verin into a panic and causing him to try to initiate the planetary defense systems to destroy Voyager. Otrin and his people stop him in time. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>quakes</b> have subsided, Otrin and his people look outside onto a beautiful sunny day, the signs of nuclear winter eradicated.|$|R
25|$|Many more {{heart attacks}} than usual were {{reported}} {{in the days following}} the quake. Usually the heart unit at Christchurch Hospital handles two to three heart attacks a day, but the rate had risen to eight to ten a day since the earthquake. A record number of babies for a Saturday were born at Christchurch Women's Hospital in the twenty-four hours <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>quake,</b> with the first baby arriving six minutes after the initial shock. This was at least in part due to outlying birthing centres being closed, pending structural checks, forcing more mothers to deliver at hospitals than was generally the case.|$|E
25|$|All the {{buildings}} suffered damage {{but along with}} the collapsed Nuevo León building, buildings such as those called Veracruz, Coahuila, Zacatecas, Oaxaca, Puebla, Jalisco, Churubusco, Guelatao, 2 de Abril, 15 de Septiembre, Chihuahua, Tamaulipas, ISSSTE 11, Querétaro, Guanajuato, Ignacio Comonfort, Ignacio M. Altamirano, Jesús Terán, Ponciano Arriaga, Niños Héroes and 20 de Noviembre suffered severe damage such as severely cracked foundations. In the days <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>quake,</b> military and police cordoned off ten buildings to keep people out, leading {{a number of them}} to sleep on the streets. Twelve buildings in the complex were so severely damaged that they were demolished in the next six months.|$|E
25|$|Societé Nationale des Transports Ferrovaires, Algeria's {{state-owned}} railway company, suffered track damage {{near the}} town of Thénia. Some tracks were also blocked by debris of destroyed buildings. Eighteen bridges in the affected region had minor to moderate damage. Cracks developed in some roads and highways. The port of Algiers, which at that time handled approximately 40% of the national cargo traffic, suffered light to moderate damage due to soil liquefaction and settlement caused by the earthquake. Port operations was reportedly reduced by 30% immediately <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>quake.</b> The minor ports in Zemmouri and Dellys received little damage. The airport control tower and terminal were moderately damaged.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the reasons}} for this was the high {{probability}} of aftershocks (over 50 percent according to the USGS). Just weeks <b>after</b> <b>the</b> first <b>quake,</b> <b>the</b> region was rattled again by a 7.3 magnitude quake and there were also many considerable aftershocks.|$|R
