500|$|After Heppner {{introduced}} his bandmates to progressive rock, the band integrated minor influences from the genre in their songwriting and compositions, including touches of keyboards, while {{trying not to}} deviate too much {{from the sound of}} Hello Master. The change in style was largely adopted so they could challenge themselves musically, but not specifically to be heavier: [...] "I don't think we go in wanting to write a heavier record," [...] guitarist Dan Watchorn stated. [...] "I don't think we have a preconceived notion of what we want, the riffs and melodies just kind of come. The fact that Hello Master was a bit more on the poppy side and Prior to the Fire has a bit more edge to it is just where we're <b>at</b> <b>right</b> <b>now</b> with music." [...] Of the end result, drummer Vince Nudo said, [...] "Our individual tastes came out more [...] [...] It's more organic. We're not holding back so much." ...|$|E
500|$|Although West {{designed}} it as a melancholic pop album, 808s & Heartbreak {{had a significant}} effect on hip hop music. While his decision to sing about love, loneliness, and heartache for the entirety of the album was at first heavily criticized by music audiences and the album predicted to be a flop, its subsequent [...] critical acclaim and commercial success encouraged other mainstream rappers to take greater creative risks with their music. During the release of The Blueprint 3, New York rap mogul Jay-Z revealed that his next studio album would be an experimental effort, stating, [...] "... it's not gonna be a #1 album. That's where I'm <b>at</b> <b>right</b> <b>now.</b> I wanna make the most experimental album I ever made." [...] Jay-Z elaborated that like West, he was unsatisfied with contemporary hip hop, was being inspired by indie-rockers like Grizzly Bear and asserted his belief that the indie rock movement would {{play an important role in}} the continued evolution of hip hop.|$|E

[...] Bruna Nessif of E! Online shortly commented that Bieber [...] "is not a little boy anymore" [...] in the music video for the song.

500|$|The {{show was}} {{announced}} in late 2004 as a mid-season replacement for Boston Legal. It was originally scheduled {{to run in the}} Boston Legal time slot for just four weeks, but after receiving high ratings remained in the time slot {{for the remainder of the}} season. ABC Entertainment President Steve McPherson commented on the scheduling decision: [...] "Ultimately we decided that, without having adequate lead time or marketing dollars to devote to moving either show so late in the season, we'd continue to let 'Grey's' build on its tremendous momentum through May." [...] Prior to broadcast, it was announced that the show's title would change from Grey's Anatomy to Complications, although ultimately this did not come to pass. Francie Calfo, executive vice president for development at ABC Entertainment, commented on the show's conception: [...] "I think there was a need for this kind of show on our air, specifically a medical show. And Shonda found a twist on it that made it perfect for where we're <b>at</b> <b>right</b> <b>now.</b> Medical shows are hard, and it was hard trying to figure out where ours could be different. But where everybody else is speeding up their medical shows, she found a way to slow it down, so you get to know the characters. There's definitely a strong female appeal to it." [...] Rhimes explained that she had found the idea of a show about smart women competing against one another an interesting one.|$|E
500|$|According to Billboard, In the Zone marks {{a musical}} {{departure}} for Spears. Instead of traditional pop, {{the album is}} darker and more dance-oriented. Spears talked about the overall sound of the album with Rolling Stone, saying, [...] "I'd describe it as trance-y, kind of vibe record—something you could listen to that's no so song-structured [...] Of course I'm not doing '...Baby One More Time' and those massive hits anymore. I think this record is where I am <b>at</b> <b>right</b> <b>now</b> in my life. It's sensual, it's sexual. I'm probably writing about that subconsciously because I don't have that right now." [...] Amy Schriefer of NPR stated the album {{is a mix of}} dance, house, crunk, Diwali beats, reggae and hip hop. According to William Shaw of Blender, the main theme of In the Zone is [...] "Spears’s awakening to her sexuality as a single woman." [...] The first single from the album, [...] "Me Against the Music", [...] features Madonna, but was constructed as a duet after she was added to the track. Spears and Madonna trade lines during the verses, and Madonna sings solo in the bridge. The instrumentation in the song includes influences of hip hop and funk guitars. The song's lyrics feature Spears and Madonna singing of the pleasures of letting go on the dancefloor, in [...] "I'm up against the speaker / Trying to take on the music / It's like a competition". The second song, [...] "I Got That (Boom Boom)", is an Atlanta-style hip hop track featuring the Ying Yang Twins.|$|E
500|$|Pinkner {{thought the}} added musical element {{improved}} the episode, {{because it gave}} insights into each of the characters' psyches. According to Wyman and Pinkner, the [...] "episode {{was supposed to be}} a fantastical episode in the first place, and so the music supports the storytelling". Wyman continued in a different interview with the Los Angeles Times that [...] "Noirs traditionally are morality tales, and that's kind of what we're doing. We felt that that was a great way to get across Walter's mind frame and where his head is <b>at</b> <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> with his son missing". Other cast members also praised the added music. John Noble wrote [...] "It really deepened and blew the episode out even further in the direction we were already taking. We get [...] fractured take on the world and his condition now that Peter has left. The music really supports the storytelling". He added, [...] "It is like a mind-trip of Walter's. It is Walter trying to grapple with the fact that his son is gone". Jasika Nicole continued: [...] "I have a musical theater background, so I've been waiting for some moment in some realm of where I am in TV and film for this to happen and, you know, of course, when Glee came on the air I was like, 'Great, that was my chance,' and I'm in this show, which I love this show, but I'm never going to sing and dance in this show. And I did! It's so awesome!" [...] Swerling called it [...] "the longest and possibly most difficult episode of the season" [...] to create.|$|E

As worded by Mawuse Ziegbe from MTV, [...] " [...] spit the first verse with his signature unhinged energy, asserting his return to the live-television circuit. Em helmed the rest of the song, nimbly dropping his lyrics with abandon." [...] Eminem wore a black jacket and a cap, while Lil Wayne wore a white T-shirt. The performance also included other songs by each of the artists, such as [...] "6 Foot 7 Foot" [...] performed by Lil Wayne and [...] "Won't Back Down" [...] performed by Eminem.
