40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{analysis of}} the noise spectra of closed-loop mode-matched vibratory gyros. Closed-form expressions for the noise-equivalent angular rate spectrum {{as well as the}} integrated angular rate (angle) variance are derived to explore the effects of modal frequency mismatch, closed-loop bandwidth, and the spectra of noise sources appearing at the sensor's input and output. It is shown that noise sources located at the output of the sensor's electromechanical transfer function create angle white noise in the closed-loop sensor. The angle white noise dominates the integrated rate behavior until it crosses the <b>angle</b> <b>random</b> <b>walk</b> asymptote at integration times exceeding the sensor's open-loop time constant. Even though the closed-loop sensor asymptotically recovers the <b>angle</b> <b>random</b> <b>walk</b> figure associated with the mode-matched open-loop sensor, the results can be used to quantify the larger integrated rate variance that is produced as a consequence of extending the sensor's bandwidth through feedback. A parameter, called the effective bandwidth, is introduced to capture the relative importance of the input noise versus output noise in determining the noise-equivalent rate spectrum. It is shown that the rate noise spectrum is robust to frequency mismatch {{as long as it does}} not exceed the effective bandwidth parameter. Empirical data obtained with a high performance MEMS vibratory gyro shows excellent agreement with the model predictions for a variety of sensor configurations including frequency-matched, frequency-mismatched, modified bandwidth, and manipulated input noise intensity cases. © 2013 IEEE...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} an optimal {{quadrature}} error correction method for the dual-mass MEMS gyroscope, {{in order to}} reduce the long term bias drift. It is known that the coupling stiffness and demodulation error are important elements causing bias drift. The coupling stiffness in dual-mass structures is analyzed. The experiment proves that the left and right masses’ quadrature errors are different, and the quadrature correction system should be arranged independently. The process leading to quadrature error is proposed, and the Charge Injecting Correction (CIC), Quadrature Force Correction (QFC) and Coupling Stiffness Correction (CSC) methods are introduced. The correction objects of these three methods are the quadrature error signal, force and the coupling stiffness, respectively. The three methods are investigated through control theory analysis, model simulation and circuit experiments, and the results support the theoretical analysis. The bias stability results based on CIC, QFC and CSC are 48 °/h, 9. 9 °/h and 3. 7 °/h, respectively, and this value is 38 °/h before quadrature error correction. The CSC method is proved to be the better method for quadrature correction, and it improves the <b>Angle</b> <b>Random</b> <b>Walking</b> (ARW) value, increasing it from 0. 66 °/√h to 0. 21 °/√h.
