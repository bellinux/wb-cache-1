5|$|Himalayan salt is Pakistan's {{best known}} rock salt. It {{is used for}} cooking, as bath salt, as brine and as a raw {{material}} for many industries, including a soda ash plant set up by AkzoNobel in 1940. Salt from Khewra mine {{is also used to}} make decorative items like lamps, vases, <b>ashtrays</b> and statues, which are exported to the United States, India and many European countries. The use of rock salt to make artistic and decorative items started during the Mughal era, when many craftsman made tableware and decorations from it. Warth introduced the use of a lathe to cut out art pieces from the rock salt, as he found it similar to gypsum in physical characteristics.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, the McCartney {{family moved}} {{for the last}} time to a small three-bedroomed brick-built terrace house at 20 Forthlin Road in Allerton, which is now owned by The National Trust. It only cost £1:6s:0d per week, which was due to Mary's {{seniority}} at the hospital. Before moving to Forthlin Road, Jim had been secretary of the Speke Horticultural Society, and had often sent his sons out to canvass for new members. Jim planted dahlias and snapdragons in the front garden of Forthlin Road and regularly trimmed the lavender hedge, although it was Paul's job to collect horse manure from the local streets in a bucket to be dug into the flowerbeds. As Jim was a heavy smoker, Jim would first dry and then crush sprigs of Lavender and then burn them (like incense) in the <b>ashtrays</b> to kill the smell of his cigarette smoke.|$|E
25|$|The Kennedy {{administration}} {{was the first}} to permit smoking in rooms on the State floor. To accommodate smoking, Jacqueline Kennedy wanted portable <b>ashtrays</b> for the East Room. She initially considered modified versions of <b>ashtrays</b> seen at the home of her friend, Bunny Mellon, but rejected this idea in favor of a unique design. Maison Jansen designed stands which featured brass legs shaped like bamboo, brass handles, and Carrara glass tops. The <b>ashtrays</b> cost $280, were manufactured in Maison Jansen's New York City office, and delivered in January 1963. Finding the cost too high (and without any economy of scale cost-savings), Kennedy then designed her own portable standing <b>ashtrays.</b> Twenty were eventually manufactured out of dark wood by White House carpenters, although the gray granite tops for the Kennedy-designed <b>ashtrays</b> were made by Jansen at a cost of $310.|$|E

50|$|<b>Ashtray</b> visits Dashiki {{where they}} engage in sexual {{intercourse}} and Tray impregnates Dashiki. Feeling like he's not responsible enough to be the father, Dashiki kicks him out. Someone from Toothpicks posse threatens <b>Ashtray,</b> Loc Dog, Preach, and Crazy Legs. Loc Dog knocks him out as he and Preach proceed to stomp him, flattening him (literally). The quartet decides to get protection from their friend Old School (Antonio Fargas). This tactic fails as Toothpick performs another drive-by and Crazy Legs is injured. With Crazy Legs hospitalized, himself and Loc Dog being arrested, and the Korean store shooting, Tray decides to confront Dashiki and be the father. Dashiki agrees to give Tray another try and they decide to leave the hood as planned. <b>Ashtray</b> and Loc Dog talk about <b>Ashtray's</b> departure as Toothpick and his posse prepare for another drive-by and he and Loc Dog clash as <b>Ashtray</b> flees and trips and is knocked out as Loc and Toothpick continue to shoot at each other. They are saved when Grandma pops out of the dumpster and shoots Toothpick's car as Toothpick is flung out and he lands on a cop car. Preach and Dashiki find <b>Ashtray</b> hurt and he regains consciousness and kisses Dashiki. A woman finds Toothpick (who {{turns out to be}} his mother) and beats him with his shoe for stealing from her in the past.|$|R

25|$|Mrs. Columbo, a {{spin-off}} TV series starring Kate Mulgrew, {{aired in}} 1979 and was canceled after only thirteen episodes. Lt. Columbo was never seen on Mrs. Columbo; each episode featured the resourceful Mrs. Columbo solving a murder mystery she encountered {{in her work}} as a newspaper reporter. Connections with the original Columbo series were made obvious: the glaring presence of Columbo's car in the driveway, Dog, and Mrs. Columbo emptying <b>ashtrays</b> containing the famous green cigar butts—all featured in the show's opening sequence. References were also made to Kate's husband being a police lieutenant.|$|E

25|$|Sometime {{during the}} day on New Year's Eve 1977, Fossey's {{favorite}} gorilla, Digit, was killed by poachers. As the sentry of study group 4, he defended the group against six poachers and their dogs, who ran across the gorilla study group while checking antelope traplines. Digit took five spear wounds in ferocious self-defence and managed to kill one of the poachers' dogs, allowing the other 13 members of his group to escape. Poachers sell gorilla hands as delicacies, magic charms or to make ash trays. Digit was decapitated, and his hands cut off for <b>ashtrays,</b> {{for the price of}} $20. After his mutilated body was discovered by research assistant Ian Redmond, Fossey's group captured one of the killers. He revealed the names of his five accomplices, three of whom were later imprisoned.|$|E
25|$|There {{have long}} been tales of hauntings at The Grotto, mainly {{relating}} to a smuggler named John the Jibber who was reputedly murdered by his fellow criminals after selling information to HM Customs. It is {{said that he was}} hung in a barrel in a cave close to the present lift shaft and left to starve. Until the pub was sold by Vaux, it was said that the landlord would leave out a special tankard of ale each night after closing and, in the morning, it would be empty. Local DJ and TV presenter, Alan Robson drank from the tankard during one of his live Metro Radio shows, allegedly sparking off a series of supernatural phenomena that eventually forced the then landlord to quit. This included flying <b>ashtrays</b> smashing against the wall and flooding in the cellar after all the beer taps were inexplicably turned on. Unfortunately the original tankard was lost during refurbishment. A replacement is on display, but is no longer filled up each night for the ghost. The pub was also the venue for a uktv investigation in 2001, where paranormal researchers claimed to have identified at least seven different spirits.|$|E
