Thus, it is recommended that HIV be considered in people presenting an unexplained fever who may have risk factors for the infection.|$|E

5|$|People {{sometimes}} suspected vampirism when a cadaver did {{not look}} as they thought a normal corpse should when disinterred. Rates of decomposition vary depending on temperature and soil composition, {{and many of the}} signs are little known.

5|$|Critical {{response}} to Billie was mixed; some critics {{felt that she}} was a strong addition to Charmed while others cited Cuoco's acting and the character's story arc with Christy <b>as</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> the show's declining quality. After speculation about Billie's possible appearance in a spin-off series, it was confirmed all future plans for the show were canceled following The WB's closure to launch The CW. Cuoco later said that she prefer working on sitcoms over dramatic television shows due to demanding shooting schedule that she experienced while working on Charmed.|$|E
5|$|The FEFAP field surveys, {{excavations}} and exhumations spanned {{more than}} 10years. The {{results of this}} study from King William Island and Beechey Island artefacts and human remains showed that the Beechey Island crew had most likely died of pneumonia and perhaps tuberculosis, which was suggested by the evidence of Pott's disease discovered in Braine. Toxicological reports pointed to lead poisoning as a likely contributing factor. Blade cut marks found on bones from some of the crew were seen <b>as</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> cannibalism. Evidence suggested that a combination of cold, starvation and disease including scurvy, pneumonia and tuberculosis, all made worse by lead poisoning, killed everyone in the Franklin party.|$|E

5|$|Astrology {{has been}} dated {{to at least}} the 2nd {{millennium}} BCE, with roots in calendrical systems used to predict seasonal shifts and to interpret celestial cycles <b>as</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> divine communications. A form of astrology was practised in the first dynasty of Mesopotamia (1950–1651 BCE). Chinese astrology was elaborated in the Zhou dynasty (1046–256 BCE). Hellenistic astrology after 332 BCE mixed Babylonian astrology with Egyptian Decanic astrology in Alexandria, creating horoscopic astrology. Alexander the Great's conquest of Asia allowed astrology to spread to Ancient Greece and Rome. In Rome, astrology was associated with 'Chaldean wisdom'. After the conquest of Alexandria in the 7th century, astrology was taken up by Islamic scholars, and Hellenistic texts were translated into Arabic and Persian. In the 12th century, Arabic texts were imported to Europe and translated into Latin. Major astronomers including Tycho Brahe, Johannes Kepler and Galileo practised as court astrologers. Astrological references appear in literature {{in the works of}} poets such as Dante Alighieri and Geoffrey Chaucer, and of playwrights such as Christopher Marlowe and William Shakespeare.|$|E
5|$|Astrology is {{the study}} of the {{movements}} and relative positions of celestial objects as a means for divining information about human affairs and terrestrial events. Astrology has been dated to at least the 2nd millennium BCE, and has its roots in calendrical systems used to predict seasonal shifts and to interpret celestial cycles <b>as</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> divine communications. Many cultures have attached importance to astronomical events, and some – such as the Indians, Chinese, and Maya – developed elaborate systems for predicting terrestrial events from celestial observations. Western astrology, one of the oldest astrological systems still in use, can trace its roots to 19th–17th century BCE Mesopotamia, from which it spread to Ancient Greece, Rome, the Arab world and eventually Central and Western Europe. Contemporary Western astrology is often associated with systems of horoscopes that purport to explain aspects of a person's personality and predict significant events in their lives based on the positions of celestial objects; the majority of professional astrologers rely on such systems.|$|E
5|$|Clinicians {{assess the}} {{physical}} aspects {{such as the}} appearance of a patient, including apparent age, height, weight, and manner of dress and grooming. Colorful or bizarre clothing might suggest mania, while unkempt, dirty clothes might suggest schizophrenia or depression. If the patient appears much older than his or her chronological age this can suggest chronic poor self-care or ill-health. Clothing and accessories of a particular subculture, body modifications, or clothing not typical of the patient's gender, might give clues to personality. Observations of physical appearance might include the physical features of alcoholism or drug abuse, such <b>as</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> malnutrition, nicotine stains, dental erosion, a rash around the mouth from inhalant abuse, or needle track marks from intravenous drug abuse. Observations can also include any odor which might suggest poor personal hygiene due to extreme self-neglect, or alcohol intoxication. Weight loss could also signify a depressive disorder, physical illness, anorexia nervosa or chronic anxiety.|$|E

5|$|In 1981, {{a team of}} {{scientists}} led by Owen Beattie, a professor of anthropology at the University of Alberta, began a series of scientific studies of the graves, bodies, and other physical evidence left by Franklin's men on Beechey Island and King William Island. They concluded that the men buried on Beechey Island most likely died of pneumonia and perhaps tuberculosis, and that lead poisoning may have worsened their health, owing to badly soldered cans held in the ships' food stores. However, it was later suggested that the source of this lead may not have been tinned food, but the distilled water systems fitted to the ships. Cut marks on human bones found on King William Island were seen <b>as</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> cannibalism. The combined evidence of all studies suggested that the crewmen did not all die quickly. Hypothermia, starvation, lead poisoning and diseases including scurvy, along with general exposure to a hostile environment whilst lacking adequate clothing and nutrition, killed everyone on the expedition in the years following its last sighting by Europeans in 1845.|$|E
5|$|The {{picture of}} Elizabeth painted by her Protestant admirers {{of the early}} 17th century has proved lasting and influential. Her memory was also revived during the Napoleonic Wars, when the nation again found itself {{on the brink of}} invasion. In the Victorian era, the Elizabethan legend was adapted to the {{imperial}} ideology of the day, and in the mid-20th century, Elizabeth was a romantic symbol of the national resistance to foreign threat. Historians of that period, such as J. E. Neale (1934) and A. L. Rowse (1950), interpreted Elizabeth's reign as a golden age of progress. Neale and Rowse also idealised the Queen personally: she always did everything right; her more unpleasant traits were ignored or explained <b>as</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> stress.|$|E
5|$|In January 2011, Gannon was one {{of three}} {{candidates}} reported to have impressed in interviews for the vacant Port Vale job, making him one of the favourites for the position. However, Paul Simpson's dismissal at Stockport County led to hopes of a return to the club for some County fans. Therefore, he was installed as the bookies favourite to become the next Port Vale manager, and also the bookie's favourite for the Stockport job. Gannon was confirmed as the manager of Port Vale on 6 January 2011, succeeding Micky Adams {{at the helm of the}} promotion chasing club, signing a contract that lasted until summer 2012. Saying that finishing outside of the top seven would be a failure, the Cheshire-based manager's first task after 'burying the hatchet' with Gareth Owen was to look for a new striker. Two weeks into his reign club captain Tommy Fraser left the club by mutual consent, <b>as</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> what would be an unhappy relationship between club and manager quickly came to the surface. Gannon then brought in Romaine Sawyers and Kayleden Brown on loan from West Bromwich Albion, Jay O'Shea on loan from Birmingham City, Exodus Geohaghon on loan from Peterborough United, and striker Tom Pope on loan from Rotherham United.|$|E
