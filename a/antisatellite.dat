The ASAT program has since been moved from Program 640 to Program 863, the General Armaments Department and the State Administration for Science, Technology and Industry for National Defence (SASTIND, formerly known as Commission for Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense). Since its inception, the ASAT program has made progress {{on the development of}} three ASAT capable Systems: direct fire, directed-energy weapon, and microsatellites. Tests of these systems have either been directly acknowledged by the PRC, or reported on as ASAT capable.

40|$|Maneuvers {{available}} to a spacecraft having sufficient propellant to escape an <b>antisatellite</b> satellite (ASAT) attack are examined. The ASAT and the evading spacecraft are regarded as being in circular orbits, and equations of motion are developed for the ASAT to commence a two-impulse maneuver sequence. The ASAT employs thrust impulses which yield a minimum-time-to-rendezvous, considering available fuel. Optimal evasion is shown to involve only in-plane maneuvers, and begins {{as soon as the}} ASAT launch information is gathered and thrust activation can be initiated. A closest approach, along with a maximum evasion by the target spacecraft, is calculated to be 14, 400 ft.

At least 79 satellites have broken up in orbit to date and, in combination with exploded rocket casings and <b>antisatellite</b> debris, threaten 10 km/sec collisions with other orbiting platforms. Only 5 percent of the debris is connected to payloads. The total population of orbiting objects over 4 cm in diameter could number as high as 15, 000, and at 1 cm in diameter could be 32, 000, based on NASA and NORAD studies.

30|$|However, the {{two most}} {{well-known}} recent debris generating events occurred in 2009 and 2007. In 2009, the operational US Iridium 33 satellite collided with the nonoperational Russian Cosmos 2251 satellite at 790  km altitude and a closing velocity of greater than 11  km/sec, generating more than 2000 trackable debris objects. In 2007, the Chinese destroyed their nonoperational Fengyun- 1 C weather satellite during an <b>antisatellite</b> (ASAT) weapon test. While ASAT tests {{have been carried out}} by other nations as well, destruction of the Fengyun- 1 C propelled fragments from the nearly circular orbit of 845 × 865  km to orbits with a perigee and apogee range from 200 to 4000  km (NASA ODPO 2007). This event currently tops the list as the worst fragmentation event recorded as measured by the United States Space Surveillance Network (NASA APPEL 2012).

40|$|Man-made {{debris in}} low-Earth orbit (LEO) and {{the conduct of}} operations/procedures which leave debris in orbit are discussed. With {{continued}} deposition and larger vehicles and longer times on orbit for LEO operations, the probability of collisions between such vehicles and some member of the debris population becomes large. Because the collisions will occur at very large relative speeds, a small object which would not normally be considered a hazard might pose a lethal threat to an operating spacecraft. Future debris states must be deduced from an evaluation of many models using a Monte Carlo method for future deposition events. A model for the population evolution is presented and results of model calculations are discussed. Contributions to the population which {{may be expected to}} arise from on-orbit collisions and explosions are examined.

40|$|A {{qualitative}} {{criterion for}} a pursuer to intercept a target {{in a class}} of differential games is obtained in terms of future cones: Topological cones that contain all attainable trajectories of target or interceptor originating from an initial position. An interception solution exists after some initial time iff the future cone of the target lies within the future cone of the interceptor. The solution may be regarded as a kind of Nash equillibrium. This result is applied to two examples: 1. The game of Two Cars: The future cone condition is shown to be equivalent to conditions for interception obtained by Cockayne. ref 2 2. Satellite warfare: The future cone for a spacecraft or direct-ascent <b>antisatellite</b> weapon (ASAT) maneuvering in a central gravitational field is obtained and is shown to equal that for a spacecraft which maneuvers solely by means of a single velocity change at the cone vertex.

With events of September 11, 2001, and the war against Iraq dominating the headlines, the issue of national missile defense, and with it the larger issue of the control and weaponization of space, have receded from the front pages. However, the problem is imminent as the United States moves forward with Pentagon plans to develop "space control" and "global engagement" capabilities, which imply the deployment of weapons in space. If conflict over the use of space, or even actual conflict in space, is to be prevented or at least significantly constrained by general agreement, the international community will need to agree on permitted activity in space and more refined arrangements for distributing the benefits of that activity. Such a regime would be in the strong interest of commercial, scientific and military support constituencies worldwide. Without such agreement, space will largely be shaped by the short-term interests of power rather than the long-term interests of law...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{terrorist}} attacks of September 11, 2001, the War on Terror has affected US defense policy in lands as far flung as Afghanistan, Southeast Asia, and Iraq. Recently, President George W. Bush has expanded the scope of the War on Terror into a new area: space. On August 31, 2006, President Bush authorized the new National Space Policy (2 ̆ 2 NSP 062 ̆ 2), an assertion of the US 2 ̆ 7 s right to defend itself in outer space. In it, the US reserves the right to 2 ̆ 2 deny, if necessary, adversaries the use of space capabilities hostile to [US] interests. 2 ̆ 2 It also declares that 2 ̆ 2 [p]roposed arms control agreements must not impair the rights of the [US] to conduct [...] . activities in space for [US] national interests. 2 ̆ 2 The NSP 06 thus grants the US wide unilateral discretion to protect its national interests in space. Predictably, the international response has not been enthusiastic. A London Times editorial piece summed up the consensus view on the NSP 06 : 2 ̆ 2 SPACE: no longer the final frontier but the [fifty-first] state of the United States. 2 ̆ 23 Russia claims that the US 2 ̆ 2 want[s] to dictate to others who else is allowed to go there 2 ̆ 2 and has called the NSP 06 2 ̆ 2 the first step toward a serious deepening of the military confrontation in space. 2 ̆ 2 Meanwhile, China recently launched its first <b>antisatellite</b> missile in January 2007 in an apparent response to the US 2 ̆ 7 s increasingly assertive position in space. The US 2 ̆ 7 s aggressive assertion of space rights through the NSP 06 has spurred strong responses from China and Russia, the primary rivals of the US for space power. The NSP 06 may be unpopular, but is it illegal? This Development argues that it is not. Although a backdrop of international treaties requires peaceful, nonmilitary use of outer space and the moon, these treaties do not bar space regulation as proposed by the NSP 06. In addition, customary international law of space also suggests that the NSP 06 is legal. Section II grounds the NSP 06 in the historical context of space competition from the Cold War to the War on Terror, as well as in general national security policy since the September 11 th attacks. It further argues that the current space treaty regime does not invalidate the NSP 06. Section III analyzes the customary international law of space and posits that it also would not conflict with the NSP 06. Section IV concludes by investigating implications of the NSP 062 ̆ 7 s legality in light of current international politics...|$|E
40|$|Extravehicular Activity (EVA) spacesuits {{are a key}} {{enabling}} technology which allow astronauts to survive {{and work in the}} harsh environment of space. Of the entire spacesuit, the gloves may perhaps be considered the most difficult engineering design issue. A significant number of astronauts sustain hand and shoulder injuries during extravehicular activity (EVA) training and operations. In extreme cases these injuries lead to fingernail delamination (onycholysis) or rotator cuff tears and require medical or surgical intervention. In an effort to better understand the causal mechanisms of injury, a study consisting of modeling, statistical and experimental analyses was performed in section I of this thesis. A cursory musculoskeletal modeling tool was developed for use in comparing various spacesuit hard upper torso designs. The modeling effort focuses on optimizing comfort and range of motion of the shoulder joint within the suit. The statistical analysis investigated correlations between the anthropometrics of the hand and susceptibility to injury. A database of 192 male crewmembers' injury records and anthropometrics was sourced from NASA's Johnson Space Center. Hand circumference and width of the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint were found to be significantly associated with injuries by the Kruskal-Wallis test. Experimental testing was conducted to characterize skin blood flow and contact pressure inside the glove. This was done as part of NASA's effort to evaluate a hypothesis that fingernail delamination is caused by decreasing blood flow in the finger tips due to compression of the skin inside the extravehicular mobility unit (EMU) glove. The initial investigation consisted of a series of skin blood flow and contact pressure tests of the bare finger, and showed that blood flow decreased to approximately 60 % of baseline value with increasing force, however, this occurred more rapidly for finger pads (4 N) than for finger tips (ION). A gripping test of a pressure bulb using the bare hand was also performed at a moderate pressure of 13. 33 kPa (100 mmHg) and at a high pressure of 26. 66 kPa (200 mmHg), and showed that blood flow decreased 50 % and 45 %, respectively. Excessive hyperperfusion was observed for all tests following contact force or pressure, which may also contribute to the onset of delamination. Preliminary data from gripping tests inside the EMU glove in a hypobaric chamber at NASA's Johnson Space Center show that skin blood flow decreased by 45 % and 40 % when gripping at 3 moderate and high pressures, respectively. These tests show that finger skin blood flow is significantly altered by contact force/pressure, and that occlusion is more sensitive when it is applied to the finger pad than the finger tip. Our results indicate that the pressure on the finger pads required to articulate stiff gloves is more likely to impact blood flow than the pressure on the fingertips associated with tight or ill-fitting gloves. Improving the flexibility of the gloves will therefore not only benefit operational performance, but may also be an effective approach in reducing the incidence of finger injury. Space Policy Abstract EVA injury {{is only one of many}} dangers astronauts face in the extreme environment of space. Orbital debris presents a significant threat to astronaut safety and is a growing cause of concern. Since the dawn of satellites in the early 1950 's, space debris from intentionally exploded spacecraft, dead satellites, and on-orbit collisions has significantly increased and currently outnumbers operational space hardware. Adding to this phenomenon, the advent of commercial spaceflight and the recent space activities in China and India to establish themselves as spacefairing nations are bound to accelerate the rate of space debris accumulating in low Earth orbit, thus, exacerbating the problem. The policies regulating orbital debris were drafted in the 1960 s and 1970 s and fail to effectively address the dynamic nature of the debris problem. These policies are not legally enforced under international law and implementation is entirely voluntary. Space debris is a relevant issue in international space cooperation. Unless regulated, some projections indicate space debris will reach a point of critical density, after which the debris will grow exponentially, as more fragments are generated by collisions than are removed by atmospheric drag. Space debris proliferation negatively impacts human spaceflight safety, presents a hazard to orbiting space assets, and may lead to portions of near-Earth orbit becoming inaccessible, thus limiting mission operations. The aim of this research effort was to review current international space policy, legislation and mitigation strategies in light of two recent orbital collision episodes. The first is the February 2009 collision between a defunct Russian Cosmos spacecraft and a commercial Iridium satellite. The second is China's display of technological prowess during the January 2007 intentional demolition of its inactive Fengyun-IC weather satellite using a SC- 19 <b>antisatellite</b> (ASAT) missile. In each case the stakeholders, politics, policies, and consequences of the collision are analyzed. The results of this analysis as well as recommendations for alternative mitigation and regulatory strategies are presented. by Roedolph A. Opperman. Thesis (S. M.)
