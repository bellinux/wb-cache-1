5|$|The <b>American</b> <b>goldfinch</b> is not {{threatened}} by human activity, and is widespread throughout its range. The clearing of forests by humans, though harmful to many species, has benefited the <b>American</b> <b>goldfinch.</b> Clearing of woodlands causes declines in numbers of neotropical migrants, while favoring short-distance migrants and permanent residents. This benefits the <b>American</b> <b>goldfinch</b> {{both as a}} short-distance migrant, and because the created open areas are the preferred environment of the bird, where weeds thrive which produce the primary food source of the <b>American</b> <b>goldfinch.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>American</b> <b>goldfinch</b> {{does not}} act aggressively toward predators within its territory; its only {{reaction}} is alarm calling. Predators include snakes, weasels, squirrels, and blue jays, which may destroy eggs or kill young, and hawks and cats, which {{pose a threat}} to both young and adults. As of 2007, the oldest known <b>American</b> <b>goldfinch</b> was 10 years and 5 months old.|$|E
5|$|American goldfinches are {{occasionally}} {{victims of}} brood parasites, particularly brown-headed cowbirds. One {{study found that}} 9% of nests had brown-headed cowbird eggs in them. American goldfinches make very poor hosts for brood parasites, with studies showing low hatching rates of brown-headed cowbird eggs and no fledging success. This is {{despite the fact that}} the <b>American</b> <b>goldfinch</b> has no known behavioral adaptations against brood parasites. It is thought that the inability of brown-headed cowbird chicks to survive is due to a failure to get enough nutrition; the seed-rich diet of <b>American</b> <b>goldfinch</b> chicks varies from the usual insect-rich diet of other hosts.|$|E

50|$|Although {{the park}} is not {{scheduled}} for completion until 2035-37, the Parks Department reported that in 2010-11 two hundred different species of wildlife had {{been seen in the}} former landfill. These included red-winged blackbirds, <b>American</b> <b>goldfinches,</b> red-tailed hawks, <b>American</b> kestrels, osprey, ring-necked pheasants, tree swallows, turkey vultures, and northern snapping turtles.|$|R
5|$|<b>American</b> <b>goldfinches</b> lay {{four to six}} bluish-white eggs, {{which are}} oval in shape and about , {{roughly the size of}} a peanut. It is thought that they are laid during the night. The eggs are {{incubated}} by the female alone, though the male brings her food as she nests, and most mating pairs raise only one brood each year.|$|R
5|$|Attempts {{were made}} to {{introduce}} the <b>American</b> <b>goldfinch</b> into Bermuda in the 19th century, and Tahiti in 1938, but the species failed to become established.|$|E
5|$|Unlike some finch species, the <b>American</b> <b>goldfinch</b> {{uses its}} feet {{extensively}} in feeding. It frequently hangs from seedheads while feeding {{in order to}} reach the seeds more easily. In the spring, the <b>American</b> <b>goldfinch</b> feeds on the catkins hanging from birches and alders by pulling one up with its beak and using its toes to hold the catkin still against the branch. This dexterity enables it to take advantage of food sources relatively inaccessible to potential competitors, increasing its chances of survival.|$|E
5|$|Human {{activity}} has generally benefited the <b>American</b> <b>goldfinch.</b> It is {{often found in}} residential areas, attracted to bird feeders which increase its survival rate in these areas. Deforestation also creates open meadow areas which are its preferred habitat.|$|E
5000|$|Permanent avian {{residents}} of Reimert Memorial Bird Haven, near the Mountain Creek headwater, include red-bellied, downy, and hairy woodpeckers, and white-breasted nuthatches, black-capped chickadees, tufted titmice (commonly called [...] "warblers"), northern cardinals, blue jays, and non-native house finches. Common migrant birds include dark-eyed juncos, American robins, song sparrows, mourning doves, <b>American</b> <b>goldfinches,</b> purple finches, northern flickers, and hermit thrushes.|$|R
50|$|<b>American</b> <b>goldfinches</b> lay {{four to six}} bluish-white eggs, {{which are}} oval in shape and about 16 x 12 mm, {{roughly the size of}} a peanut.

50|$|The <b>American</b> <b>goldfinches</b> can be {{distinguished}} by the males having a black (rarely green) forehead, whereas the latter is (like {{the rest of the}} face) red or yellow in the European goldfinch and its relatives. North American males are markedly polymorphic and 5 subspecies are often named; at least 2 of them seem to represent a less-progressed stage in evolution however.|$|R
5|$|The <b>American</b> <b>goldfinch</b> (Spinus tristis) {{is a small}} North American bird in the finch family. It is migratory, {{ranging from}} mid-Alberta to North Carolina during the {{breeding}} season, and from {{just south of the}} Canada–United States border to Mexico during the winter.|$|E
5|$|The {{immature}} <b>American</b> <b>goldfinch</b> has a dull brown back, and {{the underside}} is pale yellow. The shoulders and tail are dull black with buff-colored, rather than white, markings on wings and rump. This coloration {{is the same}} in both genders.|$|E
5|$|The <b>American</b> <b>goldfinch</b> {{begins its}} {{breeding}} season {{later in the}} year than any other finch and later than any other native North American bird, besides occasionally the sedge wren. This {{may be related to the}} abundance of seeds in the late summer months, as seeds represent the majority of their diet.|$|E
50|$|For {{an added}} adventure, the Sioux Pass Marsh boardwalk is nearby and hikers can {{experience}} the scenic wetland first hand. There is a viewing tower for {{a bird's-eye view}} of the park. Birds are plentiful in the park, ranging from warblers to geese, to pelicans. Songs of catbirds, <b>American</b> <b>goldfinches</b> and yellow-headed blackbirds can be heard. St. Ambroise {{is also home to}} the endangered piping plover.|$|R

50|$|Wetland plants near ponds {{north and}} west of the lake include cattails and rushes that provide habitat for marsh birds such as red-winged blackbirds. Swallows are common in summer, and <b>American</b> <b>goldfinches</b> and other migratory birds visit the park in large number. Cottonwoods, alders, dogwoods, willows, and {{conifers}} grow in the park as do many shrubs including elderberries, spiraea, and Oregon-grape. The park is frequented by muskrats, voles, raccoons, and the occasional coyote.|$|R
5|$|The <b>American</b> <b>goldfinch</b> prefers {{open country}} where weeds thrive, such as fields, meadows, flood plains, {{as well as}} roadsides, orchards, and gardens. It may {{also be found in}} open {{deciduous}} and riparian woodlands and areas of secondary growth. This habitat preference continues during the spring and autumn migrations.|$|E
5|$|Megachilid bees of {{the genus}} Anthidium use the hair (amongst that of various woolly plants) in making their nests. The seeds are {{generally}} too small for birds to feed on, although the <b>American</b> <b>goldfinch</b> {{has been reported to}} consume them. Other bird species have been reported to consume the leaves (Hawaiian goose) or flowers (palila), or to use the plant as a source when foraging for insects (white-headed woodpecker).|$|E
5|$|The <b>American</b> <b>goldfinch</b> {{is found}} in {{residential}} areas throughout its range. Backyard birders attract it using feeders containing Nyjer thistle seed, or by planting grasses and perennial plants, such as zinnias, cosmos, bee balm, or globe thistle, which produce seedheads favored by finches. Although some controversy surrounds bird feeding (see bird feeder for details), an increase in backyard feeding by humans has generally been beneficial to this species.|$|E
5|$|Birds are {{the animals}} most {{often seen in}} the monument. Included {{among the more than}} 50 species {{observed}} are red-tailed hawks, American kestrels, great horned owls, common nighthawks, and great blue herons. Geese nest in the park each summer, and flocks of sandhill cranes and swans pass overhead each year on their migratory flights. California quail, chukar partridges, and mourning doves are also common. Others seen near the Cant Ranch and the visitor's center include rufous hummingbirds, Say's phoebe, yellow warblers, western meadowlarks, and <b>American</b> <b>goldfinches.</b> Visitors on trails may encounter canyon wrens, mountain bluebirds, mountain chickadees, black-billed magpies, and other birds.|$|R

5|$|The only finch in its {{subfamily}} {{to undergo}} a complete molt, the <b>American</b> <b>goldfinch</b> displays sexual dimorphism in its coloration; the male is a vibrant yellow {{in the summer and}} an olive color during the winter, while the female is a dull yellow-brown shade which brightens only slightly during the summer. The male displays brightly colored plumage during the breeding season to attract a mate.|$|E
5|$|The summer {{breeding}} range stretches across North America {{from coast to}} coast. It is bounded on the north by Saskatchewan and stretches south across North America to North Carolina on the east coast, and northern California on the west coast. The <b>American</b> <b>goldfinch</b> is a short-distance migrant, moving south in response to colder weather and lessened food supply. The migration is completed in compact flocks, which travel in an erratic, wavelike flight pattern.|$|E
5|$|The <b>American</b> <b>goldfinch</b> is a granivore {{and adapted}} for the {{consumption}} of seedheads, with a conical beak {{to remove the seeds}} and agile feet to grip the stems of seedheads while feeding. It is a social bird, and will gather in large flocks while feeding and migrating. It may behave territorially during nest construction, but this aggression is short-lived. Its breeding season is tied to the peak of food supply, beginning in late July, which is relatively late in the year for a finch. This species is generally monogamous, and produces one brood each year.|$|E

40|$|Houses Finches {{became a}} {{breeding}} species in Indiana in 1981 and subsequently {{went through a}} rapid population increase. This study was {{an investigation of the}} growth of the House Finch population and its impact on House Sparrows, <b>American</b> <b>Goldfinches</b> and Purple Finches in Indiana. Data from the Annual Christmas Bird Counts of the National Audubon Society (CBC) were used to construct five winter range maps to show the expansion of the House Finch population since 1940. A population density map based on the CBCs of 1988 and 1989 was constructed using birds counted per party hour. CBC data collected during 1965 to 1989 at twelve locations in Indiana were used to track long-term changes in the populations of House Finches, House Sparrows, <b>American</b> <b>Goldfinches</b> and Purple Finches. The number of House Finches counted in Indiana since 1981 increased dramatically. The size of the House Sparrow population appears to have been in a long-term decline for the last 25 years. However, <b>American</b> <b>Goldfinches</b> have, in general, increased in abundance since 1979. The abundance of Purple Finches in Indiana in the winter varies erratically. Observations at backyard feeding stations frequented by House Finches and House Sparrows show that House Finches tend to displace other House Finches more often than would be expected if the displacements occurred in proportion to the frequency at which the birds appear in the population. House Sparrows were found to displace other House Sparrows at a rate which greatly exceeded the expected frequency based on their proportion of the population. Both species tend to avoid interspecific interactions. Field studies in Muncie, Indiana show that House Finches commonly nest in shrubbery and building decorations while House Sparrows often nest in crevices in old buildings and bird houses. No direct competition for nesting sites was observed. Banding studies indicate that during the fall and winter there is a constant turnover of House Finches in Muncie. Using banding data from the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service it was found that House Finches in the Midwest tend to travel in a southern direction as the season changes from summer to winter and in a northern direction as the season changes from winter to summer. The study shows that House Finches have a strong propensity to return to the same general area each summer. Department of BiologyThesis (D. Ed. ...|$|R
5|$|The {{courtship}} {{rituals of}} the <b>American</b> <b>goldfinch</b> include aerial maneuvers and singing by males, who begin courtship in late July. The flight displays begin as the male pursues the female, who flies in zigzagging evasive patterns. The male {{is able to}} signal his quality and fitness, both {{in the short term}} (current body condition) and long term (genes), through ornamentation (bill color and plumage). If a female accepts the male as a mate, the pair will fly in wide circles, as the male warbles throughout the flight.|$|E
5|$|The <b>American</b> <b>goldfinch</b> is a diurnal feeder. According to the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, {{the species}} {{is one of the}} strictest vegetarians in the bird world. It is mainly granivorous, but will {{occasionally}} eat insects, which are also fed to its young to provide protein. Its diet consists of the seeds {{from a wide variety of}} annual plants, often those of weeds, grasses, and trees, such as thistle, teasel, dandelion, ragweed, mullein, cosmos, goatsbeard, sunflower, and alder. However, it also consumes tree buds, maple sap, and berries. It will eat at bird feeders provided by humans, particularly in the winter months, preferring Niger seed (commonly and erroneously called thistle seed).|$|E
5|$|The <b>American</b> <b>goldfinch</b> {{undergoes}} a molt {{in the spring}} and autumn. It is the only cardueline finch to undergo a molt twice a year. During the winter molt it sheds all its feathers; in the spring, it sheds all but the wing and tail feathers, which are dark brown in the female and black in the male. The markings on these feathers remain through each molt, with bars on the wings and white under and {{at the edges of the}} short, notched tail. The sexual dimorphism displayed in plumage coloration is especially pronounced after the spring molt, when the bright color of the male's summer plumage is needed to attract a mate.|$|E
50|$|Most, but {{not always}} all, birds leave northern, central, and inland {{southern}} California in winter. They move into the coastal lowlands and into the lower parts of the southeastern California deserts, ranging irregularly (sometimes in large numbers) southeastward to northern Sonora and northwestern Chihuahua and eastward to the southern half of Arizona, southwestern New Mexico, and even the area of El Paso, Texas—roughly the Madrean Sky Islands region. In some winters mysteriously few birds are observed; possibly the birds are in Sonora and Chihuahua, which are poorly covered by naturalists. The greatest eastward irruptions often occur in wet periods and are synchronized with irruptions of other seedeating birds such as the red-breasted nuthatch, the red crossbill, and the other North <b>American</b> <b>goldfinches.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract Preening {{behavior}} in birds {{is important for}} the main-tenance of thermoregulatory and ornamental functions of plum-age. It has been repeatedly demonstrated that birds trade off time between plumage maintenance and other activities. However, the condition-dependent constraints of preening re-main virtually unstudied. Here, we present the first experimen-tal test of the hypothesis that intestinal parasite infection impairs preening activity. We studied male <b>American</b> <b>goldfinches</b> (Spinus tristis), a species with carotenoid-based plumage col-oration. Following pre-alternate (spring) molt, we manipulated the health of males by infecting some birds with Isospora spp. coccidia and keeping others free of the infection. Although the goldfinches increased preening throughout the captive period, we found no significant effect of coccidial treatment on preening behavior. The effect of coccidia on plumage mainte-nancemay bemore pronounced under natural conditions where birds have limited access to food and engage in more activities that might limit time available for preening...|$|R
40|$|Advisor: Muir EatonElaborate and/or {{colorful}} bird plumages {{have often}} been hypothesized to evolve via sexual selection for increased ornamentation. Differences in coloration among individuals can be influenced {{by a number of}} variables, including diet, hormones, and disease resistance. Specifically, Hamilton and Zuk 22 (1892) hypothesized a link between an individual’s parasite resistance and more colorful plumage signals, as a mechanism for individuals to advertise their ‘quality’. While much data has accumulated documenting the nutritional and hormonal regulation of various types of plumage coloration, relatively little data exists reporting the effects of parasite load on individual plumage colors (i. e. melanin and carotenoid pigmented feathers). We collected ectoparasites and plumage color data from 24 purple finches (Carpodacus purpureus), 11 pine siskins (Carduelis pinus), and 21 <b>American</b> <b>goldfinches</b> (Carduelis tristis). We found substantial individual variation in both total parasite load and quantified measures of feather coloration, and we report on the association between these variables among individuals within each species.
