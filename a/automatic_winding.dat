40|$|Abstract — In this work, an <b>automatic</b> <b>wind</b> turbine identifica-tion {{scheme was}} developed, with a {{restriction}} that only Level-II data are available. The motivation is to minimize modification {{to the existing}} data processing infrastructure of the WSR- 88 D. The concept is to process several consecutive scans of images and look for features that move. This was accomplished by processing a set of six running-temporal textures, which are derived from the moment data, to find temporal continuity. A fuzzy logic inference system is used to combine information from the six textures to make a final decision of detection. Preliminary results {{will be presented to}} demonstrate the potential of this algorithm. I...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{presented}} model (called WITRA) is to use {{the data}} of the <b>automatic</b> <b>wind</b> stations on the Swiss Plateau as a basis for calculating back-trajectories over a complex terrain. WITRA interpolates a three-dimensional windfield out of the measured data and the radio-sonde profile of Payerne. By a mathematical method developed by SASAKI (1958) based on the variational analysis and with regard to its application to the investigated problem by SHERMAN (1978), the windfield is slightly adjusted in a least-square sense in order to get it free of divergence, i. e. mass-consistent. Within the same step the complex terrain and its effects on the wind are taken into account. Trajectories can be calculated by a method mentioned by PETTERSSEN (1956) using a sequence of these windfields...|$|R

40|$|Airport {{surveillance}} radars (ASR) utilize a broad, cosecant-squared elevation beam pattern, rapid azimuthal antenna scanning, {{and coherent}} pulsed-Doppler processing to detect. and track approaching and departing aircraft. These radars, because of location, rapid scan rate, and direct {{air traffic control}} (ATe) data link, can also provide flight controllers with timely information on weather conditions that are hazardous to aircraft. With an added processingchannel, anupgradedASRcanautomatically detect regions oflow-altitude wind shear. This upgrade can provide wind shear warnings at airports where low traffic volume or infrequent thunderstorm activity precludes the deployment of a dedicated Terminal Doppler Weather Radar (TDWR). Field measurements and analysis conducted by Lincoln Laboratory indicate that the principal technical challenges for low-altitude wind shear detection with an ASR-groundclutter suppression, estimation of near-surface radial velocity, and <b>automatic</b> <b>wind</b> shear hazard recognition-ean be successfully met for microbursts accompanied by rain at the surface.

For example, with the touch of a button, the Starcom StarWolf unfolds its front, and both its wings. All in all, they offered plenty of moving parts (hidden compartments, cannons, folding wings, etc.). Starcom toys never caught on in the U.S. due to poor promotion and the fact that its parent show only lasted a year in syndication. They were discontinued after two years but ended up doing very well in Europe, where both the show and the toys continued to be popular long after the American toys. The toys were successful and hugely popular in Europe and Southeast Asia only after coming under the production and promotion of Mattel. That company removed the US flag and NASA details from the Coleco originals and launched the toys with a second line of promotions in the early 1990s.|$|R

50|$|This tower mill {{comes from}} Westdorf in the {{district}} of Dithmarschen, where it was built in 1848 under the name Immanuel. It is one of the original three mills that was established at the museum. It is described in German as a Bergholländer ("Dutch hill mill") or Kellerholländer ("Dutch cellar mill"). These terms indicated that, in the former case that the mill was built on a small hill, and in the latter, that it had a cellar into which the horses and carts could be driven. During the course of its history the mill was modified many times and evolved into a highly technical mill including, inter alia an <b>automatic</b> <b>wind</b> rose. The sails could be adjusted to the wind speed. In 1969 the last miller offered to donate the mill in a newspaper advert on the condition that it was rebuilt. The newspaper publisher, Axel Springer, acquired the mill and had it restored. Later he donated it to the mill museum, where it was rebuilt in 1979.|$|R

5000|$|Although {{self winding}} watches and {{clockwork}} {{have been around}} since the late 1700s, the <b>automatic</b> (self <b>winding)</b> chronograph was not invented until 1964, when Seiko launched the crown chronograph for the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. In 1969, watch companies Heuer, Breitling, and Hamilton, and movement specialist Dubois Depraz, developed it in partnership. They developed this technology secretly in an effort to prevent other companies from beating them to the patent. It was in Geneva and in New York that this partnership shared the first Swiss automatic chronograph with the world on March 3, 1969. These first automatic chronographs were labeled [...] "Chrono-matic".|$|R
