50|$|In economics, <b>aggregate</b> <b>expenditure</b> (AE) is {{a measure}} of {{national}} income. <b>Aggregate</b> <b>expenditure</b> is defined as the current value of all the finished goods and services in the economy. The <b>aggregate</b> <b>expenditure</b> is thus the sum total of all the expenditures undertaken in the economy by the factors during a given time period. It refers to the expenditure incurred on consumer goods, planned investment and the expenditure made by the government in the economy. In an open economy scenario, the <b>aggregate</b> <b>expenditure</b> also includes the difference between the exports and the imports.|$|E

The simulation results based upon the CEM are consistent with widely held beliefs about the effects of aging on the health care sector, for example, that <b>aggregate</b> <b>expenditures</b> will increase as the population ages. In addition, however, the simulations suggest differential effects on prices and expenditures for various types of services and on expenditures by different types of consumers. For example, prices and <b>aggregate</b> <b>expenditures</b> for services typically used by the elderly are found to increase under "older" age distributions, whereas prices and <b>aggregate</b> <b>expenditures</b> for other services are found to decrease. Elderly women are found to be unequivocally worse off under older as opposed to younger age structures; they spend more yet consume fewer services. equilibrium model, physician services, population aging, simulation...|$|R

U.) {{demand for}} chilled fish fillets assuming product heterogeneity due to {{country of origin}} and assesses the structural adjustment in demand {{as indicated by the}} increase in imports from Sri Lanka since the tsunami in December 2004. The primary objective of this research is to assess how Sri Lanka’s fish exports affected fish exports from Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda (Lake Victoria region). Although the results show no significant price competition between the Lake Victoria region and Sri Lanka, the Lake Victoria countries are clearly worse off now that Sri Lanka is a major supplier of chilled fish to the E. U. A comparison of the two periods 2001 – 2004 and 2007 – 2009 finds that in the former period, past imports of Lake Victoria fish had a positive impact on present imports, indicating that importers developed a preference for Lake Victoria fish during this time; in the latter period, this effect no longer existed. Most important is the change in the responsiveness of imports from Lake Victoria to real <b>aggregate</b> <b>expenditures</b> on imported fish in the E. U. The results show that a lesser share of <b>aggregate</b> <b>expenditures</b> is allocated to the Lake Victoria region and that the region now benefits less from an increase in <b>aggregate</b> <b>expenditures.</b> Discussion paperNon-PRIFPRI 1 DSG...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{trends in}} education expenditures {{in elementary and}} secondary schools, especially {{the extent to which}} special education costs are responsible for the overall upward expenditure trends. It reports on the limited national data available and on a longitudinal analysis of special education costs in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, from 1982 - 83 to 1990 - 91. Analysis of national data over a 4 -year period (1982 - 83 to 1985 - 86) suggests that <b>aggregate</b> <b>expenditures</b> for special education rose about 22 percent whereas total <b>aggregate</b> <b>expenditures</b> for elementary and secondary education rose only 14 percent.

25|$|British {{economist}} John Maynard Keynes {{argued in}} The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money that lower <b>aggregate</b> <b>expenditures</b> {{in the economy}} contributed to a massive decline in income and to employment that was well below the average. In such a situation, the economy reached equilibrium at low levels of economic activity and high unemployment.|$|R
50|$|An {{economy is}} said to be in {{equilibrium}} when <b>aggregate</b> <b>expenditure</b> is equal to the aggregate supply (production) in the economy. According to Keynes, the economy does not stay in a perpetual state of equilibrium but the <b>Aggregate</b> <b>expenditure</b> and Aggregate Supply adjust each other towards equilibrium. When there is an excess supply over the expenditure and hence the demand there is an inventory leftover with the producers, which leads to a reduction in either the prices or the quantity of output and hence reducing the total output (GDP) of the economy. On the other hand, if there is an excess of expenditure over supply, then there is excess demand leading to an increase in prices or output. Hence the economy constantly keeps shifting between excess supply (inventory) and excess demand. Thus, the economy is constantly moving towards an equilibrium between the <b>aggregate</b> <b>expenditure</b> and aggregate supply. In an under-employment equilibrium the Keynesian cross refers to the point of intersection of the aggregate supply and the <b>aggregate</b> <b>expenditure</b> curve. The rise in the expenditure by either Consumption (C), Investment (I) or the Government (G) or an increase in the exports or a decrease in the imports leads to a rise in the <b>aggregate</b> <b>expenditure</b> and thus pushes the economy towards a higher equilibrium and thus reaching a higher level towards the potential of the GDP.|$|E
50|$|<b>Aggregate</b> <b>expenditure</b> {{is one of}} {{the methods}} to {{calculate}} the sum total of all economic activities in an economy, which {{is referred to as the}} gross domestic product of an economy. The gross domestic product which is an important measure of the growth of the economy is calculated through the <b>aggregate</b> <b>expenditure</b> model, also known as the Keynesian cross. AE is also used in the aggregate demand-aggregate supply model which advances the aggregate expenditures model with the inclusion of price changes.|$|E
5000|$|Demand {{deficient}} unemployment (also {{known as}} cyclical unemployment) - In Keynesian economics, {{any level of}} unemployment beyond the natural rate is probably due to insufficient goods demand in the overall economy. During a recession, <b>aggregate</b> <b>expenditure</b> is deficient causing the underutilisation of inputs (including labour). <b>Aggregate</b> <b>expenditure</b> (AE) can be increased, according to Keynes, by increasing consumption spending (C), increasing investment spending (I), increasing government spending (G), or increasing the net of exports minus imports (X−M), since AE = C + I + G + (X−M).|$|E
