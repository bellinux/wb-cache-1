2500|$|An {{anti-tank}} missile (ATM), {{anti-tank guided missile}} (ATGM), <b>anti-tank</b> <b>guided</b> <b>weapon</b> (ATGW) or anti-armor guided weapon is a guided missile primarily designed to hit and destroy heavily armored military vehicles. ATGMs {{range in size from}} shoulder-launched weapons which can be transported by a single soldier, to larger tripod-mounted weapons which require a squad or team to transport and fire, to vehicle and aircraft mounted missile systems. The introduction of smaller, man-portable ATGMs such as the Dragon and Javelin with larger warheads to the modern battlefield has given infantry the ability to defeat light and medium tanks at great ranges, though main battle tanks using composite and reactive armors have proven to be resistant to smaller ATGMs. Earlier infantry anti-tank weapons such as anti-tank rifles, {{anti-tank missile}}s and magnetic anti-tank mines had limited armor-penetration abilities and/or required a soldier to approach the target closely.

Hundreds of university graduates were recruited {{and sent to}} Great Britain for research training. While by this time Butement was primarily a research administrator rather than a hands-on scientist, he did personally initiate several highly important developments, including a rocket engine that used a semi-solid paste pressed into the firing chamber as propellant, and the Malkara missile, an <b>anti-tank</b> <b>guided</b> <b>weapon</b> that was adopted as standard equipment by the Australian and British armies.|$|E
50|$|The {{development}} of the wire-guided missile, or <b>Anti-Tank</b> <b>Guided</b> <b>Weapon</b> (ATGW) systems came into use in the late 1950s and 1960s that could defeat any known tank at ranges beyond that of the guns of the accompanying infantry. The United Kingdom, France, and other NATO countries {{were among the first}} to develop such weapons (e.g., the Malkara missile by the UK and Australia in 1958). The Soviet Union, and now Russia, put extensive development into these weapons; the first man-portable model to enter service was the AT-3 in 1961. The United States was one of the last, coming up with the BGM-71 TOW in 1970.|$|E

As of March 2005, approximately 80 Abrams tanks shipped back to the United States for repair due to fire from enemy attacks. Abandoned Abrams were purposely destroyed by friendly fire to prevent recovery of vehicle or technology. Damages by 25 mm AP-DU, anti-armor RPG fire and 12.7 mm rounds was encountered.

50|$|The team {{sections}} (anspannstropparna) {{with horses}} and even tractors {{were used to}} early 1960s. Then the first all-terrain vehicles were taken in use, Bandvagn 202 which in the 1980s were replaced with Bandvagn 206. Also snowmobiles were introduced extensively which improved mobility during the winter. The armament consisted {{in the beginning of}} semi-automatic rifles and submachine guns. These were later replaced with assault rifles, first the Ak 4 and then Ak 5. Then BILL 1 <b>Anti-tank</b> <b>guided</b> <b>weapon</b> and 8 cm mortars were added which were included in each ranger company. For the soldiers, it was about mine training, ranger combat, survival, sabotage, reconnaissance, close air support training and more. Winter lasted 7-8 months of the year with an average annual temperature of -1.2 degrees. Before being accepted to the unit, one had to do physical and psychological tests to 'separate the wheat from the chaff'. One had to meet the requirements of the military unit class 1A (förbandsklass 1A).|$|E
50|$|Some Chinese {{military}} enthusiasts {{have suggested}} that the AKD-10 is only a temporary measure, as China is developing a multipurpose warhead / fuse {{similar to that of the}} BILL 2 <b>Anti-tank</b> <b>guided</b> <b>weapon</b> and the FGM-148 Javelin; a single missile can be used against both armored and soft targets. However, this claim was rejected by China North Industries Group Corp at defense exhibitions, this was because the missile with a multipurpose warhead / fuse would be more expensive, the AKD-10 would still have a place on the battlefield, such as in cramped, mountainous and urban areas where it is difficult for armored forces to deploy. Unless there is someway to bring down the cost of the multipurpose warhead / fuse under development (so far the developer has not found any), the cheaper AKD-10 would thus remain in service in the foreseeable future after the multipurpose warhead / fuse developed for the HJ-10 has been completed. Another reason for the predicted longevity of the AKD-10 is that it can be used, like the AGM-114 Hellfire, as an anti-ship missile against smaller vessels. The armor-piercing HJ-10 is not effective in this role because it would often penetrate both sides of a boat, without inflicting any real damage, while the AKD-10 would be more effective when it explodes, possibly causing enough damage to sink or disable a small ship.|$|E

25|$|<b>Anti-tank</b> <b>guided</b> <b>weapons</b> (ATGMs) can be {{operated}} by the BMD-3. This is {{made possible by the}} 9P135M launcher post that fires the wire guided Fagot (NATO reporting name: AT-4 Spigot) and Konkurs (NATO reporting name: AT-5 Spandrel) missiles. The 9P135M launcher is located on the top center of the BMD-3 turret and is dismountable. The crew can engage targets from the vehicle or a distance away from the system. The ATGM launcher has three ready-to-use rounds and two stowed in the vehicle. The Fagot missile is a short range ATGM with an effective range of 2km. While flying at an average speed of 186m/s, it penetrates 480mm of RHA. The Fagot-M is an improved variant that has an increased effective range of 2.5km and a penetration of 550mm of RHA. The Konkurs missile has an effective range of 4000 m and flies at an average speed of 206m/s. The original Konkurs missile penetrates 750–800mm of RHA while the improved Konkurs-M penetrates 750–800mm of RHA after ERA due to an additional tandem warhead. The firing range is reduced to 2500 m during night time. A French-German Flame-V adapter kit allows the BMD-3 to launch MILAN ATGMs.|$|R

40|$|<b>Anti-tank</b> <b>guided</b> <b>weapons</b> (ATGWs) {{are small}} missile-launching systems. They differ from unguided rocket launchers, {{such as the}} RPG- 7, because their {{missiles}} {{are designed to be}} steered, or ‘guided’, to a target after launch (i. e. during flight). These weapons are traditionally designed to disable armoured vehicles, but particularly over the last decade or so, producers have developed variants intended for use against other targets, such as hardened bunkers and buildings. The first ATGWs were created when advances in armour made traditional direct-fire anti-tank guns and rocket launchers less effective. Moreover, ATGWs offer soldiers the ability to engage targets from greater distances with increased accuracy than is possible with unguided anti-tank light weapons. ATGWs have an effective range of up to 8, 000 m (five miles) and armour penetration of around 1, 000 mm (3. 3 feet) (Jane’s, 1985, pp. 49 – 69; 2007, pp. 445 – 509). However, each generation of weapon varies greatly in terms of its guidance, lethality and portability. Three distinct generations of ATGWs have been developed since the 1950 s, with changes to the guidance system largely determining the generation. Broadly speaking, initially these weapons were wire-guided, but subsequent weapons first supplemented or replaced manual manipulation with radio waves and lasers, and later introduced infrared (IR) technologies that enhanced target acquisition. Concurrent with changes to these weapons’ navigation systems were improvements to their range and payload. Whereas first-generation ATGWs might effectively engage a target at 1, 500 m and penetrate 500 mm of armour, thirdgeneration systems are effective at distance...|$|R
