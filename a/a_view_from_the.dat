25|$|Domingo's {{goal was}} to make the WNO an internationally {{regarded}} company. At the beginning of his tenure, he lifted the opera to a new level, bringing in more international stars and big-name productions - including José Carreras in Wolf-Ferrari's Sly, Mirella Freni singing opposite Domingo in Fedora, and Renée Fleming in Lucrezia Borgia. And his commitment to American opera meant that the WNO presented the second or third productions of a number of important works: Maw's Sophie's Choice, Bolcom's <b>A</b> <b>View</b> <b>From</b> <b>the</b> Bridge, Previn's A Streetcar Named Desire.|$|E
25|$|A French-Italian film {{based on}} <b>A</b> <b>View</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Bridge titled Vu du pont was {{released}} in February 1962.

In a major change to the plot of the play, Eddie commits suicide after being publicly beaten by Marco.|$|E
