Brunel and other engineers travelled to Dalkey in Ireland in 1843 to view such a system undergoing tests on the Dublin and Kingstown Railway. There, Brunel's engineer of locomotives for the GWR, Daniel Gooch, calculated that conventional locomotives could work the proposed line at lower cost, but Brunel's concerns about the heavy grades led him to try the system regardless. The South Devon Railway directors agreed on 28 August 1844 to Brunel's proposal to use atmospheric power on their line. Brunel estimated that by reducing the double track locomotive worked line to a single track <b>atmospheric</b> <b>line</b> a saving of £8,000 per year could be made. Double track lines were favoured at that time even for lightly worked lines as this reduced {{the chances of a}} collision between trains, but the atmospheric system precludes the possibility of two trains travelling in opposite directions on the same section of track.|$|E

The choice of the calibrator is a particularly important question in the infra-red domain, where the precision and exploits still fall behind {{the achievements of the}} optical. Aims. We investigate the long-term stability of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>lines</b> as a precise wavelength reference and analyze their sensitivity to different atmospheric and observing conditions. Methods. We use HARPS archive data on three bright stars, Tau Ceti, µ Arae and Eri, spanning 6 years and containing high-cadence measurements over several nights. We cross-correlate this data with an O 2 mask and evaluate both radial velocity and bisector variations down to a photon noise of 1 m/s. Results. We find that the telluric lines in the three data-sets are stable down to 10 m/s (r. m. s.) over the 6 years.

The railway experienced many problems with the pumping engines during 1846, creating dissatisfaction among the shareholders with the directors, and leading to amalgamation with the L&BR in August of that year. In 1847, the atmospheric experiment was abandoned. The engine house at Dartmouth Arms was largely demolished in 1851 and an electricity sub-station {{was built on the}} site in 1928.

50|$|When {{the lines}} opened in 1839 {{it was found}} that {{congestion}} arose due to the frequent stopping services on the local Croydon line; this was particularly a problem on the 1 in 100 ascent from New Cross to Dartmouth Arms. The L&CR engineer, William Cubitt proposed a solution to the problem: a third track would be laid {{on the east side of}} the existing double track main line, and all the local trains in both directions would use it. The faster Brighton trains would be freed of the delay following a stopping train. Cubitt had been impressed during his visit to the Dalkey line, and the new L&CR third track would use atmospheric power. The local line would also be extended to Epsom, also as a single track <b>atmospheric</b> <b>line.</b> These arrangements were adopted and Parliamentary powers obtained on 4 July 1843, also authorising a line to a terminal at Bricklayers Arms. Arrangements were also made with the L&GR for them to add an extra track on the common section of their route. On 1 May 1844 the Bricklayers Arms terminus opened, and a frequent service was run from it, additional to the London Bridge trains.|$|E

In order to interpret the data, we have calculated two separate grids of photoionization models, adopting single-star atmospheres (Kurucz) and star clusters synthesized with different Initial Mass Functions (IMFs) as ionizing sources. Additional models were computed with more recent non-LTE stellar atmospheres, in order to check the effects of different stellar ionizing fluxes. We use the radiation softness parameter η ′ = ([OII]/[OIII]) /([SII]/[SIII]) of Vílchez and Pagel to test for a metallicity dependence of the effective temperatures of the ionizing stars. Our {{results are consistent with}} a significant decrease in mean stellar temperatures of the ionizing stars with increasing metallicity. The magnitude of the effect, combined with the behavior of the He I λ 5876 /Hβ ratio, suggest a smaller upper mass limit for star formation at abundances higher than solar, even when considering the effects of metallicity on stellar evolution and <b>atmospheric</b> <b>line</b> blanketing. However, the exact magnitudes of the stellar temperature and IMF variations are dependent on the choice of stellar atmosphere and evolution models used, as well as on uncertainties in the nebular abundance scale at high metallicities.

40|$|Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) {{has been}} {{developing}} advanced infrared heterodyne receivers for plasma diagnostics in fusion reactors for over 20 years. Passive heterodyne radiometry in the LWIR region of the spectrum has historically been restricted by HgCdTe (MCT) detector technology to receiver bandwidths of only 2 GHz. Given typical <b>atmospheric</b> <b>line</b> widths of approximately 3 GHz, a CO{sub 2 } (or isotope) laser local oscillator with an average line spacing of 50 GHz, and an MCT detector, only chemical species whose absorptions fall directly on top of laser lines can be measured. Thus, with traditional narrow-band heterodyne radiometry, much of the LWIR spectrum is missed and the less complex direct detection DIAL has been the preferred technique in remote sensing applications. Wide-band heterodyne receivers offer significant improvements in remote measurement capability. Progress at the Institute for Microstructural Sciences (IMS) at National Research Council of Canada and at ORNL in wide-band quantum-well infrared photodetectors (QIPs) and receivers is significantly enhancing the bandwidth capabilities of heterodyne radiometers. ORNL recently made measurements in the lab using QWIPs developed at IMS that demonstrate heterodyne quantum efficiencies of 5 % with a heterodyne bandwidth of 7 GHz. The path forward indicates that > 10 % heterodyne quantum efficiencies and 30 -GHz bandwidths are achievable with current QWIP technology. With a chopped, 30 -GHz passive heterodyne receiver, a much larger portion of the LWIR spectrum can now be covered.
