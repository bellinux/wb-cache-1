5|$|In 1909 {{the hunger}} strike {{was added to}} the WSPU's {{repertoire}} of resistance. On 24 June Marion Wallace Dunlop was arrested for writing <b>an</b> <b>excerpt</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Bill of Rights (1688 or 1689) on a wall in the House of Commons. Angered by the conditions of the jail, Dunlop went on a hunger strike. When it proved effective, fourteen women imprisoned for smashing windows began to fast. WSPU members soon became known around the country for holding prolonged hunger strikes to protest their incarceration. Prison authorities frequently force-fed the women, using tubes inserted through the nose or mouth. The painful techniques (which, in the case of mouth-feeding, required the use of steel gags to force the mouth open) brought condemnation from suffragists and medical professionals.|$|E

25|$|In 2003 the Russian {{historian}} V. Totfalushin found {{a document}} in the Russian State Historical Archives which casts doubts on Savin’s claimed age and provides some interesting details about him. The document is <b>an</b> <b>excerpt</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> official memo by the Russian Minister of Internal Affairs {{on the status}} of the surviving veterans of the Grande Armée still residing in Russia. According to this document, dated 1834, the French authorities had contacted the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs with a note that Nicolas Savin had requested permission to leave Russia and return home. The memo specifies that, according to the French authorities, Savin was born in Rouen, in Normandy, and had served as a non-commissioned officer in the 24th Chasseurs à Cheval before being captured in 1812 and sent to Saratov, where he had gained Russian citizenship (poddanstvo) in 1813. The memo further notes that in 1816 Savin had married the daughter of a local merchant and had had two sons, Pavel (born in 1821) and Alexander (born in 1828), and two daughters, Avdotia (born in 1823) and Akulina (born in 1825). Totfalushin’s research also questions Savin’s final age, noting that in another document, which Savin submitted to the local authorities in Khvalynsk in 1839, he indicated that he was 52 years old, which means he was born about 1787.|$|E
