5|$|The Cuban macaw had a red {{forehead}} fading {{to orange}} {{and then to}} yellow <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> the neck.

The upper surface of the tail was dark red fading to blue at the tip, and the under surface of the tail was brownish red. The beak has variously been described as dark, all-black, and greyish black. The sexes were identical in external appearance, as with other macaws.|$|E

6000|$|The modern gentleman {{was young}} and florid, tall and strong. The parting of his curly Saxon locks began {{in the center of}} his forehead, {{traveled}} over the top of his head, and ended, rigidly-central, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ruddy <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> his neck. His features were as perfectly regular and as perfectly unintelligent as human features can be. His expression preserved an immovable composure wonderful to behold. The muscles of his brawny arms showed through the sleeves of his light summer coat. He was deep in the chest, thin in the flanks, firm on the legs--in two words a magnificent human animal, wrought up to the highest pitch of physical development, from head to foot. This was Mr. Geoffrey Delamayn--commonly called [...] "the honorable;" [...] and meriting that distinction in more ways than one. He was honorable, in the first place, as being the son (second son) of that once-rising solicitor, who was now Lord Holchester. He was honorable, in the second place, as having won the highest popular distinction which the educational system of modern England can bestow--he had pulled the stroke-oar in a University boat-race. Add to this, that nobody had ever seen him read any thing but a newspaper, and that nobody had ever known him to be backward in settling a bet--and the picture of this distinguished young Englishman will be, for the present, complete.|$|R

Although they {{do not appear to}} need food, they instinctively attack and eat humans on sight; it is mentioned that they derive their energy from sunlight. Furthermore, the Titans also do not have a proper digestive tract; once they have eaten their fill of human prey, Titans will vomit large, slimy balls, derisively referred to as [...] "hairballs".

2500|$|The large high parted wig of the 1690s {{remained}} popular from 1700 until around 1720.

[...] Later, wigs or the natural hair were worn long, brushed back from the forehead and clubbed or tied back <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> the neck with a black ribbon. From about 1720, a bag wig gathered the back hair in a black silk bag. Black ribbons attached to the bag {{were brought to the}} front and tied in a bow in a style called a [...] "solitaire".|$|E
50|$|The print {{bears the}} title Sugatami Shichinin Keshō, which {{suggests}} it was—or {{was intended to}} be—part of a seven-print series. The young woman in the print is seen from behind, her body cropped off the right edge. Her face appears reflected as she peers into a large mirror with her right hand on her hair. Both her face and <b>the</b> <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> her neck are visible; <b>the</b> <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> neck was considered particularly sensual in Edo-period Japan. The subject does not pose like a model, but rather appears relaxed, away from {{the gaze of the}} public; Utamaro made many such candid portraits, emphasizing the beauty of the whole body—fingers, <b>the</b> <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> neck, and such—rather than just the face.|$|R

2500|$|AAVE {{also has}} words that either {{are not part}} of most other American English dialects or have strikingly {{different}} meanings. For example, there are several words in AAVE referring to white people that {{are not part of}} mainstream American English; these include gray as an adjective for whites (as in gray dude), possibly from the color of Confederate uniforms; and paddy, an extension of the slang use for [...] "Irish". [...] "," [...] which is pejorative, is another general term for a white person; it might derive from the Ibibio word afia, which means [...] "light-colored", from the Yoruba word ofe, spoken in hopes of disappearing from danger, or via Pig Latin from [...] "foe". However, most dictionaries simply say its etymology is unknown. Kitchen refers to the particularly curly or kinky hair <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> the neck, and siditty or seddity means [...] "snobbish" [...] or [...] "bourgeois".|$|E
2500|$|According to {{witnesses}} {{it started}} on 17 August 1922 when Krishnamurti complained of {{a sharp pain}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> his neck. Over {{the next two days}} the symptoms worsened, with increasing pain and sensitivity, loss of appetite, and occasional delirious ramblings. He seemed to lapse into unconsciousness, but later recounted that he was very much aware of his surroundings, and that while in that state he had an experience of [...] "mystical union". The following day the symptoms and the experience intensified, climaxing with a sense of [...] "immense peace". Following - and apparently related to - these events [...] the condition that {{came to be known as}} the process started to affect him, in September and October that year, as a regular, almost nightly occurrence. Later the process resumed intermittently, with varying degrees of pain, physical discomfort and sensitivity, occasionally a lapse into a childlike state, and sometimes an apparent fading out of consciousness, explained as either his body giving in to pain or his mind [...] "going off".|$|E
2500|$|Also {{known as}} matianak or kuntilanak, {{it is the}} ghost of a {{stillborn}} female. To prevent this, as with its mother the lang suir, a needle is placed in each of the corpse's hands and a hen's egg under each armpit. Depicted as an ugly woman wiith sharp nails and a white dress, the pontianak can also {{take the form of a}} beautiful young woman or a night-bird. When she is close, she gives off a strong smell of frangipani. It is usually encountered by the roadside or under a tree, and attack men and drink their blood. The Indonesian kuntilanak, however, typically uses its bird form to attack virgin women. The bird, which makes a [...] "ke-ke-ke" [...] sound as it flies, may be sent through black magic to make a woman sick, the characteristic symptom being vaginal bleeding. A pontianak can be made into a good wife, by placing a nail into the hole <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> its neck (called Sundel Bolong). Modern popular culture often confuses the pontianak with its mother the lang suir. However, traditional myth is clear that the pontianak is {{the ghost of a}} dead baby and not a pregnant woman. A similar ghost called tiyanak exists in Philippine lore.|$|E
