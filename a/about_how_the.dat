5|$|Strange Days was {{released}} on DVD format on August 21, 2001 by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment. The DVD's special features include a 1-hour lecture <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> opening scene was filmed, both the original teaser trailer and theatrical trailer, and two deleted scenes.|$|E
5|$|ATV New Network {{also said}} that the reason Declan is so popular with viewers was because of Sorensen's acting {{abilities}} and good looks. Both Five and Sorensen spoke out <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> character is one of Neighbours most popular characters. Channel Five's Holy Soap website praised the character's heroism in scenes where he rescued wheelchair-bound Josh during the dance party roof collapse, they also said {{it is one of the}} character's most memorable scenes.|$|E
5|$|After {{writing down}} rules <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> music {{was to be}} used, such as {{specific}} scenes certain songs should be used in, or ways a certain song should not be used, the game's scripters implemented the music at points they found fitting. During debugging, Nakazawa would request fixes for songs {{that he did not}} think fit the scenes they were used in. For the PlayStation Portable release, Asami Imai performed the opening theme.|$|E

5|$|The Allies {{disagreed}} <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> European map should look, and how borders {{would be}} drawn, following the war. Each side held dissimilar ideas regarding {{the establishment and}} maintenance of post-war security. The western Allies desired a security system in which democratic governments were established as widely as possible, permitting countries to peacefully resolve differences through international organizations.|$|E
5|$|The Big Bang as {{the origin}} of the {{universe}}: One of the common misconceptions about the Big Bang model is the belief that it was {{the origin of}} the universe. However, the Big Bang model does not comment <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> universe came into being. Current conception of the Big Bang model assumes the existence of energy, time, and space, and does not comment about their origin or the cause of the dense and high temperature initial state of the universe.|$|E
5|$|The {{bill was}} also an attempt to place the {{relationship}} between the House of Commons and House of Lords on a new footing. As well as the direct issue of money Bills, it set new conventions <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> power the Lords continued to hold would be used. It did not change the composition of the Lords, however.|$|E

5|$|The {{revised version}} of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (the WAIS-R) was {{developed}} by David Wechsler and published by Psychological Corporation in 1981. Wechsler changed {{a few of the}} boundaries for classification categories and a few of their names compared to the 1958 version of the test. The test's manual included information <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> actual percentage of persons in the norming sample scoring at various levels compared to theoretical expectations.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two stories}} <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> {{name of this}} altar came about. The first states that those {{condemned}} by the Spanish Inquisition {{were brought to the}} altar to ask for forgiveness in the next world before their execution. The second relates to painter Simon Pereyns, who despite being the author of many of the works of the cathedral, was accused of blasphemy. According to the story, while Pereyns was in jail, he painted such a beautiful image of the Virgin Mary that his crime was forgiven.|$|E
5|$|There is {{also much}} {{information}} <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> universe {{was thought to}} work stored in the mythology of the constellations. The Barasana of the Amazon plan part of their annual cycle based on observation of the stars. When their constellation of the Caterpillar-Jaguar (roughly equivalent to the modern Scorpius) falls they prepare to catch the pupating caterpillars of the forest as they fall from the trees. The caterpillars provide food at a season when other foods are scarce.|$|E

5|$|There {{was much}} {{internal}} discussion at DC <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> storyline would be collected. Eventually DC decided to release two hardcover volumes (a February 2008 release containing {{the first five}} parts {{of the story and}} a June 2008 release containing the last six issues) and a June 2008 hardcover collecting the tie-in issues and backstories. This follows DC Comics' recent trend of releasing durable hardcover collections initially, followed later by softcovers.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} films {{have been made}} about Emdens wartime exploits, {{including}} the 1915 movies How We Beat the Emden and How We Fought the Emden and the 1928 The Exploits of the Emden, all produced in Australia. German films include the 1926 silent film Unsere Emden, footage from which was incorporated in Kreuzer Emden of 1932, and Heldentum und Todeskampf unserer Emden, produced in 1934. All three films were directed by Louis Ralph. More recently, in 2012, Die Männer der Emden (The men of the Emden) was released, which was made <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> crew of Emden made {{their way back to}} Germany after the Battle of Cocos.|$|E
5|$|After a long {{discussion}} <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> episode should end, {{the writers}} {{decided that they}} did not want Barney to return to being drunk {{at the end of the}} episode. Barney stayed sober for several seasons. The animators modified the appearance of the character, straightening his hair, among other things, to indicate his sobriety. Castellaneta altered his voice for the character by no longer slurring. Barney was still seen at Moe's Tavern, but only drinking lattes. The character's new addiction to coffee was suggested by writer-producer David Mirkin, who has friends who stopped drinking alcohol and became addicted to coffee.|$|E

5|$|Another crisis {{broke in}} September 1949 when the Air Force picked up {{signs of the}} Soviet Union's RDS-1 nuclear test. Bacher joined Oppenheimer, Parsons, General Hoyt Vandenberg, the Atomic Energy Commissioners and a British {{delegation}} under William Penney to discuss what to do. The recent devaluation of the British pound had already triggered a financial crisis, and there was concern <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> markets would react to the news. Oppenheimer and Bacher saw the evidence of a nuclear test as conclusive, and Bacher in particular came down strongly {{on the side of}} making a public announcement, as {{the number of people who}} already knew made a leak almost inevitable. Truman made the announcement a few days later.|$|E
5|$|In April 1941, the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC), asked Arthur Compton, a Nobel-Prize-winning physics {{professor}} at the University of Chicago, {{to report on the}} uranium program. Niels Bohr and John Wheeler theorized that heavy isotopes with odd atomic numbers, such as plutonium-239, were fissile. Emilio Segrè and Glenn Seaborg at the University of California produced 28 μg of plutonium in the 60-inch cyclotron there in May 1941, and found that it had 1.7 times the thermal neutron capture cross section of uranium-235. While minute quantities of plutonium-239 could be created in cyclotrons, it was not feasible to produce a large quantity that way. Compton conferred with Eugene Wigner from Princeton University about how plutonium might be produced in a nuclear reactor, and with Robert Serber from the University of Illinois <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> plutonium produced in a reactor might then be chemically separated from uranium it was bred from.|$|E
5|$|In the 1890s, {{a dispute}} <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> club {{was to be}} owned and run emerged with John Houlding, Anfield's {{majority}} owner and Everton's Chairman, at the forefront. Houlding and the club's committee initially disagreed about the full purchase of the land at Anfield from minor land owner Mr Orrell escalating into a principled disagreement of how the club was run. Two such disagreements included Houlding wanting Everton to sell only his brewery produce during an event and for the Everton players to use his public house The Sandon as changing room facilities.|$|E

5|$|In {{works from}} Jeux vénitiens, Lutosławski wrote long {{passages}} {{in which the}} parts of the ensemble are not to be synchronised exactly. At cues from the conductor each instrumentalist may be instructed to move straight on to the next section, to finish their current section before moving on, or to stop. In this way the random elements within compositionally controlled limits defined by the term aleatory are carefully directed by the composer, who controls the architecture and harmonic progression of the piece precisely. Lutosławski notated the music exactly; there is no improvisation, no choice of parts is given to any instrumentalist, and there is thus no doubt <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> musical performance is to be realised.|$|E
5|$|Ishigami {{played a}} large role in the {{implementation}} of the Wi-Fi rescue quests, and it went smoother than anticipated, something the developers attributed to their experience with developing mobile games. They were initially concerned <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> player loses all their items if they die during a rescue mission, but realized {{that it had to be}} that way to avoid people abusing rescue missions to get new items. Due to programming changes between the Japanese and the English versions of the game, rescue quests from the North American and European versions are only compatible with each other, and not with the Japanese release.|$|E

The {{purpose of the}} journey is to replenish Sylvarant with mana, a necessary energy to their survival. The path of the journey consists of five temples which must be unsealed by Colette. On their journey, they meet Sheena Fujibayashi who comes from Tethe'alla, a world parallel to Sylvarant. She tells them <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> two worlds vie for each other's mana through the journey of regeneration.|$|E
