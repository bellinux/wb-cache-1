5|$|Immediately after lunch, Lindwall made a {{confident}} appeal for leg before wicket (lbw) against Washbrook, {{but was not}} supported behind the stumps by a silent Saggers, and the umpire ruled against the tourists. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>end,</b> Hutton square drove Toshack for four, bringing up his fifty in 125 minutes. He followed this with another boundary in the same direction, and Washbrook back cut Lindwall for four more <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>end.</b> This brought up England's 100, its first without loss for the series. Washbrook then on-drove a ball to the boundary and brought up his half-century, as Bradman pondered how to capture Australia's first wicket. England brought up 150 without loss 30 minutes before tea, and continued unhindered by two brief rain interruptions. Up to this point, the Australian bowling had been loose and inaccurate.|$|E
5|$|On {{the second}} day, Morris fell at 1/73 and Bradman {{came in to}} join Barnes. Yardley set a {{defensive}} field, employing leg theory to slow the scoring. He packed the leg side with fielders and ordered Alec Bedser to bowl at leg stump. Bradman almost edged the second ball onto his stumps, before defending uneasily for a period. While Jim Laker stopped the scoring <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>end,</b> Bradman managed only four runs in his first 20 minutes. The Australian captain regarded Bedser as the finest seam bowler he faced in his career, and he batted in a circumspect manner as he sought to establish himself. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>end,</b> Bradman misjudged a ball from Laker and an incorrectly executed cut shot narrowly went wide of the slip fielder. Now aged 40, Bradman's reflexes had slowed and he no longer started his innings as confidently {{as he had done}} in the past.|$|E

5|$|That same year, J.J.

5|$|Barnes and Morris {{took the}} score to 73 before {{the latter was}} bowled for 31 by Laker after two hours of batting. Morris tried to force a ball from Laker away, but hit it {{from the middle of}} his bat into his back pad, and the ball rebounded onto the stumps. Bradman came in and Yardley set a {{defensive}} field, employing leg theory to slow the scoring. The English leader packed the leg side with fielders, including two short legs, and ordered Bedser to bowl at leg stump. Bradman almost inside-edged the second ball onto his stumps, before defending uneasily for a period. With Laker stopping the scoring <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>end,</b> Bradman managed only four runs in his first 20 minutes of batting.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{microfluidic}} {{system that can}} be directly coupled with microwell array and perform parallel electrophoresis in multiple capillaries simultaneously. The system {{is based on an}} array of glass capillaries, fixed in a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microfluidic scaffold, with one end open for interfacing with microwells. In this capillary array, every two adjacent capillaries act as a pair to be coupled with one microwell; samples in the microwells are introduced and separated by simply applying voltage between two electrodes that are placed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>ends</b> of capillaries; thus no complicated circuit design is required. We evaluate the performance of this system and perform multiple CE with direct sample introduction from microwell array. Also with this system, we demonstrate the analysis of cellular contents of cells lysed in a microwell array. Our results show that this prototypic system is a promising platform for high-throughput analysis of samples in microwell arrays. © 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim...|$|R

5|$|In a {{telephone}} network, {{the caller is}} connected to the person they want to talk to by switches at various telephone exchanges. The switches form an electrical connection between the two users and the setting of these switches is determined electronically when the caller dials the number.

5|$|In {{the next}} over, Compton greatly troubled Bradman, who edged two balls and was dropped once. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>end,</b> Morris {{continued}} {{to take advantage}} of Hutton's inaccurate leg breaks, and Australia reached lunch at 1/121, with the opener on 63 and his captain on 35. Hutton had conceded 30 runs in four overs, and in the half-hour preceding the interval, Australia had added 64 runs. Although Australia had scored at a reasonable rate, they had also been troubled by many of the deliveries and were expected to face further difficulty if they were to avoid defeat.|$|E
40|$|Cohesin is a multisubunit {{complex that}} mediates sister-chromatid cohesion. Its Smc 1 and Smc 3 {{subunits}} possess ABC-like ATPases {{at one end}} of 50 nm long coiled coils. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>ends</b> are pseudosymmetrical hinge domains that interact to create V-shaped Smc 1 /Smc 3 heterodimers. N- and C-terminal domains within cohesin's kleisin subunit Scc 1 bind to Smc 3 and Smc 1 ATPase heads respectively, thereby creating a huge tripartite ring. It has been suggested that cohesin associates with chromosomes by trapping DNA within its ring. Opening of the ring due to cleavage of Scc 1 by separase destroys sister-chromatid cohesion and triggers anaphase. We show that cohesin's hinges are not merely dimerization domains. They are essential for cohesin's association with chromosomes, which is blocked by artificially holding hinge domains together but not by preventing Scc 1 's dissociation from SMC ATPase heads. Our results suggest that entry of DNA into cohesin's ring requires transient dissociation of Smc 1 and Smc 3 hinge domains...|$|R

5|$|Oba Chandler (October 11, 1946November 15, 2011) was an American man {{convicted and}} {{executed}} for the June 1989 triple murders of Joan Rogers {{and her two}} daughters, whose bodies were found, with their hands and feet bound, floating in Tampa Bay, Florida. Autopsies showed the victims had been thrown into the water while still alive, with ropes around their necks with a concrete block tied <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>end</b> of the rope. The case became high-profile in 1992 when local police posted, on billboards, enlarged copies of the suspect's handwriting recovered on a pamphlet in the victims' car. Chandler was identified as the killer when his neighbor recognized the handwriting. This was the first such use of billboards by law enforcement in the U.S.; billboards became useful tools in searches for missing people.|$|E
5|$|Peridioles are {{attached}} to the fruit body by a funiculus, a complex structure of hyphae that may be differentiated into three regions: the basal piece, which attaches it to the inner wall of the peridium, the middle piece, and an upper sheath, called the purse, connected to the lower surface of the peridiole.

5|$|The French {{approach}} to funding memorials also relied mainly on voluntary fundraising, but featured {{a greater role}} for the state.

50|$|In addition, lighthouses, buoys, and lightships {{along the}} coast of the United States in recent years {{increasingly}} had received navigation aids that used underwater bells to generate sounds which approaching ships could detect; by noting the bearing of each sound source, a ship's crew determine the position of its ship even when poor visibility did not permit the sighting of a light. In 1923, a radio transmitter was added to these systems so that they could broadcast a signal identifying themselves to approaching ships and informing the ships that they would emit an acoustic signal at a certain defined time interval after the radio signal, allowing a ship to determine its direction and distance from the navigation aid. Meanwhile, the U.S. Army Coast Artillery Corps's Subaqueous Sound Ranging Section had conducted post-World War I experiments in shallow water in Vineyard Sound off Massachusetts in which it had detonated explosive charges underwater <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ends of established baselines and measured the amount of time it took for the sound to arrive <b>at</b> hydrophones <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>ends</b> of <b>the</b> baselines in order to establish very accurate measurements of the speed of sound through water.|$|R
