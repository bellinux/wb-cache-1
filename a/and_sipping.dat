500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Love Machine" [...] {{was directed by}} Stuart Gosling for Image Dynamic Pictures, and filmed at the Titanic restaurant on London's Brewer Street. Gosling shot the project on 35mm film {{to give it the}} desired sleek, stylised, polished and glossy look. Girls Aloud members stopped in at Camden Post to view the footage and were impressed with the final results of it. The video depicts a nightclub/restaurant scene with the five women dancing <b>and</b> <b>sipping</b> champagne at the location whilst singing their pop number. A caption {{at the start of the}} video identifies the location as [...] "The Eskimo Club", which explains the otherwise meaningless song lyrics [...] "Let's go eskimo".|$|E

"Love Machine" [...] debuted and {{peaked at}} number 2 on the UK Singles Chart, {{continuing}} the band's string of hits by becoming their sixth consecutive single to chart within the top three.

The accompanying music video was directed by Stuart Gosling, and portrays the five members in a nightclub/restaurant scene dancing <b>and</b> <b>sipping</b> champagne whilst singing their pop number. Girls Aloud performed [...] "Love Machine" [...] on all of their tours and on several live appearances, including at Disney Channel Kids Awards, TMF Awards 2005, and at The Girls Aloud Party TV special in 2008. English indie rock band Arctic Monkeys covered the song on BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge.|$|E
40|$|Mobile IPv 6 <b>and</b> <b>SIP</b> are {{protocols}} {{designed to}} support {{different types of}} mobility. Mobile IPv 6 {{has been used to}} support mobility in IP networks <b>and</b> <b>SIP</b> has been used for voice over IP applications. It is the signalling protocol of the IP multimedia subsystem (IMS). In this paper both protocols have been simulated and compared in order to observe their performance for voice over IP (VoIP) applications. In this paper the architectures proposed by researchers in order to combine mobile IPv 6 <b>and</b> <b>SIP</b> have also been investigated and compared to analyse their advantages and disadvantages. A network scenario, running mobile IPv 6 <b>and</b> <b>SIP</b> for IMS, has also been simulated in order to evaluate the performance offered by the two protocols and to compare them with the results from the simulation of the pure mobile IPv 6 <b>and</b> <b>SIP</b> architectures. The comparison shows that the combined scenario offers better performance similar to the one obtained using only mobile IPv 6 with route optimization. The scenario simulated was also compared with the integrated architectures for mobile IPv 6 <b>and</b> <b>SIP</b> that were investigated...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} an experimental {{assessment of the}} quality of mobile VoIP calls when carried out in Mobile IPv 6 <b>and</b> <b>SIP</b> mobility scenarios. The study shows that the current implementation of MIPv 6 <b>and</b> <b>SIP</b> mobility are not sufficient to provide acceptable voice quality, corresponding to a R-factor target of 70. However, the detailed evaluation of the factors that contribute to the total handoff latency allows the identification of various required performance enhancements. Various solutions are then proposed to adequate MIPv 6 <b>and</b> <b>SIP</b> mobility to support mobility of VoIP clients...|$|R

He {{was a member of}} the Quiet Birdmen, a secretive fraternal order of pilots, and he joined the American Legion. He enjoyed visits by friends, {{especially}} playing cards <b>and</b> <b>sipping</b> bourbon with his former military colleagues. He died at his home during the night of April 4–5, 1966, of acute peritonitis flaring up from a chronic duodenal ulcer. He was survived by his wife Margery, by his son who was living in Tucson, Arizona, and by his granddaughter Elizabeth Anne [...] "Lisa" [...] Haynes. He was buried with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery on April 8.|$|E
500|$|... "'03 Bonnie & Clyde" [...] was {{received}} favorably by critics, who commended {{the use of}} different samples, and commented {{on the relationship between}} Jay-Z and Beyoncé. Chris Ryan of Spin magazine described [...] "'03 Bonnie & Clyde" [...] as a highlight on The Blueprint 2: The Gift & the Curse, stating that it consists of [...] "a house party in a crib as big as the Georgia Dome." [...] John Bush from AllMusic included the song as a highlight on the album, further describing it as [...] "a slick R crossover with Beyoncé Knowles". Marc L. Hill of PopMatters viewed it as the [...] "obligatory radio song" [...] of the album. Awarding the song a rating of eight out of ten possible points, Dele Fadele of NME complimented it as [...] "a cool duet" [...] between Jay-Z and Beyoncé. John Robinson of the same publication wrote that as the couple describe their life, it's not all [...] "Lexus <b>and</b> <b>sipping</b> Cris". He added, [...] "A similarly relaxed production makes for a behind-the-diamante-net-curtains classic".|$|E
2500|$|In early 1974 Split Enz {{undertook}} {{a series of}} radio-sponsored [...] "Buck-A-Head" [...] ($1 per head entry) shows which played in theatres rather than in pubs or clubs. Taking advantage of this, Phil and Tim decided that, rather than slogging {{it out on the}} traditional pub circuit, they would now only perform in theatres and concert halls, which were better suited to the band's unique performance style and enabled them to stage a full theatrical presentation. Under Noel Crombie's guidance the band developed elaborate sets, costumes, hairstyles and makeup, [...] and performances were punctuated by odd happenings. At one concert, they brought Rayner's auntie on stage to perform an impromptu tap dance during one of the songs and this was a great success, but they realised that they couldn't really take her on tour with them, so it Crombie's spoon playing routine was substituted and soon became an essential part of each show. For an early NZ TV performance with a [...] "desert island" [...] theme they brought in a load of sand and created a miniature indoor beach, complete with palm trees and a wading pool, with band members dressed as hankie-hatted tourists, reclining on deck chairs <b>and</b> <b>sipping</b> drinks. For another now-legendary live performance of their live epic [...] "Stranger Than Fiction", a female friend was recruited to crawl across the stage during the song, under pulsing strobe lights, with a bloodied axe apparently embedded in her skull.|$|E
