5|$|Originally named Rural High School District No. 1 in July 1928, {{it became}} known as Klein Independent School District in 1938, named after Adam Klein, who led many German {{immigrants}} into the area in 1854.

5|$|Although strenuous and {{requiring}} physical fitness, {{none of the}} conventional routes require specialist mountaineering skills or technical rock climbing. The main dangers of the mountain are those common to <b>all</b> <b>high</b> mountains, particularly altitude sickness. This can affect anyone, {{even those who are}} acclimatized. In serious cases, it can lead to high-altitude pulmonary edema and cerebral edema, which can lead to difficulties with breathing, paralysis, and death. Climbers are advised to begin their ascent at or before 6 a.m. and to summit and descend before early afternoon to minimize exposure to possible afternoon thunderstorms while at high altitudes. Although the most conventional form of ascent is by hiking, Anna Elizabeth Dickinson, the orator, ascended the mountain on a mule borrowed from the U.S. government.|$|E
5|$|Columbia {{and much}} of the {{surrounding}} area lies within the Columbia Public School District. The district enrolls over 17,000 students and had a revenue of nearly $200 million for the 2007–2008 school year. It is above the state average in attendance percentage and in graduation rate. The city operates four public high schools which cover grades 9–12: David H. Hickman High School, Rock Bridge High School, Muriel Battle High School, and Frederick Douglass High School. Rock Bridge is one of two Missouri high schools to receive a silver medal by U.S. News & World Report, putting it in the top 3% of <b>all</b> <b>high</b> schools in the nation. Hickman has been on Newsweek magazine's list of top 1,300 schools in the country {{for the past three years}} and has more named presidential scholars than any other public high school in the United States. There are also several private high schools including Christian Fellowship School, Columbia Independent School, Heritage Academy, Christian Chapel Academy, and Father Augustine Tolton Regional Catholic High School.|$|E
5|$|The decorations are <b>all</b> <b>high</b> {{quality and}} often highly complex. In one decoration, which {{occupies}} a one-inch square {{piece of a}} page, there are 158 complex interlacements of white ribbon with a black border on either side. Some decorations can only be fully seen with magnifying glasses, although lenses of the required power are not {{known to have been}} available until hundreds of years after the book's completion. The complicated knot work and interweaving found in Kells and related manuscripts have many parallels in the metalwork and stone carving of the period. Since their gradual rediscovery from the 19th century on, these designs have also had an enduring popularity. Many of these motifs are used today in popular art including jewellery and tattoos.|$|E

5|$|The {{extended}} period of power outage was {{a major problem for}} the residents in Broome. Residents had to wait for days for the power supply to be restored. As all of the distribution lines were above ground, Broome was particularly vulnerable to power outages during cyclones. Linesmen from Western Power were called in from afar to inspect <b>all</b> <b>high</b> voltage distribution lines before these could be re-energised. Western Power inspectors were also flown in from around the state to commence disconnections of properties suspected to have suffered water intrusion. These properties had to be tested before having supply reconnected. The majority of residential properties had power restored back on 30 April, 11days after Rosita struck. Television and radio were limited to transmissions from Perth, and this proved difficult to access information about any available supplies in the town. People had difficulties purchasing food and supplies because supermarkets were closed or had no power and there was no fresh produce arriving. However, power was restored {{a few days after the}} cyclone hit. There were only minor interruptions to the water and sewerage infrastructure.|$|E
5|$|Catastrophic {{injuries}} are not common in American football. According to the National Center for Catastrophic Sport Injury Research, there were 468 non-fatal injuries resulting in permanent neurological damage across <b>all</b> <b>high</b> school {{sports in the}} United States from 1982 to 2011. In football, catastrophic {{injuries are}} rare but are devastating when they occur. The rate of catastrophic head injuries has remained low since {{the introduction of the}} modern football helmet in the 1970s, but rates of injury are much higher {{at the high school level}} than the college level. A 2007 study found that, in high school and college football, there are an average of 7.23 catastrophic head injuries per year: there were 0.67 injuries per 100,000 high school players and 0.21 injuries per 100,000 college players. Over a 13-year period from September 1989 to June 2002, there were 94 players who sustained catastrophic head injuries—8 of these players died as a result of the injury, 46 sustained permanent neurological damage, and 36 made a full recovery. Fifty-nine percent of these players had a history of head injuries, 71% of them occurring in the same season as their catastrophic injury, and most of the catastrophic injuries resulted from being tackled or making a tackle. The study recommended that players exhibiting neurological symptoms should be strongly discouraged from returning to play.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{some states}} have used the ACT to assess the {{performance}} of schools, and require <b>all</b> <b>high</b> school students to take the ACT, {{regardless of whether they}} are college bound. Colorado and Illinois have incorporated the ACT as part of their mandatory testing program since 2001. Michigan has required the ACT since 2007; Kentucky and Tennessee require <b>all</b> <b>high</b> school juniors to take the ACT and Wyoming requires <b>all</b> <b>high</b> school juniors to take either the ACT or the ACT WorkKeys.|$|E
