5|$|An {{individual}} domestic <b>animal</b> {{could also}} {{be regarded as a}} zduhać, such as a shepherd dog, ox, bellwether, horse, or billy goat. If an <b>animal</b> habitually made vocal sounds in sleep, it was assumed to be a zduhać. Such an <b>animal</b> was cherished, and was not for sale. The spirit of the <b>animal</b> zduhać would leave its body in sleep and fight against the enemy zduhaći, to protect its own flock or herd. Only the fertility of the livestock depended on the outcome of the battles fought by the <b>animal</b> zduhaći; they had no bearing on the crop yield. In the region of Užice, western Serbia, it was believed that storms and hail clouds were led by zduhaći who flew above them in the form of big birds. A black ox and a three-year-old rooster defended their village from them—especially the rooster, for which reason he was not killed for food, but kept as a home guardian. In folk spells for repelling hail clouds in Serbia, these clouds were called white cattle. This could be compared with the idea of the black ox as a defender from hail.|$|E

5|$|<b>Animal</b> Rights Without Liberation: Applied Ethics and Human Obligations is a 2012 book by the British {{political}} theorist Alasdair Cochrane, {{in which}} it is argued that <b>animal</b> rights philosophy can be decoupled from <b>animal</b> liberation philosophy by the adoption of the interest-based rights approach. Cochrane, arguing that there is no reason that (nonhuman) animals should be excluded from justice, adopts Joseph Raz's account of interest rights and extends it to include animals. He argues that sentient animals possess a right not to be made to suffer and a right not to be killed, but not a right to freedom. The book's chapters apply Cochrane's account to a number of interactions between humans and animals; first <b>animal</b> experimentation, then <b>animal</b> agriculture, the genetic engineering of animals, the use of animals in entertainment and sport, the relationship of animals to environmental practices and the use of animals in cultural practices.|$|E
5|$|<b>Animal</b> Sacrifice of {{a buffalo}} or goat, {{particularly}} during smallpox epidemics, has been practiced {{in parts of}} South India.

5|$|<b>Animal</b> {{husbandry}} has {{a significant}} impact on the world environment. It is responsible for somewhere between 20 and 33% of the fresh water usage in the world, and livestock, and the production of feed for them, occupy about a third of the earth's ice-free land. Livestock production is a contributing factor in species extinction, desertification, and habitat destruction. <b>Animal</b> agriculture contributes to species extinction in various ways. Habitat is destroyed by clearing forests and converting land to grow feed crops and for <b>animal</b> grazing, while predators and herbivores are frequently targeted and hunted because of a perceived threat to livestock profits; for example, <b>animal</b> husbandry is responsible for up to 91% of the deforestation in the Amazon region. In addition, livestock produce greenhouse gases. Cows produce some 570 million cubic metres of methane per day. Livestock is responsible for 65% of all human-related emissions of the powerful and long-lived greenhouse gas nitrous oxide. As a result, ways of mitigating <b>animal</b> husbandry's environmental impact are being studied. Strategies include using biogas from manure.|$|E
5|$|<b>Animal</b> testing, {{also known}} as <b>animal</b> experimentation, <b>animal</b> {{research}} and in vivo testing, {{is the use of}} non-human animals in experiments that seek to control the variables that affect the behavior or biological system under study. This approach can be contrasted with field studies in which animals are observed in their natural environments. Experimental research with animals is usually conducted in universities, medical schools, pharmaceutical companies, defense establishments and commercial facilities that provide animal-testing services to industry. The focus of <b>animal</b> testing varies on a continuum from pure research, focusing on developing fundamental knowledge of an organism, to applied research, which may focus on answering some question of great practical importance, such as finding a cure for a disease. Examples of applied research include testing disease treatments, breeding, defense research and toxicology, including cosmetics testing. In education, <b>animal</b> testing is sometimes a component of biology or psychology courses. The practice is regulated to varying degrees in different countries.|$|E
