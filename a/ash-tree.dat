25|$|According to Hesiod, Gaia {{conceived}} further offspring with Uranus, {{first the}} giant one-eyed Cyclopes: Brontes ("Thunder"), Steropes ("Lightning") and Arges ("Bright"); then the Hecatonchires: Cottus, Briareos and Gyges, {{each with a}} hundred arms and fifty heads. As each of the Cyclopes and Hecatonchires were born, Uranus hid them in a secret place within Gaia, causing her great pain. So Gaia devised a plan. She created a grey flint (or adamantine) sickle. And Cronus used the sickle to castrate his father Uranus as he approached Gaia {{to have sex with}} her. From Uranus' spilled blood, Gaia produced the Erinyes, the Giants and the Meliae (<b>ash-tree</b> nymphs). From the testicles of Uranus in the sea came forth Aphrodite.|$|E
500|$|In the Poetic Edda, Urðarbrunnr is {{mentioned}} in stanzas 19 and 20 {{of the poem}} Völuspá, and stanza 111 of the poem Hávamál. In stanza 19 of [...] Völuspá, Urðarbrunnr is described as being located beneath Yggdrasil, and that Yggdrasil, an ever-green <b>ash-tree,</b> [...] is covered with white mud or loam. Stanza 20 describes that three norns (Urðr, Verðandi, and Skuld) [...] "come from" [...] the well, here described as a [...] "lake", and that this trio of norns then [...] "set down laws, they chose lives, for the sons of men the fates of men." ...|$|E

6000|$|So people, passing under The <b>ash-trees</b> of the valley-road, {{will raise}} Their eyes {{and look at}} the grave on the hill, in [...] wonder, [...] Wondering mount, and put the flowers asunder ...|$|R
6000|$|Out of {{the sounds}} of scuffling and {{scattering}} came the whisper: [...] "His lordship!" [...] And the shade under the <b>ash-trees</b> became deserted, save by the tall dark figure of a man, and a woman's white shape.|$|R
2500|$|Vorse {{also wrote}} several ghost stories, {{including}} [...] "The Second Wife" [...] (1912). The stories were later {{collected in the}} <b>Ash-Tree</b> Press volume Sinister Romance : Collected ghost stories.|$|E
2500|$|Le Fanu, his works, and {{his family}} {{background}} are explored in Gavin Selerie's mixed prose/verse text Le Fanu's Ghost (2006). Gary William Crawford's J. Sheridan Le Fanu: A Bio-Bibliography (1995) is the first full bibliography. Crawford and Brian J. Showers's Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu: A Concise Bibliography (2011) is a supplement to Crawford's out-of-print 1995 bibliography. With Jim Rockhill and Brian J. Showers, Crawford has edited Reflections in a Glass Darkly: Essays on J. Sheridan Le Fanu. Jim Rockhill's introductions to the three volumes of the <b>Ash-Tree</b> Press edition of Le Fanu's short supernatural fiction (Schalken the Painter and Others , The Haunted Baronet and Others , Mr Justice Harbottle and Others [...] ) provide a perceptive account of Le Fanu's life and work.|$|E

60|$|Still the Marsh {{remained}} {{remote and}} original, on the old, quiet {{side of the}} canal embankment, in the sunny valley where slow water wound along in company of stiff alders, and the road went under <b>ash-trees</b> past the Brangwens' garden gate.|$|R
5000|$|The name Ashford {{derives from}} the Old English æsc and ford, and means a ford where <b>ash-trees</b> grow. In 926 the village was known as Æscforda and in the Domesday Book of 1086 it was Aisseford. The {{addition}} of [...] "in-the-Water" [...] occurred in the late 17th century, and reflected {{the proximity of the}} village to meanders of the River Wye.|$|R
6000|$|But wild OEnone by the mountain-path [...] Saw not her son {{returning}} to the wold, And now was she in fear, and now in wrath [...] She cried, [...] "He hath forgot the mountain fold, [...] And goes in Ilios with a crown of gold:" [...] But even then she heard men's axes smite [...] Against the beeches slim and <b>ash-trees</b> old, These ancient trees wherein she did delight.|$|R
60|$|Morton {{accordingly}} {{paid his}} reckoning and departed. The sunset {{of the summer}} day placed him at the <b>ash-tree,</b> where the path led up towards the moors.|$|E
6000|$|Come {{from that}} image; {{body and soul}} are gone. [...] You have thrown your arms about a drift of leaves, [...] Or bole of an <b>ash-tree</b> changed into her image.|$|E

60|$|Landing {{from the}} dinghy, they struck across the fields, and {{although}} it was autumn, Whitney wondered at the lush greenness of the grass. Close on their left hand, Criffell's lonely ridge ran up against the sky, colored purple-red, though the hollows in its curving side were filled with dark-blue shadows. The <b>ash-trees</b> in the hedgerows that crossed the rolling pasture obscured their view ahead, and they were crossing the last rise when Whitney stopped.|$|R
6000|$|... "Lovely weather, isn't it?" [...] said she. [...] "I {{love the}} snow. I wouldn't {{feel at home}} with no snow about. Why, last spring I even built my nest before the snow was gone in the Far North. We {{certainly}} hated to leave up there, but food was getting so scarce that we had to. We have just arrived. Can {{you tell me if}} there are any cedar-trees or <b>ash-trees</b> or sumacs near here?" ...|$|R
60|$|A deep glen, {{where the}} light was subdued and the colors dim, cleft the mountain's {{northern}} flank, and at its mouth a cluster of white houses stood among the trees; then, on a narrow green level, bright in the sun, the old abbey shone rosy red. Ancient <b>ash-trees</b> and crumbling granite walls straggled about it, but the molding of the high, east window, buttress and tower, still rose in lines of beauty, worked in warm-colored stone.|$|R
60|$|Paul {{went to the}} {{bay window}} and looked out. The <b>ash-tree</b> stood monstrous and black {{in front of the}} wide darkness. It was a faintly {{luminous}} night. Paul went back to his mother.|$|E
6000|$|OUTSIDE {{the house}} an <b>ash-tree</b> hung its terrible [...] whips, And {{at night when}} the wind arose, the lash of the tree Shrieked and slashed the wind, as a ship's Weird rigging in a storm shrieks hideously.|$|E
60|$|Nedda, {{her blue}} head-gear trailing, {{followed}} along at the boy's side while {{he passed through}} the orchard and two fields; and when he threw himself down under an <b>ash-tree</b> she, too, subsided, {{waiting for him to}} notice her.|$|E
6000|$|Why {{is it that}} in {{some places}} one has such a feeling of life being, not merely a long picture-show for human eyes, but a single breathing, glowing, growing thing, {{of which we are}} no more {{important}} a part than the swallows and magpies, the foals and sheep in the meadows, the sycamores and <b>ash-trees</b> and flowers in the fields, the rocks and little bright streams, or even than the long fleecy clouds and their soft-shouting drivers, the winds? ...|$|R
60|$|The {{light was}} rapidly going {{and the wind}} was falling. In front lay a stretch of moor, seamed by black peat-hags, in some of which water glistened; beyond the moor rough heather-covered slopes ran up to the black hillcrest. A curlew whistled overhead, and the sharp cry of a grouse rose from the darkening heath. Except for this, it was very still and the {{landscape}} looked strangely desolate. Not far ahead a patch of roof showed faintly among some stunted <b>ash-trees.</b>|$|R
60|$|Soon {{the glen}} ran {{out into a}} wide hollow that led westward across a tableland. Low, green hills with gently rounded tops shut off the rugged moors beyond; the shallow vale was {{cultivated}} and tame, but the road was good, and Andrew felt the thrill of speed. Long fields and stone dykes swept behind into the trail of dust. The sun sank toward a bank of slate-colored cloud; its rays raked the valley, throwing the black shadows of the scattered <b>ash-trees</b> far across the fields.|$|R
60|$|And {{then he came}} to {{the corner}} at home, which faced {{the other side of the}} night. The <b>ash-tree</b> seemed a friend now. His mother rose with gladness as he entered. He put his eight shillings proudly on the table.|$|E
6000|$|... "It will be {{the better}} if you stretch his limbs, for he grows overheavy," [...] said the knight. [...] "Now mark me, Nigel! Yonder betwixt the <b>ash-tree</b> and the red rock {{what do you see}} {{on the side of the}} far hill?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Melbury--"no." [...] He stopped, {{and struck}} the smooth {{trunk of a}} young <b>ash-tree</b> {{with the flat of}} his hand. [...] "I would that his ear had been where that rind is!" [...] he exclaimed; [...] "I should have treated him to little {{compared}} wi what he deserves." ...|$|E
50|$|The tops of {{the highest}} {{mountains}} have an Arctic flora. At the royal lodge on Loch Muick, 411 m above the sea, grow larches, vegetables, currants, laurels, roses, etc. Some <b>ash-trees,</b> 1 to 1.5 m (4 or 5 ft) in girth, grow at 400 m above the sea. Trees, especially Scotch fir and larch, grow well, and Braemar has plentiful natural timber, said to surpass any {{in the north of}} Europe. Stumps of Scotch fir and oak found in peat sometimes far exceed any now growing in size.|$|R
5000|$|The {{probable}} {{beginning of}} settlement {{for the place}} is between the 9th and 13th centuries. Eschenbach means <b>ash-trees</b> at a river. The eponymous Eschenbach springs beneath the [...] "Weisse Mauer" [...] (white wall) on the Fuchseck mountain.The first written reference does not refer to the place, but to the church on the Lotenberg. In 1228, in a document of the Abbey of St. Gall, a pastor, and thus a church, is mentioned on the Lotenberg. The group of houses on the Lotenberg still conveys {{the image of a}} castle building.|$|R
5000|$|The name Ashton {{derives from}} Old English and means the [...] "farmstead where the <b>ash-trees</b> grow"; it {{is a common}} name and is found locally in Ashton-under-Lyne in Tameside and Ashton upon Mersey in Trafford. The town's name was {{recorded}} as Eston in 1212. Later, the suffix [...] "in-Makerfield" [...] was added, which relates the name of the old district of Makerfield of which Ashton was a part; Makerfield derives from the Celtic for a wall or ruin and the Old English word feld, meaning [...] "open land".|$|R
6000|$|That was {{a bitter}} and {{frightening}} hour under the faintly rustling <b>ash-tree,</b> while the wind sprinkled over her flakes {{of the may}} blossom, just past its prime. Love seemed now so little a thing, seemed to have lost warmth and power, seemed like a suppliant outside a door. Why did trouble come like this the moment one felt deeply? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Very irregularly built, {{whatever}} you are!' said Louis. But I'll {{tell you what}} you shall do for me,' continued he, with anxious earnestness. 'Do you know the hollow <b>ash-tree</b> that shades over Inglewood stile? It has a stout sucker, with a honeysuckle grown into it--coming up among the moss, where the great white vase-shaped funguses grew up in the autumn.' ...|$|E
60|$|His {{eyes were}} fixed intently on the place where a large trout had risen in the stillest toffee-coloured pool. He knew that fellow, a half-pounder at least, and his {{thoughts}} began flighting round {{the top of his}} head, hovering over the various merits of the flies. His fingers itched too, but he made no movement, and the <b>ash-tree</b> under which he sat let its leaves tremble, as though in sympathy.|$|E
60|$|The {{next day}} a poor {{fisherman}} found him among the reeds upon the lake shore, lying upon the white lake sand {{with his arms}} flung out as though he lay upon a rood, and carried him to his own house. And the very poor lamented over him and sang the keen, and when the time had come, laid him in the Abbey on Insula Trinitatis with only the ruined altar between him and Dermott's daughter, and planted above them two <b>ash-trees</b> that in after days wove their branches together and mingled their trembling leaves.|$|R
60|$|Her attendants eagerly bent {{their eyes}} on the field of battle, but could {{discover}} nothing more than that it was obstinately contested. The small enclosures and cottage gardens in the village, of which they had a full and commanding view, and which shortly before lay, with their lines of sycamore and <b>ash-trees,</b> so still and quiet in the mild light of a May sun, were now each converted into a line of fire, canopied by smoke; and the sustained and constant report of the musketry and cannon, mingled with the shouts of meeting combatants, showed that as yet neither party had given ground.|$|R
60|$|The village Inn, {{a little}} white {{building}} whose small windows were overgrown with creepers, had a single guest's bedroom on the upper floor, and a little sitting-room where Courtier took his meals. The {{rest of the house}} was but stone-floored bar with a long wooden bench against the back wall, whence nightly a stream of talk would issue, all harsh a's, and sudden soft u's; whence too a figure, a little unsteady, would now and again emerge, to a chorus of 'Gude naights,' stand still under the <b>ash-trees</b> to light his pipe, then move slowly home.|$|R
