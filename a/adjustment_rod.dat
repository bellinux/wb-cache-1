50|$|Usually, the {{truss rod}} of a brand-new {{instrument}} is adjusted {{by the manufacturer}} before sale. Normally, turning the truss <b>rod's</b> <b>adjustment</b> bolt clockwise tightens it, counteracting the tension of the strings and straightening the neck or creating a backward bow. Turning the bolt counter-clockwise loosens it, allowing string tension {{to act on the}} neck and creating a forward bow (higher string action).|$|R
5000|$|The control <b>rod</b> <b>adjustment</b> {{capabilities}} {{have been}} supplemented {{with the addition}} of an electro-hydraulic Fine Motion Control Rod Drive (FMCRD), allowing for fine position adjustment using an electrical motor, while not losing the reliability or redundancy of traditional hydraulic systems which are designed to accomplish rapid shutdown in [...] from receipt of an initiating signal, or ARI (alternate rod insertion) in a greater but still insignificant time period. The FMCRD also improves defense-in-depth in the event of primary hydraulic and ARI contingencies.|$|R
40|$|JaCoW {{web site}} [URL] 3 -MeV High Intensity Proton Injector (IPHI) RFQ is {{constituted}} by {{the assembly of}} three 2 -m-long segments. The tuning of the end regions of such an accelerator {{with respect to the}} quadrupole mode is generally made by machining the thickness of the end plates. The dipole modes are moved away from the accelerator mode frequency by adding dipole rods and adjusting their length. In the case of the last IPHI RFQ segment, the tuning range given by possible plate thickness was not sufficient to adjust the frequency at 352 Mhz without modifying the notch depth, leading to serious engineering problems for the cooling, new thermo-mechanical simulations and drawings. To avoid these difficulties, a new way has been investigated by replacing the end plate thickness adjustment by a "quadrupole rod" length <b>adjustment.</b> These <b>rods</b> are situated between the beam axis and the dipole rods, and the tuning range is largely increased. The paper will describe this method applied to the IPHI RFQ and some experimental results obtained on the cold model...|$|R
5000|$|The retina has {{a static}} {{contrast}} ratio of around 100:1 (about 6.5 f-stops). As {{soon as the}} eye moves rapidly to acquire a target (saccades), it re-adjusts its exposure by adjusting the iris, which adjusts {{the size of the}} pupil. Initial dark adaptation takes place in approximately four seconds of profound, uninterrupted darkness; full adaptation through <b>adjustments</b> in retinal <b>rod</b> photoreceptors is 80% complete in thirty minutes. The process is nonlinear and multifaceted, so an interruption by light exposure requires restarting the dark adaptation process over again. Full adaptation is dependent on good blood flow; thus dark adaptation may be hampered by retinal disease, poor vascular circulation and high altitude exposure.|$|R
5000|$|Typical modern Telecasters (such as the American Standard version) {{incorporate}} several details {{different from}} the classic form. They typically feature 22 frets (rather than 21) and truss <b>rod</b> <b>adjustment</b> is made at the headstock end, rather than the body end, which had required removal of the neck on the original (the Custom Shop Bajo Sexto Baritone Tele was the only Telecaster featuring a two-octave 24-fret neck). The three-saddle bridge of the original has been replaced with a six-saddle version, allowing independent length and height adjustment for each string. The long saddle bridge screws allow {{a wide range of}} saddle bridge positions for intonation tuning. The stamped metal bridge plate has been replaced with a flat plate, and the removable chromed bridge cover (often called the [...] "ashtray" [...] for its secondary use) has been discontinued for most models; it improved shieldingbut prevented players from muting strings at the bridge and made it impossible to pick near the saddles to produce the characteristic Telecaster 'twang'.|$|R
50|$|Basic {{charging}} pressure is fundamental for Automatic Performance Control (APC). Basic {{charging pressure}} is mechanically adjusted on the actuators pushrod between the actuator and the waste gate. At to low basic charging pressure the engine doesn’t revs up as expected when the throttle is opened quickly. At to high basic charging pressure a negative adaptation occurs and maximum charging pressure cannot be achieved. In addition {{there is a}} substantial risk of engine damage since the charging pressure can’t be lowered enough when regulating with attention to pre ignition/pinging. Basic charging pressure shall be 0,40 ±0,03 bar (5,80 ±0,43 PSI). After <b>adjustment</b> the push <b>rod</b> must have at least two turns (2 mm) pre tension when connecting to the waste gate lever. The purpose with that {{is to make sure that}} the waste gate is held close when not affected. On new turbo chargers the basic charging pressure tends to be near or spot on the upper tolerance when the pre tension is two turns. The pre tension may never be lesser than two turns (2 mm). When checking the basic charging pressure it shall be noted that the pressure decreases at high RPM and increases at low outside temperatures.|$|R
50|$|The snare drum is {{constructed}} of two heads—both usually made of plastic—along with a rattle of metal wires {{on the bottom}} head called the snares. The wires can also {{be placed on the}} top, as in the tarol snare, or both heads {{as in the case of}} the Highland snare drum. The top head is typically called the batter head because that is where the drummer strikes it, while the bottom head is called the snare head because that is where the snares are located. The tension of each head is held constant by tension <b>rods.</b> Tension <b>rod</b> <b>adjustment</b> allows the pitch and tonal character of the drum to be customized by the player. The strainer is a lever that engages or disengages contact between the snares and the head, and allows snare tension adjustment. If the strainer is disengaged, the sound of the drum resembles a tom because the snares are inactive. The rim is the metal ring around the batter head, which can be used for a variety of things, although it is notably used to sound a piercing rimshot with the drumstick.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} focused on the {{influence}} of neck vibration on the perception of the head and trunk midline position (orientation and localization). The orientation of the head and trunk was investigated by the rolling <b>adjustment</b> of a <b>rod</b> on their midline while their localization was investigated by the adjustment of the position of a visual dot as being straight-ahead the eyes or the sternum. The first experiment investigated whether a head-trunk dissociation was induced by the unilateral vibration of neck muscles in upright and restrained subjects. Results showed that the subjective orientation and localization of whole-body midline were shifted toward the vibrated side. The second experiment determined the effect of the neck muscles vibration when the subjects were lying on their side. The effect of vibration disappeared when the side of vibration was opposed to the side of postural inclination and it was stronger than in the upright position when the side of vibration and the side of postural inclination were congruent. Whereas, results suggested that the input from neck muscle proprioceptors participates directly to the elaboration of the egocentric space, the question may be raised as to how the sensory cues interacted in their contribution to the neural generation of an egocentric, body centred coordinate system...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} focused on the {{influence}} of gravity-based information on the orientation and localization of the perceived body midline. The orientation was investigated by the rolling <b>adjustment</b> of a <b>rod</b> on the subjects' Z-axis and the localization by the horizontal adjustment of a visual dot as being straight ahead. Experiment 1 investigated the effect of the dissociation between the Z-axis and the direction of gravity by placing subjects in roll tilt and supine postures. In roll tilt, the perception of the body midline orientation was deviated in the direction of body tilt and the perception of its localization was deviated in the opposite direction. In the supine body orientation, estimates of the Z-axis and straight-ahead remained veridical as when the body was upright. Experiment 2 highlighted the relative importance of the otolithic and tactile information using diffuse pressure stimulation. The estimation of body midline orientation was modified contrarily to the estimation of its localization. Thus, subjects had no absolute representation of their egocentric space. The main hypothesis regarding the dissociation between the orientation and localization of the body midline may be related to a difference in the integration of sensory information. It can be suggested that the horizontal component of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) contributed to the perceived localization of the body midline, whereas its orientation was mainly influenced by tactile information...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} was undertaken to demonstrate, with correlational evidence, that presenting the rod-and-fi’ame test (RFT) with either limited (tachistoscopic) or unlimited (Oltman’s, 1968, porta-ble RFT) exposure time does not significantly affect the ranking of subjects. The underlying hypothesiis {{is that the}} intersubject variability of performance on the portable RFT is due essen-tially to differences in sensitivity to the optostatic vection that appears automatically and almost immediately. Results of the tachistoscopic test show {{that the effect of}} angular size of the stimu-lus is similar to that described in the literature for unlimited time situations, and that subjects’ ranking is very similar regardless of the exposure time (W =. 80). However, although a differ-ence is observed between the means of low and high achievers in beth types of RFT, intraindividual intertask homogeneity (correlation coefficient) is not verified in each of these subgroups. From these results, one can distinguish two processes in the RFT: the first, vections, {{has to do with the}} subject’s postural orientation and seems to play a great role in organizing interindividual differences. The second process, a more cognitive one, has a less striking effect and has to do with the selection of reference frames in perceptual organization. The vertical <b>adjustment</b> of a <b>rod</b> inside a tilted frame (rod-and-frame test, or RFT) produces deviations in the same direction as the orientation of the frame (Witkin & Asch, 1948).
