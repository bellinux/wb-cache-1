5|$|The mind–body problem {{concerns}} {{the explanation of}} the relationship that exists between minds, or mental processes, <b>and</b> <b>bodily</b> states or processes. The main aim of philosophers working {{in this area is}} to determine the nature of the mind and mental states/processes, and how—or even if—minds are affected by and can affect the body.|$|E
5|$|Ascetic {{practices}} (tapas), concentration <b>and</b> <b>bodily</b> postures used by Vedic {{priests to}} conduct yajna (sacrifice), {{might have been}} precursors to yoga. Vratya, a group of ascetics mentioned in the Atharvaveda, emphasized on bodily postures which may have evolved into yogic asanas. Early Samhitas also contain references to other group ascetics such as munis, the keśin, and vratyas. Techniques for controlling breath and vital energies are mentioned in the Brahmanas (texts of the Vedic corpus, c. 1000–800 BCE) and the Atharvaveda. Nasadiya Sukta of the Rig Veda suggests {{the presence of an}} early contemplative tradition.|$|E
5|$|Catholic {{teaching}} regarding sexuality {{calls for}} a practice of chastity, {{with a focus on}} maintaining the spiritual <b>and</b> <b>bodily</b> integrity of the human person. Marriage is considered the only appropriate context for sexual activity. Church teachings about sexuality have become an issue of increasing controversy, especially after the close of the Second Vatican Council, due to changing cultural attitudes in the Western world described as the sexual revolution.|$|E
40|$|Post-printHow do we feel {{our body}} in emotion experience? In this paper I {{initially}} distinguish between foreground <b>and</b> background <b>bodily</b> feelings, <b>and</b> characterize {{them in some}} detail. Then I compare this distinction with the one between reflective <b>and</b> pre-reflective <b>bodily</b> self-awareness one finds in some recent philosophical phenomenological works, and conclude that both foreground <b>and</b> background <b>bodily</b> feelings {{can be understood as}} pre-reflective modes of bodily self-awareness that nevertheless differ in degree of self-presentation or self-intimation. Finally, I use the distinction between foreground <b>and</b> background <b>bodily</b> feelings to characterize the experience of being absorbed in an activity, as opposed to accounts that imply that absorption involves bodily inconspicuousness.

Percentage data may overlap as one criminal act may have several features, which are registered separately, but the total number of crimes is calculated per incident.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} thirty, Mahavira {{abandoned}} the comforts of royal life and left his home and family to live an ascetic life {{in the pursuit of}} spiritual awakening. He undertook severe austerities of fasting <b>and</b> <b>bodily</b> mortifications, meditated under the Ashoka tree, and discarded his clothes. There is a graphic description of his hardships and humiliation in the Acharanga Sutra. According to the Kalpa Sūtra, Mahavira spent the first forty-two monsoons of his life at Astikagrama, Champapuri, Prstichampa, Vaishali, Vanijagrama, Nalanda, Mithila, Bhadrika, Alabhika, Panitabhumi, Shravasti, and Pawapuri. He is said to have lived in Rajagriha during the rainy season of the forty-first year of his ascetic life. This is traditionally dated to have been in 491BC.|$|E

5|$|Henson {{spoke out}} strongly, and {{ultimately}} unsuccessfully, against the proposed disestablishment of the Anglican Church in Wales. In doing so he addressed many nonconformist gatherings; the historian Owen Chadwick {{suggests that this}} may have commended him to David Lloyd George, who became prime minister in 1916. A serious doctrinal row within the Church seemed to many to put Henson {{out of the running}} for elevation to a bishopric. He had defended the right of clergy to express doubts about the virgin birth <b>and</b> <b>bodily</b> resurrection. He was, as most of his critics failed, or refused, to notice, doctrinally orthodox on the resurrection, and content to accept the tradition of the virgin birth, but his contention that other priests had the right to question them was intolerable to the Anglo-Catholic wing of the Church, led by Gore.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{was born}} to British {{immigrants}} in Selukwe, {{a small town in}} the Southern Rhodesian Midlands, four years before the colony became self-governing in 1923. Serving as a Royal Air Force fighter pilot in the Middle East and Europe during the Second World War, he spent months behind German lines in Italy and suffered debilitating facial <b>and</b> <b>bodily</b> wounds that remained conspicuous {{for the rest of his}} life. He set up a farm in his home town in 1948 and, the same year, became Member of Parliament for Selukwe—at 29 years old, the country's youngest ever MP. Originally a Liberal, he defected to the United Federal Party in 1953, and served as Chief Whip from 1958 onwards. He left in 1961 in protest at the territory's new constitution, and the following year helped Winston Field to form the all-White, firmly conservative Rhodesian Front (RF), which called for independence without an immediate shift to Black majority rule.|$|E
5|$|The Jain texts further {{illustrate}} {{the effects of}} leśyās on the mental dispositions of a soul, using {{an example of the}} reactions of six travellers on seeing a fruit-bearing tree. They see a tree laden with fruit and begin to think of getting those fruits: one of them suggests uprooting the entire tree and eating the fruit; the second one suggests cutting the trunk of the tree; the third one suggests simply cutting the branches; the fourth one suggests cutting the twigs and sparing the branches and the tree; the fifth one suggests plucking only the fruits; the sixth one suggests picking up only the fruits that have fallen down. The thoughts, words <b>and</b> <b>bodily</b> activities of each of these six travellers are different based on their mental dispositions and are respectively illustrative of the six leśyās. At one extreme, the person with the black leśyā, having evil disposition, thinks of uprooting the whole tree even though he wants to eat only one fruit. At the other extreme, the person with the white leśyā, having a pure disposition, thinks of picking up the fallen fruit, in order to spare the tree.|$|E
