40|$|Abstract: This paper {{tests for}} the direct <b>wealth</b> effect versus <b>an</b> {{indirect}} <b>wealth</b> effect in aggregate data on U. S. households over four distinct sub-periods from 1952 through 2011. We use recent time series techniques {{to distinguish between}} the direct wealth effect from indirect channels which may operate through personal disposable income or liabilities. We find evidence of <b>a</b> direct <b>wealth</b> effect for housing wealth, in particular, from 1998 to 2011. The responses of consumption in the 1998 to 2011 period are in contrast to an indirect or “common cause ” explanation of the wealth effect. For financial wealth, there is some evidence of <b>a</b> direct <b>wealth</b> effect for the 1998 to 2011 period, but the effect overall is smaller than for tangible wealth. Also, before 1998 the evidence for <b>a</b> direct <b>wealth</b> effect from either housing wealth or financial wealth is weak...|$|R

Grassi concluded that the comet was a fiery body which had moved along a segment of a great circle at a constant distance from the earth, and since it moved in the sky more slowly than the moon, it must be farther away than the moon.|$|E
