25|$|Stokes' wave {{theory is}} of direct {{practical}} use for waves on intermediate and deep water. It {{is used in}} the design of coastal and offshore structures, {{in order to determine the}} wave kinematics (free surface elevation and flow velocities). The wave kinematics are subsequently needed in the design process to determine the wave loads on a structure. For long waves (as compared to depth) – and using only a few terms in the Stokes expansion – its <b>applicability</b> <b>is</b> limited to waves of small amplitude. In such shallow water, a cnoidal wave theory often provides better periodic-wave approximations.|$|E
