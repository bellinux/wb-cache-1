5|$|The Pythagorean tiling may be {{generalized}} to a three-dimensional tiling of Euclidean space by cubes of two different sizes, which also is unilateral and equitransitive. Attila Bölcskei calls this three-dimensional tiling the Rogers filling. He conjectures that, in <b>any</b> <b>dimension</b> greater than three, there is again a unique unilateral and equitransitive way of tiling space by hypercubes of two different sizes.|$|E
5|$|This is the set {{of points}} in 3-dimensional Euclidean space found exactly one unit away from the origin. It is called the 2-sphere, S2, for reasons given below. The same idea applies for <b>any</b> <b>dimension</b> n; the {{equation}} x02 + x12 + ⋯ + x'n2 = 1 produces the n-sphere as a geometric object in (n + 1)-dimensional space. For example, the 1-sphere S1 is a circle.|$|E
5|$|A {{continuous}} map between two topological spaces induces a group homomorphism between the associated homotopy groups. In particular, if the map is a continuous bijection (a homeomorphism), {{so that the}} two spaces have the same topology, then their i-th homotopy groups are isomorphic for all i. However, the real plane has exactly the same homotopy groups as a solitary point (as does a Euclidean space of <b>any</b> <b>dimension),</b> and the real plane with a point removed has the same groups as a circle, so groups alone are not enough to distinguish spaces. Although the loss of discrimination power is unfortunate, it can also make certain computations easier.|$|E

25|$|As {{suggested}} by their name {{and that of}} the algebra, one of the attractions of bivectors is that they have a natural geometric interpretation. This can be described in <b>any</b> <b>dimension</b> but is best done in three where parallels can be drawn with more familiar objects, before being applied to higher dimensions. In two dimensions the geometric interpretation is trivial, as the space is two-dimensional so has only one plane, and all bivectors are associated with it differing only by a scale factor.|$|E
