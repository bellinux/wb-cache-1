5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the storm, extensive psychological effects were documented. Difficulty during clean-up and recovery lead to increased divorce rates and a spike in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The cases of PTSD primarily impacted children. <b>A</b> <b>sampling</b> of 378adolescents by the University of South Carolina's Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics indicated that 3% of males and 9% of females met the criteria for PTSD. Dozens of children in the area attempted suicide, while counselors reported that between 50 and 60children discussed killing themselves between December1992 and January1993. A panel of psychiatrists and psychologists at the University of Miami agreed that as many as 90% of residents in the worst impacted areas would experience at least a few symptoms of PTSD. Within six months, the circumstances related to {{the aftermath}} of Andrew led to at least five suicides and four homicides.|$|E

5|$|Reef {{environments in}} Biscayne National Park have seen declines in species {{richness}} and diversity across all fish species from 1977 to 1981 to 2006–2007. <b>A</b> <b>sampling</b> program showed declines at all sampling sites. A correlation has been posited between the observed decline in coral reef coverage throughout the Florida Reef tract {{and the decline}} in fish species. Declines in populations were noted in both gamefish and in fish species not exposed to fishing pressure. Algal cover has increased as coral has declined, so that coral-dwelling species have decreased while herbivorous fish have increased. Increased overall salinity and changing salinity gradients in Biscayne Bay may also play a role, while polychlorinated biphenyl and mercury contamination have been noted in fish samples.|$|E
