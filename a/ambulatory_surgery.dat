This study evaluated {{the efficacy of}} BIS- and AAI-guided sevoflurane anesthesia in children receiving <b>ambulatory</b> urologic <b>surgeries.</b> Methods: One hundred sixty children (aged 3 – 12 years) undergoing <b>ambulatory</b> urologic <b>surgery</b> were randomized to receive sevoflurane anesthesia controlled either solely by clinical parameters (standard practice group), BIS-guided group within the BIS range of 40 – 60 (BIS group), or AAI-guided group within the AAI range of 15 – 30 (AAI group). The primary outcome was the recovery time, and the secondary outcome was the quality of recovery, including the incidence of emergency delirium measured by Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium score, incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, and parental satisfaction. Results: Compared with the standard practice group, patients with BIS or AAI monitoring had shortened recovery time and consumed less sevoflurane. There {{were no significant differences}} in the incidences of emergence delirium, postoperative nausea and vomiting, or parental satisfaction among the three groups. Conclusion: BIS- and AAI- guided titration sevoflurane anesthesia could result in shortened recovery and reduced sevoflurane concentration and consumption without affecting the quality of recovery in children receiving <b>ambulatory</b> urologic <b>surgery.</b> The beneficial effects of AAI- and BIS-guided anesthesia in pediatric <b>ambulatory</b> <b>surgeries</b> are similar...|$|R

25|$|The International Council Of Nursing (ICN), {{the largest}} {{international}} health professional {{organization in the}} world, recognizes the shortage of nurses as a growing crisis in the world. This shortage impacts the healthcare of everyone worldwide. One of the many reasons is that nurses who pursue to become nurses do so very late in their lives. This leads to a non-lengthy employment time. A national survey prepared by the Federation of Nurses and Health Professionals in 2001 found that one in five nurses plans to leave the profession within five years because of unsatisfactory working conditions, including low pay, severe under staffing, high stress, physical demands, mandatory overtime, and irregular hours. Approximately 29.8 percent of all nursing jobs are found in hospitals. However, because of administrative cost cutting, increased nurse's workload, and rapid growth of outpatient services, hospital nursing jobs will experience slower than average growth. Employment in home care and nursing homes {{is expected to grow}} rapidly. Though more people are living well into their 80s and 90s, many need the kind of long-term care available at a nursing home. Many nurses will also be needed to help staff the growing number of out-patient facilities, such as HMOs, group medical practices, and <b>ambulatory</b> <b>surgery</b> centers. Nursing specialties will be in great demand. There are, in addition, many part-time employment possibilities.|$|E

40|$|Background and Aims: Flupirtine maleate is a {{centrally}} acting, non-opioid analgesic {{with unique}} muscle relaxant properties {{as compared to}} common analgesics. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare post-operative analgesic efficacy of flupirtine maleate and ibuprofen in patients undergoing gynaecological <b>ambulatory</b> <b>surgeries.</b> Methods: This prospective, randomised controlled study was conducted in 60 women of American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I/II, 18 - 70 years of age and scheduled to undergo gynaecological <b>ambulatory</b> <b>surgeries.</b> The participants were randomised to receive either 100 mg oral flupirtine maleate (group flupirtine, n = 30) or 800 mg oral ibuprofen (group ibuprofen, n = 30), 1 h prior to surgery and then every 8 h for 48 h. Verbal Numerical Rating Scale (VNRS) on movement was assessed at 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 h following surgery. Following discharge from hospital, the patients were interviewed telephonically at 12, 24 and 48 h post-operatively. VNRS was statistically analysed using Mann-Whitney test. Results: VNRS on movement was statistically reduced at 2 h after surgery (P = 0. 04) in group flupirtine as compared to group ibuprofen. The analgesic efficacy was similar in both the groups at 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 and 48 h after surgery. The satisfaction scores at 24 and 48 h post-operatively were superior in group flupirtine as compared to group ibuprofen (P < 0. 001).

40|$|Background and Aim: The newer {{trend in}} {{regional}} anaesthesia for <b>ambulatory</b> anorectal <b>surgeries</b> advocate use of lower dose of local anaesthetic, providing segmental block with adjuvants such as opioids and α 2 agonists to prolong analgesia. The current study investigated effects of addition of 5 μg of dexmedetomidine to 6 mg of hyperbaric bupivacaine on duration of analgesia, sensory and motor block characteristics for perianal <b>ambulatory</b> <b>surgeries.</b> Methods: This {{study is a}} prospective randomised controlled double blind study. Forty adult patients between 18 and 55 years of age were divided into 2 groups. Group D received intrathecal 0. 5 % hyperbaric bupivacaine 6 mg (1. 2 ml) with injection dexmedetomidine 5 μg in 0. 5 ml of normal saline and Group N received intrathecal 0. 5 % hyperbaric bupivacaine 6 mg (1. 2 ml) with 0. 5 ml of normal saline. The parameters assessed were time to regression of sensory blockade, motor blockade, ambulation, time to void, first administration of analgesic. Statistical analysis was done using appropriate tests. Results: Time for regression of sensory level and time for first administration of analgesic were prolonged in Group D (430. 05 ± 89. 13 min, 459. 8 ± 100. 9 min, respectively) in comparison to Group N (301. 10 ± 94. 86 min, 321. 85 ± 95. 08 min, respectively). However, the duration of motor blockade, time to ambulation, and time to void were also significantly prolonged in Group D (323. 05 ± 54. 58 min, 329. 55 ± 54. 06 min, 422. 30 ± 87. 59 min) than in Group N (220. 10 ± 63. 61 min, 221. 60 ± 63. 84 min, 328. 45 ± 113. 38 min).

Full details of the study methodology can be found on Prospero, a systematic review register. Five studies satisfied our eligibility criteria: three reporting on acupuncture, one on homeopathy, and one on acupoints. Acupoint pressure was the only study that demonstrated reduced pain compared with placebo. This study was the least methodologically robust.
