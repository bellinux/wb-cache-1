500|$|They {{admitted}} that Ray was a thief and burglar, but {{claimed that he}} had no record of committing violent crimes with a weapon. However, prison records in different U.S. cities have shown that he was incarcerated on numerous occasions for charges of armed robbery. In a 2008 interview with CNN, Jerry Ray, the younger brother of James Earl Ray, claimed that James was smart and was sometimes able to get away with armed robbery. Jerry Ray said that he had assisted his brother on one such robbery. [...] "I never been with nobody as bold as he is," [...] Jerry said. [...] "He just walked in <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>that</b> gun on somebody, it was just like it's an everyday thing." ...|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Sins of My Father" [...] {{is about}} being a [...] "tortured soul" [...] in a [...] "volatile" [...] {{relationship}}. Trent Fitzgerald of PopCrush hinted at Foster to be the bases of the song. The narrator [...] "believes that his bad relationship is karma for his father being a rolling stone." [...] "Sins of My Father" [...] begins with Usher gasping [...] "My sons, Keep them... please forgive me." [...] Unterberger of Popdust concluded that the track gets more intense, as Usher sings in the song’s opening verse: [...] "I think this woman went and put a hex on me / Oh now, why’d I let her go <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>that</b> sex on me?". The pre-chorus features Usher yelping in falsetto: [...] "But she didn’t make me pay for it with my money! / OWWWW!!!". According to Erika Ramirez of Billboard magazine, [...] "Usher soulfully pays for his father's promiscuous ways over melodic soundcapes".|$|E
500|$|The plot of Monsters University details Mike and Sulley's first meeting, {{but this}} created a {{continuity}} error {{from the first}} film in which Mike tells Sulley [...] "You've been jealous of my good looks since the fourth grade." [...] Director Dan Scanlon {{said he had a}} dilemma with this line during pre-production, but he believed it was best if Mike and Sulley meet in college because, [...] "we wanted to see their relationship develop when they were adults. And we also felt like college is so much about self-discovery and figuring out who you are." [...] He added, [...] "It felt like the perfect place to do this, but we had that line. So we tried versions where they met young and then we skipped ahead to college. And we knew we didn't want to make Monsters Elementary." [...] Scanlon said during pre-production that, [...] "Pete Docter, the original director, and John Lasseter…finally said to me, 'it's great that you're honoring that, but you have to do what's right for the story.' So we made a tough decision to just have them be in college <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>that</b> line aside." [...] Scanlon later retconned the line from the first film as [...] "an old monster expression", saying that [...] "it's what monsters always say to each other." ...|$|E

500|$|Upon its release, MTV Unplugged {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from contemporary music critics. AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album {{three out of}} five stars, praising Katy for being a hard working music act and [...] "seeming more likeable here than she did on her debut", though he noted that her flaws were [...] "amplified" [...] during the performance. Sahar from Blogcritics was more positive about the set, writing that although Perry was not the [...] "best singer out there", she made up for it [...] "in catchiness and..... adorableness". The contributor was more negative of the acoustic version of [...] "I Kissed a Girl" [...] {{and the fact that}} MTV cut out parts from the video recording: [...] "What I'd like to have seen is for MTV to make Katy Perry enter into an unscripted dialog with the fans that are there, film the whole thing <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>that</b> on a DVD – then you will really have something unplugged. For how can you truly know an artist if we don't see such interactions?" [...] Becky Bain from website Idolator favored Perry's live voice and her natural presentation, though she was ambivalent towards the decision of giving the songs an acoustic treatment. She {{went on to say that}} the MTV Unplugged versions of Perry's songs were not able to substitute the [...] "glossy originals". Simon Vozick-Levinson from Entertainment Weekly gave the live album a D, opining that [...] "the stripped-down treatment of MTV Unplugged does Perry's yowling voice no favors", and that [...] " [...] songs just aren't solid enough to stand on their own without loads of glossy production". Catherine Lewis of The Washington Post praised Perry's [...] "translate her more rambunctious numbers into an acoustic format" [...] and wrote album was [...] "definitely a step in a good — and unexpected — direction".|$|E
2500|$|Recently, similar {{methods to}} {{determine}} chlorophyll content in leaves non-destructively {{have been applied}} to measuring anthocyanin content. [...] There are now a couple of optical absorbance instruments available commercially which are designed to measure and compute an index value that correlates highly with the actual amount of anthocyanin content in a sample. [...] To use with grapes, the skin is removed and placed across the sensor of the meter. [...] Measurements take only a second or two. [...] These Anthocyanin Content Meters use an additional Near Infra-Red (NIR) signal, which {{takes into account the}} thickness of the sample, along with the absorbance wavelength to calculate a very accurate index value which is repeatable and consistent enough for comparative testing. [...] A new method just being explored is to dip a piece of filter paper into a solution/sample to be measured <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>that</b> across the sensor head as the test sample. [...] There have been positive reports on the second method, but they have not been published.|$|E
2500|$|The Republicans in the Minnesota House {{dismissed}} {{the idea of}} speech being an ethics violation, maintaining “Lindner's comments were offensive, but Lindner {{has the right to}} say them.” Republican House Speaker Steve Sviggum pointed out that [...] "House Republicans didn't complain when Rep. Tom Rukavina, DFL-Virginia, called State Auditor Pat Awada, 'Osama Bin Awada'" [...] when Awada proposed to curb local government aid. Sviggum said [...] "everyone is entitled to First Amendment rights. 'At some point or another people have freedom of speech even though that speech may not be appropriate, politically correct or even the most wise speech.'" [...] Sviggum said [...] "I don't think that we want to take this to the ultimate end <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>that</b> chilling effect upon speech, upon feeling, upon values and principals that one has or doesn't have in this entire process." [...] Lindner also invoked freedom of speech, saying [...] "I still believe in the First Amendment -- that we're allowed to express our views and so forth -- and it's getting close to maybe not being able to do that, but while we can, I'm doing it." [...] In their rebuttal the House Republicans also played a recording of Ellison’s interview with a radio station. In the interview Ellison had said “People should feel free to express themselves as long as they don’t violate the law. ...I would never invoke the powers of the state to restrict Arlon Lindner from expressing himself.” ...|$|E
