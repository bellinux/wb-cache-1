Ruth then turned to Usha for support, before returning home to David, who observed Ruth's emotional state. After Sam quit his job, Ruth eventually told David the truth about what happened. Bentinck explained that when he and Finch finished recording the scene, they were both crying as it had been very distressing. David was initially unable to forgive Ruth for her actions, but after speaking to Usha and gaining some perspective, over time things between himself and Ruth became easier.|$|E

25|$|In {{the poem}} Lalla Radha and the Churel, a priest warns the protagonist to not go near the Peepul trees {{because that is}} where the Churel lives and she might take him away and kill him. He still went to the Peepul tree <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>called</b> out to him in a sweet tone and seduced him until he went to her. Blinded by his desire, he did not notice that while he lay with her, his body seemed to get frailer until he died in a state of ecstasy. In The Female Element in Indian Culture, it says, “The Churel runs after and seeks to possess every man whom she meets, for, it is said, her carnal {{appetite}} remains unsatisfied in life”. She also possesses girls during dances, causing a trance. According to Persian legend, when travelers saw the tracks of a Churel in the dirt they would try to flee by heading in the opposite direction, but her reversed feet would inevitably lead them right into her grasp. The Patari and Majhwar think that she appears to take her victims to the mountains and {{the only way they can}} be freed is if a goat is sacrificed.|$|E

500|$|At the USAID preview screening, actress Lucy Liu, who {{has worked}} with MTV EXIT and {{produced}} the documentary film Redlight, said that people who watch Not My Life [...] "will be shocked to find [...] is happening in America"; she said that there were 80,000 women being sexually assaulted daily <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>called</b> human trafficking the [...] "cannibalization of the planet's youth." [...] According to UN.GIFT, before Not My Life, there was [...] "no single communication tool that effectively depict the problem as a whole for a mass audience." [...] Susan Bissell, UNICEF's Child Protection Section chief, agreed with this assertion, and said that the film [...] "takes {{a close look at the}} underlying causality that so many other filmmakers have missed [...] it will change the way we see our lives, in some very fundamental ways." [...] She also said that Not My Life is an important documentary because it brings attention to underreported forms of abuse. A reviewer from Medical News Today praised the film for [...] "raising awareness and speaking about taboo subjects," [...] arguing that these activities [...] "are critical to empower families, communities, and governments to speak out honestly and take action against abuses." ...|$|E
500|$|Observers {{described}} the Reagans' relationship as close, authentic and intimate.

500|$|The entire storyline that {{centered}} around Quinn, Puck and Shelby was roundly criticized by reviewers. West wrote {{that it made}} her feel [...] "queasy", <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>called</b> Quinn's actions [...] "abhorrent". Bell was one of several who thought it was highly implausible that Child Protective Services would be backed up, much less for two weeks, given the gravity of Quinn's accusations. Hankinson wondered why they [...] "made Quinn a total sociopath" [...] who went from [...] "dancing on desks" [...] to [...] "framing someone for child endangerment" [...] with great ease; VanDerWerff was also critical of these actions, and called Quinn's sabotage of Shelby's apartment [...] "a move that takes a potentially good character, played by a fine actress, and just guts her". Kevin P. Sullivan of MTV had a different view, and wrote that the [...] "storyline stuck out throughout the episode as the most interesting". He also noted that it was [...] "cathartic and definitely nice to see a sweeter Puck balance out the earnest craziness of Quinn". The final scene of the episode, when Puck kissed Shelby, was characterized as [...] "creepy" [...] and [...] "super awkward" [...] by Bell, as either [...] "super creepy" [...] or [...] "romantic" [...] by BuddyTV John Kubicek, as [...] "groan-inducing" [...] in the [...] "You're actually going to go there?" [...] vein by Canning and [...] "as realistic as Lord Tubbington pooping candy bars" [...] by Michael Slezak of TVLine.|$|E
