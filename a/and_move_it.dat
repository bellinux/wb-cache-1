5|$|James Kinzie {{built the}} Green Tree Tavern at the northeastern corner of Canal and Lake Streets in 1833. The tavern {{went through a}} {{succession}} of owners and name changes before being moved in 1880 to 33, 35, and 37 Milwaukee Avenue. In 1902 plans were made to preserve the building <b>and</b> <b>move</b> <b>it</b> to Garfield Park, however the hotel collapsed before work could start on this project.|$|E
5|$|That summer, the Canadiens' {{franchise}} was for sale, {{after posting}} losses of $60,000 {{over the previous}} two seasons. Over forty thousand families and 150,000 individuals were receiving social assistance in Montreal. Owners Leo Dandurand and Joseph Cattarinich held negotiations with A. C. Sutphin to sell the club <b>and</b> <b>move</b> <b>it</b> to Cleveland. Just before the season, a syndicate of local Montreal businessmen, led by Maurice Forget and Ernest Savard, stepped forward to buy the club and prevent the transfer.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{mission to}} move a {{metallic}} disc {{from one side of}} an arena to another with a completely autonomous flying robot was seen by many as almost impossible. The college teams continued to improve their entries {{over the next two years}} when the competition saw its first autonomous takeoff, flight, and landing by a team from the Georgia Institute of Technology. Three years later in 1995 a team from Stanford University was able to acquire a single disk <b>and</b> <b>move</b> <b>it</b> from one side of the arena to the other in a fully autonomous flight—half a decade earlier than some pundits had predicted.|$|E

5|$|One further {{proposal}} {{was made to}} rebury Lody in the 1960s. In 1959 the British and German governments agreed to move German war dead who had been buried in various locations around the UK to a new central cemetery at Cannock Chase in Staffordshire. The German War Graves Commission (VDK) asked {{if it would be}} possible to disinter Lody's body <b>and</b> <b>move</b> <b>it</b> to Cannock Chase. By that time, the plot had been reused for further common graves, buried above Lody's body. The VDK was told that it would not be possible to disinter the other bodies without the permission of the relatives, which would have been an almost impossible task where common graves were concerned. The {{proposal was}} abandoned and Lody's body remains at Plaistow.|$|E
5|$|Powers {{helped the}} police perform a sting operation, telling Seymour {{that the police}} knew what had {{happened}} and {{that the only way to}} save Williams was to dig up the gun <b>and</b> <b>move</b> <b>it</b> to somewhere more safe. When Seymour and Powers went to do this, several policemen (who had been lying in wait) immediately arrested her and Powers (who was released a few hours later). Seymour was in a poor condition both physically and mentally, and after a few hours she wrote and signed a statement which incriminated Williams. Powers again helped the police, convincing Williams to meet him at Moorgate station, where Williams was arrested by the police and charged with the murder of Arthur Walls. Williams maintained that he was innocent of the murder and burglary.|$|E
5|$|Returning after {{a one-year}} hiatus {{and despite the}} return of players such as Cooney Weiland, Finnigan, Howe and Kilrea, the Senators {{finished}} with the worst record {{in the league in}} the two seasons that followed. Attendance was poor, the club only drawing well when the league's other three Canadian teams came to town. Frank Finnigan recalled that they frequently played home games before small crowds of 3,500 to 4,000. 1932–33 saw the return of Cy Denneny to Ottawa as coach. He would last only the one season. In June 1933, former captain Harvey Pulford was given an option to buy the team <b>and</b> <b>move</b> <b>it</b> to Baltimore, but the option was never exercised. In October 1933, Kilrea was sold for $10,000 to Toronto.|$|E

5|$|The GHMix2.0 mode {{allows one}} to {{precisely}} create songs up to 10 min, and includes pre-defined sample tracks that can be modified on a note-by-note basis as desired. The new Jam mode lets the players select one of several standard pre-set rhythms and then play along with it on the instrument controllers in a free-form mode; however, players can then capture any segment of this music <b>and</b> <b>move</b> <b>it</b> to the Mix mode to compile a song. User songs are then uploaded and downloaded through the GHTunes mode of the Music Studio. While songs that violate copyright will still {{be removed from the}} service, Neversoft will be less aggressive about this and will rely more on user feedback on such issues. The PS2 version does not support this feature.|$|E
5|$|With {{losses of}} $60,000 over the {{previous}} two seasons, the Canadiens were put up for sale in 1935. Dandurand and Cattarinich entered negotiations to sell the club <b>and</b> <b>move</b> <b>it</b> to Cleveland, Ohio, but a syndicate of local Montreal businessmen led by Maurice Forget and Ernest Savard stepped forward to buy the team and prevent the transfer. The Canadiens struggled on the ice, finishing with the worst record {{in the league in}} 1935–36. The new owners asked Cecil Hart to coach the team, in the hopes that he would bring the Habs back to respectability. Hart agreed with one stipulation: that the Canadiens bring back Morenz. The team agreed, and acquired an overjoyed Morenz in a trade with the New York Rangers.|$|E
5|$|By the 1994 NBA All-Star Game, {{speculation}} as {{to whether}} or not the Timberwolves would remain in Minneapolis following the 1994–95 season became an issue. On February 11, 1994, NBA commissioner David Stern announced that he and his representatives would serve as mediators in an effort to resolve issues related to the debt owed on the Target Center, the Timberwolves home arena. The Timberwolves ownership was seeking a public or private entity to purchase the $73 million remaining on the arena's mortgage, otherwise the team would be sold and in all likelihood moved from Minnesota. Although mediation talks were just beginning to keep the team in place, by the following week it was revealed that ownership had met with representatives from San Diego, Nashville and New Orleans to discuss the potential relocation of the franchise. By late February, New Orleans emerged as the likely city for the team to relocate to if a deal could not be reached to keep the team in Minneapolis. This became the case after the potential ownership group Top Rank signed a letter of intent to purchase the team <b>and</b> <b>move</b> <b>it</b> to New Orleans if debt issues at the Target Center were not resolved.|$|E

5|$|In January1975, Caltrans {{presented}} {{plans to}} realign SR76 away from Mission Avenue <b>and</b> <b>move</b> <b>it</b> {{to the south}} side of the San Luis Rey River from I-5 to Frontier Drive. One member of the Tri-Cities Taxpayers' League suggested that the freeway be built on the northern side of the river, and follow the river all the way east to I-15. Following concerns that the project would be cancelled due to lack of state funding, the California Highway Commission (CHC) stated that the proposal was still being considered. The City of Oceanside raised concerns about the congestion on Mission Avenue, as well as the realignment being a part of the city master plan. After this, at the start of the next year, the CHC decided to keep the proposal, though there were concerns that construction would be delayed due to the state financial crisis. Caltrans stated a few months later that SR76 would be delayed because of the funding issues and the relatively low levels of traffic that would not support building a freeway. Following this, State Senator John Stull alleged that Caltrans head Adriana Gianturco was purposefully delaying the project by delaying the release of the environmental impact report. A petition drive began soon after, supported by many North County leaders, with the exception of Bonsall due to concerns about a full freeway running through the community.|$|E

25|$|Pieces cannot move {{until they}} have been dalled. A die showing the dal allows the player to dal one piece, which means to turn it {{parallel}} to its row <b>and</b> <b>move</b> <b>it</b> one position ahead. With the first dal, only the piece closest to the stern can be dalled, and then it goes into row C. With no dalled pieces, a throw with no dals is a lost move.|$|E
25|$|The bridge {{has been}} damaged from {{numerous}} small fires {{and has been}} the site of constant vandalism over the years. There were several proposals to dismantle the bridge <b>and</b> <b>move</b> <b>it</b> to a more secure location where {{it would not be}} vandalized. Another proposal was to build another bridge to bypass the original bridge, as it is too narrow to allow a variety of vehicles to cross it, including snowplows, fire trucks, and ambulances.|$|E

25|$|The renter Nathaniel H. Ragland then {{purchased}} the property for $1,250 in 1872. After Nathaniel died in 1888, his widow Martha sold {{the property in}} 1891 for $10,000 to a Captain Myron Dunlap of Niagara Falls, New York. Dunlap and some other investors who participated devised a few plans intending {{to capitalize on the}} notoriety of the property. One idea was to completely take apart the wooden house <b>and</b> <b>move</b> <b>it</b> to Chicago as an exhibit for the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893. This plan fell through due to lack of total interest of all the investors involved.|$|E
