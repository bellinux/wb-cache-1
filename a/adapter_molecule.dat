5000|$|Initially, it {{was thought}} that RNA served as a {{structural}} template for protein synthesis, essentially ordering amino acids by a series of cavities shaped specifically so that only specific amino acids would fit. Crick was not satisfied with this hypothesis given that the four bases of RNA are hydrophilic and that many amino acids prefer interactions with hydrophobic groups. Additionally, some amino acids are very structurally similar and Crick felt that accurate discrimination would not be possible given the similarities. Crick then proposed that prior to incorporation into proteins, amino acids are first attached to <b>adapter</b> <b>molecules</b> which have unique surface features that can bind to specific bases on the RNA templates.

25|$|When activated, {{toll-like}} receptors (TLRs) take <b>adapter</b> <b>molecules</b> {{within the}} cytoplasm of cells {{in order to}} propagate a signal. Four adaptor molecules {{are known to be}} involved in signaling, which are Myd88, TIRAP, TRIF, and TRAM. These adapters activate other intracellular molecules such as IRAK1, IRAK4, TBK1, and IKKi that amplify the signal, eventually leading to the induction or suppression of genes that cause certain responses. Thousands of genes are activated by TLR signaling, implying that this method constitutes an important gateway for gene modulation.|$|R
40|$|Conditionally replicative adenoviruses (CRAds) are {{potentially}} useful agents for anticancer virotherapy approaches. However, lack of coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) expression on many primary tumor cells limits the oncolytic potency of CRAds. This makes {{the concept of}} targeting, that is, redirecting infection via CAR-independent entry pathways, relevant for CRAd development. Bispecific <b>adapter</b> <b>molecules</b> constitute highly versatile means for adenovirus targeting. Here, we constructed a CRAd with the Delta 24 E 1 A mutation that produces a bispecific single-chain antibody directed towards the adenovirus fiber knob and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). This EGFR-targeted CRAd exhibited increased infection efficiency and oncolytic replication on CAR-deficient cancer cells and augmented lateral spread in CAR-deficient 3 -D tumor spheroids in vitro. When compared to its parent control with native tropism, the new CRAd exhibited similar cytotoxicity on CAR-positive cancer cells, but up to 1000 -fold enhanced oncolytic potency on CAR-deficient, EGFR-positive cancer cells. In addition, EGFR-targeted CRAd killed primary human CAR-deficient brain tumor specimens that were refractory to the parent control virus. We conclude, therefore, that CRAds expressing bispecific targeting <b>adapter</b> <b>molecules</b> are promising agents for cancer treatment. Their use is {{likely to result in}} enhanced oncolytic replication in cancerous tissues and thus in more effective tumor regression...|$|R

EBNA2-hSNF5/Ini1 interaction adds credit {{to the idea that}} EBNA2 facilitates transcriptional transactivation by acting as a transcription <b>adapter</b> <b>molecule.</b> Possibly, EBNA2 engages the hSNF-SWI complex to generate an open chromatin conformation at the EBNA2-responsive target genes.

The protein encoded by this gene is a TIR adaptor protein involved in the TLR4 signaling pathway of the immune system. It activates NF-kappa-B, MAPK1, MAPK3 and JNK, which then results in cytokine secretion and the inflammatory response. Alternative splicing of this gene results in several transcript variants; however, not all variants have been fully described.|$|E
40|$|In {{addition}} to being the natural genetic information carrier, DNA can {{also serve as a}} versatile material for construction of nanoscale objects. By using the base-pairing properties of DNA, {{we have been able to}} mass-produce nano-scale structures in a variety of different shapes, upon which patterns of other molecules can be further specified. The diversity of molecules and materials that can be attached to DNA and the capability of providing precise spatial positioning considerably enhance the attractiveness of DNA for nano-scale construction. A further challenge remains to use these DNA based structures for biomedical applications. As proof-of-concept, a DNA-based nanodevice for multivalent thrombolytic delivery is designed, which intends to employ DNA nanostructures as carriers for the delivery of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and plasminogen. Universal modular <b>adapter</b> <b>molecules</b> that can simultaneously bind "down" to the DNA structures and "up" to these thrombolytic drugs are further proposed. We begin with exploring the molecular recognition properties provided by biotin-avidin and aptamer-ligand pairs, and are able to achieve site-specific display of certain protein targets along the DNA nanostructure scaffold. Yet for both of these approaches, only biotinylated or specially selected proteins can be patterned. We further propose to develop single-chain diabodies (scDb) as the <b>adapter</b> <b>molecules.</b> This scDb approach is highly modular and can be extended to assemble virtually any proteins and therapeutic molecules of interests, which at the same time will greatly enhance our molecular toolbox for nanoscale construction.

50|$|An {{additional}} Rap1 effector {{provides a}} link between Rap1 and the actin cytoskeleton. RIAM (Rap1-GTP-interacting <b>adapter</b> <b>molecule)</b> is a broadly expressed adaptor protein that contains an RA (Ras association)-like domain, a PH domain, and several proline-rich sequences. Like RAPL, RIAM interacts preferentially with active Rap1, and overexpression of RIAM enhances integrin-mediated adhesion. In addition, knockdown of RIAM inhibits adhesion induced by active Rap1 and inhibits the localization of active Rap1 at the plasma membrane. The ability of RIAM to associate with profilin, Ena/VASP proteins, and talin suggests that RIAM promotes Rap1-dependent integrin activation through effects on the actin cytoskeleton, particularly the interaction of talin with integrin cytoplasmic tails. Given the known role of talin in regulating integrin affinity, RIAM may provide an Mst1-independent mechanism by which Rap1 regulates integrin affinity.|$|E

40|$|Toll-like receptors (TLRs) {{are central}} to innate {{immunity}} and yet their expression is widespread and not restricted to professional inflammatory cells. TLRs have been reported on adipocytes and have been implicated in obesity-associated pathologies such as diabetes. Why TLRs are found on adipocytes is not clear although one hypothesis is that they may coordinate energy utilization for the energy intensive process of an immune response. We have explored TLR signalling in primary human in vitro differentiated adipocytes and investigated the specific <b>adapter</b> <b>molecules</b> that are involved. Only lipopolysaccharide (LPS), poly(I:C), Pam 3 CSK 4 and MALP- 2 could induce the production of IL- 6, IL- 8 and MCP- 1 by adipocytes. Poly(I:C) alone caused a strong induction of type I interferons, as assessed by IP- 10 production. Using siRNA, {{it was confirmed that}} LPS-dependent signalling in adipocytes occurs via TLR 4 utilizing the <b>adapter</b> <b>molecules</b> MyD 88, Mal and TRIF and caused rapid degradation of IκBα. Pam 3 CSK 4 signalling utilized TLR 2, MyD 88 and Mal (but not TRIF). However, the response to poly(I:C) observed in these cells appeared not to require TRIF, but MyD 88 was required for induction of NFκB-dependent cytokines by Poly(I:C). Despite this, IκBα degradation could not be detected in poly(I:C) stimulated adipocytes at any time-point up to 4 h. Indeed, IL- 6 transcription was not induced until 8 - 16 h after exposure. These data suggest that Pam 3 CSK 4 and LPS signal via the expected routes in human adipocytes, whereas poly(I:C) /TLR 3 signalling may act via a TRIF-independent, MyD 88 -dependent route...|$|R
