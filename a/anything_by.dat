He became a founding director, publicist, and in due course a contributor, mostly anonymously. He was soon {{at odds with the}} magazine's editor, Clifford Sharp, who by 1916 was rejecting his contributions—"the only paper in the world that refuses to print <b>anything</b> <b>by</b> me", according to Shaw.|$|E
25|$|In November 2004, however, Hauritz and leg spinner Cameron White were {{surprise}} selections {{ahead of}} Stuart MacGill for Australia's tour of India. The reasoning {{given by the}} selectors was that as they intended to play only one spinner—Shane Warne—MacGill was unlikely to play so they would not lose <b>anything</b> <b>by</b> taking some young spinners instead, {{in order to gain}} experience.|$|E
25|$|After missing most of {{the tour}} of India due to injury, Ponting {{returned}} for the Fourth Test. By this time, Australia had taken an unassailable 2–0 series lead, his deputy Gilchrist leading the tourists to their first Test series win in India since 1969–70. Leading spinner Shane Warne injured himself {{on the eve of}} the match, which was played on a very dry pitch at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai. Off spinner Nathan Hauritz and leg spinner Cameron White, who were not regular wicket-takers in domestic cricket, were surprise selections ahead of Stuart MacGill for the tour. The reasoning given by the selectors was that as they intended to play only one spinner—Warne—MacGill was unlikely to play so they would not lose <b>anything</b> <b>by</b> taking some young spinners instead, in order to gain experience. However, it was too late for MacGill to be flown in, and Hauritz played and took 5/103. Ponting made 11 and 12 and Australia lost a low-scoring match in less than two days' equivalent playing time. Ponting was very vocal in criticising the playing surface after the match.|$|E

25|$|These {{maneuvers}} did {{not pass}} unnoticed, as Villeroi let his intentions be known {{with the goal of}} worrying the allied armies besieging Namur. On August 3, a truce was declared in the siege in order to treat the wounded and restock the citadel. After six days, the siege resumed, with both William III and Maximilian II Emanuel standing their ground. Only the small army of the Prince of Vaudemont, near the city of Ghent, was able to achieve <b>anything,</b> <b>by</b> controlling roads leading to Brussels. Having only 15,000 men, however, he was forced to withdraw faced with Villeroi's much larger force. The French army arrived in the vicinity of Brussels on August 11, and installed themselves on the high ground {{to the west of the}} city. Brussels was not strongly defended, as its walls offered no defense, despite improvements made by the Spanish in the previous century. Two entrenchments in front of Flanders Gate and Anderlecht Gate were easily taken by the French, who then installed their artillery nearby.|$|E

500|$|German Gothic art {{underwent}} a revival {{in the early}} 19th century Romantic period, when the work {{was seen as a}} climax of the late Gothic period.

Later, Goethe was enthusiastic, emphasising Lochner's German [...] "spirit and origin"; he described the Dombild as the [...] "axis around which the ancient Netherlandish art resolves into the new".|$|E

When Carey flew west to work with Narada Michael Walden on some tracks for her first album, Tommy Mottola and Don Ienner were impressed with Afanasieff's work and gave him an executive staff producer job with the label.

I said, 'What do you want me to do?' and he said, 'You only have a couple of days, but are you ready to cut it?' I couldn't believe the opportunity that it was.

500|$|In 2012, {{art critic}} Camille Paglia praised {{the film in}} Glittering Images, {{comparing}} some of its scenes to works by modern painters and calling it [...] "the greatest work of art in recent memory". Paglia explained that the film's finale, [...] "has more inherent artistic value, emotional power, and global impact than <b>anything</b> <b>by</b> the artists you name. It's because the art world has flat-lined and become an echo chamber of received opinion and toxic over-praise. It's like the emperor's new clothes -- people are too intimidated to admit what they secretly think or what they might think with their blinders off. Episode III epitomizes the modern digital art movement, more so than other piece from the last 30 years. I had considered using Japanese anime for the digital art chapter of the book, but it lacked the overwhelming operatic power and yes, seriousness of Lucas's Revenge of the Sith." ...|$|E
500|$|Before {{the last}} game of the World Series had been played, rumors spread that Detroit (which had amassed an all-star lineup with a {{commensurate}} payroll) was in negotiations to unload Dunlap's high salary by selling him to Pittsburgh.

He said at the time, [...] "I am sick and tired of being sold without gaining <b>anything</b> <b>by</b> it, and it is about time that my bank account was benefited by these transfers." [...] He told a reporter for The New York Times that he was not penniless and would refuse to play unless his demands were met. He told the reporter that the Detroit club had three choices -- [...] "give me half of the money secured for my release, allow me to go where I please, or fulfill the contract made with me last year." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{relationship}} between Carl {{and his wife}} Ellie has been praised in several media outlets. In his book Disney, Pixar, and the Hidden Message of Children's Films, author M. Keith Booker described the love between Carl and Ellie as touching. While also describing {{the scene of the}} two of them aging as a [...] "masterpiece of its own kind," [...] he was not sure how much children would appreciate the scene, commenting that his son was squirming in his seat during the scene. Reelviews editor James Berardinelli praised their relationship, stating that it brought a tear to his eye in a way no animated film has done, including <b>anything</b> <b>by</b> famed anime director Hayao Miyazaki. Ann Hornaday praised the prologue, describing it as [...] "worthy of Chaplin in its heartbreaking poignancy." [...] Chicago Tribune editor Michael Phillips praised the scene, describing it as an emotional and cinematic powerhouse, and that he also was nearly moved to tears. However, Salon.com editor Stephanie Zacharek criticized the love between Carl and Ellie, describing their marriage as resembling a dental adhesive commercial more than a real relationship.|$|E
500|$|In 2008 Trygve Nordwall, {{the manager}} of the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, invoked new EU rules forbidding more than 85 {{decibels}} in the workplace, as a reason for dropping the planned world premiere of Dror Feiler's composition Halat Hisar (State of Siege) because it was [...] "adverse to the health" [...] of the musicians. The twenty-minute composition [...] "starts with the rattle of machine-gun fire and gets louder" [...] ("Das Stück beginnt mit Schüssen aus Maschinengewehren, die vom Band zugespielt werden, und das ist noch die leiseste Stelle.") Orchestra manager Trygve Nordwall reported that [...] "readings were taken during rehearsals and even when toned down, Halat Hisar measured about 130 decibels, equivalent to hearing a jet aircraft taking off", and one member of the orchestra reported suffering headaches and permanent tinnitis after sustained exposure for three hours during rehearsals ("Ein Orchestermusiker habe nach der Probe des Stückes drei Stunden lang permanente Ohrgeräusche (Tinnitus) gehabt"). Headphones for the musicians were suggested, but they objected they could not hear each other and the composer also rejected the idea, adding that his composition was [...] "no louder than <b>anything</b> <b>by</b> Shostakovich or Wagner".|$|E
500|$|In retrospect, Christgau {{attributed}} the album's success to Saadiq's {{lead role in}} Tony! Toni! Toné! He contended that [...] "only with House of Music did they become true sons of the soul revival, the most accomplished r act of the '90s. That's still the album to remember them by." [...] AllMusic editor Leo Stanley later remarked that the group [...] "successfully accomplish their fusion of the traditional and contemporary... {{within the framework of}} memorable, catchy songs" [...] indebted to both old and modern R songwriting virtues. According to Stanley, the record had an influence on contemporary neo soul artists such as Tony Rich and Maxwell. In Matos' opinion, the album showcased the increasing artistic contrast between Saadiq and Wiggins, which [...] "had grown so pronounced that the tension only enhanced what was already the group's best batch of songs". Rashod Ollison of The Virginian-Pilot regarded the record as [...] "a flawless gem" [...] on which the band's [...] "amalgamation of traditional and contemporary styles coalesced beautifully". In The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), Fred Schruers said [...] "House of Music consolidates the triumph of Sons of Soul for a masterpiece of 1990s R, an album that is as steeped in soul tradition as <b>anything</b> <b>by</b> Maxwell or D'Angelo, but that mixes the homage with humor and deft contemporary touches, thereby creating a new space all its own".|$|E

500|$|Temperley writes: [...] "After 1855 [...] was {{spurred by}} belated honours, and {{occasional}} commissions, {{to compose a}} respectable number of significant and substantial works, though {{it was too late}} to recapture his early self-confidence." [...] Works from his later years included the cello Sonata Duo for Piatti; a pastoral cantata, The May Queen, Op. 39, for the opening of the Leeds Town Hall in 1858; an Ode (Op. 40) with words by Alfred, Lord Tennyson for the opening of the 1862 International Exhibition in London; an Installation Ode for Cambridge University (Op. 41) with words by Charles Kingsley, which included a lament for the late Prince Albert; a symphony in G minor (Op. 43); a sacred cantata,The Woman of Samaria for the Birmingham Triennial Music Festival of 1867; and finally a second Piano Sonata (The Maid of Orleans, Op. 46). Many of these works were composed during his summer holidays which were spent at Eastbourne. The Ode for the Exhibition was the cause of a further imbroglio with Costa, who although in charge of music for the Exhibition refused to conduct <b>anything</b> <b>by</b> Bennett. Eventually it was conducted by Prosper Sainton, between works by Meyerbeer and Daniel Auber also commissioned for the occasion. The affair leaked into the press, and Costa was widely condemned for his behaviour.|$|E
500|$|In June of the 1907 season, Lajoie's [...]296 average, [...] "an average {{even now}} that scores of players {{would be glad}} to accept," [...] put him at risk for hitting below [...]300 {{for the first time in}} his career. He also missed 15 games due to a {{recurrence}} of sepsis which he contracted during the 1905 season. Lajoie and Naps first baseman George Stovall got into an argument in a hotel lobby and Stovall broke a chair over Lajoie's head. [...] "George didn't mean <b>anything</b> <b>by</b> it", Lajoie said, and the two maintained a working relationship. He finished the season with an average of [...]299. Naps owner Charles Somers received a trade offer from the Detroit Tigers for the Naps' Elmer Flick and Tigers' Ty Cobb. Tigers manager Hughie Jennings called Somers and told him he was offering the trade because Cobb was not getting along with several teammates. Somers decided to retain Flick, saying, [...] "We'll keep Flick. Maybe he isn't as good a batter as Cobb, but he's much nicer to have on the team." [...] The Naps finished the regular season in second place to the Tigers with a 9064 record, a half-game behind the Tigers (who finished 9063 and were not forced to make-up a rained out game in accordance with league rules). Lajoie was partly blamed for the Naps' second-place finish. Author Fred McMane described an instance during the season between Naps catcher Nig Clarke and Lajoie.|$|E
500|$|In a {{retrospective}} review for AllMusic, Erlewine—the website's senior editor—claimed that New York Dolls {{was a more}} quintessential proto-punk album {{than any of the}} Stooges' releases because of how it [...] "plunders history while celebrating it, creating a sleazy urban mythology along the way". David Fricke argued that it was a more definitive glam rock album than David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust (1972) or <b>anything</b> <b>by</b> Marc Bolan because of how the band [...] "captured both the glory and sorrow of glam, the high jinx and wasted youth, with electric photorealism". In The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), Joe Gross called it an [...] "absolutely essential" [...] record and [...] "epic sleaze, the sound of five young men shaping the big city in their own scuzzy image". Sylvain attributed its influence on punk rock to how Rundgren recorded his guitar through the left speaker and Thunders' guitar on the right side, an orientation which he said younger bands such as the Ramones and the Sex Pistols adopted. Rundgren was amused by how the record became considered a precursor to the punk movement: [...] "The irony is that I wound up producing the seminal punk album, but I was never really thought of as a punk producer, and I never got called by punk acts. They probably thought I was too expensive for what they were going for. But the Dolls didn't really consider themselves punk." ...|$|E
