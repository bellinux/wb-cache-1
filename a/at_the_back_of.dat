5|$|Jaw joint - The dentary (the {{lower jaw}} bone, which carries the teeth) and the squamosal (a small cranial bone) meet {{to form the}} joint. In most gnathostomes, {{including}} early therapsids, the joint consists of the articular (a small bone <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the lower jaw) and quadrate (a small bone <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the upper jaw).|$|E
5|$|The {{mandible}} (lower jaw) is {{long and}} low. The coronoid process, the frontmost of the three main processes (projections) <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the jawbone, is large and about {{as high as the}} condyloid process behind it. The angular process, below the condyloid, is fairly short and does not extend further backwards than the condyloid. There is no noticeable capsular process (a raising <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the jaw that houses the root of the lower incisor).|$|E

5|$|In {{one of the}} {{earliest}} phylogenetic analyses of the group, Gardiner (1983) recognized five characteristics that made Temnospondyli a clade: a bone <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the skull, the parasphenoid, is connected to another bone {{on the underside of the}} skull, the pterygoid; large openings called interpterygoid vacuities are present between the pterygoids; the stapes (a bone involved in hearing) is connected to the parasphenoid and projects upward; the cleithrum, a bone in the pectoral girdle, is thin; and part of the vertebra called the interdorsal attaches to the neural arch. Additional features were given by Godfrey et al. (1987), including the contact between the postparietal and exoccipital <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the skull, small projections (uncinate processes) on the ribs, and a pelvic girdle with each side having a single iliac blade. These shared characteristics are called synapomorphies.|$|E

5|$|M3 is a small, {{triangular}} tooth. There {{is large}} basin in the middle, and a mesoloph is present. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the tooth, {{there is a}} distinct posteroloph. In A.donovani, there are two roots at the front (labial and lingual) and one at the back. There are no M3 of A.praeuniversitatis with preserved roots.|$|E
5|$|Magpies {{prefer to}} swoop <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the head; therefore, keeping the magpie in sight {{at all times}} can {{discourage}} the bird.

Eyes painted on hats or helmets will deter attacks on pedestrians but not cyclists.|$|E

5|$|The {{cerebrum}} {{contains the}} ventricles where the cerebrospinal fluid is produced and circulated. Below the corpus callosum is the septum pellucidum, a membrane {{that separates the}} lateral ventricles. Beneath the lateral ventricles is the thalamus and {{to the front and}} below this is the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus leads on to the pituitary gland. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the thalamus is the brainstem.|$|E
5|$|The huge, vaulted lid of N. rajah, {{the largest}} in the genus, is another {{distinguishing}} characteristic of this species.

5|$|The {{mandible}} (lower jaw) looks chunky {{and has a}} long condyloid {{process at}} its back; that of T.talamancae is more slender. The capsular process, a projection <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the jaw which houses {{the root of the}} lower incisor, is poorly developed.|$|E

5|$|The root of {{the lower}} incisor is visible <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the {{mandible}} (lower jaw) as a slight protrusion; a true capsular process is absent. There are 13 thoracic (chest), 7 lumbar, 4 sacral, and 38 or 39 caudal (tail) vertebrae. The humerus (upper arm bone) lacks an entepicondylar foramen.|$|E
5|$|The skull looks delicate. The interorbital region (between the eyes) is {{narrow and}} hourglass-shaped, and the braincase is smooth; both lack conspicuously {{developed}} ridges and shelves. The zygomatic arches (cheekbones) are poorly developed. The incisive foramina (openings {{in the front}} part of the palate) are short and narrow. The bony palate ends {{at the level of}} the back of the third upper molars. The alisphenoid strut (a piece of bone <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the skull separating two foramina, or openings) is absent. The strut is present in most Eliurus, but absent in some specimens of E.grandidieri. The subsquamosal fenestrae (openings in the squamosal bone) are fairly large. The auditory bullae are small. The incisors are weak and the enamel on the upper incisors is yellow to light orange. The root of the lower incisor does not project into a distinct capsular process <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the mandible (lower jaw), a feature shared only with E.grandidieri among species of Eliurus.|$|E
