25|$|One {{approximate}} {{approach that}} is particularly well suited to computers is the Monte Carlo method, which examines {{just a few of}} the possible states of the system, with the states chosen randomly (with a fair weight). As long as these states form <b>a</b> <b>representative</b> <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> the whole set of states of the system, the approximate characteristic function is obtained. As more and more random samples are included, the errors are reduced to an arbitrarily low level.|$|E
25|$|Research {{conducted}} by the Kenexa Research Institute (KRI) evaluated how male and female workers perceive work–life balance and found {{that women are more}} positive than men in how they perceive their company’s efforts to help them balance work and life responsibilities. The report is based on the analysis of data drawn from <b>a</b> <b>representative</b> <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> 10,000 U.S. workers who were surveyed through WorkTrends, KRI’s annual survey of worker opinions. The results indicated a shift in women’s perceptions about work–life balance. In the past, women often found it more difficult to maintain balance due to the competing pressures at work and demands at home.|$|E

The students were asked if and how often they had experienced 14 types of behaviors which constitute sexual harassment. They then indicated who harassed them (students, teachers, school employees). Nonphysical sexual abuse (e.g., making sexual jokes) was more prevalent than physical abuse (8.7 and 6.7%). Girls {{were more likely to report}} educator sexual harassment than boys (10.3 and 8.8%). 12.3% of black, 12.2% of Latino, 8.4% of white and 1,8 % of Asian students indicated that they had experienced sexual harassment by teachers.|$|E
25|$|Inventory flows can {{number in}} the {{hundreds}} depending on the system boundary. For product LCAs at either the generic (i.e., representative industry averages) or brand-specific level, that data is typically collected through survey questionnaires.

The questionnaires cover the full range of inputs and outputs, typically aiming to account for 99% of the mass of a product, 99% of the energy used in its production and any environmentally sensitive flows, even if they fall within the 1% level of inputs.|$|E
25|$|Most ETFs are {{index funds}} {{that attempt to}} {{replicate}} {{the performance of a}} specific index. Indexes may be based on stocks, bonds, commodities, or currencies. An index fund seeks to track the performance of an index by holding in its portfolio either the contents of the index or <b>a</b> <b>representative</b> <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> the securities in the index. As of June 2012, in the United States, about 1200 index ETFs exist, with about 50 actively managed ETFs. Index ETF assets are about $1.2 trillion, compared with about $7 billion for actively managed ETFs. Some index ETFs, known as leveraged ETFs or inverse ETFs, use investments in derivatives to seek a return that corresponds to a multiple of, or the inverse (opposite) of, the daily performance of the index.|$|E

25|$|The affinities of the Pronophilina {{to other}} species {{groups within the}} specious Satyrinae suggest {{different}} interpretations about its origin. Viloria reviewed morphological characters and separated three groups that might have different phylogenetic and biogeographic affinities: a major group of 39 true Neotropical Pronophilina, including the genus Calisto with a Caribbean distribution, eight genera related to the Holarctic Erebiina, and 19 genera which he placed as Neotropical representatives of the otherwise Australasian Hypocystina. This grouping would suggest an amphi-Pacific distribution of the Hypocystina, and imply a Gondwanan origin according to a panbiogegraphic interpretations. This hypothesis was rebutted after a large phylogenetic analysis of the Satyrinae recovered <b>a</b> <b>representative</b> <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> pronophiline genera as a monophyletic group, and suggested a completely Neotropical, or at least, a common origin for the group. However, the relationships of the group remain unresolved, as subsequent work has found {{that at least two}} genera – Eretris, and the Caribbean Calisto—might be closer related to Holarctic Satyrines, but larger taxonomic sampling and a better integration of molecular and morphological data is needed to rule out analytical artifacts.|$|E

500|$|The Hugo Award {{is highly}} {{regarded}} by observers. The Los Angeles Times has termed it [...] "among the highest honors bestowed in science fiction and fantasy writing", a claim echoed by Wired, {{who said that}} it was [...] "the premier award in the science fiction genre". Justine Larbalestier, in The Battle of the Sexes in Science Fiction (2002), referred to the awards as [...] "the best known and most prestigious of the science fiction awards", and Jo Walton, writing for Tor.com, said it was [...] "undoubtedly science fiction's premier award". The Guardian similarly acknowledged it as [...] "a fine showcase for speculative fiction" [...] as well as [...] "one of the most venerable, democratic and international" [...] science fiction awards [...] "in existence". James Gunn, in The New Encyclopedia of Science Fiction (1988), echoed The Guardians statement of the award's democratic nature, saying that [...] "because of its broad electorate" [...] the Hugos were the awards most representative of [...] "reader popularity". Camille Bacon-Smith, in Science Fiction Culture (2000), said that at the time fewer than 1000 people voted on the final ballot; she held, however, that this is <b>a</b> <b>representative</b> <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> the readership at large, given the number of winning novels that remain in print for decades or become notable outside of the science fiction genre, such as The Demolished Man or The Left Hand of Darkness.
