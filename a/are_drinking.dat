5|$|It {{is morning}} at the Sheriff's Station. Agent Cooper, Chief Gordon Cole, Sheriff Harry S.Truman (Michael Ontkean), Deputy Andy Brennan (Harry Goaz), Deputy Hawk (Michael Horse), and Phillip Gerard (Al Strobel) <b>are</b> <b>drinking</b> coffee in the lobby. Truman informs that {{preparations}} have been made for them at The Great Northern. Gerard, currently possessed by MIKE, mutters his description of Bob's current location. Truman tells Hawk to search Harold Smith's apartment. Cooper tells Hawk to search for Laura Palmer's secret diary. Cole bids all farewell and leaves for Bend, Oregon.|$|E
5|$|Valhalla {{is first}} {{mentioned}} in chapter 2 of the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning, {{where it is}} described partially in euhemerized form. In the chapter, King Gylfi sets out to Asgard {{in the guise of}} an old man going by the name of Gangleri to find the source {{of the power of the}} gods. The narrative states that the Æsir foresaw his arrival and had prepared grand illusions for him, so that when Gangerli enters the fortress, he sees a hall of such a height that he has trouble seeing over it, and notices that the roof of the hall is covered in golden shields, as if they were shingles. Snorri then quotes a stanza by the skald Þjóðólfr of Hvinir (c. 900). As he continues, Gangleri sees a man in the doorway of the hall juggling short swords, and keeping seven in the air at once. Among other things, the man says that the hall belongs to his king, and adds that he can take Gangleri to the king. Gangleri follows him, and the door closes behind him. All around him he sees many living areas, and throngs of people, some of which are playing games, some <b>are</b> <b>drinking,</b> and others are fighting with weapons. Gangleri sees three thrones, and three figures sitting upon them: High sitting on the lowest throne, Just-As-High sitting on the next highest throne, and Third sitting on the highest. The man guiding Gangleri tells him that High is the king of the hall.|$|E

5000|$|Suppose {{everyone}} <b>is</b> <b>drinking.</b> For {{any particular}} person, it cannot {{be wrong to}} say that if that particular person <b>is</b> <b>drinking,</b> then everyone in the pub <b>is</b> <b>drinking</b> — because everyone <b>is</b> <b>drinking.</b> Because everyone <b>is</b> <b>drinking,</b> then that one person must drink because when that person drinks everybody drinks, everybody includes that person.|$|R

5000|$|So as it {{was applied}} here, the {{statement}} [...] "if he <b>is</b> <b>drinking,</b> everyone <b>is</b> drinking" [...] was taken to be correct in one case, if everyone <b>was</b> <b>drinking,</b> {{and in the other}} case, if he <b>was</b> not <b>drinking</b> — even though his drinking may not have {{had anything to do with}} anyone else's drinking.|$|R
25|$|Some Canadians <b>are</b> <b>drinking</b> {{water that}} {{contains}} inorganic arsenic. Private-dug–well waters are {{most at risk}} for containing inorganic arsenic. Preliminary well water analysis typically does not test for arsenic. Researchers at the Geological Survey of Canada have modeled relative variation in natural arsenic hazard potential for the province of New Brunswick. This study {{has important implications for}} potable water and health concerns relating to inorganic arsenic.|$|E
25|$|Master of Wine Clive Coates {{describes}} the Chardonnay of Corton-Charlemagne as being slower to mature than Montrachet with well-made examples from favorable vintages needing at least 10 years of aging before they <b>are</b> <b>drinking</b> at their peak. Coates {{note that the}} wines from the Pernand-Vergelesses side {{tend to have a}} flinty note and be characterized by more austerity than those from the Aloxe-Corton side that can be slightly more firm and full-bodied.|$|E
25|$|Season five {{starts out}} with the viewers finding out that Dixon is not dead, and the gang must {{come to terms with}} Dixon's new disability. Vanessa comes back into Liam's life asking for a second chance, but Liam refuses. Navid and Liam <b>are</b> <b>drinking</b> at the beach after finding out Silver asked Teddy to be the father of her baby. Angry about Silver, Liam accidentally starts a fire in his bar and walks away from it. Obsessed Vanessa appears again and blackmails Liam into being in a {{relationship}} with her.|$|E
50|$|Drug use, {{especially}} alcohol, {{is frequently}} involved in rape. A study (only of rape victims that were female and reachable by phone) reported detailed findings related to tactics. In 47% of such rapes, both {{the victim and}} the perpetrator had <b>been</b> <b>drinking.</b> In 17%, only the perpetrator had been. 7% of the time, only the victim had <b>been</b> <b>drinking.</b> Rapes where neither the victim nor the perpetrator had <b>been</b> <b>drinking</b> <b>were</b> 29% of all rapes.|$|R

50|$|Alcohol {{expectations}} {{can operate}} {{in the absence of}} actual consumption of alcohol. Research in the United States over a period of decades has shown that men tend to become more sexually aroused when they think they have <b>been</b> <b>drinking</b> alcohol, — even when they have not <b>been</b> <b>drinking</b> it. Women report feeling more sexually aroused when they falsely believe the beverages they have <b>been</b> <b>drinking</b> contained alcohol (although one measure of their physiological arousal shows that they became less aroused).|$|R
25|$|More {{than half}} of U.S. stream and river miles {{continue}} to violate water quality standards. However, since {{the passage of the}} 1972 act, the levels of pollution in the United States have experienced a dramatic decrease. The law has resulted in much cleaner waterways than before the bill was passed. Agriculture, industry, communities and other sources continue to discharge waste into surface waters nationwide, and many of these waters <b>are</b> <b>drinking</b> water sources. It is argued in a 2008 paper that the Clean Water Act has made extremely positive contributions to the environment, but is in desperate need of reform to address the pollution problems that remain.|$|E
25|$|Two other {{important}} dialogues, the Symposium and the Phaedrus, {{are linked to}} the main storyline by characters. In the Apology (19b, c), Socrates says Aristophanes slandered him in a comic play, and blames him for causing his bad reputation, and ultimately, his death. In the Symposium, the two of them <b>are</b> <b>drinking</b> together with other friends. The character Phaedrus is linked to the main story line by character (Phaedrus is also a participant in the Symposium and the Protagoras) and by theme (the philosopher as divine emissary, etc.) The Protagoras is also strongly linked to the Symposium by characters: all of the formal speakers at the Symposium (with the exception of Aristophanes) are present at the home of Callias in that dialogue. Charmides and his guardian Critias are present for the discussion in the Protagoras. Examples of characters crossing between dialogues can be further multiplied. The Protagoras contains the largest gathering of Socratic associates.|$|E
500|$|Music by the Celtic punk band The Pogues is used {{throughout}} the series. The band's song [...] "The Body of an American," [...] which is always played at detectives' wakes at Kavanaugh's Bar, occurs in three episodes.

The song [...] "Transmetropolitan" [...] is heard in the opening sequence of the episode [...] "Duck and Cover" [...] during season two, where McNulty crashes his car while drunk.|$|E
5000|$|Otherwise {{at least}} one person <b>is</b> not <b>drinking.</b> For any nondrinking person, the {{statement}} if that particular person <b>is</b> <b>drinking,</b> then everyone in the pub <b>is</b> <b>drinking</b> <b>is</b> formally true: its antecedent ("that particular person is drinking") is false, therefore the statement is true {{due to the nature of}} material implication in formal logic, which states that [...] "If P, then Q" [...] is always true if P is false. (These kinds of statements are said to be vacuously true.) ...|$|R

500|$|Goodman has {{returned}} to his hometown, and the Archie characters, home from college, <b>are</b> <b>drinking,</b> partying, skirt-chasing hedonists. Jughead is a beatnik, {{and the others are}} leading glamorous lifestyles. [...] Archie Andrews parody Archer explains to a behind-the-times Goodman, [...] "You've been away too long. [...] Nowadays, the gang is interested mainly in hip-ness—awareness", rather than keeping up with how the football team is doing. [...] Archer shows Goodman to his place, which must be entered through a staircase built into an enormous statue of a female abdomen. [...] Archer leads Goodman to a Roman-style orgy and has him change into a toga. [...] The party is Archer's last, as he reveals he has signed a pact with the Devil, and the debt (Archer's soul) was due that night.|$|E
500|$|After Bart and Lisa's slumber party {{fighting}} {{drives him}} to distraction at home one night, Homer visits Moe's Tavern, where he finds Moe is struggling financially as fewer people <b>are</b> <b>drinking</b> in bars nowadays {{and he ran}} out of Duff Beer after neglecting to pay his distributor. Homer tells him about a drink recipe that he accidentally invented one night, called the [...] "Flaming Homer". He explains that after Patty and Selma made the Simpson family watch slides from their latest vacation, he was unable to find a beer. He decided to mix together drops of liquor from near-empty bottles and accidentally included a bottle of Krusty Brand non-narcotic cough syrup. When Patty dropped cigarette ash in the drink and set it on fire, Homer discovered that fire greatly enhanced the taste of the drink.|$|E
500|$|Falstaff and his {{servants}}, Bardolfo and Pistola, <b>are</b> <b>drinking</b> at the inn. Dr Caius {{bursts in}} and accuses Falstaff of burgling {{his house and}} Bardolfo of picking his pocket. He is ejected. Falstaff hands a letter to each of his servants for delivery to Alice Ford and Meg Page, two wealthy married women. In these two identical letters, Falstaff professes his love {{for each of the}} women, although it is access to their husbands' money that he chiefly covets. Bardolfo and Pistola refuse, claiming that honour prevents them from obeying him. Falstaff dispatches his page, Robin, to deliver the letters. Falstaff delivers a tirade at his rebellious followers (L'onore! Ladri... ! [...] / [...] "Honour! You rogues... !") telling them that honour is a mere word and is of no practical value. He chases them out of his sight.|$|E

500|$|Lenny pines for Faith and {{relies on}} his two best friends, {{bodyguard}} and limousine driver Lornette [...] "Mace" [...] Mason and private investigator Max Peltier, for emotional support. Mace has unrequited feelings for Lenny from the past, {{from when he}} was still a cop and stepped in as a dependable father figure for her son after her boyfriend was arrested on drug charges, but disapproves of his SQUID-dealing business. While Lenny and Max <b>are</b> <b>drinking</b> together at a bar, Iris drops a SQUID disc through the sunroof of Lenny's car, but his car is towed away before he sees it. He is then picked up by Mace, who eventually agrees to take him to a nightclub where Faith is going to sing. In the club, Lenny receives a SQUID disc from a contact and then tries to get Faith away from her new boyfriend, music industry mogul Philo Gant, but to no avail.|$|E
500|$|The {{title of}} the episode is a {{reference}} to the 1967 American film Cool Hand Luke. In the opening scene of the episode, while Peter, Joe, Cleveland and Quagmire <b>are</b> <b>drinking</b> at the local bar, Peter's wife, Lois, calls him on his phone. The theme song from The Cleveland Show then begins playing as Peter's ringtone. While the group drives to New Orleans, they attempt to pass the time by playing various games in the car. One of the games involves deciding whether to be a [...] "hobo," [...] or former German Nazi leader Adolf Hitler. After the group is pulled over by the sheriff, and arrested for drug possession, they are all taken to court, where the jury is revealed to be various characters from the Fox animation series The Simpsons. The warden of the prison resembles the warden in the movie The Shawshank Redemption, who is also authoritarian and cruel. In fact, the voice of the warden is the voice of Bob Gunton, the actor who portrayed the warden in The [...] "Shawshank Redemption". After the group escapes from jail, Peter remarks that he is filled with hunger, and would like to stop at a [...] "Burger Queen" [...] or [...] "McDaniels" [...] along the way back to Quahog, {{a reference to the}} American fast food restaurants Burger King and McDonald's, as indicated by Quagmire.|$|E

However, several minutes later, the same cloud of dust, accompanied by the clatter of hooves, rapidly proceeds in the other direction.
