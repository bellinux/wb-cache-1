5|$|In June 2007, {{a pair of}} Luftwaffe Tornado were {{controversially}} used to fly reconnaissance flights over an <b>anti-globalisation</b> demonstration {{during the}} 33rd G8 summit in Heiligendamm. Following the mission, the German Defence Ministry admitted one aircraft had broken the minimum flying altitude and that mistakes {{were made in the}} handling of security of the summit.|$|E
5|$|As Chief Minister, Modi favoured {{privatisation}} {{and small}} government, {{which was at}} odds with the philosophy of the RSS, usually described as anti-privatisation and <b>anti-globalisation.</b> His policies during his second term have been credited with reducing corruption in the state. He established financial and technology parks in Gujarat and during the 2007 Vibrant Gujarat summit, real-estate investment deals worth 6.6trillion were signed.|$|E
25|$|The {{international}} <b>anti-globalisation</b> movement, while {{difficult to}} define, {{has become a}} focus for other socialists in the 21st century, and many see a reflection {{of it in the}} opposition of large sections of the population to the 2003 Iraq War.|$|E
25|$|In {{the extreme}} left-wing scene, anti-Semitic remarks {{were to be}} found mainly {{in the context of}} pro-Palestinian and <b>anti-globalisation</b> rallies and in {{newspaper}} articles using anti-Semitic stereotypes in their criticism of Israel. Often this generated a combination of anti-Zionist and anti-American views that formed an important element in the emergence of an anti-Semitic mood in Europe.|$|E
25|$|Kovel {{believes}} in building prefigurations around forms of production based on use values, which {{will provide a}} practical vision of a post-capitalist, post-statist system. Such projects include Indymedia ("a democratic rendering of the use-values of new technologies such as the Internet, and a continual involvement in wider struggle"), open-source software, Wikipedia, public libraries and many other initiatives, especially those developed within the <b>anti-globalisation</b> movement.|$|E
25|$|In the 1990s and 2000s (decade), {{antisemitism}} resurged in Slovenia, mostly {{linked to}} <b>anti-globalisation</b> and far left movements. Since 1990, antisemitic discourses in Slovenia have been predominantly {{linked to the}} left of the political spectrum, while they have been mostly absent from the right wing rhetoric. The Slovenian National Party, which has been described by many as chauvinistic, has not been antisemitic. On the other hand, antisemitic remarks have been frequent among left wing activists and commentators, as well as among the extra-parliamentary far right groups.|$|E
25|$|The {{head of the}} International Institute of Strategic Studies – Asia, Tim Huxley, {{cites the}} diverse {{political}} systems present in the grouping, including many young states, {{as a barrier to}} far-reaching co-operation outside the economic sphere. He also asserts that, {{in the absence of an}} external threat to rally against with the end of the Cold War, ASEAN has begun to be less successful at restraining its members and resolving border disputes such as those between Burma and Thailand and Indonesia and Malaysia. During the 12th ASEAN Summit in Cebu, several activist groups staged <b>anti-globalisation</b> protests. According to the activists, the agenda of economic integration would negatively affect industries in the Philippines and would cause thousands of Filipinos to lose their jobs.|$|E
25|$|Danny (David Oyelowo) and Zoe (Keeley Hawes) observe an <b>anti-globalisation</b> rally before Bush's visit, where a riot ensues {{led by a}} man in {{a flaming}} helmet, who spots the two and flees with a young woman, Andrea Chambers. When they are {{surrounded}} by riot police, the man reveals himself as Peter Salter (Anthony Head), a legendary MI5 officer who recruited Tom. They contact Tom after they weren't briefed about the situation. Harry Pearce (Peter Firth) admits that Salter is working with Harry and Jools Siviter (Hugh Laurie) at MI6 in a joint operation to take down a European anarchist terror group led by Istvan Vogel. In order to get into the cell, Salter has been sleeping with Andrea. Upon meeting him, Tom questions Salter's allegiance after learning he is in love with Andrea; Tom reluctantly allows the operation to continue, but displays his concern to Harry.|$|E
25|$|In {{the years}} 2000s, Italian {{nationalism}} {{seems to have}} gained a moderate support by the society, in particular during important days such as the National Day Festa della Repubblica (Republic day) and the Anniversary of the Liberation. The President of the Republic Carlo Azeglio Ciampi has often praised patriotism among Italians by mentioning in his speeches national events including Risorgimento or Resistenza, and national symbols like the Flag of Italy and the National Anthem, although he {{seems to want to}} stress self-confidence rather than nationalism. In 2011, the 150th Anniversary of Italian Unification showed a moderately renewed interest in Italian nationalism among the society. Nationalist ideologies are often present during Italian <b>anti-globalisation</b> protests. Today, Italian nationalism is mainly supported by right-wing political parties including Brothers of Italy-National Alliance who has gained nine seats in the Italian Parliament in the last general election, and by far-right-wing political parties like The Right or Tricolour Flame. Nonetheless, in recent times Italian nationalism has been occasionally embraced as a form of banal nationalism by liberal parties like Forza Italia, centrist parties like the Union of the Centre or even by centre-left parties like the Democratic Party.|$|E
500|$|In 1983 and 1984, Crass {{were part}} of the Stop the City actions co-ordinated by London Greenpeace which foreshadowed the <b>anti-globalisation</b> rallies of the early 21st century. Support for these {{activities}} was provided in the lyrics and sleeve notes of the band's last single, [...] "You're Already Dead", expressing doubts about their commitment to non-violence. It was also a reflection of disagreements within the group, as explained by Rimbaud; [...] "Half the band supported the pacifist line and half supported direct and if necessary violent action. It was a confusing time for us, and I think a lot of our records show that, inadvertently". This led to introspection within the band, with some members becoming embittered and losing sight of their essentially positive stance. Reflecting this debate, the next release under the Crass name was Acts of Love: classical-music settings of 50 poems by Penny Rimbaud, described as [...] "songs to my other self" [...] and intended to celebrate [...] "the profound sense of unity, peace and love that exists within that other self".|$|E
500|$|In October 2000 Radiohead {{released}} {{their fourth}} album, Kid A, {{the first of}} two albums from these recording sessions. A departure from OK Computer, Kid A featured a minimalist and textured style with more diverse instrumentation, including the ondes Martenot, programmed electronic beats, strings, and jazz horns. It debuted at number one in many countries, including the US, where its debut atop the Billboard chart marked a first for the band, and the first US number one album by any UK act since the Spice Girls in 1996. This success was attributed variously to marketing, to the album's leak on the file-sharing network Napster a few months before its release, and to advance anticipation based, in part, on the success of OK Computer. Although Radiohead did not release any singles from Kid A, promos of [...] "Optimistic" [...] and [...] "Idioteque" [...] received radio play, and a series of [...] "blips", or short videos set to portions of tracks, were played on music channels and released freely on the internet. The band had read Naomi Klein's <b>anti-globalisation</b> book No Logo during the recording, and decided to continue a summer 2000 tour of Europe later in the year in a custom-built tent free of advertising; they also promoted Kid A with three sold-out North American theatre concerts.|$|E
500|$|The first Indian KFC was a two-storey outlet on {{the fashionable}} Brigade Road in Bangalore in June 1995. According to {{journalist}} Michael White, {{the company could}} not have chosen a [...] "more difficult venue for its maiden entrée into the country". Bangalore housed {{the headquarters of the}} Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha, one of the most influential, vocal and anti-foreign investment farmers' associations in the country. The first outlet suffered protests from left wing, <b>anti-globalisation</b> and environmental campaigners, as well as local farmers, who objected to the chain bypassing local producers. Many Indians were concerned about the onslaught of consumerism, the loss of national self-sufficiency, and the disruption of indigenous traditions. The protests came to a head in August 1995, when the Bangalore outlet was repeatedly ransacked. The KFC outlet in Bangalore demanded, and received, a police van permanently parked outside for a year. The outlet was closed on September 13, 1995 by local authorities, who claimed the company used illegally high amounts of monosodium glutamate (MSG) in its food. The outlet re-opened a few hours later as the result of an appeal by KFC to the Karnataka High Court. The company stated the recipe was no different than that used in any other KFC store. Rural activist M. D. Nanjundaswamy claimed KFC would adversely affect the health of the impoverished, by diverting grain from poor people to make the more profitable animal feed. Environmentalist Maneka Gandhi joined the anti-KFC movement. A second outlet opened in Delhi, but was closed by the authorities throughout November, purportedly for health reasons, but more likely to avoid a repetition of the Bangalore incident. The Delhi outlet soon closed permanently.|$|E
2500|$|Joan Smith, {{writing for}} The Observer, faulted the novel's uneven {{construction}} {{and lack of}} emotional depth. She concluded: [...] "In the end, Oryx and Crake is a parable, an imaginative text for the <b>anti-globalisation</b> movement that does not quite work as a novel." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Che {{image has}} been cited {{as an example of}} the merging of {{politics}} and marketing and the power that images hold over our society. Trisha Ziff, the curator of a 2004 touring exhibition on the iconography of Che has stated that [...] "Che Guevara has become a brand. And the brand's logo is the image, which represents change. It has become the icon of the outside thinker, at whatever level, whether it is anti-war, pro-green or <b>anti-globalisation.</b> Its presence, everywhere from Belfast to Soweto, or from walls in the Palestinian territories to Parisian boutiques, makes it an image that is out of control. It has become a corporation, an empire, at this point." ...|$|E
2500|$|Chao's lyrics provoke his {{audience}} {{to think about}} immigration, love, living in ghettos, drugs, and often carry a left-wing message. This reflects Chao's own political leanings—he {{is very close to}} the Zapatistas and their public spokesman, Subcomandante Marcos. [...] He has many followers among the European left, the Latin American left and the <b>anti-globalisation</b> and anti-free trade movements. Chao is a founding member of ATTAC. Punk and reggae historian Vivien Goldman commented of his work, [...] "I was writing about Good Charlotte and The Police. They adopted the trappings of punk. They aren’t bad groups, but the punk aspect is more manifested by somebody like Manu Chao. He's one of the punkiest artists out there I can think of. It's an inclusionary spirit that is punk." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{episode was}} filmed before the third episode, [...] "One Last Dance". The {{first day of}} filming {{involved}} the scenes between Head and Brownen Davies (Andrea), which was filmed in an art house. Due to timing constraints, part of the sequence had to be cut down. A few of the scenes where Tom reveals to Ellie were filmed with a hand-held camera; {{this is the first}} time such a technique was used in Spooks. The <b>anti-globalisation</b> riots in the teaser of the episode were originally going to be staged, but due to budget constraints most of the riot was edited from several pieces of real-life news footage - although part of the riot, particularly involving Salter, was staged. The scene was filmed by two separate units. The building Danny and Zoe used to observe overlooked the filmed riot.|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} senior members, {{including}} Griffin and John Bean, had anti-capitalist leanings, having {{been influenced by}} Strasserism and National Bolshevism. Under Griffin's leadership, the BNP promoted economic protectionism and <b>anti-globalisation.</b> Its economic policies reflect a vague commitment to distributist economics, ethno-socialism, and national autarky. The BNP maintains a policy of protectionism and economic nationalism, although in comparison with other far-right nationalist parties, the BNP focuses less on corporatism. It has called for British ownership of its own industries and resources and the [...] "subordination {{of the power of}} the City to the power of the government". It has promoted the regeneration of farming in the United Kingdom, with the object of achieving maximum self-sufficiency in food production. [...] In 2002, the party criticised corporatism as a [...] "mixture of big capitalism and state control", saying it favoured a [...] "distributionist tradition established by home-grown thinkers" [...] favouring small business.|$|E
