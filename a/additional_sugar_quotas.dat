50|$|Further {{expansion}} of the sugar industry faced serious deeprooted obstacles. For example, the production cost of Haitian sugar was three {{times more than the}} world price in the 1980s. Shifts in the world sugar market, caused mainly by the international substitution of corn-based fructose for sugarcane, exerted further pressure on Haitian producers. One result of this situation was the practice of importing sugar, which was then reexported to the United States under the Haitian <b>sugar</b> <b>quota.</b> Reductions in Haiti's quota during the 1980s, however, limited exchanges of this sort.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{trade talks}} in the WTO {{indicate}} that the powerful US sugar lobby {{continues to be a}} roadblock to agricultural liberalization. It calls attention to a need for better understanding of the complex quota-based regulations that have governed the US sugar trade for so long. In 1934 the United States shifted its sugar protection policy from emphasizing the tariff to a comprehensive system of quotas. It was revised in 1937. After its suspension for much of World War II, a new Sugar Act was passed in 1948, and further revised in 1951 and 1956. It has been in almost continuous operation since 1934. This paper examines the origins and development of the Sugar Program from 1934 to 1959. Why did the United States adopt <b>sugar</b> <b>quotas?</b> What were the rules set up to implement and govern the policy? How did they function? The <b>sugar</b> <b>quota</b> was adopted after the U. S. government determined that the long-standing policy using the tariff to protect the domestic industry was failing. A principal reason was that the tariff was not raising the price of sugar because, by diminishing the imports of Cuban sugar, it was causing severe decline in wages and costs on that island. In turn, Cuban sugar was being offered at ever lower prices. The quota program was conceived of as a way t...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The advertised EC {{policy toward}} sugar is clearly to let market drive supply and demand. But there exist reasons {{to think that}} the setting up of the {{traditional}} quota policy was not a consequence of chance, or of an efficient lobbying system by farmers, but of practical necessity and of efficiency, in face of market failures. In view of this reasoning, it is not impossible that a large crisis in the more or less remote future leads to reinstall a <b>sugar</b> <b>quota</b> system which probably should had to be reformed, but should never have been suppressed...|$|R

40|$|As {{part of the}} 2006 {{reform of}} the European Union (EU) <b>sugar</b> regime, {{national}} <b>quotas</b> on the supply of sugar for domestic human consumption (for which beet producers receive a supported price) were renewed only up to 2014 / 15. It is {{the intention of the}} European Commission that they should not be renewed beyond that date, although this position is currently coming under renewed discussion. Three recent studies (LEI, 2010; European Commission, 2011 a; Nolte et al., 2012) have examined the effects of <b>sugar</b> <b>quota</b> abolition on the EU market and its trade position. These studies suggest that the net importer status of the EU would be maintained, although net imports decrease. However, there exist no studies investigating changes in bilateral trade flows between EU and third countries. This paper analyses the impacts of <b>quota</b> <b>sugar</b> cessation on the bilateral trade flows between the EU and third countries in 2020 against a reference scenario in which quotas remain in force. The study uses the partial equilibrium model CAPRI, which covers 77 countries grouped into 40 trade blocks. It models bilateral trade flows and bilateral trade measures between the various trade blocks. The results show that, with the expiry of EU <b>sugar</b> <b>quotas,</b> total EU <b>sugar</b> imports would be 43 % lower in 2020, while total EU sugar exports would decline by 16 %. Sugar imports from high-cost third countries decline very substantially, but those from the low-cost producer Brazil decrease only slightly. However, Brazil suffers loss of market share in third countries, notably in Africa, due to trade diversion. The net result is that, despite its strong comparative advantage in the production and marketing of sugar, Brazil suffers a welfare loss of EUR 40 million, whereas most other non-EU sugar-producing countries experience negligible welfare effects or small welfare gains. The largest welfare gain occurs in the EU (+EUR 845 million). JRC. J. 4 -Agriculture and Life Sciences in the Econom...|$|R

According to the Commission 'the reduction is necessary to bring the EU in conformity with their WTO obligations'. The regulation also cuts EU refiners' 'maximum supply needs'.

Comment: As can be seen there is rarely a correlation between the quotas allocated under the sugar regime and actual production. EU quota cuts will not necessarily have any impact on EU production. However, the reduction of the maximum supply needs will definitely result in lost export markets and lost revenues for ACP exporters.

All other EU policy measures pertaining to the sugar sector, and to agriculture more generally, are assumed the same in both scenarios. The year of comparison is 2020. The CAPRI model {{was used for the}} simulations. The report begins with a description of beet and sugar production within the EU, and outlines the policies applied in the sugar sector within the EU’s Common Agricultural policy. This is followed by a description of the workings of the EU market for sugar. A theoretical model is used to summarise the main functional relationships in the EU sugar market and related markets, and the EU’s trade in sugar, from which a number of theory-based predictions about the impacts of quota expiry are derived. There is then a very brief overview of the CAPRI model and the way it has been used in this study. Isoglucose quotas will expire along with <b>sugar</b> <b>quotas,</b> and there is much speculation about the extent of potential competitive substitution between the two sweeteners, which has until now been neutralised by the quota arrangements. Sensitivity analysis was performed to obtain greater insight into this issue. Two additional quota-expiry scenarios were run, in which isoglucose was assumed to take a 10 % and a 20 % share of the sweetener market at the expense of sugar. The main findings are: •	production of sugar beet and white sugar increases by around 4 %,. •	there is little net impact on the production of cereals, •	total ethanol production hardly changes, but the importance of sugar as an ethanol feedstock declines by a few percentage points, •	raw sugar imports from high-cost third countries decline very substantially, but those from the low-cost producer Brazil decrease only slightly, •	EU sugar exports fall, •	EU human consumption of sugar increases only marginally, despite a fall of 15 - 16 % in beet prices for sugar for internal human consumption, •	there is a very small positive welfare change, although income accruing to sugar beet producers falls by over 17 %,JRC.
