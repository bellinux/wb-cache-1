40|$|AbstractLysis of avidin-coated {{biotinylated}} sheep {{red blood}} cells (RBC) via the classical pathway of homologous (sheep) and heterologous (guinea pig) complement has been studied. The minimal surface density of avidin inducing antibody-dependent lysis via the classical pathway is smaller than that inducing antibody-independent lysis via the alternative pathway. Heterologous lysis via the classical pathway {{does not depend on}} the mode of avidin attachment: both biotinylation of membrane amino groups and insertion of biotinyl-lipid into the membrane provide the same lysis of avidin-coated RBCs by guinea pig serum in the presence of anti-avidin antibody. Avidin-free sheep RBC sensitized with hemolytic <b>anti-RBC</b> <b>antibody</b> were lysed by guinea pig, but not by sheep serum, confirming high efficiency of homologous restriction of the complement. However, avidin-coated RBCs were lysed by homologous serum in the presence of anti-avidin antibody at low surface density of avidin attached. The elimination of the homologous restriction depends on the mode of avidin attachment: biotinylation of membrane amino groups provides antibodymediated lysis via the classical pathway of homologous complement, while insertion of biotinyl-lipid does not provide lysis...|$|E

Currently, mechanisms underlying AIHA pathogenesis are largely undefined. Here we explored the correlation of IL- 33 with AIHA disease activity and evaluated IL- 33 based therapeu-tics in AIHA treatment. Methods: Thirty patients diagnosed with AIHA of warm-type autoantibodies without treatment were enrolled and followed up for 6 months. Levels of cytokines including IL- 33, IL- 4, IL- 6 and IL- 13 was determined with ELISA. AIHA disease activity was presented by levels of reticulocyte count, hemoglobin and lactate dehydrogenase. Serum RBC-bound IgG autoantibody was detected using anti-IgG antibody with flow cytometry. To evaluate the effect of IL- 33 blockade on AIHA development, groups of B 6 mice were immunized with rat RBCs plus recombinant IL- 33 protein or IL- 33 neutralizing antibody respectively and detected for levels of <b>anti-RBC</b> <b>antibody,</b> frequency of reticulocytes an...|$|E
40|$|The New Zealand Black (NZB) mouse strain is a {{model of}} {{autoimmune}} haemolytic anaemia (AHA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), characterized by the production of anti-red blood cell (RBC) antibodies and anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA), respectively. A linkage analysis was carried out in an (NZB × BALB/c) F 2 cross in order to identify loci involved in the production of both anti-RBC IgM and IgG antibodies. These regions of linkage were compared with linkage data to ANA from the same cohort and other linkage analyses involving New Zealand mice. Four previously described NZB loci linked to <b>anti-RBC</b> <b>antibodies</b> were confirmed, and eight novel loci linked to this trait were also mapped: five of which were of NZB origin, and three derived from the non-autoimmune BALB/c background. A comparison between loci linked with <b>anti-RBC</b> <b>antibodies</b> and ANA demonstrated many that co-localize, suggesting the presence of genes that result in the general breaking of tolerance to self-antigen. Furthermore, the observation that some loci were associated only with the anti-RBC response suggests an antigen specific mechanism in addition to a general breaking of tolerance.

40|$|Hemophagocytic {{syndrome}} (HPS) is a fatal complication frequently {{associated with}} viral infections. In childhood HPS, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) {{is the major}} causative agent, and red blood cells (RBCs) are predominantly phagocytosed by macrophages. To investigate the mechanism of RBC phagocytosis triggered by EBV infection, we adopted a rabbit model of EBV-associated HPS previously established by using Herpesvirus papio (HVP). The kinetics of virus-host interaction was studied. Using flow cytometry, we detected the emergence of antibody-coated RBCs, as well as anti-platelet antibodies, at peak virus load period at weeks 3 to 4 after HVP injection, and the titers increased thereafter. The presence of anti-RBCs preceded RBC phagocytosis in tissues and predicted the full-blown development of HPS. The <b>anti-RBC</b> <b>antibodies</b> showed cross-reactivity with Paul-Bunnell heterophile antibodies. Preabsorption of the HVP-infected serum with control RBCs removed the majority of anti-RBC activities and remarkably reduced RBC phagocytosis. The RBC phagocytosis was specifically mediated via an Fc fragment of antibodies {{in the presence of}} macrophage activation. Therefore, the emergence of <b>anti-RBC</b> <b>antibodies</b> and the presence of macrophage activation are both essential in the development of HPS. Our observations in this animal model provide a potential mechanism for hemophagocytosis in EBV infection...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAllogeneic hematopoietic {{stem cell}} {{transplantation}} (HSCT) can be performed across the ABO blood group barrier. The impact of ABO incompatibility on clinical outcome is controversial. A retrospective analysis of 310 patients who underwent HSCT with reduced-intensity conditioning between 1998 and 2011 was performed to investigate the frequency and clinical implications of <b>anti-RBC</b> <b>antibodies</b> in passenger lymphocyte syndrome (PLS) after minor ABO mismatch (mm), persistent or recurring recipient type ABO antibodies (PRABO) after major ABO mm HSCT, and autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). Transplantation characteristics and clinical outcome were analyzed by univariate and multivariate analysis for groups with or without <b>anti-RBC</b> <b>antibodies.</b> ABO blood group incompatibility did not affect clinical outcome despite an increased requirement of blood transfusion. Twelve patients with AIHA, 6 patients with PLS, and 12 patients with PRABO post-HSCT were identified. AIHA did not affect overall survival (OS) or transplant-related mortality (TRM), but patients with AIHA had a lower incidence of grades II to IV acute graft-versus-host disease (P = . 05). OS in the PLS group was 0 % compared with 61 % in the whole group receiving minor ABO mm transplants (P < . 001). Comparing PRABO patients with those receiving a major ABO mm HSCT, the OS was 17 % versus 73 % (P = . 002) and TRM was 50 % versus 21 % (P = . 03). At our center, PLS after minor ABO mm and PRABO antibodies after major ABO mm HSCT are significant risk factors for decreased OS and TRM. Our results suggest that occurrence of unexpected ABO antibodies after HSCT warrant a wider investigation individual to find the underlying cause...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this program}} were to establish, in Newfoundland, the recently described method for making monoclonal antibodies by cell fusion, to explore {{various aspects of the}} technique and to attempt to produce lymphocyte hybridomas secreting monoclonal antibodies against human erythrocyte antigens. [...] Fusion, with the aid of polyethylene glycol, of spleen cells from an immunized mouse with mouse plasmacytoma cells, may result in formation of hybrid cells. Such hybrids, which contain a B lymphocyte nucleus from the spleen cells, may make monoclonal antibody. [...] Tests showed the plasmacytoma cells grew well in medium RPMI 1640 with 10 % fetal calf serum from a concentration of 2. 5 x 10 ⁴ to 4 x 10 ⁵ cells per ml. but viability declined rapidly if cultured longer. Polyethylene glycol was found to be toxic to these cells but a suitable concentration was found which allowed both cell fusion and survival of the resulting hybrids. Preliminary testing of the mouse response to red cells (RBC) of various species showed that the standard Jerne plaque technique gave good results with sheep RBC but no plaques with human RBC, even though serum antibody titres were satisfactory. Techniques were later established for detection, in culture fluid, of mouse immunoglobulin (inhibition of the antiglobulin test) and of specific <b>anti-RBC</b> <b>antibody</b> (agglutination). [...] After 35 fusions and various modifications, the method began to produce hybridomas. Altogether in a series of seven successful fusions 152 colonies were produced with 82 colonies secreting mouse immunoglobulin and 4 of those secreting anti-human RBC antibody. [...] Of nine species of red cells tested, the only ones to be agglutinated by the four culture supernatants were human RBC. Red cell samples from 87 unrelated humans were screened and all were agglutinated by each of the four culture supernatants. Using 2 -mercaptoethanol all four antibodies behaved as if they were Ig M. It was concluded that these monoclonal antibodies were species specific and not detecting alleles. [...] It is evident from these and other published studies that monoclonal antibodies with allelic specificity may be less easy to obtain than expected...|$|E
40|$|West Nile Virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne {{pathogen}} {{of global}} significance. It is active on several continents and {{is responsible for}} recent outbreaks of fever and fatal encephalitis in humans and horses. While highly virulent strains {{have been reported in}} Europe, North, Central and South America, only a benign subtype of WNV (Kunjin virus – KUNV) occurs in Australia. However, virulent, exotic WNV strains are seen as a significant threat to Australia due to the ease with which this virus can move between continents and the presence of suitable vectors and hosts already within Australia. KUNV and WNV subtypes are antigenically and genetically very closely related and cross-react in traditional serological tests. This cross-reactivity makes it very difficult to differentiate between KUNV and WNV infections using standard serological tests. The aim of this thesis was to identify immunogenic epitopes unique to KUNV or WNV and to use these epitopes {{in the development of a}} rapid assay that would enable the diagnosis of and surveillance for exotic virulent strains of WNV in Australia. The rapid diagnostic platform chosen was a red blood cell (RBC) agglutination assay that was originally patented and commercialised by AGEN Biomedical Ltd. The RBC agglutination assay reagent consists of the Fab region of a human erythrocyte-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) conjugated to the epitope of interest (in this instance, a WNV-specific peptide). This bi-functional reagent causes the agglutination of the patient’s erythrocytes in the presence of WNV-specific antibody in the patient’s serum. Traditionally, these RBC agglutination reagents have been produced by chemical conjugation. However, a potentially easier and cheaper method involves the linking of the gene encoding the erythrocyte-specific antibody to that encoding the epitope to create a recombinant version of the bi-functional agglutination reagent through expression using prokaryotic or eukaryotic systems. To identify potential differential epitopes, 18 mAbs to WNV (NY 99 strain) prM and envelope (E) proteins were assessed. One mAb (17 D 7) differentially recognised WNV and KUNV in ELISA and maintained recognition of its corresponding epitope upon reduction and carboxymethylation of the viral antigen, suggesting a continuous (linear) epitope. Using synthetic peptides, the epitope was mapped to a 19 amino acid sequence (WN 19 : E 147 - 165) encompassing the WNV NY 99 E protein glycosylation site at position 154. An amino acid substitution at position E 156 of many KUNV strains abolishes this glycosylation moiety. The inability of WNV-positive horse and mouse sera to bind the synthetic peptides indicated that glycosylation was required for recognition of peptide WN 19 by WNV-specific antibodies in sera. N-linked glycosylation of WN 19 was achieved through expression of the peptide as a C-terminal fusion protein in mammalian cells and specific reactivity of WNV-positive horse sera to the glycosylated WN 19 fusion protein was shown by Western blot. Additional sera collected from horses that had been infected with Murray Valley encephalitis virus (MVEV), which is similarly glycosylated at position E 154 and exhibits high sequence identity to WNV NY 99 in this region, also recognised the recombinant peptide. In contrast, no reactivity with the recombinant peptide was observed by sera from horses infected with the unglycosylated WNV subtype, KUNV. Failure of most WNV- and MVEV-positive horse sera to recognise the epitope as a deglycosylated fusion protein (75 % and 100 % respectively) confirmed that the N-linked glycan is important for antibody recognition of the peptide. Together, these results suggest that the induction of antibodies to the WN 19 epitope during WNV infection of horses is generally associated with E protein glycosylation of the infecting viral strain. To assess the feasibility of using peptide WN 19 in a rapid immunoassay, the peptide was recombinantly fused to a RBC (glycophorin) -specific single chain antibody (scFv) using previously published constructs which were developed for the bacterial expression of similar bi-functional reagents. To facilitate glycosylation of peptide WN 19, the genes for the bi-functional agglutination reagents were subsequently cloned into eukaryotic expression vectors. An additional set of constructs were also produced in which the genes for the variable regions of the <b>anti-RBC</b> <b>antibody</b> were cloned into a vector for the secreted expression of an intact, humanised IgG 1 molecule. Stable cell lines were produced for each of these constructs and secreted up to 700 ng/mL glycophorin-reactive antibody. The secreted recombinant protein could be harvested directly from the cell culture medium and used in RBC agglutination assays, where these bi-functional agglutination reagents could be cross-linked either with mAb 17 D 7 or by anti-peptide WN 19 antibodies present in WNV-positive horse serum. The WNV NY 99 prM protein was also identified as a useful marker of WNV-infection in horses, as well as a putative antigen to differentiate equine WNV NY 99 and KUNV infections using Western blot. Two anti-WNV prM mAbs were also generated in this study and will be extremely valuable in future studies. Preliminary analysis of the prM epitope(s) bound by these mAbs and WNV-immune sera indicate that the binding site(s) is likely to be localised to pr and is conformational...|$|E

40|$|Leucocytozoon parasites infect a {{large number}} of avian hosts, {{including}} domestic chicken, and cause significant economical loss to the poultry industry. Although the transmission stages of the parasites were observed in avian blood cells more than a century ago, the spe-cific host cell type(s) that the gametocytes infect remain uncertain. Because all the avian blood cells, including red blood cells (RBCs), are nucleated, and the developing parasites dramatically change the morphology of the infected host cells, it has been difficult to identify Leucocytozoon infected host cell(s). Here we use cell-type specific antibodies to investigate the identities of the host cells infected by Leucocytozoon sabrazesi gametocytes. <b>Anti-RBC</b> <b>antibodies</b> stained RBCs membrane strongly, but not the parasite-infected cells, ruling out the possibility of RBCs being the infected host cells.

40|$|Recently, while {{studying}} erythrocytic apoptosis during Plasmodium yoelii infection, we observed {{an increase in}} the levels of non-parasitised red blood cell (nRBC) apoptosis, which could be related to malarial anaemia. Therefore, in the present study, we attempted to investigate whether nRBC apoptosis is associated with the peripheral RBC count, parasite load or immune response. To this end, BALB/c mice were infected with P. yoelii 17 XL and nRBC apoptosis, number of peripheral RBCs, parasitaemia and plasmatic levels of cytokines, nitric oxide and <b>anti-RBC</b> <b>antibodies</b> were evaluated at the early and late stages of anaemia. The apoptosis of nRBCs increased at the late stage and was associated with parasitaemia, but not with the intensity of the immune response. The increased percentage of nRBC apoptosis that was observed when anaemia was accentuated was not related to a reduction in peripheral RBCs. We conclude that nRBC apoptosis in P. yoelii malaria appears to be induced in response to a high parasite load. Further studies on malaria models in which acute anaemia develops during low parasitaemia are needed to identify the potential pathogenic role of nRBC apoptosis...|$|R
40|$|Autoimmune {{hemolytic}} anemia (AIHA) {{is a disease}} in which autoantibodies against red blood cells (RBCs) lead to their premature destruction. Most clinically significant autoantibodies are of the immunoglobulin G (IgG) type, which leads primarily to the uptake and destruction of RBCs by splenic and hepatic macrophages. Therapies such as corticosteroids and splenectomy are directed at interfering with this process. Liposomally encapsulated clodronate (dichloromethylene diphosphonate) has previously {{been found to be}} a potent antimacrophage agent. It selectively depletes animals of macrophages within 24 hours of administration by inducing apoptosis in these cells. Therefore, we hypothesized that liposomal clodronate would be a useful agent for treating AIHA.

40|$|Haemolytic {{disease of}} the fetus and newborn (HDFN) is a severe disease in which fetal red blood cells (RBC) are {{destroyed}} by maternal anti-RBC IgG alloantibodies. HDFN is most often caused by anti-D but may also occur due to anti-K, -c- or -E. We recently found N-linked glycosylation of anti-D to be skewed towards low fucosylation, thereby increasing the affinity to IgG-Fc receptor IIIa and IIIb, which correlated with HDFN disease severity. Here, we analysed 230 pregnant women with anti-c, -E or -K alloantibodies from a prospective screening cohort and investigated the type of Fc-tail glycosylation of these antibodies {{in relation to the}} trigger of immunisation and pregnancy outcome. Anti-c, -E and -K show - independent of the event that had led to immunisation - a different kind of Fc-glycosylation compared to that of the total IgG fraction, but with less pronounced differences compared to anti-D. High Fc-galactosylation and sialylation of anti-c correlated with HDFN disease severity, while low anti-K Fc-fucosylation correlated with severe fetal anaemia.

40|$|The {{observed}} skewing in {{the repertoire}} of VH, D, and JH gene segments strongly {{indicates that the}} leukemic Igs in CLL patients with AIHA have been selected because of particular antigen specificities that could promote {{the development of the}} hemolytic anemia. This could occur either by a direct involvement of the CLL Ig in erythrocyte destruction or, indirectly, by inducing the production of pathogenic antierythrocyte antibodies. The first possibility was supported by our recent finding that in most CLL cases a small subset of leukemic cells undergoes Ig isotype-switching. 9 The isotypeswitched CLL cells were found to produce both membrane and secretory -chain transcripts, of which the latter could encode part of the IgG antibodies that have been implicated in RBC destruction. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the reactivity of the Igs expressed by the leukemic cells from the CLL-AIHA patients HA- 2 and HA- 5. These two Igs contained strikingly similar heavy-chain CDR 3 regions that were associated with the 51 p 1 VH gene segment; both of them used λ light chains that belonged to different Vλ gene families (HA- 2 VL is 95. 5 % homologous to Humlv 122 from the VλI family, and HA- 5 VL is 93 % homologous to Humlv 318 from the VλIII family). The VH and VL region genes from these two Igs were expressed in eukaryotic cell lines as dimeric single-chain (sc) Fv fragments, and their reactivities were tested against erythrocytes and a panel of self and foreign antigens. Indirect immunofluorescence analysis with the affinity-purified scFv fragments showed the absence of any significant RBC binding. On the other hand, both antibody fragments showed similar low-affinity binding to human IgG (FIGURE 1 B) and various reactivities against other antigens such as phosphorylcholine, dextran, lipopolysaccharide, and single-stranded DNA. These data indicate that the 51 pl-encoded CLL Igs are not directly involved in RBC destruction, but could promote the development of AIHA by inducing a disturbance in the idiotypic network that would ultimately lead to the expansion of autoreactive B cell clones with antierythrocyte specificity. Alternatively, secreted isotype-switched CLL Igs could bind to <b>anti-RBC</b> <b>antibodies</b> and could promote the adherence of sensitized red blood cells to the Fc receptors on macrophages...|$|R
40|$|The {{glycoprotein}} CD 47 (integrin-associated protein, IAP) {{is present}} {{on the surface of}} virtually all cells, including red blood cells (RBCs). CD 47 acts like a marker of self by ligating the macrophage inhibitory receptor signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPalpha). In this manner mild reactivity of wild-type RBCs with macrophage phagocytic receptors is tolerated, whereas otherwise identical CD 47 -deficient RBCs are rapidly eliminated. We show here that virtually all CD 47 -deficient nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice spontaneously develop severe lethal autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) at 180 to 280 days of age, whereas none of the control CD 47 (+) NOD mice develop lethal AIHA at least {{during the first year of}} life. This phenotype is at least partially due to a markedly increased rate of elimination of opsonized CD 47 (-/-) compared to CD 47 (+) RBCs. Similarly, CD 47 (-/-) C 57 BL/ 6 mice were much more sensitive than their wild-type counterparts to experimental passive AIHA induced by <b>anti-RBC</b> monoclonal <b>antibodies.</b> Thus, CD 47 -SIRPalpha signaling can have a profound influence on the severity of AIHA, making manipulation of this signaling pathway a theoretically appealing avenue in the treatment of the disease...|$|R

Each treatment was found to attenuate thrombocytopenia in a dose-dependent manner and, consistent with previous work, IVIG was found to increase antiplatelet antibody clearance in a dose-dependent manner. TER 119 demonstrated greater effects on thrombocytopenia relative to other therapies (peak platelet counts: 224 % ± 34 % of initial platelet counts for 50 μg TER 119 /mouse versus 160 % ± 34 % for 2 g/kg IVIG, 88 % ± 36 % for 60 μmol lipid/kg AMI-coated liposomes, and 80 % ± 25 % for 60 μmol lipid/kg IVIG-coated liposomes). However, the effects of TER 119 were associated with severe hemolysis, as TER 119 decreased RBC counts by approximately 50 %.

Each IgG-RBC preparation was labeled with 99 mTc, and was reinjected iv with autologous rat RBCs labeled with 111 In to correct for 99 mTc present in the blood contained in each organ. The mean specific spleen uptakes per gram of the three IgG-RBC preparations increased according {{to the level of}} RBC sensitization but were at least 10 times higher in each instance than the mean specific liver uptake per gram. Consistent with the clearance curves of IgG(PNA) -RBCs, the mean specific splenic uptake per gram of those RBCs was significantly increased as compared to the same parameters determined using either IgG(total) -RBCs or IgG(Con A) -RBCs. In contrast, the mean specific liver uptakes per gram of IgG(PNA) -RBCs, of IgG(Con A) RBCs, or of IgG(total) -RBCs were not significantly different under otherwise identical experimental conditions. The increase in the splenic removal of IgG(PNA) -RBCs was C 3 independent. Furthermore, splenic macrophages isolated from rats were able to bind in vitro significantly more IgG(PNA) -RBCs than IgG(total) -RBCs or IgG(Con A) -RBCs. These data therefore support the concept that, in the rat, the kinetic of removal of IgG-RBCs from the bloodstream by the Fc receptors of splenic mononuclear phagocytes may vary according to the nature of accessible carbohydrates located in the Fc domain of IgG antibody molecules coating the erythrocytes.

40|$|The {{research}} {{described in}} this thesis focuses on diseases of antibody-mediated blood cell destruction via FcγRs on phagocytes, in particular regarding platelets in fetal or neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (FNAIT) and red blood cells (RBC) in hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN). Diagnostically, for HDFN laboratory tests are in place in order to predict risk for severe fetal RBC destruction and thereby initiate appropriate treatments. This test is sensitive, but has relatively low specificity. For FNAIT, no diagnostic laboratory test is currently available to predict severe fetal platelet destruction. For FNAIT {{it has been suggested}} that the decrease in platelet numbers is determined by the antibody titer, but this correlation does not appear to be that strict. This indicates that other factors, besides antibody-titer are involved and as such C-reactive protein (CRP) and anti-platelet IgG-fucosylation are identified. CRP, which bound to platelets after platelet-oxidation, enhanced antibody-mediated platelet destruction both in vitro and in vivo and was found to be elevated in immune thrombocytopenic patients. CRP levels dropped after IVIg-treatment, accompanied by normalization of platelet counts and decreased clinical bleeding severity. A low Fc-fucosylation was observed for anti- platelet antibodies in FNAIT (and not for total IgG), which resulted in increased binding affinity to FcγRIIIa/b, increased platelet phagocytosis, correlated with neonatal platelet counts and also correlated with an adverse clinical scenario. The clinical data need to be validated in larger patient cohorts, but monitoring of Fc-fucosylation levels in FNAIT has promising diagnostic potential. A lowered Fc-fucosylation was also found for <b>anti-RBC</b> (anti-D) <b>antibodies</b> in pregnancy, which correlated with increased hemolysis in a small pilot-study, however more research is needed. The low anti-D Fc-fucose also occurred in male hyperimmunized anti-D donors (although to a lesser extent than pregnant women), indicating that the regulation of a lowered fucosylation is not strictly dependent upon a pregnancy setting. The implications of antibody-fucosylation in anti-D immunoprophylaxis, derived from hyperimmunized donors, are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|EndoS from Streptococcus pyogenes is an immunomodulating {{enzyme that}} {{specifically}} hydrolyzes glycans from human IgG and thereby affects antibody effector functions. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia {{is caused by}} antibody mediated red blood cell (RBC) destruction and often resists treatment with corticosteroids that also cause frequent adverse effects. We show here that anti-RhD (anti-D) and rabbit anti-human-RBC <b>antibodies</b> (<b>anti-RBC)</b> mediated destruction of RBC, i. e. phagocytosis, complement activation and hemolysis in vitro and in vivo was inhibited by EndoS. Phagocytosis by monocytes in vitro was inhibited by pre-treatment of anti-D with EndoS before sensitization of RBC, and abrogated by direct addition of EndoS to blood containing sensitized RBC. The toxic effects of monocytes stimulated with anti-D-sensitized RBC, as measured by interleukin- 8 secretion and oxygen metabolite production, was restrained by EndoS. Agglutination of RBC and complement mediated hemolysis in vitro in whole human blood caused by rabbit anti-RBC was inhibited by EndoS. Development of anemia in mice caused by a murine anti-RBC IgG 2 a monoclonal autoantibody, and complement activation and erythrophagocytosis by Kupffer cells in the liver, were reduced by EndoS. Our data indicate that EndoS is a potential therapeutic agent that might be evaluated {{as an alternative to}} current treatment regimens against antibody mediated destruction of RBC...|$|R
40|$|The {{percentage}} of normal human monocytes (MCs) that {{are able to}} form rosettes with, and subsequently phagocytose, IgG-coated red blood cells (RBCs) has been determined in vitro using five batches of <b>anti-RBC</b> IgG <b>antibodies.</b> These antibodies differed from each other by their capacity to bind to lectins recognizing two of the oligosaccharide structures of the Fc domain, namely, peanut agglutinin (PNA) and concanavalin A (ConA) which specifically bind to beta-galactosyl and alpha-mannosyl residues, respectively. The threshold between high (H) and low (L) binding capacities (BC) was arbitrarily fixed at 15 % of mean specific binding. For each level of RBC sensitization tested (1500 - 6000 Ab molecules/one RBC), the {{percentage of}} MCs binding at least three IgG-RBCs was similar whatever the IgG Ab preparations used. In contrast, the percentage of MCs capable of phagocytosing at least three IgG-RBCs coated with 3000, 4500 and 6000 IgG/cell, as well as the phagocytosis index (number of IgG-RBCs ingested/ 100 MCs) of IgG-RBCs coated with 1500, 3000, 4500 and 6000 IgG/cell, were significantly lower (P less than 0. 01 at least) using IgG Ab molecules with either [(PNA-H) (ConA-H) ] BC, [(PNA-L) (ConA-H) ] BC or with [(PNA-L) (ConA-L) ] BC than the corresponding values measured using RBCs coated with IgG Ab molecules exhibiting [(PNA-H) (ConA-L) ] BC. The binding to MCs of 125 I-labelled anti-RBC IgG Ab molecules exhibiting different binding profiles to PNA and to ConA was studied by Scatchard plot analysis. A single class of binding sites was observed in each case. MCs bound a mean of 23, 000 IgG molecules with a mean association constant (Ka) for IgG binding of about 1. 4 X 10 (8) M- 1. These data indicate that terminal (and/or accessible) galactosyl and mannosyl residues of IgG Ab molecules {{play a role in the}} ingestion of IgG-RBCs by human MCs, despite the fact IgG Ab binding to IgG(Fc) receptors is not significantly affected. Thus, when studying the phagocytosis of IgG-coated RBC by human MC monolayers, the assay should be performed not only using similar RBC/MC ratios and IgG coating values, but also with IgG antibodies having comparable mean PNA and ConA binding capacities.
