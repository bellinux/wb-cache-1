5|$|As Remy watches {{through the}} window, {{a young man}} named Alfredo Linguini is hired as a garbage boy by Skinner, the restaurant's {{paranoid}} current owner and Gusteau's former sous-chef. When Linguini spills a pot of soup and attempts to recreate it, Remy recognizes that he is ruining it instead, and repairs Linguini's mistakes. Linguini catches Remy but hides him when he is then confronted by Skinner for tampering with the soup. As the two <b>argue,</b> <b>the</b> soup is accidentally served and proves to be a success. The Chefs convince Skinner to retain Linguini, who is assumed to be the soup's creator. When Skinner catches Remy trying to escape, he orders Linguini to kill the rat, but Linguini discovers Remy's intelligence and decides to keep him instead.|$|E

5|$|DST has mixed {{effects on}} health. In {{societies}} with fixed work schedules it provides more afternoon sunlight for outdoor exercise.

5|$|In 1629, George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore, {{arrived in}} Virginia, having {{traveled}} south from Avalon, his failed colony on Newfoundland. Calvert was not welcomed by the Virginians, both because his Catholicism offended them as Protestants, {{and because it}} was no secret that Calvert desired a charter for a portion of the land that the Virginians considered their own. After a brief stay, Calvert returned to England to press for just such a charter, and Claiborne, in his capacity as Secretary of State of Virginia colony, was sent to England to <b>argue</b> <b>the</b> Virginians' case. This happened to be to Claiborne's private advantage, as he was also trying to complete the arrangements for the trading post on Kent Island.|$|E

In February 2009 Robert J.

5|$|Often {{compared}} to San Francisco {{due to the}} hilly terrain and steep maze of residential streets, housing in St. John's is typically painted in bright colours. The city council has implemented strict heritage regulations in the downtown area, including restrictions on the height of buildings. These regulations have caused much controversy over the years.

Heritage advocates <b>argue</b> <b>the</b> current regulations should be enforced while others believe the regulations should be relaxed to encourage economic development.|$|E
5|$|Only {{four days}} after {{returning}} from the Moscow Conference, Ismay left England again for the Cairo Conference and Teheran Conference with Churchill. One major source of conflict at the Cairo Conference was an American proposal to appoint an overall commander for the strategic bombing of Germany. Ismay and the British were strongly opposed, and Ismay wrote a long paper against the idea, which became the basis of British policy on the subject. At Teheran, Ismay helped to <b>argue</b> <b>the</b> case for Operation Overlord, but immediately after the conference he developed bronchitis and returned to England by ship, scrapping his other plans for the trip.|$|E
5|$|Other {{studies by}} Taylor find that all {{tetrapods}} appear {{to hold their}} necks at the maximum possible vertical extension when in a normal, alert posture; they <b>argue</b> <b>the</b> same would hold true for sauropods barring any unknown, unique characteristics that set the soft tissue anatomy of their necks apart from that of other animals. Apatosaurus, like Diplodocus, would have held its neck angled upwards with the head pointing downwards in a resting posture. Kent Stevens and Michael Parrish (1999 and 2005) state Apatosaurus had a great feeding range; its neck could bend into a U-shape laterally. The neck's range of movement would have also allowed the head to feed {{at the level of}} the feet.|$|E

5|$|Gurovich, Guillermo Rougier, and colleagues, on {{the other}} hand, {{maintain}} that the dentary is referable to Ferugliotherium and that the p4s of Argentodites and MACN Pv-RN 975 are very similar. The alveolus of MACN Pv-RN 975 fits the lower incisors attributed to Ferugliotherium in size and the blade-like premolar is of the size expected for an animal with molariforms the size of Ferugliotherium teeth. If the dentary and premolars (whose identification has been similarly controversial; see below) {{do not belong to}} Ferugliotherium, then, Gurovich and Beck <b>argue,</b> <b>the</b> Los Alamitos Formation would contain two mammals (Ferugliotherium and a multituberculate) similar in size and morphology, and therefore presumably occupying similar ecological niches—and one of those would be represented only by molariforms and incisors and the other only by premolars and a jaw fragment among the available fossils. Furthermore, they noted that the transition from blade-like to molariform premolars had actually been observed in the fossil record of the extinct sthenurine kangaroos, and that the first molariform in Sudamerica and Gondwanatherium is laterally compressed, suggesting that it may have derived from a blade-like tooth. Gurovich and Beck attributed the difference in shape between the MACN Pv-RN 975 and Argentodites p4s to the extensive wear of the former, and suggested that the two are similar enough that they probably represent at least closely related species.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, Hornsby {{was again}} hired {{to manage the}} St. Louis Browns, his first major league job in 16 years. The Browns' owner, Bill Veeck, {{was the son of}} former Cubs {{president}} and general manager William Veeck, Sr. Hornsby was not well received by the players, however. On June9, he was fired due to a disagreement with Veeck over an incident against the Yankees the day before. During the game, a fan prevented Gil McDougald of the Yankees from catching a fly ball, and the umpire ruled that it was fan interference. Hornsby did not initially <b>argue</b> <b>the</b> call, and a few minutes later Veeck forced him to do it (when {{it was already too late}} to do anything about it). This led to Hornsby and the Browns parting ways. The Browns players were so happy about Hornsby's firing that they gave Veeck an engraved trophy to thank him.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to the worsening security situation, William conducted his second northern campaign in 1069. He built another castle in York, on what is now Baile Hill {{on the west bank}} of the Ouse opposite the first castle, in an effort to improve his control over the city. This second castle was also a motte and bailey design, with the Baile Hill motte probably reached by a horizontal bridge and steps cut up the side of the motte. Later that year, a Danish Viking fleet sailed up to York along the Humber and the Ouse, and attacked both castles with the assistance of Cospatrick of Northumbria and a number of local rebels. The Normans, attempting to drive the rebels back, set fire to some of the city's houses. The fire grew out of control and also set fire to York Minster and, some <b>argue,</b> <b>the</b> castles as well. The castles were captured and partially dismantled, and Malet was taken hostage by the Danes.|$|E
5|$|Religious {{debates over}} the Harry Potter series of books by J. K. Rowling are based on claims that the novels contain occult or Satanic subtexts. A number of Protestant, Catholic, and Orthodox Christians have argued against the series, as have some Shia and Sunni Muslims. Supporters of the series {{have said that the}} magic in Harry Potter bears little {{resemblance}} to occultism, being more in the vein of fairy tales such as Cinderella and Snow White, or to the works of C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien, both of whom are known for writing fantasy novels with Christian subtexts. Far from promoting a particular religion, some <b>argue,</b> <b>the</b> Harry Potter novels {{go out of their way}} to avoid discussing religion at all. However, the author of the series, J. K. Rowling, describes herself as a practising Christian, and many have noted the Christian references which she includes in the final novel Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.|$|E
5|$|Alexander F. Reichert was {{appointed}} by the Supreme Court to <b>argue</b> <b>the</b> case for Lara. Reichert argued that an Indian tribe had no inherent sovereignty in regards to non-member Indians, but only the power that Congress decided to give the tribe, citing Duro, Wheeler, and Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe to support his argument. He stated {{that it was the}} place of the Supreme Court, not Congress, to determine the inherent sovereignty of the tribe. Lara argued that since the tribe had no such inherent sovereignty, it could only prosecute a non-member Indian based upon federal sovereignty, which would make a subsequent Federal prosecution a violation of the prohibition of double jeopardy. It was noted that members of Indian tribes were at the same time United States citizens, and protected under the constitution {{in the same manner as}} any other citizen. Reichert stated that Duro was decided as a constitutional issue, not as a matter of common law, and it was the Court's place to determine the issue, not the place of Congress. To subject Lara to a prosecution by a tribal court, which was not subject to the Bill of Rights, would deprive Lara of his rights as a United States citizen. Lara's position was supported by amicus curiae briefs filed by the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, Lewis County, Idaho, (along with several other counties), the Citizen's Equal Rights Foundation, and T. Morris, E. Morris, and R. Morris (individual Indians).|$|E
