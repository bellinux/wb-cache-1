5|$|Anderson {{was known}} to have a liking for {{participating}} in international competitions. His first test at the international stage was during the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York. Canada finished sixth in the tournament while Anderson scored four points in six games.

5|$|Claus and Lavie are {{initially}} {{treated as}} intruders but eventually befriend {{the crew of}} the Silvana. They learn that the Guild intends to capture Alvis for reasons unknown to them. In the first battle between the Silvana and Guild forces, Guild member Dio Eraclea takes an interest in Claus's flying skills and his signature move, the Immelmann turn. Wanting to learn more about Claus, Dio willingly allows himself to be captured. He reveals to the Silvana's captain, Alex Row, the existence of one of four Mysteria which act <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> something known as Exile.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to its losses, UBS announced a CHF 15billion rights offering {{to raise the}} additional funds need to shore up its depleted reserves of capital. UBS cut its dividend {{in order to protect}} its traditionally high Tier 1 capital ratio, seen by investors <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> its credibility as the world's largest wealth management company. Marcel Ospel, who had been the architect of the merger that created UBS in 1998, also announced that he would step down as a chairman of the bank to be replaced by Peter Kurer, the bank's general counsel with virtually no banking experience. This ultimately proved very costly to UBS.|$|E

5|$|The {{refusal of}} the United States {{government}} to take promised military action {{in the face of}} North Vietnamese violations of the cease-fire is also examined <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> the defeat. Adherents to this claim believed that South Vietnam could have been saved by another U.S. bombing campaign. The conflict between the executive and legislative branches of the American government, already severe before the onset of the Operation Linebacker II in 1972, was only more exasperating during 1975, when a new campaign would probably only have provoked even more Congressional outrage.|$|E
5|$|Until the end {{of their}} collaboration, Turunen's singing was a {{trademark}} of Nightwish. She was known as the face and voice of Nightwish while bandleader Holopainen was the soul. Turunen was seen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> Nightwish's success. She is respected by other musicians of the metal genre and is an influence on their work; for instance, Simone Simons of Epica names her as her inspiration to study classical music and apply that vocal style to a metal band.|$|E
5|$|When established, {{the company}} was based at Tananger in Sola outside Stavanger and had its main {{operative}} base at Stavanger Airport, Sola. The head office was later moved to Fornebu in Bærum outside Oslo, and the main base moved to Oslo Airport, Fornebu. At its peak the company had 196 employees, of which 144 were based in Norway. At the time of bankruptcy, the company had 120 employees, of which 78 were flight staff. Air Europe's CEO Rod Lynch stated that Air Europe, and in extension Norway Airlines, had forty percent lower operating costs than Lufthansa and twenty percent lower than British Airways. Lynch emphasized the lack of trade unions <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> holding costs down. Air Europe claimed a thirty-four percent market share on passengers between Oslo and London.|$|E

25|$|Southern land owners regained {{control over}} {{almost all of}} the land they had claimed before the war. The {{national}} dialogue about land ownership <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> success for freedpeople gave way (in the sphere of White politics and media) to the implementation of a plantation wage system. Under pressure from Johnson and other pro-capital politicians in the North, and from almost all of White society in the South, the Freedmen's Bureau was transformed from a protector of land rights to an enforcer of wage labor.|$|E
25|$|The Fragility of Goodness {{confronts the}} ethical dilemma that {{individuals}} strongly committed to justice are nevertheless vulnerable to external {{factors that may}} deeply compromise or even negate their human flourishing. Discussing literary as well as philosophical texts, Nussbaum seeks {{to determine the extent}} to which reason may enable self-sufficiency. She eventually rejects the Platonic notion that human goodness can fully protect against peril, siding with the tragic playwrights and Aristotle in treating the acknowledgment of vulnerability <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> realizing the human good.|$|E

25|$|By {{a similar}} token, Cocoa {{provides}} a pervasive data manipulation method called key-value coding (KVC). This allows {{a piece of}} data or property of an object to be looked up or changed at runtime by name. The property name acts <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> the value. In traditional languages, this late binding is impossible. KVC leads to great design flexibility. An object's type need not be known, yet any property of that object can be discovered using KVC. Also, by extending this system using something Cocoa terms key-value observing (KVO), automatic support for undo-redo is provided.|$|E
25|$|Sully backs out, so Nate and Chloe {{continue}} to the Nepalese city, ravaged by Lazarević's mercenaries {{in search of}} the temple.

At the temple, Nate and Chloe use the phurba <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> uncover Shambhala's location in the Himalayas. After Jeff is shot in an ambush, Chloe insists on abandong him; Nate and Elena help him but are caught by Lazarević. Chloe switches sides to maintain her cover while Lazarević kills Jeff and gets the Shambhala location from Nate, who escapes with Elena.|$|E
25|$|Early in Sonic Adventure 2, Knuckles and Rouge {{argue over}} the Emerald; {{she wants the}} pieces for her {{personal}} collection. Eggman tries to steal it, so Knuckles shatters it aboard Eggman's hovercraft, sending the pieces every which way. He spends the game recollecting the pieces similarly to in Adventure. He later helps Sonic, Tails, and Amy find Eggman's base inside a giant pyramid, as well <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> an inner chamber housing a giant space shuttle. He follows them to a giant space station called the ARK with it, where he again scuffles with Rouge over the Emerald. He saves her from falling into a constructed pit of lava; she decides the shards are worthless and dismissively lets him keep them, so he reassembles the Emerald and runs off. The game's antagonist Gerald Robotnik, Eggman's grandfather, initiates a program to send the ARK {{on a collision course}} with Earth as revenge for an attack on the ARK decades earlier, so Knuckles teams up with the other playable characters to reroute it.|$|E

25|$|David Freidel and F. Kent Reilly III proposed, in 2010, that, {{rather than}} a unique script, the Cascajal Block in fact {{represents}} a special arrangement of sacred objects used in ancient times for magical purposes. They propose that the incised symbols on the block represent the contents of three sacred bundles arranged in three separate registers {{from top to bottom}}. These sacred bundles include well known objects used in magic and divination rituals. Many of these objects/signs, arranged horizontally within the registers, are present in all three registers. The whole block is to be read in boustrophedon fashion from top to bottom and alternatively left to right and right to left. Freidel and Reilly argue {{that the majority of the}} symbols on the block are found in the established corpus of Middle Formative art and many are otherwise part of iconographically comprehensible compositions that are designed to be read pictographically and not as script encoding spoken language. Rather than to regard the Cascajal Block as an epistemological dead-end—the conclusion if it is identified as a unique script—they identify the block <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> understanding a special arrangement of sacred objects presented in the course of a religious ritual. The purpose of this may have been to memorialize the acts of divination or other magical rituals. This was a pervasive ritual practice well attested in the archaeology of Formative period Mesoamerica.|$|E
