5|$|Most <b>applicants</b> {{choose to}} apply {{to one of the}} {{individual}} colleges, which work with each other to ensure that the best students gain a place somewhere at the university regardless of their college preferences. Shortlisting is based on achieved and predicted exam results, school references, and, in some subjects, written admission tests or candidate-submitted written work. Approximately 60% of <b>applicants</b> are shortlisted, although this varies by subject. If a large number of shortlisted <b>applicants</b> for a subject choose one college, then students who named that college may be reallocated randomly to under-subscribed colleges for the subject. The colleges then invite shortlisted candidates for interview, where they are provided with food and accommodation for around three days in December. Most <b>applicants</b> will be individually interviewed by academics at more than one college. Students from outside Europe can be interviewed remotely, for example, over the Internet.|$|E
