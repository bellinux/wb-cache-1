500|$|For {{the music}} to , O'Donnell began work on {{crafting}} the game's themes before Salvatori joined the team in February 2009. [...] "Marty [...] had started writing before me, <b>and</b> <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> some of his ideas," [...] Salvatori said. [...] "I picked a few that I felt I could add some magic to, and worked on those. I also came up with several ideas that I sent to Marty that {{he put his hands}} on." [...] Once the duo felt they had enough material, the Chicago-based Salvatori flew to Bungie in Seattle to complete the arrangements and record live musicians.|$|E
500|$|McCreary {{introduced}} a new Hydra theme for the season, explaining that [...] "Last season got pretty musically complicated. I had a theme that associated itself with Centipede, The Clairvoyant, John Garrett and Raina. That theme ultimately functioned like a Hydra Theme. I had a theme for Victoria Hand that, while the audience briefly suspected her, also functioned as the Hydra Theme. I had a theme for Garrett that also acted like the theme for Hydra. It got so complicated ... The answer was obvious: I needed to write a new Hydra Theme, one that could be associated with Dr. Whitehall." [...] For Hayley Atwell's appearances as Peggy Carter, McCreary decided to quote the Agent Carter theme composed by Christopher Lennertz for the Agent Carter short film. On using Lennertz's theme, McCreary said, [...] "I was excited {{for the opportunity to}} incorporate his music into my S.H.I.E.L.D. score, because it further cements the Marvel [...] Universe together as a coherent whole ... Chris was thrilled <b>and</b> <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> his scores for reference." [...] A soundtrack featuring music from the first and second seasons was released by Marvel Music digitally on September 4, 2015, and on CD in October 2015.|$|E
500|$|With the {{appearance}} of Carter, McCreary decided to quote the Agent Carter theme composed by Christopher Lennertz for the Agent Carter One-Shot. On using Lennertz's theme, McCreary said, [...] "I was excited {{for the opportunity to}} incorporate his music into my S.H.I.E.L.D. score, because it further cements the Marvel [...] Universe together as a coherent whole ... Chris was thrilled <b>and</b> <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> his scores for reference." [...] On his use of the theme, McCreary stated, as Carter [...] "storms in, the first violins state an elongated version of her theme soaring above an aggressive, orchestral ostinato". McCreary also introduced a new Hydra theme in the episode that represents Daniel Whitehall, and is used in scenes featuring the Obelisk and Carl Creel. About the theme, McCreary said [...] "In true bad-guy-theme fashion, the theme is constructed from distantly related minor chords, and contains lots of close intervals. I build a theme like this so it can easily [...] into increasingly dissonant variations. For example, the E in the C minor chord will clash against the E minor, as will the B in the G minor chord. Building the theme in this way means that, in the future, I can put this theme over any pedal tone bass note and it will always sound dissonant." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 671, the Chinese monk Yijing had {{a journey}} to seek the Pali Canon in India. After sailing for twenty days, his ship arrived in Foshih, the capital of Srivijaya Buddhist kingdom, where he [...] "...landed and stayed six months, {{gradually}} learning the Sanskrit grammar.

2500|$|However, Raffaele Cutolo {{has always}} {{maintained}} that Rosetta {{knew nothing of}} his criminal activities and did only what he asked: [...] "Rosetta {{has never been a}} Camorrista... She only listened to me <b>and</b> <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> a few suitcases of money to prisoners like i told her to." [...] Nevertheless, it is clear that Cutolo had always wanted to maintain a male-only organization based on principles such as criminal fraternity and so could never be seen giving a role to his sister. It could be argued {{that he did not want}} to implicate her and therefore, always insisted that she was innocent.|$|E
2500|$|Kerouac {{joined the}} United States Merchant Marine in 1942 and in 1943 joined the United States Navy, but served only eight days of active duty before {{arriving}} on the sick list. According to his medical report, Kerouac said he [...] "asked for an aspirin for his headaches and they diagnosed me dementia praecox <b>and</b> <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> here." [...] The medical examiner reported that Kerouac's military adjustment was poor, quoting Kerouac: [...] "I just can't stand it; I {{like to be}} by myself."

2500|$|McCreary {{created his}} own {{theme for the}} Tesseract, [...] "an ominous melodic line that shifts between two distantly related minor chords", and for Asgard, [...] "like an old fanfare, a melody that capture the majesty of Asgardian nobility" [...] though it is {{generally}} performed as a [...] "smaller version" [...] since the series is still [...] "rooted in reality". However, when Peggy Carter makes guest appearances on the series through flashbacks, McCreary quotes Christopher Lennertz's Agent Carter theme. McCreary said on this, [...] "I was excited {{for the opportunity to}} incorporate his music into my S.H.I.E.L.D. score, because it further cements the Marvel [...] Universe together as a coherent whole ...

2500|$|When he was 22 years old, Muir {{enrolled}} at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison, paying his own way for several years. There, under a towering black locust tree beside North Hall, Muir took his first botany lesson. A fellow student plucked a flower from the tree {{and used it to}} explain how the grand locust {{is a member of the}} pea family, related to the straggling pea plant. Fifty years later, the naturalist Muir described the day in his autobiography. [...] "This fine lesson charmed me <b>and</b> <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> flying to the woods and meadows in wild enthusiasm." [...] As a freshman, Muir studied chemistry with Professor Ezra Carr and his wife Jeanne; they became lifelong friends and Muir developed a lasting interest in chemistry and the sciences. Muir took an eclectic approach to his studies, attending classes for two years but never being listed higher than a first-year student due to his unusual selection of courses. Records showed his class status as [...] "irregular gent" [...] and, even though he never graduated, he learned enough geology and botany to inform his later wanderings.|$|E
