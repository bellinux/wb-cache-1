40|$|This study {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} the impact of global climate policies on mercury emissions using the Greenhouse Gas and Air Pollution Interactions and Synergies (GAINS) model in the time horizon up to 2050. The time evolution of mercury emissions is based on projections of energy consumption provided by the Prospective Outlook for the Long term Energy System (POLES) model for a scenario without any global greenhouse gas mitigation efforts, and for a 2 °C climate policy scenario, which assumes internationally coordinated action to mitigate climate change. Outcomes of the analysis are reported globally and for key world regions: EU- 27, China, India and the US. The assessment takes into account current air pollution control legislation in each country. Scenario calculations for mercury emissions indicate significant scope for co-benefits made possible through climate policies. Atmospheric releases of mercury from anthropogenic sources under the global climate mitigation regime are reduced in 2050 by 45 % when compared to the case without climate measures. Around one third of co-benefits for mercury emissions estimated world-wide in this study by 2050 are <b>allocated</b> <b>to</b> <b>China.</b> An annual Hg-abatement of about 800 tons is estimated for the coal combustion in power sector if the current air pollution legislation and climate policies are adopted in parallel...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we present}} Structon, a novel {{approach}} that uses Web mining together with inference and IP traceroute to geolocate IP addresses with significantly better accuracy than existing automated approaches. Structon is composed of three ideas which we realize in three corresponding steps. First, we extract geolocation information of Web server IP addresses from Web pages. Second, we devise heuristic algorithms to improve both the accuracy and {{the coverage of the}} IP geolocation database using these Web server IP addresses and their geolocations as input. Third, for those segments that are not covered in the first two steps, we use IP traceroute to identify the access routers of those segments. When the location of the access router is known, we can deduce the location of the associated segment since it is co-located together with the access router. By mining 500 -million Web pages collected in China in 2006 (11 percent of the total Web pages in China at that time), we are able to identify the geolocations for 103 million IP addresses. This represents nearly 88 percent IP addresses <b>allocated</b> <b>to</b> <b>China</b> in March 2008. Structon is 87. 4 percent accurate at city granularity and up to 93. 5 percent accurate at province level. We also used 10 day Windows Live client log to evaluate our client IP addresses coverage: Structon identified geolocations of 98. 9 percent of client IP addresses. I...|$|E
40|$|Globalization and the {{dynamics}} of ecosystem sinks need be considered in post-Kyoto climate negotiations as they increasingly affect the carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere. Currently, the allocation of responsibility for greenhouse gas mitigation is based on territorial emissions from fossil-fuel combustion, process emissions and some land-use emissions. However, at least three additional factors can significantly alter countrys impact on climate from carbon dioxide emissions. First, international trade causes a separation of consumption from production, reducing domestic pollution {{at the expense of}} foreign producers, or vice versa. Second, international transportation emissions are not allocated to countries for the purpose of mitigation. Third, forest growth absorbs carbon dioxide and can contribute to both carbon sequestration and climate change protection. Here we quantify how these three factors change the carbon dioxide emissions <b>allocated</b> <b>to</b> <b>China,</b> Japan, Russia, USA, and European Union member countries. We show that international trade can change the carbon dioxide currently allocated to countries by up to 60 % and that forest expansion can turn some countries into net carbon sinks. These factors are expected to become more dominant as fossil-fuel combustion and process emissions are mitigated and as international trade and forest sinks continue to grow. Emission inventories currently in wide-spread use help to understand the global carbon cycle, but for long-term climate change mitigation {{a deeper understanding of the}} interaction between the carbon cycle and society is needed. Restructuring international trade and investment flows to meet environmental objectives, together with the inclusion of forest sinks, are crucial issues that need consideration in the design of future climate policies. And even these additional issues do not capture the full impact of changes in the carbon cycle on the global climate system...|$|E

40|$|This report {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} the impact of global greenhouse gas policies on traditional air pollutants using the Greenhouse Gas and Air Pollution Interactions and Synergies (GAINS) model in the time horizon up to 2050. The integrated assessment framework of GAINS has been linked through an interface to the POLES global energy system model so that different global energy pathways can be implemented and examined. The impact analysis has been carried out based on projections of energy use data provided by the POLES model for two different climate policy scenarios, i. e., for a current policy Baseline scenario without any global greenhouse gas mitigation efforts, and a 2 -degree Centigrade climate Mitigation scenario which assumes internationally coordinated action to mitigate climate change. Outcomes of the analysis are reported globally and for key world regions: EU- 27, China, India and the US. The assessment takes into account current air pollution control legislation in each country. The results of scenario calculations for SO 2, NOx and PM 2. 5 emissions, air pollution control costs, as well as health and environmental impacts, indicate significant scope for co-benefits made possible through climate policies. Climate mitigation measures appear to be more effective in reducing oxides of sulphur and nitrogen, while emissions of particulate matter are reduced to a smaller extent. Decarbonisation of the global energy system by 2050 results in SO 2 and NOx emissions lower by two-thirds than in the world without GHG-abatement efforts. Corresponding reduction in the emissions of PM 2. 5 is estimated at about 30 % relative to the Baseline and is particularly sensitive to the assumptions on projected biomass combustion. Expenditures on air pollution control under the global climate mitigation regime are reduced in 2050 by 250 billion Euros when compared to the Baseline scenario. Under the GAINS cost assumptions the largest potential for cost savings is reported for the transport sector, followed by savings in the power generation sector. Around one third of financial co-benefits estimated world-wide in this study by 2050 are <b>allocated</b> <b>to</b> <b>China,</b> while an annual cost saving of 35 billion Euros is estimated for the EU member countries if the current air pollution legislation and climate policies are adopted in parallel. This study also quantifies health impacts of air pollution in Europe, China and India in terms of loss of life expectancy related to the exposure from anthropogenic emissions of PM 2. 5, as well as in terms of premature mortality due to ground-level ozone. For example in China, current ambient concentrations of PM 2. 5 are responsible for 38 months-losses in the average life expectancy. In 2050, the global GHG-mitigating strategies reduce this indicator in China by 16 months. In addition, decrease of ozone concentrations in the three regions as estimated for the climate Mitigation scenario in 2050 might save nearly 80, 000 cases of premature death per year. Similarly significant are reductions of impacts on ecosystems due to acidification and eutrophication...|$|E
