50|$|In {{order for}} any {{transformation}} to take place, the microstructure {{of the metal}} must be austenite structure. The exact boundaries of the austenite phase region depend on the chemistry of the alloy being heat treated. However, <b>austenitizing</b> temperatures are typically between 790 and 915°C (1455 to 1680°F). The {{amount of time spent}} at this temperature will vary with the alloy and process specifics for a through-hardened part. The best results are achieved when austenitization is long enough to produce a fully austenitic metal microstructure (there will still be graphite present in cast irons) with a consistent carbon content. In steels this may only take a few minutes after the <b>austenitizing</b> temperature has been reached throughout the part section, but in cast irons it takes longer. This is because carbon must diffuse out of the graphite until it has reached the equilibrium concentration dictated by the temperature and the phase diagram. This step may be done in many types of furnaces, in a high temperature salt bath, via direct flame or induction heating. Numerous patents exist for specific methods and variations.|$|E
50|$|As with {{conventional}} quench and tempering the material being heat treated must be cooled from the <b>austenitizing</b> temperature {{quickly enough to}} avoid the formation of pearlite. The specific cooling rate {{that is necessary to}} avoid the formation of pearlite {{is a product of the}} chemistry of the austenite phase and thus the alloy being processed. The actual cooling rate is a product of both the quench severity, which is influenced by quench media, agitation, load (quenchant ratio, etc.), and the thickness and geometry of the part. As a result, heavier section components required greater hardenability. In austempering the heat treat load is quenched to a temperature which is typically above the Martensite start of the austenite and held. In some patented processes the parts are quenched just below the Martensite start so that the resulting microstructure is a controlled mixture of Martensite and Bainite.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} methods of TiN thin film {{creation}} are {{physical vapor deposition}} (PVD, usually sputter deposition, cathodic arc deposition or electron beam heating) and chemical vapor deposition (CVD). In both methods, pure titanium is sublimed and reacted with nitrogen in a high-energy, vacuum environment. TiN film may also be produced on Ti workpieces by reactive growth (for example, annealing) in a nitrogen atmosphere. PVD is preferred for steel parts because the deposition temperatures exceeds the <b>austenitizing</b> temperature of steel.

The {{results show that the}} major factors influencing the hardness of austempered ductile iron (ADI) are <b>austenitizing</b> temperature and austempering temperature. The fraction of retained austenite increases as the <b>austenitizing</b> and austempering temperatures increase.

Results show that the network morphology of carbides could not dissolve completely and distribute equably {{in the case of}} the <b>austenitizing</b> temperature is 1373 K. When the <b>austenitizing</b> temperature reaches 1473 K, the excessive increase in temperature leads to increase in carbide dissolution, higher dissolved alloying element contents, and unwanted grain growth.

In addition, variations on the microstructure and hardness of the steel are not obvious when holding time ranges from 15 to 30 min with the <b>austenitizing</b> temperature of 1453 K.

40|$|Hot {{forming die}} {{quenching}} (HFDQ) {{is a relatively}} new process in the field of automotive manufacturing. It involves slowly heating Usibor® 1500 P steel (a 22 MnB 5 steel substrate with a protective Al-Si coating) sheets to temperatures exceeding 880 °C, and holding it for a fixed amount of time to ensure the crystallographic structure has become fully austenitic. Once <b>austenitized,</b> the steel is then simultaneously formed and quenched into complex geometries in a single stroke. The quenching stage is critical, allowing for the formation of a hard and strong martensitic crystal structure that would not otherwise be formable at room temperature. These high-strength steel members allow automotive manufacturers to use thinner material cross sections in structural members, thereby reducing the net vehicle weight and improving fuel efficiency without compromising crash performance. Most HFDQ lines use roller hearth furnaces to <b>austenitize</b> ultra high strength steel blanks. While this process is a capable, proven industrial technology, it is limited to relatively inefficient modes of heat transfer, and thus requires long heating times, large furnaces, and considerable energy to maintain temperature. It is the purpose of this work to describe an alternative heating technology in which Usibor® 1500 P coupons are <b>austenitized</b> by bringing them into contact with an electrically-heated monolith. In a laboratory-scale prototype, Usibor® coupons were <b>austenitized</b> in less than 25 seconds; subsequent material characterization and dilatometry investigations confirm that a fully martensitic structure is formed, and that the hardness and yield strength are comparable to furnace-treated samples. Tailoring material properties in HFDQ structural members (body-in-white components) introduces a combination of strong martensitic structures and other softer, more ductile daughter phases such as bainite, ferrite, and pearlite. Most tailoring efforts have focused on controlling the localized quenching rate during the forming stage through selective heating and cooling of the forming dies. This work presents an alternative, based on direct contact heating, in which tailoring is achieved through non-uniform austenitization during the heating stage of HFDQ.
