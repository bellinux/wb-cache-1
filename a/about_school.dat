The Boothe-Dalton and McCue plans were also filed. Backers of the Gray Commission plan filed 14 bills to implement the Commission's proposals, but the Gray plan's supporters said they would abandon their pupil assignment plan {{in favor of the}} Mann-Fenwick pupil assignment plan. Delegate C.W. Cleaton introduced a bill to prohibit school districts from raising private money to operate integrated schools, Senator Eugene Snydor introduced a bill to allow residents to vote on whether integrated schools should be closed and whether closed schools should be reopened as segregated, and Delegate Griffith Purcell introduced a bill to require a statewide referendum in November 1956 on whether school segregation should be state policy.|$|E
5|$|Goblet of Fire was {{the first}} book in the Harry Potter series to be {{released}} in the United States on the same date as the United Kingdom, on 8 July 2000, strategically on a Saturday so children did not have to worry <b>about</b> <b>school</b> conflicting with buying the book. It had a combined first-printing of over five million copies. It was given a record-breaking print run of 3.9 million. Three million copies of the book were sold over the first weekend in the US alone. FedEx dispatched more than 9,000 trucks and 100 planes to fulfill book deliveries. The pressure in editing caused a mistake which shows Harry's father emerging first from Voldemort's wand; however, as confirmed in Prisoner of Azkaban, James died first, so then Harry's mother ought to have come out first. This was corrected in later editions.|$|E

5|$|School Days was 0verflow's tenth game to develop.

A follow-up of the venue was made on October 15.

Thus, according to Ann Hildebrand in The Dreary Time: The Ethos of School in Award-Winning Fiction for Children, Bond's book reinforces the idea that school is an unpleasant necessity that keeps a child from more enjoyable and meaningful activities.|$|E

25|$|In January 1945, the Town of Brunswick Trustees {{created a}} {{committee}} charged with gathering facts <b>about</b> <b>school</b> district centralization and reporting {{back to the}} community. In late 1945, the committee proposed a plan to the New York State Education Department, which was approved. Unfortunately the plan {{was out of the}} scope of a reasonable budget. By late 1950, town residents began commenting on the inadequacies of the then current infrastructure, equipment, and services within their schools. In early 1952, the district superintendent created a committee made up of one member from each school district to reevaluate centralization. By July 1953, the committee was formed and a chairman elected. That August, committee members met with members of the Education Department to discuss school programs and expected expenditures. It is estimated that an average teacher's salary would be $3,750 in 1956. In March 1954, the Centralization Committee produced a pamphlet entitled Digest of Facts to inform the community of the project. In April 1954, a citizens' advisory committee was created, made up of 48 individuals, representing all districts involved in centralization. By August, the committee produced A Partnership in Education pamphlet to be distributed in the area. On October 8, 1956, the citizens' committee voted to centralize and the first Board of Education was elected.|$|E
500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Great Depression, John Brown lost his job and relocated the family to Palmer's Crossing, [...] from Hattiesburg, where he worked at a turpentine factory until he was laid off in 1938. John Brown then moved the family to Lux, Mississippi, {{to be a part of}} a sharecropper farm. During this time, Jesse Brown shared a bed with his brothers and attended a one-room school [...] away. His parents were very strict <b>about</b> <b>school</b> attendance and homework, and Jesse Brown walked to school every day. The Browns also were committed Baptists and Jesse, William, and Julia Brown sang in the church choir. In his spare time, Brown also worked in the fields of the farm harvesting corn and cotton.|$|E
500|$|Wodehouse {{expected}} to follow Armine to the University of Oxford, but the family's finances took {{a turn for the}} worse at the crucial moment. Ernest Wodehouse had retired in 1895, and his pension was paid in rupees; fluctuation against the pound reduced its value in Britain. Wodehouse recalled, [...] "The wolf was not actually whining at the door and there was always a little something in the kitty for the butcher and the grocer, but the finances would not run to anything in the nature of a splash". Instead of a university career, in September 1900 Wodehouse was engaged in a junior position in the London office of the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank. He was unsuited to it and found the work baffling and uncongenial. He later wrote a humorous account of his experiences at the bank, but at the time he longed for the end of each working day, when he could return to his rented lodgings in Chelsea and write. At first he concentrated, with some success, on serious articles <b>about</b> <b>school</b> sports for Public School Magazine. In November 1900 his first comic piece, [...] "Men Who Missed Their Own Weddings," [...] was accepted by Tit-Bits. A new magazine for boys, The Captain, provided further well-paid opportunities, and during his two years at the bank, Wodehouse had eighty pieces published in a total of nine magazines.|$|E

500|$|In a biographical sketch {{written in}} 2004, the {{historian}} Jeffrey Richards characterises Reed's {{work as a}} mixing of the earlier school story traditions established by Dean Farrar and Thomas Hughes, crafted with a vivid readability. Reed dismissed Farrar's Eric, or, Little by Little as a religious tract thinly disguised as a school story, and sought to produce something more [...] "manly". Many of the incidents and characterisations introduced by Reed in St. Dominic's became standard elements in his subsequent stories, and in those of his imitators. Quigly lists among other recurrent features the stolen exam paper, the innocent who is wrongly accused and ultimately justified after much proud suffering, the boating accident, the group rivalries, the noble friendships. Adult characters are largely stereotypes: a headmaster known as [...] "the Doctor" [...] and modelled on Thomas Arnold of Rugby, [...] "the jabbering French master (pointed beard and two-tone shoes)", the popular games master, the dry pedant, the generally comic domestic staff. Reed established a tradition in which the fictional boarding school was peopled by such characters and was almost invariably represented in terms of [...] "dark passages, iron bedsteads, scratched desks, chill dormitories and cosy, shabby studies". Quigly suggests that {{one reason for the}} success of Reed's stories and their long-lasting appeal is that they are not so much books <b>about</b> <b>school</b> as books about people. John Sime of the RTS, in a memorial tribute to Reed after his death, notes that the boys in the stories are recognisably of flesh and blood, with [...] "just that spice of wickedness... without which a boy is not a boy".|$|E
