40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the role of {{intangible}} services regarding the risk of technological lock-in. It is based on the case of <b>advisory</b> <b>services</b> for farmers. Collective learning procedures are often considered by evolutionary economists as effective tools for policy makers. For instance, public investments in agricultural <b>advisory</b> <b>services</b> could support farmers into shifting towards more environmental friendly practices. Nevertheless, this hypothesis relies on an ideal conception of <b>advisory</b> <b>services,</b> focused mainly on their contribution to learning procedures. Using some conceptual tools of the service economics enables to show that <b>advisory</b> <b>services</b> can be themselves locked-in, due to their insertion in institutionalised balances of power. For instance, some Public-Private Partnerships with the upstream industry can reduce the contribution of the back-office investments of <b>advisory</b> <b>services</b> suppliers dedicated to the validation of knowledge about the relative performances of competing technologies...|$|R
