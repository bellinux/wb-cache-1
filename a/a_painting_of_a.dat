(sometimes I Can See the Whole Room and There's Nobody in It! {{or simply}} I Can See the Whole Room!) is a 1961 {{painting}} by Roy Lichtenstein. It is <b>a</b> <b>painting</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> man {{looking through a}} peephole. It formerly held the record for highest auction price for a Lichtenstein painting.|$|E
5|$|Kneale's {{younger brother}} is the renowned artist and {{sculptor}} Bryan Kneale, who was Master and then Professor of Sculpture at the Royal Academy from 1982 to 1990. Bryan Kneale painted the covers for the Quatermass script books released by Penguin Books in 1959 and 1960. He was {{also responsible for}} <b>a</b> <b>painting</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> lobster from which special effects designers Bernard Wilkie and Jack Kine drew their inspiration for the Martian creatures they constructed for the original television version of Quatermass and the Pit.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo's {{early life}} {{has been the subject}} of {{historical}} conjecture. Vasari, the 16th-century biographer of Renaissance painters, tells a story of Leonardo as a very young man: A local peasant made himself a round shield and requested that Ser Piero have it painted for him. Leonardo responded with <b>a</b> <b>painting</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> monster spitting fire that was so terrifying that Ser Piero sold it to a Florentine art dealer, who sold it to the Duke of Milan. Meanwhile, having made a profit, Ser Piero bought a shield decorated with a heart pierced by an arrow, which he gave to the peasant.|$|E

5|$|Many {{pictures}} {{depict the}} countryside at Wiedensahl and Lüthorst. They include pollarded willows, cottages in cornfields, cowherds, autumn landscapes and meadows with streams. A particular {{feature is the}} use of red jackets, found in about 280 of 1000 Busch paintings and drawings. The muted or bright red coats are worn usually by a small figure, depicted from behind. The paintings generally represent typical villages. Portraits of the Kesslers, and a series of other portraits depicting Lina Weissenborn in the mid-1870s, are exceptions. <b>A</b> <b>painting</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 10-year-old girl from a Jewish family at Lüthorst portrays her as serious, and having dark, oriental features.|$|E
5|$|The {{cover of}} Dylan's album Self Portrait (1970) is a {{reproduction}} of <b>a</b> <b>painting</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> face by Dylan. Another of his paintings is reproduced {{on the cover of}} the 1974 album Planet Waves. In 1994 Random House published Drawn Blank, a book of Dylan's drawings. In 2007, the first public exhibition of Dylan's paintings, The Drawn Blank Series, opened at the Kunstsammlungen in Chemnitz, Germany; it showcased more than 200 watercolors and gouaches made from the original drawings. The exhibition coincided with the publication of Bob Dylan: The Drawn Blank Series, which includes 170 reproductions from the series. From September 2010 until April 2011, the National Gallery of Denmark exhibited 40 large-scale acrylic paintings by Dylan, The Brazil Series.|$|E
5|$|The {{penalty of}} the sack, {{with the animals}} included, {{experienced}} a revival in parts of late medieval, and early modern Germany (particularly in Saxony). The 14th century commentator on the 13th century compilation of laws/customs Sachsenspiegel, Johann von Buch, for example, states that the poena cullei is the appropriate punishment for parricides. Some differences evolved within the German ritual, relative to the original Roman ritual, though. Apparently, the rooster was not included, and the serpent might be replaced with <b>a</b> <b>painting</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> serpent {{on a piece of}} paper and the monkey could be replaced with a cat. Furthermore, the cat and the dog were sometimes physically separated from the person, and the sack itself (with its two partitions) was made of linen, rather than of leather.|$|E

5|$|On October 17, 2010, Kanye West {{revealed}} through Twitter that My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy {{had been}} rejected by certain stores because of the cover art. The artwork (a portrait by George Condo) shows West being straddled by an armless winged female (a phoenix). Both characters are depicted nude, and one nipple of the phoenix's breasts and her buttocks are visible. The artist later said that Kanye wanted a cover image that would be banned. The painting is centered with a thin yellow border on a red background. The artwork follows along the apparent theme of the album, as well as West's music film Runaway. This {{is one of five}} covers; all of them were included with its purchase. A second cover, with <b>a</b> <b>painting</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> ballerina by Condo, was posted on the Amazon.com pre-order page. It was intended to be the original artwork for Runaway, but West used a photograph of a ballerina instead.|$|E
5|$|Burne-Jones {{was elected}} an Associate of the Royal Academy in 1885, and the {{following}} year he exhibited (for the only time) at the Academy, showing The Depths of the Sea, <b>a</b> <b>painting</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mermaid carrying down with her a youth whom she has unconsciously drowned in the impetuosity of her love. This picture adds to the habitual haunting charm a tragic irony of conception and a felicity of execution which give it a place apart among Burne-Jones's works. He formally resigned his Associateship in 1893. One of the Perseus series was exhibited in 1887, two more in 1888, with The Brazen Tower, inspired by the same legend. In 1890 the second series of The Legend of Briar Rose were exhibited by themselves, and won the widest admiration. The huge watercolor, The Star of Bethlehem, painted for the corporation of Birmingham, was exhibited in 1891. A long illness for some time checked the painter's activity, which, when resumed, was much occupied with decorative schemes. An exhibition of his work {{was held at the}} New Gallery in the winter of 1892-1893. To this period belong several of his comparatively few portraits. In 1894 Burne-Jones was made a baronet. Ill-health again interrupted the progress of his works, chief among which was the vast Arthur in Avalon. In the winter following his death a second exhibition of his works was held at the New Gallery, and an exhibition of his drawings (including some of the charmingly humorous sketches made for children) at the Burlington Fine Arts Club.|$|E
25|$|In 1997 the {{painting}} of the Bananas in Pyjamas television characters by Evert Ploeg was deemed ineligible by the trustees {{because it was not}} <b>a</b> <b>painting</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> person.

25|$|She {{exhibited}} at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and in 1908 and 1912 was awarded the Mary Smith Prize. The 1908 prize was won for Roller Skates and the 1912 prize was won for <b>a</b> <b>painting</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> flower shop in Paris entitled In the Spring, noted for its radiant colors.

25|$|In November 2010, <b>a</b> <b>painting</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> nude by Amedeo Modigliani, part of {{a series}} of nudes he created around 1917, sold for more than $68.9m (£42.7m) at an auction in New York—a record for the artist's work. Bidding for La Belle Romaine pushed its price well past its $40m (£24.8m) estimate. Modigliani's {{previous}} auction record was 43.2m euros (£35.8m), set earlier in 2010 in Paris. Another painting by the artist—Jeanne Hébuterne (au chapeau), one of the first portraits he painted of his lover—sold for $19.1m (£11.8m), much higher than its pre-sale estimate of $9–12m (£5.6–7.4m).|$|E

25|$|The {{painting}} in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, called A Visit to the Nursery, dated 1661, may depict the family Hinlopen. According to Walter Liedtke there is some general resemblance. The scene is set in an imaginary room. The chimney resembles {{the one in the}} former Amsterdam townhall, also painted by Pieter de Hooch. A guest is greeted by the new mother and her hat-doffing husband. There is a seascape, <b>a</b> <b>painting</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> brawny fisherman on the wall and Persian carpets on the table and the floor. The dog in the painting could be a Bolognese.|$|E
25|$|Tom Yorkfield, a farmer, {{receives}} {{a visit from}} his half-brother Laurence. Tom has no great liking for Laurence or respect for his profession as a painter of animals. Tom shows Laurence his prize bull and expects him to be impressed, but Laurence nonchalantly tells Tom that he has sold <b>a</b> <b>painting</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> different bull, which Tom has seen and does not like, for three hundred pounds. Tom is angry that a mere picture of a bull should be worth more than his real bull. This and Laurence's condescending attitude give him the urge to strike him. Laurence, running away across the field, is attacked by the bull, but is saved by Tom from serious injury. Tom, looking after Laurence as he recovers, feels no more rancour because he knows that, however valuable Laurence's painting might be, only a real bull like his can attack someone.|$|E
25|$|The ancient Greek and Roman {{doors were}} either single doors, double doors, triple doors, sliding doors or folding doors, {{in the last}} case the leaves were hinged and folded back. In Eumachia, is <b>a</b> <b>painting</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> door with three leaves. In the tomb of Theron at Agrigentum {{there is a single}} four-panel door carved in stone. In the Blundell {{collection}} is a bas-relief of a temple with double doors, each leaf with five panels. Among existing examples, the bronze doors in the church of SS. Cosmas and Damiano, in Rome, are important examples of Roman metal work of the best period; they are in two leaves, each with two panels, and are framed in bronze. Those of the Pantheon are similar in design, with narrow horizontal panels in addition, at the top, bottom and middle. Two other bronze doors of the Roman period are in the Lateran Basilica.|$|E

25|$|Man with a Pipe is an oil {{painting}} on canvas with dimensions 93.7 × 65.4cm (36.5 by 25.75 inches), signed JMetzinger lower right. The work represents a man {{sitting at a}} table upon which is placed a mug of beer. The man, an American according to the title of the work, has his arms crossed and has a pipe in his mouth. He wears a jacket and tie. To the right is a vase with <b>a</b> <b>painting</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sail boat in front of a setting sun above. To the sitters left can be seen half of a portrait in a round frame. While the Man with a Pipe is treated in an extreme form of Cubism, the two works hanging on the wall behind the sitter are not Cubist at all, albeit, they are stylized. One represents a boat with a setting or rising sun, the other, a portrait placed in a semi-circle, almost an echo of the Man with a Pipe.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, {{at another}} auction at Christie's, Ulrich sold a 1982 Basquiat piece, Untitled (Boxer), for US $13,522,500 to an {{anonymous}} telephone bidder. Another record {{price for a}} Basquiat painting was made in 2007, when an untitled Basquiat work from 1981 sold at Sotheby's in New York for US$14.6 million. In 2012, {{for the second year}} running, Basquiat was the most coveted contemporary (i.e. born after 1945) artist at auction, with €80million in overall sales. That year, his Untitled (1981), <b>a</b> <b>painting</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> haloed, black-headed man with a bright red skeletal body, depicted amid the artist's signature scrawls, was sold by Robert Lehrman for $16.3million, well above its $12 million high estimate. A similar untitled piece, also undertaken in 1981 and formerly owned by the Israel Museum, sold for £12.92 million at Christie's London, setting a world auction record for Basquiat's work. In 2013, Basquiat's piece Dustheads sold for $48.8 million at Christie's. In 2016 an untitled piece sold at Christie's for $57.3 million to a Japanese businessman and collector, Yusaku Maezawa.|$|E
