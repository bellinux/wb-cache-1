40|$|Purpose: In multi-slice CT, {{manufacturers}} have implemented automatic tube current modulation (TCM) algorithms. These <b>adjust</b> <b>tube</b> current in the x-y plane (angular modulation) and/or along the z-axis (z-axis modulation) {{according to the}} size and attenuation of the scanned body part. Current methods for estimating effective dose (ED) values in CT do not account for such new developments. This study investigated {{the need to take}} TCM into account when calculating ED values, using clinical data. Methods: The effect of TCM algorithms as implemented on a GE BrightSpeed 16, a Philips Brilliance 64 and a Siemens Sensation 64 CT scanners was investigated. Here, only z-axis modulation was addressed, considering thorax and abdomen CT examinations collected from 534 adult patients. Commercially available CT dosimetry software (CT expo v. 1. 7) was used to compute EDTCM (ED accounting for TCM) as the sum of ED of successive slices. A two-step approach was chosen: first we estimated the relative contribution of each slice assuming a constant tube current. Next a weighted average was taken based upon the slice specific tube current value. EDTCM was than compared to patient ED estimated using average mA of all slices.

All patients were followed up at least for 24 months. Success rate of lacrimal bypass was analyzed and complications were recorded. A total of 174 patients were finally included. Duration of surgery ranged from 28 to 47 minutes (mean 37. 2  ±  4. 2 minutes). The mean duration of follow-up was 30. 0  ±  6. 4 months (range 24 - 48 months). The mean tube length was 23. 2  ±  1. 9  mm (range 20 - 28  mm). At the final review, complete success was achieved in 138 (79. 3 %) patients. Moderate success was achieved in 23 (13. 2 %) patients, and 13 (7. 5 %) patients failed. Of the 161 patients successfully treated, 24 patients underwent revision surgery to excise granulomas (15 patients) or <b>adjust</b> <b>tube</b> position (9 patients). The complications included granuloma proliferation around the openings of the tube (28 eyes), downward displacement of the tube (17 eyes), and ocular discomfort (15 eyes).

40|$|SUMMARY: To {{determine}} how much the radiation dose can be reduced in multidetector row CTA using a QDS, we performed CTA at various exposure settings using a vascular phantom simulating various aneurysms with superimposed bone skull structures, and postprocessed the image data with QDS. Our results demonstrated that the radiation dose of CTA can be reduced by at least 25 % and the image quality for visualizing aneurysms can be preserved by applying the QDS. ABBREVIATIONS: CNR contrast-to-noise ratio; CTA CT angiography; CTDIw weighted CT dose index; MTF modulation transfer function; Q 04 mild QDS; Q 06 heavy sharpening QDS; Q 08 heavy smoothing QDS; QDS quantum denoising system; ROI region of interest; W weight of blending the smoothed image and the sharpened image Although CTA is an efficient noninvasive imaging methodfor the evaluation of intracranial aneurysms, there is a trend toward using an increased radiation dose with multide-tector row CT {{in comparison with the}} dose used for single-detector row CT. Many investigators recommend low-tube-voltage scanning with properly <b>adjusted</b> <b>tube</b> current for reducing the radiation dose during cerebral CT because a pho-toelectric effect in x-ray attenuation increases at lower tube voltages. 1 On the other hand, reducing the radiation dose causes an increase in the image noise content. Currently, sev-eral previous studies have reported that the edge-preserving adaptive filter decreases qualitative and quantitative noise in low-dose CT images. 2 However, the effect of this filter on the lesion conspicuity of cerebral CTA has not been investigated. Recently, a new edge-preserving adaptive filter known as the QDS (Toshiba Medical Systems, Tokyo, Japan) has been de-veloped, which can selectively eliminate the noise without af-fecting the resolution in low-dose scanning.

The Seditainer method was particularly easy to use, showed acceptable precision, reduced the biohazard risk to laboratory staff and, on storage of sealed blood specimens for 24 hours at 4 degrees C, gave ESR values that had decreased by a mean of only 1. 9 % (95 % CI + 0. 2 to - 4. 0 %). Seditainer tubes are shorter (100 mm) than Westergren tubes (200 mm) and this reduced test sensitivity at ESR values above 55 mm/first hour.

40|$|Epithelial {{tubes in}} {{developing}} organs, such as mammalian lungs and insect tracheae, {{need to expand}} their initially narrow lumina to attain their final, functional dimensions [1]. Despite its critical role for organ function, the cellular mechanism of tube expansion remains unclear.

We identify mutations in the sec 24 gene stenosis, encoding a cargo-binding subunit of the COPII complex [6, 7, 8].

Strikingly, single cells autonomously <b>adjust</b> both <b>tube</b> diameter and length by implementing a sequence of events including apical membrane growth, cell flattening, and taenidial cuticle formation. Known luminal components are not required for this process. Thus, a cell-intrinsic program, rather than nonautonomous extrinsic cues, controls the dimensions of tracheal tubes. These results indicate a critical role of membrane-associated proteins in the process and imply a mechanism that coordinates autonomous behaviors of individual cells within epithelial structures...|$|R

30|$|There was a {{distinct}} {{lack of consensus}} amongst both groups {{regarding the use of}} ATCM in the presence of metallic implants, with more than half of CSRs and three quarters of radiologists surveyed believing that ATCM should not be used in such instances. As such software operates by measuring the patient attenuation and <b>adjusting</b> the <b>tube</b> current accordingly, theoretically the increased attenuation caused by implants or prostheses could result in dramatic increases in tube current and consequently patient doses. This may also occur despite the fact that increasing the tube current has little if any effect on the beam hardening and streak artefacts created by such metal and merely contributes to additional patient dose [29]. However, studies have shown that while the tube current may increase over the region of the implant, overall ATCM still provides a net reduction in tube current when compared with fixed tube current settings [30]. Also, more recent versions of ATCM software can recognise the presence of such implants during the initial scanogram and disregard the increased attenuation from the tube current calculation [31], thus avoiding unnecessary increases altogether. However, the results here would indicate that patients may not be fully benefitting from ATCM technology, emphasising the importance of CT users keeping abreast of developments in the modality to ensure doses are optimised. This is especially important given the continued development in the area with tube potential modulation [32] now being offered by some manufacturers.|$|R

The <b>tube</b> current is <b>adjusted</b> according to the patient’s size and attenuation along the z-axis (longitudinal tube current modulation) and also during the rotation in the xy-axis (angular tube current modulation) depending on the patient attenuation [1]. The user chooses a desired image quality directly (Philips, Siemens, Toshiba) or determines a desired noise level (GE, Toshiba). The automatic exposure control (AEC) of the CT then <b>adjusts</b> the necessary <b>tube</b> current. The scout view gives an indication of the patient attenuation and, while planning the examination on the scout view, the system is able to calculate the patient dose for the diagnostic scan. The system indicates the CTDIvol (CT dose index per volume) and the DLP (dose length product) prior to the exam. These are generic markers of the incurred dose and indicate the physical radiation dose to the patient. The conversion into an effective dose, simplified the biological impact, is not straightforward and depends on the age, anatomy and sex of the patient. The younger the patient the more radiosensitive, and tissues with high metabolic and proliferative activity are more radiosensitive than those with low activity. Glandular and gonadal tissue and red marrow are highly radiosensitive, leading to a relatively high effective dose for radiation to the neck and trunk, while extremities are less radiosensitive resulting in low effective doses [2 – 6].|$|R
6000|$|Donkin prowled spiteful {{and alone}} amongst the shadows, {{thinking}} that Jimmy too long delayed to die. That evening land {{had been reported}} from aloft, and the master, while <b>adjusting</b> the <b>tubes</b> of the long glass, had observed with quiet bitterness to Mr. Baker that, after fighting our way inch by inch to the Western Islands, {{there was nothing to}} expect now but a spell of calm. The sky was clear and the barometer high. The light breeze dropped with the sun, and an enormous stillness, forerunner of a night without wind, descended upon the heated waters of the ocean. As long as daylight lasted, the hands collected on the forecastle-head watched on the eastern sky the island of Flores, that rose above the level expanse of the sea with irregular and broken outlines like a sombre ruin upon a vast and deserted plain. It was the first land seen for nearly four months. Charley was excited, {{and in the midst of}} general indulgence took liberties with his betters. Men strangely elated without knowing why, talked in groups, and pointed with bared arms. For the first time that voyage Jimmy's sham existence seemed for a moment forgotten in the face of a solid reality. We had got so far anyhow. Belfast discoursed, quoting imaginary examples of short homeward runs from the Islands. [...] "Them smart fruit schooners do it in five days," [...] he affirmed. [...] "What do you want?--only a good little breeze." [...] Archie maintained that seven days was the record passage, and they disputed amicably with insulting words. Knowles declared he could already smell home from there, and with a heavy list on his short leg laughed fit to split his sides. A group of grizzled sea-dogs looked out for a time in silence and with grim absorbed faces. One said suddenly--"'Tain't far to London now."--"My first night ashore, blamme if I haven't steak and onions for supper... and a pint of bitter," [...] said another.--"A barrel ye mean," [...] shouted someone.--"Ham an' eggs three times a day. That's the way I live!" [...] cried an excited voice. There was a stir, appreciative murmurs; eyes began to shine; jaws champed; short, nervous laughs were heard. Archie smiled with reserve all to himself. Singleton came up, gave a careless glance, and went down again without saying a word, indifferent, like a man who had seen Flores an incalculable number of times. The night travelling from the East blotted out of the limpid sky the purple stain of the high land. [...] "Dead calm," [...] said somebody quietly. The murmur of lively talk suddenly wavered, died out; the clusters broke up; men began to drift away one by one, descending the ladders slowly and with serious faces as if sobered by that reminder of their dependence upon the invisible. And when the big yellow moon ascended gently above the sharp rim of the clear horizon it found the ship wrapped up in a breathless silence; a fearless ship that seemed to sleep profoundly, dreamlessly on the bosom of the sleeping and terrible sea.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to optimize x-ray image quality to dose ratios in the cardiac catheterization laboratory. This study examined independently the effects of peak x-ray tube voltage (kVp), copper (Cu), and gadolinium (Gd) x-ray beam filtration on the image quality to radiation dose balance for adult patient sizes. Methods: Image sequences of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) phantoms representing two adult patient sizes were captured using a modern flat panel detector based x-ray imaging system. Tin and copper test details were used to simulate iodine-based contrast medium and stents∕guide wires respectively, which are used in clinical procedures. Noise measurement for a flat field image and test detail contrast were used to calculate the contrast to noise ratio (CNR). Entrance surface dose (ESD) and effective dose measurements were obtained to calculate the figure of merit (FOM), CNR(2) ∕dose. This FOM determined the dose efficiency of x-ray spectra investigated. Images were captured with 0. 0, 0. 1, 0. 25, 0. 4, and 0. 9 mm Cu filtration and with a range of gadolinium oxysulphide (Gd 2 O 2 S) filtration. Results: Optimum x-ray spectra were the same for the tin and copper test details. Lower peak tube voltages were generally favored. For the 20 cm phantom, using 2 Lanex Fast Back Gd 2 O 2 S screens as x-ray filtration at 65 kVp provided the highest FOM considering ESD and effective dose. Considering ESD, this FOM was only marginally larger than that from using 0. 4 mm Cu at 65 kVp. For the 30 cm phantom, using 0. 25 mm copper filtration at 80 kVp was most optimal; considering effective dose the FOM was highest with no filtration at 65 kVp. Conclusions: These settings, <b>adjusted</b> for x-ray <b>tube</b> loading limits and clinically acceptable image quality, should provide a useful option for optimizing patient dose to image quality in cardiac x-ray imaging. The same optimal x-ray beam spectra were found for both the tin and copper details, suggesting that iodine contrast based imaging and visualization of interventional devices could potentially be optimized for dose using similar x-ray beam spectra...|$|R
