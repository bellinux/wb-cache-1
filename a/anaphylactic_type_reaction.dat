40|$|Summary. -Tissue {{histamine}} {{levels were}} studied in C 3 H and C 57 BL/ 6 mice bearing a methylcholanthrene-induced fibrosarcoma, in Wag rats bearing an aflatoxin B,-induced hepatoma, and in Commentry rats bearing a grafted hepatoma. Histamine levels {{were significantly higher}} (1 - 5 to 3 fold) in the tumour-bearing animals for ventral and dorsal skin, skeletal muscle and stomach fundus. Total histamine content was increased in the spleen. In C 3 H mice with McC 3 - 1 fibrosarcoma, the excision of the tumour or its partial regression by intratumoral injections of Corynebacterium parvum induced a reversion to normal values. The tumour thus appears responsible for the increased histamine levels in tissues distant from the tumour.

In patients with severe aplastic anemia (SAA) more than one invasive mycotic infection should be considered and early diagnosis with adequate treatment is crucial. We present a patient with treatment resistant SAA who developed zygomycosis while under caspofungin + voriconazole combined antifungal therapy for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. A 13. 5 year old boy with SAA developed invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Liposomal amphotericin B (L-AmB) was started, but he developed an <b>anaphylactic</b> <b>type</b> hypersensitivity <b>reaction</b> with L-AmB. Therefore treatment was changed to voriconazole treatment, and at the 3 rd month of this treatment, caspofungin was added as a salvage therapy. However, he did no respond to immunosuppressive treatment for SAA. No clinical or laboratory improvement of invasive fungal infection was seen in spite of antifungal therapy.

40|$|Allergy in {{tuberculosis}} is of a dual nature, in that <b>anaphylactic</b> <b>type</b> response {{occurs as}} well as the characteristic tuberculin reaction (1, 2). Enders (3) found that anaphylactic reactions appeared to be in response to a polysaccharide antigen. A large body of evidence, summarized by Drea and Andrejew (4), has indicated that delayed <b>type</b> tuberculin <b>reaction</b> is produced by a protein material. A similar duality has been noted in the antibody response. A sensitive system for the measurement of antibody to bacterial polysaccharides was described by Keogh and his colleagues (5). They effected the adsorption, onto normal red blood ceils, of polysaccharide from strains of Hemopkilus influensae and other bacteria. These sensitized cells were agglutinated by corresponding antisera. This technique has been applied to the study of tuberculosis by Middlebrook and Dubos (6), who employed an extract from tubercle bacilli as a sensitizing agent, and demonstrated that tuberculopolysaccharide could inhibit the hemagglutination more effectively than could tuberculoprotein. Middlebrook later obtained a highly purified polysaccharide which effects sensitization of erythrocytes (7) ...|$|R
40|$|Diseases, {{which are}} the result of immune {{reactions}} associated with tissue damage may be caused by several mechanisms. The immunologic mechanisms resulting in tissue damage have been categorized in 4 types (Gell and Coombs, 1968). 1. the <b>anaphylactic</b> <b>type,</b> mediated by IgE type of antibodies, resulting in immediate release of vasoactive arnines (e. g. histamine). 2. the cytotoxic type, mediated by IgG and IgM type of antibodies and resulting in phagocytosis of the target cells or lysis by complement activation. 3. the immune complex type, with either primary localisation of the immune complexes in the tissues (Arthus reaction) or circulating immune complexes with secondary tissue localisation. 4. the delayed type or cellular immune response mediated by thymus derived T-lymphocytes. In the studies to be reported, only diseases caused by the <b>type</b> 3 <b>reaction,</b> mediated by circulating immune complexes, are of concern.

This furnishes strong evidence for the formation of antigenic conjugates following application of substances of simple chemical constitution. Since the anaphylactic state is induced by the same method of administration that gives rise to cutaneous sensitivity, the assumption would appear justified, when one takes into account the chemical properties of the inciting substances, that the formation of conjugated antigens offers an explanation for the skin effects also. In the experiments with picryl chloride, anaphylactic antibodies, and occasionally precipitins, have been demonstrated.

The dissociation, in certain instances, between circulating antibody and dermal reactivity was noteworthy. From the results the following conclusions were drawn. 1. Intradermal injection of a soluble streptococcal protein into a rabbit immunized intravenously with that protein leads to the immediate <b>anaphylactic</b> <b>type</b> of skin response; while similar dermal testing of a rabbit sensitized by intracutaneous inoculation of the intact microorganism induces the delayed (tuberculin) type of response. 2. The induction of the immediate <b>type</b> of dermal <b>reaction</b> to streptococcal protein requires more than the mere presence of a high serum precipitin titer to that protein. 3. Lesions of the immediate type can be induced by the intradermal injection of a streptococcal carbohydrate into rabbits immunized intravenously with intact cocci and showing a high serum precipitin titer to that carbohydrate. 4. Intravenous immunization of rabbits with an emulsion of mechanically ground indifferent streptococci leads to the production of only non-type-specific antibodies. 5.

The frequency of anaphylactic allergic reactions to cephalosporins is 0. 2 % to 17 %, and depends on cephalosporins generation.

However, the role of IgE-mediated reactions in RAO remains unclear. The aim {{of the study was}} to investigate with a serological IgE ELISA test (Allercept), an in vitro sulfidoleukotriene (sLT) release assay (CAST) and with intradermal testing (IDT) whether serum IgE and IgE-mediated reactions against various mould, mite and pollen extracts are associated with RAO.

In the serological test, overall the control horses displayed more positive reactions than the RAO-affected horses but the difference was not significant. Comparison of the measured IgE levels showed that the RAO-affected horses had slightly higher IgE levels against Aspergillus fumigatus than controls (35 and 16 AU, respectively, p< 0. 05), but all values were below the cut off (150 AU) of the test. In the sLT release assay, seven positive reactions were observed in the RAO-affected horses and four in the controls but this difference was not significant. A significantly higher proportion of late <b>type</b> IDT <b>reactions</b> was observed in RAO-affected horses compared to controls (25 of 238 possible reactions versus 12 of 238 possible reactions, respectively, p< 0. 05).
