30|$|Since neither π _t nor ω {{are common}} knowledge, {{decisions}} are conditioned on {{beliefs about the}} share of discriminators amongst principals, which are updated through observations of discrimination in the market. We assume that the event which creates a taste for discrimination results in a common initial prior among individuals <b>and</b> <b>principals.</b> 6 The common prior, denoted by η _ 0, is modeled as having a Beta distribution, with parameters α _ 0 and β _ 0 and denoted η _ 0 =B(α _ 0, β _ 0). Moreover, we denote {{the density of the}} distribution η _ 0 by θ. The Beta distribution gives us a density on [0,  1], which captures the beliefs held by individuals <b>and</b> <b>principals</b> regarding η _ 0. As individuals <b>and</b> <b>principals</b> need to decide on optimal actions based on their beliefs, and all individuals <b>and</b> <b>principals</b> are assumed to be risk neutral, individuals <b>and</b> <b>principals</b> use the expected value of the Beta distribution which is given by E(η _ 0)=α _ 0 /α _ 0 +β _ 0.7 For the sake of simplicity, we can assume that the initial prior is correct, i.e. E(η _ 0) = π _ 0.|$|R
