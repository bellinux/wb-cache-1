40|$|Average {{travelling}} speed usually {{applied in the}} traffic analysis as required in the fundamental traffic model. As one type of speed under the space-mean speed, most of the researchers have derived the equation to estimate the space-mean speed. There are a few factors that influence the speed changes along the segment. The fluctuate speed along the segment give an idea to average the spot mean speed from at least two points in order to estimate the space-mean speed. This paper explores an alternative method on how to convert the time-mean speed to space-mean speed that can represent the actual operating speed along segment using the average technique. A total of 18 data sets of time-mean speed and space-mean speed in six segments of uninterrupted two-lane single carriageway road were collected using <b>automatic</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>counter</b> and moving car observer, respectively. Two sets of <b>automatic</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>counter</b> were installed along the segment to record the spot speed and then converted to the time-mean speed, while the moving car observer were conducted concurrently to get the space-mean speed. The data sets were analysed using linear regression analysis. The results of summary of model show a strong relationship with coefficient of determination, R 2 = 0. 808, while ANOVA test results show the coefficient of constant and time-mean speed is not zero with p-value is less than 0. 05 at confident level of 95 %.

40|$|The basic {{function}} of all roads in a highway system is effective mobility. Various categories of roads have various purposes: distant and close connecting, gathering and accessibility. But {{they all have}} one aim in common: to enable all users {{to get to the}} final destination within the shortest possible time. Travel time depends on travel speed and different travel speeds are expected on different roads. The aim of this research project is to create for the purpose of traffic modeling process functions of impedance which are fundamental for the calculation of the average link travel speed and travel time. The {{basic function}} of impedance is a volume-delay BPR function which is used for calculation of travel times and delays. Besides BPR function it will be dealt with Spiess function, which was introduced in 1990.

40|$|In Hong Kong, {{the annual}} traffic census report is {{published}} {{in the middle of}} the year and used to present the results of traffic volume recorded at the <b>automatic</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>counter</b> stations. The type of traffic volume data being widely used is the annual average daily traffic (AADT), which is estimated on the basis of the daily flows by 12 months in the whole surveyed year. In this paper, time series, neural network, nonparametric regression, and Gaussian maximum likelihood (GML) methods were adapted to develop four models for short-term prediction of the daily traffic flows by day of week and by month, as well as the AADT for the whole current year. The historical data (1994 - 1998) and available current-year data for 1999 partial daily flows are the input data used for model development. The results of the four models were compared with the real data for validation. The daily flows estimated by the four models were used to calculate the AADT for the current year of 1999. Based on the comparison results, the GML model appears to be the most promising and robust of these four models for extensive applications to provide the short-term traffic forecasting database for the whole territory of Hong Kong.

Adverse weather often leads to decreases in traffic speed and subsequently affects the service levels. The paper is aimed at investigating the impact of rainfall on travel speed and quantifying the extent to which travel speed reduction occurs. Empirical studies were conducted on principle road in Terengganu and Johor, respectively for three months. Traffic data were collected by way of <b>automatic</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>counter</b> and rainfall data from the nearest raingauge station were supplied by the Department of Irrigation and Drainage supplemented by local survey data. These data were filtered to obtain traffic flow information for both dry and wet operating conditions and then were analyzed to see the effect of rainfall on percentile speeds. The results indicated that travel speed at 15 th, 50 th and 85 th percentiles decrease with increasing rainfall intensities. It was observed that all percentile speeds decreased from a minimum of 1 % during light rain to a maximum of 14 % during heavy rain. Based on the hypothesis that travel speed differ significantly between dry and rainfall condition; the study found substantial changes in percentile speeds and concluded that rainfalls irrespective of their intensities have significant impact on the travel speed...|$|E

In Malaysia, it is generally constructed at federal multilane highway. Introducing of roadway facilities such as midblock U-turn along the highway segment will give the benefits {{and at the same}} time give the risk to the road user. U-turning movements at the midblock U-turn facilities can cause the road safety problem due to the vehicle movement in order to make a U-turn. The aim of study is to determine the extent of road capacity shift resulting from midblock U-turn facilities. In order to know the condition and operational performance of the roadway, the traffic flow need to analysed for the road segment consist of midblock U-turn Facilities at Skudai – pontian Highway. Based on the hypothesis that capacity loss would result from U– turning at midblock U-turn facilities; 24 hours data were collected as volume and speed at two sites in Skudai Town, Malaysia. <b>Automatic</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>counter</b> was used to collect the traffic data such as volume and speed of the road section with and without influence by midblock U-turn facilities. The analyses of traffic data are continued by using fundamental relationship of speed and density to estimate the roadway capacity value.

40|$|Speed {{is one of}} the {{important}} parameters of traffic flow {{that can be used to}} determine the performance of driver’s behaviour under various scenarios. Changes in weather conditions caused changes in drivers’ speed due to various reasons. In Malaysia, there is slightly high number of road accidents at night. Rainfall at night does not only cause poor visibility to drivers, but it also gives a sense of insecurity especially as there is a significant reduction in the visibility of the object in front. Improper road conditions can worsen the situation, for example, rainfall can cause water accumulation on road surfaces which can increase skidding problem, potholes and hydroplaning effect. In relation to these situations, hence it is crucial to understand how the abrupt situation affect response of driver’s in terms of the macroscopic behaviour. These unpredictable environmental changes seem like portraying a very unpleasant journey for drivers especially to travel under rainfall condition at night. Therefore, there is a need to observe how individual vehicles react in terms of speed adjustment and response to the different rainfall intensities downpour at night. Hence this study was conducted to determine the impact of different rainfall intensities at night on vehicles’ speed. Traffic data was obtained using <b>automatic</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>counter</b> at a cross section of a road at Pengkalan Raja, Pontian for about three months during monsoon season. Rainfall data report was obtained from the Department of Drainage and Irrigation, Pontian. From this study, it was found that there is a speed reduction from the dry condition regardless of rainfall intensities at night. As rainfall intensities at night higher, the speed reduction is higher as well except for heavy rainfall condition. The mean speed, 15 th percentile and 85 th percentile of vehicles decrease with the increase in rainfall intensity at night. It can be concluded that rainfall have impact on vehicle’s speed irrespective of their intensities. Findings from this study can be used to help local authorities and transport planners in planning an efficient traffic management system for a safer travel experience to road users in Malaysia...|$|E
40|$|Most {{counties}} and local transportation agencies {{do not have}} the facilities and resources necessary to have any traffic monitoring programs, particularly for low volume roads. However, estimates of traffic volumes and their composition are important for planning, design, and operation of these roads, {{as well as for the}} allocation of highway funds. This study has developed a traffic estimation procedure for county roads that can be implemented with limited resources. The procedure estimates average daily traffic volumes with alternative traffic prediction models that incorporate relevant socioeconomic and demographic variables. ^ Field traffic data were collected from 40 out of 92 counties in Indiana. A statistical design of experiment was developed for grouping and selecting these counties. The selection of a county was based on population, state highway mileage, per capita income, and the presence of interstate highways. To select road sections within those counties, additional criteria [...] surface type (paved and gravel) and location (urban and rural) [...] were used. The study combined randomness and subjective judgments to select road sections for the installation of <b>automatic</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>counters.</b> ^ Four <b>automatic</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>counters</b> were used in each selected county. Two <b>traffic</b> <b>counters</b> were installed on county paved roads and two counters on county gravel roads. Two types of counters, a traditional rubber-tube <b>traffic</b> <b>counter</b> which counts only traffic volume and a vehicle magnetic imaging <b>traffic</b> <b>counter</b> which counts not only traffic volume but also truck percentage, were used in the present study. Most counters installed on the selected road sections were based on the standard 48 -hour traffic counts. Then, the obtained average daily traffic (ADT) was converted to annual average daily traffic (AADT) by means of adjustment (monthly variation) factors. ^ Traffic data obtained from the counters were analyzed before the development of the AADT prediction models. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to develop the AADT prediction models, which are reliable and easy to use. Two different AADT prediction models were developed for county roads, one for paved road and the other for gravel road. There were quantitative and qualitative predictor variables used in the model development. Because too many predictor variables were involved in the model development, a principal component analysis was also conducted. ^ To validate the developed models, additional field traffic data were collected from eight randomly selected counties. The accuracy measures of the validation showed the high accuracy of the prediction models. After various statistical analyses and tests, the study identified that models without reasonable outliers gave a better estimate. The statistical analysis also found that the independent variables employed in the models were statistically significant. The number of independent variables included in the models was kept to a minimum. ...|$|R

The results indicate that nonlinear latent variable regression models can effectively explain travel time variations on a regular day by using variables related to vehicle type, traffic density, and traffic composition. Test results indicate that the proposed framework for correcting measurement errors yields significant improvements over base models, where such errors are ignored. The findings from the study validate some key hypotheses regarding influences of various factors on speed of urban traffic streams and can serve as a tool for investigation of the causes of traffic congestion.

40|$|A survey {{conducted}} by Federal Highway Administration FHWA to the local community were clarified that {{the single most important}} factor affecting the ride quality was pavement roughness. From previous study, it shown that pavement roughness have an infuences towards the comfort of the driver, fuel efficiency, safety, and vehicle maintenance. Therefore, to improve the driving conditions of the highway system, pavement roughness should be addressed with priority. Numerous studies have shown that initial pavement roughness greatly affects ftiture roughness and roughness progression. Thus in this study, specifically investigates the impact of operating speed on pavement roughness. Considering the importance of pavement roughness towards riding comfort, it is imperative to study the factors from traffic engineering perspective such as crucial traffic parameters that involved to the pavement roughness. The goal of the study is to evaluate the operating speed with regards to pavement roughness, obtained from the actual speed of vehicles generally operates on the road and other traffic engineering parameters. The objectives of this study are to perform survey of road profiling in order to measure pavement roughness by incorporating International Roughness Index (IRI) index, to evaluate operating speed with regards to pavement roughness with the installation of <b>Automatic</b> <b>Traffic</b> <b>Counter</b> (ATC), to develop several models those are able to relate traffic engineering parameters with regards to pavement roughness (IRI index),and finally to validate the models and perform sensitivity analysis in order to check the sensitivity of each significant parameters.

40|$|Geometric {{road design}} {{consistency}} modelling {{is used to}} detect any inconsistencies in road alignment, particularly horizontal and vertical alignment. Unusual features of road geometries or inconsistencies can produce unsafe driving experience due to carelessness in the handling of vehicles. To help {{minimize the risk of}} accidents at the curve, the 85 th percentile speed prediction model is needed for the Malaysia scenario to ensure the road consistency. The current technique of identifying speed design based on REAM (2002) guidelines is prone to produce inconsistencies in road design. This is because the geometric elements determined from the identified speed design are based on minimum values and it is recommended to adopt higher values for the purpose of road construction (REAM, 2002). However, no maximum value has been set up thus leads towards under-design or over-design of road geometry specifications. With this in mind, this research aims to develop models for the purpose of predicting consistencies of urban road specifically for horizontal alignment curves with novel methodology adopted in this study. Several techniques were adopted such as spot speed study, VBOX-GPS and <b>Automatic</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>counter</b> detector and had been successfully performed. Parameters collected are the curve length, radius of curve, width of lane, vehicle speed {{at the beginning of the}} curve, at the middle of the curve and at the end of the curve, superelevation and road gradient. By adopting multiple regression analysis, one model for the beginning of the curve, V 85 cs, one model for the middle of the curve,V 85 cm and one model for the end of the curve, V 85 ce with R-Sq value of more than 50 % were successfully developed. These regression models generally estimates 85 th percentile operating speed at specified points along the curve. V 85 cs> V 85 cm and V 85 ce were further validated to confirm of its usefulness in predicting the value of operating speed for horizontal alignment. Validation of models were performed by comparing the mean difference of the develop regression models with the empirical data which is isolated from being used in the model development process. Comparisons of V 85 cm and three models from other researchers were also conducted and it revealed that V 85 cm is more superior compared to the other models developed from other researchers and established guidelines from overseas. It was also discovered that radius of curve, CR is highly sensitive in predicting the 85 th percentile operating speed at the middle of curve compared to superelevation and V 85 (CS). To conclude, fundamental differences indriving behaviour, traffic composition and road design standard guideline used may contribute to high difference of R-Sq values between the established models and V 85 cm- Furthermore, other models are not reflective of Malaysian road conditions and this was discovered in the comparisons conducted in this study. All these factors might contribute to the overestimation or underestimation of the models. Therefore, the developed models in this study are proposed to be a starting basis of the prediction of the 85 th percentile operating speed model to be included in the Malaysian urban geometric road design guidelines...|$|E

Tourism has also become the focus of attention in many rural communities where jobs in fisheries and agriculture have declined significantly. A strong and profitable tourism industry is however dependent upon transportation infrastructure. This research evaluates the effects of the Héðinsfjörður tunnels on the flow of tourists in the northern Tröllaskagi region in order to clarify the effects of infrastructure improvements on tourism in peripheral areas. The study employs an integrated methodology of <b>automatic</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>counters,</b> <b>traffic</b> surveys, tourist surveys and official registration of tourist accommodation.

The Héðinsfjörður tunnels thus have contributed to the growth of tourism and a more diverse labor market in an area suffering from a decline in population and the primary industries.

40|$|In July 2008, {{system of}} partial {{payments}} on motorways was aborted {{and for most}} of the traffic replaced by a vignette system. Vignettes are bought in advance and are valid {{for a longer period of}} time. The switch of system caused major changes on traffic – traffic increased on motorways and decreased on some lower order state roads (for which payment is not demanded). The biggest change is seen in toll station areas. Increased traffic on motorways caused shorter distances among vehicles and more interplays, which demands higher concentration of a driver. On the other hand, increased traffic on motorways loosened traffic on lower order state roads, especially on those which were used before as a bypass of toll station areas (with intention of avoiding paying toll). The vignette system does not require stopping at toll station for vehicles lighter than 3, 5 tone. It means higher flow and less traffic jams in toll station areas. But at the same time, it makes integrating trucks back to lane even more effortful. The increase of traffic in toll station areas and changes related to it are demonstrated in this thesis. In order of making those demonstrations, I interpreted information about:  car accidents (number, type, cause, classification),  traffic flow reorganisation in toll station areas,  changes of traffic structure.

Based on the hypothesis that shockwave would result from U-turning at midblock facility, 24 hour data were collected which is volume and speed at two sites in FT 005 Skudai - Pontian highway, Malaysia. The two sites are denoted as site A and site B. The study of highway capacity is the most important part in the identification of road performance. Any change made at the roadway for example installing a midblock U-turn facilities would result in highway capacity 1 oss. There are mainly three causes of capacity loss which are due to the road condition itself, due to ambient and due to the traffic operation. When capacity loss happen, it would lead to traffic shockwaves. Traffic shockwave is a motion of propagation of a change in density and flow. When shockwaves happen, it would lead to reduction of roadway level of service. Speed, fow and density for with and without midblock U-turn facility are estimated using Greenshields Model. All data was collected using <b>Automatic</b> <b>Traffic</b> <b>Counters</b> (ATC). Shockwave velocity propagation with and without midblock U-turn facility were estimated by determining and comparing the capacity and density of roadway. Direct empirical capacity estimation methods are use to estimate capacity of roadway. Results shows that there is significant shockwave velocity propagation happen on the exit of the U-turn midblock facility which is about - 35. 1 kmlhr. While a minor shockwave happens at the approaching of the U-turn. This study concluded that midblock U-turn facilities will induce traffic shockwave that may lead to road accidents...|$|R
40|$|Traffic flow {{disturbances}} {{come from}} intersections, on/off ramps, work zones, pavement distress sections, tapering sections and ambient conditions. These cause speed drops and traffic flow rate changes and {{impact on the}} traffic carrying ability of roadway sections. These disturbances generate queues, cause long delays, increase travel times and may result in accidents. All these causes and effects must be considered if highway facilities should be operated unhindered. Thus this thesis examines the problems of rainfall disturbance to traffic flow and highway capacity. The effect of rainfall is more severe in tropical regions where it occurs in large quantities throughout the year. Thus four sites were set up in east and south Malaysian Peninsula respectively to generate data for the study. Data was collected using <b>automatic</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>counters</b> and rainfall data was obtained from two surface rain gauge stations that were 1174 m and 1840 m away from the data collection sites. The empirical data pointed towards speed and traffic flow reduction during rainfall spells. Further analysis using the fundamental diagram (trapezoidal flow contraction) method confirmed speed and flow reduction as the main impacts of rainfall to traffic flow in adverse weather. For the scenarios tested, such as peak period versus nonpeak, the trend remained the same. However, peak hour flow conditions are associated with instabilities {{that are difficult to}} separate from rainfall disturbances and were not analysed further. Highway capacity drops occurred between the dry condition and the three rainy regimes tested. Implications of traffic flow contraction for Passenger Car Equivalency (PCE) values of vehicles and traffic shock waves propagation were also investigated. PCE of heavy vehicles were lower than the values employed in the Arahan Teknik and the Malaysian Highway Capacity Manual, suggesting better performance of these vehicles under rainfall conditions mainly due to larger average headways and the prevailing free-flow conditions. In the case of traffic shock wave, the wave speeds were all lower than the speeds at critical density and the wave generated moved principally {{in the direction of the}} main stream flow, suggesting rarefaction waves rather than shock waves.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Civil EngineeringSunanda DissanayakeIn the United States, the mileage of unpaved roads {{is about}} 1. 6 million miles. Total length of unpaved roads in Kansas is about 98, 000 miles, of which about 78, 000 miles are gravel roads. Most of the gravel roads are not posted with speed limit signs but {{regulated}} with a 55 mph blanket speed limit {{established by the}} Kansas Statutes. Surface conditions of gravel roads are very likely to change with time, space, and quality of maintenance work, making it even more necessary to have proper control of speeds on gravel roads. Normally used speed regulations and rules for freeways or other types of paved roadways might not be appropriate for gravel roads, especially for those local gravel roads which usually carry very low traffic in rural areas. Based on an extensive literature search, there was no specific rule or references to provide guidelines on how speed limits on gravel roads could be set. Therefore, an effort was made in this study to evaluate the effects of currently posted lower speed limits in some counties in Kansas, based on traffic characteristics and safety on gravel roads, {{with the intention of}} providing proper guidelines for setting speed limits on gravel roads in Kansas. In order to study traffic characteristics on gravel roads, field speed studies were conducted with <b>automatic</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>counters</b> on more than forty gravel road sections in seven counties in Kansas. Important speed measures, such as 85 th-percentile speed and mean speed, were obtained from the raw data. A group of other related road characteristics were also recorded at the time of field data collection. Crash data on gravel roads were extracted from the Kansas Accident Recording System (KARS) database. Speed analysis on a number of gravel roads where the statutory imposed, unposted speed limit of 55 mph was utilized indicated that they are functioning at a reasonably acceptable level in terms of actual speeds. In order to evaluate whether there were differences in traffic speeds between two counties or groups which have different speed limit settings on gravel roads, t-test was used. The analysis found that {{there was no significant difference}} between the mean speeds in two counties, one of which has 35 mph posted speed limit on gravel roads while the other does not post any speed limits. Moreover, the mean speed on the sections with 35 mph posted speed was a little higher than that on gravel roads without any speed limits. Linear models to predict 85 th-percentile speed and mean speed on gravel roads were developed based on speed data. Both models indicated that traffic speeds are not significantly affected by the speed limit, but are related with 90 % confidence to road width, surface classification and percentage of large vehicles in traffic. Chi-square tests were conducted with the crash data, and the results indicated that the posted 35 mph speed limit on gravel roads had not resulted in either smaller total number of crashes or decreased proportion of severe crashes, compared to gravel roads where no speed limits were posted. Logistic regression models were also developed on four levels of crash severity, which indicated that gravel roads with higher speed limits are likely to experience higher probability of having injury crashes. Two mail-back surveys were also conducted to gather the opinions of county engineers and road users on the subject of suitable speed limits on gravel roads. The majority of county engineers believed that blanket speed limit should be used for gravel roads and does not need to be posted. Three restrictions: changeful road conditions, unpractical law enforcement, and limited funds, are basic reasons why they do not think that gravel roads should be posted. Besides that, a few respondents said 55 mph is too high for gravel roads and needs to be lowered. Majority of the road users suggested that all gravel roads be posted with lower speed limit signs. However, they were more concerned about law enforcement since they believe that posted speeds won't bring any benefits if no law enforcement patrol gravel roads. Based on all aspects looked into in this study, it does not appear that reducing the speed limits and posting it with signs, is going to improve either traffic operational or safety characteristics on gravel roads in Kansas, and therefore is not recommended for new situations...|$|R

However, <b>automatic</b> <b>traffic</b> data collection {{has been one of}} the challenges in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). This project presents the development of a single camera-based video system for <b>automatic</b> <b>traffic</b> data collection for roundabouts and intersections. The system targets roundabouts and intersections because no mature data collection systems exist for these traffic scenes yet in contrast to highway scenes. The developed system has mainly processing modules. First, the camera is calibrated for the traffic scene of interest and a novel circle-based calibration algorithm is proposed for roundabouts. Second, the system tracks vehicles from the video by incorporating powerful imaging processing techniques and trackin...|$|R
