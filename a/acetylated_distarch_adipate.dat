40|$|Elaboration {{of cocoa}} syrups {{by the use}} of {{modified}} starches such as <b>acetylated</b> <b>distarch</b> <b>adipate</b> (ADA) and oxidised starch (OS) were described and analysed the influence of different amounts of ADA and OS on physical and sensory properties of cocoa syrups. The sensory, textural and rheological properties of syrups produced in the laboratory conditions were compared to the properties of commercially pro-duced ones. The quantity of modified starch added affected textural and rheological properties of syrups. All analysed syrups showed non-Newtonian, pseudoplastic flow and thixotropy. Values of yield stresses, viscosities of Casson, and consistency coefficients of syrups prepared in laboratory conditions increased with an increase in the addition of modified starches.

40|$|The present Bachelor thesis {{gives an}} {{overview}} of the influence of some starch esters (acetylated distarch phosphate (E 1414) and adipate (E 1422)) as stabilizing agents in a salmon-emulsion-cream. The aim of this work was the development of an optimal recipe. Different concentrations of starches were used in combination with xanthan gum. The methods were used to describe the rheological, microphotographical, microbiological, chemical and sensorial characteristics of the spread. The analysis of determination and development of droplet size showed a significant reduction in coalescence process. Rheological experiments indicated that high concentrations of E 1414 are necessary getting a slightly higher viscosity than in case of the E 1422 creams. The microbiological results showed minimal differences. All tested samples showed high stability against oxidation. For the use of a new recipe <b>acetylated</b> <b>distarch</b> <b>adipate</b> is the better choice in this case...|$|E
40|$|Hokkaido {{potatoes}} {{are widely used}} {{as a source of}} starch. Potato starch is used for various purposes,particularly for the production of fish paste products,livestock products, and confectionery. Moreover, modified starch, which is produced by processing potato starch chemically and physically, is used in a variety of forms. This study examines the properties of modified starch gels produced by further enhancing the starch functions of potato starch. To study the primary properties of starch gels, color tone tests, viscosity measurements, and texture measurements were performed. <b>Acetylated</b> <b>distarch</b> phosphate gel had the highest values, followed byhydroxypropyl distarch phosphate gel,starch acetate gel,and potato starch gel. As for the degree of viscosity, hydroxypropyl distarch phosphate gel was the thickest,followed by <b>acetylated</b> <b>distarch</b> phosphate gel,potato starch gel,and starch acetate gel. In this experiment, changes in the properties of modified starch gels were observed as compared with those of potato starch gel. In the future,we would like to compare various types of modified starch and the effects of being frozen or defrosted on starch properties...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} effects of added native tapioca starch; N and starch ester (starch acetate; A, starch phosphate; P, and <b>acetylated</b> <b>distarch</b> phosphate; PA) on the cooking characteristics and textural stability of frozen noodles. Physical and chemical analyses were done after the starches were differentiated based on noodle starch added at 10, 20 and 30 %. The research results showed that added of starch ester showed lower viscosity break down (BD), (p< 0. 05) and viscosity set back (SB), with the maximum decrease in the starch phosphate (BD values decreased from 110. 75 ± 2. 83 RVU to 63. 66 ± 5. 87 RVU; SB values decreased from 109. 22 ± 1. 51 RVU to 67. 00 ± 3. 86 RVU), but the set back value of <b>acetylated</b> <b>distarch</b> phosphate (PA) increased along {{with an increase in}} starch added. The starch added of starch phosphate showed increased peak viscosity (p< 0. 05) (increased from 255. 47 ± 2. 34 RVU to 291. 42 ± 0. 82 RVU), holding viscosity (increased from 144. 72 ± 0. 81 RVU to 227. 75 ± 5. 24 RVU), final viscosity (increased from 253. 94 ± 0. 97 RVU to 294. 75 ± 1. 38 RVU). The starch added of acetate showed decreased peak viscosity (decreased from 255. 47 ± 2. 34 RVU to 218. 39 ± 2. 55 RVU), final viscosity (decreased from 253. 94 ± 0. 97 RVU to 225. 42 ± 2. 01 RVU). For the swelling power, the starch added of native tapioca starch, starch acetate and starch phosphate showed increased swelling power (p< 0. 05), among which the starch phosphate showed the maximum increase (the swelling power increased from 14. 66 ± 0. 24 to 30. 40 ± 0. 35 at 95 ℃). Moreover, there were no changes in the swelling power of <b>acetylated</b> <b>distarch</b> phosphate. The results of the cooking characteristic of starch added of noodles at different starch levels showed that there was a weight gain in the starch added of starch (p< 0. 05), which could be caused by the increase in the swelling power of starch added. There was a decrease in the cooking loss of starch added, but there were no changes in the <b>acetylated</b> <b>distarch</b> phosphate noodle, instead there was a slight increase, which could be caused by short cooking time. The results of textural analysis of noodles showed that an increase in the various starch added, would decrease the hardness, chewiness, adhesiveness and tensile strength of the noodles. After the freeze-thaw cycles of the noodles, the thickness increased, while the hardness, chewiness, tensile strength and tensile distance decreased. The break down value showed a negative relationship (p< 0. 01) with the cooked weight gain of noodle and a positive relationship (p< 0. 05) with the hardness, chewiness, adhesiveness and tensile strength of noodle. The set back value showed a positive relationship (p< 0. 001) with the cooking loss of noodles and a negative relationship (p< 0. 05) with the Elasticity of noodle. The swelling power showed a positive relationship (p< 0. 05) with the cooking weight gain and cooking volume gain of noodles and a negative relationship (p< 0. 05) with the cooking loss of noodles. 本論文擬探討天然樹薯澱粉(Native tapioca starch；N) 及不同酯化修飾澱粉：醋酸酯化澱粉(Starch acetate；A) 、磷酸酯化澱粉(Starch phosphate；P) 與乙醯化磷酸二澱粉(Acetylated Distarch Phosphate；PA) 的添加對冷凍熟麵條烹煮特性及質地穩定性的影響。先將澱粉分別對麵粉添加 10 %、 20 %、 30 %三種比例後進行理化性分析，分析結果顯示，添加酯化修飾澱粉可顯著的(p< 0. 05) 降低黏度裂解值(Break Down；BD) 和黏度回昇值(Set Back；SB) ，以添加磷酸酯化澱粉(P) 的降幅最大， (BD值由 110. 75 ± 2. 83 RVU下降至 63. 66 ± 5. 87 RVU；SB值由 109. 22 ± 1. 51 RVU下降至 67. 00 ± 3. 86 RVU) ，但添加乙醯化磷酸二澱粉(PA) 黏度回昇值(SB) 則隨著添加量增加而增加黏度。添加磷酸酯化澱粉(P) 可顯著的(p< 0. 05) 提升尖峰黏度(由 255. 47 ± 2. 34 RVU上升至 291. 42 ± 0. 82 RVU) 、恆溫黏度(由 144. 72 ± 0. 81 RVU上升至 227. 75 ± 5. 24 RVU) 、最終黏度(由 253. 94 ± 0. 97 RVU上升至 294. 75 ± 1. 38 RVU) ；添加醋酸酯化澱粉(A) 可顯著的(p< 0. 05) 降低尖峰黏度(由 255. 47 ± 2. 34 RVU下降至 218. 39 ± 2. 55 RVU) 、最終黏度(由 253. 94 ± 0. 97 RVU下降至 225. 42 ± 2. 01 RVU) 。在膨潤力(Swelling Powder) 方面，添加天然樹薯澱粉(N) 、醋酸酯化澱粉(A) 和磷酸酯化澱粉(P) 均顯著增加膨潤力(p< 0. 05) ，其中以磷酸酯化澱粉(P) 增加的幅度最大(於 95 ℃時膨潤力由 14. 66 ± 0. 24 提升至 30. 40 ± 0. 35) ，另添加乙醯化磷酸二澱粉(PA) 的麵條粉，膨潤力無顯著改變。 將添加不同澱粉比例的麵粉製成麵條後進行烹煮特性分析與質地分析，烹煮特性分析結果顯示，澱粉之添加有顯著增加麵條煮麵增重率之趨勢(p< 0. 05) ，其造成的原因可能與澱粉添加後膨潤力增加有關；澱粉的添加會顯著降低麵條的煮麵損失率，但添加乙醯化磷酸二澱粉(PA) 的麵條無顯著降低，反而稍微增加，煮麵時間短可能是造成其增加的原因。熟麵條質地分析結果顯示，隨著各種澱粉添加量的增加，會降低麵條的硬度(Hardness) 、咀嚼性(Chewiness) 、附著度(Adhesiveness) 和抗拉強度(Tensile strength) 。麵條在冷凍-解凍循環後，厚度(Thickness) 會增加，硬度、咀嚼度、抗拉強度和抗拉距離會降低。 麵粉理化特性的黏度裂解值(BD) 與麵條煮麵增重率有顯著的負相關性(p< 0. 01) ，而與麵條硬度、咀嚼性、附著性和抗拉強度有顯著的正相關性(p< 0. 05) ；黏度回升值(SB) 與麵條的煮麵損失率有顯著的正相關性(p< 0. 001) ，而與麵條感官品評的彈性(Elasticity) 有顯著的負相關性(p< 0. 05) ；膨潤力與麵條的煮麵增重率和煮麵增容率有顯著的正相關性 (p< 0. 05) ，而與煮麵損失率有顯著的負相關性(p< 0. 05) 。摘 要	 1 目 錄	V 圖 次	VIII 表 次	X 前 言	 1 第一章、文獻整理	 2 一、冷凍麵條及其市場概況	 2 (一) 麵條(Noodles) 	 2 (二) 冷凍麵條之特性及種類	 3 (三) 冷凍麵條市場概況	 5 二、冷凍熟麵條之製備及質地特性	 7 (一) 冷凍麵條之製備	 7 (二) 冷凍熟麵條之質地特性	 7 (三) 冷凍麵條品質影響因子	 13 三、澱粉之介紹	 23 (一) 天然澱粉 (Native starch) 	 23 (二) 修飾澱粉 (Modified starches) 	 30 第二章、材料與方法	 39 一、實驗架構	 39 二、材料	 39 (一) 麵粉 (Wheat flour) 	 39 (二) 澱粉 (Starch) 	 39 (三) 鹽 (Salt) 	 39 三、實驗方法	 41 (一) 麵條粉理化特性分析	 41 (二) 麵條製備	 42 (三) 麵條烹煮特性分析	 43 (四) 麵條質地分析	 45 (五) 冷凍-解凍試驗(Freeze-Thaw cycles) 	 47 (六) 統計分析	 47 第三章、結果與討論	 48 一、酯化澱粉添加對麵粉理化性質之影響	 48 (一) 快速糊化黏度分析(Rapid viscosity analyzer, RVA) 	 48 (二) 示差熱掃瞄分析(Differential scanning calorimeter, DSC) 	 54 (三) 膨潤力(Swelling power) 	 56 (四) 溶解度 (Solubility) 	 57 (五) 凝膠質地(Gel texture) 	 58 二、酯化澱粉添加對麵條烹煮特性之影響	 67 (一) 烹煮時間(Cooking time) 	 67 (二) 煮麵損失率(Cooking loss) 	 67 (三) 煮麵增重率(Cooked weigh gain) 	 68 (四) 煮麵增容率(Cooked volume gain) 	 68 (五) 冷凍-解凍對麵條烹煮特性之影響	 68 三、酯化澱粉添加對麵條質地之影響	 73 (一) 質地剖面分析(Texture profile analysis, TPA) 	 73 (二) 抗拉強度(Tensile strength) 	 88 (三) 微細構造(SEM) 	 94 (四) 感官品評(Sensory evaluation) 	 94 四、麵條特性與澱粉特性之相關性	 100 (一) 澱粉理化特性與麵條烹煮特性之相關性	 100 (二) 澱粉理化特性與麵條質地之相關性	 100 (三) 麵條烹煮特性與麵條質地之相關性	 101 第四章、結論	 115 參考文獻	 116 附 錄	 12...|$|R
