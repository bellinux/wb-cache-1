However, in a situation of disciplining a child, parents may have different attitudes or methods, which is considered to be related with what sort of qualities the parent expects the child to develop. The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine a relationship between the parent’s disciplinary attitude and the considering point for child’s development. 111 parents of kindergarten children <b>answer</b> <b>following</b> <b>questions,</b> 1) their daily disciplinary attitudes and 2) what qualities they consider most important when adopting such disciplinary attitudes. Their free answers were categorized “the parent’s attitude” and “consideration point”, then analyzed the relationship between two categories. The results as follows that; parents who expect their children to “obey the rules” and “control their desires” take a “parental-lead” attitude; those who expect their children to develop “decision-making abilities” and “values” take a “child-initiated” attitude; while those who expect their children to develop “emotional experiences” take a “child- centered” attitude. As a conclusion that parents’ attitudes in disciplining their children often vary depending on what quality the parent considers important for their children to develop...|$|E

The study is directed to <b>answer</b> <b>following</b> <b>questions.</b> Firstly, why transformative Islam becomes a discourse on curriculum development. Secondly, how a discourse of transformative Islam implicates in curriculum development at state institute for Islamic studies of Purwokerto (IAIN). Then, the findings show that a discourse of Islam tranformative in curriculum development at state institute for Islamic studies of Purwokerto (IAIN) emerges {{as a result of}} an incapability of traditional and modern Islam perspective to resolve people’s problem due to lack of critical understanding of the meaning and message of the Qur’an and Hadith. Then, implication of Islamic transformative discourse in curriculum development at state institute for Islamic studies of Purwokerto can be seen in its intra curricular activities, co-curricular, and extra curricular activities. Through intra-curricular activities, transformative Islam is embodied in Islamic building lectures. In co-curricular program, Islam is indigenized through activity of knowledge and practice of worship (nationally abbreviated PPI), while within extra-curricular activities transformative Islamic values come into student activities which are strongly supported by policies of university leaders. ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze how the {{political}} marketing was used and applied in the electoral campaign 2006 and how marketing influenced and changed the party’s behaviour (even after the elections). Political marketing can be described as the use of marketing concepts and methods in politics. It allows us to analyze political parties from a new and different perspective. We focus mainly on the relevant political subjects (which successfully entered the Parliament) with a special accent on the campaign of Social Democrats (ČSSD). The objectives of this paper are to analyze the electoral process as changing and developing activity and <b>answer</b> <b>following</b> <b>questions.</b> How the party formulated their strategies and how they use political communication. Secondly, to review how the campaign was organized. Thirdly, what attitude does the Czech political parties towards campaigning and elections and what changes we can expect in this field? Methodologically, we will approach it by introducing the Election Cycle Model. It is a heuristic model and it examines elections, campaigning and governing as mutually influenced process. We are aware that the model was tailored for the Czech Elections 2006; anyway, it provides us with a very solid framework for further analysis of the party’s behaviour. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{previous}} literature {{fails to}} reach {{consensus on the}} role of media in the foreign aid allocation. My paper attempts to <b>answer</b> <b>following</b> <b>questions</b> by examining Muslim countries: Are there any media effects on the pattern of aid giving? If the media influence the amount of aid, then how does it play its role? In addition, although previous studies show that different donors have prioritized specific groups, no study systemically shows the reason why a donor prioritizes certain recipients. Examining all recipients and donors cannot control the circumstantial factors generated by different regions and ethnicities. In other words, donors allocate international aid to different group of countries for various reasons and much of the research fails to examine the reasons that cannot be generalized. This paper conducts the OLS time series regression analysis with robust standard errors for U. S. foreign aid allocations, specifically for 46 Muslim/Arab countries. The results of my empirical analysis are threefold. First, Muslim/Arab related factors such as oil reserves, Millennium Challenge Account, and the existence of terrorist groups affect aid variation. Second, the more media attention a country acquires, the more it is likely to receive more generous allocations of aid. Finally, and most importantly, there is a negative interaction effect between the level of media coverage and the number of U. S. soldiers present in that country on aid allocation. When a Muslim recipient maintains more number of U. S. soldiers than the yearly mean U. S. troop level of Muslim countries, the media effect on aid volume decreases. This finding provides guideline for the plausible links around the public, media and governing bodies. Thesi...|$|E
40|$|The {{continuous}} dredging {{of shipping}} channels is a commom problem in most estuaries. Shoals constitute navigational hazards, which {{have to be}} removed to guarantee a safe access to the adjacent harbors. Dredging is always associated with the dumping of dredge spoil at declared sites, which are normally located close to the dredged channel. In this context, a main problem is the uncertainty, whether the dumped material remains at the site or is further transported by currents and redistributed in the surrounding estuarine area. In the worst case, the previously dredged channel might be re-infilled. However, knowledge {{about the fate of}} dumped sediments and their interaction with the existing morphological and sedimentological conditions is still fragmentary, especially in a dynamic tidally influenced environment. The goal of this work is to contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the natural dynamic processes and the consequences of dredge spoil dumping in a coastal area. A dumping site situated in the seaward exposed outer Weser Estuary (German Bight) was repeatedly surveyed with a shallow-water multibeam echosounder and an acoustic seabed classification system, which enable to investigate large seabed areas in a cost- and time-efficient mode, and thus the monitoring and investigation of morpho- and sedimentdynamical processes in a high spatial and temporal resolution. The aim of the present thesis was to <b>answer</b> <b>following</b> <b>questions</b> concerning the naturally and artificially changed state of the dumping area: How does the sediment budget change due to the supply of sediment by dredge spoil dumping? What are the predominant sediment transport pathways? How strong is the impact of dumped material on morphological seabed features? How variable is the spatial distribution of sediments in the dumping area...|$|E

The main goal of this thesis was to introduce {{his life and his}} best known works, together with their appearance in schools. In particular, I was interested with response of students, which I got first hand during tuition in class and through assessment of their written works. Based on this, I was trying {{to determine the extent to}} which his work is present in curriculum and student literature. In first chapter, I introduced in detail Golia`s life and work. Further on, I focused on history of development of youth drama, from its beginning until today. I introduced the basic terms, such as playwright, youth drama and youth literature and described all phases of school interpretation of those. In practical part I studied drama »Jurček« (»Little George«) with pupils from fifth grade during class, after which we visited local library to further learn about Golia`s life and other notable works. In this thesis I also included preparation and assessment material for studies of Golia with pupils. In my thesis, I would like to <b>answer</b> <b>following</b> <b>questions</b> •	whether Pavel Golia`s literature is present in national curriculum and in study literature, •	if teachers in local primary school discuss local author with pupils during their literature classes, •	how much students know about Pavel Golia, •	whether the topic of powerty 85 years ago, which was included in Golia`s play »Jurček«, still resonates among young readers of Golia`s works. Empirical part of the thesis will be done by means of direct observation of students in fifth grade of Trebnje Primary School. Research will be done using descriptive method, with qualitative techniques of data collection (by mean of descriptions). Main tools used during this research will be students` notes, their photographs and their works, completed during classes. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{concerned}} the wear of farm sprayer nozzles in practical operation and {{was conducted in}} order to <b>answer</b> <b>following</b> <b>questions.</b> * when do the nozzles become worn out? * which type of nozzle wears out the fastest? * do certain herbicides cause more wear than others? The Swedish Farmers Selling & Purchasing Association had requested its local branches to collect nozzles from farmers who had kept records of how they had been used. These records gave information {{on the type of}} herbicide, the number of seasons used and the spray rate. Altogether 42 sets of nozzles were used in the survey. Of these, 9 were made of brass (fan nozzles) and 33 of plastic (5 cone nozzles, 28 fan nozzles). The experimental equipment consisted of a patternator. The test was divided into two parts, the first dealing with determinations of the flow and the second dealing with the spraying uniformity. In the present study the total flow per nozzle was chosen as a measure of the nozzles range of use. As the original flows of the nozzles are not known, it is impossible to calculate the relative change in flow. This survey demonstrates that the change in flow is negligible within the sector in which the nozzles have been used. Neither do coefficients of variation for the flow change with the total flow. The coefficient of variation for the distribution increases with the total flow in the nozzle. A plastic fan nozzle is, on average, worn out after approximately 4000 l. In order to obtain a corresponding value for brass we have made an extrapolation (but its justification is doubtful). According to the extrapolation, the brass nozzles would wear out after approximately 14000 l (3. 5 times more than plastic). The material was divided with regard to herbicides used into one group consisting of herbicides which form true solutions when mixed with water and another consisting of slurry herbicides and micro-suspensions. It is clear that the latter group is the most aggressive...|$|E
3000|$|Sustainability {{forms the}} core of {{corporate}} sustainability and is of utmost concern to all the stakeholders. There has been a growing awareness among the corporates to address environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues to contribute towards sustainable development. The development of sustainable organisations by improving environmental and social performance has become a global challenge for businesses around the world (Marrewijk 2003). There have been many studies addressing the need for incorporating sustainability into core business strategy (Dyllick and Hockerts 2002; Salzmann et al. 2005; Weber et al. 2008). Banking sector {{plays a crucial role}} in promoting sustainable development as it acts as an intermediary in the development of economy (Jeucken and Bouma 1999; Scholtens 2009). Prior literature shows that initially sustainable practices of the banks were confined to internal environmental management practices for energy efficiency, less resource consumption, and low carbon emission (Babiak and Trendafilova 2011), later complemented with the integration of environmental issues in lending and financing activities in the banking operations (Scholtens 2006; Johnsen 2003). The paradigm shift in the banks strategies to integrate environment, social and governance (ESG) issues in banking operations is crucial for moving towards sustainable development (van Gelder 2006). The banking sector is increasingly implementing sustainable banking practices as an important tool to address sustainable development issues (IFC 2007). The adoption of innovative sustainable products & services by the banks has witnessed tremendous growth in the recent years (Krosinsky and Robins 2008). The emergence of nonfinancial reporting through BRR, SR, CSR report and the likes, {{in the past two decades}} has been an attempt by the organizations to engage all the stakeholders in information dissemination and communicate nonfinancial performance of the business on environmental & social issues (Khan et al. 2009). Various frameworks, guidelines and standards have been evolved nationally and internationally like National Voluntary Guidelines (in India), Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), United Nation Global Compact (UNGC) principles, ISO 14001 and ISO 26000 which are widely adopted by organisations to improve social & environmental performance (Isaksson & Steimle 2009; Gupta & Mohanty 2014; Mitra & Schmidpeter 2017). Range of studies have been conducted in the field of sustainability reporting especially, in developed and developing economies (see, Willis 2003; Frost et al. 2005; Raman 2006; Roca & Searcy 2012; Khan et al. 2009; Ghosh 2017), but there is scant empirical research on the extent of sustainability reporting by Indian companies. The content of nonfinancial reporting particularly in the Indian banking sector too is understudied. It is in this context, this study attempts to <b>answer</b> <b>following</b> <b>questions.</b> How the banks in India report their sustainable practices? Is there any variation in the sustainability reporting practices of PSBs and private sector banks in India? [...]...|$|E
40|$|In {{the world}} of today, {{constant}} change is the “new normal”. The context of our global economy calls for {{a new set of}} entrepreneurial leaders; leaders who embrace and diligently find the way forward for their organizations. In this context, leading decision makers need efficient tools for smart business model decision-making. (Ries, 2011) Thus, this thesis sets out to <b>answer</b> <b>following</b> <b>questions,</b> with the purpose to inform those seeking a fundament for advantageous business model decision-making. MAIN QUESTION: Can the Business Model Canvas be an advantageous tool for business model decision-making in large enterprises? SUB QUESTION 1 : What are the limitations of the Business Model Canvas in the decision-making process? SUB QUESTION 2 : What modifications might be applied to increase the relevance of the Business Model Canvas as a tool for large enterprises? To answer these questions, the thesis presents relevant theory regarding key concepts behind the business model, frameworks and tools commonly used in the startup community (the Business Model Canvas, Customer Development, Lean Startup, and Lean Canvas), as well as an overview of the concepts of strategy and dynamic capabilities. The empirical procedure begins with hybrid brainstorming sessions and in-depth interviews, and continues with a workshop and evaluation interviews and questionnaires. The empirical work is conducted with Microsoft Sweden Services’ executive leadership team, spanning a time period of approximately one month. The results are derived by reviewing the empirical findings in light of theory. In short, the results show: (1) That five out of six leadership team members regarded the Business Model Canvas (BMC) as a 4 or 5 on a 1 - 5 scale, ranging from “Prefer traditional tools” (e. g. a business plan), to “Prefer the BMC” (2) That the following areas where identified as “Key areas of improvement” by the leadership team (number of members considering this a key area for improvement in brackets) : Connection to strategy (4 / 6), Connection to organizational capabilities (3 / 6), Connection to values (2 / 6), Mixing different levels of abstraction (1 / 6), Connection to compete (5 / 6), Ability to track development over time (4 / 6) The results are then discussed and analyzed, presenting critique of and limitations to the tools, as well as suggesting modification and a new model, The Business Model House (The BMH), which was created by this researcher and is based on following decisions: Integrate chosen aspects of the BMC and the Lean Canvas Add a foundation of values Add a ceiling of strategy Add an intersection of dynamic capabilities Add a third, optional, dimension capturing the transition between business models and innovation accounting. The purpose of these development decisions is to offer a more holistic and yet simple tool for business model decision-making...|$|E
