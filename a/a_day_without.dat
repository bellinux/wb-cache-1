500|$|The wingspans of {{the largest}} great {{albatrosses}} (genus Diomedea) are the largest of any bird, exceeding , although the other species' wingspans are considerably smaller at no more than [...] The wings are stiff and cambered, with thickened streamlined leading edges. Albatrosses travel huge distances with two techniques used by many long-winged seabirds: dynamic soaring and slope soaring. Dynamic soaring involves repeatedly rising into wind and descending downwind, thus gaining energy from the vertical wind gradient. The only effort expended is in the turns {{at the top and}} bottom of every such loop. This maneuver allows the bird to cover almost a thousand kilometres <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>without</b> flapping its wings. Slope soaring uses the rising air on the windward side of large waves. Albatross have high glide ratios, around 22:1 to 23:1, meaning that for every metre they drop, they can travel forward 22metres. They are aided in soaring by a shoulder-lock, a sheet of tendon that locks the wing when fully extended, allowing the wing to be kept outstretched without any muscle expenditure, a morphological adaptation they share with the giant petrels.|$|E

[...] Having fallen into bankruptcy many times before, Little was a particularly sensitive debtor, and would often waive the debts held to him by others who fell on hard times; thus it came to be that, by the time of his death, Little was owed millions of dollars by others, of which only 150,000 was successfully collected by his friends and family, a modest sum given the size of his former wealth.|$|E

500|$|On ButterFly, Streisand {{departed}} from the pop and rock influences that were strong on her previous efforts and instead relied more {{on a variety of}} experimental, contemporary pop music.

It was written by Sands, Ben Geminaro, and Richard Wiseman; production of [...] "Love in the Afternoon" [...] and all songs on ButterFly were solely handled by Peters. [...] "Guava Jelly" [...] is track two and a cover of Bob Marley's 1971 single.
