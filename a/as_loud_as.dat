25|$|The devocalization {{procedure}} {{does not}} take away a dog's ability to bark. Dogs will normally bark {{just as much as}} before the procedure. After the procedure the sound will be softer, typically about half <b>as</b> <b>loud</b> <b>as</b> before, or less, and it is not as sharp or piercing. So while the procedure does not stop barking or silence the animal completely, it is effective in reducing the sound level and sharpness of the dog's bark.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} reasonably accurate {{estimate of}} the speed of sound in air was made by William Derham, and acknowledged by Isaac Newton. Derham had a telescope {{at the top of the}} tower of the Church of St Laurence in Upminster, England. On a calm day, a synchronized pocket watch would be given to an assistant who would fire a shotgun at a pre-determined time from a conspicuous point some miles away, across the countryside. This could be confirmed by telescope. He then measured the interval between seeing gunsmoke and arrival of the sound using a half-second pendulum. The distance from where the gun was fired was found by triangulation, and simple division (distance/time) provided velocity. Lastly, by making many observations, using a range of different distances, the inaccuracy of the half-second pendulum could be averaged out, giving his final {{estimate of the}} speed of sound. Modern stopwatches enable this method to be used today over distances as short as 200–400 meters, and not needing something <b>as</b> <b>loud</b> <b>as</b> a shotgun.|$|E

500|$|Back in Liverpool, {{the group}} played an {{engagement}} on 17 December 1960, at the Casbah Coffee Club, with Chas Newby substituting for Sutcliffe, playing bass {{with them for}} four shows. Newby was shocked at the vast improvement of their playing and singing after the residency in Hamburg, and {{was struck by how}} powerful Best's drumming now was, pushing the group to play harder and louder. (It was probably due to McCartney that Best developed a loud drumming style, as he would often tell Best in Hamburg to [...] "Crank it up" [...] = play <b>as</b> <b>loud</b> <b>as</b> possible).|$|E
500|$|Frusciante's tenth solo album, The Empyrean, was {{released}} on January 20, 2009 through Record Collection. The record—a concept album—was in production between December 2006 and March 2008. The Empyrean features an array of musicians including Frusciante's ex-Chili Peppers bandmate Flea, friends Josh Klinghoffer and former Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr, as well as guest musicians including Sonus Quartet and New Dimension Singers. Frusciante stated: [...] "I'm really happy with [...] and I've listened to it {{a lot for the}} psychedelic experience it provides," [...] suggesting the album is [...] "to be played <b>as</b> <b>loud</b> <b>as</b> possible and is suited to dark living rooms late at night." ...|$|E
500|$|Along with Sir Humphry Davy (who visited Fyne Court in 1827), Crosse {{was one of}} {{the first}} to develop large voltaic piles. Although it was not the largest he built, Henry Minchin Noad's Manual of Electricity {{describes}} a battery consisting of 50 jars containing [...] of coated surface. Using his wires Crosse was able to charge and discharge it some 20 times a minute, [...] "accompanied by reports almost <b>as</b> <b>loud</b> <b>as</b> those of a cannon". He became known locally as [...] "the thunder and lightning man". In 1836 Sir Richard Phillips described seeing a wide variety of voltaic piles at Fyne Court, totalling 2,500, of which 1,500 were in use when he visited.|$|E

He had an eye on his stomach, round and yellow, emitting a glare like a fire-name. Looking wicked he thrust his big tongue out of his huge mouth licking the sides." [...] The Ramayana presents a similar description of Kabandha. Kabandha had a broad chest and was without a head or neck. He had only one eye {{on his chest and}} a mouth on his belly. He used his long arms to draw his prey closer. Kabandha is often depicted as a tree.|$|E
500|$|Chas Newby, the ex-Black Jacks guitarist, {{was invited}} to play bass for four concerts, as bassist Stuart Sutcliffe had decided to stay in Hamburg. Newby played with the group at Litherland Town Hall and at the Casbah. He was shocked at the vast {{improvement}} in their playing and singing, and remembered Best's drumming to be very powerful, which pushed the group to play harder and louder. It was probably due to McCartney that Best developed a loud drumming style, as he would often tell Best in Hamburg to [...] "crank it up" [...] (play <b>as</b> <b>loud</b> <b>as</b> possible). When the group returned to Hamburg, by which time McCartney had switched to bass, Best was asked to sing a speciality number, [...] "Peppermint Twist", while McCartney played drums, but always felt uncomfortable being {{at the front of}} the stage.|$|E
500|$|Ki {{was mixed}} by Townsend, and {{features}} very little compression, {{in contrast with}} his usual wall-of-sound production style. Townsend explained that he originally [...] "tried doing the wall-of-sound with it and {{it just kind of}} ruined it...it turned it into a not-so-good Strapping record." [...] The album deliberately eschews the loudness wars, the recent music industry practice of competitively mastering audio to seem <b>as</b> <b>loud</b> <b>as</b> possible. [...] "I officially pull my hat out of the loudness wars", Townsend told his mastering engineer. The album's songs were primarily written in open C tuning, except for [...] "A Monday", [...] "Trainfire", and [...] "Disruptr" [...] in open B, [...] "Heaven's End" [...] and [...] "Winter" [...] in open B, and [...] "Quiet Riot" [...] in standard tuning. Townsend has cited Second Nature by The Young Gods, Paul Horn, Chants of India by Ravi Shankar, and Ween as influences on the album.|$|E

500|$|After 1974, Harrison {{no longer}} wrote songs as {{obviously}} Krishna-devotional as [...] "It Is 'He' (Jai Sri Krishna)", although {{he returned to}} recording bhajans intermittently, with songs such as [...] "Dear One" [...] in 1976 and [...] "Life Itself, released in 1981. In his book The Dawn of Indian Music in the West, Peter Lavezzoli writes that following Dark Horse and the [...] "ill-fated 1974 tour", Harrison [...] "continued to infuse his work with an implicit spirituality that rarely manifested on the surface". Speaking to ISKCON devotee Mukunda Goswami in 1982, Harrison said: Back in the sixties, whatever we were all getting into, we tended to broadcast it <b>as</b> <b>loud</b> <b>as</b> we could. I had had certain realizations and went through a period where I was so thrilled about my discoveries and realizations that I wanted to shout and tell it to everybody.

500|$|Cream {{performed}} {{their first}} American concerts in New York City in 1967. Robert Stigwood, the group's manager, booked {{them for a}} Murray the K package show at the RKO Manhattan Theatre from 25 March to 2 April 1967. [...] When it was finished, Stigwood arranged for a recording session with Ahmet Ertegun at Atlantic Studios. [...] Bruce and Brown {{had a number of}} new songs in various stages of development and entered the studio on 3 April. [...] Initially, Ertegun assigned Dowd to work with the trio. [...] Dowd had worked with many of the biggest jazz and rhythm and blues musicians in the 1950s and 1960s. [...] However, Cream was his first exposure to extreme volume levels. [...] The group arrived at Atlantic with their concert setup of multiple Marshall amplifiers (each 100 watts). [...] Dowd was surprised by the amount of equipment accompanying the trio: [...] "They recorded at ear-shattering level... Everyone I'd worked with before was using Fender Deluxes [...] or Twins —six- and seven-piece bands that didn't play <b>as</b> <b>loud</b> <b>as</b> this three piece did." ...|$|E
500|$|Rob Maier, {{construction}} {{coordinator and}} production designer for [...] "Tempest" [...] was very busy for this episode, as scenes were filmed at the Andalinis farm, and Zero Avenue (which {{is the name}} of the road that runs along the Canada–US border) for the scene where the three tornadoes touch down beside Lana. He also had to work on shattering the windows at the Luthor Mansion for Lex and Lionel’s final confrontation. The band Remy Zero, whose single [...] "Save Me" [...] is the opening theme for the show, was asked to perform for the episode. The band quickly learned that filming a live performance for a television show is not as straight forward as its sounds. In order to be able to film everything, Beeman could not have the band playing full volume throughout the scene. There were times when everyone had to be quiet and pretend to play, or dance, while the actors exchanged their dialogue. There were other times when they had to be <b>as</b> <b>loud</b> <b>as</b> they could.|$|E

500|$|The {{south-east}} London club Charlton Athletic {{were linked}} with {{a move to}} [...] "a progressive Midlands borough" [...] in 1973, a year after Charlton's relegation to the third tier. The Gliksten family, which owned Charlton from 1932 to 1982 and {{had a history of}} proposing elaborate schemes for the club, revealed plans to build a community sports complex at The Valley, and to hold a public market at the ground on weekdays. Greenwich Council refused to license the market and insisted that the complex be built on public space at a local park. The club reacted by announcing the proposed move to the Midlands. Fans inundated the local media and club offices with strong opinion against a move, prompting Charlton to print a statement in the 14 April 1973 match programme telling fans that the proposed move was because of the council's attitude regarding the market and complex plans, which the team said threatened its future. [...] "You, the supporters, can make sure the club continues in Charlton by protesting <b>as</b> <b>loud</b> <b>as</b> you can to Greenwich Council over their refusal to grant us permission for our plans," [...] the message explained.

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Ironic" [...] was {{directed}} by Stéphane Sednaoui.|publisher=Allmusic. Rovi Corporation|accessdate=April 14, 2011}} In {{the beginning of the}} video, Morissette is at a gas station, walking to her automobile {{with a cup of coffee}} in her hand. Then, she drives her car through a winter landscape, and she begins to sing the song's first verse. When it comes to the chorus, a second Morissette comes in. She is in a green sweater and sits in the backseat on the passenger side. When the first chorus ends, a third Morissette comes in, and she is in a yellow sweater with braided hair, also in the backseat, but on the driver's side. Along the way, the yellow Morissette is singing and eating at the same time, and when it comes to the second verse, a fourth and last Morissette comes in, she is in a red sweater sitting in the front passenger seat. During the second chorus, she climbs out of the window when they are still driving and almost gets knocked out by a bridge, but still manages a smile after doing so. The camera comes back to the driving Morissette, after the breakdown, and she takes off her hat, tosses it into the back seat, and becomes <b>as</b> <b>loud</b> <b>as</b> the other three while singing the song. When Morissette sings the outro, she is still driving through the winter landscape, and suddenly the car breaks down (possibly having run out of gas, which may be [...] "ironic" [...] in itself since the video started with her at a gas station). Morissette (as the driver) gets out of the car, and all her [...] "passengers" [...] have disappeared.|$|E
500|$|Chandler and the Experience {{found time}} to record between {{performances}} in Europe. They began on October 23, recording [...] "Hey Joe" [...] at De Lane Lea Studios, with Chandler as producer and Dave Siddle as engineer. The song featured backing vocals by the Breakaways. Soon after the session began, Chandler asked Hendrix to turn his guitar amplifier down, and an argument ensued. Chandler commented: [...] "Jimi threw a tantrum because I wouldn't let him play guitar loud enough... He was playing a Marshall twin stack, {{and it was so}} loud in the studio that we were picking up various rattles and noises." [...] According to Chandler, Hendrix then threatened to leave England, stating: [...] "If I can't play <b>as</b> <b>loud</b> <b>as</b> I want, I might as well go back to New York." [...] Chandler, who had Hendrix's immigration papers and passport in his back pocket, laid the documents on the mixing console and told Hendrix to [...] "piss off". Hendrix laughed and said: [...] "All right, you called my bluff", and they got back to work. Redding wrote in his diary that they completed two songs during the October 23 session, but the second one has never been positively identified. Author Sean Egan speculated that it might have been Howlin' Wolf's [...] "Killing Floor" [...] or Wilson Pickett's [...] "Land of a Thousand Dances". Chandler decided that they should use an Experience original for the B-side of the single, so he encouraged Hendrix to start writing; he composed his first Experience song, [...] "Stone Free", the following day. Chandler, in an effort to minimize studio expenses, purchased rehearsal time at the Aberbach House in London. He abandoned this practice after realizing how quickly the group could learn songs while warming up in the studio. On November 2, 1966, the Experience returned to De Lane Lea to continue work on their first single. During the session, they recorded [...] "Stone Free" [...] and a demo version of [...] "Can You See Me". This marked {{the first time that the}} Experience recorded a song that was eventually included on the original UK release of the album.|$|E
