40|$|Research on {{advanced}} {{heat engine}} concepts, {{such as the}} low-heat-rejection engine, have shown the potential for increased thermal efficiency, reduced emissions, lighter weight, simpler design, and longer life in comparison to current diesel engine designs. A major obstacle {{in the development of}} a functional advanced heat engine is overcoming the problems caused by the high combustion temperatures at the piston ring/cylinder liner interface, specifically at top ring reversal (TRR). Therefore, <b>advanced</b> <b>cylinder</b> liner and piston ring materials are needed that can survive under these extreme conditions.

The definitive version is available at: [URL] article presents detailed analysis of the conforming contact between a piston and cylinder liner in a high-speed racing engine under extreme operating conditions owing to high loads and operating speeds in excess of 19 000 r/min, resulting in a high sliding velocity of 42 m/s. The analysis indicates contact forces generated in the order of 2. 5 kN. The contribution due to fluid film lubrication is found to reside in iso-viscous rigid or elastic regimes of lubrication, which is insufficient to form a coherent lubricant film during some parts of the cycle, such as at top-dead-centre (TDC). The article shows that at combustion, 95 per cent of the contact can remain in boundary or mixed regimes of lubrication.

40|$|ABSTRACT High {{resolution}} {{real time}} heat release analysis {{will become increasingly}} impor-tant in the future development of engine control systems. The increased demands on efficiency and emissions will put high demands on future engine control. Future engine concepts, for ex-ample the HCCI engine concept might crave cylinder pressure based Closed-Loop Combustion Control (CLCC). The analysis of cylinder pressure is a relatively computationally expensive task {{that is difficult to}} implement in existing engine controllers due to the real time demands.

2500|$|In a single-action revolver, {{the hammer}} is {{manually}} cocked, usually with the thumb of the firing or supporting hand. This action <b>advances</b> the <b>cylinder</b> {{to the next}} round and locks the cylinder in place with the chamber aligned with the barrel. The trigger, when pulled, releases the hammer, which fires the round in the chamber. To fire again, the hammer must be manually cocked again. This is called [...] "single-action" [...] because the trigger only performs a single action, of releasing the hammer. Because only a single action is performed and trigger pull is lightened, firing a revolver in this way allows most shooters to achieve greater accuracy. Additionally, the need to cock the hammer manually acts as a safety.

Major development activities reported are the design, analysis, and fabrication of monolithic ceramic components; vapor phase and solid film lubrication; electrohydraulic valve actuation; and high pressure common rail injection. An <b>advanced</b> single <b>cylinder</b> test bed was fabricated as a laboratory tool in studying these advanced technologies. This test bed simulates the reciprocator for a system having no cooling system, turbo compounding, Rankine bottoming cycle, common rail injection, and variable valve actuation to achieve fuel consumption of 160 g/kW-hr (. 26 lb/hp-hr). The advanced concepts were successfully integrated into the test engine. All ceramic components met their functional and reliability requirements. The firedeck, cast-in-place ports, valves, valve guides, piston cap, and piston ring were made from silicon nitride. Breakthroughs required to implement a 'ceramic' engine included the fabrication of air-gap cylinder heads, elimination of compression gaskets, machining of ceramic valve seats within the ceramic firedeck, fabrication of cast-in-place ceramic port liners, implementation of vapor phase lubrication, and elimination of the engine coolant system. Silicon nitride valves were successfully developed to meet several production abuse test requirements and incorporated into the test bed with a ceramic valve guide and solid film lubrication. The ADECD cylinder head features ceramic port shields to increase insulation and exhaust energy recovery. The combustion chamber includes a ceramic firedeck and piston cap.

50|$|During engine {{operations}} the Ignition cassette continuously {{monitors the}} ion currents in the cylinders and sends {{a signal to}} the Trionic ECU, pin 44, in an event of knocking. The logic for this function rests solely in the ignition cassette and is adaptive {{to be able to handle}} disturbing fuel additives. The Trionic ECU is well aware which cylinder that has ignited and could hence cope with the information feed through one pin. The signal to pin 44 and ion current in the combustion chamber is related to each other, when this signal reaches a certain level the ECU interprets this as a knocking event and firstly lowering the ignition advance by 1,5Â° on this cylinder. If the knocking is repeated the ignition advance is lowered further 1,5 Â° up to 12Â°. In case of the same lowering of the ignition timing <b>advance</b> in all <b>cylinders</b> the ECU adds a small amount of fuel to all cylinders. If knocking occurs when the MAP is over 140 kPa the knocking is regulated by switching both fuel injection matrix and ignition advance matrix. If this is not sufficient the charging pressure is lowered. This purpose of this procedure is to maintain good performance. If the signal between the ignition cassette and the ECU is lost, the charging pressure is lowered to basic charging pressure and the ignition timing advance is lowered 12Â° when it exist a risk of knocking due to engine load.|$|R
50|$|The bar-hammer {{revolver}} is an interested type. It {{is uncertain}} when production began or ended. The 1845 patent on the bar-hammer {{is the same}} as on the pepperbox and some single shot pistol models. It is likely some number of years after 1845 before this type was produced. A patent for (oddly enough) Rollin White was issued in 1858 that pictured a modified Allen bar-hammer revolver. This would seem to indicate that production started no later than 1856-1857. However, it is possible that production started several years earlier. Production almost certainly ended {{before the end of the}} Wheelock era (c 1864). This is based on no more than the logic of simplifying production. In 1861, it is possible that Allen produced the bar-hammer, side-hammer, and center-hammer percussion revolvers as well as the rimfire and lipfire cartridge revolvers simultaneously! Because demand from the War Between the States was consuming just about any arm produced, it would have made sense to cease production of the less advanced models. The lineage of the pepperbox is clear in the cylinder design, grip design, standard-style trigger, and patented bar hammer double-action design. This may represent simple design evolution, as the double action pepperbox 'pocket pistols' were very popular in the market. Allen may have been counting on visual and functional design similarity to help sell these revolvers. The design may also be very thoughtful in regards to avoiding patent issues. By incorporating his unchallenged 1845 patent for the bar-hammer double-action mechanism, Allen may have wished to avoid any patent infringement problems from Colt for his own revolving mechanism IF the revolver was produced before the expiry of the Colt patent in 1857. Considering all of the evidence that Allen was a thoughtful and frugal businessman, it may simply demonstrate that using common parts was less expensive than designing new ones. Finish was blued, with wood grips as standard, though ivory could be had for an extra cost. The Allen bar-hammer is actually quite advanced in that pulling the trigger <b>advances</b> the <b>cylinder,</b> cocks the hammer and drops the hammer, firing the weapon. The cylinder can be removed for cleaning with the removal of cylinder pin. A separate rammer would be needed for loading. It is likely that the cylinder would be removed for loading, so reloading under duress is not practical. The author finds these revolvers aesthetically pleasing and very practical for a pocket pistol. This style was manufactured and sold in three different sizes.|$|R
40|$|Due to {{environmental}} aspects and emission legislations {{the automotive industry}} is striving towards more efficient combustion engines. Many engine control systems in production today are based on look-up tables which are calibrated for different operating conditions. Improvements {{can be done by}} constructing better control systems to make the engine run in optimal operating conditions more often than conventional control systems are able to do today. One such improvement could be to replace some look-up tables with feedback control of wisely chosen properties of the combustion process. However, even if a promising property is found and quantified it must be measurable either directly or indirectly. Also, the property must be controllable using a suitable actuator. This thesis concentrates on estimating individual cylinder combustion phasing using a torque sensor mounted on a crankshaft. The combustion phasing is quantified using a measure called 50 % torque ratio and it is controllable by modifying the spark <b>advance</b> for each <b>cylinder.</b> A control system has been implemented in an engine test bench to be able to test the ideas. Several test cases have been designed to demonstrate the capability of the system to control the combustion phasing individually for each cylinder and to compensate for simulated external disturbances in steady-state conditions. The control system is also equipped with self-optimising functionality by using an extremum seeking controller to detect for which value of the torque ratio that maximises generated work from each cylinder. The resulting implemented control system is capable of maintaining a desired set-point for the torque ratio in steady-state conditions. Transient conditions have not been evaluated.

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. Using the method of matched asymptotic expansions the reflection and transmission coefficients are calculated for scattering of oblique water waves by a vertical barrier. Here an assumption is made that the barrier is small compared to the wavelength {{and the depth of}} water. A number of sloshing problems are considered. The eigenfrequencies are calculated when a body is placed in a rectangular tank. Here the bodies considered are a vertical surface-piercing or bottom-mounted barrier, and circular and elliptic cylinders. When the body is a vertical barrier, the eigenfunction expansion method is applied. When the body is either a circular or elliptic cylinder, and the motion is two-dimensional, the boundary element method is applied to calculate the eigenfrequencies. For comparison, two approximations, "a wide-spacing", and "a small-body" are used for a vertical barrier and circular cylinder. In the wide-spacing approximation, the assumption is made that the wavelength is small compared with the distance between the body and walls. The small-body approximation means that a typical dimension of the body is much larger than the cross-sectional length scale of the fluid motion. For an elliptic cylinder, the method of matched asymptotic expansions is used and compared with the result of the boundary- element method. Also a higher-order solution is obtained using the method of matched asymptotic expansions, and it is compared with the exact solution for a surface-piercing barrier. Again the assumption is made that the length scale of the motion is much larger than a typical body dimension. Finally, the drift force on multiple bodies is considered the ratio of horizontal drift force in the direction of wave <b>advance</b> on two <b>cylinders</b> to that on an isolated cylinder is calculated.

The ribbon conveyer, completely closed and sealed, it performs the soil transport to the hopper of the rotating oven. The rotating oven is formed from a rotating cylinder with length of 2. 500 mm, with a diameter of 500 mm and with angular speed ï·ï = 3. 2 1 /s. A burner, situated at the extremity of the cylinder, it produces a flame along the cylinder axis. It produces a temperatures distribution inside the cylinder that has been determined by mean a thermodynamic study of the considered process. The soil carried upward by the ribbon conveyor, in around 3 s, it comes in the hopper of the rotating cylinder. It moves toward the cylinder outlet, because of the inclination and rotating motion of the <b>cylinder,</b> <b>advancing</b> in counter-current to the heat propagation. Besides the soil, because of the rotating motion of the cylinder considered, is dragged upward for then reverting in the low part of the cylinder, with further soil breaking up.

Under such operative conditions the heat transfer in the soil is facilitated and therefore it increases the effectiveness of the soil disinfectant treatment during the range time when it crosses the whole length of the cylinder. It has been seen that with the values used of speed during the tests, it is avoided the âcookingâ of the contained clay in the considered soil.
