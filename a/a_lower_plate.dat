40|$|The Annieopsquotch accretionary tract {{comprises}} a thrust {{stack of}} Lower to Middle Ordovician arc and backarc terranes that were accreted to the Laurentian margin of Iapetus during Middle to Upper Ordovician. Geological relationships {{suggest that the}} constituent terranes of the Annieopsquotch accretionary tract initially formed outboard of a peri-Laurentian Dashwoods microcontinent in an extensional arc, but occupied <b>a</b> <b>lower</b> <b>plate</b> setting with respect to Dashwoods during accretion. Metamorphic mineral assemblages indicate that the terranes were underplated beneath the composite Laurentian margin at depths ranging from ~ 3 km up to > 18 km. We infer the accretion of the terranes {{to be controlled by}} the brittle–ductile transition in the hydrated crust. The decoupling of brittle from ductile crust resulted in very high aspect ratios of the terranes, which comprise thin (< 5 km) but very large (up to 25 × 250 km) slabs of supracrustal arc rocks and ophiolite crust. Arc basement and ophiolitic mantle are not preserved and were either underplated at a greater depth or subducted and recycled back in the mantle. The accreted crust forms a reasonable approximation to bulk continental crust requiring little post-accretionary modification; hence, the accretion of arc–backarc complexes which occupy <b>a</b> <b>lower</b> <b>plate</b> setting can form an important mechanism for creation of new continental crust required to balance crustal loss at convergent margins...|$|E

30|$|Early {{attempts}} {{to address this}} conundrum involved invoking simple shear type mechanisms, similar to those developed by Wernicke (1985) and colleagues in the Basin and Range province of the Western United States (Lister et al. 1991; Boillot et al. 1988; Whitmarsh et al. 2001). In this scenario high degrees of subsidence could be explained if the lower crust was extended more than the upper crust {{as a result of}} the passive margin being located in the upper plate of a simple shear system. This would imply contrasting reduced subsidence anomalies on the facing conjugate margin. However, as noted by Driscoll and Karner (1998), although many marine geologists were keen to label the particular margin that they were studying as being in the upper plate position, very few seem to consider the possibility of <b>a</b> <b>lower</b> <b>plate</b> setting.

In the Caledonides of Great Britain and Ireland, units accreted to Laurentia during the early Palaeozoic Era include peri-Gondwanan terrane assemblages that earlier separated from West Gondwana. However, the Southern Uplands Terrane contains detrital zircon populations apparently derived entirely from Laurentia, characterized by a large, asymmetric Mesoproterozoic peak and a scarcity of zircon at 600 Ma and 2. 1 Ga. In contrast, Cambrian and Ordovician rocks from the Lake District and the Leinster Massif of Ireland show abundant grains with these ages, together {{with a range of}} Mesoproterozoic zircon. These characteristics are shared with the Monian terrane of Anglesey and with Ganderia in the Appalachians, indicating probable derivation from Amazonia in West Gondwana.

This indicates that in the Caledonides, Ganderia was not accreted to the Laurentian margin until c. 430 Ma, in contrast to the Ordovician accretion of Ganderian fragments recorded in the Appalachians, suggesting that the configuration of the closing Iapetus Ocean varied significantly along the strike of the orogen...|$|E

40|$|It is {{becoming}} common for plant scientists to develop projects {{that require the}} genotyping {{of large numbers of}} plants. The first step in any genotyping project is to collect a tissue sample from each individual plant. The traditional approach to this task is to sample plants one-at-a-time. If one wishes to genotype hundreds or thousands of individuals, however, using this strategy results in a significant bottleneck in the genotyping pipeline. The Ice-Cap method that we describe here provides a high-throughput solution to this challenge by allowing one scientist to collect tissue from several thousand seedlings in a single day 1, 2. This level of throughput is made possible by the fact that tissue is harvested from plants 96 -at-a-time, rather than one-at-a-time. The Ice-Cap method provides an integrated platform for performing seedling growth, tissue harvest, and DNA extraction. The basis for Ice-Cap is the growth of seedlings in a stacked pair of 96 -well plates. The wells of the upper plate contain plugs of agar growth media on which individual seedlings germinate.

40|$|In {{the general}} {{discussion}} on the Variscan evolution of central Europe the pre-Mesozoic basement of the Alps is, in many cases, only included with hesitation. Relatively well-preserved from Alpine metamorphism, the Alpine External massifs can serve as {{an excellent example of}} evolution of the Variscan basement, including the earliest Gondwana-derived microcontinents with Cadomian relics. Testifying to the evolution at the Gondwana margin, at least since the Cambrian, such pieces took part in the birth of the Rheic Ocean. After the separation of Avalonia, the remaining Gondwana border was continuously transformed through crustal extension with contemporaneous separation of continental blocks composing future Pangea, but the opening of Palaeotethys had only a reduced significance since the Devonian. The Variscan evolution in the External domain is characterised by an early HP-evolution with subsequent granulitic decompression melts. During Visean crustal shortening, the areas of future formation of migmatites and intrusion of monzodioritic magmas in a general strike-slip regime, were probably in <b>a</b> <b>lower</b> <b>plate</b> situation, whereas the so called monometamorphic areas may have been in an upper plate position of the nappe pile. During the Latest Carboniferous, the emplacement of the youngest granites was associated with the strike-slip faulting and crustal extension at lower crustal levels, whereas, at the surface, detrital sediments accumulated in intramontaneous transtensional basins on a strongly eroded surface.

40|$|Combining {{information}} from onshore and offshore Mid-Norway, we propose a structural {{model for the}} Scandinavian North Atlantic passive margin from Permo-Carboniferous through Present. We re-examine the role of post-Permo-Carboniferous normal faults and define an innermost boundary fault system forming the continentward limit of the rifted margin. Crustal-scale cross-sections of the Greenland-Norway passive margins show the asymmetric nature of crustal extension between the two conjugate margins. On both margins the upper plate/lower plate geometry and the dip of major extensional normal faults change across the broad width of the Jan Mayen Fracture Zone. South of this zone on the Møre Margin (Norway), the dip of the major faults is towards the west, defining <b>a</b> <b>lower</b> <b>plate</b> – tilted block margin. North of the transform on the Vøring-Trøndelag Margin (Norway), the major faults dip to the east, defining an upper plate or flexural margin. In the Norwegian passive margin, the transition occurs as a progressive change of vergence of normal faults between the northern Vøring-Trøndelag Platform area and the Møre Basin. The model shows continuous separation between the two conjugate margins of Greenland and Norway, starting with a very tight fit in Late Permian time. The rifting events between Late Permian and Late Cretaceous {{are associated with a}} broadly WSW-ENE- to W-E- oriented extension while Late Cretaceous to Early Tertiary extension directions are oriented NNW-SSE. These plate separation directions and the subsequent plate motion can be related to the important basin development within, and probably, to the structural evolution and geometry of, the conjugate passive margins...|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} results of 44 new heat flow {{stations}} which were taken in 1984 and 1989 in profiles across the Goban Spur and Galicia Bank continental margins (NW Atlantic Ocean). Simple extensional models indicate that the heat flow across both these Early Cretaceous rifted margins should increase from values of 45 - 50 mW/m 2 over oceanic crust to 65 - 80 mW/m 2 on the continents. The rate of this increase should help to constrain the mechanism (simple versus pure shear) by which the upper, more radiogenic continental crust is thinned. Measurements across Goban Spur increase from values of 40 - 45 mW/m 2 over oceanic crust to 50 - 55 mW/m 2 near the continental shelf. They follow the predicted trend for pure-shear rifting, {{but only if the}} value of upper crustal radiogenic heating is low (1 - 2 -mu-W/m 3). Otherwise, they would require the upper crust to thin more rapidly than the total crustal thickness, as with <b>a</b> <b>lower</b> <b>plate,</b> simple-shear margin. Measurements across Galicia Bank show a very different pattern, with similar values over oceanic crust but much lower values (30 - 35 mW/m 2) nearer land. This is difficult to reconcile with any simple, single rifting event but is more compatible with an origin as a pure-shear or lower plate rather than upper plate margin. We also note that oceanic values of heat flow require asthenospheric temperatures 100 -degrees-C lower than normal for both margins. This indicates that the triple junction in existence between these margin segments during the breakup of Iberia, Europe, and North America was not the site of a major mantle plume...|$|E

The proposed redesigned bracket consists of mounts for attachment to the ET wall, supports for the electronic/instrument cables and propellant repressurization lines that run along the ET, an upper plate, <b>a</b> <b>lower</b> <b>plate,</b> and complex bolted connections. The eight nominal bolted connections are considered critical in the summarized structural analysis. Each bolted connection contains a bolt, a nut, four washers, and a non-metallic spacer and block that are designed for thermal insulation.

Because of the complexities associated with accurately modeling the bolted connections in the bracket, the analysis is performed using a global/local analysis procedure. The finite element analysis of the bracket identifies one of the eight bolted connections as having high stress concentrations. A local area of the bracket surrounding this bolted connection is extracted from the global model and used as a local model. Within the local model, the various components of the bolted connection are refined, and contact is introduced along the appropriate interfaces determined by the analysts. The deformations from the global model are applied as boundary conditions to the local model. The results from the global/local analysis show that while the stresses in the bolts are well within yield, the spacers fail due to compression. The primary objective of the interim structural analysis is to show concept viability for static thermal testing. The proposed design concept would undergo continued design optimization to address the identified analytical assumptions and concept shortcomings, assuming successful thermal testing...|$|E
