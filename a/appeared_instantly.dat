60|$|The cottage stood {{about two-thirds}} of the way down a straggling street, which was quite empty, for Bryngelly slept after dinner on Sunday. At the top of this street {{appeared}} Elizabeth, a Bible in her hand, as though on district visiting intent. She looked down the street, and seeing nobody, went for a little walk, then, returning, once more looked down the street. This time she was rewarded. The door of the Llewellyns' cottage opened, and Beatrice <b>appeared.</b> <b>Instantly</b> Elizabeth withdrew to such a position that she could see without being seen, and, standing as though irresolute, awaited events. Beatrice turned and took the road that led to the beach.|$|E

6000|$|I {{am afraid}} that the Young People will think I am telling them too much about swimming. But in the Boy's Town the boys really led a kind of amphibious life, {{and as long as}} the long summer lasted they were almost as much in the water as on the land. The Basin, however, unlike the river, had a winter as well as a summer climate, and one of the very first things that my boy could {{remember}} was being on the ice there, when a young man caught him up into his arms, and skated off with him almost as far away as the canal. He remembered the fearful joy of the adventure, and the pride, too; for he had somehow the notion that this young fellow was handsome and fine, and did him an honor by his notice--so soon does some dim notion of worldly splendor turn us into snobs! The next thing was his own attempt at skating, when he was set down from the bank by his brother, full of a vainglorious confidence in his powers, and <b>appeared</b> <b>instantly</b> to strike on the top of his head. Afterwards he learned to skate, but he did not know when, any more than he knew just the moment of learning to read or to swim. He became passionately fond of skating, and kept at it all day long when there was ice for it, which was not often in those soft winters. They made a very little ice go a long way in the Boy's Town; and began to use it for skating as soon as there was a glazing of it on the Basin. None of them ever got drowned there; though a boy would often start from one bank and go flying to the other, trusting his speed to save him, while the thin sheet sank and swayed, but never actually broke under him. Usually the ice was not thick enough to have a fire built on it; and it must have been on ice which was just strong enough to bear that my boy skated all one bitter afternoon at Old River, without a fire to warm by. At first his feet were very cold, and then they gradually felt less cold, and at last he did not feel them at all. He thought this very nice, and he told one of the big boys. [...] "Why, your feet are frozen!" [...] said the big boy, and he dragged off my boy's skates, and the little one ran all the long mile home, crazed with terror, and not knowing what moment his feet might drop off there in the road. His mother plunged them in a bowl of ice-cold water, and then rubbed them with flannel, and so thawed them out; but that could not save him from the pain of their coming to: it was intense, and there must have been a time afterwards when he did not use his feet.|$|E

I finished the music at a sound-check somewhere in Europe.

Plotting data out, reinterpreting it, and watching it emerge from an experiment, or long-term study, is to me as edifying as deconstructing a Shakespearean sonnet, or composing an Adagio for the piano. Several of my mates have similar addictions. One of them fondly recalls a conference when he was sitting between myself and another data-addict during a post-lunch Plenary speech; repeated slides of squabbling and copulating sea birds sent us off to a happier place, until about 30 min into the talk a data-slide <b>appeared.</b> <b>Instantly,</b> we both woke up, copied down the data, and promptly fell back to sleep.

50|$|Less exotic phase-changes may {{contribute}} to the heat-capacity of substances and systems, as well, as (for example) when water is converted back and forth from solid to liquid or gas form. Phase changes store heat energy entirely in breaking the bonds of the potential energy interactions between molecules of a substance. As in the case of hydrogen, it is also possible for phase changes to be hindered as the temperature drops, thus they do not catch up and become apparent, without a catalyst. For example, it is possible to supercool liquid water to below the freezing point, and not observe the heat evolved when the water changes to ice, so long as the water remains liquid. This heat <b>appears</b> <b>instantly</b> when the water freezes.|$|R

40|$|Hypertext is a computer-supported {{medium for}} {{information}} {{in which many}} interlinked documents are displayed with their links on a high-resolution computer screen. The links may be directly activated by a pointing device such as a mouse, which causes the document referenced by the link to <b>appear</b> <b>instantly</b> in a new window on the screen.

This paper reviews most of the existing hypertext systems, and then explores in some detail the fundamental features of hypertext {{and some of the}} design options in constructing hypertext systems. The advantages and disadvantages of hypertext are discussed in terms of four major application categories: macro literary systems, problem exploration systems, structured browsing systems, and systems developed to explore hypertext technology.

50|$|One of the easy-to-use {{conventions}} of oneSIS {{is that all}} configuration settings for all nodes within a cluster are controlled by a single file on the master node, /etc/sysimage. This file is used to list the machines in the cluster, define which machines belong to what class, and explains which classes boot which images from the NFSroot server and how their configuration settings differ. Changes applied to the master images <b>appear</b> <b>instantly</b> to the nodes using said images. Changing a node to boot into a different image only requires a quick modification to /etc/sysimage and a reboot of the target client. Since oneSIS was designed with the Linux-systems administrator in mind, users will not find proprietary-GUI frontends here; all the tools to image a box, copying root-images, converting diskless machines diskfull, etc. are accessible exclusively through the command line interface (CLI). The goal is to let Linux systems administrators feel {{at home with the}} typical CLI tools they're already used to.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{show how}} {{optimization}} methods from economics known as portfolio strategies {{can be used}} for minimizing download times in the Internet and travel times in freeway traffic. While for Internet traffic, there is an optimal restart frequency for requesting data, freeway traffic can be optimized by a small percentage of vehicles coming from on-ramps. Interestingly, the portfolio strategies can decrease the average waiting or travel times, respectively, as well as their standard deviation (“risk”). In general, portfolio strategies are applicable to systems, in which the distribution of the quantity to be optimized is broad. Virtual Traffic in the World Wide Web Anyone who has browsed the World Wide Web has probably discovered the following strategy: whenever a web page takes too long to appear, it is useful to press the reload button.
