40|$|This paper {{examines}} the distributional effects {{of international trade}} in a general equilibrium model with heterogeneous agents and a welfare state redistributing income.

40|$|Background: In Switzerland, age is the {{predominant}} driver of solidarity transfers in risk adjustment (RA). Concerns have been voiced regarding growing imbalances in cost sharing between {{young and old}} insured due to demographic changes (larger fraction of elderly > 65 years and rise in average age). Particularly young adults aged 19 – 25 with limited incomes have to shoulder increasing solidarity burdens. Between 1996 and 2011, monthly inter generational solidarity payments for young adults have doubled from CHF 87 to CHF 182, which corresponds to the highest <b>absolute</b> <b>transfer</b> increase of all age groups. Results: By constructing models for age-specific RA growth and for calculating the lifetime sum of RA transfers we investigated the causes and consequences of demographic changes on RA payments.

40|$|Private {{wealth is}} a crucial factor for the {{economic}} well-being of households. Key determinants of private wealth include intergenerational wealth transfers (gifts and inheritances), which are gaining importance since 1990, as research suggests. We conduct a detailed investigation {{of the distribution of}} wealth transfers in eight Euro-area countries. First, we investigate the patterns of prevalence and level of past wealth transfers in the individual countries: Who received transfers, and what is their present value in absolute terms? We find that in most countries the percentages of households with a transfer as well as the mean present value of those transfers is increasing along the distribution of net wealth. Using a series of country-specific multivariate regressions, we find that households with higher income and education levels have both a higher probability of receiving transfers and higher <b>absolute</b> <b>transfer</b> value. We then analyze the present value of transfers as a percent of current net worth. Here, in relative terms, some of the results are reversed, as the relative importance of intergenerational transfers does not increase with the level of wealth or income. Using a fractional logit regression we conclude that for higher income quintiles the share of current net worth due to past intergenerational transfers tends to be decreasing...|$|E
40|$|Species-rich {{semi-natural}} grasslands play {{an essential}} role in the conservation of European biodiversity. To restore them, existing grasslands may be used as a seed source. A key factor for successful restoration is the transfer of all species of the plant community to the site being restored. This approach, however, often poses practical problems due to variations in species phenology, so that only time-staggered harvesting allows the seeds of many species to be collected. Poor harvesting methods may reduce the number of species transferred from the donor to recipient site. The effects of harvesting at various time points by various methods were evaluated here in a restoration experiment on an ex-arable field in Northern Italy. Propagation materials from the first or second regrowth (or both) of a meadow dominated by Arrhenatherum elatius were collected by four harvesting methods. The materials were spread at the sowing density between 830 and 14360 seeds m 2. Species composition and structure of the vegetation were examined during 6 years. Untransferred species were almost exclusively those not present at harvesting as mature seed.

40|$|In {{the first}} part of the paper we report {{estimated}} transfers in the Social Security system for the Retirement History Survey sample. We define transfers to be the difference between the expected presentvalue of benefits less the present value of taxes paid in, where the latter is adjusted for the probability of living to reach retirement age. Unlike previous researchers we, therefore, account for the taxes paid by people who died before retirement, and it turns out this adjustment is important for some groups. The Retirement History Survey cohort will receive large transfers: roughly benefits will be about four times taxes,and the real internal rate of return will be about eight percent. We study how transfers vary by a comprehensive measure of wealth. People in the highest wealth quartile have the largest <b>absolute</b> <b>transfers,</b> and their internal rate of return is as high as that of any wealth quartile. In the second part of the paper we study transfers forsix synthetic cohorts, the heads of which are age 65 in the ten-year intervals 1970 through 2020. Within each cohort 12 families are defined according to earnings levels. We find that transfers are positive and large for the 1970 cohort, and that they decline steadily until they are negative for most groups in the 2020 cohort. Although high earners initially have the largest transfers in the 1970 cohort, they have the largest negative transfers in the 2020 cohort. ...|$|R

40|$|Coherent {{population}} transfer between vibrational {{levels of the}} NO molecule induced by the interaction of two delayed laser pulses, {{also referred to as}} stimulated Raman scattering involving adiabatic passage (STIRAP), is studied experimentally in a molecular beam and in the bulk. The consequences of hyperfine splitting and Doppler broadening are discussed in detail. Unlike in previous studies of this kind, transfer occurs simultaneously between more than one group of non degenerate levels. In a molecular beam or in the bulk, the transfer efficiency of STIRAP exceeds that obtained by Stimulated Emission Pumping (SEP) by a factor of 3. 6 or 15, respectively. We estimate the <b>absolute</b> <b>transfer</b> efficiency T in the beam to be T ≈ 60 %, while T ≈ 18 % is found in the bulk. In both cases, this is 60 % of the maximum value expected from numerical studies. Possible reasons for this discrepancy are discussed.

40|$|The {{increasing}} use of nanoparticles {{in products}} likely results in increased exposure of both workers and consumers. Because of their small size, there are concerns that nanoparticles unintentionally cross the barriers of the human body. Several in vivo rodent studies show that, dependent on the exposure route, time, and concentration, and their characteristics, nanoparticles can cross the lung, gut, skin, and placental barrier. This review aims to evaluate the performance of in vitro models that mimic the barriers of the human body, {{with a focus on}} the lung, gut, skin, and placental barrier. For these barriers, in vitro models of varying complexity are available, ranging from singlecell- type monolayer to multi-cell (3 D) models. Only a few studies are available that allow comparison of the in vitro translocation to in vivo data. This situation could change since the availability of analytical detection techniques is no longer a limiting factor for this comparison. We conclude that to further develop in vitro models to be used in risk assessment, the current strategy to improve the models to more closely mimic the human situation by using cocultures of different cell types and microfluidic approaches to better control the tissue microenvironments are essential. At {{the current state of the}} art, the in vitro models do not yet allow prediction of <b>absolute</b> <b>transfer</b> rates but they do support the definition of relative transfer rates and can thus help to reduce animal testing by setting priorities for subsequent in vivo testing...|$|E
40|$|Current medical {{diagnostic}} echo systems are mostly using harmonic imaging. This {{means that a}} fundamental frequency (e. g., 2 MHz) is transmitted and the reflected and scattered higher harmonics (e. g., 4 and 6 MHz), produced by nonlinear propagation, are recorded. The signal level of these harmonics is usually low and a well-defined transfer function of the receiving transducer is required. Studying the acoustic response of a single contrast bubble, which has an amplitude {{in the order of}} a few Pascal, is another area where an optimal receive transfer function is important. We have developed three methods to determine the <b>absolute</b> <b>transfer</b> function of a transducer. The first is based on a well-defined wave generated by a calibrated source in the far field. The receiving transducer receives the calibrated wave and from this the transfer functions can be calculated. The second and third methods are based on the reciprocity of the transducer. The second utilizes a calibrated hydrophone to measure the transmitted field. In the third method, a pulse is transmitted by the transducer, which impinges on a reflector and is received again by the same transducer. In both methods, the response combined with the transducer impedance and beam profiles enables the calculation of the transfer function. The proposed methods are useful to select the optimal piezoelectric material (PZT, single crystal) for transducers used in reception only, such as in certain 3 D scanning designs and superharmonic imaging, and for selected experiments like single bubble behavior. We tested and compared these methods on two unfocused single element transducers, one commercially available (radius 6. 35 mm, centre frequency 2. 25 MHz) the other custom built (radius 0. 75 mm, centre frequency 4. 3 MHz).

Concerns have been voiced regarding growing imbalances in cost sharing between {{young and old}} insured due to demographic changes (larger fraction of elderly > 65 years and rise in average age). Particularly young adults aged 19 - 25 with limited incomes have to shoulder increasing solidarity burdens. Between 1996 and 2011, monthly intergenerational solidarity payments for young adults have doubled from CHF 87 to CHF 182, which corresponds to the highest <b>absolute</b> <b>transfer</b> increase of all age groups. Results: By constructing models for age-specific RA growth and for calculating the lifetime sum of RA transfers we investigated the causes and consequences of demographic changes on RA payments. The models suggest that the main driver for RA increases in the past was below average health care expenditure (HCE) growth in young adults, which was only half as high (average 2 % per year) compared with older adults (average 4 % per year). Shifts in age group distributions were only accountable for 2 % of the CHF 95 rise in RA payments. Despite rising risk adjustment debts for young insured the balance of lifetime transfers remains positive as long as HCE growth rates are greater than the discount rate used in this model (3 %). Moreover, the life-cycle model predicts that the lifetime {{rate of return on}} RA payments may even be further increased by demographic changes. Nevertheless, continued growth of RA contributions may overwhelm vulnerable age groups such as young adults. We therefore propose methods to limit the burden of social health insurance for specific age groups (e. g. young adults in Switzerland) by capping solidarity payments. Conclusions: Taken together, our mathematical modelling framework helps {{to gain a better understanding}} of how demographic changes interact with risk adjustment and how redistribution of funds between age groups can be controlled without inducing further selection incentives.

40|$|What {{is already}} known on this subject?Various {{measures}} {{have been used in}} quantifying health inequities among populations in recent times; most of these measures were derived to capture the socioeconomic inequalities in health. These different measures do not always lend themselves to common interpretation by policy makers and health managers because they each reflect limited aspects of the concept of health inequities. What does this study add?To inform a more appropriate application of the different measures currently used in quantifying health inequities, this article explicates common theories underlying the definition of health inequities and uses this understanding to show the utility and limitations of these different measures. It also suggests some key features of an ideal indicator based on the conceptual understanding, with the hope of influencing future efforts in developing more robust measures of health inequities. The article also provides a conceptual ‘product label’ for the common measures of health inequities to guide users and ‘consumers’ in making more robust inferences and conclusions. This paper examines common approaches for quantifying health inequities and assesses {{the extent to which they}} incorporate key theories necessary for explicating the definition of health inequity. The first theoretical analysis examined the distinction between inter-individual and inter-group health inequalities as measures of health inequities. The second analysis considered the notion of fairness in health inequalities from different philosophical perspectives. To understand the extent to which different measures of health inequities incorporate these theoretical explanations, four criteria were used to assess each measure: 1) Does the indicator demonstrate inter-group or inter-individual health inequalities or both; 2) Does it reflect health inequalities in relation to socioeconomic position; 3) Is it sensitive to the <b>absolute</b> <b>transfer</b> of health (outcomes, services, or both) or income/wealth between groups; 4) Could it be used to capture inequalities in relation to other population groupings (other than socioeconomic status) ? The measures assessed include: before and after measures within only the disadvantaged population, range, Gini coefficient, Pseudo-Gini coefficient, index of dissimilarity, concentration index, slope and relative indices of inequality, and regression techniques. None of these measures satisfied all the four criteria, except the range. Whereas each measure quantifies a different perspective in health inequities, using a measure within only the disadvantaged population does not measure health inequities in a meaningful way, even using before and after changes. For a more complete assessment of how programs affect health inequities, it may be useful to use more than one measure...|$|E
40|$|Background. The healthy worker effect (HWE) is {{a source}} of bias in {{occupational}} studies of mortality among workers caused by use of comparative disease rates based on public data, which include mortality of unhealthy members of the public who are screened out of the workplace. For the US astronaut corp, the HWE is assumed to be strong due to the rigorous medical selection and surveillance. This investigation focused on the effect of correcting for HWE on projected lifetime risk estimates for radiation-induced cancer mortality and incidence. Methods. We performed radiation-induced cancer risk assessment using Poisson regression of cancer mortality and incidence rates among Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bomb survivors. Regression coefficients were used for generating risk coefficients for the excess <b>absolute,</b> <b>transfer,</b> and excess relative models. Excess lifetime risks (ELR) for radiation exposure and baseline lifetime risks (BLR) were adjusted for the HWE using standardized mortality ratios (SMR) for aviators and nuclear workers who were occupationally exposed to ionizing radiation. We also adjusted lifetime risks by cancer mortality misclassification among atomic bomb survivors. Results. For all cancers combined (“Nonleukemia”), the effect of adjusting the all-cause hazard rate by the simulated quantiles of the all-cause SMR resulted in a mean difference (not percent difference) in ELR of 0. 65 % and mean difference of 4 % for mortality BLR, and mean change of 6. 2 % in BLR for incidence. The effect of adjusting the excess (radiation-induced) cancer rate or baseline cancer hazard rate by simulated quantiles of cancer-specific SMRs resulted in a mean difference of − 1. 2 % in the all-cancer mortality ELR and mean difference of − 6. 4 % in the mortality BLR. Whereas for incidence, the effect of adjusting by cancer-specific SMRs resulted in a mean change of − 14. 4 % for the all-cancer BLR. Only cancer mortality risks were adjusted by simulated quantiles for misclassification, and results indicate a mean change of 1. 1 % for all-cancer mortality ELR, while the mean change in the all-cancer PC was approximately 4 % for males and 6 % for females. Conclusions. The typical life table approach for projecting lifetime risk of radiation-induced cancer mortality and incidence for astronauts and radiation workers can be improved by adjusting for HWE while simulating the uncertainty of input rates, input excess risk coefficients, and bias correction factors during multiple Monte Carlo realizations of the life table...|$|E

Using the ion-atom merged-beams apparatus at Oak Ridge National Laboratory <b>absolute</b> charge <b>transfer</b> cross sections for D 2 + + H are measured from keV/u collision energies where the collision is considered “ro-vibrationally frozen ” to meV/u energies where collision times are long enough to sample vibrational and rotational modes. The measurements benchmark high energy theory and vibrationally specific adiabatic theory. Charge transfer (CT) for H 2 + on H is of special interest because of its contribution to H 2 formation in the early universe, its exoergicity, and rich collision dynamics. Experimental investigations are surprisingly sparse and generally limited to higher collision energies. CT proceeds through dynamically coupled electronic, vibrational and rotational degrees of freedom. One can depict three paths, electroni...|$|R
