40|$|ABSTRACT Background: In case of pathologies or {{accidents}} {{on board}} which require medical intervention but lacking on-board medical or paramedical personnel, the ship’s captain, or his delegate can contact a Telemedical Maritime Assistance Service (TMAS). International Maritime Organisation considers telemedicine at sea {{as an integral}} part of rescue procedures. Five key elements contribute to the delivery of good medical assistance at sea: one or more coordination and rescue centres; the TMAS; the possibility of intervention at sea; an organisation of appropriate institutions on ground and common operating procedures. This paper analyses the responsibility of the ship’s captain and of the TMAS doctor in case of diseases or injuries on board in the frame of the main important international regulations. Responsibility of the ship captain: In case of a disease or injury on board a ship, the captain must contact the TMAS as soon as possible. A captain not acting promptly and not doing whatever it is possible for the ill/injured person by consulting the TMAS or a physician and/or not following prescriptions received, could be charged for omission of responsibility. A captain underestimating a medical problem and knowing that the patient’s condition could worsen, but still not consulting a medical centre for assistance, should be ready to accept the consequences of his choices. Responsibility of the physician: The doctor of TMAS has full responsibility for the diagnosis, prescription and treatment, while the ship’s captain is responsible for the final decision. Regarding the medical treatment and <b>assistance</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> a ship, the TMAS doctor should pay attention not only for the diagnosis, but also for the prognosis. Telemedicine implies that the doctor should make decisions without a clinical examination, often without some additional medical examinations and by maintaining a contact with other people who are in direct contact with the patient. The physician usually has to rely on the account of colleagues of the sick seafarer as far as medical history is concerned. This may make harder to take a decision. Conclusions: The ship’s captain is guilty if he fails to contact a TMAS in case of diseases or accidents on board. Similar to a traditional relationship between a patient and a physician, the doctor consulted via telecommunication systems is also responsible for his diagnosis and treatment. However, in telemedicine the contrasts with the most basic principles of the traditional medicine are obvious. This makes the delivery of medical care of seafarers on board ships quite complicated...|$|E
40|$|Medical <b>assistance</b> {{by doctors}} <b>on</b> <b>board</b> an {{aircraft}} The number of in-flight medical emergencies {{continues to increase}} due to {{the rise in the}} number of (older) passengers, the greater capacity of new airplanes and the constant increases in the distances flown. The most common medical problems <b>on</b> <b>board</b> an aircraft are vasovagal collapse, dizziness, and gastro-intestinal and cardiac complaints. According to Dutch law, a physician <b>on</b> <b>board</b> an aircraft is obliged to deliver medical assistance in case of a medical emergency involving a passenger if requested by the cabin crew. The chances of being involved in a lawsuit afterwards are, however, very small because the usual medical standards do not apply and because the patient usually does not know the doctor that has assisted him. Even if it should come to a legal procedure, the chance that a physician will be found guilty of malpractice is very small because of the special circumstances and limitations in an airplan...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{purpose of this}} thesis {{was to develop a}} methodology for investigating whether it is feasible and cost effective to transition military billets <b>on</b> <b>board</b> a typical Marine Corps base to civilian personnel. The methodology is broken down into two phases. The first phase [...] billet identification procedure [...] establishes a "combat essential" criterion used for determining whether a billet is eligible for further civilianization analysis. To be eligible a billet must not contain any of the seven characteristics that are associated with the "combat essential" criterion. After all eligible billets are identified, in the second phase the military cost factors along with the appropriate civilian cost factors for each billet are identified. The military and civilian cost factors are then compared and recommendations for or against civilianization are made. Phase One described above was applied to the Fleet <b>Assistance</b> Program (FAP) <b>on</b> <b>board</b> Camp Pendleton, California. and Phase Two was applied specifically to the base Clubs System within the FAP.

40|$|Maritime Pilots and Vessel Traffic Services (VTS) {{operators}} work {{to improve}} the safety of navigation of seagoing vessels. As in many other safety-critical domains, work is increasingly characterised by the integration and dissemination of information between humans and technology, across disciplines and over multiple geographical locations. Technological advancements such as e-navigation facilitate increased monitoring and control from shore and create new possibilities to provide additional <b>assistance</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> vessels. E-navigation has thus {{a direct impact on}} navigational assistance as performed by pilots and VTS operators. This thesis views navigational assistance as a case of sociotechnical work in a safety-critical domain. It attempts to understand how work is performed and how it contributes to maritime safety by starting from empirical observation and a Resilience Engineering focus on everyday operations. Interviews, focus groups and field observations on board vessels and in VTS centres were conducted and analysed using an iterative approach, inspired by the principles of grounded theory and the Functional Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM) and informed by the traditions of Workplace Studies, Science and Technology Studies and Activity Theory. A generic FRAM model of navigational assistance was developed to describe the practice of everyday work and how the conditions which affect its performance may vary. A scenario and case study were also analysed and modelled to illustrate how safety may manifest itself in typical and actual events. Successful assistance was found to be dependent on: (i) the use of local knowledge, preparation and foresight to integrate information {{from a wide range of}} sources, and; (ii) communication and trust between the pilot, VTS operator, and the master and crew of the vessel, to provide timely assistance to vessels. FRAM was found to be a valuable tool for describing sociotechnical work, but was enriched by borrowing from the work studies traditions, with their strong grounding in empirical observations and themes of 'making work visible', symmetry between human/non-human, and work as activity. This approach indicated that bringing ideas from different traditions together to understand a real work practice may bring us closer to describing 'work as done', and its contribution to safe everyday operations. This thesis concludes that safety is an emergent property of sociotechnical work, which manifests itself through the interaction between humans and other actors in the context in which work is performed. The configuration of a sociotechnical system is not necessarily pre-defined, but is dependent on the human, technological, organisational and natural factors which affect the performance of work. It is inherently uncertain, variable and must adapt to circumstances. In order to inform the design of new systems or evaluate the impact of new technologies, one should therefore take account of the factors which affect how work is normally performed, and also how it is actually performed in specific circumstances to enable safe operations...|$|E
