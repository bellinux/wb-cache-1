500|$|Following {{the success}} of GoldenEye in {{reviving}} the Bond series, there was pressure to recreate that success in the film's follow-up production. This pressure came from MGM along with its new owner, billionaire Kirk Kerkorian, both of whom wished for the film's release to coincide with their public stock offering. Co-producer Michael G. Wilson also expressed concern regarding the public's expectations subsequent to {{the success of}} GoldenEye, commenting: [...] "You realize that there's a huge audience <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> don't want to come out with a film that's going to somehow disappoint them." [...] This was the first Bond film to be made after the death of Albert R. Broccoli, who had previously been involved with the series' production since its beginning. The rush to complete the film drove the budget to $110 million. The producers were unable to persuade Martin Campbell, the director of GoldenEye, to return; his agent said that [...] "Martin just didn't want to do two Bond films in a row." [...] Instead, Roger Spottiswoode was chosen in September 1996. Spottiswoode said he had previously offered to direct a Bond film while Timothy Dalton was still in the leading role.|$|E
2500|$|Gibson {{described}} his character Guy, saying, “He's not a silver-tongued devil. He's kind of immature {{and he has}} some rough edges <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> {{could say the same}} for me.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Gibson was {{initially}} reluctant {{to accept the}} role of Guy Hamilton. [...] "I didn't necessarily see my role as a great challenge. My character was, like the film suggests, a puppet. And I went with that. It wasn't some star thing, even though they advertised it that way." [...] Gibson saw some similarities {{between himself and the}} character of Guy. [...] "He's not a silver-tongued devil. He's kind of immature and he has some rough edges <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> could say the same for me." [...] Gibson has cited this screen performance as his personal favorite.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Jimmy, with {{a little}} laugh, [...] "I don't quite know. There were, you see, several reasons. To begin with, I had {{to come out of}} the mail-boat for my year's training, and when that was over there were a good many men on the Company's list to be worked off before they wanted me again. Trade is slack over there, and it seemed wiser to await my turn. After all, it doesn't cost so much to come across second-class <b>and</b> Colonist; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> <b>you</b> would be glad to see me." ...|$|R
6000|$|Well--how was {{the glen}} made? <b>You</b> shall <b>guess</b> it if <b>you</b> like, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> will <b>guess</b> too. <b>You</b> think, perhaps, that an {{earthquake}} opened it? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If you're bent {{on making}} {{a fool of}} yourself, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> can't help it, go on your own way," [...] {{interposed}} Shackleby, with ironical contempt.|$|E
6000|$|... "Pshaw! I know you, Jake Wilkinson, {{better than}} Bob does. You meant {{to make him}} drunk this evening and empty his wallet, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> didn't find it hard." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I was. We stepped {{behind the}} rocks {{to find out}} what sort of men you were. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> are just our kind," [...] added Merwell, with a sickly grin.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{knew your}} funny sneeze, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> that <b>you</b> {{came to see}} how I did, though it is very late. Don't be worried, I'm better now, {{and it is my}} fault I was ill, not yours; for I needn't have been so silly as to wait in the cold just because I said I would." ...|$|R
5000|$|Introducing the song, Springsteen {{said about}} Zakim, [...] "... I knew {{him a little}} bit during {{the last year of his}} life, he was one of those people whose, intensity, inner spirit you could feel even when he was very ill <b>and</b> uh. ... <b>I</b> <b>guess,</b> <b>you</b> know, we honor his memory {{obviously}} not with this beautiful bridge, very lovely, but by continuing on in his fight for social justice." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then," [...] he said, [...] "it {{must be as}} <b>you</b> wish. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess,</b> {{after what}} <b>you</b> have told me, we hold Merril in our hand. That is, if Jimmy <b>and</b> <b>I</b> can do our part." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Keep it up--put it on! Don't hurry {{about getting}} well. I don't {{need you to}} canvass, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> enjoy being waited on." [...] He ended with a sly wink and cough.|$|E
6000|$|... "Keep it up--put it on! Don't {{get up in}} a hurry. I don't {{need you}} to canvass, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> enjoy this 'bout as well." [...] He ended with a sly wink and cough.|$|E
6000|$|... “No,” said Clay. “Your partner’s {{pretty smart}} <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> have got it safely {{locked up in}} one of the Island ports. The chances are that you won’t be able to give it to me.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Peter defiantly, [...] "if {{your own}} father {{had run away}} when you was a baby, and left your mother to earn her living by washing <b>and</b> working out, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> wouldn't care much about him either." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Down cellar, an' you needn't take on no airs, ol' woman. I've {{known you}} to buy things you didn't need time an' time 'n' agin, tins <b>and</b> things, an' <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> wish you had back that ten dollars you paid for that {{illustrated}} Bible." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I am--one of them. There {{are two of}} us, <b>you</b> know; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> can <b>guess</b> who <b>you</b> are--you are Captain Niel, whom uncle {{is expecting}} {{to help him with}} the farm and the ostriches." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now," [...] said Paddy, [...] "I'll {{build the}} walls, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> can't help me much with those. I'm {{going to begin}} them {{tomorrow}} night. Perhaps you will like to see me do it, Cousin Jerry." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, pshaw! {{perhaps it}} was {{somebody}} {{who was trying to}} spy on us," [...] put in Fred. [...] "If we tell the captain we will only be exposing ourselves, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> all know what that means." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is good," [...] mumbled Drummer, pecking {{away at the}} suet greedily. [...] "Come on, Tommy Tit. Don't {{wait for}} me, for I won't be through for a long time. I'm nearly starved, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> must be." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{all know}} that, yet {{most of us}} are just foolish enough to make such a wish now <b>and</b> then. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> have done it. I know I have. Peter Rabbit has done it often and then laughed at himself afterwards. I suspect that even shrewd, clever old Granny Fox has been guilty of it more than once. So it is not {{surprising}} that Reddy Fox, terribly hungry as he was, should do a little foolish wishing.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was just}} {{the right thing to}} do, Dave," [...] was Ben's comment. [...] "But I don't know that I would have thought of it. You are a quick thinker, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> we have <b>you</b> to thank for saving our lives." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{beg your}} pardon," [...] {{he said the}} next moment. [...] "No, it was not easy. <b>And</b> now <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> can go away. You've got all you wanted out of me. But {{let me tell you}} this before you go. It won't do you any good to repeat {{anything}} I've said. I'll deny it, and there are no witnesses. I'll deny every word of it; <b>and</b> if <b>I</b> have to, I'll do it under oath on the witness stand." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I won't, Nie. I {{promise you}} that. I don't {{want to drive}} you to anything. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> know ten times as well {{what you want to}} do, as I do, anyway. I ain't going to worry you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We're old friends, Susan, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> {{mean to be}} kind; but I've {{been warned}} before, and it didn't affect me much," [...] he said. [...] "If Ida {{wants to go back}} with you she may, but we'll leave it at that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll {{see about}} that," [...] he said. [...] "I {{never had much}} faith in you, sir, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> only got the job by a rig. But out you go now, sharp. If there's {{anything}} owing you, you can claim it in London.|$|E
5000|$|According to Roger Greenspun, [...] "the ads {{say that}} the time is just right for an out-and-out thriller like this, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> that <b>you</b> are {{supposed}} {{to think that a}} good old kind of movie has none too soon come around again. But The French Connection...is in fact a very good new kind of movie, and that in spite of its being composed of such ancient material as cops and crooks, with thrills and chases, and lots of shoot-'em-up." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{album was}} {{streamed}} on The Guardians website {{ahead of its}} release. It received a positive review from Clash magazine that described it as [...] "an impressive performance from a singer still riding high", although The Quietus wrote in contrast: [...] "for all the show's heft as an epochal, history-making-moment-in-time, and Kelis as an incredible, inimitable <b>and</b> malleable performer, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> really {{had to have been}} there".|$|R
6000|$|He looked anxiously into March's face, with {{a gentle}} smile of mixed hope and doubt, and March said: [...] "As sure as it's Berthold Lindau, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> it's <b>you.</b> <b>And</b> you {{remember}} the old times? You were {{as much of a}} boy as I was, Lindau. Are you living in New York? Do you recollect how you tried to teach me to fence? I don't know how to this day, Lindau. How good you were, and how patient! Do you remember how we used to sit up in the little parlor back of your printing-office, and read Die Rauber and Die Theilung der Erde and Die Glocke? <b>And</b> Mrs. Lindau? <b>Is</b> she with--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "it sounds quite probable; {{but there}} are discrepancies. I'll take these things along, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> had better make for the {{homestead}} {{and ask them to}} let you in. We'll have a lively blizzard down on us very soon." ...|$|E
60|$|Bunce against Graves {{the court}} confirmed, wherefore, in {{accordance}} with your directions, I moved to have the case remanded to enable {{you to take a}} new trial in the court below. The court allowed the motion; of which I am glad, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> are.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's your affair, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> can {{settle it}} in court to-morrow. Meanwhile, come on, McMurdo, and come quietly if you don't want a gun across your head. You stand wide, Mr. McGinty; for I warn you I will stand no {{resistance}} when I am on duty!" ...|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} {{less than a}} week before the Falling Down's release, screenwriter Ebbe Roe Smith gave his interpretation of what the movie was about. [...] "To me, even though the movie deals with complicated urban issues, it really is just about one basic thing: The main character represents the old power structure of the U.S. that has now become archaic, and hopelessly lost. <b>And</b> that way, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> could say D-FENS is like Los Angeles. For both of them, it's adjust-or-die time..." ...|$|R
6000|$|Amid {{the smoke}} of cities did you pass [...] Your time of early youth, and there you learn'd, [...] From years of quiet industry, to love [...] The living Beings by your own fire-side, [...] With such a strong devotion, that your heart [...] Is slow towards the sympathies of them [...] Who look upon the hills with tenderness, [...] And make dear friendships with the streams and groves. [...] Yet we who are transgressors in this kind, [...] Dwelling retired in our {{simplicity}} [...] Among the woods and fields, we love you well, [...] Joanna! <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess,</b> since <b>you</b> have been [...] So distant from us now for two long years, [...] That you will gladly listen to discourse [...] However trivial, if you thence are taught [...] That they, with whom you once were happy, talk [...] Familiarly of you and of old times.|$|R
2500|$|LSU had 266 {{yards of}} total {{offense in the}} game and Rice {{compiled}} 144. Passing contributed to only 48 yards between both teams as the rainy conditions forced them to stick to the running game. Cannon gained 53 yards on nine carries as the game's leading rusher. The performance by LSU impressed the pollsters, who ranked the team fifteenth after being unranked prior to the game. Coach Dietzel said in the locker room after the game:"It was gratifying to score a victory over a team coached by a man that I respect as much as coach Neely. We made mistakes Saturday night [...] we made up for them in hustle <b>and</b> desire. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> can sum up what I feel about these boys in four words...I'm proud of them. I do believe that the condition of the playing field and adverse weather conditions prevented either team from finding out their true strength or weaknesses." ...|$|R
