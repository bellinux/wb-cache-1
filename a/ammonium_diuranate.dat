40|$|The {{development}} of a 0. 13 m diameter pulsed fluidised bed reactor {{for the production of}} sinterable uranium dioxide from <b>ammonium</b> <b>diuranate</b> is described. Both consecutive calcination and reduction (simple-batch operation) and simultaneous calcination and reduction (batch-continuous operation) were investigated. Sinterable uranium dioxide, giving pellet densities in excess of 10. 6 g cm- 3 after sintering at 1, 600 ºC in hydrogen for four hours, was produced by both modes of operation. The surface area of the uranium dioxide powder decreased with an increase in temperature of reduction; operating temperatures were typically 620 ºC to 630 ºC for simple-batch operation, and 670 ºC to 700 ºC for batch-continuous operation, to produce powders in the range of interest (4 to 6 m 2 g- 1). Product characteristics were relatively insensitive to changes in the other operating variables. Satisfactory powders were produced by simple-batch operation with a hydrogen concentration of 25 volume per cent, gas flow rates from 0. 95 to 1. 9 ℓ s- 1, pulse frequencies of 0. 5 to 0. 75 Hz, pulse chamber volumes of 2. 8 and 11. 3 ℓ, and either hot or cold charging of <b>ammonium</b> <b>diuranate.</b> The maximum bed of <b>ammonium</b> <b>diuranate</b> handled satisfactorily with simple-batch operation was 7 kg, and this corresponded to a maximum throughput of 5 to 6 kg h- 1 uranium dioxide. For batch-continuous operation, satisfactory powders were produced with hydrogen concentrations from 15 to 75 volume per cent, gas flow rates from 0. 95 to 1. 4 ℓ s-l, pulse frequencies of 0. 5 and 0. 75 Hz, a pulse chamber volume of 2. 8 ℓ, rates of feeding <b>ammonium</b> <b>diuranate</b> from 7 to 20 kg h- 1, and bed depth to diameter ratios of approximately 3 to 7.

40|$|The {{development}} of a 0. 13 m diameter pulsed fluidised bed reactor for the continuous production of sinterable uranium dioxide from <b>ammonium</b> <b>diuranate</b> is described. Calcination-reduction at 670 to 680 ºC produced powders with surface areas of 4 to 6 m 2 g- 1 giving pellet densities in excess of 10. 6 g cm- 3. Sinterability was relatively insensitive to changes in operating conditions, provided the availability of hydrogen was adequate, for gas flow rates in the range 0. 95 to 1. 4 ℓ s- 1, pulse frequencies of 0. 5 and 0. 75 Hz and mean residence times of the solids from 0. 6 to 1. 4 hours. Sinterability was shown to be improved either by use of higher input concentrations, or by use of a secondary flow of hydrogen (about 5 per cent of input) fed into the powder collection system and flowing countercurrent to the U 02 product. The maximum throughput of 17 kg U 02 h- 1 (0. 6 hours mean residence time) required only 120 per cent of the stoichiometric requirement at an input concentration of 50 vol. % with secondary hydrogen flow. Results are given for studies of the kinetics of reduction of calcined <b>ammonium</b> <b>diuranate</b> in hydrogen and the residence time distribution of solids in a pulsed fluidised bed. Estimates based on these data suggested that the overall conversion of <b>ammonium</b> <b>diuranate</b> to uranium dioxide in the continuously operated pulsed fluidised bed reactor was in excess of 99 per cent.

40|$|AbstractUranium metal {{used for}} {{fabrication}} of fuel for research reactors in India is generally produced by magnesio-thermic reduction of UF 4.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was an assessment of the possibility of uranium recovery from domestic resources in Poland. In the first stage uranium was leached from the ground uranium ore by using acidic (sulfuric acid or hydrochloric acid) or alkaline (carbonate) solutions. The leaching efficiencies of uranium were dependent on the type of ore and it reached 81 % for Dictyonemic shales and almost 100 % for sandstones. The novel leaching routes, with the application of the helical membrane contactor equipped with rotating part were tested. The obtained postleaching solutions were concentrated and purified using solvent extraction or ion exchange chromatography. New methods of solvent extraction, as well as hybrid processes for separation and purification of the product, were studied.
