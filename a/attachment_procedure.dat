50|$|The Court {{concluded}} that {{the constitutionality of the}} Connecticut prejudgment <b>attachment</b> <b>procedure</b> must be judged by the balancing test for due process claims described in Mathews v.

In reaching this conclusion, the Court emphasized, among other things, that no notice of the proposed attachment was given to the defendant before it was levied; that no pre-attachment hearing was provided, even though the plaintiff's perfunctory verification may provide the judge with little or no insight into the validity of the plaintiff's claim; that there was no requirement that the subject-matter of the claim be related to the real property being attached; {{and that there was no}} requirement that the plaintiff show special circumstances, such as that the defendant was seeking to evade payment of any judgment that might be awarded. The Court also observed that while an attachment of a defendant's real property did not deprive him or her of the use of the property, it nonetheless represented a significant interference with the defendant's ownership rights.|$|E
5000|$|The use of lasers in {{treating}} periodontal disease {{has been seen}} by some dental professionals as controversial. The American Academy of Periodontology stated in 1999 that it was [...] "not aware of any randomized blinded controlled longitudinal clinical trials, cohort or longitudinal studies, or case-controlled studies indicating that 'laser excisional new <b>attachment</b> <b>procedure</b> (or Laser ENAP)' or 'laser curettage' offers any advantageous clinical result not achieved by traditional periodontal therapy. Moreover, published studies suggest that use of lasers for ENAP procedures and/or gingival curettage could render root surfaces and adjacent alveolar bone incompatible with normal cell attachment and healing." [...] A 2015 systematic review from the AAP regeneration workshop acknowledged more recent peer-reviewed studies showing periodontal regeneration, and further suggested that the LANAP protocol's minimally invasive nature may offer advantages in the regeneration of defects where minimal soft tissue change is required. The current AAP website indicates that lasers {{can be used to}} treat periodontal disease, and current controlled studies have shown that similar results have been found with the laser compared to specific other treatment options, including scaling and root planing alone. The website also states patients should be aware that different laser wavelengths have different applications in periodontal treatment.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: An optical urea {{biosensor}} was fabricated by stacking {{several layers}} of sol-gel films. The stacking of the sol-gel films allowed the immobilization of a Nile Blue chromoionophore (ETH 5294) and urease enzyme separately without the need of any chemical <b>attachment</b> <b>procedure.</b> The absorbance response of the biosensor was monitored at 550 nm, i. e. the deprotonation of the chromoionophore. This multi-layer sol-gel film format enabled higher enzyme loading in the biosensor to be achieved. The urea optical biosensor constructed from three layers of sol-gel films that contained urease demonstrated a much wider linear response range of up to 100 mM urea when compared with biosensors that constructed from 1 - 2 layers of films. Analysis of urea in urine samples with this optical urea biosensor yielded results similar to that determined by a spectrophotometric method using the reagent p-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde (R 2 = 0. 982, n = 6).

40|$|Electron {{microscope}} {{images of}} negatively stained fibrinogen are predominantly asymmetric rods 450 A {{in length and}} about 60 A in width. The molecules appear to have considerable flexibility, and mass distribution along the major axis is not uniquely distinguished despite apparent beading in some particles.

30|$|Possible {{applications}} (e.g. {{development of}} indices {{to gauge the}} state of cardiopulmonary health) for a high spatial and temporal resolution body-surface electrocardiograph system have been surveyed. Although several decades have passed since the first appearance of research papers describing the principles of body-surface electrocardiography, its lack of acceptance is likely due to factors such as system size and complexity, challenging electrode <b>attachment</b> <b>procedures,</b> {{and the fact that}} useful applications are still generally unknown. The study reported here responds to those criticisms, and we present a high-resolution body-surface electrocardiograph system that is easier to use and capable of more accurate measurement and analysis than previously reported systems. Just as understanding of standard 12 -lead ECG waveforms has evolved over time, general understanding of the formidable amount of information embedded in body-surface potential measurements is not expected immediately. However, accurately acquired potential distributions displayed dynamically in three dimensions (by the present system) organize the large data-sets into animated clips and should accelerate the learning process. The system measures data hidden by filtering, reveals phenomena undetectable by the 12 -lead ECG, and overcomes a major barricade to practical application and general acceptance of body-surface electrocardiography, which is the troublesome, time consuming attachment {{of a large number of}} electrodes.|$|R

Quantum confinement effects imbue sizedependent properties in nanomaterials which can be controlled during synthesis and exploited in devices. The physical properties inherent to semiconducting quantum dots (QDs) and single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) render their chemical combination a unique nanomaterial complex for 11 icrosystems. Synthesis proficiency has been demonstrated for two techniques: (1) a pulsed laser vaporization process for SWNTs, and (2) wet chemistry colloidal approaches for CdSe and CuInS 2 QDs. A significant fraction {{of the work in}} this Dissertation has been devoted to establishing standardized protocols for characterizing the nanomaterial properties using electron microscopy and spectroscopy. In the case of SWNTs, innovative methods have been developed to accurately assess the SWNT purity and monitor the purification steps during thermal oxidation. These results represent the first established metrics of reference for SWNT purity as well as unprecedented levels of purification efficiency. Experimental control over SWNT chiral distributions and QD particle diameter has shown where the size-dependent tunability of their optical bandgap can be used for selective absorption and emission based upon size and structure. 11 odification of the surface ligands on the QDs has facilitated an investigation of chemical <b>attachment</b> <b>procedures</b> to high purity SWNTs using covalent, electrostatic, and noncovalent reaction schemes.

30|$|We {{introduce}} a new node in the LTE-A network {{referred to as the}} cognitive resource manager (CRM), which coordinates the OSA to the unlicensed spectrum based on the notifications reporting the channel status perceived by the cognitive UEs.

Since the CRM does not perform any sensing task and only compiles MIH event notifications from remote entities, it is necessary to implement a remote MIHF in every LTE-A UE. With the aim of keeping the Geo-DB updated, the CRM needs to know when a cognitive user measures that the RSSI in the licensed band crosses a specific power level or threshold. Therefore, after the <b>attachment</b> <b>procedure,</b> the CRM must send to the active user a MIH_Event_Subscribe message with the list of RBs to be monitored.

40|$|A {{class of}} high {{molecular}} weight iron chelators has been prepared by covalently attaching deferoxamine (DFO), by its amino group, {{to a variety of}} biocompatible polymers such as dextran and hydroxyethyl-starch. The iron-binding properties of DFO are virtually unchanged after the <b>attachment</b> <b>procedure,</b> but the toxicity and circulatory half-life are profoundly altered. Competitive iron-binding experiments indicate that the conjugates retain a high affinity for ferric iron. In addition, the derivatives inhibit iron-driven lipid peroxidation as effectively as the parent drug. However, the LD 50 in mice (based on DFO equivalents) is approximately 4000 mg/kg for dextran-DFO as compared to 250 mg/kg for free DFO. Consistent with the greatly decreased LD 50, intravenous administration of the conjugates in dogs at a dose of 100 mg/kg (body weight) does not cause the severe hypotension associated with intravenous administration of DFO. The plasma half-lives of these adducts are increased greater than 10 -fold for dextran-DFO and hydroxyethyl-starch-DFO compared to the free drug. Finally, and most importantly, the conjugates are effective in mediating in vivo iron mobilization and excretion.
