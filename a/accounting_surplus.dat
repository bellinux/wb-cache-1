Using the reconciliation notes disclosed by 117 local government entities, evidence is provided on the effects of IFRS adoption by identifying the key items that of difference between IFRS and AASB. The results show some differences between two sets of accounts prepared under these different accounting standards. While the average surplus (loss) of local councils has decreased, their equities, assets and liabilities have increased, with no major significant changes in their overall financial position, except for liabilities. These results indicate the possible consequences of the adoption of IFRS by local government entities in other countries on performance indicators who have or are yet to implement these standards...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} two U. S. {{current account}} deficit episodes, {{one in the}} 1980 s {{and the other in}} the current 2000 s, in which Japan and China, respectively, are the current <b>account</b> <b>surplus</b> countries that are criticized for contributing to the deficits. In both periods, U. S. policy makers pointed out the underdeveloped and closed financial markets of the current <b>account</b> <b>surplus</b> countries and advocated for these countries to fix the deficiencies, a position akin to the current "saving glut" argument. In both episodes, the current <b>account</b> <b>surplus</b> countries have criticized the United States for its low saving, especially public saving (the "Twin Deficit" argument). This paper presents empirical findings that are consistent with the Twin Deficit hypothesis; A one percentage point increase in the budget balance raises the current account balance by 0. 10 - 0. 49 percentage point for industrialized countries. The saving glut argument seems to be applicable only for countries with highly developed legal systems and open financial markets. While the United States has been experiencing a savings drought in both episodes, the Japanese current <b>account</b> <b>surplus</b> was driven by underinvestment in the 1980 s and by over-saving during the 2000 s. Furthermore, although the current Chinese current <b>account</b> <b>surplus</b> is driven by its over-saving, {{there is no evidence of}} excess domestic saving in the Asian emerging market countries; rather, they seem to have suffered from depressed investment in the wake of the 1997 financial crises.

This paper focuses on the reasons and remedies for the PRC’s current <b>account</b> <b>surpluses.</b> Rather than deploying the standard explanations, we argue that asymmetric market liberalization and the related factor market distortion is the root reason for the PRC’s external imbalances. These cost distortions have artificially lowered PRC production costs, raised profits, and improved their products’ international competitiveness which has not only stimulated the economy, but also brought about severe structural risks. We completed a crude estimation for factor cost distortions in the PRC during 2000 – 2009 which matched its current <b>account</b> <b>surpluses</b> quite well. In order to rebalance the economy, we recommend that the PRC should adopt a comprehensive reform package focusing on removing the factor market distortions. prc; current account surplus; economic rebalancing; exchange rate; factor market distortion...|$|R
40|$|China {{is widely}} seen {{as one of the}} sources of global {{macroeconomic}} imbalances. Its persistent current <b>account</b> <b>surplus</b> and capital exports to the United States are even cited as one of the causes of the global financial crisis. The most common explanation traces China's current acca ount surplus to a mismatch between saving and investment due to inefficiently low domestic demand. We challenge this explanation. Our argument rests on an analogy that we construct between two countries generally thought to be very different: Russia and China. Russia, a raw materials exporting country, has been running current <b>account</b> <b>surpluses</b> similar to China's in relation to GDP. As for most raw materials exporting countries this is considered normal, reflecting efficient reinvestment of wealth from natural resources in financial assets. We show that a similar efficiency argument can be constructed for China, although the nature of wealth that is reinvested in financial assets is different in the two countries. Our analysis implies that China's current <b>account</b> <b>surpluses</b> can be expected to disappear over the long horizon - although the time when this will happen may still be very far away. Moreover, an appreciation of the Chinese currency may not have the desired effect of mitigating the country's current <b>account</b> <b>surplus</b> as a weakening in competitiveness is counterbalanced by a strengthening of investment motives.

40|$|China’s {{exchange}} rate policy, its current <b>account</b> <b>surplus,</b> {{and the global}} imbalances 16 W. Max Corden* This chapter is stimulated by current views prevalent in the United States about Chinese {{exchange rate}} policy. The Chinese currency, the Renminbi (RMB for short), was fi xed to the US dollar from 1997 to 2005. In July 2005 a new regime was instituted, {{and from then on}} there was some appreciation of the RMB-dollar rate. It appreciated cumulatively about 9 per cent by the end of 2007. In general, US critics have not considered this appreciation as being suffi cient. The common argument was that, if the RMB were allowed to fl oat, it would appreciate substantially more, and this would reduce China’s high current <b>account</b> <b>surplus</b> as well as the US defi cit. In this view the Chinese exchange rate regime and policy within the regime have been (more or less) the causes of the current account imbalance. It is implied that the Chinese exchange rate intervention caused the Chinese current <b>account</b> <b>surplus</b> and at least played a role in causing the overall US current account defi cit. 2 Table 6. 1 shows the Chinese current <b>account</b> <b>surplus</b> as a percentage of GDP from 2000 to 2008.

40|$|Over {{the last}} few years economists have started {{referring}} to the existence of “global payments imbalances”, reflected in the growing current <b>account</b> <b>surpluses</b> and deficits among different regions of the world (surpluses mostly, but not only, by a number of Asian countries; deficits mainly by the US), together with a substantial accumulation of international reserves (also by a number of Asian countries). This paper examines Asia’s current <b>account</b> <b>surplus</b> {{from the perspective of the}} savings−investment gap in order to determine whether the surplus is a result of an increase in savings rates (i. e., a savings glut) or a decline in investment rates (i. e., an investment drought). The analysis indicates that Asian current <b>account</b> <b>surpluses</b> are mostly associated with significant investment declines after the Asian financial crisis. Using data from 1986 to 2003 for a group of Southeast Asian countries, we find that the decrease and stagnation of domestic credit, the creation of excess capacity, and the relative decline of profit rates have contributed to the fall of investment rates across Asia, indicating a return to export-led growth.

40|$|Chinas large current <b>account</b> <b>surpluses</b> {{not only}} destabilize its {{macroeconomic}} conditions but also {{are also at}} the center of global rebalancing. The literature offered five explanations for such surpluses, most of which are important but fail to account for the recent surge and/or offer actionable policy responses. In this study, we propose an alternative hypothesis for Chinas large current <b>account</b> <b>surpluses</b> : asymmetric market liberalization and associated cost distortions. This unique reform approach was the fundamental cause of both extraordinary growth performance and growing structural imbalances during the reform period. Indeed, estimates of cost distortions provide good fits of the current account. Estimated cost distortions rose after 2004 but peaked in 2006 at 12. 2 percent of GDP. The worst of the external imbalance problem may be already behind us. We argue that, for rebalancing its economy, China needs a comprehensive package focusing on further liberalization of factor markets. Exchange rate policy should be an important part, but exclusive focus on the currency could be counterproductive.

We then present a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model in which a current <b>account</b> <b>surplus</b> arises as an endogenous result of a decrease in the share of household income in national income. On the one hand, this result complements existing literature where current account deficits result from rising personal income inequality. On the other hand, we find that current account imbalances will be more pronounced when accompanied by changes in the financial system. Accordingly, if we link Germany's accession to the European monetary union to lower exchange rate costs for German bank lending, the current <b>account</b> <b>surplus</b> becomes larger...|$|R

40|$|The {{impact of}} China's {{exchange}} rate on both its current account balance and the US-China bilateral trade balance is considerable. A 1 {{percent rise in}} the {{real effective exchange rate}} would cause a reduction in China's current <b>account</b> <b>surplus</b> of 0. 30 to 0. 45 percent of GDP.

William R. Cline also warns that the increasing trend for China's current <b>account</b> <b>surplus,</b> combined with the negative trend for the US deficit, indicate that adjustments accomplished through exchange rate correction at any one time will have a tendency to erode unless the renminbi successively appreciates by around 2 percent annually to reflect its rapid productivity growth.

5|$|Because {{the balance}} of {{payments}} sums to zero, a current <b>account</b> <b>surplus</b> indicates a deficit in the asset accounts and vice versa. A current <b>account</b> <b>surplus</b> or deficit indicates {{the extent to which}} a country is relying on foreign capital to finance its consumption and investments, and whether it is living beyond its means. For example, assuming a capital account balance of zero (thus no asset transfers available for financing), a current account deficit of £1 billion implies a financial <b>account</b> <b>surplus</b> (or net asset exports) of £1 billion. A net exporter of financial assets is known as a borrower, exchanging future payments for current consumption. Further, a net export of financial assets indicates growth in a country's debt. From this perspective, {{the balance of}} payments links a nation's income to its spending by indicating the degree to which current account imbalances are financed with domestic or foreign financial capital, which illuminates how a nation's wealth is shaped over time. A healthy balance of payments position is important for economic growth. If countries experiencing a growth in demand have trouble sustaining a healthy balance of payments, demand can slow, leading to: unused or excess supply, discouraged foreign investment, and less attractive exports which can further reinforce a negative cycle that intensifies payments imbalances.|$|R
