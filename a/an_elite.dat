We aim to investigate several explanations for this phenomenon {{by analyzing the}} structural characteristics and the opinion structure of party elites and comparing them to the party members, voters, former voters and all other voters. Analyses are performed using descriptive statistics, Gallagher’s Disproportionality Index as well as Latent Class Analysis (LCA) using data from two different sources: a survey on sp. <b>a</b> <b>elites</b> and members (PMRS) from 2008 and voter data from the BNES 2007, allowing us to compare five different groups. Results show that 1) descriptive representativeness {{is much better than}} attitudinal representativeness; 2) sp. <b>a</b> <b>elites</b> are by far the most uniform group; 3 left-universalists are overrepresented and left-particuralists are underrepresented among sp. <b>a</b> <b>elites.</b> We conclude that sp. <b>a</b> <b>elites</b> are not representative of their particularistic voters who may leave the party for that reason. Moreover, the uniform distribution of the sp. <b>a</b> <b>elites</b> puts at stake the traditional broad societal appeal of social democracy. status: publishe...|$|R
