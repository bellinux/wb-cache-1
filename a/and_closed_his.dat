5|$|Over time, {{competition}} from nearby bars and Victor Morris' deteriorating health {{led to the}} decline and fall of his enterprise. During this time, due to his worsening constitution, Morris delegated most of the bartending to his employees. Adding to the problem, nearby competitors, such as the Hotel Bolívar and the Hotel Lima Country Club, housed bars which took clientele away from Morris' Bar. Moreover, Toro-Lira discovered that Morris accused four of his former bartenders of intellectual property theft after they left to work {{in one of these}} competing establishments. In 1929, Morris declared voluntary bankruptcy <b>and</b> <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> saloon. A few months later, on June 11, Victor Vaughen Morris died of cirrhosis.|$|E

25|$|In 1952, Buffett married Susan Thompson at Dundee Presbyterian Church. The {{next year}} {{they had their}} first child, Susan Alice. In 1954, Buffett {{accepted}} a job at Benjamin Graham's partnership. His starting salary was $12,000 a year (about $ today). There he worked closely with Walter Schloss. Graham was a tough boss. He was adamant that stocks provide a wide margin of safety after weighing the trade-off between their price and their intrinsic value. The argument made sense to Buffett but he questioned whether the criteria were too stringent and caused the company {{to miss out on}} big winners that had other appealing features. That same year the Buffetts had their second child, Howard Graham. In 1956, Benjamin Graham retired <b>and</b> <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> partnership. At this time Buffett's personal savings were over $174,000 (about $ million today) and he started Buffett Partnership Ltd.|$|E

25|$|Hawkins had {{a career}} high in the 1995 season. He claimed a 60m hurdles silver medal on his {{international}} debut at the 1995 IAAF World Indoor Championships, forming an American 1–2 with winner Allen Johnson. Hawkins ran a personal record of 7.41 seconds to take the medal. He again ranked third globally in the event (behind Johnson and Jackson) and the time had moved him to fourth in the all-time American rankings, after Greg Foster, Roger Kingdom, and Johnson. As of 2015 he remains in the top-20 all-time for the discipline. An outdoor medal followed at the 1995 Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, Argentina, as he took bronze {{in a time of}} 13.54 seconds, finishing behind the higher profile athlete Kingdom and Emilio Valle of Cuba. At the Athletissima meet in Lausanne he set a personal record time of 13.22 seconds. In spite of these successes, he was outside the top three at the national championships both indoors and out, <b>and</b> <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> season injured at the 1995 IAAF Grand Prix Final (ending seventh).|$|E

500|$|... and it is, in the {{circumstances}} known to him, unreasonable to take the risk. In Booth v. Crown Prosecution Service (2006) the Divisional Court upheld the defendant pedestrian's conviction on a charge that, by rashly dashing into the road, he recklessly damaged the vehicle that hit him because [...] "the appellant {{was aware of the}} risk <b>and</b> <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> mind to it".|$|E

500|$|In Combs' first {{speech of}} the primary campaign, he {{admitted}} that the state needed to raise $25million ($ million in [...] dollars) in new revenue and that a sales tax should be considered. Chandler, the more experienced politician, attacked Combs for this suggestion, maintaining that an experienced governor like himself would not need to raise taxes to meet the state's obligations. Combs' speech was also attacked as dry and uninspiring, partly because he read it verbatim from prepared notes. [...] "And you said I couldn't give a speech," [...] Doc Beauchamp later complained to Clements. Hugh Morris, chief of the Louisville Courier-Journals Frankfort bureau, commented that [...] "Combs opened <b>and</b> <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> campaign on the same night".|$|E
500|$|Within {{a decade}} of the {{railroad}} reaching his lands, Ricketts {{was out of the}} hotel business. The North Mountain House hotel was threatened by a forest fire in 1900; the subsequent loss of much of the surrounding old-growth forest led to decreased numbers of hotel guests. Changing tastes may have also {{played a role in the}} decline in popularity; the hotel had over 150 guests in August 1878, but only about 70 guests in August 1894. The wooden addition was torn down in 1897 or 1903, and [...] "despite profits, Ricketts became disenchanted with the hotel business <b>and</b> <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> hotel in 1903", though the stone house remained the Ricketts family's summer home. Passenger rail service to Ganoga Lake ended when the hotel closed; the fishing club closed that year as well, but was re-formed in 1907. In 1903 another large fire on North Mountain threatened the sawmill in the lumber town of Ricketts.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{their shared}} {{upbringing}} {{and involvement in}} the Spanish Treason, the conspirators chose not to reveal the plot to him until 14October 1605, shortly after his father died, and just weeks before the planned explosion. [...] According to his confession, the meeting {{took place at the}} home of Tresham's brother-in-law, Lord Stourton, in Clerkenwell. [...] Tresham claimed to have questioned Catesby on the morality of the plot, asking if it was spiritually [...] "damnable". [...] Catesby replied that it was not, at which point Tresham highlighted the danger that all Catholics would face should the plot succeed. [...] Catesby replied, [...] "The necessity of the Catholics" [...] was such that [...] "it must needs be done". [...] He wanted two things from Tresham: £2,000, and the use of Rushton Hall; Catesby received neither. [...] Tresham had no money to spare, his father's debts having reduced his inheritance, although he paid a small sum to Thomas Wintour, on the understanding that the latter was to travel to the Low Countries. [...] Following the meeting, he hurried back to Rushton Hall <b>and</b> <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> household, taking care to hide family papers (not discovered until 1838). [...] He then returned to London with his mother and sisters, and on 2November acquired a licence to travel abroad with his servants and horses.|$|E

2500|$|Brian Lowry of Variety praised Moffat's script, {{stating that}} it [...] "emphasizes storyline {{continuity}} and easing faithful viewers into the regeneration transition" [...] <b>and</b> <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> review by saying [...] "It’s a skillful tonal balance {{that defines the}} best of “Doctor Who,” and exemplifies the ethos that keeps the series going strong, nodding to the past with all eyes on the future". David Wiegand of San Francisco Chronicle heavily praised the episode, particularly Moffat's writing, saying that his script [...] "masterfully manipulates audience expectation". He ultimately awarded the episode a perfect 4/4 stars.|$|E
2500|$|By 1827, the school, {{with one}} faculty member, was struggling. Nathan Dane, a {{prominent}} alumnus of the college, then endowed the Dane Professorship of Law, insisting {{that it be}} given to then Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story. For a while, the school was called [...] "Dane Law School." [...] In 1829, John H. Ashmun, son of Eli Porter Ashmun and brother of George Ashmun, accepted a professorship <b>and</b> <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> Northampton Law School, with many of his students following him to Harvard. Story's belief in {{the need for an}} elite law school based on merit and dedicated to public service helped build the school's reputation at the time, although the contours of these beliefs have not been consistent throughout its history. Enrollment remained low through the 19th century as university legal education was considered to be of little added benefit to apprenticeships in legal practice. [...] After first trying lowered admissions standards, in 1848 HLS eliminated admissions requirements entirely. [...] In 1869, HLS also eliminated examination requirements.|$|E

On November 10, the week culminated with a tribute concert compered by Kris Kristofferson. Lewis was present to accept the American Music Masters Award <b>and</b> <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> own tribute show with a rendition of [...] "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" [...] On February 10, 2008, he appeared with John Fogerty and Little Richard on the 50th Grammy Awards Show, performing [...] "Great Balls of Fire" [...] in a medley with [...] "Good Golly Miss Molly". [...] On June 4, 2008, Lewis was inducted into The Louisiana Music Hall of Fame and appeared on A Capitol Fourth and performed the finale's final act with a medley of [...] "Roll Over Beethoven", [...] "Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin On" [...] and [...] "Great Balls of Fire." [...] In October 2008, {{as part of a}} very successful European tour, Lewis returned to the UK, almost exactly 50 years after his ill-fated first tour. He appeared at two London shows: a special private show at the 100 Club on October 25 and at the London Forum on October 28 with Wanda Jackson and his sister, Linda Gail Lewis.|$|E
