5|$|Globocnik and I {{were talking}} about Operation Reinhard, which was in full effect {{following}} Heydrich's murder, and also the construction of Sobibor and Treblinka. I know I asked him about Höss, who was also standing there and had been summoned by Himmler regarding logistics or something regarding the new camp (Auschwitz). Then Globocnik mentioned to me and Kaltenbrunner that Lidice had been cleared, and all the Jews and Czechs had been dealt with. I noticed that this young pilot, who I later learned was Marseille, must have overheard, and I debated whether I should go over <b>and</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> to him. I decided against it.|$|E
500|$|Lee {{became known}} for his [...] "frightening" [...] {{tendency}} to not [...] "mince words". The director often had his cast do numerous takes for a scene {{in order to get}} the perfect shot, and was not afraid to call something [...] "boring" [...] if he disliked it. Thompson later recalled the director would [...] "always come up to you <b>and</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> unexpectedly crushing", such as asking her not to [...] "look so old." [...] She also commented, however, that [...] "he doesn't indulge us but is always kind when we fail." [...] Due to Thompson's extensive acting experience, the director encouraged her to practice t'ai chi to [...] "help her relax [...] make her do things simpler." [...] Other actors soon joined them in meditating – according to Doran, it [...] "was pretty interesting. There were all these pillows on the floor and these pale-looking actors were saying, 'What have we got ourselves into?' [...] was more focused on body language than any director I've ever seen or heard of." [...] He suggested Winslet read books of poetry and report back to him in order to best understand her character. He also had Thompson and Winslet live together to develop their characters' sisterly bond. Many of the cast took lessons in etiquette and riding side-saddle.|$|E
2500|$|Bee Vang, as paraphrased by Jeff Baenen of the Associated Press, {{said that}} the film's {{portrayal}} of the Hmong is [...] "generally accurate." [...] Regarding the result, Vang said [...] "his film is not a documentary. We can't expect 101 percent correctness." [...] During the filming, Hmong cast members addressed what they believed to be cultural inaccuracies that were being introduced. Cedric Lee, a half-Hmong {{who worked as a}} production assistant and a cultural consultant, said that [...] "Some things were over-exaggerated for dramatic purposes. Whether it was our job or not, I still felt some responsibility to speak our mind <b>and</b> <b>say</b> <b>something,</b> but at the same time, the script was what it was. We didn’t make the final decision." [...] Vang said while many Hmong had objected to some elements, the producers selected the viewpoints of the cultural consultants which [...] "had the most amenable take on the matter and would lend credence to whatever Hollywood stereotypes the film wanted to convey." [...] Vang further said that [...] "this was a white production, that our presence as actors did not amount to control of our images." ...|$|E

6000|$|There was a pause, {{during which}} the sentry called to another man, who came up yawning, <b>and</b> <b>saying</b> <b>something</b> in Dutch. Straining his ears he caught the words, [...] "Bishop's man," [...] and this gave him an idea.|$|R
60|$|At {{the hotel}} in Trieste, to which Lydia went with her uncle before taking the train for Venice, she found an elderly woman, who made her a courtesy, <b>and,</b> <b>saying</b> <b>something</b> in Italian, startled her by kissing her hand.|$|R
5000|$|In the anime, {{he appears}} very early {{and for the}} {{majority}} of the show he does absolutely nothing that has any effect on the plot or story line of any of the episodes.

60|$|He saw him turn to Irene <b>and</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> and {{her face}} sparkle as he often saw it sparkle at other people--never at himself. He tried to catch what they were saying, but Aunt Juley was speaking.|$|E
5000|$|Philadelphia Police Detective John Hobbes visits {{serial killer}} Edgar Reese, whom he helped capture, on death row.

5000|$|Jay (voiced by Ken Schatz) {{is a man}} who, {{whenever}} Sheep or {{any other}} main character sees a sign, is first heard reading it aloud, and when the character turns to him, he raises his glasses <b>and</b> <b>says</b> <b>something</b> {{along the lines of}} [...] "I like to read" [...] or [...] "Reading is funducational".|$|R
6000|$|For Entomology, which, after all, is {{the study}} most fit for boys (as Botany is for girls) who have no {{opportunity}} for visiting the sea-shore, Catlow's [...] "Popular British Entomology," [...] having coloured plates (a delight to young people), <b>and</b> <b>saying</b> <b>something</b> of all the orders, is, probably, still a good work for beginners.|$|R
6000|$|... "Go <b>and</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> to him; I can't; {{poor old}} father, if I 'd only known," [...] and to Polly's utter dismay, Tom {{threw himself into}} a chair, and laid his {{head down on the}} table, as if he had got a blow that was too much for him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I married Mrs. De Clinton," [...] went on Bell. [...] "One evening {{while we}} were up at the lake.

6000|$|Miss Minerva was {{not quite}} satisfied. [...] "Will you help me to feel as certain about it as you do?" [...] she asked. [...] "Mrs. Gallilee {{generally}} looks in for a few minutes, while the children are at dinner. Stay here, <b>and</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> to her in my presence.

60|$|After Mr. George and the {{children}} had been standing upon the brink of this abyss some time, watching the explosions, the guide who {{had come up with}} them from the Hermitage beckoned to Mr. George, <b>and</b> <b>saying</b> <b>something</b> {{at the same time in}} Italian, made signs as if he wished the party to go with him to some other place.|$|R
2500|$|When {{you write}} a song and you mean it one way, and someone comes up <b>and</b> <b>says</b> <b>something</b> about it that you didn't think of—you can't deny it.

60|$|The {{good wine}} did {{in some sort}} soften the squire; but, {{as a matter of}} course, nothing further was said as to the new matrimonial scheme.

6000|$|... "My dears," [...] said I, [...] "we {{philosophers}} {{must give}} an occasional {{dip into the}} mystical, <b>and</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> apparently absurd {{for the purpose of}} explaining that we mean nothing in particular by it.

6000|$|... "It's on my mind, Miss," [...] she said, [...] "to {{write an}} answer, <b>and</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> to Mr. Arthur which will {{persuade him to}} take care of himself, {{on his way back to}} the farm.

6000|$|The story {{made its}} impression, and Lapham saw it. [...] "Now I say," [...] he resumed, {{as if he}} felt {{that he was going to}} do himself justice, <b>and</b> <b>say</b> <b>{{something}}</b> to heighten the effect his story had produced. At the same time he was aware of a certain want of clearness. He had the idea, but it floated vague, elusive, in his brain. He looked about as if for something to precipitate it in tangible shape.|$|E
60|$|Oliver saw Jonas walk {{to a man}} who {{was writing}} at a desk in the corner of a room, <b>and</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> to him. Oliver could not hear what it was.

He called a girl to come and tend it.|$|E
5000|$|On the {{recorded}} version appearing on Khronika pikiruyushchego bombardirovshchika and Sto let odinochestva, Kuzya Waugh {{can be heard}} shouting [...] "Blyad" [...] in reverse at the beginning <b>and</b> <b>says</b> <b>something</b> else at the end.

500|$|Silva and Jackson {{had another}} brief altercation, {{this time at}} the UFC 92 weigh-ins. After both tipping the scales, they participated in an intense staredown for photography.

5000|$|Certain Siamese {{twins are}} known for their use in legalese. Due to the use of {{precedent}} in common law, many lawyers use the same collocations found in documents centuries old. So rather than a person [...] "enunciating" [...] a [...] "narrative" [...] or recollecting about a situation, a legal brief will instead declare that a person deposes <b>and</b> <b>says</b> <b>something</b> pertinent. Likewise, a person who bequeaths property habitually writes of their heirs and successors and not some alternative construct.|$|R
