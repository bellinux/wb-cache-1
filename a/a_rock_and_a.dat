5|$|According to Peter Freuchen, {{the scene}} in which the wolf attacks Mala is real. Freuchen says that Mala, armed with <b>a</b> <b>rock</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> pistol beneath his fur jacket, spent three afternoons trying to lure a wolf into attacking him. A rifleman and a cinematographer using a camera with a {{telephoto}} lens followed at a distance. The wolf attack was filmed from far away, with the rifleman ready to shoot the wolf in case Mala was unable to kill it. As shown in film, Mala was able to kill the wolf without using his pistol or relying on the rifleman, and was not injured in the attack.|$|E
5|$|On 23 June 2013, Shakira {{released}} a teaser {{of the commercial}} for the fragrance along with a photo of her posing with two cheetahs. A full version of the commercial was released later. It begins with Shakira, dressed in a dark burgundy gown, coming across a pair of cheetahs in an arid desert region. The two animals, alarmed, commence running towards her {{in an effort to}} attack her. Shakira responds by raising her hand, which prompts the cheetahs to abruptly stop in their tracks. They are later seen prowling around her while she is standing atop <b>a</b> <b>rock</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> bottle of Wild Elixir is then shown placed on a log of wood. The official website of the perfume also features a game made to promote the fragrance and Shakira's Barefoot Foundation.|$|E
5|$|Upheaval {{within the}} band {{occurred}} from 1983 onwards. First Bill McDonough left, then his brother Guy McDonough died in 1984, then various other members left. Their 1985 release Between <b>a</b> <b>Rock</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> Hard Place was expensive but sales were disappointing; and they disbanded early in 1986. The band's {{status as an}} icon on the Australian music scene was acknowledged by induction into the 1996 Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame. Founding guitarist Brad Robinson was unable to attend the Hall of Fame induction in person, as he was hospitalised with lymphoma and died two weeks later.|$|E

5|$|In 1984, {{the band}} {{released}} {{the best of}} their early material as a compilation titled Crawl File, which peaked at numbertwo on the albums charts. Geffen released Semantics, internationally, as a long play album with six newly re-recorded tracks compiled from their first three studio albums. Promotion of the album and the subsequent tour was stalled when Guy McDonough died in June of viral pneumonia. Before Guy's death, he had recorded demos with his brother Bill McDonough, and ex-members of their earlier band, The Flatheads. Bill McDonough assembled the tapes and produced Guy McDonough's posthumous album My Place on Wheatley Records in April 1985. Tracks from these sessions were re-mastered and released on Lost & Found in 1996, credited under the 'Members of Australian Crawl' name. Meanwhile, remaining Australian Crawl members had recorded their fourth studio album, Between <b>a</b> <b>Rock</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> Hard Place, which was released in 1985 and achieved number11 on the albums charts. This was followed by the announcement that they would disband after another tour. The live album, The Final Wave recorded their performance on 27 January 1986; it was released in October and peaked at number16 on the albums charts.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{starting}} a new character, the player will have only <b>a</b> <b>rock</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> torch, the former {{of which can be}} used to cut down trees and break apart stones. In order to survive in the world, the player must gather resources such as wood and stone and use these resources to craft tools, weapons and other gear. The player can gather cloth, food, stone, metal ore, sulfur ore and wood by killing animals, mining rocks and chopping trees. To craft items, players must have all of the required items. Sophisticated items require more materials, alongside consumables called components; items scattered around the map.|$|E
25|$|The {{objective}} {{of the game is}} to survive in the wilderness by crafting items using the materials gathered or stolen; the player starts with only <b>a</b> <b>rock</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> torch. There is only a multiplayer mode and a prevalent concept in Rust is to form and join clans with other players. Raiding is a very common action, usually done in large clans. Since Rusts first alpha launch, animals, hunting and the ability to craft armor and weapons have been added. It initially featured zombies as enemies, but subsequently replaced them with bears and wolves. Radiation was also removed due to the frustration it was causing players, although it was later reintroduced.|$|E

500|$|By 1985 {{the group}} {{recorded}} their last studio album, Between <b>a</b> <b>Rock</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> Hard Place, with English producer Adam Kidron. It {{was released in}} Australia on Australian Crawl's own label Freestyle Records. [...] The album, which allegedly cost $400,000 to record, was a mishmash of styles and a commercial disaster (it peaked at No. 12 in August 1985 but {{slipped out of the}} Top 40 two weeks later). None of the singles had any Top 40 chart success. Harry Brus (Kevin Borich Express) replaced long-standing bass player Paul Williams in May 1985. The band performed three songs for the July 1985 Oz for Africa concert—part of the global Live Aid program—"Reckless (Don't Be So)", [...] "Two Can Play" [...] and [...] "The Boys Light Up". It was broadcast in Australia (on both Seven Network and Nine Network) and on MTV in the US.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{described}} as [...] "uneven" [...] and an [...] "inauspicious start to the second season" [...] by James Van Hise and Hal Schuster in their book The Complete Trek: The Next Generation. While the duo praised the addition of Muldaur and Goldberg, {{the lack of a}} follow-up to the episode was criticised as they felt that the events should have had some type of lasting effect on Troi. It was suggested that either she would want to have a child, or she would be wary of them in general due to the impact of the loss of Ian. Keith DeCandido pointed out several changes at the start of this season in [...] "The Child" [...] that would recur {{throughout the rest of the}} run of The Next Generation in his review for Tor.com. These included moving Geordi La Forge to become chief engineer, placing Miles O'Brien as transporter chief and Riker growing a beard. However, he criticised the fact that Worf's calling for Troi to have an abortion was never mentioned again, but added that it was discussed in a non-canon novel, <b>A</b> <b>Rock</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> Hard Place by Peter David.|$|E
