25|$|<b>Autocrine</b> {{signals are}} {{produced}} by the target cell, are secreted, and affect the target cell itself via receptors. Sometimes <b>autocrine</b> cells can target cells close by if {{they are the same}} type of cell as the emitting cell. An example of this are immune cells.|$|E
25|$|Prostaglandins are potent {{but have}} a short {{half-life}} before being inactivated and excreted. Therefore, they send only paracrine (locally active) or <b>autocrine</b> (acting on the same cell from which it is synthesized) signals.|$|E
25|$|The GI tract {{releases}} hormones from enzymes to help {{regulate the}} digestive process. These hormones, including gastrin, secretin, cholecystokinin, and ghrelin, are mediated through either intracrine or <b>autocrine</b> mechanisms, {{indicating that the}} cells releasing these hormones are conserved structures throughout evolution.|$|E
25|$|Prostaglandins {{are found}} in most tissues and organs. They are {{produced}} by almost all nucleated cells. They are <b>autocrine</b> and paracrine lipid mediators that act upon platelets, endothelium, uterine and mast cells. They are synthesized in the cell from the essential fatty acids (EFAs).|$|E
25|$|Extrapituitary {{production}} of prolactin {{is thought to}} be special to humans and primates and may serve mostly tissue specific paracrine and <b>autocrine</b> purposes. It has been hypothesized that in vertebrates such as mice a similar tissue specific effect is achieved by a large family of prolactin-like proteins controlled by at least 26 paralogous PRL genes not present in primates.|$|E
25|$|Once the two-signal {{activation}} {{is complete}} the T helper cell (Th) then allows itself to proliferate. It achieves this by releasing a potent T cell growth factor called interleukin 2 (IL-2) which acts upon itself in an <b>autocrine</b> fashion. Activated T cells also produce the alpha sub-unit of the IL-2 receptor (CD25 or IL-2R), enabling a fully functional receptor that can bind with IL-2, {{which in turn}} activates the T cell's proliferation pathways.|$|E
25|$|Situated {{along the}} {{perimeter}} of the adrenal gland, the adrenal cortex mediates the stress response through the production of mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids, such as aldosterone and cortisol, respectively. It is also a secondary site of androgen synthesis. Recent data suggest that adrenocortical cells under pathological as well as under physiological conditions show neuroendocrine properties; within the normal adrenal, this neuroendocrine differentiation seems to be restricted to cells of the zona glomerulosa and might be important for an <b>autocrine</b> regulation of adrenocortical function.|$|E
25|$|Associations {{have been}} {{observed}} between neprilysin expression and various types of cancer; however, the relationship between neprilysin expression and carcinogenesis remains obscure. In cancer biomarker studies, the neprilysin gene {{is often referred to}} as CD10 or CALLA. In some types of cancer, such as metastatic carcinoma and some advanced melanomas, neprilysin is overexpressed; in other types, most notably lung cancers, neprilysin is downregulated, and thus unable to modulate the pro-growth <b>autocrine</b> signaling of cancer cells via secreted peptides such as mammalian homologs related to bombesin.|$|E
25|$|The {{discovery}} of nerve growth factor by Rita Levi-Montalcini in 1954, and {{epidermal growth factor}} by Stanley Cohen in 1962, led to more detailed insights into the molecular basis of cell signaling, in particular growth factors. Their work, together with Earl Wilbur Sutherland's {{discovery of}} cyclic AMP in 1956, prompted the redefinition of endocrine signaling to include only signaling from glands, while the terms <b>autocrine</b> and paracrine began to be used. Sutherland was awarded the 1971 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, while Levi-Montalcini and Cohen shared it in 1986.|$|E
25|$|In mammals, {{prolactin}} {{is associated}} with milk production; in fish it {{is thought to be}} related to control of water and salt balance. Prolactin also acts in a cytokine-like manner and as an important regulator of the immune system. It has important cell cycle-related functions as a growth-, differentiating- and anti-apoptotic factor. As a growth factor, binding to cytokine-like receptors, it influences hematopoiesis, angiogenesis and is involved in the regulation of blood clotting through several pathways. The hormone acts in endocrine, <b>autocrine</b> and paracrine manner through the prolactin receptor and a large number of cytokine receptors.|$|E
25|$|The {{structural}} {{differences between}} prostaglandins account for their different biological activities. A given prostaglandin {{may have different}} and even opposite effects in different tissues. The ability of the same prostaglandin to stimulate a reaction in one tissue and inhibit the same reaction in another tissue {{is determined by the}} type of receptor to which the prostaglandin binds. They act as <b>autocrine</b> or paracrine factors with their target cells present in the immediate vicinity of the site of their secretion. Prostaglandins differ from endocrine hormones in that they are not produced at a specific site but in many places throughout the human body.|$|E
25|$|Nitric oxide, {{known as}} an endothelium-derived {{relaxing}} factor (EDRF), is biosynthesized endogenously from L-arginine, oxygen, and NADPH by various nitric oxide synthase (NOS) enzymes. Reduction of inorganic nitrate may also serve to make nitric oxide. The endothelium (inner lining) of blood vessels uses nitric oxide to signal the surrounding smooth muscle to relax, thus resulting in vasodilation and increasing blood flow. Nitric oxide is highly reactive (having a lifetime of a few seconds), yet diffuses freely across membranes. These attributes make nitric oxide ideal for a transient paracrine (between adjacent cells) and <b>autocrine</b> (within a single cell) signaling molecule.|$|E

25|$|Digits V, IV {{and part}} of III arise {{directly}} from cells that express SHH during embryogenesis. In these cells SHH signals in an <b>autocrine</b> fashion and these digits develop correctly {{in the absence of}} DISP, which is required for extracellular diffusion of the ligand. These digits differ in the length of time that SHH continues to be expressed. The most posterior digit V develops from cells that express the ligand for the longest period of time. Digit IV cells express SHH for a shorter time, and digit III cells shorter still. Digit II develops from cells that are exposed to moderate concentrations of extracellular SHH. Finally, Digit I development does not require SHH. It is, in a sense, the default program of limb bud cells.|$|E
25|$|In a {{multicellular}} organism, signaling between cells occurs {{either through}} release into the extracellular space, divided in paracrine signaling (over short distances) and endocrine signaling (over long distances), or by direct contact, known as juxtacrine signaling. <b>Autocrine</b> signaling {{is a special}} case of paracrine signaling where the secreting cell {{has the ability to}} respond to the secreted signaling molecule. Synaptic signaling is a special case of paracrine signaling (for chemical synapses) or juxtacrine signaling (for electrical synapses) between neurons and target cells. Signaling molecules interact with a target cell as a ligand to cell surface receptors, and/or by entering into the cell through its membrane or endocytosis for intracrine signaling. This generally results in the activation of second messengers, leading to various physiological effects.|$|E
25|$|Many cell {{signals are}} carried by {{molecules}} that are released by one cell {{and move to}} make contact with another cell. Endocrine signals are called hormones. Hormones are produced by endocrine cells and they travel through the blood to reach all parts of the body. Specificity of signaling can be controlled if only some cells can respond to a particular hormone. Paracrine signals such as retinoic acid target only cells {{in the vicinity of the}} emitting cell. Neurotransmitters represent another example of a paracrine signal. Some signaling molecules can function as both a hormone and a neurotransmitter. For example, epinephrine and norepinephrine can function as hormones when released from the adrenal gland and are transported to the heart by way of the blood stream. Norepinephrine can also be produced by neurons to function as a neurotransmitter within the brain. Estrogen can be released by the ovary and function as a hormone or act locally via paracrine or <b>autocrine</b> signaling. Active species of oxygen and nitric oxide can also act as cellular messengers. This process is dubbed redox signaling.|$|E
500|$|Biologically, Hsp90A {{differs from}} Hsp90B in that Hsp90A is {{presently}} understood {{to function as}} a secreted extracellular agent in wound healing and inflammation in addition to its intracellular roles. These two processes are often hijacked by cancer allowing for malignant cell motility, metastasis and extravasion. [...] Current research in prostate cancer indicates that extracellular Hsp90A transduces signals that promote the chronic inflammation of cancer-associated fibroblasts. [...] This reprogramming of the extracellular milieu surrounding malignant adenocarcinoma cells is understood to stimulate prostate cancer progression. [...] Extracellular HSP90A induces inflammation through the activation of the NF-κB (RELA) and STAT3 transcription programs that include the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8. [...] Coincidentally NF-κB also induces expression Hsp90A., thus providing a model where newly expressed Hsp90A would also be secreted from the stimulated fibroblast thereby creating positive <b>autocrine</b> and paracrine feedback loops resulting in an inflammatory storm at the site of malignancy. [...] This concept requires further attention as it may explain the correlation of increased levels of Hsp90A in the plasma of patients with advanced stages of malignancy.|$|E
2500|$|In {{as little}} as 15 minutes, glucose can stimulate GCK {{transcription}} and [...] glucokinase synthesis by way of insulin. Insulin is produced by the beta cells, {{but some of it}} acts on beta cell B-type insulin receptors, providing an <b>autocrine</b> positive-feedback amplification of glucokinase activity. Further amplification occurs by insulin action (via A-type receptors) to stimulate its own transcription.|$|E
2500|$|It is freely {{permeable}} to membranes. [...] As such, {{its effects}} do {{not rely on}} the cognate membrane receptors. It can have endocrine, paracrine, and <b>autocrine</b> effects. [...] In their endocrine mode of action, for example, gasotransmitters can enter the blood stream; be carried to remote targets by scavengers and released there, and modulate functions of remote target cells; ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{has been}} found that the {{overexpression}} of B-catenin may lead to enhanced proliferation in myeloma plasma cells; thus, soluble Wnt inhibitors are potential tumor suppressor genes and, if inactivated, may contribute to myeloma pathogenesis. [...] This led Chim et al. to investigate the role of aberrant gene methylation of a panel of soluble Wnt antagonists, including SFRP1. [...] Complete methylation led to silencing of respective genes (no transcripts), whereas absence of gene methylation was associated with constitutive gene expression. [...] Methylation of soluble Wnt antagonists would be important in the pathogenesis of multiple myeloma if Wnt signaling was regulated by an <b>autocrine</b> loop by Wnt and Fz. [...] If an <b>autocrine</b> loops exists, then both the ligand (Wz) and receptor (Fzd) should be simultaneously expressed in myeloma cells and growth of tumour cells should be inhibited upon addition of SFRP1. [...] Chim et al. demonstrated simultaneous expression of Wz and Fzd in myeloma plasma cells. [...] Moreover, treatment with recombinant SFRP1 inhibited the growth of myeloma cells in a dose-dependent manner. [...] These findings implicate soluble Wnt inhibitors as tumor suppressors that could be inactivated by methylation.|$|E
2500|$|Homo{{synaptic}} Plasticity (or also homotropic modulation) is {{a change}} in the synaptic strength that results from the history of activity at a particular synapse. [...] This can result from changes in presynaptic calcium as well as feedback onto presynaptic receptors, i.e. a form of <b>autocrine</b> signaling. Homosynaptic plasticity can affect the number and replenishment rate of vesicles or it can affect the relationship between calcium and vesicle release. Homosynaptic plasticity can also be postsynaptic in nature. It can result in either an increase or decrease in synaptic strength.|$|E
2500|$|Nitric oxide, {{known as}} the 'endothelium-derived {{relaxing}} factor', or 'EDRF', is biosynthesized endogenously from L-arginine, oxygen, and NADPH by various nitric oxide synthase (NOS) enzymes. [...] Reduction of inorganic nitrate may also serve to make nitric oxide. The endothelium (inner lining) of blood vessels uses nitric oxide to signal the surrounding smooth muscle to relax, thus resulting in vasodilation and increasing blood flow. Nitric oxide is highly reactive (having a lifetime of a few seconds), yet diffuses freely across membranes. These attributes make nitric oxide ideal for a transient paracrine (between adjacent cells) and <b>autocrine</b> (within a single cell) signaling molecule.|$|E
2500|$|Paracrine {{signaling}} {{is a form}} of cell-to-cell {{communication in}} which a cell produces a signal to induce changes in nearby cells, altering the behavior of those cells. Signaling molecules known as paracrine factors diffuse over a relatively short distance (local action), as opposed to endocrine factors (hormones which travel considerably longer distances via the circulatory system), juxtacrine interactions, and <b>autocrine</b> signaling. [...] Cells that produce paracrine factors secrete them into the immediate extracellular environment. Factors then travel to nearby cells in which the gradient of factor received determines the outcome. However, the exact distance that paracrine factors can travel is not certain.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>autocrine</b> or paracrine {{secretion}} of IL-2 {{can bind to}} {{that same}} Th cell or neighboring Th's via the IL-2R thus driving proliferation and clonal expansion. The Th cells receiving both signals of activation and proliferation will then become Th0 cells (T helper 0) cell that secrete IL-2, IL-4 and interferon gamma (IFN-γ). The Th0 cells will then differentiate into Th1 or Th2 cells depending on cytokine environment. IFN-γ drives Th1 cell production while IL-10 and IL-4 inhibit Th1 cell production. Conversely, IL-4 drives Th2 cell production and IFN-γ inhibits Th2 cells. [...] It {{should be noted that}} these cytokines are pleiotropic and carry out many other functions of the immune response.|$|E
2500|$|Sonic {{hedgehog}} (SHH) is {{the best}} studied ligand of the vertebrate pathway. Most {{of what is known}} about hedgehog signaling has been established by studying SHH. It is translated as a ~45kDa precursor and undergoes autocatalytic processing (Process [...] "1" [...] on Figure 5) to produce an ~20kDa N-terminal signaling domain (referred to as SHH-N) and a ~25kDa C-terminal domain with no known signaling role. During the cleavage, a cholesterol molecule is added to the carboxyl end of the N-terminal domain, which is involved in trafficking, secretion and receptor interaction of the ligand. SHH can signal in an <b>autocrine</b> fashion, affecting the cells in which it is produced. Secretion and consequent paracrine hedgehog signaling require the participation of Dispatched (DISP) protein (Process [...] "2" [...] on Figure 5).|$|E
2500|$|Eicosanoids are {{signaling}} molecules {{made by the}} enzymatic or non-enzymatic oxidation of {{arachidonic acid}} or other polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) that are, similar to arachidonic acid, 20 carbon units in length. Eicosanoids are a sub-category of oxylipins, i.e. oxidized fatty acids of diverse carbon units in length, and are distinguished from other oxylipins by their overwhelming importance as cell signaling molecules. Eicosanoids function in diverse physiological systems and pathological processes such as: mounting or inhibiting inflammation, allergy, fever and other immune responses; regulating the abortion of pregnancy and normal childbirth; contributing to the perception of pain; regulating cell growth; controlling blood pressure; and modulating the regional flow of blood to tissues. In performing these roles, eicosanoids most often act as <b>autocrine</b> signaling agents to impact their cells of origin or as paracrine signaling agents to impact cells in the proximity of their cells of origin. [...] Eicosanoids may also act as endocrine agents to control the function of distant cells.|$|E
50|$|<b>Autocrine</b> {{signaling}} {{is a form}} of signaling {{in which}} a cell secretes a hormone or chemical messenger (called the <b>autocrine</b> agent) that binds to <b>autocrine</b> receptors on the same cell, leading to changes in the cells.|$|E
50|$|<b>Autocrine</b> {{signaling}} {{is a form}} of {{cell signaling}} in which a cell secretes a hormone or chemical messenger (called the <b>autocrine</b> agent) that binds to <b>autocrine</b> receptors on that same cell, leading to changes in the cell. This can be contrasted with paracrine signaling, intracrine signaling, or classical endocrine signaling.|$|E
50|$|Metastasis is a {{major cause}} of cancer deaths, and {{strategies}} to prevent or halt invasion are lacking. One study showed that <b>autocrine</b> PDGFR signaling plays an essential role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) maintenance in vitro, which is known to correlate well with metastasis in vivo. The authors showed that the metastatic potential of oncogenic mammary epithelial cells required an <b>autocrine</b> PDGF/PDGFR signaling loop, and that cooperation of <b>autocrine</b> PDGFR signaling with oncogenic was required for survival during EMT. <b>Autocrine</b> PDGFR signaling also contributes to maintenance of EMT, possibly through activation of STAT1 and other distinct pathways. In addition, expression of PDGFRα and -β correlated with invasive behavior in human mammary carcinomas. This indicates the numerous pathways through which <b>autocrine</b> signaling can regulate metastatic processes in a tumor.|$|E
50|$|The growing {{knowledge}} {{behind the}} mechanism of <b>autocrine</b> signaling in cancer progression has revealed new approaches for therapeutic treatment. For example, <b>autocrine</b> Wnt signaling could provide a novel target for therapeutic intervention by means of Wnt antagonists or other molecules that interfere with ligand-receptor interactions of the Wnt pathway. In addition, VEGF-A production and VEGFR-2 activation {{on the surface of}} breast cancer cells indicates the presence of a distinct <b>autocrine</b> signaling loop that enables breast cancer cells to promote their own growth and survival by phosphorylation and activation of VEGFR-2. This <b>autocrine</b> loop is another example of an attractive therapeutic target.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Autocrine</b> {{signals are}} {{produced}} by the target cell, are secreted, and affect the target cell itself via receptors. Sometimes <b>autocrine</b> cells can target cells close by if {{they are the same}} type of cell as the emitting cell. An example of this are immune cells.|$|E
50|$|Tumor {{development}} is a complex process that requires cell division, growth, and survival. One approach used by tumors to upregulate growth and survival is through <b>autocrine</b> production of growth and survival factors. <b>Autocrine</b> signaling plays critical roles in cancer activation and also in providing self-sustaining growth signals to tumors.|$|E
50|$|Another agent {{involved}} in <b>autocrine</b> cancer signaling is vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). VEGF, produced by carcinoma cells, acts through paracrine signaling on endothelial cells and through <b>autocrine</b> signaling on carcinoma cells. Evidence shows that <b>autocrine</b> VEGF is {{involved in}} two major aspects of invasive carcinoma: survival and migration. Moreover, it was shown that tumor progression selects for cells that are VEGF-dependent, challenging the belief that VEGF’s role in cancer is limited to angiogenesis. Instead, this research suggests that VEGF receptor-targeted therapeutics may impair cancer survival and invasion as well as angiogenesis.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to binding to ECM ligands, integrins are also receptive to <b>autocrine</b> and paracrine signals such as growth {{factors in the}} TGF-beta family. Chondrocytes {{have been shown to}} secrete TGF-b, and upregulate TGF-b receptors in response to mechanical stimulation; this secretion may be a mechanism for <b>autocrine</b> signal amplification within the tissue.|$|E
50|$|The {{biological}} effects {{produced by}} intracellular actions are referred as intracrine effects, whereas those produced by binding to cell surface receptors are called endocrine, <b>autocrine,</b> or paracrine effects, {{depending on the}} origin of the hormone. The intracrine effect of some of the peptide/protein hormones are similar to their endocrine, <b>autocrine,</b> or paracrine effects; however, these effects are different for some other hormones.|$|E
50|$|VIP acts in an <b>autocrine</b> fashion via VPAC11 {{to inhibit}} {{megakaryocyte}} proliferation and induce proplatelet formation.|$|E
