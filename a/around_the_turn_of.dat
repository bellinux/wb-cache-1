5|$|After the {{original}} Russian-Mongolian expeditions in the 1940s, Polish-Mongolian joint expeditions to the Gobi Desert began in 1963 and continued until 1971, recovering many new fossils, including new specimens of Tarbosaurus from the Nemegt Formation. Expeditions involving Japanese and Mongolian scientists between 1993 and 1998, {{as well as}} private expeditions hosted by Canadian paleontologist Phil Currie <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> the 21st century, discovered and collected further Tarbosaurus material. More than 30 specimens are known, including more than 15 skulls and several complete postcranial skeletons.|$|E

5|$|<b>Around</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> the millennium, the Arabic {{astronomer}} and polymath Ibn al-Haytham (Alhacen) {{presented a}} development of Ptolemy's geocentric epicyclic models {{in terms of}} nested spheres. Despite the similarity of this concept to that of Ptolemy's Planetary Hypotheses, al-Haytham's presentation differs in sufficient detail {{that it has been}} argued that it reflects an independent development of the concept. In chapters 15–16 of his Book of Optics, Ibn al-Haytham also said that the celestial spheres do not consist of solid matter.|$|E

According to his own memoirs, he was better at martial arts than at academic subjects, and did not learn to read until later in life.

5|$|Several {{short-lived}} {{buildings were}} later constructed {{on top of}} the motte. The first of these <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> the 19th century was a banqueting house constructed by Lord Stafford. In 1808 Marquess of Landsdowne built a mansion in a Gothic style {{on top of the}} motte using some of the stone remains of the old keep; it became known as Landsdowne Castle, providing famous views across the town. Landsdowne Castle was pulled down in either 1815 or 1818, and most of the motte was subsequently flattened.|$|E

50|$|A motive of {{grouping}} {{elements in}} threes is found {{often in the}} house. This may be {{a group of three}} windows or a central doorway with a window or niche on each side. Most official rooms have a symmetrical design with niches on the walls may correspond to windows or doors on opposite walls. Doors though are more often not arranged {{in the middle of a}} wall but rather near corners. The main stairway is fairly wide and the steps are very flat. This is said to have enabled camels to carry provisions to the kitchen on the fifth floor. Even if animals where used to carry heavy loads upstairs, one may consider it easier to direct a donkey <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>turns</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stairway. There are two cisterns for water on the ground floor and latrines are provided for each level, while a domed shower can be found on the third floor., Pipes feed the waste water to underground septic tanks.|$|R
5|$|Across Britain, many hill forts {{fell out}} of use in the 100years <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> the millennium. It has been {{suggested}} that this, and the contemporary change in material culture of the Britons (such as the introduction of coinage and cemeteries and an increase in craft industries), was caused by increased interaction with the Roman Empire. The developing industries may have resulted in a shift away from the hill fort elites, whose power was based on agriculture. Such change is not as obvious in Dorset {{as it is in the}} rest of Britain, but there is a trend for abandonment of hill forts in the area and a proliferation of small undefended farmsteads, indicating a migration of the population.|$|E
5|$|Although Oklahoma {{was not yet}} a state {{during the}} Civil War, the Tulsa area did see its share of fighting. The Battle of Chusto-Talasah {{took place on the}} north side of Tulsa and a number of battles and skirmishes took place in nearby counties. After the War, the tribes signed Reconstruction {{treaties}} with the federal government that in some cases required substantial land concessions. In the years after the Civil War and <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> the century, the area along the Arkansas River that is now Tulsa was periodically home to or visited by a series of colorful outlaws, including the legendary Wild Bunch, the Dalton Gang, and Little Britches.|$|E

He added a classical portico to the front of an older structure, and a semi-circular auditorium that was sequestered by Parliament in 1814 as a temporary place to assemble, now preserved at Norsk Folkemuseum as a national monument.|$|E

5|$|<b>Around</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> the century, {{scholastic}} Greek organizations {{appeared on}} grounds. The university chapter of Phi Beta Kappa {{was founded in}} 1908, promoting scholarship in all fields of study. Different schools had specific honor and professional societies as well: Phi Delta Phi for the law department, Phi Rho Sigma for medicine, Kappa Delta Mu for chemistry, and many others. A chapter of Theta Tau, an engineering society, was founded in 1923, and Trigon Engineering Society was founded in 1924 as a local fraternity for engineering students. Trigon and Theta Tau dominated student government in the Engineering School during this time, often fielding competing candidates for student office. Likewise in the College, the University Party and the Cavalier Party were dominated by Lambda Pi and Skull & Keys, two Greek organizations.|$|E
5|$|Born in {{the north}} of Norway to a fairly {{distinguished}} family, he soon became interested in politics and history. Starting his political career in the Liberal Party, he switched to the Labour Party <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> the 20th century. He represented that party in the Bærum municipal council for parts of the interwar period. He was never elected a member of Parliament, but served nonetheless as Norwegian Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1935 to 1941. In the latter capacity he sought to preserve Norway's neutrality in the Second World War, an action that garnered him political infamy. Growing discontentment with Koht's political decisions ultimately led to his exit from the cabinet. After the war, however, he returned to an academic career track and wrote major works in the 1950s and 1960s.|$|E

The conflict started when Pappagallo returned from prison and found Alfano in control of his former territory. Other sources mention that after the death of Cappuccio, Giuseppe Chirico, 'o Granatiere (The Grenadier), from the Porta San Gennaro neighbourhood was elected. He was defeated in a zumpata by Totonno 'o Pappagallo, who took over the reign before being defeated by Alfano <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> the century.|$|E

5|$|From about 200,000 in the 1900 Census, Minneapolis {{soared to}} its highest {{population}} recorded in 1950 of over 521,000 people. The main {{growth of the}} city was in part due to an organized private streetcar system. With 140 million passengers by 1920, the streetcars ran down important roads extending from Downtown Minneapolis. Neighborhood residential development out of the core mostly dates <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> the century {{as a result of this}} system. This growth also allowed Minneapolis to annex land from neighboring villages and townships which subsequently pushed the incorporation of today's inner ring suburbs.|$|E
5|$|Instrumentalism {{became popular}} among {{physicists}} <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> the 20th century, after which logical positivism defined {{the field for}} several decades. Logical positivism accepts only testable statements as meaningful, rejects metaphysical interpretations, and embraces verificationism (a set of theories of knowledge that combines logicism, empiricism, and linguistics to ground philosophy on a basis consistent with examples from the empirical sciences). Seeking to overhaul all of philosophy and convert it to a new scientific philosophy, the Berlin Circle and the Vienna Circle propounded logical positivism in the late 1920s.|$|E
5|$|Kommandøren {{was one of}} four passenger/cargo steamships {{built for}} Nordre Bergenhus Amts Dampskibe at Norwegian shipyards <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> the 20th century.

In addition to Kommandøren, which was seen as the flagship of the company's fleet, Lærdal, Balder and Stavenes were built between 1876 and 1904. The company sailed on cargo/passenger routes in Western Norway. Kommandøren was the largest of the new-builds, and was considered the grandest of the company vessels.|$|E
