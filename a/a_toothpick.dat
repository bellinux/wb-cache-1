5|$|William Henry Meredith (30 July 1874– 19 April 1958) was a Welsh {{professional}} footballer. He {{was considered}} one of the early superstars of football due to his performances, notably for Manchester City and Manchester United. He won each domestic trophy in the English football league and gained 48 caps for Wales, for whom he scored 11 goals and won two British Home Championship titles. His favoured position was outside right, and his key skills were dribbling, passing, crossing and shooting. A dedicated and extremely fit professional, his habit of chewing on <b>a</b> <b>toothpick</b> during games made him instantly recognisable.|$|E

25|$|To {{ensure the}} pCas9cr4 plasmid was first {{successfully}} {{admitted to the}} cells, the cells were grown on a plate containing chloramphenicol; the pCas9cr4 plasmid contained the gene cmr, conferring resistance to chloramphenicol, which ensured only the successful recombinants grew. Triplicate plates of 10μL of recovered cultures as well as dilutions of 10−1, 10−2, and 10−3 were then spotted and incubated overnight at 30°C and CFU, or colony forming unit, assessments were then made to identify successful mutants using the miniaturized plating method described previously. Once the mutation of interest was screened using overnight growth on M9 minimal medium plates supplemented with glycerol, chloroacetate and SOC (super optimal broth with catabolite repression), colonies were patched onto selective plates using <b>a</b> <b>toothpick</b> and incubated at 30°C for two nights. After sufficient colony growth, cells were transfected with the pKDsg-XXX plasmid containing the aada gene, {{and as a result}} were resistant to the aminoglycosides spectinomycin and streptomycin. To ensure that the pKDsg-XXX plasmid was successfully admitted to the cells, the cells were grown on a plate containing both chloramphenicol and spectinomycin to select for cells containing both the pCas9cr4 and pKDsg-XXX plasmids.|$|E

500|$|When Hewett {{was named}} {{as one of}} the Five Batsmen of the Year by Wisden Cricketers' Almanack in 1893, the {{publication}} described him as [...] "the finest left-handed batsman in England". He played in an unorthodox but attractive fashion, which prompted W.G. Grace to praise [...] "his dashing and fearless hitting", while remarking that he had an awkward style. In Somerset, Cider and Sixes, David Foot described that he was [...] "possessed of an eagle eye, considerable meat and the ability to make his forcing shots attractive." [...] In Peter Roebuck's From Sammy to Jimmy, he offered a similar portrait of Hewett's batting style, adding that [...] "he saw it as his task to conquer". Hewett's batting received praise in H. S. Altham and E. W. Swanton's A History of Cricket, where he is described as a [...] "singularly determined and venomous" [...] batsman who [...] "hit the ball in unexpected and demoralizing directions." [...] He frequently scored his runs rapidly, as described by the Reverend R.S. Holmes, who wrote of his batting against Nottinghamshire; [...] "the Captain scored at his usual rate – three out of four runs notched, represent his pace. Against Surrey he got 61 out of 81, this time 60 out of the same total. That's the kind of example every captain should set – a run a minute, or thereabouts." [...] In summary of the 1892 season The Cricket Annual notes that [...] "the Somerset player, in fact, had established the reputation of being the most punishing batsman and rapid scorer of the day, and on last season's form no representative eleven could be considered complete without him." [...] Sammy Woods claimed that Hewett disliked fielding, but offered the view that he was good at point. Woods also related how Hewett would chew on <b>a</b> <b>toothpick,</b> which he always had in his mouth when fielding, when his team was losing.|$|E

2500|$|A 2013 {{systematic}} review found that acupuncture may be effective for nonspecific lower back pain, but the authors noted there were limitations {{in the studies}} examined, such as heterogeneity in study characteristics and low methodological quality in many studies. A 2012 {{systematic review}} found some supporting evidence that acupuncture was more effective than no treatment for chronic non-specific low back pain; the evidence was conflicting comparing the effectiveness over other treatment approaches. A 2011 systematic review of systematic reviews found that [...] "for chronic low back pain, individualized acupuncture is not better in reducing symptoms than formula acupuncture or sham acupuncture with <b>a</b> <b>toothpick</b> that does not penetrate the skin." [...] A 2010 review found that sham acupuncture was as effective as real acupuncture for chronic low back pain. The specific therapeutic effects of acupuncture were small, whereas its clinically relevant benefits were mostly due to contextual and psychosocial circumstances. Brain imaging {{studies have shown that}} traditional acupuncture and sham acupuncture differ in their effect on limbic structures, {{while at the same time}} showed equivalent analgesic effects. A 2005 Cochrane review found insufficient evidence to recommend for or against either acupuncture or dry needling for acute low back pain. The same review found low quality evidence for pain relief and improvement compared to no treatment or sham therapy for chronic low back pain only in the short term immediately after treatment. The same review also found that acupuncture is not more effective than conventional therapy and other alternative medicine treatments. A 2017 systematic review for an American College of Physicians clinical practice guideline found low to moderate evidence that acupuncture was effective for chronic low back pain, and limited evidence that it was effective for acute low back pain. The same review found that the strength of the evidence for both conditions was low to moderate. Another 2017 clinical practice guideline, this one produced by the Danish Health Authority, recommended against acupuncture for both recent-onset low back pain and lumbar radiculopathy.|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{a case of}} <b>an</b> {{ingested}} <b>toothpick</b> partially migrating {{from the}} sigmoid colon, causing massive lower gastrointestinal bleeding due to arterial-colic fistula, and stricture of the left ureter is presented. A 70 -year-old male {{was admitted to the}} emergency department after having feces mixed with fresh and coagulated blood for the past two days. Computed tomography and retrograde ureteropyelography showed the stricture of the left ureter, 1. 5 cm below the branching of iliac artery, without any signs of malignancy. Colonoscopy showed fresh blood in the rectum and sigmoid colon up to the neoplasm like granulation tissue mixed with fresh and coagulated blood, which almost obstructed the lumen. Explorative laparotomy showed <b>a</b> foreign body (<b>toothpick)</b> perforating the sigmoid colon through the mesenterial wall, and being stocked with one-third into the left internal iliac artery, causing arterial-colic fistula. The remaining part of the toothpick was surrounded by granulation tissue and chronic inflammatory process, pressing on the distal third of the left ureter. We conclude that <b>a</b> swallowed <b>toothpick</b> may cause <b>a</b> significant gastrointestinal injury {{with a wide variety of}} clinical manifestations, and it must be treated with caution. The imaging studies are often inadequate in detecting toothpicks, and thus, we insist on a physical examination, as the best indicator of injury...|$|R

2500|$|Once {{he lived}} in Florida he began taking photos of large estates {{including}} their grounds, their gardens, their specimen plants, the vistas as seen through their gates and sold them for extra income. The owners often voiced the thought that they wished they could be in color as these were the days before color film or digital cameras. To add color he used cotton twisted on <b>a</b> <b>toothpick</b> dipped in paint. In tinting {{he had to get}} acquainted with artist oils. He saw details of leaves and bark. He saw the natural arrangements of branches and trunks and this made him think about structure. Soon he had made the step from shading photographs to actual painting. His first painting was a canvas of a garden scene with a wall and large vases. It was hung in a Baltimore Show. From that painting forward he made time to paint. It was realistic work, always of plants. His early paintings in 1923 were categorized as [...] "Photographic". From there he began painting his series labeled [...] "Realistic" [...] paintings from 1925 to 1928. An unknown artist friend looked at one of his early efforts and made the comment {{that he did not have}} to paint every leaf. The period of details however survived until 1928 when the paintings became more stylized under the tutelage of Leopold Stokowski. This experience came about when Stokowski, a long-time friend of Mrs. Bovington, then employing Mulford as a landscape architect for her estate, told her he was looking for someone to accompany the family to Europe. Knowing the two individuals, she immediately recommended Mulford who accepted eagerly. Stokowski took him to Switzerland, France and Italy where they spent most of the summer of 1928 in the Alps. Stokowski was eager to see Europe through Mulford's eyes. He viewed life in a different way than Stokowski had experienced before. It was Mulford's great pleasure to explain plant life from his philosophical point of view. Stokowski was the disciplinarian for Mulford. He required a painting every day from him. It was almost by the demand of Stokowski that Mulford created over forty impressions of his experience that summer, the major portions being the French Alps in and around Haute Savoir. These paintings were compiled in a book Stokowski Sees that was privately printed but not published and the book is currently held by Michael Spencer who is still deciding on its future, although many drawings and paintings are held by family members from this era and his memories are recollected in memoir accounts. After his return from Europe he continued to paint with his newfound skills and outlook.|$|E
