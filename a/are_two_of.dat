5|$|By the 1820s, an {{extensive}} canal system had been constructed, giving {{greater access to}} natural resources and fuel for industries. During the Victorian era, the population of Birmingham grew rapidly to well over half a million and Birmingham became the second largest population centre in England. Birmingham was granted city status in 1889 by Queen Victoria. Joseph Chamberlain, mayor of Birmingham and later an MP, and his son Neville Chamberlain, who was Lord Mayor of Birmingham and later the British Prime Minister, <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> the most well-known political figures who have lived in Birmingham. The city established its own university in 1900.|$|E
5|$|Canberra {{has many}} venues for live music and theatre: the Canberra Theatre and Playhouse which hosts many major concerts and productions; and Llewellyn Hall (within the ANU School of Music), a {{world-class}} concert hall <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> the most notable. The Street Theatre is a venue with less mainstream offerings. The Albert Hall was the city's first performing arts venue, opened in 1928. It {{was the original}} performance venue for theatre {{groups such as the}} Canberra Repertory Society.|$|E
5|$|Heinrich Kreutz {{studied the}} orbits of the three great comets, and {{developed}} {{the idea that the}} three comets were fragments of a much larger progenitor comet which had broken up at an earlier perihelion passage. The fragmentation of the Great Comet of 1882 itself demonstrated that this was plausible. It is now thought that the Great Comet of 1882 is a fragment of X/1106 C1, and that Comet du Toit (C/1945 X1) and Comet Ikeya–Seki (C/1965 S1) <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> its sister fragments.|$|E

5|$|In the 18th and 19th centuries, Provence {{experienced}} {{a boom in}} sericulture that would last until the first world war, {{with much of the}} silk shipped north to Lyon. Viens and La Bastide-des-Jourdans <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> the communes of Luberon that profited the most from mulberry plantations that have since disappeared. However, silk centers still operate today.Working at home under the domestic system, silk spinning and silk treatment employed many people and increased the income of the working class.|$|E
5|$|Istanbul University, {{founded in}} 1453, {{is the oldest}} Turkish {{educational}} institution in the city. Although originally an Islamic school, the university established law, medicine, and science departments in the 19th century and was secularized after {{the founding of the}} Turkish Republic. Istanbul Technical University, founded in 1773, is the world's third-oldest university dedicated entirely to engineering sciences. These public universities <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> just eight across the city; other prominent state universities in Istanbul include the Mimar Sinan Fine Arts University, which served as Turkey's primary institution of art until the 1970s, and Marmara University, the country's third-largest institution of higher learning.|$|E
5|$|Its {{northern}} boundary (Roosevelt Road) {{marks the}} end of consecutively named east-west streets. East-west streets north of Roosevelt Road have street names except between State Street and Michigan Avenue. There are two block-long 8th and 11th Streets and a four-block 9th Street. Most streets south of Roosevelt simply use street numbers. Streets in this neighborhood from 13th to 26th are mostly numbered. Cullerton St (20th Street) & Cermak Road (22nd Street) <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> the few named east-west cross streets. Numbering continues southward in Chicago into the upper hundreds at a pace of 8 blocks per mile.|$|E

5|$|Like Highway401, {{a portion}} of the route is divided into a collector-express system with twelve to {{fourteen}} continuous lanes. Notable about Highway427 are its several multi-level interchanges; the junctions with QEW and Highway401 <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> the largest interchanges in Ontario and were constructed between 1967 and 1971, while the interchanges with Highway409 and Highway407 are more recent and were completed in 1992 and 1995, respectively.|$|E
5|$|On August 19, 1953, a burned crewman {{talks to}} three {{government}} agents about his {{experience on the}} submarine Zeus Faber, completing the story told in the previous episode. He explains that he and other crew members were locked in with their captain, who was infected by the black oil. After being knocked out from behind, the black oil leaves the captain's body and exits via a grate into the sea. It is revealed that Bill Mulder and the Smoking Man <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> the agents who are interviewing the crewman.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the early}} 20th century, {{the growth of}} Canada's manufacturing, mining, and service sectors has {{transformed}} the nation from a largely rural economy to an urbanized, industrial one. Like many other developed countries, the Canadian economy {{is dominated by the}} service industry, which employs about three-quarters of the country's workforce. However, Canada is unusual among developed countries in the importance of its primary sector, in which the forestry and petroleum industries <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> the most prominent components.|$|E

The Christian Science Monitor, headquartered in Boston, was formerly a worldwide daily newspaper but ended publication of daily print editions in 2009, switching to continuous online and weekly magazine format publications. The Boston Globe also releases a teen publication to the city's public high schools, called Teens in Print or T.i.P., which is {{written by the}} city's teens and delivered quarterly within the school year.|$|E
5|$|The Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> Antarctica's five largest ice streams.

5|$|The first {{inhabitants}} of North America are generally hypothesized to have migrated from Siberia {{by way of}} the Bering land bridge and arrived at least 15,000 years ago, though increasing evidence suggests an even earlier arrival. The Paleo-Indian archeological sites at Old Crow Flats and Bluefish Caves <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> the oldest sites of human habitation in Canada. The characteristics of Canadian indigenous societies included permanent settlements, agriculture, complex societal hierarchies, and trading networks. Some of these cultures had collapsed by the time European explorers arrived in the late 15th and early 16th centuries and have only been discovered through archeological investigations.|$|E

5|$|The {{geographical}} {{isolation and}} recent glacial history of Shetland {{have resulted in}} a depleted mammalian fauna and the brown rat and house mouse <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> only three species of rodent present on the islands. The Shetland field mouse is the third and the archipelago's fourth endemic subspecies, of which there are three varieties on Yell, Foula and Fair Isle. They are variants of Apodemus sylvaticus and archaeological evidence suggests that this species was present during the Middle Iron Age (around 200 BC to AD 400). It is possible that Apodemus was introduced from Orkney where a population has existed since at the least the Bronze Age.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of its closure, the stadium {{consisted}} of four separate all-seater stands; the pitch was aligned north-south, with the North Bank Stand (formerly the Laundry End) and South Stand (popularly known as the Clock End) at the ends of the field. The East and West Stands ran alongside the pitch and <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> the few examples of British football stands designed in the Art Deco style. The East Stand incorporated the club's offices and was well known for its marble halls (though the floors were actually terrazzo) which are often cited in media depictions of the stadium, and the facade that faces onto Avenell Road. The East Stand is considered architecturally significant enough to have been designated a Grade II listed building.|$|E
