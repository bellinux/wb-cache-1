40|$|This work {{addresses}} {{the key issues}} of the passivation of the III-V compound semiconductors surfaces {{and the quality of}} the III-V/oxide interfaces, constituting crucial aspects in the development and the implementation of next generation MOSFETs, based on the use of innovative and alternative materials other than the traditional silicon, such as III-V compounds. We have carried out a theoretical investigation on physical systems of relevance to this purpose, such as the oxidation of GaAs and the properties of the resulting GaAs/oxide interface. The methodology used is based on the state-of-the-art first principles modeling techniques. We first investigated the adsorption of molecular oxygen on the GaAs(001) -ß 2 (2 × 4) surface and provided both the dynamical picture of the reaction on the surface and the analysis of the energetics and the electronic properties of the adorbates. The results clearly indicated that the most stable type of O bonding, the bridging Ga-O-As bonds, do not show any signature of correlated electronic states in the forbidden gap. The importance of this study lies with the finding that it rules out the scenario of a Fermi level pinning of extrinsic nature, that is, a mechanism in which the onset of electronic defects in the gap could be directly associated to the incorporation on the surface of the adsorbing foreign chemical species. The conclusions rather suggest that defect states in the band gap are generated by the process of adsorption itself, disrupting the morphology of the reconstructed GaAs(001) surface, with attendant generation of structural defects on the surface. We next provided a detailed description at atomic scale of the oxidation of the GaAs(001) surface, through the modeling of the direct oxidation, based on ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. As a result of this study, we could depict an atomistic model of the surface oxidation in its early stages. Specifically, it allowed us to realize the important role played by the stress accumulating at the interface during the oxidation and, more importantly, to identify a key mechanism of stress release, namely, Ga atom ejection into the amorphous oxide atop. As a matter of fact, this latter results naturally in the generation and accumulation of native defects at the interface between the crystalline substrate and the amorphous oxide layer. We then provided a thorough description of the structural and electronic properties of the atomistic models describing the GaAs/oxide interface with a thin oxide film. We found a peaked feature of defect states in the gap for the GaAs/oxide interface models, in agreement with the results reported in the literature of electrical characterizations of this interface. Specifically, the interface models showed: a) an isolated As defect - an As dangling bond - that gives electronic states close to the valence band; b) a sharp feature of midgap states, which can be attributed to a cluster of interacting As dangling bonds; c) and a wider distribution of defect states was also found, located close to the conduction band and correlated with defective (undercoordinated) Ga atoms. We next extended the study to two other III-V semiconductors, InAs and In 0. 5 Ga 0. 5 As, and investigated the properties of the interfaces formed with their native oxides. We generated a set of InAs/oxide and In 0. 5 Ga 0. 5 As/oxide interfaces models by using the GaAs ones as template structures. The analysis of the structural properties highlighted two main differences among the III-V/oxide models investigated: a) an increase of the coordination number of the cation atoms in the amorphous oxide with growing In content; and b) a considerable elongation of the length of the In-O bond compared to the Ga-O one. Another interesting finding is the observation of a clear trend in the structural changes occurring upon the introduction of indium, comprising a densification of the <b>amorphous</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>film.</b> These results suggest that the incorporation of indium, with a higher atomic radius than gallium, promotes the formation of chemical bonds in the amorphous oxide and at the interface that result locally into an increase of the atomic coordination number, and overall, in a densification of the amorphous film. We finally reviewed the electronic properties of the generated III-V/oxide interfaces models. We observed two main differences for the InAs case as compared to GaAs: a) a shift of the defect states distribution towards the edges of the band gap, due to the band gap shrinking associated with the presence of In in the semiconductor, and b) a reduction in the density of the interface states distribution with increasing In content. As to the origin of these improved electronic properties of the III-V/oxide interfaces with In content, a major role is played by the structural properties of indium in the oxide. The latter favors a structural local rearrangement in both the amorphous layer and at the interface, leading to a partial saturation of the dangling bonds. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|The optical {{properties}} of some thin film materials {{can be altered}} by an external stimulus. Photochromic and thermochromic materials, including inorganic and organic substances, have {{optical properties}} that can be changed in a reversible manner by irradiation and temperature respectively. These materials {{can be used in}} applications such as radiation or thermal sensors, information storage devices and smart window applications in buildings and cars. ^ In this work, major effort was concentrated on passive thermal control coatings based on photochromic and thermochromic materials. The inorganic photochromic materials were based on tungsten and molybdenum <b>oxide</b> <b>films</b> and the organic photochromic materials included spiropyrans and spirooxazines. In addition, photochromic composite organic-inorganic films and thermochromic vanadium <b>oxide</b> <b>films</b> were prepared. The samples were synthesized using sputtering, sol-gel process, and thermal oxidation. The optical properties were investigated for the first time by ultraviolet/visible/infrared (UV/VIS/IR) spectroscopic ellipsometry, attenuated total reflection (ATR) infrared ellipsometry, spectrophotometry, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). ^ For <b>amorphous</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>films,</b> the oxygen deficiency was important in determining the photochromic properties of the films. In the mid-infrared region, no photochromism was observed for the films. ^ The optical properties of organic-inorganic composite films changed in the VIS/NIR wavelength region markedly in a reversible process, with UV irradiation. The composite films containing tungsten heteropolyoxometalate (HPOM) showed faster coloration and bleaching than pure tungsten <b>oxide</b> <b>films.</b> The composite films with molybdenum HPOM showed faster coloration and much slower bleaching than tungsten HPOM. ^ The spiropyran and spirooxazine doped polymeric films were investigated for the first time using infrared and ATR ellipsometry. The infrared optical functions obtained by ATR measurements were a little smaller than bulk optical functions although the optical functions obtained by standard ellipsometry were consistent with bulk optical functions. UV irradiation caused larger absorption changes in the mid-infrared region in spiropyrans than in spirooxazines. ^ Phase identification of the vanadium <b>oxide</b> <b>films</b> was determined using XRD. The optical functions of some vanadium oxides were calculated using UV/VIS/IR ellipsometry. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{layer of}} <b>amorphous</b> thick anodic <b>oxide</b> <b>film</b> was formed on Ti 6 Al 4 V {{substrate}} after anodization, and its thickness achieved 30 - 40 µm. After immersion in SBF, anodized sample and substrate indicated different corrosion resistance. According to icorr, Rp and Ecorr, the concerned experimental results of potentiodynamic polarization curves, the anodic <b>oxide</b> <b>film</b> provided effective corrosion protection, {{which could be}} attributed to its relatively uniform, smooth, compact and intact microstructure. And the results of total immersion test also proved the protective role of the anodic film...|$|R
