5000|$|Miranda {{applies only}} to [...] "testimonial" [...] {{evidence}} as that term is defined under the Fifth Amendment. For purposes of the Fifth <b>Amendment,</b> testimonial <b>statements</b> mean communications that explicitly or implicitly relate a factual assertion assertion of fact or belief or disclose information. The Miranda rule does not prohibit compelling a person to engage in non-assertive conduct that is incriminating or may produce incriminating evidence. Thus, requiring a suspect to participate in identification procedures such as giving handwriting or voice exemplars, fingerprints, DNA samples, hair samples, and dental impressions is not within the Miranda rule. Such physical or real evidence is non-testimonial and not protected by the Fifth Amendment self-incrimination clause. On the other hand, certain non-verbal conduct may be testimonial. For example, if the male suspect nodded his head {{up and down in}} response to the question [...] "did you kill the victim" [...] the conduct is testimonial, it is the same as saying [...] "yes I did" [...] and Miranda would apply.|$|R

Substantive changes address elements of the preferred alternative {{for each of these}} actions. As part of Amendment 18, the FMP has also been updated to better reflect the current management framework. Table 1 shows changes in the organization of chapters under Amendment 18. Text has been revised in chapters 1, 2, 6, 9, 10, and 11 of the current FMP under Amendment 18. Text in chapters 1, 6, and 7 (a new chapter created by Amendment 18) has been revised under Amendment 19. Because of changes in the chapter structure, chapter 8 is renumbered chapter 9 and chapter 12 is renumbered chapter 11, but no other changes are made in these chapters. Chapter 6, Management Measures, has been substantially reorganized and revised. Material in chapter 9 (Restrictions On Other Fisheries) and chapter 11 (Management Measures that Continue in Effect with Implementation of Amendment 4) have been incorporated into chapter 6, outdated references to foreign and joint-venture fishing have been deleted, and the structure of the chapter has been modified to emphasize the range of management measures available to the Council.

50|$|The {{membership}} of the North American Lutheran Church is composed of congregations and ordained pastors who have subscribed to the church's constitution. Provided that member congregations' beliefs and practices are compatible with the NALC, congregations can simultaneously affiliate with other Lutheran church bodies. Ministers and elected lay delegates represent their congregations in the annual convocation. This body elects the bishop, executive council, and other leadership positions. It also approves budgetary items and teaching statements. Certain actions of the convocation, such as constitutional <b>amendments</b> and teaching <b>statements,</b> must first be ratified by a majority or, in some cases, a two-thirds majority of NALC congregations before they take effect. The North American Lutheran Church is divided into 24 mission districts, usually based on geographical groupings of congregations.

40|$|The FASB {{recently}} issued Proposed Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, Accounting for Hedging Activities: An <b>Amendment</b> of FASB <b>Statement</b> No. 133. The proposed standard {{simplifies the}} accounting for hedging activities and generally increases {{the appeal of}} hedge accounting. In this report we survey firms' reporting practices and examine hedges and hedge accounting generally and seek to determine why firms may decide not to designate derivatives as hedges for accounting purposes. In reviewing the reports of a large sample of firms, we find the following four explicit reasons why companies may decide not to designate derivatives as accounting hedges: (1) the substantial cost of documentation and ongoing monitoring of designated hedges; (2) the availability of natural hedges that can be highly effective; (3) a new accounting standard that broadens the applicability of natural or economic hedges; and (4) qualifying hedges are not available or are too costly or documentation is untimely, inadequate, or unavailable. In addition, a fifth reason, not offered as such by the surveyed firms, is the increased risk of restatement that accompanies hedge accounting. The proposed standard combined with the recently-released SFAS 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Liabilities, offer companies a welcome relief to the onerous accounting and reporting requirements of SFAS 133. 13 page(s...|$|R
