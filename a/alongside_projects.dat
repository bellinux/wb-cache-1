50|$|Joss Whedon was {{credited}} as executive producer throughout {{the run of}} the series, and for the first five seasons (1997-2001) he was also the showrunner, supervising the writing and all aspects of production. Marti Noxon took on the role for seasons six and seven (2001-2003), but Whedon continued to be involved with writing and directing Buffy <b>alongside</b> <b>projects</b> such as Angel, Fray, and Firefly. Fran Rubel Kuzui and her husband, Kaz Kuzui, were credited as executive producers but were not involved in the show.

50|$|As {{the center}} of {{industrial}} wealth in the region shifted from Grosse Pointe to Bloomfield Hills, so too did Keyes’s projects. Keyes had already been working in Bloomfield Hills (starting in the 1930s—see Welch and Lake Park House below) when Louis Clifford Goad (Executive Vice President of General Motors Company) hired him to design his estate there. Goad House was featured in Fortune magazine in 1955 (<b>alongside</b> <b>projects</b> of Philip Johnson, Edward Durell Stone, and David Adler) {{as an example of}} the first resurgence of Americans “building big expensive houses again” since the Great Depression (with reference to Keyes designing several at the time). Goad House is privately nestled off of evergreen-lined Lone Pine Road, within view of historic Christ Church and down the road from Albert Kahn’s Cranbrook House. The twelve-room house incorporates Keyes’s signature symmetrical bow-fronted wings, clean white brick façade and wrought iron railings, and includes contrasting French shutters and a Palladian, Ionic colonnaded and pedimented front portico with spiral volutes. Fortune said that “Mrs. Goad’s desire for southern-style pillars and white-painted brick was gratified by architect Hugh Keyes. As in many other big houses, the formal living room and dining room are seldom used; the family lives in the library or on the porch (conservatory), usually eats in the breakfast room. The house has an ultra-mechanized kitchen installed by G.M.” The integrated conservatory overlooks the south sloping grounds, with an unusual oval, stone, and “terraced garden and wooded section which lead to a stream,” a tributary of the River Rouge. The exterior of the house was a filming location in the 2013 film The Ides of March, as the senator’s mansion. (Keyes’s McLouth House, a block away, was used as the formal interior of the house in the film.) Goad died in the house in 1979.|$|E

50|$|The term product {{assurance}} (PA) {{is often used}} instead of quality assurance and is, <b>alongside</b> <b>project</b> management and engineering, {{one of the three}} primary project functions. Quality assurance is seen as one part of {{product assurance}}. Due to the sometimes catastrophic consequences a single failure can have for human lives, the environment, a device, or a mission, product assurance plays a particularly important role here. It has organizational, budgetary and product developmental independence meaning that it reports to highest management only, has its own budget, and does not expend labor to help build a product. Product assurance stands on an equal footing with project management but embraces the customer's point of view.|$|R
