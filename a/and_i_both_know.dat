2500|$|Gilbert {{wrote to}} a colleague, [...] "I {{sometimes}} wish I had never built the Woolworth Building because I fear it may be regarded as my only work and you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>both</b> <b>know</b> that {{whatever it may be}} in dimension and in certain lines it is after all only skyscraper." ...|$|E
2500|$|... 1983 – In the Doctor Who episode [...] "Mawdryn Undead", the Doctor {{mentions}} the theorem in passing (quoting it as [...] "a treeful of monkeys"), stating to Tegan that [...] "you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>both</b> <b>know,</b> {{at the end}} of a millennium they'd still be tapping out gibberish." [...] Tegan's response: [...] "And you'd be tapping it out right alongside them." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, {{speaking}} to Henry Kissinger, President Richard Nixon said [...] "You <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>both</b> <b>know</b> they can’t {{go back to}} the other [...] borders. But we must not, on the other hand, say that because the Israelis win this war, as they won the '67 War, that we just go on with status quo. It can't be done." [...] Kissinger replied [...] "I couldn't agree more" ...|$|E
5000|$|Betty Box {{said she}} was [...] "very {{surprised}} Rank let me do it... because they were very politically conservative as an organisation. Perhaps they liked the Peter Finch character being so corrupt because, after all, he was left wing. I must say I liked it very much... I enjoyed making it very much. I loved working with Peter Finch. He was drunk some of the time, and not always very easy, but I was just very fond of him. Ralph <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> {{how to work with}} him." ...|$|R
60|$|I kept {{no record}} of the time, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> cannot now recall the exact date on which the first {{favorable}} change took place. I only remember that it was toward sunrise on a fine winter morning when we were relieved at last of our heavy burden of suspense. The surgeon happened to be by the bedside when his patient awoke. The first thing he did, after looking at Eustace, was to caution me by a sign to be silent and {{to keep out of}} sight. My mother-in-law <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> what this meant. With full hearts we thanked God together for giving us back the husband and the son.|$|R

6000|$|... "You <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>both</b> <b>know</b> {{the value}} of these things," [...] he went on, with a little sweep of the hand. [...] "We know {{the value of}} them because we were once {{accustomed}} to them, because we have both since experienced the passionate craving for them or the things they represent. Chippendale furniture, a Turkey carpet, roses in January, hothouse fruit, Bartolozzi prints, do not march with an income of fifty pounds a year." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, between you, {{keep an eye}} on her," [...] Hunterleys advised. [...] "And, Sidney, I don't want to make {{a coward}} of you, and you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>both</b> <b>know</b> that if there's danger ahead it's our job to face it, but have a care up at the Villa Mimosa. I don't fancy the law of this Principality would see you out of any trouble if they got an idea that you were an English Secret Service man." ...|$|E
500|$|Bundy {{confessed to}} 30 homicides, but the true total remains unknown. Published {{estimates}} have {{run as high}} as 100 or more, and Bundy occasionally made cryptic comments to encourage that speculation. He told Hugh Aynesworth in 1980 that for every murder [...] "publicized", there [...] "could be one that was not." [...] When FBI agents proposed a total tally of 36, Bundy responded, [...] "Add one digit to that, and you'll have it." [...] Years later he told attorney Polly Nelson that the common estimate of 35 was accurate, but Robert Keppel wrote that [...] " [...] <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> [...] was much higher." [...] "I don't think even he knew ... how many he killed, or why he killed them", said Rev. Fred Lawrence, the Methodist clergyman who administered Bundy's last rites. [...] "That was my impression, my strong impression." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1978, after {{studying}} film at UCLA, Michael McGreevey collaborated with his father, John McGreevey, on {{the script for}} the 1978 made-for-TV movie Ruby and Oswald: [...] "In reality, the movie, although it's called Ruby and Oswald, is a three-way depiction of those four days in Dallas where we cut {{back and forth between}} the documentary footage of Kennedy and the recreated story with Ruby and Oswald. Dad <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> a man named Alan Landsburg, who had done a lot of documentaries. We went to him with the project first and he knew Mel Stuart, who had done an Academy Award-winning documentary called Four Days in November (1964). So, Mel was attached to direct it and we went into CBS and sold it right away as a three-hour special event movie. I was very proud of that movie; it was very well done." ...|$|R
60|$|My {{father and}} Eustace rode {{with us from}} London to Dover, {{and all the time}} I kept close to them. M. de Bellaise was well enough to ride too. His uncle, the marquis, went in a great old coach with the ladies, wives of some of his suite, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> should have been there too, but that I begged so hard to ride with my father that he yielded, after asking M. le Vicomte whether he had any objection. M. le Vicomte opened great eyes, smiled, blushed and bowed, {{stammering}} something. I do not think that he had a quite realised previously that I was his wife, and belonged to him. My father made him ride with us, and talked to him; and out in the open air, riding with the wind in our cheeks, and his plume streaming in the breeze, he grew much less shy, and began to talk about the wolf-hunts and boar-hunts in the Bocage, and of all the places that my father <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> as well as if we had seen them, from the grandam's stories.|$|R
6000|$|... "You will understand," [...] Mannering said, as the brougham drove off, [...] "that you and I are {{speaking}} together merely as friends. I have nothing official {{to say to}} you. It would be presumption on my part {{to assume that the}} time is ripe for anything definite while you are still at the head of an unbeaten Government. But one learns to read the signs of the times. I think that you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>both</b> <b>know</b> that you cannot last the session." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Some one has," [...] Crawshay replied bitterly, [...] "and you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>both</b> <b>know</b> who it is, Miss Beverley. But," [...] he went on, {{holding the}} gangway railing {{as she turned}} to descend, [...] "it's only {{the first part of}} the game that's over. Our friend has won on the sea, but I have an idea that we shall have him on land. We shall have him yet, and we'll catch him red-handed if I have {{anything}} to do with it. Will you wish us luck?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>both</b> <b>know,</b> Lutchester," [...] he said, [...] "that {{the last}} thing we want is to find America dragged into this war. Such a {{happening}} would be nothing more nor less than a catastrophe in itself, {{to say nothing of the}} internal dissensions here. On the other hand, as things are now, Washington is becoming a perfect arena for diplomatic chicanery, and I have just an instinct--I can't define it in any way--which leads me to believe that some fresh trouble has started within the last twenty-four hours." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Last Monday," [...] Bellamy went on, {{leaning forward}} and {{speaking}} in a soft but very distinct undertone, [...] "a man was murdered late {{at night in the}} heart of the city--within one hundred yards of the Stock Exchange. The papers called it a mysterious murder. No one knows who the man was, or who committed the crime, or why. You <b>and</b> <b>I,</b> Laverick, <b>both</b> <b>know</b> a little more than the rest of the world." ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{decision}} {{to break up}} {{came as a surprise}} to many in the industry who believed Bardot {{was in the process of}} establishing a strong and credible reputation. Rumours circulated that the split was a result of Monk's desire to begin a solo career, though she denied this. In 2004, during an interview with FHM magazine, Polihronas revealed, [...] "I think when Sophie went solo, everyone assumed that it was she who broke up the band, which wasn't right. I don't know whether I should say this, but I wanted out for a long time. Sophie <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> that we were going to fulfil the last album and then move on, but Sophie stayed with the management, <b>and</b> continued on. <b>I</b> took a whole year off without even thinking about it." [...] Soon after Bardot's split, Wood confirmed that at the time, both she and Chapple were the two members keen to continue as Bardot. All members, apart from Polihronas, have launched into solo music careers with varying levels of success (see Solo releases), as well as other fields such as acting and fashion.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{scarcely}} know," [...] Deane said, [...] "how we are {{to continue}} this discussion. For some reason or other, you are sitting there within {{a few feet of}} me and denying something which we both know to be the truth. You have a motive, I suppose, but whatever that motive may be, you cannot imperil it by speaking openly here. We are absolutely alone. There is not a soul within hearing. You <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>both</b> <b>know,</b> Miss Rowan, that you hold that paper to obtain which your brother risked his life and met with such misfortune. It would be his wish, I know, that you should give it to me. The terms I offered him for its recovery were surely liberal. If you think otherwise, tell me your price. We are alone. You are not giving yourself away. Tell me your price!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Harrison," [...] he said, [...] "I am engaged just now, as {{you have}} doubtless surmised, in certain {{investigations}} {{on behalf of the}} usual third party whom we need not name. Those investigations have reached a pitch which might possibly lead me into a position of some--well, I might almost say danger. You <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>both</b> <b>know</b> that there are weapons in this place which can be made use of by persons wholly without scruples, which are scarcely available at home. I want you to keep your eyes open. I have very few friends here whom I can wholly trust. It is my purpose to call in here every morning at ten o'clock for my letters, and if I fail to arrive within half-an-hour of that time without having given you verbal notice, something will have happened to me. You understand what I mean?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No {{honest man}} will deny it," [...] said the scout, a little nettled at the implied {{distrust}} of his {{explanation of the}} mystery of the tides; [...] "and I grant that it is true on the small scale, and where the land is level. But everything depends on what scale you look at things. Now, on the small scale, the 'arth is level; but on the large scale it is round. In this manner, pools and ponds, and even the great fresh-water lake, may be stagnant, as you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>both</b> <b>know</b> they are, having seen them; but when you come to spread water over a great tract, like the sea, where the earth is round, how in reason can the water be quiet? You might as well expect the river to lie still on the brink of those black rocks a mile above us, though your own ears tell you that it is tumbling over them at this very moment!" ...|$|E
5000|$|The short {{tour of the}} United States {{focused on}} the West Coast. The {{majority}} of the shows found Pearl Jam serving as the opening act for Alice in Chains on the band's Facelift tour. Bassist Jeff Ament said, [...] "We were then {{in the mode of}} 'Well, we’ve got to write a bunch of songs.' It wasn’t long after that we got a tour with Alice in Chains. It was kind of how we wanted it to be, we didn’t want to fuck around. <b>I</b> think Stone <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> the potential that he <b>and</b> <b>I</b> had together—but we needed to get out and play, and get better." [...] Following the tour, the band soon signed to Epic Records. However, concerns about trademark issues with the name [...] "Mookie Blaylock" [...] necessitated a name change; the band's name became [...] "Pearl Jam". This was Pearl Jam's only tour with original drummer Dave Krusen. Krusen left the band in May 1991 following the completion of the recording sessions for the band's debut album, Ten. Footage from the February 10, 1991 concert at The Bacchanal in San Diego, California can be found on Alice in Chains' Music Bank: The Videos DVD.|$|R

2500|$|Tony and Mandy begin a relationship. Dunn {{said that}} when she was first {{informed}} of the storyline she was surprised. She added that although she felt the pairing was unlikely, [...] "it did actually work". The pair marry and later have a child who they name Grace. Grace dies from suspected SIDS and the pair split. Pickard said [...] "If they hadn't lost a child, they might have stayed together the first time round. They were really happy before that happened". Dunn said that the storyline worked well, saying [...] "as much as it was really difficult. By that stage, Nick <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> how we would play things and it worked". Tony leaves Hollyoaks with Mandy and her daughter. Tony returns three months later without Mandy. Dunn explained the reason for Tony leaving Mandy saying: [...] "Mandy told Tony she couldn't have more children and he freaked out and left her in Laos". Dunn revealed Mandy wanted revenge for this. In 2011 Tony leaves the village and returns three months later having reinvented himself. Pickard said despite Tony's changes [...] "Tony is still the same person and he loves Mandy". Speaking about the couple's future, Dunn told Taryn Davies of Femalefirst: [...] "they've been on and off for years and they're a great couple <b>and</b> <b>I</b> think that they make a great couple <b>and</b> <b>I</b> think it's such a shame that just as they get happy something horrendous happens again.

I am willing at mid-day to-morrow, or rather to-day, to place within his hands the sum required. I am willing to send my notary {{with him to the}} office, and the affair could be arranged at half-past twelve. From then he practically owns Le Jour. Its politics are his to control. I make him this offer, mademoiselle, and it is a greater one than it sounds, for the money which I place in his hands to make this purchase--five hundred thousand francs--is his completely and absolutely. You move at once into apartments befitting your new position. Monsieur Paul Jesen is no longer a struggling and ill-paid journalist.

60|$|DEARTH (in {{a hopeless}} attempt at self-defence). I want you, you see, to do {{everything}} exquisitely. I do wish I could leave you to do things a little more for yourself.

40|$|Urinary tract infections (UTI) {{are among}} the most common infections in humans. Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC), the main causative agent of UTIs, can invade and {{replicate}} within bladder epithelial cells, and recent evidence demonstrated that some UPEC strains also survive within macrophages. To understand the mechanisms of host subversion that enable UPEC to survive within macrophages, and the contribution of macrophages to UPEC-mediated pathology, I performed host 1 ̆ 00014 pathogen co-transcriptome analyses using RNA sequencing. I developed an effective computational framework that simultaneously separated, annotated, and quantified the mammalian and bacterial transcriptomes. First, mouse bone morrow-derived macrophages (BMM) were challenged over a 24 h time course with UPEC reference strains, UTI 89 (cystitis strain), 83972 and VR 50 (asymptomatic bacteriuria strains) that possess contrasting intramacrophage phenotypes. My results showed that BMM responded to the three different UPEC strains with broadly similar gene expression programs. In contrast to the conserved pattern of BMM responses, the transcriptional responses of the different UPEC strains diverged markedly from each other. Hypothesizing that genes upregulated at 24 h post-infection may contribute to intramacrophage survival, I identified UTI 89 genes upregulated at this time point, and showed that deletion of one of these genes (pspA) compromised intramacrophage survival of UPEC strain UTI 89. Second, human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDM) and BMM were challenged over a 24 h course with the UPEC strain EC 958, a globally disseminated, multi-drug resistant strain. My analysis identified extensive divergence in UPEC-regulated orthologous gene expression between HMDM <b>and</b> BMM, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> validated <b>both</b> <b>known</b> <b>and</b> novel genes in the context of differential regulation. On the contrary, the transcriptional response of EC 958 showed a broad conservation across both mammalian intramacrophage environments. My study thus provides both a unique co-culture approach to study infection in vitro and a technological framework for simultaneously capturing global changes in host 1 ̆ 00014 pathogen interactions at the transcriptional level in co-cultures. In conclusion, this work has generated new insights into the mechanisms that UPEC strains exploit to persist within the mouse intramacrophage environment, as well as differences in the transcriptional repertoire of HMDM and BMM challenged with the same UPEC strain...|$|R
