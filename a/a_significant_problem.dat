5|$|Rhabdomyolysis {{occurs in}} about 26,000 {{people a year}} in the United States. While the {{condition}} has been commented on throughout history, the first modern description was following an earthquake in 1908. Important discoveries as to its mechanism were made during the Blitz of London in 1941. It is <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>problem</b> for those injured in earthquakes and relief efforts for such disasters often include medical teams equipped to treat survivors with rhabdomyolysis.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{importance}} of tourism to the Croatian economy, areas frequented by tourists (or near major tourist routes) have been given priority for demining. Other safety-related areas receiving demining priority are settlements, commercial and industrial facilities and all documented minefields. Agricultural land, infrastructure and forests are grouped in three priority categories depending on their economic significance. National parks in Croatia were also demined as top-priority areas, along with areas significant for fire protection. Theft of minefield signs is <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>problem,</b> and is particularly pronounced in areas with concerns among the local population that the signs harm tourism. The signs are regularly replaced, sometimes with concrete or masonry structures to display them instead of metal poles. Since the 1990s, only one tourist has been injured by a land mine in Croatia.|$|E
5|$|Forest pests present <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>problem</b> {{because it}} is not easy to access the canopy and monitor pest populations. In addition, {{forestry}} pests such as bark beetles, kept under control by natural enemies in their native range, may be transported large distances in cut timber to places where they have no natural predators, enabling them to cause extensive economic damage. Pheromone traps have been used to monitor pest populations in the canopy. These release volatile chemicals that attract males. Pheromone traps can detect the arrival of pests or alert foresters to outbreaks. For example, spruce budworm has been monitored using pheromone traps in Canadian forests for several decades.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, {{finding a}} {{suitable}} adhesive was <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>problem.</b> After unsuccessful experiments {{with a variety}} of candidates, somebody suggested birdlime – a viscous sticky compound used since ancient times to trap birds by spreading it on tree branches and waiting for birds to get stuck. Birdlime performed better than anything previously tested, but it was still not good enough. Macrae's tin of birdlime was labelled with a large letter 'K' and an indication that tin came from Stockport but with no more clues as to the manufacturer. Macrae got on a train to Stockport and there found a helpful taxi driver who took him to Kay Brothers Ltd. The company's Chief Chemist was soon working on the problem of a suitable adhesive and within a matter of weeks the problem was solved to Macrae's satisfaction.|$|E
5|$|One {{method is}} to use the ground as a heat sink by drawing air through {{underground}} pipes. This is often done to provide a source of cool air for a building by means of a ground-coupled heat exchanger (also known as Earth tubes), wherein condensation is typically regarded as <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>problem.</b> A major problem with such designs is that the underground tubes are subject to contamination and difficult to keep clean. Designs of this type require air to be drawn through the pipes by a fan, but the power required may be provided (or supplemented) by a wind turbine.|$|E
5|$|The Russian 30.5cm shore {{batteries}} at Zerel remained <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>problem,</b> and {{so while}} Kaiser was disrupting the Russian destroyers, Kaiserin, König Albert, and Friedrich der Grosse bombarded Zerel at ranges of between 7.5 and 12.5 miles. Russian counter-fire proved accurate, {{and so the}} German dreadnoughts were forced to continually alter course to avoid being hit. The attack lasted only about an hour, due to fears of mines and submarines. The following morning, two König-class battleships were sent into Moon Sound to destroy the Russian ships stationed there. König sank the pre-dreadnought Slava, while Kronprinz forced {{the withdrawal of the}} remaining warships. By 20 October, the naval operations were effectively over; the Russian ships had been destroyed or forced to withdraw, and the German army attained its objectives.|$|E

5|$|The Virgin Islands dwarf sphaero or Virgin Islands dwarf gecko (Sphaerodactylus parthenopion) is {{a species}} of gecko and {{also one of the}} {{smallest}} terrestrial vertebrates. It has only been found on three of the British Virgin Islands: Virgin Gorda, Tortola, and Moskito Island (also spelled “Mosquito Island”). It was discovered in 1964 and is suspected to be a close relative of Sphaerodactylus nicholsi, a dwarf sphaero from the nearby island of Puerto Rico. It shares its range with the big-scaled least gecko (S.macrolepis), which is found in leaf litter. Unlike this larger gecko, the Virgin Islands dwarf sphaero lives on drier hillsides, yet prefers moist microhabitats found under rocks because it lacks the adaptations necessary for preventing water loss, which is <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>problem</b> due to its small body size.|$|E
5|$|The {{main roads}} through the Peak District are the A57 (Snake Pass) between Sheffield and Manchester, the A628 (Woodhead Pass) between Barnsley and Manchester via Longdendale, the A6 from Derby to Manchester via Buxton, the Cat and Fiddle road from Macclesfield to Buxton, {{and in the}} extreme north of the Park the A635 (Saddleworth Moor) running from Manchester to Barnsley and the A62 from Manchester to Leeds, which forms the northernmost border of the National Park at Standedge. These major roads, {{together}} with other minor roads and lanes in the area, are attractive to drivers, but the Peak's popularity makes road congestion {{and the availability of}} parking spaces <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>problem,</b> especially during summer. This led to the proposal of a congestion charge in 2005, but this was later rejected.|$|E
5|$|The {{permissive}} attitude toward business {{did not always}} extend toward large corporations. A lack of venture capital in the state became <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>problem</b> with the early industry. Civic and business leaders, and even ordinary citizens, worried that the influx of capital from outside the state {{would lead to a}} loss of political power, revenue, and business opportunities. This sentiment led to a series of antitrust lawsuits by the state Attorney General starting in 1906. The lawsuits easily succeeded and limited the ability of outside investors, most notably Standard Oil, to gain control of the state oil companies.|$|E

5|$|The {{presence}} of certain signs, termed red flags, indicate {{the need for}} further testing to look for more serious underlying problems, which may require immediate or specific treatment. The {{presence of}} a red flag does not mean that there is <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>problem.</b> It is only suggestive, and most people with red flags have no serious underlying problem. If no red flags are present, performing diagnostic imaging or laboratory testing in the first four weeks after the start of the symptoms has not been shown to be useful.|$|E
5|$|The rebel barons {{responded by}} {{inviting}} the French prince Louis to lead them: Louis had {{a claim to}} the English throne {{by virtue of his}} marriage to Blanche of Castile, a granddaughter of Henry II. Philip may have provided him with private support but refused to openly support Louis, who was excommunicated by Innocent for taking part in the war against John. Louis' planned arrival in England presented <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>problem</b> for John, as the prince would bring with him naval vessels and siege engines essential to the rebel cause. Once John contained Alexander in Scotland, he marched south to deal with the challenge of the coming invasion.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 339 BC, the Thebans had seized the town of Nicaea near Thermopylae, which Philip had garrisoned in 346 BC. Philip {{does not appear to have}} treated this as a {{declaration}} of war, but it nevertheless presented him with <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>problem,</b> blocking the main route into Greece. However, a second route into central Greece was available. In 480 BC, during the Battle of Thermopylae, the Persian king Xerxes had sent his army via a mountain track (the Anopea) to outflank the pass. From this track, on the western side of Mount Kallidromon, another road led off and descended in Phocis. In 480 BC, a thousand Phocian troops were stationed above Thermopylae to guard the road and prevent a Persian assault on Phocis (though they notably failed to prevent the Persians using Anopea). However, in 339 BC, the Greeks had either forgotten the existence of this road, or believed that Philip would not use it; the subsequent failure to guard this road allowed Philip to slip into central Greece unhindered.|$|E

5|$|Because the {{aviation}} industry is especially {{sensitive to the}} weather, accurate weather forecasting is essential. Fog or exceptionally low ceilings can prevent many aircraft from landing and taking off. Turbulence and icing are also significant in-flight hazards. Thunderstorms are a problem for all aircraft because of severe turbulence due to their updrafts and outflow boundaries, icing due to the heavy precipitation, as well as large hail, strong winds, and lightning, {{all of which can}} cause severe damage to an aircraft in flight. Volcanic ash is also <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>problem</b> for aviation, as aircraft can lose engine power within ash clouds. On a day-to-day basis airliners are routed {{to take advantage of the}} jet stream tailwind to improve fuel efficiency. Aircrews are briefed prior to takeoff on the conditions to expect en route and at their destination. Additionally, airports often change which runway is being used to take advantage of a headwind. This reduces the distance required for takeoff, and eliminates potential crosswinds.|$|E
5|$|In {{large part}} due to the rapid {{population}} growth, cholera became <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>problem.</b> In 1849, a major cholera epidemic killed nearly 5,000 people, leading to a new sewer system and the draining of a mill pond. Cemeteries were removed to the outskirts to Bellefontaine Cemetery and Calvary Cemetery to reduce groundwater contamination. In the same year, a large fire broke out on a steamboat on the levee, spread to 23 other boats, and destroyed {{a large portion of the}} center city. The St. Louis landing was significantly improved during the 1850s. Using the engineering planning of Robert E. Lee, levees were constructed on the Illinois side to direct water toward Missouri to eliminate sand bars that threatened the landing. Another infrastructure improvement was the city's water system, which was begun in the early 1830s and was continually improved and expanded in the 1840s and 1850s.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of 339 BC, the Thebans had seized the town of Nicaea near Thermopylae, which Philip had garrisoned in 346 BC. Philip {{does not appear to}} have treated this as a {{declaration}} of war, but it nevertheless presented him with <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>problem,</b> blocking the main route into Greece. However, a second route into central Greece was available, leading over the shoulder of Mount Callidromos and descending into Phocis. However, the Athenians and Thebans had either forgotten the existence of this road, or believed that Philip would not use it; the subsequent failure to guard this road allowed Philip to slip into central Greece unhindered. Philip's relatively lenient treatment of the Phocians at the end of the Third Sacred War in 346 BC now bore fruit. Reaching Elatea, he ordered the city to be re-populated, and during the next few months the whole Phocian Confederation was restored to its former state. This provided Philip with a base in Greece, and new, grateful allies in the Phocians. Philip probably arrived in Phocis in November 339 BC, but the Battle of Chaeronea did not occur until August 338 BC. During this period Philip discharged his responsibility to the Amphicytonic council by settling the situation in Amphissa. He tricked a force of 10,000 mercenaries who were guarding the road from Phocis to Amphissa into abandoning their posts, then took Amphissa and expelled its citizens, turning it over to Delphi. He probably also engaged in diplomatic attempts to avoid further conflict in Greece, although if so, he was unsuccessful.|$|E
