50|$|Flight 073 was {{operated}} with a Airbus A320-212, {{serial number}} 481, registration A4O-EK. It was first flown on 16 May 1994, and was delivered new to Gulf Air on September 1994. The aircraft was powered by two CFM International CFM56-5A3 engines. It had accumulated more than 17,000 hours in 14,000 cycles before the crash. Its last maintenance {{was conducted on}} 17-18 August 2000. The aircraft was in compliance with all <b>applicable</b> <b>airworthiness</b> <b>directives</b> for the airframe and engines.|$|R
500|$|Flight 370 was {{operated}} with a Boeing 777-2H6ER, {{serial number}} 28420, registration 9M-MRO. It was the 404th Boeing 777 produced, first flown on 14 May 2002, and was delivered new to Malaysia Airlines on 31 May 2002. The aircraft was powered by two Rolls-Royce Trent 892 engines and configured to carry 282 passengers. It had accumulated 53,471.6 hours and 7,526 [...] in service {{and had not}} previously been involved in any major incidents, though a minor incident while taxiing at Shanghai Pudong International Airport in August 2012 resulted in a broken wing tip. Its last maintenance [...] "Acheck" [...] was carried out on 23 February 2014. The aircraft was in compliance with all <b>applicable</b> <b>Airworthiness</b> <b>Directives</b> for the airframe and engines. A replenishment of the crew oxygen system was performed on 7 March 2014, a routine maintenance task; an examination of this procedure found nothing unusual.|$|R

50|$|It {{is thought}} the vapors ignited due to damaged wiring, as no bomb, {{incendiary}} device or detonator {{had been found}} at the scene. The airline had fitted logo lights after delivery which required passing additional wires through the vapor seals in the fuel tanks.

The FAA declined to issue the <b>Airworthiness</b> <b>Directive.</b>|$|R
50|$|An {{emergency}} <b>airworthiness</b> <b>directive</b> (EAD) is an <b>airworthiness</b> <b>directive</b> issued when an {{unsafe condition}} exists that requires immediate action by an aircraft owner or operator. EADs are published by a responsible authorities such as FOCA, EASA or FAA related to airworthiness {{and maintenance of}} aircraft and aircraft parts. It contains measures which must be accomplished and the related periods to preserve their airworthiness. Technical information is addressed to operators and maintenance organisations of affected aircraft only. EADs become effective upon receipt of notification.|$|R

50|$|The FAA {{issued an}} <b>Airworthiness</b> <b>Directive</b> (AD) on May 16, 2013, {{and sent it}} to owners and {{operators}} of General Electric GE90-110B1 and GE90-115B turbofan engines. This emergency AD was prompted by reports of two failures of transfer gearbox assemblies (TGBs) which resulted in in-flight shutdowns (IFSDs). Investigation revealed that the failures were caused by TGB radial gear cracking and separation. Further inspections found two additional radial gears with cracks. This condition, if not corrected, could result in additional IFSDs of one or more engines, loss of thrust control, and damage to the airplane. The <b>Airworthiness</b> <b>Directive</b> requires compliance by taking remedial measures within five days of receipt of the AD.|$|R

This emergency AD was sent previously to all known U.S. owners and operators of these airplanes. This AD requires replacing certain lithium-ion batteries installed as the main aircraft battery with either a Ni-Cad or a lead acid battery. This AD was prompted by a report of a battery fire that resulted after an energized ground power unit was connected {{to one of the}} affected airplanes equipped with a lithium-ion battery as the main aircraft battery.
