There are ways to 'raise the nap', most of which involve wire brushes such as raising cards. Originally, dried teasel pods were used and were still preferred for use on woollen cloth for a long time. Woollen fabrics, which must be damp when raising <b>the</b> <b>nap,</b> are then dried and stretched before <b>the</b> <b>nap</b> is trimmed or sheared.

40|$|Abstractâ€”This paper compares two of {{the leading}} {{techniques}} for session variability compensation {{in the context of}} support vector machine (SVM) speaker verification using Gaussian mixture model (GMM) mean supervectors: joint factor analysis (JFA) modelling and nuisance attribute projection (NAP). Motivation for this comparison comes from the distinctly different domains in which these techniques are employed â€” the probabilistic GMM domain versus the discriminative SVM kernel. A theoretical analysis is given comparing <b>the</b> JFA and <b>NAP</b> approaches to variability compensation. The role of speaker factors in the factor analysis model is also contrasted <b>against</b> <b>the</b> scatter difference <b>NAP</b> objective of retaining speaker information in the SVM kernel space. These methods for retaining speaker variation are found to provide improved verification performance over the removal of channel effects alone. Overall, experimental results on the NIST 2006 and 2008 SRE corpora demonstrate the effectiveness of both JFA and NAP techniques for reducing the effects of variability. However, the overheads associated with the implementation of JFA may make NAP a more attractive technique due to its simple yet effective approach to variability compensation.
