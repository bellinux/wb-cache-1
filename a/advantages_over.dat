In DotA, players {{on each side}} choose one of 112 heroes, each with different abilities and tactical <b>advantages</b> <b>over</b> other heroes. The scenario is highly team-oriented; {{it is difficult for}} one player to carry the team to victory alone. DotA allows up to ten players in a five-versus-five format.|$|E
50|$|Monsters come in five elements: water, fire, wind, light, and dark. In {{terms of}} attack, water monsters have an <b>advantage</b> <b>over</b> fire, fire has an <b>advantage</b> <b>over</b> wind, and wind has an <b>advantage</b> <b>over</b> water. Light and dark have <b>advantage</b> <b>over</b> each other, but deal regular {{damage to the}} other three types.

5|$|HDMI {{has a few}} <b>advantages</b> <b>over</b> DisplayPort, such as {{ability to}} carry Consumer Electronics Control (CEC) signals, and {{electrical}} compatibility with DVI (though practically limited to single-link DVI rates). Also, HDMI can sustain full bandwidth for up to 10 meters of cable length and there are certification programs to ensure this; DisplayPort cables, conversely, don't ensure full bandwidth beyond 3 meters.|$|E
5|$|Helium, {{mixed with}} a heavier gas such as xenon, is useful for thermoacoustic {{refrigeration}} due to the resulting high heat capacity ratio and low Prandtl number. The inertness of helium has environmental <b>advantages</b> <b>over</b> conventional refrigeration systems which contribute to ozone depletion or global warming.|$|E
5|$|Numerically {{controlled}} oscillators offer several <b>advantages</b> <b>over</b> {{other types}} of oscillators in terms of agility, accuracy, stability and reliability. NCOs are used in many communications systems including digital up/down converters used in 3G wireless and software radio systems, digital PLLs, radar systems, drivers for optical or acoustic transmissions, and multilevel FSK/PSK modulators/demodulators.|$|E

5|$|<b>Advantages</b> <b>over</b> {{conventional}} diesel equipment included increased availability, higher speed through curves, {{and decreased}} weight which caused less wear on the tracks. Impressed with their reliability, Amtrak purchased the trainsets and ordered another four trainsets, which entered service in 1975 on the Chicago–Milwaukee and Chicago–Detroit corridors. The purchase {{price for the}} six trainsets was $18 million. Amtrak contemplated ordering an additional 14 trainsets for the partially-electrified Northeast Corridor between Boston and New York City. Doing so would have required a significant rise in fares between the two cities, and the United States Department of Transportation blocked the proposal.|$|E
5|$|Antibody mimetics are organic {{compounds}} that, like antibodies, can specifically bind antigens. They are usually artificial peptides or proteins with a molar mass of about 3 to 20 kDa. Nucleic acids and small molecules are sometimes considered antibody mimetics, but not artificial antibodies, antibody fragments and fusion proteins are composed from these. Common <b>advantages</b> <b>over</b> antibodies are better solubility, tissue penetration, stability towards heat and enzymes, and comparatively low production costs. Antibody mimetics {{such as the}} Affimer and the DARPin have being developed and commercialised as research, diagnostic and therapeutic agents.|$|E
5|$|DAB {{has also}} been marketed as having two major <b>advantages</b> <b>over</b> {{analogue}} radio broadcasting in that using MPEG-1 Audio Layer II lossy audio compression technology and more recently DAB+ using High-Efficiency Advanced Audio Coding, parts of the audio spectrum that cannot be heard by humans are discarded, meaning less data needs to be sent over the air. This, as well as multiplexing technology, allows a number of channels to be broadcast together on one frequency as opposed to one channel for analogue radio broadcasts.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} Julio-Claudian period, many {{auxiliary}} regiments raised in frontier provinces were stationed {{in or near}} their home provinces, except during periods of major crises such as the Cantabrian Wars, when they were deployed temporarily in theatre. This carried the obvious risk if their own tribe or ethnic group rebelled against Rome (or attacked the Roman frontier from outside the Empire), auxiliary troops could be tempted to make common cause with them. The Romans would then be faced by an enemy that included units fully equipped and trained by themselves, thus losing their usual tactical <b>advantages</b> <b>over</b> tribal foes.|$|E
5|$|Having {{pushed back}} U.S. forces at both Osan and Pyongtaek, the North Korean 4th Infantry Division, {{supported}} by {{elements of the}} North Korean 105th Armored Division, continued their advance down the Osan–Chonan road, up to 12,000 men strong under division commander Lee Kwon Mu in two infantry regiments supported by dozens of tanks. They were well trained, well equipped, and had high morale following previous victories, giving them <b>advantages</b> <b>over</b> the poorly trained and inexperienced Americans.|$|E
5|$|Improvements in {{structural}} alignment methods {{constitute an}} active area of research, and new or modified methods are often proposed that are claimed to offer <b>advantages</b> <b>over</b> the {{older and more}} widely distributed techniques. A recent example, TM-align, uses a novel method for weighting its distance matrix, to which standard dynamic programming is then applied. The weighting is proposed to accelerate the convergence of dynamic programming and correct for effects arising from alignment lengths. In a benchmarking study, TM-align {{has been reported to}} improve in both speed and accuracy over DALI and CE.|$|E

5|$|Molybdenum {{disulfide}} (MoS2) {{is used as}} a {{solid lubricant}} and a high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) antiwear agent. It forms strong films on metallic surfaces and is a common additive to HPHT greases — {{in the event of a}} catastrophic grease failure, a thin layer of molybdenum prevents contact of the lubricated parts. It also has semiconducting properties with distinct <b>advantages</b> <b>over</b> traditional silicon or graphene in electronics applications. MoS2 is also used as a catalyst in hydrocracking of petroleum fractions containing nitrogen, sulfur and oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Semiconductor {{detectors}} made {{of single}} crystal high-purity germanium can precisely identify radiation sources—for example in airport security. Germanium {{is useful for}} monochromators for beamlines used in single crystal neutron scattering and synchrotron X-ray diffraction. The reflectivity has <b>advantages</b> <b>over</b> silicon in neutron and high energy X-ray applications. Crystals of high purity germanium are used in detectors for gamma spectroscopy {{and the search for}} dark matter. Germanium crystals are also used in X-ray spectrometers for the determination of phosphorus, chlorine and sulfur.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} {{importance of}} pipeline transport – {{responsible for a}} high percentage of oil and natural gas transportation – is often undermined by the general public {{due to the lack of}} visibility of this mode. Generally held to be safer and more economical and reliable than the other modes of transport, this mode has many <b>advantages</b> <b>over</b> rival modes, such as trucks and railways. Examples of modern pipeline transport include Alashankou-Dushanzi Crude Oil Pipeline and Iran-Armenia Natural Gas Pipeline. International pipeline transport projects, like the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline, presently connect modern nation states– in this case, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey– through pipeline networks.|$|E

5|$|Windows RT was {{released}} to mixed reviews from various outlets and critics. Some felt that Windows RT devices had <b>advantages</b> <b>over</b> other mobile platforms (such as iOS or Android) {{because of its}} bundled software {{and the ability to}} use a wider variety of USB peripherals and accessories, but the platform was criticized for its poor software ecosystem, citing the early state of Windows Store and its incompatibility with existing Windows software, and other limitations over Windows 8.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} approach was {{the development of}} the ADS or armoured suit, which isolates the diver from the pressure at depth, at the cost of mechanical complexity and limited dexterity. The technology first became practicable in the middle 20th century. Isolation of the diver from the environment was taken further by the development of remotely operated underwater vehicles in the late 20th century, where the operator controls the ROV from the surface, and autonomous underwater vehicles, which dispense with an operator altogether. All of these modes are still in use and each has a range of applications where it has <b>advantages</b> <b>over</b> the others, though diving bells have largely been relegated to a means of transport for surface supplied divers. In some cases combinations are particularly effective, such as the simultaneous use of surface orientated or saturation surface supplied diving equipment and work or observation class remotely operated vehicles.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to finding weaponry {{out in the}} wastelands, the player can also create their own. To craft such weapons, the player must use a workbench, possess either the necessary schematics or the right Perk, and scavenge for the items needed to make them. These weapons usually possess significant <b>advantages</b> <b>over</b> other weapons of their type. Each weapon's schematic has three copies that can be found, and possessing additional copies improves the condition (or number) of items produced at the workbench, while a higher repair skill {{will result in a}} better starting condition for the related weapon. Weapon schematics can be found lying in certain locations, bought from vendors, or received as quest rewards.|$|E
