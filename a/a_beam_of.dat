5|$|The Stern–Gerlach {{experiment}} of 1922 provided {{further evidence}} of the quantum nature of the atom. When <b>a</b> <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> silver atoms was passed through a specially shaped magnetic field, the beam was split based on the direction of an atom's angular momentum, or spin. As this direction is random, the beam could be expected to spread into a line. Instead, the beam was split into two parts, depending on whether the atomic spin was oriented up or down.|$|E

5|$|X-ray {{crystallography}} is {{a technique}} used for determining the atomic and molecular structure of a crystal, in which the crystalline atoms cause <b>a</b> <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> incident X-rays to diffract into many specific directions. By measuring the angles and intensities of these diffracted beams, a crystallographer can produce a three-dimensional picture of the density of electrons within the crystal. From this electron density, the mean positions of the atoms in the crystal can be determined, {{as well as their}} chemical bonds, their disorder, and various other information.|$|E
5|$|A {{new method}} to study lipid bilayers is Atomic force {{microscopy}} (AFM). Rather than using <b>a</b> <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> light or particles, {{a very small}} sharpened tip scans the surface by making physical contact with the bilayer and moving across it, like a record player needle. AFM is a promising technique because {{it has the potential}} to image with nanometer resolution at room temperature and even under water or physiological buffer, conditions necessary for natural bilayer behavior. Utilizing this capability, AFM has been used to examine dynamic bilayer behavior including the formation of transmembrane pores (holes) and phase transitions in supported bilayers. Another advantage is that AFM does not require fluorescent or isotopic labeling of the lipids, since the probe tip interacts mechanically with the bilayer surface. Because of this, the same scan can image both lipids and associated proteins, sometimes even with single-molecule resolution. AFM can also probe the mechanical nature of lipid bilayers.|$|E
5|$|Adjuvant {{radiotherapy}} {{is commonly}} used in early-stage (stage I or II) endometrial cancer. It can be delivered through vaginal brachytherapy (VBT), which is becoming the preferred route due to its reduced toxicity, or external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). Brachytherapy involves placing a radiation source in the organ affected; {{in the case of}} endometrial cancer a radiation source is placed directly in the vagina. External beam radiotherapy involves <b>a</b> <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> radiation aimed at the affected area from outside the body. VBT is used to treat any remaining cancer solely in the vagina, whereas EBRT can be used to treat remaining cancer elsewhere in the pelvis following surgery. However, the benefits of adjuvant radiotherapy are controversial. Though EBRT significantly reduces the rate of relapse in the pelvis, overall survival and metastasis rates are not improved. VBT provides a better quality of life than EBRT.|$|E

5|$|Pink Floyd {{recorded}} The Dark Side of the Moon between May 1972 and January 1973, with EMI staff engineer Alan Parsons at Abbey Road. The {{title is}} {{an allusion to}} lunacy rather than astronomy. The band had composed and refined the material on Dark Side while touring the UK, Japan, North America and Europe. Producer Chris Thomas assisted Parsons. Hipgnosis designed the album's packaging, which included George Hardie's iconic refracting prism design on the cover. Thorgerson's Dark Side album cover features <b>a</b> <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> white light, representing unity, passing through a prism, which represents society. The resulting refracted beam of coloured light symbolises unity diffracted, leaving an absence of unity. Waters is the sole author of the album's lyrics.|$|E
