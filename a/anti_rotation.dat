40|$|AbstractThe bacteriophytochrome Agp 1 was reconstituted with {{a locked}} 5 Zs-biliverdin {{in which the}} C 4 C 5 and C 5 –C 6 bonds of the methine bridge between rings A and B are fixed in the Z and syn configuration/conformation, respectively. In Agp 1 - 5 Zs the photoconversion {{proceeds}} via the Lumi-R intermediate to Meta-RA, but the following millisecond-transition to Meta-RC is blocked. Consistently, no transient proton release was detected. The photoconversion of Agp 1 - 5 Zs is apparently arrested in a Meta-RA-like intermediate, since the subsequent syn to <b>anti</b> <b>rotation</b> around the C 5 –C 6 bond is prevented by the lock. The Meta-RA-like photoproduct was characterized by its distinctive CD spectrum suggesting a reorientation of ring D...|$|E
40|$|We have {{conducted}} VLBA phase-referencing monitoring of H 2 O masers around the red supergiant, S Persei, for six years. We have fitted maser motions {{to a simple}} expanding-shell model with a common annual parallax and stellar proper motion, and obtained the annual parallax as 0. 413 +/- 0. 017 mas, and the stellar proper motion as (- 0. 49 +/- 0. 23 mas/yr, - 1. 19 +/- 0. 20 mas/yr) in right ascension and declination, respectively. The obtained annual parallax corresponds to the trigonometric distance of 2. 42 + 0. 11 - 0. 09 kpc. Assuming the Galactocentric distance of the Sun of 8. 5 kpc, the circular rotational velocity of the LSR at {{the distance of the}} Sun of 220 km/s, and a flat Galactic rotation curve, S Persei is suggested to have a non-circular motion deviating from the Galactic circular rotation for 15 km/s, which is mainly dominated by the <b>anti</b> <b>rotation</b> direction component of 12. 9 +/- 2. 9 km/s. This red supergiant is thought to belong to the OB association, Per OB 1, so that this non-circular motion is representative of a motion of the OB association in the Milky Way. This non-circular motion is somewhat larger than that explained by the standard density-wave theory for a spiral galaxy, and is attributed to either a cluster shuffling of the OB association, or to non-linear interactions between non-stationary spiral arms and multi-phase interstellar media. The latter comes from a new view of a spiral arm formation in the Milky Way suggested by recent large N-body/smoothed particle hydrodynamics numerical simulations.

40|$|The {{response}} to heating of an organophilic ZSM- 5 sample after sulfamethoxazole (SMX) antibiotic adsorption [1] was investigated by in situ synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction {{in order to}} monitor the structural modifications induced by the regeneration treatment. This kind of information is crucial to design and optimize the regeneration treatment of zeolites with a very high potential for application in water remediation technologies. The evolution of the structural features was followed both in temperature ramp (25 - 575 °C, heating rate 10 °C/min) and in isotherm mode (120 minutes at 575 °C) by 45 full profile Rietveld refinements (s. g. P 212121). Our results show that temperature-induced transformations can be schematized into three main steps. In the 25 - 250 °C temperature range, the unit cell parameters (figure 1) slightly increase with increasing temperature. This process {{is accompanied by a}} regularization of the 10 -ring channel apertures which become more homogeneous (figure 2). Between 250 and 575 °C, the evident slope change in the unit-cell volume indicates the SMX degradation and expulsion according to TG analyses [1]. The structural deformation mechanism observed was a cooperative <b>anti</b> <b>rotation</b> of the tetrahedra belonging to both sinusoidal and straight 10 -ring channels as indicated by the changes in channel’s ellipticity (figure 2). The sequence of powder diffraction patterns refined using the Rietveld method during the isotherm show that the unit-cell parameters and the ellipticity maintains substantially unchanged. These results indicate that at 575 °C regeneration is completed and that the flexible ZSM- 5 framework is very similar to the as synthesized material [2]. REFERENCES [1] S. Blasioli, C. T.

40|$|The lifetimes for {{the high}} spin levels of the yrast band of $^{ 110 }$Cd has been measured. The {{estimated}} B(E 2) values decrease with increase in angular momentum.

40|$|As {{a direct}} {{simulation}} of a multistep proton transfer reaction involving protein residues, the proton relay shuttle between A and I forms of {{green fluorescent protein}} (GFP) is simulated in atomic detail by using a special molecular dynamics simulation technique. Electronic excitation of neutral chromophore in wild-type GFP is generally followed by excited-state proton transfer to a nearby glutamic acid residue via a water molecule and a serine residue. Here we show that {{the second and third}} transfer steps occur ultrafast on time scales of several tens of femtoseconds. Proton back-shuttle in the ground state is slower and occurs in a different sequence of events. The simulations provide atomic models of various intermediates and yield realistic rate constants for proton transfer events. In particular, we argue that the I form observed spectroscopically under equilibrium conditions may differ from the I form observed as a fast intermediate by an <b>anti</b> to syn <b>rotation</b> of the carboxyl proton of neutral Glu- 222...|$|R
