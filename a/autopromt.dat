50|$|Beginning in 1956 MIT had a {{contract}} for a new program in numerical control, this time emphasizing automatic programming for three-dimensional parts to be produced by 3- and 5-axis machine tools. Ross stated his work with radar vector handling led naturally to his defining tool paths as space curves rather than points in APT II. And allowed him to conceptualize their realization in a machine tools rectilinear framework. The Servo Lab would receive Air Force sponsorship for numerical control hardware, software, and adaptive control, followed by computer-aided design, computer graphics hardware and software, and software engineering and software technology, from 1951. This would continue for almost 20 years. In 1957 the last of Ross's original three research assistants, Sam Matsa, left for IBM to develop <b>AUTOPROMT,</b> a three-dimensional APT derivative and later (1963-64) co-found, with Andy Van Dam the ACM SICGRAPH.|$|E
