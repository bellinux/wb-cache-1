40|$|The authors {{consider}} <b>a</b> <b>compound</b> Cox <b>model</b> <b>of</b> {{insurance risk}} {{with the additional}} economic assumption of a positive interest rate. As the authors note a duality result relating <b>a</b> <b>compound</b> Cox <b>model</b> <b>of</b> insurance risk with a positive interest rate and a double shot noise process, the authors analyze a double shot noise process systematically for its theoretical distributional properties, based on the piecewise deterministic Markov process theory, and the martingale methodology. The authors also obtain the moments of aggregate accumulated/discounted claims where the claim arrival process follows a Cox process with shot noise intensity. Removing the parameters in a double shot noise process gradually, the authors show that it becomes <b>a</b> <b>compound</b> Cox process with shot noise intensity, a single shot noise process and <b>a</b> <b>compound</b> Poisson process. Numerical comparisons are shown between the moments (i. e. means and variances) <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>compound</b> Poisson <b>model</b> and their counterparts <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>compound</b> Cox <b>model</b> with/without considering a positive interest rate.

40|$|Abstract. We {{propose a}} method for human {{full-body}} pose tracking from measurements of wearable inertial sensors. Since the data provided by such sensors is sparse, noisy and often ambiguous, we use <b>a</b> <b>compound</b> prior <b>model</b> <b>of</b> feasible human poses to constrain the tracking problem. Our <b>model</b> consists <b>of</b> several low-dimensional, activity-specific motion models and an efficient, sampling-based activity switching mechanism. We restrict the search space for pose tracking by means of manifold learning. Together with the portability of wearable sensors, our method allows us to track human full-body motion in unconstrained environments. In fact, {{we are able to}} simultaneously classify the activity a person is performing and estimate the full-body pose. Experiments on movement sequences containing different activities show that our method can seamlessly detect activity switches and precisely reconstruct full-body pose from the data of only six wearable inertial sensors...|$|R

40|$|Venting {{is one of}} {{the most}} used in situ {{remediation}} methods for unsaturated soils contaiminated with volatile organic compounds (VOC). The development <b>of</b> mathematical <b>models</b> and their validation by means of experimental results allowed the identification of the main parameters which influence the soil depollution process. The influence of temperature on the venting depollution process of soils polluted with volatile organic compounds was studied in this investigation. It was found that the depollution efficiency is strongly influenced by the vapour pressuree of the pollutants. The conclusions, derived from the performed experimental determinations allowed characterization of the depollution process by using an "equilibrium" model. This model considers the existence of equilibrium between the four pollution phases (vapour, aqueous, "solid" and non-aqueous phase organic liquids) at any moment in time. In order to calculate the vapour pressure, a modified equation <b>of</b> the Antoine <b>model</b> was used in the <b>model.</b> Application <b>of</b> the mathematical <b>model</b> indicates that a 10 °C temperature rise leads to a two-fold increase in the vapor pressure <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>compound.</b> Comparison <b>of</b> the <b>modeled</b> and experimental curves, as well as the values of the obtained performance critterions, verified that the chosen mathematical model describes the influence of temperature on the depollution process very well...|$|R

Hydrogenation and demetallation of the iron(II) -containing macrocyclic complexes results in the isolation of large organic macrocycles. The latter bind {Ru(bpy) (2) } units to give macrocyclic complexes with exocyclic ruthenium(II) -containing domains. The complex [Ru(bpy) (2) (L) ](2 +) (isolated as the hexafluorophosphate salt), in which L= 5, 5 '-bis[3 -(1, 4, 7, 10 -tetraoxatridec- 12 -enylphenyl) ]- 2, 2 '-bipyridine, undergoes intramolecular ring-closing metathesis to yield a macrocycle which retains the exocyclic {Ru(bpy) (2) } unit.

Here, we report the generation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>compound</b> <b>model</b> <b>of</b> prostate cancer to define the synergism of activated K-ras (K-ras+/V 12) and dominant stabilized β-catenin (Catnb+/lox(ex 3)) in the murine prostate. Recombination of floxed alleles and subsequent expression of oncogenic transgenes was mediated by Cre recombinase expression governed by the composite Probasin (PB) promoter (termed PBCre). Concomitant with elevated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, PBCre+K-ras+/V 12 mice developed AH at 100 days (100 % incidence) and low-grade prostate intraepithelial neoplasia and adenocarcinoma (60 % and 7 % incidence) by 500 days. PBCre+Catnb+/lox(ex 3) mice showed reduced longevity (average 428 days) and were predisposed to PIN-like keratinized squamous metaplasia at 100 days (100 % incidence) and adenocarcinoma (100 % incidence) at end-point. These lesions displayed elevated Wnt signaling and basal levels of MAPK signaling. Synchronous activation of K-ras and β-catenin significantly reduced survival (average 189 days), reflecting accelerated tumorigenesis {{and the development of}} invasive carcinoma that displayed activated Wnt and MAPK signaling. Notably, expression of the basal cell marker p 63 negatively correlated with tumor grade, resembling human prostate adenocarcinoma. Taken together, our data show that combinatorial oncogenic mutations of K-ras and β-catenin drive rapid progression of prostate tumorigenesis to invasive carcinoma, characterized by the synergistic elevation of androgen receptor, cyclooxygenase- 2, and c-Myc.

40|$|The {{hygroscopic}} {{growth of}} atmospheric particles affects atmospheric chemistry and Earth's climate. Water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) constitutes a significant {{fraction of the}} dry submicron mass of atmospheric aerosols, thus affecting their water uptake properties. Although the WSOC fraction is comprised <b>of</b> many <b>compounds,</b> <b>a</b> set <b>of</b> <b>model</b> substances {{can be used to}} describe its behavior. For this study, mixtures of Nordic Aquatic fulvic acid reference (NAFA) and Fluka humic acid (HA), with various combinations of inorganic salts (sodium chloride and ammonium sulfate) and other representative organic compounds (levoglucosan and succinic acid), were studied. We measured the equilibrium water vapor pressure over bulk solutions of these mixtures as a function of temperature and solute concentration. New water activity (aw) parameterizations and hygroscopic growth curves at 25 °C were calculated from these data for particles of equivalent composition. We examined the effect of temperature on the water activity and found a maximum variation of 9 % in the 0 – 30 °C range, and 2 % in the 20 – 30 °C range. Five two-component mixtures were studied to understand the effect of adding a humic substance (HS), such as NAFA and HA, to an inorganic salt or a saccharide. The deliquescence point at 25 °C for HS-inorganic mixtures did not change significantly from that of the pure inorganic species. However, the hygroscopic growth of HA-inorganic mixtures was lower than that exhibited by the pure salt, in proportion to the added mass of HA. The addition of NAFA to a highly soluble solute (ammonium sulfate, sodium chloride or levoglucosan) in water had the same effect as the addition of HA to the inorganic species for most of the aw range studied. Yet, the water uptake of these NAFA mixtures transitioned to match the growth of the pure salt or saccharide at high aw values. The remaining four mixtures were based on chemical composition data for different aerosol types. As expected, the two solutions representing organic aerosols (40 % HS/ 40 % succinic acid/ 20 % levoglucosan) showed lower water uptake than the two solutions representing biomass burning aerosols (25 % HS/ 27 % succinic acid/ 18 % levoglucosan/ 30 % ammonium sulfate). However, interactions in multicomponent solutions may be responsible for the differences that arise in relative hygroscopic growth above RH of 95 % when comparing three different HS in these two mixtures. The ZSR model was able to predict reasonably well the hygroscopic growth of all the mixtures below aw = 0. 95, but produced large deviations for some multicomponent mixtures at higher values...|$|R
