40|$|The various {{tests for}} <b>anti-double-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>antibodies</b> {{do not always}} agree. Plasma {{fibronectin}} specifically binds DNA, is a component of immune complexes, and shows variations in concentration with disease activity in systemic lupus erythematosus. It may therefore interfere with the detection of DNA autoantibodies. This possibility was examined {{in a series of}} studies using the Crithidia luciliae test. Studies were based on serum samples received during one year (250 samples). Serum samples from 50 patients which were positive or weakly positive in the C luciliae test were used. In blocking experiments fibronectin was added either to the wells or to the serum. In a second series of experiments fibronectin was depleted by affinity chromatography from six serum samples with weak anti-DNA staining. Preincubation of wells with fibronectin or addition of fibronectin to serum invariably blocked the interaction of anti-DNA antibodies with the C luciliae kinetoplast. When fibronectin was removed from serum the intensity of staining was increased. These results indicate that fibronectin influences the detection of <b>anti-double-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>antibodies</b> using C luciliae and may explain the disparity between the results of different tests for <b>DNA</b> <b>antibodies.</b> Furthermore, the unmasking of positive reactivity when fibronectin is removed from serum has implications for the diagnosis and treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus...|$|R

A slight defense was observed during physical examination, but no sign of rebound was detected. Her rectal examination and bowel sounds were within the normal limits. In her de-tailed history, she described systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) anamnesis managed with a maintenance therapy of low-dose corticosteroids. Complete blood count, laboratory test, and stool sample analysis were within the normal limits, except for mildly decreased albumin levels (3. 61 g/dL), increased C-reactive pro-tein levels (18. 4 mg/L), and elevated <b>anti-double-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>antibody</b> levels.

However, involvement of HO- 1 in the development of autoimmune renal diseases remains uncertain. To assess the clinical efficacy of HO- 1 induction therapy for lupus glomerulonephritis, MRL/lpr mice were intraperitoneally injected with 100 µmol/kg hemin, a potent HO- 1 inducer, or PBS as controls, once a week from 6 weeks of age to 21 – 24 weeks-old. We found that treatment with hemin led to a significant reduction of proteinuria and remarkable amelioration of glomerular lesions accompanied by decreased immune depositions. In addition, the circulating IgG <b>anti-double-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>antibody</b> level was significantly decreased in hemin treated mice when compared with controls. A single intraperitoneal injection with hemin resulted in reduction of inducible nitric oxide synthase expression in the kidney and spleen, and serum interferon-γ level.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the effect of long-term infliximab treatment on various autoantibodies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Serum samples from 30 consecutive patients, who were prospectively followed during infliximab and methotrexate therapy for refractory rheumatoid arthritis, were tested at baseline and after 30, 54 and 78 weeks. At these points, median values of the Disease Activity Score were 6. 38 (interquartile range 5. 30 – 6. 75), 3. 69 (2. 67 – 4. 62), 2. 9 (2. 39 – 4. 65) and 3. 71 (2. 62 – 5. 06), respectively. Various autoantibodies were assessed by standard indirect immunofluorescence and/or ELISA. Initially, 50 % of patients were positive for antinuclear antibodies, and this figure increased to 80 % after 78 weeks (P = 0. 029). A less marked, similar increase was found for IgG and IgM anticardiolipin antibody titre, whereas the frequency of <b>anti-double-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>antibodies</b> (by ELISA) exhibited a transient rise (up to 16. 7 %) at 54 weeks and dropped to 0 % at 78 weeks. Antibodies to proteinase- 3 and myeloperoxidase were not detected. The proportion of patients who were positive for rheumatoid factor (RF) was similar at baseline and at 78 weeks (87 % and 80 %, respectively). However, the median RF titre exhibited a progressive reduction from 128 IU/ml (interquartile range 47 – 290 IU/ml) to 53 IU/ml (18 – 106 IU/ml). Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibodies were found in 83 % of patients before therapy; anti-CCP antibody titre significantly decreased at 30 weeks but returned to baseline thereafter. In conclusion, the presence of <b>anti-double-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>antibodies</b> is a transient phenomenon, despite a stable increase in antinuclear and anticardiolipin antibodies. Also, the evolution of RF titres and that of anti-CCP antibody titres differed during long-term infliximab therapy...|$|R

We report a 16 -year-old female who developed bilateral visual impairment. Fundus examinations showed bilateral “cherry-red spot” appearance, multiple confluent cotton wool spots, and widespread arterial occlusion. Laboratory studies showed leukopenia, antinuclear antibody (+), and <b>anti-double-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>antibody</b> (+). Malar rashes, oral ulcers, and bilateral knee joint tenderness were noted during physical examination. SLE was diagnosed and pulse therapy started immediately. Best corrected visual acuity of the left eye improved to 6 / 10 after treatment. However, there was no visual improvement in the right eye. Four months later, bilateral panretinal laser photocoagulation was performed due to retinal neovascularization. However, tractional retinal detachment of the right eye and vitreous hemorrhage of the left eye still occurred. After undergoing cryoretinopexy of the right eye and intravitreous tissue plasminogen activator injection of the left eye, the visual acuity of the patient's right eye remained hand movement only at 10 cm, but that of the left eye returned to 6 / 10.

Purpose: To assess the prevalence, clinical patterns, and short outcomes of autoantibodies and Sjögren’s syndrome (SS) involvement in Chinese ON patients and evaluate the relationship between ON, including their subtypes, and autoantibodies. Methods: A total of 190 ON patients were divided into recurrent ON (RON), bilateral ON (BON), and isolated monocular ON (ION). Demographic, clinical, and serum autoantibodies data were compared between them with and without SS involvement. Serum was drawn for antinuclear antibody (ANA), extractable nuclear antigen antibodies (SSA/SSB), rheumatoid factor (RF), anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA), and <b>anti-double-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>antibody</b> (A-ds DNA), anticardiolipin antibody (ACLs), anti-b 2 -glycoprotein I (b 2 -GPI) and Aquaporin- 4 antibodies (AQP 4 -Ab).

Methods: For further investigation of this subgroup, we retrospectively reviewed and analyzed 19 SLE patients with disease onset at age 60 {{years or older}} (Group A) collected from 1998 to 2008 in the computerized database of outpatients and inpatients of our hospital. For comparison, 50 SLE patients with disease onset between 15 and 40 years (Group B) were also selected using a simple random sampling method {{during the same period}} from the same database. Results: When compared with Group B, Group A had: (1) a decreased ratio of female to male; (2) a longer lag time from disease onset to diagnosis; (3) higher rates of renal insufficiency and mortality; and (4) lower immunologic disorder rates, including <b>anti-double-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>antibody,</b> anti-ribonucleoprotein antibody and hypocomplementemia. The main cause of death in both groups was septic shock. Conclusion: The clinical and laboratory features were found to be different between Groups A and B.

For comparison, 50 SLE patients with disease onset between 15 and 40 years (Group B) were also selected using a simple random sampling method {{during the same period}} from the same database. ResultsWhen compared with Group B, Group A had: (1) a decreased ratio of female to male; (2) a longer lag time from disease onset to diagnosis; (3) higher rates of renal insufficiency and mortality; and (4) lower immunologic disorder rates, including <b>anti-double-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>antibody,</b> anti-ribonucleoprotein antibody and hypocomplementemia. The main cause of death in both groups was septic shock. ConclusionThe clinical and laboratory features were found to be different between Groups A and B. Late onset SLE patients had a more insidious onset, a longer lag time from disease onset to diagnosis and, therefore, a higher mortality rate. Thus, this particular subgroup of SLE patients should be afforded greater attention to avoid delays in diagnosis or misdiagnosis...|$|E
40|$|Inflammation {{has been}} {{closely linked to}} auto-immunogenic {{processes}} in atherosclerosis. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are specialized to produce type-I interferons in response to pathogenic single-stranded nucleic acids, but can also sense self-DNA released from dying cells or in neutrophil extracellular traps complexed to the antimicrobial peptide Cramp/LL 37 in autoimmune disease. However, the exact role of pDCs in atherosclerosis remains elusive. Here we demonstrate that pDCs can be detected in murine and human atherosclerotic lesions. Exposure to oxidatively modified low-density lipoprotein enhanced the capacity of pDCs to phagocytose and prime antigen-specific T cell responses. Plasmacytoid DCs can be stimulated to produce interferon-α by Cramp/DNA complexes, and we further identified increased expression of Cramp and formation of neutrophil extracellular traps in atherosclerotic arteries. Whereas Cramp/DNA complexes aggravated atherosclerotic lesion formation in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice, pDC depletion and Cramp-deficiency in bone marrow reduced atherosclerosis and <b>anti-double-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>antibody</b> titers. Moreover, the specific activation of pDCs and interferon-α treatment promoted plaque growth, associated with enhanced anti-double-stranded-DNA antibody titers. Accordingly, anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies were elevated in patients with symptomatic versus asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis. Self-DNA (eg, released from dying cells or in neutrophil extracellular traps) and an increased expression of the antimicrobial peptide Cramp/LL 37 in atherosclerotic lesions may thus stimulate a pDC-driven pathway of autoimmune activation and the generation of anti-double-stranded-DNA antibodies, critically aggravating atherosclerosis lesion formation. These key factors may thus represent novel therapeutic target...|$|E
40|$|Despite its rarity, infliximab-related {{hepatitis}} {{constitutes a}} cutting edge and challenging problem. In December 2004, a drug warning was issued by the Food and Drug Administration to alert healthcare professionals {{to the risk of}} hepatotoxicity in course of infliximab therapy. Subsequently, several reports of probable infliximab hepatitis have been published and interest is growing in trying to elucidate the impact of these events on clinical practice. After discussing our case report, the main characteristics of infliximab-mediated liver injury are analyzed, coupled with a review of the medical literature. Infliximab seems to provoke both immunomediated and a direct liver injury, but how this latter happens remains unclear. Moreover, infliximab immunomediated liver dysfunction resembles that of autoimmune hepatitis type I, with elevation of antinuclear, anti-smooth muscle, <b>anti-double-strand</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>antibodies,</b> and a clear preference for female sex. Finally, a flow chart is proposed with the purpose to help clinicians in the management of patients who develop signs of liver dysfunction during treatment with infliximab...|$|R
40|$|Nuclear factor erythroid 2 -related factor 2 (Nrf 2) is an antioxidant-activated cap “n” collar basic {{leucine zipper}} {{transcription}} factor. To assess {{the function of}} Nrf 2 in the antioxidant response, we examined mice with targeted disruption of the Nrf 2 gene. Nrf 2 -null mice developed complex disease manifestations, with a majority exhibiting a lupus-like autoimmune syndrome characterized by multiorgan inflammatory lesions with a marked female predominance, appearance of <b>anti-double-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>antibodies</b> in young adulthood, intravascular deposition of immunoglobulin complexes in blood vessels, and premature death due to rapidly progressing membranoproliferative glomerular nephritis. Mechanistic analyses revealed that the null mice showed enhanced proliferative response of CD 4 + T cells, altered ratios of CD 4 + and CD 8 + cells, and increased oxidative lesions in tissues. Analyses of antioxidant-induced gene expression showed that the knockout mice were devoid of the basal and inducible expression of certain phase 2 detoxification enzymes and antioxidant genes in hepatic and lymphoid cells in vivo. Our findings suggest that Nrf 2 mediates important antioxidant functions involved in the control of peripheral lymphocyte homeostasis and autoimmune surveillance...|$|R

Not only is nephritis a common complaint in systemic lupus erythematosus, {{but it is also}} the most life-threatening complication of the disease. <b>Anti-double-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>antibodies</b> (Abs), which are found in up to 80 % of these patients, might be nephritogenic per se. That is, they may cross-react with mesangial cell (MC) surface proteins, such as alpha-actinin and annexin A 2, they may cross-react with mesangial matrix protein such as laminine and fibronectin, or they may recognize chromatin material previously deposited in the glomeruli. The consequence of the binding of anti-MC Abs may be their internalization, which results in activation and proliferation of these MCs. In turn, these activated MCs are suspected of promoting immune complex formation by sequestering and thereby protecting chromatin from degradation. The present paper will explain the mechanisms through which such autoAbs may initiate nephritis. 1...|$|R
