Alexander became the Geologist to the Government of Singapore in 1949, responsible for surveying the island and went on to publish a report in 1950 which included the first geological map of Singapore.|$|E
5|$|Later in 711, al-Hajjaj ordered Qutayba {{to march}} against the Hephthalite kingdom of Zabulistan, whose ruler, titled Zunbil, had long {{remained}} an indomitable {{thorn in the}} Arabs' side and menaced their province of Sistan. Repeated expeditions against him had failed, and a truce had been agreed in exchange for tribute. In addition, {{the existence of a}} free Zabulite kingdom was a threat to the security of Muslim control over the Hephthalite principalities of Tokharistan, who might be encouraged to seek support from it. Thus Qutayba led a large army south, but the Zunbil readily offered his submission and the payment of tribute. Satisfied with this easy success, and unwilling to hazard a campaign in the mountains of Zabulistan, Qutayba departed. No garrisons were installed, <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Arab army had departed, the Zunbil ceased the payment of tribute. Qutayba's victories, parallel with the conquests of Muhammad ibn Qasim in northwestern India, awoke such enthusiasm and hopes among the Muslims that al-Hajjaj is reputed to have offered the governorship of China to whomever of the two first reached it.|$|E
5|$|The {{first six}} {{production}} aircraft were {{delivered to the}} 6th Fighter Regiment of the VVKJ, based at Zemun, in early 1939. The pilots subjected them to considerable additional testing, before they entered normal service around mid-year. The remaining six entered service during the remainder of 1939. The aircraft were delivered without radios or armament, which were fitted in VVKJ workshops. In October 1939, the IK-2s were transferred to the 4th Fighter Regiment in Zagreb until licence-built Hawker Hurricanes were delivered from Zemun, after which the IK-2s were {{to be transferred to}} the 5th Fighter Regiment in Niš. By the end of 1940, all the production IK-2s were concentrated in the 107th Fighter Squadron of the 34th Fighter Group, which consisted solely of IK-2s. This was only an interim allocation, as the other squadron of the group was equipped with Hurricanes, <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> 107th Fighter Squadron could be equipped with Hurricanes, the IK-2s were to move to the 5th Fighter Regiment. The threat of war overtook this planned deployment, and on 13 March 1941, the IK-2s of the 107th Fighter Squadron were moved to Bosanski Aleksandrovac near Banja Luka, under the command of Kapetan Zarko Vukajlović.|$|E

25|$|Hugh Neilson was a keen {{player of}} the {{bagpipes}} and the music could be heard at many of the surrounding farms, drifting up from the estate gardens. He was also very fond of curling <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> weather was cold enough he would invite all the locals down for a match and a dram at his curling pond (Hastings 1995).

25|$|Unfortunately {{the whole}} plot leaked out locally owing to a native traitor and, internationally, through the Czech revolutionaries {{who were in}} touch with their {{counterparts}} in the U.S.A., <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> information reached the British authorities, they alerted the police, particularly in the delta region of the Ganges, and sealed all the sea approaches on the eastern coast from Noakhali-Chittagong side to Orissa. Sramajibi Samabaya and Harry & Sons of Calcutta, the two business concerns run respectively by Amarendra Chatterjee and Harikumar Chakrabarti which were taking active part in the Indo-German Conspiracy were searched.|$|E

The Spanish ship was the Santa Maria de San Vicente the flagship of the Santo Domingo squadron of the Spanish Flota, captained by Alonzo de Cornieles. At near 400 tons Santa Maria de San Vicente was a richly laden galleon having sailed from Havana with nearly 300 crew, soldiers and passengers. She {{was struggling to}} catch up with the main convoy of thirty ships much farther ahead, having been forced to heave-to by gale-force winds.|$|E
25|$|The last German {{offensive}} on the Western front, the Battle of the Bulge (Operation Wacht am Rhein), was {{an offensive}} launched towards {{the port of}} Antwerp in December 1944. Launched in poor weather against a thinly held Allied sector, it achieved surprise and initial success as Allied air power was grounded by cloud cover. Determined defence by US troops in places throughout the Ardennes, the lack of good roads and German supply shortages caused delays. Allied forces deployed to the flanks of the German penetration <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> skies cleared, Allied aircraft returned to the battlefield. Allied counter-attacks soon forced back the Germans, who abandoned much equipment for lack of fuel.|$|E
25|$|By the {{following}} morning the city of Carrara was surrounded by soldiers {{under the command of}} General Nicola Heusch. A state of siege had been proclaimed by the Crispi government on January 16, 1894. Among those threatened with arrest were many quarry workers, who responded by declaring a general strike. Instead of going to work, they came down from the mountains and gathered around the military barracks where hundreds of prisoners had already been detained. Troops were then ordered to amass <b>and,</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> crowd came near enough, they fired. Eleven deaths resulted, as well as numerous other casualties. (Other sources mention 8 people killed and 13 wounded). Armed bands dispersed into the mountains pursued by troops.|$|E

Searching for Standard Gravure's President, Michael Shea, and other supervisors and managers of the plant, Wesbecker calmly walked through the hallways, deliberately shooting at people. He killed James Husband and injured Forrest Conrad, Paula Warman and John Stein, a bindery supervisor whom he shot in the head and abdomen. Wesbecker then headed {{down the stairs to the}} pressroom, where he killed Paul Sallee and wounded Stanley Hatfield and David Sadenfaden, two electricians from Marine Electric who were working on a broken machine.|$|E
25|$|The {{prudence}} in assembling {{troops in}} the support line was justified, because some shells from the creeping barrage dropped short and caused many casualties as the New Zealanders moved into the open, especially in the left company of the 1st Otago Battalion. The German infantry and machine-gunners were not under cover, despite the regular heavy artillery bombardments before midday <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> New Zealand artillery opened fire, the German machine-gunners replied from the pillboxes near the château and from Gheluvelt Ridge. German artillery bombarded the duck-board track near Veldhoek but the narrowness of no man's land, which had limited the IX Corps heavy bombardment, also prevented the Germans from bombarding the New Zealand assembly positions. The first New Zealand wave pressed on into a wilderness of tree stumps, where the German wire {{was found to be}} well cut.|$|E
25|$|The {{treaty was}} {{presented}} as proof of Soviet respect to small nations and Stalin's benevolence by Soviet propaganda. Russians emphasized {{that it was the}} second time the Soviet Union gave Vilnius to Lithuania while the League of Nations failed to mediate Polish–Lithuanian dispute. Soviets also worked to assure Lithuanians that Soviet friendship is effective protection from and a welcome alternative to Nazi aggression. Polish government-in-exile officially protested the treaty as it did not recognize Russian conquest and claimed sovereignty over territories of the Second Polish Republic. Lithuanians replied that the region was legally part of Lithuania. Poles resented the transfer <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Army left Vilnius, anti-Lithuanian riots broke out accusing Lithuanians of betrayal. France and Great Britain, traditional allies of Poland, also condemned the treaty. Belarusian activists, who campaigned for Vilnius incorporation into the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, were arrested, deported, or executed by the Soviet authorities. The transfer upset their national aspirations to position Belarus as a successor to the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Lithuanian relations with Vatican were expected to improve as the cause for tension, Vilnius Region assigned to Poland by the Concordat of 1925, now was under Lithuanian control.|$|E

25|$|This {{prayer was}} responded {{to by the}} {{congregation}} present. A man was selected, preferably a priest, to take the goat to the precipice in the wilderness; and he was accompanied {{part of the way}} by the most eminent men of Jerusalem. Ten booths had been constructed at intervals along the road leading from Jerusalem to the steep mountain. At each one of these the man leading the goat was formally offered food and drink, which he, however, refused. When he reached the tenth booth those who accompanied him proceeded no further, but watched the ceremony from a distance. When he came to the precipice he divided the scarlet thread into two parts, one of which he tied to the rock and the other to the goat's horns, and then pushed the goat down (Yoma vi. 1–8). The cliff was so high and rugged that before the goat had traversed half the distance to the plain below, its limbs were utterly shattered. Men were stationed at intervals along the way, <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> goat was thrown down the precipice, they signaled to one another by means of kerchiefs or flags, until the information reached the high priest, whereat he proceeded with the other parts of the ritual.|$|E
25|$|On 5 July, the 339th Squadron {{was pulled}} out of combat and {{returned}} to Johnson AB. Shortly afterwards, the 4th Squadron returned to Okinawa, with the 347th Provisional Group being inactivated {{and control of the}} 68th Squadron being turned over to the 8th Fighter Group. The 339th had been in combat a total of 10 days (26 June–5 July), flying a total of 44 combat sorties for which they had been given no training. The 68th Squadron was left to carry on the battle. Throughout July and August 1950, F-82s from the 68th Squadron attacked enemy trains, vehicles, and numerous buildings, and constantly strafed North Korean troops on the roads. On the night of 27 August, an element of F-82s was patrolling over South Korea over a thick overcast when they received an urgent request for air support from some hard-pressed ground troops. Darkness was approaching when they reached the area and found UN ground troops pinned down by a concentration of mortars. The F-82 pilots made several passes to get set up with the ground controller, <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> enemy target was pinpointed, the heavily armed aircraft commenced an attack that would last 45 minutes and use up all their ordnance. When the aircraft pulled up for the last time, the mortar positions were silent and ground forces later showed over 300 enemy dead.|$|E
500|$|Animosity {{between the}} British and the Boers {{intensified}} {{in the run-up}} to the Second Boer War fought from 1899 to 1902, and continued thereafter. One British volunteer soldier sent home a letter explicitly detailing the British soldiers' hatred of their Boer enemy: [...] "The Cape Dutch and Boers are a dirty treacherous lot <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Transvaal is subdued and the beggars (those that survive) trek farther out of our way the better.

There were 2,435 cases of malaria in the AIF in 1941, a rate of 31.8 per thousand per year. Quinine was used as a prophylaxis. On Fairley's advice, patients with relapses were treated with intravenous quinine for three days followed by a course of atebrin and plasmoquine. For his services in the Middle East, Fairley was mentioned in despatches a second time, and made a Commander of the Military Division Order of the British Empire for his [...] "immense and specialised knowledge of tropical diseases in the Middle East".|$|E
500|$|American {{intelligence}} analysts had thought General Trần Văn Đôn {{was involved in}} the coup with Phát and Thảo, but altered their assessment when he stayed in the mountain resort town of Da Lat instead of heading for the capital. Their changed assessment was reinforced by the announcement that Khiêm would be leading the replacement government if the coup was successful. Eight months after the coup was over, Đôn told the American historian George McTurnan Kahin [...] that he had been plotting with Thảo, who had planned for him to become Defense Minister and Chief of Staff of the military, but said the Dai Viet and Kiem had insisted on installing the Catholic Khiêm. A month earlier, American {{intelligence analysts}} thought Thảo was planning to replace Khánh as commander-in-chief with Don. Ambassador Khiêm had been putting pressure on his bitter rival Khánh for over two months by charging him and the Buddhists of seeking a [...] "neutralist solution" [...] and [...] "negotiating with the communists", <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> coup broke, he was immediately deemed by media analysts as a key figure behind the action.|$|E
