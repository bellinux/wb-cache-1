5|$|Lundy has {{attracted}} many vagrant birds, in particular species from North America. The island's bird list totals 317 species. This has {{included the following}} species, each of which represents the sole British record: <b>Ancient</b> <b>murrelet,</b> eastern phoebe and eastern towhee. Records of bimaculated lark, American robin and common yellowthroat were also firsts for Britain (American robin has also occurred two further times on Lundy). Veerys in 1987 and 1997 were Britain's second and fourth records, a RÃ¼ppell's warbler in 1979 was Britain's second, an eastern Bonelli's warbler in 2004 was Britain's fourth, and a black-faced bunting in 2001 Britain's third.|$|E
5|$|The {{point at}} which chicks fledge varies dramatically. The chicks of the Synthliboramphus murrelets, like the <b>ancient</b> <b>murrelet,</b> leave the nest the night after they hatch, {{following}} their parents out to sea, where they are raised away from terrestrial predators. Some other species, such as ducks, move their chicks away from the nest at an early age. In most species, chicks leave the nest just before, or soon after, {{they are able to}} fly. The amount of parental care after fledging varies; albatross chicks leave the nest on their own and receive no further help, while other species continue some supplementary feeding after fledging. Chicks may also follow their parents during their first migration.|$|E
2500|$|No {{fewer than}} 287 {{species of birds}} have been {{recorded}} on the island. In spring (May through mid-June) and fall (August through October), many rare birds, including Siberian vagrants, may be spotted on the island.

50|$|<b>Ancient</b> <b>murrelets</b> tend to bank {{from side}} to side in flight {{to a greater extent than}} other small auks. They fly with fast wing beats due to their short wings.|$|R
50|$|Like other auks, <b>ancient</b> <b>murrelets</b> forage by {{swimming}} underwater {{using their}} wings for propulsion. Their diet is poorly known. In winter it consists mainly of crustacea, while in summer both small fish, and crustaceans are taken. Based on stable isotope analysis, their diet in Haida Gwaii seems to consist primarily of small mesopelagic fish.|$|R
50|$|In {{the spring}} and summer seabirds nest on the island, {{including}} crested, parakeet and rhinoceros auklet, common and thick-billed murre, black-legged kittiwake, <b>ancient</b> <b>murrelet,</b> and tufted puffin.|$|E

50|$|Koniuji Island {{provides}} nesting {{habitat for}} close to 300,000 seabirds. Around 70% are Fork-tailed Storm-petrels and 17% are Leach's Storm-petrel. There are also large numbers of the <b>Ancient</b> <b>Murrelet</b> and the Whiskered Auklet that nest on Koniuji. These four species breed on Koniuji Island in numbers that exceed 1% of their total global populations.|$|E
50|$|Semisopochnoi has no {{native land}} mammals. Arctic foxes were {{introduced}} to the island during the 19th century for fur farming and removed in 1997. Most ground-nesting bird species (Aleutian cackling goose, rock ptarmigan) and most burrow-nesting seabirds (storm-petrels, <b>ancient</b> <b>murrelets,</b> Cassin's auklets, tufted puffins) were extirpated by foxes; Semisopochnoi Island is currently {{in the early stages of}} recovery. The island has remained free of Norway rats.|$|R
40|$|Theory and {{observations}} suggest that offspring abandonment in animals may {{occur when the}} costs to future reproductive output of current reproductive effort outweigh the fitness benefits of rearing the current brood. While hormonal cues (i. e. corticosterone) or energy reserves {{are believed to be}} involved, few studies have directly focused on the proximate cues influencing behaviours directly related to reproductive success. To address this information gap, we determined the incubation metabolic rates and corticosterone (CORT) levels of naturally fasting and freely incubating <b>ancient</b> <b>murrelets</b> (Synthliboramphus antiquus). Respiratory quotient (RQ) increased with date, suggesting that incubating <b>ancient</b> <b>murrelets</b> shifted from strictly lipid-based metabolism towards more protein-based metabolism as incubation progressed. Birds that hatched only one nestling had higher levels of circulating CORT than those which hatched two, suggesting that birds which laid only a single egg found incubation more stressful than those which laid two. However, CORT levels and incubation shift lengths were not correlated, suggesting that birds that undertook prolonged incubation shifts did so only when their energy stores were not jeopardized...|$|R
50|$|Other <b>ancient</b> <b>murrelets</b> however fly {{south in}} winter {{as far as}} California, and odd birds are found inland in North America, carried by autumn storms. The most {{remarkable}} record of this relatively short-distance Pacific migrant was a bird found {{on the island of}} Lundy, in Devon, England in the spring of 1990. Even more remarkably, what was presumably the same bird returned to this British island for the next two springs as well.|$|R
50|$|An {{estimated}} 750,000 seabirds nest {{along the}} shoreline of Gwaii Haanas from May through August. Many are burrow-nesters, such as the rhinoceros auklet, <b>ancient</b> <b>murrelet</b> and tufted puffin. Bald eagles are a common sight and nest along the coastline. Because the islands are situated along the Pacific flyway, dozens of species of migrating birds stop here in spring and fall.|$|E
50|$|The <b>ancient</b> <b>murrelet</b> {{is listed}} as of 'Special Concern' by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada because populations have been greatly reduced {{over the past century}} by {{mammalian}} predators such as rats introduced to their breeding islands by visiting ships in the 1800s. On one island, the number of breeding pairs was reduced from 200,000 pre-infestation to about 14,000 in the 21st century.|$|E
50|$|It nests {{in small}} crevices, caves and under dense bushes on arid islands in loose {{scattered}} colonies. It {{returns to the}} colony only at night, laying two eggs which are incubated for about a month. Like other synthliboramphine murrelets (e.g. the <b>ancient</b> <b>murrelet)</b> the chicks are highly precocial, leaving the nest within two days of hatching and running actively towards the sea, where the parents call to them. Once at sea the family swims to offshore waters.|$|E
50|$|Some <b>ancient</b> <b>murrelets</b> migrate 8000 km from Canada {{to winter}} near Japan and China, {{even though the}} climate is similar at the two ends. It is the only bird known to cross the whole North Pacific. They then start a return trip in February, flying {{four or five hours}} a day. Genetic {{evidence}} shows that the species originated in Asia and only recently colonized North America, so their migration takes them back to their original homeland.|$|R
50|$|Point No Point is {{best known}} for its water-related species: gulls, cormorants, loons, terns, jaegers, ducks, grebes, mergansers, scoters, brant, and alcids. When the tide is running, there are flocks of Bonaparte's gulls and seabirds, often a veritable feeding frenzy. Jaegers are often seen flying through the gull and (in fall) tern flocks. <b>Ancient</b> <b>murrelets</b> can be seen {{offshore}} in November - {{this is one of the}} best sites in Washington for this species. Along the sandy beaches, shorebirds can be seen. The marsh attracts a variety of passerines, particularly in migration. Point No Point has produced many notable rarities, both in the offshore waters and in the marsh.|$|R
40|$|Increased {{shipping}} in British Columbia (BC) waters poses {{risks for}} marine birds from marine oil spills. <b>Ancient</b> <b>Murrelets</b> (Synthliboramphus antiquus), small marine diving birds of which {{half of the}} world's population breeds in BC, are especially susceptible to oiling immediately after departing from their breeding colonies, as their offspring are flightless, constraining their parents to remain with them. In 2014 we deployed geolocator loggers on <b>Ancient</b> <b>Murrelets</b> at four breeding colonies, two on the east and two {{on the west coast}} of Haida Gwaii to investigate patterns of post-breeding dispersal and subsequent migratory movements. Birds from east coast colonies moved south and east after leaving their colonies, remaining in Queen Charlotte Sound and adjacent waters for 4 - 6 weeks, whereas those from west coast colonies moved steadily north and west, so that they left BC waters earlier than those from east coast colonies. These movements were consistent with being driven by surface currents. In June, all birds moved rapidly to the eastern Aleutians, SE Bering Sea, and waters off Kamchatka, where they probably moulted. In August, most moved north, some passing through Bering Straits into the Chukchi Sea. In October-November some birds returned to waters off western N America (33 %) and the remainder carried on westwards to waters off Japan, Korea and NE China. For the former group the movement to the Bering Sea in June constituted a moult migration and, as such, is the first described for an auk. Those birds wintering in Asia began moving east in February and arrived off BC in March, when observations at colonies show that burrow visits begin in Haida Gwaii. Our data suggest that, immediately after colony departure, birds from the east coast colonies (about half the population of Haida Gwaii) are at higher risk from potential oil spills in northern British Columbia waters than those breeding on the west coast...|$|R

50|$|<b>Ancient</b> <b>murrelets</b> nest in colonies on {{islands in}} the north Pacific, mainly {{off the coast of}} North America, but also near Japan and Kamchatka. One of its largest colonies is on Frederick Island in British Columbia. They lay two eggs (sometimes one) in burrows {{excavated}} in forest soil among tree roots, under logs or in grass tussocks, occasionally in rock crevices. They arrive at and depart from their nesting grounds at night, presumably to reduce predation, and perhaps for the same reason the young are never fed at the nest, being taken to sea 1-3 days after hatching. The parents and young recognise one another by call and after the chicks have run from the burrow to the sea, they locate their parents by call and the entire family swims immediately out to sea. The family continues to move away from land, usually at night, and will travel a long distance, typically up to 30 miles (50 km), for at least twelve hours. After that, the young are fed exclusively at sea by their parents for more than a month. This species spends less time on land than any other bird.|$|R

50|$|One species, the <b>ancient</b> <b>murrelet,</b> fledges {{two days}} after hatching, running from its burrow to the ocean and its calling parents. Once it reaches the ocean, its parents care for it for several weeks. Other species, such as guillemots and terns, leave the nesting site while they are still unable to fly. The {{fledging}} behavior of the guillemot is spectacular; the adult leads the chick {{to the edge of}} the cliff, where the colony is located, and the chick will then launch itself off, attempting to fly as far as possible, before crash landing on the ocean, as shown in this National Geographic video.|$|E
50|$|The {{island and}} {{differentiated}} itself {{from many of}} the others in the Aleutian chain by supporting a large and diverse group of seabirds, most famously for their colony of more than 100,000 crested auklets and 150,000 least auklets, which was one of only seven colonies in the Aleutian chain. Other species included seabirds such as the Fork-tailed petrel, the whiskered auklet, the <b>ancient</b> <b>murrelet,</b> gulls, guillemots, and cormorants. These seabirds attracted many avian predators as well, such as bald eagles and peregrine falcons. The birds of Kasatochi were the dominant vertebrates on the island and the most prominent link between the terrestrial and marine ecosystems.|$|E

50|$|The Peale's falcon {{is known}} to {{concentrate}} its hunting efforts on Alcids. In fact the subspecies is well known to nest very near seabird colonies {{for the convenience of}} close hunting grounds. However this is not necessary for a successful eyrie. In a study on Amchitka Island from 1968-1973, it was found that an average of 18.6 eyries on the island (over the course of the study) were in no close proximity to seabird colonies as no sizable colonies existed on the island. Instead, these large, robust birds fly out to sea to hunt up to 50 miles from land, rather than inland toward the interior. Which is quite an impressive physical feat as they must either eat their prey while flying or carry the prey back to land to perch and then consume it, as peregrines are not known to be able to rest and stay afloat on water as seabirds do. Preferred species on Amchitka consisted of: Crested auklet (Aethia cristatella), 26.48% of the diet's biomass; <b>Ancient</b> <b>murrelet</b> (Synthliboramphus antiquus), 17.18% of the biomass; and alcids as a group provided 65.52% of the biomass.|$|E

40|$|Introduced predators {{have caused}} declines and extirpations of many populations of insular avifauna, {{especially}} nocturnal burrow-nesting seabirds. The successful eradication of these introduced predators {{has resulted in}} recovery of some species but not others, the reasons why are not understood. The objectives of my study were to understand the recovery of seabird populations after the removal of an introduced predator by studying the processes underlying the formation of new colonies and the expansions of colonies after establishment. Specifically I asked: 1) how nocturnal seabird colony area and population size change with time and across a metapopulation; and 2) how prospectors choose suitable breeding habitat by looking at habitat selection and use of public information. Using an information theoretic approach I found 1) regional differences in both colony area and population density over time and between island groups; 2 a) Ancient Murrelets breeding in Haida Gwaii exhibit {{a high degree of}} plasticity in their use of available breeding habitats and the amount of suitable habitat at Langara Island has not changed between 1981 - 2007; 2 b) differences in colony attendance decisions between sites, but prospectors were not conclusively more risk averse than breeders; and 2 c) <b>Ancient</b> <b>Murrelet</b> prospector activity increased during playback of conspecific vocalizations, but found no preference for burrows with olfactory and/or visual cues over those left empty. Overall, I conclude that although <b>Ancient</b> <b>Murrelet</b> life-history may prolong recovery times, both recovery and recolonization of restored breeding sites are plausible and using playbacks of conspecific vocalizations is an effective method to attract prospecting individuals to those sites...|$|E
40|$|The nesting {{activity}} of eagles, falcons, ravens and owls {{has been studied}} on Limestone Island since 1990. Annual surveys have recorded nest activities, locations and species occurrences. In 2002, all known nest trees were measured and previous breeding records compiled. A total of 10 nests from five species have been located on the island, with nesting density as high as 1 pair per 12 ha in some years. As many as four species have nested successfully in one year. All nests (except falcons) were built in Sitka spruce trees and most were either adjacent to or within the <b>Ancient</b> <b>Murrelet</b> colony. There are five bald eagles nests on the island, {{and at least one}} was active in all but three years. Peregrine Falcons were known to nest on the island for seven years, producing at least one chick in all active years.

40|$|The {{incubation}} shift {{length of}} the <b>Ancient</b> <b>Murrelet</b> (Synthliboramphus antiquus), an exceptionally long and varied for an auk. I studied colonies of this species at East Limestone Island (1993 - 1995, 2002 - 2003 : data collected by Laskeek Bay Conservation Society) and Reef Island (2007 - 2008), Haida Gwaii, British Columbia. Incubation shift length was correlated between pair members and my results show that maintaining incubation schedule was {{an essential component of}} reproductive success. Incubation shift length varied in response to prevailing local weather and sea conditions (e. g. wind speed, wave height), perhaps as a consequence of reduced foraging efficiency. Incubation shift length was longer in years when sea surface temperature in April was high. In years with longer shift, birds had lower reproductive success and chicks departed the nest with a lower body mass. My results explained if we assume that multi-day incubation shifts in Ancient Murrelets are the adaptively preferred strategy, through reduction in predation risk, but that actual shift lengths are modified by immediate weather and foraging constraints...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Perfluoroalkyl {{substances}} (PFAS) such as perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCAs) and perfluoroalkyl sulfonates (PFSAs) {{have become}} virtually ubiquitous throughout the environment, and, based on laboratory studies, have known toxicological consequences. Various {{national and international}} voluntary phase-outs and restrictions on these compounds have been implemented over the last 10 to 15 years. In the present study, we examine trends (1990 / 1991 â 2010 / 2011) in aquatic birds (<b>ancient</b> <b>murrelet,</b> Synthliboramphus antiquus [2009 only]; Leachâs storm-petrels, Oceanodroma leucorhoa; rhinoceros auklets, Cerorhinca monocerata; double-crested cormorants, Phalacrocorax auritus; and great blue herons, Ardea herodias). The PFCA, PFSA, and stable isotope (d 15 N and d 13 C) data collected from these species from the Pacific coast of Canada, ranging over 20 to 30 years, were used to investigate temporal changes in PFAS coupled to dietary changes. Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), the dominant PFSA compound in all 4 species, increased and subsequently decreased in auklet and cormorant eggs {{in line with the}} manufacturing phase-out of PFOS and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), but concentrations continuously increased in petrel eggs and remained largely unchanged in heron eggs.

During incubation shifts, egg neglect is sometimes necessary to avoid starvation, but may compromise the current reproductive attempt. However, factors underlying this decision process are poorly understood. We focus on the <b>ancient</b> <b>murrelet,</b> Synthliboramphus antiquus, an alcid with exceptionally long incubation shift lengths, and test the impact of environmental factors on incubation shift length in relation to reproductive success. Methodology/Principal Findings: Using an information theoretic approach, we show that incubation shift length was a strong predictor of reproductive success for ancient murrelets at Reef Island, Haida Gwaii, British Columbia, Canada during the 2007 and 2008 breeding seasons. The most important factors explaining an individualâs shift length were egg size, wind speed {{and the length of}} the mateâs previous shift. Wind speed and tide height were the two most important factors for determining foraging behavior, as measured by dive frequency and depth. Conclusions/Significance: Our study demonstrates that (i) species-specific reproductive strategies interact with environmental conditions such as wind speed to form multiple incubation patterns and (ii) maintaining regular incubation shifts is an essential component of reproductive success.

40|$|Haida Gwaii {{supports}} 1. 5 million nesting seabirds, including 50 % of {{the global}} <b>Ancient</b> <b>Murrelet</b> population and significant nesting populations of several other seabird species. Invasive rats pose a significant threat to the conservation of these populations. In 2010, Gwaii Haanas National Park Reserve and Haida Heritage Site initiated the Night Birds Returning project {{with the goal of}} eradicating invasive rats on a number of islands. I used automated acoustic recording units (ARUs) to explore seabird presence and relative abundance of Ancient Murrelets Synthliboramphus antiquus, Cassinâs Auklets Ptychoramphus aleuticus, Fork-tailed Storm-Petrels Oceanodroma furcata and Leachâs Storm-Petrels Oceanodroma leucorhoa on rat-infested and rat-free islands in Gwaii Haanas, during the main breeding season. I assessed the effect of rat presence using two measures derived from acoustic data, relative abundance and attendance period. Relative abundance was higher on rat-free islands, compared to rat-infested islands, but was still less than half that of rat-free islands. Attendance periods were also longer and vocal activity more regular on rat-free islands. My results showed a statistically significant negative effect of rat presence on detections of Ancient Murrelets (p = 0. 01) and Fork-tailed Storm-Petrels (p = 0. 03), but the effect was not significant for Cassinâs Auklets (p = 0. 31) and Leachâs Storm-Petrels (p = 0. 47). That rats had not extirpated all seabirds from these islands came as a surprise. Indeed, data suggest that breeding may in fact be occurring, though whether this results in successful fledging still remains unknown. On a positive note, my results suggest that seabird recovery may occur more rapidly following rat eradication on these islands, compared to islands where the species of interest are extirpated...|$|E
