50|$|The Committee {{brokered}} {{with the}} Vreemdelingenpolitie (lit. <b>Aliens</b> <b>Police)</b> for entry visas for refugees. The Dutch government policy {{was aimed at}} minimizing the numbers of entry visas that were granted to refugees, with priority to those refugees whose further emigration looked likely. The promotion of emigration was therefore {{one of the main}} tasks of the Committee. Over the years, the Emigration Department helped more than 18,000 refugees emigrate from the Netherlands, as well as assisting the direct emigration of more than 3,000 people in other countries.|$|E

Penalties prescribed in Article 104(a) and Article 114 range up to 10 years’ imprisonment, while penalties prescribed in Article 217 range from six months’ to 10 years’ imprisonment. These penalties are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape.|$|E

5000|$|From {{the end of}} 1945 until 1993, the Dutch police was {{composed}} of the gemeentepolitie (municipal police) and the rijkspolitie (state police). In 1993, the police were reorganized into 25 regional forces and the Dutch National Police Agency (KLPD). In total, the police employ over 40,000 individuals. The 25 regional forces are responsible for police care in their respective region in the Netherlands. Each force comprises a number of regional and specialist departments, such as the Juvenile and Vice Squad, the Criminal Intelligence Service and the <b>Aliens</b> <b>Police.</b> The KLPD {{is responsible for the}} supervision and surveillance of the motorways, airways, and waterways, as well as providing security for the Royal Family. In the event of serious emergencies, the police cooperate with the fire brigade, ambulance service and other government agencies in the security region that corresponds to the police region. The police in a municipality are available 24 hours every day for basic law enforcement. The Dutch government is keen to put more police [...] "on the street." [...] The uniformed policemen on the street are those of the patrol service. Surveillance is frequently done from patrol cars, horses, and motorbikes. Since the early 1990s several police regions have been working with neighborhood teams called neighborhood supervisors. The States-General crafts rules to manage the police, while the Minister of the Interior is responsible for the central administration of the police. One of the burgomasters in a region is the force administrator. The chief public prosecutor and the force administrator have the ultimate responsibility for the administration of the police force. The regional chief of police however, is vested with the day-to-day management of the police force. When investigating crime, police follow the instructions of the public prosecutor—a member of the Public Prosecution Service. The Public Prosecution Service, {{under the auspices of the}} Ministry of Justice, is responsible for maintaining order. Police traditionally carry a baton, handcuffs, and a firearm; regulations are in place restricting the use of violence in general and firearms in particular.|$|E
30|$|At {{province}} level, cooperation {{has become}} important {{only in the}} transposition of the Return Directive 2013 into provincial law. Seven out of nine provinces have newly inserted the obligation to cooperate with obtaining travel documents into the state laws on basic care support. 3 Only law makers in the provinces of Vienna and Vorarlberg refrained from considering it a condition for access to welfare support. In practice, rather than actively contributing to the procedure by the <b>aliens</b> <b>police,</b> a non-removed person must make oneself regularly accessible for the authorities (High level bureaucrat at Viennese agency for social policy, personal communication, 3 October 2016; Case worker at an NGO in Vienna, personal communication, 24 October 2016). In the cases cooperation is interpreted as visibility.|$|E
30|$|Checking {{cooperation}} {{is a difficult}} administrative procedure with inherent tensions, inconsistencies and discretion. Not surprisingly, it is return officers and not welfare authorities, who control whether CWR is successfully met by the migrant in question. Secondly, control of {{cooperation is}} not delegated to sub-national parties, but it remains with the federal authorities. Practically, the administrative procedure goes like this: Officers of the <b>aliens</b> <b>police</b> evaluate the cooperation activities and decide whether the requirement has been fulfilled. At this point {{it is in the}} discretionary power of these to decide, for instance, when an embassy refuses to issue travel documents. Then it has to be assessed whether the individual has a role in that, because he/she has not provided the necessary written or oral information (High level bureaucrat at Viennese agency for social policy, personal communication, 3 October 2016). In the case of confirmed non-cooperation, the BFA sends a notification to the relevant provincial authorities that the person is not cooperating. This notification allows the provinces’ administrations to cut basic welfare support for this individual. The consequences of the notification are not clearly defined by law and by no means consistently applied across the country. In some provinces documented non-cooperation may lead to dismissal, others do not consider non-cooperation as a criterion for barring rejected asylum seekers from basic welfare support; it may just lead to requesting the individual {{to get in touch with}} the <b>aliens</b> <b>police</b> (High level bureaucrat at Viennese agency for social policy, personal communication, 3 October 2016; Head of legal counseling for asylum seekers at an NGO in Vienna, personal communication, 14 September 2016). In this instance, regional bureaucrats in the field of welfare decide about the eligibility to social assistance. Therefore, not only different in-country legal provisions exist, but also distinctive interpretations and handlings occur across the provinces.|$|E

30|$|According to the Basic Welfare Support Agreement, {{rejected}} asylum applicants have to {{be deemed}} non-removable “for legal or factual reasons” to be allowed access to basic care. In any case, reasons for postponement must not lie within the person’s own responsibility. When the migrant refuses to cooperate then he/she {{runs the risk of}} being excluded, not only from basic care, but also to be detained in detention centres. The individual has to cooperate in clearing all practical barriers towards removal which are rooted in his/her behaviour. According to the law and to interviews with representatives of state authorities and advocacy groups, the individual has to comply with the following rules: The non-removed person has to establish contact with migration control authorities, specifically with the <b>aliens</b> <b>police.</b> Their activities must be actively supported by delivering identification documents (name and country of origin). Cooperation also includes handing out a passport photograph and not to refuse signatures. The law, however, can never be clear-cut in defining the scope of the required cooperation. Discretionary assessments by street-level bureaucrats whether the criterion has been sufficiently demonstrated are necessary and crucial. Moreover, the given embassies play a role, sometimes in favour, sometimes {{to the detriment of the}} migrant (Head of legal counseling for asylum seekers at an NGO in Vienna, personal communication, 14 September 2016).|$|E

The Ministry of Education approved the use of NGO-produced anti-trafficking materials in schools in 2007, and the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs cooperated with NGOs in a series of training and trafficking awareness activities aimed at vulnerable population groups, including Roma populations. During the reporting period, the government published a brochure educating its nationals traveling to other EU countries for employment opportunities about the dangers of trafficking. Slovakia did not provide trafficking awareness training for deployed peacekeeping officials during the reporting period.|$|R
40|$|In 2004, the ČR {{joined the}} European Union and in 2007 joined the Schengen area. These two {{historic}} moments were {{the reason for}} creation of legislative changes, which mainly relates {{to the protection of}} external borders of the state, public order in the ČR and the introduction of various laws and directives governing the movement of goods, among other things and stay of foreigners in the ČR. Part of the strategy to ensure public order in the Republic is among other type plan "large-scale migration wave. " It {{is important to note that}} the accession to the Schengen area was to abolish national border crossings and it is now possible the free movementofpersons, includingforeigners. ČR has become a country that has the inner land borders and outer boundaries is only at international airports. Although this fact has brought for the citizens of ČRfor example great ease when traveling, but there is a large open space for international crimes, which are undoubtedly related to illegal migration and smuggling, human trafficking, narcotics and weapons. Based on the above fact, the conclusion is sufficiently justified that type plan ?wave of large-scale migration? currently has its real foundation and there is a risk that the migration wave of foreigners can come to the ČR. This assumption is supported by research of migratory flows to Europe and to the ČR, it is also influenced by the unstable political situation in African and Asian countries.

40|$|Between 1830 and 1952 alien {{legislation}} in Belgium {{changed from a}} liberal to a much more restrictive form of legislation. In 1939 a stricter 'decree-law on the alien police' replaced the liberal law of 1897, {{as a result of}} the pressure that had been accumulating since WW I from working class, middle class and government circles. It gave the executive power a large measure of authority over aliens staying in Belgium. After the war, the <b>alien</b> <b>police</b> remained in favour of the decree-law which was temporarily prolonged pending a new alien law. Only in march 195 1, the senate found the time to discuss alien legislation. The result of these discussions differed strongly from the project the government had originally drafted in December 1949. The Senate had taken into account not only the suggestions by the members of the executive power, but also those by Edmond Rouse, reporter of the senate committee of justice, who advocated alien rights against arbitrary governmental actions. Influenced by the administration, the Attorneys General of the Courts of Appeal and the Minister of Justice Pholien, the House of Representatives modified the bill in a restrictive way. After new delays, the Senate succeeded in cancelling some of the most restrictive articles, although overall the eventual Act remained very restrictive. This new alien law was clearly meant to protect the Belgian state against unwanted aliens. This can be explained by three contemporary phenomena: the predominant position of the executive power in the trias politica, the general mood of distrust because of the Cold War and the new guest worker policy, which consisted of treating aliens as purely economic assets. Equally important is the fact that the aliens themselves were not involved in the realization of the law and that only a few individuals were prepared to defend alien rights before parliament.
