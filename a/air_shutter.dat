2500|$|The US and Canadian {{version of}} the Chevrolet Cruze entered limited {{production}} at Lordstown, Ohio, in July 2010 as a 2011 model, replacing the Chevrolet Cobalt. Full production began September 8, 2010. For these markets, the Cruze utilizes a more advanced Watts Z-link rear suspension from the Opel Astra (J). Offered in LS, LT, LTZ, and Eco trim lines, both the 1.8-liter and the turbocharged 1.4-liter engines are offered, coupled with either a six-speed manual or automatic transmission. With a starting price slightly higher than most compact competitors, the base model Cruze LS is equipped with the 1.8-liter gasoline engine and comes with air-conditioning and power locks, the higher-level LT and LTZ models is fitted with the 1.4-liter turbocharged gasoline engine. For the Eco model, aerodynamic improvements have been made such as an electronically controlled <b>air</b> <b>shutter</b> that adjusts air flow to the engine depending on the temperature, wind speed and tow weight. To save weight, Chevrolet replaces the space saving spare tire and jack on the Eco model with a tire inflator kit, reducing weight by [...]|$|E
40|$|Various {{investigators}} {{have assumed that}} hydrogen will be compatible with conventional gas delivery systems and that, with minor modifications, hydrogen can be utilized in existing equipment for heating and cooking. The paper addresses {{some of the issues}} of concern in the compatibility of natural gas systems with hydrogen and hydrogen mixtures and identifies areas for which tests, research, or development are appropriate. Requirements to be met by atmospheric burners built for most commercial and residential gas appliances are discussed. Expected modifications to appliances for satisfactory operation with hydrogen are closing the primary <b>air</b> <b>shutters,</b> replacing the burners, adjusting the appliance gas regulator for proper delivery pressure, and possibly replacing the gas regulator or its vent...|$|R
50|$|Fail safe {{shutters}} {{protect the}} instrument if the purge air supply fails. These are key in systems where flue gas is under positive pressure and, therefore, is very corrosive. If the purge <b>air</b> fails, <b>shutters</b> allow the instrument to function {{for a few}} days without causing harm.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} operating conditions in a refrigeration system located in supermarket Rema 1000 Prinsensgata, Trondheim (Norway). The main emphasis is put on a problem with oversized gas cooler, which occurs during low ambient temperatures (in winter), and is a root of unstable operation of the whole system. Furthermore, possible solutions to this problem are depicted, among them are: division and cut-down of gas cooler s surface, application of bypassing valve to the gas cooler, triggering fresh air inside supermarket s airhandling-unit (AHU), and utilization of <b>air</b> <b>shutters</b> to the gas cooler. Subsequently, a simulation in a heat exchanger modelling computer program hXSIM (the Heat Exchanger Simulator) of the gas cooler split and increased subcooling is depicted. Lastly, the thesis portrays practical changes which were implemented in the system: exploitation of heat recovery system by snowmelting- unit (street-heating-unit), use of a shut-off valve to decrease {{the capacity of the}} gas cooler, implementation of a new controller for the ejectors, reprogramming fans, and also connection of the data acquisition system with energy meters mounted in supermarket s machine room...|$|R
50|$|First Presbyterian Church of Harrisonburg did not deed {{the chapel}} to the Mabel Memorial {{congregation}} as agreed, although the stipulated conditions were met and the agreement fully upheld. The Mabel Memorial congregation was {{unaware that the}} agreement was not upheld. The members invested in many improvements (central heating and <b>air,</b> new <b>shutters,</b> new lighting, {{the addition of a}} Fellowship Hall etc.) with the understanding that the property had been deeded to them.|$|R

The place had been kept <b>aired,</b> but the <b>shutters</b> were shut, and they opened them themselves. He looked round upon the {{familiar}} objects--some complete and matured, the main of them seedlings, grafts, and scions of beauty, waiting for a mind to grow to perfection in.|$|R
50|$|On May 24, 2017, GMC {{announced}} that the 2018 Yukon Denali XL will receive a new grille with a layered appearance like the ones on its redesigned 2018 Acadia and Terrain brands, featuring high-intensity-discharge headlights and LED daytime running lights. The refreshed design provides better airflow to the radiator, and when less cooling <b>air</b> is needed, <b>shutters</b> behind the grille close to improve aerodynamics and increase efficiency. The interior will feature new ash wood trim that GMC says gives the cabin a richer appearance. A new 10-speed automatic transmission will be mated to its 420-horsepower, 6.2-liter V-8 engine, replacing the 8-speed transmission.|$|R
50|$|Roadway Express was {{spun off}} as a debt-free company by itself. Since they had the legal rights to the Roadway name, the {{companies}} left in the holding company changed the name to Caliber Systems. Roadway Global <b>Air</b> was <b>shuttered</b> and {{what was left of}} it was sold to BAX Global. After the Roadway spinoff, management attempted to put the four regional LTL companies together as a nationwide company, which failed miserably. Coles and Spartan were shut down, Central was sold back to its original owners, and Viking-the only profitable companyâ€”continued service in their regional area. After the UPS strike of 1997, Federal Express acquired Caliber Systems. In fall 1999, RPS was renamed Fed Ex Ground, and Roberts Express became Fed Ex Custom Critical. Later on, American Freightways approached Fed Ex about buying west coast carrier Viking Freight, to complete full coverage of the United States. Instead Fed Ex bought American Freightways and merged it with Viking to make Fed Ex Freight. Watkins Motor Lines was acquired, and run separately as Fed Ex National LTL, and then finally merged into Fed Ex Freight. Fed Ex Ground started a home delivery division, Fed Ex Home Delivery.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} model-scale {{measurements and}} numerical models of a floating {{oscillating water column}} (OWC) system, consisting of an air cavity coupled with a Wells-type turbine energy extraction device. As waves travel through the OWC, air pressure cycles are generated. The oscillating water column captures the resulting pneumatic energy by directing the chamber pressure and air flow through the Wells turbine. A special feature {{of the system is}} a shuttering device that momentarily interrupts turbine <b>air</b> flow. The <b>shuttering</b> device is used to control the cavity pressure for optimum turbine performance. Shuttering in this manner can be shown to improve overall system efficiency up to 20 % pressure. Physical scale models of the OWC system were tested in a wave tank at Maine Maritime Academy (MMA) at 1 / 30 th scal...|$|R
60|$|As {{he spoke}} thus, he stepped towards the little window, which, as the turret {{projected}} considerably from the principal {{line of the}} building, not only commanded a very pretty garden of some extent, belonging to the inn, but overlooked, beyond its boundary, a pleasant grove of those very mulberry trees which Maitre Pierre {{was said to have}} planted for the support of the silk worm. Besides, turning the eye from these more remote objects, and looking straight along the wall, the turret of Quentin was opposite to another turret, and the little window at which he stood commanded a similar little window in a corresponding projection of the building. Now, {{it would be difficult for}} a man twenty years older than Quentin to say why this locality interested him more than either the pleasant garden or the grove of mulberry trees; for, alas! eyes which have been used for forty years and upwards, look with indifference on little turret windows, though the lattice be half open to admit the <b>air,</b> while the <b>shutter</b> is half closed to exclude the sun, or perhaps a too curious eye--nay, even though there hang on the one side of the casement a lute, partly mantled by a light veil of sea green silk. But, at Durward's happy age, such accidents, as a painter would call them, form sufficient foundation for a hundred airy visions and mysterious conjectures, at recollection of which the full grown man smiles while he sighs, and sighs while he smiles.|$|R
6000|$|... "We tore {{slowly along}} the {{overhanging}} bushes in a whirl of broken twigs and flying leaves. The fusillade below stopped short, as I had foreseen it would when the squirts got empty. I threw my head back to a glinting whizz that traversed the pilot-house, in at one shutter-hole and out at the other. Looking past that mad helmsman, who was shaking the empty rifle and yelling at the shore, I saw vague forms of men running bent double, leaping, gliding, distinct, incomplete, evanescent. Something big appeared in the <b>air</b> before the <b>shutter,</b> the rifle went overboard, and the man stepped back swiftly, looked at me over his shoulder in an extraordinary, profound, familiar manner, and fell upon my feet. The {{side of his head}} hit the wheel twice, and the end of what appeared a long cane clattered round and knocked over a little camp-stool. It looked as though after wrenching that thing from somebody ashore he had lost his balance in the effort. The thin smoke had blown away, we were clear of the snag, and looking ahead I could see that in another hundred yards or so I would be free to sheer off, away from the bank; but my feet felt so very warm and wet that I had to look down. The man had rolled on his back and stared straight up at me; both his hands clutched that cane. It was the shaft of a spear that, either thrown or lunged through the opening, had caught him in the side just below the ribs; the blade had gone in out of sight, after making a frightful gash; my shoes were full; a pool of blood lay very still, gleaming dark-red under the wheel; his eyes shone with an amazing luster. The fusillade burst out again. He looked at me anxiously, gripping the spear like something precious, with an air of being afraid I would try to take it away from him. I had to make an effort to free my eyes from his gaze and attend to the steering. With one hand I felt above my head for the line of the steam-whistle, and jerked out screech after screech hurriedly. The tumult of angry and warlike yells was checked instantly, and then from the depths of the woods went out such a tremulous and prolonged wail of mournful fear and utter despair as may be imagined to follow the flight of the last hope from the earth. There was a great commotion in the bush; the shower of arrows stopped, a few dropping shots rang out sharply--then silence, in which the languid beat of the stern-wheel came plainly to my ears. I put the helm hard a-starboard at the moment when the pilgrim in pink pyjamas, very hot and agitated, appeared in the doorway. 'The manager sends me--' he began in an official tone, and stopped short. 'Good God!' he said, glaring at the wounded man.|$|R
