50|$|A SASER device should {{consist of}} a pumping {{mechanism}} and an active medium. The pumping procedure can be induced for example by an alternating electric field or with some mechanical vibrations of resonators, followed by <b>acoustic</b> <b>amplification</b> in the active medium. The fact that a SASER operates on principles remarkably similar to a laser, can lead to an easier way of understanding the relevant operation circumstances. Instead of a feedback-built potent wave of electromagnetic radiation, a SASER delivers a potent sound wave. Some methods for sound amplification of GHz-THz have been proposed so far. Some have been explored only theoretically {{and others have been}} explored in non-coherent experiments.|$|E

The electric arc motion in dc plasma torch {{is the main}} acoustic source which is modified by the injection of suspension. The analyses of cross-correlations between the arc voltage and the acoustic signal show a decrease in time propagations due to local cooling of the plasma jet when injecting suspensions. Moreover, power spectra highlight <b>acoustic</b> <b>amplifications</b> below a certain frequency threshold and attenuations above.

50|$|We {{note that}} {{acoustic}} waves of 100 GHz to 1 THz have wavelengths in nanometre range. Sound amplification {{according to the}} experiment taken in the University of Nottingham could be based on an induced cascade of electrons in semiconductor superlattices. The energy levels of electrons are confined in the superlattice layers. As the electrons hop between gallium arsenide quantum wells in the superlattice they emit phonons. Then, one phonon going in, produces two phonons {{coming out of the}} superlattice. This process can be stimulated by other phonons and then give rise to an <b>acoustic</b> <b>amplification.</b> Upon the addition of electrons, short-wavelength (in the terahertz range) phonons are produced. Since the electrons are confined to the quantum wells existing within the lattice, the transmission of their energy depends upon the phonons they generate. As these phonons strike other layers in the lattice, they excite electrons, which produce further phonons, which go on to excite more electrons, and so on. Eventually, a very narrow beam of high-frequency ultrasound exits the device. Semiconductor superlattices are used as acoustic mirrors. These superlattice structures must be in the right size obeying the theory of multilayer distributed Bragg reflector, in similarity with multilayer dielectric mirrors in optics.|$|E
40|$|National audienceThe study {{focuses on}} characterizing the {{whistling}} ability of an axisymmetric orifice in a confined flow, using numerical simulation. A single hole orifice in a duct can generate whistling {{when it is}} submitted to a low Mach number flow. Whistling {{is a consequence of}} an <b>acoustic</b> <b>amplification</b> by the shear flow downstream of the orifice, coupled to an external acoustic resonator. The feedback of the resonator coupled to the <b>acoustic</b> <b>amplification</b> leads to whistling by linear instability. Recently a whistling criterion was experimentally validated, based on the acoustic scattering matrix of an orifice. Balancing the incoming and the scattered acoustic powers, the frequencies at which <b>acoustic</b> <b>amplification</b> occurs can be determined. The present study deals with the <b>acoustic</b> <b>amplification</b> mechanism. A Large Eddy Simulation (LES) is performed for an orifice submitted to a $ 0. 026 $ Mach number flow with a Reynolds number around $ 10 ^ 4 $. Broadband acoustic signals are applied in the inlet and outlet of the computational domain. The times series of the LES are finally post-processed with a Wiener-Hopf Inversion technique to obtain the coefficients of the scattering matrix in the linear regime. The whistling criterion is then computed from this scattering matrix. Comparison with the experimental data are provided...|$|E

50|$|The {{most common}} type of pickups used for <b>acoustic</b> guitar <b>amplification</b> are piezo and {{magnetic}} pickups.

50|$|Since {{electric}} amplification {{eliminates the}} need for a resonant chamber, electric grand pianos are smaller and lighter (around 300 lb), and consequently more portable, than <b>acoustic</b> pianos. Electric <b>amplification</b> also bypasses the difficulty of having to mic a conventional grand piano, and thus makes an electric grand easier to set up with a sound system.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} plasma {{oscillations}} on <b>acoustic</b> wave <b>amplification</b> by carrier drift in semiconductors is discussed.

It is shown that if the plasma frequency is much lower than the reciprocal value of the electron relaxation time for the scattering on phonons and impurities, the results are in agreement with available calculations based on the electrical conductivity - diffusion equation.

40|$|A theory, {{based on}} Chambers' method to the {{classical}} Boltzmann equation, is developed for an <b>acoustic</b> <b>amplification</b> in both degenerate and nondegenerate piezoelectric semiconductors subjected to the Hall geometrically configured electric and magnetic fields. It is found that an amplification constant for qR> 1 holds not only for a magnetic field ω(c) τ> 1 but for ω(c) τ 1 while the amplification constant for qR 1; q is the wave number vector of sound, R the cyclotron radius, ω(c) the cyclotron frequency, 1 the mean free path and τ the relaxation time. A generalized attenuation (amplification) constant is presented through an energy conservation law, being applicable to the sounds propagating at any angle {{with respect to the}} particle drift so the off-axis as well as on-axis amplifications are surely involved.

40|$|AbstractThis work {{seeks to}} put forward an {{approach}} to enhance the voltage generated by an acoustic based piezoelectric energy harvester. When a flexible triangular foil is attached perpendicular to the PVDF cantilever beam there {{is an increase in}} strain in the beam, also there is an increment in the <b>acoustic</b> pressure <b>amplification</b> rate of the Helmholtz resonator due to the dimensional modification of its neck. The integrated effects of these modifications of the harvester on the output voltage have been investigated. When sound incident {{on the surface of the}} neck of the resonator, an oscillatory pressure is produced in the cavity, which in turns vibrates the PVDF cantilever beam and voltage generates. By amending the structure of the PVDF cantilever with a polyester foil attached perpendicular to it, the cantilever is driven into concurrent bending and twisting by the cavity pressure and therefore makes a noteworthy increase in the output voltag...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to study the {{influence}} of the shape of the temperature distribution on the thermoacous-tic amplification in an annular thermoacoustic prime mover. An analytical model is presented and the acoustic field in the whole device is computed for an arbitrary temperature distribution.

These results provide the opportunity to predict qualitatively the variation of the thermoacoustic amplification, when the temperature distribution is modified by acoustic streaming or acous-tically enhanced thermal conductivity.

For two-dimensional confined electrons interacting with the acoustic waves we have solved the Boltzmann equation in a parallel electric field.

40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted to the {{calculation}} of the noise spectrum radiated from a turbulent jet flame based on a statistical model of the thermoacoustic source terms. Afterwards, the effects of the sound refraction by the temperature field of the flame are investigated. The sound production terms, derived from an aerothermoacoustic model (Boineau, 1997) and similar to Strahle's one (Strahle, 1985), are represented as a set of equivalent monopoles placed on the burner's axis. Effects of the severe temperature gradients surrounding the thermoacoustic sources are then investigated by using a recent numerical technique called Dual Reciprocity Boundary Element Method. This method is shown to be very fruitful and adapted to our current problem since it allows to take realistic configurations into account (presence of the burner tube, temperature field, distribution of monopoles [...] .) and automatically satisfies the radiation condition at infinity.
