5|$|Arranging a sleep {{environment}} that is quiet, very dark, and cool is recommended. Noises, light, <b>and</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> temperatures {{have been shown to}} disrupt continuous sleep. Other recommendations that are frequently made, though less studied, include selecting comfortable mattresses, bedding, and pillows, and eliminating a visible bedroom clock, to prevent focusing on time passing when trying to fall asleep.|$|E
5|$|Legislators found {{themselves}} in an unusual <b>and</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> situation. Nuclear weapons were terrifying, {{and the nature of}} nuclear energy was not widely understood. Because it was so new, there were no policies or precedents to guide legislators, and traditional party alignments were absent. The scientists who had developed the new technology had never been vocal before, but suddenly were now. The victorious conclusion of World War II gave the armed forces enormous prestige, but there still remained the long-standing American distrust of standing armies, and the tradition of civilian control of the military.|$|E
5|$|Around 1500, the {{innovation}} of the angled bastion {{was developed in}} Italy. With developments such as these, Italy pioneered permanent artillery fortifications, which took over from the defensive role of castles. From this evolved star forts, also known as trace italienne. The elite responsible for castle construction {{had to choose between}} the new type that could withstand cannon fire and the earlier, more elaborate style. The first was ugly <b>and</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> and the latter was less secure, although it did offer greater aesthetic appeal and value as a status symbol. The second choice proved to be more popular as it became apparent that there was little point in trying to make the site genuinely defensible in the face of cannon. For a variety of reasons, not least of which is that many castles have no recorded history, there is no firm number of castles built in the medieval period. However, {{it has been estimated that}} between 75,000 and 100,000 were built in western Europe; of these around 1,700 were in England and Wales and around 14,000 in German-speaking areas.|$|E

5|$|In 1924 Hepburn {{gained a}} place at Bryn Mawr College. She {{attended}} the institution primarily to satisfy her mother, who had studied there, and recalled disliking the experience. It {{was the first time}} she had been in school for several years, and she was self-conscious <b>and</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> with her classmates. She struggled with the scholastic demands of university, and once was suspended for smoking in her room. Hepburn was drawn to acting, but roles in college plays were conditional on good grades. Once her marks had improved, she began performing regularly. She performed the lead role in a production of The Woman in the Moon in her senior year, and the positive response it received cemented Hepburn's plans to pursue a theatrical career. She graduated with a degree in history and philosophy in June 1928.|$|E
25|$|The streetcars {{became popular}} because they rode on smooth rails, {{while most of}} the streets of the era were dirt or made of {{cobblestone}} pavers. These roads became treacherous to pedestrians <b>and</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> to ride on in horse-drawn buggies, especially during Minnesota winters.|$|E
25|$|Burg (castle complex), with Gothic double staircase, built between 1438 and 1453 by Emperor Frederick III {{because the}} old castle on the Schlossberg {{was too small}} <b>and</b> <b>uncomfortable.</b> The Burg {{remained}} the residence of the Inner Austrian Court until 1619. Today, it serves as residence {{of the government of}} Styria.|$|E

25|$|Dai pai dong, open-air {{restaurants}} {{in a big}} tent, is another classic restaurant type that appeared in Wan Chai. Despite the often unclean <b>and</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> eating conditions, many people are attracted to the freshly made steamed rice roll, congee and chow mein early in the morning. Due to urban renewal projects in recent years, most of these restaurants are fading away.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, {{the network}} was heavily damaged by {{continued}} bombing, and several lines were immediately converted to bus operation due to the prohibitive cost of repairs. After the war, tram was seen as being obsolete, noisy <b>and</b> <b>uncomfortable.</b> The decision to replace all tram services by buses was made in 1949, with the last tram running in 1958.|$|E
25|$|It is now {{the middle}} of July, {{and we have not}} yet had what could {{properly}} be called summer. Easterly winds have prevailed for nearly three months past... the sun during that time has generally been obscured and the sky overcast with clouds; the air has been damp <b>and</b> <b>uncomfortable,</b> and frequently so chilling as to render the fireside a desirable retreat.|$|E

5000|$|Ian Young {{points out}} that the novel portrays {{homosexuality}} <b>and</b> bisexuality as <b>uncomfortable</b> <b>and</b> uncertain ways of living, respectively.

25|$|The {{original}} Welsh Highland Railway {{was formed}} in 1922 from the merger of two companies – the North Wales Narrow Gauge Railways (NWNGR) and the Portmadoc, Beddgelert and South Snowdon Railway (PBSSR), successor to the Portmadoc, Croesor and Beddgelert Tram Railway. It was never a commercial success; the carriages of the 1890s were outdated <b>and</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> for so long a ride, the journey took too long and the service {{had a reputation for}} being unreliable..|$|E
25|$|Prior to the {{construction}} of the railway to Pine Creek, the Adelaide River crossing was the overnight stopping point for the Haimes Royal Mail Coach which linked Southport with the goldfields. This was a vital and well utilised transport link, but was a slow <b>and</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> service. Legislation providing for an upgraded transport link was passed in 1883 by the government of John Cox Bray {{in the form of the}} Palmerston and Pine Creek Railway Bill.|$|E
25|$|Ray Forrestier {{is waiting}} in the salon for Leopold. When the child arrives, their {{interaction}} is strained, distant, <b>and</b> <b>uncomfortable.</b> A {{good portion of the}} narrative focuses on Ray's conflicting feelings about Leopold, his marriage to Karen, the child's inescapable presence in their shared life, and Ray's own situational obligations. Ultimately, Ray and Leopold leave the house together, dropping off Henrietta at the train station on the way; the two children say their goodbyes and head off in different directions.|$|E

25|$|Management which models {{the use of}} {{articulated}} dissent {{contributes to}} the use of articulated dissent among its employees (Kassing & Avtgis, 1999). Subordinates who witness their supervisors successfully articulating dissent may be more likely and more willing to adopt similar strategies. However, a supervisor must keep in mind that expressing dissent can be very difficult <b>and</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> for lower-level managers and employees. Therefore, supervisors should not only take actions to encourage dissent, they must be willing to seek out individuals willing to say no to them (Roberto, 2005).|$|E
25|$|Entering somebody's {{personal}} space is normally {{an indication of}} familiarity and sometimes intimacy. However, in modern society, especially in crowded urban communities, {{it can be difficult}} to maintain {{personal space}}, for example when in a crowded train, elevator or street. Many people find such physical proximity to be psychologically disturbing <b>and</b> <b>uncomfortable,</b> though it is accepted as a fact of modern life. In an impersonal, crowded situation, eye contact tends to be avoided. Even in a crowded place, preserving personal space is important, and intimate and sexual contact, such as frotteurism and groping, is unacceptable physical contact.|$|E
25|$|The {{novel is}} about the American Morgan family and their {{experiences}} in Wales. It opens {{a year after the}} death of the mother as the older daughter Jen is flying from America to Wales to join her family for Christmas. Mr. Morgan has taken a temporary teaching position at the University of Aberystwyth and with the two younger children is living in a nearby seaside village. Jen is dismayed to find their home cold <b>and</b> <b>uncomfortable,</b> her brother and sister unhappy, and their father essentially ignoring them. Eventually she decides to stay in Wales and keep house for the family, reversing her former decision to finish high school in America.|$|E

60|$|We {{found the}} cells, though narrow <b>and</b> dark, not <b>uncomfortable,</b> <b>and</b> the guide conceded {{that they had}} {{undergone}} some repairs since Ecelino's time.

25|$|I {{was getting}} so heavy that even my vocalizing was getting heavy. I was tiring myself, I was perspiring too much, and I was really working too hard. And I wasn't really well, as in health; I couldn't move freely. And then I {{was tired of}} playing a game, for {{instance}} playing this beautiful young woman, and I was heavy <b>and</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> to move around. In any case, it was uncomfortable and I didn't like it. So I felt now if I'm going to do things right—I've studied all my life to put things right musically, so why don't I diet and put myself into a certain condition where I'm presentable.|$|E
25|$|Almodóvar {{originally}} thought Julieta {{would serve as}} his English-language film debut, with American actress Meryl Streep in the lead role, playing three versions of the character at 20, 40 and 60 years old. He met with Streep, who agreed to the concept, and found locations in Vancouver, Canada, where Munro based her stories. He also searched for locations {{in the state of}} New York, but eventually shelved the idea, unhappy at the prospect of filming in either country <b>and</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> with his ability to write and film in English. Years later, members of his production team suggested that the script should be revisited but, this time, setting the film in Spain and making it in Spanish.|$|E
25|$|On April 22, Powell {{repeatedly}} banged {{his head}} into the iron walls of his cell aboard the Saugus. Whether this was a suicide attempt (as his jailers believed) or not, it deeply alarmed military officials. A canvas padded hood, with only a slit for the mouth and nostrils, was fashioned. Powell and all the other prisoners aboard the monitors were forced to wear them 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to prevent any further suicide attempts. Only Mary Surratt and Dr. Mudd were not required to wear the hoods. Powell cried when the hood was placed on him. The hoods were hot, claustrophobic, <b>and</b> <b>uncomfortable,</b> and in the humid confines of the monitors in the steaming Washington summer the prisoners suffered immensely. On June 6, Hartranft ordered them removed—except for Powell's.|$|E
