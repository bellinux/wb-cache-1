5000|$|The primary {{function}} of a parry is to prevent <b>an</b> <b>opponent's</b> attack from landing. During a bout, parries are commenced from the [...] "en garde" [...] (neutral) position, when <b>an</b> <b>opponent's</b> attack is considered threatening.|$|R
50|$|A {{player can}} capture <b>an</b> <b>opponent's</b> piece by landing their piece upon it. The {{captured}} piece {{is removed from}} the board and must start again. A piece cannot land on <b>an</b> <b>opponent's</b> piece that is on a resting square.|$|R
50|$|The game {{is similar}} to Bio F.R.E.A.K.S. and the Mortal Kombat series. Like in Mortal Kombat, when a {{character}} wins both rounds, they can perform an execution move on the enemy. Methods included severing <b>an</b> <b>opponent's</b> limbs and torso (Al Rashid), beheading (The Executioner), repeated stabbing (Koyasha), impaling the <b>opponent</b> with <b>a</b> sword (Lord Deimos), breaking <b>an</b> <b>opponent's</b> back by hoisting them {{on top of a}} Viking helmet and throwing them to the ground, causing their body to explode (Ragnar), and some more far-fetched methods including pulling out <b>an</b> <b>opponent's</b> heart (Xiao Long), shrinking (Namira), transforming the <b>opponent</b> into <b>a</b> chicken (Taria), and entering <b>an</b> <b>opponent's</b> body and bursting them from inside (Dregan).|$|R
5|$|Driehaus did {{not have}} <b>an</b> <b>opponent</b> in any of his Democratic primaries, and he earned at least 57% shares {{of the vote in}} each of his general {{elections}} for state legislature.|$|E
5|$|Firearms combat is first-person, with {{character}} points {{assigned to}} the firearms skill determining the shot's accuracy {{and how long it}} takes to target <b>an</b> <b>opponent.</b> Melee combat is third-person, with access to weapons such as katanas and sledgehammers for melee combat, or pistols, crossbows and flamethrowers for firearm combat. If a player sneaks up on <b>an</b> <b>opponent,</b> they can perform an instant kill; weapons provide unique instant kill animations. The player can block attacks manually or automatically, by leaving their character idle. They can use stealth in missions by sneaking past guards and security cameras, picking locks, and hacking computers to locate alternative routes.|$|E
5|$|General Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien, {{commander}} of the British II Corps, issued orders forbidding friendly communication with the opposing German troops. Adolf Hitler, then a young corporal of the 16th Bavarian Reserve Infantry, was also <b>an</b> <b>opponent</b> of the truce.|$|E
50|$|Binder: The buckler {{could be}} used to bind <b>an</b> <b>opponent's</b> sword hand and weapon as well as their buckler against their body. The buckler was also very useful in grappling, where it allowed <b>an</b> <b>opponent's</b> arms to be easily wrapped up and controlled.|$|R
50|$|If it {{is within}} a player’s ability to do so, they may move one of their pieces to capture <b>an</b> <b>opponent’s</b> piece. This is {{achieved}} by moving a piece onto a space occupied by <b>an</b> <b>opponent’s</b> piece. Only one piece may be captured per turn.|$|R
50|$|Jujutsu {{expresses the}} {{philosophy}} of yielding to <b>an</b> <b>opponent's</b> force {{rather than trying to}} oppose force with force. Manipulating <b>an</b> <b>opponent's</b> attack using his force and direction allows jujutsuka to control the balance of their opponent and hence prevent the opponent from resisting the counterattack.|$|R
5|$|Lisa - Lisa {{is another}} smaller {{character}} who uses her speed to make quick strikes on opponents. Her saxophone attack can hit <b>an</b> <b>opponent</b> anywhere within the ring.|$|E
5|$|Neal is <b>an</b> <b>opponent</b> of the Iraq War, {{saying the}} war was based on false intelligence. He voted against the {{original}} invasion in 2003 and opposed President Bush's 2006 request to send additional troops. He cited veterans' affairs as his top priority in 2010.|$|E

5|$|Sportsmanship {{is also an}} {{important}} aspect when it comes to fights. While an enforcer may start a fight in response to foul play, it is generally not acceptable to start a fight to retaliate against <b>an</b> <b>opponent</b> who scored fairly.|$|E
5|$|These {{moves are}} {{designed}} to be used in flurry combinations. For instance, the player can Seismic Slam <b>an</b> <b>opponent,</b> which pulls in enemies, and progress into a Rising Uppercut, which tosses the opponent into the air. During that toss, the player can charge the Rocket Punch and release as the opponent returns to the ground. Alternatively, the player can launch into the air, pick <b>an</b> <b>opponent</b> to slam, and punch them at close range. The character is built for aggressive playstyles and advanced players.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal set a Champions League record {{during the}} 2005–06 season by going ten matches without conceding a goal, beating the {{previous}} best of seven set by A.C. Milan.

5|$|As <b>an</b> <b>opponent</b> of the Vietnam War, Bedell {{signed a}} {{petition}} urging against United States {{military intervention in}} Iraq. This petition was signed {{with the names of}} 70 former Congressmen from the 1970s and was presented in a press conference on March 15, 2003. Bedell said that it was unbelievable for the United States to settle disputes with war, and he said that an Iraq war would be similar to the Vietnam War.|$|E

5|$|Following {{his term}} as governor, Morehead {{returned}} to the state legislature. <b>An</b> <b>opponent</b> of abolitionism, he accompanied John Speed Smith to Ohio to secure the return of slaves owned by Kentuckians. He was later appointed to the U.S. Senate, where he remained a close ally of Clay's. In 1847, he retired to Covington, Kentucky, practicing law {{until his death in}} 1854.

The upset drew {{comparisons}} to the Miracle on Ice from 1980. In the medal games, Canada defeated Sweden to claim its second consecutive gold medal, while the Americans beat Finland to win the bronze.|$|E
5|$|Predator {{avoidance}} {{may also}} explain the frequent behaviour where S.latus will carry food items {{back to a}} shelter before consuming them. When two S.latus individuals compete for a food item, they may use the enlarged second antennae to flip their opponent over, by wedging the antennae underneath the opponent's body and quickly raising them. An alternative strategy is to grip <b>an</b> <b>opponent</b> and begin the tail-flipping movement, or {{to engage in a}} tug of war.|$|E
5|$|Race meetings, concert parties (including drag acts– good drag queens were {{in great}} demand), {{trips to the}} seaside and {{football}} matches were organised to keep men entertained. There were various unofficial publications, including the “Wipers Times”– these give an insight into the views of ordinary soldiers and junior officers. Overt patriotism was rare, and politicians such as (Prime Minister) Asquith and Ramsay MacDonald (<b>an</b> <b>opponent</b> of the war, later Labour Prime Minister) were satirised.|$|E
