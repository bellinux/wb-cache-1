5|$|Although Clarke wrote little, {{due in part}} to {{her ideas}} about the role of a female composer, her work was {{recognised}} for its compositional skill. Most of her works have yet to be published (or have only recently been published), and were largely forgotten after she stopped composing. Scholarship <b>and</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> her compositions revived in 1976. The Rebecca Clarke Society was established in 2000 to promote the study and performance of her music.|$|E

She planned to visit Italy for research, and wanted to see Douglas in Capri again, but received news of his death in February 1952, which left her deeply saddened.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis study {{conducted}} in Malaysia, investigated {{the effects of}} instructional congruence in teaching science on changing students’ attitudes <b>and</b> <b>interests</b> <b>in</b> science in three “low performing” secondary schools. In this study, the implementation of instructional congruence in teaching science significantly promotes {{a positive effect on}} students’ attitudes <b>and</b> <b>interests</b> <b>in</b> the aspects of practical work of science, science outside of school, future participation in science, a combined <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> science <b>and</b> overall attitudes in science...|$|R
5|$|Personal {{growth and}} forms of heroism are central themes of the story, along with motifs of warfare. These themes have led critics to view Tolkien's own {{experiences}} during World War I as instrumental in shaping the story. The author's scholarly knowledge of Germanic philology <b>and</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> fairy tales are often noted as influences.|$|E

5|$|Born in North Sydney, New South Wales, Madgwick {{trained as}} a schoolteacher before {{attaining}} degrees in economics and economic history from the University of Sydney and University of Oxford. Appointed as a lecturer at the University of Sydney, Madgwick worked in the school's extension program which gave him experience <b>and</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> adult education. With the onset of World War II, Madgwick and his colleagues proposed an adult education plan for the Australian Army. The government accepted the plan and, from 1941 to 1946, Madgwick served on active duty as Director of the Australian Army Education Service, which provided adult education services to the Army's 250,000 members during the conflict.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{continued}} designs <b>and</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> the idea, no funding was ever appropriated {{for the construction}} of a flight-deck cruiser; in addition, evaluation of the design by the Naval War College determined that even a 12,000-ton ship was too small for the concept's intended characteristics to be effectively realized, and thus the ship would be ineffective in battle. In 1940, the design was formally shelved, although provision was made for reconsideration of the concept at a future date. The entry of the United States into World War II following the bombing of Pearl Harbor, however, removed the primary justifications for the concept of a hybrid warship, as naval limitations treaties were now moot and adequate funding was now available {{for the construction of}} more conventional ships. As a result, the flight deck cruiser concept was never revisited.|$|E
5|$|Founded in 1936, the Bristol Historical Society is {{committed}} to saving, collecting, and promoting historical research <b>and</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> southern New England, with a specific focus on the town of Bristol. Originally, the Bristol Historical Society was located in the Rogers Free Library, but a fire destroyed {{a part of the}} collections on July 27, 1957. The jail, which had been abandoned by the state in June of the same year, was selected by the Society as its new home and leased from the state. In 1972, the Bristol Historical Society was renamed to the Bristol Historical and Preservation Society to reflect its preservation interests. In 1973, the Society purchased the Bristol County Jail from the state. The Society restored the jail cells through a matching grant from the National Park Service and opened the cells as a public exhibit.|$|E
5|$|Geneticists {{often use}} viruses as vectors to {{introduce}} genes into cells {{that they are}} studying. This is useful for making the cell produce a foreign substance, or to study the effect of introducing a new gene into the genome. In similar fashion, virotherapy uses viruses as vectors to treat various diseases, as they can specifically target cells and DNA. It shows promising use {{in the treatment of}} cancer and in gene therapy. Eastern European scientists have used phage therapy as an alternative to antibiotics for some time, <b>and</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> this approach is increasing, because of the high level of antibiotic resistance now found in some pathogenic bacteria.|$|E

5|$|Photography in Denmark has {{developed}} from strong participation <b>and</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> the very {{beginnings of the}} art in 1839 {{to the success of}} a considerable number of Danes in the world of photography today. Pioneers such as Mads Alstrup and Georg Emil Hansen paved the way for a rapidly growing profession during {{the last half of the}} 19th century while both artistic and press photographers have made internationally recognized contributions. Although Denmark was slow to accept photography as an art form, Danish photographers are now increasingly active, participating in key exhibitions around the world.|$|E
5|$|The album's working {{title was}} {{originally}} announced as Magic's in the Makeup in May 1998 {{and later as}} Saturn Returns in November 1999. Stefani was confused by her feelings of depression <b>and</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> Sylvia Plath while recording the album. Her boyfriend Gavin Rossdale {{told her that she}} was going through her Saturn return. Saturn's orbit takes 29.4 Earth years and, in astrology, the time when Saturn returns to its position during a person's birth is believed to be a period of self-evaluation. Stefani was born October 3, 1969, and many of the songs were written during her Saturn return.|$|E
5|$|The professionalization of {{the field}} began soon after, during the 1950s and 1960s. This move coincided with the {{replacement}} of coroners with medical examiners in many locations around the country. It was during this time that the field of forensic anthropology gained recognition as a separate field within the American Academy of Forensic Sciences and the first forensic anthropology research facility and body farm was opened by William M. Bass. Public attention <b>and</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> forensic anthropology began to increase around this time as forensic anthropologists started working on more high-profile cases. One of the major cases of the era involved anthropologist Charles Merbs who helped identify the victims murdered by Ed Gein.|$|E

In 1979, it became a World Heritage Site, along with the rest of the Theban Necropolis. Exploration, excavation and conservation continues in the valley, and a new tourist centre has recently been opened.|$|E
