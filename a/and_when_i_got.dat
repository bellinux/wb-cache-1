500|$|A {{commonly}} cited {{story of}} how Moon joined the Who is that he appeared at a show shortly after Sandom's departure, where a session drummer was used. Dressed in ginger clothes and with his hair dyed ginger (future bandmate Pete Townshend later described him as a [...] "ginger vision"), he claimed to his would-be bandmates that he could play better; {{he played in the}} set's second half, nearly demolishing the drum kit in the process. In the words of the drummer, [...] "they said go ahead, and I got behind this other guy's drums and did one song-'Road Runner.' I'd several drinks to get me courage up <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> onstage I went arrgggGhhhh on the drums, broke the bass drum pedal and two skins, and got off. I figured that was it. I was scared to death. Afterwards I was sitting at the bar and Pete came over. He said: 'You ... come 'ere.' I said, mild as you please: 'Yes, yes?' And Roger, who was the spokesman then, said: 'What are you doing next Monday?' I said: 'Nothing.' I was working during the day, selling plaster.

[...] Moon later claimed that he was never formally invited to join the Who permanently; when Ringo Starr asked how he had joined the band, he said he had [...] "just been filling in for the last fifteen years." ...|$|E

2500|$|En {{route to}} Washington, D.C., {{he stopped at}} the Holabird Ordnance Depot in Baltimore, Maryland, where a mimeographed {{publication}} titled Army Motors was put together. [...] "Together with the people there ... I helped develop its format. I began doing cartoons – and we began fashioning a magazine that had the ability to talk to the G.I.s in their language.

2500|$|The script of [...] "Band of Brothers" [...] {{describes}} Darius as a monk with a [...] "hideously ugly face", {{but when}} the producers cast the part, they chose German actor Werner Stocker, who did not fit this description. Abramowitz explains, [...] "Darius, originally in the script, was written as almost {{to look like the}} Hunchback of Notre Dame, to be physically ugly and with a glorious soul. <b>And</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> to France, I noticed that they cast this young, handsome German actor named Werner Stocker. I said, 'Wait a minute. What's going on here? He's supposed to be ugly.' And it seemed that the Germans, who were putting up a great deal of money, didn't want the only German actor in the show to be ugly; so he wasn't ugly.
