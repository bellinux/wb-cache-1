5|$|As the condor's {{population}} {{continued to}} decline, discussion began <b>about</b> <b>starting</b> a captive breeding {{program for the}} birds. Opponents to this plan argued that the condors {{had the right to}} freedom, that capturing all of the condors would change the species' habits forever, and that the cost was too great. However, the project received the approval of the United States government, and the capture of the remaining wild condors was completed on Easter Sunday 1987, when AC-9, the last wild condor, was captured. At that point, there were only 22 condors in existence, all in captivity.|$|E

They reconciled and traveled together to Lesbos, where they lived happily together for a short time and talked <b>about</b> <b>starting</b> a school of poetry for women like the one which Sappho, according to tradition, had founded on Lesbos some 2,500 years before. However, Vivien soon got a letter from her lover Baroness Hélène van Zuylen and went to Constantinople thinking she would break up with her in person. Vivien planned to meet Barney in Paris afterward but instead stayed with the Baroness and this time, the breakup was permanent.|$|E

5|$|After graduation, Sheppard was {{recommended}} to Tuscaloosa Theological Institute (now Stillman College, which dedicated its library in Sheppard's honor in 1959) in Alabama. He met Lucy Gantt {{near the end}} of his time there and the two became engaged, although they would not marry for ten years. Sheppard cultivated a desire to preach in Africa, but despite the support of Tuscaloosa founder Charles Stillman, the Southern Presbyterian Church had yet to establish its mission in the Congo. He was ordained in 1888 and served as pastor to a church in Atlanta, Georgia, but did not adapt well to the life of an urban black in a heavily segregated area of the Southern United States. After two years of writing to the Presbyterian Foreign Missionary Board in Baltimore, Maryland to inquire <b>about</b> <b>starting</b> a mission in Africa, he became frustrated by the vague rationale of the rejection letters and took a train to Baltimore to ask the chairman in person. The man politely informed Sheppard that the board would not send a black man without a white supervisor.|$|E
5|$|Toyah argues with Leanne's half-sister, Eva Price (Catherine Tyldesley), for not {{passing on}} a message <b>about</b> <b>starting</b> a {{shift at the}} pub, but they agree to call a truce. Peter leaves {{cigarettes}} at Leanne's flat and Toyah tries to take the blame but Simon is forced to cover for her. Simon later tells Eva who blackmails Toyah: stop Peter from shutting down Aidan Connor's (Shayne Ward) factory or Eva will tell Leanne about Peter and Toyah. Peter agrees to Eva's demands and they continue their affair. Toby returns in January 2017 and demands Toyah sign a paper to destroy their frozen embryos. Toyah is reluctant and after a heart to heart, they kiss. However, Toyah {{makes it clear that}} she doesn't love Toby and is staying with Peter, causing Toby to lash out and leave. Peter learns what has happened and decides to drop off Chloe Tipton (Jo-Anne Knowles), making Toyah jealous. They later make up and Leanne catches Peter and Toyah kissing. During a heated argument, Leanne disowns Toyah and refuses to talk to her again, despite her efforts. Leanne forgives Toyah after she helps deliver baby Oliver in a lift after it breaks down.|$|E

He inspired the others of the joys of being self-employed and a discussion went on all night on the 23 April 1967 <b>about</b> <b>starting</b> up a computer-manufacturing company. Based on that they had a technological edge and believed to have good timing, a decision to start a company was made.|$|E
25|$|The Jarva {{tunnelling}} machine was purchased and {{imported from the}} United States in 1970 {{at a cost of}} $1.4 million, a decision considered adventurous at the time as a TBM had not been used on this type of geology before. Despite concerns <b>about</b> <b>starting</b> at the western portal with the TBM, it was considered to be the better option to alleviate problems with drainage that would ensue otherwise because of the 1:300 ascending grade from west to east. Also, the tunnel was to terminate at the eastern end on a viaduct over the Whatakao Stream which had yet to be built.|$|E

This was portrayed as a demotion by his detractors, although Prime Minister David Cameron denied this was the case. Gove told BBC News that he had mixed emotions <b>about</b> <b>starting</b> the new role, saying it was a privilege to become Chief Whip but that leaving the Department for Education was “a wrench”.|$|E

25|$|In 1957, Leigh, aged 40 {{and retired}} from {{modeling}}, {{was living in}} France. She decided to start another modeling agency, this time in France. The police and courts insisted she was running an illegal employment agency, and she was fined. After World War II, employment agencies were declared illegal. Leigh contacted the Fords <b>about</b> <b>starting</b> a legitimate modeling agency, {{the first of its}} kind in that country. She continued to run a successful agency, but in 1959 was charged in court again. After hiring a lawyer, she finally won her case. The Fords agreed to expand their modeling business into Europe, and Leigh would represent them in France as well as scout for potential models all over Europe. Leigh was so successful that she opened branches in London and Hamburg, Germany. She would trade her European models for Ford's American models and vice versa.|$|E
25|$|The first {{shots of}} the battle were fired early {{on the morning of}} October 8. Finding that there were algae-covered pools of water in the {{otherwise}} dry bed of Doctor's Creek, troops from the 10th Indiana advanced to take advantage of them. They encountered the forward men of the 7th Arkansas and some shots were exchanged. At 2 a.m., Buell and Gilbert, the III Corps commander, ordered newly promoted Brig. Gen. Phil Sheridan to seize Peters Hill; Sheridan started off with the brigade of Col. Daniel McCook (the younger brother of the I Corps commander). Sheridan seized the hill, driving the Arkansans back to the main line of their brigade, but continued to push across the creek. Liddell's brigade could not check the momentum of Sheridan's thirsty soldiers and Buckner, Lidell's division commander, was ordered by Polk not to reinforce him, but to pull his brigade back. Polk was concerned <b>about</b> <b>starting</b> a general engagement {{to the west of the}} Chaplin River, fearing he was outnumbered. Meanwhile, on the Union side, a nervous Gilbert ordered Sheridan to return to Peters Hill.|$|E
500|$|The {{screenplay}} did not {{yet have}} a satisfactory ending, and, despite the producers and studio executives worried <b>about</b> <b>starting</b> filming without a set conclusion, Liman opted to finish the script during principal photography. McQuarrie at one point suggested adding a twist involving the Mimics figuring out Cage's attack on Paris and resetting time during his strike, but discarded it as [...] "you were so exhausted by the time you got to that point." [...] Eventually, McQuarrie considered that focusing on the comedic aspects meant [...] "it needed to end in a way that wasn't harsh", and thus opted to end the plot where it started, on the helicopter bringing Cage to London, fulfilling the notion that [...] "comedies generally {{have to go back to}} the way things were".|$|E

500|$|Once the Persian {{forces in}} Europe had largely been neutralised, the Athenians {{seem to have}} gone <b>about</b> <b>starting</b> to extend the League in Asia Minor. The islands of Samos, Chios and Lesbos seem to have become members of the {{original}} Hellenic alliance after Mycale, and presumably were also therefore original members of the Delian League. However, it is unclear exactly when the other Ionian cities, or indeed the other Greek cities of Asia Minor, joined the league, though they certainly did at some point. Thucydides attests the presence of Ionians at Byzantium in 478 BC, so {{it is possible that}} at least some of the Ionian cities joined the league in early 478 BC. The Athenian politician Aristides was said to have died in Pontus (c. 468 BC) whilst on public business. Given that Aristides was responsible for organising the financial contributions of each League member, this trip may have been connected with expansion of the League into Asia Minor.|$|E

[...] Hubbard is born in a nativity scene, surrounded by parents and barnyard animals, as an angel proclaims, [...] "Billions of years of evolution had climaxed with his birth." [...] He begins to question the nature of his existence. [...] He is adrift on a boat in the Pacific Ocean during his service in World War II, when he begins to think <b>about</b> <b>starting</b> a religion. [...] Hubbard tells his followers about what he has learned through his travels in [...] "Science of the Mind", singing about [...] "the key to being free, the way to be happy". [...] He tells his followers that during the War [...] "I saw how emotion can make you blind", and he begins to teach his followers about the reactive mind.|$|E
