A fast-acting acid reacts in a wet mixture with baking soda at room temperature, and a slow-acting acid will not react until heated in an oven. Baking powders that contain both fast- and slow-acting acids are double-acting; those that contain only one acid are single-acting. By providing a second rise in the oven, double-acting baking powders increase the reliability of baked goods by rendering the time elapsed between mixing and baking less critical, {{and this is the}} type most widely available to consumers today. Double-acting baking powders work in two phases; once when cold, and once when hot.

40|$|Abstract—Aqueous, pore-water, and whole-sediment bioassays were {{conducted}} with meiobenthic copepods with different infaunal lifestyles to assess the <b>acute</b> and chronic <b>toxicity</b> of the organophosphorous pesticide azinphosmethyl (APM) and its bioaccumulation potential in sediments. Biota sediment accumulation factors were {{an order of magnitude}} higher for the deeper burrowing Amphiascus tenuiremis (26. 6) than the epibenthic Microarthridion littorale (2. 2). The female A. tenuiremis APM median lethal concentration (LC 50; 3. 6 mg/L) was twice the male LC 50 (1. 8 mg/L), in straight seawater exposures, and nearly 20 % higher than males in whole-sediment exposures (540 vs 456 ng/g dry weight). Amphiascus tenuiremis were 17 times more sensitive to sediment-associated APM than M. littorale. In pore-water–only exposures, the adult mixed-sex A. tenuiremis LC 50 (5. 0 mg/L) was nearly twice the seawater mixed-sex LC 50 (2. 7 mg/L). Dissolved organic carbon in pore water was five times higher (20 mg/L) than in seawater-only exposures (4 mg/L). Differences in <b>acute</b> <b>toxicity</b> within <b>exposure</b> media were driven by species- and sex-specific differences in lipid content. Amphiascus tenuiremis likely experienced greater exposure to sediment-associated toxicants via longer periods of direct contact with pore water than M. littorale and, therefore, exhibited correspondingly higher bioaccumulation and <b>acute</b> <b>toxicity.</b> Copepod reproduction was significantly reduced (. 60 %) in 14 -d sediment culture exposures at sublethal APM levels, suggestin...|$|R

The result of this study can help to designing environmental standard and legislations for nanoparticles. Materials and Methods: Different concentrations of nano ZnO and TiO 2 nanoparticles were added to nutrient Agar culture media. Then, definite numbers of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus bacteria were added to culture media and inhibition of these bacteria growth was measured in comparison to controls. Obtained data were analyzed to determine nanoparticles' EC 50 and NOEC (No Observed Effect Concentration) using SPSS ver. 16 and Probit standard test. Results: 24 -hours EC 50 of nano ZnO using E. coli and S. aureus determined to be 5. 47 mg/L and 2. 38 mg/L respectively. In addition, 24 -hours EC 50 of nano TiO 2 using E. coli and S. aureus determined to be 5366 mg/L and 3471 mg/L respectively.

40|$|Harmful algal blooms {{are natural}} {{phenomena}} {{caused by the}} massive growth of phytoplankton that may contain highly toxic chemicals, the so-called marine biotoxins causing illness and even death to both aquatic organisms and humans. Their occurrence has been increased in frequency and severity, suggesting a worldwide public health risk. Marine biotoxins can accumulate in bivalve molluscs and regulatory limits have been set for some classes according to European Union legislation. These compounds can be distinguished in water- and fat-soluble molecules. The first group involves those of Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning and Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning, whereas the toxins soluble in fat can cause Diarrheic Shellfish Poisoning and Neurotoxic Shellfish Poisoning. Due {{to the lack of}} long-term toxicity studies, establishing tolerable daily intakes for any of these marine biotoxins was not possible, but an acute reference dose can be considered more appropriate, because these molecules show an <b>acute</b> <b>toxicity.</b> Dietary <b>exposure</b> assessment is linked both to the levels of marine biotoxins present in bivalve molluscs and the portion that could be eaten by consumers. Symptoms may vary from a severe gastrointestinal intoxication with diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramps to neurological disorders such as ataxia, dizziness, partial paralysis, and respiratory distress. The official method for the detection of marine biotoxins is the mouse bioassay (MBA) showing some limits due to ethical restrictions and insufficient specificity. For this reason, the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method has replaced MBA as the reference technique.

A lipopolymeric micelle co-encapsulating an in vitro optimized, synergistic fixed-ratio combination of paclitaxel (PTX) and clofazimine (B 663) has been developed and called Riminocelles™. The present pre-clinical study investigated the <b>acute</b> <b>toxicity,</b> systemic <b>exposure,</b> repeat dose <b>toxicity</b> and efficacy of Riminocelles in parallel to Taxol® at an equivalent PTX dose of 10 mg/kg. Daily and weekly dosing schedules were evaluated against Pgp-expressing human colon adenocarcinoma (HCT- 15) xenografts implanted subcutaneously in athymic mice. Riminocelles produced statistically significant (p< 0. 05) tumor growth delays of 3. 2 and 2. 7 days for the respective schedules in contrast to Taxol delaying growth by 0. 5 and 0. 6 days. Using the control tumor doubling time of 4. 2 days, tumor-cell-kill values of 0. 23 for Riminocelles and 0. 04 for Taxol following daily schedules were calculated. A significant weight loss of 5. 7 % after 14 days (p< 0. 05) relative to the control group (n= 8) was observed for the daily Taxol group whereas Riminocelles did not incur significant weight loss neither were blood markers of <b>toxicity</b> elevated after <b>acute</b> administration (n= 3).

40|$|The use of aerosol {{products}} containing {{surface active}} agens frequently results in adverse, sometimes even severe, health effects in consumers. Upon use of waterproofing sprays in particular, severe cases of acute lung injury {{have been reported}} repeatedly. It is hypothesized that impairment of the pulmonary surfactant by deposition of inhaled respirable particles of the active compound {{is one of the}} main causes of the acute lung injury. Since the inhalation toxicity cannot be predicted a priori based on the physical and chemical properties of the formulation, proper test strategies are required to ensure consumer safety. We propose to combine screening tests addressing both, <b>exposure</b> and <b>acute</b> lung <b>toxicity.</b> The <b>exposure</b> potential of the spray product is characterized by determining the release fraction of the active compound in the respirable particle size range under conditions relevant for the product application. This is carried out by spraying defined quantities of the product into a control volume and measuring the concentration of health related size fractions. This procedure takes into account spray ageing, especially size reduction of the droplets due to solvent evaporation. The isolated perfused lung is proposed as a model for testing <b>acute</b> <b>toxicity.</b> Ventilated rat lungs are exposed to aged aerosols with proper particle size of approximately 1 m MMAD generated from the liquid spray formulation. Lung compliance and lung resistance are continuously monitored during exposure. Dose dependent deviations from the controls are used as read-out parameters.

This study identified the frequency of and reasons {{for the development of}} high-grade <b>acute</b> <b>toxicity</b> and possible sequelae. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Irradiated children have been prospectively documented since 2001 in the Registry for the Evaluation of Side Effects After Radiation in Childhood and Adolescence (RiSK) database in Germany and since 2008 in the registry for radiation therapy toxicity (RADTOX) in Sweden. Data were collected using standardized, published forms. Toxicity classification was based on Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer criteria. RESULTS: As of June 2013, 1500 children have been recruited into the RiSK database and 485 into the RADTOX registry leading to an analysis population of 1359 patients (age range 0 - 18). A total of 18. 9 % (n= 257) of all investigated patients developed high-grade <b>acute</b> <b>toxicity</b> (grades 3 / 4). High-grade toxicity of the bone marrow was documented for 63. 8 % (n= 201) of those patients, oral mucositis for 7. 6 % (n= 24), and dermatitis for 7. 6 % (n= 24). Patients with high-grade <b>acute</b> <b>toxicity</b> received concomitant chemotherapy more frequently (56 %) than patients with no or lower <b>acute</b> <b>toxicity</b> (31. 5 %).

40|$|Chemical {{evaluations}} and characterization had often {{served as the}} commonly adopted options for assessing {{the potential impact of}} pollutants, which at the same time provide insight into the possible remediation technologies. However, heterogeneous substances may not be best studied in aforementioned forms because of the varied characteristics and concentrations of the discrete components. Leachate which is the liquid by-product of waste decomposition in landfills or dump sites is one such heterogeneous fluid that can easily pollute the environment (terrestrial and aquatic). With increase in waste generation in Malaysia, leachate production becomes inevitable especially as landfilling is the ultimate predominant waste disposal option. An average of 300, 000 L of leachate is produced daily from each landfill and there are over 200 landfills in operation. Considering the high distribution of waste disposal sites in Malaysia, the study was designed to characterize leachate from the different landfill types in relation to their operational status. It aimed to assess the mortality effects of the leachate on aquatic life such that leachate toxicity index can be proposed. Similarly, the study was undertaken to investigate a possible accumulation of heavy metals in fish species due to leachate pollution {{and at the same time}} adopting a bioremediation option that will help remove the heavy metal that percolate in the soil due to leachate leaks, as a way of preventing heavy metals from getting to nearby surface water. Various methods adopted in the study ranged from the physico-chemical characterization of leachate, <b>acute</b> <b>toxicity</b> <b>exposure,</b> histopathology, to microbial characterization and bioaugmentation of leachate contaminated soil. Microsoft Excel, SPSS, EPA Finney’s Probit and Datafit were statistical tools used in the study. Some similarities were found among the characterized leachate samples. At 482 – 51, 200 mg/L COD and 127 – 27, 000 mg/L BOD 5, the organic concentrations of the landfills were above the landfills’ discharge limits in Malaysia regardless of the landfill type. Ammonical-nitrogen was present in all the landfills and the highest value (880 mg/L) was obtained in the non-active sanitary landfill, whereas concentrations of heavy metals were highest (540 mg/L) in the active sanitary landfill leachate. The <b>acute</b> <b>toxicity</b> test revealed that LC 50 as low as 1 % v/v of the raw leachate was possible and showed that mortality and the corresponding Fish Leachate Toxicity index (FLLTI) decreased in the order of non-active sanitary (5. 46), active sanitary (3. 87), non-active non-sanitary (1. 76) and the active non-sanitary (1. 28) landfills, respectively. Bioaccumulation study revealed that about 3. 2 μg/g and 2. 1 μg/g of Zn and Fe, respectively were found in the fish after exposure to leachate pollution for 96 hours, as against 0. 21 μg/g and 0. 8 μg/g of the same heavy metals obtained in the control experiment (non-exposed fish), respectively. Similarly, tissue analysis of fish showed pale stains on the cellular compartments of the gills and liver. Microbial characterization of the leachate polluted soil indicated that regardless of the toxic effect on the environment, some bacteria species can survive namely Bacillus sp., Pseudomonas sp., Lysinibacillus sp., Rodococcus sp., Acinetobacter sp., Microbacterium sp., Brevundomonas sp., Stenotrophomonas sp., and Flavomonas sp. Bioaugmenting the polluted soil with different treatments (A,B,C) formed from the combination of the microbes showed that the highest heavy metal removal was achieved when Bacillus sp., Lysinibacillus sp. and Rodococcus sp. were combined as compared to other treatments (P < 0. 05). Cu (86 %), Zn (73 %), Pb (70 %), Fe (67 %) and Mn (64 %) were removed after 100 days of biomonitoring. The least heavy metal removal rate constant was observed for Cd (K = 0. 0053 day- 1). Therefore, the study concludes that raw landfill leachate in Malaysia is toxic to these fish species, yet the varied impact of leachate is a reflection of the variation in the heterogeneous nature of leachate across different landfills rather than differences in exposed fish species/types. Also, the use of isolated microbes from leachate contaminated soil to bioaugment the polluted soil is a potential approach for optimal removal of heavy metals from leachate polluted soil...|$|R

This study aimed to assess the toxicological profile of A. [*]aculeata, through <b>acute</b> and subacute <b>toxicity</b> tests. Male and female rats (Wistar) received by gavage 2000 [*]mg/kg of oil extracted from the pulp of A. [*]aculeata (OPAC) for the <b>acute</b> <b>toxicity</b> test and 125, 250, 500 or 1000 [*]mg/kg of OPAC for subacute toxicity test. In the <b>acute</b> <b>toxicity</b> study no mortality or behavioral changes were observed in rats treated with 2000 [*]mg/kg, indicating that the LD 50 is higher than this dose. In the subacute toxicity test, the tested doses produced no significant changes in hematological, biochemical or histopathological parameters in the animals exposed. These results demonstrate the absence of <b>acute</b> and subacute <b>toxicity</b> after oral <b>exposure</b> to A. [*]aculeata oil in rats. However, further studies in animals and in humans are needed in order to have sufficient safety evidence for its use in humans...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{chlorination}} and ozone pre-oxidation on the photobacteria <b>acute</b> <b>toxicity</b> for {{dissolved organic matter}} (DOM) from sewage treatment plants was investigated in this study. The results show that ozone pre-oxidation enhanced the photobacteria <b>acute</b> <b>toxicity</b> of the water samples. DOM before and after ozone pre-oxidation was fractionated by resins into six kinds of hydrophobic and hydrophilic organics. The six fractions were chlorinated individually and the photobacteria <b>acute</b> <b>toxicity</b> before and after chlorination was tested. It {{was found that the}} percentage of hydrophilic organics in DOM significantly increased after ozone pre-oxidation and hydrophilic organics exhibited remarkably higher <b>acute</b> <b>toxicity</b> than hydrophobic organics. In view of potentiometric titration and fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis, the hydrophilic organics showed a rather higher content of ph-OH structures than hydrophobic organics...|$|R
