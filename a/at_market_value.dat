5|$|Britannia {{submitted}} {{an application}} {{to turn the}} fire station into a 227-bed 4-star hotel in June 2010. The Victorian Society praised the proposed conversion. Manchester City Council decided {{to continue with the}} CPO. The city council issued a CPO on 5 August 2010. Despite the plans being approved 16 September 2010, the council continued to pursue a CPO and solicited bids for a development partner in January 2011. Britannia's objection to the CPO led to a public inquiry in April 2011. On 29 November 2011, the Department for Communities and Local Government confirmed the CPO had been rejected. Despite Britannia's guarantee at the inquiry to proceed with the development it reconsidered its plans. In a letter to English Heritage, Britannia said the proposed scheme was unsustainable for the foreseeable future. Britannia wanted to return to the rejected tower plan. English Heritage and the city council expressed disappointment. The city council offered to buy the building <b>at</b> <b>market</b> <b>value.</b>|$|E

500|$|The dollar was {{authorized}} by the Bland–Allison Act. Following {{the passage of the}} 1873 act, mining interests lobbied to restore free silver, which would require the Mint to accept all silver presented to it and return it, struck into coin. Instead, the Bland–Allison Act was passed, which required the Treasury to purchase between two and four million dollars' worth of silver <b>at</b> <b>market</b> <b>value</b> to be coined into dollars each month. In 1890, the Bland–Allison Act was repealed by the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, which required the Treasury to purchase [...] of silver each month, but only required further silver dollar production for one year. This act, once again, was repealed in 1893.|$|E

2500|$|In 1986 Howard Darwin {{sold the}} Knights and the arena to Paris, Ontario {{businessmen}} Jack Robillard, Al Martin and Bob Willson. The trio also owned the Hamilton Steelhawks. The Knights were sold {{for a dollar}} but the London Gardens was sold <b>at</b> <b>market</b> <b>value.</b> The new ownership group modernized the team's logo and renovated the Gardens. Under their stewardship the Knights would go on a run of success. Between 1987 and 1993 the team would finish no lower than third in the Emms Division, including a division title in 1989–90. However, regular season success did not translate into playoff success, as the Knights would never make the league final in these years.|$|E
2500|$|Mortgage {{payments}} from homeowners are deposited into a locally administered [...] "Fund for Humanity", {{the proceeds of}} which go toward future construction. In an effort to discourage predatory lenders from targeting Habitat homeowner families, mortgage agreements require the Habitat for Humanity affiliate the right of first refusal. Until the mortgage is paid in full, a Habitat home has no equity and can only be sold back to Habitat for Humanity. Should a homeowner family decide to sell their home {{during the period of}} their mortgage, the affiliate will buy it back <b>at</b> <b>market</b> <b>value.</b> Often affiliates will have a shared appreciation model that will allow the affiliate to recapture a portion of the equity in the home depending on the time the family lived in the home and paid on the mortgage.|$|E

2500|$|In January 2014, it was {{revealed}} by Fairfax Media that Myer had made a bid to purchase and merge with department store rival David Jones. The merger would have kept both chains operating independently on the surface, combining back-office and supply chain operations saving both companies an estimated 5 billion dollars per year. [...] The 3 billion dollar non-binding indicative proposal was made to the David Jones board of directors in late October 2013, however {{was rejected by the}} board in November 2013. In February 2014, Myer reapproached David Jones, offering to purchase David Jones <b>at</b> <b>market</b> <b>value</b> (estimated to be 1.7 billion). David Jones had not yet commented on the new proposal, when food and clothing retailer, Woolworths South Africa offered to purchase David Jones, by way of a scheme implementation deed, in which shareholders of David Jones would be offered $4-per-share.|$|E
2500|$|The {{allegations}} of preferential allocation of a luxury three-storey penthouse in Shenzhen surfaced after Tsang addressed the press {{by saying that}} he and his wife had chosen to live in Shenzhen for a period after his retirement as they wanted to stay away from the limelight. Tsang was accused for allocating the Shenzhen penthouse owned by Bill Wong Cho-bau to Tsang in exchange for granting of a broadcasting licence to the Wong's Digital Broadcasting Corporation (DBC, then Wave Media). It was reported that Tsang was set to rent the flat at a substantially discounted rate while renovation works, provided by the developer, were tailored to the demands of Tsang's wife. Tsang argued that declaration was not necessary and that his lease did not affect the government's decision on granting the broadcasting licence to DBC. He also argued that the lease was <b>at</b> <b>market</b> <b>value.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) {{also joined}} the bidding {{for the new}} FBI headquarters. WMATA has [...] of land near its Greenbelt Metrorail station in Prince George's County. WMATA {{previously}} {{signed an agreement with}} real estate development company Renard (formerly Metroland Developers) under which the company would develop the empty land (generating property lease income for WMATA). [...] Metro officials proposed amending the agreement to permit Renard and Prince George's County officials to submit the land for consideration by GSA. [...] If the proposal is accepted, Renard would be required to buy the land <b>at</b> <b>market</b> <b>value.</b> Alternatively, Renard could transfer its development rights to Prince George's County, which could then submit a bid. WMATA officials noted that the site is served by Metrorail, and there are 3,700 parking spaces and 17 Metrobus bays at the Greenbelt station. WMATA believed that the federal government would pay to improve Capital Beltway access to (which is currently very limited) and upgrade WMATA facilities at the station (at no cost to the transit agency).|$|E

2500|$|The British {{researchers}} Richard Harris & Stephen Drinkwater also {{highlighted the}} problem that the PIM {{does not account for}} premature scrapping. The reason is that a constant depreciation rate (based on average asset lives) is applied for the stock; a discrepancy therefore arises between depreciated value and scrap value (often statisticians also fail to track what happens to fixed assets that are got rid of, and therefore the assets can be counted twice in the same year). The mathematical problem is that, given a constant depreciation rate, the effect of overstated stock values in the data will increase cumulatively across a series of years, unless a special adjustment is made. Thus, Harris & Drinkwater's 2000 study of fixed capital in British manufacturing 1970–1993 (23 years) found that, if the effect of capital scrapping which occurs due to plant closures is ignored from the 1969 benchmark onward, then this will lead to a 1993 capital stock estimate for plant and machinery which is 44% larger than it is when an appropriate adjustment is made for premature asset disposals. Another depreciation measurement problem is the accelerating replacement of fixed assets, particularly of computer systems, affecting estimated asset lives and therefore average depreciation rates. These two factors alone could, according to a 1997 OECD paper, make a difference of 10% to the estimate of the annual capital stock for some UK industries. Dutch and French statisticians suggested that if capital scrapping is ignored, capital stock results obtained with the PIM could be up to 20% larger than they probably are. New Zealand statisticians acknowledge explicitly that [...] "PIMs may typically overstate the gross capital stock because of a failure to account for changing cyclical or accelerating rates of retirements". Although he is not a Marxist, Thomas Piketty usefully discusses many problems with the PIM. Unlike orthodox classical revolutionary Marxist academics, Piketty and Zucman did not use the PIM method to get a measure of the capital stock, but instead used book values and corporate equity <b>at</b> <b>market</b> <b>value.</b>|$|E

40|$|Mineral assets {{consistently}} trade <b>at</b> <b>market</b> <b>values</b> {{greater than}} their {{discounted cash flow}} (DCF) values. One explanation is that DCF analysis does not and cannot incorporate the asset value generated by asset management under uncertainty. This paper surveys the attempts to empirically quantify the "option premium" associated with optimal mineral asset management. The option premium appears to explain at most half of the observed gap between DCF <b>value</b> and <b>market</b> <b>value,</b> and adds <b>at</b> most 3 percent to a mineral asset's gross worth. Asset management option premiums therefore have only a second-order impact on mineral asset pricing. ...|$|R

50|$|As {{with most}} ratios, it varies {{a fair amount}} by industry.
