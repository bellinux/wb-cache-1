25|$|Insulin {{is a major}} {{regulator}} of endocannabinoid (EC) {{metabolism and}} insulin treatment {{has been shown to}} reduce intracellular ECs, the 2-arachidonylglycerol (2-AG) and anandamide (AEA), which correspond with insulin-sensitive expression changes in enzymes of EC metabolism. In insulin-resistant adipocytes, patterns of insulin-induced enzyme expression is disturbed {{in a manner consistent with}} elevated EC synthesis and reduced EC degradation. Findings suggest that insulin-resistant adipocytes fail to regulate EC metabolism and decrease intracellular EC levels in response to insulin stimulation, whereby obese insulin-resistant individuals exhibit increased concentrations of ECs. This dysregulation contributes to excessive visceral fat accumulation and reduced adiponectin release from <b>abdominal</b> <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue,</b> and further to the onset of several cardiometabolic risk factors that are associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the effects of {{circadian}} rhythm disturbances induced by night-shift activities on the accumulation of <b>abdominal</b> <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> and the morphological characteristics and bone mineral density (BMD) of the trabecular bone in the fourth lumbar vertebrae (L 4). Fourteen 6 -week-old C 57 BL/ 6 male mice were assigned to 2 groups, namely, the normal group (NOR; n = 7) and the night-shift group (NS; n = 7). Mice in the NS group were kept under a light/dark cycle that changed every 3 days. The area of the visceral, subcutaneous, and entire <b>abdominal</b> <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> and the structural parameters and BMD of the trabecular bone in the L 4 were measured at 0 weeks and 4 weeks from images acquired by in vivo micro-computed tomography. At 4 weeks, the area of the visceral <b>abdominal</b> <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> was significantly higher in the NOR group than in the NS group (p 0. 05).

40|$|Objective: We {{sought to}} {{determine}} differences between concentrations of persistent, lipid-soluble chemical contaminants in breast and <b>abdominal</b> <b>adipose</b> <b>tissues</b> and to explore whether concentrations measured in one tissue could predict concentrations in the other tissue. Methods: We analyzed surgical specimens and mea-sured concentrations of prevalent dioxins, furans, poly-chlorinated biphenyls, organochlorine pesticides, and brominated diphenyl ethers to determine their parti-tioning between breast and <b>abdominal</b> <b>adipose</b> <b>tissues</b> of 21 women. The women constituted a subgroup, undergoing mastectomies with simultaneous breast reconstruction, of a case-control study evaluating links between breast cancer and body burdens of organo-halogen contaminants. Results: For every contaminant, differences between concentrations in breast and ab-dominal <b>adipose</b> <b>tissues</b> did not exceed the analytical error. Results indicated that, with some notable excep-tions, measurements in breast and <b>abdominal</b> <b>adipose</b> <b>tissues</b> were correlated and that concentrations of target chemicals in one tissue could be derived from measure-ments in the other tissue. Conclusions: This information will allow comparison of results from body burden studies that used different tissues. It may also facilitate future breast cancer studies by allowing selection of controls among patients undergoing surgical procedures other than breast surgery, minimizing concerns about overmatching. We also observed large differences in the lipid content of surgical specimens. These differences underscore the need for lipid adjustment of concen-trations to avoid misclassification.

40|$|OBJECTIVE—Glucose-dependent insulinotropic {{polypeptide}} (GIP) {{has been}} implicated in lipid metabolism in animals. In humans, however, {{there is no clear}} evidence of GIP effecting lipid metabolism. The present experiments were performed in order to elucidate the effects of GIP on regional <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> metabolism. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—Eight healthy subjects were studied on four different occasions. <b>Abdominal</b> subcutaneous <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> metabolism was assessed by measuring arterio-venous concentration differences and regional <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> blood flow during GIP (1. 5 pmol/kg/min) or saline infused intravenously alone or in combination with a hyperinsulinemichyperglycemic (HI-HG) clamp. RESULTS—During GIP and HI-HG clamp, <b>abdominal</b> subcutaneous <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> blood flow, hydrolysis of circulating triacylglycerol (TAG) (P � 0. 009), and glucose uptake (P � 0. 03) increased significantly while free fatty acid (FFA) output (P � 0. 04) and FFA/glycerol release ratio (P � 0. 02) decreased compared with saline and HI-HG clamp. CONCLUSIONS—In conclusion, GIP in combination with hyperinsulinemia and slight hyperglycemia increased <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> blood flow, glucose uptake, and FFA re-esterification, thus resulting in increased TAG deposition in <b>abdominal</b> subcutaneous <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue.</b> Diabetes 59 : 2160 – 2163, 201...|$|R
40|$|Background—Fatty {{liver disease}} (FLD) is {{characterized}} by increased intrahepatic triglyceride content with or without inflammation and is associated with obesity, and features of the metabolic syndrome. Several recent GWAS have reported an association between SNP rs 738409 in the PNPLA 3 gene and FLD. Liver attenuation (Hounsfield Units, HU) by computed tomography is a non-invasive measure of liver fat, with lower values of HU indicating higher liver fat content.

30|$|The {{necessity}} to optimise and tailor the ATCM technique {{has long been}} recognised in patients with a large body habitus [5]. Such efforts to refine dose and noise index parameters may be of increased importance as new dose reduction technologies such as iterative reconstruction are being used with success in patients with a large body habitus [19, 20]. Weight-based optimisation of ATCM protocols {{has the advantage of}} being easily executed but may not provide an ideal basis to reduce dose as short obese patients may have the same weight as tall thin patients [6]. Our results suggest that quantification of total <b>abdominal</b> <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> could potentially guide radiation dose reduction pathways and facilitate individualised protocols for optimisation of the ATCM protocol, as it appears to be the strongest body composition predictor of dose length product at abdominopelvic CT. This process would be greatly facilitated if robust automated quantification of total <b>abdominal</b> <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> could be performed. A possible approach would be to acquire a single representative abdominal CT section from which an automated quantification of total <b>abdominal</b> <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> could be performed. Another possibility in the case of follow-up or repeat CT studies would be to analyse previous CT scans, to allow quantification of total <b>abdominal</b> <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> and allow protocols to be modelled based on abdominal fat distribution, thereby optimising the dose while preserving image quality. It should be noted that measurement of visceral adipose tissue appears reproducible between various dose reduction and image reconstruction strategies [21].|$|E

Design: Healthy Aboriginal, Chinese, European, and South Asian participants (n 822) aged between 30 and 65 y were matched by sex, ethnicity, and body mass index (BMI; in kg/m 2) range. Total <b>abdominal</b> <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> (TAT), subcutaneous <b>abdominal</b> <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> (SAT), visceral adipose tissue (VAT), total body fat mass, lifestyle, and demographics were assessed. Relations between BMI and total body fat, TAT, SAT, and VAT and between total body fat and TAT, SAT, and VAT were investigated. Results: BMI significantly underestimated VAT in all non-European groups. Throughout a range of total body fat mass, VAT was not significantly different between the Aboriginals and the Eu-ropeans. With total body fat 9. 1 kg, Chinese participants had increasingly greater amounts of VAT than did the Europeans (P for interaction 0. 008).

Therefore, this cross-sectional study analyzed the relationship between thickness of <b>abdominal</b> <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> and bone mineral variables in sedentary obese children and adolescents. Methods: One hundred and seventy five obese children and adolescents (83 male and 92 female) with ages ranging from 6 to 16 years-old were analyzed.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Combination {{antiretroviral}} therapy (cART) {{is associated}} with lipodystrophy, i. e., loss of subcutaneous <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> in the abdomen, limbs, and face and its accumulation intra-abdominally. No fat is lost dorsocervically and it can even accumulate in this region (buffalo hump). It is unknown how preserved dorsocervical fat differs from abdominal subcutaneous fat in HIV- 1 -infected cART-treated patients with (cART+LD+) and without (cART+LD-) lipodystrophy. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used histology, microarray, PCR, and magnetic resonance imaging to compare dorsocervical and <b>abdominal</b> subcutaneous <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> in cART+LD+ (n= 21) and cART+LD- (n= 11). RESULTS: Albeit dorsocervical <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> in cART+LD+ seems spared from lipoatrophy, its mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA; copies/cell) content was significantly lower (by 62 %) {{than that of the}} corresponding tissue in cART+LD-. Expression of CD 68 mRNA, a marker of macrophages, and numerous inflammatory genes in microarray were significantly lower in dorsocervical versus <b>abdominal</b> subcutaneous <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue.</b> Genes with the greatest difference in expression between the two depots were those involved in regulation of transcription and regionalization (homeobox genes), irrespective of lipodystrophy status. There was negligible mRNA expression of uncoupling protein 1, a gene characteristic of brown <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue,</b> in either depot. CONCLUSIONS: Because mtDNA is depleted even in the nonatrophic dorsocervical <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue,</b> {{it is unlikely that the}} cause of lipoatrophy is loss of mtDNA.

Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) has been proposed as a potential method of determining individual abdominal fat compartments {{in the form of}} the commercially available ViScan measurement system (Tanita Corporation), but it has yet to be independently validated. The objective of this study was to analyse the validity of the ViScan to assess adult abdominal adiposity across a range of body fatness. Subjects/Methods: This was a cross-sectional study with 74 participants (40 females and 34 males with body mass index (BMI) between 18. 5 and 39. 6 ?kg/m 2). Total <b>abdominal</b> <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue,</b> subcutaneous <b>abdominal</b> <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> (SAAT) and intra-abdominal adipose tissue (IAAT) were measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In addition, intra-hepatocellular lipid was obtained by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Estimates of abdominal adiposity (total and compartmental) were obtained from BIA and anthropometry. Results: ViScan-derived percentage trunk fat strongly and significantly related with total <b>abdominal</b> <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> and SAAT in both lean and overweight/obese individuals, and categorized individuals reliably in terms of total abdominal fat. ViScan-derived ‘visceral’ fat correlated significantly with IAAT but the strength of this relationship was much weaker in overweight/obese individuals, particularly those with higher SAAT, leading to less reliable classification of individuals for IAAT.

The purposes were: (1) to follow the alterations in regional body adiposity during genital development; (2) to reveal the differences in fat patterning of athletes and non-athletes, (3) to analyze the influence of genital maturation and sport activity on the indices of fatness in pubertal boys. The subjects were athlete (n= 803) and non-athlete (n= 989) boys. They were grouped by the stages of genital development. Regional fat distribution was examined {{on the basis of}} skinfolds. The amount of subcutaneous and visceral <b>abdominal</b> <b>adipose</b> <b>tissues</b> was assessed by regression equations of Brambilla and co-workers. The effect of genital development and sport activity on fat compartments was studied by multivariate ANOVA. The centralization tendency in <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> was revealed by the progressing of genital development. Non-athletes accumulated more relative subcutaneous fat on their extremities, while athletes did it on their trunk. Adjusted to the absolute body fat mass, visceral <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> increased faster in athletes than in non-athletes. The multivariate model proved that genital maturation affected the regional fat distribution. During sexual maturation the regional apposition trend of body fat was similar for athletes and non-athletes. The differences between athletes’ and non-athletes’ fat pattering emerged in the relative distributions. The relatively thicker fat layer on the trunk served better the extended energy supply for athletes. The effect of sexual maturation was the largest on the visceral <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue,</b> while sport activity influenced the subcutaneous <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> better on the extremities...|$|R
40|$|Through posttranscriptional gene regulation, microRNA (miRNA) {{is linked}} {{to a wide variety}} of {{biological}} processes, including adipogenesis and lipid metabolism. Although miRNAs in mammalian adipogenesis have been worked on extensively, their study in chicken adipo-genesis is still very limited. To find miRNAs potentially important for chicken preadipocyte development, we compared the preadipocyte miRNA expression profiles in two broiler lines divergently selected for abdominal fat content, by sequencing two small RNA libraries con-structed for primary preadipocytes isolated from <b>abdominal</b> <b>adipose</b> <b>tissues.</b> After bioinfor-matics analyses, from chicken miRNAs deposited in miRBase 20. 0, we identified 225 miRNAs to be expressed in preadipocytes, 185 in the lean line and 200 in the fat line (de-rived from 208 and 203 miRNA precursors, respectively), which corresponds to 114 miRNA families. The let- 7 family miRNAs were the most abundant. Furthermore, we validated the sequencing results of 15 known miRNAs by qRT-PCR, and confirmed that the expression levels of most miRNAs correlated well with those of Solexa sequencing. A total of 33 miR-NAs was significantly differentially expressed between the two chicken lines (P< 0. 05) ...|$|R
40|$|MicroRNAs {{are small}} non-coding RNAs {{that have been}} shown {{to play a role in}} <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> biology. <b>Adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> depots differ in terms of the {{metabolic}} risk that they confer. Therefore, I aimed to identify microRNAs which regulate body fat distribution. An initial microarray screen of abdominal subcutaneous and gluteal <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue,</b> with validatory qPCR, identified microRNA- 196 a as being more highly expressed in gluteal <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue.</b> These expression patterns were retained in primary and immortalised pre-adipocytes from abdominal subcutaneous and gluteal <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue.</b> The precursor of miR- 196 a contains a single nucleotide polymorphism, rs 11614913. Genotyping was performed on 5, 823 individuals from the Oxford Biobank and combined with detailed information on body composition by DXA scanning and miR- 196 a expression determination in fat biopsies. This revealed that the rs 11614913 TT genotype was associated with a 32 % reduction in miR- 196 a expression in <b>abdominal</b> subcutaneous <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> (p= 0. 002), an expansion in waist-to-hip ratio and an increase in mean adipocyte size in <b>abdominal</b> subcutaneous <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> in males. RS 11614913 was also found to be associated with bone mineral density, and the relationship between bone mineral density and body fat distribution was explored using the Oxford Biobank. To establish a functional role for miR- 196 a, the Pt 2 abdominal and gluteal cell lines were validated as models for pre-adipocyte proliferation and adipogenesis. MiR- 196 aKO pre-adipocyte cell lines were generated. MiR- 196 aKO was found to reduce proliferation in abdominal subcutaneous (p= 0. 002) and gluteal (p= 0. 002) pre-adipocytes, with no effect in adipogenesis. In addition, transcriptomic profiling of miR- 196 aKO pre-adipocytes revealed enrichment for GO term clusters related to extracellular matrix and angiogenesis, suggesting a mechanism by which miR- 196 a might regulate regional <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> expansion...|$|R
40|$|Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are {{abundant}} and persistent environmental contaminants, {{which tend to}} accumulate through the food chain. Because of the toxic potential of these compounds, body burden should be kept {{as low as possible}} e. g. by taking dietary measures. In the present report, the effect of wheat bran consumption on absorption of dietary PCBs as well as on excretion of previously absorbed PCBs was investigated in rats. Moreover, the accumulation of 7 reference PCB congeners in liver and <b>abdominal</b> <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> was studied. Faecal excretion of dietary PCBs was significantly higher in rats fed wheat bran compared to its placebo. As a result, apparent PCB digestibility was diminished, but not enough to significantly affect PCB accumulation in liver and <b>abdominal</b> <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue.</b> Furthermore, excretion of previously absorbed PCBs following switching of the rats to a control diet without added PCBs was enhanced by wheat bran fibre intake, although to a much lesser extent than excretion of PCBs originating directly from the diet. Consequently, stimulation of PCB clearance from liver and <b>abdominal</b> <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> due to wheat bran consumption was not detectable. Although no preferential absorption of PCB congeners was observed, PCB patterns in tissues obviously differed from the dietary PCB pattern. This was mainly due to PCBs 52 and 101, which were metabolised in the body. Moreover, reduced levels of PCB 138 were found in liver, while PCB 28 and 138 were predominantly present in adipose tissue. The experiment also demonstrated that PCB redistribution from the liver to the adipose tissue occurs. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|E

California State University, Los Angeles, 2011 Committee members: Chick Tam, Pera Jambazian, Nazareth KhodiguianBreakfast, Breakfast Skipping, Childhood, Intra <b>Abdominal</b> <b>Adipose</b> <b>Tissue,</b> Obesity, Visceral FatRecent {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that breakfast skipping is associated with obesity. We aim to ascertain whether breakfast intake is associated with adiposity, specifically intra <b>abdominal</b> <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> (IAAT), in youth. This cross sectional study investigated breakfast consumption patterns in 93 overweight Latino youth (10 - 17 years) with a family history of type 2 diabetes. Dietary intake was determined by two 24 -hour recalls, body composition by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, insulin dynamics by a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test, and IAAT by magnetic resonance imaging. Breakfast skipping was associated with increased IAAT (P = 0. 003) independent of daily energy intake, total body fat, total body lean tissue mass, sex, age and Tanner. There {{were no significant differences in}} insulin dynamics or any other adiposity measure between breakfast categories. Breakfast consumption is associated with lower visceral fat in overweight Latino youth. We recommend further studies on breakfast omission and adiposity...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE—Combination {{antiretroviral}} therapy (cART) {{is associated}} with lipodystrophy, i. e., loss of subcutaneous <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> in the abdomen, limbs, and face and its accumulation intra-abdominally. No fat is lost dorsocervically and it can even accumulate in this region (buffalo hump). It is unknown how preserved dorsocervical fat differs from abdominal subcutaneous fat in HIV- 1 –infected cART-treated patients with (cART+LD+) and without (cART+LD 2) lipodystrophy.
