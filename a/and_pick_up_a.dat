Westerby tells Ricardo that Nelson was the package. Ricardo tries to kill Westerby again, using a delayed-action hand grenade in the fuel tank of his hired car; Westerby smells a rat and safely watches the car explode.|$|E
25|$|While being {{deported}} to the U.S., Abagnale escaped from a British VC-10 airliner {{as it was}} turning onto a taxiway at New York's JFK International Airport. Under cover of night, he scaled a nearby fence and hailed a cab to Grand Central Terminal. After stopping in The Bronx to change clothes <b>and</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> set of keys to a Montreal bank safe deposit box containing $20,000, Abagnale caught a train to Montreal's Dorval airport to purchase a ticket to São Paulo, Brazil. After a close call at a Mac's Milk, he was apprehended by a constable of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police while standing {{in line at the}} ticket counter. Abagnale was subsequently handed over to the U.S. Border Patrol.|$|E

500|$|James Plath of Movie Metropolis {{also found}} the {{characters}} lacking in the first half, but noted that in the second half, the characters of Lasky and Silva [...] "actually move beyond the clichés <b>and</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> personality along the way". Plath {{was impressed by the}} soundtrack, thinking it [...] "worthy of any big-screen action flick" [...] and also complimented the special effects saying [...] "the CGI work is enhanced by high definition, not exposed by it." [...] Overall however, he thought that despite the action being exciting, the [...] "pedestrian" [...] first half and [...] "only adequate acting" [...] would prevent Forward Unto Dawn appealing to an audience beyond existing gamers.|$|E
500|$|Montoya {{admitted}} to feeling disappointed after the race, having been leading until his only pit stop on lap 22. He stated: [...] "I am so disappointed I cannot {{find the words}} to describe how I feel. Up to the pit stop the race was going perfectly for me." [...] Williams technical director Patrick Head was {{not happy with the}} refulling rigs supplied by the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). One of the rigs was sent back to manufacturer Intertechnique who said they could not find any issues with the system. Michael Schumacher, placed fourth before his retirement from a fuel pressure problem on lap 23, shared similar feelings to Montoya: [...] "I am not too disappointed as the situation in the championship remains the same and there is one less race to go. It was a shame not to finish the race <b>and</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> further six points." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the age of}} 17, O'Hara {{was offered}} her first major role at the Abbey Theatre, but was distracted by the attentions of actor-singer Harry Richman. Richman {{arranged}} with {{the manager of the}} Gresham Hotel in Dublin to meet her at the hotel while she was dining with her family. He proposed that she go to Elstree Studios for a screen test and become a film actress. O'Hara arrived in London shortly afterwards with her mother. During the screen test, the studio adorned her in a [...] "gold lamé dress with flapping sleeves like wings" [...] and heavy makeup with an ornate hair style, which was deemed to be far from satisfactory. O'Hara detested the audition, during which she had to walk in <b>and</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> telephone. She recalled thinking to herself, [...] "My God, get me back to the Abbey". Charles Laughton later saw the test and, despite the overdone makeup and costume, was intrigued, paying particular notice to her large and expressive eyes. After seeking the approval of his business partner Erich Pommer, they arranged to meet O'Hara through a talent agency run by Connie Chapman and Vere Barker. Laughton was impressed with O'Hara, particularly by her lack of nerves and refusal to read an extract upon his request unprepared, during which she said: [...] "I am very sorry but absolutely no". She was offered an initial seven-year contract with their new company, Mayflower Pictures. Though her family were shocked at her being given a contract so young, they accepted, and O'Hara traveled across Ireland in celebration before arriving back in London to commence her film career. O'Hara later stated that [...] "I owe my whole career to Mr. Pommer".|$|E

500|$|Discussing {{the season}} finale, Tancharoen stated, [...] "This season, we've {{explored}} {{a lot of}} different themes: There's the notion of purpose. We also introduced an Inhuman who has a strong sense of faith. We talk a lot about destiny and all these things intertwine." [...] Bennet likened {{the end of the season}} to [...] "the end of the first book of S.H.I.E.L.D. This finale feels like the end of something bigger and the beginning of a whole new tone for the show." [...] Whedon added, [...] "We wanted to put a close to [...] story. We knew going into this season what our plan was for both Ward and Hive. Our goal was to make it not just feel like victory—we like to get a victory and also a loss at the same time." [...] On whether the Inhumans storyline would also be ending with the season, Whedon said, [...] "We think of it as never closed. We like that we were able to open up that world and make Inhumans a permanent part of the universe. Now, we have a quick-fire way of introducing people with powers. It gives us a lot of leeway in our world, and it lets us explode the metaphors of what it is like to be different. We will never close that chapter." [...] On making a six-month time jump at the end of [...] "Ascension", Bell said that despite each character completing their arcs this season, [...] "we still have a lot of plot. Emotionally, their arcs are done. What the jump lets you do is to do a reset ... It allows us to put down a lot of old plot <b>and</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> lot of new." [...] Whedon added, [...] "We’ve done it each season, so we just wanted to do it a little early ... we would’ve done [...] in episode 1 next year but what we wanted to do was tease" [...] things to come at the end of this season.|$|E

Lapwing was {{carrying}} 25 tons of lead, 50 chests of [...] "treasure" [...] and [...] "a recruit of soldiers". Around 15 May 1747 Lapwing was to sail from Madras via Sumatra, {{where she was}} to deliver 200 bales (probably broadcloth, but type unspecified, hence understood), <b>and</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> full cargo of pepper.|$|E

2500|$|Cricket in the 1860s {{underwent}} {{an evolutionary}} phase with the legalisation of overarm bowling in June 1864 and Grace himself {{said it was}} [...] "no exaggeration to say that, between 1860 and 1870, English cricket passed through its most critical period" [...] with the game in transition and [...] "it was quite a revolutionary period so far as its rules were concerned". Grace had {{much to say about}} the state of the grounds in the 1860s and declared that Lord's [...] "was in a very unsatisfactory condition". He added that wickets at The Oval were always much better than at Lord's, where the clay in the soil handicapped the groundsmen. Writing in 1899, Grace recollected that he [...] "could go on to the pitch at Lord's <b>and</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> handful of small pieces of gravel"; a source of danger as a fast ball hitting one of those small stones would [...] "fly high in the air".|$|E
2500|$|Van Persie {{opened his}} 2008–09 account on 31 August with a brace in Arsenal's 3–0 league victory over Newcastle United. On 29 October, he scored his fiftieth career Arsenal goal in a 4–4 home draw with North London derby rivals Tottenham, but {{was hit with}} his first red card of the season on 1 November after {{knocking}} down goalkeeper Thomas Sørensen with a shoulder charge in a 2–1 loss to Stoke City. Sørensen later admitted to [...] "teasing" [...] van Persie {{in an attempt to}} provoke a reaction. On 30 November, he scored a brace against Chelsea to help Arsenal come from behind <b>and</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> 2–1 victory at Stamford Bridge. On 21 December 2008, he scored a spectacular goal against Liverpool, which was later named the second BBC Goal of the Month of his career. With captain Cesc Fàbregas injured and regular stand-in skipper Manuel Almunia rested, van Persie captained Arsenal {{for the first time on}} 3 January 2009 for the club's 3–1 FA Cup Third Round victory over Plymouth Argyle. Van Persie scored Arsenal's first and third goals, while the second was a result of his cross being deflected into the net by a Plymouth player for an own goal.|$|E
2500|$|After {{hiding out}} {{for nearly a}} week, Duane Peak was arrested for the crime on August 28. [...] In his first {{statement}} to police, without having consulted an attorney, Peak {{said that there was}} an envelope for him at NCCF headquarters on Sunday, August 16. Inside, a note told him to go in back of the Lothrop Drug store <b>and</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> suitcase, which he did before 5 p.m. He was instructed to take the suitcase to an address near 28th and Ohio at 11 p.m. that night and leave it on the field side of a fence. The note told him to go to a particular payphone before 2 a.m. and wait for a phone call. The phone rang and a woman's voice told him to call 911 and report a woman dragged into 2867 Ohio. The police report indicates that he admitted to placing the 911 call. Peak implicated neither Rice nor Poindexter in his first statement. [...] There are no police reports for August 29 or August 30, so it is unknown who talked to him over the weekend, though in his February 4, 1971 deposition, Peak said that Lt. James Perry interrogated him several times over that weekend. On Monday, August 31, Peak told the County Attorney Art O'Leary in a deposition, that Poindexter had made the bomb at Rice's house, told him to plant it, and then lure the police to the vacant house with an anonymous 911 call. (Peak allegedly carried a suitcase bomb with a clothespin triggering device into three vehicles and to two different residences from 5 p.m. to 11 p.m. that day, at one point putting it in the trunk of a car because there were seven passengers in the car including his two small nieces.) ATF Agent Tom Sledge, brother of the Omaha police officer assigned to the call, was present during Peak's deposition, as were two Omaha Police officers, Bill Coleman and Pitmon Foxall and Peak's attorney, Tom Carey, although Peak had to ask the County Attorney who Carey was.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the end of}} August 1937, the Japanese {{military}} restricted foreigners from {{crossing the}} Garden Bridge: [...] "There is much local criticism of the Japanese naval authorities who, still persist in their refusals to permit foreigners to cross the Garden Bridge." [...] After August 1937 the Waibaidu Bridge was the de facto border between the International Settlement and Japanese occupied Hongkew (now Hongkou) and Zhabei. As Mark Gayn recalls: [...] "The creek became the boundary between two worlds. To the north was the world of fear, death, and the Japanese bayonet. To the south, law was still supreme and life remained as normal {{as it could be}} with bombs exploding....Of all the bridges, the Garden Bridge alone remained open to traffic, and on its narrow roadway the two hostile worlds met and glared at each other." [...] The west end of Garden Bridge, was guarded by members of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps. Harold Rattenbury recalls: [...] "Japanese and Scottish sentries face one another on the Garden Bridge. To the Japanese all Chinese must remove their hats; so I took pleasure in removing mine to our Scottish sentries also." [...] Kemp Tolley indicates: [...] "A Japanese sentry stood on the Garden Bridge, over odoriferous Soochow Creek, which separated Honkew {{from the rest of the}} International Settlement. Foreigners were expected, on pain of a possible slap in the face, to bow gently from the waist when passing the sentry. Chinese coolies grunted, groaned and yei-hoed, pushing heavily loaded carts up the bridge's steep approaches. An occasional bayonet thrust into a bale or a prick in some tender part of a coolie's anatomy reminded everyone who was boss. Although Honkew was a part of the International Settlement, the Settlement taxis and rickshaws were not allowed there. One had to hire a ramshackle vehicle especially licensed — or walk across the bridge, bowing en route, <b>and</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> conveyance in Japanese [...] "territory." ...|$|E
