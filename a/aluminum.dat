5|$|<b>Aluminum</b> {{chloride}} may {{be formed}} via a single displacement reaction between copper chloride and <b>aluminum</b> metal.|$|E
5|$|Inexpensive {{hydropower}} {{supported the}} location of a large <b>aluminum</b> industry in the region, because its reduction from bauxite requires large amounts of electricity. Until 2000, the Northwestern United States produced up to 17percent of the world's <b>aluminum</b> and 40percent of the <b>aluminum</b> produced in the United States. The commoditization of power in the early 21st century, coupled with drought that reduced the generation capacity of the river, damaged the industry and by 2001, Columbia River <b>aluminum</b> producers had idled 80percent of its production capacity. By 2003, the entire United States produced only 15percent of the world's <b>aluminum,</b> and many smelters along the Columbia had gone dormant or out of business.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} of the monument proceeded quickly after Congress had provided sufficient funding. In four years, it was completed, with the 100-ounce (2.83kg) <b>aluminum</b> apex/lightning-rod being put in place on December 6, 1884. The apex was the largest single piece of <b>aluminum</b> cast at the time, when <b>aluminum</b> commanded a price comparable to silver. Two years later, the Hall–Héroult process made <b>aluminum</b> easier to produce {{and the price of}} <b>aluminum</b> plummeted, making the once-valuable apex more ordinary, though it still provided a lustrous, non-rusting apex that served as the original lightning rod. The monument opened to the public on October 9, 1888.|$|E
5|$|Above Little Nescopeck Creek B, Nescopeck Creek's iron {{concentration}} is 110 micrograms per liter and the creek's <b>aluminum</b> {{concentration is}} 40 micrograms per liter. Below Little Nescopeck Creek B, however, these values increase to 1260 micrograms per liter for iron and 7450 micrograms per liter for <b>aluminum.</b>|$|E
5|$|As a lobbyist, Romney {{frequently}} competed {{on behalf}} of the <b>aluminum</b> industry against the copper industry, and defended Alcoa against charges of being a monopoly. He also represented the <b>Aluminum</b> Wares Association. In the early 1930s, he helped get <b>aluminum</b> windows installed in the U.S. Department of Commerce Building, at the time the largest office building in the world.|$|E
5|$|In 1886 Ohio-native Charles Martin Hall helped pioneer the Hall–Héroult process, {{which made}} <b>aluminum</b> {{inexpensive}} to produce. He sold his share in 1888 to the Pittsburgh Reduction Company, {{known today as}} Alcoa. Alcoa has operations in the state, including facilities in Cleveland which manufacture <b>aluminum</b> wheels for Automobili Lamborghini.|$|E
5|$|In {{most places}} on Fishing Creek, {{there is not}} enough {{dissolved}} <b>aluminum</b> to be toxic, although East Branch Fishing Creek has <b>aluminum</b> concentrations of over 100μg per liter, approaching a lethal level for fish. Fishing Creek itself and all its other tributaries have concentrations of less than 70μg per liter. The concentration is seasonal: <b>aluminum</b> trapped in frozen ground is released into the streams when the soil thaws. As a result, <b>aluminum</b> levels in the creek peak in March and April and drop to almost zero in the summer.|$|E
5|$|MD32 was reconstructed and widened from Sykesville to Eldersburg {{starting}} in 1957 and from West Friendship to {{just south of}} Sykesville in 1958. The state highway's bypass of Sykesville was completed in 1963; the old road {{through the center of}} Sykesville became MD851. MD32's new bridge across the Patapsco River was the longest of only three <b>aluminum</b> triangular box beam girder bridges constructed in the United States. The girder system was topped by a concrete slab deck and underlain with standard concrete abutments and piers and steel bearing pads on which the <b>aluminum</b> girders rested. These bridges, which were designed by Fairchild Engine and Airplane Company, were constructed of <b>aluminum</b> due to that metal's light weight but similar strength compared to steel. Many experimental <b>aluminum</b> bridges were built due to a severe shortage of steel in the early 1960s. <b>Aluminum</b> bridges are rarely constructed because they are much more expensive than steel and concrete bridges.|$|E
5|$|Since the Pioneer Zephyr {{was built}} of {{stainless}} steel, {{which is not}} as recyclable as <b>aluminum,</b> the train was spared from the metal recycling drives of World War II. By contrast, Union Pacific's M-10000, built of <b>aluminum,</b> was scrapped in 1942 for the war effort, among other reasons.|$|E
5|$|The {{municipality}} is {{also one}} of the nine largest iron and steel centres in China and one of the three major <b>aluminum</b> producers. Important manufacturers include Chongqing Iron and Steel Company and South West <b>Aluminum,</b> Asia's largest <b>aluminum</b> plant. Manufacturing industries are supported by abundant natural resources including large deposits of coal, natural gas, and more than 40 kinds of minerals such as strontium and manganese. Coal reserves amount to approximately 4.8 billion tonnes, while Chuandong Natural Gas Field is China's largest inland gas field with deposits of around 270 billion m³ - more than 1/5 of China's total.|$|E
5|$|After the war Matthais went to Brazil, {{where he}} helped build a {{hydroelectric}} facility. He joined the <b>Aluminum</b> Company of Canada (Alcan) in 1951, and {{was involved in}} the construction of its Kemano-Kitimat hydroelectric dam and <b>aluminum</b> smelter project in northern British Columbia and the Chute-des-Passes project in Quebec. He was a vice president at Kaiser Engineering from 1960 to 1973.|$|E
5|$|At the USGS {{gauging station}} on Kettle Creek, the {{concentration}} of iron is 0.15 milligrams per liter, {{the concentration of}} manganese is 0.04 milligrams per liter, and the concentration of <b>aluminum</b> is 0.14 milligrams per liter. The acidity concentration is 0.64 milligrams per liter and the concentration of alkalinity is 11.36 milligrams per liter. At the mouth of Twomile Run, the concentration of iron is 5.09 milligrams per liter, the concentration of manganese is 6.44 milligrams per liter, and the <b>aluminum</b> concentration is 8.57 milligrams per liter. The concentration of acidity is 90.5 milligrams per liter {{and there is no}} alkalinity.|$|E
5|$|At these sites, {{the study}} also found averages of 1.7, 2.23, and 5.56 parts per million of <b>aluminum,</b> respectively. Concentrations of {{aluminium}} higher than 100 to 200 parts per million can cause suffocation of fish by accumulating in their gills. The toxicity of <b>aluminum</b> to fish is increased by a water pH of below 4.5 to 6.5. There were also 0.65, 0.81, and 1.84 parts per million of iron in these sites, and 0.96, 1.15, 0.03, and 2.65 parts per million of manganese. There were 91.37, 114.27, and 274.1 milligrams per liter of sulfates {{in the waters of}} Nescopeck at these sites.|$|E
5|$|Bismuth was {{purchased}} from the American Smelting and Refining Company {{of the highest}} purity that it could produce. It was sent to Hanford, where it was put in <b>aluminum</b> cans, and placed inside a reactor for 100 days. The canned slugs then shipped to Unit IV, where they were bathed in hydrochloric acid, which dissolved the <b>aluminum.</b> This formed an <b>aluminum</b> chloride solution that was disposed of, as it was highly radioactive due to iron and copper in the <b>aluminum</b> alloy. The bismuth slugs were then dissolved in aqua regia. This was too weak for electroplating the polonium, so the nitric acid was removed, and then the polonium deposited on bismuth by adding powdered bismuth. This resulted in a 100–1 concentration. This could then be repeated by dissolving in aqua regia again to achieve a 1000–1 concentration. This was again dissolved, and the polonium electroplated on platinum foils. The main problem with the process was that it required glass-lined containers due to the aqua regia, and mechanisms for safe handling of the radioactive material. The Dayton Project explored alternative purification methods that {{were found to be}} workable, but less efficient or safe.|$|E
5|$|For thin materials, Cold Metal Transfer (CMT) {{is used by}} {{reducing}} the current when a short circuit is registered, producing many drops per second. CMT {{can be used for}} <b>aluminum.</b>|$|E
5|$|Gary Klein, born , {{attended}} the University of California at Davis before transferring to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). During the Independent Activities Period in 1973, {{a group of}} students including Klein worked together under Professor Buckley to produce an <b>aluminum</b> framed bicycle. After analyzing a number of contemporary steel frames, and examining ones that had broken in use, they were able to determine the stresses placed on a bicycle frame. Faced with limited available types of <b>aluminum</b> alloy tubing, the students chose to construct frames from 6061 aluminium alloy seamless drawn tube; alternatives such as the stronger 7075 <b>aluminum</b> alloy were discarded because of the tubing dimensions.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, MDSHA {{discovered}} the bridge's rarity while conducting a bridge inventory. The inventory also found premature deterioration of its supports due to galvanic corrosion involving the steel bearing pads and <b>aluminum</b> girder structure. Because repairing the structure {{would have been}} extremely difficult, MDSHA decided to build a replacement bridge immediately {{to the west of}} the <b>aluminum</b> bridge; the new bridge opened in 2004 along with a slight relocation in MD32 on both sides of the bridge. The <b>aluminum</b> bridge was added to the state's Historic Bridge Registry and was left in place as a historic landmark after MD32's new bridge over the Patapsco River opened.|$|E
5|$|Iron is a {{byproduct}} of burning a mixture of <b>aluminum</b> powder and rust powder.|$|E
5|$|Metallic lithium and its complex hydrides, such as Li, {{are used}} as high-energy {{additives}} to rocket propellants. Lithium <b>aluminum</b> hydride {{can also be used}} by itself as a solid fuel.|$|E
5|$|Nothing {{remains of}} the {{original}} dome built by Abd al-Malik. The present-day dome was built by az-Zahir and consists of wood plated with lead enamelwork. In 1969, the dome was reconstructed in concrete and covered with anodized <b>aluminum,</b> instead of the original ribbed lead enamel work sheeting. In 1983, the <b>aluminum</b> outer covering was replaced with lead to match the original design by az-Zahir.|$|E
5|$|Plumbing and wiring {{were covered}} with {{protective}} insulation. <b>Aluminum</b> tubing was replaced with stainless steel tubing that used brazed joints when possible.|$|E
5|$|Pure {{tungsten}} electrodes (classified as WP or EWP) are {{general purpose}} and low cost electrodes. They have poor heat resistance and electron emission. They find limited use in AC welding of e.g. magnesium and <b>aluminum.</b>|$|E
5|$|Several {{paramagnetic}} crystal salts of dysprosium (Dysprosium Gallium Garnet, DGG; Dysprosium <b>Aluminum</b> Garnet, DAG; Dysprosium Iron Garnet, DyIG) {{are used}} in adiabatic demagnetization refrigerators.|$|E
5|$|Some of the {{aforementioned}} compounds, as well as lithium perchlorate, are used in oxygen candles that supply submarines with oxygen. These can also include small amounts of boron, magnesium, <b>aluminum,</b> silicon, titanium, manganese, and iron.|$|E
5|$|The F-16 was {{designed}} to be relatively inexpensive to build and simpler to maintain than earlier-generation fighters. The airframe is built with about 80% aviation-grade <b>aluminum</b> alloys, 8% steel, 3% composites, and 1.5% titanium. The leading-edge flaps, stabilators, and ventral fins make use of bonded <b>aluminum</b> honeycomb structures and graphite epoxy lamination coatings. The number of lubrication points, fuel line connections, and replaceable modules is significantly lower than predecessors; 80% of access panels can be accessed without stands. The air intake was placed so it was rearward of the nose but forward enough to minimize air flow losses and reduce aerodynamic drag.|$|E
5|$|The Hall XPTBH was a {{prototype}} American twin-engined seaplane, {{submitted to the}} United States Navy by the Hall <b>Aluminum</b> Aircraft Corporation {{in response to a}} 1934 specification for new bomber and scout aircraft. Constructed in an innovative fashion that made extensive use of <b>aluminum,</b> the XPTBH proved successful in flight testing, but failed to win favor with the U.S. Navy. No production contract was awarded, and the single aircraft built served in experimental duties before its destruction in a hurricane during 1938.|$|E
5|$|The design used a {{thin layer}} of <b>aluminum</b> to protect the uranium from {{corrosion}} by the cooling water. Cylindrical uranium slugs with <b>aluminum</b> jackets would be pushed through channels through the reactor and drop out the other side into a cooling pond. Once the radioactivity subsided, the slugs would be taken away and the plutonium extracted. After reviewing the two designs, the DuPont engineers chose the water-cooled one. In 1959 a patent for the reactor design would be issued in the name of Creutz, Ohlinger, Weinberg, Wigner, and Young.|$|E
5|$|The iron, manganese, and <b>aluminum</b> {{concentrations}} at {{the mouth}} of Butler Hollow are 1.68, 16.9, and 15.05 milligrams per liter, respectively. The concentration of acidity is 121.28 milligrams per liter and the alkalinity concentration is 0. At the mouth of Kettle Creek, the iron concentration is 0.15 milligrams per liter and the manganese concentration is 0.07 milligrams per liter. <b>Aluminum</b> occurs in concentrations of 0.15 milligrams per liter {{at the mouth}} of the creek. The concentration of acidity and alkalinity are 1.65 and 11.17 milligrams per liter, respectively.|$|E
5|$|The red-colored <b>aluminum</b> unisex {{bicycles}} {{have three}} gears, an adjustable seat, and a front basket {{as well as}} a headlight and twin red taillights that are powered whenever the bicycle is in motion.|$|E
5|$|This trend {{continued}} {{and increases in}} the production of hydroelectric power are directly related to industrial development. In 2005, Landsvirkjun produced 7,143 GWh of electricity total of which 6,676 GWh or 93% was produced via hydroelectric power plants. Additionally 5,193 GWh or 72% was used for power-intensive industries like <b>aluminum</b> smelting. In 2009 Iceland built its biggest hydroelectric project to date, a 690 MW hydroelectric plant to provide energy for another <b>aluminum</b> smelter — the Kárahnjúkar Hydropower Plant. This project was opposed strongly by environmentalists.|$|E
5|$|A more {{expensive}} black model was offered until {{the introduction of}} the unibody <b>aluminum</b> MacBook. The polycarbonate MacBook was the only Macintosh notebook (until the new 2015 model) to be offered in more than one color since the iBook G3 (Clamshell).|$|E
5|$|Anions in {{the waters}} of the Black Creek {{drainage}} basin include sulfate and bicarbonate. The concentrations of <b>aluminum</b> in the mine pools in the area are typically very low or nonexistent. However, some mine waters {{in the waters}}hed can have <b>aluminum</b> ion concentrations of over 70 milligrams per liter, forming 6 percent of total dissolved solids in the water, as measured by weight. The concentration of manganese ions in the waters can be over 100 milligrams per liter and calcium also occurs in groundwater in the watershed. Magnesium occurs in the non-polluted groundwater in the watershed in concentrations of 1 to 5 milligrams per liter and occurs in polluted groundwater at concentrations of 4 to 440 milligrams per liter.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1947, Johnson {{returned}} to Reynolds. In 1950, {{he became a}} member of the company's board of directors. In this capacity, he organized meetings of sales executives and traveled extensively to promote the company's <b>aluminum</b> products. He retired from Reynolds in January 1961.|$|E
5|$|Robin Lynn Johnson {{was born}} in Vancouver, Washington in 1947 to Vera and Donald Johnson, a manager of an <b>aluminum</b> plant. She has two sisters, Karen Freeze and Deborah Johnson. She {{graduated}} from high school in Longview, Washington in 1965.|$|E
5|$|Seeking {{alternatives}} to the difficult-to-work copper-nickel alloy, in June 1867 Longacre proposed that the five-cent piece be struck in <b>aluminum.</b> The new Mint director, Henry Linderman, objected to the proposal, stating that the price and supply of <b>aluminum</b> were as yet uncertain, and that the metal was too expensive to use in a minor coin. Numismatic historian Don Taxay, in his history of the United States Mint and its coins, noted that Linderman had proposed legislation increasing the proportion of nickel in the alloy to a third despite having earlier opposed the use of nickel in coins. Taxay suggested that Linderman was most likely influenced by Wharton and the metal's other advocates.|$|E
5|$|The HTC One uses a unibody <b>aluminum</b> frame sourced from custom-grade aluminum; {{the choice}} of {{material}} was intended to give the device a solid, premium feel in comparison to smartphones made with a plastic shell. The frame is etched with channels in which the polycarbonate is inset using zero-gap injection molding. The polycarbonate forms a band {{around the edge of}} the device, covers the top and bottom ends, and bisects the back with two lines, one of which flows around the camera below. The two polycarbonate bands across the back are used to insulate its antennas, while the ring around the camera is used as a loop antenna for the One's near field communication (NFC) functionality. Alongside its display are two <b>aluminum</b> endpieces with a tight grid of laser-cut holes forming the speaker grilles behind which sit two stereo sound speakers; the metal volume keys are smoothly inlaid on the left side of the frame. The unibody frame itself takes at least 200 minutes of precision CNC cutting to machine, and the final result is a solid slate of anodized <b>aluminum,</b> white polycarbonate, and tempered glass with chamfered, polished edges.|$|E
