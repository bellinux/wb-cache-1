5|$|However, {{the results}} of Horner <b>and</b> <b>colleagues,</b> Prieto-Márquez, and McDonald <b>and</b> <b>colleagues,</b> which {{consider}} the North American Protohadros to be the closest relative of Eolambia, contradict this hypothesis. This alternative interpretation suggests that the common ancestor of Eolambia, Protohadros, and more derived hadrosauroids was not exclusively Asian, but instead distributed across Asia and North America. McDonald <b>and</b> <b>colleagues</b> further suggested that Eolambia and Protohadros represent a localized group of hadrosauroids endemic to North America, much like other groups of styracosternans throughout the Cretaceous. Such contemporary groups included a central Asian group of Shuangmiaosaurus, Zhanghenglong, and Plesiohadros.|$|E
5|$|In 2005 Stephan C.

5|$|In 2012, McDonald {{conducted}} a phylogenetic analysis of iguanodonts incorporating data from new Eolambia specimens. Contrary to previous authors, he found instead that Eolambia was the sister group of Probactrosaurus. This close relationship {{was based on}} two shared characteristics: the quadrate being straight save for the top end, which is curved backwards; and {{the top and bottom}} margins of the scapular blade being nearly parallel. Wenjie Zheng <b>and</b> <b>colleagues</b> added Jintasaurus to the group in 2014, while José Gasca <b>and</b> <b>colleagues</b> recovered the original group in 2015. However, McDonald extensively revised his phylogenetic dataset further in preparation for the 2017 description of the FMNH specimens. As with Horner <b>and</b> <b>colleagues,</b> as well as Prieto-Márquez and Norell, McDonald <b>and</b> <b>colleagues</b> found that Eolambia was the sister group of Protohadros, with both of them being placed as basal hadrosauromorphs (results reproduced below). Using the 2012 version of the McDonald dataset, Francisco Verdú <b>and</b> <b>colleagues</b> independently recovered a similar result, with Eolambia being closely related to Protohadros and Jeyawati; however, McDonald <b>and</b> <b>colleagues</b> found the latter to be more derived in 2017.|$|E

5|$|According to phylogenetic {{analyses}} {{based on}} the sequences of both the S and M segments, OROV is most {{closely related to the}} clade formed by BAYV, CATV, BCCV, and Muleshoe virus (MUL; from the hispid cotton rat). In 2009, Piet Maes <b>and</b> <b>colleagues</b> proposed that the closely related BAYV, BCCV, and MUL be united into a single species. Chu <b>and</b> <b>colleagues</b> were surprised to find that the same species, Oryzomys couesi, harbored different viruses (OROV and CATV), though noted that the subspecies infected by the two viruses were different. In 2010, Delton Hanson <b>and</b> <b>colleagues</b> suggested on the basis of various lines of evidence, including the presence of different hantaviruses, that western Mexican populations of Oryzomys couesi represent a different species, Oryzomys mexicanus.|$|E

5|$|Although {{many species}} of Psittacosaurus have been named, their {{relationships}} to each other {{have not yet been}} fully explored and no scientific consensus exists on the subject. Several phylogenetic analyses have been published, with the most detailed being those by Alexander Averianov <b>and</b> <b>colleagues</b> in 2006, Hai-Lu You <b>and</b> <b>colleagues</b> in 2008, and Paul Sereno in 2010. The middle one is shown below.|$|E
5|$|Examining both {{morphological}} {{and genetic}} (cytochrome b) characters in 2008, German biologist Michael Wink <b>and</b> <b>colleagues</b> {{concluded that the}} southern boobook is distinct from the morepork and Tasmanian boobook (which they proposed to be raised to species status as Ninox leucopsis), {{and that it is}} instead the sister taxon to the barking owl (N. connivens). A 2017 study by Singapore-based biologist Chyi Yin Gwee <b>and</b> <b>colleagues</b> analysing both multi-locus DNA and boobook calls confirmed a sister relationship of leucopsis and novaeseelandiae and their close relationship to connivens. Additionally, genetic and call analysis show the Christmas boobook (N. natalis) to be very close to the Australian populations of the southern boobook, leading Gwee <b>and</b> <b>colleagues</b> to suggest it be reclassified within this species.|$|E
5|$|However, in 2003 Michael Woodburne <b>and</b> <b>colleagues</b> {{revised the}} phylogenetic {{analysis}} published by Luo <b>and</b> <b>colleagues,</b> making several {{changes to the}} data, particularly in the monotremes. Their results (Figure 3, bottom) challenged the division between Australosphenida and Boreosphenida, as proposed by Luo et al. Instead, they excluded monotremes from Australosphenida and placed the remaining australosphenidans close to Eutheria, with Ambondro most closely related to Asfaltomylos. In 2007, Guillermo Rougier <b>and</b> <b>colleagues</b> described another australosphenidan, Henosferus, from the Jurassic of Argentina; they argued against a relationship between Eutheria and Australosphenida (Figure 3, top), but were ambivalent about the placement of monotremes within Australosphenida. Based in part on Martin and Rauhut's earlier work on wear facets in australosphenidans, they questioned {{the presence of a}} true functional protocone on the upper molars of non-monotreme australosphenidans—none of which are known from upper teeth—and consequently suggested that australosphenidans may not, after all, have had truly tribosphenic teeth.|$|E

5|$|In 2004 Lü <b>and</b> <b>colleagues</b> {{proposed}} that the articulation between the quadrate and quadratojugal bones in the skull of Nemegtomaia suggested that these bones were movable in relation to each other, which would have affected how the jaws functioned. In 2015 Christophe Hendrickx <b>and</b> <b>colleagues</b> found it unlikely that Nemegtomaia and other oviraptords had bird-like kinesis in their skulls, due to the quadrate bone being immobile.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Zhou <b>and</b> <b>colleagues</b> {{suggested}} that P. lujiatunensis is basal {{to all other}} species. This {{would be consistent with}} its earlier appearance in the fossil record.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Butler <b>and</b> <b>colleagues</b> {{conducted}} {{computer tomography}} scans {{of the juvenile}} skull SAM-PK-K10487. To the surprise of these researchers, replacement teeth yet to erupt were present even in this early ontogenetic stage. Despite these findings, the authors argued that tooth replacement must have occurred since the juvenile displayed the same tooth morphology as adult individuals – this morphology would have changed if the tooth simply grew continuously. In conclusion, Butler <b>and</b> <b>colleagues</b> suggested that tooth replacement in Heterodontosaurus must have been more sporadic than in related dinosaurs. Unerupted replacement teeth in Heterodontosaurus were not discovered until 2011, when Norman <b>and</b> <b>colleagues</b> described the upper jaw of specimen SAM-PK-K1334. Another juvenile skull (AMNH 24000) described by Sereno in 2012 also yielded unerupted replacement teeth. As shown by these discoveries, tooth replacement in Heterodontosaurus was episodical and not continuous as in other heterodontosaurids. The unerupted teeth are triangular in lateral view, which is the typical tooth morphology in basal ornithischians. The characteristic chisel-like shape of the fully erupted teeth therefore resulted from tooth-to-tooth contact between the dentition of {{the upper and lower}} jaws.|$|E

5|$|In the 2000s, {{additional}} {{members of}} Ferugliotheriidae were described. In 2004, Francisco Goin <b>and</b> <b>colleagues</b> described a single enigmatic tooth from the Paleogene of Peru, LACM 149371; their best estimate {{was that it}} represented a member of Ferugliotheriidae. On {{the basis of a}} single p4, Kielan-Jaworowska <b>and</b> <b>colleagues</b> named Argentodites coloniensis, from the Late Cretaceous La Colonia Formation of Argentina, in 2007 as a multituberculate, possibly referable to the suborder Cimolodonta. Gurovich and Beck argued, however, that the p4 of Argentodites did not differ materially from that in the jaw they allocated to Ferugliotherium, and that Argentodites was based on a specimen of either Ferugliotherium or a closely related animal. Guillermo Rougier <b>and</b> <b>colleagues</b> described mammals from the Allen Formation, a third Argentinean formation of similar age, in 2009, including a new ferugliotheriid, Trapalcotherium matuastensis. They also regarded Argentodites as a likely relative of Ferugliotherium and suggested that Ferugliotheriidae are either multituberculates or closely related to them.|$|E
5|$|In their {{original}} description, Krause <b>and</b> <b>colleagues</b> suggested that Lavanify was most {{closely related to}} the then-unnamed Indian sudamericid. They based this proposed relationship on the shared presence of prominent, continuous bands of IPM. The teams who named the Indian gondwanathere in 2007 both agreed with this proposed relationship. In their description of Dakshina, Wilson <b>and</b> <b>colleagues</b> added the presence of an infundibulum and of perikymata to the evidence for the relationship between the two. These three characters are synapomorphies (shared derived traits) for the Bharattherium-Lavanify clade. They also share the presence of furrows on the lingual side of the teeth only, but whether this is a derived feature is uncertain. Wilson <b>and</b> <b>colleagues</b> list two autapomorphies (unique derived traits) of Lavanify: presence of a V-shaped dentine island and absence of enamel {{on one side of the}} crown. Prasad <b>and</b> <b>colleagues</b> who named Bharattherium, noted the absence of enamel on part of the crown of a Bharattherium tooth and interpreted this trait as a synapomorphy of Bharattherium and Lavanify. They also mentioned the presence of a furrow and infundibulum as shared traits.|$|E

5|$|Krause <b>and</b> <b>colleagues</b> {{wrote that}} these two teeth {{resemble}} multituberculate deciduous anterior upper premolars, particularly second and third premolars (P2 and P3), and used this {{as one of their}} arguments for identifying Ferugliotherium as a multituberculate. However, as with the dentary MACN Pv-RN 975, the two upper premolars were excluded from Ferugliotherium and identified as multituberculates by Kielan-Jaworowska <b>and</b> <b>colleagues</b> after the discovery of the jaw of Sudamerica.

5|$|Liu <b>and</b> <b>colleagues</b> {{conducted}} a separate phylogenetic analysis in 2017.

In their own analysis, Liu <b>and</b> <b>colleagues</b> used the same source datasets, but deleted repeated characters, added two new characters from an analysis by Sean Modesto and Hans-Dieter Sues (2004), and removed poorly preserved or potentially chimeric taxa such as Cosesaurus, Kadimakara, Trachelosaurus, and Malerisaurus. Analyses based on parsimony-based and Bayesian methods found that Dinocephalosaurus {{was a member of}} the Tanystropheidae, being the sister group to a clade containing Tanystropheus, Macrocnemus, Langobardisaurus, and Tanytrachelos. The analyses also recovered a monophyletic Protorosauria, albeit to the exclusion of Prolacerta. The tree from the parsimony-based analysis is reproduced above, at right.|$|E
