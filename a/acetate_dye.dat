30|$|Aniline has {{the general}} ability to inhibit enzyme activity, and hence, {{this has been}} listed as a {{probable}} human carcinogen by US Environmental Protection Agency (Dvorak et al. 2014). The aromatic amines such as aniline derivatives have widespread applications as dye intermediates, and most commonly used derivatives are 2 -nitroaniline, 3 -nitroaniline and 4 -nitroaniline (Sun et al. 2007). These aniline derivatives {{are used in the}} manufacture of different types of <b>dyes</b> such as <b>acetate</b> <b>dyes,</b> direct dyes and disperse dyes. These dyes are manufactured in China and India. If 1000  mg/L of dye is present in a dye bath (Manu and Chaudhari 2002) and about 50 % is lost into effluent (Khan et al. 2004), the concentration of nitroanilines in effluent may exceed 300  mg/L since these are used as an intermediate.|$|R

40|$|The {{possibility}} {{of reducing the}} use of auxiliaries in conventional cellulose <b>acetate</b> <b>dyeing</b> with disperse dyes using ultrasound technique was studied {{as an alternative to}} the standard procedure. <b>Dyeing</b> of cellulose <b>acetate</b> yarn was carried out by using either mechanical agitation alone, with and without auxiliaries, or joining the mechanical and ultrasound agitation in the bath where the temperature range was between 60 °C and 80 °C. The best results of dyeing kinetics were obtained with ultrasound coupled with mechanical agitation without auxiliaries. Hence the corresponding half dyeing time, absorption rate constants according to Cegarra-Puente modified equation and ultrasound efficiency were calculated confirming the synergic effect of sonication on dyeing kinetics. Finally, the fastness test gives good values for samples dyed with ultrasound technique even without use of auxiliaries.

40|$|The {{possibility}} {{of reducing the}} use of auxiliaries in conventional cellulose <b>acetate</b> <b>dyeing</b> with Disperse Red 50 using ultrasound technique was studied {{as an alternative to}} the standard procedure. <b>Dyeing</b> of cellulose <b>acetate</b> yarn was carried out by using either mechanical agitation alone, with and without auxiliaries, or coupling mechanical and ultrasound agitation in the bath where the temperature range was maintained between 60 and 80 °C. The best results of dyeing kinetics were obtained with ultrasound coupled with mechanical agitation without auxiliaries (90 % of bath exhaustion value at 80 °C). Hence the corresponding half dyeing times, absorption rate constants according to Cegarra-Puente modified equation and ultrasound efficiency were calculated confirming the synergic effect of sonication on the dyeing kinetics. Moreover the apparent activation energies were also evaluated and the positive effect of ultrasound added to mechanical agitation was evidenced by the lower value (48 kJ/mol) in comparison with 112 and 169 kJ/mol for mechanical stirring alone with auxiliaries and without, respectively. Finally, the fastness tests gave good values for samples dyed with ultrasound technique even without auxiliaries. Moreover color measurements in dyed yarns showed that the color yield obtained by ultrasound-assisted dyeing at 80 °C of cellulose acetate without using additional chemicals into the dye bath reached the same value yielded by mechanical agitation, but with remarkably shorter tim...|$|R

40|$|During the {{absorption}} of phosphate by yeast, the cells acquire the capacity to absorb Mn ++ and Mg ++, a capacity which is retained even after phosphate is no longer present in the medium. Cells pretrcated with phosphate and then washed, slowly lose their ability to absorb Mn ++, the rate of loss depending on the temperature and on the metabolic state. The fermentation of sugars induces a very rapid loss of absorptive capacity, whereas the respiration of ethyl alcohol, lactate, or pymvate has little effect. Inhibitor studies with sodium <b>acetate,</b> redox <b>dyes,</b> and arsenate, reveal parallel effects on Mn ~ " absorption, and on phosphate absorption. It is concluded that the synthesis of a carrier for the transport of Mg ++ and Mn ++ involves a phosphorylation step closely coupled with reactions involved in {{the absorption}} of phosphate. Yeast cells {{in the absence of}} glucose bind bivalent cations to the cell surface (1). Cations so bound are completely exchangeable with the cations of the medium.

40|$|Photovoltaics (solar cells) are {{important}} {{in the creation of}} sustainable architecture, but are difficult to integrate into a wide variety of architectural styles, which is necessary if this technology is to be extensively used. Adding variety to the colour range in these installations will provide a way of making this solar energy technology more visually exciting, so methods need to be found to add colour at minimal extra cost, without loss of efficiency. Adding colour to photovoltaic encapsulant materials offers a solution. It is shown that fluorescent, organic Lumogen dyes (BASF) can be added to the photovoltaic encapsulant materials Sylgard 184 (Dow Corning) and EVA (Ethylene Vinyl <b>Acetate).</b> The <b>dyes</b> continue to fluoresce within these host materials. Encapsulating a photovoltaic cell with Sylgard containing Lumogen red 300 dye (BASF) demonstrates that light can be transported to a photovoltaic cell by the fluorescent dyes inside the encapsulant material that surrounds the cell. This slightly improves the electricity output from the photovoltaic cell, and is especially promising for use in light-transmissive photovoltaic arrays incorporating widely-spaced photovoltaic cells, such as architectural glass art that incorporates photovoltaics. Further work is needed to test and improve the performance of the dyes over time, to ensure that installations incorporating this technology can last for the minimum twenty years that is the current industry standard for photovoltaics...|$|R
40|$|In {{our search}} for {{efficient}} and photostable laser dyes, four new dyes with {{the basic structure of}} the commercial BODIPY laser dye PM 567, with either an 8 -diphenylene or an 8 -p-triphenylene group, both substituted at the terminal polyphenylene position with an acetoxymethyl (dyes P 2 Ar 1 Ac and P 3 Ar 1 Ac, respectively) or a methacryloyloxymethyl group (dyes P 2 Ar 1 MA and P 3 Ar 1 MA, respectively), have been synthesized. The photophysical and lasing properties of the dyes have been studied both dissolved in liquid solvents (acetoxymethyl dyes) and incorporated into solid polymeric matrices, in the latter case as solutions (acetoxymethyl dyes) or as copolymers with methyl methacrylate (methacryloyloxymethyl dyes). In liquid solution, the photophysics of P 2 Ar 1 Ac and P 3 Ar 1 Ac is scarcely affected by the number (two or three) of p-phenylene units. Quantum mechanical calculations reveal that the p-phenylene units in these dyes are twisted ca. 37 ◦ each other, an that the first 8 -p-phenylene group stands nearly perpendicular to the aromatic BODIPY plane, resulting in electronic decoupling of the two chromophores. P 2 Ar 1 Ac exhibits a somewhat lower photodegradation quantum yield under UV and visible irradiation, if compared with P 3 Ar 1 Ac or with PM 567, likely because of its also lower rate constant for the reaction with in situ-generated singlet molecular oxygen. Both acetoxymethyl dyes emit laser radiation in solution in all the solvents tried, under transversal pumping at 532 nm. In ethyl <b>acetate,</b> with a <b>dye</b> concentration of 0. 80 × 10 − 3 M, laser efficiencies as high as 80...|$|R
40|$|Azo dyes are nonspecifically reduced under {{anaerobic}} conditions but the slow rates at which reactive azo dyes are converted presents {{a serious problem}} {{for the application of}} anaerobic technology as a first stage in the complete biodegradation of these compounds. As quinones have been found to catalyze reductive transfers by acting as redox mediators, the application of anthraquinone- 2, 6 -disulfonic acid (AQDS) during continuous anaerobic treatment of the reactive azo dye, Reactive Red 2 (RR 2), was evaluated. A mixture of volatile fatty acids was used as the electron-donating primary substrate. Batch experiments demonstrated that AQDS could increase the first-order rate constant of RR 2 reductive cleavage by one order of magnitude. In the continuous experiment, treatment of RR 2 containing synthetic wastewater in a lab-scale upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor yielded low dye removal efficiencies (< 30 Ž Consequently, severe toxicity problems occurred, eventually resulting in almost complete inhibition of the methanogenic activity. Addition of catalytic concentrations of AQDS (19 M) to the reactor influent caused an immediate increase in the dye removal efficiency and recovery of biological activity. Ultimately, RR 2 removal efficiency stabilized at 88 °and higher AQDS loads resulted in higher RR 2 removal efficiencies (up to 98 t 155 M AQDS). Examination of the RR 2 decolorizing properties of dye-adapted reactor sludge and of nonadapted reactor seed sludge revealed that RR 2 decolorization was principally a biologically driven transfer of reducing equivalents from endogenous and added substrates to the dye. Hydrogen, added in bulk, was clearly the preferred electron donor. Bacteria that couple dye decolorization to hydrogen oxidation were naturally present in seed sludge. However, enrichment was required for the utilization of electrons from volatile fatty acids for dye reduction. The stimulatory effect of AQDS on RR 2 decolorization by AQDS-unadapted sludge was mainly due to assisting the electron transfer from endogenous substrates in the sludge to the dye. The stimulatory effect of AQDS on RR 2 decolorization by sludge from the AQDS-exposed reactor was, in addition, strongly associated with the transfer of electrons from hydrogen and <b>acetate</b> to the <b>dye,</b> probably due to enrichment of specialized AQDS-reducing bacteri...|$|R
