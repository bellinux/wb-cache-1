5|$|Adams' popularity, however, was declining, and {{he decided}} not to run for reelection in 1797. A number of popular figures were raised as nominees, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> year's election, Sumner won the vote with 15,000 {{out of a total of}} 25,000 votes cast against a divided opposition. On June 2 Sumner rode from his home in Roxbury {{accompanied}} by 300 citizens on horseback to the State House in Boston, where the Secretary of the Commonwealth proclaimed his governorship from the eastern balcony. Sumner was the last governor to preside in what is now called the Old State House as the seat of government was moved to the New State House the following year.|$|E

5|$|After some refitting, President, {{still under}} Rodgers' command, sailed on 8October with Congress, United States, and Argus. On 12October, United States and Argus parted from the {{squadron}} {{for their own}} patrols. On 10October, President chased , but failed to overtake her. On 17October President captured the British packet ship Swallow, which carried {{a large amount of}} currency on board. On 31October, President and Congress began pursuit of , which was escorting two merchant ships. The chase lasted about three hours, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> time Congress captured the merchant ship Argo. Meanwhile, President kept after Galatea and drew very close, but lost sight of her in the night. Congress and President remained together, but did not find any ships to capture during November. Returning to the United States, they passed north of Bermuda and proceeded toward the Virginia capes; they arrived in Boston on 31December, having taken nine prizes. President and Congress found themselves blockaded there by the Royal Navy until April 1813.|$|E

After returning from All Blacks duty, he played for Canterbury and contributed to a Ranfurly Shield win over Waitako. Canterbury then reached the NPC final, giving Hammett {{the opportunity to be}} part of a Super 12, Ranfurly Shield, and NPC winning team, all in the same year. Wellington won the NPC final however, and the opportunity was lost. Hammett was then {{selected for the}} end-of-year All Blacks tour, and played against France and Italy (both as a substitute).|$|E
5|$|Although single western towers {{are common}} in English parish churches, only one medieval cathedral, Ely, retains a {{centrally}} placed western tower, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> case, it was framed by two lower lateral towers, one of which has since fallen down. Ely, alone among England’s cathedrals, has a central feature over the crossing that somewhat resembles the polygonal vaulted lantern towers of Spain. This elaborate lantern-like structure known as “The Octagon” spans both the nave and aisles, and is thus said to have inspired Christopher Wren’s design for the dome of St. Paul’s Cathedral. Its upper parts are supported by hidden wooden hammer-beams, an architectural device unique to English Gothic.|$|E

5|$|Before long, Chadwick gave Rotblat a {{fellowship}} (the Oliver Lodge Fellowship), doubling his income, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> summer of 1939 the young Pole returned home, intending to bring Tola back with him. When {{the time came}} to leave Warsaw in late August, however, she was ill following an operation for appendicitis, and remained behind, expecting to follow within days; but the outbreak of war brought calamity. Tola was trapped, and desperate efforts in the ensuing months to bring her out through Denmark (with the help of Niels Bohr), Belgium, and finally Italy came to nothing, as each country in turn was closed off by the war. He never saw her again; she died in the Holocaust at the Belzec concentration camp. This affected him deeply {{for the rest of his}} life, and he never remarried.|$|E
5|$|During the war, the {{contents}} of the society's library were plundered by Union Army forces, and many of its 3,000 volumes were either scattered or destroyed. After a reorganization in 1869, the society commenced construction of the present Literary Hall in downtown Romney. It transferred ownership of its Romney Classical Institute campus to the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind in 1870 <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> year completed Literary Hall, where the society reconstituted its library collection and revived its literary activities.|$|E

5|$|Eastern Suburbs {{missed the}} finals once from 1926 to 1942, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> time won four titles and the minor premiership on seven occasions. During this period, Dave Brown set several point-scoring records that still stand. In 1935, the team lost just one game, and {{recorded}} the highest winning margin in their history, an 87–7 (106–8 in modern scoring) victory over Canterbury. In 1936, Eastern Suburbs {{became one of}} five teams in premiership history to remain undefeated for an entire season, a feat they repeated the following year. They are the only club to remain unbeaten for two consecutive seasons.|$|E
5|$|English verbs are inflected for {{tense and}} aspect, and marked for {{agreement}} with third person singular subject. Only the copula verb {{to be is}} still inflected for agreement with the plural and first and second person subjects. Auxiliary verbs such as have and be are paired with verbs in the infinitive, past, or progressive forms. They form complex tenses, aspects, and moods. Auxiliary verbs differ from other verbs in {{that they can be}} followed by the negation, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> they can occur as the first constituent in a question sentence.|$|E
5|$|Finally, Universal's conduct {{amounted}} to {{an abuse of}} judicial process, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> sense caused a longer harm {{to the public as}} a whole. Depending on the commercial results, Universal alternatively argued to the courts, first, that King Kong {{was a part of the}} public domain, and then second, that King Kong was not part of the public domain, and that Universal possessed exclusive trademark rights in it. Universal's assertions in court were based not on any good faith belief in their truth, but on the mistaken belief that it could use the courts to turn a profit.|$|E

5|$|From {{the close}} of the Civil War until 1895, Kentuckians elected a series of Bourbon Democrats with Confederate sympathies as governor, {{including}} two men—James B. McCreary and Simon Bolivar Buckner—who had served in the Confederate States Army. The Democratic dominance was broken by William O'Connell Bradley, who was elected the state's first Republican governor in 1895. Bradley's election marked the beginning of thirty years of true, two-party competition for the governorship in the state. Between 1895 and 1931, five Republicans and six Democrats held the office of governor. Since 1931, however, the Republicans have been unable to preserve this level of parity, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> period only four of the twenty elected governors have been from the Republican party, including incumbent Matt Bevin.|$|E
5|$|Germanicus {{was given}} the title of {{quaestor}} in AD 7, five years before the legal age of 25, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> year was sent to assist Tiberius {{in the war against}} the Pannonians and Dalmatians. According to Cassius Dio, Augustus sent Germanicus to Illyricum because Tiberius' lack of activity made Augustus suspect that he was delaying to remain under arms as long as possible under the pretense of war. Germanicus brought an army of levied citizens and manumitted slaves that were bought from their masters to reinforce Tiberius in Siscia, his base of operations in Illyricum. In late autumn/early winter additional reinforcements arrived at Siscia from Moesia and the East: three legions from Moesia led by Aulus Caecina Severus and two from Anatolia led by Silvanus with Thracian cavalry and auxiliary troops. While this did show that Augustus took the threat seriously, Tiberius had some soldiers sent back, because he had more than he needed.|$|E
5|$|He {{served in}} staff {{positions}} through the 1920s and was Air Officer Commanding the Middle East Command {{in the early}} 1930s before becoming Air Member for Supply and Organisation in 1935.

However, he was sacked after the Battle of Britain after political intrigue caused him to lose Churchill's confidence. In 1941 he was appointed Governor-General of New Zealand, holding office until 1946.|$|E

5|$|Immediately thereafter, Hickling was {{transferred}} to Malaya as its first parliamentary draftsman, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> capacity he helped to prepare the Malayan (now Malaysian) constitution for that country's independence from Britain in 1957.

For his contributions to Malaya, Hickling was made a Companion of the Order of the Defender of the Realm (known in Malay as the Johan Mangku Negara or JMN) by the Malaysian head of state, the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, in 1960.|$|E
