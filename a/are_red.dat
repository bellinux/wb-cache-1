5|$|A small prickly leaved shrub between 0.2 and 3m (8 in to 10ft) high, G. juniperina grows {{generally}} on clay-based or alluvial soils in eucalypt woodland. The flower heads, {{known as}} inflorescences, appear from winter to early summer and <b>are</b> <b>red,</b> orange or yellow. Birds visit and pollinate the flowers. Grevillea juniperina plants {{are killed by}} bushfire, regenerating afterwards from seed. Grevillea juniperina adapts readily to cultivation and has been important in horticulture {{as it is the}} parent of many popular garden hybrids.|$|E

Service baldrics include a scabbard for a sword and are worn over the coat while social baldrics are worn under the coat.|$|E
5|$|Chew Valley Lake Sailing Club has a sailing area, {{approximately}} 1.9miles (3km) long, for dinghy sailing. The lake {{is divided}} into two areas: a restricted summer area which is available during the fishing season (mid-March to mid-October), and the full area which can be used throughout the winter and on Sunday afternoons. The sailing area is marked out by lines of small white buoys. Racing marks <b>are</b> <b>red</b> buoys with flags, although large inflatable marks are used of open events.|$|E
5|$|Member {{species are}} usually annuals or {{herbaceous}} perennials. Flowers <b>are</b> <b>red,</b> pink, or yellow, often in various combinations. A {{large number of}} the Erythranthe species grow in moist to wet soils with some growing even in shallow water. They are not very drought resistant, {{but many of the}} species now classified as Diplacus are. Species are found at elevations from oceanside to high mountains as well as a wide variety of climates, though most prefer wet areas such as riverbanks.|$|E

5|$|One {{class of}} honest signal is the aposematic warning signal, {{generally}} visual, given by poisonous or dangerous {{animals such as}} wasps, poison dart frogs, and pufferfish. Warning signals are honest indications of noxious prey, because conspicuousness evolves in tandem with noxiousness. Thus, the brighter and more conspicuous the organism, the more toxic it usually is. The most common and effective colours <b>are</b> <b>red,</b> yellow, black and white.|$|E
5|$|Spectra of {{the main}} ring {{obtained}} by the HST, Keck, Galileo and Cassini have shown that particles forming it <b>are</b> <b>red,</b> i.e. their albedo is higher at longer wavelengths. The existing spectra span the range 0.5–2.5 μm. No spectral features have been found so far which {{can be attributed to}} particular chemical compounds, although the Cassini observations yielded evidence for absorption bands near 0.8μm and 2.2μm. The spectra {{of the main}} ring are very similar to Adrastea and Amalthea.|$|E
5|$|The Mediterranean species Boletus poikilochromus {{somewhat}} resembles I.torosus, but {{can usually}} be distinguished by a smaller fruit body, a cylindrical stipe, and the lighter colours of younger mushrooms. Also, B.poikilochromus does not feature the colour change of the stipe base in mature fruit bodies that is seen in I.torosus. Imperator luteocupreus and Caloboletus radicans are also similar but the pores of the former <b>are</b> <b>red</b> and the flesh of latter has a bitter taste.|$|E

5|$|The Sun is a G-type {{main-sequence star}} that {{comprises}} about 99.86% {{of the mass}} of the Solar System. The Sun has an absolute magnitude of +4.83, estimated to be brighter than about 85% of the stars in the Milky Way, most of which <b>are</b> <b>red</b> dwarfs.|$|E
5|$|The irises of {{its eyes}} <b>are</b> <b>red,</b> its feet are black, and its beak is flesh-colored. The eye {{has a single}} {{incomplete}} row of eyelashes on the upper lid and two rows on the lower lid. Its beak is thick, rounded, and hooked at the tip. Because of its habit of urohidrosis, the scaly portions of its legs are often streaked white with uric acid.|$|E
5|$|The owls {{shown are}} recognizable, but not sculpted naturalistically: {{the shape of}} the beak, the length of the legs, and details of plumage deviate from those of the owls that are {{indigenous}} to the region. Their plumage is colored like the deity's wings in red, black and white; it is bilaterally similar but not perfectly symmetrical. Both owls have one more feather on the right-hand side of their plumage than on the left-hand side. The legs, feet and talons <b>are</b> <b>red.</b>|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} a long-held {{assumption}} {{that the majority of}} stars occur in gravitationally bound, multiple-star systems. This is particularly true for very massive O and B class stars, where 80% of the stars are believed to be part of multiple-star systems. The proportion of single star systems increases with decreasing star mass, so that only 25% of red dwarfs are known to have stellar companions. As 85% of all stars <b>are</b> <b>red</b> dwarfs, most stars in the Milky Way are likely single from birth.|$|E

5|$|Mallards of {{all ages}} (but {{especially}} young ones) and in all locations must contend with a wide diversity of predators including raptors, mustelids, corvids, snakes, raccoons, opossums, skunks, turtles, large fish, felids, and canids, including domesticated ones. The most prolific natural predators of adult mallards <b>are</b> <b>red</b> foxes (which most often pick off brooding females) and the faster or larger birds of prey, i.e. peregrine falcons, Aquila eagles, or Haliaeetus eagles. In North America, adult mallards face no fewer than 15 species of birds of prey, from northern harriers and short-eared owls (both smaller than a mallard) to huge bald and golden eagles, and about a dozen species of mammalian predator, not counting several more avian and mammalian predators who threaten eggs and nestlings.|$|E
5|$|Mild iron {{deficiency}} {{can be prevented}} or corrected by eating iron-rich foods and by cooking in an iron skillet. Because iron is a requirement for most plants and animals, {{a wide range of}} foods provide iron. Good sources of dietary iron have heme-iron, as this is most easily absorbed and is not inhibited by medication or other dietary components. Three examples <b>are</b> <b>red</b> meat, poultry, and insects. Non-heme sources do contain iron, though it has reduced bioavailability. Examples are lentils, beans, leafy vegetables, pistachios, tofu, fortified bread, and fortified breakfast cereals.|$|E

The BEST operates a total of 4,608 buses with CCTV cameras installed, ferrying 4.5million passengers daily over 390 routes. Its fleet consists of single-decker, double-decker, vestibule, low-floor, disabled-friendly, air-conditioned and Euro III compliant diesel and compressed natural gas powered buses. BEST introduced air-conditioned buses in 1998. BEST buses <b>are</b> <b>red</b> in colour, based originally on the Routemaster buses of London.|$|E
50|$|For example, {{a person}} has a memory of a house and recalls it to be white. Then, a trusted family member begins talking with them and {{suggests}} that it <b>was</b> <b>red</b> instead.

It is unknown if the person's memory {{of the house is}} permanently altered; however, they will say that the house <b>was</b> <b>red</b> regardless of the memory's condition.|$|R
