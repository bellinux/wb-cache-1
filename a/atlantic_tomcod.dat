5|$|Before the {{construction}} of the causeway, the Petitcodiac River was home to many aquatic species. Fish originally included hundreds of thousands of <b>Atlantic</b> <b>tomcod</b> and rainbow smelt, tens of thousands of gaspereau and American shad, thousands of American eel, Atlantic salmon, brook trout, lamprey, and striped bass and hundreds of Atlantic sturgeon. Other fish include the blueback herring, the brown bullhead, the chain pickerel, the smallmouth bass, the white perch, and the white sucker. Marine mammals were uncommon, but normally consisted of pilot whales, Atlantic white-sided dolphins, harbour porpoise, harbour seals, and porbeagles. Freshwater mollusc species included the brook floater, the dwarf wedgemussel, the eastern ellipto, the eastern floater, the eastern pearlshell, and the triangle floater.

50|$|The PCBs caused {{extensive}} {{contamination of}} fish in the river and apparently triggered a rapid evolutionary change in the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>tomcod,</b> which after about 50 years of exposure evolved a two amino acid change in its AHR2 receptor gene, causing the receptor to bind more weakly with PCBs than normal. The mutation does not prevent the tomcods from accumulating PCBs in their bodies and passing them on to striped bass and whatever else eats them. This system of passing contamination on to larger organisms {{is also known as}} biomagnification. The toxic chemicals also accumulated in sediments that settled to the river bottom.|$|E

50|$|Like most gulls, {{they also}} capture fish with some {{regularity}} and will readily capture any fish smaller than itself found {{close to the}} surface of the water. Whether caught or eaten after death or injury from other sources, stomach contents of great black-backed gulls usually show fish to be the primary food. On Sable Island in Nova Scotia, 25% of the stomach contents were comprised by fish but 96% of the regurgitations given to young was made up fish. Similarly, on Great Island in Newfoundland, 25% of the stomach contents were fish but 68% of regurgitants were fish. The most regularly reported fish eaten in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland were capelin (Mallotus villosus), Atlantic cod (Gadus morrhua), <b>Atlantic</b> <b>tomcod</b> (Microgadus tomcod), Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus), Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) and sand lance (Ammodytes hexapterus). Other prey often includes various squid, Jonah crabs (Cancer borealis), rock crabs (Cancer irroratus), sea urchins, green crabs (Carcinus maenas), starfish (Asterias forbesi and Asterias rubens) and other echinoderms, crustaceans and mollusks when they come across the opportunity. From observations in northern New England, 23% of observed prey was echinoderms and 63% was crustaceans.|$|E

50|$|An example {{involving}} the direct observation of gene modification due to selection pressures is {{the resistance to}} PCBs in codfish. After General Electric dumped polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the Hudson River from 1947 through 1976, tomcods (Microgadus tomcod) living in the river {{were found to have}} evolved an increased resistance to the compound's toxic effects. The tolerance to the toxins is due to a change in the coding section of specific gene. Genetic samples were taken from the cods from 8 different rivers in the New England region: the St. Lawrence River, Miramichi River, Margaree River, Squamscott River, Niantic River, the Shinnecock Basic, the Hudson River, and the Hackensack River. Genetic analysis found that in the population of tomcods in the four southernmost rivers, the gene AHR2 (aryl hydrocarbon receptor 2) was present as an allele with a difference of two amino acid deletions. This deletion conferred a resistance to PCB in the fish species and was found in 99% of Hudson River tomcods, 92% in the Hackensack River, 6% in the Niantic River, and 5% in Shinnecock Bay. This pattern along the sampled bodies of waters infers a direct correlation of selective pressures leading to the evolution of PCB resistance in <b>Atlantic</b> <b>tomcod</b> fish.|$|E

Levels of variation in CYP 1 A mRNA expression were directly correlated with mean levels of gene induction. Our results indicate that sex and reproductive state, but not temperature, had significant effects on CYP 1 A mRNA inducibility in tomcod; however, these parameters did not account for all interindividual variation in CYP 1 A inducibility.

40|$|Populations {{of organisms}} that are chronically exposed {{to high levels}} of {{chemical}} contaminants may not suffer the same sublethal or lethal effects as naive populations, a phenomenon called resistance. <b>Atlantic</b> <b>tomcod</b> (Microgadus tomcod) from the Hudson River, New York, are exposed to high concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and bioaccumulate polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs). They have developed resistance to PCBs and PCDDs but not to PAHs. Resistance is largely heritable and manifests at early-life-stage toxic end points and in inducibility of cytochrome P 4501 A (CYP 1 A) mRNA expression. Because CYP 1 A induction is activated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) pathway, as are most toxic responses to these compounds, we sought to determine the geographic extent of resistance to CYP 1 A mRNA induction by PCBs in the Hudson River tomcod population.

40|$|Rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) is a teleost that tolerates {{temperatures}} {{close to}} the freezing point of sea water {{through the use of}} proteins (Ewart and Fletcher, 1990) and glycerol (Raymond, 1992) as antifreeze agents. The lower the temperature, the higher the glycerol level such that at – 2 °C serum glycerol may approach 400 mM (Raymond, 1992). Although effective at lowering the freezing temperature glycerol is lost at a rate that may exceed 10 % of glycerol stores per day (Raymond, 1993). Therefore, there must be vigorous glycerol synthesis at very low temperatures. Liver is an active site of glycerol synthesis and one source of carbon for glycerol is probably dietary amino acids that are degraded to glyceraldehyde 3 -phosphate (G 3 P) (Raymond and Driedzic, 1997; Driedzic et al., 1998). It appears that carbon flow is G 3 P ® dihydroxyacetone-P (DHAP) ® glycerol- 3 -P ® glycerol.

40|$|Adult <b>Atlantic</b> <b>tomcod</b> {{collected}} from the Hudson River slightly north of New York City have an extremely high incidence (55 - 90 %) of histologically defined hepatocellular carcinomas, whereas tomcod from control sites in Maine or Rhode Island exhibit little evidence of this condition.

Six out of nine tumors (66 %) tested proved positive. Southern blot analysis of all primary (6 / 6) transfectant and nude mouse tumor DNAs revealed evidence of an exogenous tomcod K-ras gene, while no activation of the H-ras gene was observed. These studies demonstrate that an outbred population of fishes and inbred mammals suffer genetic alterations at the same oncogene loci and suggest that similar pathways to neoplasia may be operative in both systems.

40|$|An empirically derived age-, time-, and space-variant {{equation}} {{was used}} to estimateentrainment mortality at power plants for seven fish species inhabiting the Hudson River estuary. Entrainment mortality is expressed as a conditional rate, which is the fractional reduction in yearclassstrength due to entrainment if other sources of mortality are density-independent. Estimates of the conditional entrainment mortality, based on historical and projected oncethroughcooling operation of five power plants, were 11 - 22 % for striped bass, 11 - 17 % for whiteperch, 5 - 7 % for <b>Atlantic</b> <b>tomcod,</b> 14 - 21 % for American shad, 4 - 11 % for river herring (alewife andblueback herring combined), and 35 - 79 % for bay anchovy.

40|$|Gadids (cod fishes) are ecologically {{prominent}} and important {{species of the}} north polar marine fauna. Seven gadid species {{are known to have}} evolved antifreeze glycoproteins (AFGPs) that enable their survival from inoculative freezing by environmental ice in frigid Arctic and sub-Arctic waters. AFGPs protect the fish from freezing death by binding to ice crystals and arresting ice growth within the fish. How and from where this important new genetic trait evolved in the gadid genome remained unknown, as thus far there are no homologous sequences in databases to infer genetic ancestry based on sequence homology. Additionally, the seven AFGP-bearing species are dispersed in separate clades of the gadid phylogeny, indicating a complicated evolutionary history of AFGP in the gadid lineage. The AFGP loci in three gadid species were isolated and characterized to investigate the genetic origin and evolutionary pathway of the AFGP gene family in the gadid lineage.

40|$|Large water-use {{facilities}} are often equipped with vertically travelling debris barriers known as Ristroph screens. Although {{made in a}} variety of configurations, all such screens are equipped with some manner of fish-catching troughs or rails, and all operate on the principle of direct contact and active removal of impounded fish and debris. The imposed fish mortalities associated with these machines are commonly attributed to the consequences of impingements (to fish being flattened against the screening by the force of the inflowing water), but the laboratory and field experiments reported here imply that in those circumstances where the screens travel continuously and where water speeds are moderate, the major underwater injuries are attributable instead to buffeting of captured fish within the fish troughs proper. A reconfigured machine, including the redesigned fish-catching apparatus, was installed and tested at a nuclear generating station on the Hudson River estuary. In tests similar to those on the unimproved machine, injuries and deaths were reduced from 53 to 9 % for striped bass Morone saxatilis, from 64 to 14 % for white perch M. american, from 80 to 17 % for <b>Atlantic</b> <b>tomcod</b> Microgadus tomcod, and from 47 to 7 % for pumpkinseed Lepomis gibbosus...|$|E

International audienceA multibiomarker approach was developed on juvenile <b>Atlantic</b> <b>tomcod</b> (Microgadus tomcod) to evaluate the pertinence of this approach for low-cost screening assessment of the environmental quality of various coastal sites within estuaries. Several biometric indices and biomarkers (ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity, metallothionein concentration, and immune responses) were investigated on immature and maturing tomcods (≤ 31 months) collected in four environmentally contrasted sites in the St. Lawrence Estuary (SLE). Simultaneous examination of various age classes provides the opportunity to detect short-term responses in sensitive young-of-the-year fish (e. g., EROD induction) and longer-time effects associated with chronic exposure and bioaccumulation (e. g., metallothionein induction). Principal component analysis was helpful to discriminate between responses possibly related to contaminant exposure (EROD, metallothionein) and responses that could be affected by upstream-downstream gradient (immune response, biometric indices). Measurement of a battery of biomarkers in young tomcods at several sites along the shore of the SLE is a low-cost screening investigation useful to identify hot spots requiring further investigation with chemical analysis and additional reference sites...|$|E

Because CYP 1 A induction is activated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) pathway, as are most toxic responses to these compounds, we sought to determine the geographic extent of resistance to CYP 1 A mRNA induction by PCBs in the Hudson River tomcod population. Samples of young-of-the-year tomcod were collected from seven locales in the Hudson River, extending from the Battery at river mile 1 (RM 1) to RM 90, and from the Miramichi River, New Brunswick, Canada. Laboratory-reared offspring of tomcod adults from Newark Bay, in the western portion of the Hudson River estuary, were also used in this study. Fish were partially depurated in clean water and intraperitoneally injected with 10 ppm coplanar PCB- 77, 10 ppm benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), or corn oil vehicle, and levels of CYP 1 A mRNA were determined. CYP 1 A was significantly inducible by treatment with BaP in tomcod from the Miramichi River, from laboratory-spawned offspring of Newark Bay origin, and from all Hudson River sites spanning 90 miles of river. In contrast, only tomcod from the Miramichi River displayed significantly induced CYP 1 A mRNA expression when treated with PCB- 77.

Hudson River tomcod showed the greatest response for all parameters, and tomcod from the Margaree River exhibited the least response. Tomcod from the Miramichi River exhibited marked induction of CYP 1 A mRNA but low levels of hepatic DNA adducts and biliary FACs, whereas fish from the St. Lawrence River showed no induction of CYP 1 A mRNA and moderately elevated levels of DNA adducts and biliary FACs. In tomcod from the Hudson and Miramichi rivers, the levels of CYP 1 A mRNA were 28 times and 14 times, respectively, {{as great as the}} levels in fish from the St. Lawrence, Saco/Royal, and Margaree rivers.
