5|$|A vulcanoid is an {{asteroid}} in <b>a</b> <b>stable</b> orbit with a semi-major axis {{less than that}} of Mercury (i.e. 0.387AU). This does not include objects like sungrazing comets, which, although they have perihelia inside the orbit of Mercury, have far greater semi-major axes.|$|E
5|$|Bohrium is {{the fifth}} member of the 6d series of {{transition}} metals and the heaviest member of group 7 in the periodic table, below manganese, technetium and rhenium. All {{the members of the}} group readily portray their group oxidation state of +7 and the state becomes more stable as the group is descended. Thus bohrium is expected to form <b>a</b> <b>stable</b> +7 state. Technetium also shows <b>a</b> <b>stable</b> +4 state whilst rhenium exhibits stable +4 and +3 states. Bohrium may therefore show these lower states as well. The higher +7 oxidation state is more likely to exist in oxyanions, such as perbohriate, , analogous to the lighter permanganate, pertechnetate, and perrhenate. Nevertheless, bohrium(VII) is likely to be unstable in aqueous solution, and would probably be easily reduced to the more stable bohrium(IV).|$|E
5|$|For <b>a</b> <b>stable</b> {{orbit the}} ratio between the moon's orbital period Ps around its primary {{and that of}} the primary around its star Pp must be < 1/9, e.g. if a planet takes 90 days to orbit its star, the maximum stable orbit for a moon of that planet is less than 10 days. Simulations suggest that a moon with an orbital period less than about 45 to 60 days will remain safely bound to a massive giant planet or brown dwarf that orbits 1 AU from a Sun-like star. In the case of Gliese 876 b, the orbital period would have to be no greater than a week (7 days) in order to have <b>a</b> <b>stable</b> orbit.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to hydrostatic equilibrium, {{the interior of}} <b>a</b> <b>stable</b> star will also maintain an energy balance of thermal equilibrium. There is a radial temperature gradient throughout the interior that results in a flux of energy flowing toward the exterior. The outgoing flux of energy leaving any layer within the star will exactly match the incoming flux from below.|$|E

5|$|Scaly-breasted munias have {{variable}} competitive {{behaviors that}} allow them to exploit scarce resources. There are two foraging alternatives: producers that make the food available and scroungers that steal food found by the producers. Studies show that these choices lead to <b>a</b> <b>stable</b> equilibrium within a group. When individuals are free to choose between producer and scrounger, frequency dependent selection results in <b>a</b> <b>stable</b> mixture of both behaviors where each receives similar payoff. Studies indicate that if most of the population consists of producers, then scrounging behavior is favored by natural selection because there is plenty of food to steal. On the other hand, if most birds exhibit scrounging then the competition for stealing is so great that producing is favored.|$|E

40|$|The {{college admissions}} problem {{is an example}} of a two-sided {{matching}} market. Even though it is closely-related to the stable marriage problem, it is in fact not equivalent. However, the problems are similar enough that the mechanisms used to solve them share some properties—the mechanisms are only guaranteed to produce <b>an</b> optimal <b>stable</b> outcome for one of the parties, but not both. In this paper, we will try to answer which of the two mechanisms is more preferable in the college admissions problem, at least in practice. While <b>a</b> men-optimal <b>stable</b> mechanism and <b>a</b> women-optimal <b>stable</b> mechanism in the marriage problem are symmetric of each other, <b>a</b> student-optimal <b>stable</b> mechanism and <b>a</b> college-optimal <b>stable</b> mechanism in the college admissions problem are not. Due to this asymmetry, it has been shown that <b>a</b> college-optimal <b>stable</b> mechanism has more undesirable properties than its counterpart. Moreover, the results from experiments that ran <b>a</b> student-optimal <b>stable</b> mechanism and <b>a</b> college-optimal <b>stable</b> mechanism over real data from the National Resident Matching Program that matches hospitals and medical interns (including medical specialties) in the US revealed that participating programs (colleges) would not have been much worse-off under <b>a</b> student-optimal <b>stable</b> matching (approximately 2 % of the programs would have been worse off). 2...|$|R
