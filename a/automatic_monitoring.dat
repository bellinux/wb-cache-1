40|$|AbstractIt {{has been}} well {{documented}} that air pollution adversely affects health, and epidemiological pollution-health studies utilise pollution data from <b>automatic</b> <b>monitors.</b> However, these <b>automatic</b> <b>monitors</b> are small in number and hence spatially sparse, which does not allow an accurate representation of the spatial variation in pollution concentrations required for these epidemiological health studies. Nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) diffusion tubes are also used to measure concentrations, and due to their lower cost compared to <b>automatic</b> <b>monitors</b> are much more prevalent. However, even combining both data sets still does not provide sufficient spatial coverage of NO 2 for epidemiological studies, and modelled concentrations on a regular grid from atmospheric dispersion models are also available. This paper proposes the first modelling approach to using all three sources of NO 2 data to make fine scale spatial predictions for use in epidemiological health studies. We propose a geostatistical fusion model that regresses combined NO 2 concentrations from both <b>automatic</b> <b>monitors</b> and diffusion tubes against modelled NO 2 concentrations from an atmospheric dispersion model in order to predict fine scale NO 2 concentrations across our West Central Scotland study region. Our model exhibits a 47 % improvement in fine scale spatial prediction of NO 2 compared to using the <b>automatic</b> <b>monitors</b> alone, and we use it to predict NO 2 concentrations across West Central Scotland in 2006...|$|R

We describe a Rao-Blackwellised particle filter for roomlevel tracking, rudimentary activity recognition (i. e., whether or not an occupant is moving), and data association. We evaluate our approach with experiments in a simulated environment and in a real instrumented home. ...|$|R

They depend on instant vehicle-to-vehicle communication, as well as infrastructure, functioning across brands and national borders and offering cross-brand and cross-border levels of privacy and security. The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) for that reason has argued for regulation in its Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) on V2V Communication and argued the case in US Congress. NHTSA began the rule-making process on December 13, 2016, proposing to mandate dedicated short-rnage communications (DSRC) technology in new light vehicles.https://icsw.nhtsa.gov/safercar/v2v/ Under this proposed rule, vehicles would broadcast a defined data packet, the [...] "basic safety message" [...] (BSM) up to ten times per second, indicating vehicle location, heading, and speed. In March, 2017, GM became the first US automaker to provide DSRC as standard equipment on a production automobile, the Cadillac CTS. The US also has appropriate standards - IEEE 802.11p - and frequency rules in place. In Europe a frequency is harmonised for transport safety and a harmonised standard, called ETSI ITS-G5, are in place. In the EU there is no push to oblige vehicle manufacturers to introduce connect.
