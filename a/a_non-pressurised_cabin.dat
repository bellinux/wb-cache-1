Three patients with high velocity missile injuries to the chest and pleural adhesions are reported. All had to be evacuated by air, without an intercostal drain or oxygen supplement, from the war stricken area of Northern Somalia (Horn of Africa) to Mogadishu. Two patients with a partial pneumothorax flew on military transport aeroplanes {{at an altitude of}} 3000 m in <b>a</b> <b>non-pressurised</b> <b>cabin</b> and recovered rapidly after a few days in hospital.

50|$|There are {{two main}} types of steam {{generator}} irons, pressurised and <b>non-pressurised.</b> <b>A</b> <b>non-pressurised</b> steam generator iron will produce a lot of steam but the steam is released at a lower speed, typically around 80-100 grams per minute. A pressurised steam generator iron, on the other hand, creates a highly pressurised environment that helps the steam penetrate fabric more efficiently. A pressurised steam generator iron will typically have a steam output of 100-120 grams per minute. The amount of pressure a steam generator iron has is measured in bars, with a higher bar number meaning the steam has more pressure. Steam generator irons typically have 3-6 bars of pressure.|$|R
40|$|If {{fuel cell}} {{technology}} – with its inherent benefits of high efficiency and low emissions – {{is to be}} used in decentralised power sources, in mobile or transportation applications, the systems {{have to be able to}} adapt to fast load changes and varying operating conditions. In order to achieve such performance, the balance of plant systems – typically governed by an on-board system controller – need to dynamically supply the fuel cell stack with reactant gases at the right flow rates, pressures and humidities while keeping the fuel cell at its correct operating temperature. Since best overall system performance is achieved by using model-based controllers, an appropriate model is required to implement such controllers. This thesis provides a control-oriented state space model for a PEM fuel cell system. The model describes the effects of a user interaction with any of the balance of plant actuators on overall system performance. The system model is elaborated in a two-step process. In a first step, an analytical, steady state, cell-averaged, isothermal fuel cell stack model is developed. The model predicts the fuel cell voltage and membrane water content as a function of the stack's operating conditions – i. e. reactant flow rates, pressures and humidities as well as cell temperature. It provides an analytical expression to the overall water transport within the fuel cell stack. In the second step, dynamic state space models are developed for the balance of plant systems. They link the effects of the auxiliary systems' actuators to the evolution of the operating conditions for the fuel cell stack. In the context of this thesis, state space models for <b>a</b> <b>non-pressurised</b> air supply subsystem, for a recirculating, pressurised hydrogen supply subsystem and for a liquid cooled thermal management subsystem are elaborated. A dedicated fuel cell test bench has been developed that was used to experimentally validate the proposed models...|$|R
40|$|Colloid probe atomic force {{microscopy}} (AFM) was utilised {{to quantify}} the cohesive forces of salbutamol sulphate in <b>a</b> model <b>non-pressurised</b> fluorinated liquid (mHFA), {{in the presence of}} increasing concentrations of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG; molecular weight (MW) 200, 400 and 600). In addition, samples of PEG 400 (0. 05 - 0. 5 %, v/w), were analysed in the presence of 0. 001 % (w/w) of poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP). In the absence of any stabilizing agents, strong attractive forces were present between particles. Increasing the concentration of the different MW PEG solutions in the mHFA system (up to 0. 5 %, v/w), significantly decreased the force of interaction (ANOVA, p 0. 05). Clearly, an understanding of the conformation of polymer molecules at interfaces is of vital importance when controlling the stability/flocculation behaviour of sterically stabilized pMDI suspensions. In this context, the use of the colloid probe AFM technique has provided a quantitative insight into the interactions of these complex systems and may be an invaluable asset during the early phase of formulation product development.

40|$|Why {{preserve}} bamboos? Bamboos are {{a natural}} material and under natural conditions will gradually decay. If {{they are used}} as structural components {{they will need to}} be replaced after a period of time. The costs of this may prove prohibitive and the status of the bamboo will need constant monitoring to determine when it needs to be replaced. Preserving bamboos extends their life, reduces costs in the long run and improves safety of the structures they are used to form. What are sap displacement preservation methods? Sap displacement methods replace the sap in the vessels of a fresh bamboo culm with preservative. The culms are then left to stand for two weeks in order that the preservative can diffuse into the surrounding tissues and the preserving salts can be fixed in the cells. Sap displacement can be done by using natural capillary action or by one of a small range of simple pressurised techniques. What is the role of a sap displacement preservation unit in rural development? The unit itself offers employment opportunities to its employees and to many people in its forward and backward linkages. The unit can only treat freshly harvested bamboos and so a source of bamboos near to the unit is required. Local bamboo plantations can be established to supply the unit and create further income generating opportunities. Bamboos can be intercropped with food plants and the plantations can thereby increase the food security of the rural people that manage them. How do I establish a sap displacement unit? A sap displacement preservation unit can be established very cheaply. The only requirements are a supply of freshly harvested bamboos, labour and information from the secondary processors of their requirements. If a pressurised unit is to be established then a source of energy for the compressor will be needed. A pressurised unit capable of treating 50 bamboos per day can be established for USD $ 500, including <b>a</b> compressor, and <b>non-pressurised</b> units can be established for considerably less. Preserving bamboos extends their life, reduces costs in the long run and improves safety of the structures they are used to for...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Neuromuscular {{disorders}} (NMDs) cause wasting and {{weakening of}} muscles. People affected by NMDs and their carers can experience {{a number of}} adverse psychosocial consequences, which can be exacerbated by the rare nature {{of many of these}} disorders. This makes access to medical information, timely diagnoses, supportive care and peer support difficult. Options for receiving peer support are increasing through the development of online support groups (OSGs) for people affected by NMDs. Aims: This thesis examined the role of a new OSG in facilitating online peer support for people affected by NMDs and their carers. This was carried out using two distinct, but inter-related, studies. The first study examined the various ways in which members used the message board facility. The second of these studies accessed members’ personal experiences of using this OSG. Methods: In order to examine how members used this new OSG, the first study involved an inductive thematic analysis of OSG message postings. Message postings from the first five months of this OSG’s existence (n= 1, 914) were analysed, so as to identify the main thematic content of members’ discussions. The second study accessed participants’ personal accounts of their OSG experiences. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with six OSG members and were analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). This interview element examined the context through which members decided to use the group, factors that contributed to their continued use of the group, and the personal impact of participation. Results: The OSG message postings analysis demonstrated how members created a sense of community spirit by establishing common ground through disclosing personal information, searching for connections with people with similar illness experiences or interests, welcoming new members, and sharing aspirations {{for the development of a}} resourceful community. Experiences, emotional reactions and support were shared in relation to: delayed diagnosis; symptom interpretation; illness management and progression; and the sense of isolation incurred when managing a rare disorder. The board was also used to discuss societal and political issues pertaining to living with an NMD and methods of raising awareness of such conditions. The results of the interview study showed the valued connection that the OSG gave participants to similar others, in <b>a</b> friendly, <b>non-pressurised</b> environment. Members especially valued the reassurance of knowing that they were not alone in coping with their often-rare condition. The group provided participants with an understanding audience: a rare experience for a group whose condition is not widely known or understood. The information exchanged on the OSG was appreciated due to its specificity in dealing with NMDs. The board was also considered an important platform for raising awareness of NMD-related issues. The gratifying experience of helping other NMD sufferers was highlighted as a key theme. Participants also felt that the OSG was not without its limitations. Difficulties in relating to other people (because of varying disability levels, different disease progression histories, and different views on politics and other interests) influenced participants’ levels of interaction and the perceived benefits of the group. Less common concerns for the group – but important for some individuals – were privacy concerns in using a publicly accessible group and difficulty navigating through the message postings. Conclusions: This thesis provides a novel, in-depth insight into how people used a new OSG for NMDs, and the personal impact of participating in such a group. Analyses of message posting and interview data highlight the vital psychosocial support provided by the OSG, especially given the rarity of many of these conditions. However, it was found that some obstacles to support are inherent in the OSG itself, tempering assessments of the impact of its use. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
