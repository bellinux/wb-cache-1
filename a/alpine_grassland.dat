5|$|The park {{is an area}} of rich highveld and montane {{grassland}} flora. It {{has more}} than sixty grass species and a large variety of bulbs and herbs. Each of these species has its own flowering time, meaning that veld flowers can be seen throughout the summer. The park also has Afromontane forests and high-altitude Austro-Afro <b>alpine</b> <b>grassland,</b> which is scarce in South Africa. The ouhout (Leucosidea sericea), an evergreen species, is the most common tree in the park. Ouhout is a favourite habitat of beetles and 117 species occur on these trees in the park. The Lombardi poplars and weeping willows in the park are introduced species, but are kept because of their cultural and historic connection with the eastern Free State. Other exotic species in the park, for example wattle and bluegum, are systematically eradicated.|$|E
2500|$|Due to {{the various}} climates, {{the state has a}} wide variety of flora. 609,000 {{hectares}} is covered in tree, most of which is in the temperate and cold climates of the state. [...] In the extreme southwest of the state, rainforests can be found and desert plants in the Hidalgo border area. In the highest altitudes, such as the peak of the Nevada de Toluca, <b>alpine</b> <b>grassland</b> can be found. In the extreme west, there are forests which receive thousands of monarch butterflies each winter.|$|E
2500|$|The Keglsugl route {{involves}} {{climbing up}} {{and through a}} mountain rain forest and then along an <b>alpine</b> <b>grassland</b> glacial valley to the twin lakes of Piunde and Aunde.

Though not a technical climb, various sections can be treacherous in wet weather. [...] The climb is usually started during the night; the ascent and subsequent descent can take anywhere from nine to 24 hours.

40|$|Net primary {{production}} (NPP) {{is a fundamental}} process of natural ecosystems. Temporal variation of NPP not only reflects how communities respond to environmental fluctuations, {{but it also has}} important implications for regional carbon assessment. Unfortunately, studies based on field measurements to directly address this issue in the extreme environment of <b>alpine</b> <b>grasslands</b> are rare. In this study, we measured aboveground NPP (ANPP) and species richness in 40 sites across the Tibetan <b>alpine</b> <b>grasslands</b> from 2006 to 2009 to investigate the regional pattern of temporal variation in ANPP and to quantify the effects of climate fluctuation and biodiversity on this variation. The results showed that, during the 4 -year period, the average ANPP varied 1. 5 -fold, from 83. 9 to 125. 7 g m − 2, with a mean coefficient of variation of temporal variation of 36. 6 % across the 40 sites. Compared with other studies, <b>alpine</b> <b>grasslands</b> are not more sensitive to climate fluctuations than other grassland types. Aboveground NPP exhibited synchronous temporal variation and consistent spatial patterns over the 4 -year period due to the regionally similar climatic fluctuations caused by monsoon-dominated plateau climate. Surprisingly, rainfall fluctuation had a more profound effect on the ANPP dynamics than temperature variation, which suggests that production in the Tibetan <b>alpine</b> <b>grasslands</b> is primarily driven by precipitation. Therefore, ANPP in the Tibetan <b>alpine</b> <b>grasslands</b> are mainly constrained by water availability. Finally, we found a reduction in interannual variation (i. e., CV) in ANPP with increasing species richness of plant communities, suggesting that diversity can stabilize community production in high-altitude grasslands...|$|R

40|$|Dwarf pine (Pinus mugo) is a {{successful}} pioneer tree, but also an invader of the subalpine belt in Central-European mountains. In the Hrubý Jeseník Mts. (Czech Republic), dwarf pine was introduced {{at the end of}} the 19 th century by humans into alpine communities. To analyse the influence of non-native woody species on species diversity, vegetation composition and the ecological bioindication of invaded alpine communities, three habitats (non-invaded <b>alpine</b> <b>grasslands,</b> gaps of <b>alpine</b> <b>grasslands</b> within dwarf pine stands and closed dwarf pine stands) were compared at two localities (Keprník, Tabulové kameny) using the space-for-time substitution approach. Plant species composition was assessed by means of phytosociological relevés, and bioindication by means of Ellenberg indicator values. At both localities, both beta and gamma diversity were lower, and species composition more uniform in dwarf pine plantations in contrast to the gaps within and <b>alpine</b> <b>grasslands</b> outside of dwarf pine stands. At Keprník, alpha diversity was lower in the dwarf-pine plantation than outside of it, while at Tabulové kameny no significant differences were found. This is probably due to the somewhat different spatial structure of the dwarf pine stands and the different timing of dwarf pine introduction at these localities. Bioindication showed that dwarf-pine stands were drier, more shaded and had a higher soil fertility than <b>alpine</b> <b>grasslands.</b> Dwarf pine colonisation of <b>alpine</b> <b>grasslands</b> causes the extinction of many endangered plant species, complicating conservation goals. Because of the limited size of alpine areas, changes caused by dwarf pine in medium-high mountains might be more significant than in mountains with large alpine forest-free areas...|$|R

40|$|Vertical {{patterns}} of soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN) and C:N stoichiometry are crucial for understanding biogeochemical cycles in high-altitude ecosystems, but remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated vertical distributions of SOC and TN {{as well as}} their stoichiometric relationships in <b>alpine</b> <b>grasslands</b> on the Tibetan Plateau using data of 405 profiles surveyed from 135 sites across the plateau during 2001 – 2004. Our results showed that, both SOC and TN in <b>alpine</b> <b>grasslands</b> decreased with soil depth, while C:N ratio did not exhibit significant change along soil profile. The associations of SOC and TN content (amount per area) with environmental factors diminished with soil depth. Soil carbon content was nearly proportional to nitrogen content with a slope of 1. 04 across various various grassland types. The slope did not differ significantly between alpine steppe and alpine meadow or between <b>alpine</b> <b>grasslands</b> and global ecosystems, and also did not reveal significant differences among various soil depth intervals, suggesting that soil carbon-nitrogen coupling is irrespective of ecosystem types and soil depths...|$|R
40|$|Purpose Natural {{rates of}} soil {{production}} or a target soil thickness that allows unrestricted land use {{can serve as}} a basis for defining tolerable soil erosion rates. Guidelines for tolerable soil erosion rates in <b>alpine</b> <b>grasslands</b> do not yet exist, partly {{due to the lack of}} information of soil formation and production rates. We (i) defined soil formation/production rates for <b>alpine</b> <b>grasslands</b> on siliceous lithology and compared them to measured and modelled soil erosion rates and resulting soil thickness with a special focus on the Urseren Valley (Central Swiss Alps) and (ii) discussed possible trends for alpine soils under global change. Materials and methods Ranges of soil formation, production and erosion rates were determined using published and our own data for <b>Alpine</b> <b>grasslands</b> soils. Two definitions of tolerable erosion rate were used: when (i) current soil depth remains constant over time; and (ii) at least a minimum soil depth is maintained (minimum thicknesses for individual land uses still need to be defined).
