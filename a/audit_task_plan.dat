40|$|It {{is widely}} {{held that the}} auditor's {{experience}} {{is the most important}} factor leading to the development and organization of the auditor's knowledge base (Waller and Felix 1984; Gibbins 1984). This study extends prior research by examining knowledge differences between auditors with similar amounts of public accounting experience (general domain experience) but with differing specific audit experiences and training. The study examines the association between experience and training and the auditors knowledge of the effectiveness of internal control and audit procedures to prevent and detect potential misstatements of financial statements. This particular knowledge is important in the performance of audit risk assessment and <b>audit</b> <b>planning</b> <b>tasks.</b> Risk assessment and <b>audit</b> <b>planning</b> <b>tasks</b> are important tasks that auditors begin to perform early in their auditing careers. In order to test these relationships, 60 subjects with approximately one to two years of public accounting experience performed a knowledge retrieval task to assess their knowledge of the relationship between common financial statement misstatements and the control and audit procedures that would prevent or detect those misstatements. Self-reported measures of public accounting experience and estimates of experience and training relevant to various industries and audit activities were collected to develop measures of task-relevant experience and training. The resulting evidence of this study provides limited support that differences in audit-cycle experience results in differences in the auditor's knowledge of effective internal control procedures. The study also provides evidence that the knowledge of the relationships between internal control and audit procedures and potential misstatements to financial statements is acquired, at least in part, prior to obtaining significant experience in performing <b>audit</b> <b>planning</b> <b>tasks...</b>|$|R

40|$|Corporate Governance {{is vital}} to the {{survival}} of any corporation. Because of its immense importance in both developed and developing countries, many recent studies noticed the need to enhance corporate governance in developing countries. Considering the case of Lebanon where corporate governance is not legally enforced, companies tend to neglect the importance of maintaining quality corporate governance. Several recent studies suggested the importance of existing interactions among the major components of corporate governance in any corporation and internal audits. This thesis seeks to explore the effects of corporate governance components’ on internal <b>audit</b> <b>tasks</b> in medium-Large corporations in the Lebanese financial sector. The results showed that corporate governance components affect internal <b>audit</b> <b>tasks.</b> When the components are considered separately, top management and audit committee are found to have significant influences on the internal <b>audit</b> <b>tasks</b> whereas internal <b>audit</b> <b>tasks</b> are less influenced by external auditors and board of directors. On the other hand, when the four corporate governance components are jointly considered, their combined effect on internal <b>audit</b> <b>tasks</b> revealed that top management, audit committee, and external auditors significantly influence internal <b>audit</b> <b>tasks.</b> N/A 1 hard copy: x, 66 leaves; col. ill.; 30 cm. available at RNL.

This survey, propose a new scheme called a novel privacy-preserving mechanism which supports public auditing on shared data stored in the cloud. In particular, this scheme takes advantage of ring signatures to compute verification metadata. The ring signature scheme is needed to audit the correctness of shared data. With this mechanism, {{the identity of the}} signer on each block in shared data is kept secret or private from public verifiers. Public verifiers are one who are able to efficiently verify shared data integrity without retrieving the entire file. In addition, this mechanism is able to perform multiple <b>auditing</b> <b>tasks</b> simultaneously instead of single <b>auditing</b> <b>task.</b> This survey shows the effectiveness and efficiency of our mechanism when auditing shared data integrity.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} whether expert knowledge developed for one <b>audit</b> <b>task</b> can be transferred to a different <b>audit</b> <b>task.</b> Knowledge transfer refers to the situation in which knowledge developed for one task will aid decision making performance in another task (Singley 2 ̆ 6 Anderson 1989). Transfer of knowledge occurs to the extent that common elements exist in the tasks (Singley 2 ̆ 6 Anderson 1985). This dissertation provides an analysis of the going concern judgment and the loan credit review judgment. An auditor is required to assess the financial viability of an individual firm in both tasks. The existence of this common element suggests that certain loan credit review knowledge may transfer to the going concern judgment. ^ The results of an experimental task administered to 60 in-charge accountants indicate that financial service auditors with loan credit review experience are more accurate than manufacturing auditors without loan credit review experience in their evaluations of 2 ̆ 2 substantial doubt 2 ̆ 2 made for the two firms in the novel industry context. For the two firms in the manufacturing industry context, there was no statistical difference between the accuracy of financial service auditors and manufacturing auditors. Moreover, the four evaluations of 2 ̆ 2 substantial doubt 2 ̆ 2 were completed by financial service auditors in significantly less time. Overall, these results suggest that certain loan credit review knowledge transfers to aid going concern decision making performance. ^ The results have both theoretical and practical implications. From a theoretical perspective, the results show that certain types of knowledge can be transferred across <b>tasks</b> within <b>auditing.</b> In so doing, this study is the first to identify such transfer within auditing (Davis 2 ̆ 6 Solomon 1989; Bedard 2 ̆ 6 Chi 1993). From a practical perspective, the results reveal one way that an audit firm can improve the utilization of its existing firm knowledge. There may be other situations where knowledge developed for one <b>audit</b> <b>task</b> will transfer and aid judgment performance in another <b>audit</b> <b>task.</b> Thus, these results may provide the impetus for future knowledge transfer investigations. ...|$|R

However, the traditional heuristic strategies depend on the concrete tasks, which often affect the result's optimality.

The simulations and analysis show the feasibility and adaptability of the proposed approach especially for the situation with randomly occurring observation requests...|$|R
