5|$|Morrow {{opened his}} {{practice}} in Lexington. He established his reputation {{in one of}} his first casesthe trial of William Moseby, a black man accused of murder. Moseby's first trial had ended in a hung jury, but because the evidence against him included a confession (which he later recanted), most observers believed he would be convicted in his second trial. Unable to find <b>a</b> <b>defense</b> <b>lawyer</b> for Moseby, the judge in the case turned to Morrow, who as a young lawyer was eager for work. Morrow proved that his client's testimony had been extorted; he had been told that a lynch mob waited outside the jail for him, but no such mob had ever existed. Morrow further showed that other testimony against his client was false. Moseby was acquitted September 21, 1902.|$|E

500|$|During college Marshall {{joined the}} Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, participated in {{literary}} and debating societies, and founded a Democratic Club.

Marshall traveled to Indianapolis in search of <b>a</b> <b>defense</b> <b>lawyer</b> and employed future United States President Benjamin Harrison, then a prominent lawyer in the area. Harrison had the suit dropped by showing that the charges made by Marshall were probably true. In Marshall's memoir, he wrote that when he approached Harrison to pay his bill, his lawyer informed him that he would not charge him for the service, but instead gave him a lecture on ethics.|$|E
500|$|Chulip {{opens with}} a dream {{sequence}} in which the unnamed, male protagonist kisses the girl he loves under the talking [...] "Lover's Tree" [...] on a green hill. The dream takes its course, the tree ends the sequence saying they lived happily ever after. However, once the protagonist wakes up, {{he and his father}} are just moving into Long Life Town, which appears very much like a small, Japanese village. Coincidentally, the girl of his dreams lives in this town, but she flatly rejects him due to his status as coming from a very poor family. Taking his father's advice, the hero decides to kiss the odd citizens of the town in order to strengthen his heart and improve his reputation. En route to doing so, he also resolves to write a love letter to his crush. When this treasured set of papers is stolen, he must search Long Life Town for the missing pieces.

Once the three pieces of the love letter (the ink, paper, and pen) are collected, he writes and mails it to the girl. The game's ending shows the two meeting and kissing beneath the Lover's Tree, as the protagonist had dreamed.|$|E

2500|$|And again {{following}} the Japanese system, in 1937 {{a new category}} of [...] "thought crime" [...] was introduced declaring that certain thoughts were now illegal and those thinking these forbidden thoughts were [...] "thought criminals". People were thus convicted not for their actions, but merely for their thoughts. After the war with China began in July 1937, an [...] "emergency law" [...] was declared in Manchukuo, placing it under a type of martial law that suspended the theoretical civil liberties that existed up to that point, ordered the mobilization of society for total war, and increased the tempo of repression with the law on [...] "thought crimes" [...] being merely the most dramatic example. In April 1938, {{a new type of}} Special Security Courts were created for those charged with the five types of [...] "thought crime". On 26 August 1941, a new security law ruled that those tried before the Special Security Courts had no right of appeal or to <b>a</b> <b>defense</b> <b>lawyer.</b> One Special Security Court in Jinzhou between 1942-45 sentenced about 1, 700 people to death and another 2, 600 for life imprisonment for [...] "thought crimes", a figure that appears to be typical of the special courts. Torture was frequently employed by the police to obtain confessions and those tried in the Special Security Courts had no right to examine the evidence against them. Starting in 1943 the number of those tried and convicted by the courts rose drastically, through the number of death sentences remained stable. The {{rise in the number of}} convictions was due to the need for slave labor for the factories and mines of Manchukuo as the traditional supplies of slave labor from northern China were disturbed by World War II as most of those convicted were sentenced to work in the factories and mines. The American historian Thomas David Dubois wrote the legal system of Manchukuo went through two phrases: the first lasting from 1931 to 1937, when the Japanese wanted to show the world a state with an ultra-modern legal system that was meant to be a shinning tribute to Asians working together in brotherhood; and the second from 1937 to 1945 when the legal system become more of a tool for the totalitarian mobilization of society for total war.|$|E
