40|$|Artificial {{muscles are}} of {{practical}} interest, but few types have been commercially exploited. Typical problems include slow response, low strain and force generation, short cycle life, use of electrolytes, and low energy efficiency. We have designed guest-filled, twist-spun carbon nanotube yarns as electrolyte-free muscles that provide fast, high-force, large-stroke torsional and tensile actuation. More {{than a million}} torsional and tensile actuation cycles are demonstrated, wherein a muscle spins a rotor at an average 11, 500 revolutions/minute or delivers 3 % tensile contraction at 1200 cycles/minute. Electrical, chemical, or photonic excitation of hybrid yarns changes guest dimensions and generates torsional rotation and contraction of the yarn host. Demonstrations include torsional motors, contractile muscles, and sensors that capture {{the energy of the}} sensing process to mechanically actuate. Theconcept of deploying strong carbon nano-tube yarns as actuators has produced bothelectrochemically and thermally powered yarn muscles. The performance of electrochemically powered yarnmuscles (1, 2) is adversely affected for most applications by the need for electrolyte, counter electrode, and device packaging, which add much more to actuator weight and volume than the <b>actuat...</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{recent times}} direct {{integration}} of ferroelectrics on silicon wafer has been attracting interest [1]. Electrophoretic deposition (EPD) {{was investigated in}} this laboratory [2] as an alternative mean to produce lead zirconate titanate (PZT) film on silicon wafers followed by sintering at 850 - 950 °C. EPD is an easily implemented deposition technique that requires only basic laboratory gear and a sufficiently stable colloidal suspension to produce ceramic and electroceramic films with thickness in the 100 nm - 10 mm range 3. It {{has been found that}} the EPD of niobium-doped lead zirconate titanate (PZTN), performed in ethanol-based suspensions of PZT on bare silicon wafers on which Al/Si alloyed ohmic contacts were made, produced smooth green films that strongly pinned to the silicon substrate after sintering. Thick and well-adhered sintered PZT films on silicon having thickness about 50 µm were thus obtained. Such structures could be the core of novel on-chip sensors/actuators. The results of the production of thick PZT films by EPD and sintering and some characterizations of the same are reported. [1] M. Y. Gureev, A. K. Tangatsev, N.

Luong ### Abstract A rapid {{one-step}} kinetics-based sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) procedure {{has been}} developed for highly-sensitive detection of C-reactive protein (CRP) in less than 30 min. With minimal process steps, the procedure is highly simplified and cost-effective. The analysis only involves sequentially {{the formation of a}} sandwich immune complex on capture anti-CRP antibody (Ab) -bound Dynabeads, followed by two magnet-assisted washings and an enzymatic reaction. The developed immunoassay (IA) detected CRP in the dynamic range of 0. 3 - 81 ng mL- 1 with a limit of detection and analytical sensitivity of 0. 4 ng mL- 1 and 0. 7 ng mL- 1. Its analytical precision for analysis of CRP spiked in diluted human serum, whole blood, and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) plasma samples of patients was validated by conventional ELISA, unravelling its immense potential for in vitro diagnostics (IVD). ### Introduction As the gold standard for the detection of CRP in clinical diagnostics, ELISA exhibits high-throughput, excellent reproducibility, high precision and remarkable sensitivity. Last five decades have accumulated over 300, 000 peer-reviewed articles related to ELISA. In particular, the last decade has also witnessed considerable advances in diversified CRP assay formats (1 - 22), lateral flow (20), immunoturbidimetry (1, 11), surface plasmon resonance (14), piezoresistive cantilever-based IA (10), chemiluminescent IA (3), impedimetry (23), electrochemistry 17, reflectometric interference spectroscopy 19, microfluidics (7) and homogenous bead-based IA (24). In general, most of these assay formats are based on a complex procedure comprising of many process steps with a lengthy analysis time (25 - 28). Therefore, there is uttermost importance for the development of rapid and cost-effective IA procedures with high precision and minimal process steps to guide healthcare professionals to decide on the desired intervention at an early stage. CRP, a pentameric protein with a molecular weight of 118 kDa, is a member of a class of acute-phase reactants indicating activation of innate and adaptive immunity (13, 29, 30). It {{plays an important role in}} host defense by binding to phosphocholine and related microbial molecules. As an early indicator of infectious or inflammatory conditions (31, 32), CRP is usually elevated in patients with neonatal sepsis (33 - 35), meningitis, pancreatitis, pneumonia and pelvic inflammatory disease and occult bacteremia. The significantly elevated serum CRP levels are associated with malignant diseases, bacterial infections and correlate with increased 30 -day mortality rates in hospitalized patients (36). The monomeric CRP binds to the surface of damaged cells and platelets, thereby activating the complement cascade that plays an important role in inflammation. The American Heart Association/Center for Disease Control has considered CRP as the best inflammatory marker for clinical diagnosis (37). The precise and rapid determination of human C-reactive protein (CRP) is essential for diagnosis and management of neonatal sepsis (33 - 35, 38, 39), cardiovascular diseases (40 - 44), infectious/inflammatory conditions (31) and diabetes (45 - 47). The ability for repeated CRP measurements with high precision in an acute setting provides clinicians with the valuable information to assess disease diagnosis and circumvent any unnecessary administration of antibiotics. The normal CRP levels in human serum are usually below 10 µg mL- 1 30 but up to 350 - 400 µg mL- 1 in several disease states. The CRP levels in the ranges of 10 - 40 µg mL- 1, 40 - 200 µg mL- 1, and > 200 µg mL- 1 are the indicators of mild or chronic inflammation and viral infections; acute inflammation and bacterial infections; and severe bacterial infections and burns, respectively (30). The CRP levels beyond the cut-off point of 5 µg mL- 1 are indicative of neonatal sepsis, which is diagnosed based on the determination of two CRP concentration ranges normal (0. 2 - 480 µg mL- 1) and high sensitivity (0. 08 - 80 µg mL- 1) 30. The high sensitivity CRP assay is performed first, but the normal CRP assay is also performed if the CRP levels are > 80 µg mL- 1. The existing analytical techniques for the determination of CRP have limitations in terms of prolonged IA duration and lower analytical sensitivity, as reviewed recently by Algarra et al. (22). The clinical laboratory-based CRP assays, based on latex agglutination or nephelometry, and phosphocholine and O-phosphorylethanolamine based immunoassays can detect CRP only in the detection range of µg mL- 1. On the other hand, the recently developed immunoassay formats, based on electrochemical techniques, nanoparticles, nanocomposites, chemiluminescence, total internal reflection and micromosiac immunoassays, have higher sensitivities in the range of ng mL- 1 to µg mL- 1. Similarly, the surface plasmon resonance based real-time and label-free immunoassay formats have sensitivity between ng mL- 1 to g mL- 1. Therefore, there is a critical need for a highly simplified, cost-effective, precise and highly sensitive IA format for the rapid detection of CRP. We have developed a rapid one-step kinetics-based sandwich ELISA procedure (48) (Figure 1) to detect CRP in human whole blood and serum in less than 30 min. It has critically reduced the IA duration by more than 12 -fold and the analysis cost by 2. 5 -fold in comparison to the conventional procedure. This novel ELISA format required also significantly reduced number of process steps and only two washing steps in comparison to the conventional counterpart (Table S 1). Moreover, the high analytical precision of the developed procedure implies its tremendous potential for rapid analyte detection in clinical and bioanalytical settings. ### Materials 1.

The developed ELISA is cost-effective and highly-simplified as attested by the minimal process steps and 2. 5 -fold reduced IA components in comparison to the conventional ELISA procedure (Tables S 1, S 2). It detects 0. 3 - 81. 0 ng mL- 1 of CRP with linearity in the range of 1 - 81 ng mL- 1 (Figure 2 A). LOD, analytical sensitivity and correlation coefficient (R 2) are determined to be 0. 4 ng mL- 1, 0. 7 ng mL- 1, and 0. 998, respectively (Table S 2). The intraday and interday variability determined from five assay repeats (in triplicate) in a single day and five consecutive days, respectively, are in the ranges of 0. 7 - 10. 8 and 1. 6 - 11. 2, respectively. The developed ELISA can detect the entire pathophysiological range of hsCRP from 3 - 80 µg mL- 1 in human whole blood and serum after appropriate dilution, as demonstrated by the detection of CRP spiked in diluted whole blood and plasma (Figure 2 A). It has high specificity for CRP, as demonstrated by the use of various experimental process controls (Figure 2 B) that shows no detectable interference with the immunological reagents. The optimum duration for the formation of the sandwich immune complex by the one-step kinetics-based procedure is 15 min, while the optimum number of magnet-assisted washings thereafter is only two (Figure S 1). The developed and conventional sandwich ELISAs have the same analytical precision for the detection of CRP in diluted whole blood and serum as the results are in agreement with each other (Table 2). The percentage recovery for the CRP-spiked diluted human whole blood is in the range of 93. 3 - 107. 0 and 94. 0 - 103. 3 for the developed and conventional sandwich ELISAs, respectively. Similarly, the percentage recovery for CRP-spiked diluted human serum ranges from 103. 3 - 108. 0, compared to 93. 3 - 113. 0 for the developed and conventional sandwich ELISAs, respectively. The results obtained for the detection of CRP in the EDTA plasma samples of patients by the developed ELISA are also in good agreement with those obtained by the conventional ELISA (Table 3). The anti-CRP capture Ab-bound Dynabeads® can be stored for more than 4 months at 4 ºC without compromising the CRP detection response (Figure 2 C). The production variability for the preparation of anti-CRP capture Ab-bound Dynabeads®, using the same lots of Dynabeads® and anti-CRP capture Ab, is less than 3 percent (Figure 2 D). Moreover, the developed ELISA using SA-HRP/biotinylated anti-CRP Ab conjugate is similar to the variant of the developed ELISA procedure that employs the two-step binding of biotinylated anti-CRP Ab and SA-HRP (Figure S 2 A). The one-step kinetics-based sandwich ELISA solution (comprising anti-CRP capture Ab-bound Dynabeads® and biotinylated anti-CRP detection Ab preconjugated to SA-HRP, stored at 4 ºC in BSA-preblocked MTPs) exhibited no noticeable decrease in its functional activity for up to 4 weeks (Figure S 2 B). Therefore, taking into account the attributes of the developed generic sandwich ELISA procedure, it can be reliably employed in clinical and bioanalytical settings. Moreover, it has immense potential for the development of novel and fully automated rapid IVD kits in combination with lab-on-a-chip technologies, microfluidics, nanotechnology and smart system integration. ### Figures **Figure 1 : Schematic of the protocol** ![Figure 1]([URL] "Figure 1 ") One-step kinetics-based sandwich ELISA procedure for the rapid detection of C-reactive protein (CRP) (48).

The need to develop high-performing methods for OTA analysis able to improve the traditional ones is evident. In this work, through in vitro SELEX (Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment) two aptamers, designated H 8 and H 12 were produced that bind with nanomolar affinity with Ochratoxin A (OTA). Two strategies were investigated by using an indirect and a direct competitive Enzyme-Linked Aptamer Assay (ELAA) and were compared to the classical competitive Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) for the determination of OTA in spiked red wine samples. The limit of detection attained (1 ng/mL), the midpoint value obtained (5 ng/mL) and the analysis time needed (125 min) for the real sample analysis validate the direct competitive ELAA as useful screening tool for routine use in the control of OTA level in wine.

First, the optimal conditions to form the molybdophosphate complex in artificial seawater medium were determined by addition of sulphuric acid and sodium molybdate to the solution containing orthophosphate. Secondly, the anodic oxidation of molybdenum to form molybdate ions and protons was used to create the molybdophosphate complex without addition of any liquid reagents. The molybdophosphate complex is detectable by amperometry with an average precision of 2. 2 % for the concentration range found in the open ocean and the detection limit is 0. 12 mu M. Three solutions are proposed to address the silicate interferences issue and one of these methods is used for the natural samples collected in the coastal waters offshore Peru during the Pelagico 1011 - 12 -BIC OLAYA cruise in November-December 2010. Results showed a good precision with an average of 2. 5 % and a reasonable deviation of the amperometric analysis as compared with colorimetric measurements (4. 9 %). (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.

Initially superhydrophobic TiO 2 nanoparticle coatings {{can be converted}} to hydrophilic by ultraviolet (UVA) light, and fluidic channels can be generated. A simple water treatment after the UVA illumination converts the channels permanent when nanoparticles are removed from the illuminated and wetted areas as shown by water contact angle, FE-SEM, XPS, and ToF-SIMS analysis. This suggests new routes for inexpensive, easy to use point-of-care diagnostics based on planar fluidic channels.

The optrode has high sensitivity and selectivity in the measurement of oxygen concentrations and fluxes at the cellular level. In particular, application of the NMT-OO using the self-referencing method avoids environmental electromagnetic noise and hysteresis/calibration drift, providing extremely high signal-to-noise ratios for measuring biophysical transport. We successfully applied this technique to measure rhizosphere oxygen fluxes and metabolism in intact roots of Arabidopsis plants. The system we describe here is a simple and reliable method for measuring oxygen fluxes in plants and has other broad applications in cytological studies. ### Introduction Oxygen {{is one of the}} most fundamental elements for animals, plants, fungi, and bacterial systems. Real-time measurement of oxygen concentration, transport, and respiration in living cells is crucial to answering physiological questions of development, metabolism, and stress response. There have been significant efforts to measure oxygen transport and metabolism in living cells and tissues (1, 2, 3, 4). Early efforts were based on polarograghic electrochemical approaches where a current is measured as a function of oxygen reduction. These electrode-based methods all face limitations because of susceptibility to electromagnetic interference, convective artifacts, and calibration drift, which create high background noise 5 and a requirement for constant recalibration. It is possible to partially alleviate convective artifacts from the electrode-based methods by reducing the diameter of an electrode and covering the electrode by a gas-permeable membrane (5) but this in turn increases the susceptibility to electromagnetic noise. The self-referencing technique can provide a reliable solution to measuring the analytes flux associated with living cells. To monitor oxygen flux and respiratory activity in single cells or/and tissues, microelectrode-based electrochemical polarographic methods were adapted in the last decade (3, 6, 7, 8). However, the electrochemical microelectrode approach still suffered from experimental artifacts when high sensitivity and accuracy of measurement are required because the electrode sensitivity to electromagnetic noise, fouling, and calibration drift. Therefore, an optical sensor, the so-called optrode (optical electrode), was developed to minimize these disadvantage (9, 10, 11, 12). An optrode is an optical fiber with a specific fluorescence dye (platinum tetrakis pentafluorophenyl porphyrin or PtTFPP in this study), immobilized on the tip of a tapered fiber optic 10. The PtTFPP is excited by blue light (505 nm), and the red emission fluorescence signal (640 nm) is conducted through the fiber and recorded by optical equipment. The concentration of analytes, oxygen in this case, changes the lifetime and intensity of the fluorescence signals (9, 10). These measurable characters of fluorescence signals reflect the concentration of the analyte in a linear relationship (Box 1). The application of an optical fiber prevents corrosion of metallic probes in buffers or physiologic solutions, and the recording of light signals minimizes electromagnetic noise. Furthermore, the measurement of fluorescence duration has significant advantages over measurement of fluorescence intensity, in terms of stability and photobleaching of fluorescence dyes (9, 10). Based on applying the principles of frequency domain lifetime approaches, shifts in the phase angle of fluorescence signals are measured for the NMT-OO system. The NMT can provide non-invasive measurement of the flux of analytes in living cells and tissues. Based on Fick’s law, *we can calculate the flux rate by measuring concentration differences using a microsensor, which oscillates between two positions (ΔX) *, if the diffusion coefficient (*D*) is known (10). In the current study, we used a newly developed oxygen-specific optrode with high sensitivity and a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Furthermore, when using an optrode with NMS, there is no need to use a reference electrode, and thus the system is simple to construct. This construction helps in decreasing experimental artifacts and errors (Box 2). The oxygen transport and respiratory activity of plant cell tissues reflect spatial and temporal information about the physiological responses of cell metabolism and stress responses (11). Here we compared oxygen metabolism and flux rate on the root surface of wild-type (WT) Arabidopsis and mutant lines of the atrbohD/F double mutant, which lacks the expression of membrane-localized NADPH-oxidase, resulting in a reduced rate of root elongation by inhibition of cell expansion and growth (13, 14). We also compared rhizosphere oxygen flux rate in light- and dark-grown Arabidopsis seedlings, which show different elongation rates in the elongation zone (15). These results documented differences in respiratory oxygen flux that correlate with root growth, and confirm the NMT-OO approach as a low-cost, easy-to-use instrument for detecting oxygen transport and metabolism with high sensitivity and a high SNR. The following is a detailed protocol for the complete construction of this optrode-based NMT and measurement of rhizosphere oxygen flux in Arabidopsis seedlings. ### Reagents 1. ½ Murashige and Skoog (½MS) medium (Sigma-Aldrich) with 0. 4 % phytagel (Sigma-Aldrich) containing 1 % sucrose for dark-grown seedlings. Caution! Autoclave after combining to avoid contamination. - ½ MS liquid medium. Caution! The liquid medium contains the same components as the solid medium without phytagel to avoid additional stress. Critical! Wash the optrode with distilled water very carefully, avoiding crystallization of salts and contamination from sucrose. - Calibration medium: ½ MS medium bubbled with pure N 2 (0 % O 2) or air (21 % O 2) in an Erlenmeyer flask, or other kind of container with a narrow neck. Caution! N 2 bubbling should last at least 30 minutes to completely expel the oxygen from the medium. ### Equipment 1. Light-emitting diode (LED) : A LED lamp provides blue light (403 – 405 nm) to excite the fluorescence dye immobilized on the tip of the optrode. - LED power: An amplifier can provide stable voltage signals to the LED light source. In our equipment, we used the SRS 530 amplifier (SRS, USA) as the power supplier. - Laser coupler: A band-pass optical filter (Edmund Optics, USA) prevents nonspecific light reaching the fluorescent dye on the optrode tip. The emitted fluorescent light from the optrode is in the red color range, and thus a red color filter (Edmund Optics) was used in the light path to obtain pure fluorescence signals. LED, LED Power and Laser Coupler were installed by ScienceWares, Inc., MA. - MicroTip-Fiber Optic Oxygen Sensor, World Precision Instruments; Cat. Number 501656 : The fiber sensor is 140 µm long tapering to a sharp sensor tip with a diameter of 50 µm housed inside a steel needle ([URL] Alternatively, the company Ocean Optics Sensors (USA) also provides optical microsensors. (See [URL] Critical! Two types of optrodes are on the market, a tapered tip and flat-broken tip microsensor. The tapered tip optrode provides higher spatial and temporal resolution, while the flat-broken tip optrode has higher light stability. - Optical fiber: Optical fibers guide the light path in this optrode system. No special requirement for the fibers. - Photomultiplier tube (PMT) : The PMT is a special electron tube that can transduct the weak light signals into measureable electric signals via application of the photoelectric effect and secondary emission ability of electrons. A current type of photomultiplier consists of a photoemissive cathode (sensitive to even a single photon) followed by an electron multiplier (in high vacuum) and an electron collector (anode). Several companies provide PMT devices with high sensitivity and high SNR. We combined a PMT (Hamamatsu, Japan) into our system. - PMT power: To obtain constant application and measurement with the PMT, a high voltage power supply is integrated into the system (Optical Signal Processor, YGOO-OSP; YoungerUSA). - Optical device: Any kind of microscope is suitable for the this approach but inverted microscopes are easier to adapt for observation. We used the Olympus IMT 2 microscope in our study. An objective lens with 10 × or 20 × magnification is good for observation. Critical! Water/oil immersion lenses have not been tried out for this experiment. - Non-invasive Micro-test System: The system (BIO-IM, YoungerUSA, US) was constructed as originally descriptions (16, 17). The optrode is moved by a three-dimensional stepper motor (YGOO-LTS，YoungerUSA，USA), that has submicron step resolution. For flux measurements the typical distance is 10 μm. A lock-in amplifier (SR 530 ，SRS，USA) amplifier analyzes the phase angle associated with the fluorescent lifetime of the dye using frequency domain analysis approaches. - Calibration and recording chamber: A small Petri-dish of 5 cm diameter was chosen as a calibration chamber for optrodes and recording experiments. Any transparent container can be used as the chamber. Critical! The edge of the chamber should not be so high as to prevent the microsensor from reaching the samples, and the bottom of the chamber can be specially treated to avoid interfere with microscopic observation. ### Procedure **EQUIPMENT SETUP** Figure 2 shows the schematic diagram of the NMT-OO system in our study. The software, imFLUX (YoungeUSA), controls several basic components of this system by adjusting the power supply, imaging with a digital camera, and managing the main component: the optrodes. The following describes the construction of the measuring system: A LED power supplier controls the voltage signal to a blue LED (503 – 505 nm). A 20 × microscope (Newport, USA) objective focuses light from the LED onto the optical fiber, which is coupled to a blue filter leading the excitation light to the MicroTip-Fiber Optic Oxygen Sensor (World Precision Instruments, USA). Fluorescence emission is conducted by the fibers and split by the fiber coupler again. When the red fluorescence signal reaches the PMT (Hamamatsu, Japan), the signals are transformed into electrical signals and conducted into a Lock-in-Amplifier (SRS 530). Then, the phase shift and fluorescence intensities are recorded by the computer and analyzed by imFLUX (YoungerUSA，USA). **PROCEDURE** Experimental measurements 1. Calibration of the optrode: We calibrated the optrode in the calibration medium with two different concentrations of oxygen (0 and 21 % oxygen). The phase angles of the fluorescence signals of these two concentrations were measured and a linear slope was calculated. ? TROUBLESHOOTING - Equilibration of plant material: The 4 -day-old seedlings were dipped into the measuring buffer (½ MS liquid medium) for 30 minutes before measuring. - Immobilizing the plant material: The measurement of oxygen flux with the optrode occurs in an aqueous environment; therefore, we needed to immobilize the sample to avoiding unwanted stirring, and movement. The method used to immobilize the sample must be gentle enough to prevent mechanical damage to the tissues and allow free access of the optrode to measure the tissue. As shown in Figure 3 a, we used two small pieces of filter paper to clamp the root of Arabidopsis, leaving about 2 – 3 mm of the root tip free for microsensor measurement. ? TROUBLESHOOTING - Adjusting the measuring position of the optrode by a stepper motor: Caution! The tip of the optrode sensor is fragile. Move the optrode gently to avoid breaking the tip. - At each measuring point, the optrode is vibrating between two positions at a distance of 30 μm (Figure 3 a). We set an optimal vibration frequency to avoid stirring and to obtain stable results with 2 seconds of quiet time before measuring and 1. 92 seconds of measurement at each position in our experiments. Thus, time of measurement at each position is 8. 6 seconds at each measuring point. ? TROUBLESHOOTING - Start the measurement with a reference measure by placing the optrode in a background place, i. e., in the medium as far away from the sample as possible (Figure 3 b). When the base level of oxygen flux in the environment is steady at a baseline, move the tip of the optrode to a position near (5 μm) the periphery of the sample root (Figure 3 b). Measurement of oxygen flux in the background position and the rhizophere of Arabidopsis are shown in Figure 3 c. - Based on the aim of the experiment, we can adjust control probe positioning and angle of oscillation. As shown in Figure 4 a, we mapped the oxygen flux rate on the periphery of the root apical region in Arabidopsis. We also analyzed the effect of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) on the oxygen flux rate as shown in Figure 4 b. ### Timing - Steps 1 and 2 : 30 minutes to select an optimal vibration frequency and phase angle for measurement. - Step 3 : Equilibration requires 30 minutes. We can perform this step at the same time as steps 1 and 2. - Step 4 : 5 minutes - Step 5 : 20 minutes. - Steps 6 – 7 : 30 – 45 minutes for a single experiment. ### Troubleshooting Step 1 : - Problem: Large differences in empirical values; - Possible reasons: 1. The calibration medium was not bubbled enough. - 2. Contamination or inactivation at the optrode sensor tip. - Solution: 1. Bubble the medium with N 2 or air for a longer time. - 2. Clean the optrode or use a new one. Step 3 : - Problem: Roots are moving during the measurement. - Possible reasons: The access tip region is too long. - Solution: Leave only 2 – 3 mm of the root tip free. Step 5 : - Problem: Unsettled results. - Possible reasons: 1. The optrode is not fixed properly on the stepper motor. - 2. The quiet time for measurement is too short. - Solution: 1. Fix it tightly. - 2. Prolong the quiet time to avoid possible stirring effects. ### Anticipated Results Roots are heterotrophic tissues in plant bodies, taking up oxygen from the environment for growth and metabolism. The rhizosphere oxygen flux results in a net influx value in experiments (Figure 2 C). As shown in Figure 3 A, the peak oxygen influx value occurred 0. 2 mm back from the root tip, coinciding with the root apical transition zone, which has also a peak value of auxin influx and high cell elongation and development rate (18, 19 20). Lack of NADPH-oxidase results in a reduced root elongation and may alter respiratory activity at the rhizophere of the apical root elongation zone (13, 14). The oxygen influx rate is reduced significantly in the atrbohD/F double mutant (Figure 3 A). Dark-grown seedlings have a low respiratory rate and metabolism at the root meristem and elongation zone (15). Thus, the oxygen influx rate in dark-grown Arabidopsis seedlings is significantly decreased (Figure 3 A). H 2 O 2, a typical ROS signal molecule, also changes the rhizosphere oxygen flux dramatically (Figure 3 B). **CONCLUSION** In conclusion, we describe here a real-time and non-invasive probe system with highly sensitivity for detecting the oxygen flux rate in plant system. ### References 1.
