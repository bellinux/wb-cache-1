5|$|Education of {{the young}} was never {{considered}} to be the primary domain of schools, even after they had become more common. Most education was carried out by a child's parents or foster parents. Formal apprenticeships were not the norm in Plymouth; it was expected that <b>a</b> <b>foster</b> family would teach the children whatever trades they themselves practiced. The church also {{played a central role in}} a child's education. As noted above, the primary purpose of teaching children to read was so that they could read the Bible for themselves.|$|E
5|$|Hu Die had {{an illegitimate}} {{daughter}} named Hu Ruomei (胡若梅), later renamed to Hu Yousong (胡友松), {{who was born}} in 1939. The identity of her father is unknown.

In 1966, Hu Yousong married Li Zongren, who had briefly {{served as president of the}} Republic of China, and was 49 years her senior. After Li Zongren died in 1969, she was persecuted during the Cultural Revolution, and later became a Buddhist nun.|$|E

5|$|Improving {{opportunities}} for growing families of same-sex couples has shaped {{the political landscape}} within the past ten years. A push for same-sex marriage or civil unions in western countries has replaced other political objectives. , ten countries and six U.S. states offer same-sex marriage; civil unions are offered as an option in some European countries, U.S. states and individual municipalities. The ability to adopt domestically or internationally children or provide a home as <b>a</b> <b>foster</b> parent is also a political and family priority for many lesbians, as is improving access to artificial insemination.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after his}} birth, in {{accordance}} with the traditions of the Quraysh, Khalid was sent to a Bedouin tribe in the desert, where <b>a</b> <b>foster</b> mother nursed him and brought him up in the clear, dry and unpolluted air of the desert. At the age of five or six, he returned to his parents in Mecca. During his childhood Khalid suffered a mild attack of smallpox, which he survived, but it left some pockmarks on his left cheek.|$|E
5|$|The Ulster County Department of Social Services {{received}} {{reports from}} neighbors and physicians of Tina Santosky regarding her injuries: a broken femur, bruises, and cuts. Suspecting child abuse, Bernhardt S. Kramer, the Commissioner of the Ulster County Department of Social Services initiated parental neglect proceedings and removed Tina Santosky from {{the custody of}} her parents, John and Annie Santosky, in November 1973. 10 months later, the Santoskys' second child, John II, was removed after he {{was found to be}} suffering from malnutrition. On that same day, Annie Santosky gave birth to Jed, the couple's third child. Three days after Jed's birth, he was removed from their custody and placed in <b>a</b> <b>foster</b> home.|$|E

5|$|According to Clan MacLeod tradition, Leod {{inherited}} {{some of his}} lands from <b>a</b> <b>foster</b> father, who was {{a sheriff}} of the Hebridean island of Skye; other lands he inherited from his father-in-law, {{who was also a}} lord on Skye. MacLeod tradition also states that Leod was the father of four sons and two daughters. Two of these sons founded the two main branches of MacLeods; branches which exist to this day—Tormod (from whom the MacLeods of Harris and Dunvegan descend) and Torquil (from whom the MacLeods of Lewis descend). The traditional belief that Torquil was a son has also been challenged; the current understanding is that he was a great-grandson of Leod. In recent years, the DNA evidence of men bearing surnames equating to MacLeod has revealed that a certain proportion share a common ancestor—an ancestor considered to have been the clan's founder.|$|E
5|$|By 1931, Fraser had {{successfully}} passed her medical examinations and become licensed. Two years later, Fraser became a part-time lecturer {{and then in}} 1934 was promoted to full-time lecturer in the department. Around the same time, in 1933, Williams moved to the farm full-time, returning to Toronto only on weekends. In 1937, she was finally accepted into the Ontario Veterinary College and that same year, Fraser's mother died. Williams graduated in 1941 and she began practicing as a veterinarian. For the first time, the two women acquired a home together, living in Toronto. They took in <b>a</b> <b>foster</b> child, Jenny Rodd, a war refugee from England, who remained with them until the war ended. Rising homophobia during the war-years, which carried into the 1950s and 1960s led the couple to hide the intimate nature of their relationship from their ward and present an ambiguous relationship to the greater society, limiting their social life to those who knew them best.|$|E

5|$|Susanna Paine, born in Rehoboth, Massachusetts on June 9, 1792, was {{the second}} child of James Paine (b. 1764–65) and Mary Chaffee Paine (1767–1849). Her father was a mariner. When {{she was a young}} girl, he was lost at sea. She then lived with her {{maternal}} grandparents, Reverend Jonathan Chaffee and Mary Chaffee. Paine, an excellent student, attended school until she was 11 years of age, when she was needed to help care for her ill grandmother. The following year she nearly died {{as the result of a}} lightning strike that killed the person standing beside her. Believed to have died, she resumed consciousness after one hour, but suffered from seizures for several years after the incident. Her mother married widower Nathaniel Thurber on April 9, 1808, and the combined household, including his four children, moved to <b>a</b> <b>Foster,</b> Rhode Island farm.|$|E
5|$|Shelley, {{who visited}} the toddler Allegra while she was being boarded with a family chosen by Byron, objected to the child's living {{arrangements}} over the years, though he had initially approved of Clairmont's plan to relinquish her to her father. During the summer of 1819, Allegra stayed with four different families and was abandoned by her nursemaid. Byron sent her to stay for long periods with his friend, British consul Richard Belgrave Hoppner, but Hoppner's wife didn't like Allegra and sent her to stay with three other families in as many months. Though he'd originally agreed to permit Clairmont to visit their daughter, Byron reneged on the agreement. Shelley often tried to persuade Byron to let Clairmont see her daughter and they thought of ways to regain custody of her. Clairmont was alarmed by reports in 1820 that her daughter had suffered a malarial-type fever and that Byron had moved her to warm Ravenna {{at the height of}} the summer. Clairmont wrote that Allegra must be moved to a more healthy climate if she was to survive and pleaded with Byron to send their daughter to her in Bagni di Lucca, a town with a cool mountain climate. However, Byron didn't want to send Allegra back to be raised in the Shelley household, where he was sure she'd grow ill from eating a vegetarian diet and would be taught atheism. He pointed out that all of the other children in the Shelley household had died: the Shelleys' first three children had all died young and their fourth child, Elena Adelaide Shelley, died in <b>a</b> <b>foster</b> home in 1820 at age seventeen months.|$|E

25|$|Children {{found to}} be unable to {{function}} in <b>a</b> <b>foster</b> home may be placed in Residential Treatment Centers (RTCs) or other such group homes.

50|$|Unger {{sets out}} the {{following}} key idea: ‘The larger {{goal is a}} fuller mobilisation of national resources: a war economy without <b>a</b> war’, <b>fostering</b> ‘the institutions of a highenergy democracy’.
