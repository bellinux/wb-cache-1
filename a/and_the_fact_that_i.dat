500|$|Starlog {{magazine}} {{reported in}} 1993 that the reception from female fans of Star Trek was mostly negative {{due to the}} manner in which Kamala was presented, while some reviewers offered a similar opinion. Michelle Erica Green, in her review for TrekNation in 2013, praised the chemistry between Stewart and Janssen but called it [...] "a terrible episode, an enormous setback in terms of how Next Gen presents women in the 24th century, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> appreciate several of the performances doesn't mean I don't wish it had never been produced." [...] She questioned that if Kamala's gender was switched about whether the arguments presented in the episode would have remained, and felt it was a missed opportunity to tackle social issues. Keith DeCandido hated the episode in his review for Tor.com in 2012, giving it a score of 2 out of 10, and said that when he first watched it, the episode had left him [...] "seething". He explained that he would [...] "expect a storyline rooted in tiresomely traditional gender roles from a show airing in the late 1960s. Not so much the early 1990s." [...] He said that Janssen was [...] "flat", and did not have any chemistry with Stewart. DeCandido also criticized the Ferengi [...] "at their absolute worst" [...] and the absence of Deanna Troi from the episode.|$|E
500|$|In May2007, Usher {{split with}} Patton as his manager. This {{prompted}} [...] "gossip" [...] that Usher had [...] "fired" [...] {{her because of}} his growing relationship with Foster. He denied the claims, saying, [...] "I love my mother ... I decided not to fire, not get rid of, but to give [...] the ultimate complimentto retire {{her to be a}} full-time grandmother." [...] He continued by stating that the split was a mutual decision. It was speculated that Patton's dismissal was due to his engagement with Foster; Usher dismissed these claims on Total Request Live (TRL) in May2008. In what MTV News' Shawn Adler called an [...] "angry tirade", Usher stated, [...] "My wife {{had nothing to do with}} me firing my mother — nothing like that, that's trash. I hear y'all talking crazy out there. She's a beautiful black woman. Stop. Stop talking. And I love her. Stop it." [...] The outbreak was compared to Mariah Carey's unannounced 2001 appearance on TRL, when she handed out popsicles to the show's audience and performed a [...] "striptease", while some fans noted Usher's speech as evidence that Foster was being controlling of Usher. Usher hired Benny Medina as his new manager; Medina said of Usher, [...] "The thing that excited me most is the intense commitment to his art, his incredible professionalism <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> feel as though he's just hitting a stride." ...|$|E

2500|$|In McManaman's final {{games for}} the club {{in the second half}} of the 1998–99 season, he began turning in mixed performances, with the media accusing him of playing out his final season in a [...] "desultory manner". His form dipped at times, arguably due to a {{combination}} of injuries, being restricted to substitute appearances (as Houllier wanted to cut the side's dependency on his gameplay and replace him), and loss of confidence in certain games where even the home fans turned against him over the contract debacle, with some labelling him a [...] "traitor" [...] and a Judas figure. McManaman told the media after one such game where he became victim of the [...] "boo boys", saying, [...] "That's understandable, when I came off the other day I knew the reaction there was going to be. But I think if they put themselves in the same predicament, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have been at Liverpool for 12 years and that I would like to test myself in a foreign country, that's understandable." ...|$|E
