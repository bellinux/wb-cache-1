5|$|Cèpe des pins ("pine tree cep"; Boletus pinophilus or Boletus pinicola) grows among pine trees. Rarer than B.edulis, {{it is less}} <b>appreciated</b> <b>by</b> gourmets {{than the}} two other kinds of porcini, but remains a {{mushroom}} rated above most others.|$|E
5|$|Hapalopilus nidulans {{is highly}} <b>appreciated</b> <b>by</b> {{those who make}} {{mushroom}} dyes. When used in combination with alkaline fixatives, the fruit bodies can produce striking violet colors.|$|E
5|$|Opposition to the King and his {{marriage}} came from several directions. Edward's desire to modernise the monarchy {{and make it}} more accessible, though <b>appreciated</b> <b>by</b> many of the public, was distrusted by the British Establishment. Edward upset the aristocracy by treating their traditions and ceremonies with disdain, and many were offended by his abandonment of accepted social norms and mores.|$|E

The {{appreciation}} of asset prices, referred to as [...] "positive valuation effects" [...] in this case exactly offsets the current account deficit. At the end of the day, the country's net foreign asset position remains unchanged, despite the $700 billion current account deficit.|$|R
5|$|Reemma Sen as Anitha Pandiyan, an {{intelligence}} officer who gathers {{a team to}} investigate the disappearance of Chandramouli. Anitha is strong-minded, ruthless and determined. However she nurtures a soft feeling for Muthu {{during the course of}} the journey. The film became Reemma Sen's first attempt at parallel cinema following a series of roles in commercial projects, and her portrayal was highly <b>appreciated</b> <b>by</b> film critics.|$|E
5|$|Reitz's {{policies}} were <b>appreciated</b> <b>by</b> the Volksraad, reflecting {{the change in}} the mood of the Afrikaner electorate towards Afrikaner nationalism. Months before the presidential election of 1893 the Volksraad endorsed Reitz's candidature with a vote of forty-three against eighteen. Reitz accepted the endorsement on the condition that he be allowed three months leave to Europe. On 22 November 1893 he was re-elected, again with a landslide majority.|$|E
5|$|Rimsky-Korsakov became {{especially}} appreciated within The Five, {{and among}} those who visited the circle, for his talents as an orchestrator. He was asked by Balakirev to orchestrate a Schubert march for a concert in May 1868, by Cui to orchestrate the opening chorus of his opera William Ratcliff and by Alexander Dargomyzhsky, whose works were greatly <b>appreciated</b> <b>by</b> The Five and who was close to death, to orchestrate his opera The Stone Guest.|$|E
50|$|According to this theory, {{the change}} in the {{exchange}} rate is determined by price level changes in both countries. For example, if prices in the United States rise by 3% and prices in the European Union rise by 1% the purchasing power of the EUR should <b>appreciate</b> <b>by</b> approximately 2% compared to the purchasing power of the USD (equivalently the USD will depreciate by about 2%).|$|R

50|$|This species, {{like many}} other Magnolias, have been used since {{a long time for}} {{furniture}} making, as roundwood (utility poles, wooden sticks and pillars) and as sawtimber (wood boards and scantlings). The wood is fine and commercially <b>appreciates</b> <b>by</b> its dark green color, which might be the reason for its common names of boñigo, almanegra and gallinazo morado. The species also has potential do be used as ornamental.|$|R
5|$|The company started {{producing}} {{bus chassis}} in 1950, and the superstructures were {{built by a}} number of Finnish coach builders. The last models were <b>appreciated</b> <b>by</b> a number of bus operators, and missed after production was stopped. All Vanaja bus chassis were fitted with air brakes by 1958, after the failure of hydraulic brakes on a Vanaja bus had led to one of the worst traffic accidents ever to have happened in Finland.|$|E
5|$|The late Brazilian singer Renato Russo {{included}} an acoustic {{cover of the}} song on his 1994 album The Stonewall Celebration Concert. His version was <b>appreciated</b> <b>by</b> Alvaro Neder of Allmusic. The 2000 compilation album Virgin Voices: A Tribute To Madonna, Vol. 2 contains a cover by worldbeat group Loop Guru. An alternative rock cover of the song by The Prayers was included on the 2007 Madonna tribute compilation Through the Wilderness.|$|E
5|$|The soundtrack was {{composed}} with strong traditional and Irish music influences, while the lyrics for the vocal tracks {{were written by}} the game's director Tetsuya Takahashi and its scenario writer Masato Kato.

5|$|Alfred Eisenack's {{original}} {{description of}} the Chitinozoans placed them in three families, spanning seven genera, based on morphological grounds. Further genera were identified, at first on an annual basis, as time progressed. Since its publication in 1931, Eisenack's original classification has been much honed by these additional discoveries, as well as advances in microscopy. The advent of the scanning electron microscope in the 1970s allowed the improved detection of surface ornamentation which is hugely important in identification - as can be <b>appreciated</b> <b>by</b> {{a comparison of the}} images on this page. Even the light microscope image here is of far greater quality than could have been achieved earlier in the century, using poorly preserved specimens and less advanced microscopes.|$|E
5|$|Almost all of Josquin's motets {{use some}} kind of {{compositional}} constraint on the process; they are not freely composed. Some of them use a cantus firmus as a unifying device; some are canonic; some use a motto which repeats throughout; some use several of these methods. The motets that use canon can be roughly divided into two groups: those in which the canon is plainly designed to be heard and appreciated as such, and another group in which a canon is present, but almost impossible to hear, and seemingly written to be <b>appreciated</b> <b>by</b> the eye, and by connoisseurs.|$|E
5|$|For much of 2009 and 2010, China {{was under}} {{pressure}} from the US to allow the yuan to appreciate. Between June and October 2010, China allowed a 2% appreciation, but there were concerns from Western observers that China only relaxed its intervention when under heavy pressure. The fixed peg was not abandoned until just before the June G20 meeting, after which the yuan <b>appreciated</b> <b>by</b> about 1%, only to devalue slowly again, until further US pressure in September when it again appreciated relatively steeply, just prior to the September US Congressional hearings to discuss measures to force a revaluation.|$|E

50|$|If both {{happened}} simultaneously, then currency A would <b>appreciate</b> <b>by</b> 9% against currency B. This {{was seen}} as excessive, and the Basel agreement in 1972 between the six existing EEC members and three about to join established a snake in the tunnel with bilateral margins between their currencies limited to 2.25%, implying a maximum change between any two currencies of 4.5%, {{and with all the}} currencies tending to move together against the dollar. This agreement also led to the formal end of the Sterling Area.|$|R

5|$|He {{also started}} a {{successful}} private company {{in partnership with}} the older and more experienced Michael Grubb, one of the directors of the SOIC and founder of the first Swedish trading office in Canton. They traded in Canton and Macao, which technically was against the rules and regulations in the charter of the SOIC. Grill took advantage of the fact that his father was a director of the SOIC, and until his father's death shipped his own goods on board SOIC ships. From Europe the ships brought objets d'art, corals from the Mediterranean Sea, expensive clocks and other mechanical automatons known to the Chinese as sing-songs. Such goods were <b>appreciated</b> <b>by</b> the Emperor and the rich mandarins.|$|E
5|$|In the finale, {{the main}} {{characters}} spend the longest {{amount of time in}} the parallel universe to date. The writers sought to emphasize {{the differences between the two}} worlds: Anna Torv created a unique personality and physical demeanor for her character's doppelgänger, Fauxlivia; DC Comics designed special covers based upon some of their classic editions to display in the Other Side. These and other popular culture differences were noted and <b>appreciated</b> <b>by</b> critics, persuading the writers to add more in the third season. The episodes mark the first appearance of recurring character Lincoln Lee (Seth Gabel), as well as the return of actors Leonard Nimoy and Kirk Acevedo as William Bell and Agent Charlie Francis, respectively.|$|E
5|$|It was {{the first}} {{manuscript}} of great importance and antiquity of which any extensive use was made by textual critics, but {{the value of the}} codex was differently <b>appreciated</b> <b>by</b> different writers in the past. Wettstein created a modern system of catalogization of the New Testament manuscripts. Codex Alexandrinus received symbol A and opened the list of the NT uncial manuscripts. Wettstein announced in his Prolegomena ad Novi Testamenti Graeci (1730) that Codex A is the oldest and the best manuscript of New Testament, and should be the basis in every reconstruction of the New Testament text. Codex Alexandrinus became a basis for criticizing the Textus Receptus (Wettstein, Woide, Griesbach).|$|E
50|$|Under these conditions, it’s {{really hard}} to be an entrepreneur. Despite of this, a lot of rural tourism {{accommodations}} have been established in the recent years, {{taking advantage of the}} stretch of that kind of tourism. Sayago offers a really nice landscape that it’s really <b>appreciate</b> <b>by</b> the urban people, consolidated after the declaration of the Arribes del Duero Natural Park, a natural reserve that protects the Duero river canyons. Alongside these accommodations, few restaurants, traditional food or craft shops have opened. This has relieved a little bit the important problem of depopulation.|$|R
30|$|In this research, the Little Miami Scenic Trail has a {{significant}} impact on the market values of nearby homes, when distances to the nearest trail entrance are measured either as Euclidean or network distances. More specifically, by using network distances, results show that decreasing the distance by 1 foot (0.305  m) <b>appreciates</b> property values <b>by</b> 0.00024 %. For our average-priced house of $ 383, 571 in the rail trail corridor, decreasing the distance by 1 foot (meter) is equivalent to an increase in value of $ 0.92 per foot ($ 3.02 per meter). Keeping in mind that our average house is 7859 feet (2395  m) away from its closest trail head, the house would <b>appreciate</b> <b>by</b> 1.89 % ($ 7238) in value, when comparing it to exactly the same house adjacent to the Little Miami Scenic Trail.|$|R
40|$|When {{developing}} countries announce debt relief agreements under the Brady Plan, their stock markets <b>appreciate</b> <b>by</b> {{an average of}} 60 % in real dollar terms—a $ 42 billion increase in shareholder value. There is no significant stock market increase for a control group of countries that do not sign Brady agreements. The stock market appreciations successfully forecast higher future resource transfers, investment and growth. Since the market capitalization of US commercial banks with developing-country loan exposure also rises—by $ 13 billion—the results suggest that both borrower and lenders can benefit from debt relief when the borrower suffers from debt overhang. ...|$|R
5|$|Leigh became {{pregnant}} in 1956 and {{withdrew from the}} production of Coward's comedy South Sea Bubble. The day after her final performance in the play she miscarried and entered a period of depression that lasted for months. The same year Olivier decided to direct and produce a film version of The Sleeping Prince, retitled The Prince and the Showgirl. Instead of appearing with Leigh, he cast Marilyn Monroe as the showgirl. Although the filming was challenging because of Monroe's behaviour, the film was <b>appreciated</b> <b>by</b> the critics.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species of}} Lactarius, Lactifluus and Russula are valued as {{excellent}} edible mushrooms. This {{is the case}} for example for the north temperate species Lactarius deliciosus, Lactifluus volemus, or Russula vesca, and other species are popular {{in other parts of the}} world, e.g. Lactarius indigo in Mexico, or Lactifluus edulis in tropical Africa. Some species, like Russula vesca, can even be eaten raw. The brittle texture of Russula fruitbodies makes them different from other mushrooms and is not <b>appreciated</b> <b>by</b> some.|$|E
5|$|Spartan {{citizens}} used helots, {{a dependent}} group collectively {{owned by the}} state. It is uncertain whether they had chattel slaves as well. There are mentions of people manumitted by Spartans, which was supposedly forbidden for helots, or sold outside of Lakonia: the poet Alcman; a Philoxenos from Cytherea, reputedly enslaved with all his fellow citizens when his city was conquered, later sold to an Athenian; a Spartan cook bought by Dionysius the Elder or by a king of Pontus, both versions being mentioned by Plutarch; and the famous Spartan nurses, much <b>appreciated</b> <b>by</b> Athenian parents.|$|E
50|$|The chorus, {{subsequently}} {{conducted by}} Herbert Stavely Sammond, {{and later by}} Lawrence Rasmussen, performed two major concerts a year until 1943, when Mr. Rasmussen was called to service in World War II. Rehearsals were suspended until 1946 when Mr. Rasmussen returned. David Katz, founder of the Queens Symphony, succeeded Mr. Rasmussen in ensuing years, dispelling {{the notion that the}} works of the great masters are too deep and profound for the average person to understand and <b>appreciate.</b> <b>By</b> its seventy-fifth anniversary in 2003, Maestro David Close had, for thirty-five years, successfully continued the traditions established by the founding members.|$|R
50|$|With {{the failure}} of the Bretton Woods system with the Nixon shock in 1971, the Smithsonian {{agreement}} set bands of ±2.25% for currencies to move relative to their central rate against the US dollar. This provided a tunnel within which European currencies could trade. However, it implied much larger bands in which they could move against each other: for example if currency A started at the bottom of its band it could <b>appreciate</b> <b>by</b> 4.5% against the dollar, while if currency B started at the top of its band it could depreciate by 4.5% against the dollar.|$|R
