The viscosity of the components has been modelized by the Brabender torque and the phase inversion composition was determined by means of a solvent dispersion technique (SDT). The compatibilization, i. e., the amount of copolymer in the blend, does not modify the phase inversion location. The phase inversion composition is determined early during the process and is weakly or even not at all affected by further modification of viscosity ratio of the components versus mixing time. This work demonstrates that the only key parameter of the phase inversion composition is the viscosity ratio of the components at the first stage of the mixing process.

The {{evolution of}} the M(n) versus mixing time determined from solution viscosity and chain end concentrations measurements shows that PAmXD, 6 undergoes hydrolysis or condensation reactions depending on its initial molecular mass. Lower masses undergo condensation while higher masses undergo hydrolysis. The determination of water concentration in the melt during mixing time confirmed that this behavior is related to an equilibrium constant which was estimated at 500 +/- 100. For a mixing period shorter than 20 min, a good correspondence was observed between M(n) values determined either by chain end concentrations or by solution viscosity. However, for a mixing period longer than 20 min, discrepancy between M(n) values using both methods witnesses the probable appearance of oxidative degradation of PAmXD, 6. Mechanisms adapted from the established oxidation reactions of PA 6 and PA 6, 6 are proposed to justify the PAmXD, 6 behavior. Those reactions could explain the slight yellowing of PAmXD, 6 during its processing.

Variations of the components viscosity ratio during the mixing time have little, if any influence on the dimension of the dispersed phase. A Linear relation between the Brabender torque and the specific interfacial area was found. The determination of the copolymer weight fraction leads to the establishment of a close relation between the copolymer concentration and the specific interfacial area.

Three elastomers were tested: CR rubber (C 873 - 70), FKM fluorocarbon rubber (Viton A), and MPQ silicone rubber (MIL-ZZ- 765, Class 2); and three thermoplastics were tested: polyhexamethylene <b>adipamide</b> (Zytel 42), polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon TFE), and polychlorotrifluoroethylene (Neoflon CTFE M 400 H). Post-aging changes in mass, dimensions, tensile strength, elongation at break, and durometer hardness were determined. Also, the compression set was determined {{for the three}} elastomers. Results show that the properties under investigation were more sensitive to oxygen pressure at low to moderate temperatures, and more sensitive to temperature at low to moderate oxygen pressures. Inspection of the results also suggested that both chain scissioning and cross-linking processes were operative, consistent with heterogeneous oxidation. Attempts are underway to verify conclusively the occurrence of heterogeneous oxidation using a simple modulus profiling technique. Finally, the effect of aging at 620 kpa (90 psia) and 121 C (250 F) on ignition and combustion resistance was determined. As expected, aged polymers were less ignitable and combustible (had higher AlTs and lower heats of combustion). Special attention was given to Neoflon CTFE. More specifically, the effect of process history (compression versus extrusion molding) and percent crystallinity (quick- versus slow-quenched) on the AIT, heat of combustion, and impact sensitivity of Neoflon CTFE was investigated. Results show the AIT, heat of combustion, and impact sensitivity to be essentially independent of Neoflon CTFE process history and structure...|$|E
40|$|Traditional {{packaging}} materials like glass and metal are increasingly replaced by plastics due to several advantages of plastics which are low density, less energy consumption, ease of processing, weight reduction and cost savings. Unfortunately plastics are permeable to gases while glass and metal are absolute barrier materials. Permeability {{is an important}} issue in packaging that relates to product quality and a reasonable shelf life. Improvement in barrier properties of polyester/polyamide blends used in packaging industry is the main objective of the present study. For this purpose polyethylene terephthalate (PET) / poly (m-xylene <b>adipamide)</b> (Nylon-MXD 6) (95 / 5 w/w) and PET-co- 10 I (polyethylene terephthalate-co-isophtahalate random copolymer containing 10 wt. % isophthalic acid (IPA)) / N-MXD 6 (95 / 5 w/w) blends have been prepared with different compatibilizer types and combinations by using a co-rotating intermeshing twin screw extruder. The effects of biaxial orientation, crystallinity, morphology (tortuous pathway), and chemistry on oxygen gas permeability were analyzed by using different characterization techniques like scanning electron microscopy (SEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), spectral-birefringence, and gas permeability analyzer. The morphological analysis revealed that PET copolymer that consists of 5 % sodium sulfonated isophthalate (PET-co- 5 SIPA) was an effective compatibilizer for both PET/N-MXD 6 and PET-co- 10 I/N-MXD 6 blends. Spectral-birefringence technique and DSC analysis were used to understand the crystallization behaviour of the blends. Morphological analysis of films after biaxial stretching indicated that the spherical nylon phase was converted to 75 nm thick ellipsoids during stretching (aspect ratio L/W= 6) that creates tortuous pathway for oxygen ingress. PET-co- 10 I films had low permeability before biaxial stretching compared to unoriented PET films. Stretching ameliorated barrier properties of PET/N-MXD 6 films but increased the permeability of PET-co- 10 I/N-MXD 6 blends...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the work described was to identify and synthesize a range of biodegradable hypercoiling or hydrophobically associating polymers to mimic natural apoproteins, such as those found in lung surfactant or plasma apolipoproteins. Stirred interfacial polymerization was used to synthesize potentially biodegradable aromatic polyamides (Mw of 12, 000 - 26, 000) based on L-Iysine, L-Iysine ethyl ester, L-ornithine and DL-diaminopropionic acid, by reaction with isophthaloyl chloride. A similar technique was used to synthesize aliphatic polyamides based on L-Iysine ethyl ester and either adipoyl chloride or glutaryl chloride resulting in the synthesis of poly(lysine ethyl ester <b>adipamide)</b> [PLETESA] or poly(lysine ethyl ester glutaramide) (Mw of 126, 000 and 26, 000, respectively). PLETESA {{was found to be}} soluble in both polar and non-polar solvents and the hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance could be modified by partial saponification (66 - 75 %) of the ethyl ester side chains. Surface or interfacial tension/pH profiles were used to assess the conformation of both the poly(isophthalamides) and partially saponified PLETESA in aqueous solution. The results demonstrated that a loss of charge from the polymer was accompanied by an initial fall in surface activity, followed by a rise in activity, and ultimately, by polymer precipitation. These observations were explained by a collapse of the polymer chains into non-surface active intramolecular coils, followed by a transition to an amphipathic conformation, and finally to a collapsed hydrophobe. 2 -Dimensional NMR analysis of polymer conformation in polar and non-polar solvents revealed intramolecular associations between the hydrophobic groups within partially saponified PLETESA. Unsaponified PLETESA appeared to form a coiled structure in polar solvents where the ethyl ester side chains were contained within the polymer coil. The implications of the secondary structure of PLETESA and potential biomedical applications are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Membrane bioreactors (MBRs) show {{great promise}} for {{productivity}} improvement and energy conservation in conventional bioprocesses for wastewater reclamation. In order to attain high productivity in a bioprocess, {{it is crucial}} to retain the microorganisms in the bioreactors by preventing wash out. This enables recycling of the microorganisms, and is consequently saving energy. The main feature of MBRs is their permeable membranes, acting as a limitative interface between the medium and the microorganisms. Permeation of nutrients and metabolites through the membranes is thus dependent on the membrane characteristics, i. e. porosity, hydrophilicity,and polarity. The present thesis introduces membranes for MBRs to be used in a continuous feeding process, designed in the form of robust, durable, and semi-hydrophilic films that constitute an effective barrier for the microorganisms, while permitting passage of nutrients and metabolites. Polyamide 46 (polytetramethylene <b>adipamide),</b> a robust synthetic polymer, holds the desired capabilities, with the exception of porosity and hydrophilicity. In order to achieve adequate porosity and hydrophilicity, bulk functionalization of polyamide 46 with different reagents was performed. These procedures changed the configuration from dense planar to spherical, resulting in increased porosity. Hydroxyethylation of the changed membranes increased the surface tension from 11. 2 to 44. 6 mJ/m 2. The enhanced hydrophilicity of PA 46 resulted in high productivity of biogas formation in a compact MBR, due to diminished biofouling. Copolymerization of hydrophilized polyamide 46 with hydroxymethyl 3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene revealed electroconductivity and hydrophilic properties, adequate for use in MBRs. To find either the maximal pH stability or the surface charge of the membranes having undergone carboxymethylation, polarity and the isoelectric point (pI) of the treated membranes were studied by means of a Zeta analyzer. The hydroxylated PA 46 was finally employed in a multilayer membrane bioreactor and compared with hydrophobic polyamide and PVDF membranes. The resulting biogas production showed that the hydroxylated PA 46 membrane was, after 18 days without regeneration, fully comparable with PVDF membranes...|$|E
