25|$|Now {{consider}} an 8-fold rotation, and the displacement vectors between adjacent {{points of the}} polygon. If a displacement exists between any two lattice points, then that same displacement is repeated everywhere in the lattice. So collect all the edge displacements to begin at a single lattice point. The edge vectors become radial vectors, and their 8-fold symmetry implies a regular octagon of lattice points around the collection point. But this is impossible, because the new octagon is about 80% {{as large as the}} original. The significance of the shrinking is that it is unlimited. The same construction can be repeated with the new octagon, <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again</b> until the distance between lattice points is as small as we like; thus no discrete lattice can have 8-fold symmetry. The same argument applies to any k-fold rotation, for k greater than 6.|$|E
500|$|The {{most notable}} {{aspect of his}} songwriting {{involved}} {{the wide range of}} genres that he used, which included, among other styles, rockabilly, progressive rock, heavy metal, gospel and disco. As he explained in a 1986 interview, [...] "I hate doing the same thing again <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again.</b> I like to see what's happening now in music, film and theatre and incorporate all of those things." [...] Compared to many popular songwriters, Mercury also tended to write musically complex material. For example, [...] "Bohemian Rhapsody" [...] is acyclic in structure and comprises dozens of chords. He also wrote six songs from Queen II which deal with multiple key changes and complex material. [...] "Crazy Little Thing Called Love", on the other hand, contains only a few chords. Despite the fact that Mercury often wrote very intricate harmonies, he also claimed that he could barely read music. He wrote most of his songs on the piano and used a wide variety of different key signatures.|$|E

In {{a review of}} Unorthodox Jukebox, Slant Magazines Andrew Chan wrote {{that it is the}} album's highlight being the most energetic track on the album and found it [...] "most infectious bedroom anthem of the year." [...] Likewise, Lauren Kreisler from the Official Charts Company, described the song as an apparent bedroom antics. About.com critic Bill Lamb rated the song 3 out of 5 stars, praising the musicality, since the singer recaptures [...] "the musical spirit of Prince's arena sized ballad [...] "Purple Rain" [...] and [...] "the pounding keyboards and crunchy guitar will invite a live audience to sway along in time to the music". On the other hand, the [...] "erotic connection" [...] is misguided because [...] "the words about alcohol and cocaine fueled rough sex, {{it is difficult to see}} the song as truly erotic", making the lyrics [...] "tasteless" [...] and lacking concept. Official Charts Company's Lauren Kreisler found that the lyrics' concept simply [...] "baffled" [...] anyone, while ultimately described the song as [...] "intriguing (and anthemic) enough to make us listen again, <b>and</b> <b>again,</b> <b>and</b> <b>again,</b> to work it out." ...|$|E

Alternative Press called it [...] "an undeniable hip-hop masterpiece" [...] showing [...] "DJ Shadow remembers that sampling is an art form", while David Bennun from The Guardian said the record was [...] "not only one of the most daring and original albums of recent times, but also one of the loveliest." [...] In Playboy, Robert Christgau claimed that while listeners unfamiliar with its style of music would not find the tracks as powerful, [...] "they are so rich and eclectic, and spun out with such a sense of flow, that this album establishes the kind of convincing aural reality other British techno experimenters only fantasize about." [...] Tom Wilkes of Melody Maker wrote: [...] "The album flips hip hop inside out all over again like a reversible glove, <b>and</b> <b>again,</b> <b>and</b> <b>again,</b> and each time it's sudden and new. I am, I confess, totally confounded by it. I hear a lot of good records, but very few impossible ones... You need this record. You are incomplete without it." [...] Author and rock critic Greil Marcus published a glowing review of the album in his [...] "Real Life Rock Top Ten" [...] column for Interview, where he called it [...] "absolutely modern – which is to say ambient-dreamy and techno-abstract" [...] and [...] "quite brilliant throughout".|$|E
500|$|With polls {{released}} on October 6 showing Roosevelt well ahead, Willkie began to sound an isolationist theme, accusing Roosevelt {{of being a}} warmonger. Many of Willkie's speeches to that point had been on domestic issues, {{but he had been}} advised by Martin, Hamilton, and other advisors that the war was the issue the voters really cared about. Willkie began to argue that Roosevelt would not keep the U.S. out of war, but that he would. He was given room to make this argument by the United Kingdom's increasing success in the Battle of Britain, as it was clear a German invasion was not imminent. The polls showed voters responding positively to this new tack, and Willkie kept on this course {{for the remainder of the}} campaign. Roosevelt reacted by scheduling five speeches for the final days, in which he proposed to rebut Willkie's [...] "falsifications". The president stated, [...] "I have said again <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again</b> that your boys are not going to be sent into any foreign wars." [...] Willkie was prone to ad lib remarks, which sometimes led to gaffes: addressing steelworkers, he pledged to appoint a new Secretary of Labor, [...] "and it will not be a woman either". This allusion to Secretary Frances Perkins, the only woman to hold a cabinet position in American history to that point, did not aid him among female voters.|$|E
