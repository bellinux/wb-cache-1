40|$|Abstract: 2 ̆ 2 The Air Force has two ongoing {{initiatives}} {{to aid the}} ailing U. S. Machine Tool Industry. The first is the Intelligent Machining Workstation (IMW), which has the goal of automatically producing one-off quality parts. The second is a Next Generation Controller (NGC) initiative, which has as its primary objective to design and specify an open architecture controller for machine tools. This report analyzes whether the integration language developed for the IMW is adequate to support the requirements of an integration language needed to build the NGC. The IMW 2 ̆ 7 s Feature Exchange Language (FEL) is a simple message oriented language designed to integrate diverse modules. The NGC has a specified need to design <b>a</b> Neutral <b>Manufacturing</b> <b>Language,</b> which can be readily used to integrate diverse third-party modules into a coherent controller. We show how with a few minor extensions FEL {{can be used to}} meet this need. 2 ̆...|$|R

40|$|The {{automation}} {{and flexibility}} of production systems {{is a key}} step towards improved profitability and competitiveness in high labour cost areas, when producing high-complexity, low-volume products. In the Evolvable Assembly Systems (EAS) project, the ‘manufacturability’ (or ‘realisability’) and ‘control’ algorithms were introduced to accommodate the batch-size-of-one production of highly customisable products. These algorithms enable checking whether a production line can manufacture a given product with its available set of resources, and how the product should be manufactured, e. g. which resources to use, and when. To this end, the authors formally define production recipes, which represent products, and manufacturing resources which make up <b>a</b> <b>manufacturing</b> facility. This paper re-defines these notions in the ISO-standard EBNF (Extended Backus-Naur Form) notation, and adapts the manufacturability and control algorithms to accommodate the new definitions. The new algorithms and data structures reflect more closely {{the ones that are}} used in an implemented software tool. This paper also reports a method by which recipes and resources could be used to generate manufacturing process controllers in the Business to <b>Manufacturing</b> Markup <b>Language</b> (B 2 MML) standard. In doing so, this paper takes a step toward a complete path from the formal specification of <b>a</b> <b>manufacturing</b> facility and the products to be manufactured, to the automatic generation of executable process plans...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{discusses}} {{a method}} of estimating the flexibility of <b>a</b> <b>manufacturing</b> system. The approach proposed, is motivated by the dynamic behaviour analogy between a mechanical and <b>a</b> <b>manufacturing</b> system. The main hypothesis is that the flexibility of <b>a</b> <b>manufacturing</b> system can be calculated, in the same manner, as the damping factor of a mechanical system. In order for {{the validity of the}} method proposed, to be tested and discussed, a set of experiments has been designed and executed, initially, for a simple production system. An industrial production system has also been studied having used the same approach. The results prove that this method can be used for the estimation of <b>a</b> <b>manufacturing</b> system's flexibility...|$|R
40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} parameters of logistic processes structure in <b>a</b> <b>manufacturing</b> company. The logistic processes structure in <b>a</b> <b>manufacturing</b> company means the logistic processes and their relationships in <b>a</b> <b>manufacturing</b> company. The main {{objective of the}} thesis {{is to create an}} overview of parameters of the logistic processes structure in manufacturing companies. Cognition and formation of the logistic processes structure is important for planning, control and management of elements of the logistic chain. The thesis focuses on the logistic processes structure in <b>a</b> <b>manufacturing</b> company and the examination of their instantiations. To achieve the objective, in the thesis it was necessary to propose a unifying classification of logistic processes, as well as the general classification for the integration of logistic functions in the organization of <b>a</b> <b>manufacturing</b> company. The proposed classifications and proposed parameters allowed to compare the results of research concerning the comparison of different logistic processes (or operations) in companies...|$|R
