40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{an application of}} the approximated hypercube model to Lisbon emergency medical services (EMS) management, namely for assessing alternative dispatching rules for assigning <b>ambulances</b> to <b>emergency</b> <b>calls.</b> Theapproximated hypercube (A-hypercube) is a queuing theory model that computes several performance measures such as average response time, server workloads or the probability of all servers being busy (loss probability). Theassumptions of the extended model are Poisson customer arrivals, general service time (customer and server dependent) and a fixed preference assignmentrule of servers to customers. The fact that dispatching rules are precisely a model parameter, turn this model into a valuable tool {{in the definition of}} efficient operating rules. In this paper, we propose new expressions for the computation of system performance measures during periods in which the <b>emergency</b> <b>call</b> arrival process is not stationary. Different dispatching rules are evaluated by comparing the system performance measures obtained from the extended A-hypercube model and a simulation model, using data collected from the Lisbon EMS Department...|$|R

This research process commenced with taking a story told on screen into an audio version of the same tale and has since explored aural establishing shots, tracking, panning, long shots and close ups, challenging locations and editing styles to develop an observational audio recording and sound editing technique to support her research on ways in which a story can be told with sound only but using observational documentary film style. This program is a synthesis of her research development, which has culminated in a project that is still moving audiences to write to her from around the world. It draws together research into character, location and event based observational representation and confidently illustrates audio as an observational documentary form, depicting a story that is primarily told via indirect modes of address (few interviews and no narration) with a texture that takes the medium far from the single studio mike and foley artist days and establishes a clear benchmark in story telling. In Directing the Documentary, esteemed filmmaker Michael Rabiger writes, &# 039;Radio documentary is resurging and even showing the way forward for film makers [...] for unforgettable sound design and sheer gut wrenching emotion listen to Kyla Brettle&# 039;s 000 Ambulance&# 039;.

We aimed to explore whether the language used by callers to describe breathing {{had an impact on}} call-taker recognition of agonal breathing and hence cardiac arrest. Methods We analysed 176 calls of paramedic-confirmed OHCA, stratified by recognition of OHCA (89 cases recognised, 87 cases not recognised). We investigated the linguistic features of callers’ response to the question “is s/he breathing?” and examined the impact on subsequent coding by call-takers.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{assess the}} degree of {{inappropriate}} use of the London Ambulance Service and analyse the reasons for misuse. DESIGN: An immediate assessment of {{the appropriateness of the}} " 999 " call by the ambulanceperson and casualty senior house officer followed by a retrospective review of each case by the accident and emergency (A&E) consultant. SETTING: A busy inner London A&E department. METHODS: Three hundred consecutive <b>emergency</b> <b>ambulance</b> arrivals to the A&E department underwent assessment as to the appropriateness of the call. RESULTS: Overall 53. 7 % of patients were considered justified in their call, 15. 7 % of calls were inappropriate, and in 19. 0 % of cases a unanimous decision was not reached. Eleven per cent of all forms were incompletely filled. CONCLUSIONS: Almost 16 % of <b>emergency</b> <b>ambulance</b> <b>calls</b> were considered unanimously to be inappropriate. This suggests that 75, 000 <b>emergency</b> <b>calls</b> per year to the London Ambulance Service are not necessary. The commonest reason for inappropriately calling an ambulance was that the caller felt that they had a serious or life threatening condition.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Accurate patient {{diagnosis}} in the prehospital {{environment is}} essential to initiate suitable care pathways. The advanced paramedic (AP) is a relatively recent role in Ireland, and refers to a prehospital practitioner with advanced life-support skills and training. OBJECTIVES: The objectives {{of this study were}} to compare the diagnostic decisions of APs with emergency medicine (EM) physicians, and to investigate if APs, as currently trained, can predict the requirement for hospital admission. METHODS: A prospective study was initiated, whereby each <b>emergency</b> <b>ambulance</b> <b>call</b> received via the statutory 999 system was recorded by the attending AP. The AP was asked to provide a clinical diagnosis for each patient, and to predict if hospital admission was required. The data was then cross-referenced with the working diagnosis of the receiving emergency physician and the hospital admission records. RESULTS: A total of 17 APs participated in the study, and 1369 <b>emergency</b> <b>calls</b> were recorded over a 6 -month period. Cases where a general practitioner attended the scene were excluded from the concordance analysis. Concordance with the receiving emergency physician represents 70 % (525 / 748) for all cases of AP diagnosis, and is mirrored with 70 % (604 / 859) correct hospital admission predictions. CONCLUSIONS: AP diagnosis and admission prediction for <b>emergency</b> <b>calls</b> is similar to other emergency medical services systems despite the relative recency of the AP programme in Ireland. Recognition of non-concordance case types may identify priorities for AP education, and drive future AP practice in areas such as 'treat and refer'...|$|R

The Kaunas Weather Station provided daily records of air temperature (T), wind speed (WS), relative humidity, and barometric pressure (BP). We evaluated the associations between daily weather variables and daily number of EACs by applying a multivariate Poisson regression. Unfavorable heliophysical conditions (two days after the active-stormy geomagnetic field or the days with solar WS > 600 km/s) increased the daily number of elevated arterial blood pressure (EABP) by 12 % (RR = 1. 12; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 04 – 1. 21); and WS ≥ 3. 5 knots during days of T < 1. 5 °C and T ≥ 12. 5 °C by 8 % (RR = 1. 08; CI 1. 04 – 1. 12). An increase of T by 10 °C and an elevation of BP two days after by 10 hPa were associated with a decrease in RR by 3 %. An additional effect of T was detected during days of T ≥ 17. 5 °C only in females.

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE: We aim to {{determine}} clinical and cost-effectiveness of a paramedic protocol {{for the care}} of older people who fall. METHODS: We undertook a cluster randomized trial in 3 UK ambulance services between March 2011 and June 2012. We included patients aged 65 years or older after an <b>emergency</b> <b>call</b> for a fall, attended by paramedics based at trial stations. Intervention paramedics could refer the patient to a community-based falls service instead of transporting the patient to the emergency department. Control paramedics provided care as usual. The primary outcome was subsequent emergency contacts or death. RESULTS: One hundred five paramedics based at 14 intervention stations attended 3, 073 eligible patients; 110 paramedics based at 11 control stations attended 2, 841 eligible patients. We analyzed primary outcomes for 2, 391 intervention and 2, 264 control patients. One third of patients made further emergency contacts or died within 1 month, and two thirds within 6 months, with no difference between groups. Subsequent 999 call rates within 6 months were lower in the intervention arm (0. 0125 versus 0. 0172; adjusted difference - 0. 0045; 95 % confidence interval - 0. 0073 to - 0. 0017). Intervention paramedics referred 8 % of patients (204 / 2, 420) to falls services and left fewer patients at the scene without any ongoing care. Intervention patients reported higher satisfaction with interpersonal aspects of care. There were no other differences between groups. Mean intervention cost was $ 23 per patient, with no difference in overall resource use between groups at 1 or 6 months. CONCLUSION: A clinical protocol for paramedics reduced <b>emergency</b> <b>ambulance</b> <b>calls</b> for patients attended for a fall safely and at modest cost...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: In Japan, {{ambulance}} staff sometimes {{must make}} request calls to find hospitals that can accept patients {{because of an}} inadequate information sharing system. This study aimed to quantify effects {{of the number of}} request calls on the time interval between an <b>emergency</b> <b>call</b> and hospital arrival. Design and setting: A cross-sectional study of an ambulance records database in Nara prefecture, Japan. Cases: A total of 43 663 patients (50 % women; 31. 2 % aged 80 years and over) : (1) transported by ambulance from April 2013 to March 2014, (2) aged 15 years and over, and (3) with suspected major illness. Primary outcome measures: The time from call to hospital arrival, defined as the time interval from receipt of an <b>emergency</b> <b>call</b> to <b>ambulance</b> arrival at a hospital. Results: The mean time interval from <b>emergency</b> <b>call</b> to hospital arrival was 44. 5 min, and the mean number of requests was 1. 8. Multilevel linear regression analysis showed that ∼ 43. 8 % of variations in transportation times were explained by patient age, sex, season, day of the week, time, category of suspected illness, person <b>calling</b> for the <b>ambulance,</b> <b>emergency</b> status at request call, area and number of request calls. A higher number of request calls was associated with longer time intervals to hospital arrival (addition of 6. 3 min per request call; p< 0. 001). In an analysis dividing areas into three groups, there were differences in transportation time for diseases needing cardiologists, neurologists, neurosurgeons and orthopaedists. Conclusions: The study revealed 6. 3 additional minutes needed in transportation time for every refusal of a request call, and also revealed disease-specific delays among specific areas. An effective system should be collaboratively established by policymakers and physicians to ensure the rapid identification of an available hospital for patient transportation {{in order to reduce the}} time from the initial <b>emergency</b> <b>call</b> to hospital arrival...|$|R

To provide habitable indoor conditions without air-conditioning during heatwave, residential building energy efficiency need to be upgraded. The aim of this research is to investigate the possible correlation of building energy rating upgrading with heat-related health hazard during heatwave, with case data drawing from Melbourne, Australia. Using building simulations, indoor heat stress conditions of different energy rated houses were calculated using wet bulb globe temperature and discomfort index under the Melbourne 2009 heatwave conditions. The results showed that during three days heatwave period, residents of 0. 9 star energy rated house were exposed to extreme heat stress conditions for almost 25 h compared to only 6 h experienced by the occupants of 5. 4 star energy rated house. Several robust empirical relationships were proposed to predict deaths, <b>ambulance</b> <b>calls,</b> <b>emergency</b> department presentations and after hour doctor calls during heatwave.
