5|$|While {{serving as}} dean in 1850, Holmes became a witness {{for both the}} defense and {{prosecution}} during the notorious Parkman-Webster murder case. Both George Parkman (the victim), a local physician and wealthy benefactor, and John Webster (the assailant) were graduates of Harvard, and Webster was professor of chemistry <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Medical</b> School {{during the time of}} the highly publicized murder. He was convicted and hanged. Holmes dedicated his November 1850 introductory lecture <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Medical</b> School to Parkman's memory.|$|E

More heart surgeries are performed at the Texas Medical Center {{than anywhere else in the}} world.|$|E

5|$|Struthers studied {{medicine}} at Edinburgh, winning prizes as an undergraduate. He completed his M.D. degree in 1845, becoming a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh {{at the same}} time. In 1847, the college licensed him and his brother James to teach anatomy. The courses that they taught <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>medical</b> school in Argyle Square, Edinburgh were recognized by the examining bodies of England, Scotland and Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Culverhouse was {{diagnosed}} with lung cancer in 1992. After a successful operation to remove a tumor and part of his lung, he began chemotherapy a few months later, when a routine exam revealed a recurrence of the cancer. Despite his health problems, he remained a hard worker until the end, and even went hunting in Tanzania only four days after having part of his lung removed. An experimental procedure failed to stop the cancer, and he died on August 25, 1994, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Medical</b> Center of Louisiana at New Orleans. He was survived by wife Joy, daughter Gay, and son Hugh, Jr.|$|E
5|$|In August 1728, Linnaeus {{decided to}} attend Uppsala University {{on the advice}} of Rothman, who {{believed}} it would be a better choice if Linnaeus wanted to study both medicine and botany. Rothman based this recommendation on the two professors who taught <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>medical</b> faculty at Uppsala: Olof Rudbeck the Younger and Lars Roberg. Although Rudbeck and Roberg had undoubtedly been good professors, by then they were older and not so interested in teaching. Rudbeck no longer gave public lectures, and had others stand in for him. The botany, zoology, pharmacology and anatomy lectures were not in their best state. In Uppsala, Linnaeus met a new benefactor, Olof Celsius, who was a professor of theology and an amateur botanist. He received Linnaeus into his home and allowed him use of his library, {{which was one of the}} richest botanical libraries in Sweden.|$|E

5|$|The first {{large-scale}} production of penicillin {{took place in}} the town. In 1938 Howard Florey was working at Lincoln College, Oxford University with Ernst Boris Chain and Norman Heatley, when he read Alexander Fleming's paper discussing the antibacterial effects of Penicillium notatum mould. He made arrangements for this to be grown in deep culture tanks <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Medical</b> Research Council's Antibiotic Research Station in Clevedon, enabling mass production of this mould for the injections of the forthcoming soldiers of World War II who suffered from infections.|$|E
5|$|Ferrari {{undertook}} additional medical {{study in}} Europe and the United States, learning pioneering techniques that she {{brought back to}} Argentina. She studied urinary tract monitoring <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Medical</b> Faculty of Paris, earning the first diploma ever given to a woman. She designed a vaginoscope, studied radiation therapy at the Curie Institute, and performed a Caesarean section at Columbia University. She was responsible for bringing these innovations back with her to Argentina and implementing them at the maternity and gynecological unit she established at the Military Hospital. An ardent feminist, she established the Argentina Federation of University Women in 1936, and pushed for recognition of both {{civil and political rights}} for women. When the government of Argentina took a conservative turn in the late 1930s, she was pushed out of the hospital and later, in the early 1950s, out of teaching. She died in 1956.|$|E

50|$|Harvey {{was later}} sued for libel after a former {{instructor}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> college, Dr. Longshore, was forced out. Longshore then started a rival women's <b>medical</b> college <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Penn <b>Medical</b> University.

5|$|On the 36th lap, Glock's right-rear {{suspension}} failed {{coming out}} of the final corner. He spun through 180 degrees before hitting the pit wall with a strong rearward impact, with debris flying across the track. The car, pointing the wrong way, rolled to a stop on the grass. A dazed Glock extracted himself before being treated <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>medical</b> centre. The safety car was deployed after the accident. When the pit lane opened on lap38, most drivers headed in, including all of the leaders except Hamilton. McLaren believed that Hamilton had enough fuel to stay out, the plan being for him to then rapidly pull away from his heavily-fuelled rivals, after the safety car went in. Hamilton needed to build up enough of a lead to rejoin still in first position, following his final pit stop. This would prove to be very risky, as Massa rejoined in fourth position, fuelled to the finish.|$|E
5|$|Rubén Plaza (Lampre-Merida) led the {{breakaway}} {{over the}} second climb of the day, with Fraile second. The breakaway was around two minutes {{ahead of the}} peloton. Imanol Erviti (Movistar) attacked on the descent and led the race solo for some distance; he was first to reach {{the summit of the}} next climb, the Coll de la Rabassa, with Fraile again second. He was eventually brought back by work from Mikel Landa (Astana) on the descent. On the Coll de la Gallina the breakaway broke up: the lead group was formed of Landa and Fraile, along with Ian Boswell (Sky), Romain Sicard (Europcar), Nelson Oliveira (Lampre-Merida), Darwin Atapuma (BMC) and Paweł Poljański (Tinkoff-Saxo). Fraile was first over the summit. The climb also caused difficulty in the main group: Chris Froome was unable to stay in the group; his injured shoulder was treated <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>medical</b> car and he was then guided {{through the rest of the}} stage by Geraint Thomas. Froome lost two minutes on the climb. Nicolas Roche was also dropped from the lead group and Mikel Nieve took over the leadership of Team Sky.|$|E
