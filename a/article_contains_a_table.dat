40|$|Background: The {{author of}} the article {{attempts}} to initiate a scholarly discourse on mycological vocabulary, especially the names of macrofungi (macromycetes), a valid issue which still has not been fully described. He proposes a contrastive analysis (Ukrainian-Polish) of the discourse on the contemporary mycological vocabulary functioning in various texts: scientific, popular science, literature, as well as folklore. Purpose: The purpose of the article was to characterize selected sources of mycological vocabulary and present Ukrainian and Polish research. Furthermore, the author wanted to propose a preliminary semantic analysis of selected Ukrainian and Polish names of inedible and poisonous mushrooms (particularly those {{that can be found}} in both countries). Results: Myconims are direct or indirect references to the specific characteristics of fungi. The <b>article</b> <b>contains</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> containing 92 official names of the most common inedible and poisonous fungi in Poland and Ukraine (Latin, Ukrainian, and Polish names). This list can be expanded with further hundreds of names, since, as mycologists and mushroom researchers claim, there is approx. 4 thousand species of macrofungi on the territory of Ukraine and Poland. In the article the official names of Ukrainian and Polish inedible and poisonous mushrooms were classified into eight groups. Elements most frequently co-creating the collected myconims (comparable for both languages) are lexemes indicating: the color of the cap or the fruiting body, the place and manner of its occurrence, the overall appearance of the fruiting body. Significant, especially for the Ukrainian names of mushrooms, is the presence of Latinisms, which is characteristic of Ukrainian specialized terminology, such as the medical one (eg. cirrhosis hepatis, цироз печінки; glomerulonephritis, гломерулонефрит; appendicitis acuta, апендицит etc.). Most myconims, both Polish and Ukrainian, are two-component structures (mainly N + Adj, rarely N + N, for example шишкогриб лускатий, калоцера рогоподібна, решіточник Арчера, плютка Патуйара); among the collected Ukrainian names there was one single-component name (гірчак), as well as several compound names (Adj + N + Adj) with the adjective несправжній in preposition (eg. несправжній опеньок сірчано-жовтий, несправжній опеньок цегляно-червоний, несправжній трутовик вербовий, несправжній трутовик сосновий). Although the most frequent is the (N + Adj) model, two-component adjectives with preposition also appear among the Ukrainian names, for example чортів гриб, коренева губка. Discussion: The analyzed vocabulary (in the proposed text only in a semantic perspective) provides a wide field of linguistics research (for instance semantic, onomastic, formative, and etymological). Due to the extremely wide aspect of research and almost no previous exploration in this area, especially in terms of Ukrainian-Polish confrontative comparison, such analysis should be carried out, because the results can serve not only as a platform for further linguistic research, but also as a basis for creating thematic dictionaries, as an aid to mycologists, in the food industry, medicine and so on...|$|E
