40|$|According to the {{classical}} investigation of Boettiger & Furshpan (1952), the wing beat of flies {{is accompanied by a}} bistable mechanism, the 'click mechanism'. This mechanism is controlled by the pleurosternal and tergopleural muscles (see Heide, 1971; Pfau, 1978; Pfau, Schroeter & Steitz, 1977). Recently doubts have been raised concerning the existence of the click mechanism during flight (Miyan & Ewing, 1985 a,b). The authors suspect that the click mechanism is an artefact of CC 14 anaesthesia and propose a novel mechanical model of dipteran flight. In the following I analyse this model critically. The classical model The click mechanism was illustrated by Boettiger & Furshpan (1952, fig. 3) by diagrammatic cross-section drawings. Pringle (1957) presented a simplified three-dimensional working model which made the mechanism easier to understand, demonstrating that the thorax of flies is, in principle, a four-bar crank chain (Alexander, 1968, p. 52). According to my studies this classical model is essentially correct, {{with the exception of the}} mechanism of pronation and supination: Boettiger & Furshpan and Pringle state that these movements of the wing are achieved directly ('automatically') by the scutellar lever; according to Pfau (1977) pronation and supination are controlled by the muscles of a special mechanical system, mainly consisting of axillaries 3 and 4. A different model of a wing <b>actuation</b> <b>lever</b> system, which can be traced back t...|$|E
40|$|A {{device for}} {{attaching}} an experiment carrier to {{a space station}} handrail is provided. The device has two major components, a clamping mechanism for attachment to a space station handrail, and a pointing carrier on which an experiment package can be mounted and oriented. The handrail clamp uses an overcenter mechanism and the carrier mechanism uses an adjustable preload ball and socket for carrier positioning. The handrail clamp uses a stack of disk springs to provide a spring loaded button. This configuration provides consistent clamping force over a range of possible handrail thicknesses. Three load points are incorporated in the clamping mechanism thereby spreading the clamping load onto three separate points on the handrail. A four bar linkage is used to provide for a single <b>actuation</b> <b>lever</b> for all three load points. For additional safety, a secondary lock consisting of a capture plate and push lock keeps the clamp attached to the handrail {{in the event of}} main clamp failure. For the carrier positioning mechanism, a ball in a spring loaded socket uses friction to provide locking torque; however. the ball and socket are torque limited so that the ball ran slip under kick loads (125 pounds or greater). A lead screw attached to disk spring stacks is used to provide an adjustable spring force on the socket. A locking knob is attached to the lead screw to allow for hand manipulation of the lead screw...|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} a liquid helium {{temperature}} prototype secondary mirror assembly (PSMA) under development for the NASA Space Infrared Telescope Facility (SIRTF) program is described. The SIRTF assembly must operate below 4 K and provide the functions of highly precise two-axis periodic tilting ('chopping') {{in addition to the}} conventional functions of focus and collimation adjustment. The PSMA design employs a fused quartz mirror kinematically attached at its center to an aluminum cruciform. The mirror/cruciform assembly is driven in tilt about its combined center of mass using an aluminum flexure pivot of unique design and a four-actuator control system with feedback provided by pairs of differential position sensors. The voice coil actuators are mounted on a second flexure-pivoted mass to enhance servosystem stability and isolate the telescope from vibration-induced disturbances. The mirror/cruciform and reaction mass are attached to opposite sides of an aluminum mounting plate whose position relative to the outer housing is controlled by a six-degree-of-freedom focus and centering mechanism using pivoted <b>actuation</b> <b>levers</b> driven by lead screw/harmonic drive/stepper motor assemblies...|$|R

40|$|Pillars {{resonators}} arrays {{are emerging}} as powerful sensors for their peculiar characteristics, namely high mass sensitivity, high active areas density and operation in liquid. On the other hand, their characteristic vertical geometry and fabrication strategy hinders a direct integration within integrated circuits. So far, the examples reported in literature {{are based on}} a bulk piezoelectric <b>actuation</b> and optical <b>lever</b> detection, which are not suitable for further integration. In this paper we report on the design, fabrication and characterization of Kelvin polarization force actuated pillar resonator.

5000|$|Standardized {{aperture}} control. AI-S lens apertures move in {{a standardized}} fashion {{in relation to their}} stop-down levers. The levers of AI and pre-AI lenses were intended only to close the aperture to its manual setting. The advance of aperture control by the camera body itself, by partial actuation of the stop-down lever, meant more precision was required for consistent exposure. This feature is indicated by a Lens Type Signal notch in the lens mount. Although later Nikon cameras cannot control the apertures of AI-S lenses as the F4, they control the apertures of AF lenses using the same method of partial <b>lever</b> <b>actuation</b> and standardized response.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{the design}} concept was geared towards law {{enforcement}} and military close quarters combat scenarios, there was inadequate demand for the weapon due to some problematic design issues in its conception. One such design feature was safety lever {{on the left side}} of the stamped steel receiver, above the pistol grip. The <b>actuation</b> of this <b>lever</b> is not possible without removing the left arm from the pump, and is difficult if the operator is wearing gloves. The same problem exists for the slide lock button. These problems were mainly found in the early models exported to the United States of America. The company then focused its attention on these issues and were solved by reducing the resistance of the safety lever and over-ride slide lock button. The user can now operate both levers effectively and easily without taking the left hand off the pump. Another issue that plagued the MAG-7 was the 7.7 Kgf trigger pull. It was also addressed by the manufacturer and reduced to an industry standard 3.5Kgf ...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. This {{dissertation}} {{outlines the}} conceptualisation, design, manufacture, assembly and experimental testing of an affordable anthropomorphic mechanical hand prosthesis. In many countries, upper-limb amputees lack access to prosthetic hand devices. Furthermore, currently available mechanical devices require {{a large amount}} of effort to actuate; fatiguing and frustrating patients who have no other alternative but to use them. Consequently, a need has arisen to provide a mechanical device that is affordable enough to be accessible to low and middle-income patients, is functional enough to allow users to easily perform their Activities of Daily Living (ADLs), and is aesthetically appealing enough to ensure that patients feel comfortable and confident when wearing it. Concept solutions of several mechanisms were identified and evaluated from which the final design was selected. Analytical force analysis was used to generate a mathematical model to analyse the response of each dynamic member in the hand. A linear relationship between the input-force and applied grasp-forces of the hand was identified. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) used to investigate the lateral and hyperextensive loading limits of the phalanges, generated results that corresponded well to the experimental outcomes. Amongst the utilised <b>actuation</b> mechanisms (<b>levers,</b> pulleys, tendon-wires, bearings and springs), the tendon-wires were of concern due to their repetitive tensile loading and relative movement with the phalanges. Tensile testing of various tendon-wires and endurance testing of the phalangeal tendon-channels, yielded a combination which surpassed the infinite life requirement of 1, 200, 000 loading cycles; with carbon-nylon contact wearing at the lowest rate as confirmed by gravimetric tests in accordance with ASTM F 2025 (2000). Manufacture of the hand used rapid prototyping in combination with traditional machining methods and standard components, enabling a fully-assembled cost of R 11, 628. 37; below the required R 18, 000 limit. Various power and precision grasping configurations were achieved and the contact forces satisfactorily maintained, using the hand’s built-in locking mechanism. Feedback gathered from the prosthetist and patients suggested making slight alterations to the hand’s aesthetics and to address minor functional challenges, such as the control of the closing trajectory for precision grasps...|$|R
