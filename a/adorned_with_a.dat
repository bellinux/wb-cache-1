5|$|Northampton's is a {{comparatively}} elaborate war memorial, {{especially for a}} town rather than a city. It consists of a Stone of Remembrance flanked by tall twin obelisks, each <b>adorned</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> pair of painted stone flags. Its use of obelisks, a Stone of Remembrance, and painted flags—all features characteristic of Lutyens' war memorials—make it particularly significant among his works.|$|E
5|$|Sandwiches usually using markook or khubz, such as Shawarma and Falafel {{are also}} common bread meals. Shawarma {{can be served}} as a {{sandwich}} or meal with shaved meat and bread. Shawarma can be chicken or beef, and is <b>adorned</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> variety of garnishes. These can include pickles, hummus, or a garlic yogurt mix. Falafel, fried chickpeas, parsley and onion are fried into small patties and are adorned with similar toppings as shawarma.|$|E
5|$|The female half has karanda-mukuta (a basket-shaped crown) on {{her head}} or well-combed knotted hair or both. The left ear wears a valika-kundala (a type of earring). A tilaka or bindu (a round red dot) adorns her forehead, {{matching}} Shiva's third eye. The left eye is painted with black eyeliner. While the male neck is sometimes <b>adorned</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> jewelled hooded serpent, the female neck has a blue lotus matching it.|$|E

5|$|Whatever the case, the bishop's grave {{seems to}} have been traced to Nousiainen latest after his {{elevation}} to sainthood. A number of medieval documents mention that the bishop's grave continued to be located in the local church, presumably meaning that all the bones had not been translated to Turku. The church was later <b>adorned</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> grandiose 15th century cenotaph, whose replica {{can be found in the}} National Museum of Finland in Helsinki.|$|E
5|$|The central Petén {{style of}} {{architecture}} is modelled {{after the great}} city of Tikal. The style is characterized by tall pyramids supporting a summit shrine <b>adorned</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> roof comb, and accessed by a single doorway. Additional features are the use of stela-altar pairings, and the decoration of architectural façades, lintels, and roof combs with relief sculptures of rulers and gods. One of the finest examples of Central Petén style architecture is Tikal Temple I. Examples of sites in the Central Petén style include Altun Ha, Calakmul, Holmul, Ixkun, Nakum, Naranjo, and Yaxhá.|$|E
5|$|The nude {{female figure}} is realistically sculpted in high-relief. Her eyes, beneath distinct, joined eyebrows, are hollow, presumably to accept some {{inlaying}} material– a feature common in stone, alabaster, and bronze sculptures of the time, but {{not seen in}} other Mesopotamian clay sculptures. Her full lips are slightly upturned at the corners. She is <b>adorned</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> four-tiered headdress of horns, topped by a disk. Her head is framed by two braids of hair, with the bulk of {{her hair in a}} bun in the back and two wedge-shaped braids extending onto her breasts.|$|E

5|$|Bhikshatana is {{depicted}} with jatabhadra (dishevelled matted locks) or with jatamandala (matted hair {{arranged in a}} circle). A serpent may be depicted in his matted hair, which is also adorned by the crescent moon. His forehead bears a tripundara, the Shaiva tilaka composed of three horizontal lines of sacred ash with a red dot in the middle representing the third eye. He wears a patta (ornamental head band)—sometimes <b>adorned</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> human skull motif—on his forehead. Snake ornaments adorn his body, and bronze images often depict multiple necklaces, a waist-band, armlets, elbow bands, bracelets, anklets, and rings on all his toes and fingers. A snake is also tied around his waist and a white yagnopavita (sacred thread) is worn across the chest.|$|E
5|$|Deivanai is {{generally}} depicted with her husband, particularly in an iconographic form called Senapati. She {{sits on the}} left thigh of the six-headed and twelve-armed Kartikeya. One of his arms holds her waist. Numerous depictions of the two exist at Tirupparankunram, the location of their marriage. However, in many south-Indian representations, when Murugan is depicted only with one consort, Valli is favoured over Devasena. In most South-Indian depictions, Murugan is depicted with both his consorts standing besides him; Devasena is on his left-hand side. Her complexion is yellow; she is often depicted <b>adorned</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> crown, earrings, necklaces and ornaments. She wears a traditional sari and has two arms. She holds a lotus in her left arm, while his right hand hangs down.|$|E
5|$|During the Hellenistic period, the {{sanctuary}} was {{extended from the}} base of the podium across the valley. To the east base of the podium stands a large chapel, , dating to the 4thcentury BC. The chapel was <b>adorned</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> paved pool and a large stone throne carved of a single block of granite in the Egyptian style; it is flanked by two sphinx figures and surrounded by two lion sculptures. The throne, attributed to the Sidonian goddess Astarte, rests against the chapel wall, which is embellished by relief sculptures of hunting scenes. The once important Astarte basin lost its function during the 2nd century AD and was filled with earth and statue fragments. The west base contains another 4th century BC chapel—centered on a bull protome topped capital—that remains preserved at the National Museum of Beirut.|$|E
50|$|The first {{headboard}} {{was introduced}} in 1953. This used a standard BR Type 3 plate design in black, with polished aluminium letters. As this was the Coronation year, this plate was <b>adorned</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> additional coronation crest.|$|R
50|$|To further tourism the {{old school}} was {{converted}} into today’s town hall, the historic marketplace was remodelled, and at Easter it is <b>adorned</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> Easter fountain. Furthermore, an old barn was converted into a community centre.|$|R
50|$|A flight bag {{can refer}} to any baggage taken on board a flight, but usually refers to a {{specific}} type of document bag carried by pilots and flight crews. Often <b>adorned</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> airline logo, at one time the flight bag was a chic fashion accessory.|$|R
5|$|E. Newton {{noted that}} he had {{expected}} the male would be <b>adorned</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> red patch on the wing, but {{that the absence of}} this indicated it was immature. He still found it more beautiful than the female. These two specimens are the only preserved individuals of the species. The mandible and sternum were extracted from the female specimen, and subfossil remains have since been found in the Plaine Corail caverns on Rodrigues. The genus Palaeornis was later declared a junior synonym of Psittacula, and all species within the former were transferred to the latter. The genus name Psittacula is derived from the Latin words Psittacus, which means parrot, and -ula, which is a diminutive suffix.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, {{the lion}} too {{has always had}} a close {{association}} with Iranian kingship. The garments and throne decorations of the Achaemenid kings were embroidered with lion motifs. The crown of the half-Persian Seleucid king Antiochus I was <b>adorned</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> lion. In the investiture inscription of Ardashir I at Naqsh-e Rustam, the breast armour of the king is decorated with lions. Further, in some Iranian dialects the word for king (shah) is pronounced as sher, homonymous with the word for lion. Islamic, Turkish, and Mongol influences also stressed the symbolic association of the lion and royalty. The earliest evidence for the use of a lion on a standard comes from the Shahnameh, which noted that the feudal house of Godarz (presumably a family of Parthian or Sassanid times) adopted a golden lion for its devices.|$|E
5|$|The male half wears a jata-mukuta (a headdress formed of piled, matted hair) on his head, <b>adorned</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{crescent}} moon. Sometimes the jata-mukuta is {{adorned with}} serpents {{and the river}} goddess Ganga flowing through the hair. The right ear wears a nakra-kundala, sarpa-kundala ("serpent-earring") or ordinary kundala ("earring"). Sometimes, the male eye is depicted smaller than the female one and a half-moustache is also seen. A half third eye (trinetra) is prescribed on the male side of the forehead in the canons; a full eye may also be depicted in middle of forehead separated by both the sides or a half eye may be shown above or below Parvati's round dot. A common elliptical halo (prabhamandala/prabhavali) may be depicted behind the head; sometimes {{the shape of the}} halo may differ on either side.|$|E
50|$|The mummified body of Senebtisi {{was placed}} in a set of three coffins. There was an outer wooden coffin, inscribed with text, but only badly preserved. There was <b>a</b> middle coffin <b>with</b> only on {{inscription}} on gold foil on the lid. The innermost coffin was human shaped but only very badly preserved. Senebtisi was <b>adorned</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> array of personal adornments, many of them especially just made for the burial. There are three broad collars, armlets and anklets and several bead necklaces. The body was also <b>adorned</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> array of weapons and royal insignia. Around the pelvis she was wearing a royal apron. Next to the coffin were found in a niche <b>a</b> canopic box <b>with</b> the four canopic jars. At the foot end of the coffin were discovered many pottery vessels.|$|R
50|$|Images of Sree Devi, Bhu Devi, Surya, Chandra and Aadiseshan (in human form) {{are seen}} in the eastward-facing sanctum. There are also shrines to Krishna, Nammalwar, Nadamuni, Kulasekharalwar, Tondaradippodiyalwar, Aandaal, Manavaala maamunigal and Ramanuja. The {{northern}} entrance of the temple is <b>adorned</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> unfinished rajagopuram in the Hoysala idiom.|$|R
50|$|The {{house was}} built in 1852 by the First Congregational Church for the Reverend Leete, whose service began that year. It was the first church-funded parsonage for the congregation. It is a good local example of {{transitional}} Greek Revival-Italianate styling. It was originally <b>adorned</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> elaborate Italianate front porch.|$|R
5|$|The seven British Army Infantry battalions of the Scottish Division, {{plus the}} Scots Guards and Royal Scots Dragoon Guards regiments, use the Saltire {{in a variety}} of forms. Combat and {{transport}} vehicles of these Army units may be <b>adorned</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> small, (130x80mm approx.), representation of the Saltire; such decals being displayed on the front and/or rear of the vehicle. (On tanks these may also be displayed on the vehicle turret). In Iraq, during both Operation Granby and the subsequent Operation Telic, the Saltire was seen to be flown from the communications whip antenna of vehicles belonging to these units. Funerals, conducted with full military honours, of casualties of these operations in Iraq, (plus those killed in operations in Afghanistan), have also been seen to include the Saltire; the flag being draped over the coffin of the deceased on such occasions.|$|E
5|$|Varahi may be two, four, or six-armed. The Matsya Purana, the Purva-karnagama and the Rupamandana {{mention a}} four-armed form. The Rupamandana says she carries a ghanta (bell), a chamara (a yak's tail), a chakra (discus) and a gada (mace). The Matsya Purana omits the ghanta {{and does not}} mention the fourth weapon. The Purva-Karanagama {{mentions}} that she holds the Sharanga (the bow of Vishnu), the hala (plough) and the musula (pestle). The fourth hand is held in the Abhaya ("protection gesture") or the Varada Mudra ("blessing gesture"). The Devi Purana mentions her attributes as being sword, iron club and noose. Another description says her hair is <b>adorned</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> garland with red flowers. She holds a staff and drinking skull-cup (kapala). The Varahini-nigrahastaka-stotra describes her attributes as a plough, a pestle, a skull-cup and the abhaya mudra. The Vamana Purana describes her seated on Shesha while holding a chakra and a mace. The Agni Purana describes her holding the gada, shankha, sword and ankusha (goad). The Mantramahodadhi mentions she carries a sword, shield, noose and goad. In Vaishnava images, since she is associated with Vishnu, Varahi may be depicted holding all four attributes of Vishnu — Shankha (conch), chakra, Gada and Padma (lotus). The Aparajitapriccha describes her holding a rosary, a khatvanga (a club with a skull), a bell, and a kamandalu (water-pot).|$|E

50|$|For {{the facade}} of the interior, Serlio used Corinthian columns on the first level and Composite columns on the second level. Again, he created a rhythm {{alternating}} between open windows and niches framed by pilasters. These niches are <b>adorned</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> inner shell. Serlio created a triple arcade on the ground floor, reminiscent of the Villa Madama.|$|R
