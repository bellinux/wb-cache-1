25|$|Calvin Hooker Goddard (30 October 1891 – 22 February 1955) was a {{forensic}} scientist, army officer, <b>academic,</b> <b>researcher</b> and {{a pioneer in}} forensic ballistics. He examined the bullet casings in the 1929 St. Valentine's Day Massacre and showed that the guns used were not police issued weapons, leading the investigators to conclude it was a mob hit.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, {{there were}} an {{estimated}} 22,000 practitioners in the US alone, but the number may be higher as some practitioners {{may be reluctant to}} disclose their religion on a government census or to an <b>academic</b> <b>researcher.</b> Of those living in the United States, some are fully committed priests and priestesses, others are godchildren or members of a particular house-tradition, and many are non-committal clients seeking help with their everyday problems.|$|E
25|$|The prototypic {{fusion protein}} was first {{synthesized}} and {{shown to be}} highly active and unusually stable as a modality for blockade of TNF in vivo in the early 1990s by Bruce A. Beutler, an <b>academic</b> <b>researcher</b> then at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, and his colleagues. These investigators also patented the protein, selling all rights to its use to Immunex, a biotechnology company that was acquired by Amgen in 2002.|$|E

25|$|The first printed version, also in German, {{dates to}} 1725 and was printed in Cologne by Peter Hammer. A partial copy in Hebrew {{is found in}} the Bodleian Library in Oxford, and dates from around 1740. A {{manuscript}} copy existed in French in the Bibliothèque de l'Arsenal in Paris, an institution founded in 1797. The French copy has since disappeared, but is available on microfilm. Another 17th-century manuscript in Italian exists in the 'Legato Martinengo' of the Queriniana Library in Brescia, Italy. It was part of the collection of the Count and Qabbalist Leopardo Martinengo of Barco and Pallavicina. The manuscript, unknown for centuries to international researchers until 2009, has been found by <b>academic</b> <b>researcher</b> Maria Elena Loda in the esoteric section. At the moment, it is the only known manuscript translation in Italian language of the Abramelin grimoire.|$|E
25|$|Lenihan {{entered the}} race as odds-on favourite; no Fianna Fáil {{candidate}} had ever lost a presidential election. However Lenihan was derailed when he confirmed in an on-the-record interview with freelance journalist and <b>academic</b> <b>researcher</b> Jim Duffy {{that he had}} been involved in controversial attempts to pressurise incumbent President Patrick Hillery not to dissolve the Dáil in 1982. After the contrast between his public denials during the campaign and his eventual confirmation of his role during his earlier interview (recorded in May), the Progressive Democrats, then in coalition with Fianna Fáil threatened to join an opposition motion of no confidence unless Lenihan was dismissed from the government or an inquiry to the 1982 events was set up. Taoiseach Charles Haughey privately asked Lenihan to resign, and sacked him on 31st October--a week before the election--when he refused to do so.|$|E
500|$|<b>Academic</b> <b>researcher</b> Matthew Kirschenbaum has {{reported}} that a pirated text of the poem was released the next day on MindVox, [...] "an edgy New York City-based electronic bulletin board". Kirschenbaum considers Mindvox, an interface between the dark web and the global Internet, to have been [...] "an ideal initial host". The text spread rapidly from that point on, first on FTP servers and anonymous mailers and later via USENET and listserv email. Since Gibson did not use email at the time, fans sent copies of the pirated text to his fax machine.|$|E
30|$|The {{study was}} {{concerned}} with inter-institutional collaborative heritage science research between <b>academic</b> <b>researchers</b> (‘researchers’) and users of research evidence in practice (‘users’). <b>Academic</b> <b>researchers</b> could be based at a HEI or an independent research organisation (IROs). Users could be based at a museum, library, archive or gallery (MLAG), a heritage organisation, in industry, in a small to medium enterprises (SMEs), in self-employment, or at an HEI-based MLAG. Users of research evidence included practitioners such as conservators, curators, librarians, archivists, collection managers, policy makers and those seeking to exploit research findings in business and product development. For {{the purposes of the}} questionnaire study, collaborative research referred only to collaborations that involved both <b>academic</b> <b>researchers</b> and users. Interdisciplinary projects involving only <b>academic</b> <b>researchers</b> from different disciplines and no users were not of interest to this study.|$|R

The letters revealed insider information about government figures, as well as humorous speculation on their roles in public controversies. Occasionally the letters were from other political figures, such as George Bush and Dick Morris, and on occasion the column purported to be the transcript of a police wiretap. [...] National Review maintained the author's anonymity throughout the Clinton presidency, revealing Long's identity only after George Bush was inaugurated in 2001.|$|E

40|$|In the {{knowledge}} economy collaboration between practitioners and <b>academic</b> <b>researchers</b> becomes increasingly important.

This study focuses on the roles in the information systems development process, and demonstrates how theoretical knowledge of <b>academic</b> <b>researchers</b> can be integrated in the information systems development process in a new and more refined way through different roles. This study, based on case study methodology, focuses on particularly the roles of the <b>academic</b> <b>researchers</b> within the field of Human Resource management. The objective of the information systems project is to develop a web portal for the purpose of collecting data on human resource practices and processes.
