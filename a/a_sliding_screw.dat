40|$|ABSTRACTThe MINUS {{system was}} {{developed}} as a minimally invasive procedure that uses a diaphyseal cephalic extramedullary implant {{for the treatment of}} transtrochanteral fractures of the femur in elderly patients. The implant consists of <b>a</b> <b>sliding</b> <b>screw</b> coupled to a plate adapted to the minimally invasive technique. The surgical access is approximately three centimeters in length located on the lateral surface of the hip, below the projection of the small trochanter.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{modeling}} of the contact conditions associated with cylindrical, prismatic, and screw joints in flexible multi-body systems. In the classical formulation these joints are developed for rigid bodies, and kinematic constraints are enforced between the kinematic variables of the two bodies. These constraints express the conditions for relative translation and rotation of the two bodies along and about a body fixed axis, and imply the relative sliding and rotation of the two bodies which remain in constant contact with each other. However, these kinematic constraints no longer imply relative sliding with contact {{when one of the}} bodies is flexible. To remedy this situation, a sliding joint and <b>a</b> <b>sliding</b> <b>screw</b> joint are proposed that involves kinematic constraints at the instantaneous point of contact between the sliding bodies. For sliding screw joints, additional constraints are added on the relative rotation of the contacting bodies. Various numerical examples are presented that demonstrate the dramatically different behavior of cylindrical, prismatic, or screw joints and of the proposed sliding and sliding screw joints in the presence of elastic bodies, and the usefulness of these constraint elements in the modeling of complex mechanical systems. © 2000 The American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc.

40|$|Fibrous {{dysplasia}} of bone is a congenital skeletal disorder {{characterized by}} proliferation of spindle cells inside an intramedullary collagenous stroma and by formation of metaplastic bone. An aneurysmal bone cyst is a lesion of unknown etiology. Macroscopically it appears like a blood-filled cavity that expands the affected bone. Histologically, fibrous septa are bordered by macrophages, giant cells, inflammatory cells, {{and areas of}} bone production. Hemorrhagic areas can rise into fibrous dysplasia. The lesion appears as an aggressive and destructive process {{that is difficult to}} diagnose properly. A 29 -year-old woman presented with a 2 -year history of left inguinal and lumbar pain. She reported increased pain after physical activity. Magnetic resonance imaging of the left femur (without intravenous gadolinium) showed a mass extending 14 cm along the femoral metaphysis. This lesion involved cortical bone that was broken in the posteromedial site. Computed tomography confirmed the osteostructural lytic alteration that "blows up" the proximal femur metaphysis. A trochar biopsy allowed the diagnosis of aneurysmal bone cyst on fibrous dysplasia, excluding malignancy. The lesion was treated with curettage and local adjuvants and filled with bone grafts. Internal fixation with <b>a</b> <b>sliding</b> <b>screw</b> plate was also performed. Radiographs at 1 year postoperatively showed good consolidation of the grafts and absence of local recurrence. The patient achieved active and passive mobilization of the left hip with no pain. Copyright © 2009 SLACK Incorporated. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Background: Intramedullary hip nails, which {{combine the}} {{advantages}} of intramedullary fixation with those of <b>a</b> <b>sliding</b> <b>screw,</b> should diminish the incidence of complications after osteosynthesis of the pertrochanteric fractures. Despite less mechanical failures, this has not happened. However, some new specific complications have occured. In this retrospective study of the pertrochanteric fractures treated with IMHS nail, the author is analysing the importance of experience {{and the impact of}} »learning curve« on incidence of complications. Methods and results: Between March 1996 and July 1999 65 patients with 65 non-pathologic pertrochanteric fractures were operated with IMHS nail. Thirty-one were operated in 1996 / 97 (Group I), thirty-four later on (Group II). Between the groups there were no differences in demographic characteristics, types of fractures, used material or outcome. Twelve out of 65 patients (eight from Group I, four from Group II) had at least one complication. In five patients there was a crack of femoral diaphisis. In two reduction of the fracture was insufficient. In another two the hip screw protruded into the joint. One fracture dislocated secondarely. Three patients had infection. One non-union of the femoral neck showed after removal of the nail 2. 5 years postinjury. Stratified statistical analysis showed that Group I had signifficantly more mechanical complications (insufficient reduction, hip screw protrusion, secondary dislocation), whereas differences between the groups in femur cracks, infection and non-union were insignificant. Conclusions: This comparative study has shown frequent complications after nailing of the pertrochanteric fractures and that with growing experience the incidence of complications decreases. All this points to an important »learning curve«. </p...|$|E

40|$|Surgical {{treatment}} of hip fractures is frequently associated with secondary fracture displacement, {{in part due}} to weak osteoporotic bone. So far, improvements have focused on new metal implants although an alternative could be to augment the bone that surrounds the implant. The aim of this thesis was to evaluate the use of calcium phosphate cement (Norian SRS) for augmentation of internally fixed hip fractures. Norian SRS is an injectable, biocompatible cement that hardens in situ without exothermic reaction. Over time it is remodeled and replaced by host bone. In a biomechanical study the holding characteristics for different implants was measured when inserted with or without augmentation. The study showed that conventional bone cement (PMMA) improved maximum torque and pull-out for almost all modalities while Norian SRS increased the holding power mainly in low-density bone. In a prospective and randomized study, patients with displaced femoral neck fractures were operated with internal fixation using screws alone or combined with Norian SRS for augmentation. The result showed improved stability when measured with radiostereometry (RSA) for the augmented fractures during the early rehabilitation period. The clinical evaluation of 118 patients included pain, walking aid, activities of daily living (ADLs), abductor muscle strength, mobility and range of motion. During the early course the augmented patients did better in some variables although over the total two-year study period there was no major difference between groups. Scintigraphic evaluation indicated that augmentation might compromise the circulation to the femoral head. The final part included unstable trochanteric fractures fixed with <b>a</b> <b>sliding</b> <b>screw</b> device alone or the same device combined with Norian SRS for augmentation. Using RSA it was shown that augmentation significantly improved the fracture stability until healing. In a randomized multicenter study including 112 patients, augmentation with Norian SRS reduced pain during early rehabilitation and improved quality of life until healing. In conclusion, augmentation with Norian SRS improved the early fracture stability in displaced femoral neck fractures while there was no major difference in clinical outcome. In unstable trochanteric fractures augmentation provided improved fracture stability and improved clinical course until healing...|$|E

Methods: In a prospective, randomized multicenter study, 684 elderly patients were treated with the INTERTAN nail or with <b>a</b> <b>sliding</b> hip <b>screw</b> with or without a trochanteric stabilizing plate. The patients were assessed during their hospital stay and at three and twelve months postoperatively. A visual analogue scale (VAS) pain score was recorded at all time points, and functional mobility was assessed with use of the timed Up & Go test. The Harris hip score (HHS) was used to assess hip function more specifically. Quality of life was measured with the EuroQol- 5 D (EQ- 5 D). Radiographic findings as well as intraoperative and postoperative complications were recorded and analyzed. Results: Patients treated with an INTERTAN nail had slightly less pain at the time of early postoperative mobilization (VAS score, 48 versus 52; p = 0. 042), although this did not influence the length of the hospital stay and there was no difference at three or twelve months. Regardless of the fracture and implant type, functional mobility, hip function, patient satisfaction, and quality-of-life assessments were comparable between the groups at three and twelve months. The numbers of patients with surgical complications were similar for the two groups (twenty-nine in the sliding-hip-screw group and thirty-two in the INTERTAN group, p = 0. 67).

2500|$|The Waseda University (Japan) and NTT Docomo's {{manufacturers}} {{have succeeded in}} creating a shape-shifting robot WD-2. It is capable of changing its face. At first, the creators decided {{the positions of the}} necessary points to express the outline, eyes, nose, and so on of a certain person. The robot expresses its face by moving all points to the decided positions, they say. The first version of the robot was first developed back in 2003. After that, a year later, they made a couple of major improvements to the design. The robot features an elastic mask made from the average head dummy. It uses a driving system with a 3DOF unit. The WD-2 robot can change its facial features by activating specific facial points on a mask, with each point possessing three degrees of freedom. This one has 17 facial points, for a total of 56 degrees of freedom. As for the materials they used, the WD-2's mask is fabricated with a highly elastic material called Septom, with bits of steel wool mixed in for added strength. Other technical features reveal a shaft driven behind the mask at the desired facial point, driven by a DC motor with a simple pulley and <b>a</b> <b>slide</b> <b>screw.</b> Apparently, the researchers can also modify the shape of the mask based on actual human faces. To [...] "copy" [...] a face, they need only a 3D scanner to determine the locations of an individual's 17 facial points. After that, they are then driven into position using a laptop and 56 motor control boards. In addition, the researchers also mention that the shifting robot can even display an individual's hair style and skin color if a photo of their face is projected onto the 3D Mask.|$|R

After multivariable Logistic regression analysis adjusting for possible confounding factors there was an increased risk for reoperation for displaced fractures (22 %) compared to undisplaced fractures (3 %), and for fractures with poor implant position (38 %) compared to fractures with adequate implant position (15 %). Conclusions The reoperation rate was high, and special attention should be given to achieve an appropriate position of the implant. </p...|$|R

A 45 -year-old male underwent anterior rotational osteotomy for osteonecrosis {{of the left}} femoral head. A radiograph obtained 4 months after surgery showed the presence of osteolytic lesions around the trochanteric wire, and the transtrochanteric osteotomy site appeared to be fuzzy. In spite of the continuation of partial weight bearing, osteolytic changes progressed. An open biopsy was performed 13 months after surgery. Samples were taken from multiple sites, including osteolytic lesions, {{one of which was}} confirmed to contain coagulase-negative staphylococcus. Nineteen days after performing thorough debridement and irrigation, the patient underwent a refixation of the osteotomy site using an iliac bone graft and <b>a</b> <b>sliding</b> hip <b>screw</b> system. <b>A</b> radiograph obtained at the final follow-up revealed bone union at the site of osteotomy.

40|$|A 48 {{year old}} male patient (heavy smoker) {{sustained}} a high energy, two level, comminuted fracture (pertrochanteric and mid-diaphyseal), {{of his right}} femur in a road traffic accident. He initially underwent internal fixation of both fractures with <b>a</b> hip <b>sliding</b> <b>screw</b> and <b>a</b> dynamic compression plate, at an emergency basis. Despite several surgical attempts at fixation (plates and external fixators) and biological enhancement of the nonunion environment (autologous bone grafting in combination with bone morpho-genetic protein 7), the mid-diaphysis femoral fracture failed to unite and structural failures of the materials of internal fixation were observed (Figure 1). During the treatment course, smoking, high energy of both bone and soft tissue envelope trauma, fracture comminution and iatrogenic technical fixation errors were recog-nized as causative factors {{for the development of}} nonunion. Alter-native anabolic treatment strategies for fracture healing were considered following a thorough literature search. An “off label”, daily dose of PTH 1 - 84, was administered to the patient for a pe-riod of two months. At {{the end of the second}} month, satisfactory radiological callus formation was observed and the patient was al-lowed to walk full weight bearing. At one year follow up, the pa-tient regained painless, full range, motion of the adjacent joints and walked with a mild limp due to a minor leg length discrepancy...|$|R
40|$|Background Hip {{fractures}} are {{a common}} type of fragility fracture that afflict 293, 000 Americans (over 5, 000 per week) and 35, 000 Canadians (over 670 per week) annually. Despite the large population impact the optimal fixation technique for low energy femoral neck fractures remains controversial. The primary objective of the FAITH study is {{to assess the impact}} of cancellous <b>screw</b> fixation versus <b>sliding</b> hip <b>screws</b> on rates of revision surgery at 24 months in individuals with femoral neck fractures. The secondary objective is to determine the impact on health-related quality of life, functional outcomes, health state utilities, fracture healing, mortality and fracture-related adverse events. Methods/Design FAITH is a multi-centre, multi-national randomized controlled trial utilizing minimization to determine patient allocation. Surgeons in North America, Europe, Australia, and Asia will recruit a total of at least 1, 000 patients with low-energy femoral neck fractures. Using central randomization, patients will be allocated to receive surgical treatment with cancellous <b>screws</b> or <b>a</b> <b>sliding</b> hip <b>screw.</b> Patient outcomes will be assessed at one week (baseline), 10 weeks, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months post initial fixation.

40|$|As the world’s {{population}} ages, hip fractures pose {{a significant}} health care problem. Hip fractures {{in the elderly}} are associated with impaired mobility, and increased morbidity and mortality. Associated conditions, such as osteoporosis, medical comorbidity, and dementia, pose a significant concern and determine optimal treatment. One-year mortality rates currently range from 14 % to 36 %, and care for these patients represents a major global economic burden. The incidence of hip fractures is bimodal in its distribution. Young adult hip fractures {{are the result of}} high energy trauma, and the larger peak seen in the elderly population is secondary to low-energy injuries. The predilection for the site of fracture at the neck of femur falls into two major subgroups. Pertrochanteric fractures occur when the injury is extracapsular and the blood supply to the head of femur is unaffected. The management of this group involves internal fixation through <b>a</b> <b>sliding</b> hip <b>screw</b> device or intramedullary fixation device, both of which have good results. The other group of patients who sustain an intracapsular fracture at the femoral neck are at increased risk of nonunion and osteonecrosis.
