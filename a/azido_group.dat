25|$|There are {{different}} classes of drugs directed against thymidine metabolism and thereby involving thymidine kinase {{that are used}} to control cancer associated cell division. Chain terminators are thymidine analogues that are included in the growing DNA chain, but modified so that the chain cannot be further elongated. As analogs of thymidine, this type of drugs are readily phosphorylated to 5'-monophosphates. The monophosphate is further phosphorylated to the corresponding triphosphate and incorporated in the growing DNA chain. The analog has been modified so that it does not have the hydroxyl group in the 3'-position that is required for continued chain growth. In zidovudine (AZT; ATC:J05AF01) the 3'-hydroxyl group has been replaced by an <b>azido</b> <b>group,</b> in stavudine (ATC: J05AF04) it has been removed without replacement. AZT is used as substrate in one of the methods for determination of thymidine kinase in serum. This implies that AZT interferes with this method and may be a limitation: AZT is a standard component of HAART therapy in HIV infection. One common consequence of AIDS is lymphoma and the most important diagnostic application of thymidine kinase determination is for monitoring of lymphoma.|$|E

50|$|The main {{interest}} in Ro15-4513 was {{as an antidote}} to alcohol. Flumazenil effectively blocks the effects of benzodiazepine agonists such as alprazolam and diazepam and so is used for treating overdoses of these drugs but is ineffective in blocking alcohol actions. Ro15-4513 was somewhat less effective than flumazenil at blocking the effects of benzodiazepines, but instead selectively blocked the effects of ethanol. This meant that in contrast to flumazenil, which is ineffective at treating alcohol overdoses, Ro15-4513 showed potential as a useful alcohol antidote. It is thought that Ro15-4513 antagonizes the effects of ethanol because the <b>azido</b> <b>group</b> at the 8- position of the benzene ring blocks the binding site for ethanol on the α4β3δ subtype of the GABAA receptor; flumazenil, which has a fluorine at this position, does not block this binding site and so does not counteract the effects of ethanol.|$|E
50|$|In 1964 {{zidovudine}} (AZT) was synthesized by Horwitz at the Michigan Cancer Foundation. The 3´hydroxyl {{group in}} the deoxyribose ring of thymidine is replaced by an <b>azido</b> <b>group</b> which gives us zidovudine. The lack of the 3´hydroxyl group which provides the attachment point for the next nucleotide in the growing DNA chain during the reverse transcription makes it an obligate chain terminator. Ziduvodine is incorporated in place of thymidine and is an extremely potent inhibitor of HIV replication. This compound had been prepared in 1964 as a potential anti-cancer agent but was shown to be ineffective. In 1974 zidovudine {{was reported to have}} activity against retroviruses and was subsequently re-screened as an antiviral when the AIDS epidemic hit Western societies during themid 1980‘s. However, ziduvodine is relatively toxic since it is converted into thetriphosphate by the cellular enzymes and therefore it is activated in uninfected cells.|$|E

Azido-terminated silica nanoparticles were prepared by the functionalization of bare silica nanoparticles with 3 -aminopropyltrimethoxysilane followed by the reaction with 4 -azidobenzoic acid. The azido functionalization was confirmed by FTIR and XPS. Poly(allylamine hydrochloride) was also grafted with phenyl <b>azido</b> <b>groups</b> and used as photoreactive polycations for LbL assembly. For the photoreactive silica nanoparticle/polycation multilayers, UV irradiation can induce the covalent cross-linking within the multilayers {{as well as the}} anchoring of the multilayer film onto the organic substrate, through azido photochemical reactions including C–H insertion/abstraction reactions with surrounding molecules and dimerization of <b>azido</b> <b>groups.</b> Our results show that the stability of the silica nanoparticle/polycation multilayer film was greatly improved after UV irradiation. Combined with a fluoroalkylsilane post-treatment, the photoreactive LbL multilayers were used as a coating for superhydrophobic modification of cotton fabrics. Herein the LbL assembly method enables us to tailor the number of the coated silica nanoparticles through the assembly cycles. The superhydrophobicity of cotton fabrics was durable against acids, bases, and organic solvents, as well as repeated machine wash. Because of the unique azido photochemistry, the approach used here to anchor silica nanoparticles is applicable to almost any organic substrate. <br /...|$|R

40|$|INGENIERIE+TLE:JEC:DFAWe have {{developed}} a generic two-step post-functionalisation technique for transforming amino-functionalised MOFs into their isocyanate analogues. The {{first part of the}} synthetic pathway consists in the conversion of the amino moieties into <b>azido</b> <b>groups.</b> Next, the thermal activation of these <b>azido</b> <b>groups</b> leads to nitrene species that can react with carbon monoxide to yield the desired products. As a proof of concept, this method was applied to the highly stable Al-MIL- 53 -NH 2 and to the acid-sensitive In-MIL- 68 -NH 2. The resulting nitrene species were highly reactive, with side reactions dominating initially. This issue was overcome {{through the use of a}} mixed-linker strategy applied during the MOF synthesis that decreased the nitrene radical density within the pore, thereby permitting In-MIL- 68 -NH 2 to be converted into its isocyanate analogue with 100 % selectivity.

Substitution of the –CH 3 {{group on the}} secondary amine group of the N,N-dimethyldiamine fragment of the Schiff base by a H-atom leads to a structural change from a methoxido-bridged dimer (1) to a single hydroxido-bridged dimer (2). Both complexes have been characterized by single-crystal X-ray analyses, IR and UV–Vis spectroscopy and DFT studies. Both dimers are centrosymmetric containing two FeIII atoms which are bridged by two methoxido ions in compound 1 and by two hydroxido ions in compound 2.
