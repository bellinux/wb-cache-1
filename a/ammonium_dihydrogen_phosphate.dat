Plywoods were manufactured using urea melamine formaldehyde resin mixed with <b>ammonium</b> pentaborate or <b>dihydrogen</b> <b>phosphate.</b> Treated plywoods had better incombustibility than untreated ones.

The activating agent markedly influenced yield, elemental composition, and textural properties of the ACC. The ACC obtained with phosphoric and boric acids were essentially microporous, whereas those developed with the other reagents presented mesoporosity development. Phosphoric acid-derived samples showed the highest specific surface area (976 m 2 /g). The results also highlight the relevance of correcting the external surface adsorption in order to obtain reliable estimates of micropore volume.
