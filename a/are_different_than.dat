5|$|The track lengths for {{a number}} of tracks on all three discs <b>are</b> <b>different</b> <b>than</b> the Original Sound Version release. On the first disc, tracks 24-27 are new {{arranged}} version tracks that were included as the music from those tracks corresponded to the video animated sequences that were added originally on the PlayStation version. The same applied to tracks 25-27 on the second disc and tracks 18-24 on the third disc.|$|E
25|$|Traditional or trad {{climbing}} involves {{rock climbing}} routes in which protection against falls is placed by the climber while ascending, or bolts placed on lead. Gear {{is used to}} protect against falls but not to aid the ascent directly. Traditional bolted face climbs <b>are</b> <b>different</b> <b>than</b> sport climbs. Trad bolted climbs use either a hand drill and or are bolted on lead. This means there are far fewer bolts and they are spaced out farther than sport climbs.|$|E

25|$|Another common {{theory is}} that the waitoreke is {{actually}} a beaver. This is because several of the sightings report that the waitoreke lives in dams like those of a beaver. The fur color of a beaver is also close to that of the description of a waitoreke. However, the body shape and the tail structure of a waitoreke <b>are</b> <b>different</b> <b>than</b> that of a beaver. If the waitoreke was a beaver it would most likely be introduced by European settlers and would then be related to the European beaver.|$|E
25|$|Producers {{organize}} and strive for Fair Trade certification for several reasons, either through religious ties, wants for social justice, wants for autonomy, political liberalization, or {{simply because they}} want to be paid more for their labor efforts and products. Farmers are more likely to identify with organic farming than Fair Trade farming practices because organic farming is a very visible way that these farmers <b>are</b> <b>different</b> <b>than</b> their neighbors and it actually influences the way they farm. They place a significant importance on natural growing methods. Fair Trade farmers are also more likely to attribute their higher paid prices to the quality of their products rather than fair market prices.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{traditional}} for each Kent student {{to have a}} job while they are at school.This tradition dates back to {{the early days of the}} school when it was mainly self-sufficient. These are not jobs in the typical sense but are rather different duties and obligations that each student will have. Some jobs are very basic, such as washing tables after dinner or keeping a common room neat. Others are more involved, such as being a student tour guide or being a student computer technician. The job program is an integral part of the school's history and character even if many of the jobs <b>are</b> <b>different</b> <b>than</b> when they were originally created.|$|E

25|$|A {{significant}} area {{of research}} {{has been on the}} use of plasma polymer films as permeation membranes. The permeability characteristics of plasma polymers deposited on porous substrates <b>are</b> <b>different</b> <b>than</b> usual polymer films. The characteristics depend on the deposition and polymerization mechanism. Plasma polymers as membranes for separation of oxygen and nitrogen, ethanol and water, and water vapor permeation have all been studied. The application of plasma polymerized thin films as reverse osmosis membranes has received considerable attention as well. Yasuda et al. have shown membranes prepared with plasma polymerization made from nitrogen containing monomers can yield up to 98% salt rejection with a flux of 6.4 gallons/ft2 a day. Further research has shown that varying the monomers of the membrane offer other properties as well, such as chlorine resistance.|$|E
25|$|Level {{crossings}} (Bahnübergang in German) in Germany <b>are</b> <b>different</b> <b>than</b> {{some other}} level crossings throughout Europe. These crossings use {{yellow and red}} lights and a bell/alarm (some crossings do not have these though) {{to indicate that the}} crossing is active. When activating a preliminary yellow light flashes which is followed by a red light that stays lit until the train(s) have cleared the crossing. Most of these crossings usually have a lightning symbol on the crossbucks. These symbols indicate that the railway is electrified with overhead wires. Older crossings have a single red light on a square backboard with a red and white boarder. After crossing the level crossing, unless there is a speed limit sign, the speed limit is the national speed limit. That is, 50km/h for built up areas and 100km/h outside built up areas.|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} to understand that the risks and benefits associated with oophorectomy in the BRCA1/2 mutation carrier population <b>are</b> <b>different</b> <b>than</b> those for the general population. Prophylactic risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) is an important option for the high-risk population to consider. Women with BRCA1/2 mutations who undergo salpingo-oophorectomy have lower all-cause mortality rates than women in the same population who do not undergo this procedure. In addition, RRSO has been shown to decrease mortality specific to breast cancer and ovarian cancer. Women who undergo RRSO are also at a lower risk for developing ovarian cancer and first occurrence breast cancer. Specifically, RRSO provides BRCA1 mutation carriers with no prior breast cancer a 70% reduction of ovarian cancer risk. BRCA1 mutation carriers with prior breast cancer can benefit from an 85% reduction. High-risk women who have not had prior breast cancer can benefit from a 37% (BRCA1 mutation) and 64% (BRCA2 mutation) reduction of breast cancer risk. These benefits are important to highlight, as they are unique to this BRCA1/2 mutation carrier population.|$|E

25|$|Brothers & Sisters was renewed for a fifth {{season on}} March 5, 2010. It premiered on September 26, 2010 on ABC. The {{events of the}} fifth season begin {{one year after the}} season 4 finale. Rebecca {{divorced}} Justin and was written out of the show early in the fifth season. A lot has changed for both the characters, and the show's viewers in the final season. The show lost two cast members: Rebecca Harper (Emily VanCamp) and Robert McCallister (Rob Lowe). These two losses were not the only major changes that occurred in season five. The Ojai Foods building, the Walker's family business, is not seen in the final season and many locations <b>are</b> <b>different</b> <b>than</b> in the last season. Kitty no longer lives at the ranch in Santa Barbara, but has moved into a smaller house with her son, Evan, after a short stay at a cottage in Ojai. Kevin and Scotty moved out of their apartment and into a different one which is located above Cafe 429 (the restaurant that Scotty and Saul opened). Cafe 429, and Nora's new workplace – the radio station, are two primary locations where many scenes take place in season five. One location that the audience does not see as much is Nora's house. For four seasons, the family home has been the location where most scenes were shot. That said, all of these changes have been made to fit in with the characters' new lives and chapters.|$|E
500|$|While {{discussing}} the song's theme with French radio Europe 1, Madonna {{spoke about the}} intolerance going around the world, especially in France whom she believed to have lost its ability to accept people of all race and color.

[...] "The way we behave, to treat one another the way we're treating one another, to maintain this level of intolerance and discriminatory prejudice... hateful behavior towards other human beings who <b>are</b> <b>different</b> <b>than</b> you are," [...] Madonna concluded.|$|E

500|$|Long-term methamphetamine use {{can cause}} parafunctional habits, routine {{actions of a}} body part that <b>are</b> <b>different</b> <b>than</b> their common use, which can result in tooth wear and {{exacerbate}} periodontal diseases. One such habit that may affect the development of meth mouth is bruxism, particularly as the drug's effects wane and stereotypy occurs, a phase that {{is often referred to}} as [...] "tweaking". This bruxism may be due to a drug-induced increase in monoamines. Other behaviors of long-term methamphetamine users that may cause or accelerate the symptoms of meth mouth are the failure to pay attention to oral hygiene and excessive food intake during binges, especially sugary foods; the drug's users often report strong cravings for sugar and consume large amounts of high-sugar beverages. The altered mental state that accompanies methamphetamine use lasts longer than that of some other common drugs, increasing the amount of time the user engages in drug-induced behavior.|$|E
500|$|During an {{interview}} with Billboard, West revealed that he had worked with Chris Martin, the lead singer of the British alternative rock band Coldplay, on a song entitled [...] "Homecoming", and that it just might possibly be released as the lead single for Graduation. The collaboration occurred the year before when Kanye West and Chris Martin met one another during an impromptu jam session at the Abbey Road Studios in London, England. West had just finished performing at a show that had been held at Abbey Road and the band just so happened to be recording their music in the recording studio {{at exactly the same}} time. The song in itself is actually a re-vamping for [...] "Home (Windy)", a track that originated from a demo tape dating back to the year 2001. It was made available two years later under the new title [...] "Home" [...] on West's 2003 mixtape Get Well Soon... and also on the advance copy of West's debut studio album The College Dropout, which due to a leak was never released. This original version possesses Kanye West's once trademark classic soul vocal sample production style, with singer John Legend on the chorus, which contains lyrics that <b>are</b> <b>different</b> <b>than</b> Martin's. This {{is due to the fact}} that Chris Martin asked Kanye West to change the song's lyrical content.|$|E

500|$|Although McDuffie {{stressed}} that the show remains loyal to [...] "the spirit and the tone" [...] of the comic book, some changes were done because of its timeslot and target audience of pre-teens. For example, guns appeared less frequently, Richie is not portrayed as a homosexual, and he is Virgil's confidant instead of Frieda. Virgil is also younger in the animated series, his costumes and use of his powers <b>are</b> <b>different</b> <b>than</b> the original, and his mother is dead in the show despite she is alive in the comics. The latter change was done because producers had the intention [...] "to focus on a strong, complex relationship between an African-American father and son." [...] Nevertheless, McDuffie was concerned by the change because he originally intended to oppose the stereotype of black people not having a complete nuclear family. However, McDuffie said [...] "that [...] worked out okay" [...] as the crew could use the absence of Virgil's mother to create a [...] "couple of great stories". Virgil's father, Robert, [...] "for all intents and purposes, is a new character", as he was reconceptualized as a social worker. The same goes for Richie, who is described as an amalgam of different characters from the original comic. For the villains, Hotstreak was reused from the Static comics, Edwin Alva was brought from another Milestone's series—Hardware—, and the group Meta-Breed was created for the TV series.|$|E
