25|$|To {{explain these}} facts, historians {{have pointed to}} the {{influence}} of Cantor's former professors, Karl Weierstrass and Leopold Kronecker. Cantor discussed his results with Weierstrass on December 23, 1873. Weierstrass was first amazed by the concept of countability, but then found the countability of the set of real algebraic numbers useful. Cantor did not want to publish yet, but Weierstrass felt that he must publish <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>his</b> results concerning the algebraic numbers.|$|E

25|$|The Case of Executing Chen Shimei (鍘美案): Chen Shimei had two {{children}} with wife Qin Xianglian, when he left them behind in his hometown for the Imperial examination in the capital. After placing first, he lied about his marriage and became the emperor’s new brother-in-law. Years later, a famine forced Qin and her children {{to move to the}} capital, where they learned what happened to Chen. Qin finally found a way to meet Chen and begged him to help <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>his</b> own children. Not only did Chen refuse, he sent his servant Han Qi to kill them to hide his secret, but Han helped the family escape and killed himself. Desperate, Qin brought her case to Bao Zheng, who tricked Chen to the court to have him arrested. The imperial family intervened with threats, but Bao executed him nonetheless.|$|E

500|$|Brad Wete of Complex disagreed, {{calling the}} song, along with [...] "Lemme See", a [...] "gem". Andrew Unterberger of Popdust called the song [...] "not exactly single-worthy material", being [...] "a hobbled-together bunch of musical cliches, where David Guetta stadium house beats meets Skrillex wub-wubs, like {{the brainchild of}} the most uncreative EDM think tank possible." [...] According to Unterberger, the lyrics are [...] "even more hackneyed", with its [...] "Kardashian-worthy opening lines" [...] Evan Rytlewski of The A.V. Club both [...] "Can't Stop Won't Stop" [...] and [...] "Scream" [...] as two [...] "overinflated dance numbers" [...] that open the album on a [...] "discouragingly {{perfunctory}} note".

500|$|In 1924, Monteux began {{a ten-year}} {{association}} with the Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam, serving as [...] "first conductor" [...] ("eerste dirigent") alongside Willem Mengelberg, its long-serving chief conductor. The two musicians liked and respected one another, despite the difference in their approach to music-making: Monteux was scrupulous in his adherence to a composer's score and straightforward in his performances, while Mengelberg was well known for his virtuoso, sometimes wilful, interpretations and his cavalier attitude to the score ("Ve vill make some changements", as an English player quoted him). Their preferred repertoire overlapped {{in some of the}} classics, but Mengelberg had his own favourites from Bach's St. Matthew Passion to Mahler symphonies, and was happy to leave Debussy and Stravinsky to Monteux. Where their choices coincided, as in Beethoven, Brahms and Richard Strauss, Mengelberg was generous in giving Monteux <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>his</b> fair share of them.|$|E
500|$|On-court fights {{had been}} all too common in the 1970s, often {{including}} bench-clearing brawls. In the season opener, when Abdul-Jabbar punched Benson, no suspension had been levied. However, Washington's punch resulted in the league enacting strict penalties for on-court fights. Former NBA commissioner David Stern, then the NBA's chief counsel, later said that the incident made NBA officials realize that [...] "you couldn't allow men that big and that strong to go around throwing punches at each other." [...] Currently, any player who throws a punch at another player—even if he misses—is automatically ejected from the game, and suspended for <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>his</b> team's next game. The league added a third referee to its game crew after the season; this referee would have trailed the play and could have called a foul when Washington grabbed Kunnert's shorts, thereby potentially stopping the play and preventing the melee that succeeded it.|$|E
500|$|In 1948, Shostakovich, {{along with}} many other composers, was again denounced for {{formalism}} in the Zhdanov decree. Andrei Zhdanov, Chairman of the RSFSR Supreme Soviet, accused Shostakovich and other composers (such as Sergei Prokofiev and Aram Khachaturian) of writing inappropriate and formalist music. This was part of an ongoing anti-formalism campaign intended to root out all Western compositional influence as well as any perceived [...] "non-Russian" [...] output. The conference resulted in the publication of the Central Committee’s Decree [...] "On V. Muradeli’s opera The Great Friendship," [...] which was targeted towards all Soviet composers and demanded that they write only [...] "proletarian" [...] music, or music for the masses. The accused composers, including Shostakovich, were summoned to make public apologies in front of the committee. Most of Shostakovich's works were banned, and his family had privileges withdrawn. Yuri Lyubimov says that at this time [...] "he waited for his arrest at night out on the landing by the lift, so that <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>his</b> family wouldn't be disturbed." ...|$|E
