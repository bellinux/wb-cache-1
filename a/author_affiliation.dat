5000|$|A 2011 {{analysis}} by Diels et al., reviewed 94 peer-reviewed studies pertaining to GMO safety {{to assess whether}} conflicts of interest correlated with outcomes that cast GMOs in a favorable light. They found that financial conflict of interest {{was not associated with}} study outcome (p = 0.631) while <b>author</b> <b>affiliation</b> to industry (i.e., a professional conflict of interest) was strongly associated with study outcome (p < 0.001). Of the 94 studies that were analyzed, 52% did not declare funding. 10% of the studies were categorized as [...] "undetermined" [...] with regard to professional conflict of interest. Of the 43 studies with financial or professional conflicts of interest, 28 studies were compositional studies. According to Marc Brazeau, an association between professional conflict of interest and positive study outcomes can be skewed because companies typically contract with independent researchers to perform follow-up studies only after in-house research uncovers favorable results. In-house research that uncovers negative or unfavorable results for a novel GMO is generally not further pursued.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The authors {{sought to}} {{determine}} whether unexpected gaps existed in Scopus’s <b>author</b> <b>affiliation</b> indexing of publications written by the University of Nebraska Medical Center or Nebraska Medicine (UNMC/NM) authors during 2014. Methods: First, we compared Scopus affiliation identifier search results to PubMed affiliation keyword search results. Then, we searched Scopus using affiliation keywords (UNMC, etc.) and compared the results to PubMed affiliation keyword and Scopus affiliation identifier searches. Results: We found that Scopus’s records for approximately 7 % of UNMC/NM authors’ publications lacked appropriate UNMC/NM <b>author</b> <b>affiliation</b> identifiers, and many journals’ publishers were supplying incomplete <b>author</b> <b>affiliation</b> information to PubMed. Conclusions: Institutions relying on Scopus to track their impact should determine whether Scopus’s affiliation identifiers will, in fact, identify all articles published by their authors and investigators...|$|E
40|$|Several {{publications}} {{have appeared}} in the field of Operations Management which rank Operations Management related journals. Several ranking systems exist for journals based on, for example, perceived relevance and quality, citation, and <b>author</b> <b>affiliation.</b> Many academics also publish at conferences but we have not come across publications that rank conferences. Conference rankings are generally more complicated than journal rankings. Journal rankings are primarily for publishing purposes. Conferences on the other hand are attended by people for different reasons. In this paper the first attempt is made in developing an operations management conference ranking based upon <b>author</b> <b>affiliation.</b> Ranking based on an analysis of <b>author</b> <b>affiliation</b> assumes that one important motive for participants is to attend a high quality research conference. With that assumption it is reasonable to use the <b>author</b> <b>affiliation</b> approach. Based upon an existing ranking of institutes that offer operations management programs a ranking list of affiliations is developed. Subsequently, we compare several operations management related conferences such as POMS, EurOMA, OSCM and the Operations Management Division of the Academy of Management based on that ranked list of institutes. The results provide information for authors that help in deciding which operations management oriented conferences to attend...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we use a}} new method to rank finance journals. Traditionally, journal qualities are {{measured}} either by the citation-based impact factor approach, or by the survey method. Although these two approaches have merits, their efficacy is also limited in many ways. <b>Author</b> <b>Affiliation</b> Index is a cost-effective and intuitively easy-to-understand approach to journal rankings. We define <b>Author</b> <b>Affiliation</b> Index as the ratio of articles authored by faculties at the world’s top 80 finance programs divided {{by the total number}} of articles by all authors. Forty-one finance journals are ranked according to this index. The effectiveness of the index is comparable to prior citation-based and survey-based studies. We find <b>Author</b> <b>Affiliation</b> Index, if properly constructed, provides an easy and credible way to supplement the existing journal ranking methods. Due to its easiness to construct, the index is particularly useful for junior faculty seeking the right journals to publish but is unable to justify the journal quality because these journals are not ranked in existing studies...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we use a}} new method to rank finance {{journals}} and study the pattern of authorship/co-authorship across journals. <b>Author</b> <b>Affiliation</b> Index is a cost-effective and intuitively easy-to-understand approach to journal rankings. We define <b>Author</b> <b>Affiliation</b> Index as the ratio of articles authored by faculties at the world’s top 80 finance programs divided {{by the total number}} of articles by all authors. Forty-one finance journals are ranked according to this index. If properly constructed, <b>Author</b> <b>Affiliation</b> Index provides an easy and credible way to supplement the existing journal ranking methods. Our ranking system reveals journal-researcher clienteles, and we find that collaboration (co-authoring) between faculty within elite programs exists only in top-tier and near-top-tier journals. Publications in low-tier journals by researchers of elite programs are driven by their co-authors. Collaboration between faculty in elite and non-elite programs, however, is more prevalent than that within elite programs across all tiers of journals. Co-authorship among top 80 programs, nevertheless, is more common in top-tier journals; while co-authorship between top 80 and other programs is more dominant in lower-ranked journals...|$|E

40|$|Bibliographical data such as title, <b>author,</b> <b>affiliation,</b> and {{abstract}} are crucial for indexing biomedical journal articles. The Medical Article Records System (MARS) {{has been developed}} at the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to automate bibliographical data extraction for MEDLINE®, the NLM’s premier database of citations to the biomedical literature. The automatic extraction of bibliographic data involves the process of assigning logical labels (title, <b>author,</b> <b>affiliation,</b> {{and abstract}}) to homogeneous regions or zones on page images. While an OCR- and rule-based labeling module (called ZoneCzar) in MARS can reliably label medical journals with regular layout styles, it cannot accurately label the journals with arbitrary or unusual layout styles, and new rules have to be manually created for these journals. Furthermore, the OCR zoning errors, particularly merging errors, can greatly affect the labeling accuracy of ZoneCzar. In this paper, we describe an algorithm for automatic generation of robust features that are used by the labeling algorithm to perform style-independent labeling...|$|E
