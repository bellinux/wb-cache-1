40|$|<b>Arch</b> <b>bridges</b> {{are one of}} the popular, {{oldest and}} graceful bridges which are being built in zones of the city and out of the city. However arches becomes {{especially}} sensitive to their buckling response due to dominated compressive force in the arch. In order to ensure stability conditions of the individual <b>arch</b> and <b>arch</b> <b>bridges,</b> it is estimated not just geometrical factor of arch, residual stress, work conditions, geometric imperfections but geometrical nonlinearity too. Geometric nonlinearity especially dominates in many times static indeterminable systems such as network <b>arch</b> <b>bridges.</b> However there are a few represents of estimation of geometric nonlinearity of the new construction form of the <b>arch</b> <b>bridges</b> created in a middle of 20 th century. This paper represents estimation of geometric nonlinearity with numerical method of the steel <b>arch</b> <b>bridges</b> with vertical hangers and network <b>arch</b> <b>bridges.</b> There are determined stress-strain law and principal behavior of the steel network <b>arch</b> <b>bridges</b> under symmetric and asymmetric pedestrian loadings...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper briefly {{introduces}} {{the present situation}} of concrete <b>arch</b> <b>bridges</b> in China. About two hundred concrete <b>arch</b> <b>bridges</b> with spans equal to or longer than 100 m were investigated. A brief review of its development is presented. Structures of concrete <b>arch</b> <b>bridges</b> including the <b>arch</b> axis, ratio of rise-to–span, cross section and the construction methods are analyzed based on the investigation data...|$|R
5|$|Engineer Thomas Page was {{appointed}} to build the bridge, and presented the Commission with several potential designs, including a seven-span stone bridge, a five-span cast iron <b>arch</b> <b>bridge,</b> and a suspension bridge. The Commission selected the suspension bridge design, and work began in 1851 on the new bridge, {{to be called the}} Victoria Bridge.|$|E
5|$|From Han {{literary}} sources, it {{is known}} that wooden-trestle beam bridges, arch bridges, simple suspension bridges, and floating pontoon bridges existed in Han China. However, there are only two known references to arch bridges in Han literature, and only a single Han relief sculpture in Sichuan depicts an <b>arch</b> <b>bridge.</b>|$|E
5|$|Other {{examples}} of Song bridges include Guyue Bridge, a stone <b>arch</b> <b>bridge</b> in Yiwu, Zhejiang Province. The bridge {{was built in}} 1213, the sixth year of the Jiading Era in the Southern Song dynasty. Song-era pontoon bridges include the Dongjin Bridge, 400m (mi) long, which may still be seen today.|$|E

50|$|The Sixth, Seventh, and Tenth Street Stone <b>Arch</b> <b>Bridges</b> {{are three}} stone <b>arch</b> <b>bridges</b> in Charleston, Illinois, which carry Sixth, Seventh, and Tenth Streets across the Town Branch of Cassell Creek. Prominent local stonemason Alexander Briggs built the three bridges during the 1890s, when {{increasing}} development in Charleston expanded across the creek. The three bridges were all built from locally quarried limestone, {{and each has}} a single arch design with abutments at both ends. While Charleston has thirteen bridges across the Town Branch, these three are the only stone <b>arch</b> <b>bridges</b> in the city.|$|R

5|$|Over {{time the}} road was paved, {{upgraded}} and straightened. Some parts are now built to freeway standards. Among the more notable upgrades, the Los Peñasquitos Creek <b>Arch</b> <b>Bridge,</b> along the portion of former US395 now used by I-15, was built in 1949, and replaced in 1964, with a second span built in 1977.|$|E
5|$|The Division Street Bridge is architecturally {{significant}} as the longest stone <b>arch</b> <b>bridge</b> in Rhode Island and historically {{significant as}} a symbolic gesture to link and unify the two rapidly growing neighborhoods on Pawtucket Falls under the newly formed Town of Pawtucket. The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.|$|E
5|$|A steel <b>arch</b> <b>bridge</b> {{was built}} in the 1950s over the Northeast Arm. It was named the East River Bridge. It was {{replaced}} by a new bridge with the same name in December 2015.

Dating to the Greek Bronze Age (13th century BC), {{it is one of the}} oldest <b>arch</b> <b>bridges</b> still in existence and use.Several intact <b>arched</b> stone <b>bridges</b> from the Hellenistic era can be found in the Peloponnese.|$|R
5|$|Battersea Bridge is a five-span <b>arch</b> <b>bridge</b> with {{cast-iron}} girders and granite piers {{crossing the}} River Thames in London, England. It is situated on a sharp {{bend in the}} river, and links Battersea south of the river with Chelsea to the north. The bridge replaced a ferry service that had operated near the site {{since at least the}} middle of the 16th century.|$|E
5|$|Chiswick Bridge is a {{reinforced}} concrete deck <b>arch</b> <b>bridge</b> over the River Thames in west London. One of three bridges opened in 1933 {{as part of}} an ambitious scheme to relieve traffic congestion west of London, it carries the A316 road between Chiswick on the north bank of the Thames and Mortlake on the south bank.|$|E
5|$|Plunketts Creek Bridge No. 3 was a {{rubble masonry}} stone <b>arch</b> <b>bridge</b> over Plunketts Creek in Plunketts Creek Township, Lycoming County in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. It was built between 1840 and 1875, {{probably}} closer to 1840, when the road along the creek between the unincorporated villages of Barbours and Proctor was constructed. Going upstream from the mouth, {{the bridge was}} the third to cross the creek, hence its name.|$|E

5|$|Many bridge {{designs were}} used for roads over the highway, {{including}} the concrete <b>arch</b> <b>bridge,</b> the through plate girder bridge and the concrete T-beam bridge. Bridges used to carry the turnpike over other roads and streams included a concrete arch viaduct in New Stanton. At , the New Stanton viaduct was the longest bridge along the original section of the turnpike. Other turnpike bridges included plate girder bridges like the bridge over Dunnings Creek in the Bedford Narrows. Smaller concrete T-beam bridges were also built; a total of 307 bridges were constructed along the original section of the turnpike.|$|E
5|$|State Route 174 (SR 174) is a {{state highway}} in the U.S. state of California. The two-lane 13-mile (21 km) highway, added to the state highway system in 1933, connects Interstate 80 in Colfax with SR 20/SR 49 in Grass Valley, {{crossing}} the Bear River next to a 1924 concrete <b>arch</b> <b>bridge.</b> The majority of the highway is eligible for the State Scenic Highway System, but local residents have blocked its designation due to property rights concerns.|$|E
5|$|To {{continue}} economic {{use of the}} river, {{civic leaders}} pushed for plans to build locks and dams, making the Mississippi River navigable above Saint Anthony Falls for the first time. Congressional approval for the Upper Minneapolis Harbor Development Project came in 1937 but it wasn't until 1950 through 1963, that the United States Army Corps of Engineers constructed two sets of locks at the lower dam and at the falls. They also covered the falls with a permanent concrete apron. The project also resulted in the disfiguration of the Stone <b>Arch</b> <b>Bridge</b> by replacing two of the arches with a steel truss.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. As an {{important}} transportation infrastructure, some through and half through <b>arch</b> <b>bridges</b> were collapsed {{at home and}} abroad. And most accidents were caused by the damage of suspenders. From the structural features, through and half through <b>arch</b> <b>bridges</b> were composed of two parts-upper and lower structure. The {{upper part of the}} structure was mainly composed of arch rib, suspender, tie bar, carriageway beam and bridge deck system etc. Research at home and abroad on through and half through <b>arch</b> <b>bridges</b> mainly include: seismic performance, stability, wind vibration, construction, maintenance, suspender tension test, damage identification of the bridges, and so on...|$|R

5|$|Vauxhall Bridge is a Grade II* listed {{steel and}} granite deck <b>arch</b> <b>bridge</b> in central London. It crosses the River Thames in a south–east north–west {{direction}} between Vauxhall {{on the south}} bank and Pimlico on the north bank. Opened in 1906, it replaced an earlier bridge, originally known as Regent Bridge but later renamed Vauxhall Bridge, built between 1809 and 1816 {{as part of a}} scheme for redeveloping the south bank of the Thames. The original bridge was built on the site of a former ferry.|$|E
5|$|After {{crossing}} through Jarbo Gap, SR 70 {{drops down}} into the canyon of the North Fork Feather River, which it follows almost to Quincy, usually {{on the opposite side}} from the Feather River Route; this results in two places where both transportation lines cross the river and each other. The first of these is the Pulga Bridge, an <b>arch</b> <b>bridge</b> that crosses over a lower railroad truss bridge; soon after are the highway's three tunnels through rock formations in the canyon. After a fair distance through the canyon, and that formed by the East Branch North Fork Feather River, SR 70 reaches the junction with State Route 89 near Paxton; Routes 70 and 89 overlap southeast from that point, where the East Branch splits into Indian Creek and Spanish Creek.|$|E
5|$|After {{intersecting}} SR163, {{also known}} as the Cabrillo Freeway, I-805 continues through suburban San Diego, where it meets SR52 in Clairemont Mesa. North of SR52, it closely parallels I-5 near La Jolla, heading northwest. Passing under the Eastgate Mall <b>arch</b> <b>bridge</b> and entering Sorrento Valley, it finally meets its north end at I-5. During the widening project which was completed in 2007, I-5 at the I-805 merge was built to be 21lanes wide. Eastbound SR56 and Carmel Mountain Road are accessible via a parallel carriageway for local traffic heading northbound from I-805; traffic from SR56 westbound can merge onto I-805 from the local bypass.|$|E
