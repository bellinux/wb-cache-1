500|$|In {{many respects}} (to Kennan's consternation) the {{priorities}} of the administration emphasized creating alliances against the Soviets more than negotiating differences with them. In his memoirs, Kennan recalled, [...] "So far <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> we were expecting {{to be able to}} gain our objectives... without making any concessions though, only 'if we were really all-powerful, and could hope to get away with it.' I very much doubted that this was the case." ...|$|E
500|$|An {{officer in}} Washington's staff wrote before the battle, [...] "They {{make a great}} deal of Christmas in Germany, and no doubt the Hessians will drink {{a great deal of}} beer and have a dance to-night. [...] They will be sleepy to-morrow morning." [...] Popular history {{commonly}} portrays the Hessians as drunk from Christmas celebrations. However, historian David Hackett Fischer quotes Patriot John Greenwood, who fought in the battle and supervised Hessians afterward, who wrote, [...] "I am certain not a drop of liquor was drunk during the whole night, nor, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> even a piece of bread eaten." [...] Military historian Edward G. Lengel wrote, [...] "The Germans were dazed and tired but there is no truth to the legend claiming that they were helplessly drunk." ...|$|E
500|$|The film stars Kitty Horn as the maid, but {{the other}} actors in the film are unknown. Both the {{scenario}} writer {{and the director of}} the film are unknown. Produced and released in time for Washington's Birthday, the crossing of the Delaware River was inspired by Emmanuel Leutze's Washington Crossing the Delaware. Though official materials openly postulated as to how Washington received word of the British being weak, Washington's plan was never sporadic and a landing of all the men was not done at the behest of a single maid. American accounts have long held the notion that the Hessian forces would be drunk and sluggish. According to Patriot John Greenwood, who fought in the battle and supervised Hessians afterward, who wrote, [...] "I am certain not a drop of liquor was drunk during the whole night, nor, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> even a piece of bread eaten. The film is presumed lost because the film is not known to be held in any archive or by any collector.|$|E

500|$|There {{are several}} {{fundamental}} {{differences between the}} film and the original source material. For example, the comic {{is set in the}} 1990s, while the film is set sometime between 2028 and 2038: Alan Moore's original story was created as a response to British Thatcherism in the early 1980s and was set as a conflict between a fascist state and anarchism, while the film's story has been changed by the Wachowski [...] Brothers to fit a modern US political context. Alan Moore, however, charged that, in doing so, the story has turned into an American-centric conflict between liberalism and neo-conservatism, and abandons the original anarchist–fascist themes. Moore states that [...] "here wasn't a mention of anarchy as far <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see.</b> The fascism had been completely defanged. I mean, I think that any references to racial purity had been excised, whereas actually, fascists are quite big on racial purity." [...] Furthermore, in the original story, Moore attempted to maintain moral ambiguity, and not to portray the fascists as caricatures, but as realistic, rounded characters. The time limitations of a film meant that the story had to omit or streamline some of the characters, details, and plotlines from the original story. Chiefly, the original graphic novel has the fascists elected legally and kept in power through the general apathy of the public, whereas the film introduces the [...] "St. Mary's virus", a biological weapon engineered and released by the Norsefire Party as a means of clandestinely gaining control over their own country.|$|E
2500|$|On September 10, 2006, Ali was {{endorsed}} by The Washington Post which one county political veteran ranked as only behind that of the Democratic Party for its influence on local voters. The Post said “Political newcomer Saqib Ali has shown good command of issues and would bring new vigor to this district's delegation.” [...] On September Sept. 20, 2006, it was announced Ali had won the Democratic primary in Maryland's 39th Legislative District, defeating incumbent Delegate Joan F. Stern {{for a position on}} the slate with Del's Nancy J. King and Charles E. Barkley for the November general election. Stern had lost the outright endorsement of King and Barkley as she was not seen as a team-player. King noted that [...] "Ali was a 'breath of fresh air' to voters", while political veteran Gene Counihan said [...] "As far <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> he followed the book on how to win an election. I saw him on the campaign trail more than anybody. He was out door-to-door; he had impressive literature. He wanted it." [...] Ali ascribed his electoral victory to connecting with voters. [...] "Our campaign had a lot of energy. It had that underdog feel that struck a chord with people and resonated. When you talk to real voters, not the insiders, they care if you pay attention to them. They remember that you listened to them. People appreciate new blood." ...|$|E

He then lost {{in the first round of}} the ATP Vegeta Croatia Open Umag. Ferrero announced on 12 September 2012, that he would official retire from professional tennis after the Valencia Open 500 in October. He stated that [...] "The Valencia Open 500 will be my last tournament, it's the best possible stage for me to retire. Because of injuries, I was not able to play a full season and it's been a complicated year <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> I didn’t have the same ambition after 14 years on the tour. His final match was in the first round of Valencia, losing to Nicolás Almagro 5–7, 3–6.|$|E
60|$|Anneke now smiled, and {{glancing at}} {{me at the}} same instant, a bright blush suffused her face, though the meaning of my eye, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> easily <b>see,</b> {{strongly}} tempted her to laugh.|$|R

6000|$|The old {{man took}} us to the inn which he recommended, and we found it was the Angel. It was a nice, old-fashioned, queer English house.

60|$|I yielded {{myself to}} the guiding hand, and shortly found myself, so far <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> at {{one side of the}} sanctuary.|$|E

6000|$|When she saw us, {{she started}} back; {{and a deep}} flush swept her face. For a few seconds she paused; {{at such a time}} a few {{succeeding}} seconds seem to lengthen in geometrical progression.

6000|$|... "Pardon, Mademoiselle," [...] <b>I</b> riposted <b>as</b> {{lightly and}} <b>as</b> gallantly <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> [...] "I <b>see</b> before me the {{living proof that}} angels, at any rate, dwell therein." ...|$|R
