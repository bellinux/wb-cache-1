In experiment 1, student participants drove a train simulator with one of four levels of automation: manual (nil), in-cab signalling (low), ATP (medium), and an autopilot (high). Results revealed that driver vigilance was negatively impacted by train automation, but only {{at a high level}} (i. e., an autopilot). This finding was interpreted as relating to driver mental workload. That is, a high LOA may have resulted in drivers being mentally underloaded. This interpretation required empirical validation in the following two experiments. In experiment 2, the task demands of participants in two high LOA groups (suspected of being mentally underloaded) were increased to one of two levels by means of a secondary task. Participants in two low LOA groups had the same treatments, and served as comparison groups. The secondary task was either a sensory <b>vigilance</b> <b>device</b> (low additional task demands) or a cognitive <b>vigilance</b> <b>device</b> (high additional task demands). Results revealed that autopilot supervisor (high LOA) participants were indeed underloaded, even with the sensory <b>vigilance</b> <b>device</b> secondary task. However, autopilot supervisor participants with the cognitive <b>vigilance</b> <b>device</b> secondary task were not underloaded. On the other hand, the in-cab signalling (low LOA) group of participants appeared to be overloaded when concurrently operating the cognitive <b>vigilance</b> <b>device,</b> but not when operating the sensory <b>vigilance</b> <b>device.</b> In experiment 3, the negative impact of a high LOA on driver vigilance was predicted to be counteracted by the additional (high) task demands of the cognitive <b>vigilance</b> <b>device,</b> but not the additional (low) task demands of the sensory <b>vigilance</b> <b>device.</b> This prediction was supported by the results in terms of the cognitive <b>vigilance</b> <b>device.</b> However, the sensory <b>vigilance</b> <b>device</b> also counteracted the negative impact of a high LOA. An explanation for this was in terms of a startling effect of the sensory <b>vigilance</b> <b>device,</b> rather than it being due to increased task demands. Future studies were suggested that could determine if mental overload still occurs when a verbal/auditory, and/or a task-linked, version of the cognitive <b>vigilance</b> <b>device</b> is used...|$|R

40|$|An <b>automatic</b> <b>vigilance</b> {{hypothesis}} {{states that}} humans preferentially attend to negative stimuli, and this attention to negative valence disrupts {{the processing of}} other stimulus properties. Thus, negative words typically elicit slower color naming, word naming, and lexical decisions than neutral or positive words. Larsen, Mercer, and Balota (see record 2006 - 04603 - 006) analyzed the stimuli from 32 published studies, and they found that word valence was confounded with several lexical factors known to affect word recognition. Indeed, with these lexical factors covaried out, Larsen et al. {{found no evidence of}} <b>automatic</b> <b>vigilance.</b> The authors report a more sensitive analysis of 1011 words. Results revealed a small but reliable valence effect, such that negative words (e. g., "shark") elicit slower lexical decisions and naming than positive words (e. g., "beach"). Moreover, the relation between valence and recognition was categorical rather than linear; the extremity of a word's valence did not affect its recognition. This valence effect was not attributable to word length, frequency, orthographic neighborhood size, contextual diversity, first phoneme, or arousal. Thus, the present analysis provides the most powerful demonstration of <b>automatic</b> <b>vigilance</b> to date...|$|R
40|$|In a {{previous}} train simulator experiment (exp. 1), university student drivers, who were confronted with rare safely critical events, had a longer delay initiating emergency braking (inferring reduced vigilance) {{when the train}} had a high Level Of Automation (LOA) - an autopilot -, compared to when the train had a nil, low, or intermediate LOA (all manually driven trains). In this paper, the designs of two follow-up experiments are described. The aim of experiment 2 {{is to determine the}} effects of increasing task demands for train autopilot supervisors, beyond that of the same group in experiment 1, on mental workload. The aim of experiment 3 is to compare two strategies that attempt to counteract the negative effects of high LOAs on driver vigilance.

40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{investigated the}} influence of failure and success on persistent <b>automatic</b> <b>vigilance</b> for task-related information. Participants first had {{to work on a}} series of synonym selection problems for which negative and positive feedback was given independently of their performance. In {{the second part of the}} experiments, words from the synonym selection problems were presented as distractors in a combined naming and tone detection task. Interference effects of the distractors in the secondary tone detection task served as a measure of persistent <b>automatic</b> <b>vigilance</b> that is unbiased by strategic processes. Interference effects were stronger for words from failure tasks than for words from success tasks. Comparing the success and failure conditions against a neutral baseline suggested that this difference is due to both a perseverance of <b>automatic</b> <b>vigilance</b> for failure tasks and an inhibition of cognitive accessibility after success. Automatic attention allocation can be seen as an inter-face that mediates the influences of motivational states on cognitive processing (Derryberry & Tucker, 1994; Rothermund, Wentura, & Bak, 2001). Adopting a goal or task is accompanied by a corresponding attentional set that biases automatic cognitive processing in favor of goal- or task-related information (Houghton & Tipper, 1994; Pashler, 1998). The cognitive accessibility of information relating to a current goal or action plan is increased and goal-related stimuli automatically attrac...|$|R

Moreover, they conclude the effect is categorical. The authors analyze the same data set but include the arousal value of each word. The authors find nonlinear and interaction effects in predicting LDT and naming speed. Not all negative words produce the generic slowdown. Paradoxically, negative words that are moderate to low on arousal produce more LDT slowing than negative words higher on arousal.

The influence of emotion on word recognition has mostly {{been reported in}} prior studies on the <b>automatic</b> <b>vigilance</b> for negative stimuli, but the precise nature of this relationship is unclear. Various models of <b>automatic</b> <b>vigilance</b> have claimed {{that the effect of}} valence on response times is categorical, an inverted U, or interactive with arousal. In the present study, we used a sample of 12, 658 words and included many lexical and semantic control factors to determine the precise nature of the effects of arousal and valence on word recognition. Converging empirical patterns observed in word-level and trial-level data from lexical decision and naming indicate that valence and arousal exert independent monotonic effects: Negative words are recognized more slowly than positive words, and arousing words are recognized more slowly than calming words. Valence explained about 2 % of the variance in word recognition latencies, whereas the effect of arousal was smaller. Valence and arousal do not interact, but both interact with word frequency, such that valence and arousal exert larger effects among low-frequency words than among high-frequency words. These results necessitate a new model of affective word processing whereby the degree of negativity monotonically and independently predicts the speed of responding. This research also demonstrates that incorporating emotional factors, especially valence, improves the performance of models of word recognition...|$|R

40|$|Humans {{preferentially}} {{attend to}} negative stimuli. A {{consequence of this}} <b>automatic</b> <b>vigilance</b> for negative valence is that negative words elicit slower responses than neutral or positive words {{on a host of}} cognitive tasks. Some researchers have speculated that negative stimuli elicit a general suppression of motor activity, akin to the freezing response exhibited by animals under threat. Alternatively, we suggest that negative stimuli only elicit slowed responding on tasks for which stimulus valence is irrelevant for responding. To discriminate between these motor suppression and response-relevance hypotheses, we elicited both lexical decisions and valence judgments of negative words and positive words. Relative to positive words (e. g., kitten), negative words (e. g., spider) elicited slower lexical decisions but faster valence judgments. Results therefore indicate that negative stimuli do not cause a generalized motor suppression. Rather, negative stimuli elicit selective responding, with faster responses on tasks for which stimulus valence is response-relevant...|$|R

We apply this approach to conflicting theoretical and empirical accounts of the relationship between psychological valence (positivity) of a word and recognition of that word by conducting multiple virtual experiments based on two lexical decision databases. Analyses of the means and distributional analyses of RTs within and across virtual experiments point to the monotonic negative relationship between valence and lexical decision RT, predicted under the gradient <b>automatic</b> <b>vigilance</b> account, as the dominant pattern of the interplay between word recognition and emotion...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{functions}} of automatic stimulus evaluation is to direct attention toward events that may have undesirable consequences for the perceiver's well-being. To test whether attentional resources are automatically directed away from an attended task to undesirable stimuli, Ss named the colors in which desirable and undesirable traits (e. g., honest, sadistic) appeared. Across 3 experiments, color-naming latencies were consistently longer for undesirable traits but did not differ within the desirable and undesirable categories. In Experiment 2, Ss also showed more incidental learning for undesirable traits, as predicted by the <b>automatic</b> <b>vigilance</b> (but not a perceptual defense) hypothe-sis.

It is known that the emotional content of verbal material influences cognitive processing during lexical decision, naming, emotional Stroop task and many others (see Citron et al., 2009). Converging findings showed that emotionally valenced words (positive or negative) are processed faster than neutral words, as shown by reaction time and ERP measures, suggesting a prioritisation of emotional stimuli (Scott et al., 2009).

40|$|Few {{studies have}} {{examined}} the effect of intergroup threat on cognitive outcomes such as memory. Different theoretical perspectives can inform how intergroup threat should affect memory for threat-relevant and neutral information, such as the mood-congruency approach, Yerkes-Dodson law, Easterbrook’s theory, and also evolutionary perspectives. To test among these, we conducted two experiments to examine how exposure to intergroup threats affected memory compared to control conditions. In study 1, we manipulated symbolic threat and examined participants’ memory for threat and neutral words. In study 2, memory performance was assessed following the induction of realistic threat. Across the studies, in the control condition participants showed better memory for threat-related than neutral information. However, participants under threat remembered neutral information as well as threat-related information. In addition, participants in the threat condition remembered threat-related information as well as participants in the control condition.

40|$|In this chapter, {{we present}} {{an account of}} empathy in {{psychotherapy}} {{that is based on}} a more general, multidisciplinary understanding of everyday empathic interaction. We want to argue that, for two reasons, this approach can contribute {{to a better understanding of}} processes of empathy in the therapeutic context. Neurological studies and social psychology research have demonstrated the power and complexity of interpersonal influence on a physical, nonverbal level, a complexity that is sometimes ignored by therapists (Shaw, 2004). Examples of such influences are emotional contagion (e. g., Preston & de Waal, 2002) and <b>automatic</b> <b>vigilance</b> (Wentura, Rothermund, & Bak, 2000). Second, understanding problems in client-therapist interaction requires us to examine how clients both understand and misunderstand their therapists, including their therapists’ intentions, emotions, and other internal states (e. g., Rhodes et al., 1994). These problems are grasped with more coherence when they are described using parallel concepts for the client and the therapist. For example, it is easier to understand and tackle severe communication problems in psychosis treatment when both the client’s and the therapist’s “sides” of the communication are considered (Peters, 2005). status: publishe...|$|R
30|$|How emotion affects {{memory is}} a subject of {{interest}} for several areas such as clinical or even the forensic fields. In this way, the effect of emotional valence on word recognition has been described in both theoretical and empirical research. This is an effect that has been reported as a robust one on several aspects of cognition, {{as well as on}} behavior (Van Tol, Demenescu, Van der Wee, Kortekaas, Marjan, et al. 2012). Several studies claimed that emotional words might capture more attention than neutral ones (Bowen, Kark, & Kensinger 2017; Sereno, Scott, Yao, Thaden, & O’Donnell 2015). More precisely, and focusing on the particular effect of negative emotional content on word recognition, {{it has been suggested that}} negative stimuli elicit slower latencies under this condition. According to Moret-Tatay, Moreno-Cid, Argimon, Quarti Irigaray, Szczerbinski, et al. (2014), this is a plausible result suggesting that an <b>automatic</b> <b>vigilance</b> process might operate to engage attention longer. In particular, the literature (León Gordillo, Martínez, Hernández, Cruz, Meilán, et al. 2010; Meng, Zhang, Liu, Ding, Li, et al. 2017) has suggested that the “normal population” might be predisposed to direct their attention to negative stimuli, supporting the idea that the negative emotional charge could have an essential role in our evolution.|$|R
40|$|Critical upward {{communication}} improves {{decision making in}} organisations. Without it, senior management teams become {{out of touch with}} the mood of their people, and underestimate or miss emerging problems in their marketplace. They are more likely to produce strategies that are misaligned with the perceptions of their employees. The possibility of successful strategic implementation is therefore dramatically reduced. This suggests that two way communication and critical feedback is vital to organisational success. The problem is that most of us are suspicious of any feedback to the effect that our behaviour, decisions or most cherished beliefs are in error. We react instinctively against it – what has been called the <b>automatic</b> <b>vigilance</b> effect. Moreover, most of us are also reluctant to transmit critical information, recognising that the hostile reaction of recipients may endanger our standing in their eyes, and possibly damage our careers. We therefore exaggerate how much we agree with the opinions of people who have a higher status than us – the ingratiation effect. This causes managers to form inaccurate impressions of the climate within their organisations, with dangerous strategic consequences. This article explores the problems that these dynamics create for companies. It examines the benefits that can be obtained from institutionalising more critical upward feedback into an organisation’s communication systems.

40|$|Emotion {{words are}} {{generally}} characterized as possessing high arousal and extreme valence and have typically been investigated in paradigms {{in which they}} are presented and measured as single words. This study examined whether a word’s emotional qualities influenced the time spent viewing that word in the context of normal reading. Eye movements were monitored as participants read sentences containing an emotionally positive (e. g., lucky), negative (e. g., angry), or neutral (e. g., plain) word. Target word frequency (high or low) was additionally varied to help determine the temporal locus of emotion effects, with interactive results suggesting an early lexical locus of emotion processing. In general, measures of target fixation time demonstrated significant effects of emotion and frequency as well as an interaction. The interaction arose from differential effects with negative words that were dependent on word frequency. Fixation times on emotion words (positive or negative) were consistently faster than those on neutral words with one exception — high frequency negative words were read no faster than their neutral counterparts. These effects emerged in the earliest eye movement measures, namely, first and single fixation duration, suggesting that emotionality, as defined by arousal and valence, modulates lexical processing. Possible mechanisms involved in processing emotion words are discussed, including <b>automatic</b> <b>vigilance</b> and desensitization, both of which imply a key role for word frequency. Finally, it is important that early lexical effects of emotion processing can be established within the ecologically valid context of fluent reading...|$|R

Approach. To get closer to a real life implementation, spectral markers were extracted from a short window (i. e. towards reactive systems) that did not include any motor activity and the analyzed ERPs were elicited by a task-independent probe that required a reflex-like answer (i. e. close to the ones required by dead man's <b>vigilance</b> <b>devices).</b> The data were acquired from 20 participants who performed a Sternberg memory task for 90 min (i. e. 2 / 6 digits to memorize) inside which a simple detection task was inserted.
