25|$|The {{striped hyena}} is {{primarily}} a scavenger, though it will occasionally attack and kill any defenseless animal it can overcome, and will supplement its diet with fruits. The spotted hyena, though it also scavenges occasionally, is an active pack hunter of medium to large sized ungulates, which it catches by wearing them down in long chases and dismembering them in a canid-like manner. The <b>aardwolf</b> {{is primarily a}}n insectivore, specialised for feeding on termites of the genus Trinervitermes and Hodotermes, which it consumes by licking them up with its long, broad tongue. An <b>aardwolf</b> can eat 300,000 Trinervitermes on a single outing.|$|E
25|$|The <b>aardwolf</b> (Proteles cristata) {{can trace}} its lineage {{directly}} back to Plioviverrops 15 million years ago, {{and is the}} only survivor of the dog-like hyena lineage. Its success is partly attributed to its insectivorous diet, for which it faced no competition from canids crossing from North America. Its unrivaled ability to digest the terpene excretions from soldier termites is likely a modification of the strong digestive system its ancestors used to digest fetid carrion.|$|E
25|$|Hyenas first {{arose in}} Eurasia during the Miocene period from viverrid-like ancestors, and diversified into two {{distinct}} types: lightly built dog-like hyenas and robust bone-crushing hyenas. Although the dog-like hyenas thrived 15 {{million years ago}} (with one taxon having colonised North America), they became extinct after a change in climate along {{with the arrival of}} canids into Eurasia. Of the dog-like hyena lineage, only the insectivorous <b>aardwolf</b> survived, while the bone-crushing hyenas (including the extant spotted, brown and striped hyenas) became the undisputed top scavengers of Eurasia and Africa.|$|E

40|$|Mating {{systems are}} classifications {{of the outcome}} of {{individual}} strategies aimed at maximising reproductive success. These systems have two components; one describes how individuals socially relate and bond to mating partners and the other describes the genetic outcome of actual mating activities. Reproductive activity is under strong endocrine and behavioural regulation where inter-sexual discrepancies in the regulation of reproductive success have resulted in the majority of mammal species exhibiting polygynous mating systems, with only 5 % of mammals being socially monogamous. However, in monogamous species there can be a discrepancy between social pair bonds and sexual mating activities. <b>Aardwolves</b> are extreme diet specialists ii on a temporally fluctuating resource, Trinervertermes spp. A number of studies have described them as socially monogamous {{but at the same time}} observed a high frequency of extra pair copulations (EPCs). A recent study also linked sex variation in den use to polygamous mating. However, it is unclear to what extent these EPC's contribute to individual fitness, and how these contrasting mating strategies influence space use and reproductive physiology. The aim of this project was to determine if there was seasonality in reproductive activity and to test if endocrine physiology, home range size and space use were similar between males and females as predicted for a socially monogamous species. We assessed reproductive endocrinology in zoo-housed <b>aardwolves</b> and quantified if physiological and behavioural data in wild <b>aardwolves</b> relate more to predictions based on social monogamy or polygamy. We found physiological support for previous behavioural observations of reproductive seasonality in both zoo-housed and wild <b>aardwolves.</b> We suggest that the seasonal breeding strategy in <b>aardwolves</b> is as a direct consequence of their strong dietary preference on a temporally fluctuating resource, where it is important for <b>aardwolves</b> to time periods of high physiological investment in reproduction with high seasonal abundance of these termites. Our data on zoo-housed <b>aardwolves</b> also showed that the social environment appeared to modify physiological responses to variation in environmental conditions. We suggest that due to strict seasonal breeding in wild <b>aardwolves</b> females are time constrained in receptivity which, combined with their largely solitary behaviour, implies that males have to be dynamic in the onset of their reproductive activity to closely match that of locally receptive females. Therefore, it may be adaptive for <b>aardwolves</b> to retain social receptivity even if resource distributions cause these animals to forage alone. We also found that physiological and behavioural traits correspond better to predictions based on social monogamy than polygamous mating in a population of wild <b>aardwolves.</b> However, earlier studies in the same population found that behavioural traits were more related to predictions based on polygamous mating. Therefore, our data and other studies show how a difference between traits can relate to either social monogamy or polygamous mating in wild <b>aardwolves</b> in the same study area. We suggest that social mating system components regulate the observed endocrine and behavioural parameters more than actual mating patterns, which implies that social components pose a stronger selective pressure on physiology and behaviour than sexual mating patterns. Overall, we conclude that due to the discrepancy in traits that correspond to predictions based on different mating systems, <b>aardwolves</b> do not fit discreetly into any current mating system classification. We suggest that the evolutionary causes for the potentially conflicting mating strategies as well as the fitness benefits of these strategies need to be further investigated.

25|$|Although Hyenas lack perineal scent glands, {{they have}} a large pouch of naked skin located at the anal opening. Large anal glands above the anus open into this pouch. Several sebaceous glands are present between the {{openings}} of the anal glands and above them. These glands produce a white, creamy secretion that the hyenas paste onto grass stalks. The odour of this secretion is very strong, smelling of boiling cheap soap or burning, and can be detected by humans several metres downwind. The secretions are primarily used for territorial marking, though both the <b>aardwolf</b> and the striped hyena will spray them when attacked.|$|E

50|$|<b>Aardwolves</b> live in open, dry {{plains and}} bushland, {{avoiding}} mountainous areas. Due to their specific food requirements, {{they are only}} found in regions where termites of the family Hodotermitidae occur. Termites of this family depend on dead and withered grass and are most populous in heavily grazed grasslands and savannahs, including farmland. For most of the year, <b>aardwolves</b> spend time in shared territories consisting of up to a dozen dens, which are occupied for six weeks at a time.|$|R
40|$|Four <b>aardwolves</b> (two {{males and}} two females) in South Africa were studied to indentify a {{suitable}} test system for assessing gonadal and adrenocortical endocrine function based on faecal analysis during four months. It {{was possible to}} determine the following classes of hormones in the faeces of aardwolves: androgen, progestagen, estrogen and glucocorticoid metabolites. For androgen and progestagen metabolites {{a significant difference between}} the females and males was measured. For a physiological validation of faecal glucocorticoid metabolites, two <b>aardwolves</b> were darted and injected with exogenous ACTH. The GCM levels in the feaces increased significantly within respectively 3 - 20 hours after the injection. This ACTH challenge showed that the measured feacal glucocorticoid metabolites were relevant indicators of adrenal activity in <b>aardwolves.</b> It can therefore be useful as a non-invasive tool for measuring a physiological stress response non-invasively in this species...|$|R

500|$|Termites are {{consumed}} {{by a wide}} variety of predators. One termite species alone, Hodotermes mossambicus, was found in the stomach contents of 65 birds and 19 mammals.ant, [...] arthropods, reptiles, and amphibians such as bees, centipedes, cockroaches, crickets, dragonflies, frogs, lizards, scorpions, spiders, and toads consume these insects, while 2 spiders in the family Ammoxenidae are specialist termite predators. Other predators include aardvarks, aardwolves, anteaters, bats, bears, bilbies, many birds, echidnas, foxes, galagos, numbats, mice and pangolins. The <b>aardwolf</b> is an insectivorous mammal that primarily feeds on termites; it locates its food by sound and also by detecting the scent secreted by the soldiers; a single <b>aardwolf</b> is capable of consuming thousands of termites in a single night by using its long, sticky tongue. Sloth bears break open mounds to consume the nestmates, while chimpanzees have developed tools to [...] "fish" [...] termites from their nest. Wear pattern analysis of bone tools used by the early hominin Paranthropus robustus suggests that they used these tools to dig into termite mounds.|$|E

2500|$|Their {{dentition}} {{is similar}} to that of the canid, but is more specialised for consuming coarse food and crushing bones. The carnassials, especially the upper, are very powerful and are shifted far back to the point of exertion of peak pressure on the jaws. The other teeth, save for the underdeveloped upper molars, are powerful, with broad bases and cutting edges. The canines are short, but thick and robust. Labiolingually, their mandibles are much stronger at the canine teeth than in canids, reflecting the fact that hyenas crack bones with both their anterior dentition and premolars, unlike canids, which do so with their post-carnassial molars. The strength of their jaws is such that both striped and spotted hyenas have been recorded to kill dogs with a single bite to the neck without breaking the skin. The spotted hyena is renowned for its strong bite proportional to its size, but a number of other animals (including the Tasmanian devil) are proportionately stronger. The <b>aardwolf</b> has greatly reduced cheek teeth, sometimes absent in the adult, but otherwise has the same dentition as the other three species.

Because it was a biped, it could have a more modified forelimb without affecting its ability to run.|$|R
5000|$|The {{breeding}} season {{varies depending on}} location, but normally takes place during autumn or spring. In South Africa, breeding occurs in early July. During the {{breeding season}}, unpaired male <b>aardwolves</b> search their own territory, as well as others, for a female to mate with. Dominant males also mate opportunistically with the females of less dominant neighboring <b>aardwolves,</b> which can result in conflict between rival males. Dominant males even {{go a step further}} and as the breeding season approaches, they make increasingly greater and greater incursions onto weaker males' territories. As the female comes into oestrus, they add pasting to their tricks inside of the other territories, sometimes doing so more in rivals' territories than their own. Females will also, when given the opportunity, mate with the dominant male, which increases the chances of the dominant male guarding [...] "his" [...] cubs with her. Copulation lasts between 1 and 4.5 hours. Gestation lasts between 89 and 92 days, producing two to five cubs (most often two or three) during the rainy season (November-December), when termites are more active. They are born with their eyes open, but initially are helpless, and weigh around 200 - 350 g. The first six to eight weeks are spent in the den with their parents. The male may spend up to six hours a night watching over the cubs while the mother is out looking for food. After three months, they begin supervised foraging, and by four months are normally independent, though they often share a den with their mother until the next breeding season. By the time the next set of cubs is born, the older cubs have moved on. <b>Aardwolves</b> generally achieve sexual maturity at one and a half to two years of age.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>aardwolf</b> (Proteles cristata) is a small, insectivorous mammal, {{native to}} East and Southern Africa. Its name means [...] "earth wolf" [...] in Afrikaans and Dutch.

The <b>aardwolf</b> {{is in the same}} family as the hyena. Unlike many of its relatives in the order Carnivora, the <b>aardwolf</b> does not hunt large animals. It eats insects, mainly termites - one <b>aardwolf</b> can eat about 250,000 termites during a single night, using its long, sticky tongue to capture them. The <b>aardwolf</b> lives in the shrublands of eastern and southern Africa - open lands covered with stunted trees and shrubs. It is nocturnal, resting in burrows during the day and emerging at night to seek food. Its diet consists mainly of termites and insect larvae.|$|E

50|$|Similarly, in Cooper's hawks, female {{desertion}} of offspring {{has been}} found to be closely related to both the likelihood of offspring survival and future reproductive success. Females in weak physical condition are more likely to abandon offspring to complete migration, increasing breeding chances and opportunities for the following year. In mammals, <b>aardwolves</b> have been shown to practice male mate desertion in response to female promiscuity. Lastly, ambisexual mate desertion, in which both sexes desert at nearly equal frequencies, has been observed in snail kites. Mate desertion by either sex depends on food supply, in that snail kites are more likely to desert when snails are abundant and rate of nesting success is high. Thus, mating strategies exhibited by snail kites are somewhat plastic, depending on varying environmental conditions.|$|R
50|$|It forages {{with groups}} of 3-5 {{individual}} wide columns {{moving from the}} foraging holes {{some distance from the}} main mound and radiating out towards grasses.
