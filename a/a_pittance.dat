5|$|Katie is also {{patron of}} Fair Trees, the {{organisation}} {{that is trying}} to stop exploitation of cone pickers in Ambrolauri, Georgia, by the European Christmas tree industry. The local people in this region of Georgia are paid <b>a</b> <b>pittance</b> to risk their lives climbing 30m high fir trees to collect the cones from which the seeds are extracted and sent to Christmas tree nurseries in Europe. Until Fair Trees came along these cone pickers were given no safety equipment or training, no health insurance and very little pay; every year people are injured and even killed doing this work. Fair Trees grow and sell the only fair trade Christmas trees in the world (certified by the WFTO).|$|E

This includes the death of Captain Joe Bradshaw who lost over four hundred thousand pounds in his venture then died of gangrene in 1916, there was Yusumatsu Tokayama who died two months later, most likely of the bends, while working for <b>a</b> <b>pittance</b> as a diver.

25|$|Léonce {{enrolled}} in the new music school, Schola Cantorum, located in the Montparnasse neighborhood of Paris. His talent as an excellent singer and flute player soon became apparent, thus began his very prolific artistic career. During this time, he loved to watch plays at the theatre in his free time and felt more and more drawn to the stage. He participated in small stage productions {{in order to learn}} the trade; he had to accept any offer that came his way to get paid, which often amounted to <b>a</b> <b>pittance.</b> At the same time he continued to take music and theatre classes.|$|E
25|$|By 1859 most of {{the extreme}} {{clippers}} had been dismasted more than once after half {{a decade or more}} of relentless hard driving. All were in a leaky condition, and {{most of the}}ir owners were by then in dire financial straits and could not afford expensive repairs to clippers that could not find a paying cargo to justify such expenses. Their masts were cut down, their yards shortened and their sails reduced as they were refitted and re-rigged with the new Howes rig to make them easier to handle by smaller crews. Other less fortunate clippers were discarded outright and sold for <b>a</b> <b>pittance.</b>|$|E

25|$|Although {{the initial}} plot {{in the first}} few episodes {{develops}} around an agent called Alan Ford, he is later just one of the central group of characters: Group TNT is an assembly of misfit secret agents, who operate from a flower shop in New York City, United States, which they use as a front for their secret headquarters. They are incompetent and lazy, yet intelligent and cunning, especially when it suits their own personal interests. Their outlandish biographies are dwarfed by that of their iron-fisted and shrewd leader, the wheelchair-ridden Number One, a Methusalem character who embezzles the millions paid to the group by American government or city fathers for secret missions, while paying <b>a</b> <b>pittance</b> to his agents.|$|E
25|$|The art {{of playing}} the dhak is now being {{referred}} to as a dying profession,this is sad but true. While some of the dhakis may be lucky to retain old contacts, many are facing a decline and some are moving away from the traditional profession. Take the example of the seventy dhaki families in Amrul, a village in Bankura district. Ancestors of the dhakis were on the rolls of Malla kings of Bishnupur. Daily pujas were organised for the deities in the palace and the dhakis played a significant role. Times have changed. One of them was offered Rs. 800 for playing the dhak for five days. It is <b>a</b> <b>pittance.</b> Some of the younger generation even took to work as shoe shine boys, but the older generation still has pride in being artists. They look down upon such misadventures of the younger generation, but do not have an alternative before themselves.|$|E
25|$|During the Peace Congress of Berlin, Carp was {{especially}} {{alarmed by the}} territorial exchanges: Romania lost the Budjak region to Russia and, in addition to international recognition, received Northern Dobruja (formerly in the Ottoman Danube Vilayet). Domnitor Carol and the Brătianu government reluctantly approved this deal, but a parliamentary faction, comprising Carp and PNL's Dimitrie Sturdza, explicitly condemned it. Their resolution stipulated that annexing Northern Dobruja was against the national interest; the opposition saw Northern Dobruja as a marshy, toxic, territory, and worried that it was largely inhabited by Muslims or disgruntled Bulgarians. Carp personally worried that the region was indefensible in front of Bulgarian irredentism. Eventually, on September 28, 1878, after a lengthy debate in Parliament and a convincing speech by Foreign Minister Kogălniceanu, the vote swung and the territorial exchange was given official endorsement. The government insisted that the incorporation was not <b>a</b> <b>pittance</b> or spoils of war, but the recovery of ancient Wallachian territory.|$|E

25|$|The two-year {{war between}} the ABA and the USBA was perhaps the ugliest rivalry that BMX has ever saw. It seems the USBA was making most of the {{aggressive}} moves. The motivation for rivalries like this was the $2 million to $4 million in revenue yearly that BMX generated at the time. Compared to other older more established sports like baseball, European football (soccer), American football and auto racing, this was <b>a</b> <b>pittance</b> but still enough to generate bad promoters and political infighting between and within sanctioning bodies. Track operators had quite thin profit margins to work with, which perhaps made the back biting even worse since there was so little to go around. There was a slump in the BMX racing market as mentioned {{with the growth of}} Freestyle, the resurgence of skateboarding siphoning off young people and the insurance crises to drain resources further. Pretty desperate times for the organizers of BMX racing, and desperate times generate desperate acts, including actions straight out of Watergate.|$|E
25|$|Sussex {{recorded}} {{a big victory}} at Hove, smacking the Bangladeshi bowlers at will before bowling them out twice for <b>a</b> <b>pittance,</b> which did not exactly give the Bangladeshis confidence {{a week before the}} first Test at Lord's. Michael Yardy was the star of the match, notching up 35 fours and two sixes in a towering 257 - the highest score of the English first class season so far - which led Sussex to 549 for 7 declared. In reply, Habibul Bashar got hit by a bouncer from Jason Lewry when on 22 not out, and thus had to retire, and things only went downhill from there. The Bangladeshis could only manage a total of 323 runs from two innings (127 and 196), with 16-year-old wicketkeeper Mushfiqur Rahim the only one who passed forty runs with a two-hour 63 in the second innings, before being stumped off a delivery by the Man of the Match, Yardy - who recorded his first career five-wicket haul, taking five for 83.|$|E
25|$|Gessner first {{attended}} the Carolinum in Zürich, then later entered the Fraumünster seminary. There he studied classical languages, appearing as Penia (Poverty) in Aristophanes' Pluto, {{at the age}} of 15. In school, he impressed his teachers so much that a few of them helped sponsor him so that he could further his education, including arranging a scholarship for him to attend university in France to study theology (1532–1533) {{at the age of}} 17. There he {{attended the}} Bourges and University of Paris. But religious persecution forced him to leave Paris for Strassburg, but being unable to secure employment, returned to Zürich. One of his teachers in Zürich acted as a foster father to him {{after the death of his}} father at the Battle of Kappel (1531), another provided him with three years of board and lodging, while yet another arranged his further education at the upper school in Strassbourg, the Strassbourg Academy. There he broadened his knowledge of ancient languages by studying Hebrew. In 1535, religious unrest drove him back to Zürich, where he made what some considered an imprudent marriage at the age of 19, of a woman from another poor family who had no dowry. Although some of his friends again came to his aid, he was appointed to obtaining a teaching position for him, this was in the lowest class and attracted a stipend barely more than <b>a</b> <b>pittance.</b> However he then obtained paid leave of absence to study medicine at the University of Basel (1536).|$|E

500|$|During the 12thcentury, {{the main}} benefactors of the priory were the Barons of Halton, but after 1200 their gifts reduced, mainly because they {{transferred}} their interests to the Cistercian [...] abbey at Stanlow, {{which had been}} founded in 1178 by John fitzRichard, the sixth baron. Archaeologist J. Patrick Greene states that {{it is unlikely that}} any of the Barons of Halton were buried in Norton Priory. The only members of the family known to be buried there are Richard, brother of Roger deLacy, the seventh baron, and a female named Alice. The identity of Alice has not been confirmed, but Greene considers that she was the niece of William, Earl Warenne, the 5thEarl of Surrey and therefore a relative of the Delacy family, who were at that time the Barons of Halton. The earl made a grant to the priory of 30shillings a year in order to [...] "maintain <b>a</b> <b>pittance</b> for her soul". As the role played by the Barons of Halton declined, so the importance of members of the Dutton family increased. The Duttons had been benefactors since the priory's foundation, and from the 13th century they became the principal benefactors. There were two main branches of the family, one in Dutton and the other in Sutton Weaver. The Dutton family had their own burial chapel in the priory, and burial in the chapel is specified in three wills made by members of the family. The Aston family of Aston were also important benefactors.|$|E
