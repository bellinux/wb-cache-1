All of Meg's reasonable and sometimes rational suggestions are shot down by Peter and Chris in favor of their more unusual and nonsensical ideas. Peter eventually fires Meg. He and Chris then decide on a joke involving a wood stove and <b>a</b> <b>house</b> <b>of</b> <b>cards,</b> and invite Cleveland, Quagmire and Joe to voice the characters. Although {{it is suggested that}} the crudely animated and developed pilot episode will likely fail, CEO Peter Chernin enjoys it and agrees to air the show, but Peter becomes angered when he suggests that the character Poopyface Tomato Nose's nose be a plum instead of a tomato. Peter's passion about his work impresses Chernin into allowing him to air the episode unedited, but he decides not to let the episode be aired at all, which he later regrets.|$|E

2500|$|Throughout {{the late}} 1990s period, which {{correlates}} {{to the history}} of the Madeline series, The Learning Company would retroactively be accused of being <b>a</b> <b>house</b> <b>of</b> <b>cards</b> [...] "burdened with tired brands", cutting research and development to 11% of expenditures, and focusing on repackaging old products through distribution channels like convenience stores and drugstores, rather than investing resources into new software by the development companies they had acquired. The company had continued to grow through acquisitions, achieving revenues of $800 million, despite having an accumulated deficit of $1.1 billion by the end of 1998. Mattel CEO Jill Barad made a takeover bid in an attempt to overcome a downward slide in her company's stock price, [...] "seiz on educational software as a driver of future growth." [...] Mattel had found success with its series featuring Barbie due to the representation of the characters, and sought to replicate this formula by expanding the product line to include series like Madeline, which also included [...] "well-developed characters." [...] A few weeks after the sale, CFRA produced a critical report on Mattel, which claimed: [...] "TLC was already experiencing collapsing revenue, a surge in receivables and a deterioration of operating cash flow." [...] O'Leary, who had been hired as president of Mattel's new TLC digital division, soon sold his stock for $6 million, a few months before $2 billion in shareholder value was lost in a single day. The Learning Company's acquisition by Mattel in May 1999 resulted in a loss of nearly $300 million (once estimated at a loss of a $1 million a day) and represented the end of the [...] "boom-and-bust period" [...] of the [...] "edutainment" [...] era of the mid-1990s. Toby Levenson, former manager of The Learning Company's Educational Design Department, said [...] "edutainment" [...] had become [...] "a toxic word" [...] following the company's merger with Mattel, while Businessweek would describe the acquisition as one of [...] "the Worst Deals of All Time". Lee Banville, editor of Gamesandlearning.org, wrote that the collapse of the market for children's education games was reflective of: [...] "how difficult it is to grow that business and diversify and evolve". While the Madeline video game series was officially cancelled in 1997, Madeline 1st and 2nd Grade Math would be released two years later in 1999 under Mattel, becoming the last entry in the series before Creative Wonders being closed later that year.|$|E

The four flaws are illustrated by the Emslie studies of Prozac and children, which offer not only a strident example of marketing masquerading as science, but also, given the recent FDA approval of Prozac for children, a brutal reminder of the danger inherent in not knowing how to distinguish science from science fiction. The authors argue that an ethical path requires the challenge of the automatic medical response to medicate children, with an accompanying demand for untainted science and balanced information to inform critical decisions by child caretakers...|$|R

The song compares Brazil to <b>a</b> <b>house</b> <b>of</b> marked <b>cards,</b> <b>a</b> den <b>of</b> thieves, and a State that is not a nation, but the song explodes any pretensions of moral superiority towards the end by remarking on, above all else, the stupidity of the person singing the song.

The music continues to race ahead, but the vocal seems to be trying to pull it back, simultaneously celebrating and undercutting the belief that perfection is achievable, at least in the heart.

40|$|Any viable {{model of}} {{attention}} must navigate between two requirements: {{the need for}} sustainability {{and the need for}} interruptibility (Allport, 1989). Successful completion of our goals often requires extended periods of focused attention. For example, building <b>a</b> <b>house</b> out <b>of</b> playing <b>cards</b> requires sustained attention to the cards, the table, and the position of your hands. Any disruption of focused attention would likely result in failure. However, some distractions are important to notice. If a lion were to appear just as you were putting the last couple <b>of</b> <b>cards</b> in place, {{it would be better to}} notice it than to obliviously finish building the house; attentional engagement should be interrupted or re-allocated in the face of unexpected dangers. This book focuses on how and when attention is diverted away from a primary goal by an irrelevant or unexpected event, a phenomenon known as attention capture. This definition of attention capture accommodates most of the current approaches to studying the diversion of attention, in part because it is sufficiently broad. However, conflicting operational definitions of capture, based on different assumptions about the role of attention, have muddied the theoretical landscape o...|$|R
40|$|Society {{has long}} {{struggled}} with the meaning of privacy in a modern world. This struggle is not new. With the advent of modern technology and information sharing, however, the challenges have become more complex. Socially, Americans seek to both protect their private lives, and also to utilize technology {{to connect with the}} world. Commercially, industries seek to obtain information from individuals, often without their consent, and sell it to the highest bidder. As technology has advanced, the ability of other individuals, institutions, and governments to encroach upon this privacy has strengthened. Nowhere is this tension between individual privacy rights and government security interests felt more acutely than {{within the context of the}} Fourth Amendment. Notwithstanding the long duration of this struggle, jurisprudentially, the nation is at a critical point. Traditionally, the touchstone for analyzing the boundaries of Fourth Amendment searches is reasonableness. Quite literally, therefore, the Supreme Court has the task of determining the unanswerable: What is reasonable? This task, combined with the modern realities of rapidly changing technology, increased use of government surveillance, and changing expectations and conceptions of privacy, as well as differing perspectives of privacy in a heterogeneous society, becomes an even further complicated endeavor. One of the significant realities in play at this critical juncture lies within the Court itself. This Article asserts that there is a new, different form of the digital divide — the divide between the perspective of the Court and twenty-first century realities — which negatively impacts Fourth Amendment jurisprudence. This Article focuses on two specific aspects of that gap, arguing that this gap in experience and perspective contributes to false presumptions by the Court, which then leads to less than optimal opinions. Such an approach creates <b>a</b> veritable <b>house</b> <b>of</b> <b>cards</b> in which the opinions themselves are weakened and erode over time. The potential of the Court to add crucial guidance in the area of privacy law in contemporary society is immense. That being said, any constructive impact is compromised when the validity of the opinions precludes their ability to withstand the test of time. This Article discusses the gap generally, with specific attention paid to the divide between the Court and technological realities, and the gap between the Court and the realities of modern policing and pressures on law enforcement. The author argues that these divides result in opinions purporting to determine what is reasonable in modern life, but which rest upon a set of inaccurate presumptions. By analyzing Riley v. California, in which the Court held that the police may not dispense with the warrant requirement to search arrestees’ cell phones incident to arrest, this paper demonstrates examples of this gap. In particular, the article explores three inaccurate presumptions made in Riley, arguing that they contribute to a failed jurisprudence in this critical area. The article concludes by offering concrete steps to close the digital divide and allow the Court to more effectively influence this critical area of the law and modern life...|$|R
