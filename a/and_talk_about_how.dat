25|$|This {{challenge}} {{was an early}} start for the 4 remaining finalists Bill, Sophie, Fenton and David. It began at the fish markets in Sydney's Chinatown where Ben explained the art of finding a fresh fish. Each finalist asked around to find out {{as much information as}} they could about a fish they had never cooked before. Fenton was so impressed with the filleting of the salmon that he wanted to meet the man responsible. Turned out it was the No. 1 salmon filleter in NSW. At the docks, 4 BBQ's were set up and each contestant was given 60 seconds to look down the barrel of the camera <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> they would prepare this fish, as though they were hosting a show. This was a test to see how much of the information they could retain and deliver to an audience in a simple to understand language. A Teppanyaki Chef came out and gave the finalists a crash course in the ancient Japanese technique. For the final challenge the remaining 4 were taken to a Teppanyaki restaurant and asked to cook a meal for the judges using the technique. Each contestant was judged on the ability to talk and cook at the same time while using techniques that they were all unfamiliar with. The judges then decided they would send one home who they thought was 'throwing' the contest.|$|E

[...] Of her surprise to the unexpected fandom, Faust said, [...] "From the messages I've received, these episodes have lifted spirits, brought parents and kids together, changed perspectives and inspired the most unlikely of people in the most unlikely of places.

500|$|Originally {{written as}} a {{potential}} series finale, the episode has received highly positive reception from television critics who often cited it as the best episode of the season. It has been particularly praised for its humor and for its emotional scenes, such as one where Bart and Lisa sit in their old treehouse <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> difficult parenting is. During the original broadcast, [...] "Holidays of Future Passed" [...] was watched by about 6.43 million people. Since then, it has garnered attention in the media for a segment taking place thirty {{years in the future}} in which it is implied that the city of Dearborn, Michigan is [...] "still under sharia law". Commentators have had mixed opinions on what the segment is mocking, whether it is the increasing Islamic influence in the US, specifically in [...] Dearborn, or rather those who are thinking that Dearborn is under sharia law in December 2011, the time that the episode aired.|$|E
500|$|When Bart and Lisa {{arrive at}} their parents' home, they stay there [...] with their children.

Meanwhile, Bart is heartbroken to find out that Jenda has remarried while he has not found anyone new. Feeling depressed, he tells Homer to take his grandsons out. The boys become angry with their father for not spending time with them, but the two have a great time with their grandfather. Bart and Lisa then encounter each other in their old treehouse, where they become slightly drunk <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> difficult parenting is. After exchanging inspirational advice, they realize that they need to try harder to connect with their children. Meanwhile, upon arriving in Springfield, Maggie starts experiencing contractions and Kearney, now a taxi driver, drives her to the hospital.|$|E
500|$|Kyle, Cartman, Stan, [...] and Kenny enjoy a {{nice day}} outside with the weather being warm until {{a large group of}} Harley riders disturb them. The {{residents}} of South Park are frustrated by a large group of Harley riders frequently making noise in town. The Harley riders eat lunch <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> nobody is paying attention to them, so one of the Harley riders comes up with a noise to get everyone's attention. Before the Harley riders take off, Cartman confronts the bikers, describing them as insecure losers who ride loud motorcycles to draw attention to themselves. Cartman tells them their behavior makes them look like [...] "fags" [...] and, when other children begin referring to the bikers with the same slur, the bikers assume they are being insulted because they are not being loud enough. They believe that they should be louder because after all, children are around loud stuff today (such as the Xbox 360 and Surround sound system). The motorcyclists equip their motorcycles with horns, sirens and various musical instruments. The boys devise a plan to rid the town of the bikers. However, once Butters reveals that he likes Harley motorcycles, he is not allowed to participate in the scheme. As the riders eat at a diner, Cartman defecates on the seats of their motorcycles while Kyle and Stan spray paint [...] "FAGS GET OUT" [...] on several buildings around town. The boys are pleased when the bikers temporarily leave town, but the graffiti alarms Big Gay Al and Mr. Slave because they interpret it as homophobia.|$|E

University officials decided, [...] "there was a better way of doing it. A small group, a small section of the student body, was really not the best thing." [...] Sarah Hanson-Young, an Australian Greens senator, said [...] "As a democratic country, we should be encouraging more open and frank discussion about the current situation in Tibet, not banning the country's spiritual leader from addressing students and staff at universities." [...] A spokesperson for the activist Australia Tibet Council said the university had given in to China. [...] "They have compromised their academic freedom and integrity, and it also sends a disheartening message to the Tibetan people," [...] more than 100 of whom have died in recent self-immolation protests. June Teufel Dreyer, a University of Miami (Florida) professor of political science, claims that Confucius Institutes have distorted history, citing universities in Australia inviting speakers [...] "to shill for the government <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> happy all the Tibetans were". A Joint Conference of Australia's 13 Confucius Institutes was held in Sydney on 4 September 2014, intending to increase the CI network’s [...] "visibility in Australia’s industry and public policy making communities".|$|E
