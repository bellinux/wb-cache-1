5|$|As Roosevelt {{became more}} radical in his progressivism, Taft was {{hardened}} in his resolve to achieve re-nomination, {{as he was}} convinced that the progressives threatened the very foundation of the government. One blow to Taft was the loss of Archibald Butt, one of the last links between the previous and present presidents, as Butt had formerly served Roosevelt. Ambivalent between his loyalties, Butt went to Europe on vacation in early 1912. He sailed for home in April on the Titanic and died in its sinking, a death Taft found hard to accept <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>body</b> was not recovered.|$|E

5|$|Garfield's funeral train left Long Branch on {{the same}} special track that brought him there, {{traveling}} over tracks blanketed with flowers and past houses adorned with flags. His body was transported to the Capitol and then continued on to Cleveland for burial. More than 70,000 citizens, some waiting over three hours, passed by Garfield's coffin <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>body</b> lay in state in Washington; later, on September 25, 1881, in Cleveland, more than 150,000—a number equal to {{the entire population of}} that city—likewise paid their respects. His body was temporarily interred in a vault in Cleveland's Lake View Cemetery until his permanent memorial was built.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of death, Lindow Man was a healthy male in his mid-20s, {{and he may have}} been someone of high status, <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>body</b> shows little {{evidence}} of heavy or rough work. There has been debate over the reason for Lindow Man's death, for the nature of his demise was violent, perhaps ritualistic; after a last meal of charred bread, Lindow Man was strangled, hit on the head, and his throat cut. Dating the body has proven problematic, but it is thought that Lindow Man was deposited into Lindow Moss, face down, some time between 2 BC and 119AD, in either the Iron Age or Romano-British period. The body has been preserved by freeze-drying and is on permanent display at the British Museum, although it occasionally travels to other venues such as the Manchester Museum.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Sing {{engineers}} his and Bones {{escape from}} confinement, and Sum is impressed, offering them {{membership in the}} Gang if they can kill a person. Sing and Bone attempt to kill the Landlady, but their plan backfires, and Sing barely escapes from the Landlady's wrath. Seeking safety in a traffic pulpit, Sing is surprised <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>body</b> rapidly heals from the injuries sustained in the escape, the pain causing him to strike {{the sides of the}} pulpit with extreme force, covering the surface in indentations. Later, he attempts to mug an ice cream vendor, who {{turns out to be the}} mute girl; she offers him a lollipop but he knocks it away, humiliated at himself. After sending Bone away, blaming his failure on Bone, Sing is bought before Sum. Sum wants Sing to use his escape skills to free a legendary fighter, the Beast, from a mental asylum to use against Pig Sty Alley, offering Sing membership in the Gang for doing so. Upon being released, the Beast appears to be a middle-aged, slovenly, and flippant man, but is quickly shown to be a formidable and ruthless fighter.|$|E

5|$|Following Radama II's {{apparent}} death, rumors {{spread that}} he had only been rendered unconscious by the attempt on his life and had revived <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>body</b> was being transported to Ilafy for interment in his designated tomb. French historian Delval presents evidence that supports a scenario wherein the group tasked with carrying Radama's body to Ilafy became frightened as the king began to revive, prompting them to abandon the body and then falsely maintain that they had completed their task to place him in the tomb. Within months after his reported death, rumors began circulating that Radama was alive, residing {{on the west coast}} of the island and was amassing supporters for a political comeback. The rumors persisted to the point of causing political turmoil in Antananarivo. These claims may have had some substance judging by the actions of others. Prominent Christian missionaries outside the capital made extensive efforts to visit and support Radama but seemingly never succeeded. Traditionalist factions within the government were concerned enough by the rumors to have put to death sixteen of his supporters, as well as fining hundreds of others. According to evidence in Delval's study, Radama may indeed have survived and, failing to regain the throne, lived to old age as an ordinary citizen in the north of the island.|$|E

25|$|The {{belief that}} the bread and wine that form {{the matter of the}} Eucharist become the body and blood of Christ appears to have been {{widespread}} from an early date, with early Christian writers and referring to them <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>body</b> and the blood.

25|$|Although {{his date}} of death is uncertain, it has been presumed that Brown was killed some time after he went missing, and the Commonwealth War Graves Commission officially records his {{date of death}} as 28 February 1942. <b>As</b> <b>his</b> <b>body</b> was never found, Brown has no known grave, {{although}} he is commemorated at the Singapore Memorial at Kranji War Cemetery in Singapore.|$|E
25|$|Because both Superboy and Superman {{as a boy}} absorbed less {{solar energy}} than Superman as an adult, Superboy is also less able to process the {{appropriate}} amount of solar energy as fast as Superman could: as a result, overtaxing his powers {{to the point of}} physical depletion would spell his death, <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>body</b> would literally begin to feed on itself, unable to absorb solar energy fast enough to restore itself.|$|E
25|$|A small {{graveyard}} {{near the}} front gate contains three burial plots, those of Lt. Col. Charles R. Williams, Camp Williams' namesake; his son, Private Robert W. Williams, who died in France during World War I; and Brigadier General Hugh M. Simonson, Adjutant General of the Wisconsin National Guard from 1977 until 1979. It also contains a memorial marker for Lt. Jerome Volk, for whom the installation was named, <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>body</b> was never recovered after being shot down over North Korea in 1951.|$|E

25|$|As Sykes mistakenly {{believes}} Harcourt has died, Harcourt {{is taken}} away by an ambulance, but later mutates into a significantly larger and more muscular Newcomer intent on causing violence. The duo pursue Harcourt, catching up with him near a fishing pier. Sykes later ends up in a physical confrontation with Harcourt in the open sea. Harcourt dies, <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>body</b> disintegrates due {{to the effects of}} direct contact with salt water, which is hazardous to Newcomer physiology. Francisco commandeers a police helicopter, and rescues Sykes from the water. With the Tuggle and Newcomer murder cases solved, the authorities dismantle Harcourt's illicit scheme. Later, Sykes and Francisco---now friends---attend Sykes's daughter's wedding together.|$|E
25|$|Tears in the Rain is a 2017 {{short film}} {{set in the}} fictional {{universe}} established by Blade Runner (1982), set before {{the events of the}} film. Written and directed by Christopher Grant Harvey on a budget of $1,500, Tears in the Rain follows John Kampff (Sean Cameron Michael), the future inventor of the Voight-Kampff machine, as he heads up the Tyrell Retirement Division. Following the recent rebellion of Nexus-3 replicants off-world, Kampff confronts Nexus-3 Andy Smith (Russel Savadier) a replicant janitor unaware of his true nature, <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>body</b> is about to shut down. Eleven minutes and eleven seconds in length, the film has won multiple awards.|$|E

25|$|The second {{explosion}} killed twelve soldiers: ten {{from the}} Parachute Regiment {{and the two}} from the Queen's Own Highlanders. Mike Jackson, then a major in the Parachute Regiment, was at the scene soon after the second explosion and later described seeing body parts scattered over the road, {{in the water and}} hanging from the trees. He was asked to identify the face of his friend, Major Peter Fursman, still recognisable after it had been completely ripped from his head by the explosion and recovered from the water by divers from the Royal Engineers. Only one of Colonel Blair's epaulettes remained to identify him <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>body</b> had been vaporised in the blast.|$|E
25|$|The {{synoptic}} gospels, first Mark, {{and then}} Matthew and Luke, depict Jesus as {{presiding over the}} Last Supper. References to Jesus' body and blood foreshadow his crucifixion, and he identifies them as a new covenant. In the gospel of John, {{the account of the}} Last Supper has no mention of Jesus taking bread and wine and speaking of them <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>body</b> and blood; instead it recounts his humble act of washing the disciples' feet, the prophecy of the betrayal, which set in motion the events that would lead to the cross, and his long discourse in response to some questions posed by his followers, in which he went on to speak {{of the importance of the}} unity of the disciples with him and each other.|$|E
25|$|Near that temple is a {{very large}} tree with {{widespread}} branches which are always green both in winter and summer. What kind of tree it is nobody knows. There is also a spring there where the pagan are accustomed to perform sacrifices and to immerse a human being alive. As long <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>body</b> is not found, the request of the people will be fulfilled. A golden chain encircles that temple and hangs over the gables of the building. Those who approach see its gleam from afar off because the shrine, which is located on a plain, is encircled by mountains so situated as to give the effect of a theatre. For nine days feasts and sacrifices of this kind are celebrated. Every day they sacrifice one human being in addition to other animals, so that in nine days there are 72 victims which are sacrificed. This sacrifice takes place about the time of the vernal equinox.|$|E
