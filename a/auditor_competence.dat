They stated {{the importance of education}} and professional accountants believe that audit crisis {{in the last several years}} has been rooted in deregulation of the government which caused audit firms to advertise their services and find new customers on their own, thereby making the audit firms to follow a commercial approach. Numerous researchers have emphasized that deregulation of the government on advertising and demands has led auditors to act more competitively, and this can be attributed to lack of related professional skills, which is related to the auditors’ recent wave of failure in the world (Healy and Palepu 2003; Palepu and Healy 2003). In other words, the auditor is expected to report questionable accounting procedures and significant errors and violations. In fact, this issue reminds professional competency and auditor’s independence. The likelihood of discovery of the breach of contract by the auditor depends on the <b>auditor’s</b> <b>competence</b> and the possibility of reporting violations discovered, and his independence.

30|$|DeAngelo (1981) defined audit {{quality as}} “the market-assessed joint {{probability}} that a given auditor will both (a) discover a breach in a client’s accounting system and (b) report the breach.” Based on this definition, audit quality {{can be broken down}} into two components: (1) the likelihood that an auditor discovers existing misstatements and (2) the likelihood that an auditor appropriately reacts to the discovery. The first component links to an <b>auditor’s</b> <b>competence</b> and degree of effort, while the latter relates to an auditor’s objectivity, professional skepticism and independence. In addition, the effect of audit quality should be determined according to the maturity of the execution conditions of all key factors that influence the mission performance of audit authorities. Knechel et al. (2013) stated that audit quality is conceived differently in different aspects. For the economic supervision, high audit quality means no major mistakes in the financial report. On the other hand, supervising management authority emphasizes high audit quality ought to meet professional standards. For auditors, high audit quality implies that the audit is accomplished according to the methodology or guideline defined by the audit authority. Whereas for audit authorities, high audit quality means that the audit report can withstand the challenge of court. As noted by social scientists, factors that can improve audit quality include (1) intensive training (Knechel et al. 2013), (2) audit specialization and execution of error detection, procedure analysis, audit risk evaluation, and internal control deficiency discovery (Stephens 2011), (3) the knowledge and skills to make professional decisions (Knechel 2010; Bobek et al. 2012), and (4) the professionalism of the auditors (Nagy 2012).

Li et al. (2017 a) also confirm the role of competence on audit quality, where they find that low audit quality {{at the individual level}} has contagion effects. Moreover, several studies examine how auditors respond to complex situations to ascertain the competence of auditors. Bo and Wu (2011) find that auditors ask higher audit fees and issue modified audit opinions in response to audit risks. As well, product market competition is related to audit fees and auditors will make more downward audit adjustments before stock-financed acquisitions, suggesting that auditors’ decisions result from the evaluation of audit risks.

40|$|Background: As soon-to-be {{auditors}} {{many questions}} appear {{with regard to}} the profession and what is required of us who plan to practice it. At the same time as it is apparent that among students, being an auditor is coming into vogue, the negative focus on auditors is greater than perhaps ever before and this places us before a substantial challenge. How does one live up to existing expectations and what is needed to achieve professionalism in view of harsher business environments? An auditor today needs the ability to develop successful relations with clients as well as the ability to stay updated with respect to the most recent rules and regulations, this in order to appear knowledgeable and trustworthy. Hence, the modern auditor is not only an assiduous monitor of business documents and a number-cruncher, but also an adviser who works in close contact with people. As a result of this development {{it is reasonable to assume}} that now there exist other demands on the <b>auditor’s</b> <b>competence</b> and personal qualities. Research Issue: Considering these new demands, there exists a definite incentive to study what the situation looks like today, focusing on what characteristics auditors possess, what characteristics they should possess, and what attributes related to the profile are more desirable. This leads us to our two research questions: “What characteristics should an auditor possess?” and “What auditor profile is desirable?” Methodology: The research is based on primary data collected through two surveys carried out among 55 CPAs and 42 audit clients in Sweden. Results and Conclusions: Our results show that although some characteristics are considered important by both auditors and clients (such as analytical skills and problem solving skills), the auditors have emphasized the importance of soft competencies (such as communicational skills) while clients have focused more on hard competencies (such as the ability to update professional skills). Both auditors and clients were largely indifferent to the auditor profile. We discovered that neither age nor appearance were considered to have a significant influence on trust building or perceived professionalism. Gender was in this context considered least significant, whilst title was considered most significant...|$|R
40|$|The Swedish code of {{corporate}} governance (the Code) was introduced 1 July 2005 aiming {{to raise the}} quality {{of corporate}} governance. This thesis investigates how the Code has affected internal audit. The {{purpose of this study}} is dual and aims to 1). Describe the internal audit, in companies on the A-list and O-list, and how it has and is believed to be affected by the Code. 2). Explain why the internal audit function varies between companies. The first purpose has been carried out by using an inductive approach. The data has been gathered through qualitative interviews with companies, on the A and O-list, audit firms and the Institute of Internal Auditors. In order to fulfil the second purpose a deductive approach has been used. Quantitative data has been gathered from annual reports as well as homepages. The material has together with agency theory been used in order to analyse why the internal audit differs between firms. The result of the qualitative interviews shows that the perceptions of internal audit differ. This can to a certain extent be explained by that there today are no accepted standards for internal audit. Neither does the Code explain what an internal audit function should involve. Overall, all respondents agree that the Code is nothing new nor revolu-tionary since the majority of the companies regard the regulations to be a matter of course. However, the demand of documentation and information has increased. The respondents also states that the acceptance and importance of internal audit has been raised further. All respondents believe that the role of internal audit will develop further. It is expected to become more consultative wherefore the internal <b>auditor’s</b> <b>competence</b> must be improved. Furthermore, the opinion is that COSO will be the framework that companies will apply. The differences in internal audit practice have in this thesis also been analysed and explained by applying the agency model. The analysis has resulted in two proposals: Proposal 1 : The ownership structure affects the agency relationship which in turn leads to differences in the internal audit. Proposal 2 : Companies operating in complex business environments are more likely to have an internal audit function than entities in less complex businesses. Therefore, the existence of internal audit varies across business sectors...|$|R

A questionnaire was mailed to audit clients, i. e. of manufacturing go public companies in the province of Banten; 57 useable questionnaires were returned. Data were processed using the SEM software Partial Least Square (PLS). The data suggest that auditors face difficulties in handling divided loyalties, as audit clients perceive a strong relationship between client satisfaction and usefulness to external stakeholders. The higher <b>auditors</b> <b>competence</b> is perceived to be by the clients, the more satisfied they are with the audit and the more useful they believe the audit is to external stakeholders. The more skeptical the auditor is perceived to be by the clients, the less satisfied they are with the audit and the moreuseful they believe the audit is to external stakeholders. The findings extend previous results, the better the relationship with the auditor is perceived to be by the clients, the more satisfied they are with the audit and the less useful they believe the audit is to external stakeholders. The study addresses an issue most auditing research has not explicitly considered: the distinction between client satisfaction with the audit and client perceptions of the usefulness of the audit to external stakeholders.

40|$|Audit {{markets are}} highly {{concentrated}} {{and such a}} situation might have negative consequences on competition, and thus, on price setting, on audit quality and on the functioning of markets. The European regulator recognized some causes for audit market concentration, identified a systemic risk and suggested joint audits and a mandatory rotation of audit firms to reduce concentration. Prominent concentration measures are concentration ratios, the Lorenz curve, the Gini-coefficient and the Herfindahl-Hirschman-Index. An empirical study on the concentration of German Prime Standard market for the period 2010 – 2013 revealed a high concentration which is quite stable over time and a narrow oligopoly with duopolistic tendencies. Nevertheless, competition could still work, e. g. due {{to the threat of}} market entrants. Moreover, given the fact that Big 4 audit firms provide a higher audit quality, concentration may have positive effects. The mandatory audit firm rotation has a positive effect on auditor independence and a negative effect on <b>auditor</b> <b>competence.</b> This explains why related research output is inconclusive, i. e. the total effect on audit quality remains unclear. Moreover, a positive impact on competition is not ensured. Archival studies reveal that joint audits do not improve audit quality but increase audit costs. On the other hand, joint audits potentially reduce concentration. A combination between audit firm rotation and joint audits might be an optimal solution. Universidad de Málaga.

50|$|The {{purpose of}} an audit is {{to enhance the}} {{credibility}} of financial statements by providing written reasonable assurance from an independent source that they present a {{true and fair view}} in accordance with an accounting standard. This objective will not be met if users of the audit report believe that the auditor may have been influenced by other parties, more specifically company managers/directors or by conflicting interests (e.g. if the auditor owns shares in the company to be audited).

40|$|With {{more than}} thirty years’ {{experience}} in performance audit, the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) is recognised, worldwide, as a leading exponent of this relatively new state audit practice. Using archival and empirical sources, this thesis examines {{the credibility of the}} ANAO’s performance audit function at both a macro, institutional level and at the level of micro practice. Credibility, as defined in this thesis, is a relative construct that consists of three elements: <b>auditor</b> independence, technical <b>competence</b> and audit usefulness. The thesis demonstrates that while ANAO performance audit possesses a high degree of credibility at the macro, institutional level, its micro-level credibility remains problematic. At this level there are numerous challenges to its credibility, including the mobility of employment opportunity between the ANAO and its auditee agencies, the ability of auditee staff to delay, manipulate and otherwise frustrate the evidence-gathering process, and varying perceptions of its usefulness. Also challenging for performance audit credibility is the lack of a clearly-defined knowledge base and professional identity for performance audit. This creates problems for staff recruitment, training and development, and undermines the capacity of the ANAO’s performance auditors to withstand external pressure. The major conclusion of this thesis is that, if ANAO performance audit is indeed a form of auditing and not a misnomer as Barzelay(1997) suggests, then there are aspects of its credibility, as assessed against the criteria of <b>auditor</b> independence, technical <b>competence</b> and audit usefulness, that require attention...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of analytical procedures {{has become an}} integral part of the audit process and indications are that the {{application of}} these procedures will increase in audits of the future. The factors that are causing a shift in audit methodologies towards increasing the application of analytical procedures are the adaptation of a business risk audit methodology, technological advancements and the incorporation of non-financial information in an audit. These factors enable the auditor to incorporate both financial and non-financial information into decision making and thus develop more precise expectations. Numerous studies have been conducted in various countries on the auditor s application of analytical procedures in the audit process. However, little is known about exactly how auditors in South Africa apply analytical procedures as part of the audit process. Owing to an ever-changing audit environment, a closer look into the application of analytical procedures by South African auditors was deemed both timely and appropriate. The overall objective of this study was to investigate the application of analytical procedures by auditors in the audit process. To achieve the objective of this study, a qualitative research approach was applied whereby semi-structured interviews were held with senior audit managers from large audit firms in South Africa. This provided the researcher with rich and detailed descriptions of the application of analytical procedures by auditors in the audit process. The findings of this study, which resulted from data analysis, indicated that there is a need to apply analytical procedures because this adds value to the audit and can enhance its efficiency and effectiveness. However, numerous challenges have been associated with the application of analytical procedures. The findings also indicated that the application of analytical procedures depends on the availability and integrity of clients data and that it is difficult to obtain reliable data for the development of an expectation. It also emerged from the findings that auditors are unsure of the results obtained from analytical procedures owing to a lack of guidance in the auditing standards on the extent of assurance that can be placed on analytical procedures and on how to apply professional judgement in drawing conclusions. <b>Auditors</b> <b>competence</b> to perform analytical procedures limits them in applying these procedures. There seems to be a gap between university studies and audit practice relating to the application of analytical procedures (also data analysis) and the use of information technology. The advantages, however, outweigh the challenges and it is therefore foreseen that the application of analytical procedures will increase in the future.
