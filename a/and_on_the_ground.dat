5|$|The Cape sparrow mostly eats seeds, {{foraging}} {{in trees}} <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> The larger seeds of cereals, wild grasses, {{and other small}} plants are preferred, with wheat and khakiweed (Alternanthera caracasana) being favourites. Buds and soft fruits are also taken, causing considerable damage to agriculture. Insects are eaten, and nestlings seem to be fed exclusively on caterpillars. The Cape sparrow eats the soft shoots of plants, and probes in aloes for nectar, {{but these are not}} important sources of food.|$|E
5|$|The ZNDH's long {{obsolete}} Morane-Saulnier M.S.406 and Fiat G.50 fighter aircraft also {{attempted to}} intercept the USAAF bomber formations, often stressing their old engines beyond the limit. They were {{no match for}} the escorting Mustang and Thunderbolt USAAF fighters and suffered heavy losses, both in the air <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b>|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of the saxaul sparrow's behaviour. Often hidden in foliage, it forages in trees <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> It feeds mostly on seeds, as well as insects while {{breeding}} and as a nestling. When not breeding it forms wandering flocks, but it is less social than other sparrows while breeding, often nesting in isolated pairs. Nests are round bundles of dry plant material lined with soft materials such as feathers. They are built in holes in tree cavities, earth banks, rocky slopes, and within man-made structures or the nests of birds of prey. Two clutches {{of five or six}} eggs are typically laid in a season. Both parents construct the nest and care for their eggs and young.|$|E

5|$|The German attack caught {{large numbers}} of Soviet Air Force {{aircraft}} on the ground. Faulty tactics – sending unescorted bombers against the Germans at regular intervals in tactically unsound formations – accounted for many more. Kesselring reported {{that in the first}} week of operations Luftflotte 2 had accounted for 2,500 Soviet aircraft in the air <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> Even Göring found these figures hard to believe and ordered them to be re-checked. As the ground troops advanced, the figures could be directly confirmed and were found to be too low. Within days, Kesselring was able to fly solo over the front in his Focke-Wulf Fw 189.|$|E
5|$|The {{growth in}} Commercial Air Transport (CAT) has eroded the {{operational}} freedom of GA, {{both in the}} air <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> at larger airports. Difficulty with access to larger airports is compounded by {{a decline in the}} number of aerodromes generally, and existing sites are often threatened with closure and re-development for more profitable uses. The UK planning system is designed to focus on local issues, and consideration of the national impact of GA operations is not within its remit. This makes aerodrome development difficult, often subjecting those that successfully negotiate the process to restrictions in use.|$|E
5|$|The {{onion fly}} (Delia antiqua) lays eggs on {{the leaves and}} stems <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> close to onion, shallot, leek, and garlic plants. The fly is {{attracted}} to the crop {{by the smell of}} damaged tissue and is liable to occur after thinning. Plants grown from sets are less prone to attack. The larvae tunnel into the bulbs and the foliage wilts and turns yellow. The bulbs are disfigured and rot, especially in wet weather. Control measures may include crop rotation, the use of seed dressings, early sowing or planting, and the removal of infested plants.|$|E

5|$|After {{testing the}} engine for several years, {{both in the}} air <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> CFMI searched for {{customers}} outside of a possible AMST contract. The main targets were re-engine contracts for the Douglas DC-8 and the Boeing 707 airliners, including the related military tanker, the KC-135 Stratotanker. There was little initial interest in the engine, but Boeing realized that the CFM56 might be a solution to upcoming noise regulations. After announcing that a 707 would be configured with the CFM56 engine for flight tests in 1977, Boeing officially offered the 707-320 with the CFM56 engine as an option in 1978. The new variant was listed as the 707-700. Due to limited interest from the airlines in a re-engined 707, Boeing ended the 707-700 program in 1980 without selling any aircraft. Despite the lack of sales, having the commercial 707 available with the CFM56 helped the engine's competitiveness for the KC-135 re-engine contract.|$|E
5|$|No.33 Squadron, {{operating}} ex-Qantas Short Empire flying {{boats and}} several smaller transports, {{was raised in}} NEA on 19February 1942. Earlier that month, Lukis warned higher command of the poor state of preparedness and low morale of Australian Army troops at Port Moresby, {{due to lack of}} air cover and apparent lack of interest from government echelons. On 25February, Nos.3 and 4Fighter Sector Headquarters were established to coordinate fighter operations; they were based at Townsville and Port Moresby respectively. Seventeen P-40 Kittyhawks of No.75 Squadron, recently formed at Townsville, were deployed to Port Moresby in mid-March. Commanded by Squadron Leader John Jackson, the squadron suffered heavy losses in the ensuing battle. At one point NEA headquarters gave Jackson permission to withdraw but he refused, and the squadron was eventually credited with destroying thirty-five Japanese aircraft in the air <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> securing Port Moresby until relieved by the 35th and 36th Squadrons of the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF), operating P-39 Airacobras.|$|E
5|$|Péron {{stated that}} the nest was usually {{situated}} near water <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> {{under the shade of}} a bush. It was constructed of sticks and lined with dead leaves and moss; it was oval in shape and not very deep. He claimed that seven to nine eggs were laid always on 25 and 26 July, but the selective advantage of this breeding synchronisation is unknown. The female incubated the eggs, but the male apparently developed a brood patch, which indicates it contributed as well. The non-incubating parent also stayed by the nest, and the chicks left the nest two to three days after hatching. The eggs were preyed upon by snakes, rats, and quolls. Péron gave the incubation period as five or six weeks, but since the mainland emu incubates for 50 to 56 days, this may be too short. He stated a mother emu would defend its young from crows with its beak, but this is now known to be strictly male behaviour.|$|E

5|$|Suffering {{withdrawal}} syndrome from {{the lack of}} cable, Peter straps a television-sized cardboard cutout to himself, making it appear as though his whole world is actually a television programme. When Meg can no longer deal with the public scorn, she reveals that her father is really responsible for Quahog's loss of television, causing the town to turn against him. In an attempt to save Peter from further scorn and verbal attacks, Lois gives a heartfelt speech to the community about how television has kept them all from enjoying one another. Inspired by the speech, Peter drags the family to one outdoor activity after another, which quickly exhausts them. Once the family can no longer keep up with him, Peter decides to go off with William Shatner, who has appeared on the Griffin family doorstep after experiencing a flat tire, to a nearby festival. Meanwhile, Stewie's weather machine creates a huge rainstorm. The storm's lightning strike destroys Stewie's weather machine and blows Stewie off the roof <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> While Meg is practicing driving with Lois, the storm causes her to accidentally hit Shatner and Peter, killing Shatner and hospitalizing Peter. As her father recovers, in a full-body cast, he is forced to watch television, causing him to become addicted once again, much to his family's relief.|$|E
