25|$|<b>A</b> {{secondary}} <b>buyout</b> is <b>a</b> form of {{leveraged buyout}} where both the buyer and the seller are private equity firms or financial sponsors (i.e., <b>a</b> leveraged <b>buyout</b> of <b>a</b> {{company that was}} acquired through <b>a</b> leveraged <b>buyout).</b> <b>A</b> secondary <b>buyout</b> will often provide a clean break for the selling private equity firms and its limited partner investors. Historically, given that secondary buyouts were perceived as distressed sales by both seller and buyer, limited partner investors considered them unattractive and largely avoided them.|$|R

The Pacers tried to trade Dahntay Jones and Solomon Jones to keep Rolle, but the trade fell through and the Pacers were reluctant to drop Solomon Jones {{due to a lack of}} depth in the frontcourt.

Instead, Smith and his agent negotiated a compromise with Cardinals management, agreeing to <b>a</b> <b>buyout</b> of special provisions in his contract in conjunction with Smith announcing his retirement. The agreement prompted a press conference at Busch Stadium on June 19, 1996, during which Smith announced he would retire from baseball at season's end.|$|E
5|$|By June 1999 and in {{the midst}} of their investigation, the {{university}} had negotiated <b>a</b> <b>buyout</b> of the remainder of Haskins' contract, worth $1.5 million over three years. It also withdrew from postseason consideration in the 1999–2000 season and docked itself 11 scholarships over four years. In the summer of 2000, Haskins came forward and admitted that he had paid Gangelhoff $3,000 for her services; this revelation came to light after Haskins turned his financial records over to the NCAA.

5|$|On February 12, 2007, Bennett {{proposed}} using {{tax money}} to pay for a new $500 million arena in Renton, Washington, a suburb of Seattle. After failing to reach a deal {{by the end of the}} legislative session, Bennett gave up his attempt in April 2007. On November 2, 2007 the team announced it would move to Oklahoma City as soon as it could get out of its Key Arena lease. Seattle's mayor, Greg Nickels, maintained a stance that the Sonics were expected to stay in Seattle until their lease expired in 2010 and said the city did not intend to make it easy for Bennett to move the team early. Over concerns the city would accept <b>a</b> <b>buyout</b> of the lease, a grassroots group filed a citywide initiative that sought to prevent the city from accepting such an offer from Bennett's group. The Seattle City Council later unanimously passed an ordinance modeled after the initiative.|$|E
5|$|Jim and Pam become engaged, and she {{ultimately}} {{returns from}} New York to Scranton, where Jim has bought his parents' {{house for the}} two of them. Having avoided jail and only been sentenced to community service, Ryan dyes his hair and starts working for a bowling alley. Michael initiates a romance with Holly until she is transferred to the Nashua, New Hampshire branch and the relationship ends. When Andy is made aware of Dwight and Angela's continued affair, both men leave her. Newly hired Vice President Charles Miner implements a rigid managerial style over the branch that causes Michael to resign in protest. Michael opens the Michael Scott Paper Company, enticing Pam and Ryan to join as salespeople, and though his business model is ultimately unsustainable, Dunder Mifflin's profits are immediately threatened. In <b>a</b> <b>buyout</b> of the Michael Scott Paper Company, the three are rehired with Pam promoted to sales and Ryan returning as a temp. During the chaos, new receptionist Erin is hired to fill the vacancy originally left by Pam. The season's finale ends with a cliffhanger ending hinting that Pam might be pregnant.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 2015–16 season, the Rockets {{acquired}} Ty Lawson {{from the}} Denver Nuggets {{in exchange for}} Joey Dorsey, Nick Johnson, Kostas Papanikolaou, Pablo Prigioni, and a 2016 first round draft pick. Expectations were high for the Rockets coming into the season. Lawson {{was supposed to take}} some of the ball-handling pressures off of Harden, and they were bringing back nearly the same team that made it to the Western Conference Finals the previous year. However, things did not go according to plan. Kevin McHale was fired at the beginning of the season after the Rockets only won 4 of their first 11 games. J. B. Bickerstaff, his assistant, took over the head coaching duties. The Rockets struggled to remain in the playoff contention throughout the season due to inconsistent play and injuries. Lawson was waived mid-season in <b>a</b> <b>buyout</b> agreement. Houston only clinched the eight seed in the 2016 playoffs by beating the Kings in the last game of the regular season. In the first round of the playoffs, the Rockets played the Warriors, who were coming off a record-breaking regular season. The Rockets once again lost to the Warriors in 5 games.|$|E
