5000|$|Ballast {{takes many}} forms. The {{simplest}} form of ballast used in small day sailers is so-called [...] "live ballast", or {{the weight of}} the crew. By sitting on the windward side of the hull, the <b>heeling</b> <b>moment</b> must lift {{the weight of the}} crew. On more advanced racing boats, a wire harness called a trapeze is used to allow the crew to hang completely {{over the side of the}} hull without falling out; this provides much larger amounts of righting moment due to the larger leverage of the crew's weight, but can be dangerous if the wind suddenly dies, as the sudden loss of <b>heeling</b> <b>moment</b> can dump the crew in the water. On larger modern vessels, the keel is made of or filled with a high density material, such as concrete, iron, or lead. By placing the weight as low as possible (often in a large bulb at the bottom of the keel) the maximum righting moment can be extracted from the given mass. Traditional forms of ballast carried inside the hull were stones or sand.|$|R

40|$|Liquid {{sloshing}} {{phenomenon is}} a result of partly filled tank motions. As a tank moves, it supplies energy to induce and sustain a fluid motion. Both the liquid motion and its effects are called sloshing. The interaction between ship’s tank structure and water sloshing inside the tank consists in the constant transmission of energy. As the ship rolls, the walls of a partly filled tank induce the movement of water. Liquid sloshing phenomenon occurring in partly filled ships tanks directly affects the stability of the vessel. However, only static calculations are carried out onboard ships nowadays and static transfer of liquid weight is taken into account in the course of routine stability calculation and assessment. Since previous researches reveal the necessity of dynamic approach towards liquid movement onboard ships, the investigation is focused on problems related to time dependent wave-type phenomena. This aspect is omitted in the course of standard ship stability calculations. The set of numerical simulations of liquid sloshing taking place in moving tanks is carried out. Among many obtained characteristics, the <b>heeling</b> <b>moment</b> due to sloshing is emphasized and thoroughly investigated. The realistic range of possible metacentric heights and rolling periods is examined. The influence of ship’s rolling period on the <b>heeling</b> <b>moment</b> due to liquid sloshing is analyzed for one exemplary seagoing vessel as a case study.

50|$|The sail-plan is also {{spread out}} between {{multiple}} masts, {{allowing for a}} comparative powerful sail area, with a low centre of effort which reduces the <b>heeling</b> <b>moment.</b> However, a thoughtful analysis of these multiple masts indicates that only two or so were actually the main 'driving' sails.

40|$|It {{has become}} obvious that modern ships suffer from {{problems}} related to their seakeeping-behavior, which is mainly related to large amplitude roll motion in head and following seas. As these effects {{are not covered by}} the existing intact stability criteria, an additional concept was developed. This new concept allows us to quantify the risk of the occurrence of large roll angles by calculating a capsiz-ing index. The question left open so far was, how much stability would be required for a certain ship to meet a distinct safety level against capsizing. This paper presents an approach addressing this ques-tion based on the analysis of some real capsizing acci-dents analyzed by applying various criteria proposed in the past, in comparison to the new intact stability index. For this purpose our simulation code, ROLLS, was applied, taking into account relevant effects such as cargo shift, additional <b>heeling</b> <b>moments</b> and water in-gress.

50|$|There {{are several}} {{important}} factors {{that must be}} determined with regards to righting arm/moment. These are known as the maximum righting arm/moment, the point of deck immersion, the downflooding angle, and the point of vanishing stability. The maximum righting moment is the maximum moment that {{could be applied to}} the vessel without causing it to capsize. The point of deck immersion is the angle at which the main deck will first encounter the sea. Similarly, the downflooding angle is the angle at which water will be able to flood deeper into the vessel. Finally, the point of vanishing stability is a point of unstable equilibrium. Any heel lesser than this angle will allow the vessel to right itself, while any heel greater than this angle will cause a negative righting <b>moment</b> (or <b>heeling</b> <b>moment)</b> and force the vessel to continue to roll over. When a vessel reaches a heel equal to its point of vanishing stability, any external force will cause the vessel to capsize.|$|R
40|$|The motivational {{basis and}} {{underlying}} {{goal of this}} master s thesis is to provide more knowledge to the experience data bank for ship designers with respect to probabilistic damage stability (PDS). More precisely, the thesis aims to give more insight to how certain changes in the arrangement and intact stability affect the PDS or A-index for a specific offshore vessel. The author has co-operated with Salt Ship Design {{in order to achieve}} the abovementioned goal; a NAPA-license and GA drawings to a wind farm service vessel (WFSV) were provided. In agreement with Salt Ship Design, the following two objectives have been investigated: 1. 	What is the effect on the A-index of changing the size of the wing ballast tanks located above the void U-tanks at the mid-section of the WFSV, by changing the height of the horizontal surface (U-deck) separating these two tanks? 2. 	What is the effect on the A-index of changing the intact stability of the ship, i. e. the ship s initial GM values for the three subdivision draughts dS, dP and dL? The background for the abovementioned goal and research questions, is the introduction of the PDS regulations by IMO in 2009. Ship designers were then forced to use the probabilistic approach instead of the deterministic approach (DDS), for certain vessel types when calculating damage stability. PDS offers more freedom than DDS {{in the design of the}} ship s internal watertight arrangement. However, since PDS calculations usually are conducted at late design stages due to the widely used top-down design approach, it may be challenging to utilise this flexibility due to time pressure. Thus, ship designers often rely on experience, since there is little time for research and optimisation. The author would therefore like to contribute with more knowledge to the ship designers experience data bank. It can be concluded that the A-index in objective 1 generally decreases when U-deck is lowered beneath the maximum value on the curve, which corresponds to 5. 6 m. From the analysis and discussion conducted in this study, it can furthermore be concluded that the factors contributing to the change are si and vi. The pi-factor does not contribute, since there are no changes in the arrangement in longitudinal or transverse direction. Both the si- and vi-factor generally decreases when the U-deck height is decreased below 5. 6 m. For the si-factor, this is most likely due to increasing <b>heeling</b> <b>moments,</b> in case of damage, for larger sized wing ballast tanks; the si-factor is reduced due to larger heel angles. In addition, larger wing ballast tanks leads to smaller U-tanks, thus the stabilising effect of the U-tanks is reduced as well. The results for objective 2 show that the A-index is generally better for larger initial GM values. The analysis and discussion related to objective 2, additionally conclude that the A-index is mainly dependent on the <b>heeling</b> <b>moment</b> in case of damage. The <b>heeling</b> <b>moment</b> will give the ship a new floating position, i. e. the ship obtains an equilibrium heel angle larger than zero degrees. This heel angle reduces the si-factor, which in turn reduces the A-index. The pi- and vi-factor will not contribute to the changes in A-index for objective 2, because there are no changes in the arrangement. The abovementioned results and conclusions are the key findings in this thesis. Whether the results are generic or not, is questionable; for offshore vessels with approximately the same arrangement as the WFSV, the results from this thesis could be useful...|$|R

50|$|Wind shear affects sailing {{craft in}} motion by {{presenting}} a different wind speed and direction at different heights along the mast. Wind shear occurs because of friction above a water surface slowing {{the flow of}} air. The ratio of wind at the surface to wind at a height above the surface varies by a power law with an exponent of 0.11-0.13 over the ocean. This means that a 5-m/s (≈10-knot) wind at 3 m above the water would be approximately 6 m/s (≈12 knots) at 15 m above the water. In hurricane-force winds with 40-m/s (≈78 knots) at the surface the speed at 15 m would be 49 m/s (≈95 knots). This suggests that sails that reach higher above the surface can be subject to stronger wind forces that move the centre of effort on them higher above the surface and increase the <b>heeling</b> <b>moment.</b> Additionally, apparent wind direction moves aft with height above water, which may necessitate a corresponding twist {{in the shape of}} the sail to achieve attached flow with height.|$|R
