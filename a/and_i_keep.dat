500|$|Under {{new manager}} Charlie Manuel, whose {{offensive}} strategy predominantly revolved around hitting lots of home runs, Rollins struggled {{to post a}} strong batting average early in the Phillies' 2005 season, as he too tried to hit home runs. Nevertheless, he was again selected to the NL All-Star team. His offensive strategy changed in early August, when he began a hitting streak that spanned the season's final 36 games; during the streak, he hit [...]379. It was the longest hitting streak in Phillies' history, surpassing Ed Delahanty, whose streak lasted 31 games. Throughout the streak, Rollins aspired to maintain a team-first mentality, and noted that he would trade the streak for a playoff berth: [...] "If we lose <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>keep</b> the streak, what does that mean? The season is automatically over. The playoffs is everything. That's what we all want." [...] Ultimately, the Phillies missed the playoffs by one game. Overall, Rollins compiled his fourth career quadruple-double, tying Johnny Damon for most among active players, and posted a [...]290 batting average with 12 home runs, 54 RBIs, and 41 stolen bases.|$|E

I embrace that throne which is in Unu, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>keep</b> guard over the Egg of Nekek-ur. It flourisheth, and I flourish; it liveth, and I live; it snuffeth the air, and I snuff the air, I the Osiris Ani, whose word is truth, in peace.|$|E
2500|$|In 1992, DeVille {{recorded}} Backstreets of Desire, {{the first}} of four albums he would record in Los Angeles with producer John Philip Shenale. [...] "I say it every time I record in L.A. — that I'll never do it again, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>keep</b> doing it... It's crazy. I just record and go to the hotel, and never go out, then back to the studio. I hate L.A. It's the worst. I think they eat their children there. I never saw any kids. It's a pity there aren't more studios in New Orleans." [...] Although DeVille complained about having to record in Los Angeles, recording in that city put him in touch with many talented Latino musicians who helped shape his distinctive Spanish-Americana sound.|$|E

2500|$|Hirsh {{had good}} leverage, pitched down to hitters, {{and had a}} refined {{repertoire}} of pitches. [...] He had a [...] "plus" [...] 2-seam fastball that had sink and good movement at 91–94mph, and threw a [...] "filthy" [...] hard-breaking slider that was consistently precise, and had bite at 80–86mph (managers rated it the best breaking ball in the Texas League). [...] Hirsh continued to refine his moderate changeup, which had fair deception and movement in the low-80s. [...] He also threw a 4-seam fastball in the 94–96mph range. [...] He was not afraid to pitch inside, and threw strikes to {{both sides of the}} plate. [...] "I'm 6-foot-8 <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>keep</b> a high three-quarters arm angle," [...] noted Hirsh. [...] "You figure the mound is a foot and a half, and my arm may be another two, three, four feet. [...] It makes the batter have to look up instead of straight at me, and he may have a difficult time adjusting." [...] During the 2007 season, Hirsh had trouble throwing his fastball enough. Pitching coach Bob Apodaca gave this assessment of Hirsh before 2008: [...] "All Jason has to do is trust his stuff. [...] He has the type of fastball you work off, but he was using his fastball the way you'd use an off-speed pitch —- to try and trick hitters." ...|$|E
