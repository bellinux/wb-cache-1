40|$|The two <b>access</b> <b>viaducts</b> to the {{drawbridge}} of Leixões harbour {{are connected}} with the metallic structure of the drawbridge and allow the passage between the two towns, Leça da Palmeira and Matosinhos. The viaducts are concrete structures, composed of wall-columns and abutments, in reinforced concrete, supporting longitudinal beams placed side by side and braced by transversal beams, all of prestressed concrete. The slab is also in reinforced concrete. The viaducts built between 1957 and 1960, were repaired between 1991 and 1993. As the drawbridge was inadequate for both {{the road and the}} harbour traffic, it was replaced and some of the spans of the viaducts were demolished and all the concrete was repaired between 2006 and 2008. The aim of this work was, before this last rehabilitation, to make a diagnosis of the deterioration of the concrete viaducts. After collecting and analyzing all the information about the characteristics of the different materials used in concrete and its composition and properties, a visual inspection of the structure was made, and all relevant evidence of deterioration was recorded and photographed. Some samples of apparently non-deteriorated concrete and visually deteriorated concrete were extracted for analysis. The carbonation and the chloride ingress were determined in samples of apparently nondeteriorated concrete. All samples were observed and analyzed by scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) ...|$|R
50|$|In {{light of}} the spectacular, and topographically {{extremely}} difficult, rises and falls of the Castielertobel (the so-called Bärenfalle, or bear traps, which, despite being relatively close to the nearby cantonal road, were almost unknown before the Arosa line was constructed), the engineers {{had to resort to}} using fire and smoke signals to help them survey the line's route. During construction of the <b>viaduct,</b> <b>access</b> was provided to the construction site from Sassal via Calfreisertobel, on makeshift tracks laid over the already completed railway formation. Horses pulled the necessary materials to the construction site on transporter wagons.|$|R
5|$|In March 2013, the Barmouth <b>Viaduct</b> <b>Access</b> Group (B-VAG), was {{established}} to investigate an alternative route from the town centre to the bridge, as the current walkway is steep, narrow, and unsuitable for buggies or wheelchairs. In June, the toll was removed after the collectors left and were not replaced. The council have not yet decided {{how to pay for}} the bridge's maintenance costs, which were £39,405 for the year. This has proved to be problematic as the revenue collected from tolls has not been sufficient to cover the council's share of costs, and there is not a sufficient budget to employ any full-time staff to collect payments.|$|R
50|$|Pedestrian access {{between the}} two street levels was {{effected}} via four pavilions, at each side and either end, containing staircases for <b>access</b> from the <b>viaduct</b> to Farringdon Street below; with their parapets adorned with figurative statues to represent commerce and agriculture on the south side, both by sculptor Henry Bursill, with science and fine art on the north side, by the sculpture firm Farmer & Brindley; there are also statues of Lord Mayors William Walworth and Henry Fitz-Ailwin. In 1941 the Blitz raids destroyed and damaged most of the area including the north side pavilions; these were copied and reinstated with associated property developments in 2000 (western) and 2014 (eastern), including lifts.|$|R
5000|$|One {{means of}} {{alleviating}} {{the lack of}} facilities has been to provide for a cycleroute, the [...] "Ruby Way" [...] - part of the National Cycle Network, along the trackbed of the former railway which opened in 2005, linking Holsworthy with Bude and Halwill. The cycleway brought one of the viaducts (Derriton) back into public use. Both {{are now in the}} ownership of Sustrans. Torridge District Council has indicated that the viaducts, as well as the trackbed, are safeguarded against future development in accordance with planning policies. <b>Access</b> to Derriton <b>Viaduct</b> is provided by the [...] "Cornish Corkscrew", an elaborate spiralling ramp. In the meantime, Devon County Council have continued to support the development and extension of the cycleway project by purchasing further sections of trackbed and seeking to connect the Bude to Holsworthy route to other cyclepaths such as the Cornish Way at Helebridge.|$|R
40|$|As a {{consequence}} of the industrial and tourist development of the region, it was necessary to construct a bridge across the Loire taking into account conditions such as the geological nature of the Loire river bed, the passing of up to 200, 000 t oil tankers and other factors which were of utmost importance for the design and the subsequent construction. &# 13; The work consist of two <b>access</b> <b>viaducts</b> and the central metal bridge. &# 13; The viaduct, the outlines of which are curved in mutually opposite senses, are of prestressed concrete. They are made up equal spans, each of which has a length of 50. 70 m between the pile axes, with in all 22 on the north side and 30 on the south side. Each span consists of: 4 prefabricated girders which are joined at the ends by tie members; between the girders there is a 0. 50 cm thick fill layer, over which there is a reinforced concrete slab. The supporting piers, also of reinforced concrete, have a foundation of piles which generally speaking rest on the rocky substratum of the riverbed. The metal part rests upon two main piers, situated on either side, with same type of foundation as mentioned above. On these are located inverted V-shape pylons, with a short vertical element, to which the cables that support the centre bridge deck are anchored, formed by 96 m and 16 m long spans, welded together after having been lifted to their final level. This project —the greatest in France and the one that has the greatest clear span among the works of this kind— has required three years of work utilizing the most modern techniques and systems. More than 80, 000 m 2 of concrete and more than 17, 000 t of different kinds of steel have been used. Como consecuencia del desarrollo industrial y turístico de la región, fue preciso construir un puente sobre el Loira, contando con condicionantes tales como la naturaleza geológica del lecho del Loira, el paso de petroleros de hasta 200. 000 t, y otros factores que influyeron grandemente en el proyecto y posterior construcción. &# 13; La obra consta de dos viaductos de acceso y el puente metálico central. &# 13; Los primeros, cuyo trazado sigue curvas opuestas, se construyeron en hormigón pretensado. Están formados por tramos iguales, de 50, 70 m de luz entre ejes de pilas, con un total de 22 en la orilla norte y 30 en la sur. Cada tramo lleva: 4 vigas prefabricadas que se unen con tirantes en los extremos; un relleno de 0, 50 m de espesor entre ellas y una losa superior de hormigón armado. Las pilas de sustentación, también de hormigón armado, cuentan con una cimentación de pilotes apoyados generalmente sobre el substrato rocoso del fondo del río. La parte metálica apoya sobre dos pilas principales situadas en ambas orillas, COEI el mismo tipo de cimentación que el resto. Sobre ellas se elevan los pilones, en forma de V invertida, con un elemento vertical corto donde anclan los cables que soportan el tablero central, formado por tramos metálicos de 96 y 16 m de longitud, que se sueldan entre sí una vez izados a su nivel definitivo. &# 13; Para realizar esta obra, la más grande de Francia y que ostenta el récord de luz libre entre las de su tipo, se necesitaron más de 3 años de trabajos utilizando las técnicas y sistemas más modernos. Se emplearon 80. 000 m 2 de hormigón y más de 17. 000 t de distintas clases de aceros...|$|R
