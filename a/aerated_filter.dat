Fundamental research into biofilms is presented in three sections, Biofilm Types and Characterization, Advantages and Drawbacks and Design Parameters.

However, the use of RF to remove nutrients, such as nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), is very limited. Therefore, the present study was carried out to investigate the performance of aerated FW (ARF) systems for removing both nitrogen and phosphorus from domestic wastewater using blast furnace slag (BFS) as the filter medium. The performance of two <b>aerated</b> BFS <b>filter</b> systems, an <b>aerated</b> horizontal-flow BFS <b>filter</b> and an <b>aerated</b> vertical up-flow BFS filter, have been monitored and were compared: for N and P removals. A further aim of the study was to determine if either or both of these <b>aerated</b> BFS <b>filter</b> systems could produce effluents which complied with the nutrient removal requirements of the EU Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive (UWWTD) (91 / 271 /EEC) for small communities. From the results of the present study it can be concluded that the both <b>aerated</b> BFS <b>filter</b> systems are suitable unit processes for removing ammonium-N and P from primary facultative pond effluents as the systems were able to produce high effluent quality to levels below the EU UWWTD maximum permissible limit. The <b>aerated</b> vertical-upflow BFS <b>filter</b> has the advantage of removing more ammonium-N (to below 1 mg NIL), but the disadvantage of removing less total- N.

50|$|Aerobic {{digestion}} is {{a bacterial}} process {{occurring in the}} presence of oxygen resembling a continuation of the activated sludge process. Under aerobic conditions, bacteria rapidly consume organic matter and convert it into carbon dioxide. Once {{there is a lack of}} organic matter, bacteria die and are used as food by other bacteria. This stage of the process is known as endogenous respiration. Solids reduction occurs in this phase. Because the aerobic digestion occurs much faster than anaerobic digestion, the capital costs of aerobic digestion are lower. However, the operating costs are characteristically much greater for aerobic digestion because of energy used by the blowers, pumps and motors needed to add oxygen to the process.

40|$|Biological {{processes}} {{have been}} used to treat waste waters for many years in order to improve public health, remove offensive odours and to reduce pollution in the receiving watercourse. In the 1980 's public concern led to UK and European legislation to further improve the treatment required of sewage prior to passing to a watercourse. This legislation is now embodied in the UK Bathing Water Directive and the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive. This has lead to the improvement of sewerage and the reduction of the number of sewage discharges, as more sewers are now being fed to sewage treatment works. Sewage works have therefore often become overloaded and now require to be upgraded in order to meet these legislative requirements. In some cases completely new sewage treatment works have been required. Development of sewage treatment works is often in already built up areas where land can be often restricted. This combination of a sizeable market with technical constraints such as available land, odour control requirements and noise restriction has encouraged major innovation and development of sewage treatment processes to provide cost effective solutions using new technology. One such innovative process is the Biological <b>Aerated</b> <b>Filter</b> (BAF) of which many systems are now available on the market and well over 100 plants are currently operated worldwide, treating both industrial and domestic waste water for carbonaceous pollutant, ammonia or complete nitrogen removal.

The performance of the columns under several flow rates and leachate strengths was studied in terms of BOD 5 removal efficiencies and electricity generation, when a fixed resistive load was connected. Results obtained demonstrated {{that it is possible}} to generate electricity and simultaneously treat landfill leachate in MFC columns. Energy generation in MFC columns improved with increasing flow rates from 24 to 192 mL/h, while BOD 5 removal efficiency levels reached a maximum at 48 mL/h and dropped to relatively low values at higher flow rates. The maximum removal efficiencies were obtained at a loading rate of 0. 81 kg BOD 5 /m 3 d for columns C 1, C 2 and C 4 and 1. 81 kg BOD 5 /m 3 d for column C 3. Electrical output levels and BOD 5 concentrations at the MFC columns showed a linear relationship, which allows the system to be used as a BOD 5 sensor.

Using a process configuration selection matrix, this paper explores the practicability of placing a hypothetical cross flow structured plastic media (CFSP) trickling filter (TF) immediately ahead of an existing conventional trickling filter process (CTFP), without intermediate clarification. The viability of this configuration is subsequently demonstrated using an empirical multispecies TF model. This predicts the enhanced nitrification performance of the CTFP by simulating prior removals of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD). The model predictions propose that prior 50 - 80 % BOD removals can allow for further reductions in effluent ammoniacal nitrogen (NH 4 -N) concentrations of 40 - 70 %, respectively. This illustrates that adopting low energy TF technologies can eliminate the requirement for more energy intensive alternatives, such as submerged <b>aerated</b> <b>filters</b> (SAF).

Accordingly, the overall objective {{of this study was}} to develop a lowcost RF system for the purpose of enhanced nutrient removal from WSP effluents, which would be able to produce effluents which comply with the requirements of the EU Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive (UWWTD) (911271 lEEC) and suitable for small communities. Therefore, a combination system comprising a primary facultative pond and an <b>aerated</b> rock <b>filter</b> (ARF) system-either vertically or horizontally loaded-was investigated at the University of Leeds' experimental station at Esholt Wastewater Treatment Works, Bradford, UK. Blast furnace slag (BFS) and limestone were selected for use in the ARF system owing to their high potential for P removal and their low cost. This study involved three major qperiments: (1) a comparison of aerated vertical-flow and horizontal-flow limestone filters for nitrogen removal; (2) a comparison of aerated limestone + blast furnace slag (BFS) <b>filter</b> and <b>aerated</b> BFS <b>filters</b> for nitrogen and phosphorus removal; and (3) a comparison of vertical-flow and horizontal-flow BFS filters for nitrogen and phosphorus removal. The vertical upward-flow ARF system was found to be superior to the horizontal-flow ARF system in terms of nitrogen removal, mostly thiough bacterial nitrification processes in both the aerated limestone and BFS filter studies. The BFS filter medium (whieh is low-cost) showed a much higher potential in removing phosphortls from pond effluent than the limestone medium. As a result, the combination of a vertical upward-flow ARF system and an economical and effective P-removal filter medium, such as BFS, was found to be an ideal optionfor the total nutrient removal of both nitrogen and phosphorus from wastewater. In parallel with these experiments, studies on the <b>aerated</b> BFS <b>filter</b> effective life and major in-filter phosphorus removal pathways were carried out.
