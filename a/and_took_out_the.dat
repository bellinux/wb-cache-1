500|$|Cumming went ashore under a {{flag of truce}} to {{meet with}} the town's {{governor}} and demand the handing over of the merchant ships within three hours. [...] The governor refused to comply but the Russian troops left the town shortly afterwards and the governor stated that, whilst he could not order them out of the harbour, Cumming and Key would be permitted to enter the harbour to take them. [...] They proceeded to do so, finding themselves in control of the entire town of 10,000 inhabitants with just 110 men, <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> eight merchant vessels without firing a shot. [...] The ships were sent with prize crews to the Prussian port of Memel. [...] Cumming and Conflict also saw service at the port of Riga in this period and from 15 April to 22 May were responsible for boarding 19 vessels.|$|E

500|$|This {{characterisation}} of the Scots {{was often}} politically motivated, {{and many of}} the most hostile writers were based in areas frequently subjected to Scottish raids. English and French accounts of the Battle of the Standard contain many accounts of Scottish atrocities. For instance, Henry of Huntingdon notes that the Scots: [...] "cleft open pregnant women, <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> unborn babes; they tossed children upon the spear-points, and beheaded priests on altars: they cut the head of crucifixes, and placed them on the trunks of the slain; and placed the heads of the dead upon the crucifixes. Thus wherever the Scots arrived, all was full of horror and full of savagery." [...] A less hostile view was given by Guibert of Nogent in the First Crusade, who encountered Scots and wrote that: [...] "You might have seen a crowd of Scots, a people savage at home but unwarlike elsewhere, descend from their marshy lands, with bare legs, shaggy cloaks, their purse hanging from their shoulders; their copious arms seemed ridiculous to us, but they offered their faith and devotion as aid." ...|$|E
500|$|Larsson's team-mate Lieuwe Westra {{attacked}} with around [...] remaining, but {{his effort}} was quickly neutralised by Chavanel, {{one of a}} number of [...] riders in the group hoping to help Tom Boonen in a sprint finish lead-out. Following another failed attack from [...] rider Andreas Klier, it was left to the sprinters to battle it out for the stage honours. 's John Degenkolb– who had recovered to the group after a puncture with [...] remaining– was the first to make an attempt for the line, closely followed by José Joaquín Rojas (...) , but both were out-sprinted by Boonen, who went to the inside of Degenkolb <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> victory, for the 100th individual victory of his career, and his team's first at UCI World Tour level. Rojas just beat Degenkolb for second place on the line with Sep Vanmarcke and Francesco Gavazzi rounding out the top five for [...] and [...] respectively. Following his finish in the lead group, Wiggins assumed the overall lead from Larsson, with Boonen taking the points classification lead while moving into third place overall behind team-mate Leipheimer, thanks to the bonus seconds on offer at the finish.|$|E
500|$|The Dudley Boyz then faced Tommy Dreamer and The Sandman in {{the main}} event. As the match was about to begin, the bWo, a stable {{consisting}} of Hollywood Nova, Stevie Richards and The Blue Meanie entered the ring. Kid Kash interfered, and Balls Mahoney and Axl Rotten then came to the ring with steel chairs <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> bWo. They attacked all {{three members of the}} bWo before hitting Nova with a steel chair twice. Styles made a reference to Simon Dean, the character Nova played with WWE, by stating [...] "That's more painful than being Simon Dean on national TV." [...] When the match eventually started, it involved trash cans, cheese graters and street signs. The Impact Players interfered, attacking Dreamer and Sandman. Francine, Dreamer's former manager, entered the ring and delivered a low blow to Dreamer. Dreamer's other valet and real life wife, Beulah McGillicutty, returned to wrestling {{for the first time in}} over seven years, sparking a catfight with Francine. The Dudley Boyz eventually won with the help of Spike Dudley, who had just turned heel. They sent Dreamer through a flaming table with a Powerbomb to get the victory. The Dudleyz attempted to attack McGillicutty before Sandman attacked them with a Singapore cane. Sandman shouted for a beer repeatedly. Stone Cold Steve Austin then made his way to the ring, with the ECW Originals coming out moments later. Austin referenced his time in ECW and then asked the crusaders to come to the ring. A huge brawl occurred, with the Originals fighting the Crusaders. The crowd chanted [...] "We Want Taz", which brought Taz to the ring and he then locked Kurt Angle in the Tazmission. During the brawl, JBL legitimately attacked Blue Meanie, causing him to bleed. The Originals came out on top, as The Dudley Boyz performed a 3D on Bischoff, Benoit delivered a diving headbutt to Bischoff and Mysterio performed a 619 on Bischoff. Austin asked for Bischoff's thoughts on the event while on the ground, and Bischoff replied, [...] "Fuck ECW". Austin then executed the Stone Cold Stunner on Bischoff to end the show.|$|E

2500|$|However, {{although}} Elliott {{claims that}} he was not in possession of the facts of the event, the original citation that Elliott wrote (which is not the citation that appears in [...] "Unfit for Command") incorporates most of the details in the after action report. The report states that Kerry chased and shot a single wounded, fleeing Viet Cong. In addition, it states that the PCFs were filled with troops, that all three boats turned into the first ambush and beached, that the troops conducted the first sweep, and that while Kerry led the first landing party during the second sweep, the other landing parties and troops followed <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> VC.|$|E
2500|$|The {{shooting}} {{took place}} at Accent Signage Systems, a sign-making business located in the Bryn Mawr neighborhood of Minneapolis, which is bisected by Interstate 394. Andrew John Engeldinger, {{an employee of the}} firm, was called over to the office of operations director John Souter. Before going to the executive offices, Engeldinger first went to his car, apparently to retrieve a Glock 19 9mm handgun. When he was informed by Souter that he was losing his job, Engeldinger responded with [...] "Oh, really?" [...] <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> handgun from his holster. A struggle over the handgun ensued between Engeldinger, Souter, and top manager Rami Cooks; gunshots severely wounded Souter and fatally wounded Cooks. Engeldinger then left Souter's office, shooting and killing company founder Reuven Rahamim, who was stepping out of his office, which was next to Souter's. He then left the executive offices and entered a sign-display area, killing Jacob Beneke, an employee from Maple Grove. Engeldinger then moved on to the loading dock area, where he shot and killed a second employee, Ronald Edberg of Brooklyn Center. He also killed Keith Basinski, a UPS driver who was on a delivery, as he was seated in his truck. Engeldinger then entered the production floor and continued firing, fatally wounding production manager Eric Rivers and grazing another employee.|$|E

2500|$|David {{advanced}} {{into the}} English lands taking blackmail payments from settlements and establishments that paid and plundering and burning {{those that did}} not. The army which invaded England in the January and February 1138 shocked the English chroniclers, and the shock was compounded even more {{by the fact that}} it was led by [...] "their" [...] David. Richard of Hexham called it [...] "an execrable army, savager than any race of heathen yielding honour to neither God nor man" [...] and that it [...] "harried the whole province and slaughtered everywhere folk of either sex, of every age and condition, destroying, pillaging and burning the vills, churches and houses". Several doubtful stories of cannibalism entered the chronicle records. as well as routine enslavings and killings of churchmen, women and infants. Henry of Huntingdon wrote that the Scots: “cleft open pregnant women, <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> unborn babes; they tossed children upon the spear-points, and beheaded priests on altars: they cut the head of crucifixes, and placed them on the trunks of the slain; and placed the heads of the dead upon the crucifixes. Thus wherever the Scots arrived, all was full of horror and full of savagery”. By February, King Stephen had mustered an army which marched north to deal with David. The two armies avoided each other, and Stephen was soon on the road back into the south. In the summer, David split his army into two forces, sending William fitz Duncan to march into Lancashire, where he harried Furness and Craven. On 10 June, William fitz Duncan was met by force of knights and men-at-arms. A pitched battle took place, the battle of Clitheroe, and the result was that the English army was routed.|$|E
