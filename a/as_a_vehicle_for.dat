5|$|A {{total of}} sixty-nine poems, sixty short stories, and three serials were {{published}} in Asia Raya, a newspaper in the Dutch East Indies and early Indonesia. First published on 29 April 1942, months after the Empire of Japan invaded the Indies, Asia Raya was established under the occupation government and intended <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>for</b> pro-Japanese propaganda– including literature. Run by both Japanese and native staff, the newspaper remained in publication until 7September 1945, closing {{less than a month}} after Indonesia proclaimed its independence.|$|E

Internal improvements progressed as well; railroad mileage in the state increased from 242 miles to 568 miles during Morehead's term.|$|E
5|$|Reduced {{to a minor}} character, the new fictional Napoleon became not a world {{historical}} figure but {{an intimate}} one, fashioned by individuals' needs and consumed as popular entertainment. In their attempts to represent the emperor as a figure of national unity, proponents and detractors of the Third Republic used the legend <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>for</b> exploring anxieties about gender and fears about the processes of democratization that accompanied this new era of mass politics and culture.|$|E
5|$|Sunny Stories {{was renamed}} Enid Blyton's Sunny Stories in January 1937, and served <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>for</b> the {{serialisation}} of Blyton's books. Her first Naughty Amelia Jane story, about an anti-heroine {{based on a}} doll owned by her daughter Gillian, {{was published in the}} magazine. Blyton stopped contributing in 1952, and it closed down the following year, shortly before the appearance of the new fortnightly Enid Blyton Magazine written entirely by Blyton. The first edition appeared on 18 March 1953, and the magazine ran until September 1959.|$|E

5|$|Although these criticisms still {{form the}} {{prevailing}} {{view on the}} History's literary worth, modern scholars such as Rohrbacher have begun to argue that, while it is poorly written and not a stylistic or polished work, its use of allusion <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>for</b> parodying popular late 4th century biographical and historiographical works means that the very features which were once a cause for intense criticism (such as the inclusion of irrelevant or contradictory inventions alongside traditionally sourced material) are actually an intentional and {{integral part of the}} work, {{making it one of the}} most unique pieces of literature to emerge from the ancient world.|$|E
5|$|As the Cold War {{developed}} and the Guatemalan government clashed with U.S. corporations on {{an increasing number}} of issues, the U.S. government grew increasingly suspicious of the Guatemalan Revolution. In addition, the Cold War predisposed the Truman administration to see the Guatemalan government as communist. Arévalo's support for the Caribbean Legion also worried the Truman administration, which saw it <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>for</b> communism, rather than as the anti-dictatorial force it was conceived as. Until the end of its term, the Truman administration had relied on purely diplomatic and economic means to try and reduce the perceived communist influence. The U.S. had refused to sell arms to the Guatemalan government after 1944; in 1951 it began to block all weapons purchases by Guatemala.|$|E
5|$|Growing up in Pittsburgh, creator Ben Jones had an {{appreciation}} for comics and animation. His father's Macintosh computer served <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>for</b> Jones to create art and influenced his later visual style. Jones attended the Massachusetts College of Art and Design in the mid-1990s, where he became motivated to launch a project he could adapt to different media. This impetus manifested itself in the characters Alfe, Horace, and Roba. Tux Dog, another principal character, was designed while Jones was in primary school. After his graduation, Jones formed the art collective Paper Rad with Jessica and Jacob Ciocci in 2000. The collective moved that year to Providence, Rhode Island, {{to participate in the}} Fort Thunder music venue. After the venue's closure in 2001, Jones released animations on the Web using Adobe Flash, with some featuring Alfe.|$|E

5|$|Once General Tire {{sold the}} network in 1957, Mutual's {{ownership}} was largely {{disconnected from the}} stations it served, leading to a more conventional, top-down model of program production and distribution. Not long after the sale, one of the network's new executive teams was charged with accepting money to use Mutual <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>for</b> foreign propaganda. The network's reputation was severely damaged, but soon rebounded. Mutual changed hands frequently in succeeding years—even leaving aside larger-scale acquisitions and mergers, its final direct corporate parent, Westwood One, which purchased Mutual in 1985, was the seventh {{in a string of}} new owners that followed General Tire.|$|E
5|$|Reed's father, Charles Reed, was a {{successful}} London printer who later became a Member of Parliament (MP). Talbot attended the City of London School before leaving at 17 to join the family business in Fann Street. His literary career began in 1879, when the B.O.P. was launched. The family were staunchly Christian, pillars of the Congregational Church, and were heavily involved in charitable works. However, Reed did not use his writing <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>for</b> moralising, and was dismissive of those early school story writers who did, such as Dean Farrar. Reed's affinity with boys, his instinctive understanding of their standpoint in life and his gift for creating believable characters, ensured that his popularity survived through several generations. He was widely imitated by other writers in the school story genre.|$|E
5|$|Response unit – Also {{known as}} a fly-car or a , which is a vehicle {{which is used to}} reach an acutely ill patient quickly, and provide on scene care, but lacks the {{capacity}} to transport the patient from the scene. Response units may be backed up by an emergency ambulance which can transport the patient, or may deal with the problem on scene, with no requirement for a transport ambulance. These can be a wide variety of vehicles, from standard cars, to modified vans, motorcycles, pedal cycles, quad bikes or horses. These units can function <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>for</b> officers or supervisors (similar to a fire chief's vehicle, but for ambulance services). Fire & Rescue services in North America often staff EMTs or Paramedics to their apparatuses to provide medical care without the need to wait for an ambulance.|$|E

5|$|The first FPÖ {{party leader}} was Anton Reinthaller, a former Nazi Minister of Agriculture and SS officer. He {{had been asked}} by ÖVP Chancellor Julius Raab {{to take over the}} {{movement}} rather than let it be led by a more socialist-leaning group. While the majority of former Nazis had probably joined the two main parties in absolute numbers, they formed a greater percentage of FPÖ members due to the party's small size. Nevertheless, none of them were real revolutionaries and they pursued pragmatic, non-ideological policies. The FPÖ served <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>for</b> them to integrate in the Second Republic; the party was a welcome partner with both the SPÖ and ÖVP in regional and local politics, although it was excluded at the national level. The ÖVP and the FPÖ ran a joint candidate for the 1957 presidential election, who lost.|$|E
5|$|The symphony had {{established}} itself {{by the end}} of the 18th century as the most prestigious of instrumental genres. While the genre had been developed with considerable intensity throughout that century and appeared in a wide range of occasions, it was generally used as an opening or closing work; in between would be works that included vocal and instrumental soloists. Because of its lack of written text for focus, it was seen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>for</b> entertainment rather than for social, moral or intellectual ideas. As the symphony grew in size and artistic significance, thanks in part to efforts in the form by Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven, it also amassed greater prestige. A concurrent change in attitude toward instrumental music in general also took place, and the lack of text, once seen as a handicap, became considered a virtue.|$|E
5|$|A {{secondary}} theme which {{drives the}} contest for the champion's portion is the rivalry between the royal provinces of Connacht and Ulster, {{resolved in the}} contest of the two heroes Cet Mac Mágach and Conall Cernach. The presentation of this rivalry is coloured by the author's peculiar Leinster viewpoint. He turns both provinces to ridicule by the cunning of Mac Da Thó, King of Leinster; in particular, the author's political sympathies favour Connacht and remain hostile to Ulster to the end. To the heroes assembled, Mac Da Thó boasts that all the food provided for the feast is a mere trifle for the Leinstermen. It is tempting {{to conclude that the}} inspiration of the story is the claim of Leinster to supersede both Ulster and Connacht. However, it is apparent that {{by the time of the}} tale's composition, even the story-teller does not take the political issues very seriously, using the theme instead <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>for</b> a good story.|$|E

5|$|The {{primary source}} of {{information}} about the reign of Andrianampoinimerina is Tantara ny Andriana eto Madagasikara, a Malagasy language book relating the oral history of the Merina kings as collected by a Jesuit missionary, Francois Callet, in the late 19th century. Prior to the eventual release of a French language translation in the 1950s, references to the king in academic and popular writing during the colonial period de-emphasized his role as a conduit of traditional religious power and authority, instead glorifying his administrative practices in an attempt to bring greater credibility to the colonial government <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>for</b> building upon and strengthening the principles of good governance that he introduced. Beginning in the 1970s, historians began to focus more on the spiritual aspects of his role as king, and researchers questioned and compared sources in an effort to arrive at a more factual and balanced history of Andrianampoinimerina and his reign.|$|E
5|$|The {{series was}} {{developed}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>for</b> Eve under the working title The Opposite Sex; UPN executives approached the rapper about a television project after {{the success of}} fellow musician Brandy in another of the network's sitcoms—Moesha. Eve's series was created {{as part of the}} network's attempt to appeal to a younger audience. After being picked up, the show was renamed Eve to attract the rapper's fans. The series was set in Miami, but filmed at Sunset Gower Studios in Hollywood, Los Angeles. Eve said that she was intimidated at first by the process of preparing for and filming a sitcom, and she would later regret not fully committing to her character. The show was distributed by UPN in its original run, and later by TV One. UPN had promoted Eve as part of its new comedy block, one of four new comedies developed by the network.|$|E
5|$|When Charles {{attempted}} to impose his religious policies in Scotland he faced numerous difficulties. Although born in Scotland, Charles had become estranged from his northern kingdom; {{his first visit}} since early childhood was for his Scottish coronation in 1633. To the dismay of the Scots, who had removed many traditional rituals from their liturgical practice, Charles insisted that the coronation be conducted in the Anglican rite. In 1637, the king ordered {{the use of a}} new prayer book in Scotland that was almost identical to the English Book of Common Prayer, without consulting either the Scottish Parliament or the Kirk. Although written, under Charles's direction, by Scottish bishops, many Scots resisted it, seeing the new prayer book <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>for</b> introducing Anglicanism to Scotland. On 23 July, riots erupted in Edinburgh upon the first Sunday of the prayer book's usage, and unrest spread throughout the Kirk. The public began to mobilise around a reaffirmation of the National Covenant, whose signatories pledged to uphold the reformed religion of Scotland and reject any innovations that were not authorised by Kirk and Parliament. When the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland met in November 1638, it condemned the new prayer book, abolished episcopal church government by bishops, and adopted Presbyterian government by elders and deacons.|$|E
