40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a study in which a quality <b>assurance</b> <b>package</b> was {{introduced}} into 11 care homes for older people and evaluated. The package (Qual A Sess) has two features. First, {{it is designed to}} provide a mechanism for self-regulation, by providing homes with a framework for assessing care and services in a systematic way. Second, it promotes the participation of residents in the quality process, by including them as members of self-assessment teams. A case study methodology was used to evaluate the process of introduction, and this paper focuses on data from older people which describes their views about participation. The paper concludes that skills in communication and assessment, and sensitivity to individual needs and problems is required in order to facilitate meaningful participation from older people...|$|E
40|$|New {{technologies}} are challenging the traditional view {{of teaching and}} learning in higher education. Students also are asking for teaching and learning approaches that allow them greater flexibility in when, where and how they learn. Responses to these new imperatives must, however, be grounded by a commitment to quality teaching and learning outcomes for students. This paper is based on an ongoing teaching and learning project to develop a quality <b>assurance</b> <b>package</b> for online delivery of units across the Law Faculty at QUT. The paper critically evaluates criteria for assessing unit suitability for online delivery; guidelines for differing bands (full/partial) for online delivery of units; and duty statements for online unit coordinators. The process is grounded in educational theory; for example, Laurillard’s principled approach to mediating student learning using technology (1993), and Ramsden’s work on effective teaching in higher education (1992). The project represents a considered move by the Faculty to ensure decisions to adopt online delivery will be addressed in a systematic, coherent and pedagogically sound manner...|$|E

40|$|COSTAR, a COmputer-STored Ambulatory Record system, was {{developed}} at the Massachusetts General Hospital Laboratory of Computer Science. It can supplement or entirely replace the paper medical record with a highly encoded record. Although a computer-stored medical record provides a unique opportunity for quality assurance activities, it requires programming skills to examine the data. We have taken the dual approach of writing pre-specified quality <b>assurance</b> <b>packages</b> and developing a high level Medical Query Language (MQL) {{that can be used}} by non-programmers. While each approach has pros and cons, we are encouraged by our results which show that a quality assurance program can be written reasonably well in MQL by individuals who have little programming experience...|$|R
30|$|The web {{application}} is a fully integrated data management, real-time monitoring, analysis, and <b>assurance</b> <b>package</b> delivered through Azure. It enables subsurface engineers {{to perform a}} broad range of analyses related to exploration, production, injection, and disposal processes based on both real-time data and stored data, such as log-based stress and rock property estimation, injection pressure falloff analysis, and injection-induced fracture simulation in 3 D with an advanced fracture simulator (El-Fayoumi et al. 2011; Zaki et al. 2004). It provides stimulation, production, and injection engineers a common set of tools that they need to perform their typical workflows. In particular, the platform was developed to solve two particular pain points faced by engineers in today’s oil and gas service and operating companies: (1) how to integrate various data types from distinct engineering tasks and to generate (and share) the workflow results in a framework that can be used by non-specialists from various locations and (2) how to access real-time data from wells at multiple field sites and execute, either by hand or automatically, detailed well performance analyses using best-in-class simulators (that are computationally intensive), so that changes can be made in the field before serious issues arise.|$|E
40|$|This {{experiment}} safety <b>assurance</b> <b>package</b> (ESAP) is {{a revision}} of the last MOX ESAP issued in February 2001 (Khericha 2001). The purpose of this revision is to identify {{the changes in the}} loading pattern and to provide a basis to continue irradiation up to {approx} 42 GWd/MT burnup (+ 2. 5 %) as predicted by MCNP (Monte Carlo N-Particle) transport code before the preliminary postirradiation examination (PIE) results for 40 GWd/MT burnup are available. Note that the safety analysis performed for the last ESAP is still applicable and no additional analysis is required (Khericha 2001). In July 2001, it was decided to reconfigure the test assembly using the loading pattern for Phase IV, Part 3, at the end of Phase IV, Part 1, as the loading pattern for Phase IV, Parts 2 and 3. Three capsule assemblies will be irradiated until the highest burnup capsule assembly accumulates: {approx} 50 GWd/MT burnup, based on the MCNP code predictions. The last ESAP suggests {{that at the end of}} Phase IV, Part 1, we remove the two highest burnup capsule assemblies ({at} {approx} 40 GWd/MT burnup) and send them to ORNL for PIE. Then, irradiate the test assembly using the loading pattern for Phase IV, Part 2, until the highest burnup capsule reaches {approx} 40 GWd/MT burnup per MCNP-predicted values...|$|E
40|$|The Fissile Material Disposition Program Light Water Reactor Mixed Oxide Fuel Irradiation Test Project Plan details {{a series}} of test irradiations {{designed}} to investigate the use of weapons-grade plutonium in MOX fuel for light water reactors (LWR) (Cowell 1996 a, Cowell 1997 a, Thoms 1997 a). Commercial MOX fuel has been successfully used in overseas reactors for many years; however, weapons-derived test fuel contains small amounts of gallium (about 2 parts per million). A concern exists that the gallium may migrate out of the fuel and into the clad, inducing embrittlement. For preliminary out-of-pile experiments, Wilson (1997) states that intermetallic compound formation is the principal interaction mechanism between zircaloy cladding and gallium. This interaction is very limited by the low mass of gallium, so problems are not expected with the zircaloy cladding, but an in-pile experiment is needed to confirm the out-of-pile experiments. Ryskamp (1998) {{provides an overview of}} this experiment and its documentation. The purpose of this Experiment Safety <b>Assurance</b> <b>Package</b> (ESAP) is to demonstrate the safe irradiation and handling of the mixed uranium and plutonium oxide (MOX) Fuel Average Power Test (APT) experiment as required by Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) Technical Safety Requirement (TSR) 3. 9. 1 (LMITCO 1998). This ESAP addresses the specific operation of the MOX Fuel APT experiment with respect to the operating envelope for irradiation established by the Upgraded Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR) Lockheed Martin Idaho Technologies Company (LMITCO 1997 a). Experiment handling activities are discussed herein...|$|E
50|$|Although Modified Atmosphere Packaging is a {{well-established}} process, it {{is a good}} practice to maintain tight quality <b>assurance</b> through <b>package</b> testing. Incorrect oxygen levels, empty gas cylinders and bad sealing bars can cause imprecise gas blends and poor package seals that can result in product spoilage. Routine package testing with headspace gas analysers, on-line gas analysers and leak detectors assures package quality, and hence helps to maintain shelf life.|$|R

40|$|Persistent {{poor health}} care quality {{attributable}} to non-responsive alien models necessitated {{this study to}} develop quality <b>assurance</b> <b>package</b> (QAP) for health care in Nigeria with focus on Akwa Ibom State. Quality assurance index (QAI) was the instrument for data collection. A multi-stage random sample of 340 respondents was drawn from 840 health managers in primary health care settings in the state. The research and development (R&D) survey designed was used to develop the package through progressive steps such as: (a) Exploration and establishment of need for the package through library search; (b) determination of the elements (contents) for quality assurance; (c) preliminary validation of the elements; (d) empirical validation of the contents to determine the suitability; and (e) integral feedback mechanism. From {{the findings of the}} study, suitable elements for quality assurance identified were: the philosophy {(care should be at minimal risk to client (84. 9 %), care of benefit to client (79. 5 %), health worker should aim at best result as they demonstrate moral sense of duty (73. 6 %); workers should strive for best results (62. 4 %) }; objectives (giving consumers adequate information in tandem with local needs and exigencies (80. 4 %), continuous care innovations (67. 6 %), and safeguarding consumers ’ satisfaction (76. 6 %); and measures for quality assurance (continuous education for health workers (87. 2 %), licensing all health care givers (83. 5 %), close supervision (79. 8 %), minimizin...|$|E
40|$|The {{replacement}} of the ATR Control Complex's obsolete computer based Reactor Data Acquisition System (RDAS) and its safety-related Lobe Power Calculation and Indication System (LPCIS) software application is vitally important to ensure the ATR remains available to support this national mission. The RDAS supports safe operation of the reactor by providing 'real-time' plant status information (indications and alarms) {{for use by the}} reactor operators via the Console Display System (CDS). The RDAS is a computer support system that acquires analog and digital information from various reactor and reactor support systems. The RDAS information is used to display quadrant and lobe powers via a display interface more user friendly than that provided by the recorders and the Control Room upright panels. RDAS provides input to the Nuclear Engineering ATR Surveillance Data System (ASUDAS) for fuel burn-up analysis and the production of cycle data for experiment sponsors and the generation of the Core Safety <b>Assurance</b> <b>Package</b> (CSAP). RDAS also archives and provides for retrieval of historical plant data which may be used for event reconstruction, data analysis, training and safety analysis. The RDAS, LPCIS and ASUDAS need to be replaced with state-of-the-art technology in order to eliminate problems of aged computer systems, and difficulty in obtaining software upgrades, spare parts, and technical support. The major modification criteria evaluation of the project design did not lead {{to the conclusion that the}} project is a major modification. The negative major modification determination is driven by the fact that the project requires a one-for-one equivalent {{replacement of}} existing systems that protects and maintains functional and operational requirements as credited in the safety basis...|$|E
40|$|This Technical Paper {{describes}} Acceptance Testing and Commissioning of the Kodak DirectView CR- 850 {{digital radiography}} system {{installed at the}} Royal Adelaide Hospital. The first of its type installed in Australia, the system is a 'dry' image processor, for which no chemicals are required to develop images. Rather, latent radiographic images are stored on photostimulable phosphor screens, which are scanned and displayed by a reader unit. The image can be digitally processed and enhanced before it is forwarded to a storage device, printer or workstation display, thereby alleviating the need to re-expose patients to achieve satisfactory quality images. The phosphor screens are automatically erased, ready for re-use. Results are reported of tests carried out using the optional 'Total Quality Tool' quality <b>assurance</b> <b>package</b> installed with the system. This package includes analysis and reporting software which provides for simple testing and reporting of many important characteristics of the system, such as field uniformity, aspect ratio, line and pixel positions, image and system noise, exposure response, scan linearity, modulation transfer function (MTF) and image artefacts. Acceptance Tests were performed for kV and MV exposures. Resolution for MV exposures was at least 0. 8 l/mm, and measured phantom dimensions were within 1. 05 % of expected magnification. Reproducibility between cassettes was within 1. 6 %. The mean pixel values on the central axis were close to linear for MV exposures from 3 to 10 MU and reached saturation level at around 20 MU for 6 MV and around 30 MV for 23 MV beams. Noise levels were below 0. 2 %. E. Bezak and R. A. Nelliga...|$|E
40|$|Between 2010 and 2050, {{the economies}} of China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Thailand and Malaysia could account for some 57 % of the world’s total {{population}} as well as 91 % of the total Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the Asia-Pacific region. In addition the region, where 80 % of the world’s small and marginal farmers live and work, {{has the potential to}} loose or waste up to one-third of food produced as it moves along the supply chain. These significant features require a rethink in horticultural education programming, research and consultancy training in the region. The objective {{of this paper is to}} describe the current status of postharvest horticulture education, research training and consultancy in the Asia-Pacific region with an emphasis on the universities in the region. In a recent survey conducted results show that about one-third of universities in the region have baccalaureate and/or postgraduate qualifications that target postharvest horticulture. However, there is a general consensus that there are insufficient postgraduates in postharvest horticulture currently entering the market to replace those that were retiring. There is also an emerging opportunity for training people at the vocational level to provide the necessary skills/artisan training in postharvest horticulture and food technology. Higher priority areas for research training are in quality <b>assurance,</b> handling, <b>packaging</b> and transport, maturation, ripening and product losses, and storage and in consultancy area the higher priority areas are in handling, packaging and transport, cool chain and storage, economics, market access, and quality assurance. Challenges to be faced in the research and teaching sectors of postharvest horticulture include the need to seek further investment so as to strengthen a weak research and development sector, and greater collaborative and interdisciplinary research and teaching with the institutions and institutes, both nationally and internationally...|$|R
40|$|The Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) {{located at}} the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) is the world’s premiere test reactor for {{performing}} high fluence, large volume, irradiation test programs. The ATR has many capabilities and {{a wide variety of}} tests are performed in this truly one of a kind reactor, including isotope production, simple self-contained static capsule experiments, instrumented/controlled experiments, and loop testing under pressurized water conditions. Along with the five pressurized water loops, ATR may also have gas (temperature controlled) lead experiments, fuel boosted fast flux experiments, and static sealed capsules all in the core at the same time. In addition, any or all of these tests may contain fuel or moderating materials that can affect reactivity levels in the ATR core. Therefore the safety analyses required to ensure safe operation of each experiment as well as the reactor itself are complex. Each test has to be evaluated against stringent reactor control safety criteria, as well as the effects it could have on adjacent tests and the reactor as well as the consequences of those effects. The safety analyses of each experiment are summarized in a document entitled the Experiment Safety <b>Assurance</b> <b>Package</b> (ESAP). The ESAP references and employs the results of the reactor physics, thermal, hydraulic, stress, seismic, vibration, and all other analyses necessary to ensure the experiment can be irradiated safely in the ATR. The requirements for reactivity worth, chemistry compatibilities, pressure limitations, material issues, etc. are all specified in the Technical Safety Requirements and the Upgraded Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR) for the ATR. This paper discusses the ESAP process, types of analyses, types of safety requirements and the approvals necessary to ensure an experiment can be safely irradiated in the ATR...|$|E
40|$|Success in {{information}} warfare {{will depend on}} resilient, reconstitutable cyber assets {{and the ability to}} assess and respond to attacks. A cornerstone of this success will be the ability of Information Assurance professionals to develop sound security requirements and determine the suitability of evaluated security products for mission-specific systems. Recognizing the pedagogical value of applying security evaluation criteria such as the Common Criteria (CC) to information security education, we recently introduced a graduate-level Computer Science course focusing on methodical security requirements engineering based on the CC. This course aims to provide students with an understanding of how security evaluation criteria can be used to specify system security objectives, derive security requirements from security objectives, establish life cycle and development processes, and provide an organizational framework for research and development. Although imperfect, the paradigmatic process of the CC provides a usable framework for in-depth study of various tasks relating to system requirements derivation and verification activities: system requirements elicitation, threat analysis, security objectives definition and security requirements expression. In-class discussions address fundamental security design principles and disciplines for information and software assurance (e. g., formal methods and life cycle management) as applied to security requirements derivation. Coverage of advanced CC topics includes high assurance evaluation, international and U. S. scheme interpretation processes, guidance for Protection Profile development, CC evaluation methodology, and composite evaluation. This paper describes the scope and design of a pilot course offering. Laboratory projects focus on the differences between security functional and assurance requirements, mock evaluation of a draft Protection Profile, examination of the interpretation process in the U. S. scheme, and development of a preliminary sketch of a Composed <b>Assurance</b> <b>Package</b> for a hypothetical composed target system that is suitable for use in operational environments requiring medium robustness.
