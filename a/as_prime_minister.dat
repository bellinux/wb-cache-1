5|$|At the election, Labour lost 91 {{seats in}} the House of Commons, but the Conservatives failed to achieve an overall majority, {{resulting}} in the first hung parliament since 1974. Under the constitution governing {{what happens in the}} event of a hung parliament, Brown remained temporarily <b>as</b> <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister,</b> while the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives entered into talks aimed at forming a coalition government. Talks between the Liberal Democrats and Labour also took place. On 10 May, Brown announced his intention to resign as leader of the Labour Party and instructed the party to initiate the election of a new leader. Brown's continued presence <b>as</b> <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> was seen an obstacle to the negotiation of a Labour-Liberal Democrat deal. By 11 May, the possibility of a deal was becoming less likely as talks between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats continued. After a telephone conversation with his predecessor Tony Blair where Blair informed Brown that the election had shown that the British voters had lost faith in both him and the Labour Party and that the United Kingdom would not accept him continuing <b>as</b> <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister.</b> With this he concluded that he would not be able to form a government, Brown announced his resignation <b>as</b> <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister.</b> He also resigned as leader of the Labour Party with immediate effect. Brown was succeeded <b>as</b> <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> by David Cameron, while Harriet Harman became acting leader of the Labour Party.|$|E
