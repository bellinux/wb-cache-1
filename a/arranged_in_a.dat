5|$|In {{addition}} to their large compound eyes, wasps have several simple eyes known as ocelli, which are typically <b>arranged</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> triangle just forward of the vertex of the head. Wasps possess mandibles adapted for biting and cutting, like those of many other insects, such as grasshoppers, but their other mouthparts are formed into a suctorial proboscis, which enables them to drink nectar.|$|E
5|$|Inflorescence : Usually {{indeterminate}} (lacking terminal flower) as a raceme (Lilium); sometimes {{reduced to}} a single terminal flower (Tulipa). When pluriflor (multiple blooms), the flowers are <b>arranged</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cluster or rarely are subumbellate (Gagea) or a thyrse (spike).|$|E
5|$|Millipede eyes {{consist of}} several simple flat-lensed ocelli <b>arranged</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> group or patch {{on each side}} of the head. These patches are also called ocular fields or ocellaria.

5|$|Spirals {{are common}} in plants and in some animals, notably molluscs. For example, in the nautilus, a {{cephalopod}} mollusc, each chamber of its shell is an approximate copy of the next one, scaled by a constant factor and <b>arranged</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> logarithmic spiral. Given a modern understanding of fractals, a growth spiral {{can be seen as}} a special case of self-similarity.|$|E

5|$|Aetosaur {{material}} was first described by Swiss paleontologist Louis Agassiz in 1844. He named the genus Stagonolepis from the Lossiemouth Sandstone in Elgin, Scotland, but considered {{it to be}} a Devonian fish rather than a Triassic reptile. This may be because he considered the strata {{to be part of the}} Old Red Sandstone, and thus Paleozoic in age. Agassiz mistook the osteoderms for large rhomboidal scales, which he thought were <b>arranged</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> similar pattern to those of gars. He also thought that these supposed scales were very similar to those of the lobe-finned fish Megalichthys due to their large size.|$|E

5|$|Although {{bicycles}} and motorcycles can {{appear to be}} simple mechanisms with only four major moving parts (frame, fork, and two wheels), these parts are <b>arranged</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> way that makes them complicated to analyze. While it is an observable fact that bikes can be ridden even when the gyroscopic effects of their wheels are canceled out, {{the hypothesis that the}} gyroscopic effects of the wheels are what keep a bike upright is common in print and online.|$|E
5|$|Boosted by this spiritual experience, Afonso won {{the battle}} against an outnumbering enemy. Legend has it that Afonso killed the five Moorish kings of the Seville, Badajoz, Elvas, Évora and Beja taifas, before decimating the enemy troops. Hence, in {{gratitude}} to Jesus, he incorporated five shields <b>arranged</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cross—representing his divine-led victory over the five enemy kings—with each one carrying Christ's five wounds {{in the form of}} silver bezants. The sum of all bezants (doubling the ones in the central shield) would give thirty, symbolizing Judas Iscariot's thirty pieces of silver.|$|E
5|$|Brettingham {{moved on}} to other projects. In the 1760s, he was {{approached}} by his most illustrious patron, the Duke of York (brother of King George III), to design one of the greatest mansions in Pall Mall, namely York House. The rectangular mansion that Brettingham designed was built in the Palladian style on two principal floors, with the state rooms as at Norfolk House, <b>arranged</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> circuit around the central staircase hall. The house was a mere pastiche of Norfolk House, but for Brettingham it had the kudos of a royal occupant.|$|E
