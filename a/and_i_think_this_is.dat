500|$|In early 2013, Gosling {{announced}} that he was taking a break from acting, stating,“I’ve lost perspective on what I’m doing. I think it’s good for me {{to take a break and}} reassess why I’m doing it and how I’m doing it. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> probably a good way to learn about that.” Gosling's directorial debut Lost River competed in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival. The [...] "fantasy noir", written by Gosling, stars Christina Hendricks, Ben Mendelsohn, and Matt Smith. The film received largely unfavorable reviews. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian found it [...] "insufferably conceited" [...] and remarked that Gosling had lost [...] "any sense of proportion or humility." [...] Robbie Collin of The Telegraph described Lost River as [...] "mind-bogglingly pleased with itself", while Varietys Justin Chang dismissed the [...] "derivative" [...] film as a [...] "train-wreck." ...|$|E
2500|$|Most {{contemporary}} Christian {{leaders and}} scholars from mainstream churches, such as Anglicans and Lutherans, consider {{that there is}} no conflict between the spiritual meaning of creation and the science of evolution. According to the former Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, [...] "...for most of the history of Christianity, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> fair enough, most {{of the history of the}} Christianity there's been an awareness that a belief that everything depends on the creative act of God, is quite compatible with a degree of uncertainty or latitude about how precisely that unfolds in creative time." ...|$|E
2500|$|January 31, 2006 - Brian Tobin announces he {{will not}} seek the {{leadership}} of the Liberal Party of Canada. Mr. Tobin rationalized his stepping out of the running as an opportunity for the Liberal Party to heal, revitalize and rejuvenate itself. In his words: [...] "... I think it's time for new blood and I think it's time for new players <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> an opportunity for the Liberal party to renew itself and, in the process, to heal itself a little bit as well."

2500|$|In Diana Wynne Jones' Charmed Life (1977), two {{orphaned}} children receive magical education {{while living}} in a castle. The setting is a world resembling early 1900s Britain, where magic is commonplace. Diana Wynne Jones has stated in {{answer to a question}} on her webpage: [...] "I think Ms Rowling did get quite a few of her ideas from my books – though I have never met her, so I {{have never been able to}} ask her. My books were written many years before the Harry Potter books (Charmed Life was first published in 1977), so any similarities probably come from what she herself read as a child. Once a book is published, out in the world, it is sort of common property, for people to take ideas from and use, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> what happened to my books." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{have never}} enjoyed a war-even in written history--as I am enjoying this one. For {{this is the}} worthiest one that was ever fought, so far as my {{knowledge}} goes. It is a worthy thing to fight for one's freedom; it is another sight finer to fight for another man's. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> {{the first time it}} has been done.|$|E

60|$|<b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> all the {{conversation}} that I remember at dinner. When the repast was concluded a jug of hot water was placed before Sir Pitt, with a case-bottle containing, I believe, rum. Mr. Horrocks served myself and my pupils with three little glasses of wine, and a bumper was poured out for my lady. When we retired, she took from her work-drawer an enormous interminable piece of knitting; the young ladies began to play at cribbage with a dirty pack of cards. We had but one candle lighted, {{but it was in}} a magnificent old silver candlestick, and after a very few questions from my lady, I had my choice of amusement between a volume of sermons, and a pamphlet on the corn-laws, which Mr. Crawley had been reading before dinner.|$|E
6000|$|In the afternoon, Berkeley {{called to}} see whether Ernest had {{followed}} his suggestion, and was agreeably surprised to find a whole article already finished. He glanced through the neatly written pages, and was still more pleased to discover that Ernest, with an unsuspected outburst of practicality and practicability, had really hit upon a possible subject. 'This may do, Ernest,' {{he said with a}} sigh of relief. 'I dare say it will. I know Lancaster wants leader writers, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> quite good enough to serve his turn. I've spoken to him about you: come round with me now--he'll be at the office by four o'clock--and we'll {{see what we can do}} for you. It's absolutely useless sending anything to the editor of a daily paper without an introduction. You might write with the pen of the angel Gabriel, or turn out leaders which were a judicious mean between Gladstone, Burke, and Herbert Spencer, and it would profit you nothing, for the simple reason that he hasn't got the time to read them. He would toss Junius and Montesquieu into the waste paper basket, and accept copy on the shocking murder in the Borough Road from one of his regular contributors instead. He can't help himself: and what you must do, Ernest, is to become one of the regular ring, and combine to keep Junius and Montesquieu permanently outside.' ...|$|E
5000|$|Derby Councillor Chris Wynn, {{cabinet member}} for {{planning}} and highways, said [...] "The design with the bobbins and billowing silk idea will tie in well with the Silk Mill <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> will be very exciting {{when it comes to}} fruition." [...] It was decided in 2009 to close the Silk Mill museum for an unspecified period.|$|R
60|$|The {{others were}} very still, but I saw Carrington {{gaze at the}} speaker almost incredulously.

2500|$|On March 24, 2015, {{during an}} {{interview}} in Paraguay, Foster The People announced that {{they were working on}} a third album.

5000|$|Lisa Macklem from Spoiler TV {{said that}} she enjoyed the flashbacks and that they episode had some really great plot twists and turns."Once again, most of the {{character}} revelations felt natural, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> speaks once again to the extensive preparation that went into crafting this world.

5000|$|Without {{mentioning}} the criticism specifically, {{in an interview}} published on October 6, 2014 by Time, the game's creative director Alex Amancio said [...] "What we actually try to do, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> just a personal belief that we have, is to avoid reducing history...

I think the thing that’s often overlooked is that the theory requires a mechanism. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> why Freud ultimately I think was cast aside, because Freud had a lot of interesting ideas and suppositions about how the brain works, but he never offered any mechanisms.” ...|$|E
