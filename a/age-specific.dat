5|$|Barbauld's {{pedagogy}} was fundamentally {{based on}} John Locke's Some Thoughts Concerning Education (1693), {{the most influential}} pedagogical treatise in 18th-century Britain. Building on Locke's theory of the Association of Ideas, which he had outlined in Some Thoughts, philosopher David Hartley had developed an associationist psychology that greatly influenced writers such as Barbauld (who had read Joseph Priestley's redaction of it). For the first time, educational theorists and practitioners were {{thinking in terms of}} developmental psychology. As a result, Barbauld and the women writers she influenced produced the first graded texts and the first body of literature designed for an <b>age-specific</b> readership.|$|E
5|$|It {{has long}} been {{believed}} that a male black-throated blue warbler achieves reproductive maturation well into its first breeding season. A yearling participates in extra-pair mating and cuckoldry as much as or even more than older males. However, research by Graves has found opposing evidence in terms of testicular size and sperm production. Directional asymmetry is present in many passerine birds. The left testicle is often larger in size than the right one, and this holds true for both yearling and older male warblers. However, the testicle to body mass ratio nonetheless is much lower in yearlings than in older males. Moreover, older males have {{a greater degree of}} directional asymmetry than do yearlings. Because the size of testes in birds is correlated to the ejaculate quality, it is likely that females employ age-dependent choice in favor of older males who can be distinguished by their definitive <b>age-specific</b> plumage.|$|E

In a study by Booth et al., increases of phylloquinone intakes from 100μg to between 377 and 417μg for five days did not induce a significant change. Response may be <b>age-specific.</b>|$|E
25|$|However, {{for some}} purposes, such as {{pensions}} calculations, it is usual {{to adjust the}} life table used by assuming that <b>age-specific</b> death rates will continue to decrease over the years, as they have usually done in the past. That is often done by simply extrapolating past trends; but some models exist {{to account for the}} evolution of mortality like the Lee–Carter model.|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} to note that the statistic is usually based on past mortality experience and assumes that the same <b>age-specific</b> mortality rates will continue into the future. Thus, such life expectancy figures need to be adjusted for temporal trends before calculating how long a currently living individual of a particular age is expected to live. Period life expectancy remains a commonly used statistic to summarize the current health status of a population.|$|E
25|$|Benign {{epilepsy}} with centrotemporal spikes {{is thought}} to be a genetic disorder. An autosomal dominant inheritance with age dependency and variable penetrance has been reported, although not all studies support this theory. Linkage studies have pointed to a possible susceptibility region on chromosome 15q14, {{in the vicinity of the}} alpha-7 subunit of the acetylcholine receptor. Most studies show a slight male predominance. Because of the benign course and <b>age-specific</b> occurrence, it {{is thought to}} represent a hereditary impairment of brain maturation.|$|E

25|$|The church {{holds its}} normal worship {{services}} on Sunday during a three-hour block composed of three meetings: sacrament meeting, which features the church's weekly sacrament ritual and sermons by various selected members; Sunday School, featuring {{a lesson on}} various scriptural topics; and finally, each participant is assigned a meeting based on their age and sex, which could include a meeting of priesthood holders for males aged 12 and up separated into <b>age-specific</b> quorums, Relief Society for adult women, and {{a meeting of the}} Young Women organization for adolescent females. During the second and third hours, children under age 12 participate in activities of the Primary. Periodically, members participate in local, regional, and general church-wide conferences in lieu of Sunday services. General conference is broadcast semi-annually (April and October) from Salt Lake City, Utah.|$|E
25|$|Besides TKV and HtTKV, the {{estimated}} glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) {{has also been}} tentatively used to predict the progression of ADPKD. After the analysis of CT or MRI scans of 590 patients with ADPKD treated at the Mayo Translational Polycystic Kidney Disease Center, Irazabal and colleagues developed an imaging-based classification system to predict the rate of eGFR decline in patients with ADPKD. In this prognostic method, patients are divided into five subclasses of estimated kidney growth rates according to <b>age-specific</b> HtTKV ranges (1A, <1.5%; 1B, 1.5–3.0%; 1C, 3.0–4.5%; 1D, 4.5–6.0%; and 1E, >6.0%) as delineated in the CRISP study. The decline in eGFR over the years following initial TKV measurement is significantly different between all five patient subclasses, with those in subclass 1E having the most rapid decline.|$|E
25|$|Overall, First Nations {{individuals}} {{have some of}} the highest rates of suicide globally. Suicide rates are more than twice the sex-specific rate and also three times the <b>age-specific</b> rates of non-Aboriginal Canadians. Residential Aboriginals between ages 10 and 29 show an elevated suicide risk as compared to non-residential Aboriginals by 5–6 times. One theory for the increased incidences of suicide within Aboriginal populations as compared to the general Canadian population is called acculturation stress which results from the intersection of multiple cultures within one's life. This leads to differing expectations and cultural clashes within the community, the family and the individual. At the community level, a general economic disadvantage is seen, exacerbated by unemployment and low education levels, leading to poverty, political disempowerment and community disorganization. The family suffers through a loss of tradition as they attempt to assimilate into mainstream Canadian culture. These lead to low self-esteem in the individual as First Nations culture and tradition are marginalized affecting one's sense of self-identity. These factors combine to create a world where First Nations individuals feel they cannot identify completely as Aboriginal, nor can they fully identify as mainstream Canadians. When that balance cannot be found, many (particularly youths) turn to suicide as a way out.|$|E

2500|$|Forecasting age {{specific}} {{death rates}} and computing {{the life expectancy}} from the results with life table methods: that is usually more complex than simply forecasting life expectancy because the analyst must deal with correlated <b>age-specific</b> mortality rates, {{but it seems to}} be more robust than simple one-dimensional time series approaches. It also yields a set of age specific-rates that may be used to derive other measures, such as survival curves or life expectancies at different ages. The most important approach within this group is the Lee-Carter model, which uses the singular value decomposition on a set of transformed <b>age-specific</b> mortality rates to reduce their dimensionality to a single time series, forecasts that time series and then recovers a full set of <b>age-specific</b> mortality rates from that forecasted value.

2500|$|The {{starting}} point for calculating life expectancy is the <b>age-specific</b> death rates of the population members. If {{a large number of}} data is available, a statistical population can be created that allow the <b>age-specific</b> death rates to be simply taken as the mortality rates actually experienced at each age (the number of deaths divided by the number of years [...] "exposed to risk" [...] in each data cell). However, it is customary to apply smoothing to iron out, as much as possible, the random statistical fluctuations from one year of age to the next. In the past, a very simple model used for this purpose was the Gompertz function, but more sophisticated methods are now used.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>age-specific</b> {{death rates}} are {{calculated}} separately for separate groups {{of data that}} {{are believed to have}} different mortality rates (such as males and females, and perhaps smokers and non-smokers if data are available separately for those groups) and are then used to calculate a life table from which one can calculate the probability of surviving to each age. In actuarial notation, the probability of surviving from age [...] to age [...] is denoted [...] and the probability of dying during age [...] (between ages [...] and [...] ) is denoted [...] For example, if 10% of a group of people alive at their 90th birthday die before their 91st birthday, the <b>age-specific</b> death probability at 90 would be 10%. That is a probability, not a mortality rate.|$|E
