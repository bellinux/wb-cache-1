5|$|Modern {{scholars}} have not shared {{the confidence of}} their Hellenistic counterparts, and today the Catalogue is {{generally considered to be}} a post-Hesiodic composition.

5|$|Another {{similarity}} {{with the}} stegosaurs is the narrow head, which might indicate a selective diet consisting of high-quality fodder. However, Barrett {{pointed out that}} for an animal the size of Scelidosaurus, with a large gut allowing efficient fermentation, the intake of easily digestible food of high energetic value was less important than with smaller animals, that are often critically dependent on it. Norman concluded that Scelidosaurus fed on low scrubby vegetation, with a height up to one metre. Raising itself on its hindlimbs <b>alone,</b> <b>could</b> have vertically increased the feeding envelope and was perhaps anatomically possible, but Norman doubted it was a relevant part of its behaviour.|$|E

5|$|Huldrych Zwingli, {{a leading}} Protestant Reformer in Switzerland, taught three {{distinct}} baptisms: water baptism, teaching baptism (having been educated about the Christian religion) and Spirit baptism. While full baptism included all three, Zwingli {{emphasized that the}} external baptisms of water and teaching could not provide salvation. The inner baptism of the Spirit <b>alone</b> <b>could</b> save because it conferred faith. According to Zwingli, the three baptisms could be given separately; Spirit baptism could occur first or last in the sequence.|$|E
5|$|In 1900 and 1901, Harvard College Observatory {{director}} William Henry Pickering led two {{searches for}} trans-Neptunian planets. The first was begun by Danish astronomer Hans Emil Lau who, {{after studying the}} data on the orbit of Uranus from 1690 to 1895, concluded that one trans-Neptunian planet <b>alone</b> <b>could</b> {{not account for the}} discrepancies in its orbit, and postulated the position of two planets he believed were responsible. The second was launched when Gabriel Dallet suggested that a single trans-Neptunian planet lying at 47AU could account for the motion of Uranus. Pickering agreed to examine plates for any suspected planets. In neither case were any found.|$|E
5|$|In later life, he {{attempted}} to have Anna Maria Luisa recognised as the universal heiress of Tuscany, but CharlesVI, Holy Roman Emperor, would not allow it because Florence was nominally an imperial fief, and he felt he <b>alone</b> <b>could</b> alter the Tuscan laws of succession. All Cosimo's efforts to salvage the plan foundered, and in 1737, upon his younger son's death, Tuscany passed to the House of Lorraine.|$|E

5|$|It became {{apparent}} to the investigating science team that radial velocity data <b>alone</b> <b>could</b> not prove {{the existence of}} HAT-P-33b. As such, photometric observations of HAT-P-33 were conducted using the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory's 1.2-meter telescope, which hosted the KeplerCam CCD instrument. This data was used to create the light curve of HAT-P-33. In doing so, a slight dimming was observed where HAT-P-33b was believed to have transited its star.|$|E
5|$|Nabulsi soap was {{traditionally}} made {{by women}} for household use, {{even before the}} appearance of small soap-making factories in the 10th century. Trade with Bedouins was indispensable for soap-making, both in Nablus and Hebron, since they <b>alone</b> <b>could</b> furnish the alkaline soda (qilw) required by the process. By the 14th century a significant soap-making industry had developed in Nablus and the soap, reputedly prized by Queen Elizabeth I of England, was exported throughout the Middle East and to Europe.|$|E
5|$|A study {{published}} in the Neuropsychopharmacology journal in 2013 revealed the finding that the flavour of beer <b>alone</b> <b>could</b> provoke dopamine activity in the brain of the male participants, who wanted to drink more as a result. The 49 men in the study were subject to positron emission tomography scans, while a computer-controlled device sprayed minute amounts of beer, water and a sports drink onto their tongues. Compared with the taste of the sports drink, the taste of beer significantly increased the participants desire to drink. Test results indicated that the flavour of the beer triggered a dopamine release, even though alcohol content in the spray was insufficient for the purpose of becoming intoxicated.|$|E

5|$|In Syria, ethnic {{minorities}} were often underprivileged, and a specific ethnicity often {{belonged to a}} specific social class. The Alawites, the Druzes and the Isma'ilis for instance, were ethnic groups with low social class who began to embrace a radical form of Arab nationalism, e.g. Ba'athism. Without the peasantry there {{could not have been}} a Ba'athist revolution in Syria. The new middle class <b>alone</b> <b>could</b> only produce instability, but together with the peasantry, the revolution became possible. The inequality between urban and rural dwellers, together with capitalist penetration of the agrarian sector and the traditional elites' monopolisation of most large revenue sources, led to the establishment of peasant movements who fought for change, or opposed the system. The Syrian branch of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party was able to recruit young peasants from radical peasant movements, and because of it, was able to mobilise large sectors of the population.|$|E
5|$|The {{final results}} of the Italian {{campaign}} were limited {{in terms of the}} advantages gained by the Empire. The city of Ancona became a Byzantine base in Italy, accepting the Emperor as sovereign. The Normans of Sicily had been damaged and now came to terms with the Empire, ensuring peace for the rest of Manuel's reign. The Empire's ability to get involved in Italian affairs had been demonstrated. However, given the enormous quantities of gold which had been lavished on the project, it also demonstrated the limits of what money and diplomacy <b>alone</b> <b>could</b> achieve. The expense of Manuel's involvement in Italy must have cost the treasury a great deal (probably more than 2,160,000 hyperpyra or 30,000 pounds of gold), and yet it produced only limited solid gains.|$|E
5|$|The prerogatives and {{authority}} {{granted to the}} legislature within the Constitution meant that it could and would play a major and indispensable role in {{the functioning of the}} governmentâ€”it was not just a rubber stamp. The General Assembly <b>alone</b> <b>could</b> enact, revoke, interpret and suspend laws under Article13 of the Constitution. The legislature also held the power of the purse and was required to annually authorize expenditures and taxes. It alone approved and exercised oversight of government loans and debts. Other responsibilities entrusted to the Assembly included setting the size of the military's forces, the creation of offices within the government, monitoring the national welfare and ensuring that the government was being run in conformity to the Constitution. This last provision allowed the legislature wide authority to examine and debate government policy and conduct.|$|E

5|$|The steppe {{societies}} of Inner Asia, whose climate favoured a pastoral economy, stood {{in stark contrast}} to the Chinese mode of development. As animal herds are migratory by nature, communities could not afford to be stationary and therefore evolved as nomads. According to the influential Mongolist Owen Lattimore this lifestyle proved to be incompatible with the Chinese economic model. As the steppe population grew, pastoral agriculture <b>alone</b> <b>could</b> not support the population, and tribal alliances needed to be maintained by material rewards. For these needs, the nomads had to turn to the settled societies to get grains, metal tools, and luxury goods, which they could not produce by themselves. If denied trade by the settled peoples, the nomads would resort to raiding or even conquest.|$|E
5|$|There is some {{distance}} between legislation and its enforcement. The governmental attacks on recusancy were mostly upon the gentry. Few recusants were actually fined; the fines that were imposed were often at reduced rates; the persecution eased; priests came to recognise {{that they should}} not refuse communion to occasional conformists. The persecutions did not extinguish the faith, but they tested it sorely. The huge number of Roman Catholics in East Anglia and the North in the 1560s disappeared into the general population in part because recusant priests largely served the great Roman Catholic houses, which <b>alone</b> <b>could</b> hide them. Without the Mass and pastoral care, yeomen, artisans and husbandmen fell into conformism. Roman Catholicism, supported by foreign or expatriate priests, came to be seen as treasonous.|$|E
5|$|Scientific {{interpretations of}} the crest's {{function}} began in 1910, when George Francis Eaton proposed two possibilities: an aerodynamic counterbalance and a muscle attachment point. He suggested that the crest might have anchored large, long jaw muscles, but admitted that this function <b>alone</b> <b>could</b> not explain the large size of some crests. Bennett (1992) agreed with Eaton's own assessment that the crest was too large and variable {{to have been a}} muscle attachment site. Eaton had suggested that a secondary function of the crest might have been as a counterbalance against the long beak, reducing the need for heavy neck muscles to control the orientation of the head. Wind tunnel tests showed that the crest did function as an effective counterbalance to a degree, but Bennett noted that again, the hypothesis focuses only on the long crests of male P. longiceps, not on the larger crests of P. sternbergi and very small crests that existed among the females. Bennett found that the crests of females had no counterbalancing effect, and that the crests of male P. sternbergi would, by themselves, {{have a negative effect on}} the balance of the head. In fact, side to side movement of the crests would have required more, not less, neck musculature to control balance.|$|E

5|$|The story {{followed}} an unnamed warrior {{who became the}} player's character in the multiplayer mode. The warrior {{was a native of}} Kirra whose father was killed by a cruel general who poisoned the water supply of the village, killing many people. Before dying, the warrior's father beckoned him to honor the gods and swear to never let harm come to their family. The warrior swore his father's oath and was met by a cloaked figure, The Giver, who guided him and followed him throughout his journey. Soon after, the warrior called upon Ares to save his people from the poisonous water; the god destroyed the aqueduct and water wheel that supplied water to the village. The warrior then encountered the surviving soldiers who had been under his father's command. One soldier told the warrior that swords <b>alone</b> <b>could</b> not defeat the general. The warrior and his men traveled to the land of Aeaea and recruited the witch Circe, who seemingly also sought revenge against the general. Circe granted the soldiers magical weapons to aid them on their journey, and suggested that they see the Oracle of Delphi to discover whether the general had any weaknesses. During this time, the warrior vowed loyalty to Poseidon and to protect his men.|$|E
5|$|The {{experience}} held {{a number}} of lessons for the Australians, not least {{of all was the}} need for tanks. Although the APCs had been used to support the infantry during the operation, they lacked the firepower and armour to be an effective substitute for tanks which would likely have found the terrain and vegetation no obstacle and may have proven decisive. Meanwhile, the futility and waste of frontal tactics and massed bayonet charges against automatic weapons had once again been demonstrated. Yet such lessons still had not been fully grasped by Australian Army training doctrine, and under pressure from Townsend to press on with the attack Mackay had given the order to fix bayonets and charge due to the proximity of his forward platoons to the Viet Cong. Despite having long since ceased to be a decisive weapon of warfare, when ordered the Australians had unhesitatingly charged towards the Viet Cong machine-guns in the certainty of suffering casualties. As a result of their bravery 5 Platoon {{became one of the most}} highly decorated Australian platoons of the war. Yet aggression <b>alone</b> <b>could</b> not overcome concentrated firepower, and many survivors were later bitter about the order and losses suffered in these attempts. Another lesson identified included the need to thoroughly prepare an unsecure landing zone by fire prior to insertion. Likewise, during the initial contact A Company had been unable to call in artillery, and the need for a dedicated command and control helicopter to co-ordinate indirect fire during an airmobile assault was also evident.|$|E
