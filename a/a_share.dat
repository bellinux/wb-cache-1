Instead, Ahearn bought Gorman's interest in the club for $35,000 and <b>a</b> <b>share</b> of the Connaught Park Racetrack and Gorman moved on to New York to manage the New York Americans.

40|$|In China, {{domestic}} {{firms can}} issue <b>A</b> and B <b>shares.</b> Domestic investors can only invest <b>A</b> <b>shares</b> while foreign investors can only hold B shares.

Consistent with our hypothesis, empirical evidence indicates that cross-sectional variation of the premia of <b>A</b> <b>shares</b> is negatively related to the relative supply of <b>A</b> <b>shares,</b> and positively related to the relative of B shares. We also find that shares in circulation (effective supply of <b>shares)</b> is <b>a</b> better proxy than the total shares outstanding (total supply of stocks) in explaining the premia.
