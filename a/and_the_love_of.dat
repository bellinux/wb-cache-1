5|$|During both episodes, Michael and Pam {{visit the}} various {{branches}} of Dunder Mifflin to make business lectures, {{and in particular}} visit the Utica branch – where Jim's ex-girlfriend Karen Filippelli is regional manager, and the Nashua branch, where Michael's ex-girlfriend <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>love</b> <b>of</b> his life, Holly is an H.R. rep. In both episodes, Jim and Dwight hit a snag as the new heads of the Party Planning Committee when they forget Kelly's birthday. In the first episode, Andy develops a crush on a customer, {{and in the second}} episode, Angela's unhealthy obsession with her cats is spotlighted when she installs a nanny cam.|$|E
5|$|The key {{themes of}} the early Quranic verses {{included}} the responsibility of man towards his creator; {{the resurrection of the}} dead, God's final judgment followed by vivid descriptions of the tortures in Hell and pleasures in Paradise, and the signs of God in all aspects of life. Religious duties required of the believers at this time were few: belief in God, asking for forgiveness of sins, offering frequent prayers, assisting others particularly those in need, rejecting cheating <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>love</b> <b>of</b> wealth (considered to be significant in the commercial life of Mecca), being chaste and not killing newborn girls.|$|E
5|$|In short, had Mr. Boulton {{done nothing}} {{more in the}} world than he has {{accomplished}} in improving the coinage, his name would deserve to be immortalised; and if it be considered that this was done in the midst of various other important avocations, and at enormous expense,— for which, at the time, he could have had no certainty of an adequate return,—we shall be at a loss whether most to admire his ingenuity, his perseverance, or his munificence. He has conducted the whole more like a sovereign than a private manufacturer; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>love</b> <b>of</b> fame has always been to him a greater stimulus than the love of gain. Yet it is to be hoped that, even in the latter point of view, the enterprise answered its purpose.|$|E

25|$|Swedenborg {{experienced}} {{many different}} dreams and visions, some greatly pleasurable, others highly disturbing. The experiences continued as {{he traveled to}} London to progress the publication of Regnum animale. This process, which one biographer has proposed as cathartic and comparable to the Catholic concept of Purgatory, continued for six months. He also proposed that what Swedenborg was recording in his Journal of Dreams was a battle between the love of himself <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>love</b> <b>of</b> God.|$|E
25|$|Guysborough County, Nova Scotia {{has many}} rural Irish villages.

25|$|From {{these results}} {{we see that}} Shaftesbury, opposed to Hobbes and Locke, is in close {{agreement}} with Hutcheson, and that he is ultimately a deeply religious thinker, inasmuch as he discards the moral sanction of public opinion, the terrors of future punishment, and the authority of the civil authority as the main incentives to goodness, and substitutes the voice of conscience <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>love</b> <b>of</b> God. These two alone move men to aim at perfect harmony for its own sake in the man and in the universe.|$|E
25|$|In 1985, he {{conducted}} {{a recording of}} West Side Story, {{the first time he}} had conducted the entire work. The recording, featuring what some critics felt were miscast opera singers such as Kiri Te Kanawa, José Carreras, and Tatiana Troyanos in the leading roles, was nevertheless an international bestseller. A TV documentary showing the making of the recording was made at the same time and is available on DVD. Bernstein also continued to make his own TV documentaries during the 1980s, including The Little Drummer Boy, in which he discussed the music of Gustav Mahler, perhaps the composer he was most passionately interested in, <b>and</b> <b>The</b> <b>Love</b> <b>of</b> Three Orchestras, in which he discussed his work in New York, Vienna, and Israel.|$|E

500|$|Building on that theme, E. P. Clowney {{explained}} that three dimensions of Christian meditation are crucial, not merely for showing its distinctiveness, but for guiding its practice. The {{first is that}} Christian meditation {{is grounded in the}} Bible. Because the God of the Bible is a personal God who speaks in words of revelation, Christian meditation responds to this revelation and focuses on that aspect, in contrast to mystic meditations which use mantras. The second distinctive mark of Christian meditation is that it responds to the love of God, as in I John : [...] "We love, for he first loved us". The personal relationship based on the love of God that marks Christian communion is thus heightened in Christian meditation. The third dimension is that the revelations of the Bible <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>love</b> <b>of</b> God lead to the worship of God: making Christian meditation an exercise in praise.|$|E
500|$|Though Elizabeth {{followed}} a largely defensive foreign policy, her reign raised England's status abroad. [...] "She {{is only a}} woman, only mistress of half an island," [...] marvelled Pope Sixtus V, [...] "and yet she makes herself feared by Spain, by France, by the Empire, by all". Under Elizabeth, the nation gained a new self-confidence and sense of sovereignty, as Christendom fragmented. Elizabeth was the first Tudor to recognise that a monarch ruled by popular consent. She therefore always worked with parliament and advisers she could trust {{to tell her the}} truth—a style of government that her Stuart successors failed to follow. Some historians have called her lucky; she believed that God was protecting her. Priding herself on being [...] "mere English", Elizabeth trusted in God, honest advice, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>love</b> <b>of</b> her subjects for the success of her rule. In a prayer, she offered thanks to God that: ...|$|E
500|$|The album's {{subsequent}} songs {{focus on}} separation, with lyrics written in past tense. [...] "Unfold" [...] comprises individual notes and pauses, and incorporates tension in its off-beat composition, while its percussion increases in tempo before the accompanying instrumentation follows suit. It features deep house beats, resounding guitar harmonics, rhythmic hi-hat, and a dominant breakbeat. Croft describes [...] "Unfold" [...] as a [...] "gentle reverie" [...] and [...] "quite an emotional one." [...] On [...] "Swept Away", she and Sim express fragile declarations of love. They originally wrote the song as a ballad before Smith reworked {{it with a}} Roland TR-909 drum machine. [...] "Our Song" [...] features a rewinding guitar sample, looped feedback, and pulsating percussion buildup. It is about the love shared in a friendship; Croft and Sim wrote it to address {{each other and the}} band itself: [...] "We've never done that before; we're always addressing the songs outward. It's about the function of love <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>love</b> <b>of</b> friends. It's important." ...|$|E
5000|$|According to Graham Seaman, [...] "The Roots of the Mountains {{seems to}} be the story that {{inspired}} the subplot of the Dunedain, wanderers of a fading heroic past defending the frontiers of the Shire against <b>the</b> Orcs, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>loves</b> <b>of</b> Aragorn, Eowyn, Faramir, and Arwen in Tolkien's Lord of the Rings." ...|$|R

500|$|Reyes {{said that}} the album was written solely for [...] "fun <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>love</b> <b>of</b> music, no expectations." [...] Their lyrics were {{inspired}} by personal experience. Nolan and Lazzara had a concept {{where some of the}} lyrics could be read [...] "like a play where one line is the boy and the next line is the girl ... Sometimes when you read the lyrics it's a little boring and it's more interesting this way". About half their song titles, according to Nolan, came from [...] "sitting around late at night watching TV". The title of [...] "Cute Without the 'E' (Cut from the Team)" [...] came when a friend of the band said that someone he knew was [...] "cut from the team". [...] "Great Romances of the 20th Century" [...] includes an audio sample from the film, Beautiful Girls (1996). Lazzara said [...] "The Blue Channel" [...] and [...] "Head Club" [...] were songs that the band used [...] "to get enough songs to fill a record so we could go on tour". The album's sound would later be described as emo. Around this time, Taking Back Sunday was influenced by emo bands the Get Up Kids and the Promise Ring.|$|E
500|$|The Great Silence {{has been}} {{interpreted}} by various film critics and historians as a subversion of various conventions of the Western film genre. Corbucci, a left-wing radical who made his political views either the subtext or subject of several of his films, wrote the film's story as an allegory highlighting the corruptions stemming from authoritarian forms of capitalism, which are personified by the sadistic, greedy bounty killers led by Loco (who use the bounties to fuel their desires for violence and money while acting under the law), {{as well as the}} schemes of the banker Pollicutt. This is partially in line with the [...] "Classical Plot" [...] of both American Westerns (such as Shane) and certain Spaghetti Westerns (such as A Fistful of Dollars), in which, according to Will Wright, a [...] "lone stranger rides into a troubled town and cleans it up, winning the respect of the townsfolk <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>love</b> <b>of</b> the schoolmarm." [...] As a result of his sympathetic portrayal of the outlaws and the demoniac characterization of the people who hunt them, Corbucci's presentation of bounty killers is far more negative than such figures in Sergio Leone's films – the closing title card of The Great Silence contrasts with the opening title card of For a Few Dollars More.|$|E
