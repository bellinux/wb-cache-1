50|$|The cupola tender {{observes the}} furnace through the sight glass or peep {{sight in the}} tuyeres. Slag will {{rise to the top}} of the pool of iron being formed. A slag hole, located higher up on the {{cylinder}} of the furnace, and usually to the rear or side of the tap hole, is opened to let the slag flow out. The viscosity is low (with proper fluxing) and the red hot molten slag will flow easily. Sometimes the slag which runs out the slag hole is collected in a small cup shaped tool, allowed to cool and harden. It is fractured and visually examined. With <b>acid</b> <b>refractory</b> lined cupolas a greenish colored slag means the fluxing is proper and adequate. In basic refractory lined cupolas the slag is brown.|$|E
40|$|Clinoptilolite is {{a natural}} zeolite used for the {{abatement}} of ammonium {{in the treatment of}} urban wastewater. By considering that mullite was obtained through thermal treatment of NH 4 -exchanged synthetic zeolites, this work aimed to evaluate if this phase can be obtained from NH 4 -clinoptilolite. A material containing about 90 wt % of clinoptilolite, prepared using a Sardinian zeolite-rich rock, was NH 4 -exchanged and subjected to treatments up to 1200 °C. After dehydration, de-ammoniation, and dehydroxylation processes, the clinoptilolite structure collapsed at 600 °C. An association of mullite, silica polymorphs, and glass, whitish in color, was obtained for treatments between 1000 and 1200 °C. The higher degree of crystallinity was reached after a 32 h heating at 1100 °C: mullite 22 wt %, cristobalite 59 wt %, tridymite 10 wt %, glass 9 wt %. It is possible to speed up the kinetics of the transformation by increasing the temperature to 1200 °C, obtaining the same amount of mullite in 2 h, but increasing the residual amorphous fraction (16 wt %). These results indicate that NH 4 -clinoptilolite could represent a raw material of potential interest in the ceramic field, in particular in the production of <b>acid</b> <b>refractory,</b> opening scenarios for a possible reuse of clinoptilolite-based exchangers employed in ammonium decontamination...|$|E
40|$|Tranexamic acid is {{generally}} {{used in the}} treatment of disorders that predispose one to bleeding. It is a synthetic lysine analog that has strong antifibrinolytic activity. Plasminogen binds to fibrin to form plasmin, which in turn degrades fibrin into fibrin degradation products. Tranexamic acid blocks the lysine binding site on plasminogen and prevents interaction with fibrin. Tranexamic acid reduces blood loss in open heart surgery, hip replacement, and gynecology procedures. In this first case of inadvertent intrathecal injection of Tranexamic acid in a pregnant woman, we found that a massive intrathecal injection of Tranexamic <b>acid</b> triggered <b>refractory</b> ventricular fibrillation and cardiovascular collapse, which did not respond to full resuscitation...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{analyzed}} the determinants and the structural {{effects of the}} interaction of human prion protein fragment 90 - 231 (HuPrP) with humic substances, (HS) including humic (HA) and fulvic (FA) <b>acids,</b> natural <b>refractory</b> organic polyanions widely diffused in soils and waters. We show that this interaction is mainly driven by non-specific electrostatic attraction involving regions situated within α-helix A and β-sheet S 1 of human PrP. FA binding to HuPrP altered its ability to acquire some PrPSc-like characteristics induced by the mild thermal denaturation of the peptide (1 h at 53 °C). In particular, {{in the presence of}} FA, HuPrP shows a reduced amount of β-sheet content (as demonstrated by the reduced binding of thioflavin T), an increased sensitivity to protease K and an inhibition of the entering in the fibrillogenic pathway. FA/HuPrP interaction caused the aggregation of the peptide in unstructured macrocomplexes, as demonstrated by the altered electrophoretic migration in semi-denaturing detergent-agarose gel assay. Importantly, in the presence of FA the rate of internalization of HuPrP in human neuroblastoma cells was significantly reduced as compared to that of the β-structured peptide. Therefore, HS inhibited the acquisition of PrP Sc-like structural properties that, in turn, are responsible for HuPrP intracellular accumulation and lead to neuronal death. Important implications of these data are that HuPrP-HS complexes, being unable to be internalized in living cells may represent a molecular mechanism for the reduced transmission of prion transmission from HS-rich soil also in the presence of contamination from infected animals.

40|$|Abstract: The {{study on}} the physio-mechanical {{behavior}} of aluminum dross has been carried out. The amount of aluminum dross used varied between 50 and 90 wt %, while bentonite added to the dross varied from 10 - 50 wt % with a fixed amount of water. Using dross particle sizes of 106 µm and 184 µm, 10 samples are produced from each particle size. The bricks are dried in still air for 24 hrs at 31 o C, oven drying at 110 ºC for 24 hrs and sintered at 450 ºC for 8 hrs. The bricks characteristics {{in terms of volume}} shrinkage, apparent porosity, bulk density, cold crush strengths and permeability are then evaluated. The results show that the 106 µm particle size dross brick has the highest volume shrinkage of 24 %, apparent porosity of 15 % and peak bulk density of 1. 9 g/c. c. However, the dross brick exhibits relatively low cold crush strength of 940 KN/m. The 106 µm size bricks demonstrate a minimum of 85 % permeability compared with 70 wt % of 184 µm bricks which may be due to variation in dross particles agglomeration. Given these results, the 106 µm particle size brick can serve as <b>acid</b> <b>refractory</b> because its properties compared well with medium-alumina fireclay...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Several {{pathogens}} could seriously affect {{public health}} if not recognized timely. To reduce {{the impact of}} such highly pathogenic micro-organisms, rapid and accurate diagnostic tools are needed for their detection in various samples, including environmental samples. Results Multiplex real-time PCRs were designed for rapid and reliable detection of three major pathogens that {{have the potential to}} cause high morbidity and mortality in humans: B. anthracis, F. tularensis and Y. pestis. The developed assays detect three pathogen-specific targets, including at least one chromosomal target, and one target from B. thuringiensis which is used as an internal control for nucleic <b>acid</b> extraction from <b>refractory</b> spores as well as successful DNA amplification. Validation of the PCRs showed a high analytical sensitivity, specificity and coverage of diverse pathogen strains. Conclusions The multiplex qPCR assays that were developed allow the rapid detection of 3 pathogen-specific targets simultaneously, without compromising sensitivity. The application of B. thuringiensis spores as internal controls further reduces false negative results. This ensures highly reliable detection, while template consumption and laboratory effort are kept at a minimum</p...|$|R
40|$|International audienceOrganosulfates have {{recently}} {{come into the}} focus of organic aerosol research as potentially important components of water-soluble secondary organic aerosol (SOA) which now dominate tropospheric fine aerosol. Their presence has been confirmed by the identification of sulfate esters of abundant biogenic carbonyl compounds in both smog chamber and continental aerosol. However, none of the studies {{have been able to}} determine the mass contribution of organosulfates to SOA. In this paper, as possibly the very first attempt to quantify organosulfates in ambient aerosol, we inferred the mass concentrations of organosulfates by concurrently determining mass concentrations of total sulfur, sulfate and methanesulfonate in rural fine aerosol using two highly sensitive analytical techniques. Although uncertainties were relatively large, we found that mass concentrations of organosulfates in water-soluble fine aerosol ranged from 0. 02 ?gS m ? 3 to 0. 09 ?gS m ? 3 yielding a mass contribution of 6 ? 12 % to bulk sulfur concentrations (or 6 ? 14 % to sulfate concentrations). The inferred size distribution of organosulfates suggested that they possibly form in heterogeneous reactions from semi-volatile carbonyl compounds with subsequent or concurrent condensation of gaseous sulfuric <b>acid</b> producing a <b>refractory</b> organic film on particle surfaces...|$|R
40|$|Land plant {{biomarkers}} {{have been}} frequently found as free compounds in ancient sediments and plant fossils, {{and can be}} useful as chemotaxonomic marker. However, such free biomarkers account for {{only a small fraction}} in plant organic fossil. The most part of plant fossil consists of refractory macromolecule, which is non-extractable with organic solvent, <b>acid,</b> and alkali. <b>Refractory</b> macromolecule survives decay more readily than free biomarker during diagenesis. Major sources of refractory macromolecules are thought to be plant biomacromolecule that were selectively in situ preserved. Refractory macromolecular and biomarker analyses were carried out for woody fossil fragments in Cretaceous sandstones of Oyubari area, central Hokkaido, in order to evaluate chemical state of organic molecules within the fossil and to obtain chemotaxonomic information from refractory macromolecule. Fine to medium sandstones were collected from the outcrops of the Okusakainosawa sandstone and mudstone member of the Cretaceous (Albian) Shuparogawa Formation (Yezo Group), Tengunosawa of Oyubari area. The Shuparogawa Formation abundantly contained woody and coaly fossil fragments (Takashima et al., 2004). Several larger fragments of woody macro fossil in rock samples were individually picked out.

40|$|Abstract. Marine agglomerates were {{collected}} by SCUBA from surface waters of Monterey Bay, Califor-nia and one coastal site 100 km off Point Sur, California using trace metal clean techniques. Concentrations of Al, Fe, Mn, Cu, Ni, Zn, Cd and Pb were measured for both weak <b>acid</b> soluble and <b>refractory</b> metals and compared to suspend material collected in water bottles at the same locations. Gravimetric analysis of agglomerate and surrounding suspended particulate matter indicated that although agglomerates represented 40 % dry weight), {{with most of the}} associated metals contained primarily within the refractory fraction. In con-trast, the offshore station agglomerates contained < 0. 3 % inorganic material with metals primarily associated with the weak acid soluble fraction. Both the metal concentrations and leach characteristics of the offshore station suggest that these agglomerates were comprised of an active phytoplankton assemblage highly enriched in Cd. Metal concentrations in the offshore samples in conjunction with agglomerate abundance indicate that agglomerates may be a major transporter of trace metals out of the euphotic zone.

40|$|The use of near {{real-time}} optical techniques {{is emphasized}} for {{the measurement of}} mid-tropospheric aerosol over the Central Pacific. The primary focus is on measurement of the aerosol size distribution over the range of particle diameters from 0. 15 to 5. 0 microns that are essential for modeling CO 2 backscatter values {{in support of the}} laser atmospheric wind sounder (LAWS) program. The measurement system employs a LAS-X (Laser Aerosol Spectrometer-PMS, Boulder, CO) with a custom 256 channel pulse height analyzer and software for detailed measurement and analysis of aerosol size distributions. A thermal preheater system (Thermo Optic Aerosol Descriminator (TOAD) conditions the aerosol in a manner that allows the discrimination of the size distribution of individual aerosol components such as sulfuric <b>acid,</b> sulfates and <b>refractory</b> species. This allows assessment of the relative contribution of each component to the BCO 2 signal. This is necessary since the different components have different sources, exhibit independent variability and provide different BCO 2 signals for a given mass and particle size. Field activities involve experiments designed to examine both temporal and spatial variability of these aerosol components from ground based and aircraft platforms...|$|R
40|$|G protein-mediated signal {{transduction}} {{is dependent on}} alpha subunit interactions with βy subunits, receptors, effectors, magnesium ions, and guanine nucleotides. The interdependence of these interactions can be probed by mutational analysis. We developed large scale screening procedures in recombinant Escherichia coli to identify and characterize novel mutations in Goα. Random mutations were generated by polymerase chain reaction in the amino-terminal 56 amino acids of Goα. Guanine nucleotide binding properties of the mutants were assayed in situ and in crude extracts of recombinant E. coli. βy interactions were assayed by pertussis toxin mediated ADP-ribosylation. Efficacy of the screening procedures was evaluated by studying properties of wild-type Goα and site-directed mutations that were characterized previously in other G proteins. Several novel mutants with altered GTP binding characteristics and reduced ability to interact with beta gamma had been isolated from the randomly generated mutant library. ADP-ribosylation of mutants R 10 G, K 21 N, and K 35 E was significantly reduced, whereas two of the mutants bearing multiple amino <b>acid</b> substitutions were <b>refractory</b> to modification. Mutant K 35 E also exhibited reduced affinity to guanosine 5 '-(3 -O-thio) triphosphate at submicromolar concentrations of magnesium. These experiments demonstrate the feasibility of using large scale random mutagenesis in the studies of G protein function...|$|R
40|$|A key aspect in {{overcoming}} {{the energy and}} environmental challenges {{is to improve the}} efficiency of existing and new processes. Nowadays, almost all major chemicals are produced by catalytic processes. However, {{a better understanding of the}} reaction pathways and kinetics is needed. In the field of wastewater treatment, catalytic ozonation is a typical example of this problem. In this study, catalytic microreactors were used as innovative analytical tools for the determination of kinetics of catalytic ozonation and were elaborated by using low pressure plasma processes for the deposition and activation of iron and oxide-based catalysts on polymer-based materials. Catalytic ozonation with pyruvic <b>acid</b> as a <b>refractory</b> probe compound was performed with both catalysts. HPLC measurements showed the inactivity of the iron oxide layer compared to the cobalt oxide one which led to 20 % of degradation. The effect was doubled when the latter was post-treated by an argon plasma, demonstrating the role and importance of the plasma post-treatment step. A numerical study dealing with the reactions taking place on the surface of the catalyst was carried out using the Comsol Multiphysics software and showed that the model partially fitted the experimental data due to the lack of information. However, access to the reactions rate constants of the intermediate species generated during the catalytic ozonation step could be achieved through the use of the Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Spectroscopy technique and would lead to an efficient tool to predict the relevance and the direction of future improvement strategies regarding catalyzed chemical reactions...|$|R
40|$|Acrylic <b>acid</b> is a <b>refractory</b> {{compound}} for the non-catalytic {{wet oxidation}} (WO) process and can seriously damage the environment when released in industrial effluents. Oxidation of acrylic acid by catalytic wet oxidation (CWO) was studied in slurry conditions in a high-pressure batch reactor at 200  °C and 15  bar of oxygen partial pressure. Several solid cerium-based catalysts prepared in our laboratory were used (Ag/Ce, Co/Ce, Mn/Ce, CeO, MnO) and evaluated {{in terms of}} activity, selectivity and stability. Mn/Ce shows the higher activity in 2  h with 97. 7 % reduction of total organic carbon (TOC) followed by: MnO(95. 5 %) >Ag/Ce(85. 0 %) >Co/Ce(65. 1 %) >CeO(61. 2 %). Attempts were also carried out to analyze the influence of different Mn/Ce molar ratios. High percentages of Mn lead to practically total organic carbon concentration (TOC) abatements while low ratios lead {{to the formation of}} non-oxidizable compounds. Acrylic acid was readily degraded by all the catalysts pointing out the high importance of using a catalytic process. pH was an indicator of the reaction pathway and acetic acid was found as the major reaction intermediate compound; however it is completely oxidized after 2  h with exception for Co/Ce, CeO and MnO. Carbon adsorption and leaching of metals were poorly found for Mn/Ce indicating high stability. The catalyst microstructure after the reaction was analyzed and formation of whiskers of [beta]-MnO 2 (or less probably MnOOH) were observed at the catalyst surface. Therefore, Mn/Ce revealed to be a promising catalyst for the treatment of effluents containing acrylic acid; nevertheless, its commercialization depends on further research. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|We studied {{patterns}} {{of production and}} loss of four different extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) fractions - colloidal carbohydrates, colloidal EPS (cEPS), hot water (HW) -extracted and hot bicarbonate (HB) -extracted fractions - and community profiles of active (RNA) bacterial communities by use of Terminal-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction amplified 16 S rRNA in mudflats in the Colne Estuary, United Kingdom, over two tidal emersion-immersion cycles. Colloidal carbohydrates and intracellular storage carbohydrate (HW) increased during tidal emersion and declined during tidal cover. The dynamics of cEPS and uronic acid content were closely coupled, as were the HB fraction and HB uronic acids. Changes in monosaccharide profiles of HW and HB fractions occurred during the diel period, with some similarity between cEPS and HB fractions. Increasing enzymatic release rates of reducing sugars and increased reducing sugar content were correlated with increased concentrations of colloidal carbohydrate and cEPS during the illuminated emersion period, and {{with the amount of}} HB-extracted uronic <b>acids</b> (the most <b>refractory</b> EPS fraction measured). Loss of reducing sugars was high, with sediment concentrations far below those predicted by the measured in situ release rates, T-RFLP analysis revealed no significant shifts in the overall taxonomic composition of the active bacterial community. However, 12 of the 59 terminal restriction fragments identified showed significant changes in relative abundance during the tidal cycle. Changes in the relative abundance of three particular terminal restriction fragments (bacterial taxa) were positively correlated to the rate of extracellular hydrolysis. Losses of chlorophyll a and colloidal and cEPS (up to 50 - 60) occurred mainly in the first 30 min after tidal cover. About half of this may be owing to in situ degradation, with "wash away" into the water column accounting for the remainder.
