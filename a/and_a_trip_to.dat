5|$|The Virginia Tech Hokies {{entered the}} 1995 season after having {{finished}} with an 84 overall record in 1994. That season culminated with a 4523 loss to Tennessee in the 1994 Gator Bowl. Heading into the 1995 season, fans and coaches expected Tech {{to improve on}} its previous performance. Most commentators, however, expected a season comparable to 1994's: a second-place finish in the Big East <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>trip</b> <b>to</b> the Gator Bowl. This was {{borne out by the}} preseason college football polls. The AP Poll put Tech 24th, while the coaches' poll had Tech 26th.|$|E
5|$|The ship's career {{spanned the}} globe, and {{ranged from a}} {{deployment}} to China to help suppress the Boxer Rebellion in 1899–1901, to tours in the Americas throughout the 1900s, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>trip</b> <b>to</b> Australia in 1905. During the Italo-Turkish War, she {{was transferred to the}} Red Sea, where she bombarded Ottoman troops and ports and helped to enforce a blockade before returning to Italy in April 1912 for a refit. The ship continued to serve in the Red Sea during World War I and as a result, did not see action. She was reclassified as a gunboat in 1921 and then a training ship in early 1924, before being sold for scrap in November 1924.|$|E
5|$|Notre Dame was {{the last}} out-of-conference {{opponent}} on Boston College's schedule, as the Eagles finished the season with three consecutive ACC games. The first of these was against Florida State which led the Atlantic Division at the time, but had had five players suspended {{the day before the}} game. The Eagles secured a victory, 27–17. The second of Boston College's final opponents was Wake Forest, which had played in the 2006 ACC Championship Game. While Boston College won, 24–21, starting quarterback Chris Crane suffered a season-ending injury, leaving backup Dominique Davis in charge of the Eagles' offense. Boston College's final game of the regular season was against Maryland and a victory against the Terrapins would push the Eagles to a tie with Florida State atop the Atlantic Division. Since Boston College had won the head-to-head game against Florida State, according to the ACC's tie-breaking rules, the Eagles would win the division. A 28–21 victory over Maryland brought Boston College to a 5–3 ACC record, giving it a co-division championship with Florida State <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>trip</b> <b>to</b> the ACC Championship Game.|$|E

5|$|SMS Custoza was an ironclad warship {{built for}} the Austro-Hungarian Navy in the 1870s, {{the only member of}} her class. She was the first Austro-Hungarian ironclad to be built after the navy studied the results of the Battle of Lissa of 1866; she was also the first iron-hulled capital ship to be {{built for the}} Austro-Hungarian Navy. She was laid down in November 1869, {{launched}} in August 1872, and completed in February 1875. Her career was fairly limited, in part due to reduced naval budgets in the 1870s that also delayed her completion. Custoza was somewhat more active in the 1880s, taking part in an international naval demonstration against the Ottoman Empire in 1880, being modernized in 1882, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>trip</b> <b>to</b> Spain for the Barcelona Universal Exposition in 1888. The ship became a training ship in 1902, was converted into a barracks ship in 1914, and after World War I, was awarded as a war prize to Italy. Custoza was immediately broken up.|$|E
5|$|That {{was good}} for {{first place in the}} AFC Central <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>trip</b> <b>to</b> the postseason {{for the first time since}} 1972. The Browns began their playoff run against the Oakland Raiders on January 4, 1981 in a bitterly cold Cleveland Municipal Stadium. The game started slowly: each team scored only a {{touchdown}} in the first half, although Cockroft missed Cleveland's extra point because of a bad snap. In the third quarter, Cleveland went ahead 12–7 on a pair of Cockroft field goals, but the Raiders came back in the final period, driving 80yards down the field for a touchdown. That put Oakland ahead 14–12. The ball changed hands five times with no scoring from either side, and with 2:22 on the clock, Cleveland had a final shot to win the game. Sipe and the offense took over at the Browns' 15-yard line. In eight plays, Cleveland drove down to Oakland's 14, leaving 56 seconds on the clock.|$|E
5|$|The Eastern Conference Final began {{between the}} Penguins and the Philadelphia Flyers on May 9. Malkin scored with 7seconds {{left in the}} first period to take a 3–2 lead, and {{extended}} the advantage with a shorthanded goal in the second period, giving the Penguins a 1–0 advantage in the series after Game 1. In Game 2, Talbot scored {{to take the lead in}} the third period, and Staal added an empty-net goal to give the Penguins a 4–2 win and a 2–0 series lead. The win was the Penguins' seventh consecutive home playoff win, a franchise record, improving on a six-game streak in the 1992 playoffs. The Penguins also became only the fifth team to start the playoffs with a 10–1 record, and the first since the Detroit Red Wings in 1995. Game 3 saw the series move across state to Philadelphia; the Penguins struck quickly with goals from Ryan Whitney and Hossa within the first eight minutes. Hossa added his second goal on an empty net to seal the victory. With the win, the Penguins become the first team since the 1983 Edmonton Oilers to start the playoffs 11–1. The Penguins failed to close out the Eastern Conference Finals with a sweep of the Flyers in Game 4, losing 4–2. The Flyers jumped out to a 3–0 lead in the first period. The Penguins fought back getting two goals from Jordan Staal in the third period, but Joffrey Lupul's second goal on an empty net sealed the win for the Flyers. The series returned to Pittsburgh for Game 5, where the Penguins won their eighth consecutive home game by a final score of 6–0, the Prince of Wales Trophy, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>trip</b> <b>to</b> the Stanley Cup Final.|$|E

25|$|Brown's {{second head}} {{coaching}} position came with Tulane in 1985, {{where he also}} became the school's athletic director {{in the wake of}} a point shaving scandal which led to the shutdown of the men's basketball program. Despite a slow start (a 1–10 record in his first year), he made gradual improvement, leading the Green Wave to a 4–7 record in 1986 and, in 1987, to a 6–6 record <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>trip</b> <b>to</b> the Independence Bowl, Tulane's fifth bowl game in over 40 years.|$|E

During dinner, Crosby never spoke to the girl on his left, breaking decorum. By some accounts, Crosby {{fell in love with the}} buxom Mrs. Peabody in about two hours, confessing his love for her in the Tunnel of Love at the amusement park. Two weeks later they went to church together in Manchester-by-the-Sea and spent the night together. Their public relationship was a scandal among blue-blood Boston.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fifth}} {{game of the}} series, the Dodgers jumped on top early with a {{home run in the}} second by Enrique Hernandez. He added two more home runs later in the game, {{including}} a grand slam. He became only the fourth Dodger to hit a post-season grandslam (joining Ron Cey and Dusty Baker from the 1981 NLCS and James Loney in the 2008 NLDS). His seven RBI in the game also set a NLCS record. The Dodgers cruised to an 11–1 win <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>trip</b> <b>to</b> their first World Series since 1988. Chris Taylor and Justin Turner were voted co-MVPs of the series. The Dodgers bullpen set a record with 23 consecutive scoreless innings in the post-season from game two of the NLDS through the completion of the NLCS.|$|E
25|$|Another {{milestone}} {{was reached}} in the following year, when Stanford won the Pac-10 regular season, the first (of many) conference championships. They earned a two seed in the NCAA tournament, and played to their seed, losing to Louisiana Tech in the Midwest Regional Final. The pieces came together in 1990, with one key being Jennifer Azzi. The 1990 Final Four would be held in Knoxville, Tennessee. Azzi was from Oak Ridge, not far from Knoxville. VanDerveer had traveled to Knoxville in 1985, {{to try to persuade}} this potential star to play for Stanford. Azzi made the decision to go to Stanford, and now, four years later, brought the team to her parents house after beating Arkansas in the West Regional, reaching their first Final Four <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>trip</b> <b>to</b> Knoxville.|$|E

25|$|Tom Nugent's Terps entered {{their last}} season game boasting a 7–2 record that {{included}} a win over seventh-ranked Syracuse with Heisman Trophy-winner Ernie Davis and the only victory over Penn State until 2014. They faced a Virginia team that started off their season by breaking a three-year, 28-game losing streak against William & Mary. The Cavaliers had lost the last three meetings against Maryland {{by an average of}} 38 points. With a win against Virginia, the Terps would secure the ACC title <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>trip</b> <b>to</b> the Gator Bowl. After Maryland scored for an early lead, Virginia quarterback Gary Cuozzo tossed three short touchdown passes to third-string receiver John Hepler. Defensive back Ted Rzempoluch returned an interception 95 yards for a touchdown, and sealed the Terps' fate to go bowl-less. The other three-loss team in the ACC, Duke, won the conference.|$|E
25|$|Memphis was seeded No. 1 in the South Region. Rose earned {{high praise}} for his {{increased}} focus on defense, hounding Texas Longhorn guard D. J. Augustin into a low-percentage {{game in the}} Elite Eight. In a match-up against UCLA in the Final Four, Rose finished with 25 points and 9 rebounds to lead the Tigers to an 85–67 win <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>trip</b> <b>to</b> the NCAA championship game against the Kansas Jayhawks. The win set a NCAA mark for most wins in a season (38). Against Kansas, Rose scored 17 points on 7–of–17 shooting, along with six rebounds and seven assists, but missed a critical free throw {{at the end of}} the second half as Memphis fell in overtime, 75–68. Memphis concluded the season 38–2. Rose was named to the All-Final Four team after averaging 20.8 points, 6.5 rebounds and 6.0 assists per game.|$|E
25|$|The USA {{opened up}} a small five-point lead in {{overtime}} and held a four-point lead with 80 seconds left on the clock but {{they were unable to}} score again in the period. With the game tied Russell secured a rebound, missed a shot when McCall went for the rebound. She was fouled attempting to get the rebound and went to the line with no time left on the clock. She had two shots, either of which would end the game. Unfortunately, she missed both, and the game went to a second overtime. In the second overtime the USA scored early and built the lead to eight points but Japan did not quit, and cut the lead to two points with 10 seconds to go in the game. They were forced to foul; Williams hit two free throws to secure a 102–98 victory <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>trip</b> <b>to</b> the gold-medal game.|$|E

25|$|The Bruins {{swept the}} top seeded Penguins, as Boston goaltender Tuukka Rask {{recorded}} {{his first two}} career playoff shutouts and only allowed two Pittsburgh goals in the entire series. Penguin stars Evgeni Malkin, Sidney Crosby and the newly acquired Jarome Iginla were held to zero combined points during the series. David Krejci had two goals in the Bruins' 3–0 Game 1 victory, the Bruins recorded six goals in a 6–1 rout in Game 2, Patrice Bergeron scored at 15:19 of the second overtime period of Game 3 to give Boston a 2–1 win, and in Game 4, Adam McQuaid scored the lone goal to give the Bruins a 1–0 win <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>trip</b> <b>to</b> the Stanley Cup Finals. This series {{marked the first time}} since 1979 that the Penguins were swept in a playoff series; notably, it was the same Bruins franchise that swept the Penguins that year.|$|E
25|$|The {{alligators}} {{were the}} central attraction and thrived. At {{one time the}} pond contained {{as many as seven}} of the reptiles. Most visitors to the park would rest on the wall surrounding the pond and watch the alligators. The reptiles quickly became a staple of the El Paso Culture. In 1952, an alligator named Oscar was hauled to Texas Western College and, as a prank, placed inside geology Professor Howard Quinn's office. On another occasion an alligator was found in the swimming pool at the college right before an intramural swim meet. Sally, one of the first alligators placed in the pond, was the object of a weight-guessing contest. The closest guess won $100 <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>trip</b> <b>to</b> Mexico. In 1952, Minnie, a 54-year-old female alligator, laid an egg in the pond and spectators were delighted when they saw a protective Minnie spring to life and rush towards her egg as park employees cleaned the pond.|$|E
25|$|After {{six seasons}} in Mamaroneck, the Sportimes {{moved into the}} newly {{constructed}} Sportime Stadium at Randall's Island in New York City for the 2009 season. John McEnroe, Jesse Witten and Ashley Harkleroad (who gave birth {{on the day of}} the draft and was picked in the third round) all returned from the previous season's squad. The Sportimes traded up in the first round of the roster draft sending their pick along with cash consideration to the St. Louis Aces in exchange for the Aces' first round pick which was number 1 overall. The Sportimes used that choice to select Robert Kendrick. Christina Fusano was taken with the Sportimes' final choice. After a one-year absence, Harkleroad's husband Chuck Adams returned to coach the team. Abigail Spears was later signed as a free agent. The Sportimes repeated their 2008 regular-season performance with 10 wins and 4 losses. This time it was enough for first place in the Eastern Conference <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>trip</b> <b>to</b> the Eastern Conference Championship Match.|$|E
