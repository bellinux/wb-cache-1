5|$|Maribor's {{tally of}} 14 Slovenian Championships {{and the total}} of nine Slovenian Cup titles is the highest in Slovenian football. Maribor holds the record for most {{consecutive}} league titles (7), ahead of Olimpija (4) and Gorica (3). They are also the only team {{in the country that}} has achieved the Slovenian Championship and the Slovenian Cup doubles {{on more than one occasion}} (4). In addition, they are the only club who has won the Slovenian version of the treble, having won the league, cup and supercup during the 2012–13 season. On their official website, UEFA states that Maribor has won one international cup, as Maribor was one of the winners of the UEFA Intertoto Cup in 2006. However, the trophy itself was awarded to Newcastle United, the team that advanced farthest in the UEFA competitions that season. Maribor have the best top-flight record in history, having finished below fourth place only once. In addition, they were the first team to win 1,000 points in Slovenian top flight, <b>achieving</b> <b>that</b> with a 2–1 away victory against Rudar Velenje on 26 July 2008.|$|E

25|$|The cattle {{industry}} of the Southwest United States {{has begun to}} cultivate O. ficus-indica as a fresh source of feed for cattle.

The cactus pads are low in dry matter and crude protein, but useful as a supplement in drought conditions. In addition to the food value, the moisture content adequately eliminates watering the cattle and the human effort in <b>achieving</b> <b>that</b> chore.|$|E

25|$|In 1992, {{president}} Dr. Herman James {{oversaw the}} development of Glassboro State College into what would eventually become Rowan University. This transformation came about because of {{what was then the}} largest single gift to a public college or university in history. Industrialist Henry M. Rowan, Jr., a graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology class of 1947, and his wife donated $100 million to the college, which later changed its name to Rowan College of New Jersey in his honor.

According to Greg Kot, the album was [...] "hardly a black power manifesto for world domination, but a statement about racial paranoia. Though he spares virtually no one with his withering raps, Public Enemy's Chuck D is harshest of all on his fellow blacks, expounding on everything from history to fashion: Use your brain instead of a gun. Drugs are death. Know your past so you won't screw up the future. Gold chains worn around the neck demean the brotherhood in South Africa." [...] Kot wrote of Chuck D's perspective and the theme of fear, [...] "It's fear that divides us, he says; understand me better and you won't run. Fear of a Black Planet is about <b>achieving</b> <b>that</b> understanding, but on Public Enemy's terms.

[...] He also compared the A-story to the television series South Park, noting, [...] "It's very clear that South Park benefits from the short turnaround time between production and air, because it allows that show to comment very quickly on current events, and stay timely. Family Guy seems to do the exact opposite, waiting an extraordinarily long time to weigh in on a serious issue it doesn’t satirize for comedy." [...] He ended his review by commenting, [...] "After last week's bright spot, I knew we were headed back down for another helping of the usual misery, but this week offered neither a surprise nor an all-out failure, just expected, bland mediocrity." [...] He graded the episode as a C. In a much more positive review, Terren R. Moore of Ology, writing, [...] "It's just funny, and it's got a lot of ways of <b>achieving</b> <b>that</b> funniness, and it's definitely true that the show isn't always in its best form, but [...] "Thanksgiving" [...] shows that Family Guy refuses to be dead yet." [...] He also praised the episode for giving each character their own part in the episode, adding, [...] "while most of the story revolves around Joe, Kevin, and Peter, the three kids and Brian also get time in as well." [...] Moore also stated his enjoyment of the cultural references in the episode, stating, [...] "It's all good fun, and the cutaways are also top notch, including Peter's First Holiday and The Cowardly Lion as Lindsay Lohan's gynecologist. I nearly fell out when Peter described his probably-black coworker {{who turned out to be}} a white guy, which I should have seen coming because it's very Family Guy, but still managed to get a laugh out of me."
