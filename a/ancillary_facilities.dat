5|$|The {{original}} master plan granted outline planning permission for a 250-bed hotel {{of five to}} six storeys in height. However, property development and investment company The Beetham Organization Ltd, which has in recent years built several high-profile hotels, offices and other buildings in prominent city-centre locations in Britain, bought Block J in November 2004 and submitted a revised planning application (BH2005/00136/FP) early in 2005. This sought approval for a mixed-use development comprising one 42-storey building with 146 residential units (C3-category) and a hotel with <b>ancillary</b> <b>facilities</b> including a restaurant, cafés, conference facilities and a health and fitness centre; one six-storey building with retail units (A1- and A3-category) and a further 25 residential units; and a pedestrianised public square. The application was rejected on 20 separate counts, including the negative visual impact on surrounding listed buildings such as the railway station and St Bartholomew's Church; the reduction in quality of surrounding public spaces; the lack of provision of outdoor recreation space; {{negative effect on the}} surrounding microclimate, and loss of sunlight to nearby buildings; and the failure to consider fully the impact on transport. The reasons for the rejection were supported by various people and groups within the city, such as The Regency Society, which is involved with planning and conservation matters in Brighton and Hove.|$|E
25|$|No. 447 SAM Squadron {{operating}} out of RCAF Station La Macaza, Quebec was activated on 15 September 1962 although warheads were not delivered until late 1963. The squadron followed the same operational procedures as No. 446, its sister squadron. With {{the passage of time}} the operational capability of the 1950s-era Bomarc system no longer met modern requirements; the Department of National Defence deemed that the Bomarc missile defense was no longer a viable system, and ordered both squadrons to be stood down in 1972.

25|$|On 10 June 2008, Kenya Vision 2030 was {{launched}} by President Mwai Kibaki. Under the vision, JKIA's aging infrastructure {{was to be}} upgraded to World Class standards. New Terminals and Runway were to be added in phases. The African Development Bank carried out an Environmental Impact Assessment {{on the development of}} Phase 1 of the proposed Green Field Terminal (GFT) which was expected to increase the capacity of JKIA to about 18.5 million passengers annually by the year 2030. The Greenfield Terminal project was to encompass the construction of a four level terminal building comprising a central processing area, a transit hotel, landside retail centers, arrivals and departures plaza. <b>Ancillary</b> <b>facilities</b> which would have included an access road, car parking, access taxiways, Ground Service Equipment (GSE) and bus parking areas.|$|E
25|$|The fourth {{phase of}} {{construction}} {{will bring the}} Second Avenue line through Chinatown at an undetermined date. However, the tunnel under the Confucius Apartments is not planned to be used; while original plans involved the Second Avenue line running at the same depth of the Sixth Avenue Line at the Grand Street station, that option would {{require the use of}} cut-and-cover construction methods, which would disrupt the community and require the demolition of several nearby structures. Instead the MTA has proposed a deeper tunnel alignment in this area, including a new lower level at Grand Street, to reduce construction impacts on the Chinatown community. As a result, trains will be unable to use this tunnel segment; however, the MTA suggests that the tunnel segment could be used to store <b>ancillary</b> <b>facilities</b> for the subway line, such as a power substation or a ventilation facility.|$|E
25|$|The most {{significant}} of Barry's designs {{that were not}} carried out included, his proposed Law Courts (1840–41), that if built would have covered Lincoln's Inn Fields with a large Greek Revival building, this rectangular building would have been over three hundred by four hundred feet, in a Greek Doric style, {{there would have been}} octastyle porticoes {{in the middle of the}} shorter sides and hexastyle porticoes on the longer sides, leading to a large central hall that would have been surrounded by twelve court rooms that in turn were surrounded by the <b>ancillary</b> <b>facilities.</b> Later was his General Scheme of Metropolitan Improvements, that were exhibited in 1857. This comprehensive scheme was for the redevelopment of much of Whitehall, Horse Guards Parade, the embankment of the River Thames on both sides of the river in the areas to the north and south of the Palace of Westminster, this would eventual be partially realised as the Victoria Embankment and Albert Embankment, three new bridges across the Thames, a vast Hotel where Charing Cross railway station was later built, the enlargement of the National Gallery (Barry's son Edward would later extend the Gallery) and new buildings around Trafalgar Square and along the new embankments and the recently created Victoria Street. There were also several new roads proposed on both sides of the Thames. The largest of the proposed buildings would have been even larger than the Palace of Westminster, this was the Government Offices, this vast building would have covered the area stretching from horse Guards Parade across Downing Street and the sites of the future Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the HM Treasury on Whitehall up to Parliament Square. It would have had a vast glass-roofed hall, 320 by 150 feet, at the centre of the building. The plan was to house all government departments apart from the Admiralty in the building. The building would have been in a Classical style incorporating Barry's existing Treasury building.|$|E

2500|$|The American Civil War was {{followed}} by a boom in railroad construction. [...] of new track were laid across the country between 1868 and 1873. Much of the craze in railroad investment was driven by government land grants and subsidies to the railroads. At that time, the railroad industry was the nation's largest employer outside of agriculture, and it involved large amounts of money and risk. A large infusion of cash from speculators caused abnormal growth in the industry as well as overbuilding of docks, factories and <b>ancillary</b> <b>facilities.</b> At the same time, too much capital was involved in projects offering no immediate or early returns.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAs an {{important}} content of freeway safety management, the freeway infrastructure safety and emergency management system can bring great social effect. In this article, a comprehensive freeway infrastructure safety and emergency management system {{was built by}} following steps: firstly, research significance, research status and the paper framework were illustrated. Secondly, in allusion to five kinds of transportation infrastructure: pavement, bridge, tunnel, side slope and <b>ancillary</b> <b>facility,</b> the existing infrastructure testing indexes were summarized, and the relations between traffic safety and these testing indexes were quantified. Thirdly, according to the different characteristic of five kinds of infrastructures, comprehensive safety evaluation models were proposed in order to evaluate the safety of freeway infrastructure. Fourthly, the system of emergency management and emergency plans were expounded. Finally, the system software was developed {{on the base of}} research about system framework, database system and Web GIS technology. This system has strong practicability, which can compensate for the deficiencies of the infrastructure detection in the past and provide a new informationalized management platform for freeway management...|$|R
40|$|The {{systematic}} {{development of}} the residential combustion system {{is divided into three}} phases. Only Phases I and IA are detailed here. Phase I constitutes the design, fabrication, testing, and evaluation of a pulse combustor sized for residential space heating. Phase IA includes additional testing with coal-water slurries and the design and evaluation of integrated systems using dry micronized coal and slurry. Phase II is an optional phase to develop an integrated system including a heat exchanger. Phase III is projected as a field test of the integrated coal-fired residential space heater. During this period, a combustor test bed was designed and fabricated to provide experimental resolution for the primary technical issues necessary to design and fabricate a fully integrated and optimized unit. A preliminary integrated design was also prepared and analytic models developed to simulate both steady-state performance and transient response during start-up and periodic cycling. The combustor test bed, <b>ancillary</b> <b>facility</b> components (including the wet cyclone scrubber), and sampling train were installed. Shakedown tests of the test bed were also initiated and a test plan is being prepared...|$|R
