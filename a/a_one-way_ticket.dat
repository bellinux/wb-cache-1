5|$|In 1951, Braathens SAFE {{applied for}} {{concession}} for a route from Oslo to Bodø via Trondheim without subsidies. They {{also stated that}} {{they were willing to}} fly all domestic routes without subsidies, granted that they were awarded all routes. This was based on the acquisition of de Havilland Heron aircraft, which could use shorter runways and has a capacity of 15 people. SAS was granted the concession to Bodø and Trondheim, but the Ministry of Transport issued a concession to Braathens SAFE on the route from Oslo via Tønsberg Airport, Jarlsberg to Stavanger. The plane started in Stavanger in the morning, and operated the opposite direction of SAS' route from Oslo to Stavanger, which continued onwards to London.

500|$|The Act of Parliament {{establishing}} the LNC had specified maximum ticket {{prices for the}} railway, and traffic never rose to {{the level at which}} it would have been justified for either the LNC or the LSWR to undertake costly and time consuming lobbying for a change in the legislation. As a consequence, despite the effects of inflation, competition and variable costs the fares of the London Necropolis Railway never changed throughout the first 85 of its 87 years of operation. Live passengers were charged 6s in first class, 3s6d in second class and 2s in third class (in 1854 worth about £, £ and £ respectively in [...] consumer terms) for a return ticket, while dead passengers were charged £1 in first class, 5s in second class and 2s6d in third class (in 1854 worth about £, £ and £ respectively in [...] consumer terms) for <b>a</b> <b>one-way</b> <b>ticket.</b> As the railway was intended only to be used by Londoners visiting the cemetery or attending funerals, the only tickets ever issued to living passengers were returns from London. In 1918 the LSWR (which provided the LNC's passenger carriages) abandoned second class services and the LNC as a consequence discontinued the sale of second class fares to living passengers, but continued to separate coffin tickets into first, second and third class dependent on the type of funeral booked.|$|E
500|$|By 1992, {{the rail}} link {{proposal}} had gained traction with the Port Authority, which had started reviewing blueprints for the JFK rail link. At the time, {{it was thought}} that the link could be partially open by 1998. [...] In 1994, the Port Authority set aside $40 million for engineering and marketing of the new line, as well as created an environmental impact statement (EIS). The EIS, conducted by the New York State Department of Transportation and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), found the plan to be feasible. However, the project also accumulated opposition from area residents and advocacy groups. The PFC funds being collected by the Port Authority were supposed to fund the project, whose budget had grown to $2.6 billion. The project was to start in 1996, but there were disputes over where to place the Manhattan terminal. The intersection of Lexington Avenue and 59th Street was originally proposed for the terminal's location due to its high concentration of airport travelers, but Manhattan community leaders were concerned over the amount of traffic that would result from building the terminal there. Many East Midtown residents opposed the Manhattan terminal outright because it would cause more limousine and taxi traffic in the neighborhood, as well as remove two travel lanes from the Queensboro Bridge. The Port Authority also did not consider a connection to Grand Central Terminal or Penn Station, which both have a higher ridership base, because such a connection would be too expensive and complicated. To pay for the project, the Port Authority would charge <b>a</b> <b>one-way</b> <b>ticket</b> price of between $9 and $12.|$|E
