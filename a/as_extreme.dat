5|$|His compositions, {{particularly}} those of his later period, are notable for their complex textures, rich harmonies and orchestration, and the elaborate use of leitmotifs—musical phrases associated with individual characters, places, ideas, or plot elements. His advances in musical language, such <b>as</b> <b>extreme</b> chromaticism and quickly shifting tonal centres, greatly influenced the development of classical music. His Tristan und Isolde is sometimes described as marking the start of modern music.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the large fluctuations in Haumea's light curve due to the body's shape, which affect all colours equally, smaller independent colour variations seen in both visible and near-infrared wavelengths show a region on the surface that differs both in colour and in albedo. More specifically, a large dark red area on Haumea's bright white surface was seen in September 2009, possibly an impact feature, which indicates an area rich in minerals and organic (carbon-rich) compounds, or possibly {{a higher proportion of}} crystalline ice. Thus Haumea may have a mottled surface reminiscent of Pluto, if not <b>as</b> <b>extreme.</b>|$|E
5|$|The PPV is {{considered}} the first time most viewers in the United States {{were exposed to the}} lucha libre style of wrestling, and contributed to several AAA workers, especially Eddie Guerrero, Rey Misterio Jr., Konnan, Psicosis, and Juventud Guerrera, working regularly in the United States for promotions such <b>as</b> <b>Extreme</b> Championship Wrestling (ECW), World Championship Wrestling, and the World Wrestling Federation/World Wrestling Entertainment (WWF, later WWE). The show is also notable for being the last appearance by Art Barr, who died 17 days later.|$|E

Hyperthyroidism can induce an extreme appetite and rapid weight loss, while Bondeson(2006) speculates that Domery possibly suffered from a damaged amygdala or ventromedial nucleus; it is known that injuries to the amygdala or ventromedial nucleus in animals can induce polyphagia.|$|E

5|$|Wind {{engineering}} {{is a field}} of engineering devoted {{to the analysis of}} wind effects on the natural and built environment. It includes strong winds which may cause discomfort as well <b>as</b> <b>extreme</b> winds such as tornadoes, hurricanes and storms which may cause widespread destruction. Wind engineering draws upon meteorology, aerodynamics and a number of specialist engineering disciplines. The tools used include climate models, atmospheric boundary layer wind tunnels and numerical models. It involves, among other topics, how wind impacting buildings must be accounted for in engineering.|$|E
5|$|Hairway to Steven {{was issued}} in April, and marked a midway point between the band's {{experimental}} roots, {{and the more}} accessible recordings that would follow. While half of the material is <b>as</b> <b>extreme</b> sounding as their earlier work, other songs are more conventional. This was the first Butthole Surfers album to make extensive use of acoustic guitar. Hairway to Steven did not have song titles when first released, and instead represented each track with an absurdist, often scatological, cartoon. The band traveled widely {{in support of the}} album over the next year, including a very successful tour of Europe (helped in part by the influence of new UK distributor Blast First). Like their studio recordings, their live shows were beginning to lose much of their earlier chaos.|$|E
5|$|One {{property}} {{unique to}} Archaea is the abundant use of ether-linked lipids in their cell membranes. Ether linkages are more chemically stable than the ester linkages found in Bacteria and Eukarya, {{which may be}} a contributing factor {{to the ability of}} many Archaea to survive in extreme environments that place heavy stress on cell membranes, such <b>as</b> <b>extreme</b> heat and salinity. Comparative analysis of archaeal genomes has also identified several molecular signatures in the form of conserved signature indels and signature proteins which are uniquely present in either all Archaea or different main groups within Archaea. Another unique feature of Archaea is that no other known organisms are capable of methanogenesis (the metabolic production of methane). Methanogenic Archaea play a pivotal role in ecosystems with organisms that derive energy from oxidation of methane, many of which are Bacteria, as they are often a major source of methane in such environments and can play a role as primary producers. Methanogens also {{play a critical role in}} the carbon cycle, breaking down organic carbon into methane, which is also a major greenhouse gas.|$|E

25|$|Dubuque has a humid {{continental}} climate (Köppen Dfa), which gives it four distinct seasons. However, local weather {{is often not}} <b>as</b> <b>extreme</b> as that found {{in other parts of}} the Midwest, such as Minnesota or Wisconsin. Spring is usually wet and rainy, summers are sunny and warm, autumn is mild, and winters are typically cloudy and snowy.|$|E
25|$|A {{closely related}} concept is the E-value, {{which is the}} {{expected}} number of times in multiple testing that one expects to obtain a test statistic at least <b>as</b> <b>extreme</b> {{as the one that}} was actually observed if one assumes that the null hypothesis is true. The E-value is the product of the number of tests and the p-value.|$|E

25|$|While in {{principle}} the acceptable level of statistical significance {{may be subject}} to debate, the p-value is the smallest significance level that allows the test to reject the null hypothesis. This is logically equivalent to saying that the p-value is the probability, assuming the null hypothesis is true, of observing a result at least <b>as</b> <b>extreme</b> as the test statistic. Therefore, the smaller the p-value, the lower the probability of committing type I error.|$|E
