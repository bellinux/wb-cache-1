40|$|Diarrhea {{has been}} a major {{contributor}} for infant morbidity and infant mortality in developing countries, Honduras with no exception. This paper explores a case study on the illness rate of diarrhea in children in a rural community in Honduras called Casco Urbano. The purpose of this thesis is to explore the different possible causes of this problem in this specific community and search for feasible policies that can be implemented. The method used in this paper is the System Dynamics methodology by building a model that intends to reproduce the problematic behavior. The structure and behavior of the model was used to explore the feedbacks between the water quality, hygienic habit adoption and prevalence of the disease in respect with the illness rate of diarrhea in children from the community. The System Dynamics method facilitated the policy design to improve the problem in hand. The policies included <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> water <b>fee</b> and reinforcing hygienic habits which resulted to be a helpful insight in how the situation could improve. This model and paper however do not intend to solve the diarrhea illness rate in this community. It can use as an insight of feedbacks that might not be considered presently...|$|R

40|$|Tuition <b>fees</b> <b>of</b> public {{universities}} are greatly increasing {{in recent years}} in China. Many researchers have made an attempt to examine the effects <b>of</b> rising <b>fee</b> on students'enrollment behavior. However, there is no systematic analysis of the causes <b>of</b> <b>fee</b> increase, and the causal relations between the fee rising and the expansion of higher education. This paper will focus on the following four points: (1) the history <b>of</b> university <b>fees,</b> (2) the present situation <b>of</b> tuition <b>fees,</b> (3) the mechanism responsible for the fee rising, (4) the relation between the rising <b>of</b> <b>fees</b> and the higher education expansion. The findings of this article are as follows: (1) The transformation <b>of</b> <b>fee</b> system is not from free-fee one to high-fee one directly, but through several transitive phases in which various fee policies were experimented by the central government. (2) The present standard <b>of</b> tuition <b>fee</b> is very high. Fee average is up to 5000 yuan every year. And the amount <b>of</b> <b>fee</b> collected by different institutions varies greatly according to university and department's prestige. (3) Each institution of higher education {{played an important role in}} the process <b>of</b> <b>fee</b> rising. The central government changed the fee policies, which gave each institution an arbitrary power to decide its fee level and how to spend it partly. (4) Consequently, the fee rising in {{public universities}} gave an incentive to every institution and directly promoted the expansion of the higher education...|$|R

40|$|Regulatory fees were {{launched}} by the Act No. 261 / 2007 Coll. on stabilization of public budget. Many acts were amended through this Act including the Act No. 48 / 1997 Coll. on public health insurance. This amendment set the obligation for the person insured or their legal representative to pay regulatory fees to the medical facility providing health care ? a practitioner, a medical facility or a pharmacy. The aim of this thesis was to summarize legal adjustment considering regulatory fees and to map citizens´ opinions of both this issue and regulatory character <b>of</b> <b>fees.</b> The author´s goal was to ascertain whether citizen´s opinions have changed in past five years since their implementation. Whether citizens became accustomed to the fees and if they understood their purpose or they would rather abolish them. Theoretical part explains the terms relating to health care and insurance industry where the particular regulatory fees are explained in detail, such as their amount {{and the range of}} people involved. The attention is paid even to cases <b>of</b> the regulatory <b>fee</b> exemption. Theoretical part also deals with the safety limit which is directly concerned with regulatory fees as well as it is explained which fees belong to this limit. The next subsection is concerned with the basic rules of providing health care in member states of the European Union. The theoretical part concludes with the description of the individual changes and amendments which regulatory fees underwent during 2008 - 2013. The practical part was created by the means of quantity research which was conducted through the questioning method. The questioning survey of 331 respondents among the public of South Bohemia was implemented through online questionnaire and the tangible forms. Three following hypotheses are defined {{on the basis of the}} secondary sources: Hypothesis 1 : Respondents do not agree with the fee increases for a hospital stay from 60,- CZK to 100,- CZK. Hypothesis 2 : From all the launched regulatory fees only the emergency service fee affects the use of health care. Hypothesis 3 : Patients agree with the prescription charges. The hypotheses H 1 and H 3 were confirmed whereas H 2 were proved false on the basis of the questionnaires. It was proved that 90,- CZK treatment fee in emergency service is not for the majority of people so high so that it would prevent them from using emergency service and therefore negatively affected the use of health care. On the contrary, it follows from the confirmed hypothesis that the cancellation <b>of</b> 30,-CZK <b>fee</b> for prescription item and the replacement for fee prescription as a whole was correct. As patients are more willing to pay a fee for prescription rather than pay for every item. The outcome of hypothesis 1 was virtually unequivocal for most of respondents do not agree with the fee increase for a one day of hospital stay. Research outcomes show the fact that in comparison with previous years not only does the acceptance of citizens about regulatory fee system gets better but also does their acceptance of citizens and citizens? willingness to pay them. There is always a group of people who are not satisfied with the current <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> regulatory <b>fees.</b> It also seems improbable to eliminate fees to affect personal and family budget. The important goals of Czech public health and responsible bodies are to set regulatory fees in the way to accomplish their regulatory objective as well as make sure fees do not limit the ability of people who end up in socially or otherwise difficult situation to use health care. The thesis may work well as an information booklet for the wide public, as a study material for the students of Health and Social Studies or as a source for comparison with future researches...|$|R
