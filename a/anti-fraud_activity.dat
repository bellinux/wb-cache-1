We proceed to analyse the problem as the product of motivation and opportunity, and address the complexities of fraud control. Finally, we provide a high-level overview of current <b>anti-fraud</b> <b>activity.</b> 1...|$|E
40|$|Fraud is an {{increasing}} phenomenon as shown in many surveys carried out by leading international consulting companies in the last years. Despite the evolution of electronic payments and hacking techniques {{there is still a}} strong human component in fraud schemes. Conflict of interest in particular is the main contributing factor to the success of internal fraud. In such cases anomaly detection tools are not always the best instruments, since the fraud schemes are based on faking documents in a context dominated by lack of controls, and the perpetrators are those ones who should control possible irregularities. In the banking sector audit team experts can count only on their experience, whistle blowing and the reports sent by their inspectors. The Fraud Interactive Decision Expert System (FIDES), which is the core of this research, is a multi-agent system built to support auditors in evaluating suspicious behaviours and to speed up the evaluation process in order to detect or prevent fraud schemes. The system combines Think-map, Delphi method and Attack trees and it has been built around audit team experts and their needs. The output of FIDES is an attack tree, a tree-based diagram to ”systematically categorize the different ways in which a system can be attacked”. Once the attack tree is built, auditors can choose the path they perceive as more suitable and {{decide whether or not to}} start the investigation. The system is meant for use in the future to retrieve old cases in order to match them with new ones and find similarities. The retrieving features of the system will be useful to simplify the risk management phase, since similar countermeasures adopted for past cases might be useful for present ones. Even though FIDES has been built with the banking sector in mind, it can be applied in all those organisations, like insurance companies or public organizations, where <b>anti-fraud</b> <b>activity</b> is based on a central anti-fraud unit and a reporting system...|$|E

40|$|Fraud in the EU, {{comparison}} analysis {{between the}} structures and responsibility relationships of the OLAF and a traditional corporate governance layout in private organizations in regards of fraud prevention and detection. Since the recent increase in fraud scandals, companies had to adapt themselves to more scrutiny from the shareholders {{and to the}} toughing of company law that was so far regulated by the theft act 1968 and disclosure through information. Hence in the UK, the Parliament launched in march 2005 the fraud bill. On the European level, this quest for transparency has been translated by {{the implementation of a}} European Anti fraud Office in 1999, the OLAF. The OLAF (or Office Europen de Lutte Anti-Fraude) has been charged by the European Union with protecting the interests of the European Union, to fighting fraud, corruption and any other irregular activity, including misconduct within the European Institutions, in an accountable, transparent and cost-effective manner. OLAF achieves its mission by conducting, in full independence, internal and external investigations. It also organizes close and regular co-operation between the competent authorities of the Member States in order to co-ordinate their activities. OLAF supplies Member States with the necessary support and technical know-how to help them in their <b>anti-fraud</b> <b>activities.</b> It contributes to the design of the anti-fraud strategy of the European Union and takes the necessary initiatives to strengthen the relevant legislation. This dissertation is analyzing the analogy {{of the structure of the}} OLAF with the traditional corporate governance. The question is here to evaluate the structure and responsibility relationships of the Olaf in comparison with the monitoring model based on corporate governance. The outcome of this comparison should give us an understanding of functioning of the Olaf and might give more insight of the issues/conflicts faced by this institution...|$|R
