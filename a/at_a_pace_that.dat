5|$|During 1928–1973, the Soviet Union {{was growing}} {{economically}} <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>pace</b> <b>that</b> would eventually {{catch up with}} the United States and Western Europe. This was true despite the advantage the United States had — the USSR was hampered by the effects of World War II, which had left most of Western USSR in ruins. In 1973, the process of catching up {{with the rest of the}} West came to an abrupt end, and 1973 was seen by some scholars as the start of the Era of Stagnation. The beginning of the stagnation coincided with a financial crisis in Western Europe and the U.S. By the early 1970s, the Soviet Union had the world's second largest industrial capacity, and produced more steel, oil, pig-iron, cement and tractors than any other country. Before 1973, the Soviet economy was expanding at faster rate than that of the American economy (albeit by a very small margin). The USSR also kept a steady pace with the economies of Western Europe. Between 1964 and 1973, the Soviet economy stood at roughly half the output per head of Western Europe and a little more than one third that of the U.S.|$|E
25|$|The {{radicals}} describe Herzen as {{a liberal}} for not wanting immediate change, but Herzen rejects their pleas arguing for change <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>pace</b> <b>that</b> will ensure success. Herzen briefly joined with other Russian liberals such as Kavelin to promote the peasant 'awakening' in Russia. Herzen continued to use The Bell as an outlet to promote unity with all sections of the Russian society behind a demand for a national parliament.|$|E
25|$|Mitchell Energy had a near-monopoly in {{drilling}} Barnett Shale {{wells in}} the early years of the field. In 1995, for instance, Mitchell completed 70 Barnett wells, while all other operators combined completed three. This was largely because the Barnett was marginal economically: according to a former CEO, Mitchell had invested about $250 million in the Barnett from 1981 to 1997, and had not recouped its costs. But after 1997, competitors realized that Mitchell had discovered how to extract gas profitably, they, too started buying leases and drilling Barnett wells, <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>pace</b> <b>that</b> Mitchell could not match. In 2001, for the first time, Mitchell completed fewer than half the Barnett Shale wells (258 wells, versus 260 by other operators).|$|E

Such services offer everything from consumer convenience to life-saving security: • An out-of-town visitor wants directions to the closest Starbucks, but the visitor’s network wants to serve up an advertisement for a competing coffee shop. • An armored transport company needs to track each of its trucks in real time. • A father gives his child a device that automatically “checks in ” whenever it can connect to an ope...|$|R
25|$|In the US, victims' rights {{include the}} right to have a victims {{advocate}} preside over every step of the medical/legal exam to ensure sensitivity towards victims, provide emotional support, and minimize the risk of re-traumatization. Victims are to be informed of this immediately by law enforcement or medical service providers. Emergency rooms of many hospitals employ sexual assault nurse/forensic examiners (SAN/FEs) with specific training to care for those who have experienced a rape or sexual assault. They are able to conduct a focused medical-legal exam. If such a trained clinician is not available, the emergency department has a sexual assault protocol that has been established for treatment and the collection of evidence. Staff are also trained to explain the examinations in detail, the documentation and the rights associated with the requirement for informed consent. Emphasis is placed on performing the examinations <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>pace</b> <b>that</b> is appropriate for the person, their family, their age, and their level of understanding. Privacy is recommended as is the prevention of self-harm.|$|E
25|$|The Indian Craton {{was once}} part of the supercontinent of Pangaea. At that time, what is now India's {{southwest}} coast was attached to Madagascar and southern Africa, and what is now its east coast was attached to Australia. During the Jurassic Period about 160 Ma (ICS 2004), rifting caused Pangaea to break apart into two supercontinents, namely Gondwana (to the south) and Laurasia (to the north). The Indian Craton remained attached to Gondwana, until the supercontinent began to rift apart about in the early Cretaceous, about 125 million years ago (ICS 2004). The Indian Plate then drifted northward toward the Eurasian Plate, <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>pace</b> <b>that</b> is the fastest known movement of any plate. It is generally believed that the Indian Plate separated from Madagascar about 90 Million years ago (ICS 2004), however some biogeographical and geological {{evidence suggests that the}} connection between Madagascar and Africa was retained at the time when the Indian Plate collided with the Eurasian Plate about 50 Million years ago (ICS 2004). This orogeny, which is continuing today, is related to closure of the Tethys Ocean. The closure of this ocean which created the Alps in Europe, and the Caucasus range in western Asia, created the Himalaya Mountains and the Tibetan Plateau in South Asia. The current orogenic event is causing parts of the Asian continent to deform westward and eastward {{on either side of the}} orogen. Concurrently with this collision, the Indian Plate sutured on to the adjacent Australian Plate, forming a new larger plate, the Indo-Australian Plate.|$|E
500|$|Those with {{concussion}} {{are generally}} prescribed rest, including adequate nighttime sleep {{as well as}} daytime rest. [...] Rest includes both physical and cognitive rest until symptoms clear [...] and a gradual return to normal activities <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>pace</b> <b>that</b> does not cause symptoms to worsen is recommended. [...] Education about symptoms, their management, and their normal time course, can lead to an improved outcome.|$|E

Although he had put up points <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>pace</b> <b>that</b> most NHL forwards would be very content with (22 points in 26 games) in his last season, Lemieux still remarked that [...] "I can no longer play at a level I was accustomed to in the past." ...|$|E

50|$|Critics and {{listeners}} {{have often}} felt stirred or {{inspired by the}} Seventh Symphony.
