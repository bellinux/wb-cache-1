Following the event, a rule was made to limit the length of any option contracts to sixty days, to prevent a similar coup on the short side. After some troubles, Little was again worth $2 million by 1846 (equivalent to about $ million today). However, his fortunes were again reversed that year when he attempted but failed to corner the Norwich and Worcester Railroad and was obligated to pay out for thousands of inflated shares that he had himself bid up in price, losing about <b>a</b> <b>million</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>in</b> the process—a staggering sum at the time.|$|E

5|$|Throughout her career, James {{won more}} World Barrel Racing Championships {{than any other}} {{competitor}} {{in the history of}} the sport. She is barrel racing’s all-time leading money earner, and the first person to surpass <b>a</b> <b>million</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>in</b> prize winnings. James earned national recognition after winning the WPRA World Barrel Racing Championship consecutively from 1984 to 1993 riding Gils Bay Boy, a 1977 American Quarter Horse Association (AQHA) gelding known by his nickname, Scamper, and again in 2002 on a horse named Cruiser. James and Scamper also won the NFR Barrel Racing Average Titles in 1984, 1986, 1987, 1989, 1990, 1993, and 2002. James qualified for the NFR 19 times with five different horses prior to her retirement in 2003, and was also a gold medalist at the 1988 Calgary Olympics Rodeo. James has a hall of fame career but could not be inducted into the ProRodeo Hall of Fame except into the Notables category until 2017. Starting with the 38th class of inductees in 2017, the ProRodeo Hall of Fame entered into a partnership with the WPRA to include barrel racers, and James was one of two barrel racers inducted.|$|E

Shearson/American Express Inc., filed suit under both acts. The district court had followed McMahon and ordered arbitration of the 1934 Act claims but not those under the 1933 Act. Shearson appealed, claiming Wilko had effectively been overruled by that decision, and a three-judge panel heard the case in the middle of 1988.|$|E
25|$|Pacific Mail's woes were {{exacerbated}} {{after the}} stock speculator Jay Gould, in a clandestine attempt {{to acquire the}} company's stock cheaply, persuaded the U.S. Congress to rescind its $500,000 annual subsidy.

Roach eventually renegotiated the Pacific Mail contract, reducing the latter's monthly obligations from $75,000 to $35,000, and the two vessels were launched in 1874.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, {{construction}} {{began on}} the high school to replace aging buildings {{at the center of the}} campus. A-D wings were torn down to make room for a new three-story building.

50|$|During the 90s {{and early}} 2000s, Cantor, Arkema had two {{distinct}} practice areas: a business group and a plaintiff litigation group. The plaintiff litigation group included, among others, Irv Cantor, Lewis Stoneburner, Aubrey Ford, Stephanie Grana, and Elliott Buckner. The {{lawyers in the}} plaintiff litigation group consistently achieved verdicts and settlements that were listed {{among the highest in}} Virginia and were voted into leadership roles in several state and national plaintiff’s trial bar associations, including the presidency of the Virginia Trial Lawyers Association, the Virginia Chapter of the American Board of Trial Advocates, and the Metro Woman's Bar Association. Some of the significant cases handled by the group in the 90s included recoveries that were the largest ever recorded in the particular jurisdictions where the lawsuits were brought, including <b>a</b> 5.95 <b>million</b> <b>dollar</b> recovery <b>in</b> <b>a</b> medical malpractice case in a rural North Carolina county and <b>a</b> 4.5 <b>million</b> <b>dollar</b> recovery <b>in</b> <b>a</b> motor vehicle case in a rural Virginia county. In the early-2000s, the group achieved numerous other significant results, including <b>a</b> 5.6 <b>million</b> <b>dollar</b> verdict <b>in</b> <b>a</b> motor vehicle case, <b>a</b> 5 <b>million</b> <b>dollar</b> recovery <b>in</b> <b>an</b> industrial explosion case, <b>a</b> 5 <b>million</b> <b>dollar</b> recovery <b>in</b> <b>a</b> motorcycle accident case, and <b>a</b> 4.4 <b>million</b> <b>dollar</b> verdict <b>in</b> <b>a</b> medical malpractice case.|$|R

The Playhouse operates under a nonprofit, LORT-B designated regional theatre status. While traditionally it produced six plays annually on its mainstage, under the new guidelines the season will go through a possible reduction to under 4 productions into the foreseeable future.

25|$|Compared {{to rural}} parts of California, living in Milpitas is more expensive, {{as it is}} {{throughout}} Silicon Valley. Compared to other South Bay bedroom communities Milpitas is considered affordable. For example, a regular one-story, detached single-family home with a 1,300-square-foot (140 m²) size sells for between $600,000 to $700,000 in the city. These prices are slightly more affordable {{than the rest of}} the San Francisco Bay Area, as a similar sized house may cost well over <b>a</b> <b>million</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>in</b> more affluent cities such as Palo Alto, Cupertino or Saratoga. Reasons for the expensive housing in the South Bay Area include the regional high tech industries, mild climate, strong foreign investment in the West Coast's housing, and a huge demand for limited homes. With the decline in the housing market, however, median sales prices in Milpitas have declined from nearly $700,000 to less than $500,000, and single-family new house construction building permits have plummeted from a 2004 average price of $949,900 to $269,400 in 2007.|$|E
25|$|Following the 2008/09 season, Conor Henry was {{replaced}} by former Sydney Spirit head coach Rob Beveridge. However, in May 2009, the Wildcats came within weeks of folding unless they raised <b>a</b> <b>million</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>in</b> sponsorship. The NBL itself was also in strife; with the competition falling on tough times, {{there was a real}} possibility at the time {{that there would be no}} league in 2009/10. The Wildcats eventually received backing from property developer Diploma Group, while the NBL made significant changes to the competition. One of Basketball Australia's moves for the 2009/10 season was to return the NBL game to a 40-minute format from the 48-minutes it adopted in 1984, ostensibly to accommodate the international game. This was done to bring Australia back in step with the rest of the world (outside the NBA) and to be more attractive to television as a package because a 40-minute game slots well into a two-hour timeslot.|$|E

25|$|The year 1871 however, {{also brought}} {{developments}} which signalled Neafie & Levy's eventual {{departure from the}} front rank of American shipbuilders. In this year, Cramp & Sons built its first marine engine, and henceforth was to purchase no more engines from Neafie & Levy, depriving the latter of a principal customer. Moreover, Cramp constructed a large dry dock which enabled it to enter the lucrative hull repair business. Jacob Neafie did not follow suit, preferring to rely upon his existing business model of building smaller iron vessels and supplying engines to builders of wooden ships. By 1880, although Neafie & Levy was still Philadelphia's most heavily capitalized firm with <b>a</b> <b>million</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>in</b> assets, its return on investment (ROI) was only 7.1% {{compared to that of}} Cramp with an ROI in excess of 15%. Moreover, Cramp's capitalization was not far behind at $750,000, but it employed 2,300 workers compared to Neafie & Levy's 500, and its output was more than 2½ times greater. A substantial part of the difference was due to the Cramp dry dock.|$|E
25|$|Universal Studios Hollywood's back lot {{has been}} damaged by fire nine times {{throughout}} its history. The first was in 1932 when embers from a nearby brush fire were blown toward the back lot causing four movie sets to be destroyed and resulting in over $100,000 damage. Seventeen years later, in 1949, another brush fire caused the complete destruction of one building and damage to two others. In 1957, the New York street film studio set was destroyed by an arson fire causing half <b>a</b> <b>million</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>in</b> damage. Ten years later, in 1967, twice as much damage was done when the Little Europe area and part of Spartacus Square was destroyed. It also destroyed the European, Denver and Laramie street sets. In 1987, the remaining portion of Spartacus Square was destroyed along with street sets and other buildings. As with the 1957 fire, this was suspected {{to be the result}} of an arsonist. Just three years later, another deliberate fire was started in the back lot. The New York Street set, the Ben Hur set and the majority of Courthouse Square were destroyed. In 1997, the seventh fire occurred at the back lot. A portion of the Courthouse Square was again destroyed, though most survived.|$|E
