25|$|The {{economy of}} the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics {{was based on a}} system of state {{ownership}} of the means of production, collective farming, industrial manufacturing and centralized <b>administrative</b> <b>planning.</b> The economy was characterized by state control of investment, and public ownership of industrial assets. The Soviet Union invested heavily into infrastructure projects including the electrification of vast areas, and the construction and maintenance of natural gas and oil pipelines that stretch out of Russia and into every constituent nation of the USSR. This type of investment set the stage for Russia to become an Energy Superpower in the modern age.|$|E

2500|$|Since the {{dissolution}} of the Soviet Union, environmental regulation is largely unchanged in Turkmenistan. The new government created the Ministry of Natural Resources Use and Environmental Protection in July 1992, with departments responsible for environmental protection, protection of flora and fauna, forestry, hydrometeorology, and <b>administrative</b> <b>planning.</b> Like other CIS republics, Turkmenistan has established an Environmental Fund based on revenues collected from environmental fines, but the fines generally are too low to accumulate significant revenue. Thanks to the former Soviet system of game preserves and the efforts of the Society for Nature Conservation and the Academy of Sciences, flora and fauna receive some protection in the republic; however, [...] "hard-currency hunts" [...] by wealthy Western and Arab businesspeople already are depleting animals on preserves.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{estimate}} {{the effect of}} introducing a Roth option to an employer-sponsored savings <b>plan</b> using <b>administrative</b> <b>plan</b> data from nine companies that added a Roth option between 2006 and 2008. We find mixed evidence on whether contribution rates fall after a Roth introduction, {{which means that the}} amount of after-tax retirement consumption being purchased by 401 (k) contributions may increase. There is suggestive evidence that when choosing the composition of their own contributions, employees contributing above the employer match threshold ignore the fact that matching contributions are entirely before-tax. Conditional on plan participation, Roth participation is highest among young, low-income employees...|$|R

50|$|The {{theoretical}} postulates for {{models of}} decentralized socialist planning {{stem from the}} thought of Karl Kautsky, Rosa Luxemburg, Nikolai Bukharin and Oskar Lange. This model involves economic decision-making based on self-governance from the bottom-up (by employees and consumers) without any directing central authority. This often contrasts with the doctrine of orthodox Marxist-Leninism, which advocates directive <b>administrative</b> <b>planning</b> where directives are passed down from higher authorities (planning agencies) to agents (enterprise managers), who in turn give orders to workers.|$|E
