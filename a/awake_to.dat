She authored a book on the subject: <b>Awake</b> <b>to</b> a Perfect Day, published by Citadel Press, NYC, 1956 After originally objecting to the release of her father's Letters from the Earth in 1939, she changed her stance shortly before her death in 1962 and allowed them to be published. She also published biographies of both her father (My Father, Mark Twain in 1931) and of her first husband (My Husband: Gabrilowitsch in 1938).|$|E

The film stars Cary Elwes, Danny Glover, Monica Potter, Michael Emerson, Ken Leung, Tobin Bell and Leigh Whannell. In the film, Elwes and Whannell portray two men who <b>awake</b> <b>to</b> find themselves chained in a large dilapidated bathroom, with one being ordered to kill the other or his family will die.

5|$|Book One, <b>Awake</b> <b>to</b> Emptiness, {{begins with}} Bold and Psin, scouts in Timur's army, {{discovering}} a Magyar village {{where all the}} inhabitants have died from a plague. Timur turns his army around and orders the scouting party executed to avoid the plague, but Bold escapes and wanders through the dead lands of Eastern Europe (encountering only one lone native). Upon reaching the sea he is captured by Turkish Muslim slave-traders and sold into Zheng He's Chinese treasure fleet. Bold befriends a young African slave, named Kyu, whom he cares for after the Chinese castrate him. In China, they are kept as kitchen slaves until escaping and eventually making their way north to Beijing where they find work at the palace of Zhu Gaozhi, heir to the Yongle Emperor. The vengeful Kyu hates the Chinese for {{what they have done}} to him and he incites violence between the eunuchs and the Confucian administrative officials.|$|E

5|$|Sycorax {{has been}} conceptualised {{in a variety}} ways by {{adapters}} and directors of The Tempest. In John Dryden and William Davenant's version of The Tempest (1670), Sycorax is survived by two children, Caliban and a daughter also named Sycorax. This second Sycorax makes sexual advances toward Trinculo, the drunken sailor, and (according to Trinculo) also has incestuous relations with her brother Caliban. Die Geisterinsel, a 1778 version of the play in German, includes a living Sycorax, a witch who has full power during the night, while Prospero rules the day. In this play, {{she is the one}} who causes the tempest and shipwreck, not Prospero; Prospero is extremely wary of her actions as each night approaches, as she has power over those who sleep. Several times he struggles to keep Miranda <b>awake</b> <b>to</b> protect her from Sycorax's power. In Eugène Scribe's French 1846 version, Sycorax is alive but imprisoned behind some rocks out of sight. She spends most of the play trying to convince her son, Caliban, to free her. Peter Brook's 1968 British version of the play portrayed Sycorax as an ugly witch, including her in a birth scene in which the equally ugly Caliban is born.|$|E

25|$|As a {{symbolic}} object, it represents Hermes (or the Roman Mercury), {{and by extension}} trades, occupations, or undertakings associated with the god. In later Antiquity, the caduceus {{provided the basis for}} the astrological symbol representing the planet Mercury. Thus, through its use in astrology, alchemy, and astronomy it has come to denote the planet and elemental metal of the same name. It is said the wand would wake the sleeping and send the <b>awake</b> <b>to</b> sleep. If applied to the dying, their death was gentle; if applied to the dead, they returned to life.|$|E
25|$|Moore {{started his}} music career in {{progressive}} metal band Dream Theater. He contributed music and lyrics to the band's first three studio albums, but left the band during {{the recording of}} <b>Awake</b> <b>to</b> pursue his own musical interests. Starting with 1998's Dead Air for Radios, he has released electronica, ambient music through his solo project Chroma Key. Moore has guested on several albums, including three Fates Warning albums. This led Moore to form OSI with Fates Warning guitarist Jim Matheos in 2002, a band which combines progressive metal with electronica. The fourth OSI album, Fire Make Thunder, was released in March 2012.|$|E
25|$|Unihemispheric sleep {{refers to}} {{sleeping}} {{with only a}} single cerebral hemisphere. The phenomenon has been observed in birds and aquatic mammals, {{as well as in}} several reptilian species (the latter being disputed: many reptiles behave in a way which could be construed as unihemispheric sleeping, but EEG studies have given contradictory results). Reasons for the development of unihemispheric sleep are likely that it enables the sleeping animal to receive stimuli—threats, for instance—from its environment, and that it enables the animal to fly or periodically surface to breathe when immersed in water. Only NREM sleep exists unihemispherically, and there seems to exist a continuum in unihemispheric sleep regarding the differences in the hemispheres: in animals exhibiting unihemispheric sleep, conditions range from one hemisphere being in deep sleep with the other hemisphere being <b>awake</b> <b>to</b> one hemisphere sleeping lightly with the other hemisphere being awake. If one hemisphere is selectively deprived of sleep in an animal exhibiting unihemispheric sleep (one hemisphere is allowed to sleep freely but the other is awoken whenever it falls asleep), the amount of deep sleep will selectively increase in the hemisphere that was deprived of sleep when both hemispheres are allowed to sleep freely.|$|E

Reagan said that if his listeners did not write letters to prevent it, [...] "we will <b>awake</b> <b>to</b> find that we have socialism. And if you don't do this, and if I don't do it, one of these days, you and I are going to spend our sunset years telling our children, and our children's children, what it once was like in America when men were free."

500|$|Quentin {{tries to}} accept that his nightmares {{are nothing more than}} {{repressed}} memories, but he falls asleep during swim practice and witnesses what really happened to Krueger: Everyone's parents hunted down Krueger and burned him alive. Quentin and Nancy believe that Krueger wants revenge on them for lying as children. As a result of their insomnia, they begin sporadically dreaming while they are still <b>awake.</b> <b>To</b> try to stop Krueger, they decide to go to the preschool and learn what they can. On the way, Nancy falls asleep and is attacked by Krueger, but when Quentin wakes her up, they discover she has pulled a piece of Krueger's sweater out of the dreamworld and into reality. Quentin takes Nancy to the hospital; there, he steals some adrenaline to help them stay awake. At the preschool, Quentin uncovers Krueger's hidden room and evidence that proves Krueger was in fact abusing all of the children; [...] Krueger actually wants revenge on them for telling the truth.|$|E
500|$|Sepinwall {{complained that}} viewers went into [...] "the episode already {{knowing that the}} Britten family's car crash was {{anything}} but". Sepinwall noted that [...] "as it played {{not only with the}} structure of the show, but the emotions of our hero by showing us what happens if he stops going to sleep in one reality and waking up in the other". According to Sepinwall, [...] "Say Hello to My Little Friend" [...] was [...] "effective" [...] as it [...] "forced [...] to finally confront a truth about his situation", and that he finally needs to grieve, by recognizing that one of his two loved ones is dead. Sepinwall praised how the episode [...] "kept mirroring moments in the pilot", while Screen Rant writer Kevin Yeoman called the installment itself [...] "powerful" [...] and [...] "compelling". Yeoman compared <b>Awake</b> <b>to</b> , writing that [...] "with just two episodes left", Awake has to go into Mission: Impossible mode to [...] "provide answers".|$|E

500|$|Science and Health {{he called}} [...] "strange and frantic and incomprehensible and uninterpretable," [...] {{and argued that}} Eddy had not written it herself. [...] "There is nothing in Christian Science that is not explicable," [...] he wrote, [...] "for God is one, Time is one, Individuality is one, and {{may be one of}} a series, one of many, as an {{individual}} man, individual horse; whereas God is one, not one of a series, but one alone and without an equal." [...] Eddy apart, Twain felt ambivalent toward the premise of mind-cure, arguing that [...] "the thing back of it is wholly gracious and beautiful..." [...] while maintaining a healthy skepticism towards the validity of mind cure adding, [...] "These things are true, or they are not. If they were true seventeen and eighteen and nineteen centuries ago {{it would be difficult to}} satisfactorily explain why or how or by what argument that power should be nonexistent in Christians now."< His daughter Clara Clemens became a Christian Scientist and wrote a book about it, <b>Awake</b> <b>to</b> a Perfect Day (1956).|$|E
500|$|Tired, weary, {{and lacking}} in money, the Carlins decided to remain in England to rest and recuperate. Throughout the journey from Nova Scotia to the Azores, both Carlin {{and his wife had}} {{suffered}} from severe hallucinations, including one instance where he had jerked <b>awake</b> <b>to</b> find himself 60° off course. Another important objective of their time in Britain was to repair Half-Safe, which had sustained large amounts of damage during the crossing, not least from Hurricane Charlie, which battered the vessel whilst it was amongst the islands of Macaronesia. The repairs to the craft were accomplished with the help of RAF Group Captain Malcolm Bunting, who had served alongside Carlin in India. To raise money for the continuation of the journey, Half-Safe was exhibited in department stores throughout Europe. During this time, Carlin also completed Half Safe: Across the Atlantic by Jeep, a book chronicling the first half of their journey, which sold 32,000 copies and was translated into five languages. The book was generally well received, with a reviewer in The Montreal Gazette describing Carlin as [...] "an adventurer of the old school – full of the explorer's instinct, and with a dry wit that makes his story an odd mixture of high-adventure and real understatement".|$|E
500|$|According to Hecht biographer, William MacAdams, [...] "At dawn on Sunday, February 20, 1939, David Selznick ... and {{director}} Victor Fleming shook Hecht <b>awake</b> <b>to</b> inform {{him he was}} on loan from MGM and must come with them immediately {{and go to work}} on Gone with the Wind, which Selznick had begun shooting five weeks before. It was costing Selznick $50,000 each day the film was on hold waiting for a final screenplay rewrite and time was of the essence. Hecht {{was in the middle of}} working on the film At the Circus for the Marx Brothers. Recalling the episode in a letter to screenwriter friend Gene Fowler, he said he hadn't read the novel but Selznick {{and director}} Fleming could not wait for him to read it. They would act out scenes based on Sidney Howard's original script which needed to be rewritten in a hurry. Hecht wrote, [...] "After each scene had been performed and discussed, I sat down at the typewriter and wrote it out. Selznick and Fleming, eager to continue with their acting, kept hurrying me. We worked in this fashion for seven days, putting in eighteen to twenty hours a day. Selznick refused to let us eat lunch, arguing that food would slow us up. He provided bananas and salted peanuts ... thus on the seventh day I had completed, unscathed, the first nine reels of the Civil War epic." ...|$|E

500|$|By March 1873, Ellen was {{believed}} to be suffering from starvation. At first, she had largely subsisted on port, tea and milk, given three times per day. After about 15months—while her mother was attempting to administer arrowroot—Ellen's jaw locked closed. Subsequently, according to Hayman, she was fed [...] "wine, gruel and other things" [...] using the [...] "spout of a toy teapot inserted between two broken teeth". The Daily Telegraph journalist expanded on Ellen's feeding: [...] "The feeding implements stand on a little table {{by the side of the}} stump bedstead, and, at first sight, give you the idea that they are toys placed there to attract her attention should she, by a merciful termination of her trance, presently <b>awake</b> <b>to</b> life. The toys in question are two tiny 'teapots', each not much larger than a full-sized walnut and holding four small teaspoonfuls. One of these is filled with port wine, and the other with milk... this quantity of liquid nourishment... cannot weigh more than half an ounce..." [...] At this time, it was considered [...] "manifestly out of the question to think of moving her". How the family dealt with Ellen's passing of urine and faeces is unclear, but in 1880, Hayman said that Ann Frewen told him that no bowel movements had occurred for five years, and that approximately every four days [...] "a somewhat large amount would pass from the bladder".|$|E
500|$|Four years later, the Chief and Cortana <b>awake</b> <b>to</b> {{find they}} are being {{attacked}} by an Ex-Covenant splinter faction lead by Jul 'Mdama(Halo 4). Caught in an artificial gravity well, they are pulled into the artificial Forerunner planet of Requiem, along with the UNSC ship Infinity. Master Chief, fighting Jul 'Mdama's Covenant faction and robotic warriors called Prometheans, unwittingly releases a hostile Forerunner warrior called [...] "The Didact" [...] from imprisonment. While seeking a way to combat the Didact, Cortana reveals that she is becoming [...] "rampant" [...] (an inevitable state leading to insanity that AIs reach when their knowledge base finally becomes too large). Master Chief is eventually contacted by a personality construct of a Forerunner called the Librarian (The Didact's Wife), who tells him about the Didact: during the crisis with the Flood, the Didact tried to use a device called the Composer to transform humanity into Prometheans. He did this because he needed soldiers that were immune to Flood Infection. His own race then imprisoned him along with the Forerunner soldiers and humans he had already converted. The Composer was hidden. After the Didact leaves Requiem and retrieves the Composer, Cortana and the Master Chief pursue him to Earth. Although the Didact is able to fire the Composer at North America, digitizing over seven million people, the Master Chief and Cortana are eventually able to cast the hateful Forerunner into a slipspace portal. They then destroy the Composer and the Didact's ship with a nuclear device. Cortana sacrifices herself to save the Master Chief from the resultant explosion. Master Chief is later found floating among the rubble, and taken back to Infinity.|$|E
500|$|Connery's {{interpretation}} of the character differed considerably from Fleming's, being more promiscuous and cold blooded than the literary version. Connery described Bond as [...] "a complete sensualist—senses highly tuned, <b>awake</b> <b>to</b> everything, quite amoral. I particularly like him because he thrives on conflict". Academic James Chapman observed that for Dr. No, Connery's {{interpretation of}} the character, although not complete, showed the actor [...] "should be credited with having established a new style of performance: a British screen hero {{in the manner of}} an American leading man". In his second film, From Russia with Love, Connery looked less nervous and edgy; he gave [...] "a relaxed, wry performance of subtle wit and style". Pfeiffer and Worrall noted that Connery [...] "personified James Bond with such perfection that even Ian Fleming... admitted that it was difficult imagining anyone else in the part"; academic Jeremy Black agreed and declared that [...] "Connery made the role his own and created the Bond audience for the cinema". Black also observed that Connery gave the character a [...] "spare, pared-down character... inner bleakness along with the style". Connery played Bond with [...] "the right mix of cool charisma, violence and arrogance... against which all others are judged". Raymond Benson perceived that Connery [...] "embodies a ruggedness and an intense screen presence this transcends any preconceived notions about the character". Benson also noted that Bond was witty, but contains [...] "an assured toughness that epitomises the machismo male". Roger Moore agreed with Black and Benson, commenting that [...] "Sean was Bond. He created Bond. He embodied Bond and because of Sean, Bond became an instantly recognisable character the world over—he was rough, tough, mean and witty... he was a bloody good 007". However, despite his charm and virility, Connery was characteristically laconic in his delivery. Christopher Bray says of him that [...] "in his single-minded, laconic, mocking, self-sufficient vanity, Connery's Bond was the epitome of sixties consumer culture".|$|E
