Hydraulic transfer is generally used for printing on curved surfaces [24, 25]. By floating a printed film on water and pressing <b>a</b> <b>curved</b> surface onto the film, uniform printing on the curved surface is obtained. Retinal vessels on <b>a</b> <b>curved</b> surface are obtained by overlaying patterned PDMS sheets on <b>a</b> <b>curved</b> surface, {{as shown in}} Fig. 5.

5|$|An ancient {{solution}} to a flow problem is <b>a</b> <b>curve</b> whose evolution can be extrapolated backwards for all time, without singularities. All of the self-similar solutions that shrink or stay the same size rather than growing are ancient solutions in this sense; they can be extrapolated backwards by reversing the self-similarity transformation that they would undergo by the forwards curve-shortening flow. Thus, for instance, the circle, grim reaper, and Abresch–Langer curves are all ancient solutions.|$|E

5|$|Because {{the area}} of <b>a</b> <b>curve</b> is reduced at a {{constant}} rate, and (by the isoperimetric inequality) a circle has the greatest possible area among simple closed curves of a given length, it follows that circles are the slowest curves to collapse to a point under the curve-shortening flow.

30|$|Elevated {{roads and}} expressways are {{mandated}} in metropolitan areas to ease traffic congestions. Particularly, {{the usage of}} curved bridges is inevitable, as bridge configurations must conform to the road alignment to ensure a smooth traffic flow. In fact, the partial or global configuration of <b>a</b> <b>curved</b> section of <b>a</b> girder is designed based on the road alignment. Generally, <b>a</b> <b>curved</b> bridge is designed and constructed as one of three types: (a) straight girders with <b>a</b> <b>curved</b> deck, (b) straight girders and decks used to set up <b>a</b> <b>curved</b> configuration, and (c) curved steel box girders with <b>a</b> <b>curved</b> deck. The type with a straight girders and <b>a</b> <b>curved</b> deck was commonly used {{for the construction of}} concrete curved bridges until the 1960 s for its design and construction simplicity. However, this type of curved bridge would require considerably more substructure construction to sufficiently support <b>a</b> <b>curved</b> deck layout using straight beams, leading to an increase in the overall construction cost (Schmitt 1966; Nakai and Yoo 1988; Suros and Chu 1991). Thus, recent studies on cost-friendly curved girder construction methods have been pursued actively. Early research focused on using a steel box girder as the main girder in <b>a</b> <b>curved</b> bridge, which would provide superior flexural, shear, and torsional capacities. However, steel box girders are extremely expensive and require continuous maintenance to avoid corrosion problem. In order to construct less expensive curved bridges, studies on I-section steel girder for curved bridge application have also been conducted (Lin and Yoda 2010; Zhang et al. 2005; Zureick and Naqib 1999; McElwain and Laman 2000; Linzell et al. 2004).|$|R
