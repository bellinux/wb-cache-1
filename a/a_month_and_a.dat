5|$|<b>A</b> <b>month</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> {{half after}} Joaquim Inácio's marriage, Emperor PedroI abdicated and sailed to Europe. Since the former emperor's son and heir Dom PedroII was a minor, a regency was formed, {{and more than}} a decade of {{instability}} and turmoil ensued. On 6 October 1831, navy artillerymen, held under suspicion of plotting a mutiny, escaped the presiganga (prison ship) in which they had been confined. Joaquim Inácio commanded the schooner Jaguaripe which, along with other vessels, had been guarding the prison ship. Seeing that the artillerymen had set sail for Rio de Janeiro, Joaquim Inácio and a few men took a boat to warn the city. They encountered musket fire from the artillerymen, who then changed course for the nearby Ilha das Cobras (Island of the Snakes) in the face of strong opposition from the mainland. They were defeated the next day when three columns of men from the Volunteer Soldier-Officers Battalion and Permanent Municipal Guard Corps invaded the island.|$|E

5|$|Benioff and Weiss {{sometimes}} assign {{characters to}} particular writers; for example, Cogman {{was assigned to}} Arya Stark for the fourth season. The writers spend several weeks writing a character outline, including what material from the novels to use and the overarching themes. After these individual outlines are complete, they spend another {{two to three weeks}} discussing each main character's individual arc and arranging them episode by episode. A detailed outline is created, with each of the writers working on a portion to create a script for each episode. Cogman, who wrote two episodes for the fifth season, took <b>a</b> <b>month</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half to complete both scripts. They are then read by Benioff and Weiss, who make notes, and parts of the script are rewritten. All ten episodes are written before filming begins, since they are filmed out of order with two units in different countries.|$|E
5|$|Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand {{was built}} at the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino {{dockyard}} in Trieste. She was laid down on 12 September 1907 and launched from the slipway on 8 September 1908. The teak used on her deck was the only material Austria-Hungary purchased abroad to build her. <b>A</b> <b>month</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half after her launch, she was towed to the harbor in Muggia for completion. During a severe storm that night, she broke loose from her moorings; with no crewmen aboard, Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand drifted for several hours before running aground just off Izola. The following morning, the navy located her and started to refloat her. Completion was delayed by a welders' strike in 1908 and a riveters' strike in 1909. Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand was the first ship of the class to be completed, and she was commissioned into the Austro-Hungarian Navy on 5 June 1910.|$|E

Within <b>a</b> <b>month</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half, the committee had raised approximately US$1,500 for the cause. In addition, a few days prior to the anarchists executions, the Círculo organized a demonstration of 2,000 people in Havana to protest the state's decision to execute the Americans. The Círculo and El Productor were both fined - the paper for an editorial written by Roig San Martín about the executions, and the Círculo for displaying a painting that commemorated the execution. The colonial government also prohibited the demonstrations that would be held every year on anniversary of the execution.|$|E

After <b>a</b> <b>month</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half, Brundage was discharged from the hospital, though whether the surgery had improved his vision was disputed, with Mariann Brundage stating that it did and Ruegsegger stating the contrary. Now frail, at age 87 he went with his wife on a final tour of the Far East. Despite the efforts of Olympic officials on his behalf, he was not given an invitation to mainland China, source {{of much of the}} art he loved. In April 1975, Brundage entered the hospital at Garmisch-Partenkirchen with flu and a severe cough. He died there on May 8, 1975, of heart failure.|$|E

He was invited to Beirut to discuss the death sentence, and was allowed to leave again, but {{it was clear that he}} had become persona non grata. As a result, the Iraqis gave him Fatah's assets in Iraq, including a training camp, farm, newspaper, radio station, passports, overseas scholarships and $15 million worth of Chinese weapons.

5|$|The 1961 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season featured {{the highest number}} of major hurricanes – Category3 or higher on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale – until being tied by 2005. The season officially began on June15, and lasted until November15. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. It was an above average season in terms of tropical storms, with a total of 11named storms. The first system, Hurricane Anna, developed in the eastern Caribbean Sea near the Windward Islands on July20. It brought minor damage to the islands, as well as wind and flood impacts to Central America after striking Belize as a hurricane. Anna caused one death and about $300,000 (1961USD) in damage. Activity went dormant for nearly <b>a</b> <b>month</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half, until Hurricane Betsy developed on September2. Betsy peaked as a Category4 hurricane, but remained at sea and caused no impact.|$|E
5|$|The Atlantic {{hurricane}} season officially began on June1, but activity in 1985 began more than <b>a</b> <b>month</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half {{later with the}} formation of Tropical Storm Ana on July15.

In addition, three tropical cyclone eventually attained major hurricane status, which is slightly above the 1981–2010 average of 2.7per season. The amount of activity is attributed to a La Niña that persisted since the previous season. Seven hurricanes and two tropical storms made landfall during the season, causing 302deaths and $5.54billion in damage.|$|E

During this time, President Lincoln and his cabinet reviewed the regiment and dubbed them the “Steady Fifth” due to their performance during the review. While encamped in Alexandria, the unit received new uniforms consisting of dark blue coats and trousers—the Regular Army uniform of the time. The 5th Massachusetts was one of very few volunteer units to take the field in Regular Army uniforms and were frequently mistaken for Regular troops during the Bull Run campaign.

5|$|Princess Royal {{served in}} the Battle of Heligoland Bight {{a month after the}} war began and then was sent to the Caribbean to prevent the German East Asia Squadron from using the Panama Canal. After the East Asia Squadron was sunk at the Battle of the Falkland Islands by the two Invincible-class battlecruisers, Princess Royal rejoined the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron. During the Battle of Dogger Bank she scored only a few hits, {{although}} one directly crippled the German armoured cruiser , which allowed the enemy vessel to be caught and sunk by the concentrated fire of the British battlecruisers. Shortly afterwards Princess Royal became the flagship of the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron, under the command of Rear Admiral Osmond Brock.

5|$|When Leo IV died in October 780, his {{sole heir}} {{was the young}} Constantine VI, his son by the Empress Irene of Athens. Due to Constantine's being underage, a regency was instituted under Irene, {{but this was not}} well {{received}} among leading officials. Not only was rule by a woman alien to the military-dominated establishment of the time, but Irene was also a confirmed iconophile, an adherent of the veneration of holy images. This was regarded as heresy by the state-sponsored doctrine of Iconoclasm, which was especially popular with the army and the officials loyal to Constantine V's memory. A number of them, including the Postal Logothete (foreign minister) Gregory, the former strategos (governor) of the Anatolic Theme Bardas and Constantine, the commander of the Excubitors guard regiment, consequently favoured the rise of Nikephoros to the imperial throne. Barely <b>a</b> <b>month</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half after Leo's death, the plot was discovered. Irene had the conspirators exiled, and Nikephoros and his younger brothers were ordained as priests, removing them from the line of succession.

However, there is another kind of SLA, called ratio-based SLA in this paper, which is also commonly used in practice, e.g. Amazon EC 2 (2015, [URL] where SLA is applied to a set of requests spanning a specific time period, e.g. <b>a</b> week or <b>a</b> <b>month,</b> <b>and</b> <b>an</b> SLA violation occurs when a predefined ratio of the requests cannot achieve the commitment defined in SLA.
