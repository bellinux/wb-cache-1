5|$|In March 2007, Silverstein {{appeared}} {{at a rally}} of construction workers and public officials outside an insurance industry conference. He highlighted {{what he describes as}} the failures of insurers Allianz and Royal & Sun Alliance to pay $800 million in claims related to the attacks.

5|$|Myers {{said that}} he was working on defense {{balloons}} that could stop them in case of an attack against the United States through a company in Chicago, known as the Chicago Captive Balloon Company.

Brady had refused food and fluids for more than 48 hours on various occasions, causing him to be fitted with a nasogastric tube, although his inquest noted that his body mass index was not <b>a</b> <b>cause</b> <b>for</b> concern.

5|$|Although these criticisms still {{form the}} {{prevailing}} {{view on the}} History's literary worth, modern scholars such as Rohrbacher have begun to argue that, while it is poorly written and not a stylistic or polished work, its use of allusion {{as a vehicle for}} parodying popular late 4th century biographical and historiographical works means that the very features which were once <b>a</b> <b>cause</b> <b>for</b> intense criticism (such as the inclusion of irrelevant or contradictory inventions alongside traditionally sourced material) are actually an intentional and integral part of the work, {{making it one of the}} most unique pieces of literature to emerge from the ancient world.|$|E
5|$|American {{broadcaster}} NBC Sports, {{who also}} owns the broadcast {{rights to the}} Olympics, has been criticised by athletes and IPC officials for airing too little coverage of the Paralympics; the lack of coverage from NBC in Athens was <b>a</b> <b>cause</b> <b>for</b> concern from senior IPC officials, especially given that the United States was bidding for the 2012 Games. In 2012 NBC only produced around 5 hours of tape delayed highlights from the Games, airing on the pay TV channel NBC Sports Network, and did not cover the ceremonies at all.|$|E
5|$|King William, {{using the}} {{treatment}} of Bishop John as <b>a</b> <b>cause</b> <b>for</b> war with Harald, brought a large army north in 12011202.

During this time, Earl Harald's son Thorfinn was captured by the Scots. Whether in revenge for {{the treatment of}} Bishop John, or to cow Harald, or because Thorfinn may have had some claim to the throne through his mother (the lady of Moray), he was blinded and castrated, dying soon later in prison.|$|E

5|$|Like their {{relatives}} the honeybees, bumblebees feed on nectar, using their long hairy tongues to lap up the liquid; the proboscis is folded under the head during flight. Bumblebees gather nectar {{to add to}} the stores in the nest, and pollen to feed their young. They forage using colour and spatial relationships to identify flowers to feed from. Some bumblebees rob nectar, making a hole near the base of a flower to access the nectar while avoiding pollen transfer. Bumblebees are important agricultural pollinators, so their decline in Europe, North America, and Asia is <b>a</b> <b>cause</b> <b>for</b> concern. The decline has been caused by habitat loss, the mechanisation of agriculture, and pesticides.|$|E
5|$|The {{frequency}} of defamation suits brought by Government ministers and PAP MPs against critics, in particular political opponents, has been <b>a</b> <b>cause</b> <b>for</b> concern for {{organizations such as}} the International Bar Association and the United States Department of State. Amnesty International has referred to the use of civil defamation suits as a strategy by the government to inhibit the public activities of opposition politicians. This is due to how high awards of damages often cripple opposition politicians financially, causing them to become bankrupt and thus lose their parliamentary seats or become ineligible to run for elections. The resulting perception is that Singapore's leadership has a long-standing reputation for using defamation actions as a mechanism for removing opposition members from the Singapore Parliament or for inhibiting opposing political views.|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} breed traits which may cause concern as health issues. They include skull {{issues such as}} an open fontanelle, where in young dogs there is a soft spot in the skull; it is common in dogs under a year old. A {{complication}} from that condition is hydrocephalus, also known as water on the brain. This condition may cause neurological symptoms that require the dog to be euthanised. Fused toes, where {{two or more of}} the dog's toes are fused together, may seem to be a health issue but this breed trait is not <b>a</b> <b>cause</b> <b>for</b> concern.|$|E
5|$|To {{termites}}, any {{breach of}} their tunnels or nests is <b>a</b> <b>cause</b> <b>for</b> alarm. When termites detect a potential breach, the soldiers usually bang their heads, apparently to attract other soldiers for defence and to recruit additional workers to repair any breach. Additionally, an alarmed termite bumps into other termites which {{causes them to}} be alarmed and to leave pheromone trails to the disturbed area, {{which is also a}} way to recruit extra workers.|$|E
5|$|Two groups claimed {{discovery}} of the element. Evidence of element 106 was first reported in 1974 by a Russian research team in Dubna led by Yuri Oganessian, in which targets of lead-208 and lead-207 were bombarded with accelerated ions of chromium-54. In total, fifty-one spontaneous fission events were observed with a half-life between four and ten milliseconds. After having ruled out nucleon transfer reactions as <b>a</b> <b>cause</b> <b>for</b> these activities, the team concluded that the most likely cause of the activities was the spontaneous fission of isotopes of element 106. The isotope in question was first suggested to be seaborgium-259, but was later corrected to seaborgium-260.|$|E

5|$|Video game critics gave Max Payne 2 highly {{positive}} reviews. Praise {{focused on}} its action and story, while criticism targeted its short length. Despite the positive reception, the game sold poorly, leading Rockstar Games' parent company Take-Two Interactive to cite Max Payne 2s sales as <b>a</b> <b>cause</b> <b>for</b> the company's reforecast finances of 2004. Max Payne 2 received several industry awards, including Outstanding Art Direction at the Golden Satellite Awards 2004, and Editors' Choice Awards from GamePro, IGN, and GameSpy.

5|$|Despite the {{accounts}} of the Irish annals, English and Scandinavian writers appear to see Mac Bethad as the rightful king of Moray: this is clear from their descriptions of the meeting with Cnut in 1027, before the death of Malcolm mac Máil Brigti. Malcolm was followed as king or earl by his brother Gillecomgan, husband of Gruoch, a granddaughter of King Kenneth III. It has been supposed that Mac Bethad {{was responsible for the}} killing of Gille Coemgáin in 1032, but if Mac Bethad had <b>a</b> <b>cause</b> <b>for</b> feud in the killing of his father in 1020, Malcolm too had reason to see Gille Coemgáin dead. Not only had Gillecomgan's ancestors killed many of Malcolm's kin, but Gillecomgan and his son Lulach might be rivals for the throne. Malcolm had no living sons, and the threat to his plans for the succession was obvious. As a result, the following year Gruoch's brother or nephew, who might have eventually become king, was killed by Malcolm.|$|E
5|$|In a {{statement}} on its website, ReactOS cited differing legal definitions of what constitutes clean-room reverse engineering as <b>a</b> <b>cause</b> <b>for</b> the conflict. Some countries, including the United States, require that a reimplementation based on disassembled code must be written by someone other than the person having disassembled and examined the original code, whereas other countries allow both tasks to be performed by the same individual. Consequently, ReactOS clarified that its Intellectual Property Policy Statement requirements on clean room reverse engineering conform to US law. An internal source code audit was conducted to ensure that only clean room reverse engineering was used, and all developers were made to sign an agreement committing them {{to comply with the}} project's policies on reverse engineering. Contributors to its development were not affected by these events, and all access to the software development tools was restored shortly afterward. In September 2007, with the audit nearing completion, the audit status was removed from the ReactOS homepage. Though the audit was completed, specific details were not made public as it was only an internal effort to ensure compliance with the project's own policies.|$|E
