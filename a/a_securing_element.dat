40|$|Abstract—Near Field Communication (NFC) is one {{the most}} recent {{technologies}} {{in the area of}} application development and service delivery via mobile phone. NFC enables the mobile phone to act as identification and a credit card for customers. Dynamic relationships of NFC ecosystem players in an NFC transaction process make them partners in a way that sometimes they should share their access permissions on the applications that are running in the service environment. One of the technologies {{that can be used to}} ensure secure NFC transactions is cloud computing which offers wide range advantages compare to the use of <b>a</b> <b>Secure</b> <b>Element</b> (SE) as <b>a</b> single entity in an NFC enabled mobile phone. In this paper, we propose a protocol based on the concept of NFC mobile payments. Accordingly, we present an extended version of the NFC cloud Wallet model [14], in which, the <b>Secure</b> <b>Element</b> in the mobile device is used for customer authentication whereas the customer's banking credentials are stored in a cloud under the control of the Mobile Network Operator (MNO). In this circumstance, Mobile Network Operator plays the role of network carrier which is responsible for controlling all the credentials transferred to the end user. The proposed protocol eliminates the requirement of a shared secret between the Point-of-Sale (POS) and the Mobile Network Operator before execution of the protocol, a mandatory requirement in the earlier version of this protocol [16]. This makes it more practicable and user friendly. At the end, we provide a detailed analysis of the protocol where we discuss multiple attack scenarios...|$|R

40|$|The {{emergence}} of the NFC (Near Field Communication) technology brings new capacities {{to the next generation}} of smartphones, but also new security and privacy challenges. Indeed through its contactless interactions with external entities, the smartphone of an individual will become an essential authentication tool for service providers such as transport operators. However, {{from the point of view}} of the user, carrying a part of the service through his smartphone could be a threat for his privacy. Indeed, an external attacker or the service provider himself could be tempted to track the actions of the user. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving contactless mobile service, in which a user’s identity cannot be linked to his actions when using the transport system. The security of our proposition relies on the combination of <b>a</b> <b>secure</b> <b>element</b> in the smartphone and on a privacy-enhancing cryptographic protocol based on a variant of group signatures. In addition, although a user should remain anonymous and his actions unlinkable in his daily journeys, we designed a technique for lifting his anonymity in extreme circumstances.

40|$|Part 1 : Research PapersInternational audienceAuthentication is a {{prerequisite}} for proper access control to many eservices. Often, it is carried out by identifying the user, while generally, verification of certified attributes would suffice. Even worse, this kind of authentication makes all the user’s transactions linkable and discloses an excessive amount of personal information, and thus erodes the user’s privacy. This is in clear contradiction to the data minimization principle put forth in the European data protection legislation. In this paper, we present data-minimizing mobile authentication, which is a kind of attribute-based authentication through the use of anonymous credentials, thereby revealing substantially less personal information about the user. We describe two typical scenarios, design an architecture, and discuss a prototype implemented on a smart phone which minimizes the disclosure of personal data in a user-to-terminal authentication setting. The prototype uses the Identity Mixer anonymous credential system (Idemix) and realizes short-range communication between the smart phone and the terminal using visual channels over which QR codes are exchanged. Furthermore, the security has been improved and unauthorized sharing of credentials prevented by storing the credentials’ secret key in <b>a</b> <b>secure</b> <b>element</b> hosted by the mobile phone. Our measurements show that the use of smart phones for data-minimizing authentication can be an actual “game changer” for a broad deployment of anonymous credential systems...|$|R

Such applications, which may involve mobile ticketing, identification, access control operations, etc., are often accessible through social network aggregators, that assume {{a fundamental role in}} the federated identity management space. While this makes modern smartphones very powerful devices, it also makes them very attractive targets for spyware injection. This kind of malware is able to bypass classic authentication measures and steal user credentials even when <b>a</b> <b>secure</b> <b>element</b> is used, and can, therefore, perform unauthorized mobile access to social network services without the user’s consent. Such an event allows stealing sensitive information or even a full identity theft. In this work, we address this issue by introducing BrightPass, a novel authentication mechanism based on screen brightness. BrightPass allows users to authenticate safely with a PIN- based confirmation in the presence of specific operations on sensitive data. We compare BrightPass with existing schemes, in order to show its usability and security within the social network arena.

For instance, mobile applications have evolved in different sectors such as healthcare patient support, geographic mapping and positioning, banking, e-commerce payment services and others. This study focuses {{on one of the most}} sensitive applications, which is mobile payment. Mobile payment system being one of the widely expanding mobile services, it has security concerns that prevented its wide acceptance. Some of the main security services given prior attention in mobile payment are issues of privacy, authentication and confidentiality. The research concentrates on the strong authentication of a mobile client to its server, securing the credit card* information and use of mobile card reader while making payments that enable customers to protect privacy of financial credentials. The strong authentication mechanism mainly follows the NIST standard publications namely, FIPS PUB 201 and FIPS 196; which are standards on Entity Authentication using public key cryptography and PKI credential storage Personal Identity Verification (PIV) card respectively. The proposed secure Credit Card Information (CCI) storage is in <b>a</b> <b>secure</b> <b>element</b> in order to prevent tampering of stored data. The <b>secure</b> <b>element</b> options are microSD, UICC, Smartcard (together with digital certificate and service ticket). During making payments, the payment information encrypted using a shared key is securely sent to payment server. A demo mobile application as proof of concept was implemented in a simulated lab (KTH SecLab), which has all the necessary infrastructure setup (servers, card reader) for testing the proposed solution.

40|$|This thesis explores how {{hardware}} security technologies can {{be applied}} to satisfy the diverse set of requirements inherent to identity management systems and technologies. This thesis focuses on the use of existing hardware-based security technologies by software rather than developing new hardware components. All concepts proposed in this thesis are subjected to an in-depth evaluation and are validated by means of a prototype. The first part of this thesis deals with device authentication between resource-constrained nodes and more powerful devices. A security architecture is presented that allows low-cost resource-constrained devices to establish <b>a</b> <b>secure</b> authenticated channel with more powerful devices using symmetric-key cryptography. The constrained devices can enforce fine-grained access control policies based on the information obtained during authentication. In application domains with a limited scope a tamper-resistant module containing a common cryptographic key can be added to the constrained devices to increase the scalability of the key management process. In the second part of this thesis a new user-centric identity management system is presented. Instead of relying on digital signature algorithms to assert the validity of attributes to service providers, the identity management system proposed in this part relies on a trusted application running on <b>a</b> tamperproof <b>secure</b> <b>element.</b> The service provider is assured that the received information originates from <b>a</b> genuine <b>secure</b> <b>element</b> in the system. The tamperproofness ensures that an attacker cannot directly access the memory of the <b>secure</b> <b>element</b> to extract or modify information. The identity management system combines several interesting features of existing governmental and federated identity management systems. In the third part of this thesis a trusted execution environment that can be established on commodity workstations and laptops using TPM-based technologies is used to increase the security and privacy of existing identity management technologies. Two complementary case studies are presented. The first case study focuses on the prevention of credential abuse through sharing or theft. The user's credential is, therefore, bound to one or more of his biometric traits. The second case study focuses on increasing the security and privacy of authentication infrastructures that rely on a smart card containing an X. 509 credential and the identity information of the user. The system increases the security by allowing the user to enter his passcode via his workstation while protecting it from malware running on the operating system. The system increases the privacy of the user by giving the user more control over the disclosure of his information. nrpages: 136 status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{adoption of}} mobile devices applications {{in daily life}} activities such as payments, identification, {{authorization and access control}} represents a new challenge from the security perspective, since private or sensitive data is being used in an untrusted environment (the mobile device). In this sense, one of the objectives of mobile computing for the near future is to make mobile devices suitable for security-sensitive applications. Since the past decades, secure microcontrollers have been successfully implemented to create smartcards, which have been used to secure banking, transport, access and identification cards. Today, the smartcards have evolved to <b>Secure</b> <b>Elements</b> to be integrated in smartphones, wearables, IoT nodes, and all kind of mobile devices. <b>Secure</b> <b>Elements</b> are computing units encapsulated in an integrated circuit that are capable of securely host and execute applications, store cryptographic material and perform cryptographic operations in <b>a</b> <b>secure</b> environment. The success of <b>Secure</b> <b>Elements</b> is based on their capability to act as physical root of trust for applications and services that require high degree of security in a resource constrained device. In the near future, the massive integration of <b>secure</b> <b>element</b> in mobile devices will enable new kind of security-critical applications to be performed by mobile devices ensuring privacy, authenticity and integrity of data. Identification and passports will be securely embedded in mobile devices, wallet applications will be extensively used, access control to multi-owner vehicles, ticketing, transportation, authentication of IoT nodes, authorization of vehicles in low-emission zones, and all kind of applications requiring secure storage and tamper protection will become feasible from the security point of view. <b>Secure</b> <b>Elements</b> are currently integrated in mobile devices through UICC cards, embedded chips soldered to the mother board or to some extent, smartSD cards. They can be accessed directly through the NFC interface or through the application processor. When the SE is accessed through the NFC interface the communications are routed through the NFC controller, without intervention of the mobile operating system. When the communication is performed from an application running in the application processor, the application require system level permissions that are not usually given to regular applications. Therefore, access to <b>secure</b> <b>elements</b> is currently controlled by a few players and not widely open to application developers, researchers or academics. Nevertheless, there is still a broad field of study around <b>secure</b> <b>elements.</b> This work address several sources of uncertainty around <b>secure</b> <b>elements,</b> including communication interfaces and protocols, development platforms and key capabilities of <b>secure</b> <b>elements</b> which are currently available in the market. The conclusions derived from this work reaffirm that <b>secure</b> <b>elements</b> are promising solutions to secure mobile devices, relying in software and hardware mechanisms to guarantee the desired security properties...|$|R
