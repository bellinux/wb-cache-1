Sue and Ali rush his lifeless body to local nurse, Andy O'Brien (Ross Davidson), but Hassan is already dead. A postmortem reveals no definitive cause of death, {{so it is}} concluded that he died during his sleep from cot death. After discovering Hassan's body, Sue goes into shock. She remains in a trance like state for weeks, refusing to eat, sleep, cry or acknowledge her own grief. She later begins blaming herself unfairly for her son's sudden and unexplainable death. Her mental health continues to deteriorate and she becomes despondent towards Ali; their marriage disintegrates in <b>a</b> <b>welter</b> <b>of</b> depression. Sue eventually manages {{to come to terms}} with Hassan's death with the help of Dr Legg (Leonard Fenton), who takes the desperate measure of placing Mary's baby, Annie, in her lap, allowing her, finally, to acknowledge her pent-up sadness.|$|E
25|$|Napoleon {{spent three}} days resting his troops at Reims while Marshal Michel Ney reoccupied Châlons-sur-Marne. Ney was joined by a 3,000-man {{division}} that Jan Willem Janssens brought in from the Ardennes garrisons. The French emperor desired to move east to gather up other garrisons, but Schwarzenberg's offensive to the south compelled him to march in that direction. While Napoleon operated against Blücher in the north, the main Allied army pressed MacDonald back toward Paris. On 27 February, Schwarzenberg defeated Oudinot in the Battle of Bar-sur-Aube, forcing MacDonald to withdraw to the west. The Allies overpowered MacDonald on 3–4 March at the Battle of Laubressel. Schwarzenberg occupied Troyes but halted there until 12 March in <b>a</b> <b>welter</b> <b>of</b> indecision. Encouraged by news of Blucher's victory at Laon, the main Allied army crossed the Seine River and drove MacDonald beyond Provins by 16 March. Schwarzenberg's offensive came to a sudden halt when tidings of Napoleon's success at Reims arrived in the Allied camp.|$|E

[...] The Independent critic Andy Gill noted that [...] "despite the occasional furtive flourish of acoustic guitar, her work on this debut album is more akin to the retro-synthpop of Little Boots and La Roux, thanks to the thoroughness with which production partner Fin Dow-Smith has smothered her folkie origins under <b>a</b> <b>welter</b> <b>of</b> busily cycling synths and programmed beats." [...] Spins Caryn Ganz referred to the album as [...] "hiny, wholesome dance-pop, {{with a dash of}} saucy" [...] on which Goulding [...] "glides through blippy anthems , pumping disco , and delicate grooves [...] with a pixie-ish voice that's one notch sweeter than Metric's Emily Haines." [...] Pitchfork Media's Stephen Troussé wrote, [...] "Outside of its immediate context, Lights is a sometimes great, always promising debut. It's an album about leaving home, and it works best when the contrast between the folk singer and the pop production chimes with the tensions between the pull of home and the allure of the city." [...] Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone expressed that Goulding has [...] "a classic British folkie's voice—the kind of tremulous soprano that evokes a wintry day on a fog-swaddled moor.

One common result to be found in these conflicting uses of pragmatic doctrines is a loss of the distinctively pragmatic philosophic vision which defies assimilation and which dissolves in the dismembering of its parts. What such endeavors further have in common is a failure to adequately recognize the nature of the scientific method to which pragmatic thought is linked and which provides the key to the unity of its systematic vision. It is this key which the present paper proposes to use to explore, in broad outlines, the depth and breadth of the pragmatic vision as offering a unique well structured and systematic conceptual paradigm.
