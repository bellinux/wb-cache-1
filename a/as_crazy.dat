5|$|In 2001, Electronic Arts and Fox Entertainment {{released}} , {{which has}} been labelled a rip-off of the Crazy Taxi formula by game reviewers. In this game, the player controlled one of The Simpsons characters as they drive about Springfield, taking passengers to their destinations {{in the same manner}} <b>as</b> <b>Crazy</b> Taxi. Sega sued Fox Entertainment, Electronic Arts, and developer Radical Games Ltd. over infringement of the 138 patent. The case, Sega of America, Inc. v. Fox Interactive, et al., was settled in private for an unknown amount. The 138 patent itself remains valid, and is considered {{to be one of the}} most important patents in video game development today.|$|E
5|$|Cave Story 3D is a 3D {{version of}} the game {{developed}} by Nicalis and published by NIS America as a retail title for the Nintendo 3DS. It was released on 8 November 2011 in North America, 11 November 2011 in Europe and 26 July 2012 in Japan. The game was built from scratch using 3D character models, featuring a dynamic camera system and another additional level, {{as well as a}} remixed soundtrack by Danny Baranowsky. The Japanese version features crossover content from various NIS and other companies' franchises such <b>as</b> <b>Crazy</b> Climber, Ikki, and Dragon Slayer. In order to devote more time to perfecting the title, Amaya quit his job as a software developer to become director of Cave Story 3D. He remarked that the transition to 3D was difficult because it required the consideration of so many more details.|$|E

25|$|Milligan {{returned}} to jazz {{in the late}} 1940s and made a precarious living with the Hall trio and other musical comedy acts. He was also trying {{to break into the}} world of radio, as a performer or script writer. His first success in radio was as writer for comedian Derek Roy's show. After a delayed start, Milligan, Peter Sellers, Harry Secombe and Michael Bentine joined forces in a relatively radical comedy project, The Goon Show. During its first season the BBC titled the show <b>as</b> <b>Crazy</b> People, or in full, The Junior Crazy Gang featuring those Crazy People, the Goons!, an attempt to make the programme palatable to BBC officials, by connecting it with the popular group of theatre comedians known as The Crazy Gang.|$|E
25|$|Players {{can select}} three-, five- or ten-minute settings, or the Arcade Rules {{used in the}} {{original}} coin-op version of the game. In the three time-limited settings, play continues for the designated period of time, after which the cab automatically stops and no more points can be scored. Under Arcade Rules, the player starts with an initial time limit of one minute, which can be extended through time bonuses earned for quick deliveries. Console versions of the game also feature a mode known <b>as</b> <b>Crazy</b> Box, a set of minigames that feature challenges such as picking up and dropping off a number of customers within a time limit, bowling using the taxi as a ball, and popping giant balloons in a field.|$|E
25|$|This Lingering Life (2015) premiered at the Theatre of Yugen. The {{play was}} {{inspired}} by 14th century Japanese Noh plays, which Miyagawa studied in Japan during her Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study Fellowship. The play retells nine ancient Japanese stories with 27 characters, all which have no names. Miyagawa {{said in an interview}} that the characters, “they are identified by their types, such <b>as</b> <b>Crazy</b> Woman, Mystical Warrior, Woman with Tragic Hair, and Gangster on the Run, in an attempt to create sympathetic characters without making them into our neighbors.” The play received critical acclaim. The Huffington Post said, “Miyagawa's plays, this one especially, sit somewhere between this world and another world. They also commit so fully to their own aesthetic that I usually find myself pondering the fascinating rules of this alternate existence hours or even days later (this lingering life indeed).” The New Yorker praised the play as” clever, stylish, and often funny”.|$|E

25|$|Socrates then broaches {{the initial}} {{question}} of whether virtue is one or many things, himself claiming that all virtue is knowledge and therefore one. He argues that the reason people act harmfully, to others or themselves, is because they only see the short term gains while ignoring the long term losses which might outweigh them, just like one makes errors in judging the size of objects that are far away. He says that if men were taught the art of calculating these things correctly, have a more exact knowledge that is, they would not act harmfully (357c–358d). Same goes for bravery. A brave swimmer is one {{who knows how to}} swim better and therefore, in a way, all virtues are essentially knowledge and can be considered one and the same, more like parts of golden objects (as discussed above) rather than the parts of a face. While Socrates seems to have won the argument, he points to the fact that if all virtue is knowledge, it can in fact be taught. He draws the conclusion that to an observer he and Protagoras would seem <b>as</b> <b>crazy,</b> having argued at great lengths only to mutually exchanged positions with Socrates now believing that virtue can be taught and Protagoras that all virtues are one instead of his initial position (361a). Protagoras acknowledges Socrates a notable opponent in dispute while being much younger than he and predicts that he could become one of the wisest men alive. Socrates departs for whatever business he claimed he had when he wanted to end the dialogue earlier.|$|E

On July 22, 2012, Crazy, along with Ricky Marvin, defeated Special Assault Team (Atsushi Aoki and Kotaro Suzuki), winning the GHC Heavyweight Junior Tag Team Championship. On September 20, Crazy and Marvin made their debuts for Wrestling New Classic (WNC), defeating El Hijo del Pantera and Yusuke Kodama in a tag team match. On March 10, 2013, Crazy and Marvin lost the GHC Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship to Genba Hirayanagi and Maybach Taniguchi, Jr. Crazy spent {{the first six months}} of 2013 in Mexico. However, {{he returned}} to NOAH in June with his nephew Pesadilla, in the Southern Navigation tour. On July 2013, Los Mexitosos entered in the NTV G+ Cup Junior Heavyweight Tag League for the vacant GHC Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship. However, they won six points. On late 2013, Crazy and Pesadilla returned to NOAH <b>as</b> <b>Crazy</b> Dynasty. The duo wrestled a losing effort to Jushin Thunder Liger and Tiger Mask IV on November 11 for the GHC Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship. In 2014 Super Crazy and Mistic Azteca founded their own independent wrestling organization, World of Unpredictable Wrestling Mexico. Super Crazy made a return to NOAH yet again on March 8, 2014, at the 'Great Voyage in Tokyo' show where he won a three way dance against Jonah Rock and Xtra Large. He continued to make appearances for NOAH throughout 2014 including teaming with Matt Striker in the 2014 Junior Heavyweight Tag League. The pair finished third in their block with four points and after another two-month hiatus, Super Crazy received a GHC Junior Heavyweight Championship opportunity against champion Daisuke Harada at 'Great Voyage in Yokohama' on October 12. Crazy lost the match and returned to teaming under the Crazy Dynasty name with Pesadilla throughout the year, culminating in a losing effort to Kenoh and Hajime Ohara in a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match for the GHC Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championships on December 27 at Korakuen Hall.|$|E

5000|$|Steve Gerber, {{who served}} <b>as</b> <b>Crazys</b> editor from issues #11-14, and {{wanted it to}} be {{distinctive}} from the archteypal Mad, said that the goal was to present work that implied the creators were themselves insane.

500|$|For example, the {{steering}} column on Kitenge's Land Rover {{is placed on}} the right side of the car. At one point in the episode, the Simpsons visit the Maasai people, a Nilotic ethnic group of semi-nomadic people located in Kenya and northern Tanzania. The way that some of the Maasai people in the episode are dancing is also true to a traditional dance performed by Maasai people in real life, and although the drinking of cow blood is faithful to the Maasai people's culture, the use of lip plates and neck rings are not. [...] "That was kind of fun for me to try to make this stuff [...] <b>as</b> <b>crazy</b> as the story is, [...] make it realistic", Kirkland commented on directing the episode.|$|E
500|$|Nordby {{said most}} of the {{attention}} was devoted to Jennifer's face and that [...] "very quickly in combination" [...] with special effects and makeup, MPC thought up a five-station system for what Jennifer goes through. Nordby stated:Stage one is beautiful Jennifer and then two and three were strictly makeup where her eyes become more recessed and she would start to look plain like the rest of us. And stage four was some custom dentures that KNB made for her, and then visual effects in stage four was mainly facial warping and recessing her eyes some more and having a pinning effect to her irises {{and a variety of other}} musculature deforms, just bringing her cheek bones down more. And stage five was the full on, <b>as</b> <b>crazy</b> as it gets, which you don't really see until near the end.|$|E
500|$|In May 2007, Lonsdale {{appeared}} on BBC's Panorama {{program in a}} piece titled [...] "Scientology and Me", and was interviewed about his experiences as a critic of Scientology by journalist John Sweeney.

[...] During their interview, Tommy Davis arrived, opened a folder, and began to read out loud Lonsdale's criminal record.

500|$|A children's {{adventure}} park is sited at {{the eastern}} end of the seafront.

The pier is an obvious place to visit and is sometimes used to hold events, such as the international birdman competition held annually, although cancelled in 2005 due to lack of competitors. An annual raft competition takes place where competitors, usually local businesses, circumnavigate the pier in a raft made by themselves, while being attacked by a water-cannon. A major event in the tourist calendar of Eastbourne, now the world's biggest seafront air show, is the annually held 4 day, international air show, [...] "Airbourne".

500|$|The actress {{described}} {{the filming of}} the rape as easier than the scenes depicting its aftermath, which she called [...] "psychologically ..... physically hard". Strickland and Brendon agreed on a safeword when they filmed the rape, due to its brutality. The scene affected Strickland {{to the extent that}} she found it difficult to act on the set on which the rape was shot. The actress called the filming process [...] "intense" [...] and [...] "truthful", but [...] "by no means is any of that even comparable to anything that women and men have had experience with". Brendon was cast against type as McHenry, King's rapist, since he is primarily known for portraying the comedic Xander Harris in Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Strickland said that Brendon's character should not be interpreted <b>as</b> <b>crazy,</b> because perpetrators of rape are [...] "people who are around us all the time"; she called Brendon's acceptance of the role [...] "brave".|$|E
500|$|From {{the first}} game of the season, however, those preseason {{predictions}} were cast into doubt. Virginia Tech lost its season opener to lightly regarded East Carolina, while Clemson lost to Alabama. Though neither loss factored into either team's conference standings, it reflected the early stages of a conference schedule that was regarded <b>as</b> <b>crazy,</b> wacky, [...] "a mess", and [...] "confusing" [...] by members of the media and college football fans. So closely matched were the 12 teams of the conference that as late as the second-to-last week of the regular season, nine teams were still in the running for a place in the championship game. Heading into the final week of the regular season, four teams were still in position to potentially participate in the game: Georgia Tech and Virginia Tech from the Coastal Division, and Boston College and Florida State from the Atlantic Division. In that final week, Virginia Tech clinched the Coastal Division co-championship with a 17–14 win over Virginia, while Boston College became co-champions of the Atlantic Division with a 28–21 win against Maryland.|$|E
