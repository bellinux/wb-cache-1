60|$|Let us now {{bring our}} {{conclusion}} {{to the test}} of the Method of Difference. Setting out from the cases already mentioned, in which the antecedent {{is the presence of}} substances forming with the tissues a compound incapable of putrefaction, (and a fortiori incapable of the chemical actions which constitute life), and the consequent is death, either of the whole organism, or of some portion of it; let us compare with these cases other cases, as much resembling them as possible, but in which that effect is not produced. And, first, “many insoluble basic salts of <b>arsenious</b> <b>acid</b> are known not to be poisonous. The substance called alkargen, discovered by Bunsen, which contains a very large quantity of arsenic, and approaches very closely in composition to the organic arsenious compounds found in the body, has not the slightest injurious action upon the organism.” Now when these substances are brought into contact with the tissues in any way, they do not combine with them; they do not arrest their progress to decomposition. As far, therefore, as these instances go, it appears that when the effect is absent, it is by reason of the absence of that antecedent which we had already good ground for considering as the proximate cause.|$|R

This study investigated the influence of membrane orientation and organic fouling on the performance of FO membrane in removing boron and arsenic. Results of laboratory-scale crossflow membrane filtration experiments showed that the inorganic contaminants were rejected at a much lower rate when membrane active layer was facing draw solution (AL-DS) compared to the active layer-facing feed water (AL-FW) orientation, {{as a result of the}} more severe concentrative internal concentration polarization (ICP) in the latter orientation. The difference in boron rejection between the two membrane orientations was greater due to its higher permeability through the FO membrane. In the AL-FW orientation, the formation of an alginate fouling layer on the membrane surface could enhance the sieving effect and thus improve the rejection of <b>arsenious</b> <b>acid</b> with relatively larger molecular size. In the AL-DS orientation, alginate fouling in the membrane support layer had adverse effect on boron rejection at water flux below 4. 2 μm/s (15. 3 L/m 2 /h), attributed to the foulant enhanced concentrative ICP effect.

40|$|XIDATION OF ORGANIC MATERIAL as a {{preliminary}} to determination of iodine, whether by wet or dry methods, entails loss of iodine if in-sufficient organic matter is present during the reaction (1, 2, 3). In blood serum, the organic content suffices {{to prevent this}} loss when the amount of iodine in the specimen is in the range found in physiological or patho-logical sera, 0 - 30 pg. / 100 ml., as has been repeatedly shown in recovery experiments (4, 5, 6, 7). When the iodine content of serum exceeds 500 ig. / 100 ml., as is sometimes the case after administration of iodinated radiopaque media, or other contact with iodinated medication, iodine may be volatilized in the ashing stage of the analysis, to be reabsorbed in other tubes.

60|$|But the {{rigorous}} {{conditions of the}} Method of Difference are not yet satisfied; for {{we can not be}} sure that these unpoisonous bodies agree with the poisonous substances in every property, except the particular one of entering into a difficultly decomposable compound with the animal tissues. To render the method strictly applicable, we need an instance, not of a different substance, but of one of the very same substances, in circumstances which would prevent it from forming, with the tissues, the sort of compound in question; and then, if death does not follow, our case is made out. Now such instances are afforded by the antidotes to these poisons. For example, in case of poisoning by <b>arsenious</b> <b>acid,</b> if hydrated peroxide of iron is administered, the destructive agency is instantly checked. Now this peroxide is known to combine with the acid, and form a compound, which, being insoluble, can not act at all on animal tissues. So, again, sugar is a well-known antidote to poisoning by salts of copper; and sugar reduces those salts either into metallic copper, or into the red sub-oxide, neither of which enters into combination with animal matter. The disease called painter’s colic, so common in manufactories of white-lead, is unknown where the workmen are accustomed to take, as a preservative, sulphuric acid lemonade (a solution of sugar rendered acid by sulphuric acid).

30|$|Arsenic (As) is a toxic and non-degradable {{metalloid}} {{present in}} the environment in both the organic (i.e., monomethyl arsenate—MMA, dimethyl arsenate—DMA) and inorganic (i.e., arsenite, <b>arsenious</b> <b>acid,</b> arsenate, and arsenic acid) forms (Kumaresan and Riyazuddin 2001). For inorganic As, four main oxidation states commonly exist: As− 3 (arsine), As 0 (elemental arsenic), As+ 3 (arsenite), and As+ 5 (Arsenate). As {{contamination of the environment}} is a matter of concern since As accumulates in environment and enters the food chain through drinking water and crops (Chakraborty et al. 2014; Alam et al. 2016). The main sources of As groundwater contamination can be both natural and anthropogenic (ref). Naturally As enters groundwater via leaching, rock weathering, volcanic eruption, geochemical reaction, and biological activity (Kanel et al. 2005 a, b). Common anthropogenic As sources include timber treatment with copper chrome arsenate, fertilizers from agriculture sources, and a variety of pharmaceutical, glass, and other chemical activities. As contamination of groundwater has caused havoc in over 70 countries of the world affecting around 150 million people (Ravenscroft et al. 2009). In Bangladesh and India alone, 70 million people are at risk, due to exposure to high concentrations of As in drinking water (Niu et al. 2007). Several diseases like dysfunction of the respiratory system, injury to the nervous system, hepatomegaly, hypertension, and diseases of the peripheral vascular and cardiovascular system with lungs, kidney, liver, skin, large intestine, buccal cavity, urinary track, bone rectum cancer has been reported from this region (Guan et al. 2012). Due to such increasing effect of As, WHO has set permissible limit of As in drinking water as 10  µg/L (WHO 1993).|$|R

Prompt clinical improvement usually follows and the mortality is undoubtedly greatly lowered. With inoculated blackhead recovery is more difficult to obtain. Birds treated by injections of either neoarsphenamine or atoxyl failed to recover. There were two recoveries among three tryparsamidetreated cases. An attempt to cure inoculated blackhead at an advanced stage by the injection of tryparsamide failed. The study of the lesions of treated turkeys shows that tryparsamide, and to some extent neoarsphenamine, have a more pronounced effect on the liver lesions than on the disease in the lung, which accounts for the discrepancy in the results of the treatment of spontaneous and inoculated blackhead. There is histological evidence of prompt absorption of necrotic liver parenchyma; moreover, the protozoa are destroyed more rapidly in the liver than in the lung.

In 1982, Prof. Yoshimura and his friends established the Japanese Association of Forensic Toxicology, consisting of people from legal medicine, pharmacy and police institutes. This Association enabled lively discussions among different fields and greatly contributed to advances of forensic toxicology in Japan. We started studies of forensic toxicology using gas chromatography (GC) /mass spectrometry (MS) in 1979. Until now, we delt with solid-phase extraction (1987 ～ 1994), surface ionization GC (1989 ～ 1997), negative ion chemical ionization MS (1981 ～now), solid-phase microextraction (1994 ～now), cryogenic oven trapping GC (1997 ～now), surface ionization organic MS (1998 ～now) and high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem MS (1998 ～now). In this review, the author presents some details of solid-phase microextraction, negative ion chemical ionization MS, cryogenic oven trapping GC and surface ionization organic MS.

40|$|The main {{objectives}} of this dissertation were: (i) to develop experimental and analytical procedures to quantify different physico-chemical {{properties of the}} ultra-thin (~ 100 nm) active layers of reverse osmosis (RO) and nanofiltration (NF) membranes and their interactions with contaminants; (ii) to use such procedures to evaluate {{the similarities and differences}} between the active layers of different RO/NF membranes; and (iii) to relate characterization results to membrane performance. Such objectives were motivated by the current limited understanding of the physico-chemical properties of active layers as a result of traditional characterization techniques having limitations associated with the nanometer-scale spatial resolution required to study these ultra-thin films. Functional groups were chosen as the main active layer property of interest. Specific accomplishments of this study include the development of procedures to quantify in active layers as a function of pH: (1) the concentration of both negatively and positively ionized functional groups; (2) the stoichiometry of association between ions (i. e., barium) and ionized functional groups (i. e., carboxylate and sulfonate); and (3) the steric effects experienced by ions (i. e., barium). Conceptual and mathematical models were developed to describe experimental results. The depth heterogeneity of the active layer physico-chemical properties and interactions with contaminants studied in this dissertation was also characterized. Additionally, measured concentrations of ionized functional groups in the polyamide active layers of several commercial RO/NF membranes were used as input in a simplified RO/NF transport model to predict the rejection of a strong electrolyte (i. e., potassium iodide) and a weak <b>acid</b> (i. e., <b>arsenious</b> <b>acid)</b> at different pH values based on rejection results at one pH condition.

The values of partition coefficients for <b>arsenious</b> <b>acid</b> (H 3 AsO 3) between an aqueous solution (pure H 2 O) and its saturated vapor (K = mAsvapor /mAsliquid) {{were found to be}} independent of As(III) solution concentrations (up to not, vert, similar 1 to 2 mol As/kg) and equal to 0. 012 ± 0. 003, 0. 063 ± 0. 023, and 0. 145 ± 0. 020 at 250, 300, and 350 °C, respectively. These results are interpreted by the formation, in the vapor phase, of As(OH) 3 (gas), similar to the aqueous As hydroxide complex dominant in the liquid phase. Arsenic chloride or sulfide gaseous complexes were found to be negligible in the presence of HCl or H 2 S (up to not, vert, similar 0. 5 mol/kg of vapor). XAFS spectroscopic measurements carried out on As(III) -H 2 O (±NaCl) solutions up to 500 °C demonstrate that the As(OH) 3 complex dominates As speciation both in dense H 2 O-NaCl fluids and low-density supercritical vapor. Vapor-liquid partition coefficients for As(III) measured in the H 2 O-NaCl system up to 450 °C are consistent with the As speciation derived from these spectroscopic measurements and can be described by a simple relationship {{as a function of the}} vapor-to-liquid density ratio and temperature. Arsenic(III) partitioning between vapor and As-concentrated solutions (> 2 mol As/kg) or As 2 O 3 solid is consistent with the formation, in the vapor phase, of both As 4 O 6 and As(OH) 3. Arsenic(V) (arsenic acid, H 3 AsO 4) vapor-liquid partitioning at 350 °C for dilute aqueous solution was interpreted by the formation of AsO(OH) 3 in the vapor phase. The results obtained were combined with the corresponding properties for the aqueous As(III) hydroxide species to generate As(OH) 3 (gas) thermodynamic parameters. Equilibrium calculations carried out by using these data indicate that As(OH) 3 (gas) is by far the most dominant As complex in both volcanic gases and boiling hydrothermal systems. This species is likely to be responsible for the preferential partition of arsenic into the vapor phase as observed in fluid inclusions from high-temperature (400 to 700 °C) Au-Cu (-Sn, -W) magmatic-hydrothermal ore deposits. The results of this study imply that hydrolysis and hydration could be also important for other metals and metalloids in the H 2 O-vapor phase. These processes should be taken into account to accurately model element fractionation and chemical equilibria during magma degassing and fluid boiling...|$|R
40|$|It {{was thought}} that the {{kinetics}} of oxidation of organic compounds by nitric acid would provide a suitable topic for research for two reasons: although nitric acid is commonly used as an oxidising agent in preparative work - for example {{in the preparation of}} adipic acid from cyclohexanol - very {{little is known about the}} kinetics and mechanism of these reactions, and further, oxidations by nitric acid might be inherently irreproducible. The kinetics of oxidation by strong aqueous nitric acid does not appear to have been investigated at all. Most references in the literature to the rate of oxidation of organic compounds by nitric acid are confined to statements that an induction period exists and is followed by violent reaction. The kinetics and mechanism of the oxidation of <b>arsenious</b> <b>acid</b> by dilute nitric acid has been investigated and discussed by Abel, Schmid and Weiss. They investigate the reaction in media up to 2. 5 N with respect to nitric acid, and 0. 1 N with respect to nitrous acid, and in an atmosphere of NO. The rate of reaction is proportional to the second power of the concentration of nitrous acid and they conclude that N 2 O 3 is the oxidising entity. The concentration of HNO 2 in the reaction is determined by the successive reactions. The intermediate N 2 O 3 is formed from HNO 2 and reacts with H 3 AsO 3 according to the equations. The last equation represents the rate-determining step. The oxidation of hydrogen iodide by nitric acid has been investigated by Eckstadt in 1902. Although this author worked, under very rigorous conditions - i. e. exclusion of dust and impurities, and use of unscratched glassware -in order to obtain reproducibility, he was unable to determine the order of the reaction with respect to the reactants, possibly because he did not recognise the important role of nitrous acid in the reaction. Bobtelsky and Kaplan find that the oxidation of potassium iodide by nitrous acid is first order with respect to both reactants. The reaction between potassium iodide and nitric acid has recently been discussed by Abel, who concludes that the published data are compatible with attack by NO, NO 2 or HNO 2. The observed irreproducibility of many chemical reactions is due to failure to reproduce the conditions of experiments with sufficient accuracy. It has, however, been shown mathematically that reaction mechanisms are possible which lead to inherently irreproducible reaction rates. The essential feature of such a mechanism is the very slow formation of an active molecular species which initiates a branching chain reaction. The order of magnitude of velocity constants of the individual steps in a reaction mechanism which would lead to observable fluctuations has been calculated and found to be of the same order of magnitude as known velocity constants. The mechanisms of reactions with long induction periods, and of other antocatalytic reactions might be of the type leading to irreproducible reaction rates. The oxidation of formic acid by nitric acid, for example, has been reported irreproducible, and variable induction periods are a well-known feature of the oxidation of many organic compounds by nitric acid. <p...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{speciation}} {{of arsenic}} (III) and (V) in aqueous acidic and basic solutions at ambient conditions, and of arsenic (V) in acidic solutions at 270 bars from 30 to 300 degreesC was investigated using in situ X-Ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS). Both Extended X-Ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) analysis and X-Ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES) ab initio calculations {{were used to}} determine the structure of dominant arsenic species in solution. At ambient conditions, the deprotonation of AsIII(OH) 3 and AsVO(OH) 3 species with increasing pH is demonstrated by analysis of their XANES signals, in agreement with available <b>arsenious</b> and arsenic <b>acid</b> dissociation constants. In basic conditions, the dominant species is a deprotonated form of the As(OH) 3 acid, with a very similar symmetry. The speciation of AsV in acidic hydrothermal fluids is dominated by the AsVO(OH) 3 complex over a wide temperature and pressure range, to at least 300 degreesC and 300 bars. The first-shell As structure in the AsVO(OH) 3 species and its deprotonated forms is found to be a distorted tetrahedron, similar to the base AsO 4 unit of Na 2 HAsO 4 middle dot 7 H 2 O(s). This work demonstrates new capabilities of XAS coupled with molecular modelling to decipher deprotonation reactions that affect mineral solubilities and chemical elements mobility in aqueous crustal fluids...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDensities {{and heat}} {{capacities}} of aqueous <b>arsenious</b> and arsenic <b>acid</b> solutions of 0. 1 – 0. 6 mol/kg were measured using the flow vibrating tube densitometry and differential calorimetry at temperatures to 350 °C and pressures to 310 bar. The standard partial molal volumes V° and heat capacities C°p of the neutral aqueous AsIII and AsV (oxy) hydroxide species, As(OH) 3 and AsO(OH) 3, {{were obtained from}} these data, via corrections for partial dissociation and extrapolation to infinite dilution. The generated V° and C°p values, together with the existing data on AsIII oxide and sulfide minerals solubilities and low-temperature AsIII–AsV aqueous solution equilibria, were used to refine the thermodynamic properties of As hydroxide complexes over a wide temperature–pressure range, {{in the framework of}} the revised HKF equation of state and using correlation algorithms recently proposed for aqueous neutral species. These revised properties were combined with solubility data for arsenopyrite (FeAsS) and direct calorimetric heat capacity and enthalpy measurements reported in the literature for arsenopyrite, loellingite (FeAs 2), and westerveldite (FeAs), to generate a consistent set of thermodynamic parameters for these iron sulfarsenides. The new Gibbs free energy values of arsenopyrite and loellingite resulting from these properties imply lower solubilities of iron sulfarsenides in aquatic environments than have been assumed. The thermodynamic properties of arsenic aqueous species and solid phases obtained in this study provide quantitative constraints on As-bearing mineral stabilities and arsenic transport by geological fluids...|$|R
