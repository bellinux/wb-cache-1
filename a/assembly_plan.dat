40|$|This paper aims to {{investigate}} automatic <b>assembly</b> <b>planning</b> for robot and manual assembly. The octree decomposition technique {{is applied to}} approximate CAD models with an octree representation which are then used to generate robot and manual <b>assembly</b> <b>plans.</b> An <b>assembly</b> <b>planning</b> system able to generate <b>assembly</b> <b>plans</b> was developed to build these prototype models. Octree decomposition is an effective <b>assembly</b> <b>planning</b> tool. <b>Assembly</b> <b>plans</b> can automatically be generated for robot and manual assembly using octree models.

This limits its use and applications when complex <b>assemblies</b> must be <b>planned,</b> but {{in the context of}} prototyping can allow a rough component to be formed which can later be finished by hand. <b>Assembly</b> <b>plans</b> can be generated using octree decomposition, however, new algorithms must be developed to overcome its limitations...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of <b>assembly</b> <b>planning</b> {{is to determine}} a sequence of assembling a product with respect to its geometric, and resource constraints. Recent strides toward concurrent engineering {{have called for a}} tighter integration of <b>assembly</b> <b>planning</b> with design, because often during <b>assembly</b> <b>planning,</b> one realizes that a significant amount of assembly cost can be cut by redesigning the product itself. Instead of "retroactively" redesigning a product upon <b>assembly</b> <b>planning,</b> a concurrent engineering platform must also allow its users to evaluate designs (e. g. with regards to assembly sequencing), and "proactively" explore different alternatives at various levels of abstractions so that one can zoom in on "promising" design paths and design right within the first few design cycles.

In contrast to existing <b>assembly</b> <b>planning</b> systems, one of the novelties of the system is it allows the <b>assembly</b> <b>plans</b> be automatically generated from a CAD assembly model with minimal manual interventions.

40|$|This report {{presents}} a general method for representing {{the motion of}} an object while maintaining contact with other fixed objects. The motivation for our work is the <b>assembly</b> <b>plan</b> from observation (APO) system. The APO system observes a human perform an assembly task.

Finally, the APO converts the <b>assembly</b> <b>plan</b> into a program for a robot which can repeat the demonstrated task. The position and orientation of an object, known as its configuration can be represented using dual vectors. We use dual quaternions to represent the configuration of objects in 3 D space. When an object maintains a set of contacts with other fixed objects, its configuration will be constrained to lie on a surface in configuration space called the c-surface.

40|$|International audienceThis {{paper is}} related to the field of <b>assembly</b> <b>plan</b> generation. It {{describes}} a new approach to a priori check the consistency of an assembly strategy that is given by the assembly system designers before running an <b>assembly</b> <b>plan</b> generation algorithm. The aim of this work is to improve the <b>assembly</b> <b>plan</b> designer's efficiency by reducing the research space while proving the existence of acceptable solutions. The assembly strategy combined with the product's model implies a set of constraints on the assembly processes. The proposed method determines whether the given assembly strategy produces possible assembly processes. In case of inconsistencies among the strategic constraints, the method will help the designer to identify the contradictory constraints. The set of constraints can be expressed by a Boolean equation. First we present the key concepts and models related to the product, processes and added values in the field of <b>assembly</b> <b>plan</b> generation. Second we define existing strategic constraints, and propose three new ones and a classification of strategic assembly constraints. The originality of the proposed method consists in defining an elementary strategic constraint that is used to describe every other constraint. The proposed method leads to model an assembly strategy by a single Boolean equation that is used to check the inconsistencies. An industrial case study is provided to highlight and to demonstrate the interests of this approach...|$|E

At this time several experimental assembly planning systems have been developed.

The <b>planning</b> system analyzes <b>assembly</b> cost in terms of stability, directionality, and manipulability to guide the generation of preferred <b>assembly</b> <b>plans.</b> The planning in this system incorporates the special processes, such as cleaning, testing, labeling, etc., that must occur during the <b>assembly.</b> Additionally, the <b>planning</b> handles nonreversible, as well as reversible, assembly tasks through backward <b>assembly</b> <b>planning.</b> In order to decrease the planning efficiency, the system avoids the analysis of decompositions that do not correspond to feasible assembly tasks.

An example of an assembly with four parts illustrates the use of the AND/OR graph representation to find the best <b>assembly</b> <b>plan</b> based on weighing of operations according to complexity of manipulation and stability of subassemblies. In practice, a generic search algorithm, such as the AO * may be used to find this plan.

40|$|International audienceThe main {{difficulty}} {{in the overall}} process of optimal <b>assembly</b> <b>plan</b> generation is the great number of different ways to assemble a product (typically thousands of solutions). This problem confines the application of most existing automated planning methods to products composed of {{only a limited number}} of components. The presented method of <b>assembly</b> <b>plan</b> generation belongs to the approach called “disassembly” and is founded on a new representation of the assembly process, with introduction of a new concept, the equivalence of binary trees. This representation allows to generate the minimal list of all non-redundant (really different) assembly plans. Plan generation is directed by assembly operation constraints and plan-level performance criteria. The method was tested for various assembly applications and compared to other generation approaches. Results show a great reduction in the combinatorial explosion of the number of plans. Therefore, this simplifying approach of assembly sequence modeling allows to handle more complex products with a large number of parts...|$|E

Despite the merits of <b>assembly</b> sequence <b>planning</b> in lieu of considering connection functions, previous investigations have focused primarily on product representation with the connector concept.

In this study, we present a novel means of generating assembly sequences {{on the basis of the}} connector concept. The proposed method initially defines different types of connectors and representation schemes. Through the definition and representation scheme, an assembly product can be decomposed into a set of connector-based assembly elements. The connector-based assembly elements then serve as input for an assembly sequence generation algorithm, which is connector-based, to generate an assembly sequence. The final output is a connector-based assembly sequence graph, resembling an assembly precedence diagram. In addition, this graph can act as the input for any line balance method when designing work elements for each assembly workstation...|$|R
