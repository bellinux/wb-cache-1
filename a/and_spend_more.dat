5|$|Simpson's primary {{objective}} for 1967 was overall {{victory in the}} Tour de France; in preparation, he planned to ride stage races instead of one-day classics. Simpson felt his chances were good because this Tour was contested by national, rather than professional teams. He would lead the British team, which– although one of the weakest– would support him totally, unlike Peugeot. During Simpson's previous three years with Peugeot, he was only guaranteed a place on their Tour team if he signed with them for the following year. Free to join a new team for the 1968 season, he was offered at least ten contracts; Simpson had a verbal agreement with Italian team Salvarani, and would share its leadership with Felice Gimondi. In an interview with Cycling (now Cycling Weekly) journalist, Ken Evans, in April, Simpson revealed his intention to attempt the hour record in the 1967 season. He also said he wanted retire from road racing aged 33, to ride on the track <b>and</b> <b>spend</b> <b>more</b> time with his family.|$|E

He had {{been suffering from}} nervous exhaustion and also wanted to leave the lifestyle of a constantly touring musician in order to settle down <b>and</b> <b>spend</b> <b>more</b> time {{with his wife and}} children. However, his relationship with the band remained amicable, and although he would not return as a performing or recording member he continued to write lyrics for Level 42 following his departure. He was temporarily replaced by Paul Gendler (an experienced session player who had previously been the guitarist for Modern Romance) for a six-week headlining tour and for further support slots with Tina Turner.|$|E

25|$|The shallowness of orca tanks forces orcas {{to spend}} a lot of time at the surface. So much time at the surface leads to {{prolonged}} exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays. Prolonged exposure to the surface and UV rays is attributed to sunburns and the development of cataracts in orcas in captivity. Orcas in the wild would live at higher latitudes, meaning less intense sun, <b>and</b> <b>spend</b> <b>more</b> time in deeper, darker waters. While it is uncertain the effects of prolonged UV exposure to orcas' skin, since captive orca necropsies are extremely secretive, it seems logical that prolonged exposure to UV rays on unprotected skin would have the same negative effects such as melanoma (skin cancer) on orcas as it does on humans.|$|E
25|$|Most Waldorf-inspired {{schools in}} the United States are {{elementary}} schools established as either magnet or charter schools. The first Waldorf-inspired high school was launched in 2008 with assistance from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. While these schools follow a similar developmental approach as the independent schools, Waldorf-inspired schools must demonstrate achievement on standardized tests {{in order to continue}} receiving public funding. Studies of standardized test scores suggest that students at Waldorf-inspired schools tend to score below their peers in the earliest grades and catch up or surpass their peers by middle school. One study found that students at Waldorf-inspired schools watch less television <b>and</b> <b>spend</b> <b>more</b> time engaging in creative activities or spending time with friends. Public Waldorf schools' need to demonstrate achievement through standardized test scores has encouraged increased use of textbooks and expanded instructional time for academic subjects.|$|E
25|$|In the colony, {{the queen}} is {{responsible}} {{for all of the}} foraging for the nest until workers mature. This includes foraging for wood to make into pulp for the nest as well as food for the larvae. Most workers begin to help with foraging the day after they emerge from the nest as adults. Almost immediately, they take over all foraging activity for the queen. The behavior of the workers who forage differs depending on their activity. Those trying to catch flies move quickly from one flower head to the next and pounce on prey when it is found. In comparison, wasps that forage for nectar move slower <b>and</b> <b>spend</b> <b>more</b> time at each flower. Other workers collect pulp from dead wood to use for nest construction. It appears that if the wasp is unable to quickly catch a fly it goes on to collect nectar suggesting one worker does not always collect the same type of material. Different amounts of time are given to each activity with the most time spent gathering fluid, then pulp, and then flies. Foraging takes place from roughly sunrise to sunset of each day in order {{to keep up with the}} resources needed for the colony.|$|E

500|$|Feeling {{that the}} band's {{previous}} two projects (The Alchemy Index and Vheissu) had a [...] "sleepy feeling" [...] to them, Thrice {{wanted to make}} a record that was [...] "a little more upbeat and energetic." [...] Thrice's members also hoped to save money <b>and</b> <b>spend</b> <b>more</b> time with their families by building a recording studio in guitarist Teppei Teranishi's home. Originally, the band expressed interest in tracking the record live (i.e. recording the full band all at once, instead of each instrument individually and mixing together at a later time) in the home studio; however Thrice later abandoned the idea of recording this way. Instead, the band recorded songs with [...] "similar vibe musically, and tonally" [...] in the same session. Several wooden devices were constructed by the band for the home studio to make the recordings [...] "sound better." [...] The self-produced album was released through Vagrant Records.|$|E

500|$|Bridges left Brackley in {{the summer}} and signed for Northern Premier League side King's Lynn Town in May 2014. On {{securing}} the signing of Bridges for the season, manager Gary Setchell stated [...] "I’m probably very, very fortunate I’ve stumbled across Bridgo when he’s got a lot going on outside of football, business wise". Whilst out injured, and having already obtained his UEFA 'B' coaching badge, Bridges was made first-team coach at the club in February 2015. He combined the role alongside continuing to play in the first-team. King's Lynn were moved into the Southern Premier League for the 201516 campaign and Bridges continued to feature regularly in the Linnets midfield during the campaign, making 39 appearances in all competitions. Bridges retired from playing in May 2016 to [...] "concentrate on his successful business ventures and spend time with his family". On his retirement, manager Setchell said “David will be missed {{by a lot of people}} at the football club but I totally understand his decision to call it a day on his fantastic playing career and pursue his business interests <b>and</b> <b>spend</b> <b>more</b> time with his young family.” ...|$|E
500|$|P. labiata {{females are}} {{extremely}} aggressive to other females, trying to invade {{and take over}} each other's webs, which often results in cannibalism. A laboratory test showed how they minimise the risk of meeting each other, by recognising pieces with blotting paper containing their own silk draglines and pieces contain other P. labiata females' draglines. If obstacles {{make it impossible to}} see whether the other is physically present, she avoids blotting paper containing the other's draglines, but moves with no constraint if she can see that the other female is not around. Draglines seem to act as territory marks, much as many mammals identify conspecifics by scent marking. P. labiata females also avoid rival females of higher fighting ability <b>and</b> <b>spend</b> <b>more</b> time around less powerful fighters. A laboratory test collected samples of the draglines [...] of equal-sized females and then pitted some of them in contests. Other females avoided the draglines of the victors, and spent the majority of their time on draglines of the losers. Similar tests showed that females of P. fimbriata from Australia and P. schultzi from Kenya do not avoid draglines of a powerful fighter.|$|E

2500|$|A {{community}} of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp.) in Shark Bay, Western Australia, {{made up of}} approximately 41-54 animals, are known to use conical sponges (Echinodictyum mesenterinum) as tools while foraging. This behavior, termed [...] "sponging", occurs when a dolphin breaks off a sponge and wears it over its [...] rostrum while foraging on the seafloor. Sponging behavior typically begins {{in the second year}} of life. During sponging, dolphins mainly target fish that lack swim bladders and burrow in the substrate. Therefore, the sponge may be used to protect their rostrums as they forage in a niche where echolocation and vision are less effective hunting techniques. Dolphins tend to carry the same sponge for multiple surfacings but sometimes change sponges. Spongers typically are more solitary, take deeper dives, <b>and</b> <b>spend</b> <b>more</b> time foraging than non-spongers. Despite these costs, spongers have similar calving success to non-spongers.|$|E

A year later, the Wisden report was little changed: [...] "The recurring inability of Gurr to fill his ordained position as opening fast bowler continued to worry everyone," [...] its report said.
