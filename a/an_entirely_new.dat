5|$|A {{boulevard}} to {{link the}} parks on Chicago's north and south sides was proposed as early as 1891. An early plan called for a tunnel to link Michigan Avenue south of the river with Pine Street (now Michigan Avenue) north of the river. In 1903 {{an editorial in the}} Chicago Tribune proposed a new bascule bridge across the river at Michigan Avenue. Other plans suggested that the bridge should be a replica of the Pont Alexandre III that spans the Seine in Paris, or that, rather than constructing <b>an</b> <b>entirely</b> <b>new</b> bridge, the existing Rush Street bridge should be double-decked.|$|E

After gaining access to the Sevii Islands, <b>an</b> <b>entirely</b> <b>new</b> region, the player discovers Lorelei in her house and convinces her to come back with him. Once more, the protagonist must thwart the Team Rocket's plans on several occasions, recover two artifacts, the Ruby and the Sapphire, {{and put them in the}} main {{computer}} at One Island. After that, the player can communicate, battle, trade, etc., with Ruby and Sapphire.|$|E

5|$|By 1928 the Southern Railway {{was well}} served by large 4-6-0 express {{passenger}} locomotives, {{but there was an}} urgent need for a class to fulfill intermediate roles throughout the system. Maunsell’s previous attempt at developing his predecessor’s L class for this task had proven a disappointment, and the Drummond D15 and L12 classes were approaching the end of their useful lives on these services. <b>An</b> <b>entirely</b> <b>new</b> secondary express passenger locomotive was required to operate over the main lines throughout the system including those that had relatively short turntables.|$|E
5|$|In 1844, the community, perpetually {{struggling}} financially, drafted <b>an</b> <b>entirely</b> <b>new</b> {{constitution and}} committed to following more closely the Fourierist model.

Ripley himself became a celebrity proponent of Fourierism and organized conventions throughout New England to discuss the community.|$|E

5|$|Shoup {{favored a}} more frugal {{approach}} to the military budget, feeling the military was too susceptible to influence from large corporations arguing for expensive and unnecessary programs. As the Kennedy administration brought more emphasis on conventional warfare, Shoup sought to use increased funds to improve military logistics.

He also created a new Data Processing Division to centralize the data processing functions of several combat service support branches.|$|E

On 26 May 1955, four Navy officers arrived at the McDonnell offices and, within an hour, presented the company with <b>an</b> <b>entirely</b> <b>new</b> set of requirements. Because the Navy already had the Douglas A-4 Skyhawk for ground attack and F-8 Crusader for dogfighting, the project now had to fulfill {{the need for an}} all-weather fleet defense interceptor.

5|$|The Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660 {{also brought}} about some {{restoration}} of churches and cathedrals {{such as that}} at Lichfield by Sir William Wilson, and their enrichment with new fittings, new church plate and many elaborate memorials. The loss of the ancient St. Paul’s Cathedral in the Great Fire of London in 1666 meant that <b>an</b> <b>entirely</b> <b>new</b> cathedral, the present St Paul’s, was built on its site to a design in the Baroque style by Sir Christopher Wren.|$|E
5|$|The {{bridge was}} built because the {{previous}} bridge, built in 1956, was {{nearing the end}} of its life span. The Nova Scotia Government had proposed minor repairs, but it was decided by the N.S. Government that <b>an</b> <b>entirely</b> <b>new</b> bridge would be more cost-effective. The new bridge was designed, unlike its predecessor, without large, overhead steel arches, because it would have been twice as costly to build. The new bridge was constructed on the same site as the old bridge's predecessor which was constructed just south of the East River Bridge in 1907.|$|E
