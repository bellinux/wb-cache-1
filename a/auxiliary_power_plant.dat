The ADC performance is evaluated for both Torsional Interaction (TI) and Torque Amplification (TA) types of SSR in the IEEE First Benchmark (FBM) and IEEE 68 bus networks.

In order maximize the overall performance and efficiency of all modern turbines, which theoretically operate according to Brayton cycle, they are operated at a very high temperature. These temperatures are so high that, which may fall in the region of turbine blade material melting point temperatures. Due to such high temperatures there is a possibility that the turbine blades may get damaged due to produced thermal stresses and presents a possible threat to the turbine system as well as the operators. Hence to ensure safe and reliable working of the turbines an effective and reliable cooling system is necessary. Currently available methods for cooling of the turbine blades include film cooling with impingement cooling for the leading edge, rib turbulated cooling using serpentine passages for the middle portion of the blade and pin fin cooling for the trailing edge of the turbine blades. The cooling mechanism for turbine blades must include cooling for all possible regions which are exposed to hot gas flow.
