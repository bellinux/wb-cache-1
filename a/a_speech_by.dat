5|$|Between {{the end of}} September {{and the end of}} December 1941, the Kozara Partisans {{conducted}} around forty {{military operations}} against the enemy. Stojanović helped plan and execute the major operations, including the battles of Podgradci, Mrakovica, and Turjak. Stojanović argued that the village of Podgradci should be captured because it was situated deep within Kozara, because the enemy could easily disrupt the Partisans' advance toward other villages of the district of Gradiška, and because there was a sawmill in Podgradci which supplied the NDH and Germans. On 23October 1941, Partisans under Stojanović's command took Podgradci after five hours of fighting. The sawmill and its stored productsincluding a large quantity of railroad ties, with which the Germans were allegedly planning to repair railways destroyed by Soviet partisans in occupied Ukrainewere burnt down. Stojanović saw this action as a symbolic collaboration with the Red Army. A number of Ustaše and Croatian Home Guards were captured in Podgradci. The Ustaše were promptly executed, and the Home Guards were given <b>a</b> <b>speech</b> <b>by</b> Stojanović before the Partisans gave them food and escorted them across the Una River.|$|E

5|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{is named}} Northeastern Pennsylvania Salesman of the Year and {{must make a}} speech at an {{association}} meeting at the Radisson Lackawanna Station Hotel, getting some assistance from Michael Scott (Steve Carell).

When Michael and Dwight make it to the convention, Dwight gets cold feet and Michael goes up and tries to relive his glory days of winning Salesman of the Year two years in a row, but ends up bombing. Dwight finally works up the nerve to give his speech and, using Jim's advice, wins over the crowd with a passionate yet unorthodox speech, which Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) videotapes from the back.
