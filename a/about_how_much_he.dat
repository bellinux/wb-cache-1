5|$|Later on, it is Bigger Brothers Day in Marine World, {{where the}} Bigger Brothers and their boys attend to {{celebrate}} (including Homer, Tom, Bart, and Pepi). After running into Homer, Tom begins to brawl with him, {{in a fight}} which rages across Springfield. In the end, Homer winds up getting poked on the back by a fire hydrant, breaking his spine, much to Tom's shock. As a result, Homer is sent to a hospital on a stretcher, and Bart holds himself responsible for this. Later on, Tom sadly talks <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>he</b> will miss being a Bigger Brother, while Pepi is sad over losing his Bigger Brother. Fortunately, Bart suggests Tom become Pepi's big brother, to which they happily agree, and both Tom and Pepi walk out into the sunset holding hands. At the same time, Homer (whose back is now fixed) and Bart reconcile, as Homer teaches Bart how to brawl due to his experience with Tom.|$|E
25|$|Clark started {{bringing}} prostitutes back {{to their}} apartment {{to have sex with}} both of them. Then, Clark began to take an interest in an 11-year-old girl who was a neighbor. Bundy helped lure the girl into sexual games and posing for sexual photographs. The pedophilia wasn't enough for them, however, and Clark started to talk <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>he</b> would like to kill a girl during sex and persuaded Carol {{to go out and buy}} two automatic pistols for him to use. Reportedly, Clark was striving to fulfill his fantasy of killing a woman during sex and feeling her vaginal contractions during the death spasms.|$|E
25|$|Social Security {{affects the}} saving {{behavior}} {{of the people in}} three different ways. The wealth substitution effect occurs when a person saving for retirement recognizes that the Social Security system will take care of him and decreases his expectations <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>he</b> needs to personally save. The retirement effect occurs when a taxpayer saves more each year in an effort to reduce the total number of years he must work to accumulate enough savings before retirement. The bequest effect occurs when a taxpayer recognizes a decrease in resources stemming from the Social Security tax and compensates by increasing personal savings to cover future expected costs of having children.|$|E
5000|$|The astrologer {{should have}} been greatly {{relieved}} {{that he is not}} a murderer after all and he has managed to put Guru Nayak off, and he should not have bothered <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> money <b>he</b> had received.

Now, Tom," [...] {{as if he was}} afraid of losing a moment; [...] "you have been a dear boy to write to me every week; {{but there are so many}} questions which only word of mouth will answer, and I have stored up dozens of them! I want to know what a coral reef really looks like, and if you saw any trepangs upon them? And what sort of strata is the gold really in? And you saw one of those giant rays; I want a whole hour's talk about the fellow. And--What an old babbler I am! talking to you when you should be talking to me. Now begin. Let us have the trepangs first. Are they real Holothurians or not?" ...|$|R

25|$|On October 10, 2001, boxing trainer Eddie Futch {{died at age}} 90. Tim Smith of the New York Daily News remembered an {{encounter}} with the trainer in an article. One of the last times I saw Futch was before the Floyd Mayweather Jr.–Diego Corrales junior lightweight title bout in Vegas. Futch was talking <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>he</b> admired Mayweather's style, how Mayweather was such a beautiful boxer, able to slip along the ropes and avoid punches. Corrales {{said he was going}} to neutralize Mayweather's hand speed by hitting Mayweather on the arms. 'I guess he thinks he's going to stand there and let him hit him on the arms all night,' said Futch, who correctly predicted that Mayweather would completely dismantle Corrales in a defensive masterpiece. Futch had a way of cutting to the heart of a matter. I don't know anyone in boxing who won't miss him. I don't know anyone in boxing that can take his place.|$|E
500|$|The Pawnee Parks and Recreation Department {{considers}} a potential sponsorship deal with Sweetums, a local candy manufacturer hoping to market [...] "nutritious" [...] snack bars to park visitors. Ron (Nick Offerman) supports the deal as he advocates governmental privatization and emphasizes consumer choice over public safety. Leslie (Amy Poehler) initially supports the deal as well, until Ann (Rashida Jones) informs her they {{are filled with}} unhealthy corn syrup. Leslie arranges a public forum for Pawnee park visitors {{so they can make}} an informed choice about Sweetums products. Ron is unhappy with the arrangement, and gets angry with Leslie worrying <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>he</b> is drinking during a recent outing, feeling she is stifling his personal freedoms. During the forum, Sweetums representatives screen propaganda films, highlighting consumer satisfaction, while Leslie responds by screening a 30-year-old Sweetums film which discusses how corn syrup and other snack bar ingredients make cattle unhealthy. At the end of Leslie's screening, Sweetums brings in its commercial's primary actor, the company's CEO Nick Newport Jr. (Gary Weeks) and his son and daughter, Denver and Dakota. Denver instructs the forum audience members to look under their seats for candy. The forum audience exclaims with excitement and ultimately votes in favor of the sponsorship deal. Ron taunts Leslie by eating two unhealthful servings of steak ("turf and turf"), but she remains genuinely concerned for his health. Ron later apologizes to Leslie for having [...] "been a horse's ass".|$|E

50|$|Under {{cross-examination}} Levine’s conduct changed. In {{contrast to}} his rapid mechanical answers offered to the prosecution, Levine stalled continuously when recalling his own testimony offered hours prior. He appeared disoriented, pausing for 10 seconds or longer as the courtroom grew quiet. Webb hit Levine with a barrage of questions <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> money <b>he</b> stole, <b>how</b> many institutions he cheated and <b>how</b> he felt <b>about</b> his actions. Levine had no answer when Webb asked how many dishonest acts he had committed.|$|R

2500|$|In August 2013, {{the couple}} {{announced}} their pending divorce, {{after five years}} of marriage, finally formalizing it in April 2014. The collapse of the marriage was most likely precipitated by the revelation that Gallagher had a two-year-old daughter Gemma, whom he had never met, with a journalist in New York. The writer Liza Ghorbani had met him while profiling him for a piece in The New York Times and their affair had led to a child. She filed for child support in New York and the tabloids were filled for a time with stories that she was demanding as much as $3 million as a settlement.

60|$|A twisted {{flash of}} pain shot across the painter's face. He {{paused for a}} moment, and a wild feeling of pity came over him. After all, what right had he to pry {{into the life of}} Dorian Gray? If he had done a tithe of what was rumoured <b>about</b> him, <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>he</b> must have suffered! Then he {{straightened}} himself up, {{and walked over to the}} fireplace, and stood there, looking at the burning logs with their frost-like ashes and their throbbing cores of flame.|$|R
