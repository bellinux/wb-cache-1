Despite the introduction of resolutions in the 98th (Senate Resolution 432 and House Resolution 571) and 99th (S. Res. 78 and H. Res. 61) Congresses, no action was taken. Finally, in 1998, Senate Resolution 187 was approved, which directed the Claims Court to report on whether Paul's claim was a legal, equitable, or gratuitous claim and what <b>amount</b> was <b>legally</b> or equitably <b>due</b> him by the United States.|$|R

50|$|Impressed by Stephen, George VI Báthory, of the Ecsed branch, {{was persuaded}} {{to change his}} {{allegiance}} from the Habsburgs to Zápolya, for which the Habsburg king deprived him of his castle Bujak. George strengthened his alliance to Stephen by marrying his sister Anna, uniting the branches. Anna Báthory was the widow of the last descendant of the Dragfi family and George now seized the castles of the Dragfi. Since the Dragfi estates were <b>legally</b> <b>due</b> to the crown, the Habsburgs forced George to yield the castles and withdrew to Csitsva in Zemplén County.|$|R
50|$|Many {{credit cards}} offer {{introductory}} rates, {{which in some}} cases, could be as low as 0% to which balances from other cards can be transferred. In theory, this enables the endless transfer of balances between cards, and since so many offers are available, this could be carried out {{for a long period}} of time. But many banks now have become aware of this practice, and introductory rates are offered only a limited number of times. In this case, the kiter is delaying <b>legally</b> <b>due</b> balances, and potentially, interest payable to the credit card bank.|$|R

50|$|Cash {{advances}} can {{be obtained}} from most credit cards, which can be used to pay off balances or loans. Though there are fees and higher interest rates for obtaining these loans, if a card has a high credit limit or no limit at all, this in theory could be used to pay off the previous balance while adding to the interest. In this case, the kiter is delaying <b>legally</b> <b>due</b> balances, and potentially, interest payable to the credit card bank; or, in the cited extreme case, using the credit card proceeds to earn interest at both banks' expense.|$|R

Vallejo returned from exile after Peron's return, but he was again forced into exile after a bomb planted by the Argentine Anticommunist Alliance exploded in his home in December 1974.|$|R

60|$|It {{is still}} an early day of August, the precise date now undiscoverable, when Bouille, about to {{set out for the}} waters of Aix la Chapelle, is once more {{suddenly}} summoned to the barracks of Metz. The soldiers stand ranked in fighting order, muskets loaded, the officers all there on compulsion; and require, with many-voiced emphasis, to have their arrears paid. Picardie was penitent; but we see it has relapsed: the wide space bristles and lours with mere mutinous armed men. Brave Bouille advances to the nearest Regiment, opens his commanding lips to harangue; obtains nothing but querulous-indignant discordance, and the sound of so many thousand livres <b>legally</b> <b>due.</b> The moment is trying; there are some ten thousand soldiers now in Metz, and one spirit seems to have spread among them.|$|R
5000|$|In law, a non liquet is a {{situation}} where there is no applicable law. Non liquet translates into English from Latin as [...] "it is not clear."

[...] Lacuna is a related word which means [...] "gap, void, defect, want, or loss" [...] and is used to indicate a gap in the law. Lacunae are distinct from loopholes, in which a law exists but which can be circumvented <b>legally</b> <b>due</b> to an unforeseen or unintended inadequacy in the said law.
