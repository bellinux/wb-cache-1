5|$|The Amps were an American alternative/indie rock group. Formed by Kim Deal in 1995 {{after her}} band the Breeders went on hiatus, the group {{consisted}} of Deal, vocals and guitars; Luis Lerma, bass; Nate Farley, guitars; and the Breeders' Jim Macpherson, drums. The Breeders' Kelley Deal, Kim's sister, was also briefly involved, but {{had to leave the}} band due to drug problems. The group was named when Kim Deal started calling herself Tammy <b>Ampersand</b> for fun, and the band Tammy and the Amps. They recorded the album Pacer in Ireland and the United States.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Kim Deal {{was eager}} to {{continue}} recording and performing. At first, she envisioned her next album as a solo record, on which she would play all of the instrument parts. When she was recording initial demos for the project, she asked Kelley to play on some of them, to distract her from her drug difficulties. Since Kelley was now also involved, Deal {{decided not to go}} solo, but formed a new group. She recruited Macpherson to play drums, musician Luis Lerma, bass, and Nate Farley, guitar. Later, Kelley dropped out of the project for rehabilitation and moved to Saint Paul, Minnesota. For fun, Deal began calling herself Tammy <b>Ampersand,</b> and the group, Tammy and the Amps. This later became simply the Amps.|$|E
