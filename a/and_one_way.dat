25|$|The {{earliest}} manuscripts had negligible punctuation {{and breathing}} marks. The manuscripts also lacked word spacing, so words, sentences, and paragraphs {{would be a}} continuous string of letters (scriptio continua), often with line breaks {{in the middle of}} words. Bookmaking was an expensive endeavor, <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>way</b> {{to reduce the number of}} pages used was to save space. Another method employed was to abbreviate frequent words, such as the nomina sacra. Yet another method involved the palimpsest, a manuscript which recycled an older manuscript. Scholars using careful examination can sometimes determine what was originally written on the material of a document before it was erased to make way for a new text (for example Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus and the Syriac Sinaiticus).|$|E

500|$|By June 1971, some Democratic {{senators}} {{opposed to}} the war wanted to limit the renewal to a one-year extension, while others wanted to end it immediately; Gravel reiterated {{that he was one}} of the latter, saying, [...] "It's a senseless war, <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>way</b> to do away with it is to do away with the draft." [...] A Senate vote on June 4 indicated majority support for the two-year extension. On June 18 Gravel announced again his intention to counteract that by filibustering the renewal legislation, defending the practice against those who associated it only with blocking civil rights legislation. The first filibuster attempt failed on June 23 when, by three votes, the Senate voted cloture for only the fifth time since 1927.|$|E

500|$|Alberta's {{first years}} as a {{province}} were optimistic ones, <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>way</b> that this optimism manifested itself was in a desire for railroads. [...] The public, media, and politicians all called for the rapid development of new lines and expansion of existing ones. [...] Rutherford's Liberals {{had set up a}} framework that allowed almost anybody to enter the railroad business, but few firms had done so by 1909. [...] The opposition Conservatives called for the government's direct entry into the industry. [...] Rutherford's government instead opted for a regime of loan guarantees: the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway and the Canadian Northern Railway (CNR) had their bonds, which were to pay 4% per year over their thirty-year term, guaranteed at a rate of $13,000 per mile of railway constructed. [...] The legislature had the right to increase this to $15,000. [...] In exchange, the railways were subject to a minimum rate of line construction: the CNR was required to build [...] and the Grand Trunk Railway [...] before the end of 1909.|$|E

Personal, cultural, social, or political conflicts are the central concerns. This is most particularly the case in the Cadwal series, though it is equally characteristic of the three Alastor books, , <b>and,</b> <b>one</b> <b>way</b> or another, most of the science fiction novels.|$|E

2500|$|The {{junction}} {{is unusual}} for its flyover, {{in a similar}} manner to the Hogarth Roundabout in Chiswick, London.

The flyover is now closed from 9pm every night. A two-way flyover has been mooted ever since the original was built in 1978: it is very unlikely to happen – the local council has stated that the cost would be prohibitive. The roundabout is still called [...] "The Army and Navy", even though the public house from which the junction got its name has been demolished.|$|E

[...] In 1962, they purchased a decaying former hotel (the historic Globe Hotel) {{in what was then}} known as downtown Portland's [...] "Skid Road" [...] district, now Old Town, and converted it into a retail store named Import Plaza. The risky move proved a success, as the store thrived, and inspired the Naito brothers to acquire several other vacant or neglected historic buildings in downtown {{over the next several years}} and renovate them at a time when most other developers were shifting their focus to the suburbs and abandoning downtown. Bill Naito is credited with coining the name [...] "Old Town" [...] for Portland's Skid Road district, in order to improve the area's image, <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>way</b> he publicized the name was by having it painted in large letters on the side of a water tower atop the building Norcrest China occupied, the White Stag building.
