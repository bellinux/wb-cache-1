5|$|Airbus briefly {{considered}} the variable camber wing, {{a concept that}} requires changing the wing profile for a given phase of flight. Studies were carried out by British Aerospace (BAe), now part of BAE Systems, at Hatfield and Bristol. Airbus estimated this would yield a two per cent improvement in <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>efficiency,</b> but the feature was rejected because of cost and difficulty of development. A true laminar flow wing (a low-drag shape that improves fuel efficiency) was also considered but rejected.|$|E
5|$|The engines power an 18.59metre {{diameter}} five-bladed main rotor. The {{rotor blades}} are constructed from carbon/glass with nomex honeycomb and rohacell foam, edged with titanium alloy in a sandwich construction. The shaping {{of the main}} rotor blades {{is derived from the}} BERP rotor blades first used on the Westland Lynx. This blade design improves <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>efficiency</b> at the blade tip and reduces the acoustic signature. Improved BERP IV rotors have since been developed; when installed, this increases the AW101's maximum takeoff weight.|$|E
5|$|Concorde's {{drooping}} nose, {{developed by}} Marshall's of Cambridge at Cambridge Airport, enabled the aircraft to switch between being streamlined to reduce drag and achieve optimal <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>efficiency</b> without obstructing the pilot's view during taxi, take-off, and landing operations. Due {{to the high}} angle of attack, the long pointed nose obstructed the view and necessitated the capability to droop. The droop nose {{was accompanied by a}} moving visor that retracted into the nose prior to being lowered. When the nose was raised to horizontal, the visor would rise in front of the cockpit windscreen for aerodynamic streamlining.|$|E
30|$|ATD is an {{important}} dependent factor related to the fuel efficiency. According Williams (2007); Parker [61]; Graham et al. [24] and Miyoshi and Ibáñez [55] the technological advancement {{has resulted in a}} positive trend of fuel efficiency. ATD was measured from engine <b>efficiencies,</b> <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>efficiencies,</b> and structural efficiencies [4, 51]. Engine efficiencies were expressed in term of engine thrust specific fuel consumption (TSFC), lower value of TSFC result in better fuel <b>efficiency</b> [4, 25]. <b>Aerodynamic</b> <b>efficiencies</b> were evaluated in term of lift/drag (L/D) ratio [74]; higher value of lift/drag ratio can result in improved fuel efficiency. Structural efficiencies were assessed in term of ratio of operating empty weight (OEW) to maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) [4, 73]. The use of advanced composite material has reduced the structural weight of aircrafts [76]. Therefore, our construct include the TSFC, L/D ratio, OEW, and MTOW for the measurement of ATD dimension.|$|R

5|$|The {{most radical}} {{feature of the}} {{original}} car was its use of flat plate heat exchangers mounted flush {{to the surface of}} the bodywork in place of conventional water radiators. The absence of standard radiators allowed Murray to compensate somewhat for the large engine and fuel tanks and produce a relatively light design with a low frontal cross section (important to reduce drag). In practice the heat exchangers did not provide anything like enough cooling capacity, one of South African Murray’s rare design failures, and were replaced by more standard radiators in the nose of the car, similar to that of the BT45, compromising its <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>efficiency.</b> In addition to the question of drag the nose-mounted radiators moved weight towards the front of the car.|$|E

25|$|There is a {{wide variety}} of types differing in the {{construction}} of their wings, <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>efficiency,</b> location of the pilot, controls and intended purpose. Most exploit meteorological phenomena to maintain or gain height. Gliders are principally used for the air sports of gliding, hang gliding and paragliding.

Some simple and familiar types of glider are toys such as the paper plane and balsa wood glider.|$|E
25|$|A wing {{is a type}} of fin that {{produces}} lift, while moving through air or some other fluid. As such, wings have streamlined cross-sections that are subject to aerodynamic forces and act as an airfoils. A wing's <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>efficiency</b> is expressed as its lift-to-drag ratio. The lift a wing generates at a given speed and angle of attack can be one to two orders of magnitude greater than the total drag on the wing. A high lift-to-drag ratio requires a significantly smaller thrust to propel the wings through the air at sufficient lift.|$|E
25|$|The F2002 was {{not only}} a {{development}} of the championship-winning Ferrari F2001, but a completely revolutionary model involving many technologies not seen previously. Since the late 1990s Ferrari had been using the same basic concept and design of gearbox and although this had been used to win drivers and constructors titles from 1999 onwards the technical team pushed ahead with a new version instead. The new replacement gearbox casing was made of ultra lightweight and higher strength titanium, thus reducing its weight by as much as 15% and lowering the car's centre of gravity.

50|$|The Prawn was a small, single-engined {{flying boat}} built by Parnall as a one-off to an Air Ministry contract. Single-engined flying boats are common, {{but the very}} unusual feature of the Prawn was that its engine was in the nose. There are obvious <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>efficiencies,</b> chiefly low drag, in putting the engine of a {{propeller}} driven landplane or floatplane in its nose, but flying boats sit low {{on the water and}} propeller clearance is a problem even when the aircraft is stationary. Once moving, spray also becomes a problem. The Prawn was built to see if these issues could be overcome. It combined two approaches: use a small propeller and make the engine mounting hinge so that the propeller could be raised above the prow when the aircraft was on the water.|$|R
25|$|With some exceptions, the {{knowledge}} of hypersonic aerodynamics has matured between the 1960s and the present decade. Therefore, the goals of an aerodynamicist have shifted from understanding the behavior of fluid flow to understanding how to engineer a vehicle to interact appropriately with the fluid flow. For example, while the behavior of hypersonic flow is understood, building a scramjet aircraft to fly at hypersonic speeds has seen very limited success. Along with building a successful scramjet aircraft, the desire to improve the <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>efficiency</b> of current aircraft and propulsion systems will continue to fuel new research in aerodynamics. Nevertheless, there are still important problems in basic aerodynamic theory, such as in predicting transition to turbulence, and the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations.|$|E
25|$|Directly {{behind the}} cockpit and {{underneath}} the main rotor was the rotorcraft's engine and its nylon bag-type fuel tank, which was housed within a welded tubular steel framework attached to the cockpit structure and to the tailboom. Power was directed to the tail rotor via a torque shaft contained within the tail cone, which featured gearing so that pilots could readily adjust the speed and direction of tail rotor movement. The engine was provided with cooling air via an intake on {{the centre of the}} starboard side of the rotorcraft; for improved ventilation, the cowling around the engine area could be entirely removed. The de Havilland Gipsy Major that was used to power the majority of Skeeters was credited with being a major contributor to the rotorcraft's relatively high fuel efficiency due to its use of fuel injectors (the high <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>efficiency</b> of the airframe itself was another beneficial factor).|$|E

The car finished 4th in class and 24th overall, before being driven home on public roads after the race. While essentially much like the existing coupé, the N24 had a front splitter and extended door sills for <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>efficiency,</b> a full roll cage, a racing fuel tank, and other modifications necessary to make the car race worthy.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{methodology and}} an associated computer {{program for the}} design of wing lifting surfaces with attainable thrust taken into consideration. The approach is based on the determination of an optimum combination of a series of candidate surfaces rather than the more commonly used candidate loadings.

A primary purpose of the design approach is the introduction of attainable leading-edge thrust considerations so that relatively mild camber surfaces may be employed in the achievement of <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>efficiencies</b> comparable to those attainable if full theoretical leading-edge thrust could be achieved.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we carry out}} {{computational}} studies of three-dimensional flow over flapping wings. The problems we have investigated include, firstly, three-dimensonal simulation of flow over an extruded SD 7003 airfoil in plunging motion at transitional Reynolds number and, secondly, flow over a pair of flapping rectangle wings with constant NACA 0012 cross-sectional airfoil profile at low Reynolds number. The three-dimensional flapping wing simulations are performed using high-order spectral difference method at low Mach number. The high-order method allows a very coarse starting mesh to be used. By using high order solution, fine flow features in the vortex-dominated flow field are effectively captured. For the plunging SD 7003 airfoil, we examine the laminar to turbulence flow transitional behavior at Re 40, 000.

500|$|The {{airframe}} of the A330 {{features a}} low-wing cantilever monoplane with a wing virtually {{identical to that}} of the A340. On the A330-300 one engine is installed at the inboard pylon while the outboard pylon position is not used, while for the A340-300 both engine pylons are used, which allows the A340-300 wing to able to sustain a higher (wing limited) MTOW. This is as the A340's two engines at each wing provide a more equal force distribution (engine weight) over the wing, while also the total engine weight counteracting moment is located more outboard with more engine weight located further outboard on the wing, hence the wing root bending moment with equal TOW is less on the A340-300 than on the A330-300. The wings were designed and manufactured by BAe, which developed a long slender wing with a very high aspect ratio to provide high <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>efficiency.</b> The wing is swept back at 30 degrees and, along with other design features, allows a maximum operating Mach number of 0.86. The wing has a very high thickness-to-chord ratio of 12.8 per cent, which means that a long span and high aspect ratio can be attained without a severe weight penalty. For comparison, the rival MD-11 has a thickness-to-chord ratio of 8–9 per cent. Each wing also has a [...] tall winglet instead of the wingtip fences found on earlier Airbus aircraft.|$|E

In order to accurately predict HSCT performance, it is imperative that nozzle boattail drag be accurately predicted. Previous methods to predict HSCT nozzle boattail drag were suspect in the transonic regime.
