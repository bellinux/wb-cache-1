40|$|This study aims at {{assessing}} {{the role of}} rural infrastructures and institutions on agricultural intensification of major crops (Teff and Maize) in three selected Tabias of Tahtay Koraro Woreda, north western Zone of Tigray Region, Ethiopia. The 3 Tabias were selected based on their similarity in agro-ecology (temperature and rainfall and soil type) but are different in infrastructures coverage. A simple random sampling technique was used to select 99 respondents from the study areas. Questionnaire and group discussion methods were used to collect the data. Infrastructures and institutions were identified {{in the field and}} their distributions were mapped using GIS. Simple descriptive method, chi-square and principal component analysis (PCA) methods were used to analyze data. Before establishment of infrastractures and institutions farmers were exposed to unnecessary cost, reduction in production especially in Teff and Maize crops because they did not get different traning and education of agricultural intensification skills. After establishment of rural infrastractures and institutions, farmers have saved their time and energy and they are getting different services, like education and traning about different agricultural intensifications (agricultural technologies). Generally, before and after establishment of rural infrastractures and institutions farmers in Tabia Selam have got an average production 11. 41 and 22. 34 qu/ha respectively. For Maize, 14. 84 and 28. 13 qu/ha is registered in this Tabia before and after respectively. in Tabia Adigidad before and <b>aftrer</b> establishment of rural infrastractures and institutions farmers have harvested an average production of Teff 7. 3 and 14. 6 qu/ha respectively while 7. 8 and 13. 3 qu/ha production of Maize is produced respectively. Furthrmore, in Tabia May-Timket before and after establishment of rural infrastractures and institutions farmers have produced 4. 4 and 7. 8 qu/ha of Teff; and 5. 3 and 9. 4 qu/ha production of Maize respectively. In addition to this, after establishment of rural infrastractures and institutions major crops show a significantly change at (p< 0. 005). The findings of the study imply that access to rural infrastructures and institutions boosts intensifications on production of Teff and Maize crops...|$|E
