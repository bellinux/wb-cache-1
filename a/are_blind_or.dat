25|$|Children who {{are blind}} not only have the {{education}} disadvantage {{of not being able}} to see â€” they also miss out on fundamental parts of early and advanced education if not provided with the necessary tools. Children who <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> <b>or</b> visually impaired can begin learning pre-braille skills from a very young age to become fluent braille readers as they get older.|$|E
25|$|Although braille {{notation}} {{was designed}} for people who <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> <b>or</b> visually impaired to read, prior {{to the introduction of}} the Perkins Brailler, writing braille was a cumbersome process. Braille writers created braille characters with a stylus and slate (as developed by Louis Braille) or by using one of the complex, expensive, and fragile braille writing machines available at the time.|$|E

500|$|On March 27, 2007, the CRTC held {{a public}} hearing to {{consider}} twelve applications from applicants requesting mandatory distribution for their television services in the basic package of all digital television service providers in Canada. Among those twelve applicants was the National Broadcast Reading Service (NBRS), a non-profit organization that operates the reading service VoicePrint, {{which is also a}} [...] "must-carry" [...] service.

500|$|There {{are three}} {{additional}} classes, S11, S12 and S13, for visually impaired swimmers. The lower number indicates {{a greater degree}} of impairment: class S11 swimmers <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> <b>or</b> nearly blind, and compete in blacked-out goggles. They each have a [...] "tapper" [...] who uses a pole or [...] "bonker" [...] to warn the swimmer that they are approaching the end of the pool. [...] The visual classifications are based on medical classification, and not on functional mobility. A final class, S14, is for intellectually disabled swimmers. This class was not contested at the 2004 and the 2008 Summer Paralympics after the IPC dropped all intellectual disability events following the basketball ID controversy at the 2000 Summer Paralympics, but was restored for the 2012 Summer Paralympics.|$|E
2500|$|The current {{series of}} Canadian {{banknotes}} has a tactile feature consisting of raised dots that indicate the denomination, allowing bills {{to be easily}} identified by blind or low vision people. It does not use standard braille; rather, the feature uses a system developed in consultation with blind and low vision Canadians after research indicated that braille was not sufficiently robust and that not all potential users read braille. Mexican bank notes, Australian bank notes, Indian rupee notes, Israeli New Shekel notes, Russian Ruble and Swiss Franc notes also have special raised symbols to make them identifiable by persons who <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> <b>or</b> low vision.|$|E

30|$|Another {{important}} watermarking {{property is}} blindness that helps characterize {{a scheme to}} <b>be</b> <b>blind,</b> non-blind, <b>or</b> semi-blind. The term blindness (or oblivious) is generally used in cryptography to define a detection process independent of any side information. More specifically, blindness is used to define a computational property of information retrieval (e.g., to define the computational independence on the original information or its derivatives to retrieve the required information). Similarly, blindness defines the detection and extraction process in digital watermarking, {{although there is no}} complete definition for a watermarking scheme to <b>be</b> <b>blind</b> <b>or</b> non-blind.|$|R
