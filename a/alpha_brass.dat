To carry out this program the author designed and constructed various pieces of equipment for the operations required in the investigation;A Bridgman furnace was built for growing single crystals. Approximately half of the runs with this furnace were successful in producing large single crystals of <b>alpha</b> <b>brass.</b> In the remainder of the runs either bicrystals or very coarse-grained polycrystals were produced.

40|$|The plane bend fatigue {{behaviour}} of 90 % {{cold rolled}} <b>alpha</b> <b>brass</b> is described. Total fatigue life {{is found to}} follow static strength variation in the plane of sheet but at lower bend angles a maximum at 34 degree is found which {{is not related to}} static properties. The results of testing smooth samples of heavily cold rolled brass in plane bending are presented together with some observations on crack growth. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
30|$|From Figures  7 and 8, {{it can be}} {{observed}} that the impact energies of specimens tested at room temperatures were almost identical to the specimens tested at low temperatures. This {{is due to the}} well-known non-ductile-brittle transition temperature (DBTT) behavior of face-centered cubic (FCC) metals like aluminum and their alloys and the FCC crystal structure of <b>alpha</b> phase <b>brass.</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Alpha</b> <b>brasses</b> (in {{principle}} single-phase {{solid solution}} alloys containing less than 35 % Zn) are usually processed by extrusion, forging or rolling. Although these materials are of widespread use, few detailed {{studies of the}} flow behavior of brass at high temperature are available. The hot workability of a CW 602 N brass (Cu 36. 5 %Zn 2 %Pb) was thus investigated by torsion testing in the temperature range between 550 and 800 C, under equivalent strain rates ranging from 0. 01 to 10 s − 1. The peak flow stress dependence on temperature and strain rate was described by the well-known Garofalo equation, with a stress exponent close to 4 and Q = 220 kJ mol− 1. A considerably larger scatter of the experimental data was observed in the high temperature range. The detailed microstructural analysis of the deformed samples by scanning electron microscopy revealed substantial differences among the samples deformed in the low temperature regime and those torsioned at 750 and 800 C. These differences were analyzed and discussed to rationalize the different mechanical responses observed in the two hot-deformation regimes...|$|R
40|$|Brass is a {{alloying}} of {{cooper and}} zine, <b>alpha</b> (a) <b>brass</b> are quite soft and ductile, the ductility of the a brasses actually increased zinc content. The maximum strength of brass is 538 Mpa attained at 44 wt% zinc. while most brasses are nit normally ranked as 'heat tratable', some brasses of very closely controlled composition are cast or hot {{worked in the}} duplex a/B state and the annealed at about 450 C to convert the microstructure to an single phase of better resistance to corrosion by dezincification in aggressive supply waters...|$|R
40|$|The stress {{distribution}} in the chip formation zone during cutting is an asked question {{in the field of}} manufacturing technology and leads to a fundamental understanding of the chip formation process. The local strains in the chip formation zone were obtained in situ by high energy synchrotron X-ray diffraction during orthogonal cutting at the HEMS beamline (PETRA III/Hamburg). The present study compares the stress states of two fcc materials, namely the aluminium alloy Al 2017 and single phase <b>alpha</b> <b>brass...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of structure during heavy cold rolling of <b>alpha</b> <b>brass</b> {{is shown to}} be similar to that formed in a model laminar sandwich composite material. In particular the deformation of annealing twins contained in a matrix of brass is identical to the central layer of the composite. By extending this idea, the wavy shear band structure often observed in cold rolled brass is considered to be internal necking of 'blocks' of material different in mechanical properties from other blocks. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

Repassivation studies have also been carried out using scratching electrode technique. Selective dissolution and film formation similar that of films formed on <b>alpha</b> <b>brass</b> in ammoniacal solutions were found to induce SCC in Mn stainless steels.

40|$|Abstract. Green {{sand casting}} and chill mould casting methods are {{representing}} the slow and fast cooling {{rates of the}} brass casting, respectively. The compositions of the raw material {{for this study were}} about Cu 70 and Zn 30, which falls under <b>alpha</b> (α) <b>brass.</b> Slow cooling rate casting shows coarse dendritric structures with large spacing between the dendrites. On the other hand, faster cooling rate casting shows finer grains with shorter dendrite spacing. The developed structure during solidification influences the properties of the cast samples. As grain size decreases, the strength of the cast brass increases; micro-porosity in the casting decreases and the tendency for the casting to fracture also decreases. However, the macro-examinations of fracture surfaces of these castings show the differences in the cast samples. Fracture surfaces of the sand cast specimen show larger dimples taking longer time to break indicating higher elongation. However, chill cast specimen shows smaller dimples and cleavage type fracture surface having higher strength and lower elongation...|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} of microstructure and texture during deformation of two-phase (<b>alpha</b> + beta) <b>brass</b> was studied for different initial microstructure and texture. The deformation processing involved unidirectional and multi-step cross-rolling. The bulk textures {{were determined by}} measuring the pole figures and calculating the orientation distribution function ODF for both alpha (fcc) and beta (bcc) phases, while the microstructure and other microstructural parameters were measured through optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy with electron back scatter diffraction (SEM-EBSD). Results indicate that textures developed after unidirectional rolling and multi-step cross-rolling are significantly different. The variation in initial texture had a pronounced effect {{on the development of}} texture in the alpha phase during subsequent deformation. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The role {{of grain}} {{boundary}} sliding in copper and Cu- 30 pct Zn in the temperature range 0. 50 - 0. 72 Tm, where Tm {{is the absolute}} melting point of the material, is examined. First, sliding data obtained on these materials are presented. The {{results indicate that the}} stress exponent for sliding is similar to that for lattice deformation, while the activation energy for sliding varies between 0. 5 and 1. 6 of the activation energy for creep. Several models proposed for grain boundary sliding are discussed, and it is shown that they do not account for the observed results on copper and <b>alpha</b> <b>brass.</b> A phenomenological model is proposed, where it is assumed that grain boundary sliding results from the glide of dislocations on secondary slip planes...|$|E
40|$|IN THE LABORATORY OF H. WOLLENBERG AT THE HAHN-MEITNER INSTITUT IN BERLIN, MEASUREMENTS OF RADIATION ENHANCED DIFFUSION WERE PERFORMED ON THIN FOILS OF <b>ALPHA</b> <b>BRASS</b> AND THE DIFFUSION RATES OBTAINED WERE MUCH LARGER THAN THOSE OBTAINED ON THICKER FOILS IN OUR LABORATORY, UNDER COMPARABLE IRRADIATION CONDITIONS. THE VALIDITY OF OUR EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND OF OUR INTERPRETATION OF THEM WAS REJECTED WITH THE IMPUTATION THAT OUR DATA WERE OBTAINED ON VERY IMPURE MATERIALS WHICH, HOWEVER, ON THE CONTRARY, WERE OF SIMILAR PURITY AS THOSE USED IN BERLIN.

40|$|The {{appraisal}} of metallic materials requires application of advanced characterisation techniques. In this paper, the use {{has been made}} of Scanning Electron Microscopy, Transmission Electron Microscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy techniques to characterise morphological, structural and chemical composition of 316 -stainless steel and unknown brass sample. The determined lattice parameter of unknown brass sample was 3. 6812 A and consisted of 63 % Cu and 37 % Zn by weight. The XRD analysis indicated a faced-centred-cubic crystal structure and the sample concluded to be an <b>alpha</b> <b>brass.</b> The measured dislocation density in 316 -stainless steel increased with increasing plastic strain and the dislocation structures varied from relatively uniform distribution at low strains to cell-like structures at high strains. The spread of X-ray diffraction peak related linearly with the dislocation content of 316 -stainless steel. Comment: 8 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables, journal articl...|$|E
40|$|The rapidly {{solidified}} prealloyed <b>alpha</b> <b>brass</b> powder with a {{size range}} of 40 to 100 μm produced by water atomization process was consolidated using liquid phase sintering process. The relationships between sintering temperature, physic-mechanical properties and microstructural characteristics were investigated. Maximum densification was obtained at 930 °C, under 600 MPa compacting pressure, with 60 min holding time. The microstructure of the sintered brass was influenced by dezincification and structural coarsening during supersolidus liquid phase sintering. As a consequence of Kirkendall effect atomic motion between Cu and Zn atoms caused to dezincification at the grain boundaries and formation of ZnO particles on the pore surfaces. It was concluded that microstructural analysis is in a well agreement with obtained physical and mechanical properties. Also, the amount of liquid phase, which depends on sintering temperature, results in different load bearing cross section areas, and it affects the type of fracture morphologies...|$|E
40|$|Many {{important}} metallic alloys are characterised by {{the chemical}} ordering of their atomic component elements. Examples are beta brass (βCuZn - {{one of the}} components of common brass), many of the gold-base alloys used in dentistry, Nickel-Titanium shape memory alloys with superelastic properties (great stretchability, as used for orthodontic wires) and Nickel-Aluminium gamma-prime phase which strengthens superalloys for high-temperature turbines. The figure shown below (Fig. 1) represents such an ordered arrangement of two atomic species (could be copper and gold, or nickel and aluminium) on a face centred cubic lattice. The disordered lattice would have the yellow and blue atoms randomly distributed. While such important materials, the realisation that these crystals are chemically ordered (in contrast to chemically-disordered alloys, such as <b>alpha</b> <b>brass</b> (αCuZn), steels, aluminium alloys, and most other metallic alloys) is a relatively new understanding, being just now one century old. It had been understood {{for a long time before}} that crystals contained spatially-ordered atoms, but not that there was chemical order hidden inside. It was only with the development of methods of diffraction of x-rays by crystals that it became possible to recognise and quantify such chemical order. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{zirconium}} {{on the hot}} working characteristics of alpha and alpha-beta brass was studied in the temperature range of 500 to 850 -degrees-C and the strain rate range of 0. 001 to 100 s- 1. On {{the basis of the}} flow stress data, processing maps showing the variation of the efficiency of power dissipation (given by [2 m/(m+ 1) ] where m is the strain rate sensitivity) with temperature and strain rate were obtained. The addition of zirconium to <b>alpha</b> <b>brass</b> decreased the maximum efficiency of power dissipation from 53 to 39 %, increased the strain rate for dynamic recrystallization (DRX) from 0. 001 to 0. 1 s- 1 and improved the hot workability. Alpha-beta brasses with and without zirconium exhibit a domain in the temperature range from 550 to 750 -degrees-C and at strain rates lower than 1 s- 1 with a maximum efficiency of power dissipation of nearly 50 % occurring in the temperature range of 700 to 750 -degrees-C and a strain rate of 0. 001 s- 1. In the domain, the alpha phase undergoes DRX and controls the hot deformation of the alloy whereas the beta phase deforms superplastically. The addition of zirconium to alpha-beta brass has not affected the processing maps as it gets partitioned to the beta phase and does not alter the constitutive behavior of the alpha phas...|$|E
