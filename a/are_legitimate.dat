25|$|Another {{argument}} {{raised by}} union supporters is that unionized workers will spend their higher wages, driving {{economic growth and}} creating new jobs. Union opponents respond {{that this is an}} example of the broken window fallacy; union supporters assume that money is more valuable in the hands of unionized workers than in the hands of whoever else would obtain it in the union's absence. There is some evidence that this is not a fallacy, as greater wealth equality seems to be correlated with greater economic growth. Union supporters counter that unions, if organized without violence or government help, are part of the free market; if unions can win higher wages for their workers without coercion, those wages <b>are</b> <b>legitimate.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{risk for}} supply interruptions {{aimed at the}} states of the Former Soviet Union is present today. Depending on {{bilateral}} relations and the present context, the risk for partial and/or short-duration cut-offs is high. Since 1991, the energy lever has been used for putting political or economic pressure on Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, Georgia that subsequently affected most of Europe. The number of incidents, i.e. cut-offs, take-overs, coercive price policy, blackmail or threats, is over fifty in total (of which about forty are cut-offs). Incidents appear to be equally divided between the Yeltsin and Putin eras, but the number of cut-offs has decreased by half during Putin. The immediate reasons for Russia’s coercive policy appear to be political concession in ongoing negotiations, infrastructure take-over, and execution of economically favorable deals or to make political statements. There are economic underpinnings in the majority of the cases and Russian demands for payments of debts <b>are</b> <b>legitimate.</b> However, there are also political underpinnings in {{more than half of the}} incidents, and in a few cases explicit political demands are evident.|$|E

25|$|Interpretation, thus, {{is not an}} act (be it {{successful}} or inherently {{condemned to}} failure) of discovering the meaning of text, but rather of constructing it, or, as Shusterman would like to put it, of “making sense’” of text. One of the corollaries of this account is that correctness of interpretation is always relative to the “rules” (typically implicit) of a given interpretation game. Since {{there are many different}} incommensurable games existing {{at the same time and}} since some of them have undergone some significant changes over history (and some may even have disappeared from use), we can speak of a plurality of correct interpretations of the same text both in synchronic and diachronic dimensions. Another consequence of this theory is Shusterman’s logical pluralism which claims not only that there can be different (even contradictory), yet equally true interpretations (that would be only a cognitive pluralism), but also that there <b>are</b> <b>legitimate</b> forms of approaching texts which do not even aim at interpretational truth or plausibility, but rather aim at other useful goals (e.g., providing pleasure or making an old text more relevant to contemporary readers).|$|E
500|$|The philosopher Frederick Suppe {{considered}} Sexual Preference a {{very important}} study that failed to duplicate the findings of Bieber et al. or the predictions of symbolic interactionism, labeling theory, and societal reaction theory approaches. Suppe considered Bell et al.′s sample of homosexuals, while highly biased, to nevertheless be the most representative ever made, and argued that biased samples can be adequate {{for the purposes of}} refuting theories propounded in other studies [...] "so long as the types of subjects used in those other studies constitute a subsample of the replicative study′s sample and the latter's population does not go beyond the claimed scope of the replicated studies." [...] He maintained that Bell et al.′s study meets these requirements, that their use of path analysis was appropriate, and that their procedures for developing a composite etiology model, which contained [...] "virtually all paths advanced in the literature", <b>are</b> <b>legitimate.</b> He argued that the only plausible basis for disputing that the study definitively refutes [...] "social learning theories of homosexual etiology" [...] is to challenge the adequacy of Bell et al.′s models and the questions they used. However, he questioned some of the details of Bell et al.′s methodology, including the questions asked. He wrote that while Bell et al. did not use the same specific questions that Bieber et al. employed, they did use [...] "questions directed at the same concerns." [...] He noted that Bell et al.′s data regarding subjects′ negative feelings toward and relationships with their fathers were based on open-ended interview questions, adding {{that it would have been}} preferable had they employed the same [...] "structured-answer questions" [...] used in Bieber et al.′s earlier study. He rejected Bell et al.′s claim that their study supports a biological explanation of sexual orientation.

500|$|In 1993, the Washington County Board of Assessment {{ruled that}} the 87 {{properties}} owned by the college were exempt from property and real estate taxes. [...] After {{an appeal to the}} Board of Assessment Appeals to reverse their earlier decision was denied, the city appealed the Washington County Court of Common Pleas. [...] On August 5, 1994, Judge Thomas J. Terputac reversed the board's decision, ruling in Order No. 93-7033 that the college did not qualify for tax-exempt status. [...] According to the trial court, Washington & Jefferson College was not a [...] "purely public charity", failing four of five criteria in the Hospital Utilization Project case. [...] Specifically, Judge Terputac opined that the college had been founded as a purely public charity, but had morphed into an [...] "enterprise of big business." [...] The college appealed to the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court, which overturned Judge Terputac's decision on September 15, 1995, in a decision written by Judge James R. Kelley. [...] According to that court, Washington & Jefferson College did satisfy the requirements to be considered a [...] "purely public charity." [...] Judges Bernard L. McGinley, Doris A. Smith-Ribner, and Dan Pellegrini dissented. [...] The City of Washington appealed that decision to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, which affirmed the lower court's decision on November 20, 1997, in a decision written by Justice John P. Flaherty. [...] According to the court, the lower court was correct in concluding that the college did in fact satisfy the five requirements for an entity to be considered a [...] "purely public charity," [...] a standard that was set out in the Hospital Utilization Project case: [...] "1) advance a charitable purpose; 2) donate or render gratuitously a substantial portion of its services; 3) benefit a substantial and indefinite class of persons who <b>are</b> <b>legitimate</b> subjects of charity; 4) relieve the government of some of its burden; and 5) operate entirely free from private profit motive." [...] The court said that [...] "the record demonstrates that W fulfills all of these requirements." [...] Most persuasive {{was the fact that the}} college's benefits were open to all and that those served were members of a charitable class. [...] The dissent by Justice Russell M. Nigro did not state that he thought that the college should not be tax-exempt, only that the rest of the court had [...] "so broadly construed its requirements that any private college or university can satisfy the test and obtain tax-exempt status." ...|$|E
