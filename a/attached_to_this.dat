It incorporates {{a broad range of}} activities, including product modification, changes to the production process, , as well as modifying advertising. Yet defining green marketing is not a simple task where several meanings intersect and contradict each other; an example of this will be the existence of varying social, environmental and retail definitions <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> term.Other similar terms used are environmental marketing and ecological marketing.|$|E
5|$|The Mounted Infantry Depot was a post {{where young}} {{officers}} could be stationed, forming a ready reserve of young, educated officers available as volunteers for staff or command positions in African colonial campaigns. It was whilst <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> post that Alderson saw {{service in the}} First Boer War in 1881 in the Transvaal. The following year, Alderson served in the 1882 Anglo-Egyptian War, fighting at the battles of Kassassin and Tel-el-Kebir. Two years later, Alderson {{was attached to the}} Mounted Camel Regiment during the failed expedition to relieve Khartoum and rescue General Gordon. During this campaign, Alderson was presented with the Bronze Medal of the Royal Humane Society after diving into the Nile to rescue a drowning soldier. For his service in these campaigns, Alderson was promoted to Captain and was stationed at Aldershot with the European Mounted Infantry Depot. The same year he married the daughter of the vicar of Syresham, Northamptonshire, a Miss Alice Mary Sergeant.|$|E

25|$|Swing {{moorings}} {{also known}} as simple or single-point moorings, are the simplest and most common kind of mooring. A swing mooring consists of a single anchor {{at the bottom of}} a waterway with a rode (a rope, cable, or chain) running to a float on the surface. The float allows a vessel to find the rode and connect to the anchor. These anchors are known as swing moorings because a vessel <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> kind of mooring swings in a circle when the direction of wind or tide changes.|$|E
25|$|Post-modernism was {{introduced}} to Urdu literature by Gopi Chand Narang. Many other critics in Urdu literature are also <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> approach to criticism. Post-modernism does not {{claim to be a}} movement and does not demand any writer to adopt a particular style of writing. It generally concentrates on a method of understanding contemporary literature in the light of its content—mostly examining features like feminism, dalit, regional and other types of literature as opposed to seeking uniformity in the global literature on the basis of internationally established trends.|$|E

50|$|<b>This</b> {{method is}} <b>to</b> use two trawls side by side. Three wires <b>attach</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> combination.

Again otter boards allow the net mouths to spread apart horizontally while floats and ground ropes provide the vertical forces. This gear is usually used for catching target fish such as monkfish, flatfish and nephrops.|$|R

In the center, Feldmarschall-Leutnant Prince Franz Seraph of Rosenberg-Orsini led the IV Armeekorps, followed by General-Major Prince Victor Rohan's division-sized 13,904-man grenadier brigade belonging to the I Reserve Armeekorps. On the left, Feldmarschall-Leutnant Prince Friedrich Franz Xaver of Hohenzollern-Hechingen advanced with his III Armeekorps, minus two detachments of about 7,000 troops.|$|E
25|$|The Type C barge was {{specifically}} converted {{to carry the}} Panzer II amphibious tank (Schwimmpanzer). Because of the extra width of the floats <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> tank, cutting a broad exit ramp into {{the bow of the}} barge was not considered advisable as it would have compromised the vessel's seaworthiness to an unacceptable degree. Instead, a large hatch was cut into the stern, thereby allowing the tanks to drive directly into deep water before turning under their own motive power and heading towards shore. The Type C barge could accommodate up to four Schwimmpanzern in its hold. Approximately 14 of these craft were available by the end of September.|$|E

25|$|One {{distinctive}} feature of Scansoriopteryx is its elongated third finger, {{which is the}} longest on the hand, nearly {{twice as long as}} the second finger. This is unlike the configuration seen in most other theropods, where the second finger is longest. The long wing feathers, or remiges, appear <b>to</b> <b>attach</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> long digit instead of the middle digit as in birds and other maniraptorans. Shorter feathers are preserved <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> the second finger. A relative of Scansoriopteryx, Yi, suggests that this elongated third finger supported a membranous wing of some kind alongside feathers.|$|R
25|$|Burghers and monarchs {{were united}} in their {{frustration}} at the Catholic Church not paying any taxes to secular states while itself collecting taxes from subjects and sending the revenues disproportionately to Italy. Martin Luther denounced the Pope for involvement in politics. Luther's doctrine of the two kingdoms justified the confiscation of church property and the crushing of the Great Peasant Revolt of 1525 by the German nobles. This explains the attraction of some territorial princes to Lutheranism.

25|$|Hemphill style pottery spans {{most of the}} 14th and {{the first}} half of the 15th century CE In this time period there were more than likely only a few potters working in this style at any one time and in some cases archaeologists have found {{signature}} features that suggest a specific potter made multiple known examples. Archaeologists have also dated the ceramics and found that the most expertly made pieces were done in the 14th century. These earlier pieces also show more influences from outside thematic sources, specifically early Walls Phase and late Braden style shell engravings from the Central Mississippi Valley. As the 15th century progressed, less competency is shown by the potters, which may indicate that less importance was <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> particular artform.|$|E
25|$|The {{best thing}} {{was simply the}} {{privilege}} {{and the challenge of}} being able to take a shot at the first female captain, transcending stereotypes that I was very familiar with. I was able to do that in front of millions of viewers. That was a remarkable experience—and it continues to resonate. The downside of that is also that it continues to resonate, and threatens to eclipse all else in one's long career if one does not up the ante and stay at it, in a way that may not ordinarily be necessary. I have to work at changing and constantly reinventing myself in a way that probably would not have happened had Star Trek not come along. I knew that going in, and I think that all of the perks <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> journey have been really inexpressively great. So the negatives are small.|$|E
