5|$|Despite {{the close}} {{passage of the}} storm to the Florida Keys, damage in the area was light and {{amounted}} to $175,000. Of this, $125,000 was attributed to structural damage. Hurricane-force winds in the archipelago only lasted 15minutes and gale-force winds occurred over a 5hour span. The brevity of damaging winds limited {{the effects of the}} storm. Most damage was constrained to downed trees, signs, and power poles. Two trailers were overturned, however, and <b>an</b> oil <b>barge</b> <b>sank</b> in the Key West Harbor. Two people drowned after their shrimp boat was destroyed. In and around the Fakahatchee Strand Preserve State Park, Royal Palms, and Royal Poincianas were defoliated by the hurricane's winds. Downed trees and power lines in Collier County temporarily left many customers without phone and electrical service. Residents in nearby Lee Cypress stated that the effects from Isbell were worse than Hurricane Donna which struck the region as a Category4 in September 1960.|$|R
5|$|Upon {{her arrival}} at New Orleans on 6 July, Chickasaw was decommissioned. She {{temporarily}} bore the name Samson between 15 June and 10 August 1869 before resuming her original name. She was sold on 12 September 1874 to the New Orleans Pacific Railway Company who modified the ship into <b>a</b> coal <b>barge</b> {{with the name}} of Samson. The railroad converted the ship into a train ferry in 1880 and changed her to side-wheel propulsion under the name Gouldsboro. She was sold in the 1940s to the New Orleans Coal & Bisso Towboat Co. and converted into <b>a</b> work <b>barge.</b> It <b>sank</b> off the Greenville Bend of the Mississippi River in New Orleans sometime during the 1950s.|$|R
50|$|Yosemite (documentation number 222722) was {{launched}} on 19 October 1922 and delivered to Southern Pacific on 25 January 1923. After 16 years on San Francisco Bay, the Argentina-Uruguayan Navigation Touring Company purchased Yosemite for $70,000 in 1939, and paid Bethlehem Shipbuilding $35,000 {{to modify the}} ferry to reach the Rio de la Plata under its own power. The ferry was renamed Argentina and equipped with structural reinforcement, new keels, additional fuel and water tanks, a radio, and quarters for a 21-man crew. Captain Eduardo M. Saez of the Uruguayan Navy sailed from San Francisco on 16 April 1940 on a 9,000 mile (15,000 km) voyage to Montevideo via the Panama Canal. The trip taking 50 days {{was thought to be}} the longest for any ferry operating under its own power.

50|$|Merely 7.4% of the Mro {{adheres to}} Christianity even though 64% {{of them have}} heard the gospel. New Testament was {{translated}} into Mro language in 1994. In 1997, an incident that made {{a considerable number of}} the Mru convert to Christians. The main temple near the Christian villages could not persuade the Christians to recant and resort to persecution. The monks led a gang of men to the Christian villages, and burned down the churches and pastors' homes and beat the villagers. However, as the group crossed a mountain pass {{on their way to the}} first Mro village, a thunderbolt struck, idling the persecutors on the spot. Another lightning struck the 300-year-old Buddhist temple, burning it to the ground. A second gang of persecutors sailed to another Christian village on the bank of the river by raft. As they floated through the river, a heavy fog settled, severely impeding the visibility. The boat then was crashed by <b>a</b> fast-floating <b>barge,</b> <b>sinking</b> it and causing several people drown. When these news spread to the Mro villages in the area, most of them decided to convert to Christians.|$|R

Judging the target not worth a torpedo, she slipped silently into the column behind the two Japanese ships. At dusk she battle surfaced. With binoculars lashed to the deck guns as sights, she raked the tanker and <b>barge,</b> <b>sinking</b> them immediately. The remainder of her patrol, along the Borneo coast through shallow and treacherous waters, was hampered by fathometer failures. She conducted an aggressive attack on two cargo ships 22 January but did not sink them.|$|R

5|$|According to Fitzgibbons, the rumours {{surrounding}} Cromwell's body {{immediately after}} his death are “merely good yarns born out of over-active imaginations”. One legend claims that he was conveyed secretly to Naseby, the site of his “greatest victory and glory”, for a midnight burial. The field was then ploughed over to hide evidence of the burial. Another legend, written in the 1730s by a John Oldmixon, claims that “a reliable Gentlewoman who attended Cromwell in his last sickness” had said the coffin was sunk in the deepest part of the River Thames the night following Cromwell's death. Fearful of royalists, “it was consulted how to dispose of his Corpse. They could not pretend to keep it for the Pomp of a publick burial...and to prevent its falling into barbarous hands, it was resolved {{to wrap it up}} in lead, to put it aboard <b>a</b> <b>Barge,</b> and <b>sink</b> it in the deepest part of the Thames, which was done the night following Cromwell's death.” In 1664, Samuel Pepys wrote of a story he had heard in which “Cromwell did, in his life, transpose many of the bodies of the Kings of England from one grave to another, and by that means it is not known certainly whether the head that is now set upon a post be that of Cromwell, or one of the Kings”. If this story had any accuracy, Fitzgibbons suggests the irony would be that the posthumous act was possibly carried out on an English monarch rather than Cromwell himself. Another story even suggested that Cromwell's body was substituted for Charles I, adding what Fitzgibbons describes as “an even greater mockery of the events of 30 January 1649”. This story is known to be false; Charles' tomb was opened in 1813, and his remains, including the cut that severed his head, remained as they were in 1649.|$|R
2500|$|Work on {{the bridge}} {{proceeded}} steadily {{after the end of}} the war. In September 1865 the first two wire ropes were laid. They were unwound from a spool on <b>a</b> <b>barge,</b> allowed to <b>sink</b> to the bottom of the river, then raised in unison from the riverbed. Wooden crossbeams were laid at regular intervals from the wire ropes and a simple footbridge was constructed for the benefit of the workers. With the Ohio River [...] "spanned," [...] there was a final push to complete the project even through floods and freezing temperatures. The cabling of the bridge went at a feverish pace, having about eighty wires taken across the river per day. Hundreds watched the spider-like process from both shores. And on June 23, 1866, the last wire was taken across, for a total of 10,360 wires. These were subsequently compressed together and wrapped with an outer covering of wire into two cables of 5,180 wires each. Suspenders were hung from the cables by the end of August and [...] of oak lumber was laid as the floor across 300 wrought iron suspended beams. Two tracks for streetcars were laid. Diagonal stays were added to increase load capacity, strengthen the floor, and check vibration. Wrought iron trusses were added, running the length of the bridge.|$|R

5000|$|Pelican {{was sold}} as a supply ship on 22 January 1901 to the Hudson's Bay Company {{for use as a}} {{northern}} supply ship. During World War I, Pelican was delivering supplies to Russia when she was engaged by a surfaced U-boat. The fight lasted one-and=a-half hours, but eventually, the U-boat was driven off. In 1922, the ship was no longer considered serviceable and was sold as scrap to Fraim Bannikhin of St. John's for $1,500. However, the vessel was not scrapped, instead being reduced to <b>a</b> <b>barge.</b> In November 1922, the barge parted its hawser off Flat Point, while being towed to Sydney, Nova Scotia. The barge grounded near Sable Island. Pelican was recovered by the tugboat Ocean Eagle II and towed her towards Sydney. However, once in the harbour, the barge grounded again on the South Bar. The barge was recovered again and docked at Sydney. In 1927, the <b>barge</b> <b>sank</b> {{to the bottom of the}} harbour after being vandalized and her sea cocks opened. The hulk remained with masts, port gunwales and forecastle above water at the wharf for 23 years. [...] The hulk was towed out to sea, escorted by [...] and scuttled in June 1953.|$|R

The impact caused the boom to bend and the crane to slide off the <b>barge</b> and <b>sink,</b> and the bridge was closed to traffic for about 48 hours. Water supply to Mitchell Island via the bridge was shut down for 25 days, and an emergency bypass water supply from Vancouver was installed. The incident prompted the City of Richmond to install a second water main to Mitchell Island in 2002.|$|R
50|$|The {{authenticity}} of the head has long been debated, and has resulted in several scientific analyses. The most notable and detailed of these was Karl Pearson and Geoffrey Morant's study conducted in the 1930s, which concluded that the Wilkinson head was that of Cromwell.
