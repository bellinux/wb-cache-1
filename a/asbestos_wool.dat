50|$|The National Research Council became {{involved}} in chemistry during these years. In 1929 the Council founded the Department of Industrial Chemistry with G.S. Whitby as the Director. The Department studied the industrial production and uses of magnesium, natural gas, <b>asbestos,</b> <b>wool,</b> maple products and rubber among other things using new laboratories built on Sussex Street in Ottawa in 1932. In 1939, E.W.R. Steacie became the Director of the Division of Chemistry and led that organization through the difficult war years.

5000|$|Located at the {{intersection}} of Payne Avenue and E. 55th Street in the Goodrich-Kirtland Park neighborhood, the three-story structure has a 220 ft frontage on Payne Avenue and a 60 ft frontage on E. 55th Street. The structure was built of brick with a wood frame, with the interior walls coated with <b>asbestos</b> and mineral <b>wool</b> for fireproofing. The building's ground floor contained space for roughly 10 retail stores, while the upper two floors contained 44 apartments. An arcade ran {{through the center of the}} building, lit from above by a skylight with 0.25 in glass. Walkways connected the two sides of the building on the second floor. The total cost of the structure was $30,000 ($ in [...] dollars).|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} whether application of insulation wool adversely affects lung volumes {{and increases the}} occurrence of symptoms of airway irritation. METHODS: Data from nationwide health check ups in 1981 - 93 of male construction workers born in 1955 or later were used to investigate cross sectional (n = 96, 004) and longitudinal (n = 26, 298) associations between lung volumes, vital capacity (VC), and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) and exposure to insulation wool by combining a job exposure matrix (JEM) and self reported exposure. Data on 12 month prevalence of persistent cough not associated with the common cold was available for the period 1989 - 92. Potential confounding from smoking, exposure to asbestos, silica, and isocyanates, was considered in the analyses. RESULTS: For those in the highest exposure category (self reported duration of exposure of > or = 11 years, and high exposure according to the JEM) VC was on average 2. 5 cl lower (95 % CI - 6. 5 to 1. 5) than in those with no exposure. The corresponding figures for FEV 1 was - 2. 4 cl (95 % CI - 6. 1 to 1. 3). In the longitudinal analyses, the yearly change in VC {{between the first and}} last spirometry for those in the highest exposure category was 0. 50 cl (95 % CI - 0. 97 to 1. 98) less than in the unexposed category. The corresponding figure for FEV 1 was 0. 89 cl (95 % CI - 0. 70 to 2. 06). High exposure to insulation <b>wool,</b> <b>asbestos,</b> or silica, during the 12 months preceding the check up was associated with increased odds ratios (ORs) for persistent cough of the same magnitude as current smoking. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate no effects on VC or FEV 1 from exposure to insulation wool. Recent exposure to insulation <b>wool,</b> <b>asbestos,</b> and silica was associated with an increased prevalence of persistent cough...|$|R
40|$|Natural fibre {{materials}} {{are one of}} the major ways to improve environmental pollution and new materials need to be considered to find the best solutions. This study presents an experimental investigation on pure micro porous materials from two types of fibres: Date Palm Fibre (DPF) and Coconut Coir Fibre (CCF). This study was conducted to examine the potential for using these two types of fibres as sound absorbers. To account for the effects of the characteristics of these materials, such as thickness and density, on the acoustic absorption coefficient of a sound absorber, the measurements were conducted in an impedance tube on normal incidence acoustic absorption. The experimental data indicate that two peak values of Acoustic Absorption Coefficient (AAC) are 0. 98 at 1381. 25 Hz- 1506. 25 Hz for the 40 mm thick sample and the AAC at high frequency for the same thickness is 0. 99 at 4521. 88 - 4906. 25 Hz; for 20 mm thickness, the peak value is 0. 84 at 2606. 25 - 3025 Hz. The AAC of the CCF sample is 0. 77 at 2434. 38 - 2543. 75 Hz for a 40 mm thickness, but for 20 mm thickness, the value is 0. 71 at 4184. 38 - 4575 Hz. The Acoustic Absorption Coefficients (AAC) of the two types of materials were increased at all frequencies when the thickness of the sample was increased. The results show that date palm fibre and coconut coir fibre have good acoustic properties at low and high frequencies and can be used as an alternative replacement to conventional products. The comparisons between the two panels show a good potential because they are cheaper and lighter in comparison to <b>asbestos</b> and rock <b>wool</b> industrial materials...|$|R
40|$|Problem statement: An organic {{material}} {{is one of}} the major requirements to improve living environment and the invention of materials need to consider for the best solution. This study presents an experimental investigation on pure porous from Date Palm Fibre (DPF). The effectiveness of sound absorbers depends on structural architecture of this material. This study was conducted to examine the potential of using date palm fibre as sound absorber. The effects of porous layer thicknesses, densities and compression on Acoustic Absorption Coefficient (AAC) of sound absorber using date palm fibre were studied. Approach: Rigid frame Johnson-Allard Model for various sample thicknesses was used in this study. The measurements were conducted in impedance tube on normal incidence acoustic absorption. The date palm fibre was mixed with latex which used for physical treatment on this material. Acoustic absorption behaviour of a porous material with different thicknesses was studied as well as samples with same thickness but different densities. In addition, samples with same properties but different period of compression time were inspected. The tests were in accordance to ISO 10534 - 2 and ASTM E 1050 - 98 international standards for Acoustic Absorption Coefficient (AAC). Results: The experimental data indicates that two peak values of AAC is 0. 93 at 1356 Hz for sample with 50 mm thickness, also the AAC at high frequency for same thickness is 0. 99 at 4200 - 4353 Hz that means able to improve acoustic absorption coefficient at low and high frequencies with significant increasing. Meanwhile, another experimental results were acquired for AAC of date palm fibre, with samples thicknesses of 35 mm at different densities. The results show that denser sample (11 Kg m - 3) has higher AAC value of 0. 83 at 1934 - 2250 Hz as compared to less dense sample (9. 92 Kg m - 3) with AAC value 0. 84 at 2443 - 2587 Hz. Conclusion: Acoustic absorption coefficient AAC of date palm fibre was increased at all frequencies when the thickness of sample was increased, particularly at low frequencies less than 1200 Hz. The introduction of latex on the samples adds stiffness, so that sound can be dissipated significantly as it travels through material. Results from the experimental tests show that date palm fibre has good acoustic properties at low and high frequencies and can be used as an alternative replacement to conventional product. Increasing density of the samples, increase the AAC as well. The innovative acoustic absorption panel has a good potential because they are cheaper and lighter in comparison to <b>asbestos</b> and rock <b>wool</b> industrial materials...|$|R
