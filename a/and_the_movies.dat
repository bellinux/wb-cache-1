25|$|Bogart {{returned}} home to find his father suffering from poor health, his medical practice faltering, {{and much of the}} family's wealth lost on bad investments in timber. During his naval days, Bogart's character and values developed independently of family influence, and he began to rebel somewhat against their values. He came to be a liberal who hated pretensions, phonies, and snobs, and at times defied conventional behavior and authority, traits he displayed in both life <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>movies.</b> He did not, however, forsake good manners, articulateness, punctuality, modesty, and a dislike of being touched. After his naval service, he worked as a shipper and then bond salesman. He joined the Naval Reserve.|$|E
25|$|In 1924, Fellini started {{primary school}} in an {{institute}} {{run by the}} nuns of San Vincenzo in Rimini, attending the Carlo Tonni public school two years later. An attentive student, he spent his leisure time drawing, staging puppet shows, and reading Il corriere dei piccoli, the popular children’s magazine that reproduced traditional American cartoons by Winsor McCay, George McManus and Frederick Burr Opper. (Opper’s Happy Hooligan would provide the visual inspiration for Gelsomina in Fellini's 1954 film La Strada; McCay’s Little Nemo would directly influence his 1980 film City of Women.) In 1926, he discovered the world of Grand Guignol, the circus with Pierino the Clown, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>movies.</b> Guido Brignone’s Maciste all’Inferno (1926), the first film he saw, would mark him in ways linked to Dante and the cinema throughout his entire career.|$|E

500|$|The Toa Payoh ritual murders {{shocked the}} public in Singapore, who were {{surprised}} by such an act taking place in their society. [...] Reports of the trio's deeds and the court proceedings were closely followed and remained prominent in the Singaporean consciousness for several years. [...] Twice, movie companies tried to capitalise on the sensation generated by the murders by producing motion pictures based on the killings; however, critics panned both films for indulging in gratuitous sex and violence, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>movies</b> performed poorly at the box office. [...] The actions and behaviour of the three killers were studied by academics in the criminal psychology field, and the rulings set by the courts became local case studies for diminished responsibility.|$|E

500|$|Vincent Canby of The New York Times {{praised the}} film's fictionalization of history, writing in his review, [...] "The film doesn't {{pretend to be}} about the civil-rights workers themselves. It's almost as if Mr. Parker and Mr. Gerolmo {{respected}} the victims, their ideals and their fate too much to reinvent them through the use of fiction." [...] In his review for the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert surmised, [...] "We knew the outcome of this case when we walked into the theater. What we may have forgotten, or never known, is exactly what kinds of currents were in the air in 1964." [...] On the syndicated television program Siskel and Ebert <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Movies,</b> Ebert and his colleague Gene Siskel gave the film a [...] "two thumbs up" [...] rating. Siskel, writing for the Chicago Tribune, praised Hackman and Dafoe's [...] "subtle" [...] performances but felt that McDormand was [...] "most effective as the film's moral conscience".|$|E
500|$|Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly graded {{the film}} with a 'B–' rating, {{summarizing}} it as a [...] "lulling, happy-face story of retirement-age self-renewal, {{set in a}} shimmering, weltering, jewel-colored India", and that it succeeded in selling [...] "something safe and sweet, in a vivid foreign setting, to an underserved share of the moviegoing market." [...] Peter Bradshaw, writing for The Guardian, was more igneous in his 2/5 star review, saying that the film [...] "needs a Stannah chairlift to get it up to any level of watchability, {{and it is not}} exactly concerned to do away with condescending stereotypes about old people, or Indian people of any age." [...] Noting the luminous, prolific resumes of the cast he noted [...] "nothing in this insipid story does anything like justice to the cast's combined potential." [...] He went on to opine that the film appeared [...] "oddly like an Agatha Christie thriller with all the pasteboard characters, 2D backstories and foreign locale, but no murder." [...] In further negative reviews, critics from The Guardian and the blog Marshall <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Movies</b> criticized the film for having a colonialist and orientalist point of view towards India.|$|E
500|$|In an [...] "early review" [...] of {{the film}} prior to its limited release, Roger Ebert and his colleague, Gene Siskel, gave the film a [...] "Two Thumbs Up" [...] rating on their {{syndicated}} television program Siskel and Ebert <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Movies.</b> In a later episode, Ebert ranked A Simple Plan at number four on his list of the [...] "Best Films of 1998". Online film critic James Berardinelli praised Billy Bob Thornton's performance as being [...] "the most striking that A Simple Plan has to offer." [...] He also praised the other performers, writing [...] "Paxton's part is deceptively complex {{in the way he}} shows how paranoia, greed, and deception can erode the conscience of even the best-intentioned of men. Brent Briscoe plays Lou as the most untrustworthy and avaricious of souls. And Bridget Fonda offers solid support as a woman who stands by her man – when she's not taking control of his life, that is." [...] After Paxton's death in February 2017, Matt Zoller Seitz of RogerEbert.com cited his performance as Hank Mitchell to be Paxton's career best, stating that [...] "The film might constitute Paxton’s most sorrowful performance as well as his most frightening... an outwardly ordinary man who has no idea what kind of evil he’s capable of".|$|E
