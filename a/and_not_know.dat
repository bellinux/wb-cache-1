25|$|Now, praise be to God that Dr. Zamenhof has {{invented the}} Esperanto language. It {{has all the}} {{potential}} qualities of becoming the international means of communication. All of us must be grateful and thankful to him for this noble effort; for in this way he has served his fellowmen well. With untiring effort and self-sacrifice {{on the part of}} its devotees Esperanto will become universal. Therefore every one of us must study this language and spread it as far as possible so that day by day it may receive a broader recognition, be accepted by all nations and governments of the world, and {{become a part of the}} curriculum in all the public schools. I hope that Esperanto will be adopted as the language of all the future international conferences and congresses, so that all people need acquire only two languages—one their own tongue and the other the international language. Then perfect union will be established between all the people of the world. Consider how difficult it is today to communicate with various nations. If one studies fifty languages one may yet travel through a country <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> the language. Therefore I hope that you will make the utmost effort, so that this language of Esperanto may be widely spread.|$|E

Basically it is saying what {{meditation}} is all about. The goal of meditation is to go beyond (that is, transcend) waking, sleeping and dreaming.

500|$|In the end, Wilder {{was happy}} with Monroe's performance, stating: [...] "Anyone can {{remember}} lines, {{but it takes a}} real artist to come on the set <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> her lines and yet give the performance she did!" [...] Despite the difficulties of its production, Some Like It Hot became a critical and commercial success when it was released in March 1959. Monroe's performance earned her a Golden Globe for Best Actress, and prompted Variety to call her [...] "a comedienne with that combination of sex appeal and timing that just can't be beat". It has been voted one of the best films ever made in polls by the American Film Institute and Sight & Sound.|$|E
500|$|Originally {{the video}} for [...] "Hung Up" [...] {{was to be}} {{directed}} by photographer David LaChapelle. He wanted the video to have a [...] "documentary"-style look, much like that of his 2005 film, Rize, in which five of the dancers from the [...] "Hung Up" [...] video appeared. LaChapelle and Madonna disagreed on the concept, prompting the project to be reassigned to Johan Renck, who worked with Madonna in her video for [...] "Nothing Really Matters". According to an interview with MTV, Renck was directing Kate Moss for a H commercial when he {{received a phone call}} from Madonna who desperately wanted to work with him. The next day he went to Los Angeles to meet the stylist and the choreographer hired by Madonna, who mailed him with her ideas for the video. The director explained that he [...] "kind of liked that we didn't have time to over-think this and be too clever, I like being out on a limb <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> what we're doing and why. Just deal with it, the mayhem, you know?" ...|$|E
500|$|Henry Johnson survives, however, {{under the}} watchful eye of Dr. Trescott, who treats the injured man out of {{gratitude}} for saving his son's life. [...] Hagenthorpe, a leading figure in town, urges Trescott to let Henry die, stating that he [...] "will hereafter be a monster, a perfect monster, and probably with an affected brain. No man can observe you as I have observed you <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> that it was a matter of conscience with you, but I am afraid, my friend, that it is one of the blunders of virtue." [...] Ultimately Trescott decides to move Henry, who has sustained disfiguring injuries to his face and psyche, to a local negro household, but Henry's presence proves troubling for the family's well-being, and he is moved to another. [...] One night Henry absconds, visiting various people around town and leaving terrified neighbors in his wake, including Bella Farragut, who he attempts to court as if no time has passed since they last met. [...] Not welcome anywhere else, Henry is eventually moved to the carriage-house in the newly built Trescott home. [...] Despite Dr. Trescott's protection, Henry is branded a monster by the townspeople, who avoid the Trescotts as a result. [...] Although previously Henry's friend, Jimmie now mocks him, daring his friends to approach the disfigured man. [...] Once the leading doctor in Whilomville, Trescott's reputation suffers greatly, as does that of his wife, who no longer receives visitors.|$|E

2500|$|Little Inferno is {{the first}} game {{developed}} by Tomorrow Corporation, an independent game developer founded in 2010 consisting of three people: Kyle Gray, Kyle Gabler, and Allan Blomquist. Gray previously worked on Henry Hatsworth in the Puzzling Adventure, while Gabler and Blomquist worked on World of Goo. Gabler stated that Little Inferno was inspired by The Yule Log, a television program that consists of a 17-second loop of a burning log. The team had mused that the program was like [...] "a super boring game that some awful company will totally make for the Wii or smartphones," [...] which then inspired the proposal that [...] "WE could be that awful company! But I wonder if we can start with an exceptionally underwhelming premise, but then actually make the game really really surprisingly good?" [...] One of the goals in designing Little Inferno {{was to make the}} game [...] "unpredictable" [...] in order to distinguish it from existing games in which the player might easily determine the direction of the gameplay. Gabler remarked [...] "I want to be taken on a ride, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> where I'm going. I want game designers to respect me enough to NOT let me know exactly what's going on. Give me hints. Let me NOT know. Let me figure it out. Totally change the game out from under me." ...|$|E
