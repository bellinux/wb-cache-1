5|$|In {{the court}} of Vizhnitz, it was known that if the Rebbe <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{cigarette}} to smoke {{in the middle of}} reading a kvitel, it was a sign that the petitioner's request had been accepted. Rabbi Eliezer Dovid Friedman, a follower of the fourth Vizhnitzer Rebbe, Rabbi Chaim Meir Hager, witnessed this in 1965 when he delivered a kvitel to the Rebbe on behalf of a Melbourne Jew stricken with cancer and the Rebbe <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> cigarette while reading the kvitel. The man recovered completely. However, in 1972, immediately after the death of the Rebbe, the Melbourne Jew fell ill with the same disease and succumbed to it.|$|E

5|$|After {{retiring}} from the post of Superior General of the Holy Ghost Fathers, Lefebvre was approached by traditionalists from the French Seminary in Rome who had been refused tonsure, the rite by which, until 1973, a seminarian became a cleric. They <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> conservative seminary to complete their studies. After directing them to the University of Fribourg, Switzerland, Lefebvre was urged to teach these seminarians personally. In 1969, he received permission from the local bishop to establish a seminary in Fribourg which opened with nine students, moving to Écône, Switzerland in 1971.|$|E

5|$|After {{surveying}} flooding {{from the}} depression in Florida, Governor Reubin Askew <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> disaster declaration.

5|$|Fan {{interest}} in women's wrestling sunk once {{again as the}} year closed, and Sing tired of working there. Moreover, Faye was frustrated with her gimmick. WWF management asked her not to perform the same power moves as the male wrestlers, so instead, Faye was forced to act as comic relief. After a year with the company, Sing <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> release from her contract. She briefly returned to Japan, but {{did not like the}} new system, which did not guarantee payouts.|$|E
50|$|Both legs in {{a neutral}} {{position}} (neither forward nor back), applying equal pressure against the horse's sides, generally <b>asks</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> increase in speed or an upward transition (such as walk to trot). Depending {{on the level of}} restraining aids (seat and hands), the leg can also <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> increase in impulsion, for collection, or even for the rein back. To ask a horse to back up, a rider simultaneously uses soft rein aids to keep the horse from stepping forward, but uses the legs to <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> movement, so the horse moves backwards. It is incorrect to <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> rein back by pulling or jerking on the reins.|$|R

5|$|In April 2007, The Guardian {{reported}} that British screenwriter Rupert Walters {{was writing a}} movie based on Riefenstahl's life which would star actress Jodie Foster.
