5|$|Main and Hesse {{found that}} most of the mothers of these {{children}} had suffered major losses or other trauma shortly before or after the birth of the infant and had reacted by becoming severely depressed.

Subsequent studies, whilst emphasising the potential importance of unresolved loss, have qualified these findings. For example, Solomon and George found that unresolved loss in the mother tended to be associated with disorganized attachment in their infant primarily when they had <b>also</b> <b>experienced</b> an unresolved trauma in their life prior to the loss.|$|E
