5|$|Mother Jones {{magazine}} additionally commented {{upon the}} key theme of satire over {{conflict between the}} critical success of Star Trek and the decision to cancel the program by the studio executives. The magazine noted that writer Michael O'Donoghue's work for the sketch was among the highest caliber scripts he had written for Saturday Night Live. Mother Jones found it ironic that in the sketch the Enterprise was defeated not by its traditional enemies such as the Klingons, but by <b>a</b> <b>stupid</b> NBC executive {{in charge of the}} network's programming schedule.|$|E
5|$|At Shimer, the {{professor}} is a facilitator, a guide on the side, not a sage {{on the stage}} – encouraging each student {{to contribute to the}} intellectual light being kindled in every class. Each student is expected to question and comment upon the text, to respond to one other’s insights, actively taking part in every discussion.... Students know their insights matter; they have something to offer to their peers, and {{to the life of the}} text being discussed. Some students are more exuberant than others, some would rather talk than listen; others may be a bit shy. The professor/facilitator must make sure that each student has a chance to shine, that each can feel confident, each can have the courage to ask what they think might be <b>a</b> <b>stupid</b> question. What are feared to be stupid questions are often the most provocative ones.|$|E

25|$|How can a man {{lose the}} Tour de France {{because of an}} {{accident}} to his bike? I can't understand it. The rule should be changed so that a rider with no chance of winning can give his bike to his leader, or {{there should be a}} car with several spare bicycles. You lose the Tour de France when you find someone better than you are. You don't lose it through <b>a</b> <b>stupid</b> accident to your machine. Next year Desgrange modified the rules.|$|E
25|$|The expense was {{borne by}} the community, and strict {{discipline}} was observed. Rav, however, ordered Samuel b. Shilat to deal tenderly with the pupils, to refrain from corporal punishment, or at most to use a shoe-strap in correcting pupils for inattention. <b>A</b> <b>stupid</b> pupil was made monitor until able to grasp the art of learning. Raba fixed the number of pupils at twenty-five for one teacher; if the number was between twenty-five and forty an assistant teacher ("resh dukana") was necessary; and for over forty, two teachers were required.|$|E
25|$|One likely {{reason for}} the {{relatively}} few Japanese words for 'fool' is vagueness. In both English and Japanese, the words for 'fool' have meanings that vary along scales of friendly-hostile, or joking-serious. In English, {{at one end of}} a scale are words like silly goose and at the other end are words like stupid asshole. And in Japanese, at one end are words like kamaboko baka 蒲鉾馬鹿 'silly chump' and at the other end are words like baka-yarō 馬鹿野郎 'damn fool'. The difference is in the degree of lexical diversification along the scales of meaning. English seems to have more 'fool' words with more specificity – Japanese seems to have fewer 'fool' words with more vagueness. There are decided pragmatic and communicative advantages to such lexical vagueness. If you call me <b>a</b> <b>stupid</b> son-of-a-bitch, I know exactly what you mean. But if you call me a baka-yarō, I cannot be so sure of what you mean. The expression baka-yarō 馬鹿野郎 {{is one of the most}} insulting terms in the Japanese lexicon, but it is vague and can range in meaning from an affectionate 'silly-willy' to an abusive 'jerk-off fool'. Baka-yarō is so widely used that it has become semantically weak and vague. Such vagueness can serve to conceal hostility and thus to maintain social harmony.|$|E

500|$|As well {{as being}} at the {{forefront}} of the battles over censorship and the motion picture censorship system, the exploitation genre faced numerous challenges during the 1940s and 1950s. It was estimated that Babb was sued over 400 times just for Mom and Dad (Babb himself claimed 428). He would often use the supposed educational value of the films as a defense, also recommending it to theater owners; in his pressbook for Karamoja, he wrote, [...] "When <b>a</b> <b>stupid</b> jerk tries to outsmart proven facts, he should be in an asylum, not a theater." ...|$|E
