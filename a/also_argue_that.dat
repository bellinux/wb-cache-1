5|$|If Wilde's {{period at}} the helm of the {{magazine}} was a mixed success from an organizational point of view, one can <b>also</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> it played a pivotal role in his development as a writer and facilitated his ascent to fame. Whilst Wilde the journalist supplied articles under the guidance of his editors, Wilde the editor is forced to learn to manipulate the literary marketplace on his own terms.|$|E
5|$|Modern writers <b>also</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> Black {{has certain}} countervailing advantages. The {{consensus}} that White {{should try to}} win can be a psychological burden for the white player, who sometimes loses by trying too hard to win. Some symmetrical openings (i.e. those where both players make the same moves) can lead to situations where moving first is a disadvantage, either for psychological or objective reasons.|$|E
5|$|Although the Auburn Dam is now mostly {{considered}} history, {{there are}} still proponents and groups devoted to restarting the long-inactive project. Advocates argue that the construction of Auburn {{would be the only}} solution for providing much-needed flood protection to the Sacramento area; that millions of dollars have already been spent making preparations; that it would provide an abundant supply of reliable water and hydroelectricity; and also that the recreational areas lost under the reservoir could be rebuilt around it. A major supporter of the revival of the dam is the Sacramento County Taxpayer's League; a recent survey revealed that up to two-thirds of Sacramento citizens support construction of the Auburn. They <b>also</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> the dam would only cost $2.6 billion instead of $6–10 billion, and that it is the cheapest alternative to provide flood control for the American River.|$|E

5000|$|Love and Theft {{extensively}} {{documents the}} racism and cultural appropriation inherent in blackface performance; Lott <b>also</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> it demonstrates a current of homosexual desire for Black men's bodies; he <b>also</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> [...] "mixed in with vicious parodies and lopsided appropriation, minstrelsy involved a real love of African American culture." ...|$|R

5|$|Many similar battles were fought {{between the}} {{succeeding}} Sultanate of Adal and the Solomonids, {{with both sides}} achieving victory and suffering defeat. During the protracted Ethiopian-Adal War (1529–1559), Imam Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi defeated several Ethiopian Emperors and embarked on a conquest {{referred to as the}} Futuh Al-Habash ("Conquest of Abyssinia"), which brought three-quarters of Christian Abyssinia under the power of the Muslim Adal Sultanate. Al-Ghazi's forces and their Ottoman allies came close to extinguishing the ancient Ethiopian kingdom, but the Abyssinians managed to secure the assistance of Cristóvão da Gama's Portuguese troops and maintain their domain's autonomy. However, both polities in the process exhausted their resources and manpower, which resulted in the contraction of both powers and changed regional dynamics for centuries to come. Many historians trace the origins of hostility between Somalia and Ethiopia to this war. Some scholars <b>also</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> this conflict proved, through their use on both sides, the value of firearms such as the matchlock musket, cannons and the arquebus over traditional weapons.|$|E
5|$|The {{exact nature}} of {{relations}} between Tibet and the Ming dynasty of China (1368–1644) is unclear. Analysis of the relationship is further complicated by modern political conflicts {{and the application of}} Westphalian sovereignty to a time when the concept did not exist. Some Mainland Chinese scholars, such as Wang Jiawei and Nyima Gyaincain, assert that the Ming dynasty had unquestioned sovereignty over Tibet, pointing to the Ming court's issuing of various titles to Tibetan leaders, Tibetans' full acceptance of these titles, and a renewal process for successors of these titles that involved traveling to the Ming capital. Scholars within China <b>also</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> Tibet has been an integral part of China since the 13th century and that it was thus a part of the Ming Empire. But most scholars outside China, such as Turrell V. Wylie, Melvin C. Goldstein, and Helmut Hoffman, say that the relationship was one of suzerainty, that Ming titles were only nominal, that Tibet remained an independent region outside Ming control, and that it simply paid tribute until the Jiajing Emperor (1521–1566), who ceased relations with Tibet.|$|E
25|$|Some <b>also</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> {{far from}} infusing energy, it could further enfeeble the bureaucracy.|$|E

25|$|Critics <b>also</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> {{there is}} {{a link between the}} Rare Earth Hypothesis and the creationist ideas of {{intelligent}} design.|$|E
25|$|Some <b>also</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> foreign {{contractors}} are doing work {{which could be}} done by unemployed Iraqis, which might be a factor fueling resentment of the occupation. Further resentment could be inflamed {{with the news that}} almost USD9 billion dollars of Iraqi oil revenue is missing from a fund set up to reconstruct Iraq.|$|E
25|$|Economists Fryer and Levitt {{argue that}} {{the rapid growth of}} the Klan in the 1920s was partly the result of an {{innovative}} multi-level marketing campaign. They <b>also</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> the Klan leadership focused more intently on monetizing the organization during this period than fulfilling the political goals of the organization. Local leaders profited from expanding their membership.|$|E
5000|$|Powell <b>also</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the {{safeguards}} {{provided by}} the Ohio statute were sufficient. The statute required the student's parents and the Board of Education to be given written notice of the suspension and [...] "reasons therefor" [...] within 24 hours. Powell <b>also</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the informal hearing proposed by the majority would not provide significantly more protection.|$|R

50|$|Justice Sotomayor, {{joined by}} Justice Ginsburg <b>also</b> dissented <b>arguing</b> <b>that</b> the {{majority}} had removed Mutual from {{the reach of}} common law liability. She <b>also</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> Federal drug law should be looked at as complementary to State laws, rather than in competition with them.|$|R
25|$|Another factor often implicated is to {{the side}} effects of {{antipsychotic}} medications. Atypical antipsychotics may work against smoking cessation, as symptoms of smoking cessation such as irritable mood, mental dulling, and increased appetite overlap with side effects of atypical antipsychotics. Some <b>also</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> smoking works to reduce {{the side effects of}} antipsychotics. However, research shows no association between smoking and antipsychotic use after controlling for schizophrenia.|$|E
25|$|The Athenians {{express their}} shock at the Melians' lack of realism. They {{say that there}} is no shame in {{submitting}} to a stronger enemy, especially one who is offering reasonable terms. They <b>also</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> it is sensible to submit to one's superiors, stand firm against one's equals, and be moderate to one's inferiors. The Melians do not change their minds and politely dismiss the envoys.|$|E
25|$|Advocates <b>also</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> single-payer {{could benefit}} from a more fluid economy with {{increasing}} economic growth, aggregate demand, corporate profit, and quality of life. Others have estimated a long-term savings amounting to 40% of all national health expenditures due to the extended preventive health care, although estimates from the Congressional Budget Office and The New England Journal of Medicine have found that preventive care is more expensive due to increased utilization.|$|E
25|$|Some {{critics have}} <b>also</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the U.S. has used {{democracy}} to justify military intervention abroad.|$|R
25|$|Haubold {{continued}} {{to accept the}} pterosaurian interpretation of Pteraichnus. He <b>also</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> pterosaurs were quadrupedal.|$|R
50|$|Banksira <b>also</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> k is an {{allophone}} of x and b an allophone of β.|$|R
25|$|These interpreters <b>also</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> the {{description}} in 2 Samuel 1:26 of the “love” (Hebrew: “ahava”) between David and Jonathan that {{is greater than}} the “love of women” should be understood in light of the two earlier mentions of “love” (ahava) between David and Jonathan where it is described not as love for a romantic partner but love for self (“he loved him as his own soul,” 1 Sam 18:3; 20:17).|$|E
25|$|Roman and Jewish {{literary}} sources {{suggest that}} in the 1st century BC the domestic beet was represented in the Mediterranean basin primarily by leafy forms like chard and spinach beet. Zohary and Hopf <b>also</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> it is very probable that beetroot cultivars were also grown at the time, and some Roman recipes support this. Later English and German sources show that beetroots were commonly cultivated in Medieval Europe.|$|E
25|$|Young Earth creationists reject {{almost all}} of the results of {{physical}} anthropology and human evolution and instead insist that Adam and Eve were the universal ancestors of every human to have ever lived. Noah's flood as reported in the book of Genesis is said to have killed all humans on Earth with the exception of Noah and his sons and their wives, so young Earth creationists <b>also</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> humans alive today are descended from this single family.|$|E

25|$|ART was {{traditionally}} {{viewed as}} too expensive in resource-poor settings in developing countries, which {{are believed to}} have a poor capacity for adherence to complicated treatments. However, a 2004 study of 322 outpatient services in Brazilcomprising 87,000 patientsfound the rate of adherence to be 75%. Some authors <b>also</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> if the decline in hospital admissions and ambulatory care are taken into account, the policy of universal provision of ART has accumulated a net savings of approximately $200 million.|$|E
25|$|Baconians {{have also}} argued that Shakespeare's works show a {{detailed}} scientific knowledge that, they claim, only Bacon could have possessed. Certain passages in Coriolanus, first published in 1623, are alleged {{to refer to the}} circulation of the blood, a theory known to Bacon through his friendship with William Harvey, but not made public until after Shakespeare's death in 1616. They <b>also</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> Bacon has been praised for his poetic style, even in his prose works.|$|E
25|$|Analysis of Labour Force Survey (LFS) data by {{academic}} Lavinia Mitton {{suggests that}} 22 per cent of Somalia-born {{adults in the}} UK have experienced difficulty finding and keeping work {{due to a lack}} of English-language ability. Mitton and Aspinall <b>also</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> logistic regression analysis of LFS data from 2003, 2006 and 2009 indicates that an ethnic penalty existed for Somalis even after other factors impacting employment, like English language proficiency, work experience, health, age, religion and marital status, had been taken into consideration.|$|E
