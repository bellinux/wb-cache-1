5|$|The scandal grew {{to involve}} {{a slew of}} {{additional}} allegations against the President, ranging from the improper use of government <b>agencies</b> <b>to</b> accepting gifts in office and his personal finances and taxes; Nixon repeatedly stated his willingness to pay any outstanding taxes due, and paid $465,000 in back taxes in 1974.|$|E

5|$|Bush {{declared}} a state of emergency in Louisiana on August 27, and in Mississippi and Alabama the following day; he authorized the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to manage the disaster, but his announcement failed to spur these <b>agencies</b> <b>to</b> action. The eye of the hurricane made landfall on August 29, and New Orleans began to flood due to levee breaches; later that day, Bush declared that a major disaster existed in Louisiana, officially authorizing FEMA to start using federal funds to assist in the recovery effort.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the events}} of September 11, 2001, with {{consideration}} of other events including the Oklahoma City Bombing, the Federal Highway Administration proposed the idea that major metropolitan areas create evacuation routes for civilians. These highlighted routes would allow paths for emergency crews and government <b>agencies</b> <b>to</b> enter the disaster area more quickly. By helping civilians out, and rescue workers in, the number of casualties will hopefully be decreased.|$|E
5|$|Greater {{cooperation}} between {{federal and state}} agencies {{on a national level}} has been coordinated through the National Interagency Fire Center. Though primarily a collaborative effort between federal <b>agencies</b> <b>to</b> develop a national level fire policy, the center also aids local and state governments in addressing their fire management issues. Universally accepted priorities include management directives which allow natural fires to burn unhindered under prescribed conditions. As in the 1988 fires, protection of lives and property continue to take precedence in all fire fighting efforts.|$|E

5|$|Like {{some other}} parts of the United States, {{government}} and laws are also run by a series of ballot initiatives (allowing citizens to pass or reject laws), referenda (allowing citizens to approve or reject legislation already passed), and propositions (allowing specific government <b>agencies</b> <b>to</b> propose new laws or tax increases directly to the people). Federally, Seattle is part of Washington's 7th congressional district, represented by Democrat Pramila Jayapal, the first Indian American woman elected to Congress. City Councilmember Tim Burgess was appointed mayor on September 18, 2017, and will serve until the certification of the 2017 mayoral election results in November.|$|E

In April 2012, in a similar attempt, the Bertelsmann Stiftung presented a blueprint for establishing an international non-profit credit rating agency (INCRA) for sovereign debt, structured in way that management and rating decisions are independent from its financiers.|$|E
5|$|Related to privacy, the ACLU {{engaged in}} several battles {{to ensure that}} {{government}} records about individuals were kept private, and to give individuals the right to review their records. The ACLU supported several measures, including the 1970 Fair Credit Reporting Act required credit <b>agencies</b> <b>to</b> divulge credit information to individuals; the 1973 Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, which provided students the right to access their records; and the 1974 Privacy Act which prevented the federal government from disclosing personal information without good cause.|$|E

5|$|River {{development}} {{occurred within}} {{the structure of}} the 1909 International Boundary Waters Treaty between the US and Canada. The United States Congress passed the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1925, which directed the Army Corps of Engineers and the Federal Power Commission to explore the development of the nation's rivers. This prompted <b>agencies</b> <b>to</b> conduct the first formal financial analysis of hydroelectric development; the reports produced by various agencies were presented in House Document308. Those reports, and subsequent related reports, are referred to as 308 Reports.|$|E
5|$|The Civil Air Patrol also {{provides}} non-emergency {{assistance to the}} U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Drug Enforcement Administration, and United States Forest Service in the War on Drugs. In 2005, CAP flew over 12,000hours {{in support of this}} mission and led these <b>agencies</b> <b>to</b> the confiscation of illegal substances valued at over US$400million. Civil Air Patrol makes extensive use of the Airborne Real-time Cueing Hyperspectral Enhanced Reconnaissance system, mounted on the Gippsland GA8 Airvan. The system is able to evaluate spectral signatures given off by certain objects, allowing the system to identify, for example, a possible marijuana crop.|$|E
5|$|The UN Charter {{stipulates}} that each primary {{organ of the}} United Nations can establish various specialized <b>agencies</b> <b>to</b> fulfil its duties. Some best-known agencies are the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Food and Agriculture Organization, UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization), the World Bank, and the World Health Organization (WHO). The UN performs most of its humanitarian work through these agencies. Examples include mass vaccination programmes (through WHO), the avoidance of famine and malnutrition (through {{the work of the}} WFP), and the protection of vulnerable and displaced people (for example, by UNHCR).|$|E

5|$|The {{growth in}} {{computer}} crime during the 1980s and 1990s caused law enforcement <b>agencies</b> <b>to</b> begin establishing specialized groups, usually {{at the national}} level, to handle {{the technical aspects of}} investigations. For example, in 1984 the FBI launched a Computer Analysis and Response Team and the following year a computer crime department was set up within the British Metropolitan Police fraud squad. As well as being law enforcement professionals, many of the early members of these groups were also computer hobbyists and became responsible for the field's initial research and direction.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} in the High Court decided that {{although there was no}} right at common law to have publicly provided legal representation in all cases, in some cases representation is appropriate to ensure a fair trial. Although judges no longer have the power to appoint counsel for an accused, since that function has been largely taken over by legal aid agencies, a trial judge should use their power to adjourn a case if it is in the interests of fairness that an accused have representation, which would encourage the legal aid <b>agencies</b> <b>to</b> provide counsel.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} after Babs struck the Philippines, then-Philippine {{president}} Joseph Estrada declared four provinces as a state of calamity and ordered the release of ₱200million (PHP) in emergency funds. Estrada later released an additional ₱50million (PHP) specifically for Catanduanes, as well as ₱10,000 sent {{to the family of}} each storm fatality. The Philippine Navy sent rubber boats to Bato, Catanduanes to help with relief there. The president ordered <b>agencies</b> <b>to</b> work together to respond to the disaster and for his Trade Secretary to watch for price gouging. However, food prices tripled following Babs and Zeb, especially after roads were blocked from agriculture areas, and ferries from unaffected areas were unable to travel due to the storm.|$|E
