BMW went straight forward with its engine development. The P81, used during the 2001 season, was able to hit 17,810 rpm. Unfortunately reliability was <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>issue</b> with several blowups during the season.|$|E
25|$|Metropolitan water {{supplies}} were also <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>issue,</b> with dams supplying {{the city of}} Sydney falling to 30% of their design capacity during the campaign. Iemma's predecessor Bob Carr had committed Labor to building a desalination plant at Kurnell in Sydney's south. Iemma made the controversial $1.9 billion project the centrepiece of his party's response to the city's dwindling water supply. A dam was also planned to boost {{water supplies}} on the state's Central Coast.|$|E
25|$|Side-to-side {{movement}} of the stick controlled the large rudder. This produced a rolling motion because the wings both had substantial dihedral, through yaw-roll coupling. The rudder had to be quite large not only to produce adequate roll {{but also because the}} fuselage was very short, reducing the leverage of the rudder. The Flying Flea, being a two axis aircraft, could not be landed or taken off in substantial crosswinds. This was not <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>issue</b> when the aircraft was designed because at that time aircraft were usually flown from large open fields allowing all take-offs and landings into wind.|$|E

25|$|Fur {{commerce}} made {{a permanent}} {{residence in the}} country worthwhile. Good relations with the aboriginal providers were necessary. For some fishermen however, a seasonal presence was sufficient. Commercial companies were founded that tried to further {{the interest of the}} Crown in colonizing the territory. They demanded that France grant a monopoly to one single company. In return, this company would also take over the colonization of the French American territory. Thus, it would not cost the king much money to build the colony. On the other hand, other merchants wanted commerce to stay unregulated. This controversy was <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>issue</b> {{at the turn of the}} 17th century.|$|E

[...] By 1989, McCain reiterated {{his opposition to the}} federal holiday, but reversed position on the state holiday, due to the economic boycotts and image problems Arizona was receiving as a result of it not having one. [...] He told Republicans opposing the state holiday, [...] "You will damn well do this. You will make this a holiday. You're making us look like fools." [...] In 1990, a state referendum on enacting the holiday was held; McCain persuaded Ronald Reagan to support it.|$|E
500|$|The artistic {{style was}} meant to portray a vibrant {{underwater}} world, but the team also needed to prevent activity on-screen from overwhelming the player, so a stylized look was chosen to both maintain the game's artistic style and {{reduce the amount of}} [...] "visual noise". Environmental editing was <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>issue</b> for the team, with much of their early development dedicated to creating editing tools that could do small-scale edits to environments after they had been locked down. When creating the environments, Nava drew on his experience developing Flower for Thatgamecompany, creating sporadically scattered interaction points that triggered with player exploration and triggered new life or new elements within each environment. Since there was no dedicated animator, the team needed to use multiple techniques for animation the diver, fish and flexible vegetation: the diver used a skeletal animation run through a complex state machine, vegetation such as seaweed used rope physics, while fish mainly used mathematical motion in combination with morph target posing to remove the need of individual skeletal structures.|$|E

[...] Nothing sums up the moral and religious complexity of the situation better than this sentence. The group that made <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>issue</b> of 'Ali's dilemma were the Kharijites, who for reasons of their own could see clearly the religious and political issues involved, who agreed neither with 'Ali nor with his opponent but were in turn incapable of administering a polity of their own. Tabari's account also brings that out very clearly when he relates (p.115) how the assembled Kharijites, who were quite willing to expound {{the reasons for their}} recession from 'Ali's forces, would one by one refuse to take the leadership of their own group, a situation quite characteristic of religious purists when confronted with [...] "dirty" [...] politics.|$|E

[...] The following October, researchers at the University of Cambridge concluded that 87.7% of Android phones in use had known but unpatched security vulnerabilities due to lack of updates and support. Ron Amadeo of Ars Technica wrote also in August 2015 that [...] "Android was originally designed, above all else, to be widely adopted. Google was starting from scratch with zero percent market share, so it was happy to give up control and give everyone a seat at the table in exchange for adoption. [...] Now, though, Android has around 75–80 percent of the worldwide smartphone market—making it not just the world's most popular mobile operating system but arguably the most popular operating system, period. As such, security has become <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>issue.</b> Android still uses a software update chain-of-command designed back when the Android ecosystem had zero devices to update, and it just doesn't work". Following news of Google's monthly schedule, some manufacturers, including Samsung and LG, promised to issue monthly security updates, but, as noted by Jerry Hildenbrand in Android Central in February 2016, [...] "instead we got a few updates on specific versions of a small handful of models.
