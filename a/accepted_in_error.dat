40|$|A new {{algorithm}} for {{estimating the}} proportions of the multiyear and first-year sea ice types under variable atmospheric and sea surface conditions is presented, which uses all six channels of the SMMR. The algorithm is specifically tuned to derive sea ice parameters while <b>accepting</b> <b>error</b> <b>in</b> the auxiliary parameters of surface temperature, ocean surface wind speed, atmospheric water vapor, and cloud liquid water content. Not only does the algorithm naturally correct for changes in these weather conditions, but it retrieves sea ice parameters {{to the extent that}} gross <b>errors</b> <b>in</b> atmospheric conditions propagate only small errors into the sea ice retrievals. A preliminary evaluation indicates that the weather-correcting algorithm provides a better data product than the 'UMass-AES' algorithm, whose quality has been cross checked with independent surface observations.

40|$|Introduction: <b>Errors</b> <b>in</b> {{the process}} of pre{{transfusion}} testing for blood transfusion can occur at any stage from collection of the sample to administration of the blood component. The present {{study was conducted to}} analyze the errors that threaten patients′ transfusion safety and actual harm/serious adverse events that occurred to the patients due to these errors. Materials and Methods: The prospective study was conducted in the Department Of Transfusion Medicine, Shri Maharaja Gulab Singh Hospital, Government Medical College, Jammu, India from January 2014 to December 2014 for a period of 1 year. Errors were defined as any deviation from established policies and standard operating procedures. A near-miss event was defined as those errors, which did not reach the patient. Location and time of occurrence of the events/errors were also noted. Results: A total of 32, 672 requisitions for the transfusion of blood and blood components were received for typing and cross-matching. Out of these, 26, 683 products were issued to the various clinical departments. A total of 2, 229 errors were detected over a period of 1 year. Near-miss events constituted 53 % of the errors and actual harmful events due to <b>errors</b> occurred <b>in</b> 0. 26 % of the patients. Sample labeling errors were 2. 4 %, inappropriate request for blood components 2 %, and information on requisition forms not matching with that on the sample 1. 5 % of all the requisitions received were the most frequent <b>errors</b> <b>in</b> clinical services. In transfusion services, the most common event was <b>accepting</b> sample <b>in</b> <b>error</b> with the frequency of 0. 5 % of all requisitions. ABO incompatible hemolytic reactions were the most frequent harmful event with the frequency of 2. 2 / 10, 000 transfusions. Conclusion: Sample labeling, inappropriate request, and sample received <b>in</b> <b>error</b> were the most frequent high-risk errors...|$|R
40|$|Photometric {{rotational}} modulations due to starspots {{remain the}} most common and accessible way to study stellar activity. In the Kepler-era, there now exists precise, continuous photometry of ~ 150, 000 stars presenting an unprecedented opportunity for statistical analyses of these modulations. Modelling rotational modulations allows one to invert the observations into several basic parameters, such as the rotation period, spot coverage, stellar inclination and differential rotation rate. The most widely used analytic model for this inversion comes from Budding (1977) and Dorren (1987), who considered circular, grey starspots for a linearly limb darkened star. In this work, we extend the model to be more suitable in the analysis of high precision photometry, such as that by Kepler. Our new freely available Fortran code, macula, provides several improvements, such as non-linear limb darkening of the star and spot, a single-domain analytic function, partial derivatives for all input parameters, temporal partial derivatives, diluted light compensation, instrumental offset normalisations, differential rotation, starspot evolution and predictions of transit depth variations due to unocculted spots. Through numerical testing, we find that the inclusion of non-linear limb darkening means macula has a maximum photometric error an order-of-magnitude less than that of Dorren (1987), for Sun-like stars observed in the Kepler-bandpass. The code executes three orders-of-magnitude faster than comparable numerical codes making it well-suited for inference problems.

40|$|The {{radiation}} pressure exerted by incoherent light on diverse surfaces is examined. The thermodynamic rule, first given by Carnot in 1824, describes the limitation {{to the amount}} of free energy that can be obtained from a source of thermal energy, and he gave the compelling reason for this rule, that if more free energy than he had prescribed could ever be extracted, then a heat pump could use that free energy and re-create all the heat energy that had been consumed. A perpetual motion machine could then be constructed. Now, 179 years later, it is proposed to fly a spacecraft that is expected to gain velocity from the {{radiation pressure}} the sunlight is expected to exert on solar sails, panels of thin plastic sheets, mirror surfaced on the side facing the sun. However a detailed examination of this proposal shows it to be in direct conflict with Carnot's rule, and no such pressure can be expected.

40|$|Software {{to create}} individualised finite element (FE) {{models of the}} osseoligamentous spine using {{pre-operative}} computed tomography (CT) data-sets for spinal surgery patients has recently been developed. This study presents a geometric sensitivity analysis of this software to assess the effect of intra-observer variability in user-selected anatomical landmarks. User-selected landmarks on the osseous anatomy were defined from CT data-sets for three scoliosis patients and these landmarks were used to reconstruct patient-specific anatomy of the spine and ribcage using parametric descriptions. The intra-observer <b>errors</b> <b>in</b> landmark co-ordinates for these anatomical landmarks were calculated. FE models of the spine and ribcage were created using the reconstructed anatomy for each patient and these models were analysed for a loadcase simulating clinical flexibility assessment. The intra-observer <b>error</b> <b>in</b> the anatomical measurements was low {{in comparison to the}} initial dimensions, {{with the exception of the}} angular measurements for disc wedge and zygapophyseal joint (z-joint) orientation and disc height. This variability suggested that CT resolution may influence such angular measurements, particularly for small anatomical features, such as the z-joints, and may also affect disc height. The results of the FE analysis showed low variation in the model predictions for spinal curvature with the mean intra-observer variability substantially less than the <b>accepted</b> <b>error</b> <b>in</b> clinical measurement. These findings demonstrate that intra-observer variability in landmark point selection has minimal effect on the subsequent FE predictions for a clinical loadcase...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — In signal {{processing}} applications, large energy gains {{can be obtained}} by <b>accepting</b> some degradation <b>in</b> the out-put signal quality. Filters are at the core of many such systems. In this paper, we demonstrate the potential of a new paradigm for achieving favorable quality-energy trade-offs in digital fil-ter design that is based on directly <b>accepting</b> timing <b>errors</b> <b>in</b> the datapath under aggressively scaled VDD. In an unmodified design, such scaling leads to rapid onset of timing errors and, consequently, quality loss. In a modified filter implementation, the onset of large errors is delayed, permitting significant en-ergy reduction while maintaining high quality. Specifically, the innovations in the design include techniques for: 1) run-time adjustment of datapath bitwidth, and 2) design-time reordering of filter taps. We tested the new design strategy on several au-dio and image processing applications. The designs were syn-thesized using a 45 nm standard cell library. Results of SPICE simulations on the entire designs show that up to 70 % energy savings can be achieved while maintaining excellent perceived signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Compared to a traditional filter design, the area overhead of our architecture is about 2 %...|$|R

In Yates v Halliday 2006 NSWSC 1346 and McDonald v Ellis 2007 NSWSC 1068, two judges rejected Schmidt v Rosewood. Nevertheless, one might distinguish both cases on the basis that the relevant trustee (who was clearly in default) sought to refuse disclosure to the requesting beneficiary and so lessen the prospects of their being held accountable. In both cases, therefore, the incorporation of Schmidt v Rosewood into Australian law rendered it more likely (although only marginally so) that the trustee would be able to decline to give disclosure compared to the prior proprietary basis for the rule. A concern with this consequence appears to have -- arguably -- led the court into error.|$|R

40|$|Error invariants are {{assertions that}} over-approximate the {{reachable}} program states {{at a given}} position <b>in</b> an <b>error</b> trace while only capturing states that will still lead to failure if execution of the trace is continued from that position. Such assertions reflect the effect of statements {{that are involved in}} the root cause of an error and its propagation, enabling slicing of statements that do not contribute to the error. Previous work on error invariants focused on sequential programs. We generalize error invariants to concurrent traces by augmenting them with additional information about hazards such as write-after-write events, which are often involved in race conditions and atomicity violations. By providing the option to include varying levels of details <b>in</b> <b>error</b> invariants-such as hazards and branching information-our approach allows the programmer to systematically analyze individual aspects of an error trace. We have implemented a hazard-sensitive slicing tool for concurrent traces based on error invariants and evaluated it on benchmarks covering a broad range of real-world concurrency bugs. Hazard-sensitive slicing significantly reduced the length of the considered traces and still maintained the root causes of the concurrency bugs.
