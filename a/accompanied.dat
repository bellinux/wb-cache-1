40|$|Aims and objectives. To {{investigate}} {{the factors that}} influence satisfaction with emergency care among individuals <b>accompanying</b> patients to the emergency department and explore agreement between the triage nurse and <b>accompanying</b> person regarding urgency. Background. Many patients seeking treatment in hospital are escorted by an <b>accompanying</b> person, who may be a friend, family member or carer. Several factors influence patient satisfaction with emergency care, including waiting time and time to treatment. It is also influenced by provision of information and interpersonal relations between staff and patients. Research on satisfaction has focused on the patient perspective; however, individuals who <b>accompany</b> patients are potential consumers. Knowledge about the ways <b>accompanying</b> persons perceive the patient's medical condition and level of urgency will identify areas for improved patient outcomes. Design and methods. A prospective cross-sectional survey with a consecutive sample (n = 128 response rate 83. 7 %) was undertaken. Data were collected in an Australian metropolitan teaching hospital with about 32, 000 visits to the emergency department each year. The Consumer Emergency Satisfaction Scale was used to measure satisfaction with nursing care. Results. Significant differences in perceptions of patient urgency between <b>accompanying</b> persons and nurses were found. Those people <b>accompanying</b> patients of a higher urgency were significantly more satisfied than those <b>accompanying</b> patients of a lower urgency. These results were independent of real waiting time or the <b>accompanying</b> person's knowledge of the patients' triage status. In addition, older <b>accompanying</b> persons were more satisfied with emergency care than younger <b>accompanying</b> persons. Discussion. Little {{attention has been paid to}} the social interactions that occur between nurses and patients at triage and the ways in which these interactions might impact satisfaction with emergency care. Relevance to clinical practice. Good interpersonal relationships can positively influence satisfaction with the emergency visit. This relationship can contribute to improved patient care and health outcomes...|$|R
