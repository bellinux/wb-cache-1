500|$|On April 5, 1621, {{after being}} {{anchored}} {{for almost four}} months in Plymouth Harbor, the Mayflower set sail for England. Nearly half of the original 102 passengers had died during the first winter. As William Bradford wrote, [...] "of these one hundred persons who came over in this first ship together, the greatest half died in the general mortality, {{and most of them}} in two or three months' time". By November 1621, only 53 pilgrims were alive to celebrate the harvest feast which modern <b>Americans</b> <b>know</b> as [...] "The First Thanksgiving". Of the 18 adult women, 13 died the first winter while another died in May. Only four adult women were left alive for the Thanksgiving.|$|E
500|$|Nixon gave {{a speech}} from the rear {{platform}} of the train. He praised {{the size of the}} crowd, stating, [...] "There are four times as many people here than live in the town and more than the number that were here in 1960." [...] The candidate asserted that though his opponent, Vice President Humphrey, claimed that Americans had never had it so good, he should tell that to the farmer. Nixon pledged that he would give special attention to agricultural issues and would make the Secretary of Agriculture a farmer's advocate to the White House. He promised to restore order: [...] "The most important civil right is the right to be free from [...] violence." [...] He noted the many youths in the crowd, stating, [...] "Young <b>Americans</b> <b>know</b> their future is at stake. They don't want four more years of the same." [...] He recalled that his father had hailed from Ohio: [...] "his roots are here and mine are too!" [...] As Nixon spoke, Cole observed him, and thought he was a good family man, looking warm and friendly and appearing much as she expected him to. She later stated that she did not even look at the sign until she was teased about it by a classmate, who suggested the sign, [...] "Bring Us Together Again" [...] was about boys, not politics. She kept the dress, but told the media she threw away the sign.|$|E
500|$|The film {{received}} a mixed critical response. In a review for Time magazine entitled [...] "Just Another Mississippi Whitewash", author Jack E. White described {{the film as}} a [...] "cinematic lynching of the truth". He wrote, [...] "It is bad enough that most <b>Americans</b> <b>know</b> next to nothing about {{the true story of}} the civil rights movement. It would be even worse for them to embrace the fabrications in Mississippi Burning." [...] Columnist Desson Howe of The Washington Post believed that the film [...] "speeds down the complicated, painful path of civil rights in search of a good thriller. Surprisingly, it finds it". He felt the film was a [...] "Hollywood-movie triumph that blacks could have used more of during – and since – that era." [...] Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader, lightly criticized Parker's direction, commenting that the film was [...] "sordid fantasy" [...] being [...] "trained on the murder of three civil rights workers in Mississippi in 1964, and the feast for the self-righteous that emerges {{has little to do with}} history, sociology, or even common sense." [...] Rita Kempley of The Washington Post wrote, [...] "...like the South African saga Cry Freedom, it views the black struggle from an all-white perspective. And there's something of the demon itself in that. It's the right story, but with the wrong heroes." [...] Pauline Kael, writing for The New Yorker, praised the acting, but criticized the film's [...] "garish forms of violence" [...] and described it as [...] "morally repugnant".|$|E

500|$|Adams is {{generally}} {{less well known}} than many of America's other founding fathers. McCullough argued that [...] "he problem with Adams is that most <b>Americans</b> <b>know</b> nothing about him." [...] Todd Leopold of CNN added in 2001 that Adams is [...] "remembered as that guy who served a single term as president between Washington and Jefferson, and as a short, vain, somewhat rotund man whose stature {{seems to have been}} dwarfed by his lanky colleagues." [...] He has always been seen, Ferling says, as [...] "honest and dedicated," [...] but despite his lengthy career in public service, is still overshadowed by the dramatic explanations and strong personalities of his contemporaries. Gilbert Chinard, in his 1933 biography of Adams, described the man as [...] "staunch, honest stubborn and somewhat narrow." [...] In his 1962 biography, Page Smith lauds Adams for his fight against radicals such as Thomas Paine, whose promised reforms portended anarchy and misery. In 1995, Peter Shaw published The Character of John Adams. Ferling says that the man who emerges is one [...] "perpetually at war with himself," [...] whose desire for fame and recognition leads to changes of vanity. Ferling, in his 1992 biography, writes that [...] "Adams was his own worst enemy." [...] He criticizes Adams for his [...] "pettiness...jealousy, and vanity," [...] and finds fault with him for his frequent separations from his wife and children. However, he praises Adams for his willingness to acknowledge his deficiencies and for striving to overcome them. In 2001, David McCullough published a biography of the president entitled John Adams. McCullough lauds Adams for consistency and honesty, [...] "plays down or explains away" [...] his more controversial actions, such as the dispute over presidential titles and the predawn flight from the White House, and criticizes his friend and rival, Jefferson. The book was very favorably received and, along with other biographies published not long before, contributed to a rapid surge in Adams' reputation.|$|E

[...] He also writes, [...] "Today we are facing a threat to the very foundation our founders laid. That threat does not come from an alien force but from those who are willing and determined to abandon the concept of God-given rights. Like the royalty during the Revolution, today's elites wish to return to the pre-Revolutionary paradigm in which they, through governmental force, allocate rights and responsibilities." ...|$|E

2500|$|The roti wrap quickly gained {{popularity}} {{across the}} island and spread {{throughout the rest of}} the Caribbean. Roti shops are now abundant in Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname, Jamaica, the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands, and the wrapped roti a staple street food. The wrap is now simply referred to as a roti or just roti. As Indo-Caribbeans moved to North American cities such as Toronto, New York, Miami, Los Angeles, and Montreal, they exported with them the wrapped version of roti. This iconic version is what most North <b>Americans</b> <b>know</b> as roti. The growth in popularity has recently led to referring to the flat-bread itself (roti) that surrounds the filling as a [...] "roti skin" [...] or [...] "roti shell", a practice that is now common in both restaurants and commercial companies.|$|E
2500|$|Rick Mercer tours the United States, {{talking to}} Americans {{as if from}} a Canadian news program, asking them about [...] "Canadian issues." [...] The object is to see how little some <b>Americans</b> <b>know</b> about their {{northern}} neighbours. The piece was so popular that the CBC had Mercer create a one-hour TV special based on the segment. It became the highest rated comedy special in Canadian television history when it aired on Canada Day, 2001. Some truly memorable bits include Mercer getting Americans to say [...] "Congratulations Canada on legalizing VCRs!" [...] and getting a professor at Princeton University to sign a petition against the re-starting of the Annual Toronto Polar Bear Hunt. In an election 2000 segment, he convinced then-Governor of Texas George W. Bush that Canada's Prime Minister Jean Chrétien was named Jean Poutine and that he was supporting Bush's candidacy. The success of the CBC special got Mercer attention on numerous American media outlets, including ABC's Nightline. Mercer abandoned the concept after September 11, 2001.|$|E

60|$|When he was urged in San Francisco, years afterward, {{to write}} {{more of the}} inimitable things that filled those two volumes, {{he said that it}} was only fun, a boy's work. Only fun! There has never been such delicious fun since the {{beginning}} of literature, and there is nothing better than fun. Yet it held his own peculiar quality, which is not that of American fun,--quality of a brilliant intellectuality: the keenness of a rapier, a teasing subtlety, a contempt for pharisaism and squeamishness, and above all a fine philosophy. While he has never lost his sense of the whimsical, the grotesque, the unusual, he--unfortunately, perhaps--came oftener to give it the form of pure wit rather than of cajoling humor. Few <b>Americans</b> <b>know</b> him as a humorist, because his humor is not built on the broad, rough lines that are typically American. It belongs to an older civilization, yet it is jollier than the English and bolder than the French.|$|E

60|$|Now {{the point}} is not only that this view of the Irish is false, but that it is the {{particular}} view that the <b>Americans</b> <b>know</b> to be false. While we are saying that the Irish could not organise, the Americans are complaining, often very bitterly, of the power of Irish organisation. While we say that the Irishman could not rule himself, the Americans are saying, more or less humorously, that the Irishman rules them. A highly intelligent professor said to me in Boston, 'We have solved the Irish problem here; we have an entirely independent Irish Government.' While we are complaining, in an almost passionate manner, of the impotence of mere cliques of idealists and dreamers, they are complaining, often in a very indignant manner, of the power of great gangs of bosses and bullies. There are a great many Americans who pity the Irish, very naturally and very rightly, for the historic martyrdom which their patriotism has endured. But there are a great many Americans who do not pity the Irish in the least. They would be much more likely to pity the English; only this particular way of talking tends rather to make them despise the English. Thus both the friends of Ireland and the foes of Ireland tend to be the foes of England. We make one set of enemies by our action, and another by our apology.|$|E
