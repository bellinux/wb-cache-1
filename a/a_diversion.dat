5|$|Another Malta convoy (Operation Substance) was {{conducted}} in mid-July, heavily escorted by Force H and elements of the Home Fleet and another in early August (Operation Style), albeit with only Force H covering the convoy. Several weeks later, Fury participated in Operation Mincemeat, during which Force H escorted a minelayer to Livorno to lay its mines while Ark Royals aircraft attacked Northern Sardinia as <b>a</b> <b>diversion.</b> In late September, the destroyer escorted another convoy to Malta in Operation Halberd.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{seasonal}} high rainfall in the Shinano's watershed {{the fertile}} farmlands on the Niigata plain {{were subjected to}} flooding every {{three to four years}} which destroyed crops, particularly rice, and villages. Attempts from local residents to secure funding to build <b>a</b> <b>diversion</b> channel began in the mid-early eighteenth century, during the Kyōhō era. Government support was not secured until the early twentieth century following severe flooding and inundation in 1896.|$|E
5|$|General E. P. Scammon led the December expedition, {{which was}} <b>a</b> <b>{{diversion}}</b> with mixed results. The {{purpose of the}} diversion was to draw Confederate forces away from a Union force led by General Averell, which was conducting a raid on the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad near Salem, Virginia. Although Scammon captured Lewisburg, he soon retreated—making the situation for Averell more difficult. Beginning December 1863, the regiment {{became part of the}} 3rd Brigade, 3rd Division, Army of West Virginia.|$|E

With the rest of the cavalry reserve he attacked Gregory's flank. Here again, under simultaneous attacks from the front and flanks, the Byzantines fell back, but more slowly because they had to maintain their formation.|$|E

5|$|Although several German states {{initially}} {{sided with}} Austria, they {{stayed on the}} defensive and failed to take effective initiatives against Prussian troops. The Austrian army therefore faced the technologically superior Prussian army with support only from Saxony. France promised aid, but it came late and was insufficient. Complicating the situation for Austria, the Italian mobilization on Austria's southern border required <b>a</b> <b>diversion</b> of forces away from battle with Prussia to fight the Third Italian War of Independence on a second front in Venetia and on the Adriatic sea. The day-long Battle of Königgrätz, {{near the village of}} Sadová, gave Prussia an uncontested and decisive victory.|$|E

They barely make it, losing the lawyer in the process, but discover a large group of Martians stationed there as they are preparing to take off. Byron creates <b>a</b> <b>diversion</b> by challenging them to a fistfight. While he succeeds in killing the Ambassador, he is outnumbered and overwhelmed, but Tom, Barbara and Cindy escape.|$|E
5|$|Before Crisis {{opens with}} the trainee Turks {{on a mission}} {{in the city of}} Midgar to {{investigate}} AVALANCHE activities. With help from Reno, AVALANCHE retreat. However, the attack proves to be <b>a</b> <b>diversion</b> for a greater strike at the town of Junon, where President Shinra is set to give a speech. President Shinra is shot, but survives, and calls in Sephiroth. However, it transpires that even the attack on the President was <b>a</b> <b>diversion,</b> and AVALANCHE's real target was a weapon called the Mako Cannon, which they planned to fire at Midgar, destroying the city. Elfé and Sephiroth do battle at the cannon, but the fight ends inconclusively, and AVALANCHE withdraw. AVALANCHE next target Rayleigh a professor carrying data on the SOLDIER members and their creation. The Turks are sent to protect Rayleigh, accompanied by several Shinra guards, including Cloud. Fuhito, a scientist working for AVALANCHE, is able to corrupt Rayleigh's data when the Turks disobey orders and save Rayleigh instead of protecting the information. Using the SOLDIER data, Fuhito develops an elite unit known as the Ravens, using them to capture two SOLDIERs, Essai and Sebastian. The Turks succeed in rescuing the pair, and are then sent to destroy AVALANCHE, accompanied by Zack. Essai and Sebastian, however, are captured once again, and turned into Ravens. Even though Zack is able to bring them back to their senses, he is unable to save them.|$|E

5|$|Changes in {{direction}} {{of this nature}} are most commonly observed {{as a result of}} a cyclone's interaction with other low pressure systems, troughs, ridges, or with anticyclones. A strong and stationary anticyclone can effectively block the path of an extratropical cyclone. Such blocking patterns are quite normal, and will generally result in a weakening of the cyclone, the weakening of the anticyclone, <b>a</b> <b>diversion</b> of the cyclone towards the anticyclone's periphery, or a combination of all three to some extent depending on the precise conditions. It is also common for an extratropical cyclone to strengthen as the blocking anticyclone or ridge weakens in these circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Chao have {{appeared}} in many games in the series, beginning with Sonic Adventure in 1998. They usually {{take the form of}} digital pets, but have also played parts in the story and figured into other gameplay elements. Most notably, the character Cream the Rabbit has a Chao named Cheese, whom she uses to attack enemies. They have also appeared in games outside the series, the Sonic the Hedgehog comics, and the Sonic X anime, as well as being featured in promotions and merchandise. Critics have given mixed opinions on Chao and their integration into Sonic gameplay, generally praising their worth as <b>a</b> <b>diversion</b> but criticizing Chao minigames' low interactivity.|$|E
5|$|Cord and Chi {{infiltrate}} Nagarov's base {{to destroy}} the Super Computer. On {{the roof of a}} large tower, Cord destroys a building with a surface-to-air missile launcher to create <b>a</b> <b>diversion.</b> When he meets with Chi again, she is being threatened by Kostov, who thinks she has betrayed his men. Chi kills Kostov before he can pull the trigger. With Chi's help, Cord uses an elevator to go {{to the top of the}} tower and he activates a cable car leading to an island. Cord explores the docking area, and he finds Alexandria in a cell on the security level. Cord uses the main elevator in the complex to access the other levels. Cord creates <b>a</b> <b>diversion</b> and enters level 1, where he inserts the explosive charge into the Super Computer. A cut scene is shown that reveals that Alpha has betrayed him. In a transmission, she tells that premier Nagarov had to be certain that Cord was not acting on her orders when he attacked the refinery. She assured Nagarov that Cord had not entered the facility, but Nagarov had a recording of Cord in the refinery. It resulted in a simple policy shift and the British are now working with the Volgians. As the reactor becomes critical, Nagarov and Lukyan leave the room. Until this moment, the game has taken place in Cord's memory, as he was interrogated by Nagarov after being captured, but from this point on it takes place in real time.|$|E

40|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of the ileal conduit more than four decades ago, the options for urinary diversion after cystectomy were extremely limited. Direct cutaneous anastomoses of the collecting system (cutaneous pyelostomies, ureterostomies) offered patients <b>a</b> short-term <b>diversion,</b> but the benefits were outweighed by significant complications: recession or stenosis of the stoma. The first choice of diversion was the ureterosigmoidostomy with or without antireflux technique. Then it fell in popularity and was replaced with continent/non-continent uretero-ileo-cutaneous diversions. Only in the last years the continent orthotopic neobladder has been widely employed as first procedure choice. At present, patients can be offered <b>a</b> non-continent cutaneous <b>diversion,</b> <b>a</b> continent cutaneous <b>diversion</b> or <b>an</b> orthotopic neobladder urinary reconstructio...|$|R

Immediately to the north, the Canadians were supported by XVIII Corps and after an inter-army boundary shift, II Corps of the Second Army. To the extreme north, the advance was supported by diversionary attacks by the British XIV Corps and the 1st and 133rd Divisions of the French First Army. To the south, the right flank of the Canadian advance was supported by I Anzac Corps. Further south, X Corps supported the operation by attacking Gheluvelt to secure Tower Hamlets ridge, east of the Bassevillebeek as <b>a</b> <b>diversion.</b>|$|E
5|$|Heated debate arose among Westmoreland, Commandant of the Marine Corps Leonard F. Chapman, Jr. and Army Chief of Staff Harold K. Johnson. Johnson {{backed the}} Marine {{position}} {{due to his}} concern over protecting the Army's air assets from Air Force co-option. Westmoreland was so obsessed with the tactical situation that he threatened to resign if his wishes were not obeyed. As a result, on 7 March, {{for the first time}} during the Vietnam War, air operations were placed under the control of a single manager. Westmoreland insisted for several months that the entire Tet Offensive was <b>a</b> <b>diversion</b> including, famously, attacks on downtown Saigon and obsessively affirming that the true objective of the North Vietnamese was Khe Sanh.|$|E

Grandmasters such as Joel Benjamin, Yasser Seirawan, Andy Soltis, John Nunn, Jon Speelman, Sergey Karjakin, Michael Adams, Emil Sutovsky and Michael Rohde have been known to play the game. One of the strongest matches on record took place following the 2014 Sinquefield Cup, with Magnus Carlsen and Maxime Vachier-Lagrave teaming up against Fabiano Caruana and Levon Aronian – all four being among the top ten chess players in the world at the time.|$|E
5|$|On 19 and 20 October, the 4th Armoured Brigade was {{involved}} in its first action as a brigade in an attack towards the Savio River, with the 20th Armoured Regiment on the left flank. This was primarily a tank action, in contrast to previous battles in which the armour supported the infantry. Having advanced seven miles to complete its objectives, the regiment supported the 2nd Canadian Infantry Brigade in making its own attack across the river {{on the evening of}} 21 October. The regiment's Shermans fired an hour-long barrage of high explosive shells along their front to create <b>a</b> <b>diversion,</b> under the cover of which the Canadians made their own landings on the far bank of the Savio.|$|E
