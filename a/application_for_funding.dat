500|$|In 2016 the pub {{was listed}} as an asset of {{community}} value by Medway Council. The building was then Grade II listed by Historic England on 24 May 2016 due to its architectural interest and the intactness of the pre-1840 parts of the building, excluding the later extensions (aside from the first extension to the rear) and modern bar fittings. Plans to demolish the building were withdrawn in May 2016. The [...] "Save The Royal Oak, Frindsbury" [...] campaign started seeking funding to buy the pub to re-open it for the community, alongside a loan from the UK Government's [...] "Pub Loan Fund" [...] and an <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>funding</b> to the Plunkett Foundation, in a six month period from November 2016. The asking price was £450,000 plus VAT (excluding the garden), significantly more than the developer purchased the site for and was seen as unreasonable, despite several expressions of interest.|$|E
500|$|The Australia Council's {{decision}} to fund Escape from Woomera was poorly received. The game received heavy criticism before development even began. Australia's Minister for Immigration, Philip Ruddock, {{released a statement}} saying that the [...] "decision reflects poorly upon the Australia Council and its judgement, that the organisation should lend its name to the promotion of unlawful behaviour". Kate Wild, in a 2013 interview, recalled that she was surprised at how strongly Ruddock attacked the game, a reaction she attributed to the government being sensitive over the issue of detainee treatment. The leader of the Australian Human Rights Commission, Dr. Sev Ozdowski, released a strongly worded statement accusing the game of misconstruing asylum seekers as criminals, and saying that [...] "The idea of using issues in detention for entertainment is simply sick." [...] Chairman Michael Snelling of the New Media Arts Board, the branch of the Australia Council that granted the development money, defended the {{decision to}} fund Escape from Woomera, stating that the game's purpose was not to promote crime. He characterised the team's <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>funding</b> as both strong and closely aligned with the New Media Arts Board's goal of promoting cross-disciplinary media.|$|E

2500|$|The State alleged, however, {{that several}} things {{were done in}} return. A former {{business}} associate of Shaik, Professor Themba Sono, told the court that Shaik told business partners that the Nkobi group could bring [...] "political connectivity" [...] to the table. Shaik said {{what he meant by}} political connectivity was Black Economic Empowerment (BEE). Professor John Lennon of Caledonian University in Glasgow told the court that Zuma advised him to use Nkobi as the South African partner for a proposed eco-tourism school. When Lennon seemed hesitant, Shaik threatened to derail the proposal and tell Zuma. A feasibility study for the project was cancelled after the government of the United Kingdom refused an <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>funding.</b> Shaik denied that he {{had anything to do with}} the sudden decline of the project. He said that his [...] "unfortunate" [...] correspondence with Lennon was prompted by his reaction to being [...] "sidelined." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although he was {{expected}} to embed the Project's research within a wider theoretical context, it soon became apparent that the Project was primarily concerned with data collection to be used by administrators for establishing whether groups of listeners could be targeted by broadcasts specifically aimed at them. Expected to make use of devices with which listeners could press a button to indicate whether they liked or disliked a particular piece of music, Adorno bristled with distaste and astonishment: [...] "I reflected that culture was simply the condition that precluded a mentality that tried to measure it." [...] Thus Adorno suggested using individual interviews to determine listener reactions and, only three months after meeting Lazarsfeld, completed a 160-page memorandum on the Project's topic, [...] "Music in Radio." [...] Adorno was primarily interested in how the musical material was affected by its distribution through the medium of radio and thought it imperative to understand how music was affected by its becoming part of daily life. [...] "The meaning of a Beethoven symphony," [...] he wrote, [...] "heard while the listener is walking around or lying in bed is very likely to differ from its effect in a concert-hall where people sit as if they were in church." [...] In essays published by the Institute's Zeitschrift, Adorno dealt with that atrophy of musical culture which had become instrumental in accelerating tendencies—towards conformism, trivialization and standardization—already present in the larger culture. Unsurprisingly, Adorno's studies found little resonance among members of the project. At the end of 1939, when Lazarsfeld submitted a second <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>funding,</b> the musical section of the study was duly left out. Yet during the two years during which he worked on the Project, Adorno was nevertheless prolific, publishing [...] "The Radio Symphony", [...] "A Social Critique of Radio Music", and [...] "On Popular Music", texts which, along with the draft memorandum and other unpublished writings, are now found in Robert Hullot-Kentor's recent translation, Current of Music. In light of this situation, Horkheimer soon found a permanent post for Adorno at the Institute.|$|E
