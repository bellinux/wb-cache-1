Sections of the roof have translucent sheeting for light, and the eastern end is supported by scaffolding.

25|$|In {{low-rise}} structures, {{the support}} rooms (chillers, transformers, boilers, pumps and <b>air</b> <b>handling</b> units) {{can be put}} in basements or roof space—areas which have low rental value. There is, however, {{a limit to how}} far this plant can be located from the area it serves. The farther away it is the larger the risers for ducts and pipes from this plant to the floors they serve and the more floor area these risers take. In practice this means that in highrise buildings this plant is located on 'plant levels' at intervals up the building.|$|E
25|$|The new Social Sciences Building at the University of Ottawa is the university’s latest green initiative. The fifteen-storey {{building}} that took {{about four years}} of planning and construction to complete opened its doors in September 2012. The Social Sciences Building that cost {{a grand total of}} $112.5 million provides students and faculty with an array of space for individual studying and group work. This building is the newest addition to the University of Ottawa with its green and sustainable architecture and facilities. This building is very different among the rest of the university’s buildings as its structure and characteristics are very eco-friendly. Some features that the building includes are: construction materials that were chosen due to their recycled content, a living wall that is five stories tall and composed of numerous plants that with act as an air filtration system, and a green roof. The green wall is the tallest living biofilter wall in North America. The wall is situated in the main agora of the Faculty of Social Science building and is visible from the outside. The green wall is a unique component of the building’s <b>air</b> <b>handling</b> system, for it is capable of treating a large quantity of air at a time, and it provides a source of humidity that doesn’t need to be artificially introduced.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—According to the nonlinear, {{time-varying}} variable, large lag {{and other}} properties of <b>air</b> <b>handle</b> system, the improved ant colony algorithm is adopted {{to optimize the}} <b>air</b> <b>handle</b> system energy consumption. First, mathematical model of wind system of central air conditioning energy consumption is established for improved ant colony algorithm to optimize the model of energy consumption minimization. The improved ant colony algorithm solves the defect of directly deal with continuous optimization problem using ant colony algorithm by discretizing the solution space of continuous function. The experimental results show that, the improved ant colony algorithm can be successfully used in <b>air</b> <b>handle</b> system of HVAC, and has achieved an execellent effect of energy-saving.

2500|$|The AirPort Base Station was {{discontinued}} {{after the}} updated AirPort Extreme was [...] on January 7, 2003. In {{addition to providing}} wireless connection speeds of up {{to a maximum of}} 54Mbit/s, it adds an external antenna port and a USB port. The antenna port allows the addition of a signal-boosting antenna, and the USB port allows the sharing of a USB printer. A connected printer is made available via Bonjour's [...] "zero configuration" [...] technology and IPP to all wired and wireless clients on the network. The CPU is an AU1500-333MBC Alchemy (processor). A second model (...) lacking the modem and external antenna port was briefly made available, but then discontinued after the launch of AirPort Express (see below). On April 19, 2004, a third version, marketed as the AirPort Extreme Base Station (with Power over Ethernet and UL 2043), was introduced that supports Power over Ethernet and complies to the UL 2043 specifications for safe usage in <b>air</b> <b>handling</b> spaces, such as above suspended ceilings. All three models support the Wireless Distribution System (WDS) standard. The model introduced in January 2007 does not have a corresponding PoE, UL-compliant variant.|$|E
6000|$|But now, {{approaching}} {{the child in}} this close, intimate, and helpful way, it was very evident that his interest took a tenderer character. There was everything in the boy, that a boy could possess, to attract affection; {{he would have been}} a father's pride and joy. Doctor Grimshawe, indeed, was not his father; but to a person of his character this was perhaps no cause of lesser love than if there had been the whole of that holy claim of kindred between them. We speak of the natural force of blood; we speak of the paternal relation as if it were productive of more earnest affection than can exist between two persons, one of whom is protective, but unrelated. But there are wild, forcible, unrestricted characters, on whom the necessity and even duty of loving their own child is a sort of barrier to love. They perhaps do not love their own traits, which they recognize in their children; they shrink from their own features in the reflection presented by these little mirrors. A certain strangeness and unlikeness (such as gives poignancy to the love between the sexes) would excite a livelier affection. Be this as it may, it is not probable that Doctor Grimshawe would have loved a child of his own blood, with the coarse characteristics that he knew both in his race and himself, with nearly such fervor as this beautiful, slender, yet strenuous, intelligent, refined boy,--with such a high-bred <b>air,</b> <b>handling</b> common things with so refined a touch, yet grasping them so firmly; throwing a natural grace on all he did. Was he not his father,--he that took this fair blossom out of the sordid mud in which he must soon have withered and perished? Was not this beautiful strangeness, which he so wondered at, the result of his care? ...|$|E

40|$|Demands from {{consumers}} and industry for faster transports of goods have fuelled {{the rapid growth}} in air freight transportation during the previous decades. It {{has been shown to}} be an important means in the movement of goods in support of supply chains on a global scale. The authors of this thesis discovered that there was little research previously conducted when it concerns risk within the industry, specifically concerned with <b>air</b> freight <b>handling</b> processes. Subsequently, the purpose of this thesis is to identify and explore risk factors within the <b>air</b> freight <b>handling</b> processes. Furthermore, the research questions seek to critically examine who the actors are within the process and what roles they have. The thesis then identifies the key elements of risk within the process, and how the actors concerned manage, control, and address them. Furthermore, ways in which this could be improved were explored. To address the research problem, the authors approached this using a single embedded case study based on the <b>air</b> freight <b>handling</b> processes located at Jönköping airport. Data was collected using observations and interviews with four key participants of the specific <b>air</b> freight <b>handling</b> process. The empirical data was then analysed using four key themes’ derived from theory. Furthermore, propositions were presented from the results that emerged from the data which could be used a basis for further research. The findings that address the thesis’ research purpose and questions indicate that the major elements of risk exist are that of physical and financial. In addressing these risks, the actors involved in <b>air</b> freight <b>handling</b> processes were flexible and pro-active their activities. Furthermore, the analysis indicated that reducing dependency could be a way to further improve how these risks are managed...|$|R
