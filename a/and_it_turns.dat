5|$|On U.S. Navy vessels, even-numbered {{compartments}} {{are found}} on the port side, but zero is reserved for compartments that intersect the centerline. That is, the numbers read 6-4-2-0-1-3-5 from port to starboard. In the game of roulette, the number 0 does not count as even or odd, giving the casino an advantage on such bets. Similarly, the parity of zero can affect payoffs in prop bets when the outcome depends on whether some randomized number is odd or even, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>turns</b> out to be zero.|$|E
5|$|MN610 {{starts at}} a partial {{interchange}} with I-94 in Maple Grove; eastbound traffic on I-94 can exit to MN610, and westbound traffic on MN610 merges onto westbound I-94. From there, the freeway continues eastward through an interchange with Maple Grove Parkway, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>turns</b> southeasterly to its interchange with CR81 in Maple Grove. From this point, the freeway runs eastbound through the northern suburbs of the Twin Cities. MN610 is four lanes in width and has several interchanges with local streets and county roads before expanding to six lanes and meeting the northern terminus of MN252 {{on the west}} bank of the Mississippi River. After MN252 interchange, the MN610 freeway turns to the northeast and crosses the Mississippi River on the dual-span, eight-lane Richard P. Braun Bridge.|$|E

Tilly, a lesbian, hopes {{that one of}} the gang leaders, Pussy Galore (leader of a gang of lesbian burglars), will protect her, but she is killed by Oddjob. Goldfinger, Oddjob and the mafia bosses all escape in the melee. Bond is drugged before his flight back to England and wakes to find he has been {{captured}} by Goldfinger, who has managed to hijack a BOAC jetliner. Bond manages to break a window, causing a depressurisation that blows Oddjob out of the plane; he then fights and strangles Goldfinger. At gunpoint, he forces the crew to ditch in the sea near the Canadian coast, where they are rescued by a nearby weathership.|$|E

5|$|Route 75 {{starts at}} a T {{intersection}} at Route 80 east of East Prairie, and it travels north through farmland as a two-lane road.

It intersects CRD 332 after crossing over the ditch, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>turns</b> west {{at the western}} and southern termini of Route DD and CRD 337, respectively. Route 75 then enters the city of Anniston, crossing over the White Pond inside the city limits.

The route re-enters the farmland, intersecting CRD 343. It then crosses over the Wolf Hole Lateral, and ends at another T intersection at Route 105, south of the Mississippi County Airport.|$|E
5|$|The second plot of {{the episode}} {{revolves}} around Jerry; when he prepares {{to go to the}} laundromat, Kramer asks him to take his laundry with him. Jerry agrees after some reluctance, insisting that their clothes remain segregated. After retrieving the laundry the following day and returning Kramer's portion, Jerry remembers that he had hidden a large sum of money in his laundry bag, but is unable to find it. The owner of the laundromat (John Capodice), tells him that he did not see the money, but also points out that he is not responsible for valuables. Kramer and Jerry both assume Vic stole the money and Kramer comes {{up with a plan to}} put cement mix in one of Vic's washing machines as revenge. Once they have acted out the plan, Kramer discovers that he had the money all along; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>turns</b> out to be just enough to cover the damage to the washing machine.|$|E

25|$|The {{concept of}} exact {{sequence}} arises naturally in this setting, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>turns</b> out that exact functors, i.e. the functors preserving exact sequences in various senses, are the relevant functors between Abelian categories. This exactness concept has been axiomatized {{in the theory}} of exact categories, forming a very special case of regular categories.|$|E
25|$|Though some {{of their}} amplitudes have {{opposite}} phases, both quarks and anti-quarks have positive energy, and hence acquire the same phase as they move in space-time. This phase also depends on their mass, which is identical but depends both on flavor and on the Higgs VEV which changes along the domain wall. Thus certain sums of amplitudes for quarks have different absolute values compared to those of anti-quarks. In all, quarks and anti-quarks may have different reflection and transmission probabilities through the domain wall, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>turns</b> out that more quarks coming from the unbroken phase are transmitted compared to anti-quarks.|$|E

Billy's next stop is Wembley Stadium and again he discovers the torchbearers have already left.

25|$|This {{is a total}} {{preorder}} <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>turns</b> into a {{total order}} if we agree not to distinguish between two sequences a and b if a≤b and b≤a. With this identification, the ordered field *R of hyperreals is constructed. From an algebraic point of view, U allows us to define a corresponding maximal ideal I in the commutative ring A (namely, {{the set of the}} sequences that vanish in some element of U), and then to define *R as A/I; as the quotient of a commutative ring by a maximal ideal, *R is a field. This is also notated A/U, directly in terms of the free ultrafilter U; the two are equivalent. The maximality of I follows from the possibility of, given a sequence a, constructing a sequence b inverting the non-null elements of a and not altering its null entries. If the set on which a vanishes is not in U, the product ab is identified with the number 1, and any ideal containing 1 must be A. In the resulting field, these a and b are inverses.|$|E
