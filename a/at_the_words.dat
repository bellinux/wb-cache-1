A 1640s painting by the Spanish painter Bartolomé Esteban Murillo or an artist of his school, in which the words were hidden until restoration work in 1911, depicts an imprisoned Galileo apparently gazing <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> [...] "E pur si muove" [...] written {{on the wall of}} his dungeon.

Later, Bernard Bergonzi claimed that [...] "The Dry Salvages is the least {{satisfactory}} of the sequence, though {{at the same time it}} contains some of its best lines. The opening lines are poor, in a weakly sub-Whitmanesque fashion. Yet the writing suddenly picks up <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>words,</b> 'The river is within us,' and from there to the end of the section we have a magnificently sustained sequence". F. B. Pinion believed that [...] "'The Dry Salvages' is a complicated, uneven, and rather prosy poem, in which Eliot continues to say the same thing, with some progression, mainly in maritime imagery".|$|E

2500|$|In the Baroque and Classical eras quintuple meter is, if anything, {{even less}} {{frequently}} encountered {{than in the}} Renaissance. Johann Heinrich Schmelzer included a [...] section of 27 measures in his Harmonia à 5, composed by at least 1668.

Charles Burney found this whole scene admirable, as a portrait of Orlando's madness, but observed that [...] "Handel has endeavoured to describe the hero's perturbation of intellect by fragments of symphony in , a division of time {{which can only be}} borne in such a situation". Burney's German contemporary, Johann Kirnberger, also felt that [...] "No one can repeat groups of five and even less of seven equal pulses in succession without wearisome strain". Another exceptional 18th-century example is an entire aria composed in [...] time, [...] "Se la sorte mi condanna" [...] found in Andrea Adolfati's opera Arianna (1750), but the English theater composer William Reeve, with the last movement of his Gypsy's Glee (1796), to the words [...] "Come, stain your cheeks with nut or berry" [...] (in [...] time) is credited with having composed an example in true quintuple time, [...] "for instead of the usual division of the bar into two parts, such as might be expressed by alternate bars of [...] and , or [...] and , there are five distinct beats in every bar, each consisting of an accent and a non-accent.

2500|$|When, at his Last Supper, Jesus said: [...] "This is my body", what he held in {{his hands}} still had all the {{appearances}} of bread: the [...] "species" [...] remained unchanged. However, the Roman Catholic Church teaches that, when Jesus made that declaration, the underlying reality (the [...] "substance") of the bread was changed into that of his body. In other words, it actually was his body, while all the appearances open to the senses or to scientific investigation were still those of bread, exactly as before. The Catholic Church holds that the same change of {{the substance of the}} bread and of the wine occurs at the consecration of the Eucharist when the words are spoken in persona Christi [...] "This is my body ... this is my blood." [...] In Orthodox confessions, the change is said to start during the Dominical or Lord's Words or Institution Narrative and be completed during the Epiklesis. Orthodox from the period of Dominican-Orthodox controversies (witnessed by Nicholas Cabasilas) until the Council of Florence and the [...] "libellus (booklet)" [...] of Mark of Ephesus, held for a double moment of consecration <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> [...] "This is my body/blood" [...] and the epiclesis. Despite {{the fact that this was}} a normative interpretation of the De sacraments and De mysteries of St. Ambrose, as early as Paschasius Radbertus (Ps.-Augustine), John Torquemada opposed the Orthodox position at the Council of Florence. This is all the more ironic since he cited Paschasius Radbertus (as if Augustine) in his Sermo alter in the Acta Latina in order to refute emperor John VIII (who was relying on Mark of Ephesus [...] "libellus"). The end result was that, though authors from Radbertus until St. Bonaventure of Bagnoregio held for the consecratory potential of the epiclesis, Torquemada represented the Dominican position as universal and non-controversial among the Latins. In fact, Torquemada's overconfidence was the result of having studied the works of Pope Benedict XII in his debates against Mark of Ephesus in Ferrara in 1437. Therein, Benedict condemned an alleged Armenian theory (never verified among any of the dozen or so Armenian commentaries from the period) that denied all consecratory value to the words of institution and confined the consecration ONLY to the epiclesis (not the Byzantine position). Lastly, the Armenians were alleged to hold that the eucharistic change was not substantial and only imperfect and typological, and therefore not transubstantiation. The arguments, that Benedict XII's letter to the missionaries (c. 1340) addressed, relied on Aquinas' premises, which was no surprise given Benedict and Pope Clement VI thomistic preferences. However, these arguments were confused for the Byzantine position from Cabasilas to Florence and are still grossly misunderstood among modern and contemporary scholars when attempting to speak of Catholic-Orthodox differences.|$|E
