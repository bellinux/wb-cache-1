25|$|More commonly, women {{participated in}} the {{sciences}} through an association with a male relative or spouse. Caroline Herschel began her astronomical career, although somewhat reluctantly at first, by assisting her brother William Herschel. Caroline Herschel is most remembered for her discovery of eight comets and her Index to Flamsteed’s Observations of the Fixed Stars (1798). On August 1, 1786, Herschel discovered her first comet, much to the excitement of scientifically minded women. Fanny Burney commented on the discovery, stating that “the comet was very small, and had nothing grand or striking in its appearance; {{but it is the}} first lady’s comet, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> desirous to see it.” Marie-Anne Pierette Paulze worked collaboratively with her husband, Antoine Lavoisier. Aside from assisting in Lavoisier’s laboratory research, she was responsible for translating a number of English texts into French for her husband’s work on the new chemistry. Paulze also illustrated many of her husband’s publications, such as his Treatise on Chemistry (1789). Eva Ekeblad became the first woman inducted into the Royal Swedish Academy of Science (1748).|$|E

My dad {{used to call me}} after he'd had a few drinks and I wouldn't know what to say. I was {{speechless}} and I just feared that I would lose him and I wouldn't be there." ...|$|E
500|$|Also in 1933 {{after she}} became First Lady, a rose was {{discovered}} and named after Eleanor, {{with the name}} Mrs. Franklin D. Roosevelt (Rosa x hybrida “Mrs. Franklin D. Roosevelt”). It is a hybrid tea rose. However, though this is true, {{there is no evidence}} to support the story that Eleanor later quipped, [...] "I once had a rose named after me <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> flattered. But I was not pleased to read the description in the catalogue: no good in a bed, but fine up against a wall".|$|E
500|$|Immediately {{following}} The Decision, James {{claimed that}} there was nothing he would change about the handling of his free agency despite all the criticism. During the 2010–11 season, he expressed some regret, admitting, [...] " [...] probably would do it a little bit different ... But I'm happy with my decision." [...] Before the 2011–12 season, he relented, [...] "... if the shoe was on the other foot and I was a fan, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> passionate about one player, and he decided to leave, I would be upset too about the way he handled it." ...|$|E

500|$|Sylvia Anderson {{suggested}} that American audiences, who were less {{familiar with the}} Supermarionation productions of Century 21, were more enthusiastic. She explained, [...] "It was {{all too easy to}} compare our real actors with our puppet characters and descriptions such as 'wooden', 'expressionless', 'no strings attached' and 'puppet-like' were cheap shots some of the UK critics could not resist... Typecasting is the lazy man's friend, and boy, were we typecast in Britain." [...] On Doppelgänger, she said in 1992, [...] "I saw it on TV {{a couple of years ago}} <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> pleased with it. I thought it came over quite well." ...|$|E
500|$|I {{happened}} to be at Cambridge. I was sent there by the [...] government on a government grant. And I'd read some of Ted's poems in this magazine <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> impressed and I wanted to meet him. I went to this little celebration and that's actually where we met... Then we saw {{a great deal of}} each other. Ted came back to Cambridge and suddenly we found ourselves getting married a few months later... We kept writing poems to each other. Then it just grew out of that, I guess, a feeling that we both were writing so much and having such a fine time doing it, we decided that this should keep on.|$|E
500|$|The band {{then took}} a lengthy break to compose more tracks for Parachutes. A few months later, it was {{arranged}} that Allison and the band meet at a rehearsal room to finally begin production on the band's debut album. [...] "They started up playing in the rehearsal room and they really weren't together at all. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> honest with them, I just sort of said 'Look, this simply isn't good enough'". Allison adds, [...] "The interesting, the most significant thing that did occur out {{of the fact that}} we didn't end up starting the album on that day of the rehearsal was that Chris Martin had not written 'Yellow' by that time".|$|E

500|$|Residents of Mokhoyan, {{a village}} about 500 metres east of Camp Belamby, stated that a bomb had {{exploded}} in their vicinity on 8 March, destroying an armored vehicle and wounding several U.S. soldiers. They recounted that U.S. soldiers afterwards lined {{many of the}} male villagers against a wall, threatening to [...] "get revenge for this incident by killing at least 20 of your people," [...] and threatening that [...] "you and your children will pay for this". One Mokhoyan resident told The Associated Press [...] "It {{looked like they were}} going to shoot us, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> afraid." [...] U.S. officials from The Pentagon declared that they had [...] "no evidence" [...] that villagers had been lined up against a wall and threatened in Mokhoyan. U.S. officials refused to confirm or deny that U.S. soldiers were wounded outside the village on 8 March.|$|E
500|$|Bigelow was {{motivated}} to start work on Strange Days shortly {{after a series}} of cultural incidents that occurred in the United States in the early nineties, such as the Lorena Bobbitt trial and the 1992 Los Angeles riots that followed the Rodney King verdict. Referring to the latter, she noted, [...] "I was involved in the downtown cleanup, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> moved by that experience. You got a palpable sense of the anger and frustration and economic disparity in which we live." [...] She also developed the character of Mace from Cameron's original script to make [...] "valuable connections between female victimisation and racial oppression." [...] Both Strange Days and Cameron's 1994 action film True Lies were part of a multimillion-dollar production deal between Lightstorm Entertainment and 20th Century Fox. However, the financing was unevenly divided between the two films, with Strange Days being initially budgeted at $30 million and True Lies at $70 million.|$|E
500|$|The episode also reintroduced the storyline of Paul Young and Felicia Tilman's rivalry. Mark Moses {{returned}} to the series as a series regular after appearing briefly as Paul in the sixth season finale. On his return, Moses commented, [...] "There was some talk about [...] a year ago. And there’s often talk in Hollywood. Sometimes it pans out, sometimes it doesn’t. I don’t get super-excited about a 'maybe' in this town, because {{there are lots of}} maybes that don’t happen. But then this last year they called up my agent and said, 'We're really thinking seriously about [...]' And eventually, they made an offer, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> pleased." [...] Harriet Samson Harris also {{returned to}} reprise her role as Felicia, while Steven Culp and Christine Estabrook returned as Rex Van de Kamp and Martha Huber respectively in flashback sequences. Kyle MacLachlan, who left Desperate Housewives as a series regular at the end of season six, reprised his role as Orson Hodge in this episode.|$|E

She <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> good friends, but she don't confide much in me. But one thing <b>I</b> <b>am</b> pretty sure of, {{and that is that}} she is dreadfully angry with my cousin Junius, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>very</b> sorry for that." ...|$|R
500|$|In {{his role}} as producer, Iwakami took a mostly {{hands-off}} approach. Due to Puella Magi Madoka Magica being an original series rather than an adaptation based on an already existing work, he described the main goal solely as [...] "coming up with a high-quality piece of entertainment." [...] After helping to recruit the staff, he allowed them mostly free rein in developing the actual content of the story, providing minimal guidance from himself. After viewing the character designs that Aoki created, he became fully assured that he could trust the creative talent of the team. In an interview with Anime News Network after the series finished airing in Japan, Iwakami summed up his philosophy as [...] "I don't matter much; it's up to those talents to do their work. If something comes to a stand-still I might intervene, but they {{did an excellent job}} <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> happy seeing the results in episode one." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{overtaking}} manoeuvres made by Coulthard on Michael Schumacher {{received much}} media attention after the race. Coulthard accused Michael Schumacher of unsporting behaviour and dangerous driving, saying: [...] "I had a clean run at Michael {{on the outside}} and equally I felt he drove me wide. You could say he had the right to do that because he had the track position, but I think it was a deliberate gesture in trying to run someone wide like that <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> angry." [...] Michael Schumacher later denied any wrongdoing and citied a similar incident at the 1999 Japanese Grand Prix where Coulthard pushed him wide although no objections were made. He also admitted that he did not see Coulthard's hand gesture. Coulthard sought clarification with the FIA over such overtakes with a source from Formula One's governing body noting: [...] "It was hard racing -- they are racing drivers aren't they?" [...] GrandPrix.com said that Coulthard's overtake meant that [...] "He is ready to stand up to Michael and he is not afraid of what will happen if Michael does not lift." ...|$|E
500|$|In March 2011, Aronofsky bowed out of {{directing}} the film, {{saying in a}} statement, [...] "As I talked more about the film with my collaborators at Fox, {{it became clear that}} the production of The Wolverine would keep me out of the country for almost a year.... I was not comfortable being away from my family for that length of time. I am sad that I won't be able to see the project through, as it is a terrific script <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> much looking forward to working with my friend, Hugh Jackman, again". Fox also decided to be [...] "in no rush" [...] to start the production due to the damage incurred in Japan by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. Despite this, Jackman said the project was moving ahead. [...] "It's too early to call on Japan, I'm not sure where they're at. So now we're finding another director, but Fox is very anxious to make the movie and we're moving ahead full steam to find another director".|$|E

500|$|Following their collision, Hamilton and Rosberg were {{summoned to}} the {{stewards}} after the race but neither received a penalty, as the stewards rated their crash as a racing incident, with no driver in particular to blame. It emerged that Rosberg had chosen the wrong engine mode for the start, being down on power which led to Hamilton going for a passing manoeuvre. However, Rosberg remained convinced {{that he had done}} nothing wrong, saying: [...] "I made it very clear I wasn't going to leave any space on the inside <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> surprised he went for the gap". While Hamilton apologised to the team after the incident, he refused to accept blame for it. Opinions about the incident varied: While Mercedes's executive chairman Niki Lauda blamed Hamilton for the crash, former F1 driver Anthony Davidson said on Sky Sports F1 that Rosberg's move was [...] "very aggressive". Three-time world champion Jackie Stewart said after the race that Mercedes should fine Hamilton for the crash: [...] "Hamilton is to blame. Rosberg was allowed to protect himself. You don't go for it on the first lap." [...] Mercedes's head of motorsport Toto Wolff stressed after the race that the team would continue to let their drivers race against each other freely, a decision praised by former world champion Alain Prost. While Rosberg said after the race that he contemplated having a talk with Hamilton about the situation, Mercedes later decided that they did [...] "not need clear-the-air talks". However, it later emerged that the pair did have a conversation about the incident before the next race in Monaco, which, according to Hamilton, was marked by [...] "pure respect". It was Mercedes's first double retirement since the 2011 Australian Grand Prix, and the first time they failed to score a point since the 2012 United States Grand Prix, ending a 62-race long streak, the third longest in Formula One history.|$|E
