5|$|Renaissance art marks a {{cultural}} rebirth {{at the close}} of the Middle Ages and rise of the Modern world. One of the distinguishing features of Renaissance art was its development of highly realistic linear perspective. Giotto di Bondone (1267–1337) is credited with first treating a painting as <b>a</b> <b>window</b> <b>into</b> space, but it was not until the demonstrations of architect Filippo Brunelleschi (1377–1446) and the subsequent writings of Leon Battista Alberti (1404–1472) that perspective was formalized as an artistic technique.|$|E

However, it retains cultural significance and is used for religious chants and to read literature.

25|$|The {{northern}} side of {{the quad}} consists of a building by Jackson, much of which now houses the Bursary. The building is infamous {{as the site of}} the incident novelised in Evelyn Waugh's Brideshead Revisited in which Sebastian Flyte, returning from a Bullingdon Club bender vomits through <b>a</b> <b>window</b> <b>into</b> a ground-floor room.|$|E
25|$|As in his {{commentary}} on the Tanakh, Rashi frequently illustrates {{the meaning of the}} text using analogies to the professions, crafts, and sports of his day. He also translates difficult Hebrew or Aramaic words into the spoken French language of his day, giving latter-day scholars <b>a</b> <b>window</b> <b>into</b> the vocabulary and pronunciation of Old French.|$|E

25|$|Jassin {{wrote that}} Di Bawah Lindungan Ka'bah was {{interesting}} and beautifully written. Siregar found the novel to be a well-crafted story made more powerful by its writing style. The Dutch scholar of Indonesian literature A. Teeuw described Hamka's work as too moralistic and sentimental; {{he wrote that}} a Western reader would at least provide <b>a</b> <b>window</b> <b>into</b> Indonesian culture in the 1930s.|$|E
25|$|Barnes {{immersed}} {{herself in}} risky situations {{in order to}} access experiences that a previous generation of homebound women had been denied. Writing about the traditionally masculine domain of boxing from the ringside, Barnes explored boxing as <b>a</b> <b>window</b> <b>into</b> women's modern identities. In 1914, she first posed the question “What do women want at a fight?” in an article titled “My Sisters and I at a New York Prizefight” published in New York World magazine. According to Irene Gammel, “Barnes’ essay effectively begins to unravel an entire cultural history of repression for women”.|$|E
25|$|Pamuk's {{international}} reputation {{continued to}} increase when he published Benim Adım Kırmızı (My Name is Red) in 1998. The novel blends mystery, romance, and philosophical puzzles in a setting of 16th century Istanbul. It opens <b>a</b> <b>window</b> <b>into</b> the reign of Ottoman Sultan Murat III in nine snowy winter days of 1591, inviting the reader to experience the tension between East and West from a breathlessly urgent perspective. My Name Is Red has been translated into 24 languages and in 2003 won the International Dublin Literary Award, the world's most lucrative literary prize.|$|E

25|$|The Founding of Lesbos: twentyone hexameters were {{quoted by}} Parthenius {{under the title}} Lesbou ktisis. The author's name was not given but modern {{scholars}} attribute the verses to Apollonius since it has some clear affinities with the Jason/Medea story. It deals with the Lesbian princess, Peisidice, who betrayed her countrymen and her parents by opening the city gates to the man she loved, Achilles. Her reward was not the marriage she had anticipated but rather death by stoning {{at the hands of}} the Argives. It can be argued that Peisidice's viewpoint dominates the poem and that, as with Argonautica, epic material has been used unconventionally as <b>a</b> <b>window</b> <b>into</b> the female psyche.|$|E
25|$|Gautier {{began writing}} poetry {{as early as}} 1826, but the {{majority}} of his life was spent as a contributor to various journals, mainly La Presse, which also gave him the opportunity for foreign travel and for meeting many influential contacts in high society and {{in the world of the}} arts. Throughout his life, Gautier was well-traveled, taking trips to Spain, Italy, Russia, Egypt and Algeria. Gautier's many travels inspired many of his writings including Voyage en Espagne (1843), Trésors d’Art de la Russie (1858), and Voyage en Russie (1867). Gautier's travel literature is considered by many as being some of the best from the nineteenth century; often written in a personal style, it provides <b>a</b> <b>window</b> <b>into</b> Gautier's own tastes in art and culture.|$|E
25|$|In the past, social {{networking}} services {{were viewed as}} a distraction and offered no educational benefit. Blocking these social networks {{was a form of}} protection for students against wasting time, bullying, and invasions of privacy. In an educational setting, Facebook, for example, is seen by many instructors and educators as a frivolous, time-wasting distraction from schoolwork, and {{it is not uncommon to}} be banned in junior high or high school computer labs. Cyberbullying has become an issue of concern with {{social networking}} services. According to the UK Children Go Online survey of 9- to 19-year-olds, it was found that a third have received bullying comments online. To avoid this problem, many school districts/boards have blocked access to social networking services such as Facebook, MySpace, and Twitter within the school environment. Social networking services often include a lot of personal information posted publicly, and many believe that sharing personal information is <b>a</b> <b>window</b> <b>into</b> privacy theft. Schools have taken action to protect students from this. It is believed that this outpouring of identifiable information and the easy communication vehicle that social networking services opens the door to sexual predators, cyberbullying, and cyberstalking. In contrast, however, 70% of social media using teens and 85% of adults believe that people are mostly kind to one another on social network sites.|$|E

500|$|Behind the Mother-of-Pearl Throne is the Phra Banchon Busabok Mala Throne (พระบัญชรบุษบกมาลา; [...] ). This half throne {{protrudes}} {{from the southern}} wall of the throne hall and opens like <b>a</b> <b>window</b> <b>into</b> the hall. The style of the throne is similar to Busabok Mala Throne on the porch outside. The throne was built {{during the reign of}} King Rama IV, in order for the palace women to attend important ceremonies through the window but behind a screen, separating them from men arriving from the outside.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the clips}} {{shown in the}} episode comes from the season four episode [...] "Marge Gets a Job", in which Smithers has a dream that he is {{sleeping}} and Mr. Burns flies through <b>a</b> <b>window</b> <b>into</b> his room. The sequence shows Burns flying towards a happy-looking Smithers. The original clip {{went on for a}} few seconds longer, but had to be trimmed down in order to remove portions that showed [...] "Mr. Burns land in a particular position on Smithers' anatomy". There were also issues with [...] "the lump in his bed", which the animators said they had drawn as his knee, but the censors had mistakenly believed was an erection.|$|E
500|$|The small Philadelphia {{panel is}} painted with oil on {{parchment}} (vellum); a reconstructed red vermilion border surrounds the image– it {{is similar to}} those seen in contemporary illuminated manuscripts. [...] It gives the illusion of the viewer looking through <b>a</b> <b>window</b> <b>into</b> the landscape. The parchment measures the image measures [...] Underneath are five wood supports; the parchment is glued to one, and four smaller pieces, added at a later date, frame the image. The parchment is unusually thick and has a thin insoluble layer of primer. The wooden frames were primed in {{a thick layer of}} white, which overlaps the parchment in places. The borders were gilded at some time; technical analysis found particles of gold leaf on the lower border. The Turin panel is painted on two oak panels joined with a band of parchment or cloth, on a ground of chalk and animal glue.|$|E

500|$|As Houses creator David Shore says, {{being the}} [...] "true love that got away", Stacy is a [...] "quick" [...] and [...] "witty" [...] {{character}}, who is [...] "the one character {{who is able}} to spar with House on a level playing field." [...] Portrayer Sela Ward has described her character as <b>a</b> <b>window</b> <b>into</b> House's vulnerability and his heart. House simply describes Stacy as [...] "very convincing", as Mark thinks {{there is nothing wrong with}} him, but House says that if Stacy says that Mark is ill, he is ill. Many critics noted that Stacy's presence affected House's behaviour, Diane Kristine of Blog Critics stated that, with Stacy, House was [...] "almost nice". While Stacy has told House on several occasions that she loves Mark, she is still very much in love with House and was willing to have an affair with him; however, she admits that she finds House selfish and that [...] "with Mark, there's room for [...] ".|$|E
500|$|As {{the seasons}} progressed, and the {{character}} began to grow darker and more sinister, Rosenbaum sought more opportunities to bring humor to the scene, either with physical subtleties like little smiles at key moments, or [...] "self-deprecating humor". One such instance, which became popular with audiences, was in the season six episode [...] "Justice", where Lex made a joke about wanting a ponytail. The producers were concerned over the piece of dialogue, but Rosenbaum convinced them that he could pull it off. To Rosenbaum, this quip by Lex makes him more credible as a person, because {{it is well known}} that Lex always wanted hair. This moment reflects an earlier episode, where Lex reveals his feelings of meagerness when comparing himself to Clark. In season five's [...] "Lockdown", Lex provides <b>a</b> <b>window</b> <b>into</b> his thoughts about his place in Smallville. As writer Steven S. DeKnight describes it, the audience gets to see a moment where Lex shows how he still feels like an outsider, and that he views Clark as this [...] "perfect person". DeKnight believes that, from how Clark sees it, Lex is driven by his desire to attain everything that Clark has, like his family and girlfriend.|$|E
500|$|Specifically, Paul H. Kocher {{argues that}} Tolkien {{describes}} {{evil in the}} orthodox Christian way as the absence of good. He cites many examples in The Lord of the Rings, such as Sauron's [...] "Lidless Eye": [...] "the black slit of its pupil opened on a pit, <b>a</b> <b>window</b> <b>into</b> nothing". Kocher sees Tolkien's source as Thomas Aquinas, [...] "whom {{it is reasonable to}} suppose that Tolkien, as a medievalist and a Catholic, knows well". Tom Shippey makes the same point, but, instead of referring to Aquinas, says Tolkien was very familiar with Alfred the Great's Anglo-Saxon translation of Boethius' Consolation of Philosophy, known as the Lays of Boethius. Shippey contends that this Christian view of evil is most clearly stated by Boethius: [...] "evil is nothing". He says Tolkien used the corollary that evil cannot create as the basis of Frodo's remark, [...] "the Shadow ... can only mock, it cannot make: not real new things of its own", and related remarks by Treebeard and Elrond. He goes on to argue that in The Lord of the Rings evil does sometimes seem to be an independent force, more than merely the absence of good (though not independent to the point of the Manichaean heresy), and suggests that Alfred's additions to his translation of Boethius may have inspired that view.|$|E
