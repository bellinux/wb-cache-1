40|$|CNAS 1 (Collaborative Network for Atmospheric Sensing) is an agent-based, {{power-aware}} {{sensor network}} for ground-level atmospheric monitoring. In many multi-agent applications, reducing message transmission {{is a primary}} objective. In CNAS, however, it’s not the cost of sending messages, but when messages can be sent that is the driving communication constraint. CNAS agents must have their radios turned off most of the time, as even listening consumes significant power. Working in such collaborative isolation changes the character of agent interaction, as agents must have their radios turned on when others are sending messages to them. CNAS requires agent policies that can intelligently meet operational requirements while communicating only during intermittent, mutually established, communication windows. In this paper, we describe the CNAS agents and their hardware and blackboard-system software architectures. We also relate experiences and lessons learned from a field deployment of CNAS at the 2006 PATRIOT Exercise held last July at Fort McCoy, Wisconsin, and we discuss the upcoming CNAS deployment {{in conjunction with the}} Talisman Saber Combined Exercise to be conducted May–July 2007 in Australia. We conclude with an overview of current CNAS research that is exploring the addition of a rollable solar panel to each sensor agent that allows its battery reserves to grow (up to full capacity) when sunlight is available. Replenishable power reserves can support unlimited operational lifetimes, but activity decisions become more complex as each agent now must consider how much additional power may become available and when. 1.

5000|$|The Local Area Augmentation System (LAAS) is an <b>all-weather</b> {{aircraft}} <b>landing</b> {{system based}} on real-time differential correction of the GPS signal.

40|$|An {{investigation}} of approach and <b>landing</b> <b>longitudinal</b> flying qualities, {{based on data}} generated using a variable stability NT- 33 aircraft combined with significant control system dynamics is described. An optimum pilot lead time for pitch tracking, flight path angle tracking, and combined pitch and flight path angle tracking tasks is determined from a closed loop simulation using integral squared error (ISE) as a performance measure. Pilot gain and lead time were varied in the closed loop simulation of the pilot and aircraft to obtain the best performance for different control system configurations. The results lead to the selection of an optimum lead time using ISE as a performance criterion. Using this value of optimum lead time, a correlation is then found between pilot rating and performance with changes in the control system and in the aircraft dynamics. It is also shown that pilot rating {{is closely related to}} pilot workload which, in turn, is related to the amount of lead which the pilot must generate to obtain satisfactory response. The results also indicate that the pilot may use pitch angle tracking for the approach task and then add flight path angle tracking for the flare and touchdown...|$|R

40|$|A fixed-based {{simulation}} {{experiment was}} conducted in NASA Langley Research Center s Integration Flight Deck simulator to investigate enabling technologies for equivalent visual operations (EVO) in the emerging Next Generation Air Transportation System operating environment. EVO implies the capability to achieve or even improve on the safety of current-day Visual Flight Rules (VFR) operations, maintain the operational tempos of VFR, and perhaps even retain VFR procedures - all independent of the actual weather and visibility conditions. Twenty-four air transport-rated pilots evaluated the use of Synthetic/Enhanced Vision Systems (S/EVS) and eXternal Vision Systems (XVS) technologies as enabling technologies for future all-weather operations. The experimental objectives were to determine the feasibility of XVS/SVS/EVS to provide for all weather (visibility) landing capability without the need (or ability) for a visual approach segment and to determine the interaction of XVS/EVS and peripheral vision cues for terminal area and surface operations. Another key element of the testing investigated the pilot's awareness and reaction to non-normal events (i. e., failure conditions) that were unexpectedly introduced into the experiment. These non-normal runs served as critical determinants in the underlying safety of all-weather operations. Experimental data from this test are cast into performance-based approach and landing standards which might establish a basis for future <b>all-weather</b> <b>landing</b> operations. Glideslope tracking performance appears to have improved with {{the elimination of the}} approach visual segment. This improvement can most likely be attributed {{to the fact that the}} pilots didn't have to simultaneously perform glideslope corrections and find required visual landing references in order to continue a landing. Lateral tracking performance was excellent regardless of the display concept being evaluated or whether or not there were peripheral cues in the side window. Although workload ratings were significantly less when peripheral cues were present compared to when there were none, these differences appear to be operationally inconsequential. Larger display concepts tested in this experiment showed significant situation awareness (SA) improvements and workload reductions compared to smaller display concepts.

40|$|A nested PID {{steering}} control for autonomous {{vehicles equipped with}} artificial vision systems is designed so that the driver can override the automatic lane-keeping action and obtain a complete control of the vehicle lateral dynamics without any switching strategy. The control input is the steering wheel angle: it is designed {{on the basis of}} the yaw rate, which is measured by a gyroscope, and the lateral offset, which is measured by the vision system as the distance between the road centerline and a virtual point at a fixed distance ahead from the vehicle. No lateral acceleration and no lateral speed measurements are required. A PI active front {{steering control}} {{on the basis of the}} yaw rate tracking error is designed to compensate for constant disturbances while improving vehicle steering dynamics and reducing the influence of parameter variations. The yaw rate reference is viewed as the control input in an external control loop: it is designed using a PID control based on the lateral offset measurements to reject the disturbances on the curvature during autonomous control, i. e., when the driver is not exerting any torque on the steering wheel. A third control block is designed to allow the driver to control the vehicle (for example, lane change for passing purposes or obstacle avoidance) overriding the automatic lane-keeping action while maintaining the advantages of the yaw rate feedback.

40|$|The rapid {{increase}} in aviation industry requires parallel effective plans, programs and designs of systems and facilities nationwide to fulfill the increasing needs for safe air transportation. Aircraft landing remains a problem {{for a long time}} all over the world. Systems that aircraft rely on in landing are unreliable to perform a precise guidance due to many limitations such as inaccuracy, unreliability and dependency. In low visibility conditions, when pilots are unable to see the runway, the aircrafts are diverted to another airport. However, low visibility can also affect all airports in the vicinity, forcing aircrafts to land in low visibility conditions depending on Instrument Flight Rules (IFR). Aircraft approach and landing are the most hazardous portions of flight; accidents records indicate that approximately 50 percent of the accidents occur during aircraft landing. Aircraft landing Category III C is not yet in operation anywhere in the world. It requires landing with no visibility or runway visual range. Currently, Global Positioning System (GPS) is the main navigation system used all over the world for aircraft navigation, approach and landing. However, in aircraft approach and landing phase, the accuracy of GPS is not sufficient to perform a perfect landing due to the possibility of aircraft to be drifted out of the runway. The accuracy of GPS could be improved to 3 meter by sending correction. Improved accuracy {{has not been able to}} meet ICAO standards for aircraft automatic landing.
