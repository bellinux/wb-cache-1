The concert {{was held at}} Ståplatstorget, the large area behind the Northern Stand terraces. The concert was {{attended}} by 3,000, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>some</b> concerns regarding the suitability of the venue after the concrete floor started rocking. However, safety checks the next day showed that the structure had not been damaged, and was suitable to host similar events in the future. On November 1, 2016, the stadium hosted a public mass led by Pope Francis {{as part of his}} two-day visit to Scania.|$|E
5|$|The exact {{reason for}} the {{rebellion}} is unclear, but it was launched at the wedding of Ralph to a relative of Roger, held at Exning in Suffolk. Another earl, Waltheof, although one of William's favourites, was also involved, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>some</b> Breton lords who were ready to rebel in support of Ralph and Roger. Ralph also requested Danish aid. William remained in Normandy while his men in England subdued the revolt. Roger was unable to leave his stronghold in Herefordshire because of efforts by Wulfstan, the Bishop of Worcester, and Æthelwig, the Abbot of Evesham. Ralph was bottled up in Norwich Castle by the combined efforts of Odo of Bayeux, Geoffrey de Montbray, Richard fitzGilbert, and William de Warenne. Ralph eventually left Norwich in the control {{of his wife and}} left England, finally ending up in Brittany. Norwich was besieged and surrendered, with the garrison allowed to go to Brittany. Meanwhile, the Danish king's brother, Cnut, had finally arrived in England with a fleet of 200 ships, but he was too late as Norwich had already surrendered. The Danes then raided along the coast before returning home. William returned to England later in 1075 to deal with the Danish threat, leaving his wife Matilda in charge of Normandy. He celebrated Christmas at Winchester and dealt with the aftermath of the rebellion. Roger and Waltheof were kept in prison, where Waltheof was executed in May 1076. Before this, William had returned to the continent, where Ralph had continued the rebellion from Brittany.|$|E

25|$|Buddhist scholar Xuanzang {{passed through}} Kashgar (which he {{referred}} to as Ka-sha) in 644 on his return journey from India to China. The Buddhist religion, then beginning to decay in India, was active in Kashgar. Xuanzang recorded that they flattened their babies heads, tattooed their bodies and had green eyes. He reported that Kashgar had abundant crops, fruits and flowers, wove fine woolen stuffs and rugs. Their writing system had been adapted from Indian script but their language was {{different from that of}} other countries. The inhabitants were sincere Buddhist adherents <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>some</b> hundreds of monasteries with more than 10,000 followers, all members of the Sarvastivadin School.|$|E
25|$|Simpson, who has {{consistently}} professed his innocence in the Brown and Goldman killings, {{was acquitted of}} the murder charges almost a month after Nigg's death. Alternative theories of the murders, supposedly shared by Simpson, have suggested they were related to drug trafficking in the Los Angeles area, and that Nigg's was as well; Nigg apparently lived very well for a waiter, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>some</b> allegations he, too, {{had been involved in}} the drug trade while working at the Mezzaluna branch in Colorado before. Nigg and Goldman, it has also been noted, were not the only waiters at Mezzaluna to be the victims of criminal activity during the mid-1990s.|$|E

25|$|Followers of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad {{believe that}} this prophecy was {{fulfilled}} on Saturday 6 March 1897 which {{happened to be a}} day after the festival of Eid, when Pandit Lekh Ram was brutally stabbed with a dagger by a stranger who it is said turned the knife round and round in his stomach thus cutting his entrails thoroughly. Lekh Ram died the next day. It is said that although his family was at home, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>some</b> men downstairs, near the gate {{at the time of the}} murder, no one saw any person entering or leaving the house. His body was subsequently cremated in accordance with Hindu custom and the remains dispersed of in a river. There was a police investigation but it failed to apprehend the murderer.|$|E
25|$|Below Earith, {{thirteen}} Adventurers {{working with}} the Earl of Bedford formed a Corporation to drain the Bedford Levels. Cornelius Vermuyden was the engineer, and {{a major part of}} the scheme was the Old Bedford River, a straight cut to carry water from Earith to a new sluice near Salters Lode, which was completed in 1637. The sluice was not popular with those who used the river for navigation, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>some</b> attempts to destroy the new works during the turmoil of the civil war. A second drainage Act was obtained in 1649, and Vermuyden oversaw the construction of the New Bedford River, parallel to the Old Bedford River, which was completed in 1652. There was strong opposition from the ports and towns on the river, which increased as the old channel via Ely gradually silted up. Above Earith, Samuel Jemmatt took control of the river, and navigation was extended to Bedford in 1689 by the construction of new staunches and sluices.|$|E
25|$|Glamorgan {{never had}} a settled team {{and there were a}} number of new arrivals at the end of the season {{including}} Gilbert Parkhouse, Jim Eaglestone, Norman Hever and Phil Clift. This might suggest a club in transition but there were grounds for optimism which were realised in 1948 when the club won its first championship. Glamorgan's bowling in 1947 suffered an early blow when their only real pace bowler Peter Judge was ruled out for the season after being injured in only the second match. Dynamic captain Wilf Wooller had to carry the seam attack almost single-handedly and took 85 wickets in addition to scoring 1,270 runs. Glamorgan relied mostly on spin with Len Muncer and the veteran Johnnie Clay bowling off breaks and opening batsman Emrys Davies helping out with his slow left. Davies created a county record by scoring five centuries in the season and formed an effective opening partnership with Arnold Dyson, both of them scoring more than 1,500 runs in the championship. Future Test player Allan Watkins exceeded 1,000 runs <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>some</b> good innings by Wat Jones and George Lavis. The main wicketkeeper was Haydn Davies who claimed 47 victims in the championship but had some problems with a damaged hand. Other players included veteran Austin Matthews in his final season, Jim Pleass, Arthur Porter and Maurice Robinson.|$|E

500|$|This {{week was}} {{homecoming}} for the Sooners, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>some</b> special celebrations planned. [...] All season, Oklahoma had been remembering and recognizing {{the career of}} the late Prentice Gautt, the first African-American football player at the university. Gautt's jersey number (38) was not issued this season to any players and for the game against Colorado the 38yard-line on both halves of the field was highlighted with crimson. This year also marked the 50th anniversary of the 1956 National Championship won by the Sooners. At least 34 members of that team were expected to attend the game, including former All-Americans Bill Krisher, Tommy McDonald, and Clendon Thomas.|$|E

500|$|The 1777 Siege of Fort Ticonderoga {{occurred}} between 2 and 6 July 1777 at Fort Ticonderoga, near {{the southern end}} of Lake Champlain in the state of New York. [...] Lieutenant General John Burgoyne's 8,000-man army occupied high ground above the fort, and nearly surrounded the defences. [...] These movements precipitated the occupying Continental Army, an under-strength force of 3,000 under the command of General Arthur St. Clair, to withdraw from Ticonderoga and the surrounding defences. Some gunfire was exchanged, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>some</b> casualties, but there was no formal siege and no pitched battle. [...] Burgoyne's army occupied Fort Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, the extensive fortifications on the Vermont side of the lake, without opposition on 6 July. Advance units pursued the retreating Americans.|$|E
500|$|Lincoln {{stayed in}} business; from mid-1987 to April 1989, its assets grew from $3.91 billion to $5.46 billion. Following Keating's past {{practices}} with Lindner, American Continental amassed a large collection of confusingly connected subsidiaries in real estate, banking, and insurance businesses; these numbered at least 54, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>some</b> overseas ones that auditors {{were not aware}} of. Keating was triumphant in having defeated the regulators, whom he despised as useless relics from an outmoded financial past, and defended his high salary and business practices. He spent about $500,000 on radio advertisements in the Phoenix area to improve his public image; the commercials stressed his real estate projects and his family-oriented values. A 1988 Los Angeles Times profile assessed Keating as [...] "a businessman without apparent peer in Arizona in terms of riches, clout and color." [...] While Keating had taken Citizens for Decency through Law with him, he had generally de-emphasized his anti-pornography work {{when he moved to}} Arizona. Nevertheless, X-rated movies and Playboy magazine were banned from his hotels.|$|E
500|$|Stone {{met with}} Tom Cruise about playing Bud Fox, but the {{director}} had already committed to Charlie Sheen for the role. Stone liked the [...] "stiffness" [...] of Sheen's acting style {{and used it}} to convey Bud's naivete. Michael Douglas had just come off heroic roles like the one in Romancing the Stone and was looking for something dark and edgy. The studio wanted Warren Beatty to play Gekko, but he was not interested. Stone initially wanted Richard Gere but the actor passed, so Stone went with Douglas despite having been advised by others in Hollywood not to cast him. Stone remembers, [...] "I was warned by everyone in Hollywood that Michael couldn't act, that he was a producer more than an actor and would spend all his time in his trailer on the phone". Nevertheless, Stone found out that [...] "when he's acting he gives it his all". Stone said that he saw [...] "that villain quality" [...] in Douglas and always thought he was a smart businessman. Douglas remembers that when he first read the screenplay, [...] "I {{thought it was a great}} part. It was a long script, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>some</b> incredibly long and intense monologues to open with. I’d never seen a screenplay where there were two or three pages of single-spaced type for a monologue. I thought, whoa! I mean, it was unbelievable". For research, he read profiles of corporate raiders T. Boone Pickens and Carl Icahn.|$|E
