In their statement to the press, they stressed the unimportance of the band's problems in the context of the Live8 event.|$|E

25|$|Visual {{extinction}} {{has also}} been researched {{with regard to the}} effect of repetition on visual detection rate. Patients were shown a colored (red or green) letter (O or E), one to each visual field, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>asked</b> variably to report the color or shape of one letter or the other. Extinction was found to be increased in the contralesional field when the patient was asked to report on a repeated characteristic – if both stimuli had been the same shape, or same color – regardless of whether the other characteristic had also been changed. This is another example of repetition blindness.|$|E
