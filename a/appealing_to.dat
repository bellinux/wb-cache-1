5|$|In March 1919, Princess Matoika and Rijndam raced {{each other}} from Saint-Nazaire to Newport News in a {{friendly}} competition that received national press coverage in the United States.

After visiting Pete Harman's {{operations in}} Utah, {{they began to}} implement the stand-alone take-out model across the entire chain. Franchisees were ordered to delist their own menu items {{so that they could}} concentrate on KFC products. The restaurants were re-branded with a distinctive red-and-white striped color pattern and mansard roofs with cupolas. The roll-out of freestanding stores accelerated the company's growth as outlets exclusively selling fried chicken proved to be more <b>appealing</b> <b>to</b> potential franchisees.|$|E
5|$|SCE Cambridge {{wanted the}} game to possess a unique lead character, thus Sorrell worked with script doctor Martin Pond whilst {{creating}} an expansive backstory for the lead protagonist, Sir Daniel Fortesque.

This idea, along with the player-character's unusual appearance, turned <b>appealing</b> <b>to</b> some sectors of the gaming community, as lead designer Wilson later recalled that female gamers considered Sir Daniel to be endearing, and was considered a sex symbol in France.|$|E
