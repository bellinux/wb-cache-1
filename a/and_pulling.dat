40|$|Recent years’ {{terrorist}} attacks in Europe and the flow of foreign fighters joining the terrorist organisation Daesh, has made the understanding of radicalisation evermore crucial. This thesis investigates if push <b>and</b> <b>pull</b> factors leading into violent Islamic extremism differentiate between men and women. Furthermore, it assesses how preventive measures from The United Kingdom, Sweden and Denmark targets push <b>and</b> <b>pull</b> factors <b>and</b> if these are sensitive to sex. To fulfil this objective an exploratory thematic {{analysis was used to}} synthesise secondary qualitative research surrounding push <b>and</b> <b>pull</b> factors. The push <b>and</b> <b>pull</b> factor analysis revealed three trends: there were limited variation in the overall categories describing the push <b>and</b> <b>pull</b> factors present for men and women; what caused push <b>and</b> <b>pull</b> factors to manifest differed according to sex; and, there were differences in how much men and women were affected by these factors. The assessment of prevention measures showed that none of the measures explicitly mentioned push <b>and</b> <b>pull</b> factors, yet they all had the potential of targeting these. Sex was included in some aspects of the measures, but was not a consideration in relation to the targeting of push <b>and</b> <b>pull</b> factors. The thesis ends with a discussion of what implications the found results have for practice and offers suggestions to how prevention measures can be improved...|$|R

40|$|Tourism {{motivation}} {{in developing countries}} and Islamic culture has received scant attention from researchers. The key to understanding tourism motivation is to see holiday travel as a satisfier of needs and wants. Literature on tourism often conceptualizes tourist motives in terms of push <b>and</b> <b>pull</b> forces. The idea behind this concept is that people travel because they are pushed by their own internal forces <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> by external forces of the destination attributes. One way to realize travel motivation {{is to examine the}} notion of push <b>and</b> <b>pull</b> demand stimulation. The objectives of this research were to understand both push <b>and</b> <b>pull</b> motivation for domestic tourism and {{the relationship between the two}} motivations for Saudi tourists. The finding indicated nine push factors (cultural value, utilitarian, knowledge, social, economical, family togetherness, interest, relaxation, and convenience of facilities) <b>and</b> nine <b>pull</b> factors (safety, activity, beach sports/activities, nature/outdoor, historical/cultural, religious, budget, leisure, and upscale). This study found that the most important push <b>and</b> <b>pull</b> factors as perceived by Saudi tourists are ``cultural value'' and ``religious.

5|$|Nemerteans {{generally}} move slowly, {{though they}} have occasionally been documented to successfully prey on spiders or insects. Most nemerteans use their external cilia to glide on surfaces on a trail of slime, some of which is produced by glands in the head. Larger species use muscular waves to crawl, and some aquatic species swim by dorso-ventral undulations. Some species burrow by means of muscular peristalsis, and have powerful muscles. Some species of the suborder Monostilifera, whose proboscis have one active stylet, move by extending the proboscis, sticking it to an object <b>and</b> <b>pulling</b> the animal towards the object.|$|E
5|$|The P90 uses an {{internal}} hammer striking mechanism and a trigger mechanism with a three-position rotary dial fire control selector, {{located at the}} foot of the trigger. The dial has three settings: S– safe, 1– semi-automatic fire, and A– fully automatic fire. When set on A, the P90's fire selector provides a two-stage trigger operation similar to that of the Steyr AUG assault rifle—pulling the trigger back slightly produces semi-automatic fire, <b>and</b> <b>pulling</b> the trigger fully to the rear produces fully automatic fire.|$|E

Bode led III./StG 77 to attack from the northwest, dead into wind in order to bomb accurately. Usually the Ju 87s attacked in line astern, but Bode chose to attack in groups of three to split the anti-aircraft fire. To keep the enemy's heads down, he fired his machine guns in an 80-degree dive. He soon left an altitude of 13,000feet, releasing his bombs <b>and</b> <b>pulling</b> out at 2,275feet.

5|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 1850s, {{with the arrival of}} the Second French Empire, the Anglo-Norman became a popular breed in France, {{competing}} with the Thoroughbred. It was reputed to be a versatile horse, appropriate for riding <b>and</b> <b>pulling</b> light carriages. From 1840 to 1860, the breed was further influenced by part-Thoroughbred trotting horses from England. Local Norman mares were crossed with imported Thoroughbreds, Norfolk Trotters, Orlov Trotters and other crossbred horses, which themselves had Norfolk and Mecklenburger blood. By 1855, the quality of the resulting animals had ensured the breed's success, and the Anglo-Norman spread throughout France, especially supplanting another type of riding horse from the south, the Limousin horse. In 1864, the Société du cheval français de demi-sang (Society of French Half-Blood Horses) was founded, which later became the Société d'encouragement à l'élevage du cheval français (Society to Encourage French Horse Breeding). The breeders spread the description of Norman horses, particularly Anglo-Normans, as versatile horses that could be used for both riding and driving.|$|E

40|$|This {{exploratory}} study aims at closing an inherent {{gap in the}} literature on research on private parks. Specifically, the aim of this study is threefold: (a) to identify the push <b>and</b> <b>pull</b> factors that influence decisions to visit private parks; (b) to examine the differences in these push <b>and</b> <b>pull</b> factors for different sociodemographic groups; and (c) to investigate the interrelationships among these push <b>and</b> <b>pull</b> fac-tors. Data were collected from 228 visitors who were intercepted at various locations in a private park. The survey instrument assessed the reasons for visiting the park (push factors) and evaluated how well the park performed on a series of selected park attributes (pull factors). The results of a factor analysis revealed three push factors <b>and</b> three <b>pull</b> factors. Other analyses included an evaluation of the inter-relationship between these factors in terms of different sociodemographic subgroups and a general correlation analysis on the interrelationship among push <b>and</b> <b>pull</b> factors. This study provides useful managerial and practical implications for park managers, policymakers and communication strategists to gain an understanding of how push <b>and</b> <b>pull</b> factors affect tourists and their choice of private parks...|$|R

After Catherine's daughter Elisabeth died in childbirth in 1568, she had touted her youngest daughter Margaret as a bride for Philip II of Spain.
