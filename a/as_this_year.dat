[...] He described the Oxford crew as [...] "exceptionally strong and mechanically quite efficient" [...] yet [...] "lacks polish and uniformity" [...] and while Cambridge were demonstrated uniformity, they rowed {{in a way which}} [...] "does look like hard work". [...] In the build-up to the race, Oxford's time in their second full course row was 45 seconds quicker than that rowed by Cambridge the previous day.|$|E

Condition made Kirk a star. [...] He lacked condition in 1921. [...] At that time he was just [...] as able, otherwise <b>as</b> <b>this</b> <b>year.</b> [...] But nobody mentioned him and he did nothing much to help his team. [...] Kirk realized why he failed in 1921 and immediately began preparing for the season of 1922. [...] Careful diet, regular hours and well-planned exercise brought him into remarkable condition. [...] Kirk was fit when the training season started. [...] Kirk played every minute of every game he started this year. [...] He never had time taken out. [...] He was really a physical marvel, considering how hard he played." ...|$|E

You will hear enough of it to-morrow, sir. We have just been trying, by way of doing something, and amusing my mother, just within the last week, to get up a few scenes, a mere trifle. We have had such incessant rains almost since October began, {{that we have been}} nearly confined to the house for days together. I have hardly taken out a gun since the 3rd. Tolerable sport the first three days, but there has been no attempting anything since. The first day I went over Mansfield Wood, and Edmund took the copses beyond Easton, and we brought home six brace between us, and might each have killed six times as many, but we respect your pheasants, sir, I assure you, as much as you could desire. I do not think you will find your woods by any means worse stocked than they were. I never saw Mansfield Wood so full of pheasants in my life <b>as</b> <b>this</b> <b>year.</b> I hope you will take a day's sport there yourself, sir, soon." ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{must always}} be remembered that this war is a {{mechanical}} war conducted by men whose discipline renders them uninventive, who know little or nothing of mechanism, who {{are for the most}} part struggling blindly to get things back to the conditions for which they were trained, to Napoleonic conditions, with infantry and cavalry and comparatively light guns, the so-called [...] "war of manoeuvres." [...] It is like a man engaged in a desperate duel who keeps on trying to make it a game of cricket. Most of these soldiers detest every sort of mechanical device; the tanks, for example, which, used with imagination, might have given the British and French overwhelming victory on the western front, were subordinated to the usual cavalry [...] "break through" [...] idea. I am not making any particular complaint against the British and French generals in saying this. It is what must happen to any country which entrusts its welfare to soldiers. A soldier has to be a severely disciplined man, and a severely disciplined man cannot be a versatile man, and on the whole the British army has been as receptive to novelties as any. The German generals have done no better; indeed, they have not done so well as the generals of the Allies in this respect. But after the war, if the world does not organize rapidly for peace, then as resources accumulate a little, the mechanical genius will get to work on the possibilities of these ideas that have merely been sketched out in this war. We shall get big land ironclads which will smash towns. We shall get air offensives--let the experienced London reader think of an air raid going on hour after hour, day after day--that will really burn out and wreck towns, that will drive people mad by the thousand. We shall get a very complete cessation of sea transit. Even land transit may be enormously hampered by aerial attack. I doubt if any sort of social order will really be able to stand the strain of a fully worked out modern war. We have still, of course, to feel the full shock effects even of this war. Most of the combatants are going on, as sometimes men who have incurred grave wounds will still go on for a time--without feeling them. The educational, biological, social, economic punishment that has already been taken by each of the European countries is, I feel, very much greater than we yet realize. Russia, the heaviest and worst-trained combatant, has indeed shown the effects and is down and sick, but in three years' time all Europe will know far better than it does now the full price of this war. And the shock effects of the next war will have much the same relation to the shock effects of this, as the shock of breaking a finger-nail has to the shock of crushing in a body. In Russia to-day we have seen, not indeed social revolution, not the replacement of one social order by another, but disintegration. Let not national conceit blind us. Germany, France, Italy, Britain are all slipping about on that same slope down which Russia has slid. Which goes first, it is hard to guess, or whether we shall all hold out to some kind of Peace. At present the social discipline of France and Britain seems to be at least as good as that of Germany, and the morale of the Rhineland and Bavaria has probably to undergo very severe testing by systematized and steadily increasing air punishment <b>as</b> <b>this</b> <b>year</b> goes on. The next war--if a next war comes--will see all Germany, from end to end, vulnerable to aircraft....|$|E
