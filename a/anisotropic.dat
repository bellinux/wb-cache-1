5|$|An extended, {{structurally}} rigid, highly <b>anisotropic</b> shape {{seems to}} be the main criterion for liquid crystalline behavior, and as a result many liquid crystalline materials are based on benzene rings.|$|E
5|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} {{have very}} large aspect ratio, i.e., their length {{is much larger}} than their diameter. Consequently, as expected from the classical electromagnetic theory, elastic light scattering (or Rayleigh scattering) by straight CNTs has <b>anisotropic</b> angular dependence, and from its spectrum, the band gaps of individual nanotubes can be deduced.|$|E
5|$|Phenomena {{associated}} with eclipses include shadow bands (also known as flying shadows), which {{are similar to}} shadows {{on the bottom of}} a swimming pool. They only occur just prior to and after totality, when a narrow solar crescent acts as an <b>anisotropic</b> light source.|$|E
5|$|The objects {{created by}} amphiphiles are usually spherical (as {{in the case}} of micelles), but may also be disc-like (bicelles), rod-like, or biaxial (all three micelle axes are distinct). These <b>anisotropic</b> self-assembled nano-structures can then order {{themselves}} {{in much the same way}} as thermotropic liquid crystals do, forming large-scale versions of all the thermotropic phases (such as a nematic phase of rod-shaped micelles).|$|E
5|$|The {{physical}} properties of gallium are highly <b>anisotropic,</b> i.e. have different values along {{the three major}} crystallographical axes a, b, and c (see table), producing {{a significant difference between}} the linear (α) and volume thermal expansion coefficients. The properties of gallium are strongly temperature-dependent, particularly near the melting point. For example, the coefficient of thermal expansion increases by several hundred percent upon melting.|$|E
5|$|The {{theoretical}} {{thermal conductivity}} of hexagonal Boron nitride nanoribbons (BNNRs) can approach 1700–2000 W/(m·K), {{which has the}} same order of magnitude as the experimental measured value for graphene, and can be comparable to the theoretical calculations for graphene nanoribbons. Moreover, the thermal transport in the BNNRs is <b>anisotropic.</b> The thermal conductivity of zigzag-edged BNNRs is about 20% larger than that of armchair-edged nanoribbons at room temperature.|$|E
5|$|This {{statistical}} theory, {{proposed by}} Alfred Saupe and Wilhelm Maier, includes contributions from an attractive intermolecular potential from an induced dipole moment between adjacent liquid crystal molecules. The <b>anisotropic</b> attraction stabilizes parallel alignment of neighboring molecules, {{and the theory}} then considers a mean-field average of the interaction. Solved self-consistently, this theory predicts thermotropic nematic-isotropic phase transitions, consistent with experiment.|$|E
25|$|A torus {{is said to}} be <b>anisotropic</b> if its F-rank is zero.|$|E
25|$|Ellipsometry is {{especially}} superior to reflectivity measurements when studying <b>anisotropic</b> samples.|$|E
25|$|For <b>anisotropic</b> media,', {{indicates}} that the two shear waves have split.|$|E
25|$|Only {{bilinear}} texture filtering is supported; mipmapped {{textures and}} <b>anisotropic</b> filtering are not supported.|$|E
25|$|Important factors {{influencing}} chemical shift are electron density, electronegativity of neighboring groups and <b>anisotropic</b> induced magnetic field effects.|$|E
25|$|Birefringence is {{observed}} in <b>anisotropic</b> elastic materials. In these materials, the two polarizations split {{according to their}} effective refractive indices, which are also sensitive to stress.|$|E
25|$|Solving the Poisson {{equation}} {{based on}} an <b>anisotropic</b> permittivity has been incorporated into BioMOCA using the box integration discretization method, which has been briefly described below.|$|E
25|$|In {{isotropic}} aquifers or aquifer layers {{the hydraulic}} conductivity (K) is equal for flow in all directions, while in <b>anisotropic</b> conditions it differs, notably in horizontal (Kh) and vertical (Kv) sense.|$|E
25|$|Wood is a heterogeneous, hygroscopic, {{cellular}} and <b>anisotropic</b> material. It {{consists of}} cells, and the cell walls {{are composed of}} micro-fibrils of cellulose (40%– 50%) and hemicellulose (15%– 25%) impregnated with lignin (15%– 30%).|$|E
25|$|Semi-confined {{aquifers}} {{with one}} or more aquitards work as an <b>anisotropic</b> system, even when the separate layers are isotropic, because the compound Kh and Kv values are different (see hydraulic transmissivity and hydraulic resistance).|$|E
25|$|Not all {{crystals}} {{have all}} of these properties. Conversely, these properties are not quite exclusive to crystals. They can appear in glasses or polycrystals that have been made <b>anisotropic</b> by working or stress—for example, stress-induced birefringence.|$|E
25|$|Additional {{features}} {{to further enhance}} the graphics quality are also available. Dolphin supports spatial anti-aliasing, <b>anisotropic</b> filtering, post-processing pixel shaders, and a widescreen hack for forcing widescreen output on games that do not support it natively. Games can also achieve higher-than-intended frames per second.|$|E
25|$|While {{studies of}} single AGN show {{important}} {{deviations from the}} expectations of the unified model, results from statistical tests have been contradictory. The most important short-coming of statistical tests by direct comparisons of statistical samples of Seyfert 1s and Seyfert 2s is the introduction of selection biases due to <b>anisotropic</b> selection criteria.|$|E
25|$|In three dimensions, {{there are}} eight models of geometries. There are Euclidean, elliptic, and {{hyperbolic}} geometries, as in the two-dimensional case; mixed geometries that are partially Euclidean and partially hyperbolic or spherical; twisted versions of the mixed geometries; and one unusual geometry that is completely <b>anisotropic</b> (i.e. every direction behaves differently).|$|E
25|$|Snell's law is {{generally}} true only for isotropic or specular media (such as glass). In <b>anisotropic</b> media such as some crystals, birefringence may split the refracted ray into two rays, the ordinary or o-ray which follows Snell's law, {{and the other}} extraordinary or e-ray {{which may not be}} co-planar with the incident ray.|$|E
25|$|On {{a square}} lattice, symmetries {{guarantee}} that the coefficients Zi of the derivative terms are all equal. But even for an <b>anisotropic</b> Ising model, where the Zis in different directions are different, the fluctuations in H are isotropic in a coordinate system where the different directions of space are rescaled.|$|E
25|$|When {{reconstructing the}} data, {{owing to the}} {{evaporation}} of successive layers of material from the sample, the lateral and in-depth reconstruction values are highly <b>anisotropic.</b> Determination of the exact resolution of the instrument is of limited use, as {{the resolution of the}} device is set by the physical properties of the material under analysis.|$|E

25|$|Birefringence is {{the optical}} {{property}} of a material having a refractive index {{that depends on}} the polarization and propagation direction of light. These optically <b>anisotropic</b> materials are said to be birefringent (or birefractive). The birefringence is often quantified as the maximum difference between refractive indices exhibited by the material. Crystals with non-cubic crystal structures are often birefringent, as are plastics under mechanical stress.|$|E
25|$|Crystal physicists, in particular, are {{interested}} in <b>anisotropic</b> physical properties of crystals. The directional dependence of a crystal's physical property is described by a 3D tensor and depends on {{the orientation of the}} crystal. Tensor shapes are more palpable by adding lighting effects (reflection and shadow). 2D sections of interest are selected for display by rotating the tensor interactively around one or more axes.|$|E
25|$|Undercuts from etching are {{somewhat}} {{different than the}} undercuts explained above, {{because it is a}} side effect, not an intentional feature. Undercuts from etching can occur from two common causes. The first is over etching, which means the etchant was applied too long. The second is due to an isotropic etchant, which means the etchant etches in all directions equally. To overcome this problem an <b>anisotropic</b> etchant is used.|$|E
25|$|The {{acoustic}} {{and thermal}} properties of graphite are highly <b>anisotropic,</b> since phonons propagate quickly along the tightly-bound planes, but are slower {{to travel from}} one plane to another. Graphite's high thermal stability and electrical and thermal conductivity facilitate its widespread use as electrodes and refractories in high temperature material processing applications. However, in oxygen containing atmospheres graphite readily oxidizes to form CO2 at temperatures of 700°C and above.|$|E
25|$|In most fusion plasmas, {{bremsstrahlung}} {{radiation is}} a major energy loss channel. (See also bremsstrahlung losses in quasineutral, isotropic plasmas.) For the p–11B reaction, some calculations indicate that the bremsstrahlung power {{will be at least}} 1.74 times larger than the fusion power. The corresponding ratio for the 3He-3He reaction is only slightly more favorable at 1.39. This is not applicable to non-neutral plasmas, and different in <b>anisotropic</b> plasmas.|$|E

500|$|For {{simulating}} {{the behavior}} of crystals or other <b>anisotropic</b> materials, {{it is important to}} have variants of the curve-shortening flow for which the speed of flow depends on the orientation of a curve as well as on its curvature. One way of doing this is to define the energy of a curve to be the integral of a smooth function [...] of its normal vectors, and form the gradient flow of this energy, according to which the normal speed at which the curve flows is proportional to an <b>anisotropic</b> analog of the curvature. This flow can be simulated by discretizing the curve as a polygon. In numerical experiments, initial curves appear to converge to the Wulff shape for [...] before shrinking to a point. Alternatively, one can let the curve flow with speed [...] where [...] is the (usual) curvature and [...] and [...] are smooth functions of the orientation [...] When [...] and [...] (so that the flow is invariant under point reflection), the resulting flow can be shown to obey the avoidance principle and an analog of the Gage–Hamilton–Grayson theorem.|$|E

2500|$|An {{incident}} {{shear wave}} may enter an <b>anisotropic</b> medium from an isotropic media by encountering {{a change in}} the preferred orientation or character of the medium. [...] When a polarized shear wave enters a new, <b>anisotropic</b> medium, it splits into two shear waves (Fig.2).|$|E
2500|$|Another {{invariant}} {{associated to}} the split torus [...] is the <b>anisotropic</b> kernel: {{this is the}} semisimple algebraic group obtained as the derived subgroup of the centraliser of [...] in [...] (the latter is only a reductive group).
