40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Electrical and Computer EngineeringBalasubramaniam NatarajanAnil PahwaElectric {{vehicles}} (EVs) {{are becoming}} increasingly popular because of their low operating costs and environmentally friendly operation. However, the anticipated increase of EV usage and increased use of renewable energy sources and smart storage devices for EV charging presents opportunities as well as challenges. Time-varying electricity pricing and day-ahead power commitment adds another dimension to this problem. This thesis, describes development of coordinated EV charging strategies for renewable energy-powered charging stations at homes and parking lots. We develop an optimal control theory-based charging strategy that minimizes power drawn from the electricity grid while utilizing maximum energy from renewable energy sources. Specifically, we derive a centralized iterative control approach in which charging rates of EVs are optimized one at a time. We also propose an algorithm that maximizes profits for parking lot operators by advantageously utilizing time-varying electricity pricing while satisfying system constraints. We propose a linear programming-based strategy for EV charging, and we specifically derive a centralized linear program that minimizes charging costs for parking lot operators while satisfying customer demand in available time. Then we model EV charging behavior of <b>Active</b> <b>Consumers.</b> We develop a real-time pricing scheme that results in favorable load profile for electric utility by influencing EV charging behavior of <b>Active</b> <b>Consumers.</b> We develop this pricing scheme as a game between electric utility and <b>Active</b> <b>Consumers,</b> in which the electric utilities decide optimal electricity prices that minimize peak-to-average load ratio and <b>Active</b> <b>Consumers</b> decide optimal charging strategy that minimizes EV charging costs for <b>Active</b> <b>Consumers...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{assumption}} that people cannot {{react to the}} way distribution grid tariffs are designed does not hold anymore. This is mainly true due to breakthroughs in two game-changing technologies: photovoltaics (PV) and batteries. • By investing in PV and batteries, <b>active</b> <b>consumers</b> push the sunk costs towards passive consumers (equity issue). Ironically, the <b>active</b> <b>consumers</b> can even end up paying more (efficiency issue). To avoid being screwed by the others, <b>active</b> <b>consumers</b> could overinvest. They are in a non-cooperative equilibrium. • We find that {{the outcome of this}} game between the DSO (and the regulator) trying to recover sunk costs, and <b>active</b> <b>consumers</b> reacting to the distribution grid tariff, depends heavily on the way the tariff is designed. • It is clear that current distribution grid tariffs are not future-proof. The historical conventional practice in the EU is net-metering, which creates significant equity issues and is an implicit subsidy for the adoption of PV. The solution that is advocated in the current debate, capacity charges, creates significant efficiency issues and is an implicit subsidy for the adoption of batteries. • ‘Bi-directional’ volumetric charges can outperform capacity based charges to recover sunk costs, so they should at least be considered as an option...|$|R

The methods that allow to identify the potential of energy efficiency of DG sources and the potential of active behavior of the consumer are developed in this thesis.

The methodical basis for a comprehensive assessment of the effectiveness of the individual components of <b>active</b> <b>consumers</b> and local power systems as a whole are presented in this study. The new design of wind flow hubs of complex shapes that increase the efficiency of low-grade wind flow concentrators create conditions for attracting wind turbines in the built environment, which increases the energy potential of <b>active</b> <b>consumers</b> as part of integrated power systems. ? ??????????????? ?????? ?????? ??????-?????????? ?????? ????????? ??????????????????? ????????? ?????? ???????????????. ???? ??????????? ??????? ?????? ?????? ??????? ? ????????????????? ??????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????????? ????????? ? ???????? ???????????? ??????? ? ??????? ???????????????, ? ????? ?????????? ???????????? ?? ?????????????. ?????????? ???????? ??????????? ?????????? ????????? ????????? ????????????? ?????????? ???????????????? ?????????, ????????? ????????? ????????? ????????????. ??????????? ?????????????? ?????? ??? ??????????? ? ??????? ????????? ??????? ?????? ????????? ??????????? ? ???????? ?????????????? ??? ????? ?????????? ??? ????????????

50|$|According to Dan Gillmor when {{becoming}} mediactive (i.e., an <b>active</b> <b>consumer</b> of media) source {{credibility is}} a very important aspect. He suggests that users be skeptical; they should {{be on the lookout for}} fallacies, such as the two-side fallacy, and people who are paid to persuade. He also believes that people need to exercise judgment, the idea of assuming that everything is lying is just as much a problem as assuming that everything posted or published is the truth. Opening your mind is another important concept when considering source credibility. Most people are likely to consider a source credible if the content reflects ideas that the user also holds. Finally, Gillmor advises that people keep asking questions and follow up on sources to help realize their credibility.|$|E

This thesis has the purpose of exploring {{the nature of this}} ‘active consumer’ from a firm perspective, and thereby providing an answer to the thesis-level research question: ‘What are the implications of the <b>active</b> <b>consumer</b> on innovation and marketing practices?’ Four papers, drawing on research in the fields of consumer innovation and value cocreation, are presented that contain findings about the knowledge of the <b>active</b> <b>consumer</b> (Paper I), support (Paper II) and management (Paper III) of the <b>active</b> <b>consumer,</b> and challenges with the <b>active</b> <b>consumer</b> (Paper IV).
