25|$|The UK's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) had {{conducted}} {{a study on the}} benefit of requiring upper torso restraints (UTR, i.e., shoulder harnesses) in passenger seats of <b>aircraft</b> <b>weighing</b> less than 5,670kg in response to a safety recommendation arising from the investigation of a 1999 accident involving a Cessna Titan near Glasgow. As a result of that study, the CAA changed its regulations to require shoulder harnesses for passengers on all aircraft registered after February 1, 1989, if that aircraft has a maximum takeoff weight of 5,700 or less and 9 passenger seats or fewer. The CAA also forwarded a recommendation to the Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) of Europe, recommending that European regulators adopt a similar standard. However, {{at the time of the}} Loganair accident, the JAA had not acted on the recommendation. Although the UK regulation covered the accident aircraft (it was first certified in May, 1989), Loganair had obtained an exemption from the CAA concerning this issue.|$|E

500|$|On 20 November 2003, Notodden Airport {{was closed}} for all {{scheduled}} traffic by the Norwegian Civil Aviation Authority, due to a not conforming with safety requirements. Bergen Air Transport was forced to reroute all its aircraft to Skien Airport, Geiteryggen. Following an investment of NOK 500,000 from the airline and NOK 1.2 million from the municipality, scheduled services could commence. The municipality had ambitions to upgrade the airport to a higher standard, which would allow it to serve charter <b>aircraft</b> <b>weighing</b> more than [...] and with more than nine passengers. The plans were abandoned after 11 neighboring municipalities rejected giving grants for the necessary technical upgrades. Notodden Municipality instead started a program to increase {{the popularity of the}} airport by targeting companies in the neighboring municipality of Kongsberg to encourage use of the airport, instead of going to Oslo Airport, Gardermoen and Sandefjord Airport, Torp. Another NOK250,000 was invested from 1 October 2004 to keep meet safety requirements. Starting in October 2004, security control was introduced. In September 2007, the Bergen Air Transport bought a new hangar at Notodden, giving it ample space for expansion, and new arrival and departure facilities.|$|E
500|$|The {{airfield}} {{has been}} involved in several aviation records. On 18 September 1928, Juan de la Cierva completed the first cross-Channel flight in an autogyro when he landed there after departing from Lympne in a Cierva C.8. Lissant Beardmore completed the first cross-Channel flight in a glider on 19 June 1931. He took off from Lympne and was towed by an aircraft to an altitude of , landing at Saint-Inglevert after a flight of one and a half hours to the surprise of the airfield manager. The first double crossing of the Channel in a glider was made by Austrian Robert Kronfeld on 20 June. In a glider called Wien, he took off from Saint-Inglevert by means of an aero-tow to an altitude of , and landed at the former RAF Swingfield airfield near Dover, Kent. From Swingfield, another aero-tow to an altitude of [...] enabled him to return to Saint-Inglevert. Kronfeld received a £1,000 prize from the Daily Mail for his flights, which were verified by the British Gliding Association. On 10 September 1929, Charles Fauvel departed from Saint-Inglevert in a Mauboussin aircraft fitted with an ABC Scorpion engine.

2500|$|In late 1916, the Halberstadt D.II was {{the first}} known {{aeroplane}} for an official trial, with a special unit named the FT-Versuchsabteilung (Radio Telegraphy Experimental Detachment), with the [...] "FT" [...] possibly meaning Funk-Telegraphie, of air communications using radio communications (via Morse Code) in directing fighter aircraft. IdFlieg sanctioned the test, {{which resulted in the}} creation of a radio-telegraphy transceiver for the flight leader's <b>aircraft,</b> <b>weighing</b> 25–30kg (55-60lb) along with the battery, aircraft engine-driven generator and aerials. Receiving gear for the other aircraft in a combat formation was similarly devised, with the radio receiver weighing 12.5–15kg (27.5-33lb). By early 1917, the FT-Versuchsabteilung was making combat trials with the radio gear with Halberstadt D.III and D.V aircraft and by late September 1917 with the famous Jagdgeschwader I unit commanded by Manfred von Richthofen, especially Jasta 4. Later trials using the more advanced Albatros D.III and Albatros D.Va fighters used the gear for the first attempts at an air-based version of ground-controlled interception of Allied bomber aircraft, using visual ground spotters as the ground component by the home defence Kampfeinsitzerstaffel units.|$|E
2500|$|As {{a result}} of this accident, the AAIB issued safety {{recommendation}} 2006-101 (regarding shoulder harnesses) and a copy of their earlier study to the JAA and to the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), which would take over from the JAA as the primary European regulatory body {{over a period of several}} years, beginning before the accident. While considering this recommendation, the EASA took the interim step of issuing its own Safety Information Bulletin (SIB 2008-24), which advised the air transport community of the CAA's earlier study and of the benefits of shoulder harnesses. In 2011, the EASA published its opinion that the requirement recommended by the AAIB following the Loganair accident that shoulder harnesses should be mandatory for each passenger seat in all commercial air transport <b>aircraft</b> <b>weighing</b> less than 5,700kg, regardless of when the aircraft was first registered. The European Commission accepted the EASA opinion, and [...] new regulations requiring shoulder harnesses as described in the AAIB's safety recommendation 2006-101 became law for commercial air transport operators in Europe.|$|E
2500|$|Fourteen {{hydraulically}} operated arrester wires were distributed transversely across {{the flight deck}} between the fore and aft elevators. Taihō also had three hydraulically powered crash barriers, designed to abruptly stop any plane failing to catch an arrester wire upon landing. Two were located abreast the island and one was set at the bow. Taihō was equipped with two large [...] armored elevators, capable of transferring <b>aircraft</b> <b>weighing</b> up to [...] between decks. The elevators were widely spaced apart, with one at the far aft end {{of the ship and}} one forward of the island. It was originally desired to install a third elevator amidship, but because of wartime urgency this was deleted from the final design, thus saving both time and material. The elevators were roughly pentagonal in shape, with the aft elevator measuring [...] long and [...] wide. The forward elevator was slightly smaller in width. It took approximately 15seconds to raise an aircraft from the lower hangar deck to the flight deck and the same to lower one.|$|E
50|$|Large {{aircraft}} {{cannot be}} moved by hand and must have a tractor or tug. Pushback tractors use a low profile design to fit under the aircraft nose. For sufficient traction the tractor must be heavy, and most models can have extra ballast added. A typical tractor for large <b>aircraft</b> <b>weighs</b> up to 54 t and has a drawbar pull of 334 kN. Often the driver's cabin can be raised for increased visibility when reversing and lowered to fit under aircraft. There {{are two types of}} pushback tractors: conventional and towbarless (TBL).|$|R
5000|$|The X-43A {{aircraft}} {{was a small}} unpiloted test vehicle measuring just over 3.7 m in length. [...] The vehicle was a lifting body design, where {{the body of the}} aircraft provides a significant amount of lift for flight, rather than relying on wings. The <b>aircraft</b> <b>weighed</b> roughly 3,000 pounds (about 1,300 kilograms). The X-43A was designed to be fully controllable in high-speed flight, even when gliding without propulsion. However, the {{aircraft was}} not designed to land and be recovered. Test vehicles crashed into the Pacific Ocean when the test was over.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, the Department of Defense asked the defense {{industry}} {{to build a new}} plane, designated the Tactical Fighter Experimental, or “TFX.” Lockheed’s proposal for the new plane was designed to perform five missions: air superiority, close air support, all-weather attack, nuclear attack, and interception. The <b>aircraft</b> <b>weighed</b> approximately 80,000 pounds, more than twice the weight of a World War II bomber. Myers immediately recognized the folly inherent in the concept of what we today call multi-role aircraft. He knew that by making all the compromises necessary for the plane to perform all of these missions, it wouldn’t be able to do any of them well.|$|R
2500|$|Due to {{the success}} of Southwest Airlines, other {{airlines}} began considering the use of Love Field for short-haul trips. [...] Southwest co-founder Lamar Muse started Muse Air, a short-haul competitor using DC-9s and MD-80s between Love Field and Houston in 1982. [...] Muse Air was unable to operate profitably against Southwest at Love Field, and was purchased by Southwest in 1985 and renamed TranStar Airlines. [...] Southwest ceased TranStar operations in 1987. Continental Airlines expressed its intent to fly out of Love Field in 1985, which led to years of court battles over the interpretation of the Wright Amendment as Fort Worth and DFW International Airport continued to try to prevent expansion at Love Field. Seeing the benefit of increased air traffic at Love Field, the City of Dallas began to actively lobby for the repeal of the Wright Amendment restrictions in 1992. In 1997, the Shelby Amendment passed through Congress, amending the Wright Amendment. A compromise of sorts, the Shelby Amendment allowed Love Field flights to three more states, Kansas, Mississippi, and Alabama. It amended the definition of 56-passenger jets that could fly to other states to include any <b>aircraft</b> <b>weighing</b> less than 300,000 pounds with 56 or fewer seats.|$|E

At the same time it must have very low drag to fly at high speed during the distance and speed tasks. The launch and turning loads require very strong airframes, composite construction has been in use since the first world championship in 1977.
