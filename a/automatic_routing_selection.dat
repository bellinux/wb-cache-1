Generally, the pipe routing design {{as a part}} of the shipbuilding process requires a considerable number of man hours due to the complexity which comes from physical and operational constraints and the crucial influence on outfitting construction productivity. Therefore, the automation of pipe routing design operations and processes has always been one of the most important goals for improvements in shipbuilding design. The proposed system is applied to a pipe routing design in the engine room space of a commercial ship. The effectiveness of this system is verified as a reasonable form of support for pipe routing design jobs. The <b>automatic</b> <b>routing</b> result of this system can serve as a good basis model in the initial stages of pipe routing design, allowing the designer to reduce their design lead time significantly. As a result, the design productivity overall can be improved with this <b>automatic</b> pipe <b>routing</b> system...|$|R
