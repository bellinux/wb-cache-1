40|$|This project {{consists}} of an exploratory research pertaining to the issues linked to the future life planning of elderly parents of an adult with Down syndrome. The studies we inventoried mainly focused {{on the amount of}} residential, financial and legal planning undertaken by these elderly parents. In our study, a fourth planning modality emerged, namely affective planning. This fourth modality, which posses a greater relational dimension, is highly significant {{in the eyes of the}} perpetual parents. To apprehend this concept in more depth, it appeared important to us to question ourselves about the reasons that drive a parent to engage or not in future planning. From a life-course perspective, this study had, as its first specific objective, to identify the subjective dimensions of experience that facilitate or act as obstacles to the initiation of a life planning process and, as its second specific objective, to explore the perceived needs for formal or informal support of the elderly parents in regards to planning. Our results demonstrate that many dimensions modulate the engagement of parents in such a process. Amongst the elements acting as barriers, we find, notably, the negative experiences and representations of formal services, the negative representations of <b>alternative</b> <b>long-term</b> <b>care</b> institutions and the religious, family or continuity values of the parents. The favorable aspects notably include the regular recourse to respite services and formal services. We've also demonstrated the importance of siblings in regards to immediate instrumental and affective support, but also their capital role concerning future planning. In terms of the perceived needs of the parents, needs for general information about potential alternatives, for financial support and for respite were frequently expressed by the ageing parents...|$|E

40|$|ECONOMIC DETERMINANTS OF QUALITY OF CARE IN NURSING HOMES This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} factors that will affect nursing home quality of care using several national data sources on market regulation, county demographic characteristics, market structural and the characteristics {{of different types of}} <b>long-term</b> <b>care</b> providers in 2010. The first study examines how nine different measures of nursing home care quality respond to the greater levels of local market competition from these <b>alternative</b> providers of <b>long-term</b> <b>care,</b> as well as other nursing homes. Findings reveal that faced with greater competition from assisted living facilities, nursing homes are left to care for more disabled, less healthy patients. Although the nursing home 2 ̆ 7 s staff-to-bed ratios rise in response, other measures of care quality decline, such as more process- and outcome-based measures. Competition from home health agencies likewise has mixed effects on nursing home care quality, and competition from other nursing homes in a market tends to decrease care quality. These finding suggest that care quality in nursing homes may continue to erode as the market for <b>alternative,</b> community-based <b>long-term</b> <b>care</b> services expands. The second study examines the Medicare regulation effects on nursing home quality controlling for the whole <b>long-term</b> <b>care</b> market competition structure. In many local markets nursing homes now compete with assisted living facilities for residents, yet most previous studies of the effects of Medicaid nursing home reimbursement policies on care quality have analyzed nursing homes in isolation, ignoring the presence of nearby competitor firms, and how state regulation of assisted living facilities might also affect care quality in nursing homes. This study uses a richer model specification that accounts for a much broader range of state <b>long-term</b> <b>care</b> regulations as well as the structure of a nursing home 2 ̆ 7 s local market. Findings reveal that a higher Medicaid reimbursement rate leads to significant improvements in nine different aspects of nursing home quality, while state certificate-of-need programs for nursing homes lead to a decline in several (but not all) dimensions of it. A large presence of assisted living beds in a local market also tends to reduce nursing home quality, and state regulations regarding assisted living facilities indirectly affect nursing home care quality by altering the nature of local market competition. Overall, these results suggest that state laws related to all <b>long-term</b> <b>care</b> providers, not just nursing homes, are important determinants of nursing home care quality...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectivesTo {{compare the}} {{expected}} costs and outcomes of seven <b>alternative</b> <b>long-term</b> primary <b>care</b> {{strategies for the}} management of patients with moderate-to-severe heartburn over a 1 -year period. MethodsA decision-analytic model was developed to estimate costs and effects (weeks with heartburn symptoms and quality adjusted life years QALYs]) for each strategy. Meta-analyses were used to synthesize acute treatment and maintenance studies and physician surveys to collect information on patient management. The impact of uncertainty on the base case results was assessed using probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Probability distributions were defined for key model parameters and techniques of Monte Carlo simulation were used to draw values from these distributions. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs) conditional on the monetary value decision makers {{are willing to pay for}} a symptom-free day or QALY were created for each strategy. ResultsIn the base case, no strategy was strictly dominated by any other strategy. However, two strategies (maintenance H 2 -receptor antagonists H 2 RA] and step-down proton pump inhibitor PPI]) were dominated through principles of extended dominance. The least costly and least effective strategy was intermittent H 2 RA, while maintenance PPI was the most costly and most effective. ConclusionsThis analysis showed that the best way of managing patients with heartburn depends on how much society is willing to pay to achieve health improvements. Based on the commonly quoted threshold of $ 50, 000 per QALY, the optimal primary care strategy for managing patients with moderate-to-severe heartburn symptoms is to treat the symptoms with a PPI followed by maintenance therapy with an H 2 RA to prevent symptomatic recurrence...|$|R

With the aging of the baby boom generation, <b>long-term</b> <b>care</b> expenditures are anticipated to increase sharply in coming decades. The projected spending on <b>long-term</b> <b>care</b> presents a looming fiscal challenge for federal and state governments. As a result, some policymakers {{are looking for ways to}} reduce the proportion of <b>long-term</b> <b>care</b> spending financed by Medicaid and promote private insurance as a larger funding source. The <b>Long-Term</b> <b>Care</b> Partnership Program is a public-private partnership between states and private insurance companies, designed to reduce Medicaid expenditures by delaying or eliminating the need for some people to rely on Medicaid to pay for <b>long-term</b> <b>care</b> services. Individuals, who buy select private <b>long-term</b> <b>care</b> insurance policies that are designated by a state as partnership policies and eventually need <b>long-term</b> <b>care</b> services, first rely on benefits from their private <b>long-term</b> <b>care</b> insurance policy to cover <b>long-term</b> <b>care</b> costs before they access Medicaid. To qualify for Medicaid, applicants must meet certain eligibility requirements, including income and asset requirements. Traditionally, applicants cannot have assets that exceed certain thresholds and must "spend down" or deplete as much of their assets as is required to meet financial eligibility thresholds. To encourage the purchase of private partnership policies, <b>long-term</b> <b>care</b> insurance policyholders are allowed to protect some or all of their assets from Medicaid spend-down requirements during the eligibility determination process, but they still must meet income requirements. Congress asked that we provide summary information about the <b>Long-Term</b> <b>Care</b> Partnership Program. We examined the demographics of program participants, the types of policies purchased, and the benefits accessed by policyholders. This letter formally conveys our findings. ...|$|R
