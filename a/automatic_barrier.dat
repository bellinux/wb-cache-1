25|$|Radio {{remote control}} (RF remote control) {{is used to}} control distant objects {{using a variety of}} radio signals {{transmitted}} by the remote control device. As a complementary method to infrared remote controls, the radio remote control is used with electric garage door or gate openers, <b>automatic</b> <b>barrier</b> systems, burglar alarms and industrial automation systems. Standards used for RF remotes are: Bluetooth AVRCP, ZigBee (RF4CE), Z-Wave. Most remote controls use their own coding, transmitting from 8 to 100 or more pulses, fixed or Rolling code, using OOK or FSK modulation. Also, transmitters or receivers can be universal, meaning they are able to work with many different codings. In this case, the transmitter is normally called a universal remote control duplicator because it is able to copy existing remote controls, while the receiver is called a universal receiver because it works with almost any remote control in the market.|$|E
25|$|Following the two fatal {{accidents}} in 2003 and 2005, the railway began a programme of level crossing refurbishment. There {{are a number}} of occupation crossings with local control, where the railway meets farm tracks, but of the eighteen junctions of the railway with public highways, five are road bridges and the other thirteen are level crossings. During the late 1970s to early 1980s, all thirteen had been converted to automatic open crossings (AOCLs) by installation of flashing warning lights. Between 2006 and 2016, twelve of them were upgraded to <b>Automatic</b> <b>Barrier</b> Crossing Locally Monitored (ABCL) status. This involved the decommissioning of the life expired AOCL control equipment, the installation of lifting half-barriers and totally new control and train detection systems, at a cost of around £90,000 per crossing.) On 22nd of March 2017 the crossing at Romney Sands was commissioned as an ABCL, this means that all the 13 crossings on the line have barriers and it brought the level crossing upgrade program to a close. During the single line crossing upgrades the Road Signal heads (Wig Wags) have either been replaced with new ones (Battery Road and Dungeness Road) or had their existing heads refurbished.|$|E

50|$|The level {{crossing}} was converted to <b>automatic</b> <b>barrier</b> operation in 1989, whereupon the signal box was demolished and the junction was lifted.|$|E
50|$|Passenger {{services}} were withdrawn on 19 September 1955 but goods traffic {{continued to be}} handled until 2 October 1961. The signal box was closed in 1973 when the level crossing was converted to <b>automatic</b> <b>barrier</b> operation.|$|E
50|$|Transit New Zealand has systems {{installed}} on the State Highways surrounding the area, which alert motorists {{and in some cases}} prevent entry to the danger areas.

25|$|A level {{crossing}} (прелез in Bulgarian) in Bulgaria usually has two red lights and a flashing white light, similar to Belgian crossings. <b>Automatic</b> <b>barriers</b> protect the crossing {{and the white}} light informs correct operation, although older crossings omit the white light.|$|R
5000|$|Like its {{neighbour}} at , {{the former}} station house here remains standing {{as a private}} dwelling. The former signal box here has though been demolished, as the level crossing it worked has been converted to <b>automatic</b> <b>barrier</b> operation. [...] One platform has also survives, though it is heavily overgrown and difficult to see.|$|E
50|$|The {{station is}} unstaffed {{and has no}} {{permanent}} buildings other than basic shelters (the former station house is now a private residence). No ticketing facilities are offered, so all tickets must be bought on the train or prior to travel. Train running information {{can be obtained from}} timetable posters or a public telephone on platform 2. Step-free access is available to both platforms via the <b>automatic</b> <b>barrier</b> level crossing at the eastern end.|$|E
50|$|The Ministry of Transport of Tunisia {{has created}} a {{commission}} of inquiry into the incident and promised to provide results {{in a matter of}} a week, and already, presented their findings in 4 January 2017, and said that the direct reason is the excessive speed of the driver bus and lack of attention for voice alarm issued by the train, while the indirect reason is the delay Tunisian Railways to repair defects and <b>automatic</b> <b>barrier,</b> and lack of coordination with the authorities concerned to put temporary necessary signals, and finally the non-existence of a safety-man in the intersection at this time early, as the work begins at seven o'clock.|$|E
50|$|An {{incident}} {{occurred at the}} station's level crossing on 23 March 2011 when a fault with the <b>automatic</b> <b>barriers</b> caused a northbound CrossCountry service to pass over the crossing at 60 mph while the gates were raised (although the traffic lights were red).|$|R

25|$|Austrian level {{crossings}} (Bahnübergang in German) {{are similar to}} German crossings, in that they have either a single or double light with <b>automatic</b> <b>barriers</b> that lower when a train approaches. The crossings with two lights (one amber, one red) is the more modern, replacing old single red light crossings.|$|R
50|$|Since then, more {{upgrades}} {{have happened}} {{and the use}} of CCTV ({{and the use of}} obstacle detection systems since 2013) has increased. The Ufton Nervet rail crash in 2004 was an eye-opener for many people involved with level crossings and since then crossings have been closed or upgraded; most notably AOCLs being upgraded to <b>Automatic</b> <b>Barrier</b> Crossing Locally monitored (ABCL) status. In 2009 after the Halkirk crossing crash in Scotland, it was seen that the AOCLs on the network were the most dangerous crossing and a scheme to eradicate them was put forward. In order to do it quickly and cheaply, the full conversion to ABCL status was not done, and instead the simple addition of barriers to create an AOCL+B was the go to option. Upgrades and closures still continue into the future.|$|E

50|$|In UK railway history, Spath {{is notable}} {{as the site}} of the first {{automatic}} (i.e. train-operated) level crossing in the United Kingdom (AHBC - <b>Automatic</b> Half <b>Barrier</b> Crossing), which came into operation on 5 February 1961. The railway has now been dismantled, the road which crossed it via the automatic crossing is now gated and only leads to a farm and there is no remaining visible sign of the crossing.

50|$|After the Second World World {{the line}} through the Lüneburg Heath was reduced in stages to a {{single-track}} branch line by 1987 and several halts and stations were closed to passenger services. In addition many of the goods facilities were closed. In 1987 most of the manually operated level crossings were replaced by <b>automatic</b> <b>barriers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The rebuilt gate, {{designed}} by Jenő Kismarty-Lechner, {{has a more}} symbolical, rather than functional value. Inscriptions, ornaments and relifs, including a running angel was sculpted by Béla Ohmann. Two parts of Bástya sétány are connected {{on the top of}} the gate.

40|$|The main aim is {{to design}} a {{wireless}} alarm system using AVR microcontroller. This alarm system had a force sensor as its main component. The force sensor senses the force or pressure and then it create a sound which can make a person to avoid problems. This alarmsystem {{is used for the}} home security to detect presence of intruders getting into the home. A servo motor is also installed here this shows the automatic movement of motor which is implemented for automatic control of the gate. So, we are designing a wireless alarm system which also acts as an alarm system and also for <b>automatic</b> <b>barrier</b> control.

40|$|A {{growing number}} of people with {{learning}} disabilities are becoming parents, and many of them risk having their children removed from their care. It is difficult to establish how many parents have a learning disability because definitions are hard to apply and many people do not have this label attributed to them until they access health and social services. People with learning disabilities often find that becoming a parent exposes them to services where their disability is presumed to be an <b>automatic</b> <b>barrier</b> to parenting. This article sets out the design, delivery and results of a joint education and practice project that took place from November 2012 to November 2013 between De Montfort University and the Leicestershire Partnership Trust. The project focused on assessing and supporting parents with learning disabilities, and finding, disseminating and publishing good practice examples locally and nationally. It inspired collaboration between a number of organisations and highlighted the importance of a multidisciplinary approach Read More: [URL]...|$|E
50|$|A {{local road}} crosses {{the line at}} {{the western edge of the}} platforms, where a signal box and {{manually}} operated crossing gates can be seen. The main Grantham to Sleaford road runs to the north of the railway station and crosses the line about a quarter of a mile north east of the station, where <b>automatic</b> <b>barriers</b> are used.|$|R
50|$|Harling Road {{is a small}} {{station and}} until {{recently}} had remained largely outdated. The wooden level crossing gates adjacent to the station used to be opened and closed manually by a signaller in the Harling Road signal box. In December 2012 the signal box was closed and the crossing was renewed with <b>automatic</b> <b>barriers</b> with warning lights.|$|R
50|$|The theta symbol (θ) {{began to}} appear on APTIS tickets around late 1988, {{indicating}} that the magnetic strip on the reverse was encoded with data, allowing the ticket to operate the <b>automatic</b> <b>barriers</b> that were being installed at London Underground stations at the time.
