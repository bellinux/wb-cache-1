An active generalized control force that accomplishes the desired maneuver of a prespecified system is optimal if it minimizes a given quadratic cost function. By also varying a set of design parameters, the elastic system can be determined so as to further minimize the cost function. Here, the elastic system that minimizes the actual control cost is compared with the system that minimizes the ratio of actual cost {{to the cost of}} optimally maneuvering a rigid system of the same inertial properties. It is shown that <b>an</b> <b>elastic</b> <b>system</b> corresponding to an extremum of the ratio is actually a characteristic of the time-limited maneuver.

40|$|Six {{approximate}} {{methods to}} estimate the maximum inelastic displacement demand of single-degree-of-freedom systems are evaluated. In all methods, the maximum displacement demand of inelastic systems is estimated from the maximum displacement demand of linear <b>elastic</b> <b>systems.</b> Of the methods evalu-ated herein, four are based on equivalent linearization in which the maximum deformation is estimated as the maximum deformation of <b>a</b> linear <b>elastic</b> <b>system</b> with lower lateral sti?ness and with higher damping coe@cient {{than those of the}} inelastic system. In the other two methods the maximum inelastic displacement is estimated as a product of the maximum deformation of <b>a</b> linear <b>elastic</b> <b>system</b> with the same lateral sti?ness and the same damping coe@cient as those of the inelastic system for which the maximum displacement is being estimated, times a modifying factor. Elastoplastic and sti?ness-degrading models with periods between 0. 05 and 3 : 0 s are considered when subjected to 264 ground motions recorded on Brm sites in California. Mean ratios of approximate to exact maximum displace-ments corresponding to each method are computed {{as a function of the}} period of vibration and as a function of the displacement ductility ratio.
