25|$|Dufferin was 108.0 ft (length from {{fore part}} of stem, under the bowsprit, to the <b>aft</b> <b>side</b> {{of the head}} of the stern post), 25.0 ft (main breadth to outside of plating), 8.6 ft (depth in hold from tonnage deck to ceiling at midships), and 28.0 ft (length of engine room). Dufferin had a gross tonnage of 210.57 and a {{registered}} tonnage of 98.93. She was equipped with a Scottish compound surface condensing engine 0.20 Cylinder. 15” & 32” – 24” 42 N.H.P. (nominal horsepower). Additionally, Dufferin had two masts with auxiliary schooner rigging to supplement the steam engine. Furthermore, she had wooden framework with a carvel build, and a elliptical stern.|$|E
500|$|The ship's boilers were {{replaced}} during the refit and the 4-inch gun between the funnels {{was replaced by}} an eight-barrel QF 2-pounder Mark V pom-pom mount. A single quadruple Vickers [...]50machine gun mount was added on the starboard <b>aft</b> <b>side</b> of the flight deck. Four fire-fighting foam generators were also fitted on the flight deck. A single High Angle Control System (HACS) director was fitted on the aft end of the control top on the tripod mast. The crew, now numbering 753 sailors and 253 airmen, benefited from improved accommodation. The refit was completed on 28 November 1932, but personnel shortages prevented her from working up until April 1933.|$|E
2500|$|All four {{ships were}} placed in reserve in the mid-1880s and Kestrel and Rifleman were sold in 1888 and 1890 respectively. Frolic became a {{training}} ship for the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve in 1888 before being assigned to the Coastguard in 1893 as Watch Vessel W.V.30 and later W.V.41. She was sold for scrap on 7 April 1908. Ready was converted into a tank vessel in 1894, renamed Drudge in October 1916 and sold in Bermuda on 25 February 1920. Her new owners converted her to a lighter and she carried the winch that hoisted William Beebe's bathysphere {{up and down in}} 1930. [...] Her remains, positively identified by J. M. Greeley during an underwater archaeology field school held by East Carolina University in 1998, lie {{on the north side of}} St. George's Harbor Bermuda beside a former coaling wharf at Latitude 32°22'50.23"N and Longitude 64°40'14.68"W. The hull can be seen on Google Earth just below the water's surface on a north-south orientation with the bow towards the shoreline and the stern in deeper water. In 1998 the semicircular tracks for the gun mounts were still visible in what remained of the deck. The mounts for the boilers remained in the midsection and the outline of the boilers and funnel shaft were clearly visible on the <b>aft</b> <b>side</b> of the forward bulkhead.|$|E

The man next to me, upon the <b>aft</b> <b>side,</b> was one whom I had particularly noticed when we were led down the quay. He was {{a young man with a}} clear, hairless face, a long, thin nose, and rather nut-cracker jaws. He carried his head very jauntily in the air, had a swaggering style of walking, and was, above all else, remarkable for his extraordinary height. I don't think any of our heads would have come up to his shoulder, and I am sure that he could not have measured less than six and a half feet. It was strange among so many sad and weary faces to see one which was full of energy and resolution. The sight of it was to me like a fire in a snow-storm. I was glad, then, to find that he was my neighbor, and gladder still when, in the dead of the night, I heard a whisper close to my ear, and found that he had managed to cut an opening in the board which separated us.|$|E

50|$|Her hull was of {{unprecedented}} strength and structural integrity, {{with a relatively}} short length {{in proportion to the}} great power developed, a cut away forefoot, rounded bottom, and fore, <b>aft</b> and <b>side</b> heeling tanks.

50|$|A {{total of}} eleven {{aircraft}} were built. The first two prototypes built were in P5Y configuration, armed with 8,000 lb (3,600 kg) of munitions (bombs, mines, depth charges, torpedoes) and five pairs of 20 mm cannon in fore and <b>aft</b> <b>side</b> emplacements and a tail turret. The next five were built as R3Y-1 aircraft, intended for troop transport and inflight refuelling tanker service. The final six were built as the R3Y-2 variant with a lifting nose and high cockpit (similar in concept to the C-5 Galaxy's nose and cockpit) for heavier transport and landing-ship duties.|$|E
50|$|The {{propulsion}} system is {{split into two}} rooms. The main engines are two Wärtsilä 2V46B units, each with an output of 11,700 kW, which are positioned forward. Two smaller Wärtsilä 8L46B units, each with a 7,800 kW output are located aft. These are combined in twin Schelde gearboxes, which each have a 4,750kVA ABB alternator driven from the <b>aft</b> <b>side.</b> These in turn drive 5m diameter Lips CP propellers. This arrangement gives a service speed of 25 knots at 85% MCR. Stability is afforded {{by a pair of}} ACH fin stabilizers.|$|E

50|$|To {{compensate}} for any wind, new evacuation slides contain internal baffles, which cause the ends nearest the aircraft to inflate first, which are constructed {{to come out}} like four elbows and press against the fuselage of the aircraft to the forward and <b>aft</b> <b>sides</b> of the exit door. There are also half-tie restraints which keep the inflating slide from drooping or blowing under the aircraft. These restraints are constructed {{so that when the}} slide becomes fairly rigid, around 1.5 - 2.0 psi, they detach very quickly (there are usually two), and since the header tubes are already against the fuselage, the slide pops almost horizontally out from the door, then drops relatively gently to the ground. Tests in 25 kn cross winds have shown these deployment systems to be very effective.|$|R

Guests can enter the plane via the <b>aft</b> <b>side</b> hatch in the tail, walk through the bomb bay, visit the cockpit, and exit near the nose of the aircraft.|$|E
50|$|The {{helicopter}} seated six and {{was similar}} to other helicopters by Hiller, but featured a larger, box-shaped cabin. It has four doors, {{and a set of}} clamshell doors on its <b>aft</b> <b>side.</b> The aircraft was powered by a Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6, and in July 1961, was the first aircraft to have been powered solely by a PT6 engine. The Ten99 was developed for a United States Navy Assault Support Helicopter program. However, the Navy eventually selected the Bell HU-1 instead. A civilian model was proposed, but not produced, and the project was eventually abandoned.|$|E
50|$|Harris {{invented a}} new system in 1820, with {{lightning}} conductor plates fixed along spars and down the <b>aft</b> <b>side</b> of the mast, right down through the hull to connect to the copper sheathing of the hull. All the principal metallic masses in the ship were to be bonded to the conductor {{to ensure that there}} were no side flashes. He proposed this system to the Admiralty in 1821 but found them unresponsive to his proposals, and he campaigned to persuade the Navy to test his system, and to publicise the extent of the problem. They agreed to test the system on eleven vessels, starting in 1830.|$|E
5000|$|... "It was a {{standard}} box construction, superstructure <b>aft</b> with <b>side</b> cranes.

50|$|The tandem bicycle or twin {{is a form}} of bicycle (occasionally a tricycle) {{designed}} to be ridden by more than one person.

It {{was supposed}} to be powered by two Wright Cyclone radial engines of 1,193 kW (1,600 hp) each. Its fuselage was designed for 26 passengers. The single aisle cabin layout had eight rows of two abreast on the right and eight rows of a single seat on the left. A cargo bay was put between the passenger cabin and the cockpit. This cockpit had a layout for a crew of four. In the middle of the passenger cabin was a galley. At the <b>aft</b> <b>side</b> of the cabin was a toilet with another cargo bay.|$|E
