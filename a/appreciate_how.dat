5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{learns that}} Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) and Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) are dating each other, {{which they have}} been holding in secrecy from him in order to make his breakup with Erin easier. Andy {{attempts}} to fire Pete, but Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) points out that he can not do this since Pete and Erin already disclosed their relationship. Erin and Pete then both lecture Andy about moving on, claiming that working alongside one's ex-lover {{does not have to be}} awkward. To refute this claim, Andy hires both Pete's ex-girlfriend Alice (Collette Wolfe) and Erin's ex-boyfriend Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods). After giving Pete and Erin time to <b>appreciate</b> <b>how</b> uncomfortable this is, he holds a meeting with them and their ex-lovers, leading the two couples to argue with each other. Andy tells the camera that seeing Erin and Pete unhappy has made him feel better.|$|E
25|$|Between 1917 and 1922, the Fordson was for {{tractors}} {{somewhat like}} the Ford Model T was for automobiles—it captured the public's imagination and widely popularized the machine, with a reliable design, {{a low price}} affordable for workers and farmers, a widespread dealership network, and a production capacity for large numbers. Just as the Model T helped the public to <b>appreciate</b> <b>how</b> soon cars and trucks might replace most horses in transport, the Fordson helped people to <b>appreciate</b> <b>how</b> soon tractors might replace most horses in farming (advancing the mechanisation of agriculture). As with cars, Ford never had the market to itself, but it dominated {{the market for a}} time (for cars, roughly 1910-1925; for tractors, roughly 1917-1925). Ford was the only automotive firm to sell cars, trucks and tractors simultaneously from 1917 to 1928.|$|E

25|$|In {{trying to}} <b>appreciate</b> <b>how</b> the quarter-wave plate {{transforms}} the linearly polarized light, {{it is important}} to realize that the two components discussed are not entities in and of themselves but are merely mental constructs one uses to help appreciate what is happening. In the case of linearly and circularly polarized light, at each point in space, there is always a single electric field with a distinct vector direction, the quarter-wave plate merely has the effect of transforming this single electric field.|$|E
25|$|To <b>appreciate</b> <b>how</b> this {{quadrature}} {{phase shift}} corresponds to an electric field that rotates {{while maintaining a}} constant magnitude, imagine a dot traveling clockwise in a circle. Consider how the vertical and horizontal displacements of the dot, relative {{to the center of}} the circle, vary sinusoidally in time and are out of phase by one quarter of a cycle. The displacements are said to be out of phase by one quarter of a cycle because the horizontal maximum displacement (toward the left) is reached one quarter of a cycle before the vertical maximum displacement is reached. Now referring again to the illustration, imagine the center of the circle just described, traveling along the axis from the front to the back. The circling dot will trace out a helix with the displacement toward our viewing left, leading the vertical displacement. Just as the horizontal and vertical displacements of the rotating dot are out of phase by one quarter of a cycle in time, the magnitude of the horizontal and vertical components of the electric field are out of phase by one quarter of a wavelength.|$|E

25|$|Probably no {{instrument}} in modern time so {{lends itself to}} threats to constitutional guarantees of individual freedom as the polygraph or so-called lie detector. The threat of its use or the intimidation inherent in its use restricts free expression and communication of ideas, intrudes on an individual's subconscious thought, makes him fear to speak his thoughts freely, or compels him to speak against his will. To my mind, the entire purpose of these machines is to invade a man's mind and find what lurks in the innermost part of his mental consciousness for reasons which {{have nothing to do}} with his ability to perform a job. If the right of privacy means anything at all and if it is a right to be cherished in our society, it means that people should be entitled to have thoughts, hopes, desires, and dreams that are beyond the reach of a bureaucrat, an employer, or an electronic technician. This is something which enthusiasts for these machines do not seem to understand. They do not understand and they do not <b>appreciate</b> <b>how</b> important privacy is to each American, and as long as that lesson is not understood, we all will find our right to privacy constricted if not abrogated entirely. I propose this legislation to ban the use of the polygraph for employment purposes in the hopes that Congress will pause for a moment, step back, and take a long look at the issues involved in the unrestrained use of the polygraph. Legislation is necessary to bring some order and control to the practice...|$|E

500|$|Hitler's own {{reckless}} {{optimism and}} determination {{to hold on}} to captured territory at all costs encouraged him to believe the picture suggested by the Russians.

Thus they underestimated the forces ranged against them, a belief encouraged by continued deception operations. Pirnie points out that it did not have to succeed in every aspect to be successful. In Belarus, the German armies involved had a good idea of the locations and approximate timing of Operation Bagration, but the higher levels, Army Group Centre and OKH failed to <b>appreciate</b> <b>how</b> strong the attacks would be, or the intention to encircle the Army Group.

500|$|Reviewers {{praised the}} game's {{aesthetics}} and criticized its unoriginal puzzle concept. TouchArcade Shaun Musgrave {{wrote that the}} game's [...] "striking" [...] visuals and [...] "politically charged" [...] message were not completely reconciled but were [...] "individually strong". He described its art style as similar to Wohlwend's previous work and its political statement as indicative of Mikengreg's strong opinions. Musgrave praised the game's writing but thought the actual puzzles were weaker. 148Apps Jordan Minor found the [...] "clinical, minimally-colored cyberspace" [...] and 1970s thriller film aesthetic [...] "chillingly appropriate" [...] for the theme's tension. He also chided the puzzles for not being [...] "a reward unto themselves" [...] and the gameplay's [...] "monotony" [...] for being {{similar to that of}} Papers, Please without serving the same dehumanizing point. Minor called TouchTone [...] "essentially a series of the hacking minigames ... BioShock, Deus Ex, or Watch Dogs." [...] Pocket Gamer Craig Grannell <b>appreciate</b> <b>how</b> the game [...] "often forces a kind of upside-down thinking" [...] and compared its message to that of Blackbar. Gamezebo Jim Squires said that TouchTone is [...] "perfectly designed for a certain set of mobile gamers" [...] and compared its gameplay to the 1987 Deflektor. Despite the game's similarity to [...] "countless light-bending puzzle games", he found Mikengreg's implementation [...] "fiendishly clever" [...] in the way the player moves rows of tiles rather than one at a time.|$|E
