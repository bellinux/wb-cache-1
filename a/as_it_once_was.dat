5|$|A Baptist {{church was}} {{organized}} at Monte Ne under {{the sponsorship of}} the Benton County Baptist Association {{as a result of}} a series of revival meetings conducted there. The Monte Ne Baptist Church is still active. For a time in the summer of 1946, the Rogers Intermediate Girl Scouts held a camp at the Hotel Frances (old Hotel Monte Ne). Although it was not as active <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>once</b> <b>was,</b> the old filling station and store in downtown Monte Ne continued to serve the local population.|$|E
5|$|Activision Publishing chief {{executive}} Mike Griffith, {{in response to}} questions about Activision's approach to the Guitar Hero market, noted that Guitar Hero continues to outsell the Rock Band series in both number of sales and revenue, with consumers continuing to buy the separate games on the market, and considered the market acceptance of the multiple games as validation for their model. Regardless, after releasing 25 different SKUs (between games and bundle packages) in 2009, Activision opted to reduce that number to 10 in 2010, recognizing the music game genre was not as profitable <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>once</b> <b>was.</b> Activision later opted to put future development of the series on hold in early 2011 citing weak sales in the rhythm game genre, a move that many journalists attributed to Activision's earlier oversaturation.|$|E

5|$|The volcano's {{observed}} {{history has}} mostly {{been one of}} effusive eruptions; however, this is a relatively recent occurrence. Prior {{to the arrival of}} the first Europeans on the island, Kīlauea was the site of regular explosive activity, evidenced then by tribal chants referencing the volcano's fickle nature, and today by geological records of an explosively active mode of past activity. Although explosive activity still occurs at the volcano, it is not as intense <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>once</b> <b>was,</b> and the volcano would become much more dangerous to the general public if it returned to its old phase of activity once more.|$|E
5|$|After {{retiring}} from boxing, a decision forced on {{him by his}} ailing knee, Dyer focused on his theatre appearances. His voice though, was not <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>once</b> <b>was,</b> and he strained to reach the higher notes of his range and bookings began to dry up. Dyer then refocussed on boxing, but this time as a manager. In the 1920s he moved to London, where he set himself up as a physical culture expert and ran a small stable of fighters. The three fighters training under him were Bristolians George Rose and Reggie Hobbs and most notably Bert Kirby from Birmingham. Kirby {{went on to become}} the British flyweight champion when he took the title from Jackie Brown in 1930. Dyer also ran a gym for gentleman on the Strand, which was used by fighters such as Bantamweight champion Teddy Baldock and American Packey McFarland who Dyer faced when the two men were boxing instructors in the US Army. The gym was later demolished to make way for a new hotel and Dyer was forced to find a new location.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{inherent}} danger of its venom, B. schlegelii is frequently {{available in the}} exotic animal trade, and is well represented in zoos worldwide. It is frequently captive bred for color and pattern. Exporting from the wild is not as common <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>once</b> <b>was,</b> but is not unknown. In general they make hardy captives, readily feeding on provided mice.|$|E

Philippe Graton admitted that the draftsmanship isn't as rigorous <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>once</b> <b>was.</b>|$|E

Nonetheless, Socialist Alternative, and National Labor Students (NLS) are still very active, with both the SRC and Union President typically coming from NLS. La Trobe student organisations (both SRC and Union) were largely run by NLS over previous years, in coalition with various independent groupings.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the rise}} of thin client {{computing}} using HTML as an intermediate format has reduced the need for ODBC. Many web development platforms contain direct links to target databases – MySQL being very common. In these scenarios, {{there is no direct}} client-side access nor multiple client software systems to support; everything goes through the programmer-supplied HTML application. The virtualization that ODBC offers is no longer a strong requirement, and development of ODBC is no longer as active <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>once</b> <b>was.</b>|$|E
25|$|This {{practice}} {{is not as}} widely held by Brethren <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>once</b> <b>was.</b> Many assemblies throughout the world have developed to leave questions of head coverings, levels of female participation and responsibility to {{the discretion of the}} individual. But there are still some Brethren assemblies that seek to be completely untouched by changing attitudes within society regarding the role of women. They view the abandonment of the traditionally practised doctrine of Headship as evidence of an overall apostasy (or moral deterioration) within Christendom and as leading to disorder and eventual anarchy within their fellowships.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the other}} hand, the Royal Commission's role in {{excavation}} {{was bound to}} change from the 1970s onwards.

Former president Bill Clinton rallied at Taunton High School. The city's former Camp Myles Standish was a prisoner-of-war camp during World War II, a welcoming area {{for about a}} million U.S. and Allied soldiers, and a candidate site for the U.N. headquarters, soon after the military camp closed. Although the city hasn't been {{as much of a}} hotbed of politics <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>once</b> <b>was,</b> it still continues to be a politically active region of Massachusetts.|$|E
25|$|By June 1941, the Indusco {{system had}} reached its highest numbers, with 1,867 cooperatives with 29,284 {{registered}} members. However, {{by the end}} of World War II, the Indusco model was not as powerful <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>once</b> <b>was</b> in China. In December 1945, only 335 Indusco cooperatives with 4,889 registered members were reported. While Indusco declined in China, the model spread to other nations, including India, Burma, and Japan. Helen continued to promote the Indusco model as she remained a member and vice chairman of the American Committee to Aid Chinese Industrial Cooperatives until 1951 when it split. She revived the committee in 1981. In 1982, it was proposed that the Chinese Industrial Cooperatives be revived again, and the Peking government granted permission for such a revival in 1983.|$|E
25|$|Though not {{the first}} {{methodology}} {{in the practice of}} individual verbal psychotherapy, Freud's psychoanalytic system came to dominate the field from early in the twentieth century, forming the basis for many later variants. While these systems have adopted different theories and techniques, all have followed Freud by attempting to achieve psychic and behavioral change through having patients talk about their difficulties. Psychoanalysis is not as influential <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>once</b> <b>was</b> in Europe and the United States, though {{in some parts of the}} world, notably Latin America, its influence in the later 20th century expanded substantially. Psychoanalysis also remains influential within many contemporary schools of psychotherapy and has led to innovative therapeutic work in schools and with families and groups. There is a body of research findings which support the efficacy of psychodynamic therapies in treating a wide range of psychological disorders.|$|E
50|$|First settled circa 1883, Oslo is an unincorporated {{community}} in southeastern Indian River County, Florida, United States.

50|$|In {{contrast}} to the previous king, Nangklao, Mongkut didn't see the importance of sending envoys to the Qing dynasty court, as the mission symbolised Siam's subjection to the Qing emperors and because the Qing dynasty was then not so powerful <b>as</b> <b>it</b> had <b>once</b> <b>been,</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was itself threatened by Western powers.|$|R

25|$|There {{are about}} 2 million ethnic Tatars and 1.5 million ethnic Russians, along with {{significant}} numbers of Chuvash, Mari, and Udmurts, {{some of whom are}} Tatar-speaking. The Ukrainian, Mordvin, and Bashkir minorities are also significant. Most Tatars are Sunni Muslims, but a small minority known as Keräşen Tatars are Orthodox and some of them regard themselves as being different from other Tatars even though most Keräşen dialects differ only slightly from the Central Dialect of the Tatar language. There is a fair degree of speculation as to the early origins of the different groups of Tatars, but most Tatars no longer view religious identity as being as important <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>once</b> <b>was,</b> and the religious and linguistic subgroups have intermingled considerably. Nevertheless, despite many decades of assimilation and intermingling, some Keräşen demanded, and were awarded, the option of being specifically enumerated in 2002. This has provoked great controversy however, as many intellectuals have sought to portray the Tatars as homogeneous and indivisible. Although listed separately below, the Keräşen are still included in the grand total for the Tatars. Another unique ethnic group, living in Tatarstan only are the Qaratay Mordvins.|$|E
25|$|After {{these events}} Psylocke's powers changed once again; she now possessed both telepathic and telekinetic abilities, {{but with her}} psionic {{potential}} divided between them, neither ability is as strong <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>once</b> <b>was.</b> The following days saw Betsy travel back in time alongside Beast's X-Club. Psylocke also led the X-Club in a mission to raise Asteroid M, which {{was at the bottom}} of the Pacific Ocean, to serve as the X-Men's new base of operations and a haven for mutantkind, called Utopia. Soon after, Psylocke went to Japan with Wolverine to re-inter her former body. Upon arriving, she was ambushed by the Hand, who destroyed her original body at the behest of Matsu'o Tsurayaba. Enraged, Psylocke tracked Matsu'o down, finding him terribly disfigured as the result of Wolverine's yearly revenge on Matsu'o for his role in the murder of Mariko Yashida. Matsu'o, now missing both hands and other body parts, desired an honorable death and wanted Psylocke to grant him that honor since he could not hold a blade to perform seppuku himself. This put Psylocke at odds with Wolverine, who felt that Matsu'o's punishment was not over yet. Psylocke engaged Wolverine in a brutal fight which ended in a truce. With Wolverine's permission, Psylocke finished Matsu'o off mercifully, using her telepathy to project illusions into his mind of his body restored and of Kwannon embracing him. Psylocke quickly killed him with her psi-blade.|$|E
