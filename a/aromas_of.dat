5|$|The {{style of}} Cabernet Sauvignon is {{strongly}} influenced by the ripeness of the grapes at harvest. When more on the unripe side, the grapes are high in pyrazines and will exhibit pronounced green bell peppers and vegetal flavors. When harvested overripe the wines can taste jammy and may have <b>aromas</b> <b>of</b> stewed blackcurrants. Some winemakers choose to harvest their grapes at different ripeness levels in order to incorporate these different elements and potentially add some layer of complexity to the wine. When Cabernet Sauvignon is young, the wines typically exhibit strong fruit flavors of black cherries and plum. The aroma of blackcurrants {{is one of the}} most distinctive and characteristic element of Cabernet Sauvignon that is present in virtually every style of the wine across the globe. Styles from various regions and producers may also have <b>aromas</b> <b>of</b> eucalyptus, mint and tobacco. As the wines age they can sometimes develop aromas associated with cedar, cigar boxes and pencil shavings. In general New World examples have more pronounced fruity notes while Old World wines can be more austere with heightened earthy notes.|$|E
5|$|By Vegas standards, the 75-seat {{restaurant}} is small, and the decor is understated, keeping {{the focus on}} the food. No flowers are allowed nor are the staff permitted to wear perfumes to eliminate competition with the <b>aromas</b> <b>of</b> the cuisine. The {{restaurant is}} open Wednesday through Sunday and closed on Monday and Tuesday. It has been rated with two Michelin stars, ranked {{as one of the best}} 101 Hotel Restaurants, been voted Restaurant of the year, and in 2015 was ranked by Gayot in its Top 40 Restaurants.|$|E
50|$|Isoprenoid monoterpens {{are present}} in grape, above all acyclic linalool, geraniol, nerol, citronellol, homotrienol and {{monocyclic}} α-terpineol, mostly occurring as glycosides. Carotenoids accumulate in ripening grape berries. Oxidation of carotenoids produces volatile fragments, C13-norisoprenoids. These are strongly odoriferous compounds, such as β-ionone (<b>aroma</b> <b>of</b> viola), damascenone (<b>aroma</b> <b>of</b> exotic fruits), β-damascone (<b>aroma</b> <b>of</b> rose) and β-ionol (<b>aroma</b> <b>of</b> flowers and fruits). Tetrahydro-β-carbolines are indole alkaloids occurring in grape to a low amount and contributing to its antioxidant power. Melatonin, an alkaloid, has been identified in grape.|$|R
50|$|Fruity/Citrussy - This <b>aroma</b> is {{reminiscent}} <b>of</b> the odour and taste of fruit. The natural <b>aroma</b> <b>of</b> berries is highly {{associated with this}} attribute. The perception of high acidity in some coffees is correlated with the citrus characteristic. Tasters should be cautioned not to use this attribute to describe the <b>aroma</b> <b>of</b> unripe or overripe fruit.|$|R

5|$|Riesling {{wines are}} often {{consumed}} when young, {{when they make}} a fruity and aromatic wine which may have <b>aromas</b> <b>of</b> green or other apples, grapefruit, peach, gooseberry, honey, rose blossom or cut green grass, and usually a crisp taste due to the high acidity. However, Riesling's naturally high acidity and range of flavours make it suitable for extended aging. International wine expert Michael Broadbent rates aged German Rieslings, some hundreds of years old, highly. Sweet Riesling wines, such as German Trockenbeerenauslese are especially suited for cellaring since the high sugar content provides for additional preservation. However, high quality dry or off-dry Riesling wine is also known to have not just survived but also been enjoyable at an age exceeding 100 years.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wine}} {{regions of the}} Left Bank, the Cabernet {{influence}} of the wine has shown unique characteristics in the different regions. In Saint-Estèphe and Pessac-Léognan, the grape develops more mineral flavors. <b>Aromas</b> <b>of</b> violets are a characteristic of Margaux. Pauillac is noted by a strong lead pencil scent and Saint-Julien by cedar and cigar boxes. The Cabernet wines of the Moulis are characterized by their soft tannins and rich fruit flavors while the southern Graves region is characterized by strong blackcurrant flavors, though in less intense wines over all. The percentage of Cabernet Sauvignon used in the blend will depend on terroir and the winemakers styles {{as well as the}} vintage. The First Growth estates of Château Mouton Rothschild and Château Latour are noted for regularly producing wines with some of the highest percentage of Cabernet— often around 75%.|$|E
5|$|The grape's true origins were {{discovered}} in 1996 {{with the use of}} DNA typing at the UC Davis Department of Viticulture and Enology, by a team led by Dr. Carole Meredith. The DNA evidence determined that Cabernet Sauvignon was the offspring of Cabernet franc and Sauvignon blanc and was most likely a chance crossing that occurred in the 17th century. Prior to this discovery, this origin had been suspected from the similarity of the grapes' names and the fact that Cabernet Sauvignon shares similar aromas with both grapes—such as the blackcurrant and pencil box <b>aromas</b> <b>of</b> Cabernet franc and the grassiness of Sauvignon blanc. In 2016 scientists at the UC Davis announced they had sequenced a draft of the whole genome of the Cabernet Sauvignon grape, the first genome of a commercial wine-producing grape to be sequenced.|$|E

25|$|Ageing {{also brings}} other {{flavours}} to the wine. Barrel ageing creates scents of vanilla, butter, brioche, toast, caramel, etc. The long maturing wines like yellow wine or sherry have typical <b>aromas</b> <b>of</b> fresh walnuts, almonds, and hazelnuts.|$|E
25|$|Finally {{the soil}} can impart a flavour {{characteristic}} of a region. Thus, the mineral <b>aromas</b> <b>of</b> flint (odour of flint or of light stone) well expressed in Chardonnay B and sauvignon B, and the scent of oil is typical of old Alsatian Rieslings B.|$|E
25|$|The rosé wines {{come from}} the same grape {{varieties}} as the red wines, but have a shorter maceration period and are bottled very much sooner.

25|$|Saint-Amour - Local lore {{suggest that}} this region was named after a Roman soldier (St. Amateur) who {{converted}} to Christianity after escaping death and established a mission near the area. The wines from Saint-Amour are noted for their spicy flavors with <b>aromas</b> <b>of</b> peaches. The vin de garde wines require at least four year aging and can last up to twelve years.|$|E
25|$|Morgon - Produces earthy wines {{that can}} take on a Burgundian {{character}} of silky texture after five years aging. These wines are generally the deepest color and most rich Cru Beaujolais with <b>aromas</b> <b>of</b> apricots and peaches. Within this Cru there is a particular hillside, known as Cote du Py, {{in the center of}} Morgon that produces the most powerful examples of Morgon wines.|$|E
25|$|The fruity aromas include {{citrus fruit}} such as lemon and grapefruit, white fruit such as apple, quince, peach and apricot, and nuts such as walnut and hazelnut. Exotic fruits are also present: pineapple, mango, and lychee. Obviously the {{aromatic}} palette includes these cooked flavours: apple, jam, candied fruit, etc. White wines may also convey floral <b>aromas</b> <b>of</b> acacia, honeysuckle, verbena, violet, etc.. (Scents of honey {{can also be}} assimilated).|$|E

50|$|Key odorants {{are these}} {{compounds}} {{that you will}} effectively smell. Food products contain {{a lot of different}} volatile compounds, odorants. Some of them are present in such small concentrations that they are not perceivable by the human nose. Those odorants do not contribute to the overall <b>aroma</b> <b>of</b> a product.

Other odorous compounds were yeast by-products such as esters and acetates responsible of fruity notes. Acetophenone, γ-nonalactone and furaneol resulted responsible for almond, coconut, strawberries jam odours as well as volatile phenols guaiacol and ethylguaiacol for smoke odours...|$|R
25|$|Since the {{fermentation}} process is halted rather quickly, {{the flavors of}} Maury do retain some of the natural primary grape <b>aromas</b> <b>of</b> Grenache {{along with some of}} the early fermentation esters that develop. But most of the distinctive character of Maury come from the aging process that can take place {{in a wide range of}} containers (from concrete and oak barrels to glass bonbonnes) kept in a variety of conditions (including out in the sun for deliberate oxidation) for a number of years depending the particular house style of the winemaker.|$|E
25|$|Wines {{made from}} Nebbiolo are {{characterized}} by their ample amounts of acidity and tannin. Most examples are wines built for aging {{and some of the}} highest quality vintages need significant age (at least a decade or more) before they are palatable to many wine drinkers and can continue to improve in the bottle for upward of 30 years. As Nebbiolo ages, the bouquet becomes more complex and appealing with <b>aromas</b> <b>of</b> tar and roses being the two most common notes. Other aromas associated with Nebbiolo include dried fruit, damsons, leather, licorice, mulberries, spice as well dried and fresh herbs. While Barolo & Barbaresco tend to be the heaviest and most in need of aging, wines made in the modernist style are becoming more approachable at a young age. Lighter styles from Carema, Langhe and Gattinara tend to be ready drink within a few years of vintage. Nebbiolo from California and Australia will vary from producer and quality of vineyard.|$|E
25|$|Chianti Classico {{wines are}} characterised in their youth by their {{predominantly}} floral and cinnamon spicy bouquet. As the wine ages, <b>aromas</b> <b>of</b> tobacco and leather can emerge. Chiantis {{tend to have}} medium-high acidity and medium tannins. The acidity in the wines make them very flexible with food and wine pairings, particularly with Italian cuisines that feature red sauce, {{as well as with}} beef, lamb and game. Basic level Chianti is often characterised by its juicy fruit notes of cherry, plum and raspberry and can range from simple quaffing wines to those approaching the level of Chianti Classico. Wine expert Tom Stevenson notes that these basic everyday-drinking Chiantis are at their peak drinking qualities often between three and five years after vintage with premium examples having the potential to age for four to eight years. Well-made examples of Chianti Classico often have the potential to age and improve in the bottle for six to twenty years.|$|E
