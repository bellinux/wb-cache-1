50|$|Eldecalcitol can be {{used for}} the {{treatment}} of hypocalcaemia or osteoporosis. Calcium absorption increases with the presence of eldecalcitol by the body, occurring in the intestines, which is useful for those who have low calcium levels. Eldecalcitol is more often used due to its effects to treat osteoporosis. In the aging population, the bone matrix becomes weakened through untreated osteoporosis. This leads to an increased risk of severe fractures that include spinal and hip fractures in addition to vertebral and wrist fractures. This creates a burden on the health care system due to a decline in {{the quality of life for}} the individuals that suffer from this condition. Some risk factors leading to the predisposition of developing osteoporosis are previous incidents of bone fractures and a reduction in bone mineral density. These factors expectantly increase as age increases.Bone health is reliant on maintaining physiologically needed levels of calcium, where the body constantly maintains this calcium homeostasis through osteoblast and osteoclast activity. Osteoblast activity serves this function of maintaining appropriate calcium levels by depositing calcium in bones when blood calcium levels are above normal. In contrast, osteoclasts break down bone tissue to increase blood calcium levels if they are low. This activity is performed after absorption of calcium by the body, which requires the actions of vitamin D. The active metabolite of vitamin D, calcitriol, performs its function through interactions with the calcitriol receptor. This nuclear hormone receptor is responsible for calcium absorption which, in turn, is involving in bone depletion and formation.The new analogs of vitamin D, such as eldecalcitol, are observed to have stronger effects in preventing bone loss, fractures, and falls in comparison to calcitriol. Eldecalcitol is even more effective than its counterpart <b>alfacalcidol,</b> another vitamin D analog. Studies have shown eldecalcitol is more effective than <b>alfacalcidol</b> in preventing vertebral and wrist fractures, and even falls, with osteoporotic patients with vitamin D insufficiencies. Eldecalcitol is also more effective at preventing fractures than vitamin D and calcium supplements. Eldecalcitol increases calcium absorption for vitamin D deficient patients, and therefore could be used for osteoporosis treatment for all age groups.|$|E
50|$|Clinical {{trials have}} {{suggested}} that eldecalcitol, a vitamin D analog, has strong effects to reduce calcium reabsorption into the body from bones, therefore increasing bone mineral density, and to increase calcium absorption in intestines. In animals, eldecalcitol inhibits the activity of osteoclasts for the function to reduce bone degradation for calcium, while still able to maintain osteoblast function so as to not hinder bone formation. Unlike other vitamin D analogs, eldecalcitol does not significantly suppress parathyroid hormone levels, promising a better treatment for osteoporosis in comparison to other medications. Bone mineral density increases with eldecalcitol use, in addition to strengthening bone structure. This occurs due to {{the function of the}} eldecalcitol drug, which decreases bone reabsorption as observed through a bone reabsorption marker. Bone geometry assessments show that eldecalcitol increases cortical bone area in patients with osteoporosis more so than other vitamin D analogs, such as <b>alfacalcidol.</b> There was also the maintenance of thickness of cortical bone mass, strongly indicating that eldecalcitol improves the strength and mass of bone, specifically cortical bone structure. Adverse effects of eldecalcitol include an increase in blood and urinary calcium levels. Abnormally high levels of calcium can lead to problems associated with hypercalcemia.|$|E
40|$|In {{postmenopausal}} osteoporosis, {{the administration}} of <b>alfacalcidol</b> to women resulted {{in an increase in}} trabecular bone mineral density (BMD), prevention of cortical bone loss, and a significant reduction in the incidence of further vertebral fractures. There is now robust evidence that <b>alfacalcidol</b> may be particularly active in conditions characterized by an increased rate of bone loss. <b>Alfacalcidol</b> 1 microg/day fully prevented vertebral bone loss over 3 years in women after the first year of menopause. In a large cohort of individuals starting treatment with high dose corticosteroid (CS, 46. 6 mg equivalent prednisolone per day), the spinal bone loss observed in untreated patients was fully prevented by administration of 1 microg/day <b>alfacalcidol.</b> In patients with established CS-induced osteoporosis, with or without prevalent vertebral fractures, 1 microg/day of <b>alfacalcidol,</b> given for 3 years, increased lumbar spine density, reduced back pain, and showed a significant reduction in the rate of new vertebral fractures, compared to native vitamin D. In cardiac transplant recipients, <b>alfacalcidol</b> and calcium reduced spinal and femoral bone loss, compared to a control group treated with etidronate and calcium. Alfacalcidol-treated patients experienced fewer new vertebral fractures over the 2 -year followup. When <b>alfacalcidol</b> and vitamin D 3 were compared in elderly women with radiologic evidence of vertebral fracture, fractional calcium absorption was increased after 3 months with <b>alfacalcidol</b> but was unchanged with vitamin D 3. In a recent metaanalysis of 14 studies of native vitamin D and 19 studies of D-hormone analogs (<b>alfacalcidol</b> and calcitriol), the D-analogs exerted a higher preventive effect on bone loss and fracture rates in patients with no exposure to CS. In head-to-head studies comparing D-analogs and native vitamin D in patients receiving CS, this metaanalysis identified significant effects favoring D-analogs for femoral neck BMD and spinal fractures. In conclusion, improvement in bone turnover, increase in BMD, and reduction in fracture rates have been described during <b>alfacalcidol</b> treatment in situations characterized by a high rate of bone loss, including CS-induced osteoporosis, early postmenopausal bone loss, and organ transplant. Compared to plain vitamin D, <b>alfacalcidol</b> exerts higher bone-protective effects, thus allowing the doses to be minimized and lowering the risk of adverse effects, including hypercalcemia.

Very {{few studies have examined}} the effectiveness of pulse <b>alfacalcidol</b> therapy in comparison to daily oral <b>alfacalcidol</b> therapy in suppressing serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels in hemodialysis patients. The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to replicate the findings of prior studies comparing effectiveness of pulse oral <b>alfacalcidol</b> therapy versus daily oral <b>alfacalcidol</b> therapy in suppressing PTH after 13 weeks of therapy using a Palestinian sample of hemodialysis patients, and to identify demographic and biomedical characteristics of patients that are independently associated with PTH levels. Methods: One hundred and sixty-seven patients completed the study, 88 in the daily group and 79 in the pulse group. The pulse group had more clinically significant reduction in mean PTH level by 75 pg/dL at 13 weeks than the daily group, but this was not statistically significant. Results: The effect of <b>alfacalcidol</b> therapy on metabolism of phosphate and corrected calcium levels was comparable in both groups, and pulse therapy was not associated with increased risk of hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia.

The objective {{of this study is}} to examine whether eldecalcitol is superior to <b>alfacalcidol</b> in preventing osteoporotic fractures. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT 00144456. Methods and resultsThis 3 year randomized, double-blind, active comparator, superiority trial tested the efficacy of daily oral 0. 75 μg eldecalcitol versus 1. 0 μg <b>alfacalcidol</b> for prevention of osteoporotic fractures. 1054 osteoporotic patients 46 to 92 years old were randomly assigned 1 : 1 to receive eldecalcitol (n= 528) or <b>alfacalcidol</b> (n= 526). Patients were stratified by study site and serum 25 -hydroxyvitamin D level. Patients with low serum 25 -hydroxyvitamin D levels (< 50 nmol/L) were supplemented with 400 IU/day vitamin D 3. Primary end point was incident vertebral fractures. Secondary end points included any non-vertebral fractures and change in bone mineral density and bone turnover markers. Compared with the <b>alfacalcidol</b> group, the incidence of vertebral fractures was lower in eldecalcitol group after 36 months of treatment (13. 4 vs. 17. 5 %; hazard ratio, 0. 74; predefined 90 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 56 – 0. 97). Eldecalcitol reduced turnover markers and increased bone mineral density more strongly than <b>alfacalcidol.</b> Eldecalcitol reduced the incidence of three major non-vertebral fractures, which was due to a marked reduction in wrist fractures by a post-hoc analysis (1. 1 vs. 3. 6 %; hazard ratio, 0. 29; 95 % CI, 0. 11 – 0. 77).

40|$|One {{hundred and}} forty-five {{patients}} suffering from diseases requiring long-term treatment with {{high doses of}} corticosteroids (30 mg/day or greater of prednisolone) were recruited to the study. Patients had to be steroid naive on entry to the study (not more than 15 days of treatment with a corticosteroid within the previous 24 months). Patients were randomized to receive either 1 microgram/day <b>alfacalcidol</b> or placebo capsules for 12 months. Bone mineral density (BMD) of the lumbar spine was assessed by dual-photon absorptiometry on entry and after 3, 6 and 12 months' treatment. Safety was monitored by the recording of all adverse events reported by patients and the regular screening of blood samples for hematology and serum biochemistry. Of the 145 patients, 74 were randomized to <b>alfacalcidol</b> and 71 to placebo.

40|$|International audienceThis study {{intended}} {{to determine whether}} the replacement of vitamin D 3 with <b>alfacalcidol</b> results in any bone mineral density (BMD) increase in 76 patients unresponsive to the combination of alendronate and conventional vitamin D 3 treatment. In these patients the conventional vitamin D 3 had been replaced with <b>alfacalcidol</b> (0. 5  μg/day), and then the patients were followed up for a year. After treatment for 1  year, Wilcoxon test revealed a small but statistically significant ( <  0. 001) increase in the BMD values of the forearm and lumbar vertebrae, in the serum calcium and urinary calcium/creatinine ratio in first-voided morning urine. However, the serum alkaline phosphatase activity, phosphorus, parathormone, osteocalcin levels and the urinary -pyr/creatinine ratio decreased significantly ( <  0. 001). As suggested by our results, combination therapy with alendronate and <b>alfacalcidol</b> increases bone density and improves the biochemical markers of bone turnover, without any substantial increase in the incidence of adverse effects...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>alfacalcidol</b> therapy on bone mineral density at the spine and {{proximal}} femur was evaluated in 112 transplant recipients (59 heart, 26 liver and 27 lung); 45 transplant cases served as controls (included in a randomised {{way in a}} placebo group) and in 42 rheumatoid arthritis cases. Liver and lung transplantation cases had before transplantation a lower bone density at the spine and femur compared to heart transplant cases. Heart transplant cases lost considerably more bone immediately after transplantation than liver and lung transplant recipients. A positive effect of 2 years <b>alfacalcidol</b> treatment (0. 5 - 1 microgram/day) on bone loss was observed in all treated groups. <b>Alfacalcidol</b> was particularly effective against trabecular bone loss at the spine in rheumatoid arthritis patients and transplant recipients.

40|$|SummaryBackground & aimsThis participant-blinded parallel-group {{randomized}} placebo-controlled study {{demonstrated that}} <b>alfacalcidol</b> (vitamin D analogue) preserves beta cell function in newly diagnosed {{type 1 diabetes}} (T 1 DM) in children. MethodsSubjects from outpatient clinic were randomized to intervention and control groups. Inclusion: (1) age 8 – 15, (2) T 1 DM, (3) duration < 8 weeks, (4) no chronic diseases, (5) stable diet. Exclusion: (1) vitamin D, calcium supplements or fortified foods, (2) hypercalcemia. Intervention group received <b>alfacalcidol</b> 0. 25 μg twice daily, while control group received placebo. Insulin given physician-titrated to blood glucose. Safety monitored by serum calcium and phosphate. Beta cell function assessed at 0, 3, 6 months using fasting C-peptide (FCP) and daily insulin dosage per body weight (DID). Primary outcome measured using multivariate repeated measures GLM-ANOVA, with FCP and DID as primary measures and age, gender, sunlight exposure, 25 -hydroxy vitamin D, and HbA 1 c as covariates. ResultsOf 61 subjects, 7 dropped out. GLM-ANOVA showed that groups were different (p= 0. 019, Eta-squared= 0. 087), with no significant covariates. FCP was higher and DID lower in the intervention group, with males having stronger responses to <b>alfacalcidol</b> (p= 0. 001). No adverse effects were observed. ConclusionsThe study confirmed that <b>alfacalcidol</b> can safely preserve beta cell function in newly diagnosed T 1 DM in children, with a stronger effect in males. Clinical Trial Reg.

40|$|Abstract Background Secondary {{hyperparathyroidism}} is {{a common}} feature in patients with chronic kidney disease. Its serious clinical consequences include renal osteodystrophy, calcific uremic arteriolopathy, and vascular calcifications that increase morbidity and mortality. Reduced synthesis of active vitamin D contributes to secondary hyperparathyroidism. Therefore, this condition is managed with activated vitamin D. However, hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia limit the use of activated vitamin D. In Denmark <b>alfacalcidol</b> is the primary choice of vitamin D analog. A new vitamin D analog, paricalcitol, may be less prone to induce hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia. However, a randomised controlled clinical study comparing <b>alfacalcidol</b> and paricalcitol has never been performed. The primary objective {{of this study is}} to compare <b>alfacalcidol</b> and paricalcitol. We evaluate the suppression of the secondary hyperparathyroidism and the tendency towards hyperphosphatemia and hypercalcemia. Methods/Design This is an investigator-initiated cross-over study. Nine Danish haemodialysis units will recruit 117 patients with end stage renal failure on maintenance haemodialysis therapy. Patients are randomised into two treatment arms. After a wash out period of 6 weeks they receive increasing doses of <b>alfacalcidol</b> or paricalcitol for a period of 16 weeks and after a further wash out period of 6 weeks they receive the contrary treatment (paricalcitol or <b>alfacalcidol)</b> for 16 weeks. Discussion Hyperparathyroidism, hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia are associated with increased cardiovascular mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease. If there is any difference in the ability of these two vitamin D analogs to decrease the secondary hyperparathyroidism without causing hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia, there may also be a difference in the risk of cardiovascular mortality depending on which vitamin D analog that are used. This has potential major importance for this group of patients. Trial registration ClinicalTrials. gov NCT 004695 </p...|$|E

A retrospective {{study was conducted to}} investigate the 3 -year outcome of combined {{treatment with}} alendronate and <b>alfacalcidol</b> in patients with severe bone loss (BMD &le; 50 % of the young adult mean) and osteoporotic fracture. Methods: Thirty-four patients (six men and 28 postmenopausal women) with primary or secondary osteoporosis who had been treated with alendronate and <b>alfacalcidol</b> for more than 3 years were analyzed. The lumbar spine or total hip BMD and bone turnover markers were monitored, and the incidence of osteoporotic fractures was assessed. Results: The urinary level of cross-linked N-terminal telopeptides of type I collagen and serum level of alkaline phosphatase significantly decreased (- 42. 5 % at 3 months and - 18. 9 % at 3 years), and the lumbar spine BMD, but not the total hip BMD, significantly increased (14. 8 % at 3 years), compared with the baseline values. However, the incidence of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures was 26. 5 % and 2. 9 %, respectively, suggesting a high incidence of vertebral fractures. Conclusion: The {{results of the present study}} suggest that combined treatment with alendronate and <b>alfacalcidol</b> may be useful to reduce bone turnover and increase the lumbar spine BMD in patients with severe bone loss and osteoporotic fracture. However, its efficacy against vertebral fractures appears not to be sufficient. Thus, anabolic agents such as teriparatide should be taken into consideration as first-line drugs in patients with severe osteoporosis.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Treatment with {{glucocorticoids}} {{is associated}} with bone loss starting soon after therapy is initiated and {{an increased risk of}} fracture. METHODS: We performed a randomized, double-placebo, double-blind clinical trial of 18 months' duration among patients with a rheumatic disease who were starting glucocorticoids at a daily dose that was equivalent to at least 7. 5 mg of prednisone. A total of 201 patients were assigned to receive either alendronate (10 mg) and a placebo capsule of <b>alfacalcidol</b> daily or <b>alfacalcidol</b> (1 microg) and a placebo tablet of alendronate daily. The primary outcome was the change in bone mineral density of the lumbar spine in 18 months; the secondary outcome was the incidence of morphometric vertebral deformities. RESULTS: A total of 100 patients received alendronate, and 101 received alfacalcidol; 163 patients completed the study. The bone mineral density of the lumbar spine increased by 2. 1 percent in the alendronate group (95 percent confidence interval, 1. 1 to 3. 1 percent) and decreased by 1. 9 percent in the <b>alfacalcidol</b> group (95 percent confidence interval, - 3. 1 to - 0. 7 percent). At 18 months, the mean difference of change in bone mineral density between the two groups was 4. 0 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 2. 4 to 5. 5 percent). Three patients in the alendronate group had a new vertebral deformity, as compared with eight patients in the <b>alfacalcidol</b> group (of whom three had symptomatic vertebral fractures) (hazard ratio, 0. 4; 95 percent confidence interval, 0. 1 to 1. 4). CONCLUSIONS: During this 18 -month trial in patients with rheumatic diseases, alendronate was more effective in the prevention of glucocorticoid-induced bone loss than was <b>alfacalcidol.</b> (ClinicalTrials. gov number, NCT 00138983 [ClinicalTrials. gov].) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The vitamin D {{receptor}} activator paricalcitol {{has been}} shown to reduce albuminuria. Whether this is a unique property of paricalcitol, or common to all vitamin D analogues, is unknown. The primary aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of <b>alfacalcidol</b> on proteinuria, measured as 24 [*]hour (24 [*]h) albuminuria, in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 4 – 5 being treated for secondary hyperparathyroidism (sHPT). Methods A retrospective single-center study including adult patients with CKD 4 – 5, undergoing treatment for sHPT with <b>alfacalcidol,</b> with macroalbuminuria in minimum one 24 [*]h urine collection. Patients were identified in a prospectively collected database of all patients with S-creatinine > 300 [*]μM or creatinine clearance st of January 2005 to 31 st of December 2009. Phosphate binders and <b>alfacalcidol</b> were provided to patients free of charge. Results A total of 146 macroalbuminuric patients were identified, and of these, 59 started <b>alfacalcidol</b> treatment during the observation period. A 12 % reduction in 24 [*]h albuminuria was seen after starting treatment. In 19 patients with no change in renin-angiotensin-aldosteron-system (RAAS) inhibition, the reduction in albuminuria was 16 %. The reduction remained stable over time (9 %) in a subgroup of patients (n = 20) with several urine collections before and after the start of alfacalcidol-treatment. Conclusion The present study supports experimental and clinical data on antiproteinuric actions of activated vitamin D analogues, and suggests that this may be a class-effect. </p...|$|E

The effect of alendronate on QOL was investigated {{compared with that of}} <b>alfacalcidol</b> in postmenopausal osteoporotic women. Patients and methods: A total of 44 postmenopausal osteoporotic women (mean age 69. 8 years) with back or joint pain, although capable of walking, were randomly assigned to two groups; group A (n = 25) received 5 mg/day of alendronate, and group B (n = 19) received 0. 5 &mu;g/day of <b>alfacalcidol,</b> for the first 4 months. For the following 2 months, the group A received 0. 5 &mu;g/day of <b>alfacalcidol</b> and the group B received 5 mg/day of alendronate in a crossover design. The patient&rsquo;s QOL was evaluated by score of Japanese Osteoporosis Quality of Life Questionnaire (JOQOL), and pain intensity using a visual analog scale (VAS). Bone metabolism was measured by bone mineral density (BMD) and a biomarker for bone resorption, urinary crosslinked N-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (NTX). Results: With 4 -month treatment, alendronate, but not <b>alfacalcidol,</b> improved pain-related QOL, reduced joint pain by VAS, and increased bone mineral density. Both treatments significantly reduced bone resorption, the inhibition was significantly higher with alendronate (&minus; 56. 5 %) compared with <b>alfacalcidol</b> (&minus; 18. 1 %). After crossover, the patients in group A received <b>alfacalcidol</b> and had a reduced total and daily living activity-related QOL scores, and increased upper back pain by VAS. The group B received alendronate had significantly reduced bone resorption after the 2 months. Conclusion: Alendronate improves the QOL of Japanese postmenopausal women with osteoporosis by reducing pain intensity as well as increasing bone mineral density.

40|$|What is {{the optimal}} regimen for vitamin D? The past 30 {{years have seen}} {{substantial}} advances {{in our understanding of}} the pathogenesis of the mineral, hormonal and skeletal disorders that comprise renal osteodystrophy. The introduction of calcitriol and <b>alfacalcidol</b> as treatments for this disorder in the early 1970 s represented an enormous step forward in clinical practice, but unfortunately, the subsequent refinement of these therapies still leaves us well short of the ideal: hyperphosphatemia and hypercalcemia induced by the vitamin D metabolites, and failure to control parathyroid hyperplasia, all remain problematic. Novel pulsed regimens using <b>alfacalcidol</b> and calcitriol, while clearly effective, have not fulfilled initial high expectations of superiority in the context of comparative studies. New vitamin D metabolites, some of which have exhibited desirable selectivity in experimental settings with reduced tendency to raise phosphate and/or calcium while maintaining good control of the parathyroid glands, are now being evaluated. Of these, 22 -oxacalcitriol, paricalcitol (19 nor- 1, 25 dihydroxyvitamin D 2) and doxercalciferol (1 α-hydroxyvitamin D 2) have all shown high efficacy when compared with placebo, but so also did <b>alfacalcidol</b> and calcitriol in similar studies in the 1970 s and 1980 s. The results of randomized studies comparing the new vitamin D metabolites with current standard therapy (<b>alfacalcidol</b> or calcitriol) are either not yet available or show uncertain benefits in relation to hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia and hyperparathyroidism. The impact of these new metabolites on the increasing prevalence of low turnover bone disease is unknown, although experimentally there is evidence of potentially important differences {{at the level of the}} skeleton...|$|E
