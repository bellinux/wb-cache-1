5|$|Abra, Kadabra, and Alakazam, {{known in}} Japan as , , and , are three Pokémon species in Nintendo and Game Freak's Pokémon {{franchise}} that are linked through evolution. Abra evolves into Kadabra after gaining enough experience in battle, and Kadabra evolves into Alakazam after being traded to another trainer. Created by Ken Sugimori, they {{first appeared in}} the video games Pokémon Red and Blue and later appear in subsequent sequels. They have appeared in various merchandise, spinoff titles and animated and printed adaptations of the franchise. Known as the Psi Pokémon, using self-hypnosis, Abra spends 18 hours a day sleeping, unable to utilize its abilities unless rested. This behavior ceases once it evolves into Kadabra, a strong psychic that emits <b>alpha</b> <b>waves</b> affected by its current mental state. Able to remember everything since its birth, Alakazam's IQ is around 5000 and can outperform a supercomputer. Alakazam {{is also one of the}} handful of Pokémon to be capable of undergoing Mega Evolution, which increases its strength and makes it appearance undergo a few noticeable changes.|$|E
5|$|As a {{side effect}} of the {{electrochemical}} processes used by neurons for signaling, brain tissue generates electric fields when it is active. When large numbers of neurons show synchronized activity, the electric fields that they generate can be large enough to detect outside the skull, using electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG). EEG recordings, along with recordings made from electrodes implanted inside the brains of animals such as rats, show that the brain of a living animal is constantly active, even during sleep. Each part of the brain shows a mixture of rhythmic and nonrhythmic activity, which may vary according to behavioral state. In mammals, the cerebral cortex tends to show large slow delta waves during sleep, faster <b>alpha</b> <b>waves</b> when the animal is awake but inattentive, and chaotic-looking irregular activity when the animal is actively engaged in a task. During an epileptic seizure, the brain's inhibitory control mechanisms fail to function and electrical activity rises to pathological levels, producing EEG traces that show large wave and spike patterns not seen in a healthy brain. Relating these population-level patterns to the computational functions of individual neurons is a major focus of current research in neurophysiology.|$|E
5|$|Abra uses various extrasensory powers, {{even when}} sleeping. With {{the ability to}} read minds, they can sense danger, teleporting when it does and can do so quickly enough to create visual doubles. Using self-hypnosis, Abra spends 18 hours a day sleeping, unable to utilize its telekinesis unless rested. This {{behavior}} ceases once it evolves into Kadabra, a strong psychic that emits <b>alpha</b> <b>waves</b> affected by its current mental state. These waves can trigger headaches in nearby people and can cause machines to malfunction. Once it evolves into Alakazam, it has mastered every type and form of psychic ability, and its brain continually grows. This causes its head to become too heavy for its neck, requiring telekinesis to hold it upright. Able to remember everything that it has experienced since hatching as an Abra, Alakazam has an IQ that exceeds 5,000 and can outperform a supercomputer. Both Kadabra and Alakazam utilize spoons generated mentally to enhance their abilities, two for the latter, and can increase them further by closing their eyes. Upon Mega Evolving, Mega Alakazam's mental abilities become even more pronounced due to it manifesting an organ on its forehead that emits psychic power. It also manifests three additional spoons alongside the two it possessed as Alakazam. Kadabra and Alakazam can engage in precognition, while all three Pokémon in the evolution line are capable of creating spaces where battle factors are affected.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Alpha</b> <b>Wave</b> Movement (established 1992 in Miami, Florida) is the {{electronic}} music project of Gregory T. Kyryluk. <b>Alpha</b> <b>Wave</b> Movement's musical style {{can be considered}} ambient, new-age, some space rock, the classic 1970s period German style electronic music otherwise known as Berlin school {{as well as the}} ambient aesthetics of Brian Eno, and Steve Roach. Releases such A Distant Signal and Terra have more ambient space elements than other <b>Alpha</b> <b>Wave</b> Movement releases. Beyond Silence has more space rock elements and has a more rhythmic feel in their overall music compositions. In 2007 <b>Alpha</b> <b>Wave</b> Movement released The Mystic & The Machine, a musical exploration of 1970's era romantic progressive rock performed on synthesizers with the addition of UK musician Steve Hillman on electric guitar. The influences of Genesis, Ozric Tentacles (1980s era), and Camel are quite obvious and intended and shows yet another side of <b>Alpha</b> <b>Wave</b> Movement's composition. <b>Alpha</b> <b>Wave</b> Movement's music is semi electronic-based, utilizing digital synthesizers and MIDI to create its sonic explorations. Aside from the music influences nature and natural landscapes are a continuous source of inspiration for compositions. <b>Alpha</b> <b>Wave</b> Movement has performed at the Ambient Ping Canada and at the Gathering Room USA. <b>Alpha</b> <b>Wave</b> Movement has released music on the Dutch label Groove Unlimited, Silent Records (USA), Waveform Records (USA), Spiralight (USA), Anodize (USA)and on the private label Harmonic Resonance Recordings. <b>Alpha</b> <b>Wave</b> Movement's other projects include Thought Guild, Open Canvas, Subtle Shift and a solo release as Gregory Kyryluk.The latest release from <b>Alpha</b> <b>Wave</b> Movement is entitled [...] "Soniq Variants"(2011). The release is based conceptually on the use of Ensoniq synthesizers solely for the compositions. Ensoniq was an American manufacturer that spearheaded early affordable synthesizer workstation's the first of which was the ESQ-1 in 1986. Music on this release was composed primarily on the ESQ-1, VFX-SD, SQ-R and a DP4 all of which were made by Ensoniq. Additional use of a Novation synthesizer was also incorporated to add some timbral variation.The year 2012 arrived with a new electronic music project by Gregory Kyryluk under the alias of Subtle Shift. This new project dives head into the ambient dub waterways. Featuring a more sublime percussive foundation, environmental soundscapes. Drawn on the influences of the Detroit and European creative pioneering spirits such as Rod Modell and Yagya, GAS as well as incorporating 1970s electro aesthetics. To date there are four full length releases by Within Reason on the Anodize and Harmonic Resonance Recording labels.In 2014 {{the electronic}}a world fusion project Open Canvas(essentially Gregory Kyryluk) had a track from the Waveform Records release [...] "Indumani" [...] featured in the internationally popular gothic horror show True Blood.

The light target was moved either at a constant velocity or positively or negatively accelerated to compensate for the magnification factor of the visual cortex. We compared probability and latency of motion recognition when it was asynchronous or synchronized to different phases of the <b>alpha</b> <b>wave</b> of the EEG recorded over the occipital cortex. If the motion accelerated away from the fixation point and was synchronized with the <b>alpha</b> <b>wave</b> it was more likely to be perceived whereas if it was towards the fixation point it was less likely to be detected.

40|$|Abstract To {{identify}} {{the effect of}} the aroma foot spa on the stress, 12 university students with stress were divided into control group (6 subjects) and aroma foot spa group (6 subjects). Control group was not subjected to any kind of intervention while aroma foot spa group was subjected to 10 minutes of foot bath using 5 % Juniper, lavender and lemon essential oil and 10 minutes of foot massage using massage cream during four weeks, two times per week. As for the evaluation method, brain wave was studied to measure the amount of change in stress. After measuring the change in the brain wave before and after the experiment, it was proven that the aroma foot spa group’s <b>Alpha</b> <b>wave</b> (Z=- 2. 364, p<. 05) and SMR wave (Z=- 1. 981, p<. 05) were higher than those of the control group.

In other words, aroma foot spa that included foot bath using essential oil and foot massage increased <b>Alpha</b> <b>wave</b> which in turn influenced the brain wave due to increased blood circulation resulting from muscle relaxation.

2500|$|A {{platform}} game (or platformer) is a [...] type {{of video}} game, and subgenre of action game. It involves guiding a player character or avatar to jump between suspended platforms and/or over obstacles to traverse their environment. The player controls the jumps to avoid letting their character fall to their death or miss necessary jumps. The most common unifying element of games of this genre is the jump button, {{but now there}} are other alternatives like swiping a touchscreen.

2500|$|Neural {{oscillations}} {{have been}} most widely studied in neural activity generated by large groups of neurons. Large-scale activity can be measured by techniques such as EEG. In general, EEG signals have a broad spectral content similar to pink noise, but [...] also reveal oscillatory activity in specific frequency bands. The first discovered and best-known frequency band is alpha activity (7.5–12.5 Hz) that can be detected from the occipital lobe during relaxed wakefulness and which increases when the eyes are closed. Other frequency bands are: delta (14Hz), theta (48Hz), beta (1330Hz) and gamma (3070Hz) frequency band, where faster rhythms such as gamma activity {{have been linked to}} cognitive processing. Indeed, EEG signals change dramatically during sleep and show a transition from faster frequencies to increasingly slower frequencies such as <b>alpha</b> <b>waves.</b> In fact, different sleep stages are commonly characterized by their spectral content. Consequently, neural oscillations have been linked to cognitive states, such as awareness and consciousness.|$|E

2500|$|Spontaneous {{activity}} is brain {{activity in the}} absence of an explicit task, such as sensory input or motor output, and hence also referred to as resting-state activity. It is opposed to induced activity, i.e. brain activity that is induced by sensory stimuli or motor responses. [...] The term ongoing brain {{activity is}} used in electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography for those signal components that are not associated with the processing of a stimulus or the occurrence of specific other events, such as moving a body part, i.e. events that do not form evoked potentials/evoked fields, or induced activity. Spontaneous activity is usually considered to be noise if one is interested in stimulus processing; however, spontaneous activity is considered to play a crucial role during brain development, such as in network formation and synaptogenesis. [...] Spontaneous activity may be informative regarding the current mental state of the person (e.g. wakefulness, alertness) and is often used in sleep research. Certain types of oscillatory activity, such as <b>alpha</b> <b>waves,</b> are part of spontaneous activity. Statistical analysis of power fluctuations of alpha activity reveals a bimodal distribution, i.e. a high- and low-amplitude mode, and hence shows that resting-state activity does not just reflect a noise process. In case of fMRI, spontaneous fluctuations in the Blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signal reveal correlation patterns that are linked to resting states networks, such as the default network. The temporal evolution of resting state networks is correlated with fluctuations of oscillatory EEG activity in different frequency bands.|$|E
