5|$|Blyton's Noddy, <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> wooden {{boy from}} Toyland, first {{appeared}} in the Sunday Graphic on 5 June 1949, and in November that year Noddy Goes to Toyland, the first of at least two dozen books in the series, was published. The idea was conceived by one of Blyton's publishers, Sampson, Low, Marston and Company, who in 1949 arranged a meeting between Blyton and the Dutch illustrator Harmsen van der Beek. Despite having to communicate via an interpreter, he provided some initial sketches of how Toyland and its characters would be represented. Four days after the meeting Blyton sent the text of the first two Noddy books to her publisher, to be forwarded to van der Beek. The Noddy books became one of her most successful and best-known series, and were hugely popular in the 1950s. An extensive range of sub-series, spin-offs and strip books were produced throughout the decade, including Noddy's Library, Noddy's Garage of Books, Noddy's Castle of Books, Noddy's Toy Station of Books and Noddy's Shop of Books.|$|E

500|$|Because Bakshi {{wanted the}} voices to sound organic, he experimented with improvisation, {{allowing}} his actors to ad lib during the recording sessions.

During the production of Return of the Jedi in 1982, Lucas approached Warwick Davis, who was portraying Wicket the Ewok, about playing Willow Ufgood. Five years passed before he was actually cast in the role. Lucas [...] "thought {{it would be great to}} use a little person in a lead role.

500|$|UT {{running backs}} Henry Melton and Ramonce Taylor also {{received}} criticism. Taylor {{was criticized for}} running backwards and sideways {{in an effort to}} gain yards, instead of moving ahead and breaking tackles. The Daily Texan observed [...] "Five of Taylor's 15carries resulted in a loss or no gain for a total of minus-17yards. However, the other 10carries totaled 119yards for an average of 11.9yards per positive running play. The sophomore didn't have a positive gain of fewer than 5yards and accumulated three runs of 20yards or longer." [...] Greg Davis, UT's offensive coordinator, said [...] "Ramonce is a darter. The only time that really concerned me was a third-and-two situation. We talked to him on the sideline <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit more down and distance awareness." [...] Melton was criticized for [...] "tiptoeing indecisively". and letting himself get tackled near the line of scrimmage.|$|E
500|$|By {{the start}} of the 1890s, Lloyd had built up a {{successful}} catalogue of songs, which included [...] "What's That For, Eh?", <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> girl who asks her parents the meaning of various everyday household objects. Her biographer and theatre historian W. J. MacQueen-Pope described the song as being [...] "blue" [...] and thought that it spoke volumes about her reputation thanks to her [...] "wonderful wink, and that sudden, dazzling smile, and the nod of the head." [...] Similar-styled songs followed; [...] "She'd Never had her Ticket Punched Before", told the story of a young, naive woman travelling to London on her own by train. [...] This was followed by [...] "The Wrong Man Never Let a Chance go By"; [...] "We Don't Want to Fight, But, by Jingo, If we Do"; [...] "Oh You Wink the Other Eye" [...] and [...] "Twiggy Vous"—a song which won her much success and increased her popularity abroad. After an evening's performance at the Oxford music hall, a French well-wisher requested a conversation and to meet Lloyd backstage. [...] Flanked by Courtenay, she appeared at the stage door, where Courtenay threatened the man with violence as both had become suspicious of his interest in her. She took a chance and invited the man into her dressing room, where he identified himself {{as a member of the}} French government. He confirmed to her that [...] "Twiggy Vous" [...] was [...] "most popular in Paris"; she was delighted at the news. [...] At the end of the year, Lloyd returned to London where she appeared in the Christmas pantomime Cinderella in Peckham alongside her sister Alice.|$|E
500|$|The {{story is}} <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> boy who leaves his {{home with his}} dog to shop for food items for his mother, and {{attempts}} to remember the list of things {{she wanted him to}} buy. [...] The original request from his mother is [...] "six farm eggs, a cake for tea, a pound of pears, and don't forget the bacon." [...] Along with the dog, he is accompanied on his trip by a butterfly. In order to avoid forgetting items, the boy recites his mother's list to himself. Throughout his trip to the store, the boy sees items along the way that play tricks with his memory, and items on his list one-by-one become substituted with other goods. [...] "Six farm eggs" [...] initially becomes [...] "Six fat legs" [...] then [...] "Six clothes pegs", and [...] "A cake for tea" [...] initially becomes [...] "A cape for me" [...] then [...] "A rake for leaves", and [...] "A pound of pears" [...] initially becomes [...] "A flight of stairs" [...] then [...] "A pile of chairs". By the end of his trip, the boy has forgotten the initial items requested, and supplants them in his mind with [...] "Six clothes pegs, a rake for leaves, a pile of chairs, and don't forget the bacon". Then he goes to the junk shop and says to a merchant there, [...] "Six clothes pegs, a rake for leaves, and a pile of chairs please!". The merchant in the junk shop assists the boy in compiling to this odd list. While travelling back to his home, he remembers the original items and corrects his mistakes. Then on the way home, he says to himself, [...] "Six farm eggs, a cake for tea, and a pound of pears". However, he still forgets to acquire bacon when he gets home. And finally, he says, [...] "I FORGOT THE BACON!". Finally, the final panel depicts the child carrying a basket and a coin purse, taking his dog attached to a leash, and do an en route; probably to purchase the bacon which he forgot.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the film}} Razieh, a strong-willed {{little girl in}} Tehran, wants to buy a lucky {{goldfish}} for the upcoming Iranian New Year celebration, but struggles to get and {{hold on to the}} 500-toman banknote needed to purchase the fish. Panahi worked closely with Mohammadkhani, gaining her trust and acting out each scene for her to mimic while still adding her own personality to the performance. Panahi was most concerned about Mohammadkhani being able to cry on cue, so he would have her stare at him off camera while he started to cry, causing her to cry. Filming began in early April 1994 in Kashan, Iran and continued until early June. Panahi has stated that during the making of his feature debut he [...] "wanted to prove to myself that I can do the job, that I can finish a feature film successfully and get good acting out of my players." [...] He also stated that [...] "In a world where films are made with millions of dollars, we made a film <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> girl who wants to buy a fish for less than a dollar – this is what we’re trying to show." [...] In Iran, films depicting children are the most likely to avoid censorship or political controversy, and The White Balloon was screened exclusively in theatres that specialized in children's films. Because of this the film had low attendance on its initial run in Iranian theatres, with only 130,000 tickets sold.|$|E
