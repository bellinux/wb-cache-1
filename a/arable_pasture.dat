40|$|Diffuse {{phosphorus}} (P) export from {{agricultural land}} to surface waters {{is a significant}} environmental problem. It is critical to determine the natural background P losses from diffuse sources, but their identification and quantification is difficult. In this study, three headwater catchments with differing land use (<b>arable,</b> <b>pasture</b> and forest) were monitored for 3 years to quantify exports of dissolved (< 0. 45 μm) reactive P and total dissolved P. Mean total P exports from the arable catchment ranged between 0. 08 and 0. 28 kg ha− 1 year− 1. Compared with the reference condition (forest), arable land and pasture exported up to 11 -fold more dissolved P. The contribution of dissolved (< 0. 45 μm) unreactive P was low to negligible in every catchment. Agricultural practices can exert large pressures on surface waters that are controlled by hydrological factors. Adapting policy to cope with these factors is needed for lowering these pressures in the future. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Important {{steps in}} {{developing}} reliable bioindicators for soil quality are characterising soil biodiversity and determining {{the response of}} its components to environmental factors {{across a range of}} land uses and soil types. Baseline data from a national survey in Ireland were used to explore relationships between diversity and composition of micro-organisms (bacteria, fungi, mycorrhiza), and micro-, meso- and macro-fauna (nematodes; mites; earthworms, ants) across a general gradient representing dominant land uses (<b>arable,</b> <b>pasture,</b> rough-grazing, forest and bogland). These diversity data were also linked to soil physico-chemical properties. Differences in diversity and composition of meso- and macro-fauna, but not microbes, were clear between agriculturally-managed (arable and pasture) and extensivelymanaged (rough-grazing and bogland) soils corresponding to a broad division between ‘mineral’ and ‘organic’ soils. The abundance, richness and composition of nematode and earthworm taxa were significantly congruent with a number of the other groups. Further analysis, using significant indicator species from each group, identified potential target taxa and linked them to soil environmental gradients. This study suggests that there is potential surrogacy between the diversity of key soil taxa groups and that different sets of bioindicators may be most effective under agricultural and extensive land use...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{coastal zone}} {{worldwide}} {{is not well}} served by management policies that fail {{to deal effectively with}} land-sourced contaminants from streams, rivers and urban runoff. We discuss this using examples from New Zealand, where there is a wide recognition of such problems but little effective policy that specifically accounts for the interconnectedness of the land-to-freshwater-to-sea domain. Increasing land-use intensification, mostly in <b>arable</b> <b>pasture,</b> has greatly increased the nutrient load to the coast and has contributed to the already high sediment loading of coastal waters. We argue that renewed effort is needed for a more holistic approach to management, encapsulated in the New Zealand Maori concept of ki uta ki tai – an appreciation of mountains-to-sea connections. Limit-setting, especially of nitrogen from terrestrial sources, seems to amainway forward for reducing loads and halting cumulative effects. However, this must account for current impacts and also the ‘load to come ’ because of time lags associated with accumulated groundwater nutrients and cumulative impacts in receiving waters. Despite many approaches being tried, there are increasing impacts of catchment activities on coasts worldwide. The need is therefore great for new approaches, renewed effort, and for a very long-term perspective to ensure effective and enduring solutions...|$|E
40|$|Accurate {{estimation}} of the greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation potential of bioenergy crops requires the integration of a significant component of spatially varying information. In particular, crop yield and soil carbon (C) stocks are variables which are generally soil type and climate dependent. Since gaseous emissions from soil C depend on current C stocks, which in turn are related to previous land management {{it is important to}} consider both previous and proposed future land use in any C accounting assessment. We have conducted a spatially explicit study for England and Wales, coupling empirical yield maps with the RothC soil C turnover model to simulate soil C dynamics. We estimate soil C changes under proposed planting of four bioenergy crops, Miscanthus (Miscanthus×giganteus), short rotation coppice (SRC) poplar (Populus trichocarpa Torr. & Gray ×P. trichocarpa, var. Trichobel), winter wheat, and oilseed rape. This is then related to the former land use – <b>arable,</b> <b>pasture,</b> or forest/seminatural, and the outputs are then assessed in the context of a life cycle analysis (LCA) for each crop. By offsetting emissions from management under the previous land use, and considering fossil fuel C displaced, the GHG balance is estimated for each of the 12 land use change transitions associated with replacing arable, grassland, or forest/seminatural land, with each of the four bioenergy crops. Miscanthus and SRC are likely to have a mostly beneficial impact in reducing GHG emissions, while oilseed rape and winter wheat have either a net GHG cost, or only a marginal benefit. Previous land use is important and can make the difference between the bioenergy crop being beneficial or worse than the existing land use in terms of GHG balance...|$|E
40|$|Background: Agriculture and {{agricultural}} intensification can have significant negative {{impacts on the}} environment, including nutrient and pesticide leaching, spreading of pathogens, soil erosion and reduction of ecosystem services provided by terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity. The establishment and management of vegetated strips adjacent to farmed fields (including various field margins, buffer strips and hedgerows) are key mitigation measures for these negative environmental impacts and environmental managers and other stakeholders must often make decisions {{about how best to}} design and implement vegetated strips for a variety of different outcomes. However, {{it may be difficult to}} obtain relevant, accurate and summarised information on the effects of implementation and management of vegetated strips, even though a vast body of evidence exists on multipurpose vegetated strip interventions within and around fields. To improve the situation, we describe a method for assembling a database of relevant research relating to vegetated strips undertaken in boreo-temperate farming systems (<b>arable,</b> <b>pasture,</b> horticulture, orchards and viticulture). Methods: We will search 13 bibliographic databases, 1 search engine and 37 websites for stakeholder organisations using a predefined and tested search string that focuses on a comprehensive list of vegetated strip synonyms. Non-English language searches in Danish, Finnish, German, Spanish, and Swedish will also be undertaken using a web-based search engine. We will screen search results at title, abstract and full text levels, recording the number of studies deemed non-relevant (with reasons at full text). A systematic map database that displays the meta-data (i. e. descriptive summary information about settings and methods) of relevant studies will be produced following full text assessment. The systematic map database will be displayed as a web-based geographical information system (GIS). The nature and extent of the evidence base will be discussed...|$|E

40|$|In 2010 a {{computer-based}} 'predictive model' {{of early}} medieval settlement location was {{developed as a}} way of addressing the difficulties of identifying early medieval secular settlements in Wales (Seaman 2010). The model, which focused on a 100 km 2 area in the eastern Vale of Glamorgan, aimed to identify 'core settlement zones' where prospection techniques, such as geophysics, could be most profitably targeted. Initial analysis suggested that the model could also have applications for exploring patterns of historic land-use. The aims of this project were to make the results of the model freely available, and to use field-names and patterns of agricultural land-use recorded in nineteenth century Tithe surveys as proxy-data with which to explore its applicability. Field-names have long been acknowledged as vital sources by landscape historians, but archaeology has been slow to draw upon their evidence, particularly in Wales where, given the lack of alternative sources, their potential as indicators of archaeological features is perhaps greatest. Mapping of nineteenth century agricultural land-use information also provides a valuable data-set through which the organisation of agrarian resources within a landscape can be explored. The project was funded by the British Academy/Leverhulme Small Research Grant scheme. This collection includes the results of the predictive model and a fully georeferenced database of field-names and land-use information derived from twelve Tithe surveys. The data pertains to a 90 km 2 area in the eastern Vale of Glamorgan. The results of the predictive model consist of a network of 'settlement zones' labelled 1 to 4 in descending order of their likelihood of containing evidence for early medieval domestic settlement (1 most likely, 4 least likely; see Seaman 2010 for detailed discussion of the methodology of the model). The database of field-names and land-use information is derived from information held within Tithe survey apportionments (dating to between 1838 and 1841) for twelve parishes within the study area. Two further parishes, Porthkerry and Barry, were excluded because their Tithe apportionments included neither field-names nor land-use information, and Highlight (a part of Wenvoe parish) was not included as its field boundaries were not recorded on the Tithe survey plans. A total of 4609 entries listing the name and/or state of cultivation of fields were transcribed from the apportionments and geocoded the British National Grid via a network of field-boundaries based upon the First Edition Ordnance Survey 6 inch 1 to a mile maps. Changes to a small number of field boundaries between the dates of the Tithe surveys and the Ordnance Survey maps meant that some fields could only be reconstructed to their approximate original proportions, but individual errors are unlikely to be greater than 10 meters. There were also inconsistencies in the amount information provided in the Tithe apportionments, and whilst both field-names and state of cultivation information was provided for 1212 fields, 930 fields had only field-names, and 2467 fields had only entries for the state of cultivation. The names of settlements, houses, farms and associated structures have not been included in the database. Where possible the state of cultivation information and field-names has been used to assign individual fields to one of six agricultural land-use categories: <b>arable,</b> <b>pasture,</b> meadow, mud flat, wood or orchard. A system of coding is used to indicate where field-names provide evidence for features of potential archaeological significance within or near to a particular field, or where contradictions between the state of cultivation and field-name indicate a change in land-use...|$|E
