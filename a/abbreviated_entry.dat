This listing {{continues}} until 1838. That is the last mention of the vessel. After 1838, Lloyd's Register only carried vessels that had been surveyed.|$|E
5000|$|The search {{capability}} {{itself is}} fairly similar to Windows Me and Windows 2000, with some important additions. The Indexing Service can extract Exif properties, {{as well as}} some metadata for ASF, WMV and MP3 files under Windows XP via the IPropertyStorage interface using built-in Null Filter. Search can also be instructed to search only files that are categorically “Documents” or “Pictures, music and video" [...] (searching by perceived type); this feature is noteworthy largely because of how Windows determines what types of files can be classified under these categories. Another important addition is that the [...] "Look in" [...] field accepts and expands environment variables for <b>abbreviated</b> <b>entry</b> of long paths. Also, users can configure whether or not Windows XP searches for system and/or hidden files and folders. Using Tweak UI, the search user interface can be restored to the one used by Windows 2000.|$|E
40|$|PL/CS is an {{instructional}} dialect of PL/I. It {{is defined by}} selection features of PL/I, and then restricting {{the manner in which}} those features can be used. The implementation is an error-repairing compiler based on PL/C, in which error-repair is carried to the point where a user is deliberately encouraged to use an <b>abbreviated</b> <b>entry</b> syntax and rely on the compiler to expand this to produce a complete, PL/I-compatible program. PL/CS also includes an "assertion" facility that can be used either as a conventional diagnostic tool, or as the basis of a formal proof of correctness in a logical system provided within the language...|$|E

2500|$|In {{reference}} to the coded notations within the actual torture logs, Berdella confessed {{that many of the}} <b>abbreviated</b> <b>entries</b> were simply shorthand terms for methods of abuse he had inflicted upon his victims, whereas others would describe either their reactions to these ongoing acts of abuse and torture, or his initial observations upon viewing them when he entered the room where he had kept them restrained. The entry reading [...] "CP", for example, had referred to the injections of chlorpromazine he had injected into his victims to assist in his restraining them, whereas entries reading [...] "DC" [...] would refer to the swabbing of their eyes with drain cleaner or the injection of the substance into their vocal cords. Entries reading [...] "EK" [...] or [...] "EKG" [...] had referred to the method of torture administered to his captives with electrical shots, whereas several other entries would also read the location Berdella had administered the abuse or torture to his victims. For example, at one point in relation to victim Walter James Ferris, Berdella had written an entry reading: [...] "2 1/2 ket nk + shoulder" [...] to indicate he had injected 2.2 cubic centimeters of ketamine into his victim's neck and shoulder. Other entries such as [...] "gag loose, no resist in retie" [...] or [...] "very delayed breathing, snoring" [...] were more self-explanatory. (Investigators had consulted a specialist in toxicology in their investigation into Berdella following his arrest. This individual had stated that, judging by the notes he had written upon victim Robert Sheldon, the accumulation of chlorpromazine injected into this victim had been toxic.) ...|$|R
5000|$|A benign impredicative definition: Suppose {{the local}} {{librarian}} wants to catalog (index) her collection {{into a single}} book (call it Ι for [...] "index"). Her index must list ALL the books and their locations in the library. As it turns out, {{there are only three}} books, and these have titles Ά, β, and Γ. To form her index-book I, she goes out and buys a book of 200 blank pages and labels it [...] "I". Now she has four books: I, Ά, β, and Γ. Her task is not difficult.
