25|$|Maxwell {{approached}} her agent for ideas. The agent {{suggested that she}} look into thrillers, romance novels and horror fiction, as all three were becoming very popular. After reading several horror novels, Maxwell realized {{that she would not}} enjoy writing that type of fiction. Her husband brought her five Silhouette novels, three of which were for a brand-new line, Sihouette Desire. Although Maxwell thought the novels were well written, she did not really enjoy the first four stories. The last one that she read, Corporate Affair by Stephanie James (a.k.a. Jayne Ann Krentz) made her {{fall in love with the}} genre. Because she had never read romance novels before, Maxwell picked up over fifty <b>additional</b> <b>category</b> romances to familiarize herself with the expected format and then set out to write her own romance. The resulting novel, Summer Thunder, published in 1982, was the debut of her romance career. This novel, and the more than thirty that have followed, are published under the pseudonym Elizabeth Lowell, a combination of Ann's middle name (Elizabeth) and Evan's middle name (Lowell), even though the books are written solely by Ann.|$|E
500|$|In 1961, however, {{formal rules}} were set down for which {{categories}} would be awarded, which {{could only be}} changed by the World Science Fiction Society membership through the annual Business Meeting. Despite this, the 1964 convention awarded a Hugo Award for the Best SF Book Publisher, which was not on that list. Immediately afterward the guidelines were changed to allow individual conventions to create additional categories, which was codified as up to two categories for that year. These additional awards were officially designated as Hugo Awards, but {{were not required to}} be repeated by future conventions. This was later adjusted to only allow one <b>additional</b> <b>category.</b> The Best SF Book Publisher award was repeated in 1965, and the Best All-Time Series award was given in 1966. No other additional categories were added by 1974, when the guidelines were changed again to allow up to ten categories which would be chosen by each convention, though they were expected to be similar to those presented in the year before. Despite this change no new awards were added or previous awards removed before the guidelines were changed back to listing specific categories.|$|E

2500|$|The Kinsey {{scale is}} used to measure a person's overall balance of {{heterosexuality}} and homosexuality, and takes into account both sexual experience and psychosexual reactions. The scale ranges from 0 to 6, with 0 being completely heterosexual and 6 completely homosexual. An <b>additional</b> <b>category,</b> X, was mentioned to describe those who had [...] "no socio-sexual contacts or reactions," [...] which has been cited by scholars to mean asexuality.

2500|$|An <b>additional</b> <b>category</b> of anti-reflection {{coatings}} is {{the so-called}} [...] "absorbing ARC". These coatings are useful in situations where high transmission through a surface is unimportant or undesirable, but low reflectivity is required. They can produce very low reflectance with few layers, and can often be produced more cheaply, or at greater scale, than standard non-absorbing AR coatings. (See, for example, [...]) Absorbing ARCs often make use of unusual optical properties exhibited in compound thin films produced by sputter deposition. For example, titanium nitride and niobium nitride are used in absorbing ARCs. These {{can be useful in}} applications requiring contrast enhancement or as a replacement for tinted glass (for example, in a CRT display).|$|E
