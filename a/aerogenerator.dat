40|$|The {{choice of}} a wind turbine for a given site is a very {{significant}} operation. It is advised to make an in-depth study {{on the characteristics of}} the <b>aerogenerator</b> and the implantation site before any installation of a wind farm for choosing well the system best adapted to the energy needs. The objective {{of this study is to}} sensitize the users of the wind energy on the various problems involved in the <b>aerogenerator</b> installation on any site and to provide a decision-making aid to the judicious choice of the wind system best adapted. The idea is to estimate, for a selected implantation site, the energy production and the operating time of several wind systems. We can thus select the <b>aerogenerator</b> best adapted by mak ing a compromise between a maximum recovery of energy and a high time of production. The influence height of the <b>aerogenerator</b> on energy profitability is also studied. We apply this step to the twenty six Tunisian synoptic sites by im plantation scenarios of seven wind systems of various nominal speeds in function of the height. </p...|$|E

These project solutions aim at mitigating the visual impact caused by the wind <b>aerogenerators.</b> Besides the usual location of the wind <b>aerogenerators</b> on the skyline, these alternatives within the project design relate to the placement of wind turbines in the middle and {{at the bottom of the}} hillside. Other possible mitigation forms relate to the dimensions and the colour of the wind towers.

40|$|Wind-hydrogen {{systems for}} remote area power supply are an early niche {{application}} of sustainable hydrogen energy. Optimal direct coupling between a wind turbine and an electrolyser stack {{is essential for}} maximum electrical energy transfer and hydrogen production. In addition, system costs need to be minimised if wind-hydrogen systems are to become competitive. This paper investigates achieving near maximum power transfer between a fixed pitched variable-speed wind turbine and a Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) electrolyser {{without the need for}} intervening voltage converters and maximum power point tracking electronics. The approach investigated involves direct coupling of the <b>aerogenerator</b> with suitably configured generator coils to an optimal series-parallel configuration of PEM electrolyser cells so that the I-V characteristics of both the <b>aerogenerator</b> and electrolyser stack are closely matched for maximum power transfer. A procedure for finding these optimal configurations and hence maximising hydrogen production from the system is described. For the case of an Air 403 400 W <b>aerogenerator</b> located at a typical coastal site in south-eastern Australia and directly coupled to an optimally configured 400 W stack of PEM electrolysers, it is estimated that up to 95 % of the maximum achievable energy can be transferred to the electrolyser over an annual period. The results of an extended experiment to test this theoretical prediction for an actual Air 403 <b>aerogenerator</b> are reported. The implications of optimal coupling between a PEM electrolyser and an <b>aerogenerator</b> for the performance and overall economics of wind-energy hydrogen systems for RAPS applications are discussed...|$|E
40|$|AbstractRenewable energy {{resources}} exist in nature in a non fossil state. Sun radiation and wind are inexhaustible {{since they are}} both renewable. Installing photovoltaic systems connected to the network becomes economically interesting. Actual efficiency of photovoltaic cells is still fair. The production of energy can only be done during day time while the demand is maximal on night time. The wind energy is the electrical energy produced from the wind by an <b>aerogenerator</b> that uses the kinetic of wind. This energy is renewable and will not vanish soon. A DC converter {{is connected to the}} <b>aerogenerator,</b> it will be charging a group of batteries in order to store and produce electrical energy. The produced wind- power remains constant when the turbine speed varies but slightly goes down after a certain speed limit. Combining the two sources of renewable energy will lead to a maximum efficiency in electrical energy production.

40|$|Horizontal axis wind {{turbines}} {{have a number}} of limitations for offshore operations, particularly in deep water (i. e. over 50 m). For example, scalability restrictions, the necessity for high lift installations offshore requiring specialist vessels, high gravitational and aerodynamic moments on the support structure and a need to maintain rotary equipment at heights typically over 60 – 80 m. Conversely, vertical axis {{wind turbines}} have several inherent attributes that offer some advantages for offshore operations, particularly their scalability and low over-turning moments with better accessibility to drivetrain components. This paper describes the aerodynamic optimisation of a novel 10 MW vertical axis wind turbine rotor shape offering a low-stress design to minimise manufacturing and maintenance costs of the whole turbine assembly including the supporting structure and foundations. The <b>Aerogenerator</b> vertical axis wind turbine is self-supporting so does not require a supporting tower, giving a low centre of gravity and producing significantly lower aerodynamic over-turning moments than conventional vertical axis wind turbines or horizontal axis wind turbines, making it a credible option for a floating, deep water platform. A numerical optimisation procedure is described to minimise the <b>Aerogenerator</b> weight while imposing aerodynamic, mechanical and structural side constraints. The study proposes a novel ‘sycamore’-shaped rotor design that demonstrates a lower cost of energy compared with conventional offshore turbines...|$|E

40|$|Monitoring {{wind energy}} {{production}} is fundamental to improve the performances of a wind farm during the operational phase. In order to perform reliable operational analysis, data mining of all available information spreading out from turbine control systems is required. In this work a SCADA (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition) data analysis was performed on a small wind farm and new post-processing methods are proposed for condition monitoring of the <b>aerogenerators.</b> Indicators are defined to detect the malfunctioning of a wind turbine and to select meaningful data to investigate {{the causes of the}} anomalous behaviour of a turbine. The operating state database is used to collect information about the proper power production of a wind turbine and a number map has been codified for converting the performance analysis problem into a purely numerical one. Statistical analysis on the number map clearly helps in detecting operational anomalies, providing diagnosis for their reasons. The most operationally stressed turbines are systematically detected through the proposal of two Malfunctioning Indices. Results demonstrate that a proper selection of the SCADA data can be very useful to measure the real performances of a wind farm and thus to define optimal repair/replacement and preventive maintenance policies that {{play a major role in}} case of energy production...|$|R
40|$|The {{value of}} wind power as firm {{capacity}} in an electricity grid without storage is investigated, primarily {{by means of}} a numerical probabilistic model. The magnitude of wind power capacity credit is usually found to be greater than 40 percent of the capacity credit of a typical conventional unit with the same average power output. For very small values of wind power penetration into the grid, the two measures of capacity credit utilised are each approximately equal to the average wind power, while for large penetrations the measures approach different constant values. The behaviour at both limits is in good agreement with the results of an analytic probabilistic model. The results are also compared with those from an hour by hour computer simulation. It is found that wind power capacity credit is very sensitive to the penetration of wind power into the grid, to the unit sizes of the conventional plant in the grid and to the start up speed of the <b>aerogenerators.</b> The credit is moderately sensitive to the replacement of the load distribution by a Gaussian distribution, to the forced outage rate of conventional plant, to the wind speed distribution and to the magnitude of the loss of load probability in the absence of wind power plant. The credit is found to be insensitive to the rated speed of the aero generators (given the same average wind power output) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{installed}} capacity of European Offshore Wind Turbines (OWT) {{is likely to}} rise from the 2014 value of 7 GW to 150 GW in 2030. However maintenance of OWT is facing unprecedented challenges and cost 35 % of lifetime costs. This will be equivalent to £ 14 billion/year by 2030 if current OWT maintenance schemes are not changed. However the complexities around OWT operation require tools and systems to optimise OWT maintenance. The design of optimal OWT maintenance requires failure analysis of over 10, 000 components in OWT for which there is little published work relating to performance and failure. In this work, inspection reports of over 400 wind turbine gearboxes (source: Stork Technical Services) and SCADA data (source: Shetland <b>Aerogenerators</b> Ltd) were studied to identify issues with performance and failures in wind turbines. A modified framework of Failure Mode Effects and Criticality Analysis (i. e. FMECA+) was designed to analyse failures according to the unique requirements of OWT maintenance planners. The FMECA+ framework enables analysis and prediction of failures for varied root causes, and determines their consequences over short and long periods of time. A software tool has been developed around FMECA+ framework that enables prediction of component level failures for varied root causes. The tool currently stores over 800 such instances. The need to develop a FMECA+ based Enterprise Resource Planning tool has been identified and preliminary results obtained from its development have been shown. Such a software package will routinely manage OWT data, predict failures in components, manage resources and plan an optimal maintenance. This will solve some big problems that OWT maintenance planners currently face. This will also support the use of SCADA and condition monitoring data in planning OWT maintenance, something which has been difficult to manage for a long time. Robert Gordon University.

40|$|Freezing {{precipitation}} has {{extremely high}} incidence {{in parts of}} Atlantic Canada and this condition is expected to severely reduce the energy output from <b>aerogenerators.</b> This project was aimed at the evaluation of effects of freezing precipitation conditions on the output of wind turbine generators. Major achievements have included the simulation of freezing rain events, in particular, glaze icing in a cold room and in field applications; testing of a NASA LS(1) - 0417 wing section in the wind tunnel under simulated icing conditions; and theoretical evaluation of performance degradation by icing on blades for two horizontal axis wind turbines, that is, a 2. 5 m diameter wind turbine and a Carter- 23 wind turbine, by using lifting-line theory. [...] An experiment to model the form of ice accumulation on a horizontal axis rotor was done in a cold room. Ice profiles on the blade sections were recorded. Wind tunnel tests for an airfoil used typically for wind turbine blades were done with various simulated glaze and rime ice accretions attached to {{the leading edge of}} the airfoil. Lift and drag coefficient data were obtained for angles of attack from - 6 ° to 90 °. A theoretical method was used for estimation of degradation of aerodynamic performance of horizontal axis wind turbines in icing conditions. The theory used was based on marine-propeller lifting line theory that had been adapted for wind turbine use. This made use of airfoil section data obtained from wind tunnel tests. A simulated icing test on a full scale horizontal axis wind turbine was performed at the Atlantic Wind Test Site. [...] The cold room icing test gave a better understanding of the blunt shaped glaze ice accretion on the leading edge of blade sections where the wind speed was relatively high. The theoretical estimations showed that icing events, associated with ambient temperatures close to freezing point and high liquid water content in the air, could destroy the performance of wind turbines completely. The wind turbine field test showed that a progressive power reduction occurred during a simulated freezing event and a complete loss of power from the wind turbine generator was encountered after a short time period of freezing precipitation. The wind tunnel tests for the airfoil with simulated ice accretions on the leading edge revealed that increase of drag coefficient and decrease of lift coefficient on the iced blade sections of a wind turbine were the main reasons that caused the power output from a wind turbine to drop...|$|R
