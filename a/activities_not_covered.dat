ERC has commented separately on the tax policy, and the present comments should be read together with those comments. The finding that carbon offset projects can generate significant local sustainable development benefits (p. 16) should be treated with caution.

40|$|In 2001 the Japanese Ministry for Education, Sport, Culture and Technology (MEXT) {{put forward}} the 'Education Reform Plan for the 21 st Century' or {{as it was}} {{labelled}} 'The Rainbow Plan'. The 'Rainbow Plan' comprised seven priority strategies to achieve this reform. These strategies included the encouragement of cultural and sports club activities and the improvement of moral and social education. MEXT goes on to add that social education is 'a general term for organised educational <b>activities</b> <b>not</b> <b>covered</b> in the regular curricula of elementary schools, secondary schools and institutions of higher education'. This educational reform {{is a response to}} the belief that younger generations in Japan have little 'understanding or experience of traditional Japanese spirituality' and have become 'accustomed to a more international and materialistic lifestyle' (Yasumura, 1998 : 81). The delivery of modern education and the educational institutions from which it is delivered are sites par excellence for the reproduction of culture, which, through the inevitable pedagogy imbedded in 'the school', are responsible for the appropriate socialisation of students (Bourdieu & Passeron, 1977; Bourdieu, 1990).

40|$|The {{concept has}} its origin in American {{sociology}} where it designates the parallel system of workers organizations and wage negotiations which developed alongside employers or workers unions in industrialized countries. In developing countries, {{it applies to}} a wide-range of <b>activities</b> <b>not</b> <b>covered</b> by classical socio-economic indicators, resulting from the implementation of development policies based on production and import consumption models in developed countries. In Africa, in particular, the analysis of national development plans from independence {{till the end of}} the 1960 s has shown that employment itself was not considered as an objective. Owing to the severe shortage of skilled manpower and executives during that time, it was believed that the public service and the new industries could automatically absorb all the graduates from the training centers, universities and the labour force from the agricultural sector. However, the development policies applied aimed firstly at increasing the productivity of the cash-crop farming sector and the supply of cheap industrial labour with a view to an accelerated accumulation of capital. Nevertheless, {{since the beginning of the}} 1970 s, the economic growth, though rapid, appears to be accompanied by employment stagnation in the modern sectors of the African economies. It was, therefore, noticed that the rural exodus accelerated by the agricultural policies applied was partly responsible for transforming the rural unemployed people into urban unemployed people, whom the industries could not absorb...|$|E

40|$|Hedge fund {{performance}} and risk measurement continues to present intriguing challenges to both academics and practitioners. In recent months these challenges {{have become more}} visible {{in the light of}} losses at Amaranth Advisors. One of the main reasons why {{performance and}} risk measures fail to adequately expose certain risks in hedge funds is the uniqueness of hedge fund strategies and related operational issues in executing these strategies. In this article we will first examine the risk exposures and performance characteristics of a large sample of live and dead hedge funds, and then turn our attention to four recent hedge fund failures. All four of these funds were subject to enforcement proceedings by the SEC and/or CFTC and the major reason for failure was fraud. Using a variety of risk measures we will explore whether key risk exposures may be used to differentiate between active and dead funds. We show that a “monitoring test ” could be used to determine if a hedge fund manager has changed his/her trading strategy significantly, which may be a signal that the manager is engaged in trading <b>activities</b> <b>not</b> <b>covered</b> by fund’s investment mandate. Our results indicate that careful qualitative and quantitative due diligence would have uncovered some abnormal return patterns in the four failed funds. In fact, in one case several investors decided not to invest after careful qualitative due diligence. We conclude that both qualitative and quantitative due diligence are equally important in successfully monitoring hedge funds risk exposures. ...|$|E
40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "In 1995, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) {{and the state of}} Idaho signed an agreement to clean up a mining area known as Bunker Hill. The agreement estimated that the total cost of the cleanup would be $ 126 million, with the state's share capped at $ 12. 6 million. This correspondence focuses on (1) EPA's actual expenditures for cleanup activities and how these expenditures differ from the estimate set forth in the agreement and (2) the reasons for any major differences between actual and estimated cleanup expenditures. As of September 30, 2000, EPA had spent about $ 212 million on various cleanup and management support activities within the Bunker Hill Superfund site. About $ 101 million of the expenditures was for cleanup-related <b>activities</b> <b>not</b> <b>covered</b> by the EPA/state agreement and therefore not included in the 1995 cost estimate. These activities included the study and design of cleanup activities, emergency removals of contaminated materials, enforcement of responsible party cleanup activities, and indirect management support. The remaining $ 111 million was used for cleanup work covered by this agreement. EPA and the state of Idaho expect that the cleanup work covered by the agreement will be completed by about the end of 2002 at a projected final cost of about $ 140 million. EPA also expects that the agreement will be modified to cover the future costs of improving the site's existing water treatment plant, estimated to range from $ 16 million to $ 33 million. For situations in which contractors were hired to do the cleanup work, the projected final costs range from $ 4. 7 million less to $ 6. 1 million more than the amounts originally estimated. The $ 4. 7 million cost savings occurred as a result of improved contractor performance in response to contractual incentives. Cost increases resulted primarily from (1) higher-than-anticipated quantities of contaminated materials requiring removal, (2) greater handling of materials to dry them before disposal, and (3) floods that recontaminated areas that had already been cleaned. ...|$|E

Many researches have been done to reveal the extent of underreporting, factors that lead for underreporting and the coverage of occupations by occupational safety legislation in various countries. This study is focused to find the effectiveness of accident reporting system in Sri Lanka, to study the coverage of occupations by the current law and to propose strategies for improving the accident reporting system. Data for the research were of both primary type and secondary type where secondary data were extracted from the records available at the office of the commissioner for workmen’s compensation and primary data were obtained through expert interviews. Accidents reported to the commissioner for workmen’s compensation during one year period were compared with the accidents reported to department of labour during the same period for estimating the rate of underreporting. Also, the identification of economic <b>activities</b> that are <b>not</b> <b>covered</b> by the current legislation with regard to occupational safety and health could be identified through the data obtained from the office of the commissioner for workmen’s compensation.

We analyze the distribution of the solar wind velocity for each geomagnetic class of activity and find that: 1) Within each activity type aa does not depend on V, 2) Approximately 80 % of the solar wind has V 450 km/s for RA, 3) SA and UA both have 60 % of the solar wind V > 450 km/s. We found the following conditions for all four solar cycles: 1) For QA 95 % of solar wind speeds are in the range 399 ± 69 km/s, 2) For RA 95 % of the solar wind speeds range from 582 ± 110 km/s, 3) For SA 95 % of the solar wind velocities are order of 482 ± 101. 4 km/s, and 4) For UA 95 % of solar wind speeds are 480 ± 85. 82 km/s. These results confirm the classification scheme that QA reflects slow wind effects, RA effects high wind stream and UA answers to the fluctuations between high wind stream (~ 60 %) and slow wind (~ 40 %).
