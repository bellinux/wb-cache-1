40|$|The use of <b>actual</b> <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> {{distributions}} {{instead of}} summary statistics, such as equivalent single-axle loads (ESALs), in the forthcoming Mechanistic-Empirical (M-E) Pavement Design Guide {{will allow the}} assessment of the consequences of specific loading configurations on pavement performance. For example, the damaging effects of increased axle loads on specific pavement structures, increased tire pressure, or different axle configurations could be assessed. It is expected that the new M-E Guide will significantly influence future pavement design practices in the United States and abroad. The successful application of the new M-E Design Guide will require more detailed traffic data and will place an increased demand on weigh-in-motion (WIM) systems in Texas and probably other states in the U.

40|$|A Dissertation {{submitted}} to the Department of Civil Engineering for the Degree of Master of Engineering in Highway and Traffic EngineeringThe demands {{for the improvement of}} provincial roads are ever increasing and GOSL has given priority for the uplif ment of rural economy through the improvement of rural road network. Funding agencies have shown interest in providing financial assistance for this task. Road design engineers require reliable traffic data and design specifications for detailed design of provincial roads. One of the basic inputs required for the pavement design is the ESAL values for each vehicle category in each road. The most common method used for the estimation of ESAL values for trucks is the static axle load survey conducted by RDA for national roads. The axle load surveys are rarely done for provincial roads. Different approaches have been adopted for the estimation of truck factors for provincial roads. Lack of institutional arrangements, inadequacy of funds, lack of technical knowledge and equipment are the main reasons for the inability to carry out proper studies in this sector. Currently used axle load survey methods and their errors are being discussed under literature review. A simple but accurate methodology is required for the estimation of axle loads. The main objective is to find out > How to estimate the truck loads from visual observation > Then how this load is distributed among the axles A good vehicle classification system is highly desirable for provincial road network in order to find out ESAL values. The vehicle load can be estimated using first principles. The historical axle load survey data shall be used to derive a relationship for the distribution of vehicle load between axles. Then the results will be used for the estimation of ESAL for a sample road. The analysis of results will be done with probability approach. The results will also be checked and verified for accuracy and reliability. <b>Actual</b> <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> survey data will be used for this verification. A simple yet very effective method for the estimation of truck factors shall be introduced for the provincial roads. Most of the provincial road agencies can use this method to find out ESAL values for the entire road network with the available resources. Further recommendations will be made for further improvements on the methodology to improve the reliability of result. ii...|$|E
40|$|The {{accuracy}} in determined energy consumption and runningtime of trains, {{by means of}} computer simulation, is dependent upon the various models used. This thesis aims at developing validated models of running resistance, train and of a generaldriver, all based on full scale testing. A partly new simple methodology for determining running resistance, called by energy coasting method is developed and demonstrated. An error analysis for this methodis performed. Running resistance of high speed train SJ X 2000, conventional loco hauled passenger trains and freight trains is systematically parameterised. Influence of speed, number of axles, axle load, track type, train length,and train configuration is studied. A model {{taking into account the}} ground boundary layer for determining the influence ofmeasured head and tail wind is developed. Different factors and parameters of a train, that are vital for the {{accuracy in}} computed energy consumption and runningtime are identified, analysed and finally synthesized into a train model. Empirical models of the braking and the traction system, including the energy efficiency, are developed for the electrical locomotive of typeSJ Rc 4, without energy regeneration. Driver behaviour is studied for freight trains and a couple of driving describing parametersare proposed. An empirical model of freight train driver behaviour is developed from fullscale testing and observations. A computer program, a simulator, is developed in Matlabcode, making use of the determined runningresistance and the developed models of train and driver. The simulator calculates the energy consumption and running time ofa single train. Comparisons between simulations and corresponding measurements are made. Finally, the influence of driving on energy consumption and running time is studied and demonstrated in some examples. The main conclusions are that: The method developed for determining running resistanceis quite simple and accurate. It can be used on any train andon any track. The running resistance of tested trains includes some interesting knowledge which is partly believed to be new. Mechanical running resistance is less than proportional to the <b>actual</b> <b>axle</b> <b>load.</b> Air drag increases approximately linearly with train length and the effect of measured head and tail wind on the air drag can be calculated if the groundboundary layer is considered. The developed train model, including running resistance, traction, braking etc. is quite accurate, as verified for the investigated trains. The driver model together with the train model insimulations, is verified against measurements and shows good agreement for energy consumption and running time. It is recommended to use a driver model, when calculating energy consumption and running times for trains. Otherwise, the energy consumption will most likely be over-estimated. This has been demonstrated for Swedish ordinary freighttrains. QC 20100526 NR 2014080...|$|E
40|$|Publicado em "Proceedings of the Eighth International Conference on Maintenance and Rehabilation of Pavements". ISBN 978 - 981 - 11 - 0449 - 7 The road {{pavements}} {{are designed}} to support the expected traffic, mainly the heavy traffic that {{is defined by the}} maximum legal <b>loads</b> for their <b>axles</b> or by the <b>actual</b> <b>axle</b> <b>loads</b> corresponding to a specific load spectrum. These vehicles are considered in the pavement design by converting their effects through the use of truck factors which transform the damage they apply to the pavement to the damage that would be applied by a standard axle. The definition of the truck factors to convert trucks into standard <b>axles</b> or <b>load</b> equivalent factors to convert axles into standard axles is carried out by considering the maximum legal <b>loads</b> for each <b>axle</b> or considering the loads measured in weigh-in-motion systems corresponding to the actual loads. However, there is an important number of vehicles that travel with <b>axle</b> <b>loads</b> above the maximum legal limit. These axles cause significant damage to the pavements that reduces the pavement life and increases the rehabilitation cost. This paper investigates the impact of overloaded vehicles using two weight databases by studying the truck factors for different vehicle cases applied to different pavements. The study concluded that the presence of overloaded vehicles increases pavement damage and life cycle costs compared to the cost of the same vehicles with legal loads. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

40|$|The 2. 7 {{kilometers}} {{double track}} elevated viaducts of Doha metro green line, currently under construction, consist of cast-in-situ and precast segmental simply supported spans ranging from 20 to 35 m and continuous cast-insitu {{two and three}} spans (30 - 57 m), (50 - 51 - 44 m) and (37 - 68 - 37 m) U-trough decks. The non-typical configuration of the continuous span arrangements was imposed to the designer by existing underneath utilities and infrastructures. In order to ensure the passenger comfort and traffic safety by preventing track instability during train operation for this special landmark project, performing a dynamic analysis was vital. The dynamic analysis focuses on the vertical accelerations and vertical displacements as well as lateral frequencies of vibration. All simply supported spans {{as well as the}} continuous spans of the project are considered. The real train of the project composed of 6 vehicles with a total length of 120 m and with <b>actual</b> <b>axle</b> <b>loads</b> (maximum <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> of 160 kN with 4 axles per vehicle) is adopted in the dynamic analysis. The analysis is carried out using both direct time integration of the equation of motion and modal time history analysis for different train speeds ranging from 60 km/hr to the maximum permissible speed along the metro line (160 km/hr) with the maximum operating speed ranging from 100 to 130 km/hr. For each train speed the maximum vertical acceleration and the maximum vertical deflection are monitored using the CSI bridge software and are compared to the allowable values given in EN 1991 - 2 and EN 1990 -Annex 2. According to relevant Euronorm requirements, the vertical accelerations and the vertical deflections were found acceptable for all segments of the elevated viaduct...|$|R
40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis studies the load and loadeffects of traffic loads on railway bridges. The increasedknowledge of the traffic loads, simulated using fieldmeasurements of actual trains, are employed in a reliabilityanalysis in an attempt at upgrading existing railwaybridges. The study utilises data from a weigh-in-motion site whichrecords, for each train, the train speed, the loads from eachaxle and the axle spacings. This data of <b>actual</b> trainconfigurations and <b>axle</b> <b>loads</b> are portrayed as moving forcesand then used in computer simulations of trains crossing twodimensional simply supported bridges at constant speed. Onlysingle track short to medium span bridges are considered in thethesis. The studied load effect is the moment at mid-span. Fromthe computer simulations the moment history at mid-span isobtained. The load effects are analysed by two methods, the first isthe classical extreme value theory where the load effect ismodelled by the family of distributions called the generalisedextreme value distribution (GEV). The other method adopts thepeaks-over-threshold method (POT) where the limiting family ofdistributions for the heights to peaks-over-threshold is theGeneralised Pareto Distribution (GPD). The two models aregenerally {{found to be a}} good representation of the data. The load effects modelled by either the GEV or the GPD arethen incorporated into a reliability analysis in order to studythe possibility of raising allowable <b>axle</b> <b>loads</b> on existingSwedish railway bridges. The results of the reliabilityanalysis show that they are sensitive to the estimation of theshape parameter of the GEV or the GPD. While the study is limited to the case of the ultimate limitstate where the effects of fatigue are not accounted for, thefindings show that for the studied cases an increase inallowable <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> to 25 tonnes would be acceptable even forbridges built to the standards of 1940 and designed to LoadModel A of that standard. Even an increase to both 27. 5 and 30 tonnes appears to be possible for certain cases.

In the U.S. weight restrictions are generally 20,000 lb on a single axle, and 34,000 lb (less than two single axles) on a tandem.

40|$|A new {{identification}} {{methodology for}} dynamic <b>axle</b> <b>loads</b> using the superposition principle and influence surface concept was {{proposed in the}} companion paper, in which the effects of {{various factors such as}} bridge inertia force, measurement station, vehicle speed, traveling route, number of vehicles, road surface condition, and noise level were investigated through numerical simulations. In this study the proposed methodology is applied to identify the <b>axle</b> <b>loads</b> of a test truck traveling across an existing bridge. The <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> time-histories are obtained and compared to the static <b>axle</b> <b>loads</b> of the test truck.

30|$|The {{weight of}} the vehicle {{is one of the}} {{parameters}} that can affect the response of the bridge directly. Especially when the load is dynamic, the response can be amplified with respect to static loads. Three different truck loads were employed to examine this parameter; partially (83 %) loaded HS 15 - 44 truck (SP- 17), fully loaded H 15 - 44 truck (SP- 0), and fully loaded HS 20 - 44 truck (SP- 14). SP- 0, SP- 14, and SP- 17 have properties of such weights. All the trucks represent a class-V vehicle (according to AASHTO) with one rear and one front axle. The distance between axles is 14 ft. H 20 - 44 truck has rear <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> of 32  kips and front <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> of 8  kips.

30|$|The SUSTRAIL study (2014) puts a high {{priority}} on {{the improvement of the}} rail system as a whole and emphasises an increase in <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> limits (to 22.5  t / 25  t), depending on different operational scenarios [34]. Some infrastructures, usually ore lines, are designed and maintained for even higher <b>axle</b> <b>loads</b> than those suggested above.
