5|$|According to Skeat {{the note}} in the codex {{indicated}} that the manuscript had not previously been in the Patriarchal Library in <b>Alexandria.</b> The manuscript was carried from Constantinople to <b>Alexandria</b> between 1308 and 1316, together with two mentioned above manuscripts of Chrysostom. It remained in <b>Alexandria</b> until 1621, when Cyril removed it once to Constantinople. Whether was originally written, in Constantinople or in <b>Alexandria,</b> is another question. Skeat {{did not try to}} give the answer on this question ("if any future scholar wisches to claim a Constantinopolitan origin for the Codex Alexandrinus, it is at least open to him to do so"). This view was supported by McKendrick, who proposes Ephesian provenance of the codex.|$|E
5|$|In around 180, Clement reached <b>Alexandria,</b> {{where he}} met Pantaenus, who taught at the Catechetical School of <b>Alexandria.</b> Eusebius {{suggests}} that Pantaenus {{was the head of}} the school, but it is controversial whether the institutions of the school were formalized in this way before the time of Origen. Clement studied under Pantaenus, and was ordained to the priesthood by Pope Julian before 189. Otherwise, virtually nothing is known of Clement's life in <b>Alexandria.</b> He may have been married, a conjecture supported by his writings.|$|E
5|$|The Hellenistic Egyptian city of <b>Alexandria</b> was the stepping-stone for Greek {{anatomy and}} physiology. <b>Alexandria</b> not only housed the biggest library for medical records and {{books of the}} liberal arts in the world {{during the time of}} the Greeks, but was also home to many medical {{practitioners}} and philosophers. Great patronage of the arts and sciences from the Ptolemy rulers helped raise <b>Alexandria</b> up, further rivalling the cultural and scientific achievements of other Greek states.|$|E

5|$|The Mar Saba {{letter was}} {{attributed}} to Clement by Morton Smith, but there remains much debate today over whether it is an authentic letter from Clement, an ancient pseudepigraph or a modern forgery. If authentic, its main significance would be in its relating that the Apostle Mark came to <b>Alexandria</b> from Rome and there wrote a more spiritual Gospel, which he entrusted to the Church in <b>Alexandria</b> on his death; if genuine, the letter pushes back the tradition related by Eusebius connecting Mark with <b>Alexandria</b> by a century.|$|E
5|$|When the {{inhabitants}} of <b>Alexandria</b> heard of Caracalla's claims that he had killed his brother Geta in self-defence, they produced a satire mocking this as well as Caracalla's other pretensions. In 215 Caracalla travelled to <b>Alexandria</b> and responded to this insult by slaughtering the deputation of leading citizens who had unsuspectingly assembled before the city to greet his arrival, before setting his troops against <b>Alexandria</b> for several days of looting and plunder. Following the massacre at <b>Alexandria,</b> Caracalla moved east onto Armenia. By 216 he had pushed through Armenia and south into Parthia.|$|E
5|$|After Theophrastus, though {{interest}} in Aristotle's ideas survived, they were generally taken unquestioningly.

Herophilus also distinguished between veins and arteries, noting that the latter pulse while the former do not.|$|E

5|$|Alexander viewed Bessus as a usurper {{and set out}} {{to defeat}} him. This campaign, {{initially}} against Bessus, turned into a grand tour of central Asia.

The campaign took Alexander through Media, Parthia, Aria (West Afghanistan), Drangiana, Arachosia (South and Central Afghanistan), Bactria (North and Central Afghanistan), and Scythia.|$|E

5|$|Colross, (also {{historically}} {{known as}} Belle Air and Grasshopper Hall), is a Georgian mansion in Princeton, New Jersey; {{it was built}} {{as the center of}} an estate in the Old Town neighborhood of <b>Alexandria,</b> Virginia. Colross is currently the administration building of Princeton Day School. The Colross property originally occupied the entire 1100 block of Oronoco Street; <b>Alexandria</b> merchant John Potts developed it as a plantation and began building the mansion in 17991800. In 1803, Jonathan Swift—also an <b>Alexandria</b> merchant and a city councilman—purchased the property and during his ownership continued constructing the mansion. After Swift's death in 1824, Colross was purcheased by Thomson Francis Mason (1785–1838), son of Thomson Mason (1759–1820) and grandson of Founding Father George Mason (1725–1792) of Gunston Hall. Mason served as a judge of the Criminal Court of the District of Columbia and as mayor of <b>Alexandria.</b> During his ownership, Mason made Colross his chief homestead; he substantially modified and added to the mansion. After successive ownerships, the area around Colross became heavily industrialized. The mansion was bought by John Munn in 1929; between that year and 1932 it was transported brick-by-brick to Princeton, where in 1958 it was sold to Princeton Day School, which uses it as a school administration building housing its admission and advancement offices.|$|E

5|$|Galerius, meanwhile, {{was engaged}} during 291–293 in {{disputes}} in Upper Egypt, where he suppressed a regional uprising. He {{would return to}} Syria in 295 to fight the revanchist Persian empire. Diocletian's attempts to bring the Egyptian tax system in line with Imperial standards stirred discontent, and a revolt swept the region after Galerius' departure. The usurper L. Domitius Domitianus declared himself Augustus in July or August 297. Much of Egypt, including <b>Alexandria,</b> recognized his rule. Diocletian moved into Egypt to suppress him, first putting down rebels in the Thebaid {{in the autumn of}} 297, then moving on to besiege <b>Alexandria.</b> Domitianus died in December 297, by which time Diocletian had secured control of the Egyptian countryside. <b>Alexandria,</b> however, whose defense was organized under Domitianus' former corrector Aurelius Achilleus, was to hold out until a later date, probably March 298.|$|E

It was in <b>Alexandria</b> that Nasser became involved in political activism. After witnessing clashes between protesters and police in Manshia Square, he joined the demonstration without being aware of its purpose.
