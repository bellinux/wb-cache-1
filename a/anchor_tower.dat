5000|$|A {{dead-end}} tower (also <b>anchor</b> <b>tower,</b> anchor pylon) is a fully self-supporting structure used in construction of overhead power lines. A dead-end transmission tower uses horizontal strain insulators {{and where the}} conductors mechanically terminate. Dead-end towers may be used at a substation as a transition to a [...] "slack span" [...] entering the equipment, when the circuit changes to a buried cable, when a transmission line changes direction {{by more than a}} few degrees, or just once in a while to limit the extent of a catastrophic collapse.Since {{dead-end tower}}s require more material and are heavier and costlier than suspension towers, it is uneconomic to build a line with only self-supporting structures.|$|E

40|$|Actual wind {{turbines}} size {{can be as}} large as 80 meters diameter (1 MW and over). Behind the {{wind turbines}}, mean wind speed is sensibly reduced (approximately 50 %) and turbulence severely increased. The spectral density power of disturbed wind can be assumed similar to classical wind but centred on the rotational speed of the motor. Due to classical speed and shape of wind turbine, corresponding key frequency for disturbed wind is close to one Hz. Any structure {{in the vicinity of}} wind turbine can be disturbed by the new wind spectrum created by the turbine, thus existing most of the time for wind speed up to 25 m/s. Cable structure, f. e. overhead lines, have clearly 1 Hz in their first modal shapes. This make them very sensible to buffeting due to the disturbed wind induced by the turbine. Due to continuous excitation, most of the year, fatigue may occur near clamping point and extra damping may be required as well as minimum distance from the wind turbine may be recommended. The <b>anchoring</b> <b>tower</b> (whose first eigenfrequency is generally close to 1 Hz for high voltage lines) will also be affected. This paper will present some simulations of overhead lines disturbances induced by wind turbine in their vicinity. The power spectral density of wind behind the turbine will be deduced from classical spectra of Davenport, but with adaptation due to the rotation of the turbine. Effects on cable will be shown and tentative recommendations of damping as well as clearances from the turbine will be suggested. Peer reviewe...|$|R

50|$|It was {{established}} in World War II as a back-up unit for Rugby Radio Station and took over the latter's traffic {{for a short period}} in 1943 following a fire at Rugby.

This task (and that of Rugby) is now carried out by the Anthorn radio station. Criggion's VLF antenna was hung from three free-standing steel lattice towers at 182.9 m tall, three guyed masts at 213.4 m tall and a rock <b>anchor.</b> The <b>towers</b> and masts were demolished in August 2003 but, although there is now less obvious visible evidence that a large radio station existed on the site, the derelict main transmitting building still survived in 2011 and the foundation sites of the former masts can be still be located on satellite and aerial photographs.|$|R

50|$|The new tower {{features}} a tapered glass façade {{on one side}} which reveals steel bracings, along with a ladder frame to emphasize the vertical appearance of the building. It also appears to <b>anchor</b> the <b>tower</b> to the ground, giving a sense of strength.

The flat side of the building is also encased in glass, and houses the mechanical services - in particular the elevator shafts. These have been turned into an architectural feature in a vein similar to the neighboring Lloyd's building - they deliberately show off the elevator machinery with bright orange painted counterweights and the actual elevator motors themselves.|$|R
