40|$|In this thesis, a new {{approach}} to identify an <b>arcing</b> <b>fault</b> is discussed. The proposed method also can distinguish an <b>arcing</b> <b>fault</b> from normal load behavior. It is the need for increased safety that has been a motivation for this thesis. By using the proposed model, an <b>arcing</b> <b>fault</b> can be easily identified and necessary action can be taken, so as to prevent the arc from escalating into a serious fire and causing a lot of damage. ^ The analysis was divided into two main parts. One model was obtained for DC power systems and another model was obtained for AC power systems. Several methods were tried to obtain a good model that can avoid false tripping. Once the models were obtained, they were tested and very satisfactory results were achieved. The proposed models were able to distinguish arcs from the various types of loads that were used for testing. ...|$|E
40|$|A person’s {{understanding}} of a safety hazard has a dramatic effect {{on his or her}} behavior. An in-depth {{understanding of}} a hazard usually results in a healthy respect for what can happen. People who know the most about a specific hazard tend to rely more heavily on procedures and plans to guide their actions. Personal protective equipment selection and use are influenced by increased {{understanding of a}} hazard. Training and training programs are influenced by the depth of knowledge held by all members of the line organization. Recent work has focused attention on the thermal effects of arc flashes.

40|$|The {{importance}} of short-circuit current evaluation {{for the design}} of any power system, including DC systems, is very well known. Every DC system is subject to faults, in fact, short-circuits and ground faults can be expected at any point. Even if the maximum and minimum values are generally defined with reference to bolted-fault conditions, bolted faults are rare and the fault usually involves arcing and burning (impedance). Therefore, the limiting value of minimum short-circuit depends on the <b>arcing</b> <b>fault.</b> Since an uninterrupted DC <b>arcing</b> <b>fault</b> can cause significant power system equipment and building damage from the fire and smoke that can be produced (i. e., burning cable insulation), it is necessary to: identify critical fault points; estimate the modes and effects of these faults; examine ways in which they can be located; select the best protection methods to isolate the fault; mitigate system damage and outage time; and maintain personal safety. In addition, surveillance and system configuration management programs should be established to prevent the potential for arcing faults to occur. Finally, this paper discusses the extent of damage that can result from a DC <b>arcing</b> <b>fault</b> and recommends system and protection enhancements to significantly limit this damag...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} a novel method based on {{discrete}} wavelet transform and correlation coefficient is presented for distinguishing between <b>arcing</b> and permanent <b>faults.</b> The algorithm includes offline and online processing. In the offline, discrete wavelet transform {{is used to}} decompose typical faulted phase voltage waveforms during <b>arcing</b> <b>faults.</b> An index is then defined and computed. The index {{is based on the}} normalised energy of detail coefficients at resolution levels 1 to 14. The online processing consists of capturing the faulted phase voltage waveform using a 20 kHz sampling rate, and decomposing it by db 4. Finally, <b>arcing</b> <b>faults</b> are distinguished from permanent faults based on correlation coefficient of the computed index of the pre-stored typical <b>arcing</b> <b>faults</b> and a recorded indistinct signal.

40|$|Due to the {{utilization}} of fundamental frequency, current impedance-based fault location methods are able to locate only permanent and linear faults. The duration of the arc in low and medium voltage systems can be as short as {{a quarter of a}} cycle. This period, which is normal for intermittent faults, is insufficient for fundamental frequency-based fault location algorithms. Therefore, available methods are not applicable for intermittent <b>arcing</b> <b>fault</b> location. In this paper, the time-based method previously proposed by the authors has been developed to locate short duration faults in LV distribution systems.

40|$|Abstract — <b>Arcing</b> <b>faults</b> in {{transmission}} {{networks are}} caused when a current carrying conductor makes an unwanted electrical contact with ground or is temporarily short circuited with another current carrying conductor through a high impedance medium. High impedance <b>arcing</b> <b>faults</b> restricts {{the flow of}} current below the detection level of the protective devices and hence cannot be detected by conventional relays. In this paper a new method is proposed {{for the detection of}} <b>arcing</b> <b>faults</b> due to leaning trees in medium voltage (MV) networks. Firstly, an arc model is developed in order to reproduce the fault circumstances. Then based on a fault detection algorithm the fault features are extracted using a signal processing technique called Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). The proposed algorithm is implemented in a simple MV network to identify the faulty phase and in a feeder network to identify both the faulty phase and feeder. Further the results obtained using DWT is validated with the help of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The results obtained above validate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology...|$|R

In order {{to reveal the}} essence of tank deformation or explosion, this paper presents a 3 -D numerical computational tool to simulate the structural dynamic behavior due to overpressure inside transformer tank. To illustrate {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed method, a 17. 3 MJ and a 6. 3 MJ <b>arcing</b> <b>fault</b> were simulated on a real full-scale 360 MVA/ 220 kV oil-immersed transformer model, respectively. By employing the finite element method, the transformer internal overpressure distribution, wave propagation and von-Mises stress were solved. The numerical results indicate that the increase of pressure and mechanical stress distribution are non-uniform and the stress tends to concentrate on connecting parts of the tank as the fault time evolves. Given this feature, it becomes possible {{to reduce the risk of}} transformer tank rupture through limiting the fault energy and enhancing the mechanical strength of the local stress concentrative areas.

40|$|Many {{industrial}} {{power systems}} have been operated with floating neutral or high resistance earthed neutral. In the occurrence of single-phase earth faults, the fault current is usually not more than ten amperes. Traditional earth fault detection schemes based on zero sequence current usually have poor sensitivity in detecting high impedance <b>faults</b> (HIF) and <b>arcing</b> <b>faults.</b> Analysis on negative sequence current caused by earth faults shows that the negative sequence current is slightly bigger than the zero sequence current in the fault feeder.

40|$|Internal arc faults are {{extremely}} rare phenomena {{characterized by a}} powerful non-controlled electric arc due to a dysfunction. Internal arc faults on medium voltage (MV) cells are a focal area where experimental tests are carried out to set the switchgear in conformity with IEC standards [1]. In order to limit the internal arc effects, a new protection filter constituted of a porous medium [2] was recently used providing better performance as compared with traditional filter technologies. The <b>arcing</b> <b>fault</b> process can be chronologically summarized as follows: • An internal arc fault involves a pressure rise in the initially sealed metal enclosure of a medium voltage cell due {{to an increase in}} the temperature and the vaporized mass (plastic and metal vapours). • To avoid explosion of the metal enclosure containing the insulating gas, a safety valve located {{at the bottom of the}} internal metal enclosure bursts when the pressure reaches a critical value. • After the valve has burst, the gas releases and a shock wave is generated: the hot gas flow is ejected towards the buffer area, then it penetrates into the porous filter. • The porous medium's aim is to absorb the shock wave generated at the valve opening and to cool the hot gas flow by heat exchange with the grains composing the protective filter. The final role of the filter is to obtain a gaseous outflow which is not harmful to the equipment and the people located in the MV cell vicinity. In order to simulate the process and to enhance the protection technology, several experimental investigations, and numerical simulation on the <b>arcing</b> <b>fault</b> in a MV cell have been carried out, and are presented in this paper...|$|E

These arcing faults are detected by identifying bursts of each half-cycle of the fundamental current. Bursts occurring at or near a voltage peak indicate arcing on that phase. Once a faulted phase line is identified, {{a comparison of the}} current and voltage reveals whether the fault is located in a downstream direction of power flow toward customers, or upstream toward a generation station. If the fault is located downstream, the line is de-energized, and if located upstream, the line may remain energized to prevent unnecessary power outages...|$|E

40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is the single phase earth fault in medium voltage {{distribution}} networks that are high impedance grounded. Networks are normally radially operated but partially meshed. First, the basic properties of high impedance grounded networks are discussed. Following this, the characteristics of earth faults in distribution networks are determined based on real case recordings. Exploiting these characteristics, new applications for earth fault indication and location are then developed. The characteristics discussed are the clearing of earth <b>faults,</b> arc extinction, <b>arcing</b> <b>faults,</b> fault resistances and transients. <b>Arcing</b> <b>faults</b> made up {{at least half of}} all the disturbances, and they were especially predominant in the unearthed network. In the case of <b>arcing</b> <b>faults,</b> typical fault durations are outlined, and the overvoltages measured in different systems are analysed. In the unearthed systems, the maximum currents that allowed for autoextinction were small. Transients appeared in nearly all fault occurrences that caused the action of the circuit breaker. Fault resistances fell into two major categories, one where the fault resistances were below a few hundred ohms and the other where they were of the order of thousands of ohms. Some faults can evolve gradually, for example faults caused by broken pin insulators, snow burden, downed conductor or tree contact. Using a novel application based on the neutral voltage and residual current analysis with the probabilistic method, it is possible to detect and locate resistive earth faults up to a resistance of 220  kΩ. The main results were also to develop new applications of the transient based differential equation, wavelet and neural network methods for fault distance estimation. The performance of the artificial neural network methods was comparable to that of the conventional algorithms. It was also shown that the neural network, trained by the harmonic components of the neutral voltage transients, is applicable for earth fault distance computation. The benefit of this method is that only one measurement per primary transformer is needed. Regarding only the earth faults with very low fault resistance, the mean error in absolute terms was about 1. 0  km for neural network methods and about 2. 0  km for the conventional algorithms in staged field tests. The restriction of neural network methods is the huge training process needed because so many different parameters affect the amplitude and frequency of the transient signal. For practical use the conventional methods based on the faulty line impedance calculation proved to be more promising. reviewe...|$|R
