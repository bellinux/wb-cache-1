50|$|<b>Antazoline</b> is a 1st {{generation}} antihistamine with anticholinergic properties used {{to relieve}} nasal congestion and in eye drops, usually {{in combination with}} naphazoline, to relieve the symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis. The drug is a Histamine H1 receptor antagonist: selectively binding to but not activating the receptor, thereby blocking the actions of endogenous histamine and subsequently leading to the temporary relief of the negative symptoms brought on by histamine.|$|E
40|$|Seven {{patients}} with chronic or recurrent supraventricular tachyarrhythmias were selected for a trial of <b>antazoline</b> therapy because sinus rhythm or a controlled ventricular response could not be achieved with quinidine, procainamide, digitalis or propranolol. Sinus rhythm was established by either intravenous administration of <b>antazoline</b> or direct-current countershock, and has been maintained in all for 4 to 16 months by oral administration of <b>antazoline.</b> Side effects were minor. <b>Antazoline</b> is a sufficiently promising antiarrhythmic agent to warrant large-scale controlled studies...|$|E
40|$|Ratio {{derivative}} spectrophotometrie {{method has}} been developed for the simultaneous determination of naphazoline (NAP) and <b>antazoline</b> (ANT) at micromolar levels in Britton Robinson buffer (pH 9) medium. In this method the overlapping spectra of naphazoline and <b>antazoline</b> were well resolved by making use of the first-derivative of the ratios of their direct absorption spectra. The derivative ratio absorbances of naphazoline and <b>antazoline</b> were measured at 227. 2 and 235 nm, respectively for their quantification. The method is simple, fast and does not require separation of naphazoline and <b>antazoline.</b> Another salient feature of the method is that simultaneous standard additions of both analytes permitted to resolve matrix effect and quantification at a unique standard addition plot. Naphazoline and <b>antazoline</b> were determined in the concentration range of 10 - 150 μmol L- 1 (NAP/ANT ratio varying from about 10 to 150) in the same aliquot with a precision and accuracy of about 1. 7 % and 1. 8 %, respectively. The recommended procedure was successfully applied for analysis of naphazoline and <b>antazoline</b> in eye drops...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Rapid {{conversion}} of atrial fibrillation (AF) to sinus rhythm may {{be achieved by}} the administration of class IA, IC and III antiarrhythmic drugs or vernakalant hydrochloride. However, that treatment {{may be related to}} potential pro-arrhythmia, lack of efficacy or the exceptionally high cost of a compound used. <b>Antazoline</b> is a first generation antihistaminic agent with chinidin-like properties. When administered intravenously, <b>antazoline</b> exerts a strong antiarrhythmic effect on supraventricular arrhythmia, especially on AF, facilitating rapid conversion to sinus rhythm. Despite a relative lack of published data <b>antazoline</b> has been marketed in Poland and widely used in cardiology wards and emergency rooms for many years due to its efficacy, safety and rapid onset of action within minutes of administration. Methods/design A randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, superiority clinical trial was designed to assess clinical efficacy of <b>antazoline</b> in rapid {{conversion of}} AF to sinus rhythm. Eligible patients will present AF lasting less than 43 hours, will be in stable cardio-pulmonary condition and will have no prior history of advanced heart failure or significant valvular disease. Long-term antiarrhythmic therapy is not considered an exclusion criterion. Subjects who fulfill selection criteria will be randomly assigned to receive intravenously either <b>antazoline</b> or placebo in divided doses and observed for 1. 5 hours after conversion to sinus rhythm or after the last i. v. bolus. Primary end point will be the conversion of AF to sinus rhythm confirmed in an electrocardiogram (ECG) during the observation period. Secondary end points will be comprised of time to conversion and return of AF during the observation period. Special consideration will be given to the observation of any adverse events. A sample size of 80 patients was calculated based on the following assumptions: two-tailed test, a type I error of 0. 01, a power of 90 %, efficacy of placebo 5 %, efficacy of <b>antazoline</b> 50 % and 20 % drop-out rate to fulfill the criteria of intention-to-treat analysis. Due to the presumed lack of statistical power, the secondary end points and safety endpoints will be considered exploratory. Clinical trials registry ClinicalTrials. gov, NCT 01527279 </p...|$|E

Isoniazid increased the oedema. All the substances, except <b>antazoline,</b> increased the rate at which isoniazid disappeared from the blood, and they all favoured accumulation of the drug in tissues.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to assess the potential neuroprotective effect of several imidazol(ine) drugs and agmatine on glutamate-induced necrosis and on apoptosis induced by low extracellular K+ in cultured cerebellar granule cells. Exposure (30 [*]min) of energy deprived cells to L-glutamate (1 – 100 [*]μM) caused a concentration-dependent neurotoxicity, as determined 24 [*]h later by a decrease in the ability of the cells to metabolize 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazoliumbromide (MTT) into a reduced formazan product. L-glutamate-induced neurotoxicity (EC 50 = 5 [*]μM) was blocked by the specific NMDA receptor antagonist MK- 801 (dizocilpine). Imidazol(ine) drugs and agmatine fully prevented neurotoxicity induced by 20 [*]μM (EC 100) L-glutamate with the rank order (EC 50 in μM) : <b>antazoline</b> (13) >cirazoline (44) >LSL[*] 61122 [2 -styryl- 2 -imidazoline] (54) >LSL[*] 60101 [2 -(2 -benzofuranyl) imidazole] (75) >idazoxan (90) >LSL[*] 60129 [2 -(1, 4 -benzodioxan- 6 -yl) - 4, 5 -dihydroimidazole] (101) >RX 821002 (2 -methoxy idazoxan) (106) >agmatine (196). No neuroprotective effect of these drugs was observed in a model of apoptotic neuronal cell death (reduction of extracellular K+) which does not involve stimulation of NMDA receptors. Imidazol(ine) drugs and agmatine fully inhibited [3 H]-(+) -MK- 801 binding to the phencyclidine site of NMDA receptors in rat brain. The profile of drug potency protecting against L-glutamate neurotoxicity correlated well (r= 0. 90) with the potency of the same compounds competing against [3 H]-(+) -MK- 801 binding. In HEK- 293 cells transfected to express the NR 1 - 1 a and NR 2 C subunits of the NMDA receptor, <b>antazoline</b> and agmatine produced a voltage- and concentration-dependent block of glutamate-induced currents. Analysis of the voltage dependence of the block was consistent with the presence of a binding site for <b>antazoline</b> located within the NMDA channel pore with an IC 50 of 10 – 12 [*]μM at 0 [*]mV. It is concluded that imidazol(ine) drugs and agmatine are neuroprotective against glutamate-induced necrotic neuronal cell death in vitro and that this effect is mediated through NMDA receptor blockade by interacting with a site located within the NMDA channel pore...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{investigate}} the effects of H 1 -antihistamines of the 1 st generation (<b>antazoline,</b> bromadryl, brompheniramine, dithiaden, cyclizine, chlorcyclizine, chlorpheniramine, clemastine) and the 2 nd generation (acrivastine, ketotifen, and loratadine) on the respiratory burst of phagocytes. Reactive oxygen species generation in neutrophils isolated from rat blood was measured using luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence. Changes in nitrite formation and iNOS protein expression by RAW 264. 7 macrophages were analysed using Griess reaction and Western blotting. The antioxidative properties of drugs in cell-free systems were detected spectrophotometrically, luminometrically, fluorimetrically, and amperometrically. The majority of the H 1 -antihistamines tested (bromadryl, brompheniramine, chlorcyclizine, chlorpheniramine, clemastine, dithiaden, and ketotifen) exhibited a significant inhibitory effect on the chemiluminescence activity of phagocytes. H 1 -antihistamines did not show significant scavenging properties against superoxide anion and hydroxyl radical, thus this could not contribute to the inhibition of chemiluminescence. H 1 -antihistamines had a different ability to modulate nitric oxide production by LPS-stimulated macrophages. Bromadryl, clemastine, and dithiaden were the most effective since they inhibited iNOS expression, which was followed by a significant reduction in nitrite levels. H 1 -antihistamines had no scavenging activity against nitric oxide. It can be concluded that the effects observed in the H 1 -antihistamines tested are not mediated exclusively via H 1 -receptor pathway or by direct antioxidative properties. Based on our results, antihistamines not interfering with the microbicidal mechanisms of leukocytes (<b>antazoline,</b> acrivastine and cyclizine) could be used preferentially in infections. Other antihistamines should be used, under pathological conditions accompanied by the overproduction of reactive oxygen species...|$|E
40|$|<b>Antazoline</b> is a {{comparatively}} {{safe and effective}} antiarrhythmic drug in many situations, for both the conversion and prevention of arrhythmias. It appeared {{to be most effective}} in the abolition of ventricular tachycardia, possibly helpful in 2 cases of cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation and beneficial in the prevention of atrial and ventricular premature beats. It was useful and deserves further trial in the prevention of paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia. It was almost ineffective in the conversion and prophylaxis of atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation but appeared to be of value in the prevention of paroxysmal atrial tachycardia. There was a high incidence of mild side effects, mostly of the gastrointestinal type, some of which were prevented by taking the drug with meals or with an antacid preparation. No irreversible or serious side actions were encountered, but diarrhea, central nervous system symptoms and chills and fever necessitated stopping the drug in a small percentage of patients...|$|E
40|$|In anaesthetized rabbits, {{electrical}} {{stimulation of the}} hypothalamus in areas analogous to the defence area in cats produces the 'defence reaction. ' This response includes signs of arousal and a large increase in blood flow to skeletal muscle in the hind limb caused by a vasodilatation in the skeletal muscle vasculature. The vasodilatation is a sympathetic response, {{and it is not}} dependent upon muscle activity in the hind limb. The muscle vasodilatation is insensitive to alpha-adrenoceptor, beta-adrenoceptor, cholinoceptor and histamine receptor antagonists. Intra-arterial injections of the purinoceptor agonists, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and adenosine, mimic the vasodilatation produced by {{electrical stimulation}}. The P 1 -purinoceptor blocker, aminophylline, attenuates adenosine-induced vasodilatation, but it does not affect the vasodilatation produced by ATP or hypothalamic stimulation. The P 2 -purinoceptor blocker, <b>antazoline,</b> attenuates the vasodilatation produced by both ATP and hypothalamic stimulation. Our results suggest that the muscle vasodilatation produced by hypothalamic stimulation is mediated by purinergic nerves which release ATP and act on P 2 -purinoceptors...|$|E

40|$|Four {{imidazoline}} derivatives: <b>antazoline</b> (AN), naphazoline (NN), tymazoline (TM), xylometazoline (XM), in {{the form}} of hydrochlorides in solid phase have been subjected to high energy e-beam irradiation from an accelerator (10 MeV) at a dose varied from 25 to 200 kGy. The effects of the irradiation have been assessed by DSC, X-ray diffraction, FTIR, EPR and TLC. The standard sterilisation dose of 25 kGy has been found to produce changes in the properties of one derivative (XM), two other ones (AN and TM) have been found sensitive to doses > 100 kGy, whereas NN has been resistant to irradiation in the whole range studied (25 – 200 kGy). EPR results indicated that the changes taking place in the therapeutic substances studied are related to radical formation. The irradiation induced changes in colour, a decrease or increase in the melting point, changes in the XRD pattern, small changes in the shape of FTIR peaks and the presence of radiolysis products. The XM compounds cannot be sterilised by irradiation because of the radiation induced changes in its physico-chemical properties...|$|E

The inhibitory effect of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) on contraction evoked by �-adrenergic stimulation is quite well-known, but molecular mechanism of this inhibition is unclear. In the present study, {{an interaction between}} �-adrenoceptor response and LPS in rat tail artery was investigated using chemical stimulation. In the presence of LPS noradrenaline and phenylephrine, concentration-response curves were shifted to the right with a change in maximal responses. The K and K values calculated in the presence and absence of LPS did not differ significantly. The results strongly suggest that LPS did not change the affinity of �-adrenoceptors. Changes in the plot showing relationship between agonist-evoked responses and receptor occupancy {{in the presence of}} LPS and reduction of K) /ED value suggest reduction of �-adre-noceptor reserve. In the experiments performed on arteries without endothelium, the inhibitory effect of LPS was still present. In the presence of atropine, <b>antazoline</b> and indomethacin, the reduction of �-adrenoceptor reserve was noted, but in the presence of NM-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), the inhibitory effect of LPS was not significant. Moreover, in LPS-pretreated arteries, in the presence of L-NAME, the increase in the receptor reserve was observed. It suggests that inhibitory effect of LPS is partially reversible. The results strongly indicate that in early endotoxemia, main inhibitory effect of LPS is connected with releasing nitric oxide and decreasing coupling between �-adrenoceptor and signal induction...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study we showed that the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists phentolamine, yohimbine, prazosin, corynanthine and idazoxan, when cumulatively applied in high {{concentrations}} (1 - 100 -mu-mol/l), can increase spontaneous myogenic activity in the rat portal vein. 5 -Methyl-urapidil and rauwolscine were ineffective in this respect. Pretreatment with phenoxybenzamine in a concentration of 1 -mu-mol/l (20 min), which results in alkylation of all functional alpha-adrenoceptors in the rat portal vein, was unable to antagonize the increase in spontaneous myogenic activity elicited by phentolamine. <b>Antazoline</b> (1 - 100 -mu-mol/l), a H- 1 antagonist and 2 -substituted imidazoline which is devoid of alpha-adrenoceptor blocking properties, exhibited similar effects on spontaneous myogenic activity as its structurally closely related analogue phentolamine. Since phentolamine is reported to interact with ATP-sensitive K+ channels we investigated the role of K+ channels in more detail. The K+ channel openers cromakalim and diazoxide elicited a decrease in spontaneous myogenic activity. Glibenclamide (0. 3 - 3 -mu-mol/l), a selective blocker of ATP-sensitive K+ channels in cardiac and pancreatic tissues, and phentolamine (1 - 10 -mu-mol/l) shifted the concentration-response curves of cromakalim and diazoxide concentration dependently to the right. Yohimbine showed only a modest effect in the highest concentration (100 -mu-mol/l) applied. E- 4031 (0. 01 - 0. 3 -mu-mol/l), a sotalol derivative {{and one of the}} most selective blockers of the delayed rectifier current (I(k)) in cardiac tissue, was a potent contractile agent when added to the rat portal vein in the same way as the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists. All other alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists as well as E- 4031, when tested in concentrations which maximally stimulated spontaneous myogenic activity, failed to influence the relaxations induced by cromakalim and diazoxide. The results of {{the present study}} cannot be explained on the basis of alpha-adrenoceptor blockade. Phentolamine, in contrast to the other alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists, can block glibenclamide-sensitive K+ channels in the rat portal vein. However, it seems unlikely that this property can explain its potent effects on spontaneous myogenic activity, since glibenclamide itself was inactive...|$|E
