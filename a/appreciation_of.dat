5|$|After the king's victory, {{one of his}} loyal adherents, Thomas Szécsényi was {{appointed}} voivode who suppressed a Saxon revolt in 1324. At that time, the autonomous Saxon province was divided into seats, each administered by a judge appointed by the king. In <b>appreciation</b> <b>of</b> the Transylvanian noblemen's services in the crushing of the revolt, Charles I exempted them from the taxes they had so far paid to the voivodes.|$|E
5|$|Another {{factor that}} helped Tchaikovsky's music become popular was {{a shift in}} {{attitude}} among Russian audiences. Whereas they had previously been satisfied with flashy virtuoso performances of technically demanding but musically lightweight compositions, they gradually began listening with increasing <b>appreciation</b> <b>of</b> the music itself. Tchaikovsky's works were performed frequently, with few delays between their composition and first performances; the publication from 1867 onward of his songs and great piano music for the home market also helped boost the composer's popularity.|$|E
5|$|<b>Appreciation</b> <b>of</b> art {{among the}} gentry class flourished during the Song dynasty, {{especially}} {{in regard to}} paintings, which is an art practiced by many.

5|$|Argentina {{fell into}} a deep {{recession}} {{in the second half of}} 1998, triggered and then compounded by a series of adverse external shocks, which included low prices for agricultural commodities, the <b>appreciation</b> <b>of</b> the US dollar, to which the peso was pegged at par, the 1998 Russian financial crisis, the LTCM crisis and the devaluation of the Brazilian real in January 1999. Argentina did not enjoy a rapid recovery, and the sluggishness of GDP growth fuelled concerns about the sustainability of public debt.|$|E
5|$|As Griet cleans Vermeer's studio, {{which his}} wife Catharina (Essie Davis) never enters, the painter begins to {{converse}} with her and encourages her <b>appreciation</b> <b>of</b> painting, light and color. Vermeer gives her lessons in mixing paints and other tasks, taking care to keep this secret from his wife, who would react with anger and jealousy if she found out {{that her husband was}} spending time with Griet. In contrast, Vermeer's pragmatic mother-in-law, Maria Thins (Judy Parfitt), sees Griet as useful to Vermeer's career.|$|E
5|$|Born into {{a musical}} family, Smith taught herself {{to play the}} piano and later became a classically trained musician.

5|$|Common ways to {{implement}} the Scout method include having Scouts spending time together in small groups with shared experiences, rituals, and activities, and emphasizing 'good citizenship' and decision-making by young people in an age-appropriate manner.

Primary activities include camping, woodcraft, aquatics, hiking, backpacking, and sports.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{circumstances}} of the separation, Holopainen's <b>appreciation</b> <b>of</b> Turunen as an artist remained.

Turunen {{said in an interview that}} she is very proud of her career with Nightwish. She considers the remaining band members extremely talented and wishes all the best for them and their subsequent lead singer Anette Olzon.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} path-dependent {{approach}} for estimating maximum <b>appreciations</b> <b>of</b> the renminbi expected {{by the market}} based on first-passage-time distributions. Using market data of the renminbi spot exchange rates, non-deliverable forward rates and currency option prices from 21 July 2005 (the reform of the exchange rate regime) to 28 February 2008 for model parameters, the maximum <b>appreciations</b> <b>of</b> the renminbi estimated under the proposed approach show that the market expected another large movement of the exchange rate during the 14 months after the reform. Subsequently, the few occasions <b>of</b> <b>appreciations</b> beyond the expected maximums coincided with trade-related issues and speculation that greater momentum <b>of</b> <b>appreciation</b> would be allowed by the authorities. The PBoC¡¦s measures were however largely incorporated into the derivatives¡¦ prices. The proposed approach {{can be used to}} gauge the range <b>of</b> <b>appreciations</b> <b>of</b> the renminbi anticipated in the market and to identify any exchange rate movements beyond market expectations. renminbi exchange rate, first-passage-time distributions, currency options...|$|R

5|$|During the 18th century, <b>appreciation</b> <b>of</b> Bashō's poems {{grew more}} fervent, and {{commentators}} such as Ishiko Sekisui and Moro Nanimaru {{went to great}} length to find references in his hokku to historical events, medieval books, and other poems. These commentators were often lavish in their praise of Bashō's obscure references, {{some of which were}} probably literary false cognates. In 1793 Bashō was deified by the Shinto bureaucracy, and for a time criticizing his poetry was literally blasphemous.|$|E
5|$|Grant's {{claims that}} Indian spiritual traditions like Tantra and Yoga {{correlate}} to Western esoteric traditions, {{and that both}} stem from a core, ancient source, has parallels in the perennial philosophy promoted by the Traditionalist School of esotericists.

Moreover, Grant's <b>appreciation</b> <b>of</b> Asian spiritual traditions has {{much in common with}} Theosophy, although Grant differed from the Theosophical movement with his valorisation of the 'left hand path'.|$|E
