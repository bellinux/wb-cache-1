5|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, {{cumulative}} 767 deliveries approached 900, but new sales declined during an airline industry downturn. In 2001, Boeing dropped {{plans for a}} longer-range model, the 767-400ERX, {{in favor of the}} proposed Sonic Cruiser, a new jetliner which aimed to fly 15percent faster while having comparable fuel costs as the 767. The following year, Boeing announced the KC-767 Tanker Transport, a second military derivative of the 767-200ER. Launched with an order in October 2002 from the Italian Air Force, the KC-767 was intended for the dual role of refueling other aircraft and carrying cargo. The Japanese government became the second customer for the type in March 2003. In May 2003, the United States Air Force (USAF) announced its intent to lease KC-767s to replace its aging KC-135 tankers. The plan was suspended in March 2004 amid a conflict of interest scandal, resulting in multiple US government investigations and the departure of several Boeing officials, including Philip Condit, the company's chief executive officer, <b>and</b> <b>chief</b> <b>financial</b> <b>officer</b> Michael Sears. The first KC-767s were delivered in 2008 to the Japan Self-Defense Forces.|$|E

25|$|Ridgewood {{is governed}} within the Faulkner Act (formally {{known as the}} Optional Municipal Charter Law) under Council-Manager plan B, as {{implemented}} on July 1, 1970, by direct petition. Under this form, the governing body consists of five council members who are responsible to hire and oversee a professional Village Manager who has full executive power for all departments. The government consists of five council members, with all positions elected at-large in nonpartisan elections to serve four-year terms on a staggered basis, with either two or three seats coming up for election in even-numbered years on the second Tuesday in May. At a reorganization meeting held on July 1 after newly elected council members take office, the council chooses a mayor and deputy mayor from among its members, with the mayor presiding over Council meetings, but without any executive authority. The Village Council appoints a Village Manager to oversee the day to day operations of the Village, to handle personnel, citizen inquiries and complaints, and to handle the administrative duties of the Village.

500|$|In January 1957, {{a letter}} was {{delivered}} to The Football Association (FA) from [...] "Mr Smith", in which the author made allegations that Sunderland were making illegal payments to players. The FA sent an investigation team, which found evidence of illegal payments in the Sunderland accounts, including a £3,000 (£ today) bill, supposedly for straw to cover the pitch. The investigators uncovered a string of similar accounting glitches; contract companies were purposely charging Sunderland excessive fees for services, and later sending credit-notes to redress the balance. These credit notes were passed on to players. In total, just over £5,000 (£ today) was handled in this way. The club's chairman <b>and</b> <b>chief</b> <b>financial</b> <b>officer,</b> along with three other club directors, were permanently suspended. Sunderland were fined £5,000 (£ today), manager Murray was fined £200 (£ today), {{and a number of}} players, including record-signing Trevor Ford were temporarily suspended€ from the game. In the aftermath of the event, manager Bill Murray was replaced by Alan Brown.|$|E
