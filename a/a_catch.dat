5|$|After McDonnell {{had made}} 103 out of 158, Murdoch and Scott {{completed}} the first double-century partnership in Test cricket. England, as the score mounted, used 11 bowlers: {{the first time}} in Test cricket that an entire team including the wicketkeeper was called upon to bowl. On this occasion, the wicketkeeper Lyttelton was the most successful bowler, taking 4/19. Grace, keeping wicket to Lyttelton, took <b>a</b> <b>catch</b> to dismiss Midwinter.|$|E
5|$|Almost all jumping spiders are predators, mostly {{preying on}} insects, on other spiders, {{and on other}} arthropods. The most common {{procedure}} is sighting the prey, stalking, fastening a silk safety line to the surface, using the two pairs of back legs {{to jump on the}} victim, and finally biting the prey. Most jumping spiders walk throughout the day, so that they maximize their chances of <b>a</b> <b>catch.</b>|$|E
5|$|He {{made his}} {{first-class}} debut for Queensland at 17 against Victoria in December 1933, having never previously attended a first-class match as a spectator. He conceded only six byes and took <b>a</b> <b>catch</b> in an innings of 542 in a tidy performance, and made 17 and three in an innings defeat, but was dropped after the match. Queensland officials had ruled {{that it was}} not advisable to take such a young player on away trips to Victoria, South Australia and New South Wales. Tallon reclaimed his position when Queensland returned for their home games and from then on was the first-choice wicket-keeper for the state. He played in only one other first-class match for the 193334 season, scoring 13 and taking <b>a</b> <b>catch</b> and a stumping in an eight-wicket win over South Australia.|$|E

In the final, Victoria batted first and made 5/127, Healy {{completing}} <b>a</b> <b>catch</b> and stumping. In reply, Healy made a duck as New South Wales lost four wickets {{in the first}} 13 balls and were all out for 75 to lose by 22 runs.|$|E
5|$|While {{almost all}} jumping spiders are predators, mostly preying on insects, on other spiders, {{and on other}} arthropods, Phaeacius does not use the usual hunting tactics. Most jumping spiders walk {{throughout}} the day, so that they maximise their chances of <b>a</b> <b>catch,</b> and jump on their prey and then bite it. Unlike most jumping spiders, Phaeacius and other spartaeines do not leap on prey, but lunge from about half the predator's body length away.|$|E
5|$|After {{being dropped}} from the senior state team, Karthik was {{overlooked}} for the selection in the zonal Duleep Trophy, and played in the Under-19s for South Zone. He had a more productive time in his second zonal season, scoring 180 runs at 60.00 with three half-centuries. He was rewarded with selection in the national Under-19 team, and played in three youth one day internationals (ODIs) against Nepal. He made only 51 runs at 17.00 without taking <b>a</b> <b>catch,</b> but India won all their matches with ease.|$|E

5|$|Another {{issue is}} that Murray cod caught and {{released}} in winter, while developing their eggs, or in spring prior to spawning, resorb their eggs and do not spawn. This may be a minor issue compared {{to some of the}} other threats facing Murray cod, nevertheless, concerned fishermen try to avoid catching wild Murray cod at these times. At this point in time a closed season is in place for the spring spawning period, during which anglers are not allowed to target Murray cod, even on <b>a</b> <b>catch</b> and release basis.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{traditionally}} fielded its first-choice team in {{the tour}} opener, which was customarily against Worcestershire. Hassett thus played as vice-captain of Bradman's first-choice team and took <b>a</b> <b>catch</b> as Australia dismissed the hosts for 233. However, when Australia batted, Bradman rearranged the order and Hassett came in at No. 7 with Australia’s score at 5/320 after losing 4/55 in a middle-order collapse. Hassett made 25 in 66 minutes with three fours as Australia declared at 8/462; the hosts were bowled out for 212 to complete an Australian victory by an innings and 17 runs. Hassett was rested for next match against Leicestershire, which resulted in another innings win for the tourists.|$|E

England's last pair added ten runs to close at stumps on 207/9 with Bedser on six and Wright eight, having just avoided the follow on.|$|E

5|$|Poulton was {{selected}} for the 2010 World Twenty20 in the West Indies and played in every match. With the selection of Elyse Villani to open with Nitschke, Poulton batted at No. 3 {{in all but one}} match. In the first warm-up match, she scored one from six balls before being dismissed by Sian Ruck as Australia lost to New Zealand by 18 runs. In the last warm-up match, she hammered 44 from 21 balls including two sixes and then took <b>a</b> <b>catch</b> to remove Armaan Khan as Australians made 5/166 and defeated Pakistan by 82 runs.|$|E
5|$|Tallon {{made his}} Test debut in a one-off Test against New Zealand at Wellington in March 1946, {{although}} the match was only given Test accreditation two years later. On a wet wicket, New Zealand were dismissed for 42 and 54 against the slow bowling of Bill O'Reilly and Ernie Toshack. Tallon made a stumping, a {{run out and}} took <b>a</b> <b>catch.</b> He scored only five runs as Australia won by an innings and 103runs. Tallon had rarely kept to O'Reilly's leg spin and impressed the bowler, who compared him with Oldfield. During the tour of New Zealand, Australia won all of their five matches, four by an innings. Tallon scored 123 runs at 41.00 and made 12 dismissals.|$|E

5|$|Washbrook and Edrich batted {{until late}} in the first day, when the former was {{dismissed}} by Johnston for 143 in the last over before stumps, hitting <b>a</b> <b>catch</b> to Lindwall in the slips. His innings included 22 fours and the dismissal ended a second wicket partnership worth exactly 100 runs. Washbrook had been solid in his back foot defence and scored many runs from overpitched deliveries. Bedser was sent in as the nightwatchman, and he survived the last four balls from Johnston as England closed at 268/2 without further addition to the score, with Edrich, who played fluently as he had done in the previous Test, on 41. England's supporters were much buoyed with the situation {{at the end of the}} first day.|$|E
5|$|After the Women's World Cup held {{in early}} 2009, Coleman {{transferred}} {{to play for}} the Australian Capital Territory, so Healy became New South Wales' wicket-keeper on a full-time basis {{for the start of the}} 200910 season. After making scores of 11, 12 and 29 in her first three innings of the one-day season, she struck an unbeaten 89 against Victoria. Coming in upon the fall of Leah Poulton with the score at 1/9 after three overs, she hit 13 fours in 82 balls, putting on partnerships of 72 with Blackwell and 82 with Sthalekar. New South Wales reached their target of 187 with more than 13 overs to spare and Healy was named the Player of the Match, having earlier taken <b>a</b> <b>catch</b> and made a stumping. Her season was interrupted by her selection in the Australian Under-21 team to play against the New Zealand Emerging Players. In five matches, she scored 50 runs at 10.00, took five catches and made one stumping as Australia won the series 41.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the next season, Morris was not made Australian captain despite being the {{incumbent}} vice-captain. Instead, he remained as deputy as Victoria's Ian Johnson was recalled to the team and assumed the captaincy. There was speculation that the two Queensland board members voted for Morris, the three New South Wales delegates voted for Miller, while the remainder voted Johnson. When England returned to Australia in 1954–55, Morris made his first Test century in almost four years during the opening Test at Brisbane. After English skipper Len Hutton won the toss and controversially sent Australia in, Morris made 153 to lay the foundation for a score of 8/601 declared and an innings victory. This included a partnership of 202 runs with Neil Harvey. The pair scored at a rate of nearly four runs per over, despite both players being repeatedly struck by the bowling of Frank Tyson, who was regarded as the fastest bowler of his era. Those were the only centuries made by Australian batsmen for the entire series, and Morris was covered in bruises; he deliberately used his body to fend off short-pitched balls rather than risk <b>a</b> <b>catch.</b>|$|E
