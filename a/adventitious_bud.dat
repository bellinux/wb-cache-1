50|$|Some plants {{normally}} develop adventitious buds {{on their}} roots, which can extend quite {{a distance from}} the plant. Shoots that develop from adventitious buds on roots are termed suckers. They are a type of natural vegetative reproduction in many species, e.g. many grasses, quaking aspen and Canada thistle. The Pando quaking aspen grew from one trunk to 47,000 trunks via <b>adventitious</b> <b>bud</b> formation on a single root system.|$|E
50|$|Adventitious {{roots and}} buds are very {{important}} when people propagate plants via cuttings, layering, tissue culture. Plant hormones, termed auxins, are often applied to stem, shoot or leaf cuttings to promote adventitious root formation, e.g. African violet and sedum leaves and shoots of poinsettia and coleus. Propagation via root cuttings requires <b>adventitious</b> <b>bud</b> formation, e.g. in horseradish and apple. In layering, adventitious roots are formed on aerial stems before the stem section is removed {{to make a new}} plant. Large houseplants are often propagated by air layering. Adventitious roots and buds must develop in tissue culture propagation of plants.|$|E

The selection agent kanamycin significantly inhibited growth of embryogenic tissue on filter paper in all the embryogenic lines and concentrations tested (20 – 50 mg l– 1).

All attempts to induce the formation of adventitious buds on the abaxial side of the leaves were unsuccessful. From the present and previous results, three polarity axes (longitudinal, transverse and dorsiventral axes) in the siting of bud formation on leaves are described. The gradient in the quantity and relative {{position of}} vascular bundles and changes in the stomatal density of a leaf are discussed in terms of their possible roles in the determination of the sites of budding on isolated leaves. Key words: <b>Adventitious</b> <b>bud</b> — Heloniopsis orientalis — Isolated leaves — Polarity (bud formation) — Stomatal density. Polarity in shoot and root formation has been demonstrated in the regeneration of buds and roots on cuttings. It is well known that field-grown Heloniopsis orientalis produces adventitious buds on the adaxial side of the leaf near its tip. In excised leaves, however, plantlets are usually formed on two sites on the midrib, one near the cut (basal end) and the other near the tip (apical end) (Kato and Kawahara 1972, Kumazawa 1960). Winkler (1903, 1907) described three sites for the new formation of adventitious buds on the mother leaf. So far as is known, adventitious buds in monocotyledons always develop {{at the base of the}} petiole or the cut end of the leaf blade. Therefore, bud formation does not exhibit any distinct bipolarity. Heloniopsis leaves are an exception in this respect.

These adventitious buds formed only when the basal medium contained one-fourth strength NH 4 NO 3 suggesting that the NH 4 ion level in the medium affected <b>adventitious</b> <b>bud</b> formation. Other cytokinins, including kinetin and zeatin when applied at 10 - 4 M would also induce <b>adventitious</b> <b>bud</b> formation, while N 6 -isopentenylpurine (2 iP) even when applied at 10 - 3 M did not. Only a two to three week culture period on the high cytokinin medium was necessary to induce <b>adventitious</b> <b>bud</b> formation. The regeneration of adventitious buds from unorganized callus cultures of Douglas-fir was also studied. Douglas-fir callus cultures were induced from aseptically grown seedlings placed on a one-half strength M&S (macro and microelements) containing 10 - 5 M NAA and 10 - 6 M BAP. Adventitious buds arose on subcultured callus placed on a medium containing 1 O 5 M BAP and either 0. 0 or 10 - 7 M NAA. Other cytokinins including kinetin, zeatin and 6 -benzyl- 9 -tetrahydropyrone adenine (SD 8339) were all able to induce <b>adventitious</b> <b>bud</b> formation when applied at 1 O- 5 M, however, 2 iP induced bud formation only when applied at 10 - 4 M. NAA levels greater than 106 M inhibited <b>adventitious</b> <b>bud</b> formation. Callus cultures formed adventitious buds on a one-half strength M&S medium, and again the NH 4 ion concentration was found to affect bud formation. The ability to form buds declined the longer callus was maintained in culture and it was completely lost after one year in culture. In an attempt to understand the role of IAA in bud formation in Douglas-fir tissues in culture, a method for the rapid isolation and quantitation of endogenous IAA levels was developed. This involved extraction of the IAA in methanol, followed by purification of the extract by column chromatography and trace enrichment, separation on HPLC and detection by the natural fluorescence of IAA. The system is sensitive enough to detect picogram amounts of TM in milligram tissue samples. No large {{differences were found in}} the endogenous IAA levels in bud forming and non-bud forming cultures. Estimates for IAA in Douglas-fir shoot tips collected before, during and after bud break in the spring showed that endogenous TM levels increase dramatically just before bud break in the spring and then begin to decline slowly. There were also no large differences in the endogenous IAA levels in Douglas-fir shoot tips forming and not forming adventitious buds. Because no large differences were found in either the callus or the shoot tip cultures forming or not forming buds, the role of endogenous TM in regulating bud formation may be questioned. The results also show that this method of IAA analysis can be used to detect and quantify endogenous TM levels in tissues and tissue cultures of Douglas-fir to aid in our understanding of the role of IAA in plant development...|$|E

To enhance the understanding of artemisinin biosynthesis, we have successfully bred self-pollination Artemisia annua plants. Here, we report efficient somatic embryogenesis and organogenesis of self-pollination plants and artemisinin formation in regenerated plants. The first through sixth nodal leaves of seedlings are used as explants. On agar-solidified MS basal medium supplemented with TDZ (0. 6 mg/l) and IBA (0. 1 mg/l), all explants after inoculation of less than 3 weeks start to form embryogenic calli, which further produce globular, torpedo, heart and early cotyledon embryos. In all six positional leaves, explants from the sixth leaf show the rapidest responses to induction of embryo-genic calli and somatic embryos. On this medium, somatic embryos continuously develop into <b>adventitious</b> <b>buds,</b> which can form adventitious roots on a rooting medium containing NAA (0. 5 mg/l). Meanwhile, on agar-solidified MS basal medium supplemented with BAP (1 mg/l) and NAA (0. 05 mg/l), approximately 100 % of explants from leaves # 3 - 6 form calli in less than 3 weeks of inoculation and <b>adventitious</b> <b>buds</b> via organogenesis in 3 - 4 weeks. In all six posi-tional leaves, explants from the sixth leaf exhibit the rapidest response to induction of calli and <b>adventitious</b> <b>buds.</b> Nearly 100 % <b>adventitious</b> <b>buds</b> can form <b>adventitious</b> roots on the rooting medium. Regenerated plants from both so...|$|R
