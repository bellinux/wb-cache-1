The ruling was issued while Scrushy was on bond awaiting sentencing, and deemed him a flight risk. Scrushy again filed for release in February and May 2008 but both requests were denied.|$|E

Sharp suspected a trap, but replied that he would meet her at the planned time. Hoping to kill Sharp before the meeting, Beauchamp traveled to Bowling Green, but found his target had already left for Frankfort. He had eluded the trap. Beauchamp decided to finish his legal studies in Bowling Green and wait for Sharp to return there.|$|E

5|$|In 1940, when General Zhukov was {{promoted}} to commander of the Kiev Military District in the Ukrainian SSR, Bagramyan wrote a letter <b>asking</b> <b>to</b> serve under his command. Zhukov agreed, and in December asked for his help writing a paper to {{be presented to the}} commanders of the Soviet Military Districts.

30|$|First, {{subjects}} were given PS- 1 and <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> group the problems into some categories {{based on some}} kind of “similarity” they suppose (any number/size of categories were allowed), then <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> label each category they made (called “categorization task 1 ”). After that, they were <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> solve eight problems in PS- 1 (called “pre-test”). After a week, the {{subjects were}} divided into two groups: one was the “control group” (seven subjects) and another was the “experimental group” (eight subjects). The average scores of both groups in the pre-test were made equivalent. The subjects in control group were given the usual explanation and <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> learn it. The subjects in the experimental group were given the SOC-based explanation and <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> learn it. After that, by using PS- 2, “categorization task 2 ” was conducted {{in the same way as}} above. Finally, subjects were <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> solve eight problems in PS- 2 (called “post-test”).|$|R

5|$|On November 14, 2015, {{the candle}} was lit {{nearly two weeks}} prior to the {{official}} ceremony date after local resident Joe Mercado posted to an Easton, Pennsylvania Facebook community page <b>asking</b> <b>to</b> light the candle to show support {{for the people of}} Paris, France after a terrorist attack the day before. Due to overwhelming response to the post, the city organized a candle light vigil that evening with several hundred residents attending.

The candle remained lit for three days before being shut off until the official lighting event.|$|E

She chose Suchit-Renee. Mohit & Anchal were <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> vote-out one of them and the other will vote-out one among Mohit and Anchal.

5|$|When Rae accidentally {{reveals that}} Brendan is gay {{in front of}} his son, Brendan is furious and threatens to kill her. Rae later tells Silas Blissett (Jeff Rawle) about Brendan's threat, but is unaware that Silas is a serial killer.

Ste arranges a memorial for her after Brendan is charged with her murder. However, Brendan is later released when Silas is discovered as her killer.|$|E
5|$|Another related {{investigation}} {{involved the}} fate of the children of captured pregnant guerrillas, who were given up for adoption by the military junta. An estimated 500 children were involved. The investigation became controversial during the Kirchner administration, as those involved had become adults and some of them refused to participate in DNA testing. One of those cases was the Noble siblings case, involving the adopted sons of Ernestina Herrera de Noble, owner of the Clarín newspaper. The Kirchners advanced a bill in Congress to make the genetic testing of suspected victims mandatory. Although the measure had popular support, critics considered it a breach of the right to privacy, and politically motivated because of a dispute between Kirchner and the Clarín newspaper. The Noble siblings tests in 2011 were negative, and the case was closed in January 2016, after Kirchner left the presidency. Hilario Bacca, a confirmed son of disappeared guerrillas, appealed a judicial ruling that sought to change his name, <b>asking</b> <b>to</b> keep the name he had been using.|$|E
5|$|At that meeting, held at Bulldogs owner Ralph Hay's Hupmobile {{showroom}} in Canton, Ohio, {{representatives of}} the Rock Island Independents, the Muncie Flyers, the Decatur Staleys, the Racine Cardinals, the Massillon Tigers, the Chicago Tigers, and the Hammond Pros agreed to join the league. Representatives of the Buffalo All-Americans and Rochester Jeffersons could not attend the meeting, but sent letters to Hay <b>asking</b> <b>to</b> {{be included in the}} league. Team representatives changed the league's name slightly to the American Professional Football Association and elected officers, installing Thorpe as president, Cofall as vice-president, Ranney as secretary-treasurer. Under the new league structure, teams created their schedules dynamically as the season progressed, so there were no minimum or maximum number of games needed to be played. Also, representatives of each team voted to determine the winner of the APFA trophy.|$|E

50|$|The {{client is}} given the 40 cards and <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> sort them into two stacks: “meaningful” and “not meaningful”, {{according}} to the client’s emotional and physical responses. The client is <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> review the pictures one by one. He is <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> focus on changes in mood or emotions during the viewing process. Pictures that elicit physical or emotional reactions or elicit a memory are placed onto the “meaningful” stack.|$|R
40|$|Destination {{memory is}} the ability to {{remember}} the receiver of transmitted information. By means of a destination memory directed forgetting task, we investigated whether participants with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) were able to suppress irrelevant information in destination memory. Twenty-six AD participants and 30 healthy elderly subjects were <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> tell 10 different proverbs to 10 different celebrities (List 1). Afterwards, half of the participants were instructed to forget the destinations (i. e., the celebrities) whereas the other half were <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> keep them in mind. After telling 10 other proverbs to 10 other celebrities (List 2), participants were <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> read numbers aloud. Subsequently, all the participants were <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> remember the destinations of List 1 and List 2, regardless of the forget or remember instructions. The results show similar destination memory in AD participants who were <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> forget the destinations of List 1 and those who were <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> retain them. These findings are attributed to inhibitory deficits, by which AD participants have difficulties to suppress irrelevant information in destination memory...|$|R
