25|$|Formerly {{a working-class}} neighborhood, Wrigleyville is the {{nickname}} {{to the neighborhood}} directly surrounding Wrigley Field. Also known as Lakeview West, its borders run from Cornelia Avenue and Grace Street, to Halsted Street and Racine Avenue. Wrigleyville features low-rise brick buildings and houses, some with rooftop bleachers colloquially called Wrigley Rooftops where people can purchase seats to watch baseball games or concerts that, while generally more expensive than tickets for seats within the park itself, come with <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> eat and drink service. Proprietors {{are able to do}} so under special agreements with the Chicago Cubs organization. Many Wrigleyville bars and restaurants (particularly on North Clark Street) feature sports-oriented themes. Bars such as Sluggers, Murphy's Bleachers, Casey Moran's, Rockwood Place, Sports Corner and The Cubby Bear host the Cubs crowds near the Wrigley Field intersection of North Clark Street and West Addison Street.|$|E

Rockefeller went steadily ahead in business from there, making money each year of his career. While his brother Frank fought in the Civil War, Rockefeller tended his business and hired substitute soldiers. He gave money to the Union cause, as did many rich Northerners who avoided combat. Rockefeller was an abolitionist who voted for President Abraham Lincoln and supported the then-new Republican Party. As he said, [...] "God gave me money", {{and he did not}} apologize for it.

The album opens with the [...] "mournfully harried" [...] "Ole Man Trouble". For Claudrena N. Harold of PopMatters, the song {{is one of his}} most phantasmagoric tunes. The lyrics deal with a man, who is [...] "unable to escape the brutal realities of the blues", and has been compared with Paul Robeson's [...] "Ole Man River". [...] "Respect" [...] was inspired by a quote of drummer Al Jackson, Jr., who allegedly said to Redding after a tour, [...] "What are you griping about?

Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone disliked the removal of the original bassline, and compared it to [...] "putting Bobby Orr on the ice without a hockey stick". IGN's Todd Gilchrist praised West's remix and stated that it was a [...] "pretty great track".

500|$|Critics {{have taken}} issue with ticket {{prices at the}} ballpark, set at $7, $15, and $18. While less {{expensive}} than ticket prices for major league ballparks, prices are {{among the highest in}} all minor league classes.

The ballpark runs a number of specials throughout the year including [...] "Friends & Family" [...] where 4 tickets, 4 hats and 4 value meals to a restaurant cost less than $10 a ticket.

The song used for the fifth track, [...] "I've Been Loving You Too Long", had been previously recorded in mono with Booker T.

[...] Erlewine also said that the songs were [...] "vehicles for the metal grind". Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B–. Reviewer Jim Farber said that the lyrics [...] "provide a new blend of metal and remnants of alt-rock." [...] Jon Pareles from The New York Times said the album was [...] "choppy", and also said that lead singer Jonathan Davis was [...] "wrestling with self-hatred, violent impulses, parental execration, and a confused sexual identity..." [...] Robert Christgau of The Village Voice said that, although Korn [...] "deny they're metal", they [...] "nevertheless demonstrate that the essence of metal ... is self-obliterating volume and self-aggrandizing display."

500|$|In his {{original}} appearance, Jason was scripted as a mentally disabled young boy. Since Friday the 13th, Jason Voorhees has been {{depicted as a}} non-verbal, indestructible, machete-wielding mass murderer. Jason is primarily portrayed as being completely silent throughout the film series. Exceptions to this include flashbacks of Jason as a child, and a brief scene in Jason Takes Manhattan where the character cries out [...] "Mommy, please don't let me drown!" [...] in a child's voice before being submerged in toxic waste, and in Jason Goes To Hell where his spirit possesses other individuals. Online magazine Salon's Andrew O'Hehir describes Jason as a [...] "silent, expressionless...blank slate." [...] When discussing Jason psychologically, Sean S. Cunningham said, [...] "...he doesn't have any personality. He's like a great white shark. You can't really defeat him. <b>All</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> hope for is to survive." [...] Since Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives, Jason has been a [...] "virtually indestructible" [...] being. Tom McLoughlin, the film's director, felt it was silly that Jason had previously been just another guy in a mask, who would kill people left and right, but get [...] "beaten up and knocked down by the heroine at the end". McLoughlin wanted Jason {{to be more of}} a [...] "formidable, unstoppable monster". In resurrecting Jason from the dead, McLoughlin also gave him the weakness of being rendered helpless if trapped beneath the waters of Crystal Lake; inspired by vampire lore, McLoughlin decided that Jason had in fact drowned as a child, and that returning him to {{his original}} resting place would immobilize him. This weakness would be presented again in The New Blood, and the idea that Jason had drowned as a child was taken up by director Rob Hedden as a plot element in Jason Takes Manhattan.|$|E
500|$|Modern Warfare – Reflex Edition was ported by Treyarch. The Wii {{version of}} Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare has fewer {{features}} {{than the other}} console versions. It does not support split-screen multiplayer, and the graphics are not as developed. However, it supports co-operative gameplay in the campaign on a single screen. At any moment, a second Wii remote can be activated giving the second player their own aiming crosshairs. The game received an aggregated score of 76% on Metacritic. IGN gave the Wii version of the game, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare – Reflex Edition, a score of 7.0, saying the visuals and pointer controls are not as polished as the Wii version of , though they did mention the customization options and multiplayer are impressive. Official Nintendo Magazine gave it 80%, praising it for packing everything from its next-gen counterpart, but again criticizing the visuals. GameTrailers gave the game an 8.8, saying that despite some sacrifices, it retains everything good from its original version. Game Informer scored the game at a 6.5, stating that while the game was rather poor graphically, even by Wii standards, the bigger problem was the Wii remote, stating {{that it did not}} have enough buttons to support Modern Warfare's control scheme, and also that it was quite imprecise, contrasting it with the dual analog system used by the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions, and the mouse and keyboard system on the Windows version of the game. GameSpot gave the game an 8.5, stating that the online was as addictive as the other versions, they also said that the controls [...] "are precise and customizable enough to let you be <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> be".|$|E
