5|$|The {{format of}} the Super Quiz {{differs from that of}} the other subject areas. Added in 1969, it offers a {{culminating}} championship event. The Super Quiz consisted of a forty-question multiple choice test as well as a relay round until 2013. In 2013, the multiple-choice portion was eliminated and the relay portion expanded to include six of the objective subjects. Generally referred to as the Super Quiz Relay, it is the only event viewable by the general public. The relay starts with the Varsity students, followed by the Scholastic and the Honors students. Each group is given 10 or 15 questions, depending on the format decided by the state coordinator. These questions are read aloud to the audience and are printed or projected for the competitors. After the questions and answers are read, the students are allowed seven seconds to select the correct answer. The answer is checked on the spot by <b>a</b> <b>judge</b> <b>and</b> scores are immediately displayed to the audience.|$|E
5|$|As Paul, Christine and Michael {{continue}} to hit dead ends on solving Carmine's murder, Fen announces {{he wants to}} confess to <b>a</b> <b>judge</b> <b>and</b> be sentenced prison time; Christine and Lauren however are strongly against it. Just as Fen decides {{he is going to}} confess to the judge, Michael discovers that Carmine is in fact alive. He reveals that he was in fact being transported into witness protection the day of the banquet for giving the FBI evidence against another criminal, but he wanted to see Lauren one last time. Fen shot him that night but doctors and medical examiners secretly revived him and sent him into witness protection. He refuses to return to Genoa City to exonerate Fen because of his own safety, so instead Michael films him confessing that he is alive. Michael arrives with the video before Fen can confess, and he is exonerated. After being reunited with his family, Michael and Lauren later mention that Fen had gone to Arizona to visit potential colleges.|$|E
5|$|In {{her account}} of the affair, Margaret Macaulay explores 18th-century attitudes to women in general as a {{significant}} factor and notes that although numerous documents {{from the hands of}} Lord Grange's friends and supporters are still extant, not a single contemporary female view of the affair has survived, save that of Lady Grange herself. Divorces were complex and divorced mothers were rarely given custody of children. Furthermore, Lord Grange's powerful friends in both the church and the legal profession might have made this a risky endeavour. Something of James Erskine's attitude to these matters may perhaps be gleaned from the fact that for his first speech in the House of Commons he chose to oppose the repeal of various laws relating to witchcraft. Even in his day this appeared unduly conservative and his perorations were met with laughter, which effectively ended his political career before it had begun. Writing in the mid-19th century the Sobieski Stuarts told the tale {{from the perspective of the}} descendants of the Highland aristocrats who had been responsible for Chiesley's kidnap and imprisonment. They emphasise Lady Grange's personal shortcomings, although to modern sensibilities these hardly seem good reasons for <b>a</b> <b>judge</b> <b>and</b> Member of Parliament and his wealthy friends to organise an illegal kidnapping and life sentence.|$|E
