5|$|During Prohibition, Pflueger {{designed}} {{bars for}} private clubs such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Stock</b> Exchange Luncheon Club where members kept their personal bottles in small lockers behind the bar, and two bars for The Family, {{one at the}} Family Farm in Woodside and one at the clubhouse in San Francisco. Pflueger created a cocktail bar and nightclub for Frank Martinelli and Tom Gerun in 1931, the Bal Tabarin, featuring a stage for live music and colorful indirect lighting from above metal fins in the ceiling and behind curved metal strips upstage. When Prohibition ended in December 1933, Bal Tabarin received an immediate renovation by Pflueger along with a liquor license from the state. Pflueger was then asked to design cocktail lounges for several hotels, completing the Cirque for the Fairmont Hotel in 1935, adorned with finely painted murals by Esther Bruton, and in 1939, both the Patent Leather Bar for the St. Francis Hotel and the Top of the Mark for the Mark Hopkins Hotel. The Patent Leather Bar used a metal-finned ceiling much like that which Pflueger had installed above the audience at the Paramount Theatre in Oakland. A padded, serpentine bar snaked through the room's mirror, chrome and black leather decor. Ansel Adams was retained by C. Templeton Crocker {{to show off the}} new cocktail lounge in photographs.|$|E

25|$|Reverse {{convertibles}} are a {{less common}} variation, mostly issued synthetically. They would be {{opposite of the}} vanilla structure: the conversion price would act as a knock-in short call option: <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> price drops below the conversion price the investor would start to be exposed the underlying stock performance and {{no longer able to}} redeem at par its bond. This negative convexity would be compensated by a usually high regular coupon payment.|$|E
25|$|In March 2013, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> market's Dow Jones Industrial Average set record highs, {{household}} and personal income were both down sharply from their 2007 peaks.

Inflation-adjusted ("real") per-capita disposable personal income rose steadily in the U.S. from 1945 to 2008, but has since remained generally level.|$|E

25|$|In 1999, Ebbers {{announced}} that MCI WorldCom would acquire its rival Sprint Communications for over $115 billion. This transaction, however, was abandoned after U.S. and European antitrust regulators raised objections. This, {{combined with a}} general downturn in the telecom market, resulted in a downturn in WorldCom's stock price. Much of Ebbers' personal holdings were purchased with loans that had been backed by his WorldCom stock holdings. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> price declined he received a number of margin calls to provide additional collateral for these loans. In an effort to prevent Ebbers from having to sell his shares, the WorldCom board of directors authorized a series of loans and loan guarantees between September 2000 and April 2002.|$|E
25|$|A broader {{example of}} {{emergent}} properties in biology is {{viewed in the}} biological organisation of life, ranging from the subatomic level to the entire biosphere. For example, individual atoms can be combined to form molecules such as polypeptide chains, which in turn fold and refold to form proteins, which in turn create even more complex structures. These proteins, assuming their functional status from their spatial conformation, interact together and with other molecules to achieve higher biological functions and eventually create an organism. Another example is how cascade phenotype reactions, as detailed in chaos theory, arise from individual genes mutating respective positioning. At the highest level, all the biological communities in the world form the biosphere, where its human participants form societies, and the complex interactions of meta-social systems such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> market.|$|E
25|$|The {{tools are}} usually mounted in a {{dedicated}} bore finishing machine, however {{they can also}} be mounted in a milling machine. In either case the tool, workpiece, or both are rotated and the tool is plunged into the bore and removed. The part is then transferred to the next station or a larger tool is mounted and a larger bore machined, and the process repeated until the desired bore geometry is reached. The number of tools required to achieve the desired bore size is dependent on the workpiece material, the amount of stock to be removed and geometrical requirements, with four to six tool pieces being common. Each tool is progressively larger than the last, but in diminishing increments; <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> removal is reduced, so is the tool's diamond grit size.|$|E

25|$|This was {{electrified}} in 1904, {{in response}} to extensive competition from new electric trams. The concept was a success for the North Eastern Railway (NER), a noted pioneer in electrification, as passenger numbers returned to pre-tram levels. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> reached life expectancy in 1937, the network was remodelled by London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) to reflect the changing industrial and residential makeup of the area. Electrified {{at the same time}} was the dockside branch, where a pair of Class ES1 (formerly NER No.1 and 2) locomotives were introduced in 1905. These British Thomson-Houston locomotives operated from both the third rail and overhead line. British Railways removed the electrification between 1963 and 1967, citing the changing industrial and population makeup of the area which reduced the need for electric traction. Much of the Tyneside network was later re-electrified (using 1500VDC overhead) as the Tyne and Wear Metro.|$|E

Volvos 151–160 were repainted into a new branding for route 49, The Queen of Scots with 136–138 and 170 now repainted into standard madder and white.

2500|$|Theses {{policies}} were labeled {{by some as}} [...] "Trickle-down economics," [...] though others argue {{that the combination of}} significant tax cuts and a massive increase in Cold War related defense spending resulted in large budget deficits, an expansion in the U.S. trade deficit, as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> market crash of 1987, while also contributing to the Savings and Loan crisis.
