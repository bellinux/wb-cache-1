5000|$|Early stage {{clinical}} trials for <b>alfimeprase</b> with NU206 (R-respondin protein) and NU172 (short acting thrombin inhibitor) were promising and {{were approved by}} the FDA. Bayer was collaborating with Nuvelo on late stage studies on <b>alfimeprase.</b> After Nuvelo’s failure in these studies, Bayer closed the deal in June 2007. However, Nuvelo was optimistic and continued the trial with <b>alfimeprase.</b> However, in March 2008, Nuvelo’s phase II trial failed to meet endpoints, thereby forcing Nuvelo to discontinue the trial. The company laid off forty employees and restructured the organization. Also, executive vice president Michael Levy left the company ...|$|E

50|$|In February 2003, Hyseq {{merged with}} Variagenics {{giving birth to}} “Nuvelo Inc.” to further {{development}} of drug “alfimeprase.” This drug therapy was developed against peripheral arterial occlusion or “Leg Attack” disease and was approved as orphan drug status. This accelerated the clinical development of <b>alfimeprase.</b>|$|E
50|$|January 2006, Nuvelo partnered {{to develop}} <b>Alfimeprase.</b> Bayer was to commercialize the drug outside the United States. Nuvelo {{retained}} commercial {{rights in the}} United States market and was to receive ROW royalties ranging from 15% to 37.5%.The deal was structured with a $50 million upfront payment and milestone payments totaling $385 million ($165M in development milestones and $170M in sales and commercialization). Although many of these milestones were never achieved, in 2006 a total of $28.9M was billed to Bayer under their cost-sharing agreement.|$|E
50|$|Nuvelo’s {{market cap}} reached {{a peak of}} {{approximately}} $US 1 billion in the lead up to <b>alfimeprase</b> phase 3 studies completion, but share price plummeted eventually to less than $1 and received notification from NASDAQ. Despite this, Nuvelo was able to show positive proof of concept for NU172 in August 2008. Following this, Nuvelo was merged with ARCA Biopharma Inc. on September 26, 2008 forming a late stage cardiovascular biotechnology company. ARCA biopharma focuses on developing genetically targeted cardiovascular therapies, with lead candidate drug Gencaro, a beta blocker and vaso-dilator. It was Nuvelo’s genetically targeted technology and cardiovascular drug development that interested ARCA Biopharma in acquiring the company.|$|E

40|$|PurposeTo {{investigate}} {{the safety and}} effectiveness of a novel thrombolytic, <b>alfimeprase,</b> in catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) of acute peripheral arterial occlusions (PAO). MethodsBetween April 2005 and March 2007, patients with acute PAO (Rutherford class I or IIa) of a lower extremity and onset of symptoms within 14 days prior to randomization were included. Studies HA 004 and HA 007 enrolled respectively 300 and 102 patients. Both studies HA 004 and HA 007 were placebo-controlled. HA 004 had two placebo arms, intrathrombus and perithrombus, while HA 007 had intrathrombus placebo arm. HA 004 was partially double-blind (perithrombus group was not blinded) and HA 007 was double-blind. Patients were randomized to intrathrombus <b>alfimeprase</b> (0. 3 mg/kg), intrathrombus (IT) placebo, or perithrombus (PT) placebo (HA 004 only) in two divided weight-based infusions 2 hours apart. Depending on arteriographic results after treatment, patients received no further intervention or underwent endovascular therapy or open vascular surgery. The primary endpoint of both studies was efficacy of <b>alfimeprase</b> compared with placebo as measured by avoidance of an open vascular surgery procedure at 30 days. ResultsThe avoidance of open vascular surgery at 30 days was seen in 52 (34. 9 %), 42 (37. 2 %), and 7 patients (18. 4 %) with <b>alfimeprase,</b> IT placebo, and PT placebo in HA 004 and 15 (29. 4 %) and 9 patients (17. 6 %) with <b>alfimeprase</b> and IT placebo in HA 007; differences between <b>alfimeprase</b> and IT placebo were not statistically significant. Results were similar for secondary endpoints, including arterial flow restoration in 4 hours, 30 -day ankle-brachial index, index limb pain severity, and hospital stay duration. The overall rate of adverse events was higher with <b>alfimeprase</b> than placebo. Hemorrhagic and peripheral embolic event rates with <b>alfimeprase</b> were 23 % (34 patients) and 10. 1 % (15 patients) in HA 004 and 9. 4 % (5 patients) and 9. 8 % (5 patients) in HA 007; rates with IT placebo were 11 % (12 patients, P =. 107) and 5 % (5 patients, P =. 148) in HA 004 and 10 % (5 patients, P =. 982) and 0 % in HA 007 (P =. 07). No deaths were related to study drug administration. ConclusionsCDT for acute PAO with <b>alfimeprase</b> was as safe as placebo. However, <b>alfimeprase</b> was no more effective than placebo in increasing 30 -day surgery-free survival. The surprising effectiveness of placebo alone demonstrates that {{the inclusion of a}} placebo arm is essential to the design of future lytic trials...|$|E
40|$|Fibrolase is the fibrinolytic enzyme {{isolated}} from Agkistrodon contortrix contortrix (southern copperhead snake) venom. The enzyme was purified by a three-step HPLC procedure and {{was shown to}} be homogeneous by standard criteria including reverse phase HPLC, molecular sieve chromatography and SDS-PAGE. The purified enzyme is a zinc metalloproteinase containing one mole of zinc. It is composed of 203 amino acids with a blocked amino-terminus due to cyclization of the terminal Gln residue. Fibrolase shares a significant degree of homology with enzymes of the reprolysin sub-family of metalloproteinases including an active site homology of close to 100 %; it is rapidly inhibited by chelating agents such as EDTA, and by alpha 2 -macroglobulin (α 2 Μ). The enzyme is a direct-acting thrombolytic agent and does not rely on plasminogen for clot dissolution. Fibrolase rapidly cleaves the A(α) -chain of fibrinogen and the B(β) -chain at a slower rate; it has no activity on the γ-chain. The enzyme exhibits the same specificity with fibrin, cleaving the α-chain more rapidly than the β-chain. Fibrolase was shown to have very effective thrombolytic activity in a reoccluding carotid arterial thrombosis model in the canine. A recombinant version of the enzyme was made in yeast by Amgen, Inc. (Thousand Oaks, CA, USA) and called <b>alfimeprase.</b> <b>Alfimeprase</b> is identical to fibrolase except for a two amino acid truncation at the amino-terminus and the insertion of a new amino-terminal amino acid in the truncated protein; these changes {{lead to a more}} stable enzyme for prolonged storage. <b>Alfimeprase</b> was taken into clinical trials by Nuvelo, Inc. (San Carlos, CA), which licensed the enzyme from Amgen. <b>Alfimeprase</b> was successful in Phase I and II clinical trials for peripheral arterial occlusion (PAO) and central venous access device (CVAD) occlusion. However, in Phase III trials <b>alfimeprase</b> did not meet the expected end points in either PAO or CVAD occlusion and in a Phaase II stroke trial, and Nuvelo dropped further development in 2008...|$|E

First {{published}} October 21, 2005; doi: 10. 1152 /ajpheart. 00649. 2005. —Plasmin-dependent thrombolytic {{agents are}} potentially prothrombotic and proinflammatory.
