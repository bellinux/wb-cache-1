Radar jamming reduces the lethality of the guidance equipment yet improves the survival ability of the target [4]. The new strategy should be proposed in air defense guidance equipment system to meet the current electronic warfare needs after carefully studying the {{development of}} airborne electronic countermeasure technology [5]. At present, {{there have been a}} large number of researches concerning the electronic interference, but most of them are based on a certain kind of interference. The research scope is relatively scattered and lacks comprehensive interference analysis and model study [6]. This paper analyzes the theory of mathematical modeling and simulation of common types of electronic jamming, which will {{play an important role in}} the identification of enemy electronic jamming and electronic jamming to enemies. It has important practical significance in the current form of electronic warfare technology and pushes forward the researches of radar <b>anti-jamming</b> <b>technology.</b>|$|E

This paper {{introduces}} the basic principle of phase code pulse compression technology, {{the characteristics of}} phase coded pulse compression system, and the technical approach of radar to implement phase code pulse compression. 1 The introduction Modern radar face "four threats " of anti-radiation missile, target stealth technology, Low altitude penetration, comprehensive electronic jamming in high technology war nowdays. It has become the key factor to success in modern warfare that whether the radar system can survive and play their efficiency after suffered the destroy or jamming by enemy. To enhance the comprehensive ability of "four counteraction ", radar must adopt new systems and technology to reduce the reconnaissance and intercept probability. Phase code pulse compression technology {{is a kind of}} anti reconnaissance, <b>anti-jamming</b> <b>technology</b> adopting the complex phase encoding pulse waveform when transmitting and according to certain compression coding rule when receiving. 2 The basic principle of phase code pulse compression 2. 1 Phase coded pulse signal Phase coded pulse signal is consist of a number of t he pulse of same frequency and width but different initial phase, as shown in figure 1 （a）. The width of each pulse is equal, are the τ 0, If the pulse starting phase is 0, then member as “+”, If the width of pulse isπ，then member as “－”. the total width of radio frequency wide pulse which consist of N numbers of pulseτ=Nτ 0. 2. 2 Phase code pulse compression Phase encoding wide pulse signal reflected by the target compressed in the pulse compression network in the radar receiver. pulse compression network is consist of tap delay line, weighted device and summator, pulse compression network of Intermediate frequency signal of 7 bit phase encoding as shown in figure 1 （b）...|$|E
30|$|Ding et al. in [14] {{provided}} a novel effective algorithm using kernel KMC (k-means clustering) method to be answerable for attacker detection, {{which not only}} improves the attacker detection performance but also offers processing and memory savings. Zhang et al. in [15] proposed a security scheme based on localized combinatorial keying (LOCK) scheme and employees ID-based secure group key management, which minimizes the number of key storage requirement {{and the number of}} the communication messages for rekeying. Sakran et al. in [16] proposed a secure relay selection scheme which selects a trusted decode and forward relay to assist the SUs and maximize the achievable secrecy rate that is subjected to the interference power constraints at the PUs for the different number of eavesdroppers and PUs under available channel knowledge in the security constrained CRNs. In [17], Chen et al. proposed a game theoretical anti-jamming scheme and modeled the jamming and anti-jamming process as a Markov decision process. With this approach, secondary users are able to avoid the jamming attack launched by external attackers. In [18], Jo et al. proposed a selfish attack detection technique, COOPON (called cooperative neighboring cognitive radio nodes). However, this approach needs to detect and decide the secondary users as legitimate SU (LSU) or selfish SU (SSU) through comparing the reported data one by one while selecting a reliable user as the comparison object. In this case, it is bound to bring a large consumption of calculation when lots of secondary users are in this scheme. In order to improve the cooperative detection performance, Ding et al. in [19] designed a joint spatio-temporal spectrum sensing algorithm, which based on three phases (i.e., a global cooperation phase, a local cooperation phase, and a joint decision phase). Gao et al. in [20] proposed a privacy preserving framework in collaborative spectrum sensing to prevent location privacy leaking from the collaborative attacks. This scheme based on encrypting authentication of fusion center can effectively thwart PUEA, SSDF attack, and misbehavior. Pietro et al. in [21] proposed an <b>anti-jamming</b> <b>technology</b> based on time-delayed broadcast scheme, which opens up a new area for cognitive radio network security. This mechanism takes the greedy malicious users into account which are mainly improving the access opportunities through misconduct.|$|E
