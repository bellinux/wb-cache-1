5|$|<b>Aquatic</b> <b>invertebrates</b> {{have been}} {{recognized}} {{as an integral part}} of the river otter's diet. Otters consume more aquatic insects in the summer as the populations increase and specific life stages heighten their susceptibility. Most <b>aquatic</b> <b>invertebrates</b> preyed upon by the otters are from the families Odonata (dragonfly nymphs), Plecoptera (stonefly nymphs), and Coleoptera (adult beetles). Invertebrates discovered within scats or digestive tracts could most likely be a secondary food item, first being consumed by the fish that are subsequently preyed upon by the otters.|$|E
5|$|Cormorants are {{medium to}} large aquatic birds with mainly dark plumage {{and areas of}} {{coloured}} skin on the face. The bill is long, thin and sharply hooked for catching fish and <b>aquatic</b> <b>invertebrates.</b> They nest in colonies, usually by the sea. There are about 39 species worldwide, with two recorded in Leicestershire and Rutland.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} 100 years, {{riparian}} vegetation communities throughout the Southwest United States have been extensively invaded by Tamara spp. (saltcedar). Saltcedar derives its common name from its physiological adaptation to excrete salts. The production of Tamarix detritus with associated secondary chemicals {{may affect the}} quality of <b>aquatic</b> <b>invertebrate</b> food and habitat resources. An alteration in food and habitat quality may affect the composition and structure of <b>aquatic</b> <b>invertebrate</b> assemblages. A series of experiments was conducted contrasting <b>aquatic</b> <b>invertebrate</b> assemblage densities, colonization rates, and growth rates associated with Tamarix versus native vegetation, Populus fremontii (cottonwood) and Salix exigua (willow), to determine if <b>aquatic</b> <b>invertebrate</b> assemblages have been altered by the invasion of Tamarix. Results of invertebrate growth rates over 13 weeks indicate that Tamarix is minimally different in food quality to cottonwood and willow. I failed to find differences in invertebrate colonization rates or invertebrate assemblage densities associated with Tamarix compared to cottonwood and willow over two 6 -week time periods...|$|R

5|$|Like other newts, Triturus {{species are}} {{carnivorous}} and feed mainly on invertebrates. During the land phase, prey include earthworms and other annelids, different insects, woodlice, and snails and slugs. During the breeding season, they prey on various <b>aquatic</b> <b>invertebrates,</b> and also tadpoles of other amphibians {{such as the}} common frog or common toad, and smaller newts. Larvae, depending on their size, eat small invertebrates and tadpoles, and also smaller larvae of their own species.|$|E
40|$|Intermittent {{rivers and}} ephemeral streams (IRES) support diverse and {{sometimes}} distinctive <b>aquatic</b> <b>invertebrate</b> communities. Although flow intermittence {{has been linked}} to reduced taxa richness, the highly variable environmental conditions that characterize IRES can enhance both taxonomic and functional diversity, with different invertebrates characterizing flowing, pool, dry, and flow-resumption phases. <b>Aquatic</b> <b>invertebrate</b> communities, which include specialist taxa, have a diverse range of adaptations to promote their survival in the pools and dry bed sediments that characterize IRES channels during nonflowing phases. These tolerant organisms and recolonists from outside of IRES channels allow communities to recover once flow resumes. IRES invertebrate communities have been affected by human activity, especially where flow regimes have been altered by climate change, water resource pressures, and changing land use. Restoration initiatives, from riparian revegetation projects to conservation strategies that protect individual species, are therefore needed to safeguard <b>aquatic</b> <b>invertebrate</b> community diversity in IRES.

5|$|Hippo {{defecation}} creates allochthonous {{deposits of}} organic matter along the river beds. These deposits have an unclear ecological function. A 2015 study suggests that hippo dung provides nutrients from terrestrial material for fish and <b>aquatic</b> <b>invertebrates.</b> Because of their size and their habit of taking the same paths to feed, hippos can {{have a significant impact}} on the land across which they walk, both by keeping the land clear of vegetation and depressing the ground.

5|$|Before the 1960s and 1970s, the {{prevailing}} interpretation of hadrosaurids like Edmontosaurus {{was that they}} were aquatic and fed on aquatic plants. An example of this is William Morris's 1970 interpretation of an edmontosaur skull with nonbony beak remnants. He proposed that the animal had a diet much like that of some modern ducks, filtering plants and <b>aquatic</b> <b>invertebrates</b> like mollusks and crustaceans from the water and discharging water via V-shaped furrows along the inner face of the upper beak. This interpretation of the beak has been rejected, as the furrows and ridges are more like those of herbivorous turtle beaks than the flexible structures seen in filter-feeding birds.|$|E
5|$|Hemlock trees form {{a canopy}} over Big Wapwallopen Creek in some places. The Wapwallopen Gorge {{is listed as}} a Locally Significant site on the Luzerne County Natural Areas Inventory.

5|$|About 12,500 {{species of}} insects are native to Florida, {{most of which}} {{naturally}} flew into the region from the Caribbean or Southeastern United States. An additional 1,000 {{have been identified as}} exotic. Insects create about $1 billion of damage to structures and agriculture in Florida each year. The tide of arriving insects is nearly impossible to control with the volume of goods and shipments coming into South Florida. Imported citrus is a major avenue for damaging insects. Twenty-one species have been imported and released to act as biological control agents: to impede the growth of invasive plants or counter the effects of other insects. Others, such as the Madagascan hissing cockroach (Gromphadorhina portentosa) and European cricket (Acheta domesticus) are sold as pets or fishing bait, and are then released into backyards. Similarly, <b>aquatic</b> <b>invertebrates</b> such as mussels, clams, snails, and melania find their ways into local waters from the bottoms of ships or in bilge holds. The aquarium trade also supplies enthusiasts with exotic species which are dumped or escape into waterways.|$|E
5|$|When attacked, {{the common}} toad adopts a {{characteristic}} stance, inflating its body and standing with its hindquarters raised and its head lowered. Its chief means of defence {{lies in the}} foul tasting secretion that is produced by its paratoid glands and other glands on its skin. This contains a toxin called bufagin and is enough to deter many predators although grass snakes seem to be unaffected by it. Other predators of adult toads include hedgehogs, rats and mink, and even domestic cats. Birds that feed on toads include herons, crows and birds of prey. Crows have been observed to puncture the skin with their beak and then peck out the animal's liver, thus avoiding the toxin. The tadpoles also exude noxious substances which deter fishes from eating them but not the great crested newt. <b>Aquatic</b> <b>invertebrates</b> that feed on toad tadpoles include dragonfly larvae, diving beetles and water boatmen. These usually avoid the noxious secretion by puncturing the tadpole's skin and sucking out its juices.|$|E
5|$|With their complex {{reproductive}} {{needs and}} permeable skins, amphibians are often {{considered to be}} ecological indicators. In many terrestrial ecosystems, they constitute {{one of the largest}} parts of the vertebrate biomass. Any decline in amphibian numbers will affect the patterns of predation. The loss of carnivorous species {{near the top of the}} food chain will upset the delicate ecosystem balance and may cause dramatic increases in opportunistic species. In the Middle East, a growing appetite for eating frog legs and the consequent gathering of them for food was linked to an increase in mosquitoes. Predators that feed on amphibians are affected by their decline. The western terrestrial garter snake (Thamnophis elegans) in California is largely aquatic and depends heavily on two species of frog that are decreasing in numbers, the Yosemite toad (Bufo canorus) and the mountain yellow-legged frog (Rana muscosa), putting the snake's future at risk. If the snake were to become scarce, this would affect birds of prey and other predators that feed on it. Meanwhile, in the ponds and lakes, fewer frogs means fewer tadpoles. These normally play an important role in controlling the growth of algae and also forage on detritus that accumulates as sediment on the bottom. A reduction in the number of tadpoles may lead to an overgrowth of algae, resulting in depletion of oxygen in the water when the algae later die and decompose. <b>Aquatic</b> <b>invertebrates</b> and fish might then die and there would be unpredictable ecological consequences.|$|E

5|$|Olson {{made many}} inferences on the paleoecology of the Texas Red beds {{and the role}} of Dimetrodon within its ecosystem. He {{proposed}} several main types of ecosystems in which the earliest tetrapods lived. Dimetrodon belonged to the most primitive ecosystem, which developed from aquatic food webs. In it, aquatic plants were the primary producers and were largely fed upon by fish and <b>aquatic</b> <b>invertebrates.</b> Most land vertebrates fed on these aquatic primary consumers. Dimetrodon was probably the top predator of the Red Beds ecosystem, feeding on a variety of organisms such as the large shark Xenacanthus, the aquatic amphibians Trimerorhachis and Diplocaulus, and the terrestrial tetrapods Seymouria and Trematops. Insects are known from the Early Permian Red Beds and were probably involved to some degree in the same food web as Dimetrodon, feeding small reptiles like Captorhinus. The Red Beds assemblage also included some of the first large land-living herbivores like Edaphosaurus and Diadectes. Feeding primarily on terrestrial plants, these herbivores did not derive their energy from aquatic food webs. According to Olson, the best modern analogue for the ecosystem Dimetrodon inhabited is the Everglades. The exact lifestyle of Dimetrodon (amphibious to terrestrial) has long been controversial, but bone microanatomy supports a terrestrial lifestyle, which implies that it would have fed mostly on land, on the banks, or in very shallow water. Evidence also exists for Dimetrodon preying on aestivating Diplocaulus during times of drought, with three partially eaten juvenile Diplocaulus in a burrow of eight bearing teeth marks from a Dimetrodon that unearthed and killed them.|$|E

25|$|It is {{suspected}} that the four species of introduced caddisflies Trichoptera are adversely impacting native <b>aquatic</b> <b>invertebrate</b> populations either through competition for space and resources, or because of its large body size and sheer abundance in Hawaiian streams.
