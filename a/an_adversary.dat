When the gauge is half-charged a player can use specials called Overdrive Attacks, which cause more damage than regular moves. A full gauge allows a player to make an Instant Kill, defeating an opponent regardless of health; if an Instant Kill is unsuccessful, the tension gauge will not charge {{for the remainder of}} that round.|$|E
5|$|Becky starts dating local builder Jason Grimshaw, {{but after}} being {{with him for}} several months, she cheats on him with pub {{landlord}} Steve McDonald. Jason and Becky move in together, but when Jason's ex-wife Sarah Grimshaw (Tina O'Brien) reveals she is considering coming home, he ends things with Becky. Becky attacks Jason in The Rovers Return pub and then goes on a pub crawl, getting drunk and stealing a girl's purse in a nightclub, flashing her breasts in public, and vandalising a travel agency window and a police car. When the police bring Becky in for questioning over her actions, she encounters DC Hooch (Dominic Carter), <b>an</b> <b>adversary</b> from her past. Becky claims to have been with Steve {{on the night of}} her rampage and blackmails him to give her a false alibi, threatening to tell his partner Michelle Connor (Kym Marsh) about their one-night stand.|$|E
5|$|A keep (from the Middle English kype) {{is a type}} of {{fortified}} tower built within castles {{during the}} Middle Ages by European nobility. Scholars have debated the scope of the word keep, but usually consider it to refer to large towers in castles that were fortified residences, used as a refuge of last resort should the rest of the castle fall to <b>an</b> <b>adversary.</b> The first keeps were made of timber and formed {{a key part of the}} motte-and-bailey castles that emerged in Normandy and Anjou during the 10th century; the design spread to England as a result of the Norman invasion of 1066, and in turn spread into Wales during the second half of the 11th century and into Ireland in the 1170s. The Anglo-Normans and French rulers began to build stone keeps during the 10th and 11th centuries; these included Norman keeps, with a square or rectangular design, and circular shell keeps. Stone keeps carried considerable political as well as military importance and could take up to a decade to build.|$|E

5|$|Anarky is {{a fictional}} character, {{appearing}} in comic books published by DC Comics. Co-created by Alan Grant and Norm Breyfogle, he {{first appeared in}} Detective Comics No. 608 (November 1989), as <b>an</b> <b>adversary</b> of Batman. Introduced as Lonnie Machin, a child prodigy with knowledge of radical philosophy and driven to overthrow governments to improve social conditions, stories revolving around Anarky often focus on political and philosophical themes. The character, who is named after the philosophy of anarchism, primarily espouses anti-statism; however, multiple social issues have been addressed through the character, including environmentalism, antimilitarism, economic inequality, and political corruption. Inspired by multiple sources, early stories featuring the character often included homages to political and philosophical books, and referenced anarchist philosophers and theorists. The inspiration {{for the creation of}} the character and its early development was based in Grant's personal interest in anti-authoritarian philosophy and politics. However, when Grant himself transitioned to the philosophy of Neo-Tech, developed by Frank R. Wallace, he shifted the focus of Anarky from a vehicle for socialist and populist philosophy, to rationalist, atheist, and free market thinking.|$|E
5|$|Between his {{election}} and his inauguration, Garfield was occupied with assembling a cabinet that would establish peace between Conkling's and Blaine's warring factions. Blaine's delegates had provided {{much of the}} support for Garfield's nomination, and the Maine senator received the place of honor: Secretary of State. Blaine {{was not only the}} president's closest advisor, he was obsessed with knowing all {{that took place in the}} White House, and was even said to have spies posted there in his absence. Garfield nominated William Windom of Minnesota as Secretary of the Treasury, William H. Hunt of Louisiana as Secretary of the Navy, Robert Todd Lincoln as Secretary of War, and Samuel J. Kirkwood of Iowa as Secretary of the Interior. New York was represented by Thomas Lemuel James as Postmaster General. Garfield appointed Pennsylvania's Wayne MacVeagh, <b>an</b> <b>adversary</b> of Blaine's, as Attorney General. Blaine tried to sabotage the appointment by convincing Garfield to name an opponent of MacVeagh, William E. Chandler, as Solicitor General under MacVeagh. Only Chandler's rejection by the Senate forestalled MacVeagh's resignation over the matter.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Understanding the {{capabilities}} of adversaries (e. g., how much the <b>adversary</b> knows about <b>a</b> target) is important for building strong security defenses. Computing <b>an</b> <b>adversary’s</b> knowledge about <b>a</b> target requires new modeling techniques and experimental methods. Our work describes a quantitative analysis technique for modeling <b>an</b> <b>adversary’s</b> knowledge about private information at workplace. Our technical enabler is a new emulation environment for conducting user experiments on attack behaviors. We develop a role-playing cyber game for our evaluation, where the participants take on the adversary role to launch ID theft attacks by answering challenge questions about a target. We measure <b>an</b> <b>adversary’s</b> knowledge based on how well he or she answers the authentication questions about a target.

40|$|In {{times of}} conflict, <b>an</b> <b>adversary’s</b> {{resources}} are <b>a</b> source of potential harm. Many geopoliti-cal tactics are, thus, quite explicitly economic, {{as they seek}} either to deter <b>an</b> <b>adversary’s</b> worst intentions or reduce its capacity to inflict damage (Richardson 1960; Tullock 1974). Relevant pol-icies include trade-limiting sanctions (Galtung 1967; Pape 1997) and direct attacks on an adver-sary’s military infrastructure or personnel. 1 This paper explores a third example, namely efforts to undermine <b>an</b> <b>adversary’s</b> source of income. I focus on US efforts to reduce the resources of Taliban-loyal insurgents by suppressing the Afghan opium trade, with additional appli-cations to conflicts involving oil-producing nations. The Taliban historically profited from the opium trade through a 10 percent tax on farm-ers, known locally as ushr, and by providing traffickers with protection services. This link between opium income and Taliban resources, coupled with concerns about a Narcotics-Insecurity Cycle, motivates {{the view that the}} United States should suppress the Afghan opium trade (Blanchard 2009).
