5000|$|The post is {{regulated}} by the Courts-Martial (Appeals) Act 1951. The appointment is made by the British Sovereign {{on the recommendation of}} the Lord Chancellor. Formerly, the Judge Advocate General had to be a <b>barrister,</b> <b>advocate,</b> or <b>solicitor</b> with higher rights of audience, of 10 years' standing. As of 21 July 2008 the experience needed to qualify was reduced in line with a general move to broaden diversity in the judiciary.
