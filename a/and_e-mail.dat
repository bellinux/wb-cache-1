5|$|In {{the summer}} of 2005, when Corzine was running in the New Jersey gubernatorial election, news first emerged of his {{relationship}} with Katz and the money she had received. Corzine was elected governor despite the scandal. In the fall of 2006, during an impasse in contract negotiations between the Corzine administration and the state's seven major state employee unions (including the CWA), Katz contacted the governor by phone <b>and</b> <b>e-mail</b> to lobby for a renewal of the negotiations. Their relationship and the financial settlement Katz received after their breakup led to allegations of many potential conflicts of interest in labor negotiations while Corzine was governor. A state ethics panel, acting on a complaint from Bogota mayor Steve Lonegan, ruled in May 2007 that Katz's contact with Corzine during negotiations did not violate the governor's code of conduct.|$|E
5|$|The Walk of Fame {{was first}} {{conceived}} in 1996 when Peter Soumalias suggested {{the idea of}} a Walk of Fame for famous Torontonians to the board of the Toronto Entertainment District Association. They rejected his idea but he went on to establish a Walk of Fame for Canadians. Canada's Walk of Fame runs an annual contest in which Canadians can nominate potential inductees. In 2000, prior to the introduction of the online voting system, over 30,000 nominations were received via letters, fax <b>and</b> <b>e-mail.</b> The committee then analyzes the nominees based on the following criteria: the nominee was born in Canada or has spent their formative or creative years in Canada; they have had a minimum of 10 years experience in their field; they have had a national or international impact on Canada’s Cultural heritage. Following the Selection Committee's evaluation, the nominees that meet all of the requirements are forwarded to the board of directors, who then select the inductees.|$|E

25|$|An often-used {{analogy to}} explain the Domain Name System is that it serves as the phone book for the Internet by {{translating}} human-friendly computer hostnames into IP addresses. For example, the domain name www.example.com translates to the addresses 93.184.216.119 (IPv4) and 2606:2800:220:6d:26bf:1447:1097:aa7 (IPv6). Unlike a phone book, DNS can be quickly updated, allowing a service's location on the network to change without affecting the end users, who continue {{to use the same}} host name. Users take advantage of this when they use meaningful Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), <b>and</b> <b>e-mail</b> addresses without having to know how the computer actually locates the services.|$|E
