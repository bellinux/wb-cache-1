40|$|AbstractThe Measurement/Logging while Drilling (M/LWD) {{system is}} used to collect and {{transmit}} the logging data while drilling oil/gas wells, in which logging data is transmitted using Mud Pulse Telemetry. Due to the one-way non-feedback erasure channel property, {{it is hard to}} correct transmission errors caused by Mud channel noises in real time. This paper proposes a Compressive Sensing (CS) based Transmission (CST) scheme for logging data delivering in M/LWD systems. The CTS scheme is tolerant to transmission errors without <b>Automatic</b> <b>Request</b> <b>for</b> <b>Repetition</b> mechanism and error correcting code, and also provides an interface for field technicians to adjust the effective coding rate according to various transmission accuracy requirements. To further improve the communication efficiency of CST, we introduce the improved Bernoulli matrix as the measurement matrix in the CS framework. Extensive experiments results with the real logging data are presented to verify the performance of the CST scheme...|$|E

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this study was to explore {{conversational}} repair strategies employed by elementary level ESL students in their classroom. This study investigated repair strategies that were employed by ESL students and determined if there were differences in the usage of repair strategies by class types and grade levels. This study examined how elementary ESL students? repair strategies dealt with communication breakdown in their ESL classroom from a conversation analysis perspective. The data were collected from five participants who were in two different types of ESL classes: (1) instruction centered class; and (2) language related game-playing class. In order to investigate the variable of grade levels, first and second grade students? ESL class and third and fourth grade students? tutoring class were chosen. Twenty-four class hours were observed with a video camera. The data were transcribed following the transcription conventions of conversation analysis. The results derived from the study were following; 1. In this study the elementary ESL students used nine types of repair strategies. They were: 1) unspecified, 2) interrogatives, 3) (partial) repeat, 4) partial repeat plus question word, 5) understanding check, 6) <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>repetition,</b> 7) <b>request</b> <b>for</b> definition, translation or explanation, 8) correction, and 9) nonverbal strategies. The elementary ESL students used understanding check and partial repeat more frequently. 2. The findings indicated that both class types and grade levels influenced the types and distribution of the students? repair strategies. 3. Instruction class produced more amounts of conversational repair than game-playing class. However, in both types of classes, first/second grade students employed understanding check the most frequently, and third/fourth grade students partial repeat the most. 4. In the first/second grade students? repair practices, understanding check was observed in the teacher?s direction.

We analyse the results for the period 2000 April to 2002 April to evaluate the performance of the procedure.

The method of the procedural challenge depended on the understanding whether the settlement is an agreement (contract) between parties before the court or it is a decision of the court (on acceptance or rejection of the proposal of the parties to reach a settlement). In the earlier instance the method of challenge is by filing of an action, and in the latter instance it represents a form of a legal remedy, most often extraordinary legal remedy - <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>repetition</b> of a trial, against final and binding decision of the court by which the settlement was either accepted or rejected. Theoretical dilemma about the legal nature of the court settlement, had an effect on normative regulations, as well as on court practice. In the Serbian law, this dilemma was resolved by enactment of the Civil Procedure Code which explicitly regulates that court settlement is challenged by an action before the court. As a result of this, the idea of a court settlement, as a form of an agreement, prevailed in the legal system. However, considerable procedural effects of the court settlement cannot be ignored. The principal procedural effect is that the litigation is terminated. Further, the court settlement represents a form of an executive title...|$|R

Data quality evaluation software has been developed in-house in C language and X-MOTIF environment and put into use to evaluate many parameters relevant to ascertain these qualities. However, with ever increasing demand for the very high-resolution satellite data, it is felt necessary that the above software needs to be upgraded and new approaches are to be developed for exploiting the high information content available from such imagery. Of many commercially available software tools, IDL /ENVI {{has been found to}} be well suited and user friendly to perform the above tasks.

The issue of when nodes should report their data is {{considered in the}} context of real-time monitoring applications. The first part of this thesis shows that asynchronous aggregation, in which the time of each node’s transmission is determined adaptively based on its local history of past packet receptions from its children, outperforms synchronous aggregation by providing lower delay for a given end-to-end loss rate. Second, new broadcast-based aggregation protocols that minimize the number of packet transmissions, relying on multipath delivery rather than <b>automatic</b> repeat <b>request</b> <b>for</b> reliability, are designed and evaluated. The performance of broadcast-based aggregation is compared to that of unicast-based aggregation, {{in the context of}} both real-time and delay-tolerant data collection.

Unicast and broadcast-based coverage-preserving data aggregation protocols are designed and evaluated. The performance of the proposed protocols is compared to that of data collection protocols relying on node scheduling...|$|R

For adaptive transmission over the channel common to the multicast group users, the AMC mode is chosen with the minimum SNR among the users to guarantee the target performance of all users. In the meanwhile, the minimum SNR required to support an AMC mode is aggressively designed by allowing retransmission with HARQ schemes. For the proposed design, we derive the average packet error rate, average number of transmission, and spectral efficiency and provide the performance numerically obtained. Numerical results show that the cross-layer design for multicast provides a significant performance gain at a small number of retransmissions as in unicast. In particular, it is observed that AMC design with HARQ is more beneficial in the low SNR region where multicast performs worse than unicast. I...|$|R

The goal is to provision effective capacities that sus-tain certain statistical delay guarantees with a small probability of error. We use a stochastic non-equilibrium approach that models the variability of traffic and service to formalize the influence of delay constraints on the effective capacity. Permitting unbounded delays, known ergodic capacity results from information theory are recovered in the limit. We prove that the model has the property of additivity, which enables composing CDE boundaries obtained for sources and systems as if in isolation. A method for construction of CDE boundaries is devised based on moment-generating functions, which includes the large body of results from the theory of effective bandwidths.

40|$|Detecting {{explicit}} user actions, i. e., <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> {{web pages}} such as hyper-link clicks, from passive traces is fundamental for many applications, such as network forensics or content popularity estimation. Every URL explicitly visited by a user usually triggers further <b>automatic</b> URL <b>requests</b> to obtain all objects that compose the web page. HTTP traces provide {{a summary of}} all URLs requested by users, but no information {{that could be used}} to separate explicit from <b>automatic</b> <b>requests.</b> Previous works have targeted this problem and ad-hoc heuristics have been proposed. Validation has been typically done using synthetic traces. This paper investigates whether an approach based solely on machine learning can successfully detect user actions from HTTP traces. A machine learning approach would come with many advantages - e. g., it minimizes manual tuning of parameters and can easily adapt to page structure changes. We build both real and synthetic traces to assess the performance and gain insights on the features that bring most advantages in classification. Our results show that machine learning reaches similar or better performance as previous heuristics. Furthermore, we show that models built with machine learning algorithms are robust, presenting consistent performance in different scenario...|$|R
40|$|User {{surveys in}} {{telemedicine}} networks confirm that follow up data are essential, {{both for the}} specialists who provide advice and for those running the system. We have examined the feasibility of a method for obtaining follow-up data automatically in a store-and-forward network. We distinguish between follow-up, which is information about the progress of a patient {{and is based on}} outcomes, and user feedback, which is more general information about the telemedicine system itself, including user satisfaction and the benefits resulting from the use of telemedicine. In the present study, we were able to obtain both kinds of information using a single questionnaire. During a 9 -month pilot trial in the MSF telemedicine network, an email <b>request</b> <b>for</b> follow-up was sent automatically by the telemedicine system to each referrer exactly 21 days after the initial submission of the case. A total of 201 <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> follow-up were issued by the system and these elicited 41 responses (a response rate of 20 %). The responses were largely positive. For example, 95 % of referrers found the advice helpful, 90 % said that it clarified their diagnosis, 94 % said that it assisted with management of the patient and 95 % said that the telemedicine response was of educational benefit to them. Analysis of the characteristics of the referrers who did not respond, and their cases, did not suggest anything different about them in comparison with referrers who did respond. We were not able to identify obvious factors associated with a failure to respond. Obtaining data by <b>automatic</b> <b>request</b> is feasible. It provides useful information for specialists and for those running the network. Since obtaining follow-up data is essential to best practice, one proposal to improve the response rate is to simplify the <b>automatic</b> <b>requests</b> so that only patient follow-up information is asked for, and to restrict user feedback requests to the cases being assessed each month by the quality assurance panel...|$|R
