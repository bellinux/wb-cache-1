In this paper, we present a comprehensive comparison study on the application of different artificial neural networks in 1 -h-ahead wind speed forecasting. Three types of typical neural networks, namely, <b>adaptive</b> <b>linear</b> <b>element,</b> back propagation, and radial basis function, are investigated. The wind data used are the hourly mean wind speed collected at two observation sites in North Dakota. The performance is evaluated based on three metrics, namely, mean absolute error, root mean square error, and mean absolute percentage error. The results show that even for the same wind dataset, no single neural network model outperforms others universally in terms of all evaluation metrics. Moreover, the selection of the type of neural networks for best performance is also dependent upon the data sources. Among the optimal models obtained, the relative difference in terms of one particular evaluation metric can be as much as 20 %. This indicates the need of generating a single robust and reliable forecast by applying a post-processing method.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} speed sensorless {{technique}} for high performance induction motor drives {{based on the}} retrieval and tracking of the rotor slot harmonic. First, two cascaded ADALINEs (<b>Adaptive</b> <b>Linear</b> <b>Elements)</b> are used to extract the rotor slot harmonic (RSH) from the stator phase current signature, acting as adaptive filters, respectively in configuration band and notch, whose output consists of the RSH. Second, the MCA EXIN neurons are used to extract the eigenvector corresponding to the minimum eigenvalue of the autocorrelation matrix, which is formed by the ADALINEs' output sequence. Then, the slot frequency is estimated by using Pisarenko's theory with this retrieved minimum eigenvector, and subsequently {{the speed of the}} motor is estimated. Compared to the original Pisarenko's method however, not only the proposed algorithm can work recursively sample by sample, but the computational complexity and mean square frequency estimation error are largely reduced. The proposed sensorless technique has been experimentally tested on a suitably developed test set-up with a 2 -kW induction motor drive.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a novel neural-network-based predictor for received power level prediction in direct sequence code {{division multiple access}} (DS/CDMA) systems. The predictor consists of an <b>adaptive</b> <b>linear</b> <b>element</b> (Adaline) followed by a multilayer perceptron (MLP). An important but difficult problem in designing such a cascade predictor is to determine the complexity of the networks. We solve this problem by using the predictive minimum description length (PMDL) principle to select the optimal numbers of input and hidden nodes. This approach results in a predictor with both good noise attenuation and excellent generalization capability. The optimized neural networks are used for predictive filtering of very noisy Rayleigh fading signals with 1. 8 -GHz carrier frequency. Our results show that the optimal neural predictor can provide smoothed in-phase and quadrature signals with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gains of about 12 and 7 dB at the urban mobile speeds of 5 and 50 km/h, respectively. The corresponding power signal SNR gains are about 11 and 5 dB. Therefore, the neural predictor is well suitable for power control applications where “delayless ” noise attenuation and efficient reduction of fast fading are required.

40|$|Noise rejection, {{handling}} the difficulties {{coming from the}} mathematical representation of the system under investigation and alleviation of structural or unstructural uncertainties constitute prime challenges that are frequently encountered {{in the practice of}} systems and control engineering. Designing a controller has primarily the aim of achieving the tracking precision as well as a degree of robustness against the difficulties stated. From this point of view, variable structure systems theory offer well formulated solutions to such ill-posed problems containing uncertainty and imprecision. In this paper, a simple controller structure is discussed. The architecture is known as <b>Adaptive</b> <b>Linear</b> <b>Element</b> (ADALINE) in the framework of neural computing. The parameters of the controller evolve dynamically in time such that a sliding motion is obtained. The inner sliding motion concerns the establishment of a sliding mode in controller parameters, which aims to minimize the error on the controller outputs. The outer sliding motion is designed for the plant. The algorithm discussed drives the error on the output of the controller toward zero learning error level, and the state tracking error vector of the plant is driven toward the origin of the phase space simultaneously. The paper gives the analysis of the equivalence between the two sliding motions and demonstrates the performance of the algorithm on a three degrees of freedom, anthropoid robotic manipulator. In order to clarify the performance of the scheme, together with the dynamic complexity of the plant, the adverse effects of observation noise and nonzero initial conditions are studied. �S 0022 - 0434 � 00 � 01704 - 4...|$|E
