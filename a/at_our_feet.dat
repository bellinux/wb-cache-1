500|$|Both Grand Forks and East Grand Forks had {{to decide}} whether to develop the land along the river. The {{president}} of the East Grand Forks planning-and-zoning commission commented on the idea of development, [...] "The river had been our friend for all these years. It had been like an old dog, sleeping comfortably <b>at</b> <b>our</b> <b>feet,</b> and then one day it jumped up and bit us. We {{had to decide}}: Do we put it to sleep or try to make amends?" [...] What were once entire neighborhoods are now covered by grass and trees, part of an extensive area of parkland called the Greater Grand Forks Greenway. In East Grand Forks, this transformation is especially visible. One former neighborhood is now a large campground, the center of what is now known as the Red River State Recreation Area. The cities of today are significantly different from their pre-flood state, but many residents are pleased with this, seeing it as fulfillment of President Bill Clinton's promise that the cities would [...] "rebuild stronger and better than ever." [...] Population estimates by the Census Bureau and by the city of Grand Forks itself now show a growing community.|$|E
2500|$|With the war {{effectively}} {{ended by}} the American {{victory at the}} Siege of Yorktown, Henry served as delegate from his county through 1784, {{when he was elected}} again as governor. Peace brought many adjustments, and Henry sponsored a number of pieces of legislation to reform Virginia's currency and to adjust payments from contracts still outstanding from before [...] periods of high inflation. Jefferson and others wanted to reopen contracts that had been already settled, but in depreciated currency; however, Henry thought that unjust, and because of his influence in the General Assembly, his version prevailed. This had international implications, as some of the creditors were British, who sought payment in hard money [...] rather than the depreciated currency that had been paid into escrow. At the May 1783 House of Delegates session, Henry successfully sponsored a resolution to repeal the trade embargo against Britain. That passed despite opposition from John Tyler Sr., the Speaker. Henry also introduced legislation to permit Loyalists to return to Virginia. There was considerable opposition to that, and the measure was held over until later in the year, by which time public sentiment had been gauged through meetings in each county. Henry spoke in the debate, asking [...] "shall we, who have laid the proud British lion <b>at</b> <b>our</b> <b>feet,</b> be frightened of its whelps?" [...] Once it was amended (though in what way is not clear), the bill passed in November 1783.|$|E

60|$|There was {{a little}} haze out to sea; for it had been very misty in the early morning, though the sun had thinned it. As we looked seawards we {{suddenly}} saw the sail of a small boat break out through the fog, and come bobbing along towards the land. A single man was seated in the sheets, and she yawed about as she ran, {{as though he were}} of two minds whether to beach her or no. At last, determined it may be by our presence, he made straight for us, and her keel grated upon the shingle <b>at</b> <b>our</b> very <b>feet.</b> He dropped his sail, sprang out, and pulled her bows up on the beach.|$|R
6000|$|My {{mother sat}} {{occupied}} chiefly {{with her own}} thoughts, and my aunt had found a congenial companion in a lady who had had her cap basket sat upon; so I was left mainly to my own resources. When I could get my head free of the big man's back, I gazed out of the window, and watched the flying fragments as we shed the world. Now a village would fall from us, now the yellow corn-land would cling to us for awhile, or a wood catch <b>at</b> <b>our</b> rushing <b>feet,</b> and sometimes a strong town would stop us, and hold us, panting for a space.

60|$|Just {{beneath us}} ran the Avon, curving in long bends through the woodlands, with {{the gleam of}} the sun {{striking}} back from it here and there, as though a row of baby suns had been set upon a silver string. On the further side the peaceful, many-hued country, rising and falling in a swell of cornfields and orchards, swept away to break in a fringe of forest upon the distant Malverns. On our right were the green hills near Bath and on our left the rugged Mendips, with queenly Bristol crouching behind her forts, and the grey channel behind flecked with snow-white sails. <b>At</b> <b>our</b> very <b>feet</b> lay Keynsham Bridge, and our army spotted in dark patches over the green fields, the smoke of their fires and the babble of their voices floating up in the still summer air.|$|R

Such a promised land is <b>at</b> <b>our</b> very <b>feet</b> which, when we attain it, will make our present civilisation seem barren and uncouth. Already our vanguard is well over the pass.

60|$|There are heights {{also that}} build up {{themselves}} in us, {{which are not}} but to be taken notice of: Yea, there are a many of them, and they place themselves directly so, that if possible they may keep the saving knowledge of God out of our hearts. These high things therefore are said to exalt themselves against the knowledge of God (2 Cor 10:5): and do ofttimes more plague, afflict, and frighten Christian men and women, than any thing besides. It is from these that our faith and spiritual understanding of God and his Christ is opposed and contradicted, and from these also that we are so inclinable to swerve from right doctrine into destructive opinions. 'Tis from these that we are so easily persuaded {{to call into question}} our former experience of the goodness of God towards us, and from these that our minds are so often clouded and darkened that we cannot see afar off. These would betray us into the hands of fallen angels, and men, nor should we by any means help or deliver ourselves, were it not for one that is higher.

The latter knew that the Britons can fight, and that, wild and untutored as they are, it needed all the skill and courage of Ostorius and Vespasian to reduce them to order. The newcomers regard them as slaves to be trampled upon, robbed, and ill used as they choose. I am sure they will find their mistake. As long as they deal only with the tribes thoroughly subdued, the Trinobantes, the Cantii, the Be1gae, and the Dumnonii, all may be quiet; they dare not move. But the Iceni and Brigantes, although they both have felt the weight of our swords, are still partly independent, and if pressed too severely will assuredly revolt, and if they give the signal all Britain may be up in arms again. I am scoffed at if I venture to hint to these newcomers that there is life yet in Britain. Dwelling here in a Roman city, it seems to them absurd that there can be danger from the savages who roam in the forests that stretch away from beyond the river <b>at</b> <b>our</b> very <b>feet</b> to the far distant north, to regions of which we are absolutely ignorant.

50|$|OGS {{helps people}} {{understand}} how to apply the geological knowledge about Ontario to address a range of public policy issues. The OGS is a public good organization. Its geological survey function is mandated by the Ontario Government. OGS has no regulatory responsibility. Ontario's geology includes: a) the rock (bedrock); b) the deposits of sand, gravel, and till left by the glaciers; c) the mineral resources and potential; d) the energy resource potential within the rocks and soils; and e) the groundwater aquifers that contain groundwater resources. An understanding of what is <b>at,</b> and below, <b>our</b> <b>feet</b> is fundamental to human existence on the Earth, to understand the environment and habitats, and our ability to adapt to future changes, such as global warming. This geological knowledge is used to assess Earth resource potential, to attract investment, to ensure {{the health and safety}} of Ontario people from geo-hazards, and to plan the present and future use of the land. The OGS also collaborates with Ontario's Aboriginal people to achieve a mutual understanding, mutual respect, and to achieve mutual interests. The OGS is a science-based organization that conducts field studies.|$|R
