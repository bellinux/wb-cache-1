5|$|Genetic {{recombination}} is {{the process}} by which <b>a</b> <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> DNA is broken and then joined {{to the end of a}} different DNA molecule. This can occur when viruses infect cells simultaneously and studies of viral evolution have shown that recombination has been rampant in the species studied. Recombination is common to both RNA and DNA viruses.|$|E
5|$|A Ghost Story for Christmas is <b>a</b> <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> annual British short {{television}} films originally {{broadcast on}} BBC One between 1971 and 1978, and revived in 2005 on BBC Four. With one exception, the original instalments were directed by Lawrence Gordon Clark and the films were all shot on 16mm colour film. The remit behind {{the series was}} to provide a television adaptation of a classic ghost story, in line with the oral tradition of telling supernatural tales at Christmas.|$|E
5|$|Morpholinos can {{interfere}} with pre-mRNA processing steps either by preventing splice-directing small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNP) complexes from binding to their targets at the borders of introns on <b>a</b> <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> pre-mRNA, or by blocking the nucleophilic adenine base and preventing it from forming the splice lariat structure, or by interfering with the binding of splice regulatory proteins such as splice silencers and splice enhancers. Preventing the binding of snRNP U1 (at the donor site) or U2/U5 (at the polypyrimidine moiety and acceptor site) can cause modified splicing, commonly excluding exons from the mature mRNA. Targeting some splice targets results in intron inclusions, while activation of cryptic splice sites can lead to partial inclusions or exclusions. Targets of U11/U12 snRNPs can also be blocked. Splice modification can be conveniently assayed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and {{is seen as a}} band shift after gel electrophoresis of RT-PCR products.|$|E

50|$|Necklaces {{can also}} be {{classified}} as uniform, or graduated. In <b>a</b> uniform <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> pearls, all pearls are classified as the same size, but actually fall in a range. <b>A</b> uniform <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> akoya pearls, for example, will measure within 0.5 mm. So <b>a</b> <b>strand</b> will never be 7 mm, but will be 6.5-7 mm. Freshwater pearls, Tahitian pearls, and South Sea pearls all measure to a full millimeter when considered uniform.|$|R
5|$|The {{backbone}} of the DNA strand is made from alternating phosphate and sugar residues. The sugar in DNA is 2-deoxyribose, which is a pentose (five-carbon) sugar. The sugars are joined together by phosphate groups that form phosphodiester bonds between the third and fifth carbon atoms of adjacent sugar rings. These asymmetric bonds mean <b>a</b> <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> DNA has a direction. In a double helix, {{the direction of the}} nucleotides in one strand is opposite to their direction in the other strand: the strands are antiparallel. The asymmetric ends of DNA strands are said to have a directionality of five prime (5′) and three prime (3′), with the 5′ end having a terminal phosphate group and the 3′ end a terminal hydroxyl group. One major difference between DNA and RNA is the sugar, with the 2-deoxyribose in DNA being replaced by the alternative pentose sugar ribose in RNA.|$|E

50|$|A primer is <b>a</b> short <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> RNA or DNA (generally about 18-22 bases) {{that serves}} as a {{starting}} point for DNA synthesis. It is required for DNA replication because the enzymes that catalyze this process, DNA polymerases, can only add new nucleotides to <b>an</b> existing <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> DNA. The polymerase starts replication at the 3'-end of the primer, and copies the opposite strand.|$|R

25|$|<b>A</b> <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> {{behavioral}} finance {{has been}} dubbed Quantitative Behavioral Finance, which uses mathematical and statistical methodology to understand behavioral biases in conjunction with valuation.

Studies by Jeff Madura, Ray Sturm and others have demonstrated significant behavioral effects in stocks and exchange traded funds. Among other topics, quantitative behavioral finance studies behavioral effects together with the non-classical assumption of the finiteness of assets.|$|E
