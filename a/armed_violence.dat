25|$|Another {{prevalent}} form {{of violence}} in slums is <b>armed</b> <b>violence</b> (gun violence), mostly existing in African and Latin American slums. It leads to homicide {{and the emergence of}} criminal gangs. Typical victims are male slum residents. Violence often leads to retaliatory and vigilante violence within the slum. Gang and drug wars are endemic in some slums, predominantly between male residents of slums. The police sometimes participate in gender-based violence against men as well by picking up some men, beating them and putting them in jail. Domestic violence against men also exists in slums, including verbal abuses and even physical violence from households.|$|E
25|$|The {{defeat of}} the Arab {{countries}} in the Six-Day War prompted fractured Palestinian political and militant groups to give up any remaining hope they had placed in pan-Arabism. In July 1968 armed, non-state actors such as Fatah and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine achieved {{the majority of the}} Palestinian National Council votes, and on February 3, 1969, at the Palestinian National Council in Cairo, the leader of the Fatah, Yasser Arafat was elected as the chairman of the PLO. From the start, the organization used <b>armed</b> <b>violence</b> against civilian and military targets in the conflict with Israel. The PLO tried to take over the population of the West Bank, but the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) deported them into Jordan, where they began to act against the Jordanian rule (Palestinians in Jordan comprised about 70% of the total population, which mostly consisted of refugees) and from there attacked Israel numerous times, using the infiltration of terrorists and shooting Katyusha rockets. This led to retaliations from Israel.|$|E

25|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the civil war, many of Somalia's residents left in search of asylum. According to the UNHCR, there were around 975,951 registered refugees from the country in neighboring states as of 2016. Additionally, 1.1 million people were internally displaced persons (IDPs). The majority of the IDPs were Bantus and other ethnic minorities originating from the southern regions, including those displaced in the north. An estimated 60% of the IDPs were children. Causes of the displacement included <b>armed</b> <b>violence,</b> periodic droughts, and other natural disasters, which, along with diverted aid flows, hindered the IDPs' access to safe shelter and resources. IDP settlements were concentrated in south-central Somalia (893,000), followed by the northern Puntland (129,000) and Somaliland (84,000) regions. Additionally, there were around 9,356 registered refugees and 11,157 registered asylum seekers in Somalia. Most of these foreign nationals emigrated from Yemen to northern Somalia after the Houthi insurgency in 2015. However, the majority of emigrants to Somalia consist of Somali expatriates, who have returned to Mogadishu and other urban areas for investment opportunities and {{to take part in the}} ongoing post-conflict reconstruction process.|$|E

50|$|The {{extent to}} which illicit trade in small arms is a primary cause of armed {{conflict}} and other serious humanitarian and socioeconomic issues has drawn controversy. The extremely high instance of small <b>arms</b> <b>violence</b> {{and the presence of}} illicitly obtained weapons, especially in areas of turmoil and armed conflict, is undisputed. Because other societal factors play a strong role in creating armed conflict, however, the role of such weapons as a driver of continued violence and disruption has been called into question. Recent scholarship has focused on the root societal causes for violence in addition to the enabling tools. Another target of criticism is the ability to regulate illicit trafficking through international means, since it is unclear exactly what proportion of the weapons are trafficked across borders. The nature of the trafficking enterprise makes exact statistics difficult to determine. Recently, however, researchers have had some success establishing hard numbers within limited parameters.|$|R

40|$|This multi-disciplinary seminar {{analyzes}} {{the advantages and}} limitations of a public health perspective on different categories of violence.

Readings in this course will draw on formal academic texts, writings by public intellectuals, reports from governmental agencies and civil society organizations, as well as coverage in the media. We will also work with on-line databases and view documentaries and other materials designed to raise awareness and inspire action to reduce violence. The writing-intensive course is structured as a tutorial, in which groups of 3 students will meet weekly to discuss the readings in depth. The make-up and timing of these sessions will be determined {{at the beginning of}} the second week of the semester. In addition, we will hold occasional meetings of the entire class on Tuesday afternoons, as indicated in the syllabus...|$|R

2500|$|Structural {{violence}} is often embedded in longstanding social structures, ubiquitous throughout the globe, that are regularized by persistent institutions and regular experience with them. These social structures seem so normal {{in our understanding}} of the world that they are almost invisible, but inequality in resource access, political power, education, healthcare, and legal standing are all possible perpetrators of structural violence. Structural violence occurs [...] "whenever persons are harmed, maimed, or killed by poverty and unjust social, political, and economic institutions, systems, or structures" [...] Structural violence can contribute to worse health outcomes through either harming or killing victims, just like <b>armed</b> <b>violence</b> can have these effects. This type of unintended harm perpetuated by structural violence progressively promotes misery and hunger that eventually results in death, among other effects. Ehrlich and Ehrlich reported in 1970 that between 10 and 20 million of the 60 million annual deaths across the globe result from starvation and malnutrition. Their report also estimated that structural violence was responsible for the end of one billion lives between 1948 and 1967 in the third world.|$|E
2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the new year, on 1 January 49, Curio returned to Rome from Caesar, bringing with him a letter, which Caesar's new tribunes Marcus Antonius and Lucius Cassius read aloud in the senate. Afterwards, the senate once again voted on a notion to strip Caesar of his army and have him returned to Rome, which carried. Negotiations between the two camps followed, led by Cicero, who was waiting outside the city limits for his triumph. After the negotiations had not brought a solution, the senate repeated its vote on 7 January, which was immediately met with a veto by the two tribunes. It was in this situation that the senate passed the senatus consultum ultimum to break the tribune's resistance and act against Caesar, at the same time declaring him an enemy of the state (hostis). Being warned about the fate of their predecessors in office, the two tribunes of the plebs fled the city the same night. Caesar got word of the SCU on 10 January while in Ravenna, crossing the Rubicon and taking Ariminum the next day, where he met Antonius and Cassius. Here, he addressed his troops and used the tribunes as living proof to legitimise his actions, calling the SCU a [...] "new example" [...] (novum exemplum) not in accordance with Roman Law. He argued that not even Sulla had dared to touch the right of a tribune to cast his veto, as the senate had done now under the threat of <b>armed</b> <b>violence</b> (armis). With these events, the Great Roman Civil War had begun.|$|E
2500|$|The IDF {{claims that}} {{targeted}} killings are only pursued {{to prevent future}} terrorism acts, not as revenge for past activities as such they are not extrajudicial. The IDF also claims that this practice is only used when {{there is absolutely no}} practical way of foiling the future acts by other means (e.g., arrest) with minimal risk to its soldiers or civilians. The IDF also claims that the practice is only used when there is a certainty in the identification of the target, in order to minimize harm to innocent bystanders. They argue that because many of the Palestinians who have targeted Israel over the years have enjoyed the protection of Arab governments, extraditing them for trial in Israel has often proved impossible. They argue that Israeli governments have long used targeted killings as a last resort, when there were no peaceful options for bringing suspected terrorists to account. In a 2010 article in Infinity Journal, it was argued that targeted killings are a strategy that entails [...] "limited, force in support of policy" [...] and that the strategy has proven to work, albeit within specific contexts. The context of the Infinity Journal article related specifically to Hamas' calls for ceasefires and [...] "calms" [...] in 2004 after the majority of their leadership had been successfully targeted by Israeli forces. According to the article, [...] "Targeted Killings Work", Israeli targeted killings throughout [...] "the 2000–2005 armed rebellion represented a successful strategy" [...] because [...] "the tactics never undermined Israeli policy enough to alter Israel’s overall political objectives" [...] and because Hamas' will to continue with <b>armed</b> <b>violence</b> was temporarily broken.|$|E
