5|$|October 9, 1804 — Heavy snow {{falls in}} Eastern New York peaking at 30 inches (75 cm) as a {{hurricane}} tracks northward along the East Coast and becomes extratropical, <b>as</b> <b>cold</b> air {{fed into the}} system.|$|E
5|$|TRH is {{secreted}} at {{an increased}} rate in situations such <b>as</b> <b>cold</b> exposure {{in order to}} stimulate thermogenesis. In addition to being suppressed {{by the presence of}} thyroid hormones, TSH production is blunted by dopamine, somatostatin, and glucocorticoids.|$|E
5|$|Upon death, whale {{carcasses}} fall to {{the deep}} ocean and provide a substantial habitat for marine life. Evidence of whale falls in present-day and fossil records shows that deep sea whale falls support a rich assemblage of creatures, with a global diversity of 407 species, comparable to other neritic biodiversity hotspots, such <b>as</b> <b>cold</b> seeps and hydrothermal vents.|$|E

50|$|Otitis {{media is}} a {{particularly}} common cause of otalgia in early childhood, often occurring secondary to other infectious illnesses, such <b>as</b> <b>colds,</b> coughs, or conjunctivitis.|$|R
5|$|Convective rain, or showery precipitation, occurs from {{convective}} clouds (e.g., cumulonimbus or cumulus congestus). It falls as showers with {{rapidly changing}} intensity. Convective precipitation falls over a certain {{area for a}} relatively short time, as convective clouds have limited horizontal extent. Most precipitation in the tropics appears to be convective; however, {{it has been suggested}} that stratiform precipitation also occurs. Graupel and hail indicate convection. In mid-latitudes, convective precipitation is intermittent and often associated with baroclinic boundaries such <b>as</b> <b>cold</b> fronts, squall lines, and warm fronts.|$|E
5|$|Cyclogenesis {{describes}} {{the process of}} cyclone formation and intensification. Extratropical cyclones begin as waves in large regions of enhanced mid-latitude temperature contrasts called baroclinic zones. These zones contract and form weather fronts as the cyclonic circulation closes and intensifies. Later in their life cycle, extratropical cyclones occlude <b>as</b> <b>cold</b> air masses undercut the warmer air and become cold core systems. A cyclone's track is guided {{over the course of}} its 2 to 6 day life cycle by the steering flow of the subtropical jet stream.|$|E
5|$|For pilots, {{knowledge}} of the sky cover helps determine if visual flight rules (VFR) are being met. Knowing the degree of cloud cover can help {{determine whether or not}} various weather fronts, such <b>as</b> <b>cold</b> fronts or warm fronts, have passed by a location. A nephanalysis, contouring areas that are cloudy with scalloped lines, can be performed to indicate a system's cloud and precipitation pattern. This technique is rarely performed nowadays, due to the prevalence of satellite imagery worldwide.|$|E
50|$|A {{study in}} Japan {{has shown that}} gargling water {{a few times a}} day will lower the chance of upper {{respiratory}} infections such <b>as</b> <b>colds,</b> though some medical authorities are skeptical.|$|R

5|$|Musicians {{and critics}} {{vary in their}} {{appraisal}} of Tristano as a musician. Some describe his playing <b>as</b> <b>cold</b> and suggest that his innovations had little impact; others state {{that he was a}} bridge between bebop and later, freer forms of jazz, and assert that he is less appreciated than he should be because commentators found him hard to categorize and because he chose not to commercialize.|$|E
5|$|The {{electron}} transport pathways {{produced by}} these alternative NADH and ubiquinone oxidases have lower ATP yields than the full pathway. The advantages {{produced by a}} shortened pathway are not entirely clear. However, the alternative oxidase is produced in response to stresses such <b>as</b> <b>cold,</b> reactive oxygen species, and infection by pathogens, {{as well as other}} factors that inhibit the full electron transport chain. Alternative pathways might, therefore, enhance an organisms' resistance to injury, by reducing oxidative stress.|$|E
5|$|An active trough of low {{pressure}} exited the East Coast of the United States on May 12, {{and by the}} following day it passed near Bermuda. Initially the trough was located only near the surface, though <b>as</b> <b>cold</b> air from behind it advanced eastward, the trough extended into the mid- to upper-levels of the atmosphere. By May 14 a closed {{low pressure}} area developed in seclusion from the westerlies. Continued cold air from behind the trough, about 12°F (7°C) colder than usual for the time of year, extended across the low in conjunction with warm upper levels and warm sea surface temperatures, resulting in large amounts of instability. The polar trough gradually weakened as the low organized, and on May 15 it developed into a subtropical depression while located about 300miles (480km) south of Bermuda.|$|E

5|$|An area of low {{pressure}} tracked across southeastern Canada during the 12th, which brought an arctic front across the Mid Atlantic region {{late on the}} 12th. As this occurred, a strong area of high pressure located across central Canada built down into the Northeast, allowing very cold air to spill southward ultimately leading to what is known <b>as</b> <b>cold</b> air damming. This occurs east of the mountains down through the Mid Atlantic states. Meanwhile, a Pacific storm slammed onto the California coast during the 11th and as it moved eastward, a new area of {{low pressure}} developed across southeastern Colorado and the Texas Panhandle.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of several processes—diffusion and {{interchange}} instability being the main escape mechanisms—the plasma slowly leaks away from Jupiter. As the plasma moves further from the planet, the radial currents flowing within it gradually increase its velocity, maintaining co-rotation. These radial currents are also {{the source of the}} magnetic field's azimuthal component, which as a result bends back against the rotation. The particle number density of the plasma decreases from around 2,000cm−3 in the Io torus to about 0.2cm−3 at a distance of 35RJ. In the middle magnetosphere, at distances greater than 20RJ from Jupiter, co-rotation gradually breaks down and the plasma begins to rotate more slowly than the planet. Eventually at the distances greater than 40RJ (in the outer magnetosphere) this plasma escapes the magnetic field completely and leaves the magnetosphere through the magnetotail. <b>As</b> <b>cold,</b> dense plasma moves outward, it is replaced by hot, low-density plasma (temperature 20keV (200millionK) or higher) moving from the outer magnetosphere. This plasma, adiabatically heated as it approaches Jupiter, forms the radiation belts in Jupiter's inner magnetosphere.|$|E
5|$|Flight Unlimited III is a {{three-dimensional}} (3D) flight simulator video game, {{in which the}} player pilots virtual reproductions of real-world planes. Players may control ten aircraft: the Lake Turbo Renegade, Stemme S10, Mooney Bravo, Fokker Dr.I, Beechjet 400A and five planes first included in Flight Unlimited II. Plane cockpits feature simulated flight instruments such as variometers and primary flight displays, and allow for both visual and instrument navigation. The main airspace is 10,000 square miles of Seattle terrain; eight other Western American states are modeled as well, albeit in less detail. The California scenery from Flight Unlimited II may be imported to expand the airspace. The player shares the game's skies with artificially intelligent (AI) planes. Real-time, interactive air traffic control monitors the player's actions and tries to prevent mid-air collisions. Before a flight, the player may select which types of weather to encounter. Weather conditions such <b>as</b> <b>cold</b> fronts and thunderstorms develop in real-time.|$|E

Infection will not spread between musicians unless there is contact with the bacteria.|$|R
5|$|Inga {{accelerated}} somewhat as {{it passed}} to the southeast of Bermuda. By the morning hours of October 5, {{it was determined that}} the hurricane posed no significant threat to the island. At 1200 UTC, the storm's lowest known barometric pressure of 964 millibars was recorded. Shortly thereafter, it briefly strengthened to Category 3 status; the cyclone peaked with maximum sustained winds of 115mph (185km/h). As it moved towards the open waters of the Atlantic and entered a cooler environment, it deteriorated to Category 1 intensity on October 6. The hurricane slowed again, and <b>as</b> <b>cold</b> air became entrained into its circulation, it began to lose tropical characteristics.|$|E
5|$|Moreover, {{working under}} {{commission}} from the Farnese family, Titian {{would not have}} sought to portray the sitters in an obviously unsympathetic manner. While Paul is shown as old and frail, he is given a broad chest and cunning eyes that indicate his intelligence and guile. Ottavio is presented <b>as</b> <b>cold</b> and impervious, but this was probably a device to show his strength of character and conviction. Alessandro is favoured by his positioning closest to the Pope, yet x-ray analysis reveals he had originally stood {{to the left of}} the pope and was moved, probably on request by Alessandro himself, to a position where his hand was resting on the papal throne, indicating his claim on the papacy.|$|E
5|$|NATO's 2004 Istanbul summit {{was also}} remarkably {{silent on the}} subject of nuclear weapons policy and non-proliferation, as opposed to pre-summit {{diplomacy}} and earlier post-Cold War NATO summits and contrary to the demonstrations going on in Istanbul. In June 2004, shortly before the summit, NATO issued two fact sheets on nuclear policy, portraying the developments within NATO in a favourable light in the run up to the 2005 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference. In practice, no real changes {{since the end of the}} Cold War were implemented, as since the 1994 US Nuclear posture review the number of US nuclear weapons based in Europe remained unchanged, and <b>as</b> <b>Cold</b> War nuclear sharing arrangements dating back to the 1960s remained in force. Additionally, no changes were made to Alliance nuclear policy since the 1999 Strategic Concept.|$|E

5|$|Reviewer Jennifer Malkowski {{feels that}} Lana {{is one of}} the most gullible {{characters}} on television. According to Malkowski, Lana's strong feminist stance, and her request that people should stop protecting her and start telling her the truth, are diluted by her willingness to believe whatever pieces of information she gets, even if they are lies. After the series ended, Gough and Millar expressed regret with Lana's characterization throughout the course of the show, which they felt damaged Lana in the audiences' mind. Gough and Millar believed that Lana's behavior toward Clark (for refusing to reveal his secret) made her come across <b>as</b> <b>cold</b> and unsympathetic.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after peaking, {{the western}} {{portion of the}} central dense overcast, or the area of high, thick clouds around the eye, began to deteriorate, and Hurricane Kate started to weaken. On October 5, the storm dropped below major {{hurricane}} status. Kate turned sharply northward due to it moving around the western periphery of a powerful anticyclone, and consequently slowed its forward motion. It slowly weakened as it turned to the north-northeast, with an eye occasionally re-appearing on satellite images. On October 7, however, Kate weakened to a tropical storm while moving over cooler waters. It accelerated to the northeast, and after passing about 260mi (420km) east of Newfoundland, Kate became extratropical <b>as</b> <b>cold</b> air clouds entrained the center. The system remained a powerful system, and later on October 8 the extratropical remnant of Kate retained winds of up to 75mph (140km/h) while passing south of Greenland. The storm turned to the east, passed a short distance south of Iceland, and merged with another extratropical storm near Scandinavia on October 10.|$|E
5|$|Surface {{decompression}} is {{a procedure}} {{in which some}} or all of the staged decompression obligation is done in a decompression chamber instead of in the water. This reduces the time that the diver spends in the water, exposed to environmental hazards such <b>as</b> <b>cold</b> water or currents, which will enhance diver safety. The decompression in the chamber is more controlled, in a more comfortable environment, and oxygen can be used at greater partial pressure as there is no risk of drowning and a lower risk of oxygen toxicity convulsions. A further operational advantage is that once the divers are in the chamber, new divers can be supplied from the diving panel, and the operations can continue with less delay.|$|E
