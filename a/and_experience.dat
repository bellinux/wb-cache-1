40|$|This thesis {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} if paranormal beliefs <b>and</b> <b>experiences</b> represent signs of psychological ill-health {{or if they}} are neutral regarding psychological health. A further aim was to validate subjective paranormal experiences. The {{first part of the}} thesis compares two models for the construct schizotypy, a quasi-dimensional model and a fully dimensional model in the context of psychological health. The former views paranormal beliefs <b>and</b> <b>experiences</b> as pathological whereas the fully dimensional model is unbiased regarding health. Individuals were grouped according to their scores on a multi-dimensional schizotypy measure, the Oxford-Liverpool Inventory of Feelings <b>and</b> <b>Experiences</b> Scale (Mason, Claridge & Jackson, 1995). The schizotypy groups were compared regarding two mental health-related measures, the Sense of Coherence Scale (Antonovsky, 1991) and the Eysenck Personality Inventory (Bederoff-Petersson, Jägtoft & Åström, 1971) Neuroticism sub-scale, and a measure of paranormal beliefs <b>and</b> <b>experiences,</b> the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale (Thalbourne & Delin, 1993). The results support the fully dimensional schizotypy model. Noteworthy, a group of people {{with a high level of}} paranormal beliefs <b>and</b> <b>experiences</b> also reported a high level of sense of coherence in conjunction with low neuroticism, which signifies psychological health rather than ill-health. The second part of the thesis was designed to validate subjective paranormal experiences in the laboratory, where a Ganzfeld paradigm was used to induce psi. The psi Ganzfeld result was non-significant. Individual differences between successful and unsuccessful participants were investigated to explore the association between psi success and psychological health. The results of this thesis show that the relationships between the subjective reports of health-related sense of coherence, neuroticism, and subjective reports of strong paranormal beliefs <b>and</b> <b>experiences</b> are complex. It seems more likely that strong paranormal beliefs <b>and</b> <b>experiences</b> together with an inability to experience pleasure or cognitive disorganisation are related to perceived ill-health rather than strong paranormal beliefs <b>and</b> <b>experiences</b> on their own. The results support the notion of healthy schizotypy and the conclusion that paranormal beliefs <b>and</b> <b>experiences</b> should be viewed as neutral regarding mental health...|$|R

5|$|If the player's {{character}} {{falls in}} battle, {{they are forced}} to restart from the beginning, with all their items <b>and</b> <b>experience</b> points gone; to avoid this, the player can store items in warehouses found in towns they travel through. Because of this, the player makes long-term progress by upgrading powerful items at village blacksmiths and storing them in warehouses, while upgrading their character is more of a temporary improvement. In the Nintendo DS version of the game, the player can avoid having to start over by getting rescued by another player: this is done by giving the other player a rescue quest, either through a password or the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. When a player embarks on a rescue mission, they start from level 1 and have to reach the fallen character without stopping at towns on their way. If they succeed, the rescued player can proceed from where they left off, and keep their items <b>and</b> <b>experience</b> points.|$|E
