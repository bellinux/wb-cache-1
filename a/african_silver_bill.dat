40|$|Background. Under the tropics, {{less than}} 40 % of known fishes are {{identified}} to species-level. Further, the ongoing global change poses unprecedented threat to biodiversity, and several taxa {{are likely to}} go extinct even before they could be described. Traditional ecological theory suggests that species would escape extinction risk posed by global threats (e. g., climate change) only by migrating to new environments. In this study, we hypothesise that micro-evolutionary changes (evolution within species and populations) are also important mechanisms {{for the survival of}} Schilbe intermedius in Africa, a continent subjected to uneven distribution of climate severity. Materials and methods. Using the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene, known as animal DNA barcode, we tested this hypothesis by analysing the genetic diversity and phylogenetic relations between seven populations of S. intermedius across different African river systems. Results. We reveal a clear geographical patterning in genetic variations, with three clear clusters (southern Africa, eastern Africa, and western Africa). In southern Africa, the South African population is distinct from that of Namibia and Botswana. In addition, within Nigerian populations of silver catfish, two sub-clusters emerged from two isolated river systems. We suggest that the phylogeographic pattern within <b>African</b> <b>silver</b> catfish populations mirror the past effects of selection and gene flow, and that the split within Nigerian silver catfish populations might be the result of micro-evolutionary adaptive responses to local selection pressures. Conclusion. We suggest that the strong genetic difference in <b>African</b> <b>silver</b> catfish among geographically isolated river systems might be the result of in situ micro-evolutionary adaptive responses to changing environments, and that DNA barcode has potential beyond species delimitation...|$|R

40|$|During the mid- 19 th century, {{the opium}} trade in China caused a massive out-flow of Qing silver currency, {{and as a}} result drove up the silver price. Conversely, the Qing market was brimming with foreign silver dollars. Rising silver prices, coupled with the large amount of foreign silver {{flooding}} the Chinese market seriously undermined the old minted silver system. In 1896, Zhang Zhidong （張之洞）, the governor of Hubei and Hunan province, introduced banknotes from Japan in order to address this problem. The imported bills proved very popular among the public, and were circulated widely. In 1902 the Qing government was required to pay an indemnity to the western powers affected by the Boxer rebellion. The monetary situation was tight and the silver coinage was insufficient. Yu Liansan （俞廉三）, the newly appointed governor of Hunan, decided to found the Hunan Currency Bureau by means of issuing official banknotes. The success of Zhang Zhidong in the introduction of Japanese made banknotes in Hubei proved an example for Yu. He ordered banknotes from Japan before the establishment of the Hunan Currency Bureau: the one Yuan <b>silver</b> dollar <b>bill,</b> （「壹圓」銀元票）, one Liang <b>silver</b> <b>bill</b> （「壹両」銀両票）, and the one Chuan Wen official bill （「壹串文」製銭票）.
