5|$|By {{the early}} years of the 20th century, Boyce had become a multi-millionaire <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> a step back from his {{businesses}} to pursue his interests in civic affairs, devoting more time to traveling and participating in expeditions. In 1909, he embarked on a two-month trip to Europe and a large photographic expedition to Africa with photographer George R. Lawrence and cartoonist John T. McCutcheon. Over the next two decades, Boyce led expeditions to South America, Europe, and North Africa, where he visited the newly discovered tomb of King Tutankhamun.|$|E

5|$|The country's {{military}} and economic might declined after the Asen dynasty ended in 1257, facing internal conflicts, constant Byzantine and Hungarian attacks and Mongol domination. By {{the end of the}} 14th century, factional divisions between the feudal landlords and the spread of Bogomilism had caused the Second Bulgarian Empire to split into three tsardoms—Vidin, Tarnovo and Karvuna—and several semi-independent principalities that fought each other, along with Byzantines, Hungarians, Serbs, Venetians and Genoese. By the late 14th century the Ottoman Turks had started their conquest of Bulgaria <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> most towns and fortresses south of the Balkan mountains.|$|E

5|$|Bokhary was {{involved}} in a second altercation at around 3am on 13 July 2008, again in Central. Short of cash with which to pay the HK$17.80 taxi fare, she proffered her credit card. When the taxi driver refused, Bokhary angrily flung her credit card in the driver's face; she kicked him when he prevented her from leaving the scene. The police were called. As she was being questioned by the two officers, Bokhary struck one of them. She {{was arrested and charged with}} common assault and assaulting a police officer. She was on medication <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> wine prior to the incident. Pleading guilty to both charges in November 2008, she was sentenced to 240 hours of community service and ordered to pay the driver HK$1,000 in compensation.|$|E

During the night, however, the ironclad Monitor had arrived <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> a position to defend Minnesota. When Virginia approached, Monitor intercepted her. The two ironclads fought for about three hours, with neither being able to inflict significant damage on the other. The duel ended indecisively, Virginia returning to her home at the Gosport Navy Yard for repairs and strengthening, and Monitor to her station defending Minnesota. The ships did not fight again, and the blockade remained in place.|$|E
5|$|Harrison {{left the}} {{territory}} for business in Kentucky {{shortly after the}} meeting with Tecumseh, and secretary John Gibson was acting governor. Gibson, who had lived among the Miami tribe for many years, was quick to learn of Tecumseh's plans for war; he immediately called out the territory's militia and sent emergency letters calling {{for the return of}} Harrison. By mid-September, most of the militia regiments had formed. By then, Harrison had returned, accompanied by a small force of army regulars, <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> command of the militia. Harrison had already communicated with his superiors in Washington, D.C., and he had been authorized to march against the confederacy in a show of force, in the hopes that its members would accept peace.|$|E
5|$|In March 1997, NSB {{announced}} that they had plans to privatize {{the operations of the}} line from 1998. The responsibility for setting the schedule, selling tickets and marketing was transferred to Flåm Utvikling, a newly established company that NSB owned 49 percent of, and Aurland Ressursutvikling 51 percent. The latter was owned by Aurland Municipality, the Industrial Development Corporation of Norway and Aurland Sparebank, a local bank. Flåm Utvikling also took over responsibility for other tourism-related activities in Flåm, such as port facilities. NSB would still operate the trains, and Flåm Utvikling would pay NSB the cost of running the trains, but keep the profits from the ticket sales. The Norwegian National Rail Administration, which had been established in 1996 <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> over the responsibility for infrastructure, retained ownership of the line itself. Flåm Utvikling also started building a cruise ship terminal at Flåm, so tourists could walk ashore and directly to the trains.|$|E

In Massasoit's first {{contact with the}} English, several men of his tribe {{had been killed in}} an unprovoked attack by English sailors. He also knew of the Pilgrims' theft of the corn stores in their landings at Provincetown. Squanto had been abducted in 1614 by English explorer Thomas Hunt and had spent five years in Europe, first as a slave for a group of Spanish monks, then in England. He had returned to New England in 1619, acting as a guide to explorer Capt. Robert Gorges. Massasoit and his men had massacred the crew of the ship <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> in Squanto.|$|E
5|$|Newspaper {{headlines}} in most World Cup nations trumpeted the shocking upset, except ironically in the United States and England. There {{was only one}} American journalist at the World Cup: Dent McSkimming of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch; he could not persuade the newspaper {{to pay for the}} trip, <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> time off work to cover the event. His report of the match was the only one to appear in any major American newspaper. In England, newspapers at the time were generally small, and only had a single page devoted to sports. Because the English cricket team happened to suffer their first-ever defeat by the West Indies the very same day, that was the major story in most publications. Legend has it that in publications that did report the World Cup match, so unexpected was the result that it was presumed that the 1–0 scoreline was a typing error and so it was reported that England had won on a scoreline of 10–0 or 10–1. However, historical newspapers online at The British Newspaper Archive show that the story is a myth.|$|E
5|$|On 12 December 1943, General Vokes {{sent the}} three battalions of the 3rd Canadian Infantry Brigade against German defences in The Gully. The assault started poorly, when Canadian {{artillery}} plans were captured by {{soldiers of the}} 90th Panzergrenadier Division's 200th Regiment. When The West Nova Scotia Regiment attacked The Gully, they were subject to counterattacks by the 200th Panzergrenadier Regiment approximately 10:30. By 14:00, the regiment had called off its attacks <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> heavy casualties. To the west, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry fared little better, with C Company taking heavy casualties in their assault. Attempts were again made on 13 December, by two battalions of the 3rd Canadian Infantry Brigade, and the attacks were driven back by tenacious German resistance. On the evening of 13 December, the heavily depleted 90th Panzergrenadier Division were relieved from their positions in The Gully by units of the 1st Parachute Division.|$|E

5|$|The Princess Theatre opened as a single-screen cinema on March 8, 1915 to rave reviews. It {{had cost}} McKernan CDN$75,000 <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> 10 months to build, longer than expected. The theatre opened with 660 seats {{and the largest}} live {{performance}} stage in a cinema west of Winnipeg. It {{was at the time}} the only cinema on Edmonton’s south side, and would keep that title until the opening of the Garneau Theatre in 1940. Opening night was a benefit concert for The Imperial Order of the Daughters of the Empire, associated with the 19th Alberta Dragoons, B Squad. The program proudly included newsreels “featuring actual war scenes”. In audience were the Lt. Governor and Mayor W.T. Henry. The house’s first feature film, The Eagle’s Mate starring Mary Pickford, was screened the following night.|$|E
5|$|The ultraconservatives {{who opposed}} the Conciliation policy were led by the Viscount of Itaboraí, Eusébio de Queirós and the Viscount of Uruguai. These elder statesmen were of the same {{generation}} as the late Carneiro Leão <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> {{the leadership of the}} Conservative Party after his death. Although conservative in name, they had repeatedly proven more progressive in many areas than their rivals, the Liberals. The Viscount of Uruguai had been Paranhos's protector since the 1851 diplomatic mission and greatly influenced his protégé, who stood by the ultraconservatives. Paranhos managed to persuade Luis Alves de Lima e Silva (who had been commander-in-chief during the Platine War, his colleague as War Minister in the Conciliation Cabinet, and later the Duke of Caxias) to stay {{on the side of the}} Conservative Party's old guard.|$|E

5|$|Uxbridge {{recorded}} that {{he tried}} to lead the Dutch Carabiniers, under Major-General Trip, to renew the attack and that they refused to follow him. Other members of the British cavalry staff also commented on this occurrence. However, there is no support for this incident in Dutch or Belgian sources. Meanwhile, Bachelu's and Tissot's men and their cavalry supports were being hard hit by fire from artillery and from Adam's infantry brigade, and they eventually fell back. Although the French cavalry caused few direct casualties to Wellington's centre, artillery fire onto his infantry squares caused many. Wellington's cavalry, except for Sir John Vandeleur's and Sir Hussey Vivian's brigades on the far left, had all been committed to the fight, <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> significant losses. The situation appeared so desperate that the Cumberland Hussars, the only Hanoverian cavalry regiment present, fled the field spreading alarm all the way to Brussels.|$|E
5|$|Vast {{expanses of}} Rus' lands, {{including}} the Dnieper River basin and territories extending {{south to the}} Black Sea, were at that time under Lithuanian control. In order {{to gain control of}} these vast holdings, Lithuania had fought the Battle of Blue Waters in 1362 or 1363 against the invading Mongols <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> advantage of the power vacuum to the south and east that resulted from the Mongol destruction of Kievan Rus'. The population of the Grand Duchy's enlarged territory was accordingly heavily Ruthenian and Eastern Orthodox. The territorial expansion led to a confrontation between Lithuania and the Grand Duchy of Moscow, which found itself emerging from the Tatar rule and itself in a process of expansion. Uniquely in Europe, the union connected two states geographically located on the opposite sides of the great civilizational divide between the Western Christian or Latin world, and the Eastern Christian or Byzantine world.|$|E
5|$|With 9:28 {{remaining}} in the quarter, Nebraska's second possession of the game mirrored its first. The Cornhuskers picked up a first down on a Scott Frost throw, but were unable to gain another after being stopped for a loss on one play and had to punt. Following the kick, Virginia Tech took over at its 28-yard line. The Hokies performed better than their first possession, picking up a quick first down on two rushes by Oxendine. Druckenmiller then completed a first-down throw that pushed the Hokies into Nebraska territory for a second time. Druckenmiller rushed for eight yards on the next play, then ran an option with Oxendine that saw the players combine for 20 yards and a first down. Now at the Nebraska 20-yard line, Oxendine ran for a yard, pushing the Hokies into the red zone. On the first play inside the Nebraska red zone, Druckenmiller completed a 19-yard pass to Marcus Parker for a Virginia Tech touchdown—the game's first points. Virginia Tech placekicker Shayne Graham kicked the extra point, and Virginia Tech took a 70 lead with 3:14 {{remaining in}} the first quarter. The drive covered 72 yards <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> eight plays and 4:06 of game time.|$|E
