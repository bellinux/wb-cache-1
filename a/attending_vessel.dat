6000|$|One day, {{soon after}} the men had {{commenced}} work, it began to blow hard, and {{the crew of the}} boat belonging to the <b>attending</b> <b>vessel,</b> named the [...] "Smeaton," [...] fearing that her moorings might be insufficient, went off to examine them. This was wrong. The workmen on the rock were sufficiently numerous to completely fill three boats. For one of these to leave the rock was to run a great risk, as the event proved. Almost as soon as they reached the [...] "Smeaton," [...] her cables parted and she went adrift, carrying the boat with her away to leeward, and although sail was instantly made, they found it impossible to regain the rock against wind and tide. Mr Stevenson observed this with the deepest anxiety, but the men, (busy as bees about the rock), were not aware of it at first.|$|E
60|$|The {{barometer}} {{for some}} days past had been falling from 29.90, and to-day it was 29.50, {{with the wind}} at N.E., which, {{in the course of}} this day, increased to a strong gale accompanied with a sea which broke with great violence upon the rock. At twelve noon the tender rode very heavily at her moorings, when her chain broke at about ten fathoms from the ship's bows. The kedge-anchor was immediately let go, to hold her till the floating buoy and broken chain should be got on board. But while this was in operation the hawser of the kedge was chafed through on the rocky bottom and parted, when the vessel was again adrift. Most fortunately, however, she cast off with her head from the rock, and narrowly cleared it, when she sailed up the Firth of Forth to wait the return of better weather. The artificers were thus left upon the rock with so heavy a sea running that it was ascertained to have risen to the height of eighty feet on the building. Under such perilous circumstances it would be difficult to describe the feelings of those who, at this time, were cooped up in the beacon in so forlorn a situation, with the sea not only raging under them, but occasionally falling from a great height upon the roof of their temporary lodging, without even the <b>attending</b> <b>vessel</b> in view to afford the least gleam of hope in the event of any accident. It is true that they had now the masonry of the lighthouse to resort to, which, no doubt, lessened the actual danger of their situation; but the building was still without a roof, and the deadlights, or storm-shutters, not being yet fitted, the windows of the lower story were stove in and broken, and at high-water the sea ran in considerable quantities out at the entrance door.|$|E
40|$|Bycatch in {{longline}} fisheries {{threatens the}} viability of some seabird populations. The Hawaii longline swordfish fishery reduced seabird captures by {{an order of magnitude}} primarily through mitigating bycatch during setting. Now, 75 % of captures occur during hauling. We fit observer data to a generalized additive regression model with mixed effects to determine the significance of the effect of various factors on the standardized seabird haul catch rate. Density of albatrosses <b>attending</b> <b>vessels</b> during hauling, leader length and year had largest model effects. The standardized haul catch rate significantly increased with increased albatross density during hauling. The standardized catch rate was significantly higher the longer the leader: shorter leaders place weighted swivels closer to hooks, reducing the likelihood of baited hooks becoming available to surface-scavenging albatrosses. There was a significant linear increasing temporal trend in the standardized catch rate, possibly partly due to an observed increasing temporal trend in the local abundance of albatrosses <b>attending</b> <b>vessels</b> during hauling. Swivel weight, Beaufort scale and season were also significant but smaller model effects. Most (81 %) haul captures were on branchlines actively being retrieved. Future haul mitigation research should therefore focus on reducing bird access to hooks as crew coil branchlines, including methods identified here of shorter leaders an...|$|R

40|$|We {{conducted}} a survey to investigate the factors influencing the number of seabirds <b>attending</b> a research <b>vessel</b> during scientific trawling activities near the northern Antarctic Peninsula. Our objective was to assess whether seabirds exhibited varying levels of attendance that {{may be attributed to}} fishing activity. Counts of seabirds <b>attending</b> the <b>vessel</b> were made during non-fishing periods, net deployment, towing and retrieving. We also monitored environmental variables (e. g. pressure, wind speed and direction) and discards of fish and offal to determine whether those variables could be used to explain variability in seabird attendance. Three species, the Black-browed Albatross Thalassarche melanophris, Cape (or Pintado) Petrel Daption capense and Wilson’s Storm-Petrel Oceanites oceanicus were the most common seabirds <b>attending</b> the <b>vessel.</b> We found that abundance of seabirds did not vary between fishing activities, although the presence of discards caused an increase in the numbers of petrels and albatrosses. Our study is the first to examine seabird-vessel attendance to scientific trawling activities in Antarctic waters where a moratorium on commercial finfish fishing is in place. In comparison with other studies, the level of fishing conducted during this study does not come close to approaching that of commercial fishing (i. e. catch rate and fishing duration).

40|$|Skewed adult {{sex ratio}} (ASR) has been {{proposed}} as a common pattern in birds, frequently biased towards males and with larger biases in globally threatened species. In albatrosses and petrels, {{it has been suggested}} that differential mortality of one gender in fisheries is caused either by sexual size dimorphism giving males a competitive advantage, which allows more access of the larger sex (i. e. males) to discards and/or baits, or to at sea segregation of sexes. Here, we tested these hypotheses by determining ASRs in albatrosses and petrels trapped at sea when <b>attending</b> longline fishing <b>vessels</b> for discards in the southwestern Atlantic Ocean, and searched in the literature for patterns in ASR in albatrosses and petrels killed by fisheries in this area and elsewhere. We show that skewed ASR is common in albatrosses and petrels in the community <b>attending</b> <b>vessels</b> for discards, confirming results found for birds in general. There was no correlation between skewed ASR and conservation status, or between ASR and sexual size dimorphism. Our review of the sex of birds incidentally killed in fisheries found skewed ASR toward males, females or parity to be equally reported. Thus, sexual dimorphism in size does not explain skewed ASR in the community we sampled or in incidental captures in fisheries in the review. Differential at-sea distribution of sexes appears to be a better explanation of the patterns found in the community sampled at sea as well as skewed ASR in seabird fatalities, particularly distant from breeding areas...|$|R

40|$|Bottom trawl fishing {{provides}} substantial {{amounts of}} normally unavailable demersal prey to seabirds (e. g., discards), affecting their life-history traits and popu-lation dynamics, as well as community structure. Within this framework, we studied seabird-trawling interactions throughout the annual cycle in a poorly studied ecosystem in the Mediterranean, the Balearic archipelago, on a both species-specific and a com-munity level. Whereas the species-specific approach showed a significant influence of season (phenology) on shaping seabird’s trawling attendance patterns, the spatio-temporal coupling of regional community {{was a result of}} a complex interaction between fishery-related variables. The most frequent and abundant species were the yellow-legged gull Larus michahellis and Cory’s shearwater Calonectris diomedea, the latter <b>attending</b> <b>vessels</b> in higher numbers than expected from local population figures. Conversely, the remaining breeding species occurred in lower num-bers than expected according to their local breeding populations, suggesting that discards were of rela-tively little importance.

40|$|Capture {{in global}} pelagic {{longline}} fisheries threatens {{the viability of}} some seabird populations. The Hawaii longline tuna fishery annually catches hundreds of seabirds, primarily Laysan (Phoebastria immutabilis) and black-footed (P. nigripes) albatrosses. Since seabird regulations were introduced in 2001, the seabird catch rate has declined 74 %. However, over the past decade, seabird catch levels significantly increased due to significant increasing trends in both effort and nominal seabird catch rates. We modelled observer data using a spatio-temporal generalized additive mixed model with zero-inflated Poisson likelihood to determine {{the significance of the}} effect of various risk factors on the seabird catch rate. The seabird catch rate significantly increased as annual mean multivariate ENSO index values increased, suggesting that decreasing ocean productivity observed in recent years in the central north Pacific {{may have contributed to the}} increasing trend in nominal seabird catch rate. A significant increasing trend in number of albatrosses <b>attending</b> <b>vessels,</b> possibly linked to declining regional ocean productivity and increasing absolute abundance of black-footed albatrosses, may also have contributed to the increasing nominal seabird catch rate. Largest opportunities for reductions are through augmented efficacy of seabird bycatch mitigation north of 23 ° N where mitigation methods are required and during setting instead of during hauling. Both side vs. stern setting, and blue-dyed vs. untreated bait significantly reduced the seabird catch rate. Of two options for meeting regulatory requirements, side setting had a significantly lower seabird catch rate than blue-dyed bait.

40|$|In {{this study}} I {{investigated}} Procellariiformes (albatrosses, petrels and shearwaters) at sea {{in the southwestern}} Atlantic Ocean. Fourteen species and 301 individuals were sampled non-destructively using a cast net method described here. A method is described for ageing Atlantic Yellow-nosed (Thalassarche chlororhynchos) and Black-browed (T. melanophris) Albatrosses based on bill colour and moult. Procellariiformes appear to have two distinct moulting strategies: petrels and shearwaters have complete annual moult, start to moult during the breeding period, and replace several primaries and tail feathers at one time, whereas albatrosses undergo long moulting cycles, replace less feathers at once, and suspend the wing moult during breeding periods. Primary moult starting at P 2 rather than P 1 was demonstrated to be a common feature in this taxon, with important implications for studies of stable isotopes, trace elements and pollutants in feathers. Overlap between moulting and breeding is demonstrated to be common with tail and contour feathers, but limited in wing, which suggests that flight constraint in long distance foragers rather than nutritional and energetic limitations is the ultimate factor determining primary moult timing. Based on molecular sexing and linear measurements, sexual size dimorphism was shown to vary according to species, with females in general smaller than males, more pronounced in bill measurements than in other traits, and more conspicuous in Giant Petrels (Macronectes spp.) and Diomedea albatrosses. Closely related species pairs of Thallassarche albatrosses and Procellaria petrels had differing levels of sexual dimorphism. The pelagic seabird community sampled comprises birds from different ages and breeding status according to species. Skewed Adult Sex Ratio (ASR) has been proposed as a common pattern in birds, frequently biased towards males and with larger biases in globally threatened species. In albatrosses and petrels, differential mortality of one gender in fisheries is suggested {{to be caused by}} sexual size dimorphism giving males a competitive advantage, which allows more access of the larger sex to discards and baits, or to at sea segregation of sexes. These hypotheses were tested by sampling birds at sea and reviewing ASR of birds incidentally captured in fisheries. Skewed ASR is common in albatrosses and petrels from the community <b>attending</b> <b>vessels,</b> but there was no correlation between skewed ASR and conservation status, both in terms of population size or global level of threat, or between ASR and sexual size dimorphism. Thus, sexual dimorphism in size does not explain skewed ASR in the community sampled or in incidental captures in fisheries reported in the review. Differential at sea distributions of males and females appear to explain better the patterns found in the community sampled at sea, as well as skewed ASR in seabird fatalities. Kernel density analysis of satellite tracked Spectacled Petrels (Procellaria conspicillata) in 2006 and 2007 demonstrated intense use of waters in the Brazilian Exclusive Economic Zone, from 26 to 31 S, mainly over the continental shelf break and offshore waters. The marine habitats used by Spectacled Petrel and described by bathymetry, SST and productivity are remarkably {{different from those of the}} sister species White-chinned Petrel (Procellaria aequinoctialis), which occurs in the area during the winter, but remains over the continental shelf, on Sub-Antarctic and oligotrophic waters. A close association between birds and pelagic longline fishery was demonstrated through comparison of the main kernel areas used by Spectacled Petrels and the pelagic longline fleet. Stable isotopes of nitrogen (δ 15 N) and carbon (δ 13 C) in blood preserved in different ways and simultaneously growing feathers were analysed in Spectacled Petrel. Mean δ 13 C and δ 15 N values in growing feathers were higher than in blood, suggesting tissue-specific fractionation. Different methods of preserving tissues such as blood may bias stable isotope values. Air drying is proposed as a practical and unbiased method for blood preservation in field situations where freezing is not a practical option, and a mathematical approach is suggested to permit comparison between studies using different preservation methods or tissues. By analysing stable isotopes in blood of all species of Procellariiformes sampled it is demonstrated that availability of discard, mainly the preferred shark liver, which is shared among species with contrasting body masses and feeding techniques, is the ultimate cause of overlapping in trophic levels. Carbon isotopic signature overlapped among the species and was typical of subtropical and offshore region. Early migrant individuals from Antarctica and sub-Antarctic (e. g. Cape Petrel Daption capense, White-chinned Petrel, Wilson’s Storm-petrel Oceanites oceanicus) and species still rearing chicks when sampled (Wandering Albatross Diomedea exulans) had clear carbon isotopic signatures from the austral region. All southern latitude species underwent a clear shift in carbon and nitrogen isotope signatures, increasing in trophic level after arriving in the SW Atlantic. Cory’s Shearwater (Calonectris diomedea), the only species not <b>attending</b> <b>vessels,</b> has low nitrogen values resulting from a diet of flyingfish and squids naturally occurring in the area. While some abundant and widespread petrels and shearwaters, particularly those small in size, benefit from discards from pelagic longline vessels, the balance between benefits and the incidental mortality in hooks is negative for albatrosses and some petrels. Information on bycatch rates of seabirds in the Brazilian domestic pelagic longline fishery from 2001 to 2007 in the Exclusive Economic Zone and adjacent international waters of the southwestern Atlantic Ocean is presented, and bycatch rates for the area are reviewed. Overall, seabird capture rate for the Brazilian pelagic longline fleet was 0. 229 birds/ 1000 hooks, varying from zero to 0. 542 birds/ 1000 according to season. Capture rates were higher between June and November (cold season) and affected mainly the Black-browed Albatross (55 % of birds captured), the White-chinned Petrel, the Spectacled Petrel and the Atlantic Yellow-nosed Albatross. Capture rates previously reported in the SW Atlantic varied from 0 to 5. 03 birds/ 1000 hooks, with those based on logbooks or fishermen interviews tending to underestimate capture rates, whereas those based on small numbers of hooks or short time periods tend to greatly overestimate rates in both pelagic and demersal longline fisheries. A range of poorly-known hook-and-line commercial fisheries carried out by the Itaipava fleet, southeastern Brazil, composed by 497 vessels, was described with seven fisheries defined. Capture rates were higher for the surface longline for Dolphinfish (0. 15 birds/ 1000 hooks and 1. 08 turtles/ 1000 hooks), slow trolling for Bigeye Tuna (0. 41 birds/day) and handlining targeting Yellowfin Tuna (0. 61 birds/day). Bycatch of 47 seabirds, mainly the endangered Spectacled Petrel, Atlantic Yellow-nosed, and Black-browed Albatrosses, and 45 turtles of four species were recorded. Longline and other hook-and-line fisheries are the major threat for albatrosses and petrels from different origins when foraging in the SW Atlantic Ocean, and require urgent conservation measures...|$|R

40|$|Competition {{between the}} yellow-legged gull Larus cachinnans and Audouin's gull Larus audouinii while {{foraging}} at commercial fishing vessels off the Ebro Delta (NW Mediterranean) was assessed in 1997 and 1998. Observations {{were performed on}} board two kinds of fishing vessels with different timetables: bottom trawlers (diurnal activity) and purse seiners (nocturnal activity). Three situations were distinguished {{with respect to the}} season and the fishing regime: (1) breeding season, both fleets operating; (2) breeding season, only purse seiners operating due to a trawling moratorium; (3) non-breeding season, both fleets operating. Overall, the yellow-legged gull behaved as an opportunist species and exerted pressure over Audouin's gull through kleptoparasitism and agonistic interactions (i. e. contest competition). Despite this, Audouin's gull was more efficient at capturing discards through scramble competition and was able to take profit from fishing vessels when the capture of fish required high skill, in accordance with its higher specialisation. Competition varied in intensity according to the fishing fleet and the season. Indeed, Audouin's and the yellow-legged gulls only interfered at trawlers, since only Audouin's gull attended purse seiners. During the breeding season competition at trawlers was not severe and Audouin's gull preferentially <b>attended</b> these <b>vessels.</b> Purse seiners acted as a secondary food resource and only attracted important numbers of Audouin's gulls during trawling moratoriums. Out of the breeding season the number of Audouin's gulls strongly declined in the area. Furthermore, the intensity of kleptoparasitism increased at trawlers, and the average size of the fish discarded was larger and less suitable. In parallel with these changes, Audouin's gull shifted to attend purse seiners preferentially, thus avoiding the high levels of competition at the trawlers. The lower representation of Audouin's gull in other breeding areas in the Mediterranean, as well as the less important fishing fleets in these areas, would probably reduce the attractiveness of trawlers for this species, even during the breeding season. Moreover, changes in fishing policies aimed to reduce discarding practices would lead to a globally less favourable situation for Audouin's gull. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Seabirds feeding ecology was {{studied at}} sea {{to assess the}} {{significance}} of two commercial fisheries, trawlers (demersal fishery with diurnal activity) and purse seiners (pelagic fishery with nocturnal activity), in the NW Mediterranean. Trawlers offered high amounts of discards (mostly fish of small size) on a predictable basis, and consequently attracted large numbers of seabirds. At the Ebro Delta, discards provided in average 65 % of the energy requirements of the seabird breeding community, being most important for large gulls and of little significance for terns. Purse seiners produced few discards, on an irregular basis, and attracted lower numbers of seabirds during discarding (after dawn). During the fishing operation, at night, only Audouin's Gulls Larus audouinii <b>attended</b> these <b>vessels,</b> capturing live fish concentrated near the sea surface, attracted by powerful lamps. During the breeding season, Audouin's Gulls preferentially attended trawlers in spite of potential competition with the more aggressive and opportunistic Yellow-legged Gulls Larus cachinnans, since the former showed to be more efficient at capturing discards and reduced competition by showing {{a wider range of}} feeding techniques. Only during trawler closures, Audouin's Gulls occurred in important numbers at purse seiners (thus acting as a secondary food resource for most individuals). During the non-breeding season Audouin's Gulls shifted to preferentially attend purse seiners, presumably because competition at trawlers strengthened at this period. The rare and threatened Balearic Shearwater Puffinus mauretanicus also made significant use of discards, which represented more than 40 % of the energy requirements of the whole population during the breeding season. Seabirds feeding upon discards showed higher levels of mercury, as discards make accessible to them demersal fish that is more polluted than epipelagic fish (natural prey for most seabirds). Thus, the risks of toxicity by this metal are higher for those species capturing discards. Given the significance of commercial fisheries for seabirds in the NW Mediterranean, and considering the increasing ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management, fisheries managers should regard these birds when designing fishing policies...|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{numbers of}} {{animal and plant}} species are under threat, often through human activity. To improve {{management}} of these species, {{it is important to}} understand the spatio-temporal nature of these interactions. In this thesis the threats to flesh-footed shearwater breeding on Lord Howe Island were explored, and methods that can be adopted for lowering them were investigated. A census of the population of flesh-footed shearwaters on Lord Howe Island indicated a continuing decline. Possible threats to the population that were identified as (i) offshore, in the form of fisheries by-catch and plastic pollution at sea, and (ii) onshore, with factors such as land clearance and road mortality on Lord Howe Island. Significant mortality was recorded on roads on Lord Howe Island. Offshore threats were examined by quantifying the regions of interactions between flesh-footed shearwaters and vessels operating in the Eastern Tuna and Billfish Fishery using data from fisheries observers, Australian Fisheries Management Authority logbook data and remote sensing data of oceanographic variables. Recent changes in the regions of interaction between the shearwaters and the ETBF were modelled, and how this affected the by-catch rate was examined. The effect these changes had on the by-catch rate was used to recommend the potential of area closures as a method of conservation. Using a novel statistical technique, the distribution of flesh-footed shearwaters and their interactions with the ETBF was further examined. Small scale oceanographic relationships between the shearwaters‟ attendance of vessels operating in the fishery were quantified using an arrivals and departures multi-component model. For this the same data as that used in the previous section was used. By comparing the arrivals and departures for shearwaters behind vessels, finer scale attendance was examined and compared with the hypothesis that shearwaters were more likely to <b>attend</b> a <b>vessel</b> when it was operating in conditions that were likely to be more productive. Finally, the distribution of individual flesh-footed shearwaters during the breeding season was quantified using light based archival tags (GLS loggers). Discrete Choice Models were then used to examine if individuals returned to the same areas on successive trips. Flesh-footed shearwaters used experience to determine where they were foraging, returning to areas that they had visited during the previous two foraging trips, and returning to areas where they apparently were successful during those trips. This has rarely been demonstrated previously, especially for larger or oceanic animals...|$|R
5000|$|Early in {{the morning}} of Tuesday 25 January 1898 the smart little {{coasting}} steamer Koonya in a thick fog ran aground at the northern end of Cronulla Beach outside Merries Reef onto Doboy reef about three-quarters of a mile from the shore.The steamer left Moruya at 10 a m on Monday for Sydney, with 14 passengers, amongst whom were a number of ladies and children All was right until about 3 a.m. yesterday, the weather being intensely thick and raining, when the steamer ran ashore on a fungus-growth patch at the northern- most end of Cronulla Beach The land could not be seen, and there is no light there. The captain was on the bridge, it being his watch, he having relieved the mate at midnight [...]The master is Captain T [...]Nicholson, and his chief officer Mr F Basclain. Immediately the vessel struck all hands were at once on deck, and the stewardess routed out the ladies and children, and lifebelts were supplied. There was a heavy sea, and the belts were put round the passengers. Soon after the Captain, who behaved coolly, told the people there was no real danger. They might take the belts off, as he could easily land them at daylight. No seas broke aboard the steamer lying on her side in a comparatively sheltered spot.The women and children all got on the bridge. When daylight came in the boat was launched and took a line ashore. This was made fast to a tree, the vessel being about 50 or 60 yards from the land. By these means all the passengers were got ashore- that is, that the crew worked the boat between the ship and shore by the hand-line thus established, the women and children being landed first, next the male passengers, and afterwards their luggage and the effects of the crew, with the exception of those of the stewardess, which were lost , Miss Rankin being so busy looking after those in her charge that her personal goods were overlooked. The passengers speak in unmeasured terms of praise of Miss Rankin's noble efforts in helping the women and children during the trying time They also have a good word for the master and crewAfter getting ashore an impromptu camp was put up, in winch the whole party breakfasted, plenty of everything being available by boat from the vesselVery soon after, however, whether owing to the tide rising and the heavy easterly swell setting in (wind at time of wreck was S E to E [...] ), the vessel began to range about, and presently broke in halves, and at high water only a little of her stern could be seen Then the action of the sea soon smashed her up, and wreckage was strewn along the beach Cheese were particularly in evidence, and some 20 pigs out of 25 that were on board were seen gambolling on the beach At this time no person had put in an appearance at the scene, and the captain sent a message into Sutherland, whence it was dispatched to Sydney, asking for conveyances to be sent to take the people to the hotel at Port Hacking In response to this message a conveyance came, and took the party with their effects to the hotel The road is a pretty rough one, so that progress was slow, and the people had to get out and walk at intervals At the hotel all their requirements were <b>attended</b> toThe <b>vessel</b> struck the Doboy reef about three-quarters of a mile from the shore the vessel was going at the rate of about eight knots.... and she broke up in a few hours The stern portion of the vessel, with the ladies' cabin intact, was washed up on the rocks to high-water mark, where it remained fast.The list -Mrs. Jones Miss F Holder, Mrs. Warren and four children, Mrs. Walters and one child, Mrs. Craig, Messrs Cleary, Hopkins, M.
