In the present paper we use group theory to highlight the role of symmetry. It is shown how certain symmetries can obstruct period doubling and Hopf bifurcations; the associated routes to chaos cannot proceed until these symmetries have been broken. The symmetry approach also reveals the general mechanism of mode interaction and enables a useful comparison with other systems...|$|E

40|$|The UK National Ecosystem Assessment, {{the largest}} scale {{ecosystem}} valuation project undertaken at national scale, {{is the result}} of combined efforts by natural scientists, economists and other social scientists from policy, academic, private sector and non-governmental organization. It is an important case study in understanding the processes, characteristics and barriers at play in interdisciplinary research in the UK. To date, measurement of interdisciplinarity has been restricted to bibiometric analysis. In this dissertation I use web-based survey responses to measure ‘interdisciplinary’ project success through the behaviour of its authors. In addition, I analyse the importance of social capital characteristics arising from ‘interdisciplinary’ projects. I argue that analysis of project success must include post-hoc assessment of research impact, especially at the level of policy uptake. I posit that the tools used to measure disciplinary integration, in particular measurement of social capital in the form of bridging connection, can be used to measure policy impact. I find that the National Ecosystem Assessment is best categorized as ‘interdisciplinary’ rather than ‘transdisciplinary’, following Gibbons et <b>al.</b> <b>mode</b> 2 knowledge. I argue that in many cases ‘transdisciplinary’ research may introduce complexities that reduce policy interpretability and uptake. Finally, I present a tentative attempt at a meso-level measurement of knowledge sharing networks between individual project authors as a means of measuring social capital impacts on policy uptake...|$|E
40|$|The Gal repressosome is a higher-order {{nucleoprotein}} {{complex that}} represses transcription of the gal operon in Escherichia coli. During the repressosome assembly, a DNA loop is {{formed by the}} interaction of two GalR dimers, bound to two spatially separated operators, OE and OI, flanking the gal promoters. Structure-based genetic analysis indicated that GalR homodimers interact directly and form a V-shaped stacked tetramer in repressosome, further stabilized by HU binding to an architecturally critical position on the DNA. In this scheme of GalR tetramerization, the alignment of the operators in the DNA loop could be in either parallel (PL) or antiparallel (<b>AL)</b> <b>mode.</b> As each mode can have two alternative geometries differing in the mutual stacking of the OE- and OI-bound GalR dimers, {{it is possible to}} have four different DNA trajectories in the repressosome. Feasibilities of these trajectories were tested by in vitro transcription repression assays, first by isolating GalR mutants with altered operator specificity and then by constructing four different potential loops with mutant GalR heterodimers bound to specifically designed hybrid operators {{in such a way as}} to give rise to only one of the four putative trajectories. Results show that OE and OI adopt a mutual antiparallel orientation in an under-twisted DNA loop, consistent with the energetically optimal structural model. In this structure the center of the HU-binding site is located at the apex of the DNA loop. The approach reported here can be used to distinguish between otherwise indistinguishable DNA trajectories in complex nucleoprotein machines...|$|E

40|$|Plant defensins are small, cysteine-rich {{peptides}} that possess {{biological activity}} towards {{a broad range}} of organisms. Their activity is primarily directed against fungi, but bactericidal and insecticidal actions have also been reported. HsAFP 1, a plant defensin of 54 amino acids from coral bells (Heuchera sanguinea) induces cell death in {{a broad range of}} yeast and fungi [1, 2]. In order to further investigate the peptide’s antifungal activity, HsAFP 1 was heterologously produced using Pichia pastoris as a host. NMR analysis revealed that recombinant (r) rHsAFP 1 consists of an α-helix and a triple-stranded antiparallel β-sheet stabilised by four intramolecular disulfide bonds. This highly stabilized peptide was found to inhibit growth of the human pathogen Candida albicans as well as prevent C. albicans biofilm formation. We further analysed the potential of rHsAFP 1 to increase the activity of the conventional antimycotics caspofungin and amphotericin B towards C. albicans. Synergistic effects were observed between rHsAFP 1 and these compounds against both planktonic C. albicans cells and biofilms. Because of the interesting characteristics of rHsAFP 1 towards drug development, in both single or combination therapy, we examined the cytotoxicity of the plant defensin. In line with reports on the non-toxicity of plant defensins towards mammalian cells, [3, 4], rHsAFP 1 was found non-toxic towards human HepG 2 cells. A structure-function study with 24 -mer synthetic peptides spanning the entire HsAFP 1 sequence revealed the importance of the γ-core and its adjacent regions (C-terminal part) for HsAFP 1 antibiofilm activity. We are currently investigating the optimal HsAFP 1 -derived peptide length for both antibiofilm and synergistic activity with caspofungin. 1. 	Osborn, R.
