25|$|Early 20th century theorists, such as Kurt Koffka, Max Wertheimer, and Wolfgang Köhler (students of Carl Stumpf) saw {{objects as}} {{perceived}} within an environment {{according to all}} of their elements taken together as a global construct. This 'gestalt' or 'whole form' approach sought to define principles of perception—seemingly innate mental laws that determined the way objects were perceived. It {{is based on the}} here <b>and</b> <b>now,</b> <b>and</b> in the way things are seen. Images can be divided into figure or ground. The question is what is perceived at first glance: the figure in front, or the background.|$|E

All he had was the present, which was not to his Muse’s liking, and eventually not to his own either. His poetry, in other words, is that of the here <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> of no escape, except for poetry itself. Yet for all he {{had to say about the}} present, his language is amazingly clear and direct, and the formal aspects of his verse are amazingly conservative. Evidently Kees did not feel the imperative of arrythmia so palpable among his less memorable peers, not to mention successors.|$|E

25|$|Making {{his name}} as a hard bop player, he {{appeared}} regularly at the Marquee Club from August 1960, and recorded his first solo album {{at the age of}} 21, It’s Morrissey, Man! (1961) for Fontana, featuring Stan Jones on piano, Colin Barnes on drums, and The Jazz Couriers founding member Malcolm Cecil on bass. He spent most of 1962 in Calcutta, India as part of the Ashley Kozak Quartet, playing three 2-hour sessions seven days a week, before returning to the UK and forming his quartet with Harry South – who had also been in the quartet in Calcutta – on piano. They were joined by former The Jazz Couriers bassist Phil Bates and variously, another ex-The Jazz Couriers member, Bill Eyden, Jackie Dougan or Phil Seamen on drums. The Dick Morrissey Quartet recorded three LPs, Have You Heard? (1963); the live recording Storm Warning! (1965) on Mercury; and Here <b>and</b> <b>Now</b> <b>and</b> Sounding Good! (1966). The quartet, played regular London gigs at The Bull's Head, Barnes and at Ronnie Scott's, whose manager, Pete King, once said that Ronnie's was kept going in those days due to the crowds Dick Morrissey pulled in. During this time he also played extensively in bands led by Ian Hamer and Harry South, including The Six Sounds, featuring Ken Wray and Dick Morrissey, a band which by 1966 had developed into the Ian Hamer Sextet featuring South, Dick Morrissey, Keith Christie, Kenny Napper and Bill Eyden, among other leading UK-based jazz musicians.|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} 2012, Kaleidoscope Dream {{appeared}} on several critics' lists of the year's best records. Ann Powers named it the best album of 2012.

The album was voted the fifth best album of 2012 in the Pazz & Jop, an annual poll of American critics nationwide, published by The Village Voice.

500|$|According to Andrew Kelham, Daybreaker is an [...] "urgent and resurgent" [...] record; it {{has been}} {{identified}} by critics as metalcore, progressive metal, mathcore and post-hardcore. Architects have been credited for fusing the intense technicality and metallic style of Hollow Crown with the [...] "soaring vocals" [...] and the much improved production of The Here and Now. The album is defined {{by a number of}} features, including a contrast of singing and extreme metal screaming, and melodic choruses complemented by [...] "soaring" [...] vocals, technical guitar work with palm muted breakdowns and the use of string instruments and piano to generate atmosphere. Daybreaker is noted for fusing influences from Architects' previous two albums The Here <b>And</b> <b>Now</b> <b>and</b> Hollow Crown; many reviewers have cited the album as a return to the band's heavier, more technical roots. When he interviewed the band, Kelham wrote, [...] "some will see Daybreaker as an apology, but it's not. Others will view it as a hasty attempt to claw back the glories of third album Hollow Crown, but it's not that either. It's a collection of songs about moving on, growing up and making sense of what has come before".|$|E

500|$|The {{libretto}} {{has been}} praised by several biographers and historians. One said that [...] "The dialogue contains many an authentic Gilbertian touch." [...] Another found it [...] "a gay, sparkling libretto". Sidney Dark and Rowland Gray wrote that [...] "the book of Thespis is genuine Gilbert, the Gilbert whom nowadays {{all the world}} loves.... Thespis once more emphasizes the fact that Gilbert's artistry was hardly affected {{with the passing of}} the years. Many of its songs might well have appeared in the later operas." [...] They point out Mercury's [...] "I'm the celestial drudge", which anticipates Giuseppe's [...] "Rising early in the morning" [...] in The Gondoliers, and find the [...] "real brand of Gilbertian topsy-turvydom" [...] in the song about the former head of a railway company, [...] "I once knew a chap who discharged a function". Isaac Goldberg thought that [...] "Thespis looks forward far more often than it glances backward: [...] "It forecasts the characteristic methods, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> then a character, of the later series. Its dialogue is comical, and, if anything, somewhat above the heads of the Gaiety audiences of 1871." ...|$|E
500|$|Soon {{after the}} assault on Badajoz, Wellington marched his men to confront the French near Salamanca. For a month the armies marched and counter-marched against each other, seeking advantage, and on 22 July Wellington {{attacked}} in the Battle of Salamanca, achieving a comprehensive victory. The Light Division were in the reserve during the battle, and afterwards pursued and harried the retreating French. August saw the army in Madrid, where the 1/52nd remained while Wellington led a force on to Burgos, which he attempted to take. The siege was unsuccessful, and it was lifted by Wellington in October; the 1/52nd, with the Light Division, covered the army's retreat back into Portugal. This [...] "Winter Retreat" [...] bore similarities with the earlier retreat to Corunna, as it suffered from poor supplies, bitter weather and rearguard action, including one skirmish near the River Huebra, where the 43rd and 1/52nd lost 95 men. Ciudad Rodrigo was reached on 19 November, where the 1/52nd were billeted and resupplied with both men and clothing. Diversions were set up, including the [...] "Light Division Theatre", in which the 52nd were described as [...] "highly gentlemanly men, of steady aspect; they mixed little with other corps, but attended the theatricals of the 43rd with circumspect good humour, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> then relaxed." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon {{opening in}} 2001, PNC Park was praised by fans and media alike. ESPN.com writer Jim Caple ranked PNC Park {{as the best}} stadium in Major League Baseball, with a score of 95 out of 100. Caple {{compared}} the park to Frank Lloyd Wright's Fallingwater, calling the stadium itself [...] "perfect", and citing high ticket prices as the only negative aspect of visiting the park. Jay Ahjua, author of Fields of Dreams: A Guide to Visiting and Enjoying All 30 Major League Ballparks, called PNC Park one of the [...] "top ten places to watch the game". Eric Enders, author of Ballparks Then <b>and</b> <b>Now</b> <b>and</b> co-author of Big League Ballparks: The Complete Illustrated History, said it was [...] "everything a baseball stadium could hope to be" [...] and [...] "an immediate contender {{for the title of}} best baseball park ever built".

Looking back after almost 40 years, she adds, [...] "I can see how I have tried to wrestle with just one fundamental question: 'How can one live and work as a pacifist in the here <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> help to structure a society in which oppression, violence, and wars would diminish and co-operation, equality, and justice would rise?'" [...] As part of the answer, Franklin turns to the metaphor of mapmaking to explain her intellectual journey. [...] "Increasingly I found the maps of conventional wisdom inadequate for my travels," [...] she writes. [...] "I became unwilling and unable to orient my life according to national maps depicting the realms of 'them' and 'us,' of good guys and bad guys, of winning, defeating, and being defeated; in short, all those maps drawn up for travel towards private gain and personal advancement." [...] Franklin concludes that she has been guided in understanding what she calls [...] "the real world" [...] by [...] "the maps of pacifism and feminism".|$|E
500|$|After meeting George Lamb on {{a holiday}} in Ibiza, Allen made him her manager. Lamb later {{introduced}} the singer to production duo Future Cut, {{with whom she}} had written and produced demos, which were sent to various labels. In 2005, Allen was signed to Regal Records, who gave her £25,000 to produce an album. The singer considered it to be a [...] "small development idea", as they were also unable to provide much support for it due to their preoccupation with other releases. Taking advice from Lady Sovereign, the singer created an account on MySpace and began posting demo songs in November 2005. By March 2006, they attracted thousands of listeners, and 500 limited edition 7" [...] vinyl singles of one of the demos, a song titled [...] "LDN", were rush-released and sold for as much as £40. Allen also produced two mixtapes to promote her work. As she accumulated tens of thousands of MySpace friends, The Observer Music Monthly took interest. Few people outside of her label's A department had heard of Allen, so the label was slow in responding to publications who wanted to report about her. Her label wasn't pleased with the sound of the demos, so they assigned the singer to [...] "more mainstream producers and top-line writers". After that, they finally approved some of her songs, being confident of their inclusion on the album. [...] "Smile" [...] was among the chosen ones, that Allen claimed she was happy with. It was the first song she had ever written, claiming:When I set out to do this I knew I wanted to make songs that sounded a) up to date <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> b) really organic. Because you can't get really good players without spending loads of money these days, the only other option is to sample. The first song I ever wrote was 'Smile'. We just went through about seven or eight sample lyrics, found a beat, put it all in... Then when it comes to writing lyrics I write... like a rapper would, I suppose, with absolutely no melody involved whatsoever, I'm just getting my flow sorted. Then I write the whole text of the song and then ad lib the melody into the microphone. It's not terribly clever! ...|$|E
