5|$|Anton Rubinstein was {{a famous}} Russian pianist who had lived, {{performed}} and composed in Western and Central Europe before he returned to Russia in 1858. He saw Russia as a musical desert compared to Paris, Berlin and Leipzig, whose music conservatories he had visited. Musical life flourished in those places; composers were held in high regard, and musicians were wholeheartedly devoted to their <b>art.</b> <b>With</b> a similar ideal in mind for Russia, he had conceived {{an idea for a}} conservatory in Russia years before his 1858 return, and had finally aroused the interest of influential people to help him realize the idea.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{continued}} defacement, fans rushed to the sites of the installments as soon as they are announced. A group of men took advantage of this and threatened to deface a stencil painting of a beaver in East New York, charging money for people to take photographs. Some took {{matters into their own hands}} by guarding the works, others restoring them once defaced. In part because of the defacement, but also because of the great value of the artworks, property owners have also gone to extreme measures to protect the art. Some hired security guards, others covered the <b>art</b> <b>with</b> acrylic glass, and yet others installed metal roll-down gates.|$|E
5|$|At Royal Ascot, Duke of Marmalade showed {{improved}} {{form in the}} St. James's Palace Stakes. Michael Kinane {{tried to}} lead all the way on the colt-and was still in front inside the final furlong-before being caught and beaten a neck by Jamie Spencer on his stable companion Excellent <b>Art,</b> <b>with</b> another O'Brien-trained runner, Astronomer Royal in third, and Cockney Rebel in fifth. Two months later, Duke of Marmalade was moved up in distance and took on older horses {{for the first time}} in the International Stakes at York. He ran up to his best form in a highly competitive race to finish fourth behind the Derby winner Authorized, Dylan Thomas and Notnowcato.|$|E

5|$|He {{perceived}} {{books as}} permanent objects that were invested with power. This power was {{unique in that}} it could transmit ideas to people of different times, cultures, and interests, and do so in ways other art forms could not. This ambition laced all of his work, particularly in his later years. Lissitzky was devoted {{to the idea of}} creating <b>art</b> <b>with</b> power and purpose, art that could invoke change.|$|E
5|$|June Kim, {{the author}} and {{illustrator}} for 12 Days, primarily drew the artwork in the realism style, although she occasionally rendered characters as super-deformed versions of themselves. While the cover art incorporates red and silver coloring, the artwork primarily appears in black and white, with occasional gray shading. Kim used pen and ink as the artistic medium, then toned her <b>art</b> <b>with</b> the software application ComicStudio. For the narrative, she explores the characters' pasts through dreams, and periodic, nonlinear flashbacks. Several character traits, such as Jackie's chocolate allergy, are presented to the reader through inference rather than exposition. Additionally, Kim uses a brief, untranslated Korean song alongside the predominantly English text.|$|E

5|$|Parthian <b>art,</b> <b>with</b> its {{distinct}} use of frontality in portraiture, {{was lost}} and abandoned with the profound {{cultural and political}} changes brought by the Sassanid Empire. However, even after the Roman occupation of Dura-Europos in 165 AD, the use of Parthian frontality in portraiture continued to flourish there. This is exemplified by the early 3rd-century AD wall murals of the Dura-Europos synagogue, a temple {{in the same city}} dedicated to Palmyrene gods, and the local Mithraeum.|$|E
5|$|Pink Floyd {{had already}} experimented with filming outside {{the context of}} a {{standard}} rock concert, including an hour-long performance in KQED TV studios in April 1970. Adrian Maben had become interested in combining <b>art</b> <b>with</b> Pink Floyd's music, and during 1971, he attempted to contact the band's manager, Steve O'Rourke, to discuss the possibilities of making a film to achieve this aim. After his original plan of mixing the band with assorted paintings had been rejected, Maben went on holiday to Naples in the early summer.|$|E
5|$|Stoddart {{was born}} in Edinburgh and raised in Renfrewshire, where he {{developed}} an early interest {{in the arts and}} music, and later trained in fine art at the Glasgow School of Art (1976–1980) and read the History of Art at the University of Glasgow. During this time he became increasingly critical of contemporary trends in art, such as pop art, and concentrated on creating figurine pieces in clay. Stoddart associates the lack of form in modern <b>art</b> <b>with</b> social decay; in contrast, his works include many classical allusions.|$|E

5|$|The Walker Art Center was {{established}} in 1927 as the first public art gallery in the Upper Midwest. In the 1940s, the museum shifted its focus toward modern art, after a gift from Mrs. Gilbert Walker {{made it possible to}} acquire works by Pablo Picasso, Henry Moore, Alberto Giacometti, and others. The museum continued its focus on modern <b>art</b> <b>with</b> traveling shows in the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|The largest {{museum in}} Skopje is the Museum of Macedonia which details {{the history of}} the country. Its icons and {{lapidary}} collections are particularly rich. The Macedonian Archeological Museum, opened in 2014, keeps some of the best archeological finds in Macedonia, dating from Prehistory to the Ottoman period. The National Gallery of Macedonia exhibits paintings dating from the 14th to the 20th century in two former Turkish baths of the Old Bazaar. The Contemporary Art Museum of Macedonia was built after the 1963 earthquake thanks to international assistance. Its collections include Macedonian and foreign <b>art,</b> <b>with</b> works by Fernand Léger, André Masson, Pablo Picasso, Hans Hartung, Victor Vasarely, Alexander Calder, Pierre Soulages, Alberto Burri and Christo.|$|E

After studying in the city for a few years with the firm of Messrs. Ilbury & Magniac, Magniac sent Bovet to Canton, China in 1818. Almost as soon as he arrived he was able to sell four of his watches for the equivalent of US$1million in 2008 currency.|$|E

5|$|Arulpragasam befriended {{students}} in the college's fashion, advertising and graphics departments. She met Justine Frischmann, front woman of the British band Elastica, through her friend Damon Albarn at an Air concert in 1999, and Frischmann commissioned Arulpragasama to create the cover art for the band's 2000 album, The Menace, and video document their American tour. Arulpragasam returned to Jaffna in 2001 to film a documentary on Tamil youth, {{but was unable to}} complete the project because she encountered harassment. In 2001, Arulpragasam's first public exhibition of paintings after graduating took place at the Euphoria Shop on London's Portobello Road. It featured graffiti art and spray-paint canvasses mixing Tamil political street <b>art</b> <b>with</b> images of London life and consumerist culture. The show was nominated for an Alternative Turner Prize and a monograph book of the collection was published in 2002, titled M.I.A.. Actor Jude Law was among early buyers of her art.|$|E
5|$|In {{the sixteenth}} century, Scottish kings, {{particularly}} James V, built palaces in a Renaissance style, beginning at Linlithgow. The trend soon spread {{to members of}} the aristocracy. Painting was strongly influenced by Flemish <b>art,</b> <b>with</b> works commissioned from the continent and Flemings serving as court artists. While church art suffered iconoclasm and a loss of patronage {{as a result of the}} Reformation, house decoration and portraiture became significant for the wealthy, with George Jamesone emerging as the first major named artist in the early seventeenth century. Music also incorporated wider European influences although the Reformation caused a move from complex polyphonic church music to the simpler singing of metrical psalms. Combined with the Union of Crowns in 1603, the Reformation also removed the church and the court as sources of patronage, changing the direction of artistic creation and limiting its scope. In the early seventeenth century the major elements of the Renaissance began to give way to Stoicism, Mannerism and the Baroque.|$|E
5|$|Marla F. Prather {{observed}} that Whaam!s grand scale and dramatic depiction contributed to its {{position as a}} historic work of pop <b>art.</b> <b>With</b> As I Opened Fire, Lichtenstein's other monumental war painting, Whaam! {{is regarded as the}} culmination of Lichtenstein's dramatic war-comics works, according to Diane Waldman. It is widely described as either Lichtenstein's most famous work, or, along with Drowning Girl, as one of his two most famous works. Andrew Edgar and Peter Sedgwick describe it, along with Warhol's Marilyn Monroe prints, {{as one of the most}} famous works of pop art. Gianni Versace once linked the two iconic pop art images via his gown designs. According to Douglas Coupland, the World Book Encyclopedia used pictures of Warhol's Monroes and Whaam! to illustrate its Pop art entry.|$|E

5|$|Mathematics has {{directly}} influenced <b>art</b> <b>with</b> conceptual {{tools such}} as linear perspective, the analysis of symmetry, and mathematical objects such as polyhedra and the Möbius strip. Magnus Wenninger creates colourful stellated polyhedra, originally as models for teaching. Mathematical concepts such as recursion and logical paradox {{can be seen in}} paintings by Rene Magritte and in engravings by M. C. Escher. Computer art often makes use of fractals including the Mandelbrot set, and sometimes explores other mathematical objects such as cellular automata. Controversially, the artist David Hockney has argued that artists from the Renaissance onwards made use of the camera lucida to draw precise representations of scenes; the architect Philip Steadman similarly argued that Vermeer used the camera obscura in his distinctively observed paintings.|$|E
5|$|Paris {{was in its}} artistic prime in the 19th {{century and}} early 20th century, when it had a colony of artists {{established}} {{in the city and}} in art schools associated with some of the finest painters of the times: Édouard Manet, Claude Monet, Berthe Morisot, Paul Gauguin, Pierre-Auguste Renoir and others. The French Revolution and political and social change in France had a profound influence on art in the capital. Paris was central to the development of Romanticism in <b>art,</b> <b>with</b> painters such as Gericault. Impressionism, Art Nouveau, Symbolism, Fauvism, Cubism and Art Deco movements all evolved in Paris. In the late 19th century, many artists in the French provinces and worldwide flocked to Paris to exhibit their works in the numerous salons and expositions and make a name for themselves. Artists such as Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Vincent van Gogh, Paul Cézanne, Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Henri Rousseau, Marc Chagall, Amedeo Modigliani and many others became associated with Paris. Picasso, living in Montmartre, painted his famous La Famille de Saltimbanques and Les Demoiselles d'Avignon between 1905 and 1907. Montmartre and Montparnasse became centres for artistic production.|$|E
5|$|Whale {{was born}} into a large family in Dudley, in the Black Country area of the English West Midlands. He {{discovered}} his artistic talent early on and studied <b>art.</b> <b>With</b> the outbreak of World War I he enlisted in the British Army and became an officer. He was captured by the Germans and during his time as a prisoner of war he realized he was interested in drama. Following his release {{at the end of the}} war he became an actor, set designer and director. His success directing the 1928 play Journey's End led to his move to the US, first to direct the play on Broadway and then to Hollywood, California, to direct films. He lived in Hollywood for the rest of his life, most of that time with his longtime companion, producer David Lewis. Apart from Journey's End (1930), which was released by Tiffany Films, and Hell's Angels (1930), released by United Artists, he directed a dozen films for Universal Pictures between 1931 and 1937, developing a style characterized by the influence of German Expressionism and a highly mobile camera.|$|E
