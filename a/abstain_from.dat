5|$|Along {{with many}} other texts, Gandhi studied Bhagavad Gita while in South Africa. This Hindu scripture {{discusses}} jnana yoga, bhakti yoga and karma yoga along with virtues such as non-violence, patience, integrity, lack of hypocrisy, self restraint and abstinence. Gandhi began experiments with these, and in 1906 at age 37, although married and a father, he vowed to <b>abstain</b> <b>from</b> sexual relations.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the past}} century, there have {{developed}} numerous rabbinical organizations that certify products, manufacturers, and restaurants as kosher, usually using a symbol (called a hechsher) {{to indicate their}} support. Currently, about a sixth of American Jews or 0.3% of the American population fully keep kosher, and many more <b>abstain</b> <b>from</b> some non-kosher foods, especially pork.|$|E
5|$|A {{population-based}} study {{completed by}} the National Alcohol Research Center {{found that women who}} identify as lesbian or bisexual are less likely to <b>abstain</b> <b>from</b> alcohol. Lesbians and bisexual women have a higher likelihood of reporting problems with alcohol, as well as not being satisfied with treatment for substance abuse programs. Many lesbian communities are centered in bars, and drinking is an activity that correlates to community participation for lesbians and bisexual women.|$|E

60|$|The Germans {{remember}} the Sabbath-day {{to keep it}} holy, by <b>abstaining</b> <b>from</b> work, as commanded; we keep it holy by <b>abstaining</b> <b>from</b> work, as commanded, and by also <b>abstaining</b> <b>from</b> play, which is not commanded. Perhaps we constructively BREAK the command to rest, because the resting we do is in most cases only a name, and not a fact.|$|R

5|$|During the tour, {{tensions}} sometimes arose {{between the}} senior players, who were war veterans and drinkers, while the younger players including Davidson tended to <b>abstain</b> <b>from</b> alcohol. Teammate Ian Craig estimated that bus journeys to matches proceeded {{at an average}} speed of 16km/h because of persistent stoppages outside pubs, something that frustrated the non-drinkers. In the end, the young players had {{to the majority of}} the fielding as their older colleagues were often still intoxicated during matches.|$|E
5|$|Embarrassing or {{tying the}} hands of the executive. The court should <b>abstain</b> <b>from</b> interfering where a {{judicial}} pronouncement could embarrass another branch of government or tie its hands in the conduct of affairs traditionally falling within its purview. In Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, the Divisional Court of England and Wales held that the applicant's true purpose for seeking the court's interpretation of a United Nations Security Council resolution was to limit the government's freedom in relation to {{the use of military force}} and to exercise diplomatic pressure in advance. Thus, the matter should be regarded as non-justiciable.|$|E
5|$|Many of Portland's middle- and upper-class citizens, {{including}} Dow, believed drunkenness {{was a great}} {{threat to}} the city's moral and financial well-being. In 1827, he became {{a founding member of}} the Maine Temperance Society. The group initially focused its efforts on the evils of distilled beverages, but by 1829, Dow declared he would <b>abstain</b> <b>from</b> all alcoholic beverages. At the same time, he associated himself with anti-Masonic and anti-slavery causes, and became more involved with politics generally. In the 1832 presidential election, unsatisfied with both Andrew Jackson and Henry Clay, Dow backed William Wirt, a minor-party candidate.|$|E

5|$|On November 19, 1834, Pierce married Jane Means Appleton (March 12, 1806– December 2, 1863), the {{daughter}} of Jesse Appleton, a Congregational minister {{and former president of}} Bowdoin College, and Elizabeth Means. The Appletons were prominent Whigs, in contrast with the Pierces' Democratic affiliation. Jane was shy, devoutly religious, and pro-temperance, encouraging Pierce to <b>abstain</b> <b>from</b> alcohol. She was somewhat gaunt, and constantly ill from tuberculosis and psychological ailments. She abhorred politics and especially disliked Washington, D.C., creating a tension that would continue throughout Pierce's political ascent.|$|E
5|$|The Voluntary Human Extinction Movement (VHEMT) is an {{environmental}} movement {{that calls for}} all people to <b>abstain</b> <b>from</b> reproduction to cause the gradual voluntary extinction of humankind. VHEMT supports human extinction primarily because, in the group's view, it would prevent environmental degradation. The group states that {{a decrease in the}} human population would prevent a significant amount of human-caused suffering. The extinctions of non-human species and the scarcity of resources required by humans are frequently cited by the group as evidence of the harm caused by human overpopulation.|$|E
5|$|The pilgrimage occurs {{from the}} 8th to 12th (or {{in some cases}} 13th) of Dhu al-Hijjah, the last month of the Islamic {{calendar}}. Because the Islamic calendar is lunar and the Islamic year is about eleven days shorter than the Gregorian year, the Gregorian date of Hajj changes from year to year. Ihram is the name given to the special spiritual state in which pilgrims wear two white sheets of seamless cloth and <b>abstain</b> <b>from</b> certain actions.|$|E

50|$|<b>Abstaining</b> <b>from</b> Reality: Filmed in Kenya and Uganda, the {{documentary}} provides {{a snapshot of}} the Bush administration’s abstinence-only approach to HIV prevention as a requirement for its global HIV/AIDS assistance. <b>Abstaining</b> <b>from</b> Reality examines how ideologically driven programs can endanger the lives of people they ostensibly protect. The film urges a balanced, comprehensive approach to preventing HIV infections by providing full and accurate information and a range of services which empower individuals to make informed decisions. <b>Abstaining</b> <b>from</b> Reality was accepted by the 2007 United Nations Association Film Festival.|$|R
5|$|You {{have more}} to do than simply <b>abstain</b> <b>from</b> riotous proceedings. You must not stand behind riots and let violators of the law promote the {{destruction}} of property. You are responsible for the violence that has been done, whether you were actually engaged in it or not. You on your part must drive away from you the evil-disposed people who have done so much harm, and discountenance in the plainest way everything tending to violence.|$|E
5|$|According {{to church}} doctrine, the sacraments {{of the church}} require the proper form, matter, and intent to be validly {{celebrate}}d. In addition, the Canon Laws for both the Latin Church and the Eastern Catholic Churches govern who may licitly celebrate certain sacraments, as well as strict rules about who may receive the sacraments. Notably, because the Church teaches that Christ {{is present in the}} Eucharist, those who are conscious of being in a state of mortal sin are forbidden to receive the sacrament until they have received absolution through the sacrament of Reconciliation (Penance). Catholics are normally obliged to <b>abstain</b> <b>from</b> eating {{for at least an hour}} before receiving the sacrament. Non-Catholics such are ordinarily prohibited from receiving the Eucharist as well.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi {{came from}} a poor family, and he {{had dropped out of}} the {{cheapest}} college he could afford. Mavji Dave Joshiji, a Brahmin priest and family friend, advised Gandhi and his family that he should consider law studies in London. In July 1888, his wife Kasturba gave birth to their first surviving son, Harilal. His mother was not comfortable about Gandhi leaving his wife and family, and going so far from home. Gandhi's uncle Tulsidas also tried to dissuade his nephew. Gandhi wanted to go. To persuade his wife and mother, Gandhi made a vow in front of his mother that he would <b>abstain</b> <b>from</b> meat, alcohol and women. Gandhi's brother Laxmidas, who was already a lawyer, cheered Gandhi's London studies plan and offered to support him. Putlibai gave Gandhi her permission and blessing.|$|E

Prior to the match, O'Neill was hounded by the media. The tourists decided to test him with short-pitched bowling, especially Fred Trueman. O'Neill decided to <b>abstain</b> <b>from</b> hooking, while attacking the spin of Jim Laker with a series of sweep shots. After four and a half hours of uncharacteristic restraint, he compiled 104 with an emphasis on off side play. He took a total of 2/67, removing Fred Trueman and Arthur Milton.|$|E
5|$|Nonviolence is an {{overriding}} theme within the Pali Canon. While the early texts condemn killing {{in the strongest}} terms, and portray the ideal king as a pacifist, such a king is nonetheless flanked by an army. It seems that the Buddha's teaching on nonviolence was not interpreted or put into practice in an uncompromisingly pacifist or anti-military-service way by early Buddhists. The early texts assume war to be a fact of life, and well-skilled warriors are viewed as necessary for defensive warfare. In Pali texts, injunctions to <b>abstain</b> <b>from</b> violence and involvement with military affairs are directed at members of the sangha; later Mahayana texts, which often generalise monastic norms to laity, require this of lay people as well.|$|E
5|$|The Angel of the Lord {{stated that}} Manoah's wife was to <b>abstain</b> <b>from</b> all {{alcoholic}} beverages, and her promised child {{was not to}} shave or cut his hair. He {{was to be a}} Nazirite from birth. In ancient Israel, those wanting to be especially dedicated to God for a time could take a Nazirite vow which included abstaining from wine and spirits, not cutting hair or shaving, and other requirements. The wife believed the Angel of the Lord; her husband was not present, so he prayed and asked God to send the messenger once again to teach them how to raise the boy {{who was going to be}} born.|$|E

25|$|Buddhists {{often take}} the precepts in formal ceremonies {{with members of}} the monastic Sangha, though they can also be {{undertaken}} as private personal commitments. Keeping each precept is said to develop its opposite positive virtue. <b>Abstaining</b> <b>from</b> killing for example develops kindness and compassion, while <b>abstaining</b> <b>from</b> stealing develops non-attachment.|$|R
5|$|The Mahabharata {{tells the}} story of Manasa's marriage. Sage Jagatkāru practised severe austerities and had decided to <b>abstain</b> <b>from</b> marriage. Once he came across a group of men hanging from a tree upside down. These men were his ancestors, who were doomed to misery as their {{children}} had not performed their last rites. So they advised Jagatkāru to marry and have a son who could free them of those miseries by performing the ceremonies. Vasuki offered his sister Manasa's hand to Jagatkāru. Manasa gave birth to a son, Astīka, who freed his ancestors. Astika also helped in saving the Nāga race from destruction when King Janamejaya decided to exterminate them by sacrificing them in his Yajna, fire offering.|$|E
5|$|The Northern Celestial Masters {{followed}} certain regular, communal rites. One {{of these}} communal rites involved formal banquets. These feasts could {{last as long}} as seven days. In order to purify themselves for feasts, members had to <b>abstain</b> <b>from</b> eating meat, garlic, green onions, ginger, leeks and onions. A banquet consisted of three courses – wine, rice and a vegetarian meal. Ritual activity during feasts and other activities usually involved a series of bows and prostrations as well as the burning of incense. Banquets were also held when someone died. During these banquets, attendees would perform rituals aimed at remitting the sins of the deceased.|$|E
5|$|In July 2003 general {{elections}} were held again, and the CPP won. However, {{they failed to}} secure two-thirds of all parliamentary seats, {{as required by the}} constitution to form a new government. The two runner-up parties of the election, FUNCINPEC and SRP, blocked the CPP from doing so. Instead, in August 2003 they filed complaints with the Constitutional Council over alleged electoral irregularities. After their complaints were rejected, FUNCINPEC and SRP threatened to boycott the swearing-in ceremony of parliamentarians. Sihanouk coaxed both parties to change their decision, stating that he would <b>abstain</b> <b>from</b> presiding over the ceremony as well if they did not comply with his wishes. Both parties eventually backed off from their threats, and the swearing-in ceremony was held in October 2003, with Sihanouk in attendance. The CPP, FUNCINPEC, and SRP held additional talks into 2004 to break the political stalemate, but to no avail. At the same time, Sihanouk proposed a unity government jointly led by politicians from all three political parties, which Hun Sen and Ranariddh both rebuffed.|$|E
