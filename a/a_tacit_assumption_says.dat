In this study three experiments are reported that clearly demonstrate that {{the time needed to}} detect changes in colouration of a moving stimulus becomes shorter with its velocity. The reduction of reaction time with increase of velocity is a purely kinematic effect independent on the reduction of reaction time caused by the stimulus uncertainty effects.

50|$|<b>A</b> <b>tacit</b> <b>assumption</b> of many is that TTM {{and product}} quality are {{opposing}} attributes of a development process. TTM may be improved (shortened) by skipping {{steps of the}} development process, thus compromising product quality. For those who use highly structured development processes such as Phase-gate model or Six Sigma, product development is often viewed as a clearly defined sequence of steps to be followed. Skipping a step—due to perceived time pressure, for example—may not only undercut quality but can ultimately lengthen TTM if the organization must complete or repeat the step later. Following this view, TTM is usually improved by following all of the prescribed steps.|$|R

The performance is mea-sured in terms of the accuracy of data mining results and the privacy protection of sensitive data. On the accuracy side, we address the problem of previous mea-sures and propose a new measure, named “effective sample size”, to solve this problem. We show that our new measure can be bounded without any knowledge of the data being mined and discuss when the bound can be met. On the privacy side, we identify <b>a</b> <b>tacit</b> <b>assumption</b> made by previous measures and show that the assumption is unrealistic in many situations. To solve the problem, we introduce a game theoretic framework for the measurement of privacy. ...|$|R

The other necessity is that the actual mining algorithms employed, whether supervised or unsupervised, must be able to handle sparse data.

For instance methods based on neural networks. or Ross Quinlan's ID3 algorithm. are highly accurate with good and representative samples of the problem, but perform badly with biased data. Most of times better model presentation with more careful and unbiased representation of input and output is enough. A particularly relevant area where finding the appropriate structure and model is the key issue is text mining.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — A {{textured}} occupancy grid map is {{an extremely}} versatile data structure. It {{can be used to}} render humanreadable views and for laser rangefinder localization algorithms. For camera-based localization, landmark or featurebased maps tend to be favored in current research. This may be because of <b>a</b> <b>tacit</b> <b>assumption</b> that working with a textured occupancy grid with a camera would be impractical. We demonstrate that a textured occupancy grid can be combined with an extremely simple monocular localization algorithm to produce a viable localization solution. Our approach is simple, efficient, and produces localization results comparable to laser localization results. A consequence of this result is that a single map representation, the textured occupancy grid, can now be used for humans, robots with laser rangefinders, and robots with just a single camera.

40|$|Most {{statistical}} procedures, including {{parameter estimation}} and hypothesis testing, {{are based on}} <b>a</b> <b>tacit</b> <b>assumption</b> of <b>a</b> statistical sample consisted of independent random variables. This is not consistent with geophysical processes, which usually exhibit a strong temporal dependence, often of long range. Such dependence implies substantial negative bias in the estimation of statistical parameters of dispersion, e. g., variance, as well as parameters of dependence, e. g., autocorrelation. Failure to account for this bias leads to distorted picture of the underlying process and results in erroneous modelling and prediction. Here we demonstrate the impact of neglecting dependence in parameter estimators by using synthetic examples from stochastic processes with sort- and long-range dependence, as well as rainfall datasets that exhibit high temporal dependence. We also propose a methodology to correctly account for the bias...|$|R

Likewise, a self-accelerated solution to the entire system of equations, both gravitation and matter equations of motion including, may exist, which provides an alternative explanation for the accelerated expansion of the Universe, without recourse to the hypothetic cosmological constant. ...|$|R

In this paper we show how notions of derivation-reduction and normal form can be used to avoid unnecessary work while parsing with grammars exhibiting derivational equivalence. With grammar regarded as analogous to logic, derivations are proofs; what we are advocating is proof-reduction, and normal form proof; the invocation of these logical techniques adds a further paragraph to the story of parsing-as-deduction...|$|R

The majority of the cellular elements comprising this cortex are well characterized morphologically at light and ultrastructural levels, as well as electrophysiologically at intra-and extracellular levels (26, 53).

It focuses on how locality and cache misses affect overall performance and allows for a quick analysis of different cache design techniques. <b>A</b> <b>tacit</b> <b>assumption</b> of AMAT is that a data access is either a hit or a miss, meaning the memory only supports sequential accesses and cannot have multiple accesses occurring simultaneously.

Although similar to the approach of modularizing programs described by Parnas, our approach is specific to decomposing modules.
