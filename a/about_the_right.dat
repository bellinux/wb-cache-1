25|$|Certain {{methods for}} the {{discovery}} of triangles of this kind are handed down, one which they refer to Plato, and another to Pythagoras. (The latter) starts from odd numbers. For it makes the odd number the smaller of the sides <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> angle; then it takes the square of it, subtracts unity and makes half the difference the greater of the sides <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> angle; lastly it adds unity to this and so forms the remaining side, the hypotenuse.|$|E

25|$|Two {{sorts of}} {{opposition}} to the law emerged.

This loss was felt almost immediately, as parents began withdrawing their children from private schools in the belief that these would soon cease to exist. The other was from religious private schools, such as those run by the Society of Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary, which were concerned <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> of parents {{to send their children to}} parochial schools.|$|E

25|$|A {{short time}} after {{entering}} the Columbia River and trading with the natives, ship and crew sailed to China {{to sell the}} pelts before returning to Boston in July 1793. Gray's entering of the Columbia was later used, during the Oregon boundary dispute, to support the American claim to the Oregon Country, against the claim of Britain. The American and British diplomats raised many points in addition to Gray's voyage to support their cases. Neither side could agree that the other had established a clear and exclusive right of sovereignty. The British raised several points questioning whether Gray's voyage up the Columbia River had any value in establishing sovereignty. The Americans raised counter-points. No agreement was reached on this and many other points <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to the Oregon Country. In the end the dispute was resolved by compromise in the Oregon Treaty of 1846. Upon Gray’s return, though, little was thought of his discovery. He did not publish it, and the long-term consequences to which it contributed were unforeseen.|$|E

25|$|The land redistribution, {{government}} reform, and colonization program strengthened and stabilized the Zhou government, {{while the}} Duke of Zhou invented the Mandate of Heaven {{in response to}} the rebellion. As a propaganda tool, the Mandate was used to legitimize the new dynasty morally and spiritually. Greatly empowered, the Zhou dynasty entered an era of prosperity and expansion that lasted until it was severely weakened by the war with Chu 961–957 BC. The triumvirate of Duke Dan of Zhou, King Cheng, and Duke Shi of Shao continued to rule the Zhou kingdom for three more years after the civil war. Eventually, however, Dan and his half-brother Shi fell out <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> form of government. Duke Dan, his own position as royal chancellor and regent in mind, opted for a meritocracy, while Duke Shi believed that the power should remain with the royal family to prevent usurpation. Possibly as result of this debate, the Duke of Zhou finally retired from court politics in 1036 BC, returning the official power to King Cheng and leaving the Duke of Shao as {{the most powerful man in}} the kingdom.|$|E
25|$|Some {{art historians}} once {{identified}} {{the child as}} a young Cosimo I de' Medici, but it is now generally accepted to be Giulia. The child in the portrait {{appears to be a}} little girl, rather than a boy, and her expression is anxious. Maria Salviati, who is dressed soberly as befitted a widow, is seen sheltering the vulnerable child against her side. Art historian Gabrielle Langdon argues that the girl's demeanor in the portrait is different than would have been expected for the child Cosimo, whose family anticipated his role as a strong leader from his earliest days. It would have been to Cosimo I's advantage to commission a portrait depicting his mother as an exemplary widow, affectionately bringing up the orphaned daughter of Cosimo I's predecessor. The child's full lips, round nose, and curly reddish hair also bear little resemblance to known portraits of Cosimo as a child, though they do to portraits of the young Alessandro. Other girls of <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> age who were at court during this period also do not resemble the child in the portrait. The portrait might {{be one of the first}} in Renaissance-era Europe of a girl of presumed African and European ancestry. This painting is in the permanent collection of The Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, Maryland.|$|E

But I called John Ajvide Lindqvist {{and it turned out}} we had the same idea of what kind of film we should make. It wasn't about money, but <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> constellation". A friend introduced Tomas Alfredson to the novel. While he normally does not like to receive books, because [...] "it's a private thing to choose what to read", he decided after a few weeks to read it. The depiction of bullying in the novel affected Alfredson deeply. [...] "It's very hard and very down-to-earth, unsentimental (...)

Ajvide Lindqvist already knew Alfredson's previous work, and he and Alfredson discovered that they [...] "understood each other very well".|$|E

Even though no complete skull of the intermediate age between RAM 14000 and adult Parasaurolophus has been found yet, a partial braincase of <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> size is known. At 25% of the total adult size, the juvenile show that crest growth of Parasaurolophus began sooner than in related genera, such as Corythosaurus. It has been suggested that Parasaurolophus adults bore such large crests, especially when compared to the related Corythosaurus, because of this difference in age between when their crests started developing. Its age also means that Parasaurolophus had a very fast growth rate, which took place in about a year. The crest of the juvenile is not long and tubular like the adults, but low and hemispherical.|$|E
