Michael Ettenberg, a researcher and later Vice President at RCA Laboratories' David Sarnoff Research Center in Princeton, New Jersey, devised a solution. A {{thin layer of}} aluminum oxide was deposited on the facet. If the aluminum oxide thickness is chosen correctly, it functions as an <b>anti-reflective</b> <b>coating,</b> reducing reflection at the surface. This alleviated the heating and COD at the facet.|$|E
25|$|While {{there are}} many types of PV systems known to be effective, {{crystalline}} silicon PV accounted for around 90% of the worldwide production of PV in 2013. Manufacturing silicon PV systems has several steps. First, polysilicon is processed from mined quartz until it is very pure (semi-conductor grade). This is melted down when small amounts of Boron, a group III element, are added to make a p-type semiconductor rich in electron holes. Typically using a seed crystal, an ingot of this solution is grown from the liquid polycrystalline. The ingot may also be cast in a mold. Wafers of this semiconductor material are cut from the bulk material with wire saws, and then go through surface etching before being cleaned. Next, the wafers are placed into a phosphorus vapor deposition furnace which lays a very thin layer of phosphorus, a group V element, which creates an N-type semiconducting surface. To reduce energy losses an <b>anti-reflective</b> <b>coating</b> {{is added to the}} surface, along with electrical contacts. After finishing the cell, cells are connected via electrical circuit according to the specific application and prepared for shipping and installation.|$|E

25|$|For {{the past}} years, {{researchers}} {{have been trying to}} reduce the price of solar cells while maximizing efficiency. Thin-film solar cell is a cost-effective second generation solar cell with much reduced thickness at the expense of light absorption efficiency. Efforts to maximize light absorption efficiency with reduced thickness have been made. Surface texturing is one of techniques used to reduce optical losses to maximize light absorbed. Currently, surface texturing techniques on silicon photovoltaics are drawing much attention. Surface texturing could be done in multiple ways. Etching single crystalline silicon substrate can produce randomly distributed square based pyramids on the surface using anisotropic etchants. Recent studies show that c-Si wafers could be etched down to form nano-scale inverted pyramids. Multicrystalline silicon solar cells, due to poorer crystallographic quality, are less effective than single crystal solar cells, but mc-Si solar cells are still being used widely due to less manufacturing difficulties. It is reported that multicrystalline solar cells can be surface-textured to yield solar energy conversion efficiency comparable to that of monocrystalline silicon cells, through isotropic etching or photolithography techniques. Incident light rays onto a textured surface do not reflect back out to the air as opposed to rays onto a flat surface. Rather some light rays are bounced back onto the other surface again due to the geometry of the surface. This process significantly improves light to electricity conversion efficiency, due to increased light absorption. This texture effect as well as the interaction with other interfaces in the PV module is a challenging optical simulation task. A particularly efficient method for modeling and optimization is the OPTOS formalism. In 2012, researchers at MIT reported that c-Si films textured with nanoscale inverted pyramids could achieve light absorption comparable to 30 times thicker planar c-Si. In combination with <b>anti-reflective</b> <b>coating,</b> surface texturing technique can effectively trap light rays within a thin film silicon solar cell. Consequently, required thickness for solar cells decreases with the increased absorption of light rays.|$|E
2500|$|The {{simplest}} interference <b>anti-reflective</b> <b>coating</b> {{consists of}} a single thin layer of transparent material with refractive index equal to the square root of the substrate's refractive index. In air, such a coating theoretically gives zero reflectance for light with wavelength (in the coating) equal to four times the coating's thickness. Reflectance is also decreased for wavelengths in a broad band around the center. A layer of thickness equal to a quarter of some design wavelength is called a [...] "quarter-wave layer".|$|E
2500|$|The {{simplest}} form of <b>anti-reflective</b> <b>coating</b> {{was discovered}} by Lord Rayleigh in 1886. The optical glass {{available at the time}} tended to develop a tarnish on its surface with age, due to chemical reactions with the environment. Rayleigh tested some old, slightly tarnished pieces of glass, and found to his surprise that they transmitted more light than new, clean pieces. The tarnish replaces the air-glass interface with two interfaces: an air-tarnish interface and a tarnish-glass interface. Because the tarnish has a refractive index between those of glass and air, each of these interfaces exhibits less reflection than the air-glass interface did. In fact, the total of the two reflections is less than that of the [...] "naked" [...] air-glass interface, as can be calculated from the Fresnel equations.|$|E

In this thesis laser-induced contamination growth on high-reflective coated optics is investigated for UV irradiation of 355 nm with naphthalene as contamination material. Four different kinds of optics were investigated: three high-reflective coated optics fabricated by Electron Beam Deposition, Magnetron Sputtering and Ion Beam Sputtering technique and one <b>anti-reflective</b> <b>coated</b> optic fabricated by Electron Beam Deposition technique.

40|$|Understanding when, how, and if {{bacteria}} swim is key {{to understanding}} critical ecological and biological processes, from carbon cycling to infection. Imaging motility by traditional light microscopy is limited by focus depth, requiring cells to be constrained in z. Holographic microscopy offers an instantaneous 3 D snapshot of a large sample volume, and is therefore ideal in principle for quantifying unconstrained bacterial motility. However, resolving and tracking individual cells is difficult due to the low amplitude and phase contrast of the cells; the index of refraction of typical bacteria {{differs from that of}} water only at the second decimal place. In this work we present a combination of optical and sample-handling approaches to facilitating bacterial tracking by holographic phase imaging. The first is the design of the microscope, which is an off-axis design with the optics along a common path, which minimizes alignment issues while providing all of the advantages of off-axis holography. Second, we use <b>anti-reflective</b> <b>coated</b> etalon glass in the design of sample chambers, which reduce internal reflections. Improvement seen with the antireflective coating is seen primarily in phase imaging, and its quantification is presented here. Finally, dyes may be used to increase phase contrast according to the Kramers-Kronig relations. Results using three test strains are presented, illustrating the different types of bacterial motility characterized by an enteric organism (Escherichia coli), an environmental organism (Bacillus subtilis), and a marine organism (Vibrio alginolyticus).

40|$|AbstractTo further {{increase}} {{the efficiency of}} PV modules, a variety of technical approaches targeting losses on cell and module level are pursued. Module efficiency is usually stated at standard test conditions (STC) whereas conditions during operation {{in the field are}} most of the time very different. From a customer perspective the specific energy yield is the far more important parameter, as it has immediate effect on the levelized costs of electricity(LCOE), which describes the costs of a kWh produced. The specific energy yield is strongly dependent on module characteristics at different operating points. Some of these properties such as low light characteristic, thermal behaviour or incident angle dependency can be influenced by technological changes resulting in a change of specific energy yield. To predict the quantitative effect of technological changes on annual energy production, module characteristics can be determined by outdoor measurements and fed into a simulation tool to quantify the gain or loss in annual energy yield of the changes applied. In this paper, two technological changes on cell and module level are investigated. First, the effect of <b>anti-reflective</b> <b>coated</b> glass is evaluated. The second investigation is related to a PERC cell structure. Therefore measured outdoor data from a photovoltaic test site are analysed to evaluate changes in module design with respect to their effect on outdoor performance. The results are compared to long term measurements of system installations to confirm the differences in energy yield. It is shown that technological changes can be applied on module and cell level that not only increase power under standard test conditions, but also lead to an additional improvement of the energy harvest per kWp and thus lower the LCOE...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{authors have}} {{previously}} reported that <b>Anti-reflective</b> (AR) <b>coated</b> glass {{results in a}} 2. 4 to 3 % increase in output power for crystalline silicon PV modules [1].

Individual AR coated modules have been tested at the BP Solar Homebush, Australia site and at a third party site in Germany. In all cases the AR coated modules produced 4 to 5 % more energy than the controls. In order to better characterize the energy gain, two large arrays (each 41. 5 kW), identical except {{for the type of}} glass used, have been installed at a site in Germany.

Measurement results are presented showing the change in transmittance characteristics as a function of contaminant deposit thickness and vacuum ultra-violet (vuv) exposure levels. Measurement results show an initial degradation in the transmittance of the contaminated sample.
