5|$|Fielding's ninth play, the {{unsuccessful}} The Letter Writers Or, a New Way to Keep a Wife at Home, ran {{for four}} nights as a companion piece to The Tragedy of Tragedies but was soon after replaced by The Welsh Opera on 22 April 1731. The play followed two characters whose wives <b>are</b> <b>busy</b> having affairs {{and how they}} attempt to keep their wives faithful. The immoral characters are forgiven within the play {{and there is a}} lack of moral commentary within the plot.|$|E
5|$|In the phlaeothripids {{that feed}} on fungi, males compete {{to protect and}} mate with females, and then defend the egg-mass. Males fight by {{flicking}} their rivals away with their abdomen, and may kill with their foretarsal teeth. Small males may sneak in to mate while the larger males <b>are</b> <b>busy</b> fighting. In the Merothripidae and in the Aeolothripidae, males are again polymorphic with large and small forms, and probably also compete for mates, so the strategy may well be ancestral among the Thysanoptera.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} {{was set in}} a dystopian future {{controlled}} by Cyber-cops (referred to as such by director Brett Leonard.) It depicted an individual who records the Cyber-cops beating a man, only to be noticed and attacked himself. His camera is destroyed and the Cyber-cops leave him unconscious on the ground, as they <b>are</b> <b>busy</b> trying to put down a riot elsewhere in the city. Alone, his camera equipment lands on him and is absorbed into his body, causing him to dramatically morph into a cyborg. The cyborg then joins the riot, leading the rebels to victory.|$|E

5|$|The Simpson family <b>are</b> <b>busy</b> {{preparing}} for Bart's birthday party. Homer sees a commercial on television for a prank microphone called the Superstar Celebrity Microphone {{that can be}} used to tap into localized AM radio systems and instantly decides to buy one for Bart. Subsequently, Bart experiences a crushingly disappointing birthday party when all his gifts turn out to be useless things like a cactus, a label maker, and a new suit. At first, he is also disappointed by the microphone, but later finds a use for it in creating practical jokes, such as tricking Ned's boys Rod and Todd into believing that God is talking to them, listening in on Lisa and Janey's conversations about boys, and persuading Homer that Martians are invading the Earth.|$|E
25|$|Trains calling at Harringay use the {{low-speed}} {{rail tracks}} {{in front of}} the platforms; there are five more tracks passing through and around the vicinity of the station. Two of these are used for high-speed Virgin Trains East Coast, Hull Trains, Grand Central and other Great Northern services, and the other three are used for freight services. Occasionally, when these lines <b>are</b> <b>busy,</b> the low-speed tracks are used for the faster services.|$|E

25|$|There {{are also}} private {{ambulance}} companies, with paid employees, but often on contract {{to the local}} or national government. Many private companies provide only the patient transport elements of ambulance care (i.e. nonurgent), although in some places these private services are contracted to provide emergency care, or to form a 'second tier' response, where they only respond to emergencies {{when all of the}} full-time emergency ambulance crews <b>are</b> <b>busy</b> or to respond to non-emergency home calls.

25|$|Towards {{the end of}} the {{real-time}} strategy game , it {{is revealed}} that both the Tleilaxu and the Spacing Guild have been secretly experimenting with the sandworms of Arrakis in a remote research facility in the desert as the three great Houses of the Landsraad, the Atreides, Ordos and Harkonnen, <b>are</b> <b>busy</b> waging the War of Assassins amongst each other. It appears that the Tleilaxu have discovered the link between the Spice Melange and the sandworms as mentioned above. They plot to seize the Golden Lion Throne by breeding a man-worm, known as the Emperor Worm, and then fusing it with the Water of Life, mercilessly taken from the Lady Elara — who was held prisoner by the Reverend Mother (in truth a Tleilaxu Face Dancer) {{since the beginning of the}} game — giving the Worm almost god-like powers.|$|E
25|$|Dinner is {{interrupted}} by Don Gabriel del Lago, a friend of Don Santiago's and a neighboring Spanish-Mexican landowner, who brings news that Texas has been taken from Mexico by the Americans, and that American soldiers {{under the leadership of}} Zachary Taylor have infiltrated the territory and <b>are</b> <b>busy</b> establishing defensive outposts. Each of the characters responds to this turn of events differently: Don Santiago scoffs, refusing to consider Americans any threat to his way of life; Alvaro wants to know what military action can be undertaken to stave off the American forces; Luis Gonzaga contemplates whether or not Americans really are the uncultured hoodlums he has heard them to be; María de los Ángeles, under the assumption that Americans are not Catholic, assumes the invasion is punishment from God for Mexico's sins; and Susanita wonders {{what it would be like}} to dance with a tall white-skinned man.|$|E

5000|$|A fourth method, also {{available}} in English, is using zijn (to be) with the adverb and preposition bezig met (busy with) and the gerund, e.g., Ik ben bezig met lezen (lit. I <b>am</b> <b>busy</b> with reading), meaning I <b>am</b> (<b>busy)</b> reading. If there is an object, there are two forms: 1. the gerund is preceded by the neuter article het and followed by the preposition van (of) and the object, e.g. Ik ben bezig met het lezen van deze brief (lit. I <b>am</b> <b>busy</b> with the reading of this letter), meaning I am reading this letter; 2. the object comes before the full infinitive (instead of the gerund), e.g. Ik ben bezig met deze brief te lezen (lit. I <b>am</b> <b>busy</b> with this letter to read), meaning I am reading this letter. This form of the continuous is mostly used for a real (physical) activity. Grammar-wise, {{it is possible to}} say zij is bezig te denken (lit. she <b>is</b> <b>busy</b> to think, she is thinking) or hij is bezig te slapen (lit. he <b>is</b> <b>busy</b> to sleep, he is sleeping), but it sounds strange in Dutch. In these cases, other forms of the continuous are generally used, specifically the second method: Zij is aan het denken and hij is aan het slapen.|$|R

25|$|In the east, Islamic art's {{rejection}} of iconography led to emphasis on geometric patterns, calligraphy, and architecture. Further east, religion dominated artistic styles and forms too. India and Tibet saw emphasis on painted sculptures and dance, while religious painting borrowed many conventions from sculpture {{and tended to}} bright contrasting colors with emphasis on outlines. China saw the flourishing of many art forms: jade carving, bronzework, pottery (including the stunning terracotta army of Emperor Qin), poetry, calligraphy, music, painting, drama, fiction, etc. Chinese styles vary greatly from era to era and each one is traditionally named after the ruling dynasty. So, for example, Tang dynasty paintings are monochromatic and sparse, emphasizing idealized landscapes, but Ming dynasty paintings <b>are</b> <b>busy</b> and colorful, and focus on telling stories via setting and composition. Japan names its styles after imperial dynasties too, and also saw much interplay between the styles of calligraphy and painting. Woodblock printing became important in Japan after the 17th century.|$|E
25|$|When {{they arrive}} at the castle, {{there is no one}} to be found. It turns out that Pelayo's family was led by his wife, Gaudiosa, into hiding. When the Moors came, Adosinda was able to defeat the raiding party and free any captives. After blowing a horn as a signal to his people, Pelayo is reunited with his people. Roderick is reunited with his mother but quickly leaves before he talks to her. When Siverian goes {{to find out what was}} wrong, he realises that Roderick is {{overcome}} with emotion and figures out that Roderick was his old student. The plot transitions to the Moors army as they <b>are</b> <b>busy</b> attacking any rebels. The army is supported by the Spanish traitors. Orpas, a Moorish leader who wanted Florinda as his wife and Julian's lands as his own, begins to work against Julian and turns the Moors against him. After Orpas accuses Julian of inability to convert his own daughter to Islam, Florinda returns to her father with Roderick at her side. After fighting over religion, Roderick tells Julian that Julian is responsible for Spain's misery. Julian attacks Roderick for raping his daughter, but Florinda intervenes and defends Roderick.|$|E
25|$|The new England Bandy Federation {{was set up}} on January 2nd 2017 at {{a meeting}} held in the {{historic}} old skaters public house, the Lamb and Flag in Welney in Norfolk, replacing the Bandy Federation of England {{which was founded in}} 2010 but where the activity had been slowing the last years. Chair of England Bandy Federation is Robert Johnson of Bury village where the first bandy matches are recorded and the Bury Fen Bandy Club played. (C.G. Tebbutt of BFBC set up the first national association for bandy in 1891.) President is Rev Lyn Gibb-de Swarte of Littleport and past resident of Streatham in south west London, where she was chair of the ice speed club, ice hockey club and of the association of ice clubs etc. Vice President, Les Mead.

25|$|A common predatory {{technique}} {{that has been}} observed among benthic elasmobranchs is ambushing behavior. As it pertains to rays, skates, carpet sharks, and angel sharks, the predator searches for suitable hiding environments such as sand, pebbles, coral, or algae that match its coloration or patterning, which {{is also known as}} aggressive mimicry. Ambushing is a behavior in which a predator relies on its coloring, body structure, or the environment as an advantage in concealing itself while waiting on unsuspecting prey to enter its striking range. There have been recorded occasions where this form of ambushing behavior of stingrays and related benthic sharks has been directed towards a common prey type. One example of this occasion involves the chokka squid, (Loligo vulgaris reynaudii), which spawns in the inshore coastal habitats around South Africa. The diamond ray (Gymnura natalensis) frequently relies on aggressive mimicry as it blends into sandy habitats waiting for preoccupied female chokka squids who <b>are</b> <b>busy</b> spawning. Diamond rays then shoot off from the bottom substrates and use suction feeding to ingest the spawning squids and their eggs. Suction feeding works in conjunction and is aided by ram filter feeding, which is demonstrated by pelagic rays including the manta ray (Manta birostris) and the closely related devil rays (Mobula sp.). Many of the pelagic rays have external mouth structures called cephalic lobes that assist in siphoning in water and planktonic organisms as the rays swim in acrobatic patterns in these patches of food. A stingray's diet includes small fish, snails, clams, and shrimp, and some other small sea creatures.|$|E
