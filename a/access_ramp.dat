5|$|Wind {{and water}} damage across the Outer Banks was extensive. Strong waves and {{the storm surge}} from Hurricane Isabel knocked about 30 to 40 houses and several motels off of their pilings. Two {{families}} who did not evacuate were nearly swept out to sea when their home was destroyed. Local rescue was unable to reach them; however, they were ultimately able to reach safety. The rough waves greatly affected piers in Nags Head, Rodanthe, and Frisco, with three being completely destroyed. Several locations along North Carolina Highway 12 were partially washed out or covered with debris, and 15foot (4.5m) sections of pavement {{on both sides of}} a bridge near Ocracoke were washed away. Strong waves destroyed a beach <b>access</b> <b>ramp,</b> as well. Several thousand homes and businesses were damaged by the passage of the hurricane, and damage in Dare County totalled nearly $350million (2003USD, ($ USD)). In the Outer Banks, no deaths or injuries were reported.|$|E

Considerable work {{has been carried out}} on constructing an <b>access</b> <b>ramp</b> to the towpath and restoring the bridge, which often forms the backdrop to wedding photographs taken in the hotel grounds. Just beyond the bridge, another stream supplies water, but the canal bed is no longer owned by British Waterways after that point, and has been filled in.|$|E
25|$|Through Carle Place, the Northern State enters exit31, which {{connects to}} NY25, {{crossing}} under NY25B (Hillside Avenue).

After the interchange, the parkway proceeds northeast, passing under Carle Road in Westbury, entering The Hedges section, where exit32, serving Post Road, interchanges. The Northern State then crosses through Birchwood Knolls and West Jericho as a six-lane parkway, where it enters exit33, the northern terminus of the Wantagh State Parkway.

500|$|The Lynnwood City Center {{light rail}} station will be {{elevated}} [...] above the direct <b>access</b> <b>ramp</b> and southeastern parking lot, crossing {{from the southwest}} to the northeast. The station will have two entrances connected to its mezzanine below platform level: one that travels across the roadway and leads to a ground-level plaza; and another with direct access to a five-story parking garage with 500 stalls. The existing bus station would be retained and slightly expanded to accommodate more layover space. Parking at the transit center would increase to 1,900 stalls, with room to expand further.|$|E

500|$|Frank Hague, {{mayor of}} Jersey City and {{boss of the}} state's {{political}} machine, directed the state to avoid the open cuts that were already common where the railroads crossed Bergen Hill, and to include an <b>access</b> <b>ramp</b> in Kearny to spur industrial development. Construction of the highway, which was mostly raised on embankments and passed through Bergen Hill in a cut, began in mid-1925. The two major eastern and western sections in Jersey City and Newark—including the viaduct leading to the [...] "covered roadway" [...] (Route139) and the embankments in eastern Newark—were opened on December 16, 1928, {{about a year after}} the tunnel opened.

500|$|At the {{intersection}} with CR 653, Route 44 enters Paulsboro and passes more developed areas, soon meeting CR 678. The route intersects CR 667 {{in the center}} of Paulsboro before crossing the Mantua Creek on a lift bridge and entering wetlands within West Deptford Township. Here, the road heads into a mix of rural lands and development, crossing CR 656 and the Little Mantua Creek. Route 44 intersects the Mid-Atlantic Parkway, which provides access to I-295 and US 130 a short distance to the south, before continuing into inhabited areas. Here, the road crosses the Conrail line and CR 643. The route becomes a four-lane road and has access ramps to and from southbound I-295/US 130 prior to coming to a crossroads with CR 640 in Thorofare.
