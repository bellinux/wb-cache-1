5|$|Possession of {{a firearm}} {{that does not}} belong to {{category}} D without a gun license (as well as sale, manufacturing, procurment, etc.) is <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>offense</b> which carries a penalty of up to two years imprisonment (up to eight years in defined cases).|$|E
5|$|New Jersey {{is one of}} {{only two}} states (along with Wisconsin) that {{classify}} DUI as a traffic violation, and not <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>offense,</b> except in cases of serious injury or death. Because it is not <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>offense,</b> those charged in New Jersey with DUI and related offenses are not fingerprinted, do {{not have the right to}} a jury trial, DUI arrests and convictions are not submitted to the FBI's NCIC criminal database, and DUI arrests and convictions cannot be expunged. Statutory criminal defenses (e.g. duress, entrapment) are not available for DUI, and in State v. Hammond, the state Supreme Court upheld the conviction of a person who drove after unknowingly having his drink spiked with alcohol. Common-law criminal defenses are available in DUI cases, and a state appellate court reversed the conviction of a person who drove while intoxicated in order to escape assailants, citing the doctrine of necessity.|$|E

5|$|While {{technically}} minded shortwave listening hobbyists dwindled {{during the}} war years {{due in part to the}} demands of military service, casual listeners seeking war news from foreign broadcasters increased. Shortwave receiver manufacturers contributed to war production. Zenith launched the multi-band Trans-Oceanic series of radios in 1942. In some other countries, {{during the war}}, listening to foreign stations was <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>offense.</b> Established in 1939, 35-kilowatt Chinese shortwave station XGOY broadcast programming aimed at listening-restricted Japan. The station was often bombed by the Japanese.|$|E
5|$|The President of Croatia enjoys immunityâ€”the {{president}} {{may not be}} arrested, nor can any criminal proceedings be instituted against the president without prior consent from the Constitutional Court. The only case in which immunity does not apply is if {{the president has been}} caught in the act of committing <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>offense,</b> which carries a penalty of imprisonment for more than five years. In such a case the state body that has detained the president must notify the President of the Constitutional Court immediately.|$|E
5|$|Michigan, led by {{the young}} and hot-headed Mason, responded {{with the passage of}} the Pains and Penalties Act just six days after Lucas County was formed; the act made it <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>offense</b> for Ohioans to carry out {{governmental}} actions in the Strip, under penalty of a fine up to $1,000, up to five years imprisonment at hard labor, or both. Acting as commander-in-chief of the territory, Mason appointed Brigadier-General Joseph W. Brown of the Third U.S. Brigade to head the state militia, with the instructions to be ready to act against Ohio trespassers. Lucas obtained legislative approval for a militia of his own, and he soon sent forces to the Strip area. The Toledo War had begun.|$|E

5|$|New Jersey prohibits plea {{bargaining}} in DUI cases unless the prosecutor {{believes there is}} insufficient evidence to prove the case, and New Jersey does not offer hardship (work) licenses for people convicted of DUI. Because DUI is not <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>offense</b> in New Jersey, defendants are ineligible for pretrial intervention (PTI) and other diversion programs. A previous DUI conviction, in New Jersey or another state, cannot be used to disqualify a person from such programs, and those charged with an indictable offense stemming from drunk driving (e.g. cases involving serious injuries or eluding arrest) are eligible for PTI. A person convicted of DUI is barred from recovering accident-related damages from other drivers, but {{may be able to}} sue the business or person who served them alcoholic beverages.|$|E
5|$|New Jersey's {{state parks}} and forests {{prohibit}} the possession or {{consumption of alcohol}}ic beverages except at pre-approved events. There is no state law against public consumption of alcohol in other locations, but most municipalities have open container laws prohibiting or restricting public consumption. The fine for alcohol possession in a state park is $71, whereas municipal fines for public consumption violations can {{be as high as}} $2000, although they are generally much lower. Per the Alcoholism Treatment and Rehabilitation Act (ATRA), public intoxication without accompanying disorderly behavior is not <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>offense,</b> and municipalities are prohibited from making ordinances against public intoxication. New Jersey law allows a police officer to take people found to be intoxicated in public to their residence or to a medical facility.|$|E
5|$|Several {{investigations}} ensued, including by the U.S. Congress and the three-person, Reagan-appointed Tower Commission. Neither {{found any}} evidence that President Reagan himself knew {{of the extent of}} the multiple programs. Ultimately the sale of weapons to Iran was not deemed <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>offense</b> but charges were brought against five individuals for their support of the Contras. Those charges, however, were later dropped because the administration refused to declassify certain documents. The indicted conspirators faced various lesser charges instead. In the end, fourteen administration officials were indicted, including then-Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger. Eleven convictions resulted, some of which were vacated on appeal. The rest of those indicted or convicted were all pardoned {{in the final days of}} the presidency of George H.W. Bush, who had been Vice President at the time of the affair. The Iran-Contra Affair and the ensuing deception to protect senior administration officials including President Reagan has been cast as an example of post-truth politics.|$|E

When asked where Holtzclaw is currently located, a DoC spokesperson Terri Watkins replied, [...] "We {{are not going to}} comment, {{it is a matter of}} security." [...] It was later confirmed that he is being held under an alias in an undisclosed Oklahoma state prison, which would not be unusual for a former police officer.|$|R

5|$|The censors {{were the}} magistrates who {{enforced}} the ethical {{standards of the}} Senate. Whenever a censor punished a senator, they had to allege some specific failing. Possible reasons for punishing a member included corruption, abuse of capital punishment, or the disregard of a colleague's veto, constitutional precedent, or the auspices. Senators who failed to obey various laws could also be punished. While punishment could include impeachment (expulsion) from the Senate, often a punishment was less severe than outright expulsion. While the standard was high for expelling a member from the Senate, {{it was easier to}} deny a citizen the right to join the Senate. Various moral failings could result in one not being allowed to join the Senate, including bankruptcy, prostitution, or a prior history of having been a gladiator. One law (the Lex repetundarum of 123 BC) made it illegal for a citizen to become a senator if they had been convicted of <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>offense.</b> Many of these laws were enacted in the last century of the Republic, as public corruption began reaching unprecedented levels.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{many other}} states, New Jersey imposes no {{restrictions}} on the types or quantities of alcoholic beverages that a person of legal age may purchase. Grain alcohol, caffeinated alcoholic beverages, and absinthe can be legally sold, and state law imposes no limitations on the alcohol content of beer or wine. New Jersey does not require kegs to be registered, and state ABC regulations prohibit municipal keg registration laws. A resident can import any amount of alcohol into the state for personal use, but a $50 permit is required if more than 3 gallons of beer, 1 gallon of wine, or a half-gallon of spirits are being imported within a 24-hour period. Any person who is 21 years or older may produce up to 200 gallons of beer or wine per year. No permit is required, but any brewing or winemaking must take place at a private home or non-commercial property, and any beer and wine produced cannot be sold. It is <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>offense</b> to possess an unregistered still, or distill any amount of hard liquor.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{repeal of}} Prohibition and {{the passage of}} the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law, the ABC issued {{regulations}} that prohibited bars and liquor stores from selling alcohol to a person under 21, which was considered the age of majority at that time. In 1939, it became <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>offense</b> to sell alcohol to a person under 21, and for a person under 21 to purchase or consume alcohol in a licensed establishment. The state criminalized the underage possession of alcohol in motor vehicles and other public areas in 1957, possibly in response to young New Jerseyans traveling to New York, where the drinking age was 18, and returning home with liquor. For many years laws against underage drinking and the serving of alcohol to minors did not apply on private property, though an adult who supplied a substantial amount of liquor to an underage person could possibly be prosecuted for contributing to the delinquency of a minor Furthermore, arrests and criminal prosecutions for underage drinking in bars or public areas were very uncommon before the 1980s.|$|E
