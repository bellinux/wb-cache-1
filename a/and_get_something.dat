500|$|In March 1969, Harrison gave [...] "Something" [...] to Joe Cocker to record, having {{decided that}} it was more likely to become a hit with Cocker than with Lomax. Referring to this and similar {{examples}} where Harrison placed his overlooked songs with other recording artists, Ken Scott has refuted the idea that he lacked confidence as a songwriter in the Beatles, saying: [...] "I think he was totally confident about the songs. The insecurity may have been, if the Beatles kept going, 'How many songs am I {{going to be able to}} get on each album?', and with the backlog sort of mounting up... get it out there, <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>something</b> from it." ...|$|E

Up until recently, all I used for effects was a wah-pedal and I only used that on two songs," [...] said guitarist Kenwyn House.|$|R
60|$|DOYLE. Oh yes it does. But it's {{the charm}} of a dream. Live in contact with dreams <b>and</b> you will <b>get</b> <b>something</b> of their charm: live in contact with facts <b>and</b> you will <b>get</b> <b>something</b> of their brutality.
