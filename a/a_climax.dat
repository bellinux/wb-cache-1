5|$|On {{the eastern}} side of the pyramid, the ruins of a small {{satellite}} pyramid as well as of a mortuary temple have been discovered. Both have been heavily affected by stone robbing, which started as early as the New Kingdom and reached <b>a</b> <b>climax</b> during the Saite (664–525 BCE) and Persian (525–402 BCE) periods, making a modern reconstruction of the temple layout impossible.|$|E

50|$|These {{featured}} a steam engine unit with two vertical cylinders {{mounted in the}} center of the locomotive. Class <b>A</b> <b>Climaxes</b> had <b>a</b> frame similar to a flatcar with wooden boxcar-like bodywork built up above it to protect the crew and fuel from the elements—this could be more or less covering between locomotive to locomotive. The front half of the locomotive, in front of the engine unit, contained the boiler. In smaller examples this may have been a vertical boiler, while in larger ones a tee boiler was employed. Class <b>A</b> <b>Climaxes</b> were small locomotives, generally under seventeen tons. Class <b>A</b> <b>Climaxes,</b> unlike Heisler and Shay locomotives, had two-speed gearboxes.|$|R

Although Quatermass succeeds in launching a three-man crew, the rocket vastly overshoots its projected orbit and returns to Earth much later than planned, crash-landing in London. Only one of the crew, Victor Carroon, remains, and he has been taken over by an alien presence, eventually forcing Quatermass to destroy him and the other two crewmembers who have been absorbed into him in <b>a</b> <b>climax</b> set in Westminster Abbey.|$|E
5|$|Enna-Dagan also {{received}} tribute, and his reign fell entirely within {{the reign of}} Irkab-Damu of Ebla, who managed to defeat Mari and end the tribute. Mari defeated Ebla's ally Nagar in year seven of the Eblaite vizier Ibrium's term, causing the blockage of trade routes between Ebla and southern Mesopotamia via upper Mesopotamia. The war reached <b>a</b> <b>climax</b> when the Eblaite vizier Ibbi-Sipish made an alliance with Nagar and Kish to defeat Mari in a battle near Terqa. Ebla itself suffered its first destruction {{a few years after}} Terqa in c. 2300 BC, during the reign of the Mariote king Hidar.|$|E
5|$|The Bengal Renaissance and the Brahmo Samaj {{socio-cultural}} reform movements significantly {{influenced the}} cultural and economic life of Bengal. Between 1905 and 1911 an abortive {{attempt was made to}} divide the province of Bengal into two zones. Bengal suffered from the Great Bengal famine in 1943, which claimed 3million lives during World WarII. Bengalis {{played a major role in}} the Indian independence movement, in which revolutionary groups such as Anushilan Samiti and Jugantar were dominant. Armed attempts against the British Raj from Bengal reached <b>a</b> <b>climax</b> when Subhas Chandra Bose led the Indian National Army from Southeast Asia against the British.|$|E

5|$|The {{campaign}} was not uniform in approach; British and French forces were {{limited by the}} dictates of the wider Mediterranean and global conflict, and consequently ship numbers fluctuated. Although numerous commanders held commands in the region, {{the two most important}} personalities were those of William Hoste and Bernard Dubourdieu, whose exploits were celebrated in their respective national newspapers during 1810 and 1811. The campaign between the two officers reached <b>a</b> <b>climax</b> at the Battle of Lissa in March 1811, when Dubourdieu was killed and his squadron defeated by Hoste in a celebrated action.|$|E
5|$|The {{night of}} September 5/6, events reached <b>a</b> <b>climax</b> inside P'ohang-dong. The ROK {{division}} commander, Brigadier General Lee Jun Shik and {{several members of}} his senior staff claimed they became sick after their command post was hit with artillery fire. The division withdrew from P'ohang-dong, and on September 6 it was again in North Korean hands. The ROK Army relieved both the ROK I Corps and the ROK 3rd Division commanders. At this time new commanders were appointed for these major commands. Brigadier General Kim Paik Il took command of ROK I Corps, while Capital Division came under command of Colonel Song Yo Ch'an, and ROK 3rd Division came under command of Colonel Lee Jong Ch'an.|$|E
5|$|The {{successful}} {{opening night}} marked {{the climax of}} Wilde's career but also heralded his downfall. The Marquess of Queensberry, whose son Lord Alfred Douglas was Wilde's lover, planned to present the writer with a bouquet of rotten vegetables and disrupt the show. Wilde was tipped off and Queensberry was refused admission. Soon afterwards their feud came to <b>a</b> <b>climax</b> in court, where Wilde's homosexual double life was revealed to the Victorian public and he was eventually sentenced to imprisonment. His notoriety caused the play, despite its early success, to be closed after 86performances. After his release, he published the play from exile in Paris, but he wrote no further comic or dramatic work.|$|E

Amid the chaos that surrounded Barre's flight from the capital, {{the remnants of the}} Somali National Armed Forces dissolved. In 1992, the 15-member Security Council imposed an arms embargo via United Nations Security Council Resolution 733 in order to stop the flow of weapons to feuding militia groups. Much equipment was left in situ, deteriorating, and was sometimes discovered and photographed by intervention forces in the early 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Although {{not without}} conflict, European Canadians' early {{interactions}} with First Nations and Inuit populations were relatively peaceful. First Nations and Métis peoples {{played a critical}} part {{in the development of}} European colonies in Canada, particularly for their role in assisting European coureur des bois and voyageurs in the exploration of the continent during the North American fur trade. The Crown and indigenous peoples began interactions during the European colonization period, though the Inuit, in general, had more limited interaction with European settlers. However, from the late 18th century, European Canadians encouraged indigenous peoples to assimilate into their own culture. These attempts reached <b>a</b> <b>climax</b> in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with forced integration and relocations. A period of redress is underway, which started with the appointment of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada by the Government of Canada in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in {{the summer}} of 54 BC, a wave of {{political}} corruption and violence swept Rome. This chaos reached <b>a</b> <b>climax</b> in January of 52 BC, when Clodius was murdered in a gang war by Milo. On 1 January 49 BC, an agent of Caesar presented an ultimatum to the senate. The ultimatum was rejected, and the senate then passed a resolution which declared that if Caesar did not lay down his arms by July of that year, he would be considered an enemy of the Republic. Meanwhile, the senators adopted Pompey as their new champion against Caesar. On 7 January of 49 BC, the senate passed a senatus consultum ultimum, which vested Pompey with dictatorial powers. Pompey's army, however, was composed largely of untested conscripts. On 10 January, Caesar crossed the Rubicon with his veteran army (in violation of Roman laws) and marched towards Rome. Caesar's rapid advance forced Pompey, the consuls and the senate to abandon Rome for Greece. Caesar entered the city unopposed.|$|E

5|$|Disturbance is {{important}} in the creation of biodiverse habitats. In the absence of disturbance, <b>a</b> <b>climax</b> vegetation cover develops that prevents the establishment of other species. Wildflower meadows are sometimes created by conservationists but most of the flowering plants used are either annuals or biennials and disappear after a few years in the absence of patches of bare ground on which their seedlings can grow. Lightning strikes and toppled trees in tropical forests allow species richness to be maintained as pioneering species move in to fill the gaps created. Similarly coastal habitats can become dominated by kelp until the seabed is disturbed by a storm and the algae swept away, or shifting sediment exposes new areas for colonisation. Another cause of disturbance is when an area may be overwhelmed by an invasive introduced species which is not kept under control by natural enemies in its new habitat.|$|E
5|$|The {{resistance}} came to <b>a</b> <b>climax</b> in 1794. In May of that year, {{federal district}} attorney William Rawle issued subpoenas {{for more than}} 60 distillers in Pennsylvania who had not paid the excise tax. Under the law then in effect, distillers who received these writs would be obligated to travel to Philadelphia to appear in federal court. For farmers on the western frontier, such a journey was expensive, time-consuming, and beyond their means. At the urging of William Findley, Congress modified this law on June 5, 1794, allowing excise trials {{to be held in}} local state courts. But by that time, U.S. marshal David Lenox had already been sent to serve the writs summoning delinquent distillers to Philadelphia. Attorney General William Bradford later maintained that the writs were meant to compel compliance with the law, and that the government did not actually intend to hold trials in Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|Youngstown's {{industrial}} development {{changed the face}} of the Mahoning Valley. The community's burgeoning coal industry drew hundreds of immigrants from Wales, Germany, and Ireland. With the establishment of steel mills in the late 19th century, Youngstown became a popular destination for immigrants from Eastern Europe, Italy, and Greece. In the early 20th century, the community saw an influx of immigrants from non-European countries including what is modern day Lebanon, Palestine/Israel, and Syria. By the 1920s, this dramatic demographic shift produced a nativist backlash, and the Mahoning Valley became a center of Ku Klux Klan activity. The situation reached <b>a</b> <b>climax</b> in 1924, when street clashes between Klan members and Italian and Irish Americans in neighboring Niles led Ohio Governor A. Victor Donahey to declare martial law. By 1928 the Klan was in steep decline; and three years later, the organization sold its Canfield, Ohio, meeting area, Kountry Klub Field.|$|E

5|$|Aerial {{operations}} {{in what would}} become the Battle of Britain began for his unit on 12 July 1940. The fighting reached <b>a</b> <b>climax</b> on 7 August when Eagle Day was launched (code name Adlertag). Hitler had issued Führer Directive no. 17 (Weisung Nr. 17) on 1 August 1940; the strategic objective was to engage and defeat the Royal Air Force (RAF) to achieve air supremacy, or at least air superiority, in preparation for Operation Sea Lion (Unternehmen Seelöwe), the proposed amphibious invasion of Great Britain. From 7 September onwards, the Luftwaffe switched to attack British towns and cities, with London coming under particularly heavy attack, during what was dubbed The Blitz by the British. In total, Philipp flew 130 missions over England. His number of aerial victories increased, including his 12th to 15th on 27 September, which led to the presentation of the Honor Goblet of the Luftwaffe on 28 September 1940. He claimed his 20th victory on 20 October, and was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. He was the second pilot of JG54 to receive this award. The first was his Gruppenkommandeur (group commander) Hauptmann Dietrich Hrabak, who received the award one day earlier.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in {{the summer}} of 54 BC, a wave of {{political}} corruption and violence swept Rome. This chaos reached <b>a</b> <b>climax</b> in January 52 BC, when Clodius was murdered in a gang war. In addition, the civil unrest had caused the calendar to become neglected. The calendar required annual adjustments to prevent its drift relative to any Spring Equinox, and so to correct the misalignment of the calendar, an intercalary month was inserted at the end of February 52 BC, and Pompey was elected sole Consul for that month. This elevation to extraordinary power was the last straw for Caesar, and with Crassus dead, Pompey was looking for any excuse with which to crush Caesar, and establish himself as the master of the state. On January 1, 49 BC, an agent of Caesar named Gaius Scribonius Curio presented an ultimatum to the senate, but the ultimatum was rejected, and the senate then passed a resolution which declared that if Caesar did not lay down his arms by July of that year, that he would be acting adversus rem publicam (in effect, declaring him to be an enemy of the republic). On January 7, 49 BC, the senate passed a senatus consultum ultimum, which suspended civil government and declared something analogous to martial law. Pompey, in effect, was vested with Dictatorial powers, but his army was composed largely of untested conscripts. Caesar then crossed the Rubicon river with his veteran army, and marched towards Rome. Caesar's rapid advance forced Pompey, the Consuls and the senate to abandon Rome for Greece, and Caesar entered the city unopposed.|$|E
5|$|Both leagues {{employ the}} same two-series playoff format, {{with the top}} three teams from each league {{participating}} in their own two-stage playoff. If two teams vying for a third Climax Series spot finish the regular season with identical records, the team that finished the previous season with a better record is allowed {{to advance to the}} playoffs, unless if both teams finished with the same previous season record. The First Stage is a best-of-three series involving the regular season's second- and third-place finishers, with all games played at the second-place team's home field. The winner of this series goes on to face the league's pennant-winner in the Final Stage. This series is best-of-six. The league champion is awarded a one-win advantage as well as home field advantage for the entire series, unlike most professional leagues where a 5-game playoff series runs 2-2-1 or 2-3 or a 7-game playoff series that runs 2-3-2 with the higher seed receiving the extra game. The winning teams advance to the Japan Series, where they compete against one another. Unlike MLB, NPB games may end in a tie if there is no winner after 12innings of play. If <b>a</b> <b>Climax</b> Series game results in a tie, the win is credited to neither team. If this causes the series to end in a tie, the team who finished higher in the regular-season standings advances, unless if both teams finished with the same regular-season record. If both teams finished with the same regular season record, the team who won the most matches against the other team will advance.|$|E
