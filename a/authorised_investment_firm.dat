50|$|Because <b>investment</b> <b>firms</b> {{offering}} nominee {{services are}} the legal {{owners of the}} shares, there remains a risk of improper behavior causing the shares to be lost. For example, the <b>investment</b> <b>firm</b> may use the shares it holds for short selling transactions and be unable to replace the shares if the <b>investment</b> <b>firm</b> becomes insolvent. The UK Financial Services Compensation Scheme http://www.fscs.org.uk/what-we-cover/eligibility-rules/when-is-fscs-cover-triggered/ compensates investors on the failure of an <b>investment</b> <b>firm.</b> However the limit in June 2015 stood at only £50,000 per person per <b>investment</b> <b>firm</b> http://www.fscs.org.uk/what-we-cover/eligibility-rules/compensation-limits/investment-limits and losses above this amount would not be covered. This risk of the shares being lost through malfeasance does not apply when the shares are held by the investor in certificated form.|$|R

40|$|The {{experience}} of the recent financial crisis leads to reflections on the relevant mechanisms of risk reduction of an <b>investment</b> <b>firms</b> activity. Within the European Union, the Directive 2010 / 76 /EU (CRD III) has introduced new rules regarding the remuneration policy for <b>investment</b> <b>firms.</b> The main goal was {{to reduce the risk}} of investment firms' activity. This is a prudential regulation. The purpose of this article is to evaluate, from the point of view of an <b>investment</b> <b>firm,</b> proposed by the EU legislator approach to remuneration policy aimed at reducing the risk of the operation of this type of financial institutions. The aim was to identify the key problems with which Polish <b>investment</b> <b>firms</b> may face in the future in connection with new remuneration policy rules. As far as the methodology is concerned, the author carried out in-depth and standardized interviews with the representatives of several <b>investment</b> <b>firms</b> in Poland. In addition, the method of observation has been applied. The results of the research demonstrates that the abovementioned regulations will have limited impact on reducing the risk of the activities of these financial institutions as well as their implementation will be difficult for them in practice...|$|R

40|$|This paper compares and reconciles two {{new methods}} for {{cross-country}} {{comparisons of the}} cost efficiency of UK and Italian <b>investment</b> <b>firms</b> over the period 1995 ¿ 1998. It employs four different specifications of the stochastic frontier methodology, using a translog cost function {{in order to measure}} X-efficiency. The traditional common frontier reveals that Italian <b>investment</b> <b>firms</b> are nearly as efficient as UK firms. To overcome traditional limitations, two methods are used in this paper. They provide consistent results. The first method shows differences between the efficiency of the two countries by incorporating environmental variables into the cross-country common frontier. The second method shows differences in the efficiency of the domestic versus foreign <b>investment</b> <b>firms</b> in the two countries, by testing the ability to monitor and control on a cross-border basis. Finally, to identify <b>investment</b> <b>firms</b> that are both cost and profit efficient, we undertake a profitability test...|$|R
