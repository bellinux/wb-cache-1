These regulated ventilation and made asbestosis an excusable work-related disease. The term mesothelioma was first used in medical literature in 1931; its association with asbestos was first noted sometime in the 1940s. Similar legislation followed in the U.S. about ten years later.|$|E
25|$|T had conceded {{before the}} trial that Mrs Hancock's and Mr Margereson's {{illnesses}} were caused by asbestos from the factory, but any compensation depended on proving that the company knew or should have known the dangers the dust could cause. Three months after the hearing ended Mr. Justice Holland handed down a written judgment, finding for the plaintiffs, and awarded damages of £65,000 to June Hancock and £50,000 to Evelyn Margereson. The judge ruled that the defendant was liable {{on the grounds that}} the risks of <b>asbestos</b> <b>dust</b> exposure had been known by the defendant since 1933 and it was foreseeable that children allowed to play in the vicinity of the factory would be exposed to the risk of pulmonary disease. This was a landmark decision, extending as it did the duty of care beyond factory employees to those outside a factory's walls.|$|E

25|$|The {{death of}} English textile worker Nellie Kershaw in 1924 from {{pulmonary}} asbestosis {{was the first}} case to be described in medical literature, and the first published account of disease attributed to occupational asbestos exposure. However, her former employers (Turner Brothers Asbestos) denied that asbestosis even existed because the medical condition was not officially recognised at the time. As a result, they accepted no liability for her injuries and paid no compensation, either to Kershaw during her final illness or to her bereaved family after she had died. Even so, {{the findings of the}} inquest into her death were highly influential insofar as they led to a parliamentary enquiry by the British Government. The enquiry formally acknowledged the existence of asbestosis, recognised that it was hazardous to health and concluded that it was irrefutably linked to the prolonged inhalation of <b>asbestos</b> <b>dust.</b> Having established the existence of asbestosis on a medical and judicial basis, the report resulted in the first Asbestos Industry Regulations being published in 1931, which came into effect on 1 March 1932.|$|E
25|$|Between May 13–14, 2004 {{the site}} was {{enclosed}} with temporary mesh fencing and plain-clothed security guards commenced patrols of the public areas. At 02:00 on May 15 bulldozers arrived at the site and tree-felling began at 07:00. The work caused immediate concern to nearby residents who feared the work might unsettle asbestos deposits in the ground. Residents formed the Save Spodden Valley action group the following week. Residents also protested to Rochdale Council, which subsequently issued an emergency tree preservation order on six parts of the site, preventing the removal of trees without permission of planning officers, and carrying a fine of up to £20,000 per tree. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) also secured a voluntary arrangement to halt any work that could disturb soil on the site pending soil sampling. Former Turner's employees and local residents claimed that, {{as recently as the}} 1960s, <b>asbestos</b> <b>dust</b> and fibres were clearly visible hanging from the trees, and that a disused coalmine shaft exposed by the tree felling had been used over a period of decades to dump hundreds of tonnes of asbestos waste.|$|E
2500|$|In 1937, Turner's {{director}} Robert H. Turner wrote: [...] "All {{asbestos fibre}} dust {{is a danger}} to lungs. If we can produce evidence from this country that the industry is not responsible for any asbestosis claims, {{we may be able}} to avoid tiresome regulations and the introduction of dangerous occupational talk." [...] Despite an awareness of the potentially lethal effects of asbestos, the factory site remained heavily contaminated: measurements taken in 1950 and again in 1957 showed levels of <b>asbestos</b> <b>dust</b> in the air outside the factory roof were between 18 and 60 particles per cubic centimetre - far above the company's own safe working level of 2 to 3 particles, while a measurement taken near houses outside the factory premises was 47 particles. In August 1957, Turner's revealed that they were dumping 15,000lb (6.8 tonnes) of <b>asbestos</b> <b>dust</b> recovered from ventilation filters alone each week. The same document reported that the levels of <b>asbestos</b> <b>dust</b> on the factory's roof exceeded those in the actual production areas inside the factory. In the 1950s people living near the factory joked that the area had frost all year round and the local woods were nicknamed [...] "the snow trees" [...] due to the permanent dusting with asbestos particles.|$|E

Chrysotiles developed the largest amounts of lipid peroxides, followed by anthophyllite, amosite, and crocidolite in decreasing order. Compared with the control samples erythrocytes free of dusts, all types of the asbestos examined disclosed significant differences. The results obtained provide support for the cytotoxic potential of amosite and crocidolite and, on the other hand, suggest that a lipid peroxidation of unsaturated fatty acids {{may be involved in}} the mechanisms(s) of membrane-damaging effects of <b>asbestos</b> <b>dusts...</b>|$|R
25|$|Early {{brake pads}} (and linings) {{contained}} <b>asbestos,</b> producing <b>dust</b> which {{should not be}} inhaled. Although newer pads can be made of ceramics, Kevlar, and other plastics, inhalation of brake dust should still be avoided regardless of material.|$|R
40|$|Epidemiologic {{evidence}} has recently identified {{an association between}} an endemic outbreak of pleural and peritoneal mesothelioma in the Urgup region of Turkey and exposure to zeolite fibres. This malignancy is usually associated with exposure to <b>asbestos</b> <b>dusts</b> whose mineralogical characteristics {{differ from those of}} zeolites. The present study further defines the in vitro biologic activity of erionite, a common zeolite fibre found in the Urgup region of Turkey. Both erionite and crocidolite asbestos fibres were clastogenic in synchronous Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) fibroblasts. Both fibres also altered CHO ploidy. Erionite, unlike crocidolite or Min-U-Sil quartz, caused a slight increase in sister chromatid exchanges in synchronous CHO cells. Neither erionite nor crocidolite was mutagenic in a human lymphoblastoid cell line. Erionite fibres thus produced in vitro cytogenic changes similar to those caused by asbestiform mineral <b>dusts</b> and, like <b>asbestos</b> fibres, did not induce mutations in human lymphoblastoid cells...|$|R
2500|$|The Armley {{asbestos}} {{disaster is}} an ongoing health issue originating in Armley, a suburb of Leeds, West Yorkshire, England.

2500|$|T {{applied for}} {{leave to appeal}} in December 1995, and {{submissions}} were heard in March 1996 by Lord Justices Russell, Saville and Otton. William Woodward QC, for T, submitted that it could never be known when and where a person developed mesothelioma and {{it could not be}} determined which particular dust particle produced mesothelioma. On these grounds, T should not be held responsible for cancer which could have arisen from <b>asbestos</b> <b>dust</b> produced by another company. Lord Justice Russell responded that the line that had to be drawn was where, outside the factory walls, the risk of personal injury became less than a real possibility and said [...] "It is not a very attractive argument for the factory owner to agree that mountains of <b>asbestos</b> <b>dust</b> were created but these cases of cancer were not the result of that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Deane further {{wrote that}} [...] "the evil effects of <b>asbestos</b> <b>dust</b> have also instigated a {{microscopic}} {{examination of the}} mineral dust by HM Medical Inspector.

40|$|Previous animal {{experiments}} with <b>asbestos</b> <b>dusts</b> {{have been almost}} entirely confined to chrysotile asbestos. It was, therefore, decided to investigate the effects of mill dusts from {{the three types of}} asbestos that are produced commercially in South Africa, namely chrysotile, amosite, and crocidolite. Chrysotile and amosite samples were relatively pure while in contrast the crocidolite dust was found to consist mainly of ironstone and silica and contained less than 10 % of asbestos fibre. Guinea-pigs, Vervet monkeys, and rabbits were exposed to these dusts. The results were assessed on histological criteria. It was found that, in all three species of animals, the amosite dust produced more marked lesions than the chrysotile and that these lesions occurred at an earlier period. It was not possible to compare these lesions with those caused by the crocidolite dust, owing to its impure nature. It was noted, however, that this dust caused severe lesions in guinea-pigs and monkeys and that the animals in this group succumbed more readily to respiratory infections...|$|R
40|$|Long term {{inhalation}} studies and intraperitoneal injection studies in rats were undertaken {{with a series}} of chrysotile <b>asbestos</b> <b>dusts.</b> Three dust samples were generated from chrysotile modified by the wet dispersion process (WDC) and one was from unmodified chrysotile. Following a 1 year inhalation period, all the chrysotile samples proved extremely fibrogenic and carcinogenic and {{there were no significant differences}} between the WDC dusts and normal chrysotile. In all experimental groups approximately 25 % of animals developed pulmonary carcinomas and in the oldest rats advanced interstitial fibrosis occupied on average 10 % of all lung tissue. In the injection studies all the dust samples produced mesotheliomas in over 90 % of animals. Very little chrysotile remained in the lungs of the animals that survived longest following dust inhalation and what there was was present as individual chrysotile fibrils. It is suggested that chrysotile is potentially the most harmful variety of asbestos as shown in these and other animal studies but that it is removed from lung tissue quite rapidly. In the long lived human species this may mean that except where exposure levels are very high and of long duration, chrysotile should be less hazardous than other asbestos types...|$|R
40|$|Some {{details of}} the physics of xeroradiography, and the bearing these have on films of the lung {{obtained}} by this technique, are discussed. In experiments designed to obtain useful films {{with a minimum of}} radiation exposure it was found that an exposure range of 10 - 30 mas at 200 kV at 1. 35 m (4 1 / 2 ft) without a grid or air gap gave very satisfactory results. The positive model of development was considered to give more information than the negative mode. One hundred and fourteen miners who had been exposed to silica <b>dust,</b> <b>asbestos</b> <b>dusts</b> or both, were examined by this technique. The xeroradiographs were compared with silver halide films taken at 200 kV. The xeroradiographs were considered to be superior in several respects, especially in the delineation of vascular shadows, normal and abnormal linear opacities. Linear opacities in asbestos-exposed subjects were better shown on the xeroradiographs and were occasionally seen on these films when the 200 kV conventional film was entirely normal. Small rounded opacities of silicosis were very poorly shown on the xeroradiographs. Pleural thickening and pleural plaques may be very well demonstrated...|$|R
2500|$|A {{campaign}} group, Save Spodden Valley, {{was formed}} to oppose the development, claiming disturbance of the site in a contaminated state posed too great a risk to public health. Greater Manchester Association of Trade Unions Councils said: [...] "The planners must do their public duty and deem the site permanently unsafe for urban development and formulate a plan to seal all possible sources of <b>asbestos</b> <b>dust</b> as an urgent priority." ...|$|E
2500|$|Leeds City Council {{commissioned}} a report into {{the deaths from}} the Department of Public Health at the University of Leeds. The council also began a survey {{of some of the}} houses in the neighbourhood, looking for residual contamination. <b>Asbestos</b> <b>dust</b> was found to be present in the roofing, cellars and window sashes. As a result, a warning letter was sent to all residents informing them of the possibility of asbestos contamination in their homes and the need for specialised decontamination. When asked, the Minister for Housing and Planning, Sir George Young, responded that the government would not provide financial assistance to the home owners or the council to pay for decontamination, as this [...] "would not be a justifiable use of public funds." [...] In further tests between 1998 - 2001 the council surveyed 364 houses adjacent to Midland Works. Residual asbestos contamination was found in 363 of the properties tested. As of November 2008, a further 610 properties had been tested and found to contain residual <b>asbestos</b> <b>dust,</b> and decontaminated at a cost of £9.3 million.|$|E
2500|$|Midland Works emitted vast {{quantities}} of <b>asbestos</b> <b>dust,</b> primarily through its ventilation system, which covered the nearby streets and rooftops of surrounding houses.

40|$|The {{present report}} {{addresses}} the issues whether house dust {{is likely to}} contribute substantially to the exposure of humans, in particular for the contaminants lead and <b>asbestos.</b> House <b>dust</b> consists for 30 - 70 % of soil material, indicating that contaminated soil can lead to contaminated house dust. It is concluded that exposure to lead via house dust {{should be included in}} risk assessment of soil contamination. The studies in which the amount of soil ingested by children are estimated use tracers in soil that are obviously both present in soil outdoors and in soil in house dust. Therefore, using this amount of soil ingested by children to cover both exposure of lead via soil outdoors and soil in house dust is reasonable. However, a correction factor of 2 is recommended to account for enrichment of lead in house dust in comparison with outdoor soil. This factor also accounts for other lead sources in house dust than contamination via soil. Significant contribution of <b>asbestos</b> to house <b>dust</b> from <b>asbestos</b> contaminated soil may occur at soil concentrations greater than 100 mg/kg. It is recommended to determine asbestos levels in house dust in houses adjacent to sites that are contaminated with asbestos above 1000 mg/kg for nonfriable asbestos, and above 100 mg/kg for friable asbestos. These recommendations are in agreement with a draft assessment protocol on site specific assessment of human risks to soil contamination with asbestos. A few comments on the protocol are made. For further recommendations for risk assessment of <b>asbestos</b> in house <b>dust,</b> we refer to this protocol...|$|R

40|$|Cancer {{mortality}} rates are climbing in India {{and it is}} under-reported due to poor recording of the cause of death. An effective population-based screening program can give reliable data on over-all malignancy profile. An 8 -year (2003 - 2010) multi-centre based study was assessed to understand the malignancy profile in the population of West Bengal. The cancer frequency was moderate during 2003 to 2006, after that it rises drastically and reached maximum peak in 2010. The most frequently affected organs were breast, cervix, stomach, lung, oesophagus, ovary, cheek, prostrate, liver and pancreas, gall bladder and tongue. The incidence in rural areas was slightly low compared to more polluted urban counterparts. Malignancies are in epidemic peak in this population with new cancer cases and greater increase among females. The largest threat among females was seen for breast and cervix cancer, among males for prostate cancer. Among children of age group below 10 years non hodgkins lymphoma was alarmingly high, followed by acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myelocytic leukemia. Exposure to various environmental toxicants, industrial wastages, <b>asbestos</b> <b>dusts,</b> colored agricultural commodities and food products incredibly elevate the levels of malignant risk and status. Multiple neoplastic syndromes were common for cancers of liver-lung-brain, breast-ovary, prostrate-lung-bone and others in this population and more specifically in multiple endocrine neoplasias. This devastating cancer scenario can be prevented by public education on tobacco and its health hazards, recommended dietary guidelines, safe sexual practices and lifestyle modifications...|$|R

2500|$|Asbestos mining existed {{more than}} 4,000 years ago, but {{large-scale}} mining {{began at the}} end of the 19th century, when manufacturers and builders began using asbestos for its desirable physical properties. Some of those properties are sound absorption, average tensile strength, affordability, and resistance to fire, heat, and electricity. It was used in such applications as electrical insulation for hotplate wiring and in building insulation. When asbestos is used for its resistance to fire or heat, the fibers are often mixed with cement or woven into fabric or mats. These desirable properties made asbestos very widely used. Asbestos use continued to grow through most of the 20th century [...] until public knowledge (acting through courts and legislatures) of the health hazards of <b>asbestos</b> <b>dust</b> outlawed asbestos in mainstream construction and fireproofing in most countries.|$|E

40|$|The study {{includes}} some 50 groups of {{male or female}} Wistar rats tested in three series. Except for one untreated group and 3 vehicle control groups, the animals were injected intraperitoneally (i. p.) once or repeatedly with dust suspensions and then examined, after lifetime observation up to 30 months, for tumours in the abdominal cavity. 1 granular dust (silicon carbide), 2 <b>asbestos</b> <b>dusts</b> (crocidolite, tremolite) and 11 vitreous fibre dust samples were administered. 5 of the vitreous fibre types were fine fibre fractions from 4 commercial insulation wools and 1 experimental wool, the others were prepared by milling glass microfibres, which have, per se, a small diameter range. The dosage per rat differed {{over a wide range}} in accordance with experience from earlier studies. The lowest dose was 0. 04 x 10 (9) crocidolite fibres in 0. 5 mg dust, and the highest amounted to 20 x 10 (9) glass fibres in 1000 mg divided into 40 weekly injections. Two mesotheliomas were found in a total of 395 rats treated with saline or granular silicon carbide (250 or 1000 mg). Eleven fibre dusts produced dose-dependent mesotheliomas at rates of up to 97 %, but the calculated fibre number > 5 micrometers in length required for inducing a 25 % tumour risk differed between the fibre samples tested in the relation of 1 to about 1000. UICC-like crocidolite heads the ranking order; the glass fibre B- 01, which possesses a low durability in the body, ends it together with a rather thin sample of glass fibre type B- 09. The stone fibre MMVF- 21 takes a high place in the ranking order, similar to the tremolite sample. The results correspond to those of earlier i. p. tests...|$|R
