5|$|Knights of the Old Republic II was {{developed}} by Obsidian Entertainment and published by LucasArts. It is the sequel to BioWare's Knights of the Old Republic, and it uses the same Odyssey Engine as the original game. BioWare suggested that Obsidian should be offered the Knights of the Old Republic license due to their familiarity with Obsidian's past work <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> {{relationship between the two}} developers, as well as due to finding LucasArts' development schedule for the sequel to be too tight. The game was released in PC and Xbox versions, but due to the Xbox version being released two months prior to the PC version, it has multiple unfixed bugs.|$|E
5|$|Realizing {{that they}} need one big show to raise the {{necessary}} money, the brothers persuade their old agent to book the Palace Hotel Ballroom, north of Chicago. They mount a loudspeaker atop the Bluesmobile and drive the Chicago area promoting the concert—and alerting the police, the Nazis, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Good</b> Ol' Boys of their whereabouts. The ballroom is packed with blues fans, police officers, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Good</b> Ol' Boys. Jake and Elwood perform two songs, then sneak offstage, as the tax deadline is rapidly approaching. A record company executive offers them a $10,000 cash advance on a recording contract—more than enough {{to pay off the}} orphanage's taxes and Ray's IOU—and then shows the brothers how to slip out of the building unnoticed. As they make their escape via a service tunnel, they are confronted by the mystery woman: Jake's vengeful ex-fiancée. After her volley of M16 rifle bullets leaves them miraculously unharmed, Jake offers a series of ridiculous excuses that she accepts, allowing the brothers to escape to the Bluesmobile.|$|E
5000|$|Frame {{semantics}} is {{a theory}} of linguistic meaning developed by Charles J. Fillmore that extends his earlier case grammar. It relates linguistic semantics to encyclopedic knowledge.The basic idea is that one cannot {{understand the meaning of}} a single word without access to all the essential knowledge that relates to that word. For example, one {{would not be able to}} understand the word [...] "sell" [...] without knowing anything about the situation of commercial transfer, which also involves, among other things, a seller, a buyer, <b>goods,</b> money, <b>the</b> relation between <b>the</b> money <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods,</b> <b>the</b> relations between <b>the</b> seller <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> money, the relation between <b>the</b> buyer <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> money <b>and</b> so on.|$|R

5|$|The RIRA's {{objective}} is a united Ireland by forcing {{the end of}} British sovereignty over Northern Ireland {{through the use of}} physical force. The organisation rejects the Mitchell Principles <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Good</b> Friday Agreement, comparing the latter to the 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty which resulted in the partition of Ireland. The organisation aims to uphold an uncompromising form of Irish republicanism and opposes any political settlement that falls short of Irish unity and independence.|$|E
5|$|The state passed {{legislation}} in 1941 that authorized {{the creation of}} limited-access roadways; the MSHD could prohibit access to a state trunkline from the adjacent properties. Around the same time, single-digit highways like M-9 were renumbered to set aside those numbers for future freeways in the state. During World War II, the Willow Run Expressway, the Detroit Industrial Expressway and the Davison Freeway were built, ushering in {{the beginnings of the}} state's freeway system. These highway improvements were financed by the Defense Highway Act of 1941 to aid in national defense. After the war, the MSHD <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Good</b> Roads Federation studied the highway needs of the state. Their study reported that road maintenance and improvement deteriorated since the Great Depression. It also stated that funding needed to be increased to deal with pressures from traffic increases after the war.|$|E
5|$|The {{strength}} {{and range of}} the electric force <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> conductivity of plasmas usually ensure that the densities {{of positive and negative}} charges in any sizeable region are equal ("quasineutrality"). A plasma with a significant excess of charge density, or, in the extreme case, is composed of a single species, is called a non-neutral plasma. In such a plasma, electric fields play a dominant role. Examples are charged particle beams, an electron cloud in a Penning trap and positron plasmas.|$|E

In contrast to previous studies, we derive sufficient conditions for wage interdependence in the economy where <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> market is in imperfect competition <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> market <b>and</b> <b>the</b> labor market are related through changes of the price level...|$|R

5|$|According to {{the epic}} poem Mahabharata, Krishna becomes Arjuna's charioteer for the Kurukshetra War, {{but on the}} {{condition}} that he personally will not raise any weapon. Upon arrival at the battlefield, and seeing that the enemies are his family, his grandfather, and his cousins and loved ones, Arjuna is moved and says his heart will not allow him to fight and kill others. He would rather renounce the kingdom and put down his Gandiv (Arjuna's bow). Krishna then advises him about the nature of life, ethics, and morality when one is faced with a war between good and evil, the impermanence of matter, the permanence of the soul <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>good,</b> duties and responsibilities, the nature of true peace and bliss and the different types of yoga to reach this state of bliss and inner liberation. This conversation between Krishna and Arjuna is presented as a discourse called the Bhagavad Gita.|$|E

5|$|Dragonlance {{is set on}} {{the world}} of Krynn. The {{majority}} of the novels {{take place in the}} various regions of Ansalon, a small continent, though some have taken place on the continent of Taladas, located northeast of Ansalon. The world's major gods are the High God and his children: good Paladine, neutral Gilean, and evil Takhisis. The gods are opposed by Chaos, who seeks to destroy Krynn. Depending on the time period, the evil chromatic <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> metallic dragons are rare or plentiful. Humans are Krynn's most common humanoid race, but elves, dwarves, kender, gnomes, and minotaurs occupy the world as well. Clerics derive magical powers from their gods, and wizards derive their power from the three moon gods, Solinari, Lunitari, and Nuitari. Hickman had previously served as a Mormon missionary in Java for two years, and uses Indonesian in Dragonlance spells. During Krynn's various wars, armies of draconians are used as troops. Draconians are created by corrupting a dragon egg, thereby creating a reptilian humanoid. The eggs of good dragons create evil draconians, and vice versa.|$|E
5|$|Major General Charles Richard Fox {{proposed}} {{during the}} exhibition that a bronze cast {{should be made}} of the statue to serve as a memorial to the exhibition, marking one end of the site of the Crystal Palace with a statue of Prince Albert at the other end. A campaign got underway two years later, in May 1853, with a variety of the great <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> signing a brochure promoting a scheme to erect the statue somewhere in London. Its supporters included the Duke of Sutherland, Lord Lansdowne, the Earl of Shaftesbury, the sculptor John Henry Foley, the novelist William Makepeace Thackeray, the ceramic manufacturer William Taylor Copeland and the Conservative MP (and future Prime Minister) Benjamin Disraeli. The Times was strongly in favour of the project due to the influence of its foreign affairs reporter Henry Reeve, who had known Marochetti since as early as 1839. The Royal Family also {{let it be known that}} they were supporters, with Queen Victoria donating £200 and Prince Albert £100.|$|E
5|$|The Ninety-five Theses or Disputation on the Power of Indulgences are {{a list of}} propositions for an {{academic}} disputation written in 1517 by Martin Luther, professor of moral theology at the University of Wittenberg, Germany, that started the Reformation, a schism in the Catholic Church which profoundly changed Europe. They advance Luther's positions against {{what he saw as}} abusive in the practice of clergy selling plenary indulgences, which were certificates believed to reduce the temporal punishment for sins committed by the purchasers or their loved ones in purgatory. In the Theses, Luther claimed that the repentance required by Christ in order for sins to be forgiven involves inner spiritual repentance rather than merely external sacramental confession. He argued that indulgences led Christians to avoid true repentance and sorrow for sin, believing that they could forgo it by purchasing an indulgence. They also, according to Luther, discouraged Christians from giving to the poor and performing other acts of mercy, believing that indulgence certificates were more spiritually valuable. Though Luther claimed that his positions on indulgences accorded with those of the Pope, the Theses challenge a fourteenth-century papal bull stating that the pope could use the treasury of merit <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> deeds of past saints to forgive temporal punishment for sins. The Theses are framed as propositions to be argued in debate rather than necessarily representing Luther's opinions, but Luther later clarified his views in the Explanations of the Disputation Concerning the Value of Indulgences.|$|E
