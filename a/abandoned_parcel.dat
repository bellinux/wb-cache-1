5000|$|There {{are many}} efforts to expand park {{accessibility}} in LA. Many former junkyards or abandoned lands are being converted into parks in LA. For example, Estrella Park in South Los Angeles, formerly an auto-repair junkyard, {{was created by}} the California Community Foundation and local schoolchildren in 1982. In 2004, when the Park had become degraded after years of poor maintenance, the Neighborhood Land Trust began repairing the Park so that it could reopen in 2006. In Koreatown, Francis Community Park had been long regarded as a dumpsite until efforts by First Unitarian Church of Los Angeles and Urban Ministries helped re-purpose it in 1996. It has since become the Moothart Collington Community Garden and been managed by the Neighborhood Land Trust and funded by Proposition K. Additionally, Markson Street Pocket Park in Panorama City had been an <b>abandoned</b> <b>parcel</b> of neglected land until its opening in 2006, with the aid of the Neighborhood Land Trust. Since then, many recreational and cultural programs, such as dancing and nutrition classes, have been held there. In South Los Angeles, Erika J. Glazer Community Garden for years had been a polluted parcel until community efforts restored it in 2008. Despite threats of sale in a public auction, the Garden was acquired for permanent protection by the Land Trust in 2012. The year later, the Land Trust also acquired a [...]62-acre parcel of land in West Athens and subsequently implemented gardens, a small trail, fruit trees, and meeting space. It is now called the West Athens Victory Garden.|$|E

40|$|This project aims {{to analyze}} the {{feasibility}} of converting an abandoned brownfield in the Spartan- Keyes neighborhood, {{which happens to be}} a former railroad right-of-way, into an open space such as a linear park, plaza, or community garden. In order to create a vibrant development that provides safety and economic growth, the open space can include some local commercial uses such as coffee shops or can be open to food trucks or mobile vendors. A new linear park in the Spartan Keyes neighborhood can not only meet the community’s need for open space, but also can provide many social and ecological benefits for the neighborhood. There are different reasons preventing the former railroad site from being developed as a park or open space, such as cleanup and purchasing costs, shape of the parcel, safety constraints, and soil contamination. This study will attempt to provide a better knowledge of the reasons preventing this particular parcel from being redeveloped as well as recommendations to address those constraints. This document can be used to convince the City of San José and the County of Santa Clara to provide funding for the redevelopment of this <b>abandoned</b> railroad <b>parcel.</b> The end results of this study will provide the Spartan Keyes neighborhood leaders with evidence to support their desire of redeveloping the <b>abandoned</b> railroad <b>parcel</b> into a linear park...|$|R

40|$|The {{creation}} of public {{space in the}} modern American city has been a persistent problem. This thesis is {{a revival of the}} problem of defining and creating public space. My choice of site is an <b>abandoned</b> urban <b>parcel</b> of land which housed the State of Ohio's Penitentiary for 150 years. The characteristics of the site which are of particular interest are its intrinsic definition of public realm, its existing order, and its proximity to the rapidly growing city of Columbus, Ohio. The use of this site, in combination with these features, will provide a novel approach for the making of public space...|$|R

40|$|The Alps {{provide a}} high habitat {{diversity}} for plant species, structured by broad- and fine-scale abiotic site conditions. In man-made grasslands, vegetation composition is additionally {{affected by the}} type of landuse. We recorded vegetation composition in 216 parcels of grassland in 12 municipalities representing an area of 170 × 70 km in the south-eastern part of the Swiss Alps. Each parcel was characterized by a combination of altitudinal level (valley, intermediate, alp), traditional landuse (mown, grazed), current management (mown, grazed, abandoned), and fertilization (unfertilized, fertilized). For each parcel we also assessed the abiotic factors aspect, slope, pH value, and geographic coordinates, and for each municipality annual precipitation and its cultural tradition. We analysed vegetation composition using (i) variation partitioning in RDA, (ii) cover of graminoids, non-legume forbs, and legumes, and (iii) dominance and frequency of species. Species composition was determined by, in decreasing order of variation explained, landuse, broad-scale abiotic factors, fine-scale abiotic factors, and cultural tradition. Current socio-economically motivated landuse changes, such as grazing of unfertilized former meadows or their abandonment, strongly affect vegetation composition. In our study, the frequency of characteristic meadow species was significantly smaller in grazed and even smaller in <b>abandoned</b> <b>parcels</b> than in still mown ones, suggesting less severe consequences of grazing for vegetation composition than of abandonment. Therefore, low-intensity grazing and mowing every few years should be considered valuable conservation alternatives to abandonment. Furthermore, because each landuse type was characterized by different species, a high variety of landuse types should be promoted to preserve plant species diversity in Alpine grasslands...|$|R
40|$|Traditional grasslands {{are often}} of high {{conservation}} value, but depend on non-intensive management like mowing for their preservation. During the 20 th century, traditional agricultural usage was either heavily intensified or abandoned due to socio-economic reasons. In Eastern Europe, land abandonment mainly {{took place in}} regions with qualitatively bad soils. This large scale land use change lead to secondary succession. In fens and fen meadows, this {{may lead to a}} decrease in species richness and a replacement of specialist species by more generalist ones. The main objective of the present study is to examine if and how mowing cessation interacts with hydrology in determining species and trait distribution in a fen meadow. In the Upper Course of the Biebrza National Park, Poland, we selected 15 sites along four transects, with plots in mown and <b>abandoned</b> <b>parcels.</b> In these plots we measured plant abundance, aboveground biomass and relative light intensity, while plant traits were selected from different trait databases. The relationship between these plot characteristics and the different traits was assessed using concordance analysis. Mowing cessation resulted in reduced moss cover and light availability, while vegetation height increased and higher litter deposition and tussock development were observed. This altered environment not only resulted in decreased species richness and evenness in abandoned plots but also caused shifts in plant trait distribution. Most of the significantly linked traits responded more strongly to mowing cessation than to the hydrologic gradient. Traits related to light competition, such as light requirements, plant height and shoot growth form, especially responded to mowing cessation. This stresses the importance of light competition as a major factor determining species and trait distribution in fen systems. ...|$|R
40|$|The nine-county San Francisco Bay Area, {{according}} to the California Department of Finance, will add nearly 1. 5 million new residents between now and 2020. Depending on the density of new development, the region will need between 90, 000 and 150, 000 acres of developable land to accommodate this level of growth. If current trends continue, most new development will occur on previously undeveloped greenfield sites at the urban fringe. This will put substantial pressure on the region's natural environment and open space lands [...] particularly in Alameda, Contra Costa, and Santa Clara counties. One way to preserve open space and sensitive environmental lands is to accommodate more growth as infill. The term "infill," which has traditionally meant the development of vacant, cleared, or <b>abandoned</b> <b>parcels,</b> has more recently been expanded to include land reuse and recycling [...] that is, the redevelopment of developed parcels that are physically or economically underutilized. This report considers the potential for and economic viability of infill and refill development throughout the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area. Its purpose is three-fold: (1) to ascertain the physical and economic infill capacity of the Bay Area, using a realistic range of densities and economic conditions; (2) to identify the locations and pattern of infill opportunities within the Bay Area, keeping in mind the economic, physical, governmental and social structure of the Bay Area; and (3) to establish and test a procedure for identifying and analyzing infill development which can be reliably used elsewhere {{in the state and}} country. The results of this analysis lead to several conclusions regarding the potential for increased residential infill activity in the San Francisco Bay Area...|$|R

5|$|The Transylvanian peasants {{had already}} been outraged because of the {{increase}} of existing seigneurial duties and taxes {{and the introduction of}} new taxes during {{the first decades of the}} century. The bishop also tried to collect the tithe from the petty noblemen and from Orthodox Vlachs who had settled in <b>parcels</b> <b>abandoned</b> by Catholic peasants. In the spring of 1437, Hungarian and Vlach commoners, poor townspeople from Kolozsvár (now Cluj-Napoca in Romania) and petty noblemen started to assemble on the flat summit of Mount Bábolna near Alparét (Bobâlna) where they set up a fortified camp. The bishop and his brother, Roland Lépes, the deputy of the voivode (or royal governor) of Transylvania, gathered their troops to fight against the rebels. The voivode, the two counts of the Székelys and many Transylvanian noblemen also hurried to the mountain to assist them against the rebels.|$|R
40|$|Urban {{land use}} succession- {{the process of}} taking an {{existing}} structure out of service- assumes three forms: demolition to hold the land, demolition to immediately build a new structure, and abandonment., In the abandonment form, the landlord relinquishes all property rights and most tenants soon leave the building. When land use succession is accomplished through demolition not immediately followed by new construction, a parking lot is often the succeeding land use. Thus, one can fre-quently observe vacant structures or parking lots adjacent to structures still in use. Some observers have questioned the rationality of the landlord's decision to <b>abandon</b> his <b>parcel</b> or demolish his building without immediately building a new structure. These observers have suggested that landlords engage in a self-fulfilling prophecy: i. e. by failure to maintain their parcels, they have made them undesirable for renters (The National Urban League, 1971, p. 87; Sternlieb, 1973, p. 64). To these observers, land use succession sometimes appears to be premature, since apparently profitable buildings are taken out of service. The limitations of present land use succession theory do not permit a full analysis {{of the question of}} premature succession. In this paper's first section, existing theory is reviewed and formulated in a dynamic framework. In the second section, stochastic opportunity costs of taking an existing building out of service are introduced. In the final section, the extended theory is used to investigate conditions under which land use succession can properly be said to be premature...|$|R
