5|$|New World Pictures {{produced}} a 95-minute English-dubbed {{adaptation of the}} film, titled Warriors of the Wind, and it was released theatrically in the United States in June 1985, with the VHS video release in December 1985. In the late 1980s, Vestron Video would release the film and First Independent Video would re-release it in 1993 with <b>another</b> <b>minute</b> cut from the film. The voice actors and actresses were not informed of the film's plotline and the film was heavily edited to market it as a children's action-adventure film. Consequently, part of the film's narrative meaning was lost: some of the environmentalist themes were diluted as was the main subplot of the Ohmu, altered {{to turn them into}} aggressive enemies. Most of the characters' names were changed, including the titular character who became Princess Zandra. The United States cover for the VHS release featured a cadre of male characters who are not in the film, riding the resurrected God Warrior—including a still-living Warrior shown briefly in a flashback. Approximately 22 minutes of scenes were cut for the film's North American release.|$|E
25|$|The {{next day}} {{was the first of}} three {{consecutive}} summit finishes that preceded the second rest day. Contador, alongside José Rujano, took the opportunity to further stamp his authority on the race, taking <b>another</b> <b>minute</b> and a half out of the race's other top riders. Sivtsov lost two minutes and 42 seconds to Contador, and more significantly a little over a minute to the race's other leading riders. This dropped him to sixth place overall. He lost more time on the Zoncolan the next day, though his overall position remained unchanged. Stage 15 was the first time no HTC-Highroad rider occupied a position in the top ten, as Sivtsov dropped to 12th overall by losing close to seven minutes in the Giro's queen stage. Pinotti rebounded a bit from a disappointing second half of the Giro to ride to eighth place in the stage 16 individual time trial.|$|E
500|$|After <b>another</b> <b>minute,</b> the ship's lights flickered {{once and}} then {{permanently}} went out, plunging Titanic into darkness. Jack Thayer recalled seeing [...] "groups of the fifteen hundred people still aboard, clinging in clusters or bunches, like swarming bees; only to fall in masses, pairs or singly as the great afterpart of the ship, two hundred fifty feet of it, rose into the sky." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Bouncer, after <b>another</b> <b>minute's</b> consideration, {{said that}} he thought he would not do so. [...] "Mr. Bouncer," [...] said Mr. Chaffanbrass, [...] "I am uncommonly obliged to our {{excellent}} friend, Sir Gregory, for having given us the advantage of your evidence." ...|$|R
5000|$|Centrifuge {{the plasma}} (in the plastic {{centrifuge}} tube) for <b>another</b> 15 <b>minutes.</b>|$|R

500|$|Pyroclastic flow {{material}} {{passed over}} the moving avalanche and spread outward, devastating a fan-shaped area 23 miles across by 19 miles long (37km× 31km). In total about [...] of forest was knocked down, and extreme heat killed trees miles beyond the blow-down zone. At its vent the lateral blast probably did not last longer than about 30seconds, but the northward-radiating and expanding blast cloud continued for about <b>another</b> <b>minute.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{young man}} then begins to {{remember}} his first sexual encounter with his unnamed lover as a teenager, when he pressured her into {{having sex with}} him in his car ("Paradise by the Dashboard Light"); the song features a duet between Meat Loaf and Ellen Foley in which The Boy (the dying man's younger self) and his unnamed girlfriend in which The Boy tries to convince his girlfriend to submit to him, while the girl feebly attempts to reject his advances. They [...] "make out" [...] heavily in the middle instrumental section, described in metaphor in a baseball commentary by New York Yankees announcer Phil Rizzuto. Right before The Man is about to take her virginity, the girl makes him swear that he will love her, which he passionately agrees to; however, over time The Man grows sick of the relationship and ultimately commits suicide by crashing his car ("if I got to spend <b>another</b> <b>minute</b> with you I don't think that I can really survive.") ...|$|E
500|$|The song's lyrical {{structure}} is irregular. While many songs {{have the same}} number of lines for the verse or chorus, the first verse has eight lines, the second verse has six lines, and the last verse has two lines. The song's first chorus has two lines, the second chorus has three, and the third chorus has twelve lines. At the beginning of every chorus, the piano, bass and drums drop out and the backing vocals sing [...] "you got to roll me" [...] as the guitar plays the song's signature guitar figure. The third chorus leads into the song's coda. Slowly, the band's rhythm section works its way back into the song. The coda includes a call and response with the backing vocals singing [...] "you got to roll me" [...] as Jagger and Richards respond by singing [...] "keep on rolling." [...] This happens over a pounding beat laid down by Charlie Watts. After a few measures, Watts resumes playing his regular drum pattern. The coda continues for <b>another</b> <b>minute</b> as Jagger ad-libs lyrics until the fade out.|$|E

500|$|Following the album's low-budget release, Shields boasted, [...] "We {{know more}} about how the record {{industry}} works than our record company half the time. We do. I'm not joking." [...] That winter the band toured Europe, an event music critic David Cavanagh described as a [...] "unique chapter in live music". To recreate the higher tones from Loveless, Shields employed American flautist Anna Quimby. According {{to a friend of}} the band, [...] "She had a little skirt on, black tights...she was a little indie girl. But when she blew into the flute, it was like fucking Woodstock". NME editor Danny Kelly attended a show he described as [...] "more like torture than entertainment, I had a half pint of lager; they hit their first note and it was so loud that it sent the glass hurtling". A US spring tour followed, during which Shields and Butcher tested their audiences' ability to sustain noise played at high volumes. Critic Mark Kemp said of the American tour, [...] "After about thirty seconds the adrenaline set in, people are screaming and shaking their fists. After a minute you wonder what's going on. After <b>another</b> <b>minute</b> it's total confusion. The noise starts hurting. The noise continues. After three minutes you begin to take deep breaths. After four minutes, a calm takes over." [...] The tour saw My Bloody Valentine accused of criminal negligence by the music press, who took exception to the long period of extreme noise played during [...] "You Made Me Realise", referring to it as [...] "the holocaust". In December 2000 Mojo magazine rated the tour as the second loudest in history.|$|E
500|$|Biographer Taraborrelli commented, [...] "Madonna {{had more}} {{confidence}} in her stage presence, her music was showing a deeper maturity, her voice was fuller, and the show was expertly choreographed with complex numbers. J. D. Considine from The Baltimore Sun commented, [...] "I've seen the Springsteen stadium tour, I've seen Dylan and the [...] Dead, and I was at Live Aid. Out of all those shows, Madonna's {{is the only one}} I want to see again. You need a larger-than-life show if you want to come off in a stadium, and Madonna does. She's not that large physically, but she holds your attention." [...] Ann Ayers, assistant entertainment editor of USA Today felt that the show was high on glitz and low on emotional quotient. [...] "Madonna's going for a certain kind of show: a Broadway, show-biz, song-and-dance spectacle. In that context it's hard to make a connection with the audience, and I'd have to say that she didn't." [...] Peter Goddard from Toronto Star reviewed the concert in CNE Stadium and said, [...] "Madonna proved that she may be a lost girl in the roads of life, like her film, but she ain't lost when she is singing. Especially during songs like 'Papa Don't Preach', her vocal prowess was substantially notable." [...] Scott A Zamost and Elizabeth Snead, writing for Chicago Tribune, felt that [...] "For the most part, the premiere concert on Madonna's Who's That Girl tour was a success, an extravaganza of multiple videos, flashing lights and precision dancing. If the high-tech accoutrements and inferior sound system made it difficult to hear the singer, one hopes that will be refined as the tour continues across the United States. [...] As a dancer, Madonna is supreme on stage. Her trademark skip to a funky beat highlighted the constant acrobatics. One minute she was stage left, <b>another</b> <b>minute</b> stage right. She ran up a wide staircase center stage to party with her three back-up singers, then scooted down to the stage floor, swinging her hips, accompanied by other dancers." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Constellation {{entered a}} dive, with debris being blasted {{out of the}} {{aircraft}} as it spiraled to the ground. [...] The DC-8, having lost one engine and {{a large part of}} the right wing, managed to remain in flight for <b>another</b> <b>minute</b> and a half.|$|E
60|$|<b>Another</b> five <b>minutes</b> {{there was}} a stumble and a fall in front of Ralph.|$|R
60|$|<b>Another</b> two <b>minutes</b> went by, {{then the}} door opened and the parlour-maid came in.|$|R
60|$|The men plodded away up the gully, and in <b>another</b> few <b>minutes</b> Nasmyth {{was sound}} asleep.|$|R
2500|$|The {{story goes}} that Mary {{had spent the}} evening dancing with a boyfriend at the Oh Henry Ballroom. At some point, they got into an {{argument}} and Mary stormed out. Even {{though it was a}} cold winter’s night, she thought she would rather face a cold walk home than spend <b>another</b> <b>minute</b> with her boyfriend.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the crew}} had been {{informed}} that the casualty had [...] "breathing difficulty," [...] the only equipment that they took into the custody suite was a bag valve mask. The paramedic admitted later that when they had received the call out, he had told his colleague [...] "that {{it would probably be}} someone trying to pull a sickie [...] to get out of appearing in court in the morning." [...] He had to return to the ambulance outside to collect the necessary equipment, not returning until <b>another</b> <b>minute</b> had elapsed. The ambulance technician who first examined Alder reported him as having fixed, dilated pupils, no pulse and not breathing. They eventually ceased CPR at 4.35am.|$|E
2500|$|This {{work was}} done in {{primitive}} buildings and facilities. The equipment hut comprised a minute workshop at one end, {{an office in the}} middle and <b>another</b> <b>minute</b> room at the other end, used as a kitchen and after-work gathering place while dinner was prepared: after returning from the pub, conversation would be animated as one of them hammered veal then cooked wiener schnitzel in an atmosphere [...] "thick with fug". Staff members, who spent several days per week there, slept and ate in an adjacent single-roomed weatherboard hut with a table down the middle and camp stretchers around the sides. But among these achievers, morale and excitement was very high and their social life was lively. Colleagues from the days at Dapto, describing Wild – as many did – as [...] "colleague, mentor and good friend" [...] said [...] " [...] He could light up a room with his wit, intelligence and charm. He loved a party and a few beers." ...|$|E
60|$|Captain Ewart {{remained}} there for <b>another</b> ten <b>minutes.</b> When he came out, {{he nodded to}} Gregory.|$|R
60|$|Okanagan nodded, and in <b>another</b> five <b>minutes</b> Alton {{looked into}} the room where Horton was still writing.|$|R
60|$|In <b>another</b> ten <b>minutes</b> {{the drive}} itself {{roughened}} and became gravel again, tilting all its water towards the shrubbery.|$|R
2500|$|Elsie arrives joyfully for {{her wedding}} {{to the man}} she still knows as [...] "Leonard", but the Lieutenant arrives and announces that her husband Fairfax lives. [...] Fairfax arrives dressed for the wedding, but Elsie, distraught {{over the loss of}} [...] "Leonard", does not turn to see his face. [...] He teases his wife, keeping up the pretence for <b>another</b> <b>minute.</b> [...] Elsie begs for his mercy, to free her to go to her love, [...] "Leonard", but he says that his heart is like a [...] "massive rock" [...] and claims her as his bride. [...] Finally Elsie turns to see his face, and finally {{recognises}} him as her adored one. [...] All once again erupt into joy, except the broken-hearted Jack Point. Tearfully, he reprises the song that he had earlier sung with Elsie, The Merryman and his Maid, with wrenching sorrow. [...] Elsie [...] "drops a tear" [...] for Point, but turns back to her love. [...] As the chorus turns away to celebrate the marriage of Fairfax and Elsie, Point falls insensible at their feet.|$|E
2500|$|The show, {{scheduled}} in a graveyard slot on Tuesday nights at 8:00p.m., {{was not expected}} to challenge the ratings giants Milton Berle and Frank Sinatra, but did surprisingly well. Berle, known to many early television viewers as [...] "Uncle Miltie" [...] and for using ancient vaudeville material, joked about Sheen, [...] "He uses old material, too", and observed that [...] "f I'm going to be eased off the top by anyone, it's better that I lose to the One for whom Bishop Sheen is speaking." [...] Sheen responded in jest that maybe people should start calling him [...] "Uncle Fultie". Life and Time magazine ran feature stories on Bishop Sheen. The number of stations carrying Life Is Worth Living jumped from three to fifteen {{in less than two}} months. There was fan mail that flowed in at a rate of 8,500 letters per week. There were four times as many requests for tickets as could be fulfilled. Admiral, the sponsor, paid the production costs in return for a one-minute commercial {{at the opening of the}} show and <b>another</b> <b>minute</b> at the close. In 1952 Sheen won an Emmy Award for his efforts, accepting the acknowledgment by saying, [...] "I feel it is time I pay tribute to my four writers—Matthew, Mark, Luke and John." [...] When Sheen won the Emmy, Berle quipped, [...] "We both work for 'Sky Chief'", a reference to Berle's sponsor Texaco. Time called him [...] "the first 'televangelist'", and the Archdiocese of New York could not meet the demand for tickets.|$|E
60|$|In <b>another</b> <b>minute</b> Edward Cossey entered, {{and the two}} men shook hands.|$|E
60|$|<b>Another</b> ten <b>minutes,</b> and Jacopo slid rapidly {{down by the}} stays, {{and stood}} on the deck with bared head.|$|R
60|$|They {{waited for}} <b>another</b> five <b>minutes.</b> Then Holderness limped towards {{the stairs with}} a little imprecation. Lutchester stopped him.|$|R
60|$|SIR WILLIAM. [Genially] Can {{you give}} me <b>another</b> five <b>minutes,</b> Bill? [Pointing to the billiard-room] We'll come directly, my dear.|$|R
60|$|With {{a troubled}} face Nasmyth stood {{still in the}} rain <b>another</b> <b>minute.</b>|$|E
60|$|In <b>another</b> <b>minute</b> Kenneth {{was again}} {{coursing}} {{along the road}} at full speed.|$|E
60|$|In <b>another</b> <b>minute</b> {{the bread}} was taken out, {{and cut into}} two portions.|$|E
6000|$|For <b>another</b> five <b>minutes</b> this continued, when Aunt Mildred withdrew {{her hand}} with an effort, and said, with a nervous laugh: ...|$|R
60|$|In <b>another</b> five <b>minutes,</b> Percy was {{sufficiently}} recovered {{to begin to}} dress. The commander of the Farcey now turned to Ralph.|$|R
