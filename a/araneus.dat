5|$|Bilins are found, for example, in Micrommata virescens, {{resulting}} in its green color. Guanine {{is responsible for}} the white markings of the European garden spider <b>Araneus</b> diadematus. It is in many species accumulated in specialized cells called guanocytes. In genera such as Tetragnatha, Leucauge, Argyrodes or Theridiosoma, guanine creates their silvery appearance. While guanine is originally an end-product of protein metabolism, its excretion can be blocked in spiders, leading to an increase in its storage. Structural colors occur in some species, which are the result of the diffraction, scattering or interference of light, for example by modified setae or scales. The white prosoma of Argiope results from hairs reflecting the light, Lycosa and Josa both have areas of modified cuticle that act as light reflectors.|$|E
25|$|As {{an example}} of a complex {{spinning}} field, the spinneret apparatus of an adult <b>Araneus</b> diadematus (garden cross spider) consists of the glands shown below. Similar multiple gland architecture exists in the black widow spider.|$|E
25|$|Some {{species are}} {{polymorphic}} for different chromosome structural forms. The structural variation {{may be associated}} with different numbers of chromosomes in different individuals, which occurs in the ladybird beetle Chilocorus stigma, some mantids of the genus Ameles, the European shrew Sorex <b>araneus.</b> There is some evidence from the case of the mollusc Thais lapillus (the dog whelk) on the Brittany coast, that the two chromosome morphs are adapted to different habitats.|$|E
25|$|A more {{complicated}} form of epigyne {{is found in}} spiders of the genus <b>Araneus,</b> where there is developed an appendage which is usually soft and flexible, and which is termed the scape or ovipositor. When there is a well-developed scape, the tip of it is usually more or less spoon-shaped. This part of the scape is termed the cochlear. The basal plate of the epigyne which bears the scape, and which forms a porch or hood that covers {{the opening of the}} oviduct is called the atriolum.|$|E

2500|$|The name [...] "house spider" [...] is {{also used}} {{worldwide}} of different spider species, notably Tegenaria domestica in Europe and <b>Araneus</b> cavaticus, {{also known as the}} barn spider. Many other species can be referred to as such; therefore it is preferable to use the scientific name for identification.|$|E
2500|$|Double-tailed tent spiders {{were first}} {{described}} by the Slovakian military surgeon Carl Ludwig Doleschall while stationed in Java in 1859 with the Dutch army. He originally classified it under the genus Epeira (which is now the genus <b>Araneus).</b> [...] They are currently classified under the genus Cyrtophora (tent-web spiders) under subfamily Cyrtophorinae. They belong to the very large orb-weaver spider family (Araneidae).|$|E

2500|$|Austracantha minax is most {{commonly}} known as [...] "jewel spiders" [...] due to their body colouration. This may sometimes be specified further as [...] "Australian jewel spiders" [...] due to the common name being shared with the unrelated North American jewel spider <b>Araneus</b> gemmoides, {{as well as the}} widespread jewel box spider Gasteracantha cancriformis. In some parts of Australia they are also widely known as [...] "Christmas spiders" [...] because they are most numerous during the summer months (December and January). Other common names for the species include [...] "six-spined spiders" [...] and [...] "spiny spiders" [...] in reference to the spine-like projections on their abdomens.|$|E
2500|$|It can be assumed, that Hahn was {{in close}} contact with the universally known natural {{scientist}} Jakob Sturm and probably with his two sons. He named a spider species after Jakob: <b>Araneus</b> Sturmii, now Atea sturmi (Hahn, 1831). His relationship with Johann Georg Wagler must have been similarly close. He also named a spider species after him: Lÿcosa Waglerii, now Pardosa wagleri (Hahn, 1822). Nothing reliable is known about other contacts within the remarkably productive Nuremberg zoologist scene. Nor is there any proof, that Hahn knew Franz von Paula (von) Schrank personally, a highly regarded natural scientist, to whom he dedicated the [...] "Monograph on Spiders". The scientific value of Hahn's lifework in natural history varies. His ornithological work, for example, never had any discernible influence on this field. On the other hand, Hahn's work on the true bugs (Heteroptera) {{is just as important as}} his works on spiders (Araneae). One species of bug even carries his name: Lopus hahni Stål, 1860. He was also given this honour in the field of arachnology: Carl Ludwig Koch, who continued [...] "Die Arachniden" [...] after Hahn's death, called a genus after him in 1841 (Hahnia), on which later the name of the whole family was based – Hahniidae Bertkau, 1878.|$|E
