40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{immunohistochemical}} {{study was to investigate}} the expression and the distribution pattern of the neuropeptides vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide and bombesin as well in 25 pieces of human tracheal tissue as in 10 pieces of human vocal cord tissue. The results indicated that the larynx as well as the trachea are containing the studied neuropeptides. The expression of these neuropeptides concerning histological structures were comparable to each other in both tissues. There was a strong immunoreactivity around seromucosal glands, blood vessels and within the epithelium but low concentrations within nerve fibers. The concentrations of the studied peptides by immunohistochemical methods increased in the following order: VIP < SP < CGRP < Bombesin. Some effects caused by these peptides like vasodilatation and hypersecretion seem to infuence the development of inflammations and <b>allergical</b> diseases. In healthy human trachea the neuropeptide bombesin could be detected for the first time. It could be found in a high concentration within the basal membrane of the epithelium. The fact that bombesin influences different growth factors might be an indication to its responsibility concerning the formation of scars or stenosis in tracheal tissue. Since the mechanisms and the significance of neuropeptide reactivity in the human trachea and the human larynx are not completely understood yet, further studies are necessary...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the venture}} was to {{initiate}} the agonistic effects of the natural complement peptides C 3 a and C 5 a, which {{play a major role}} in the scope of inflammtory reactions especially Type III <b>allergical</b> reactions where they are the central mediators of inflammation, by synthetic peptides and on this basis to develop antagonists. Based on our preliminary work it promised to be a success, using the mechanism of stimulus specific deactivation as a way to further extend the antagonistic blockade of the receptors. As an example 35 synthetic peptides from the C-terminal sequence of the C 3 a peptide were produced and detailed activation and deactivation qualities in biological testsystems on granulozytes, thrombozytes, makrophages and in the guinea pig ilium-assay were tested. Competitive binding studies on cells and membrane preparations underlined the biological analysis. Molecular biological techniques led to the production of recombinent C 5 a and C 5 a-receptor and to precise localization of the receptor-binding sequences for the anaphylatoxic peptides. The results of these analysis lead to step by step changing peptides with an increased antagonistic effect. All this work was published and the results are a starting point for further research, on the role of the ligand receptor interaction and their sequelae in early inflammatory reactions with the aim to interfere by therapeutic intervention with antagonists.

40|$|Dipeptidyl {{peptidase}} IV (DPPIV, EC 3. 4. 14. 5) {{was described}} as an exopeptidase {{for the first time}} in 1966 and later, in 1990, identified as the T cell activation marker CD 26. Since then several biological functions for this protein have been determined, such as endopeptidase activity, activation and inactivation of biological active peptides, co-stimulation of T cell activation, involvement in cell-cell- and cell-matrix-adhesion processes, as well as a receptor for the adenosine deaminase (ADA). This work was intended to contribute to the clarification of the structure and functions as well as the molecular characteristics of this multifunctional protein. At the beginning of the work the primary structure of DPPIV/CD 26, which had not been completely elucidated before, was determined by cDNA-screening, cloning and sequencing. The catalytic site of this enzyme was characterized by using site-directed mutagenesis. The reaction center is located at the C-terminus of the extracellular domain of this protein, in the so-called catalytic triad consisting of the three amino acids: Ser 631, Asp 709 and His 741. We found that DPPIV/CD 26 undergoes translocation to the endosomes after being expressed on the plasma membrane (recycling) and, thereafter, its N-glycan structures are further modified (reprocessing). In our model we have determined that the cotranslational N-glycosylation of DPPIV/CD 26 is important for the attainment of a correctly folded, stable conformation of this glycoprotein. Furthermore, we have shown that 12 cysteines, which form disulfide bridges, play an essential role in the building and maintenance of the tertiary structure and biological properties of this protein. Because of its multifunctional character, we focused on the question to what extent such functions are coupled with each other. We found that the enzymatic activity of DPPIV/CD 26 is neither apparently necessary for the adhesion of DPPIV/CD 26 to the collagen I nor for its co-stimulatory activity of the T cell activation. Although adenosine deaminase is not involved in the DPPIV/CD 26 -mediated T cell activation, the interaction of DPPIV/CD 26 with collagen I significantly inhibits DPPIV/CD 26 mediated cellular signal transduction. From the results obtained we asked how DPPIV/CD 26 functions as a multifunctional protein in vivo and which role it plays in diseases. Thereby, the role of DPPIV/CD 26 in the immune response, as well as in different diseases, such as infection disease (tuberculosis), <b>allergical</b> diseases (asthma) and autoimmune diseases (EAE: experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis), was investigated using DPPIV/CD 26 -knockout-mice. Although the DPPIV/CD 26 -knockout-mice display an apparently normal phenotype, the elimination of the DPPIV/CD 26 gene showed an influence on the development, maturation and migration of CD 4 +-, NK- and CD 4 +-NKT-cells. After stimulation of mice with pockeweed mitogen (PWM), an effect of DPPIV/CD 26 on the cytokine secretion and T cell-dependent antibody production was observed. DPPIV/CD 26 -/- mice showed a markedly reduced secretion of IL- 4 and IgG-production. After ovalbumin sensitization and challenge, DPPIV/CD 26 -/- mice exhibited an exaggerated bronchial infiltration of leukocytes, especially eosinophils, and increased airway inflammation. Finally, in order to analyze the structure-functions relationships of this multifunctional protein at the molecular level, we aimed to elucidate the three-dimensional structure of DPPIV/CD 26. For that purpose the 3 D-structures which were reconstructed by cryo-EM and single particle analysis, and the crystal structures of rat DPPIV/CD 26 and the human DPPIV/CD 26 in complex with bovine adenosine deaminase (ADA) were obtained. The most prominent result is the demonstration of a second side opening in DPPIV/CD 26 which connects with the first opening at the outer top face through a channel and would enable direct access to the catalytic site. The 3 D- and crystal structure of the CD 26 -ADA complex showed that the ADA-binding site is stretched across CD 26 ß-propeller blades IV and V, while DPPIV/CD 26 interacts with the -helices of ADA. 14 amino acids of hDPPIV/CD 26 and 13 amino acids of bADA are directly involved in this interaction. The clarification of the 3 D- and crystal structure of DPPIV/CD 26 and DPPIV/CD 26 -ADA-complex allows us to better understand the catalytic mechanism, the interaction of DPPIV/CD 26 with ADA and other proteins, as well as functional molecular basis of the multifunctional membrane glycoprotein...|$|E
