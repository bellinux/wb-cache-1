500|$|Though {{the crafts}} move {{at very high}} straight-line speeds, Wipeout takes its {{inspiration}} from Formula 1 breakthroughs by aspiring for even greater turning speeds. Using the Formula 1 parallel, rather than using aerodynamics to increase wheel grip by down-force for faster turning speeds, Wipeout uses a fictionalised method of air braking for ever greater turning force. Just moving a craft left or right alone is very responsive, but by applying an air-brake {{in the direction of}} movement, players zip around very tight turns at near top speed, including those greater than 90 degrees. By applying an air-brake, the turn starts out gradually but as it continues, change in direction increases sharply. Where necessary, the player may also use dual <b>air-brakes</b> for rapid deceleration, typically used if the pilot has flown off the racing line in tight corners and needs to steady. The player can also take on damage from enemy fire and be blown up, but the ship can be [...] "recharged" [...] to health at the pit stop in exchange for a precious few seconds of the race.|$|E
2500|$|... 10 {{cars were}} built in 1928 by English Electric in Preston. These cars were single-deckers and {{purchased}} {{at a cost of}} £2,000 (equivalent to £ in [...] ), by Blackpool Corporation Tramways. They were designed for interurban use and have an American style appearance with 48 seats. Originally given the nickname [...] "Pullman" [...] cars due to their more luxurious assets, they were equipped with a pantograph built by Brecknell, Munro & Rogers mounted on a tall tower, which very quickly earned them the longer-lasting nickname [...] "Pantographs". They were subsequently fitted with traditional trolley poles. The first car (167), was delivered on 30 July 1928 and the last, 176, in 1929. They were [...] long and [...] wide, had Dick Kerr bogies, BTH B510 motors and <b>air-brakes,</b> with hand and rheostatic brakes.|$|E
50|$|Following {{the type}} code in the {{classification}} code a letter may denote the type of coupler, nowadays optional, as all new freight cars are fitted with centre buffer couplers (CBC). An 'N' suffix is for 'pneumatic', or <b>air-braked</b> wagons. Most newer stock that is <b>air-braked</b> also has CBC couplers, so the 'C' is usually dropped. E.g., BOXN for <b>air-braked</b> BOX wagons, not BOXCN. Almost all the older stock is vacuum-braked.|$|R

2500|$|Initial {{enthusiasm for}} the {{aircraft}} was dampened by several problems, the most alarming inherited from MiG-15/MiG-17 was the danger of mid-air tank implosions when {{more than half of}} the fuel had been used - the leaking fuel of the crushed fuselage fuel tanks located between the engines would then ignite, leading to a fatal explosion. Furthermore, deployment of <b>air-brakes</b> at high speeds caused a high-g pitch-up, elevators lacked authority at supersonic speeds, and the aircraft possessed a high landing speed of [...] Absence of a two-seat trainer version slowed pilot transition to the type. Handling problems were addressed with the second prototype, SM-9/2, which added a third ventral air-brake and introduced all-moving tail-planes with a damper to prevent pilot-induced oscillations (PIO) at subsonic speeds, flying for the first time on 16 September 1954, and entering initial production as the MiG-19.|$|E
2500|$|The I-360 (SM-2), {{built in}} 1952, had [...] longer fuselage, {{wingspan}} reduced to , and weight increased to [...] {{and a new}} 55° sweep wing. The Nudelman N-37D cannon were moved to the wing roots to open space in a nose for the radar. Cockpit and landing gear were redesigned and a vertical stabilizer of increased area mounting a T-tail was fitted. In April 1952 the first prototype {{was sent to the}} Letno-Issledovatel'skiy Institut (en:flight research institute) (LII), flying {{for the first time on}} 27 May 1952 by G. A. Sedov. It was immediately clear that the AM-5A engines were not powerful enough, and they were replaced with AM-5F delivering [...] (dry - wet), allowing a maximum speed of M=1.19 in horizontal flight. Flight testing prompted modifications to the <b>air-brakes</b> and control surfaces, re-designated as the SM-2A and after further modifications the prototype was re-designated again as the SM-2B.|$|E
60|$|Presently, however, a big bell {{commenced}} to toll, and the jolting of the <b>air-brakes</b> flung {{her forward}} in her seat, while in another few moments the long cars stopped, and the conductor {{pushed his way}} through the perspiring passengers who surged towards the vestibule.|$|E
50|$|Although {{equipped}} with Westinghouse compressor pumps, {{photographs of the}} Nelson Section WF's show that the brake hoses had been removed, although WF 397 sported brake hoses {{for a time in}} 1956.

60|$|The {{staff of}} the train--surely the great American nation would be lost if {{deprived}} of the ennobling society of brakeman, conductor, Pullman-car conductor, negro porter, and newsboy--told pleasant tales, as they spread themselves at ease in the smoking compartments, of snowings up the line to Montreal, of desperate attacks--four engines together and a snow-plough in front--on drifts thirty feet high, and the pleasures of walking along the tops of goods wagons to brake a train, with the thermometer thirty below freezing. 'It comes cheaper to kill men that way than to put <b>air-brakes</b> on freight-cars,' said the brakeman.|$|E
6000|$|The papa said, [...] "Now {{every time}} you stop me I shall have to begin all over again." [...] But he saw {{that this was not}} going to spite them any, so he went on: [...] "One of the {{locomotives}} was its mother, and she had got hurt once in a big smash-up, so that she couldn't run long trips any more. She was so weak in the chest you could hear her wheeze as far as you could see her. But she could work round the depot, and pull empty cars in and out, and shunt them off on the side tracks; and she was so anxious to be useful that all the other engines respected her, and they were very kind to the little Pony Engine on her account, though it was always getting in the way, and under their wheels, and everything. They all knew it was an orphan, for before its mother got hurt its father went through a bridge one dark night into an arm of the sea, and was never heard of again; he {{was supposed to have been}} drowned. The old mother locomotive used to say that it would never have happened if she had been there; but poor dear No. 236 was always so venturesome, and she had warned him against that very bridge time and again. Then she would whistle so dolefully, and sigh with her <b>air-brakes</b> enough to make anybody cry. You see they used to be a very happy family when they were all together, before the papa locomotive got drowned. He was very fond of the little Pony Engine, and told it stories at night after they got into the car-house, at the end of some of his long runs. It would get up on his cow-catcher, and lean its chimney up against his, and listen till it fell asleep. Then he would put it softly down, and be off again in the morning before it was awake. I tell you, those were happy days for poor No. 236. The little Pony Engine could just remember him; it was awfully proud of its papa." ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{the first}} touch of dry land makes {{the sea and}} all upon it unreal. Five minutes after the {{traveller}} is on the C.P.R, train at Vancouver there is no romance of blue water, but another kind--the life of the train into which he comes to grow as into life aboard ship. A week on wheels turns a man into {{a part of the}} machine. He knows when the train will stop to water, wait for news of the trestle ahead, drop the dining-car, slip into a siding to let the West-bound mail go by, or yell through the thick night for an engine to help push up the bank. The snort, the snap and whine of the <b>air-brakes</b> have a meaning for him, and he learns to distinguish between noises--between the rattle of a loose lamp and the ugly rattle of small stones on a scarped embankment--between the 'Hoot! toot!' that scares wandering cows from the line, and the dry roar of the engine at the distance-signal. In England the railway came late into a settled country fenced round with the terrors of the law, and it has remained ever since just a little outside daily life--a thing to be respected. Here it strolls along, with its hands in its pockets and a straw in its mouth, {{on the heels of the}} rough-hewn trail or log road--a platformless, regulationless necessity; and it is treated even by sick persons and young children with a familiarity that sometimes affects the death-rate. There was a small maiden aged seven, who honoured our smoking compartment with her presence when other excitements failed, and it was she that said to the conductor, 'When do we change crews? I want to pick water-lilies--yellow ones.' A mere halt she knew would not suffice for her needs; but the regular fifteen-minute stop, when the red-painted tool-chest was taken off the rear car and a new gang came aboard. The big man bent down to little Impudence--'Want to pick lilies, eh? What would you do if the cars went on and took mama away, Sis?' 'Take the, next train,' she replied, 'and tell the conductor to send me to Brooklyn. I live there.' 'But s'pose he wouldn't?' 'He'd have to,' said Young America. 'I'd be a lost child.' ...|$|E

50|$|The owners {{struggled}} on {{with the}} 1972 coaches {{until the end of}} the 1986 season, by which time only five were serviceable. Despite continuing losses and poor prospects the Council felt it had no option but to replace the lot, accepting a tender submitted by Alan Keefe Ltd for a rake of five articulated, <b>air-braked</b> toastrack coaches with slatted seats. Each had four bays each capable of seating four adults, giving trains a theoretical capacity of eighty. They were delivered in February 1987 and <b>air-braking</b> was fitted to the locomotives.|$|R

25|$|European railway {{air brakes}} include the Kunze-Knorr brake (invented by Georg Knorr and {{manufactured}} by Knorr-Bremse) and the Oerlikon. The working principle {{is the same}} as for the Westinghouse air brake. In the steam era, Britain's railways were divided– some using vacuum brakes and some using air brakes– but there was a gradual standardization on the vacuum brake. Some locomotives, e.g. on the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway, were dual-fitted so that they could work with either vacuum- or <b>air-braked</b> trains. In the diesel era, the process was reversed and British Railways switched from vacuum-braked to <b>air-braked</b> rolling stock in the 1960s.|$|R

Prior to introducing Inka coaches, the train ran with old vacuum brake coaches.However, the train used to ran with Iranian <b>air-brake</b> coaches in between 1998 to 2011. Later, due to maintenance problem, Iranian airbrake coaches were replaced with vacuum coaches in 2011.|$|R
