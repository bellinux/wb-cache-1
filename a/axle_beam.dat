50|$|The SuperSteer {{front axle}} reduces the turn {{radius of the}} tractor. The front <b>axle</b> <b>beam</b> turns with the wheels to give an {{effective}} turn angle of 65°. The tractor turns tighter and faster so it spends less time turning and more time working.

50|$|From 1980 through 1996, Ford {{offered a}} {{four-wheel-drive}} swing arm {{independent front suspension}} called Twin Traction Beam (TTB). Based on its two-wheel-drive twin I-beam suspension from 1965, Ford mounted a Dana 44 differential in the driver-side (front) <b>axle</b> <b>beam</b> and transmitted torque to the passenger-side wheel with a double U-jointed axleshaft. Radius arms and coil springs were still used on the F-150, while the four-wheel-drive F-250 and F-350 got leaf springs. The F-250 received TTB Dana 50 axles, and the F-350 a solid Dana 60 axle.|$|E
50|$|Over a given obstacle, {{vehicles}} with simple AWD systems and chassis designs that restrict their RTI—i.e. that have poorer axle articulation—lift a wheel early {{which is then}} free to turn spinning away power unless differentials are able to be locked. A vehicle with high RTI tends to make uninterrupted (safer) progress as all wheels remain {{in contact with the}} ground during the maneuver. One chassis concept that often allows comparatively high RTI is the live <b>axle</b> (<b>beam</b> axle). Independent suspensions have tended to have reduced articulation while offering better on-road comfort, and are becoming increasingly popular in road-oriented SUVs.|$|E
50|$|Dubonnet {{suspension}} was {{a system}} of trailing arm independent front suspension and steering popular mainly in the 1930s and 1940s. Not very durable unless exactingly maintained, it was soon replaced by other versions. It consisted of a rigidly mounted <b>axle</b> <b>beam</b> in which the sprung steering and suspension arms pivoted around kingpins mounted {{on the ends of}} the axle. The wheels themselves were mounted onto stub axles, suspended from the kingpins. The system featured an encased coil spring and shock absorber, which sealed in the oil needed to lubricate and protect the suspension parts. This was also the weakness of the layout, as any leaks would have negative effects on ride and durability.|$|E
50|$|A <b>beam</b> <b>axle,</b> {{rigid axle}} or solid axle is a {{dependent}} suspension design, {{in which a}} set of wheels is connected laterally by a single beam or shaft. <b>Beam</b> <b>axles</b> were once commonly used at the rear wheels of a vehicle, but historically they have also been used as front axles in rear-wheel-drive vehicles. In most automobiles, <b>beam</b> <b>axles</b> {{have been replaced by}} front and rear independent suspensions.|$|R
50|$|The {{principal}} {{advantage of}} the <b>beam</b> <b>axle</b> is its simplicity. This simplicity makes it very space-efficient and relatively cheap to manufacture. They are nearly universally used in buses and heavy-duty trucks. Most light and medium duty pickup trucks, SUVs, and vans also use a <b>beam</b> <b>axle,</b> {{at least in the}} rear. <b>Beam</b> <b>axles</b> have an important advantage for off-road applications, as they provide better vehicle articulation and durability in a high load environment.|$|R

5000|$|Following this {{singular}} success, {{the company}} offered steam tricycles with boilers between {{the front wheels}} and two-cylinder engines. They were built in small numbers, evidently a favorite of young playboys. They were later joined by a larger tractor, able to pull trailers (sometimes called a [...] "steam drag"). This larger vehicle introduced the so-called De Dion or [...] "dead" [...] axle; an <b>axle</b> <b>beam</b> carried {{the weight of the}} vehicle with the non weight-bearing driveshafts or drive chains articulated separately alongside it.(footnote: The live axle carries the weight by a rigid tube around the driveshaft, both parts fastened together.) On July 22, 1894, Paris-Rouen race, it averaged 18.7 km/h over the 126 km (78 mi) route, but was disqualified for needing both a driver and a stoker.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{mechanical}} features {{included a}} 1956 Chevrolet rear end, dropped Ford front <b>axle</b> <b>beam,</b> Buick brake drums and early Ford brakes. The frame was handmade of rectangular 2x4 inch steel tubing. The engine was a leftover {{from one of}} Roth's 1955 Chevrolets, having been removed {{to make way for}} a then-new Mark IV big-block given to him by General Motors. It was one of the very few completed cars Roth deemed to be a [...] "mistake" [...] because he felt the car did not show well since the heavily chromed engine and most of the chassis were hidden. The Orbitron was, in fact, one of his few customs to have a hood. Reportedly, the hydraulically operated hood did not fit well due to rushed fiberglass work.|$|E
50|$|Before World War II (1934), {{the front}} wheel drive Citroen Traction Avant had {{independent}} front torsion bar suspension and a flexible trailing dead axle, also sprung by torsion bars. The flexibility of the <b>axle</b> <b>beam</b> provided wheel location features like a twist beam axle. The Czechoslovakian Tatra cars, designed by professor Hans Ledwinka in the mid-1930s, used all around independent torsion bar suspensions, along with air cooled rear engines. Also in the 1930s, prototypes of the first Volkswagen Beetle incorporated torsion bars—especially their transverse mounting style. Ledwinka's concept had been copied by Ferdinand Porsche, whose successors later had to acknowledge the influence of Ledwinka's sophisticated Tatra models on the Porsche-designed Kdf-Wagen of 1938 (later renamed the Beetle), a post-war lawsuit resulting in a DM3,000,000 settlement paid by Volkswagen to Ringhoffer-Tatra in 1961.|$|E
50|$|Magna {{was fitted}} {{with either a}} {{five-speed}} manual or a four-speed ELC automatic transmission with electronic control and overdrive (a button on the shift lever providing the ability to switch between the default three-speed mode or overdrive four-speed). The Executive and luxury Elite models, however, were available only in automatic. In terms of suspension, Magna's front comprised MacPherson struts front design and, at the rear, a three-link torsion <b>beam</b> <b>axle</b> with coil springs (specifically, a torsion <b>beam</b> <b>axle,</b> located by two trailing arms and a Panhard rod). The wagons ran a four-link <b>beam</b> <b>axle</b> with coil springs.|$|R

5000|$|As {{with all}} types of car customization, lots of {{different}} modifications are practiced in different combinations. One popular method of conversion involves removing all body molding, bumpers and fenders, then installing a classic Ford front axle to move the wheels forward and give the car a low, stretched look. Another popular customization is to move the stock Volkswagen <b>axle</b> <b>beam</b> forward or reverse the trailing/torsion arms and re-work the steering linkages. A Volksrod might be finished off with a chopped top and original VW wheels. Paint jobs may be flat black, or more elaborate, including with pinstriping. While Volksrods may be very elaborate, like any hot rod, many are built with few or no expensive chrome-plated or machined aluminum parts, but handmade by a [...] "cut, weld and drive" [...] owner, with simple mechanical tools, welding equipment and basic parts.|$|E
5000|$|In August 2010, Ford {{issued a}} {{voluntary}} recall of 575,000 Windstar minivans for rear axle problems. This recall followed {{an investigation by}} the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration which had begun in May 2010. The NHTSA preliminary evaluation stated the design of the rear <b>axle</b> <b>beam,</b> an inverted [...] "U" [...] channel design, appeared to provide a collection point for road slurry. In states which used lots of road salt, corrosion progressively weakened the axle until it fractured. [...] The states covered by the recall were Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia and Wisconsin, as well as Washington D.C. In May 2012, 27,000 of the minivans from Virginia were added to the axle recall, bringing the overall total to more than 600,000 vehicles between the U.S. and Canada.|$|E
5000|$|The 1.3-litre {{accordingly}} embodied visible {{technical progress}} in several important respects. Another advance much trumpeted {{at the time}} but not uncontroversial in retrospect was the inclusion of “Synchronous springing” (Synchronfederung), also recently introduced by General Motors in North America. The suspension {{was based on the}} relatively complex Dubonnet suspension system for which General Motors had acquired a license, but the General Motors approach involved further developments that attempted better to harmonise the springing of the front and rear wheels. The system included an <b>axle</b> <b>beam</b> rigidly attached to the chassis frame which reduced the unsprung weight on the vehicle, and it came with the promise of a smooth ride, but on a car as small and (by North American standards) light as the Opel 1.3-litre, it attracted criticism for a loss of directional control, especially when the car was not driven in a straight line, while technically astute critics recorded that unless the front wheels were perfectly balanced each time a new tyre was fitted, directional stability was further and alarmingly compromised by savage vibrations travelling up the steering column. As the years continued to roll, the system was presumably refined and the criticisms addressed, but the Opel 1.3 litre was an [...] "early adopter" [...] and with a production run of less than two years, was evidently not in production for long enough to benefit from these developments.|$|E

The analysis starts with in-service measurements of actual loads. In order to obtain these data, load spectra measurements were performed on urban, extra-urban, high-way and off-road conditions. Then, by means of finite element analyses, the stresses in the component were obtained and post-processed by means of two different techniques {{for the assessment of}} welding joints: “Hot Spot” method and Local Stress. The results were eventually discussed and validated through full scale testing.

Criteria like driving behavior and braking performance, influenced by the global stiffness as well as the fatigue life under operational conditions, i. e. customer usage, were taken into account. Theoretical and experimental stress analysis were tools, which were incorporated into the optimization procedure, the latter primarily for the verification of load assumptions and determination of local stresses in service. For the design engineer an easy access is provided to fatigul life evaluation, i. e. the relation between fatigue damage and variable service stresses resulting from individual driving conditions.

40|$|Moan&# 39; {{noise in}} a vehicle causes {{discomfort}} and anxiety to passengers. In the previous study, the causes of moan noise were identified, and a coherence analysis of the components was conducted. It was found that moan noise was generated by the attribution of resonance when the exciting force produced by the stick-slip motion in a brake system was transmitted to a coupled torsional <b>beam</b> <b>axle</b> module. The analysis involved calculation of {{the response of the}} coupled torsional <b>beam</b> <b>axle</b> module on a full suspension brake system reconstructed by consideration of the transfer functions and the joint conditions of the coupled torsional <b>beam</b> <b>axle</b> module and the brake system. Each transfer function is decomposed by a frequency-response-function-based substructuring technique. In this study, when using the sensitivity analysis and optimization techniques for moan-noise reduction, the frequency-response-function-based substructuring technique was performed to calculate the response of the modified coupled torsional <b>beam</b> <b>axle</b> module by considering the joint conditions and the transfer functions of the brake system. Highly sensitive design parameters regarding the response of the coupled torsional <b>beam</b> <b>axle</b> module were identified after the sensitivity analysis. The most sensitive design parameters were selected to enhance the efficiency and the robustness of optimization. The optimal values for the design variables were obtained by applying a progressive quadratic response surface method as a optimization algorithm. The application of an optimization technique was possible using the finite element model and the results of the finite element analysis from the previous study. After optimization, a prototype was re-designed, manufactured and tested. Finally, it was verified that the moan noise was reduced, as the natural frequency of 387 Hz for the coupled torsional <b>beam</b> <b>axle</b> module was moved to a higher frequency...|$|R
40|$|Moan&# 39; {{noise in}} a vehicle is known to cause {{discomfort}} and anxiety to passengers. This abnormal noise is generated by a stick-slip phenomenon between the brake pad and the disc during breaking. The exciting force from the brake system is transmitted to a coupled torsion <b>beam</b> <b>axle</b> module through the brake pad, the caliper and an extra bracket. In this study, moan noise is reproduced during the vehicle&# 39;s operating test, and {{the parts of the}} coupled torsion <b>beam</b> <b>axle</b> module generating moan noise are identified. Further, it is verified that the resonance of the coupled torsion <b>beam</b> <b>axle</b> module due to the exciting force of the brake system is the main cause of moan noise. Coherence analysis and transfer path analysis were conducted to identify how the vibrations from the coupled torsion <b>beam</b> <b>axle</b> module are related to moan noise in the passenger compartments of vehicles. In the coherence analysis, the vibration accelerations of the brake pad, the caliper, the spindle bracket, the trailing arm and the V-beam are set as the inputs, and the output is the noise at the driver&# 39;s ear level. In terms of the frequency response, the results from a modal analysis of the coupled torsion <b>beam</b> <b>axle</b> module under the vehicle&# 39;s test conditions agreed well with those from a finite element modal analysis in which the boundary conditions of the vehicle were taken into consideration. The dynamic characteristics of the response from the coupled torsion <b>beam</b> <b>axle</b> module were identified using the exciting-force transfer mechanism of the brake system. The locations producing a large strain were determined by calculating the modal strain energy, and an improvement scheme with design modification was proposed for moan noise reduction...|$|R
