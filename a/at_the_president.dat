5|$|The {{investigation}} {{may have}} weakened Mallory politically and certainly diverted him from other duties, {{but it was}} not enough to drive him from office. Perhaps because {{there was no one to}} replace him and perhaps because he absorbed shafts that were aimed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>president,</b> Davis retained him in the cabinet until the end of the war. After the surrender of Lee's army at Appomattox, Mallory remained with Davis and the other cabinet members as they fled deeper into the South, first to Danville, Virginia, then to Greensboro, North Carolina, Charlotte, Abbeville, South Carolina, and finally Washington, Georgia. There, Mallory submitted his resignation and went to La Grange, Georgia, where he was temporarily reunited with his wife and children.|$|E

25|$|During this period, {{there were}} several {{assassination}} attempts on Sukarno's life. On 9 March 1960, Daniel Maukar, an Indonesian airforce lieutenant who sympathised with the Permesta rebellion, strafed the Merdeka Palace and Bogor Palace with his MiG-17 fighter jet, attempting to kill the president; he was not injured. In May 1962, Darul Islam agents shot <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> during Eid al-Adha prayers {{on the grounds of}} the palace. Sukarno again escaped injury.|$|E
25|$|According to Pinkerton, {{a captain}} of the roads {{reported}} {{that there was a}} plot to stab the President-elect. The alleged plan was to have several assassins, armed with knives, interspersed throughout the crowd that would gather to greet Lincoln <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> Street station. When Lincoln emerged from the car, which he had to do to change trains, {{at least one of the}} assassins would be able to get close enough to kill him.|$|E

[...] That same year Eagles drummer Don Henley {{released}} the single [...] "All She Wants to Do Is Dance" [...] in protest against the U.S. involvement with the Contras in Nicaragua. In the song he chastised people for wanting to dance while sales of guns and drugs were {{going on at the}} behest of the CIA. [...] Henley would later sing about Regan as [...] "this tired old man that we elected king" [...] in a parting shot <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> as he was leaving office in 1989's [...] "The End of the Innocence". [...] Among 1984's other songs protesting the Reagan administration's role in the Iran-Contra affair were [...] "Nicaragua" [...] by Bruce Cockburn, [...] "Lives in the Balance" [...] by Jackson Browne. [...] "Please Forgive Us" [...] by 10,000 Maniacs, and [...] "Untitled Song for Latin America" [...] by [...] Minutemen.|$|E

500|$|On May 1 at 1:22p.m., Panetta, {{acting on}} the president's orders, {{directed}} McRaven {{to move forward with}} the operation. Shortly after 3p.m., the president joined national security officials in the Situation Room to monitor the raid. They watched night-vision images taken from a Sentinel drone while Panetta, appearing {{in a corner of the}} screen from CIA headquarters, narrated what was happening. Video links with Panetta at CIA headquarters and McRaven in Afghanistan were set up in the Situation Room. In an adjoining office was the live drone feed presented on a laptop computer operated by Brigadier General Marshall Webb, assistant commander of JSOC. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was one of those in the Situation Room, and described it like this: [...] "Contrary to some news reports and what you see in the movies, we had no means to see what was happening inside the building itself. All we could do was wait for an update from the team on the ground. I looked <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>President.</b> He was calm. Rarely have I been prouder to serve by his side as I was that day." [...] Two other command centers monitored the raid from the Pentagon and the American embassy in Islamabad.|$|E
500|$|At 2:27p.m., Reagan {{exited the}} hotel through [...] "President's Walk" [...] and its T Street NW exit toward his waiting {{limousine}} as Hinckley waited within {{the crowd of}} admirers. The Secret Service had extensively screened those attending the president's speech. In a [...] "colossal mistake", the agency allowed an unscreened group to stand within [...] of him, behind a rope line. Unexpectedly, Reagan passed {{right in front of}} Hinckley. Believing he would never get a better chance, Hinckley fired a Röhm RG-14 [...]22LR blue steel revolver six times in 1.7 seconds, missing the president with all six shots. The first bullet hit White House Press Secretary James Brady in the head and the second hit District of Columbia police officer Thomas Delahanty {{in the back of his}} neck as he turned to protect Reagan. Hinckley now had a clear shot <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>president,</b> but the third bullet overshot him and hit the window of a building across the street. As Special Agent In Charge Jerry Parr quickly pushed Reagan into the limousine, the fourth bullet hit Secret Service agent Tim McCarthy in the abdomen as he spread his body over Reagan to make himself a target. The fifth bullet hit the bullet-resistant glass of the window on the open side door of the limousine. The sixth and final bullet ricocheted off the armored side of the limousine and hit the president in the left underarm, grazing a rib and lodging in his lung, causing it to partially collapse, and stopping less than an inch (25mm) from his heart. [...] Parr's prompt reaction had saved Reagan from being hit in the head.|$|E
2500|$|The popular {{impression}} of George W. Bush's intellect, fed by his frequent grammatical errors in speeches, allowed the Capitol Steps to reuse much Dan Quayle material. After {{the events of}} September 11, 2001, jokes aimed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> or [...] American politics no longer seemed appropriate to the general public. The group cancelled most of their performances {{for the next several}} weeks, performing an edited show at a nightclub on September 15. It was successful, and they soon found new material that people would find funny in October 2001. The group poked fun at the improved national view of Bush and at figures who were becoming more relevant to the American public, including New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, British Prime Minister Tony Blair, and French President Jacques Chirac.|$|E

I must again be permitted to remind him, that although my ipse dixit may not be as great as his, yet it somewhat reduces the force of his calling my attention to the enormity of my making a like charge against him.|$|E

60|$|Even in {{the close}} and abrupt {{juxtaposition}} of the ludicrous and the horrible this held good. Ned Sinton had scarcely parted from his hilarious shipmate, {{when he was}} attracted by shouts, as if of men quarrelling, in a gaming-house; and, a few moments later, the report of a pistol was heard, followed by a sharp cry of agony. Rushing into the house, and forcing {{his way through the}} crowd, he reached the table {{in time to see the}} bloody corpse of a man carried out. This unfortunate had repeatedly lost large sums of money, and, growing desperate, staked his all on a final chance. He lost; and, drawing his bowie-knife, in the heat of despair, rushed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> of the table. A dozen arms arrested him, and rendered his intended assault abortive; nevertheless, the president coolly drew a revolver from under the cloth, and shot him dead. For a few minutes there was some attempt at disturbance, and some condemned, while others justified the act. But the body was removed, and soon the game went on again as if nothing had occurred.|$|E
