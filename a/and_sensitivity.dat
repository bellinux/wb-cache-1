40|$|Eating expectancies are {{proposed}} as cognitive pathways linking reinforcement (reward <b>and</b> punishment) <b>sensitivities</b> <b>and</b> {{the tendency to}} over-eat in response to appetitive and emotional cues. In Study One (N = 243 university women) explicit eating expectancies were tested as potential mediators of reinforcement <b>sensitivities</b> <b>and</b> eating styles. Broadly, expectancies that eating alleviates negative affect/boredom mediated both reward <b>and</b> punishment <b>sensitivity</b> <b>and</b> emotional eating. The expectancy that eating is pleasurable and rewarding mediated reward <b>sensitivity</b> <b>and</b> external eating. In Study Two (N = 109), using an implicit eating expectancy task, reward <b>sensitivity</b> <b>and</b> external eating was mediated via positive expectancy statements, notably, that eating is pleasurable <b>and</b> rewarding.

5|$|Teleosts {{have four}} major life stages: the egg, the larva, the {{juvenile}} and the adult. Species may begin {{life in a}} pelagic environment or a demersal environment (near the seabed). Most marine teleosts have pelagic eggs, which are light, transparent and buoyant with thin envelopes. Pelagic eggs rely on the ocean currents to disperse and receive no parental care. When they hatch, the larvae are planktonic and unable to swim. They have a yolk sac attached to them which provides nutrients. Most freshwater species produce demersal eggs which are thick, pigmented, relatively heavy and able to stick to substrates. Parental care is much more common among freshwater fish. Unlike their pelagic counterparts, demersal larvae are able to swim and feed {{as soon as they}} hatch. Larval teleosts often look very different from adults, particularly in marine species. Some larvae were even considered different species from the adults. Larvae have high mortality rates, most die from starvation or predation within their first week. As they grow, survival rates increase and there is greater physiological tolerance <b>and</b> <b>sensitivity,</b> ecological and behavioural competence.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a {{transform}} method to compute the prices and greeks of barrier options driven by a class of Levy processes. We derive analytical expressions for the Laplace transforms in time of the prices <b>and</b> <b>sensitivities</b> of single barrier options in an exponential Levy model with hyper-exponential jumps. Inversion of these single Laplace transform yields rapid, accurate results. These results are employed to construct an approximation of the prices <b>and</b> <b>sensitivities</b> of barrier options in exponential generalised hyper-exponential (GHE) Levy models. The latter class includes many of the Levy models employed in quantitative finance such as the variance gamma (VG), KoBoL, generalised hyperbolic, and the normal inverse Gaussian (NIG) models. Convergence of the approximating prices <b>and</b> <b>sensitivities</b> is proved. To provide a numerical illustration, this transform approach is compared with Monte Carlo simulation in the cases that the driving process is a VG and a NIG Levy process.

5|$|The {{habitat of}} the Mediterranean monk seal {{has changed over}} the years. Prior to the 20th century, Mediterranean monk seals had been known to congregate, give birth, and seek refuge on open beaches. Since sealing had ended, they have left their former habitat and now only use sea caves for such behavior. More often than not, these caves are rather {{inaccessible}} to humans due to underwater entries, and because the caves are often along remote or rugged coastlines. Scientists have confirmed this is a recent adaptation, most likely due to the rapid increase in human population, tourism, and industry, which have caused increased disturbance by humans and the destruction of the species' natural habitat. Because of these seals' shy nature <b>and</b> <b>sensitivity</b> to human disturbance, they have slowly adapted to try to avoid contact with humans completely within the last century, and, perhaps, even earlier. The coastal caves are, however, dangerous for newborns, and are causes of major mortality among pups when sea storms hit the caves.|$|E

Scientific research of related child factors contributes to optimization of prevention and treatment of DBDs and psychopathic traits.

Current research aims to investigate the exact reflection of reward <b>and</b> punishment <b>sensitivity</b> <b>and</b> response perseveration in boys with DBDs and psychopathic traits. In current correlational Dutch research, 84 boys between 8 and 12 years from clinical centers, regular and special education have been studied. Both surveys – Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children-Parent version, Youth Psychopathic traits Inventory-Child Version and Antisocial Processing Screening Device-Parent Form – and assessments for measuring cognitive abilities – Hungry Donkey Task and Door Opening Task – have been used. Results suggest a very large effect of DBDs on psychopathic traits measured by parent reports. No effects on reward <b>and</b> punishment <b>sensitivity</b> <b>and</b> response perseveration have been found between the DBD group and the control group. Psychopathic traits neither correlate with reward <b>and</b> punishment <b>sensitivity</b> <b>and</b> response perseveration, nor moderate reward <b>and</b> punishment <b>sensitivity</b> <b>and</b> response perseveration in the DBD group. In conclusion, boys with DBDs show – according to parents – more disturbances in interpersonal, affective and behavioral responses compared to the control group.
