40|$|In this paper, two {{essential}} {{problems that}} belong to language parsing and have arisen from dialogue management are discussed and solved by implementing {{a variant of the}} well-known context-free parsing algorithm [1]. The first problem is the use of partly specified patterns, i. e., the use of wildcards in the right-hand-sides of the rewriting rules of a context-free grammar. The second one is the use of priority patterns, i. e., the <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>priority</b> values to rewriting rules. These problems are not handled in the majority of the state-of-the-art dialogue systems. The proposed algorithm has been implemented in a dialogue system core application called CAML Core [7], that is used to implement dialogue systems in several domains like conversational and multimodal interfaces for help desk applications, and chat bots...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a system for}} &quot;remembering&quot; a story or passage in English and for the subsequent retrieval of responses to questions. Although it functions as an information retrieval system, it is also intended {{as a model for}} long-term human memory. Information is stored in the form of predicates and property lists. In translating from natural language, the system carries out a transformational analysis of each sentence and identifies its deep structure interpretation. This grammatical analysis is essential to the identification of the predicates as well as relationships among them. The first two subsystems carry out the grammatical analysis. A third identifies the predicates and property lists, determines a time and priority structure, forms a logical map of relationships among predicates, and eliminates some predicates based on an <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>priority.</b> The fourth subsystem is used to answer inquiries about the stored information.

In this paper, a {{technique}} is proposed for movement of Emergency Vehicles that is Fire brigade and Ambulances in least time. The objective is to direct Fire brigades and Ambulances from source to Destination point in most efficient and effective time. Movement of these vehicles should be safe and vehicles should follow shortest path. The proposed method can help in selecting Emergency Vehicles from n-number of available Emergency Vehicles, Directing the shortest safest and least crowded path for the vehicles so that it can reach the accident point in least time. To make the movement of vehicles efficient, all traffic control signals should guide traffic to move in favour of clearing the emergency vehicle‟s route. Check condition are made for assigning priority to emergency vehicles and higher priority emergency vehicles are facilitated first at a particular traffic control signal, if more than one vehicles waiting on a traffic square.

Principle priority categories were assigned in the following order: food quality, nutrition, food packaging, menu acceptance, meal preparation efficiency, total system weight, total system volume, and total power requirements. Hence, the galley was designed using an 'inside-out' approach which first considered the food and related biological functions and subsequently proceeded 'outward' from the food to encompass supporting hardware. The resulting galley is an optimal design incorporating appropriate priorities for trade-offs between biological and engineering constraints. This design approach is offered {{as a model for}} the design of life support systems...|$|R
40|$|In Linux, {{real-time}} {{tasks are}} supported by separating real-time task priorities from non-real-time task priorities. However, this separation <b>of</b> <b>priority</b> ranges may not be effective when real-time tasks make the system calls that are {{taken care of by}} the kernel threads. Thus, Linux is considered a soft real-time system. Moreover, kernel threads are configured to have static priorities for throughputs. The static <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>priorities</b> to kernel threads causes trouble for real-time tasks when real-time tasks require kernel threads to be invoked to handle the system calls because kernel threads do not discriminate between real-time and non-real-time tasks. We present a dynamic kernel thread scheduling mechanism with weighted average priority inheritance protocol (PIP), a variation of the PIP. The scheduling algorithm assigns proper priorities to kernel threads at runtime by monitoring the activities of user-level real-time tasks. Experimental results show that the algorithms can greatly improve the unexpected execution latency of real-time tasks...|$|R
40|$|Abstract 1 The <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> {{scheduling}} parameters {{under the}} Earliest Deadline First (EDF) scheduling policy is trivial in single processor systems because deadlines are used directly. However, {{it is still}} {{difficult to find a}} feasible deadline assignment for EDF distributed systems when the utilization levels of the CPUs and communication networks are pushed near to their limits. Most distributed applications specify end-to-end deadlines for each transaction and there are no individual deadlines assigned to their tasks or messages. This paper presents a new heuristic algorithm, called HOS-DA (Heuristic Optimized Scheduling Deadline Assignment), for optimizing the <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> deadlines to tasks and messages in distributed hard real-time systems. The algorithm is based on HOPA (Heuristic Optimized Priority Assignment), a previous method for the <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>priorities</b> in fixed priority distributed systems. The results of the proposed algorithm are compared with two other algorithms that exist for solving the same problem, and show that a utilization increase of up to 18 % is possible.

40|$|Exact response-time {{calculation}} for cyclical tasks with fixed priorities {{requires that}} equations involving ceilings are solved. These equations are usually solved iteratively. For simple response-time problems with fixed priorities the iterations {{are guaranteed to}} converge {{if there is a}} solution. For more complex cases, however, like scheduling of real-time tasks in distributed systems, the iterative method does not always provide the best solution, in particular if the combined response-time/optimal priority assignment problem is considered. We show how to reformulate equations with ceilings into integer linear programming problems, which can be solved with known optimization methods. This reformulation is directly applicable to classical exact response-time calculation. We also show how optimal <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>priorities</b> can be incorporated in the model, which turns the optimization problem into a bilinear integer programming problem. A possible application is holistic scheduling with optimal priority assignments in distributed real-time systems. 1...|$|R

Results show that high-quality paths can be produced in less than a second of computation time, even in confined environments involving many robots.

Inconsistencies may arise for different reasons, for example, when multiple conflicting viewpoints are embodied in the specification, or when the specification itself is at a transient stage of evolution. These inconsistencies cannot always be resolved immediately. As a result, we argue that a formal framework {{for the analysis of}} evolving specifications should be able to tolerate inconsistency by allowing reasoning in the presence of inconsistency without trivialisation, and circumvent inconsistency by enabling impact analyses of potential changes to be carried out. This paper shows how clustered belief revision can help in this process. Clustered belief revision allows for the grouping of requirements with similar functionality into clusters and the <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>priorities</b> between them.

40|$|There is a {{mismatch}} between the properties required from priority driven realtime {{systems and the}} property required for mutual exclusion. A priority scheduled real-time system must ensure that the highest priority runnable task can start to run in a bounded time — and the bound needs to be small.

These two constraints can easily conflict causing priority inversion — a scheduled task that is waiting for a lower priority task. The classical nightmare case here is when a low priority task owns a resource, a high priority task is blocked waiting for the resource, and intermediate priority tasks keep preempting the low priority task so it cannot make progress towards releasing the resource.
