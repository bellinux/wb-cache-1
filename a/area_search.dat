5|$|A gas {{explosion}} {{in a residential}} area of Rosario, the third-largest city in Argentina, occurred on August 6, 2013. It {{was caused by a}} large gas leak; a nearby building collapsed, and others were at high risk of structural failure. Twenty-two people died, and sixty were injured. Several organizations helped secure the <b>area,</b> <b>search</b> for survivors and aid people who lost their homes. Shortly after the explosion, the time needed for reconstruction was estimated at six months.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to being the initial bomb group to enter the Korean War, the 19th Bombardment Group had an exclusive experimental weapon, a radio-guided bomb called the VB-13 Tarzon Bomb. This huge 12,000-pound bomb required special conditioning to the underside of three B-29s, {{one of which was}} lost carrying Colonel Jennings and his crew on March 29, 1951. Apparently his B-29, #1749, lost two engines in an attempt to salvo the Tarzon Bomb at a very low altitude over the ocean, resulting in a premature detonation that took their aircraft down. After a full-scale <b>area</b> <b>search,</b> no trace of the B-29 or those on board was found, and the search was suspended on April 7, 1951. He received the Legion of Merit for his work with the Tarzon bomb program.|$|E

500|$|At 08:30 on 12 May, {{the three}} B-17s {{had begun to}} taxi in a rain squall when a morning {{position}} report from Rex was relayed to LeMay. It indicated that the liner was then [...] from New York, farther east than his original computations had placed it. LeMay's original flight plan had incorporated an <b>area</b> <b>search</b> if necessary, but weather conditions and the ship's distance from Long Island precluded that possibility.|$|E
500|$|Six sonar targets {{with similar}} {{dimensions}} to Centaur were located between 15 and 18 December: as {{none of the}} contacts corresponded completely to the hospital ship, the search team opted {{to take advantage of}} favourable weather conditions and continue investigating the area before returning to each site and making a detailed inspection with a higher-resolution sonar. On the afternoon of 18 December, the sonar towfish separated from the cable, and was lost in [...] of water, forcing the use of the high-resolution sonar to complete the <b>area</b> <b>search.</b> After inspecting the potential targets, Mearns and the search team announced on 20 December that they had found Centaur that morning.|$|E
500|$|In late June 2014, {{details of}} {{the next phase of}} the search were announced; {{officials}} have called this phase the [...] "underwater search", despite the previous seafloor sonar survey. Continued refinement of analysis of Flight 370's satellite communications identified a [...] "wide area search" [...] along the arc where Flight 370 was located when it last communicated with the satellite. The priority search area within the wide <b>area</b> <b>search</b> is in its southern extent. Some of the equipment to be used for the underwater search operates best when towed [...] above the seafloor {{at the end of a}} [...] cable. Available bathymetric data for this region was of poor resolution, thus necessitating a bathymetric survey of the search area before the underwater phase began. Commencing in May, the bathymetric survey charted around [...] of seafloor through 17 December 2014, when it was suspended for the ship conducting the survey to be mobilised in the underwater search.|$|E

40|$|We {{assessed}} {{the influence of}} sampling biases on estimates of absolute density. Using <b>area</b> <b>searches</b> for birds on 1 -ha plots, we showed that time of day, weather and vegetation density (logged v. unlogged forest) had no {{significant impact on the}} detection rates of birds. As a consequence these environmental variables did not affect estimates of total bird density or species richness. Amount of cloud cover was positively correlated with abundance of three species (white-browed scrubwren, inland thornbill and white-naped honeyeater) but negatively correlated with counts of the western gerygone. Radio-tracking of western yellow robins showed that about half of all birds present on a plot were detected during <b>area</b> <b>searches.</b> However, robins moved over an area twice as large as the plot searched. These errors compensate to give an accurate estimate of density for this species. Collectively, these results indicate that <b>area</b> <b>searches</b> give a reliable estimate of density in both logged and unlogged eucalypt forest...|$|R

2500|$|The Squadron {{was also}} {{occupied}} with route and mine clearance. The SADF laid recognised, marked and fenced, anti-personnel minefields typically as perimeter protection to bases and vital assets. The SADF reported laying 45,000 mines during {{the conflict of}} which 3,000 were unaccounted for when UNTAG arrived. SWAPO employed mines {{as a means of}} ambushing or intimidation. Much of the work of the 75 Field Engineers deployed with each contingent was <b>area</b> <b>search,</b> clearance of exposed mines, marking minefields and route clearance. Colonel John Crocker, the Commander of the 2nd Contingent wrote that [...] "For {{the first time since the}} Vietnam War, Australian Sappers hand cleared their way into live minefields on seven separate occasions to destroy exposed mines. Similar mines killed several civilians and many animals during the mission. Field engineers of the contingent destroyed over 5,000 items of unexploded ordnance (UXO) ranging from artillery shells, through RPG rockets to grenades. UXO, a legacy of the 20-year Bush War, posed a major hazard to local inhabitants in the northern provinces and to UNTAG personnel in that area".|$|E

30|$|In this subsection, a {{rectangle}} restricted <b>area</b> <b>searching</b> method [13] {{is used to}} efficiently find the optimal route in large-scale VANETs. Taking positions of source and destination nodes as the foci and the line connecting them as the axis, an ellipse could be formed. Correspondingly, the rectangle, i.e., the restricted <b>searching</b> <b>area,</b> can be plotted by bounding the ellipse. In this way, each intersection involved in the routed path could be determined whether it is {{in or out of}} the rectangle <b>area.</b> Through <b>searching</b> <b>area</b> restriction, the routing overhead will be greatly reduced which is essential to the delay control and packet collision release. The rectangle restriction algorithm is described as follows.|$|R
40|$|No {{studies have}} {{examined}} differences between census methods for birds in south-western Australian forests, yet unique features of south-western forests {{may be responsible for}} differences from those recorded in studies conducted elsewhere. Differences in the number of bird species recorded and densities estimated by <b>area</b> <b>searches,</b> line transects and point counts in jarrah forests of south-western Australian were examined. All three methods detected a similar number of species but <b>area</b> <b>searches</b> higher estimates of overall bird density. This difference probably occurred because are searches were conducted {{for a longer period of}} time and detected more cryptic birds in a given area that the other two methods. These results were similar to studies conducted in eucalypt forests on south-eastern Australia and in non-forest habitats in western Australia, suggesting that differences between the three methods were consistent across different habitats and regions in Australia. However, density estimates should not be compared directly between studies using <b>area</b> <b>searches</b> and either line transects or point counts, even if the censuses are conducted for the same length of time...|$|R

30|$|It may be {{the case}} that the ‘S’-shaped {{strategy}} {{is a function of the}} shape and <b>area</b> of the <b>search</b> region. While the 75  m 2 <b>search</b> <b>area</b> was much larger than that typically used in visual search studies, it was still a regular rectangle and defined in a manner that allowed planning (i.e. could be seen as one and defined by cones). Further studies should explore how search strategy is influenced by the regularity, shape, and size of the <b>search</b> <b>area.</b> In addition, the manner with which the <b>search</b> <b>area</b> is defined by landmarks that remain visible from all points of the <b>search</b> <b>area</b> may be important.
