5|$|Crohn's {{disease is}} a type of {{inflammatory}} bowel disease (IBD) that may affect <b>any</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gastrointestinal tract from mouth to anus.

Other complications may occur outside the gastrointestinal tract and include anemia, skin rashes, arthritis, inflammation of the eye, and tiredness. The skin rashes may be due to infections as well as pyoderma gangrenosum or erythema nodosum. Bowel obstruction also commonly occurs and those with the disease are at greater risk of bowel cancer.|$|E

5|$|Freedom {{to reside}} and settle in <b>any</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{territory}} of India, subject to reasonable restrictions by the State {{in the interest}} of the general public or for the protection of the scheduled tribes because certain safeguards as are envisaged here seem to be justified to protect indigenous and tribal peoples from exploitation and coercion.

The umpire's decision will depend on a number of criteria, including where the ball pitched, whether the ball hit in line with the wickets, and whether the batsman was attempting to hit the ball.|$|E

5|$|The {{high-pressure}} injection {{leads to}} a quick fill of the die, which is required so the entire cavity fills before <b>any</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> casting solidifies. In this way, discontinuities are avoided, even if the shape requires difficult-to-fill thin sections. This creates the problem of air entrapment, because when the mold is filled quickly there is little time for the air to escape. This problem is minimized by including vents along the parting lines, however, even in a highly refined process {{there will still be}} some porosity {{in the center of the}} casting.|$|E
