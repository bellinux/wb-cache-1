5|$|The {{theory that}} the Sun is the center <b>around</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> planets orbit was first {{proposed}} by the ancient Greek Aristarchus of Samos in the 3rd century BC, and later adopted by Seleucus of Seleucia (see Heliocentrism). This view was developed in a more detailed mathematical model of a heliocentric system in the 16th century by Nicolaus Copernicus.|$|E
5|$|During the Carboniferous period (359–299 Ma), Scotland lay {{close to}} the equator. Several changes in sea level {{occurred}} and the coal deposits of Lanarkshire and West Lothian and limestones of Fife and Dunbar date from this time. There are oil shales near Bathgate <b>around</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> 19th-century oil-processing industry developed, {{and elsewhere in the}} Midland Valley there are ironstones and fire clay deposits that had significance in the early Industrial Revolution. Fossil Grove in Victoria Park, Glasgow contains the preserved remains of a Carboniferous forest. More volcanic activity formed Arthur's Seat and the Salisbury Crags in Edinburgh and the nearby Bathgate Hills.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, Saran {{appeared}} in Rowthiram, {{where she worked}} with Tamil actor Jeeva for the first time. The film received fairly low reviews. Although some reviews said that Saran was not given much opportunity to show her acting skills, mainly just adding a romantic touch to a mostly violent film, she was referred to by another as the pivot <b>around</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> film revolves. Her performance earned her Best Actress Award at the International Tamil Film Awards. Her only other film in 2011 was a special appearance in a song for the Tamil film Rajapattai.|$|E

5|$|The Polish Legions serving {{alongside}} the French Army during the Napoleonic Wars saw combat {{in most of}} Napoleon's campaigns, from the West Indies, through Italy and Egypt. When the Duchy of Warsaw was created in 1807, many of the veterans of the Legions formed a core <b>around</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> Duchy's army was raised under Józef Poniatowski. This force fought a victorious war against Austria in 1809 and {{would go on to}} fight {{alongside the}} French army in numerous campaigns, culminating in the disastrous invasion of Russia in 1812, which marked the end of the Napoleonic empire, including the Legions, and allied states like the Duchy of Warsaw.|$|E
5|$|Traditional {{street names}} {{are not used}} in the development. The main {{thoroughfares}} are styled blue, white, pink, yellow, orange, purple and green where street furniture and coloured ambient lighting will be colour-coded to match. A stylised map of the site has been devised. Landscape architects, Gillespies regenerated the brownfield site to create public spaces. The focal point is a piazza and landscaped park, which stretches to the ship canal <b>around</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> buildings are located. The piazza's two distinct areas, The Green and The Stage are capable of holding events for up to 6500 people. In front of The Studios there is a free-standing big screen, which is viewable from the piazza.|$|E
5|$|As with Hergé's two {{previous}} stories, The Secret of the Unicorn and Red Rackham's Treasure, The Seven Crystal Balls {{was designed as}} part of a twofold story arc, to be concluded with the then yet unnamed Prisoners of the Sun. Hergé planned for the former story to outline a mystery, while the latter would see his characters undertake an expedition to solve it. His use of an ancient mummy's curse <b>around</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> narrative revolved was inspired by tales of a curse of the pharaohs which had been unearthed during the archaeologist Howard Carter's 1922 discovery of Pharaoh Tutankhamun's tomb. This {{was not the first time}} that Hergé had been inspired by this tabloid story, having previously done so when authoring Cigars of the Pharaoh.|$|E

5|$|Originally {{designated}} {{simply as}} Training Battalion, {{it was under}} the command of Major Francis Voelcker. The battalion was based at Samambula Camp where it would undergo training for the next several months. In May 1941, the bulk of the battalion's personnel returned to New Zealand and onwards to the Middle East to join the 2nd New Zealand Division. Fourteen soldiers volunteered for duty as coast watchers in the Gilbert and Ellice Islands and consequently left the battalion. Some others, including Voelcker who had been promoted to lieutenant colonel, remained in Fiji to form the cadre <b>around</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> battalion was to be reformed with newly arrived personnel. The battalion, now known as Reserve Battalion, resumed training and garrison duty. Many personnel had only received minimal military training in New Zealand before being shipped to Fiji and much time had to be spent on the basics of warfare and tactics.|$|E
5|$|The ballad, The Mermaid of Padstow, tells {{a similar}} story of a local named Tom Yeo, who shot the mermaid mistaking her for a seal. John Betjeman, who was well-acquainted with the area, wrote in 1969 that the mermaid met a local man {{and fell in love}} with him. When she could no longer bear living without him, she tried to lure him beneath the waves but he escaped by {{shooting}} her. In her rage she threw a handful of sand towards Padstow, <b>around</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> sandbank grew. In other versions of the tale, the mermaid sings from the rocks and a youth shoots at her with a crossbow, or a greedy man shoots her with a longbow. Mermaids were believed to sing to their victims so that they can lure adulterers to their death.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} programme {{moved to the}} University of Exeter in 1982, where the C1 chassis was fitted with fibreglass shells and tested in a wind tunnel. It was recognised {{at an early stage}} that the vehicle would have to be aerodynamic; although it was only ever intended to be small and relatively slow, reducing wind resistance was seen as essential for the vehicle's efficiency. By March 1982 the basic design of the C1 had been established. Sinclair then turned to an established motor design company, Ogle Design of Letchworth, to provide professional styling assistance and production engineering. However, Ogle's approach was not to Sinclair's liking; they tackled the project as one of car design and focused more (and expensively) on the aerodynamics rather than the cycle technology <b>around</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> C1 was based. The weight of the vehicle increased to over , far more than Sinclair's desired specification. By March 1983, Sinclair and Wood Rogers had decided to stop the C1 programme. Wood Rogers comments that Ogle were convinced that the C1 would be a flop, telling Sinclair {{that it would not be}} fast enough, that its drivers would get wet when it rained and that the battery was not good enough.|$|E

5000|$|The first {{element to}} appear was {{the church with}} its square, <b>which</b> <b>the</b> Portuguese tried to {{reproduce}} according to the European model. This was the main activity generator <b>around</b> <b>which</b> all <b>the</b> other subsequent functions appeared.|$|R
5|$|The {{historian}} Walter Goffart {{argues that}} Bede based {{the structure of}} the Historia on three works, using them as the framework <b>around</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> three main sections of the work were structured. For {{the early part of the}} work, up until the Gregorian mission, Goffart feels that Bede used Gildas's De excidio. The second section, detailing the Gregorian mission of Augustine of Canterbury was framed on the anonymous Life of Gregory the Great written at Whitby. The last section, detailing events after the Gregorian mission, Goffart feels were modelled on Stephen of Ripon's Life of Wilfrid. Most of Bede's informants for information after Augustine's mission came from the eastern part of Britain, leaving significant gaps in the knowledge of the western areas, which were those areas likely to have a native Briton presence.|$|E
5|$|The palace is a {{blend of}} {{architectural}} styles; its ancient origins are indicated by a lack of symmetry. Thus to evaluate the architecture, wings and blocks have to be observed separately. The principal façade appears as a terrace of Renaissance style palazzi from differing periods of the Renaissance era (Illustrations 1 and 12) which—even though they form only one palace—is exactly what they are. These wings are however united by their common rusticated ground floor. This Renaissance architecture seems to mask earlier fortifications, the towers of which rise behind the differing classical façades. These towers—many complete with crenellations and machicolations—were actually mostly rebuilt during the 19th century. At the rear of the palace the original medieval fortifications seem untouched by time. (Illustration 4). A greater architectural harmony has been achieved within the court of honour <b>around</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> palace is built, where two tiers of frescoed open arcades serve as both a ceremonial balcony for the prince's appearances and a state entrance and corridor linking the formal state rooms of the palace.|$|E
25|$|In 987, Archbishop Egbert of Trier consecrated five altars in the Church of the Redemption (today St. Michael's Church). At a Roman road {{intersection}} near the church, a marketplace appeared <b>around</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> city developed.|$|E

50|$|Two {{different}} {{sites for}} drug interaction have been proposed. One is a lipid-facing pocket between 2 adjacent transmembrane helices (<b>around</b> Asp-44), at <b>which</b> <b>the</b> drug binds and inhibits proton conductance allosterically. The other {{is inside the}} pore (<b>around</b> Ser-31), at <b>which</b> <b>the</b> drug directly blocks proton passage.|$|R
