The vibration isolator was invented to reduce the effect from vibrations. However, the behavior <b>of</b> <b>rubber</b> material, which many vibration isolators are made of, is hard to predict. Consequently, vibration tests are needed to obtain the dynamic properties <b>of</b> <b>rubber</b> isolator. In this case, a six-year old LORD 2204 - 5 rubber isolator provided by Atlas Copco was tested.

Moreover, the influence <b>of</b> <b>aging</b> <b>of</b> <b>rubber</b> material on the dynamic properties was studied. As the vibration test should simulate the working environment of the isolators that are both a static load from the structure and a dynamic force from the engine, a new excitation method was designed. The camshaft with the shape of an epitrochoid induced the sinusoidal signal of the isolator and the frame transferred the static load from the hydraulic machine. The artificial aging was performed in a hot air oven in 90 °C for 42 hours, which according to Arrhenius equation should be equivalent to six years <b>of</b> natural <b>aging.</b> The vibration isolator was tested again after being aged.

40|$|Elastomers are {{the most}} {{commonly}} used materials for various sealing applications owing to their low modulus of elasticity, large elongation-at-break, and high Poisson's ratio. Most seals operate in the presence of lubricants; therefore the sealing elastomeroil interaction {{plays an important role in}} determining the tribological performance of elastomers. Furthermore, at times, such as starting up periods, the seals may also operate under dry condition and the seal material can be affected by high friction coefficient and wear. In this work, the tribological behaviour of different sealing elastomers has been studied. The influence <b>of</b> <b>ageing</b> <b>of</b> a sealing elastomer in different lubricants on its tribological behaviour has been investigated. Further studies pertaining to the influence of lubrication on the abrasive wear of a sealing elastomer have also been carried out. The results show that the friction coefficient of an elastomer in lubricated sliding against a hard counterface, at low contact pressure, depends on the surface topography of the elastomer but at high contact pressure, it is mainly due to the viscoelastic deformations <b>of</b> the <b>rubber</b> by the counterface surface asperities. (Even if the hard surface appears smooth to the naked eye, it may exhibit short-wavelength roughness, which may make the dominant contribution to <b>rubber</b> friction). <b>Ageing</b> <b>of</b> the nitrile <b>rubber</b> in ester base fluids leads to reduction of friction coefficient. In unidirectional dry sliding of an elastomer against a counterface, the friction coefficient decreases during the running-in period. The longest running-in periods have been observed when the elastomers slide against relatively smooth surfaces. Depending on the elastomer-lubricant compatibility, abrasive coarseness, geometry of sliding contact area and contact pressure, the two body abrasive wear of elastomers may increase or decrease in presence <b>of</b> lubricants. <b>Aging</b> <b>of</b> nitrile <b>rubber</b> in lubricating fluids increases the abrasive wear both in dry and lubricated conditions.

Chemical structure of produced lignin samples was identified with Furior Transform Infra Red spectrometer (FTIR). Analysis of FTIR spectra showed good' conformity of all wave numbers at which specified peaks of experimented and reference lignin samples were observed. Acidolysis of sawdust with 10 M hydrochloric acid was found the most efficient for lignin extraction. This lignin was proceeded as a filler for <b>rubber</b> compounds. Properties <b>of</b> <b>rubber</b> compounds extended with produced lignin samples were determined. The test results showed that lignin was capable to improve properties <b>of</b> <b>rubber</b> compounds to the level achieved with carbon black and imported lignin filler samples, as well as resistance <b>of</b> <b>rubber</b> to prolong heat aging. An attempt was made to synthesize commercial antioxidants for rubber from extracted lignin sample. Methodology was developed and performed. Synthesized products were 2, 4, 6 three-tert-butyl phenol and 2, 6 di-tert butyl paracresol. Alcoholic and methoxyl groups present earlier in extracted lignin samples were replaced with methyl and tertiary butyl groups. These groups are particularly capable to donate hydrogen to an alkyl peroxy radical. The effects of substituent groups in the transition state involved not only electron transfer to the peroxy radical but electron delocalization in the aromatic ring. So synthesized products were expected to act as effective antioxidants in rubber compounds. Rubber compounds with experimented antioxidants were prepared and their properties carefully investigated. Test results showed excellent resistance <b>of</b> <b>rubber</b> compounds to heat aging, that proved with high level of confidence antioxidation activity of synthesized products. The {{aim of this}} work was related to development of economically viable method of extraction of lignin from sawdust in order to produce additive capable to improve physical mechanical and <b>aging</b> properties <b>of</b> <b>rubber</b> compounds.

40|$|The process <b>of</b> <b>ageing</b> in <b>rubbers</b> {{requires}} monitoring {{over long}} periods (days to years). To do so in non-conducting <b>rubbers,</b> small amounts <b>of</b> carbon-black particles were dispersed in a fractal network through the rubber matrix, to make the rubber conducting without modifying its properties. Continuous monitoring of the resistance reveals the structural changes around the glass and melting transitions and especially details about the hysteresis and ageing processes. We illustrate the method for the semicrystalline polymer poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A novel rubber bound {{antioxidant}} NR-g-HPM {{was prepared}} by melt grafting HPM (N-(4 -hydroxyphenyl) maleimide) onto natural rubber in a brabender plasticorder. HPM was synthesized from p-aminophenol and maleic anhydride. The yield {{was found to}} be over 80 %. The grafting products were observed with FTIR spectroscopy and TGA. The <b>ageing</b> resistance <b>of</b> natural <b>rubber</b> vulcanizates using NR-g-HPM was studied. It was found that an optimal amount of NR-g-HPM (6 phr) gave about 25 % better tensile strength and elongation at break as compared with conventional BHT addition, for filled natural rubber after 48 h <b>of</b> accelerated <b>aging...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} {{represent}} the chemical <b>ageing</b> behaviour <b>of</b> <b>rubber</b> under finite deformations a three-dimensional theory is proposed. The fundamentals of this approach are different decompositions of the deformation gradient in combination with an additive split of the Helmholtz free energy into three parts. Its first part belongs to the volumetric material behaviour. The second part is a temperature-dependent hyperelasticity model which depends on an additional internal variable to consider the long-term degradation <b>of</b> the primary <b>rubber</b> network. The third contribution is a functional of the deformation history and a further internal variable; it describes {{the creation of a}} new network which remains free of stress when the deformation is constant in time. The constitutive relations for the stress tensor and the internal variables are deduced using the Clausius–Duhem inequality. In order to sketch the main properties of the model, expressions in closed form are derived with respect to continuous and intermittent relaxation tests as well as for the compression set test. Under the assumption of near incompressible material behaviour, the theory can also represent ageing-induced changes in volume and their effect on the stress relaxation. The simulations are in accordance with experimental data from literature...|$|R
40|$|Production, {{consumption}} and investment activities <b>of</b> smallholder <b>rubber</b> farmers in government planned resettlement schemes were examined {{to gain a}} good understanding of problems and successes in these projects. The study area was located in Aceh province of Sumatra Island, Indonesia. Each farmer was provided 2 hectares for plantation, 0. 75 hectare for food crops and 0. 25 hectare for household area. Sampling was satisfied based on <b>age</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rubber</b> trees held by smallholders. Eight groups were defined based on planting dates from 1977 - 78 through 1986 - 87, excluding 1984 - 85 and 1985 - 86, when no clones were planted. Each group was sampled for data on family characteristics, labor allocation, income and expenditures. The complex interactions between farm families and agricultural production environment were highlighted. High income and expenditure variations within groups same planting dates were found due to the number of trees a family received, and the systematic investment and production behavior of family households. The distance to food crop land and presence of wild animals were some of the constraints in optimal use of resources. A more detail and careful examination i...|$|R
40|$|Having been {{introduced}} to {{the northern edge of}} Asian tropics, the rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis) has become deciduous in this climate with seasonal drought and cold stresses. To determine its internal nutrient strategy during leaf senescence and deciduous periods, we investigated mature leaf and senescent leaf nutrients, water-soluble soil nutrients and characteristics of soil microbiota in nine different <b>ages</b> <b>of</b> monoculture <b>rubber</b> plantations. Rubber trees demonstrate complicated retranslocation of N, P and K during foliar turnover. Approximately 50. 26 % of leaf nutrients and 21. 47 % of soil nutrients were redistributed to the rubber tree body during the leaf senescence and withering stages. However, no significant changes in the structure- or function-related properties of soil microbes were detected. These nutrient retranslocation strategy may be important stress responses. In the nutrient retranslocation process, soil plays a dual role as nutrient supplier and nutrient bank. Soil received the nutrients from abscissed leaves, and also supplied nutrients to trees in the non-growth stage. Nutrient absorption and accumulation began before the leaves started to wither and fall...|$|R
40|$|Rubbers are {{commonly}} compounded with different fillers {{in order to}} achieve the optimum of final properties. In studies layered silicates, montmorillonites, in natural and organically modified form were applied as reinforcing fillers for two rubbers differ in polarity, ethylene-propylene copolymer EPM and hydrogenated butadiene-acrylonitrile rubber HNBR. The clay/rubber composites were prepared by melt-compounding method using various mixing conditions to obtain an optimal level of intercalated and exfoliated montmorillonite structures in peroxide cured rubber composites. The aim {{of this paper is to}} compare the influence of various types of montmorillonites on the rubber curing, crosslink density and mechanical properties of vulcanizates.
