25|$|Aluminum {{electrolytic}} capacitors are polarized capacitors {{because of their}} anodization principle. They can only be operated with DC voltage applied with the correct polarity. Operating the capacitor with wrong polarity or with AC voltage leads to a short circuit and can destroy the component. The exceptions is the bipolar <b>aluminum</b> <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitor,</b> which has a back-to-back configuration of two anodes in one case {{and can be used}} in AC applications.|$|E
25|$|The decades from 1970 to 1990 {{were marked}} by the {{development}} of various new professional <b>aluminum</b> <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitor</b> series with f.e. very low leakage currents or with long life characteristics or for higher temperatures up to 125Â°C, which were specifically suited to certain industrial applications. The great diversity of the many series of aluminum electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolytes up to now (2014) is an indicator of the adaptability of the capacitors to meet different industrial requirements.|$|E

2500|$|An <b>aluminum</b> <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitor</b> with a non-solid {{electrolyte}} always {{consists of}} two aluminum foils separated mechanically by a spacer, mostly paper, which is saturated with a liquid or gel-like electrolyte. One of the aluminum foils, the anode, is etched (roughened) to increase the surface and oxidized (formed). The second aluminum foil, called the [...] "cathode foil", serves to make electrical contact with the electrolyte. A paper spacer mechanically separates the foils to avoid direct metallic contact. Both foils and the spacer are wound and the winding is impregnated with liquid electrolyte. The electrolyte, which serves as cathode of the capacitor, covers the etched rough structure of the oxide layer on the anode perfectly and makes the increased anode surface effectual. After impregnation the impregnated winding is mounted in an aluminum case and sealed.|$|E
