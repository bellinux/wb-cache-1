40|$|AbstractMost organisms {{contain a}} single Rieske/cytb complex. This enzyme can be {{integrated}} in any respiratory or photosynthetic electron transfer chain that is quinone-based and sufficiently energy rich {{to allow for the}} turnover of three enzymes — a quinol reductase, a Rieske/cytb complex and a terminal oxidase. Despite this universal usability of the enzyme a variety of phylogenetically distant organisms have multiple copies thereof and no reason for this redundancy is obvious. In this review we present an overview of the distribution of multiple copies among species and describe their properties from the scarce experimental results, analysis of their amino acid sequences and genomic context. We discuss the predicted redox properties of the Rieske cluster in relation {{to the nature of the}} pool quinone. It appears that acidophilic iron-oxidizing bacteria specialized one of their two copies for reverse electron transfer, archaeal Thermoprotei adapted their three copies to the interaction with different oxidases and several, phylogenetically unrelated species imported a second complex with a putative heme ci that may confer some yet to be determined properties to the complex.

In a letter addressed to the Great Powers, he stated his intention to lay down arms in exchange for honourable conditions. Most of the insurgents were ready to hand over their weapons and, for those who refused to lay down arms, it was proposed that they be transported to Greece without being disarmed. In exchange for 800 guns and the same number of cartridges, an amnesty would be possible for the insurgents, except for the gendarmes who had deserted.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{formulation}} for modelling mechanisms with a cam/follower type of contact using a multibody approach in relative coordinates. The proposed approach is inspired from the wheel/rail contact model developed by Fisette and Samin but, {{in the present}} case, possible intermittent contact between the cam and the follower is considered, for generality purposes. Loop kinematic constraints are introduced to satisfy tangent and punctual contact {{as long as the}} bodies lean against each other. The effective presence (or not) of the contact is governed by the sign of the normal constraint force which can be computed thanks to the Lagrange multipliers technique. The above-mentioned option to kinematically constraint the bodies in their 'contact phase' unavoidably leads to a shift from one model to another when a contact disappears (or, conversely, reappears). Indeed, this increases (or decreases) the number of degrees of freedom of the current system. The control of the variable partitioning is thus absolutely necessary and is <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> complex <b>so</b> that practical applications can contain several pairs of bodies in intermittent contact. Illustrative examples are proposed: a comparison with another multibody formalism, an experimental validation and the modelling of universal wheels of mobile robots which represents a quite original application of the proposed formulation...|$|R

Spatial distribution shows much higher BC concentration over the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) than the peninsular Indian stations.

40|$|This paper aims to {{show the}} uneven process of changes in {{competitiveness}} across Polish manufacturing industries during the period prior to Poland's EU membership (1996 - 2003). Based on the Schumpeterian approach to competitiveness, that {{is the ability to}} compete, it looks at changes in competitiveness as effects of competition and its factors. Using two types of measure, four clusters of Polish manufacturing industries are selected: double winners, export-led industries, export-oriented industries and losers. The analysis shows that the use of EU market share as a measure of changes in competitiveness fails to reveal differentiation in levels and changes in relative productivity in those industries that increased their EU market share. It also shows that the larger the initial differences in labour productivity across industries, the stronger the process of differentiation of changes in competitiveness. Systemic transition and external liberalisation are conducive to improvement in the competitiveness of highly productive industries, but create a weak stimulus for improvement in the competitiveness of the most backward ones. Secondly, the higher the investment rate and its dynamics, the larger the increase in competitive pressure on the EU market. This conclusion is of great importance for Polish manufacturing, <b>all</b> of <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>so</b> given that <b>the</b> potential to reduce employment seems to have been largely exhausted and investment intensity has dropped considerably, especially since 1998. competitiveness, productivity, transition economies, manufacturing industry, EU integration...|$|R

Materials were irradiated at room temperature in situ by TEM in a microscope coupled to two ion accelerators, simultaneously providing 500 keV Fe+ and 10 keV He+ ions. Single Fe ion and dual Fe and He ion beam experiments were performed up to a dose of 1 dpa and to a He content of up to 1000 appm. Defects appear {{in the form of}} nanometric black dots with sizes between 1 and 5 nm. Defocused images reveal a dense population of sub-nanometric cavities after both single-beam and dual-beam irradiation. In Fe(Cr) alloys, the number densities of visible black dot defects still resolved in TEM are significantly higher after single than after dual-beam irradiation. In UHP Fe, conversely, the presence of He strongly increases the defect number density. The presence of He changes a a 0 〈 1 0 0 〉 dominated defect population to a 1 / 2 a 0 〈 1 1 1 〉 dominated one in <b>all</b> materials, and <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>so</b> in UHP Fe.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{labour productivity}} levels and growth rates in 10 EMU economies: Germany, France, Belgium, Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Austria, Finland, Ireland and Portugal. In general, European economies still lag behind the United States {{in terms of}} productivity level. Available estimates indicate that in the tradables sector (mainly manufacturing) Belgium, France, the Netherlands and (perhaps more recently) Finland are the top performers among the European countries. There {{seems to be more}} room for catch-up growth in Portugal and Spain. For Ireland, relevant sectoral data were not available. As for the nontradables sector (mainly services), one can only draw tentative conclusions. European economies seem to have improved their performance relative to the US, but there is considerable heterogeneity across the different industrial sectors within each country. Hence there is probably room for sectoral catch-up growth in each of these economies, especially so in Portugal and Ireland, with the least room in Belgium, France and the Netherlands. A "stylized fact" indicates that labour productivity tends to grow faster in the tradables sector. On the other hand, the well-established Balassa-Samuelson hypothesis states that higher sectoral differences in productivity growth tend to generate higher sectoral inflation differentials and these, in turn, induce higher aggregate inflation. Against this backround, {{it is interesting to note}} that differentials in sectoral productivity growth rates seem to have been surprisingly similar among the countries studied: they have varied between 2 and 3 percentage points on average during the period studied. The overall view of the paper is that, due to the structural heterogeneity of countries concerned and measurement problems, caution should be exercised in classifying the EMU-countries into high- and low-productivity economies. A fairly certain conclusion of this study is that relative to the US there is still room for catch-up growth in productivity in <b>all</b> <b>the</b> countries, perhaps <b>more</b> <b>so</b> in Ireland, Portugal and Spain.
