2500|$|TEM-1 is {{the most}} {{commonly}} encountered beta-lactamase in Gram-negative bacteria. Up to 90% of <b>ampicillin</b> <b>resistance</b> in E. coli {{is due to the}} production of TEM-1. [...] Also responsible for the ampicillin and penicillin resistance that is seen in H. influenzae and N. gonorrhoeae in increasing numbers. Although TEM-type beta-lactamases are most often found in E. coli and K. pneumoniae, they are also found in other species of Gram-negative bacteria with increasing frequency. The amino acid substitutions responsible for the extended-spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL) phenotype cluster around the active site of the enzyme and change its configuration, allowing access to oxyimino-beta-lactam substrates. Opening the active site to beta-lactam substrates also typically enhances the susceptibility of the enzyme to β-lactamase inhibitors, such as clavulanic acid. Single amino acid substitutions at positions 104, 164, 238, and 240 produce the ESBL phenotype, but ESBLs with the broadest spectrum usually have more than a single amino acid substitution. Based upon different combinations of changes, currently 140 TEM-type enzymes have been described. TEM-10, TEM-12, and TEM-26 are among the most common in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|Various biotechnological {{processes}} {{have been}} developed for industrial scale riboflavin biosynthesis using different microorganisms, including filamentous fungi such as Ashbya gossypii, Candida famata and Candida flaveri, [...] as well as the bacteria Corynebacterium ammoniagenes and Bacillus subtilis. The latter organism has been genetically modified to both increase the bacteria's production of riboflavin and to introduce an antibiotic (<b>ampicillin)</b> <b>resistance</b> marker, and is now successfully employed at a commercial scale to produce riboflavin for feed and food fortification purposes. The chemical company BASF has installed a plant in South Korea, which is specialized on riboflavin production using Ashbya gossypii. The concentrations of riboflavin in their modified strain are so high, that the mycelium has a reddish/brownish color and accumulates riboflavin crystals in the vacuoles, which will eventually burst the mycelium. Riboflavin is sometimes overproduced, possibly as a protective mechanism, by certain bacteria in the presence of high concentrations of hydrocarbons or aromatic compounds. [...] One such organism is Micrococcus luteus (American Type Culture Collection strain number ATCC 49442), which develops a yellow color due to production of riboflavin while growing on pyridine, but not when grown on other substrates, such as succinic acid.|$|E

Many strains of bacteria are resistant {{to a variety of}} antibiotics, however the resistance that is most commonly used in research and industry is <b>ampicillin</b> <b>resistance.</b> It is used as a selectable marker in bacterial transformation. A selectable marker is a feature that allows for the scientist to select only for the bacterial cells that contain the gene that allows the bacterium to be resistant. This selection is done by growing the bacteria on or in a medium that contains ampicillin. All the cells that lack the amp resistance gene will be killed off, leaving only those with resistance.|$|E

40|$|When strains {{harboring}} R {{factor and}} showing <b>ampicillin</b> (APC) <b>resistance</b> were inoculated on plates containing various concentrations of APC, mutants carrying {{various levels of}} APC resistance occurred at high frequencies. Increases {{in the level of}} APC resistance were due to a quantitative increase in the formation of penicillinase. By conjugation experiments and transduction analysis, the mutation was found to affect the gene (amp) governing APC resistance on the R factor. The R-factor mutants carrying high and stable APC resistance were conjugally transferred at the same frequency as their parent R factors, and the level of their resistance to drugs other than APC was not distinct from that conferred by their parents. Such R-factor mutants could easily be obtained from wild-type R factors carrying low APC resistance. The hypersynthesis of penicillinase by such R-factor mutants was considered to be due to the replication of the amp gene on the R factor at hyper-rates and the integration of multiple copies of the amp gene (amp-hyper) in the R-factor genome...|$|R

50|$|Although <b>ampicillin</b> <b>resistance</b> {{can be a}} huge {{benefit to}} scientists, it can also cause {{problems}} in regards to medical treatment. If this resistance accidentally spreads to other, more harmful bacteria, then those infections become harder to treat. In today's society, more and more bacteria are becoming resistant to antibiotics that used to work on them. When talking about issues in medical treatment, antibiotic resistance cannot be limited to just ampicillin. There are more serious bacteria that are resistant to other types of bacteria. An example is MRSA, or Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus, which has become extremely difficult to treat with antibiotics. Methicillin is a much stronger antibiotic than the relatively weak ampicillin, which is why methicillin is not used as a selectable marker in scientific industry or research. If the <b>ampicillin</b> <b>resistance</b> gene accidentally spreads to other bacteria, then there are stronger antibiotics to kill off the bacteria.
