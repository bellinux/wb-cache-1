According to their publisher Charlie Pinder: [...] "They were a band {{that everyone in the}} A community knew about and would go and see every now and then. But they weren’t very good. They had quite good songs; Fran always did write good songs." [...] While on a visit to Scotland, American engineer and producer Niko Bolas, a long-time Neil Young and Rolling Stones associate, tuned into a Travis session on Radio Scotland, and heard something in the band's music which instantly made him travel to Perth to see them.
