5|$|A {{number of}} models for testing {{artificial}} intelligence {{have been noted}} by philosophers as being relevant to the themes present in Scott's filmography. The test most commonly associated with artificial intelligence in his work is the Turing test, created by the English computer scientist Alan Turing. Turing's argument was {{that there is no}} significant difference between <b>a</b> <b>human</b> and an android, which would be apparent when <b>a</b> <b>human</b> would be unable to identify if the individual they are communicating with is <b>a</b> <b>human</b> or android. In Blade Runner, the method for identifying the physically identical replicants is by administering the fictional Voight-Kampff test, which detects disparities in emotional responses. Though a replicant would fail the Turing test, an android at the chronological marker of Alien, such as Ash, would likely perform exceedingly well. Additionally, the Chinese room, created by John Searle, has been postured as a test relevant to the androids of the Alien franchise. As the test determines if someone can identify what is Chinese lettering without knowing what it means, philosophers have drawn a parallel to Ash, who may uncannily emulate <b>a</b> <b>human,</b> though fail to understand {{what it means to be}} one. Kang described David's eventual introduction as another android character created by Scott as a synthesis between both Alien and Blade Runner, with the character being capable of passing the Turing test like Ash, yet also able to pass the Chinese room test like a replicant, implying that he would indeed be the first living android of the Alien franchise.|$|E

She and Flounder go in search of human objects, which they take to a seagull named Scuttle for appraisal. Ariel falls in love with <b>a</b> <b>human</b> prince named Prince Eric after saving him from drowning, and visits the sea witch, Ursula, who agrees to turn her into <b>a</b> <b>human</b> in exchange for her voice. Ariel must make Prince Eric fall in love with her and romantically kiss her within three days, lest she belong to Ursula forever.|$|E

However, if injured, his accelerated metabolism is capable of repairing itself many times faster than <b>an</b> ordinary <b>human.</b> <b>A</b> doctor has told Spider-Man that it would be impossible for a normal man to survive the punishment that he has endured.|$|R

5|$|Habermas {{argues that}} his ethical theory is an {{improvement}} on Kant's ethics. He rejects the dualistic framework of Kant's ethics. Kant distinguished between the phenomena world, {{which can be}} sensed and experienced by humans, and the noumena, or spiritual world, which is inaccessible to humans. This dichotomy was necessary for Kant because it could explain the autonomy of <b>a</b> <b>human</b> agent: although <b>a</b> <b>human</b> is bound in the phenomenal world, their actions are free in the intelligible world. For Habermas, morality arises from discourse, which is made necessary by their rationality and needs, rather than their freedom.|$|E
