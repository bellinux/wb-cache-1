40|$|Summary. This paper {{explores the}} role and utility of {{variable}} compliance in running behaviors. While it is well understood in the literature that leg compliance {{plays an important role}} in running locomotion, our conjecture is that mechanically <b>adjustable</b> <b>leg</b> compliance improves the efficiency and robustness of a running system. We claim that variable compliance can serve as an effective means for gait regulation, and can enable energy efficient locomotion over a wide range of terrains and speeds. We draw inspiration from a number of observations in biomechanics, and use qualitative arguments and a simulation of our variable compliance actuator to support the underlying ideas. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{addresses}} {{the synthesis of}} controllers for walk-to-run transition (WRT) and run-to-walk transition (RWT) in legged robots with <b>adjustable</b> <b>leg</b> compliance. Inspired by human kinematics, we propose a detailed procedure for the WRT and RWT in an adjustable-stiffness spring and mass model, and derive control parameters that ensure effective gait transitions. The WRT is achieved by modulating the compliance of the leg in a piecewise constant way during the transition stride. In the RWT, {{in addition to the}} leg compliance, we modulate the touchdown angle of attack. The merits of the approach proposed are demonstrated via a simulation that incorporates the control of walking, followed by a transition to running with first increasing and then decreasing speed, and finally a transition back to walking...|$|E
40|$|A running animal {{coordinates}} {{the actions}} of many muscles, tendons, and ligaments in its leg so that the overall leg behaves like a single mechanical spring during ground contact. Experimental observations have revealed that an animal's leg stiffness is independent of both speed and gravity level, suggesting that it is dictated by inherent musculoskeletal properties. However, if leg stiffness was invariant, the biomechanics of running (e. g. peak ground reaction force and ground contact time) would change when an animal encountered different surfaces in the natural world. We foundthat human runners adjust their leg stiffness to accommodate changes in surface stiffness, allowing them to maintain similar running mechanics on different surfaces. These results provide important insight into the mechanics and control of animal locomotion and suggest that incorporating an <b>adjustable</b> <b>leg</b> stiffness {{in the design of}} hopping and running robots is important if they are to match the agility and speed of animals on varied terrain...|$|E

ROBOCYGNEThis trembling black robot swan which sometimes moves smoothly and gently, sometimes in a dramatic and fiery manner to Tchaikovsky´s majestic music is inspired by Edgar Degas’ sculpture The little fourteen year old dancer (1881), and is made from wax, bobbinet and silk ribbon. This birdlike body vibrates with electronic life and has the unattainable dream of dancing as prima ballerina on a grand stage. The music is a re-modelling of Rothbart’s theme from the Swan lake where both the ocean and the orchestra have been caressed and {{yet at the same time}} smacked by music technology. The dance has been created by a hands - on process where the robot body parts have been manipulated one by one to the music by the choreographer, in four recordings.

40|$|For most {{computed}} tomography (CT) simulators, radiation therapists must first remove the flat couch top {{in order to}} perform daily CT quality assurance (QA), and then use separate tools to perform localization-laser QA. This process wastes time and effort, and creates the opportunity for accidents to occur. In this study, we tested a simple, yet comprehensive, daily QA program and phantom designed for CT simulators used in radiation oncology that would enable us to use only one tool to perform both laser and imaging QA on a flat couch. To construct a modified QA phantom, we attached three <b>adjustable</b> <b>legs</b> and fastened two metric scales (one vertically and one horizontally) to a commercial CT QA phantom. The <b>adjustable</b> <b>legs</b> helped to position and level the phantom conveniently in the needed position. The two metric scales were used for localization-laser QA, while the phantom body was used for CT imaging QA.

50|$|The {{design project}} never went into production, {{although}} {{the concept was}} used on his parent's house (22 Parkside, Wimbledon), and later with the Oxley Woods housing development in Milton Keynes. It was designed to offer a wide range choice of configurations all at a low building cost, with minimum maintenance and running costs so that one 3 kilowatt heater would be sufficient to heat the whole building. The interior of the building could be changed very quickly or the house extended by just adding another section to the house. <b>Adjustable</b> <b>legs</b> were used so that the building could located anywhere and easily {{moved to a new}} site, instead of using sold foundations.

50|$|The {{first and}} most common KX, {{designed}} to be the direct successor to the K6, the KX100 is a four-sided rectangular box with a flat roof. Aside from the back panel, which is formed of stainless steel panels, the three other sides of the box are made of glass, with two large window panels set above and beneath a slim, black plastic modesty panel, also with a black plastic trim around the windows. The same three sides of the booth stop short of the ground to provide ventilation, another improvement on the non-ventilated K6, and for litter accumulation. Initial deliveries had cylindrical legs, for leveling on site, a flat-sheet roof with upturned edges and a multi-panel back. A slightly updated model known as the Mk2 soon followed, without the <b>adjustable</b> <b>legs</b> and with a single sheet back panel and the more familiar 'biscuit tin lid' roof.|$|R

500|$|The barrel has a rifling {{twist rate}} of one turn in [...] Because firing heats up the bore, the {{air-cooled}} barrel {{is equipped with a}} mechanism to remove and replace the barrel assembly with a spare. A folding bipod with <b>adjustable</b> <b>legs</b> is attached near the front of the weapon, though there are provisions for hard-mounting to a M192 Lightweight Ground Mount tripod or vehicle mount. The M249 provides accuracy approaching that of a rifle, combined with the sustained volume of fire of a machine gun. Its original gas regulator offered two different gas port sizes, allowing cyclic rates of fire of 725-rounds per minute (r/min) or 1,000r/min. The latter setting was intended for adverse conditions, such as an excessively dirty firearm or cold weather. The two-position gas regulator was discarded as part of a product improvement program. Sustained rate of fire, the rate of fire at which the gunner can fire continuously without overheating, is approximately 85r/min.|$|R
50|$|The FR F1 is a {{precision}} rifle used by French sharpshooters. It was manufactured by MAS (an abbreviation of Manufacture d'Armes St. Etienne - {{one of several}} government-owned arms factories in France). It has been upgraded to FR F2 standard, and is still in service with all branches of French armed forces in this version. It was first designed around the 7.5×54mm MAS cartridge before being converted to 7.62×51mm NATO ammunition when it was upgraded to FR F2 standard. It was equipped with a telescopic sight, French army standard issue being an APX L806. Its practical range is 600 to 800 meters. It is a very accurate sniper rifle, due to its quality, rear locking helical lugs that cam the bolt forward during closure to obtain optimal cartridge seating, free-floating barrel and efficient combined muzzle brake/stabilizer that dampens the barrel vibrations. The FR F1 utilizes the same basic bolt design as the older MAS-36 infantry rifle. The MAS-36 bolt action was however extensively modified and strengthened to reduce accuracy-inhibiting flex. The FR-F1 was fitted with a bipod with fully <b>adjustable</b> <b>legs,</b> mid-way {{along the length of}} the rifle.|$|R

40|$|The {{sound of}} {{fly-over}} aircraft is measured {{with the use}} of an acoustic camera to gain more information on aircraft noise. This camera can be optimised to gain data of a higher quality. Within the ANCE section this optimisation was required mainly to diminish the influence of the ground effect in the data and to increase the resolution of the eventual source plots. The increase in resolution was required to be able to separate engine and airframe noise also for the smaller aircraft. The research started with a quantification of the previous fly-over camera of the ANCE section. It appeared that the fringes from Lloyds’s mirror pattern were present, but different for each microphone. This was due to the edge diffraction and should be solved by placing the microphones at least 30 cm from the edge. The increase in resolution should be solved by doubling the array aperture to 3. 4 m. These and many other findings were implemented in a new design. This design consists out of a de-attachable rigid structure of 4 x 4 m placed on <b>adjustable</b> <b>legs</b> to which 64 microphones could be clipped in an Underbrink spiral array configuration. The design was built and tested for fly-over aircraft at Schiphol Airport. The measured data was analysed and it appeared that the fringes from the ground effect were gone. Furthermore, the resolution was improved and the engines and main landing could be separated for smaller aircraft as the B 737 and A 321...|$|R
50|$|The basic Cymbeline was {{a single}} unit on a {{turntable}} stand with four <b>adjustable</b> <b>legs</b> for levelling. The main elements were the antenna, the Foster scanner, the main electronic unit and a Wankel rotary generator (using two-stroke fuel) weighing 390 kg. This was strapped to a simple 590 kg trailer {{that it could be}} operated from. Off the trailer the radar was 2.29 metres high with the antenna up, 1.07 metres with antenna folded, 1.7 metres wide and 1.5 metres long.The radar itself had a nominal 100 kW peak average output and a nominal pulse repetition frequency of 4000 pulses/second.The radar was connected by cable to the operator’s console (‘Indicator Azimuth Unit’) and connected to this was the ‘Mortar Coordinate Indicator’ that displayed the located mortar’s position to the detachment commander. The Foster scanner converted a narrow radar beam, about 40 mils diameter, into one 720 mils wide and 30 mils high. This beam had five pre-set operating positions determined by five different radar horns that directed the beam onto the antenna at slightly different angles. Two beam positions were used with a mortar bomb being recorded by the operator as it went through each beam. This gave two ranges and elevations, and the time interval. The operator marked his screen at each bomb position and changed the beam angle which also recorded time. He then placed electronic markers against his marks (which represented the bomb’s position in the horizontal plane) which the analogue computer used to calculate the mortar coordinates using the expected mortar altitude that has been previously set.|$|R

Customers could choose between a bonnet of plain polished aluminium or have it painted to match {{the rest of the}} car. Advertisements for the OE when introduced in 1922 noted the electric lighting now included six lamps, an instrument board lamp and gauges together with both an electric horn and a bulb horn.
