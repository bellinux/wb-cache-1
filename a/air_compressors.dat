40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} reduce {{vibration}} a new variable structure sliding mode control strategy was proposed in direct-drive air compressor,because torque fluctuate of direct-drive <b>air</b> <b>compressor</b> is large. In {{order to reduce}} volume and economize energy, direct-drive <b>air</b> <b>compressor</b> dived by permanent magnet synchronous motor(PMSM). Mathematics model of <b>air</b> <b>compressor</b> torque was built up, and load of <b>air</b> <b>compressor</b> was analyzed. Mathematics model and torque equation of PMSM were built up. Variable structure sliding mode to PMSM was built up. Basing on characteristic to control of PMSM and load of <b>air</b> <b>compressor,</b> the system was simulated in simulink. The result shows that rotate speed fluctuate of direct-drive <b>air</b> <b>compressor</b> controlled by variable structure sliding mode is {{less than that of}} direct-drive <b>air</b> <b>compressor</b> controlled by PI. The test of direct-drive <b>air</b> <b>compressor</b> dived by PSMS was done. Experimental results verified that variable structure sliding mode control strategy improve dynamic quality of system and has good robustness.

5|$|Diving {{cylinders}} {{should only}} be filled with suitably filtered air from diving <b>air</b> <b>compressors</b> or with other breathing gases using gas blending or decanting techniques. In some jurisdictions, suppliers of breathing gases are required by legislation to periodically test the quality of compressed air produced by their equipment and to display the test results for public information. The standards for industrial gas purity and filling equipment and procedures may allow some contaminants at levels unsafe for breathing, and their use in breathing gas mixtures at high pressure could be harmful or fatal.|$|E

5000|$|A {{variable-speed drive}} (VSD) <b>air</b> <b>compressor</b> [...] is an <b>air</b> <b>compressor</b> that takes {{advantage}} of variable-speed drive technology.

5000|$|An <b>air</b> <b>compressor</b> is {{a device}} that {{converts}} power (using an electric motor, diesel or gasoline engine, etc.) into potential energy stored in pressurized air (i.e., compressed air). By one of several methods, an <b>air</b> <b>compressor</b> forces more and more air into a storage tank, increasing the pressure. When tank pressure reaches its upper limit the <b>air</b> <b>compressor</b> shuts off. The compressed air, then, is held in the tank until called into use. [...] The energy contained in the compressed air {{can be used for}} a variety of applications, utilizing the kinetic energy of the air as it is released and the tank depressurizes. When tank pressure reaches its lower limit, the <b>air</b> <b>compressor</b> turns on again and re-pressurizes the tank.|$|R

25|$|During {{the early}} days of marine aquaria, {{saltwater}} was collected at local beaches. Natural saltwater contains many unwanted organisms and pollutants. Aquarium literature of the time suggests that the most commonly kept marine fish were the percula clownfish, sergeant major damselfish, small, brackish-water pufferfish and scats, jeweled blennies, and blue damsels. Aquariums were equipped with large <b>air</b> <b>compressors,</b> and were heavily aerated and filtered (primarily with undergravel filters, a norm for some time).|$|E

The lack of a requirement for compressed air and the lack of moving parts means that power consumption is less than for the equivalent mechanical or conventional column flotation cell.|$|E

However, the lights were too bright for the maintenance workers' liking, so they kept them lit only until they started and after they finished their work.|$|E
25|$|It is {{difficult}} to detect most gases {{that are likely to}} be present in diving cylinders because they are colourless, odourless and tasteless. Electronic sensors exist for some gases, such as oxygen analysers, helium analyser, carbon monoxide detectors and carbon dioxide detectors. Oxygen analysers are commonly found underwater in rebreathers. Oxygen and helium analysers are often used on the surface during gas blending to determine the percentage of oxygen or helium in a breathing gas mix. Chemical and other types of gas detection methods are not often used in recreational diving, but are used for periodical quality testing of compressed breathing air from diving <b>air</b> <b>compressors.</b>|$|E
