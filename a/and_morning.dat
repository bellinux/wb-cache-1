5|$|Aveni {{claims that}} another {{building}} {{associated with the}} planet Venus {{in the form of}} Kukulcan, and the rainy season at Chichen Itza is the Caracol. This is a building with circular tower and doors facing the cardinal directions. The base faces the most northerly setting of Venus. Additionally the pillars of a stylobate on the building's upper platform were painted black and red. These are colours associated with Venus as an evening <b>and</b> <b>morning</b> star. However the windows in the tower seem to have been little more than slots, making them poor at letting light in, but providing a suitable place to view out.|$|E
5|$|Cryptum {{takes place}} {{approximately}} 100,000 {{years before the}} present day in the Halo universe, {{telling the story of}} the Forerunners before their disappearance. It revolves around the journey of a young Forerunner, Bornstellar, and two humans, Chakas <b>and</b> <b>Morning</b> Riser, and how their lives change when they meet a Forerunner warrior, the Didact. The Forerunners are a type-three civilization on the Kardashev scale; they can build artificial planets and control stars. Forerunners are divided into classes by occupation, they are (in order of rank): Builders, the architects of the Forerunners' megastructures, Miners, Lifeworkers, experts in medicine and biology, and Warriors. Bornstellar's family are politically important Builders and particularly wealthy, enabling them to own an entire planet. Warriors introduced in this book called Prometheans were later featured as antagonists in the video game Halo 4.|$|E
5|$|In Bandung, Hasan {{works for}} the Japanese {{occupation}} government and lives an ascetic lifestyle, often fasting {{for days on end}} and dunking himself into a river to refresh his body between evening <b>and</b> <b>morning</b> prayers. While there, he meets his childhood friend Rusli, who introduces Hasan to his friend Kartini. Seeing that Rusli and Kartini are atheistic Marxist-Leninists, Hasan considers it his duty to return them to Islam. However, he finds himself unable to address Rusli's arguments against religion and begins doubting his faith. Soon Hasan becomes increasingly divorced from his religious upbringing, at one time skipping the mandatory maghrib prayer to watch a movie with Kartini. Through Rusli, Hasan is introduced to people from different ideologies, including the anarcho-nihilist playboy Anwar; he also begins courting Kartini.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} measure the {{physical}} load of training of members who belong to the Judo and Basketball teams, urinary proteins before and after routine training were measured by the turbidity method (modified meulemans method) of members. The following results were obtained. 1) In members of the Basketball club, significant increase in actual urinary protein concentration was observed between noon and evening on the first day, between <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> noon, between noon and evening on the second day, between <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> noon, between <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> evening {{on the third day}} <b>and</b> between <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> evening on the fourth day. Significant increase in urinary protein-concentration corrected to a urine density of 1. 024 was observed between noon and evening on the first day, between <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> evening on the second day, between <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> noon, between <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> evening on the third day, <b>and</b> between <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> evening on the fourth day. Significant increase a excretion per minute of urinary protein was observed between noon and evening on the first day, between <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> noon <b>and</b> between <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> evening on the third day. 2) In members of the Judo club, significant increase in actual urinary protein concentration was observed between noon and evening on the first day, between <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> noon, between <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> evening on the second day, <b>and</b> between <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> noon on the fourth day. Significant increase in protein-concentration corrected to a urine density of 1. 024 was observed between noon and evening on the first day, between <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> evening on the second day, <b>and</b> between <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> noon on the fourth day. Significant increase in the excretion per minute of urinary protein was observed between noon and evening of the first day, between <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> noon on the second day, <b>and</b> between <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> noon on the fourth day. 3) The existence of Pre (α 1) AG, (α 1) AT, (α 1) X, I(α) I, Zn(α 2), (β 2) AC, Myogl, C(3) act., Tf, (β 2) III, IgA, (β 2) I, Alb, and IgG of serum subfractions were recognized by immunodiffusion in an antigencontained gel layer. In particular, excretion of myoglobin was recognized. The experiments on optical density of the turbidity method of each fraction were discussed. 4) The main subjective symptoms (from questionnaires) which increased with physical loads were "Whole body getting tired", "Legs getting tired" and "Wanting to lie down" in group I in the basketball club, and "Whole body getting tired", "Legs getting tired", "Feel unsteady standing", "Becoming drowsy", "Wanting to lie down" in group I, "Feeling stiff in the shoulders", "Feeling thirsty" and "Tremor in limbs" in group III in the Judo club. 5) The preliminary care of fatigued members was discussed...|$|R
5|$|Throughout {{the evening}} of July 1 <b>and</b> <b>morning</b> of July 2, most of the {{remaining}} infantry of both armies arrived on the field, including the Union II, III, V, VI, and XII Corps. Two of Longstreet's brigades were on the road: Brig. Gen. George Pickett, had begun the 22 mile (35 km) march from Chambersburg, while Brig. Gen. E. M. Law had begun the march from Guilford. Both arrived late in the morning. Law completed his 28-mile (45 km) march in eleven hours.|$|E
5|$|In {{accordance}} with changes {{made for the}} 1924 final onwards, all tickets were sold in advance to prevent {{a repeat of the}} overcrowding at the 1923 final. Approximately 91,000 tickets were available. 53,000 were standing tickets, 15,000 were uncovered seats and 23,000 were covered seats. Standing tickets cost two shillings, seat prices ranged from five shillings to one guinea. The majority of tickets were sold before the finalists were known. As a result, few supporters of the participating teams attended; most were unable to afford the remaining tickets available to the general public, which were typically in the more expensive areas of the stadium. 1,750 tickets were allocated directly to each club. Bolton fielded 6,000 enquiries and lodged a formal protest about the inadequacy of their allocation. The London, Midland and Scottish Railway laid on a total of seven special trains from Manchester to London on the eve <b>and</b> <b>morning</b> of the match. A number of supporters travelled to London without tickets in the hope of securing one outside the stadium. 5s tickets changed hands for up to 15s, provoking the ire of ticketless supporters who accused the sellers of profiteering. In one such instance, a man selling twenty 2s tic|kets at 10s each required the assistance of five police officers to escape the wrath of the crowd. The total gate receipts for the match were £23,157, a new record.|$|E

25|$|Dress coats <b>and</b> <b>morning</b> coats, {{the other}} main knee-length coats of the period, shared the waist seam of frock coats, making them all body coats, but {{differed}} {{in the cut}} of the skirt, as the frock coat {{does not have the}} cut away front which gives dress coats <b>and</b> <b>morning</b> coats tails at the back. As was usual with all coats in the 19th century, shoulder padding (called 'American shoulders') was rare or minimal. The formal frock coat only buttons down to the waist seam, which is decorated at the back with a pair of buttons. The frock coat that buttoned up to the neck, forming a high, stand-up collar, was worn only by clergymen.|$|E
