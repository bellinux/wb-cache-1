Two-dimensional incompressible unsteady Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) equations are solved {{in conjunction with the}} SST k ω − turbulence model in simulations. Taking the Great Belt Bridge girder as an example, cases of different suction positions on the girder section were discussed. The effect of the suction ratio and the angle of attack (AOA) of wind also were investigated. The result showed that the aerodynamic drag force was influenced by the uniform suction through either upper surface or lower surface of the box girder. The larger the suction ratio was, the more the drag-reducing could be. The suction position and AOA had a comprehensive effect on the drag force. The vortex shedding frequency was also affected by <b>air</b> <b>suction.</b> For the aerodynamic lift force and moment, <b>air</b> <b>suction</b> showed no obvious influence.

40|$|On {{the basis}} of {{boundary}} layer with the airfoil profile, this research attempts to investigate {{the effect of the}} angle of spread of the winged <b>air</b> <b>suction</b> equipment on the efficiency of operation. The application of Fluent with the split-middle method under the identical operation mode is expected to optimize the spread angle. The investigated airfoil profile is NACA 6413, of which the restrictions on the critical angle of spread suggested in literature will be overcome through the interactions between the internal and external flow fields. As a result, the air speed might increase. The wind tunnel test employed in this research offers the solid evidences to support this hypothesis. The test demonstrates that when the angle of spread is larger than 12 °, the effect of accelerating the air flow is still observable. Following the optimization, the <b>air</b> <b>suction</b> effect of the equipment would be optimal when its angle of spread reached 30 °.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Bacterial {{contamination}} of endoscopy suites is of concern; however studies evaluating bacterial aerosols are lacking. We aimed {{to determine the}} effectiveness of <b>air</b> <b>suctioning</b> during removal of biopsy forceps in reducing bacterial air contamination. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a prospective single-blinded trial involving 50 patients who were undergoing elective nontherapeutic colonoscopy. During colonoscopy, endoscopists removed the biopsy forceps first without and then with suctioning following contact with the sigmoid mucosa. A total of 50 L of air was collected continuously for 30 seconds at 30 -cm distance from the biopsy channel valve of the colonoscope, with time starting at forceps removal. Airborne bacteria were collected by an impactor air sampler (MAS- 100). Standard Petri dishes with CNA blood agar were used to culture Gram-positive bacteria. Main outcome measure was the bacterial load in endoscopy room air. RESULTS: At {{the beginning and end}} of the daily colonoscopy program, the median (and interquartile [IQR] range) bioaerosol burden was 4 colony forming units (CFU) /m (3) (IQR 3 - 6) and 16 CFU/m (3) (IQR 13 - 18), respectively. <b>Air</b> <b>suctioning</b> during removal of the biopsy forceps reduced the bioaerosol burden from a median of 14 CFU/m (3) (IQR 11 - 29) to a median of 7 CFU/m (3) (IQR 4 - 16) (P = 0. 0001). Predominantly enterococci were identified on the agar plates. CONCLUSION: The bacterial aerosol burden during handling of biopsy forceps can be reduced by applying <b>air</b> <b>suction</b> while removing the forceps.

40|$|Abstract: Aeration is {{the process}} by which the area of contact between water and air is increased, either by natural methods or by {{mechanical}} devices. Proper aeration can make considerable improvements in a pond ecosystem. This paper investigates pond aeration by two phase flow systems such as high head gated conduit flow systems and two phase pipe flow systems using venturi tubes. When the gate of a high head outlet conduit is partly opened or a minimal amount of differential pressure exists between the inlet and outlet sides of the venturi tube, <b>air</b> <b>suction</b> occurs at <b>air</b> vents. In two phase flow systems, air that is entrained into the water will be momentarily forced downstream in the form of small air bubbles. The dissolution of oxygen into the water results from the <b>air</b> <b>suction</b> downstream of high head gated conduit and venturi tube, and the rising air bubbles into pond. Moreover, high pressure in two phase flow systems also facilitates the dissolution of oxygen into the water. Therefore, two phase flow systems have an extremely high efficiency for transferring oxygen from air bubbles to water. It was observed from the results that two phase flow systems were more efficient in deep ponds than in shallow ponds...|$|R

The most important methods to evaluate ammonia volatilization are the dynamic flux chamber and micrometeorological method. The chambers are more flexible and simple to use in every situation.
