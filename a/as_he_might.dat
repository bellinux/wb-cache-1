25|$|The Meditator {{finds it}} almost {{impossible}} to keep his habitual opinions and assumptions out of his head, try <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>might.</b> He resolves to pretend that these opinions are totally false and imaginary in order to counterbalance his habitual way of thinking. The Meditator wishes to avoid an excess of skepticism and instead uses a skeptical method, an important distinction. He supposes that not God, but some evil demon has committed itself to deceiving him so that everything he thinks he knows is false. By doubting everything, he can at least be sure not to be misled into falsehood by this demon.|$|E
25|$|Had {{the navy}} {{adequately}} and fairly explained the post to the appellant, and the backup it offered, his position would not, Cameron found, have been intolerable. Its {{failure to do}} so meant that the operating cause of the appellant's resignation was the navy's conduct. The appeal, accordingly, had to be upheld. The order of the court a quo was set aside and replaced with an order declaring that the plaintiff was entitled to such compensation <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> prove for his constructive dismissal by the defendant. The decision in Murray v Minister of Defence was thus reversed.|$|E
25|$|Robert's three decade episcopate {{would prove}} {{to be one of the}} most {{important}} in the history of the bishopric. Robert was not perhaps as successful <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have been in promoting the Augustinian Order in Scotland, but he nevertheless managed to bring Augustinians to St Andrews to found a Cathedral Priory in 1144. It is relatively clear that he did this with the co-operation of Athelwold, the first prior of St. Oswald's, and Bishop of Carlisle, a fellow Nostell monk who was head of Robert's religious community in the days before the latter moved to Scotland. Robert also established two great Augustinian abbeys, Holyrood Abbey and the Arrouaisian abbey of St Mary at Stirling (Cambuskenneth).|$|E

25|$|Again, like Salerno, {{there were}} serious {{problems}} with the landings. The commander, Lieutenant General John P. Lucas, did not exploit as aggressively <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have done and was relieved for it. Lucas believed {{that if he had}} pushed too far, his forces could have been cut off by the Germans. But as the whole purpose of the invasion was to attack the German lines behind Monte Cassino and break out into the Italian areas which were undefended, the idea that Lucas thought he should land then sit and do nothing is incredible. The Germans came even closer than Salerno to breaking up the beachhead. They pushed through the defences to the last line before the sea. Again massive firepower on the Allied side saved the beachhead.|$|E
25|$|Irish law {{recognised}} {{a number}} of classes, from unfree to king, which were ranked within the status tracts. Little space {{was given to the}} unfree, which reflects the lack of dependence upon slaves as opposed to other societies, such as Ancient Rome. However, the laws discuss slaves, both male and female, and the term for a female slave, Cumhall, became a broader currency term. As unfree, slaves could not be legal agents either for themselves or others. In addition to the wholly unfree, a few individuals were semi-free. The senchléithe (hereditary serf) was bound to work the land of his master, whereas the fuidir had no independent status nor land of his own, but could at least leave <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> desire.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the {{microwave}} needed {{to return to}} the future has been destroyed and replacements have not been invented yet. A microwave antenna from the army base would work, but Professor Farnsworth warns that using it could change history. He likewise warns Fry against visiting his grandfather, Enos, who is stationed at the base, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> kill Enos and erase his own existence. Rather than persuading him to avoid his grandfather, the professor's warning causes Fry to become obsessed with protecting Enos from possible harm and encouraging his copulation with his fiance Mildred. Fry finally resorts to locking Enos in an abandoned house to prevent his coming to harm. The house is located {{in the middle of a}} nuclear weapon testing range, and Enos is shortly killed by one of the tests.|$|E

25|$|After {{the death}} of Bahadur Shah of Gujarat in 1537, Qadir Shah became the new ruler of Malwa Sultanate. He then turned for support towards the Rajput and Muslim noblemen of the Khilji rule of Malwa. Bhupat Rai and Puran Mal, sons of Raja Silhadi {{accepted}} service under the regime of Malwa in recognition of their interest in the Raisen region. By 1540, Bhupat Rai had died and Puran Mal had become the dominant force in eastern Malwa. In 1542, Sher Shah conquered Malwa without a fight and Qadir Shah fled to Gujarat. He then appointed Shuja'at Khan as the governor of Malwa who reorganised the administration and made Sarangpur the seat of Malwa's government. Sher Shah then ordered Puran Mal to be brought before him. Puran Mal agreed to accept his lordship and left his brother Chaturbhuj under Sher Shah's service. In exchange Sher Shah vowed to safeguard Puran Mal and his land. The Muslim women of Chanderi, which Sher Shah took under his rule, came to him and accused Puran Mal of killing their husbands and enslaving their daughters. They threatened to accuse the sultan on the Day of Resurrection {{if he did not}} avenge them. Upon reminding them of his vow for Puran Mal's safety, they told him to consult his ulema. The ulema issued a fatwa declaring that Puran Mal deserved death for this act. Sher Shah's troops then surrounded Puran Mal's fortress at Raisen. Upon seeing this, Puran Mal beheaded his wife and ordered the Rajputs to kill their families <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have thought that personal honor was involved because of his lord going back on his promise. After this, the Rajputs then went into battle and all of them were killed by Sher Shah's troops. `Abd al-Qadir Bada'uni puts the number of Rajputs to 10,000 while Nizamuddin Ahmad puts it to 4,000.|$|E

Sayid pays his respects to Naomi Dorrit, and takes her bracelet. He then offers to retrieve Charlotte without bloodshed, in return gaining a helicopter flight to the freighter anchored offshore. [...] He takes along Miles and Kate. Sayid asks Jack not to come with them <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> be unpredictable around Locke.|$|E
500|$|The A.V. Clubs Keith Phipps {{gave the}} episode a B+, noting that Rory's death had been spoiled {{for him by}} commenters on the site and thus he did not enjoy the episode as much <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have. He called it [...] "satisfying, if not extraordinary" [...] {{conclusion}} and [...] "another pretty solid entry in the series". He further praising Gillan and Amy's character for [...] " [...] to impress" [...] {{as well as the}} depths to the supporting characters by both Chibnall and Way, and the allegories that could be derived from the conflict between the humans and the Silurians and the aftermath of Rory's demise.|$|E

500|$|At {{the time}} of her accession, the {{government}} was led by the Whig prime minister Lord Melbourne. The prime minister at once became a powerful influence on the politically inexperienced Queen, who relied on him for advice. Charles Greville supposed that the widowed and childless Melbourne was [...] "passionately fond of her <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> be of his daughter if he had one", and Victoria probably saw him as a father figure. Her coronation took place on 28 June 1838 at Westminster Abbey. Over 400,000 visitors came to London for the celebrations. She became the first sovereign to take up residence at Buckingham Palace and inherited the revenues of the duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall as well as being granted a civil list allowance of £385,000 per year. Financially prudent, she paid off her father's debts.|$|E
500|$|London's {{initially}} cool {{reception of}} Messiah led Handel {{to reduce the}} season's planned six performances to three, and not to present the work at all in 1744—to the considerable annoyance of Jennens, whose relations with the composer temporarily soured. [...] At Jennens's request, Handel made several changes in the music for the 1745 revival: [...] "Their sound is gone out" [...] became a choral piece, the soprano song [...] "Rejoice greatly" [...] was recomposed in shortened form, and the transpositions for Cibber's voice were restored to their original soprano range. Jennens wrote to Holdsworth on 30 August 1745: [...] " [...] has made a fine Entertainment of it, though not near so good <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> & ought to have done. I have with great difficulty made him correct some of the grosser faults in the composition..." [...] Handel directed two performances at Covent Garden in 1745, on 9 and 11 April, and then set the work aside for four years.|$|E
500|$|Reed {{attended}} Howard University in Washington, D.C., {{graduating in}} 1991 {{with a degree}} in political science. Students took over the Howard administration building in 1989, protesting having Republican National Committee Chairman Lee Atwater on the university's board of trustees, saying that he had contributed to [...] "growing anti-black sentiment in America" [...] through his management of President George H. W. Bush's campaign. Atwater resigned from the board. Reed disagreed with their action, saying {{there was nothing wrong with}} having the Republican Party try to win the votes of black students. He felt it would have been better if Atwater had met with the protesting students, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have learned more about their position. For instance, [...] " [...] might have gained insight into a generation of students portrayed as destitute and in need of more federal support." [...] Reed noted [...] "that 85 percent of Howard's 12,000 students receive federal aid." ...|$|E

500|$|After the 1959 season, Weiss made a {{trade with}} Kansas City to bring Roger Maris to the Yankees. Stengel was {{delighted with the}} {{acquisition}} and batted Maris third in the lineup, {{just in front of}} Mantle, and the new Yankee responded with an MVP season in 1960. Stengel had health issues during the season, spending ten days in the hospital in late May and early June, with the illness variously reported as a bladder infection, a virus or influenza. The Yankees were challenged by the Baltimore Orioles [...] for most of the year but won the pennant by eight games, Stengel's tenth as manager, tying the major league record held by McGraw. The Yankees played the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 1960 World Series, and Stengel picked Art Ditmar, who had won the most games, 15, for the Yankees, rather than the established star, Whitey Ford. The Pirates knocked Ditmar out of the box in the first inning, and won Game 1. Ditmar was also knocked out of Game 5; Ford won Games 3 and 6 of the seven-game series with shutouts, but could not pitch Game 7, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have if Stengel had used him in Games 1 and 5. The Pirates defeated the Yankees in Game 7, 10–9, [...] on [...] a ninth-inning Bill Mazeroski home run.|$|E
500|$|Production in Sydney {{commenced}} {{the week}} beginning 1 October and lasted for 18 days. The main cast and Sean Pertwee were flown out {{along with a}} skeleton crew. Additional staff were drawn from those already working for Granada Australia, the Australian production arm of Granada Productions, as flying a complete British crew overseas would have been prohibitively expensive. Filming locations included Hyde Park, Kirribilli, Double Bay and the Northern Beaches. The scenes of Shawn's barbecue were filmed in Palm Beach and the facade of a terraced house in Paddington was used for an establishing scene of Lucy's apartment. The wedding scenes were set in the grounds of Strickland House, Vaucluse. Another scene was filmed on location outside the Sydney Opera House. While preparing for the scene, Hermione Norris and Robert Bathurst were distracted {{by a group of}} British tourists yelling that Karen should leave David after David's affair in Series 3. The group remained quiet when the scene was being shot. Karen and David's apartment was filmed at a building near Luna Park in Milsons Point. A stunt team co-ordinated the fight scene between Mark and David but could not convincingly choreograph a headbutt between Mark and David. The stunt co-ordinator and Pertwee, who was already experienced in stunt fighting, agreed Pertwee would get a better reaction from Bathurst by almost headbutting his face for real, instead of [...] "hitting air". Initially startled by the move, Bathurst conceded that it was better for him to be surprised <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have flinched if he had known what Pertwee was about to do. Hermione Norris found the scene upsetting insofar as it was unusual to see Robert Bathurst playing David in such an emotional state.|$|E
2500|$|When Sousa Mendes issued these visas and {{thousands}} of others, it was a deliberate act of disobedience to the decree of an authoritarian dictatorship.

2500|$|When the eighteen-year-old Brian Close {{was out to}} a poor stroke on his Ashes {{debut in}} 1950–51, Brown was {{extremely}} unsympathetic to Close who became distressed by his experiences on the tour.

2500|$|He visited Balmoral Castle in September 1879, and in {{subsequent}} years wrote the Queen letters described by Ian Beckett as “extraordinarily sycophantic”. He was already very deaf and hardly stopped talking; the Queen herself recorded that she “hollered at him”, whilst in the field an officer had to accompany him at night <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> not hear a sentry’s challenge; his deafness came partly from his various fevers.

2500|$|The {{pressurisation}} {{system was}} driven by a Rotol supercharger attached to the left-hand engine (this was {{the difference between the}} Merlin 76 and 77), providing a constant pressure of [...] over the exterior pressure.
