Jessel also wrote Trial and Error, a book to accompany the eponymous Channel 4 television series.|$|E

500|$|The four valses-caprices {{are not a}} cycle, {{but rather}} two sets of two, [...] the first [...] from Fauré's early period and the second from his middle period. Morrison calls all four [...] "more 'caprice' than 'waltz, and {{comments}} that they combine and develop the scintillating style of Chopin and Saint-Saëns waltzes. They show Fauré at his most playful, presenting variations before the theme is heard and darting {{in and out of}} unexpected keys. [...] Aaron Copland, though generally a keen admirer of Fauré's music, wrote, [...] "the several Valses-Caprices, in spite of their admirable qualities, seem to me essentially foreign to Faure's esprit. His is too orderly, too logical <b>a</b> <b>mind</b> <b>to</b> be really capricious." [...] Cortot, by contrast, spoke approvingly of their [...] "sensual grace... perfect distinction... impassioned tenderness." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{first episode}} of The Judy Garland Show aired on September 29, 1963. The show, {{featuring}} guest star Donald O'Connor, was the seventh one taped. Episodes {{would continue to}} be shown out of sequence throughout the series' run. The show scored an 18.7 rating and reviews were largely positive. Variety wrote [...] "If Judy Garland ... is of <b>a</b> <b>mind</b> <b>to</b> work every week with the same dedication and zeal that characterized her premiere this week, Bill Paley and his associates should be in clover. ... Miss Garland was in fine fettle." [...] The San Francisco Chronicle characterized the show as [...] "tasteful, elegant and exciting." [...] Not every review was as glowing, with the New York Herald Tribune noting [...] "Miss Garland is fine, just fine. The rest of the show, however, needs help." [...] Other negative reviews were in a similar vein, focusing on Van Dyke in particular and the show's format and writing in general.|$|E
500|$|Five {{distinct}} {{methods of}} breaking up a marriage {{existed in the}} early modern period of English history. One was to sue in the ecclesiastical courts for separation from bed and board (a mensa et thoro), {{on the grounds of}} adultery or life-threatening cruelty, but it did not allow a remarriage. From the 1550s, until the Matrimonial Causes Act became law in 1857, divorce in England was only possible, if at all, by the complex and costly procedure of a private Act of Parliament. [...] Although the divorce courts set up {{in the wake of the}} 1857 Act made the procedure considerably cheaper, divorce remained prohibitively expensive for the poorer members of society. [...] An alternative was to obtain a [...] "private separation", an agreement negotiated between both spouses, embodied in a deed of separation drawn up by a conveyancer. Desertion or elopement was also possible, whereby the wife was forced out of the family home, or the husband simply set up a new home with his mistress. Finally, the less popular notion of wife selling was an alternative but illegitimate method of ending a marriage. The Laws Respecting Women, As They Regard Their Natural Rights (1777) observed that, for the poor, wife selling was viewed as a [...] "method of dissolving marriage", when [...] "a husband and wife find themselves heartily tired of each other, and agree to part, if the man has <b>a</b> <b>mind</b> <b>to</b> authenticate the intended separation by making it a matter of public notoriety".|$|E

500|$|Either/Or portrays two life views. Each life view {{is written}} and {{represented}} by a fictional pseudonymous author, with the prose of the work reflecting and depending on the life view being discussed. For example, the aesthetic life view is written in short essay form, with poetic imagery and allusions, discussing aesthetic topics such as music, seduction, drama, and beauty. The ethical life view is written as two long letters, with a more argumentative and restrained prose, discussing moral responsibility, critical reflection, and marriage. The views of the book are not neatly summarized, but are expressed as lived experiences embodied by the pseudonymous authors. The book's central concern is the primal question asked by Aristotle, [...] "How should we live?" [...] His book was certainly informed by Epictetus; [...] "Consider first, man, what the matter is, and what your own nature is able to bear. If you would be a wrestler, consider your shoulders, your back, your thighs; for different persons are made for different things. Do {{you think that you}} can act as you do and be a philosopher, that you can eat, drink, be angry, be discontented, as you are now? You must watch, you must labor, you must get the better of certain appetites, must quit your acquaintances, be despised by your servant, be laughed at by those you meet; come off worse than others in everything—in offices, in honors, before tribunals. When you have fully considered all these things, approach, if you please—that is, if, by parting with them, you have <b>a</b> <b>mind</b> <b>to</b> purchase serenity, freedom, and tranquillity. If not, do not come hither; do not, like children, be now a philosopher, then a publican, then an orator, and then one of Caesar’s officers. These things are not consistent. You must be one man, either good or bad. You must cultivate either your own reason or else externals; apply yourself either to things within or without you—that is, be either a philosopher or one of the mob."

2500|$|The most {{pervasive}} rumors concerned Brown's ties to {{well known}} gangsters. Legend {{has it that}} he survived as a bootlegger during Prohibition in the United States. Another rumor was that before he came to Hollywood, {{he had been a}} bodyguard for a Detroit gangster. [...] He apparently knew Benjamin Bugsy Siegel, but not well. In the 1967 paperback We Only Kill Each Other: The life and bad times of Bugsy Siegel, includes an anecdote in which Brown and Siegel meet at Santa Anita and threaten to commit various degrees of mayhem on each other. Brown (described as a thin and wiry man) responds to Siegel's threat by saying,"I'm just as tough as you are, and I know your pals Frank Costello and Frank Nitti and I've got <b>a</b> <b>mind</b> <b>to</b> call 'em and report what you said."

2500|$|After sailing {{far enough}} for safety, Every gave the non-conspirators {{a chance to}} go ashore, even deferentially {{offering}} to let Captain Gibson command the ship if he would join their cause. According to Charles Ellms, Every's words to Gibson were, [...] "if you have <b>a</b> <b>mind</b> <b>to</b> make one of us, we will receive you; and if you turn sober, and attend to business, perhaps in time I may make you up of my lieutenants; if not, here's a boat, and you shall be set on shore." [...] The captain declined and was set ashore with several other sailors. The only man who was prevented from voluntarily leaving was the ship's surgeon, whose services were deemed too important to forgo. All of the men left on board the Charles II unanimously elected Every captain of the ship. Some reports say that Every was much ruder in his dealings with Captain Gibson, but agree that he at least offered him the position of second mate. In either case, Every exhibited an amount of gentility and generosity in his operation of the mutiny that indicates his motives were not mere adventure.|$|E
