5|$|This {{behavior}} is exploited in the Mond process for purifying nickel, <b>as</b> <b>described</b> <b>above.</b> The related nickel(0) complex bis(cyclooctadiene)nickel(0) {{is a useful}} catalyst in organonickel chemistry because the cyclooctadiene (or cod) ligands are easily displaced.|$|E
5|$|A {{supported}} {{lipid bilayer}} (SLB) <b>as</b> <b>described</b> <b>above</b> has achieved commercial {{success as a}} screening technique to measure the permeability of drugs. This parallel artificial membrane permeability assay PAMPA technique measures the permeability across specifically formulated lipid cocktail(s) found to be highly correlated with Caco-2 cultures, the gastrointestinal tract, blood–brain barrier and skin.|$|E

5|$|<b>As</b> <b>described</b> <b>above,</b> John Scannella {{had argued}} in 2010 that Nedoceratops should be {{considered}} a synonym of Triceratops. Andrew Farke (2011) maintained that it represents a valid distinct genus. Nick Longrich agreed with Scannella about Nedoceratops and made a further suggestion: that the recently described Ojoceratops was likewise a synonym. The fossils, he argued, are indistinguishable from the T. horridus specimens that were previously attributed to the defunct species T. serratus.|$|E
5|$|Broasting uses a {{pressure}} cooker {{to accelerate the}} process. The moisture inside the chicken becomes steam and increases the pressure in the cooker, lowering the cooking temperature needed. The steam also cooks the chicken through, but still allows the pieces to be moist and tender while maintaining a crisp coating. Fat is heated in {{a pressure}} cooker. Chicken pieces are prepared <b>as</b> <b>described</b> <b>above</b> and then placed in the hot fat. The lid {{is placed on the}} pressure cooker, and the chicken pieces are thus fried under pressure.|$|E

5|$|Deep frying {{requires}} a deep fryer or other device {{in which the}} chicken pieces can be completely submerged in hot fat. The process of deep frying is basically placing food fully in oil and then cooking it {{at a very high}} temperature. The pieces are prepared <b>as</b> <b>described</b> <b>above.</b> The fat is heated in the deep fryer to the desired temperature. The pieces are added to the fat and a constant temperature is maintained throughout the cooking process.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} use for phosphoryl chloride {{is in the}} manufacture of triarylphosphate esters (<b>as</b> <b>described</b> <b>above)</b> such as triphenyl phosphate and tricresyl phosphate. These esters have been used for many years as flame retardants and plasticisers for PVC. Meanwhile, trialkyl esters such as tributyl phosphate (made similarly from n-butanol) are used as liquid–liquid extraction solvents in nuclear reprocessing and elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|The most {{noteworthy}} {{reaction of}} TiCl4 is its easy hydrolysis, signaled by {{the release of}} hydrogen chloride {{and the formation of}} titanium oxides and oxychlorides, <b>as</b> <b>described</b> <b>above</b> for the production of TiO2. Titanium tetrachloride has been used to create naval smokescreens. The hydrogen chloride immediately absorbs water to form an aerosol of hydrochloric acid that efficiently scatter light. In addition, the highly refractive titanium dioxide is also an efficient light scatterer. This smoke is however corrosive.|$|E

30|$|The {{magnitude}} of such penalties would be informed by calculations such <b>as</b> those <b>described</b> <b>above,</b> i.e., by determining which generators benefit and by how much. By penalizing in this way, {{the motivation for}} deliberately false demand-attestations are disincentivized.|$|R
5|$|The motions <b>as</b> <b>described</b> <b>above</b> are simplifications. Due to the {{movement}} of Earth around the Earth–Moon center of mass, the apparent path of the Sun wobbles slightly, with {{a period of about}} one month. Due to further perturbations by the other planets of the Solar System, the Earth–Moon barycenter wobbles slightly around a mean position in a complex fashion. The ecliptic is actually the apparent path of the Sun throughout the course of a year.|$|E
5|$|These changes {{brought the}} {{customary}} rights of lay rulers such as John over ecclesiastical appointments into question. <b>As</b> <b>described</b> <b>above,</b> John {{had come to}} a compromise with Pope Innocent III in exchange for his political support for the King, and clause 1 of Magna Carta prominently displayed this arrangement, promising the freedoms and liberties of the church. The importance of this clause may also reflect the role of Archbishop Langton in the negotiations: Langton had taken a strong line on this issue during his career.|$|E
5|$|While the {{governmental}} {{system in the}} central and western part of Switzerland, <b>as</b> <b>described</b> <b>above,</b> is well documented, nothing of substance {{is known about the}} political and administrative system in eastern Raetia. However, records of the time show that a great number of local nobles held political and religious offices in Raetia, indicating that the Romans successfully co-opted the local elite.|$|E

30|$|The product {{distributions}} of the bio-oils were analyzed via GC/MS and GC/FID. Prior to each analysis, the bio-oil was diluted to approximately 60 – 70  wt% with ethanol.

5|$|During {{the reign}} of the Jiajing Emperor (r. 1521–1567), the native Chinese {{ideology}} of Daoism was fully sponsored at the Ming court, while Tibetan Vajrayana and even Chinese Buddhism were ignored or suppressed. Even the History of Ming states that the Tibetan lamas discontinued their trips to Ming China and its court at this point. Grand Secretary Yang Tinghe under Jiajing was determined to break the eunuch influence at court which typified the Zhengde era, an example being the costly escort of the eunuch Liu Yun <b>as</b> <b>described</b> <b>above</b> in his failed mission to Tibet. The court eunuchs were in favor of expanding and building new commercial ties with foreign countries such as Portugal, which Zhengde deemed permissible since he had an affinity for foreign and exotic people.|$|E
5|$|Photo{{synthesis}} is {{the synthesis}} of carbohydrates from sunlight and carbon dioxide (CO2). In plants, cyanobacteria and algae, oxygenic photosynthesis splits water, with oxygen produced as a waste product. This process uses the ATP and NADPH produced by the photosynthetic reaction centres, <b>as</b> <b>described</b> <b>above,</b> to convert CO2 into glycerate 3-phosphate, which can then be converted into glucose. This carbon-fixation reaction is {{carried out by the}} enzyme RuBisCO as part of the Calvin– Benson cycle. Three types of photosynthesis occur in plants, C3 carbon fixation, C4 carbon fixation and CAM photosynthesis. These differ by the route that carbon dioxide takes to the Calvin cycle, with C3 plants fixing CO2 directly, while C4 and CAM photosynthesis incorporate the CO2 into other compounds first, as adaptations to deal with intense sunlight and dry conditions.|$|E
5|$|The {{peak in the}} {{brightness}} just inside of the Amalthea's orbit and, therefore, the vertical asymmetry the Amalthea gossamer ring {{may be due to}} the dust particles trapped at the leading (L4) and trailing (L5) Lagrange points of this moon. The particles may also follow horseshoe orbits between the Lagrangian points. The dust may be present at the leading and trailing Lagrange points of Thebe as well. This discovery implies that there are two particle populations in the gossamer rings: one slowly drifts in the direction of Jupiter <b>as</b> <b>described</b> <b>above,</b> while another remains near a source moon trapped in 1:1 resonance with it.|$|E
50|$|Data {{assimilation}} {{methods are}} currently {{also used in}} other environmental forecasting problems, e.g. in hydrological forecasting. Basically, {{the same types of}} data assimilation methods <b>as</b> those <b>described</b> <b>above</b> are in use there. An example of chemical data assimilation using Autochem can be found at CDACentral.|$|R
