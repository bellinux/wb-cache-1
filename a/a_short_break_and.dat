After the publication of a dozen of his songs late the preceding year, Wolf once again desired to return to composing, and travelled to the vacation home of the Werners—family friends whom Wolf had known since childhood—in Perchtoldsdorf (a short train ride from Vienna), to escape and compose in solitude.

After a summer holiday, the Spanisches Liederbuch was begun in October 1889; though Spanish-flavoured compositions were in fashion in the day, Wolf sought out poems that had been neglected by other composers.|$|E

Wakeman thought the musical direction the band had begun to take ventured into [...] "avant-garde jazz rock, and I had nothing to offer there". Squire recognised [...] "a lot of substance" [...] to the four tracks, but at times there was not as much which made the album become [...] "too varied and too scattered". Despite their opinions, Anderson wrote in the liner notes that Squire, Wakeman and White made [...] "important contributions of their own" [...] to the music.

Howe recalled that despite the lengthy arrangements, no one [...] "bottled it" [...] and thought a single album would be more appropriate. White contributed some lengthy sections of music that bridged between the main sections of tracks, but did not receive a writing credit which bothered him at first, but later allowed it as the album was mostly Anderson and Howe's idea.|$|E
