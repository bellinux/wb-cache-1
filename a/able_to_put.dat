Despite not having had any formal {{instruction}} himself, he taught dance, including to such later stars as Gregory Hines and Ben Vereen. He also taught footwork to boxing greats Sugar Ray Robinson and Muhammad Ali. Less glamorously, he ran a café, and even worked as a carpenter and a mechanic.

With the help of Marge and Lisa, who spray water on the jockeys with a hose, Homer is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> the jockeys into a garbage bag and get them sent to the dump. Afterwards, Homer and Bart prepare for Duncan's retirement from racing {{to start a new}} life as a stud. President Clinton then shows up at the Simpsons's house to see Lisa, presenting her with a plaque. Clinton says that Ogdenville was wrong to use glowsticks and that Springfield Elementary's band is the true champion.|$|E
5|$|Both {{independent}} and major record labels {{bid for the}} right to release Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, including Artemis Records and Nonesuch Records. Tweedy denied the bids of record labels that did not have a roster of signed artists that matched his liking. He also decided to ignore small independent companies because he wanted to be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> the album out for a large audience and felt that they would be unable to produce more than 100,000 records. Wilco decided to sign with AOL Time Warner subsidiary Nonesuch Records in November 2001, basing the decision on the label's small size and artist-friendly atmosphere. In the end, Wilco recorded and produced Yankee Hotel Foxtrot with Reprise, received the rights to the album for free, and then sold it back to a different AOL Time Warner affiliate.|$|E

However, Griffin, by tracking through historical data, claims that the expectation fulfilment theory of dreaming provides a far more plausible explanation for two famous dreams interpreted by of Freud and Jung.|$|R

5|$|By then, the Pagan Empire, despite outward {{appearances}} of calmness, {{had been in}} long and slow decline since the early 13th century. The continuous growth of tax-free religious wealth had greatly reduced the tax base of the kingdom. The crown had lost resources needed to retain the loyalty of courtiers and military servicemen, inviting a vicious circle of internal disorders and external challenges. Although it was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> down the first batch of serious rebellions in 1258–60 in South Arakan and Martaban (Mottama), the decline continued. On {{the eve of the}} Mongol invasions, between one and two-thirds of Upper Burma's cultivable land had been donated to religion. The crown's ability to mobilize defenses was in serious jeopardy.|$|E
5|$|Electrical {{phenomena}} {{have been}} studied since antiquity, though progress in theoretical understanding remained slow until {{the seventeenth and eighteenth}} centuries. Even then, practical applications for electricity were few, and it would not be until the late nineteenth century that electrical engineers were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> it to industrial and residential use. The rapid expansion in electrical technology at this time transformed industry and society, becoming a driving force for the Second Industrial Revolution. Electricity's extraordinary versatility means it can be put to an almost limitless set of applications which include transport, heating, lighting, communications, and computation. Electrical power is now the backbone of modern industrial society.|$|E

The brief quiet that had resulted from {{the explosion of the}} Orient was broken by Franklins guns, and the battle resumed. She fought for another hour, but by then she had lost her main and mizzenmasts, nearly all of her cannons had been knocked out, and over half her crew were dead or wounded. She finally struck her colours.|$|E
50|$|Sharad Gogate {{retired from}} active book {{publishing}} in 2001 {{and turned to}} writing. All his writing has been about his passion - book publishing.His most notable writing is Marathi GranthPrakashanachi 200 Varshe (मराठी ग्रन्थप्रकाशनाची 200 वर्षे), which is a comprehensive study of first 200 years of Marathi Publishing from 1805 to 2005. This {{has been a very}} difficult work to complete and needed a lot of research. Not a whole lot of material was easily available and not many publishers of present day were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> help <b>to</b> <b>put</b> together the journey of Marathi publishing over the 200 years.

5|$|PerdiccasII {{sided with}} Sparta in the Peloponnesian War (431–404 BC) between Athens and Sparta, and in 429 BC Athens retaliated by persuading Sitalces to invade Macedonia, {{but he was}} forced to retreat owing to a {{shortage}} of provisions in winter. In 424 BC, Arrhabaeus, a local ruler of Lynkestis in Upper Macedonia, rebelled against his overlord Perdiccas, and the Spartans agreed to help in putting down the revolt. At the Battle of Lyncestis the Macedonians panicked and fled before the fighting began, enraging the Spartan general Brasidas, whose soldiers looted the unattended Macedonian baggage train. Perdiccas then changed sides and supported Athens, and he was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> down Arrhabaeus's revolt.|$|E
5|$|Tech {{played well}} also, {{especially}} on defense {{where they were}} able to create four turnovers including Thompson's first interception in 99pass attempts. Defensive back Antonio Huffman returned the pick 54yards for a touchdown and put the Red Raiders up 24–10 late in the second quarter. Texas Tech was able to capitalize on the other take-aways as well, turning them into 14more points and held the lead until the fourth quarter. Two missed field goals and a fired-up Sooner defense held the Red Raiders off, however, and the Sooners were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> the game away with a two-yard touchdown run by Brown.|$|E
5|$|The Elephant Man exhibit was {{moderately}} successful, {{and made}} money {{primarily from the}} sales of the autobiographical pamphlet.

The shop on Whitechapel Road was directly across the road from the London Hospital, an excellent location, as medical students and doctors visited the shop, curious to see Merrick. One visitor was a young house surgeon named Reginald Tuckett. Like his colleagues, Tuckett was intrigued by the Elephant Man's deformities and told his senior colleague Frederick Treves.|$|E
40|$|In {{praise of}} theology, because the 21 st century might be theological, if not religions. Because {{people might be}} waiting to speak again, giving them back their lost or {{forgotten}} intelligibility, of certain words which could perhaps hold {{one of the keys}} to our epoch the desires of which are obscure. Theology must be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> hope <b>to</b> <b>put</b> God back into mankind's time. One of the humanities among others, theology might remind us the laws of improbability.

5|$|Vermigli {{published}} {{an account of}} his disputation with Oxford Catholics over the Eucharist in 1549, along with a treatise further explaining his position. The disputation largely dealt with the doctrine of transubstantiation, which Vermigli strongly opposed, but the treatise was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> forward Vermigli's own Eucharistic theology. Vermigli's Eucharistic views, as expressed in the disputation and treatise, were influential in the changes to the Book of Common Prayer of 1552. Vermigli weighed in again on Eucharistic controversy in England in 1559. His Defense Against Gardiner was in reply to Stephen Gardiner's 1552 and 1554 Confutatio Cavillationum, itself a reply to the late Thomas Cranmer's work. At 821 folio pages, it was the longest work on the subject published during the Reformation period.|$|E

The Fourth Air Fleet, under the command of Field Marshal Wolfram von Richthofen, was able to regroup and increase the number of daily sorties from an average of 350 in January to 1,000 in February, providing German forces strategic air superiority. On 20 February, the Red Army was perilously close to Zaporizhia, signaling the beginning of the German counterattack, known to the German forces as the Donets Campaign.|$|E

5|$|Ace Attorney Investigations 2 was {{produced}} by Motohide Eshiro and directed by Takeshi Yamazaki, and features character designs by Tatsuro Iwamoto and music by Noriyuki Iwadare. Takuro Fuse, who would later become the character designer and art director for Ace Attorney, {{was in charge of}} the game's event images, and the opening and ending sequences to the episodes. While the original Ace Attorney Investigations had taken longer than usual for an Ace Attorney game to develop due to its several new gameplay systems that had to be created from scratch, Ace Attorney Investigations 2 went faster due to it already having a base game to build upon, resulting in the developers being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> more focus on the game's story. According to Eshiro and Yamazaki, one of the major changes compared to the first Ace Attorney Investigations was the addition of an interrogation game mechanic; they chose to present it metaphorically as a game of chess, which was Edgeworth's favorite game. Another such change was the graphical improvements to the game's sprites and background art.|$|E
5|$|During the battle, San Martino {{collided}} with Regina Maria Pia {{and had her}} ram bow twisted, causing leaks in her hull. Shortly thereafter, Persano broke off the engagement to consolidate his forces, but his ships, low on coal and ammunition, and with badly demoralized crews, could not be rallied by Persano's half-hearted attempt to launch an attack. The Italian fleet began to withdraw, followed by the Austrians; as night began to fall, the opposing fleets disengaged completely, heading for Ancona and Pola, respectively. San Martino had been hit numerous times, and had her side armor penetrated by one shell, which {{did not succeed in}} penetrating the timber backing. Twice during the engagement, the ship was set on fire by Austrian shells, though her crew was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> the fires out. After the battle, Vacca replaced Persano; he was ordered to attack the main Austrian naval base at Pola, but the war ended before the operation could be carried out.|$|E
