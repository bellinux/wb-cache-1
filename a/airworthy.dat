5|$|There are 54 Spitfires {{and a few}} Seafires in <b>airworthy</b> {{condition}} worldwide, {{although many}} air museums have examples on static display, for example, Chicago's Museum of Science and Industry has paired a static Spitfire with a static Ju 87 R-2/Trop. Stuka dive bomber.|$|E
5|$|The Deutsches Technikmuseum in Berlin has the {{wreckage}} of two complete aircraft that were recovered from separate crash sites near Murmansk in 1990 and 1994. These wrecks were purchased from New Zealand collector Tim Wallis, who originally planned for the remains to be restored to <b>airworthy,</b> in 1996.|$|E
5|$|The last Comet to fly, Comet 4C Canopus (XS235), is kept {{in running}} {{condition}} at Bruntingthorpe Aerodrome, where fast taxi runs are regularly conducted. Since the 2000s, various parties have proposed restoring Canopus, which is maintained by a staff of volunteers, to <b>airworthy,</b> fully flight-capable condition. The Bruntingthorpe Aerodrome also displays a related Hawker Siddeley Nimrod MR2 aircraft.|$|E
5|$|In June 2011, nine VH-71s were {{purchased}} for $164million by Canada {{for use as}} spare parts for its fleet of AgustaWestland CH-149 Cormorant search and rescue helicopter, which is also based upon the AW101. The transferred VH-71s were stripped of sensitive parts, a total of seven remained in an <b>airworthy</b> condition. In 2013, media reports stated Canada is studying whether up to four of the VH-71s can be certified for operational use; manufacturer AgustaWestland has openly stated {{their support for the}} regeneration initiative.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s orders declined, with a {{total of}} 76 Comet 4s being {{delivered}} from 1958 to 1964. In November 1965 BOAC retired its Comet 4s from revenue service, while other operators continued commercial passenger flights with the Comet until 1981. Dan-Air {{played a significant role in}} the fleet's later history and, at one time, owned all 49 remaining <b>airworthy</b> civil Comets. On 14 March 1997 a Comet 4C serial XS235 and named Canopus, which had been acquired by the British Ministry of Technology and used for radio, radar and avionics trials, made the last documented production Comet flight.|$|E
5|$|Since 1973, Duxford {{has held}} regular air shows. Duxford {{is the home}} of several private {{aviation}} companies, such as Classic Wings, The Fighter Collection, the Old Flying Machine Company and The Aircraft Restoration Company. Between them these companies provide pleasure flights, historic aircraft for film or television work, and aircraft restoration services. Perhaps the most notable privately owned and operated aircraft based at Duxford is B-17 Preservation Ltd's Sally B, the only <b>airworthy</b> B-17 Flying Fortress in Europe.|$|E
5|$|The Supermarine Spitfire is a British single-seat fighter {{aircraft}} {{that was used}} by the Royal Air Force and many other Allied countries before, during and after World War II. The Spitfire was built in many variants, using several wing configurations, and was produced in greater numbers than any other British aircraft. It was also the only British fighter to be in continuous production throughout the war. The Spitfire continues to be popular among enthusiasts; about 54 remain <b>airworthy,</b> while many more are static exhibits in aviation museums throughout the world.|$|E
5|$|Midway's radar {{picked up}} the enemy at a {{distance}} of several miles, and interceptors were scrambled. Unescorted bombers headed off to attack the Japanese carriers, their fighter escorts remaining behind to defend Midway. At 06:20, Japanese carrier aircraft bombed and heavily damaged the U.S. base. Midway-based Marine fighters led by Major Floyd B. Parks, which included 7 F4Fs and 21 F2As, intercepted the Japanese and suffered heavy losses, though they managed to destroy 4 B5Ns and at least 3 A6Ms. Within the first few minutes, 3 F4Fs and 13 F2As were destroyed, while most of the surviving U.S. planes were damaged, with only 2 remaining <b>airworthy.</b> American anti-aircraft fire was intense and accurate, destroying 4 additional Japanese aircraft and damaging many more.|$|E
5|$|All of BA's Concorde fleet {{have been}} grounded, drained of {{hydraulic}} fluid and their airworthiness certificates withdrawn. Jock Lowe, ex-chief Concorde pilot {{and manager of}} the fleet estimated in 2004 that it would cost £10–15million to make G-BOAF <b>airworthy</b> again. BA maintain ownership and have stated {{that they will not}} fly again {{due to a lack of}} support from Airbus. On 1 December 2003, Bonhams held an auction of British Airways Concorde artefacts, including a nose cone, at Kensington Olympia in London. Proceeds of around £750,000 were raised, with the majority going to charity. G-BOAD is currently on display at the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum in New York. In 2007, BA announced that the advertising spot at Heathrow where a 40% scale model of Concorde was located would not be retained; the model is now on display at the Brooklands Museum, in Surrey, England.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day saw 4th Regiment Hurricanes again patrolling over Bosnia, downing another Bf 110, this time over Banja Luka. One aircraft was destroyed on 13 April, the pilot being badly wounded. On 14 April, one Hurricane was still serviceable at Nikšić in Montenegro. This aircraft clashed with Italian fighters on 14 or 15 April and was hit 37 times. Despite this, {{it was still}} <b>airworthy</b> on 16 April when its pilot attempted to fly it to Greece, but {{he was forced to}} return due to poor weather, after which the aircraft was abandoned. At least two Hurricanes were captured intact by the invading forces, but this marked the end of the Hawker Hurricane in VVKJ service, as all opposition to the Axis invaders ceased on 18 April, following the Yugoslav Supreme Command's unconditional surrender the previous day.|$|E
5|$|On 11 April, 4th Regiment Hurricanes {{successfully}} {{shot down}} a Messerschmitt Bf 110 heavy fighter over Nova Gradiška. The following day, {{two or three}} of the remaining 105th Squadron Hurricanes were burned by ground crews at Veliki Radinci, while other machines from the same squadron flew to Bijeljina, where other aircraft had concentrated. This move had only just been completed when a large formation of German Bf 110s swept over the airfield and destroyed over two dozen aircraft, including {{all but one of the}} 105th Squadron Hurricanes. At Knić, approaching German vehicles caused the last two 163rd Squadron Hurricanes to scramble, flying to Zemun. The first pilot landed safely, but was immediately captured by armed Volksdeutsche. The other pilot, seeing that Zemun was not safe, broke off and tried to fly to Bjeljina, but ran out of fuel and was killed when he tried to crash-land near Valjevo. Even at this late stage, the 4th Regiment still had five or six <b>airworthy</b> Hurricanes. They continued to chase reconnaissance aircraft throughout the day, shooting down one Ju 88 near Banja Luka. When German bombers again attacked the airfields around Mostar, the one remaining Hurricane of the Air Training School attacked a Ju 88 but was hit by return fire, forcing the pilot to bail out.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the <b>airworthy</b> B-17s, others were used as planes visible at the airbase in the film, but not as the Memphis Belle. One example, B-17F-70-BO, Serial number 42-29782, {{is located at the}} Museum of Flight, Seattle, WA. Boeing Bee has been completely restored and is potentially <b>airworthy</b> once again.|$|E

25|$|The Spitfire {{was also}} the main {{aircraft}} used in the 1988 miniseries Piece of Cake. The series {{was based on a}} novel by the same name. Pilots in the novel flew the Hawker Hurricane, but the lack of <b>airworthy</b> Hurricanes forced the producers to change aircraft types, using five privately owned <b>airworthy</b> Spitfires and a collection of static and taxiing replicas.|$|E
