"'And it's you, you, who <b>are</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> this!' cried Tomassov in an {{extremity}} {{of gratitude}} that was hardly greater than {{his admiration for}} the generosity of his future foe.

Under those circumstances, what would otherwise be egotism becomes common and mutual.

6000|$|Being thus encouraged, {{and having}} already {{embarked}} in disingenuosity, our young gentleman, desiring to please his host, began at random a tale composed in {{great part of}} what he recollected of the story of Colonel Jack, seasoned occasionally with extracts from Mr. Smollett's ingenious novel of Ferdinand, Count Fathom. There was hardly a petty crime or a mean action mentioned in either of these entertaining fictions that he was not willing to attribute to himself. Meanwhile he discovered, to his surprise, that lying was not really so difficult an art as he had supposed it to be. His host listened for a considerable while in silence, but at last he was obliged to call upon his penitent to stop. [...] "To tell you the truth, Mr. What's-a-name," [...] he cried, [...] "I do not believe a single word you <b>are</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me.</b> However, I am satisfied that in you I have discovered, as I have every reason to hope, one of the most preposterous liars I have for a long time fell in with. Indeed, I protest that any one who can with so steady a countenance lie so tremendously as you have just done may be capable, if not of a great crime, at least of no inconsiderable deceit, and perhaps of treachery. If this be so, you will suit my purposes very well, though I would rather have had you an escaped criminal or a murderer or a thief." ...|$|E
