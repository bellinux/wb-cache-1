5|$|The Boulonnais {{provided}} part of {{the base}} for the Anglo-Norman breed, which was later to play {{a large role in}} the creation of the Selle Francais. It was also used in the creation and refinement of the Italian Heavy Draft, the post-World War II improvement of the Schleswig horse, and the creation of the early 19th-century Ardennes. Some equine scholars theorize that if the smaller Mareyeur had survived, it would have been an ideal horse to cross with the Thoroughbred or Anglo-Arabian to produce a warmblood for competition. In France, a breeding program has been developed by the National Stud to cross Boulonnais and Arabian horses to create a fast, alert driving horse, called the Araboulonnais. This breeding program also brings new blood into the Boulonnais line <b>as,</b> <b>if</b> <b>an</b> Araboulonnais mare is bred to a Boulonnais stallion, and a resulting filly is bred to another Boulonnais stallion, the third generation horse may be inducted into the purebred Boulonnais studbook if it passes an inspection.|$|E

25|$|The hype around The Grey Album {{caught the}} {{attention}} of Beatles' copyright holder EMI, who ordered Danger Mouse and retailers carrying the album to cease distribution. Music industry activist group Downhill Battle responded by coordinating Grey Tuesday, an electronic civil disobedience event held on 24 February 2004. Participating websites posted copies of The Grey Album for free download for a 24-hour period in protest of EMI's attempts to prevent distribution of the mashup on the grounds that sampling is fair use and that a statutory license should be provided in the same manner <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>an</b> artist were to perform or record a cover version of a song. Hundreds of web sites publicized the event with 170 hosting the album for download. Over 100,000 copies were downloaded on that day alone. The legal repercussions of the protest were minimal; a number of the participants received cease and desist letters from EMI, but no charges were filed in connection with the event.|$|E

[...] The rave reviews in the newspapers lifted Lawrence's spirits, and she expected a lengthy run as Anna, first on Broadway, then in London's West End, and finally on film. Lawrence won a Tony Award for her leading role, while Brynner won the award for best featured actor.

Fischer's win was an American victory in a field that Soviet players had dominated for the previous quarter-century; players closely identified with, and subsidized by, the Soviet state. Kasparov remarked, [...] "Fischer fits ideologically into {{the context of the}} Cold War era: a lone American genius challenges the Soviet chess machine and defeats it". Dutch grandmaster Jan Timman calls Fischer's victory [...] "the story of a lonely hero who overcomes an entire empire".

500|$|Following the game, however, {{controversy}} emerged about a silhouetted {{camera shot}} of Prince, projected against a large sheet by {{a bright light}} {{on the other side}} of the performer. The controversy centered around his guitar, which detractors claimed seemed phallic, and critics stating that it [...] "looked embarrassingly rude, crude and unfortunately placed." [...] Though the guitar has been considered by some an extension of a male player's sexuality (especially highlighted by such artists as Jimi Hendrix, Eddie Van Halen, and even Prince himself), supporters of Prince say that the show did not, in fact, become any more sexually charged than usual, noting that [...] "a guitar at waist level does look like an enormous phallus." [...] ABC late-night talk show Jimmy Kimmel Live! responded to this mild controversy by including two satirically pixelized Super Bowl clips on its weekly segment [...] "This Week in Unnecessary Censorship" [...] for the February 9, 2007 episode.

500|$|The Prussian {{infantry}} marched southward, remaining out of Austrian sight, {{behind a}} line of low hills. When {{the heads of the}} two superbly drilled Prussian columns—the distances between the marching platoons remaining exactly the width of each platoon's front—had passed the Austrian left flank, the columns veered left toward the enemy and continued their march until they had passed beyond the left Austrian flank. Then, on command, the platoons of the columns faced left at Lobetinz, and the whole Prussian army stood in line of battle, two to three men deep, at nearly a right angle to the weakest point of the Austrian left. Similarly, Hans Joachim von Zieten's cavalry had traversed the entire Austrian front, and positioned itself at a 45-degree angle to the Austrian flank. [...] The Prussian artillery perched the reverse slopes of the Butterberg, hidden from Austrian view but prepared to move to the crest to time their bombardment with the infantry's attack. The bulk of the repositioned Prussian army now faced the smallest component of the Austrian line. The one column of Prussian cavalry and the small reserve of infantry remaining at the Austrian far right continued to demonstrate in front of the Austrians, even moving further north, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>an</b> attack would occur at that position.|$|E

The film received negative reviews and was released as a Lifetime movie. She next appeared in the little-seen psychological thriller Stonehearst Asylum, loosely based on Edgar Allan Poe's short story. A lukewarm critical reception greeted the film upon its DVD release; Jeannette Catsoulis of The New York Times said Beckinsale was [...] "emoting <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>an</b> Oscar nomination depended on it" [...] while Dennis Harvey of Variety found her performance [...] "overwrought." [...] Also in 2014, she provided the voice for Queen Ayrenn, a character in The Elder Scrolls Online video game.

Tom Huddleston of Time Out said her character [...] "is never really developed—which is perhaps a blessing, because her cut-glass-posh performance is almost as grating as Pegg’s." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{reasons for}} the {{rebellion}} have {{been the source of}} much discussion and theories among modern scholars. Moving away from the personal relationship between al-Hajjaj and Ibn al-Ash'ath, Alfred von Kremer suggested that the rebellion was linked with the efforts of the non-Arab converts to Islam (the mawālī) to secure equal rights with the Arab Muslims. Julius Wellhausen rejected this view as the main source of the revolt, seeing it instead as a reaction of the Iraqis in general and the ashrāf in particular against the Syrian regime of the Umayyads as represented by the overbearing (and notably low-born) al-Hajjaj. Other scholars have seen in it a manifestation of the tribal factionalism between the northern Arab and southern Arab ("Yamani") tribal groups prevalent at the time. Thus a poem by a certain A'sha Hamdan in celebration of the rebellion shows not only a religious but also a tribal motivation of the rebel troops: al-Hajjaj is denounced as an apostate and a [...] "friend of the devil", while Ibn al-Ash'ath is portrayed as the champion of the Yamani Qahtani and Hamdani tribes against the northern Arab Ma'addis and Thaqafis. On the other hand, as G. R. Hawting points out, this is insufficient evidence to ascribe purely tribal motivations to the revolt: if Ibn al-Ash'ath's movement was indeed led largely by Yamanis, this simply reflects {{the fact that they were}} the dominant element in Kufa, and while al-Hajjaj himself was a northerner, his main commander was a southerner. Wellhausen's analysis, furthermore, ignored the evident religious dimension of the revolt, especially the participation of the fanatical zealots known as qurrāʾ ("Quran readers"). While the [...] "religious polemic used by both sides [...] is stereotyped, unspecific and to be found in other contexts", according to C. G. Hawting, there do appear to have been specific religious grievances, notably the accusation that the Umayyads were neglecting the ritual prayer. It seems [...] that the revolt began as a simple mutiny against an overbearing governor who made impossible demands of the troops, but, at least by the time the army reached Fars, a religious element had emerged, represented by the qurrāʾ. Given the close [...] "interaction of religion and politics in early Muslim society", as G. R. Hawting points out, the religious element quickly became dominant, as seen by the difference between the oath of allegiance (bayʿa) sworn at the beginning of the revolt and that exchanged between the army and Ibn al-Ash'ath at Istakhr in Fars. While in the first Ibn al-Ash'ath declared as his intention to [...] "depose al-Hajjaj, the enemy of God", in the latter, he exhorted his men to [...] " [...] the Book of God and the Sunna of His Prophet, to depose the imāms of error, to fight against those who regard [...] as licit". Although Ibn al-Ash'ath remained as the head of the uprising, Veccia Vaglieri writes that after this point [...] "one has the impression that [...] the control of the revolt slipped from his hands", or that, as Wellhausen comments, [...] "he was urged on in spite of himself, and even if he would, could not have banished the spirits which he had called up. It was <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>an</b> avalanche came rushing down sweeping every thing before it".|$|E

2500|$|Following {{a period}} of non-recognition from the media, gay men have been {{presented}} in the media in a stereotypical feminine way, which is open to ridicule [...] (as well as lesbians and transvestites).

A newer portrayal of gay men in the LGBT community is as bears—a sub-culture of gay men who celebrate rugged masculinity and [...] "secondary sexual characteristics of the male: facial hair, body hair, proportional size, baldness". Smyth (2004) identified four classic stereotypes of gay men as effeminate, mentally ill, predatory or libido-driven maniacs; these stereotypes arrived in popular discourse during different time periods. This is significant, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>an</b> individual does not interact with LGBT people on a regular basis, they may rely on the mass media for information on LGBT people and LGBT issues and thus retain these stereotypes.|$|E
