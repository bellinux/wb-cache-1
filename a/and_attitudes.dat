40|$|Background: According to {{the high}} {{prevalence}} of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) in developing countries as well as high treatment expenses for patients and health-care systems, CVDs prevention in such societies has a great importance. One {{of the most effective}} strategies is improvement of knowledge <b>and</b> <b>attitude</b> towards the CVDs risk factors. This study aimed to evaluate the knowledge <b>and</b> <b>attitude</b> of females on CVDs risk factors and also the relationship between knowledge <b>and</b> <b>attitude</b> with obesity indices and biochemical parameters. Methods: This cross-sectional study was performed on 89 women with the age range of 11 to 67 y old and body mass index (BMI) of 24 to 51 kg/m 2. Participants were interviewed face to face using a valid questionnaire in order to evaluate their knowledge <b>and</b> <b>attitude</b> on CVDs risk factors. Blood sampling was implemented after 12 h of overnight fasting. Fasting blood glucose (FBG) and lipid profile were assessed by enzymatic methods. Anthropometric measurements were performed and obesity indices were calculated. Results: More than 70 % of participants had moderate or good knowledge <b>and</b> <b>attitude</b> about CVDs risk factors. Participant's knowledge <b>and</b> <b>attitude</b> had a significant positive association with educational level and a significant reverse relationship with age, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and obesity indices. Conclusions: Results of this study indicated that knowledge <b>and</b> <b>attitude</b> levels on CVDs risk factors affect the obesity indices and metabolic profile. Hence, knowledge <b>and</b> <b>attitude</b> enhancement is the main target and initial step in improving life quality and preventing cardiovascular diseases...|$|R

5|$|A person's {{experience}} in managing sexuality after the injury relies {{not only on}} physical factors like severity and level of the injury, but on aspects of life circumstances and personality such as sexual experience <b>and</b> <b>attitudes</b> about sex. As well as evaluating physical concerns, clinicians {{must take into account}} factors that affect each patient's situation: gender, age, cultural, and social factors. Aspects of patients' cultural and religious backgrounds, even if unnoticed before the injury caused sexual dysfunction, affect care and treatments—particularly when cultural attitudes and assumptions of patients and care providers conflict. Health professionals must be sensitive to issues of sexual orientation and gender identity, showing respect and acceptance while communicating, listening, and emotionally supporting. Providers who treat SCI have been found to assume their patients are heterosexual or to exclude LGBTQ patients from their awareness, potentially resulting in substandard care. Academic research on sexuality and disability under-represents LGBTQ perspectives as well.|$|E
40|$|An {{integrated}} orbit <b>and</b> <b>attitude</b> {{control algorithm}} for satellite formation flying was developed, and an integrated orbit <b>and</b> <b>attitude</b> software-in-the-loop (SIL) simulator was also developed to test and verify the integrated control algorithm. The integrated algorithm includes state-dependent Riccati equation (SDRE) control algorithm and PD feedback control algorithm as orbit <b>and</b> <b>attitude</b> controller respectively <b>and</b> configures the two algorithms with an integrating effect. The integrated SIL simulator largely comprises an orbit SIL simulator for orbit determination <b>and</b> control, <b>and</b> <b>attitude</b> SIL simulator for <b>attitude</b> determination <b>and</b> control. The two SIL simulators were designed considering {{the performance and}} characteristics of related hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulators and were combined into the integrated SIL simulator. To verify the developed integrated SIL simulator with the integrated control algorithm, an orbit simulation and integrated orbit <b>and</b> <b>attitude</b> simulation were performed for a formation reconfiguration scenario using the orbit SIL simulator and the integrated SIL simulator, respectively. Then, the two simulation results were compared and analyzed with each other. As a result, the user satellite in both simulations achieved successful formation reconfiguration, {{and the results of}} the integrated simulation were closer to those of actual satellite than the orbit simulation. The integrated orbit <b>and</b> <b>attitude</b> control algorithm verified in this study enables us to perform more realistic orbit control for satellite formation flying. In addition, the integrated orbit <b>and</b> <b>attitude</b> SIL simulator is able to provide the environment of easy test and verification not only for the existing diverse orbit or attitude control algorithms but also for integrated orbit <b>and</b> <b>attitude</b> control algorithms...|$|R

The radical {{leadership of the}} party could never escape the suspicion that Hanoi had designs on building an Indochinese federation with the North Vietnamese as its master. The Khmer Rouge were ideologically tied to the Chinese, while North Vietnam's chief supporters, the Soviet Union, still recognized the Lon Nol government as legitimate. After {{the signing of the}} Paris Peace Accords, PAVN cut off the supply of arms to the Khmer Rouge, hoping to force them into a cease-fire. When the Americans were freed by the signing of the accords to turn their air power completely on the Khmer Rouge, this too was blamed on Hanoi.
