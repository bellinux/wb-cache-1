The United States also pressed Israel to apologize. Israel rebuffed demands by both Turkey and the US.|$|E

25|$|When {{actively}} fishing, the angler {{may want}} to keep the fly line lightly pressed against the rod handle with the index finger of the casting arm.

25|$|When a horse collects, {{more weight}} {{moves to the}} hindquarters. Collection is natural for horses and is often seen during pasture play. A {{collected}} horse can move more freely. The joints of the hind limbs have greater flexion, allowing the horse to lower the hindquarters, bringing the hind legs further under the body, and lighten <b>and</b> <b>lift</b> <b>the</b> forehand. In essence, collection is the horse's ability to move its centre of gravity to the rear.|$|E
25|$|In {{his essay}} What Is Oblomovshchina? Nikolay Dobrolyubov {{provided}} an ideological {{background for the}} type of Russia's 'new man' exposed by Goncharov. The critic argued that, while several famous classic Russian literary characters – Onegin, Pechorin, and Rudin – bore symptoms of the 'Oblomov malaise', for the first time one single feature, that of social apathy, a self-destructive kind of laziness and unwillingness to even try <b>and</b> <b>lift</b> <b>the</b> burden of all-pervading inertia, had been brought to the fore and subjected to a thorough analysis.|$|E

25|$|Minimum {{wages are}} used widely in {{developing}} countries to protect vulnerable workers, reduce wage inequality, <b>and</b> <b>lift</b> <b>the</b> working poor out of poverty. The political popularity of minimum wages stems {{in part from the}} fact that the policy offers a means for redistributing income without having to increase government spending or establish formal transfer mechanisms. The challenge to policymakers is to find that wage level that is considered fair given workers' needs and the cost of living, but does not harm employment or a country's global competitiveness.|$|E
25|$|The {{feeding method}} of tadpole shrimps {{is similar to}} that {{proposed}} for the ancestral crustacean. The anterior appendages (second pair to tenth pair) stir sediments and swirl muddy water into the wide, midventral food groove. The gnathobases (inward-facing lobes {{at the base of the}} leg) guide food anteriorly to the mouth. The large flat exopods (outward-facing lobes at the end of the leg) stir <b>and</b> <b>lift</b> <b>the</b> sediments. Fine silt particles and water escape easily, but large, coarse food particles are torn into smaller pieces by the blade-like, inward-facing lobes called endopods at the end of the leg.|$|E
25|$|In 1536, Francis I {{invaded the}} Duchy of Savoy, against {{the advice of}} Montmorency, staking claim to the lands of the duchy but also to {{pressure}} Charles V to give Milan back to him. Charles V invaded Provence from Northern Italy in retaliation. Francis appointed Montmorency, who had now retired from the court, to be the governor of Languedoc, the lieutenant general in the southeast of France and they led the defence of Provence using scorched earth tactics. Montmorency evacuated Aix-en-Provence and concentrated his forces near Avignon. By the early autumn Charles V had been forced to retreat his army to Genoa <b>and</b> <b>lift</b> <b>the</b> siege of Marseille.|$|E

25|$|Metal {{tumbling}} {{is used to}} burnish, deburr, clean, radius, de-flash, descale, remove rust, polish, brighten, surface harden, prepare {{parts for}} further finishing, and break off die cast runners. The process is fairly simple: a horizontal barrel {{is filled with the}} parts which is then rotated. Variations of this process usually include media, water, or other lubricants. As the barrel is rotated the material rises until gravity causes the uppermost layer to landslide down to the other side. The barrel may also have vanes, typically made of rubber, which run along the inside of the barrel. As the barrel turns the vanes catch <b>and</b> <b>lift</b> <b>the</b> parts, which eventually slide down or fall.|$|E
25|$|The Wei regent Sima Shi summoned Yu Song (虞松) to seek {{his opinion}} {{on how to}} deal with the Wu and Shu incursions in the east and west respectively. Yu Song {{analysed}} the situation and said that the defences at Hefei were strong enough to resist the Wu attack for some time and that the Wu forces would eventually withdraw once they lost momentum. He suggested that they launch a swift counterattack on the Shu invaders to catch them off guard and drive them back. Sima Shi agreed and ordered Guo Huai and Chen Tai to lead the Wei forces stationed in the Guanzhong region to attack Jiang Wei <b>and</b> <b>lift</b> <b>the</b> siege on Didao. Chen Tai attacked the enemy at Luomen (洛門; in present-day Wushan County, Gansu). Jiang Wei eventually pulled out his troops when they ran out of food supplies.|$|E
25|$|Nadal {{began his}} clay court {{season with a}} quarterfinal loss to David Ferrer in the Monte-Carlo Masters. He was stunned by Nicolas Almagro in {{the quarterfinals of the}} Barcelona Open. Nadal won his 27th masters (a record at the time) at the Madrid Open after Kei Nishikori retired in the third set. On 8 June 2014, Nadal {{defeated}} Novak Djokovic in the Men's Singles French Open final to win his 9th French Open title and a 5th straight win at Roland Garros. Nadal dropped the first set but came back to win the next three sets <b>and</b> <b>lift</b> <b>the</b> trophy. Nadal equaled Pete Sampras' total of 14 Grand Slam wins, the second highest number of single Grand Slam titles for a male player, after Roger Federer.

25|$|Burns v. Hickenlooper is {{a lawsuit}} filed on July 1, 2014, in federal {{district}} court in Colorado, challenging that state's denial of marriage rights to same-sex couples. The plaintiffs' complaint alleged that the defendants have violated the Fourteenth Amendment by denying plaintiffs the fundamental right of marriage. The defendants agreed with {{the substance of the}} plaintiffs' case, but asked the district court to stay implementation of any order requiring Colorado to alter enforcement of its ban pending the outcome of other litigation. After the district court declined to grant more than a one-month stay on July 23, the state's governor and attorney general appealed and won a stay from the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals on August 21. Following U.S. Supreme Court action in other cases, on October 8 they asked the Tenth Circuit to dismiss their appeal <b>and</b> <b>lift</b> <b>the</b> stay, which would effectively legalize same-sex marriage in Colorado.|$|E
25|$|Barrett {{was talking}} to the second engineer, Mr. Hesketh, when the red light and bells came on {{signalling}} the order to stop the engines. He shouted to the men in the boiler room to shut the dampers, the doors to the furnaces and to shut off the wind for the fires. Then he felt a crash and water came pouring in on him from a large tear in the ship's starboard side. Barrett made his way through the water tight door into boiler room 5. He was ordered to go back into boiler room 6, but there was 8 feet of water there. As some of the engineers attended the pumps, the engine room rang for all the stokers to go up on deck. Barrett was ordered to stay behind by an engineer, Mr. Harvey, in boiler room 5 to get some lamps, draw fires, <b>and</b> <b>lift</b> <b>the</b> manhole plate until water started to rush in.|$|E
25|$|Seeing {{the smaller}} ship {{directly}} in front of him, the French captain spread all sail and threw Minerve forwards, attempting to ram Dido amidships. If the attack had been successful, Dido would likely have been crushed by the weight of the larger frigate, but Towry was able to respond by throwing the wheel hard to port and turning away from the blow. The frigates were so close that Minerves bowsprit became tangled in the rigging of Didos mizenmast. The effect was to throw Dido hard against Minerves starboard bow <b>and</b> <b>lift</b> <b>the</b> smaller ship almost out of the water, her weight suspended from Minerves bowsprit. Covered by cannon fire from the forward 18-pounder long guns and heavy musketry, the French crew attempted to scramble along the bowsprit and onto Didos deck, the boarding action prevented by sailors armed with pikes. The attack was dangerous, wave action causing the suspended Dido to slam repeatedly against the hull of Minerve, and at approximately 9:00 the bowsprit finally snapped under the strain, fatally plunging at least eight French sailors attempting to board Dido into the gap between the ships. It also dislodged Didos mizenmast, which collapsed.|$|E
