500|$|Diocletian, {{acclaimed}} emperor on November 20, 284, was {{a religious}} conservative, {{faithful to the}} traditional Roman cult. Unlike Aurelian (r. 27075), Diocletian did not foster any new cult of his own. He preferred older gods, Olympian gods. Nonetheless, Diocletian did wish to inspire a general religious revival. As the panegyrist to Maximian declared: [...] "You have heaped the gods with altars and statues, temples and offerings, which you dedicated with your own name <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> image, whose sanctity is increased by the example you set, of veneration for the gods. Surely, men will now understand what power resides in the gods, when you worship them so fervently." [...] As part of his plans for revival, Diocletian invested in religious construction. One quarter of all inscriptions referring to temple repairs in North Africa between 276 and 295 date to Diocletian's reign. Diocletian associated himself {{with the head of}} the Roman pantheon, Jupiter; his co-emperor, Maximian, associated himself with Hercules. This connection between god and emperor helped to legitimize the emperors' claims to power and tied imperial government closer to the traditional cult.|$|E

By 11:30, Desert Column staff considered that the 53rd (Welsh) Division was practically stationary, and the following message was sent to Dallas: [...] "I am directed to observe that (1) you have been out of touch with Desert Column <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> headquarters for over two hours; (2) no gun registration appears to have been carried out; (3) that time is passing, and that you are still far from your objective; (4) that the Army and Column Commanders are exercised at the loss of time, which is vital; (5) you must keep a general staff officer at your headquarters who can communicate with you immediately; (6) you must launch your attack forthwith."

To dig in your own day <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> community is harder..."(114) A monthly poetry magazine is praised as one [...] "which did not scorn poets because they happened {{to live in the}} country in which it was published."(244) ...|$|E
2500|$|In September 1769 Garrick staged the Shakespeare Jubilee in Stratford-upon-Avon. It {{was a major}} {{focal point}} in the {{emerging}} movement that helped cement Shakespeare as England's national poet. It involved a number of events held in the town to celebrate (five years too late) 200 years since Shakespeare's birth. In a speech made {{on the second day}} of the Jubilee in Stratford Garrick recognized the Shakespeare Ladies Club as those who [...] "restor'd Shakespeare to the Stage," [...] protecting his fame and erecting [...] "a Monument to his <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> honour in Westminster Abbey." [...] No Shakespeare plays were performed during the Jubilee, and heavy rain forced a Shakespeare Pageant to be called off. The Pageant was first staged a month later at Drury Lane Theatre under the title The Jubilee and proved successful enjoying 90 performances. The song [...] "Soft Flowing Avon" [...] was composed by Thomas Arne, with lyrics by Garrick, for the Jubilee.|$|E

2500|$|Throughout Paul's rise to superhuman status, {{he follows}} a plotline common to many stories {{describing}} {{the birth of}} a hero. He has unfortunate circumstances forced onto him. After a long period of hardship and exile, he confronts and defeats the source of evil in his tale. As such, Dune is representative of a general trend beginning in 1960s American science fiction in that it features a character who attains godlike status through scientific means. Eventually, Paul Atreides gains a level of omniscience which allows him to take over the planet and the galaxy, and causing the Fremen of Arrakis to worship him like a god. Author Frank Herbert said in 1979, [...] "The bottom line of the Dune trilogy is: beware of heroes. Much better [...] rely on your own judgment, <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> mistakes." [...] He wrote in 1985, [...] "Dune was aimed at this whole idea of the infallible leader because my view of history says that mistakes made by a leader (or made in a leader's name) are amplified by the numbers who follow without question." ...|$|E
2500|$|Due {{to their}} low social status and {{language}} barrier, Korean Americans received very {{little if any}} aid or protection from police authorities. David Joo, a manager of the gun store, said, [...] "I {{want to make it}} clear that we didn't open fire first. At that time, four police cars were there. Somebody started to shoot at us. The LAPD ran away in half a second. I never saw such a fast escape. I was pretty disappointed." [...] Carl Rhyu, a participant in the Korean immigrants' armed response to the rioting, said, [...] "If it was your own business <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> property, would you be willing to trust it to someone else? We are glad the National Guard is here. They're good backup. But when our shops were burning we called the police every five minutes; no response." [...] At a shopping center several miles north of Koreatown, Jay Rhee, who estimated that he and others fired five hundred shots into the ground and air, said, [...] "We have lost our faith in the police. Where were you when we needed you?" [...] Koreatown was isolated from South Central Los Angeles, yet despite such exclusion it was the heaviest hit.|$|E
2500|$|The Bible {{does not}} command wearing {{of a unique}} prayer shawl or tallit. Instead, it presumes that people wore a garment of some type to cover {{themselves}} and instructs the Children of Israel to attach fringes ( [...] tzitzit) to the corners of these (Numbers 15:38), repeating the commandment in terms that they should [...] "make thee twisted cords upon {{the four corners of}} thy covering, wherewith thou coverest thyself" [...] (Deuteronomy 22:12). These passages do not specify tying particular types or numbers of knots in the fringes. The exact customs regarding the tying of the tzitzit and the format of the tallit are of post-biblical, rabbinic origin and, though the Talmud discusses these matters, slightly different traditions have developed in different communities. However the Bible is specific as to the purpose of these tzitzit, stating that [...] "it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and remember all the commandments of the LORD, and do them; and that ye go not about after your own heart <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> eyes, after which ye use to go astray; that ye may remember and do all My commandments, and be holy unto your God" [...] (...)

2500|$|Kant had {{distinguished}} theoretical from practical reason. Rationality theorist [...] Jesús Mosterín makes {{a parallel}} distinction between {{theoretical and practical}} rationality, although, according to him, reason and rationality are not the same: reason would be a psychological faculty, whereas rationality is an optimizing [...] strategy. Humans are not rational by definition, but they can think and behave rationally or not, depending on whether they apply, explicitly or implicitly, the strategy of theoretical and practical rationality to the thoughts they accept and to the actions they perform. Theoretical rationality has a formal component that reduces to logical consistency and a material component that reduces to empirical support, relying on our inborn mechanisms of signal detection and interpretation. [...] Mosterín distinguishes between involuntary and implicit belief, on the one hand, and voluntary and explicit acceptance, on the other. Theoretical rationality can more properly be said to regulate our acceptances than our beliefs. Practical rationality is the strategy for living one’s best possible life, achieving your most important goals <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> preferences in as far as possible. Practical rationality has also a formal component, that reduces to Bayesian decision theory, and a material component, rooted in human nature (lastly, in our genome).|$|E
