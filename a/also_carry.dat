5|$|In {{addition}} to carrying passengers and their luggage, Greyhound buses <b>also</b> <b>carry</b> packages. Through Greyhound Package Express customers can book expedited cargo shipping door-to-door or station-to-station. The company says that shipping by bus offers a cost-effective alternative to other ground or air carriers for same-day delivery.|$|E
5|$|The nerves <b>also</b> <b>carry</b> sensory {{information}} from the mucous membranes of the larynx below the lower surface of the vocal fold, as well as sensory, secretory and motor fibres to the cervical segments of the esophagus and the trachea.|$|E
5|$|Though {{their effects}} on human populations are often devastating, {{tropical}} cyclones can relieve drought conditions. They <b>also</b> <b>carry</b> heat energy away from the tropics and transport it toward temperate latitudes, which may {{play an important role}} in modulating regional and global climate.|$|E
50|$|Starting {{with the}} 2005 season, MLB Home Plate was {{launched}} on XM Satellite Radio. XM <b>also</b> <b>carries</b> every major league game. Games are <b>also</b> <b>carried</b> on MLB Gameday Audio.|$|R
5000|$|Originally {{the station}} <b>also</b> <b>carried</b> ABC as a {{secondary}} affiliation until 1969 when KSEL-TV (now KAMC) became the local primary ABC affiliate. The station <b>also</b> <b>carried</b> an affiliation with DuMont {{during the early}} 1950s.|$|R
50|$|Arroyo <b>also</b> <b>carried</b> most of {{the provinces}} {{including}} her home province of Pampanga. Other candidates <b>also</b> <b>carried</b> their home provinces such as Angara of Aurora (and Quezon), Tatad of Catanduanes and Sueno of South Cotabato.|$|R
5|$|Although {{rail freight}} levels are far down {{compared}} to their height, significant quantities of cargo are also carried {{into and out of}} London by rail; chiefly building materials and landfill waste. As a major hub of the British railway network, London's tracks <b>also</b> <b>carry</b> large amounts of freight for the other regions, such as container freight from the Channel Tunnel and English Channel ports, and nuclear waste for reprocessing at Sellafield.|$|E
5|$|Red-billed choughs can <b>also</b> <b>carry</b> mites, but a {{study of}} the feather mite Gabucinia delibata, {{acquired}} by young birds a few months after fledging when they join communal roosts, suggested that this parasite actually improved the body condition of its host. It is possible that the feather mites enhance feather cleaning and deter pathogens, and may complement other feather care measures such as sunbathing, and anting—rubbing the plumage with ants (the formic acid from the insects deters parasites).|$|E
5|$|Tabinshwehti was not satisfied, {{and planned}} an {{invasion}} of Siam itself. By October 1548, he had assembled another 12,000-strong force that also included about 400 Portuguese mercenaries led by Diogo Soares. The invasion force would have been equipped with the conventional weapons of the day: swords, bow and arrows and spears. The more elite members would <b>also</b> <b>carry</b> matchlocks or muskets. These early modern weapons having been introduced to the two kingdoms by the Portuguese a few decades earlier.|$|E
50|$|Balloons <b>also</b> <b>carried</b> mail out of Paris and Metz {{during the}} Franco-Prussian War (1870), {{drifting}} {{over the heads}} of the Germans besieging those cities. Balloon mail was <b>also</b> <b>carried</b> on an 1877 flight in Nashville, Tennessee.|$|R

5|$|The Shivalik-class frigates are {{equipped}} {{with a mix of}} Russian, Indian and Israeli weapon systems. These include the 76mm Otobreda naval gun, Klub and BrahMos supersonic anti-ship missiles, Shtil-1 anti-aircraft missiles, RBU-6000 anti-submarine rocket launchers and 6–324mm ILAS 3 (2 triple)torpedoes. A 32 cell VLS launched Barak SAM and AK-630 act as Close-in weapon systems (CIWS). The ships <b>also</b> <b>carry</b> two HAL Dhruv or Sea King Mk. 42B helicopters.|$|E
5|$|The {{previous}} Causeway {{had carried}} electric trams, {{and it was}} expected that the new Causeway would <b>also</b> <b>carry</b> trams, or perhaps trolleybuses instead. However, the proposed overhead wires were deemed too ugly for the new bridge, and between £30,000 and £40,000 could be saved by using buses instead. The routes using the Causeway were replaced with bus services, but the bridges as constructed were nonetheless designed to be able to carry trams.|$|E
5|$|With no {{above ground}} remains, the exact {{location}} of the abbey had been lost, and so in the 1840s, the editor of the Leicester Chronicle, James Thompson, tried, and failed, to attempt to locate the abbey church. In the 1850s the Leicester Architectural and Archaeological Society would <b>also</b> <b>carry</b> out excavations, but also failed to locate the abbey. Prior to the 9th Earl of Dysart's donation of the abbey precinct, another attempt was undertaken, but again, no trace of the abbey was found.|$|E
50|$|WNET {{is carried}} {{in all of}} Mercer County, New Jersey on Comcast, Cablevision and Verizon FIOS.

5|$|For {{the light}} attack role, the RAH-66 {{was to be}} {{furnished}} with various armaments. It was equipped with a single 20mm three-barrel XM301 Gatling gun, which was fixed underneath the nose section. In addition, the RAH-66 was capable of internally carrying a maximum of six AGM-114 Hellfire air-to-ground missiles or up to twelve AIM-92 Stinger air-to-air missiles, which would be evenly divided between a pair of retractable weapons pylons. Beyond the internal munitions stowage, the Comanche could <b>also</b> <b>carry</b> up to four Hellfire missiles or a maximum of eight Stinger missiles externally, set upon on each of its stub wings; however, operations performing with any armaments mounted externally would unavoidably resulted in a reduction {{of the effectiveness of}} the rotorcraft's stealth technologies.|$|E
5|$|Gene {{transfer}} between species {{includes the}} formation of hybrid organisms and horizontal gene transfer. Horizontal gene transfer is the transfer of genetic material from one organism to another organism that is not its offspring; this is most common among bacteria. In medicine, this contributes {{to the spread of}} antibiotic resistance, as when one bacteria acquires resistance genes it can rapidly transfer them to other species. Horizontal transfer of genes from bacteria to eukaryotes such as the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the adzuki bean weevil Callosobruchus chinensis has occurred. An example of larger-scale transfers are the eukaryotic bdelloid rotifers, which have received a range of genes from bacteria, fungi and plants. Viruses can <b>also</b> <b>carry</b> DNA between organisms, allowing transfer of genes even across biological domains.|$|E
5|$|Halo {{departs from}} {{traditional}} FPS conventions by not forcing the player character to holster its firearm before deploying grenades or melee-range blunt instruments; instead, both attacks can be utilized while a gun is still equipped, supplanting or supplementing small-arms fire. All weapons {{may be used}} to bludgeon enemies, which allows Master Chief to silently kill opponents without alerting other nearby enemies. The Chief can <b>also</b> <b>carry</b> up to eight grenades at a time: up to four fragmentation and four plasma grenades each. Like the game's other weapons, the two types of grenades differ; the fragmentation grenade bounces and detonates quickly, whereas the plasma grenade adheres to targets before exploding, sometimes with blackly comic results.|$|E

5|$|Kubera {{is often}} {{depicted}} as a dwarf, with complexion of lotus leaves and a big belly. He is described as having three legs, only eight teeth, one eye, and being adorned with jewels. He is sometimes depicted riding a man. The description of deformities like the broken teeth, three legs, three heads and four arms appear only in the later Puranic texts. Kubera holds a mace, a pomegranate or a money bag in his hand. He may <b>also</b> <b>carry</b> a sheaf of jewels or a mongoose with him. In Tibet, the mongoose is considered a symbol of Kubera's victory over Nāgas—the guardians of treasures. Kubera is usually depicted with a mongoose in Buddhist iconography.|$|E
5|$|Polar {{bears are}} the iconic symbol of Svalbard, {{and one of}} the main tourist attractions. The animals are {{protected}} and people moving outside the settlements are required to have appropriate scare devices to ward off attacks. They are also advised to <b>also</b> <b>carry</b> a firearm for use as a last resort. A British schoolboy was killed by a polar bear in 2011. Svalbard and Franz Joseph Land share a common population of 3,000 polar bears, with Kong Karls Land being the most important breeding ground.|$|E
5|$|The male {{calls from}} near the nest site in spring to {{proclaim}} ownership and attract a mate. He may <b>also</b> <b>carry</b> nest material into the nest hole. The display and nest building is repeated in autumn. The preferred locations for the autumn display are old Eurasian tree sparrow nests, particularly those where nestlings had hatched. Empty nest boxes, and sites used by house sparrows or other hole nesting birds, such as tits, pied flycatchers or common redstarts, are rarely {{used for the}} autumn display.|$|E

5|$|The {{party has}} access to mecha, which can be {{equipped}} by surrendering a turn. Mecha have their own set of moves and boast more powerful attacks than the main party, but <b>also</b> <b>carry</b> over damage between battles. Following the victory, the party is awarded with in-game currency {{which can be used}} to purchase items and accessories at shops. The party is also awarded experience points which raise a character's experience level, along with a variety of skill points. These are divided into EP to fuel Ether abilities, along with Skill Points (SP) and Tech Points (TP). SP are assigned to activate passive effects drawn from different accessories, while Tech Points raise the effectiveness and power of Tech attacks unlocked as the character's experience level rises.|$|E
5|$|The player's craft has {{a limited}} amount of armour, which is {{depleted}} as the helicopter is hit by enemy fire. Should armour reach zero, the craft will be destroyed, costing the player a life. The player must outmanoeuvre enemies to avoid damage, but can replenish armour by means of power-ups or by airlifting rescued friendlies or captives to a landing zone. Vehicles have a finite amount of fuel which is steadily depleted as the level progresses. Should the fuel run out, the vehicle will crash, again costing the player a life. The craft can refuel by collecting fuel barrels. Vehicles <b>also</b> <b>carry</b> limited ammunition, which must be replenished by means of ammo crates.|$|E
5|$|The rituals {{performed}} at the statue by pregnant women involved walking round three times, reciting charms and touching one's abdomen. Women would <b>also</b> <b>carry</b> a band which would either be touched to the statue and then tied around their waist, or half of the band would be tied to the statue while the remaining half would be kept on the woman's body until the child was born. After the childbirth, the basin {{in front of the}} statue was used by women to bathe in. The rites performed in the honour of the statue were said to be similar to those performed by Phoenicians in the worship of their Venus.|$|E
