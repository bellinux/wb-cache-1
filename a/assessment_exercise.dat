40|$|The current recessionary {{economic}} climate in Ireland has (re-) awakened a neoliberal agenda {{that is changing}} the dynamic {{of what is being}} valued within research <b>assessment</b> <b>exercises,</b> specifically across Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences (AHSS) disciplines in higher education. Research <b>assessment</b> <b>exercises</b> in AHSS disciplines now place a greater emphasis on measuring performance in terms of quantitative research metrics (such as: bibliometrics, impact factors and/or citation indices), in an attempt to demonstrate greater accountability and value-for-money within this age of austerity. This practice has the potential to impact negatively on the quality and diversity of research, {{as well as on the}} independence and autonomy of those undertaking AHSS research in Ireland and elsewhere. This article critically reviews research <b>assessment</b> <b>exercises,</b> with particular reference to the assessment of educational research in Ireland. It examines issues in the assessment of research within the neoliberal agenda that is evident in Ireland, and elsewhere. For example, in other jurisdictions, the neoliberal drive for accountability has been accompanied by an increase in 2 ̆ 7 citation clubs 2 ̆ 7, a malpractice involving a group of researchers consistently citing each other 2 ̆ 7 s work to increase their citation index. It also challenges the validity of utilising predominantly quantitative research metrics in light of the recent move towards the online publication of research, where the manipulation of meta-data (key words that describe the research) has the potential to unfairly increase the citation indices of those researchers with a better understanding of search optimisation techniques within online contexts. The discussion concludes by summarising some of the emerging and emergent anxieties in relation to assessing research performance within <b>assessment</b> <b>exercises...</b>|$|R

40|$|The social {{practice}} {{of design and}} design research is continually evolving {{to meet the needs}} of society. Its representation and evaluation in research <b>assessment</b> <b>exercises,</b> such as the UK (Research Excellence Framework) REF 2014 [1] has a key role to play in its evolution. Higher education curriculum is affected by this type of representation due to the alignment of academic research inquiry. This paper examines through a documentary analysis of the REF 2014, the {{practice of}} funding evaluation exercises to discover and describe how they work and to provide a critique of those practices, using critical discourse analysis. By using Fairclough’s[2] three dimensional framework for examining discursive events, it is possible to explore the “relationships of causality and determination”[2] between discursive practices (the evaluation and subsequent funding of UK Higher Education research) and texts (REF 2014) and the wider social and cultural structures and processes which are influencing and being influenced by it. The analysis reveals the considerable influence of REF 2014 in the discourses of other stakeholders and the dominance within those discourses of market system structures where accountability, public relations and intense competition are fundamental to their operation. It raises questions about the nature of research <b>assessment</b> <b>exercises,</b> their ability to reward a diverse range of research in a fair and equitable manner and the impact of research <b>assessment</b> <b>exercises</b> on research inquiry, academic freedom and originality in universities...|$|R

Of course bringing about change is intended in the sense of increasing research quantity, enhancing its quality, etc. However, there are suggestions that by changing the conditions of knowledge production, research <b>assessment</b> <b>exercises</b> may also alter the shape and direction of disciplines by diverting and channelling researchers’ intellectual attention and political engagement, influencing what they study, how they do it, and how they report and write (Beck and Yong, 2005; Bernstein, 2000) ...|$|R
