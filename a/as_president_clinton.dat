During Clinton's term, Arkansas performed its first executions since 1964 (the death penalty had been re-enacted on March 23, 1973). As Governor, he oversaw four executions: one by electric chair and three by lethal injection.

500|$|Clark {{started the}} bombings codenamed Operation Allied Force on March 24, 1999, on orders {{to try to}} enforce U.N. Resolution 1199 {{following}} Yugoslavia's refusal of the Rambouillet Agreement. However, critics note that Resolution 1199 was a call for cessation of hostilities and does not authorize any organization to take military action. Secretary of Defense William Cohen felt that Clark had powerful allies at the White House, such <b>as</b> <b>President</b> <b>Clinton</b> and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who allowed him to circumvent The Pentagon in promoting his strategic ideas. Clark felt, however, {{that he was not}} being included enough in discussions with the National Command Authority, leading him to describe himself as [...] "just a NATO officer who also reported to the United States". This command conflict came to a ceremonial head when Clark was not initially invited to a summit in Washington, D.C., to commemorate NATO's 50th anniversary, despite being its supreme military commander. Clark eventually secured an invitation to the summit, but was told by Cohen to say nothing about ground troops, and Clark agreed.|$|E
500|$|Clark began {{planning}} {{work for}} {{responses to the}} war in Bosnia and Herzegovina upon his appointment in 1994 as the Director, Strategic Plans and Policy (J5) on the JCS staff. While collecting information to outline military options for resolving the conflict, Clark met with Bosnian Serb military leaders including Ratko Mladić, who was later accused of war crimes and genocide. Clark was photographed exchanging hats with Mladić, and the photo drew controversy in the United States. A Washington Post story was published claiming Clark had made the visit despite a warning from the U.S. ambassador. Some Clinton administration members privately said the incident was [...] "like cavorting with Hermann Göring." [...] Clark listed the visit in the itinerary he submitted to the ambassador, but he learned only afterwards that it was not approved. He said there had been no warning and no one had told him to cancel the visit, although two Congressmen called for his dismissal regardless. Clark later said he regretted the exchange, and the issue was ultimately resolved <b>as</b> <b>President</b> <b>Clinton</b> sent a letter defending Clark to the Congress and the controversy subsided. Clark said it was his [...] "first experience in the rough and tumble of high visibility... and a painful few days." [...] Conservative pundit Robert Novak later referred to the hat exchange in a column during Clark's 2004 presidential campaign, citing it as a [...] "problem" [...] with Clark as a candidate.|$|E

5000|$|In 1992, as {{a presidential}} candidate, Bill Clinton pledged to [...] "end {{welfare as we know}} it" [...] by {{requiring}} families receiving welfare to work after two years. <b>As</b> <b>president,</b> <b>Clinton</b> was attracted to welfare expert and Harvard University Professor David Ellwood’s proposal on welfare reform and thus Clinton eventually appointed Ellwood to co-chair his welfare task force. Ellwood supported converting welfare into a transitional system. He advocated providing assistance to families for a limited time, after which recipients would be required to earn wages from a regular job or a work opportunity program. Low wages would be supplemented by expanded tax credits, access to subsidized childcare and health insurance, and guaranteed child support.|$|E
