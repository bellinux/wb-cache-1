The results show that the CARS, which can be administered both face-to-face and by mail questionnaire, is an easy to administer, comprehensive, reliable, hierarchical, and valid measure for <b>assessing</b> <b>disability</b> in older people. By integrating previously developed scales measuring different domains of disability (ADL, IADL, and mobility) and the use of a four-category response format, an accurate and detailed measure of disability can be obtained and a broader range of needs of subjects can be described. The GARS manual, including detailed procedures for administration and scoring, encourages unambiguous administration and interpretation which results in more comparable research outcomes.

Method: All survivors of gestational age < 31 weeks or birth weight < 1500 g, born in 1994 to women resident in Wales were identified. Assessments were {{by a single}} observer at a median corrected age of 28. 3 months and included the Health Status Questionnaire and a Griffiths develop-mental test. Outcome was also described according to criteria for disability used in three published studies. Results: There were 297 survivors of which 279 (94 %) were assessed.

Aims: To investigate the aspects physicians consider in <b>assessing</b> work <b>disability</b> in cancer survivors, their experiences related to the use of guidelines and their needs related to the use of a prediction rule that aims to support work disability assessments. Methods: A qualitative study involving three consecutive focus group interviews, using a predetermined topic list. The interviews were recorded, transcribed and independently analysed using standard procedures of thematic analysis. Results: The 29 participating physicians reported feeling responsible primarily for making correct assessments of cancer survivors' work disability, in which they predominantly investigate medical factors. Secondarily, non-medical factors related to the person, their work and/or their social environment were considered. Adherence to guidelines aiming to support physicians making such assessments was variable. Conclusions: In <b>assessing</b> work <b>disability</b> among cancer survivors on long-term sick leave, physicians considered medical and non-medical factors.

40|$|Abstract: When the Canadian {{record on}} {{disability}} policy-making is reviewed a déjà vu discourse is clearly evident. <b>Assessing</b> <b>disability</b> policy reform over recent decades evokes {{a strong sense}} {{that we have been}} here before in terms of the problems identified and the promises made. From interviews with disability community leaders and documentary analysis, five explanations for this frustrating pace of reform over the last 25 years are examined. These are public attitudes and the lack of information; the relative powerlessness of the disability community; the constraints of economic thinking and public finances; federal-provincial jurisdictional issues; and the absence of robust accountability mechanisms for disability policy within Canada’s welfare state. Drawing on Fou-cault’s concept of governmentality, the article argues that governance arrangements and discursive techniques, and not only programs and benefits, need to be the focus of advocacy and scrutiny by the disability movement and by scholars in disability studies.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Chondrocalcinosis is {{frequently}} associated with osteoarthritis. The role of osteoarthritis in the onset and progression of disability is well known. The impact of chondrocalcinosis on disability {{has never been}} investigated in epidemiological studies. METHODS: Progetto Veneto Anziani is a survey of 3099 older Italians, focusing on chronic diseases and disability. Assessment was by questionnaires, physical performance tests and clinical evaluations. Chondrocalcinosis was determined by x-ray readings of 1629 consecutive subjects. Knee and hip osteoarthritis severity was evaluated by summing the radiographic features score (RFS) assigned during x-ray reading. RESULTS: SUBJECTS: with chondrocalcinosis were older and more frequently women (age-adjusted p< 0. 0001). The gender association disappeared following adjustment for osteoarthritis severity. However, at the knee, the prevalence of osteoarthritis was higher in chondrocalcinosis patients independently of age and sex (age-adjusted p< 0. 0001). No difference was found between chondrocalcinosis and controls in sociodemographic variables and comorbidity. Knee chondrocalcinosis was strongly associated with clinical features of knee osteoarthritis and with disability assessment parameters in the bivariate analysis. Most associations remained after adjusting for age. After further adjustment for RFS, a significant association remained for knee deformity and pain, {{the need for a}} cane, difficulty walking 500 m, using a toilet, shopping and repeatedly rising from a chair.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To be able {{to measure}} {{disability}} objectively in rheumatoid arthritis complicated by cervical myelopathy. METHODS: The responses to the Stanford health assessment questionnaire disability index were recorded from 250 consecutive patients (group 1) referred to our unit for spinal surgery. Using principal components analysis the questionnaire was reduced from 20 questions to 10 questions. In {{the second part of}} the study, the results of the questionnaire for those patients undergoing surgery from the original group of 250 patients were analysed with respect to outcome. RESULTS: The reduction in the number of questions results in no significant loss of information, reliability (internal consistency Cronbach's alpha = 0. 968) or sensitivity. The new scale, the myelopathy disability index, measures only one dimension (Eigen value 6. 97) and may be more finely tuned to the measurement of disability in these myelopathic patients. When administered to the 194 patients undergoing cervical spine (group 2) surgery the myelopathy disability index was an accurate predictor of neurological and functional outcome, as well as survival following surgery (P < 0. 0001). CONCLUSIONS: The myelopathy disability index provides a much needed objective and reliable means of <b>assessing</b> <b>disability</b> in patients with rheumatoid involvement of the cervical spine and also in predicting outcome following surgical intervention. It also provides information for both the patient and surgeon alike, on what to realistically expect from surgery.

40|$|OBJECTIVES—To {{review the}} outcome {{measures}} {{commonly used in}} phase III treatment trials of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and to introduce a method of data analysis which is clinically appropriate for the often reversible disability {{in this type of}} multiple sclerosis.  METHODS—The conventional end point measures for disability change are inadequate and potentially misleading. Those using the disability difference between study entry and completion do not take into account serial data or disease fluctuations. Rigid definitions of "disease progression" based on two measurements of change in disability several months apart, do not assess worsening after the defined "end point", nor the significant proportion of erroneous "treatment failures" which result from subsequent recovery from relapses that outlast the end point. Assessing attacks merely by counting their frequency ignores the variation in magnitude and duration. These problems can be largely circumvented by integrating the area under a disability-time curve (AUC), a technique which utilises all serial measurements at scheduled visits and during relapses to summarise the total neurological dysfunction experienced by an individual patient on any particular clinical scale during a study period.  CONCLUSIONS—The "summary measure" statistic AUC incorporates both transient and progressive disability into an overall estimate of the dysfunction that was experienced by a patient during a period of time. It is statistically more powerful and clinically more meaningful than conventional methods of <b>assessing</b> <b>disability</b> changes, particularly for trials which are too short to expect to disclose major treatment effects on irreversible disability in patients with a fluctuating disease. ...|$|E

Methods During a 5 -month period we performed a prospective study in which we included every patient with stable IC, who visited our vascular surgery outpatient clinic and consented to participate. Forty consecutive patients filled in the Dutch VascuQol, the ALDS, and Short Form- 36 (SF- 36). Twenty patients filled in the same questionnaires after 4 weeks. Internal reliability consistencies were expressed as Cronbach's alpha. Test-retest reliability was expressed as intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). Construct validity was expressed as Spearman rho correlations between SF- 36 and relevant domains of Dutch VascuQol and the ALDS. Results Internal reliability consistencies were, respectively, good and excellent for the total scores of VascuQol, SF- 36, and ALDS (Cronbach's alpha. 0. 87, 0. 89, and 0. 92). Test-retest reliability was excellent for the total VascuQol scores [ICC 0. 91 (95 % CI, 0. 78 - 0. 96) ], and for the ALDS [ICC 0. 90 (95 % CI, 0. 76 - 0. 96) ].
