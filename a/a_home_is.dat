This was the first film where Woo used the dove symbolism and he has used it to similar effect in Hard Target and Face/Off. A cat appears when Ah Jong first meets Jennie on her visit home, and secondarily when Li's partner Tsang tries to catch Ah Jong in Jennie's apartment. In Chinese culture, a cat coming into <b>a</b> <b>home</b> <b>is</b> an omen of ruin and poverty for its inhabitants. Both Tsang and Jennie meet negative outcomes in the film.|$|E

25|$|Trick-or-treating {{typically}} happens between 5:30pm and 9:30pm on October 31, {{although some}} municipalities choose other dates. Homeowners wishing {{to participate in}} it sometimes decorate their private entrances with artificial spider webs, plastic skeletons and jack-o-lanterns. Some rather reluctant homeowners would simply leave the candy in bowls on the porch, others might be more participative and would even ask an effort from the children {{in order to provide}} them with candy. In more recent years, however, the practice has spread to almost any house within a neighbourhood being visited by children, including senior residences and condominiums. Although people decorate their homes for Halloween, when homes would like to participate in handing out candy, a porch light is usually left on to signify that <b>a</b> <b>home</b> <b>is</b> handing out candy.|$|E
25|$|Homelessness is the {{condition}} of people without a permanent dwelling, such as a house or apartment. People who are homeless are most often unable to acquire and maintain regular, safe, secure and adequate housing. The legal definition of homeless varies from country to country, or among different jurisdictions in the same country or region. The term homeless may also include people whose primary night-time residence is in a homeless shelter, a domestic violence shelter, long-term residence in a motel, a vehicle, squatting, cardboard boxes, a tent city, tarpaulins, shanty town structures made of discarded building materials or other ad hoc housing situations. According to the UK homelessness charity Crisis, <b>a</b> <b>home</b> <b>is</b> not just a physical space: it also provides roots, identity, security, {{a sense of belonging}} and a place of emotional wellbeing. American government homeless enumeration studies also include people who sleep in a public or private place not designed for use as a regular sleeping accommodation for human beings. There are a number of organizations who provide help for the homeless.|$|E
500|$|Klepacki {{has also}} played in and {{produced}} albums for several Las Vegas bands. I AM's There's <b>a</b> <b>Home</b> <b>is</b> his first full-length CD appearance. The band featured Greg Greer on vocals, Rod Arnett on bass, Dan Ryan on guitar, and Klepacki on drums. Formed from the rhythm section of local band Shatterbone, I AM released one album in 1995 and broke up. Described as alternative progressive rock, the band's music drew influences from Tool and Soundgarden. The song Destructible Times {{was used for}} the Brotherhood of Nod ending in the original Command & Conquer. After the break-up, Klepacki joined Home Cookin', a ten-member ensemble which played funk and soul in the tradition of Tower of Power. Founded in 1989, Home Cookin' commercially debuted with Mmm, Mmm, Mmm, in 1997 (which featured a number one hit) and released a second album (Pink in the Middle) in 2000 before disbanding following a tour in California. Towards the end of its run, the band played at Quark's Bar in [...] and at the Boston Grill and Bar. The group sometimes opened shows with a four-member funk act named Junkfood. Home Cookin' was popular by readers of Las Vegas Weekly, winning several awards over its history—including [...] "Best Horns" [...] in a band. Klepacki boasted that turnout for the band at clubs was usually above four hundred people. In 2003, he formed The Bitters, a trio composed of Klepacki, bassist Vinny Moncada, and guitarist Jeff Murphy. With a style described as metal and jazz fusion, the group has released one album as of August 2006. Klepacki is also member to the group Mo Friction, supported by former Home Cookin' members. Their debut album will mark Klepacki's first outing as a band's lead vocalist.|$|E

2500|$|Theoretical pricing models {{must take}} into account the link between {{interest}} rates and loan prepayment speed. Mortgage prepayments are usually made because <b>a</b> <b>home</b> <b>is</b> sold or because the homeowner is refinancing to a new mortgage, presumably with a lower rate or shorter term. Prepayment is classified as a risk for the MBS investor {{despite the fact that they}} receive the money, because it tends to occur when floating rates drop and the fixed income of the bond would be more valuable (negative convexity). In other words, the proceeds received would need to be reinvested at a lower interest rate. Hence the term [...] prepayment risk.|$|E
2500|$|Radon is an invisible, {{radioactive}} atomic {{gas that}} results from the radioactive decay of radium, which {{may be found in}} rock formations beneath buildings or in certain building materials themselves. [...] Radon is probably the most pervasive serious hazard for indoor air in the United States and Europe, probably responsible {{for tens of thousands of}} deaths from lung cancer each year. There are relatively simple test kits for do-it-yourself radon gas testing, but if <b>a</b> <b>home</b> <b>is</b> for sale the testing must be done by licensed person in some U.S. states. Radon gas enters buildings as a soil gas and is a heavy gas and thus will tend to accumulate at the lowest level. Radon may also be introduced into a building through drinking water particularly from bathroom showers. Building materials can be a rare source of radon, but little testing is carried out for stone, rock or tile products brought into building sites; radon accumulation is greatest for well insulated homes. The half life for radon is 3.8 days, indicating that once the source is removed, the hazard will be greatly reduced within a few weeks. Radon mitigation methods include sealing concrete slab floors, basement foundations, water drainage systems, or by increasing ventilation. They are usually cost effective and can greatly reduce or even eliminate the contamination and the associated health risks.|$|E
