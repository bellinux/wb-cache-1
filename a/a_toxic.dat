40|$|Variations in arsenic (As) {{species in}} Panax notoginseng grown under field {{conditions}} remain understudied compared with those under greenhouse conditions. In the present study, soil and plant samples were collected from Wenshan Zhuang and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan Province, which is the main production area of P. notoginseng in China, to identify As species in the soil and plant tissues and further assess effect of <b>As</b> <b>toxic</b> stress on <b>As</b> transformation and translocation in P. notoginseng. The results showed that arsenate (As(V)) was almost exclusively identified in the soil, while arsenite (As(III)) and monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) were detected in high proportions in plant tissues, suggesting that As(V) could be reduced and subsequently methylated in the plant body, mainly in the root. The reduction and methylation of As in the root of P. notoginseng were promoted by low <b>As</b> <b>toxic</b> stress, but were impeded by high <b>As</b> <b>toxic</b> stress. Arsenic(III) and MMA could rapidly translocate upwards in P notoginseng. In addition, the translocation of total As, As(III), and MMA from the root to the rhizome {{was a response to}} <b>As</b> <b>toxic</b> stress, and the translocation rate increased with the increasing As concentration in the taproot. This study provides new insights into the detoxification mechanism of P. notoginseng grown in As contaminated soils and the control of As during cultivation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V.

5|$|Although many natural toxins are {{secondary}} metabolites, these poisons {{also include}} peptides and proteins. An example of <b>a</b> <b>toxic</b> peptide is alpha-amanitin, which {{is found in}} relatives of the death cap mushroom. This is a potent enzyme inhibitor, in this case preventing the RNA polymerase II enzyme from transcribing DNA. The algal toxin microcystin is also a peptide and is an inhibitor of protein phosphatases. This toxin can contaminate water supplies after algal blooms and is a known carcinogen that can also cause acute liver hemorrhage and death at higher doses.|$|E

That is roughly 16 mL of 50% ethylene glycol for an 80kg adult and 4 mL for a 20kg child. Poison control centers often use more than a lick or taste in a child or more than a mouthful in an adult as a dose requiring hospital assessment.|$|E

5|$|This {{species is}} a {{mycorrhizal}} fungus, {{widespread in the}} Americas and Europe. It can grow either singly, scattered, or in groups. It prefers habitats like coniferous and mixed forests and alongside paths, where it fruits in summer and fall. It is <b>a</b> <b>toxic</b> mushroom that has muscarine, the same toxin as Amanita muscaria and Amanita pantherina {{as well as many}} species in the Clitocybe and Inocybe genera. It is often confused with various other European species. A.gemmata resembles the false death cap, tawny grisette and panther cap mushrooms. Its cap is brighter in color than the former, and more yellow than the latter two.|$|E
5|$|Type II {{systems are}} {{organised}} in operons with the antitoxin protein typically being located upstream of the toxin. The antitoxin inhibits the toxin by downregulating its expression.

5|$|Evolve {{features}} {{five different}} modes: Hunt, Nest, Rescue, Defend and Arena, which have different objectives {{for both the}} Hunters and the Monster. Evolve provides two different structures to these game modes: Quick Play, which starts a single playthrough match; and Evacuation, {{which serves as a}} five-match, multiplayer story mode. In Evacuation, each match gives the winning side an advantage in the next map, such as having <b>a</b> <b>toxic</b> gas the Monster is immune to, or autonomous gun turrets to assist the Hunters. The Evacuation mode ends with a 'Defend' match. Evolve also features an Observer Mode, allowing players to watch a match without playing in the match. The spectator can jump between cameras and view the match from both the Hunters' and the Monster's perspectives.|$|E
5|$|Excessive {{production}} of the thyroid hormones is called hyperthyroidism, which is most commonly a result of Graves' disease, <b>a</b> <b>toxic</b> multinodular goitre, a solitary thyroid adenoma, or inflammation. Other causes include drug-induced excess of iodine, particularly from amiodarone, an antiarrhythmic medication; an excess caused by the preferential uptake of iodine by the thyroid following iodinated contrast imaging; or from pituitary adenomas which may cause an over{{production of}} thyroid stimulating hormone. Hyperthyroidism often causes a variety of non-specific symptoms including weight loss, increased appetite, insomnia, decreased tolerance of heat, tremor, palpitations, anxiety and nervousness. In some cases it can cause chest pain, diarrhoea, hair loss and muscle weakness. Such symptoms may be managed temporarily with drugs such as beta blockers.|$|E
