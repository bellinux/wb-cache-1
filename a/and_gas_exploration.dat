25|$|Mining which {{includes}} mostly oil <b>and</b> <b>gas</b> <b>exploration</b> and production in Houston accounts for 11 percent the region's GAPdown from 21 percent {{as recently as}} 1985. The reduced role {{of oil and gas}} in Houston's GAP reflects the rapid growth of other sectorssuch as engineering services, health services, and manufacturing. Oil <b>and</b> <b>gas</b> <b>exploration</b> and production, however, has increased in reaction to high energy prices and a reduced worldwide surplus oil production capacity.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. To {{satisfy the}} {{requirements}} of the oil <b>and</b> <b>gas</b> <b>explorations</b> in harsh conditions, an inclinometer based on dynamic tuning gyroscopes was developed. This inclinometer has remarkable temperature and pressure resistance which can be operated under with temperature higher than 175 C and pressure greater than 120 MPa. The azimuth angle error is less than 1 and the error of elevation angle is less than 0. 06. The results of in situ test indicated that this system is can meet {{the requirements of the}} oil <b>and</b> <b>gas</b> <b>explorations</b> which needs the azimuth error 2 ≤ ± and slope angle error 0. 5 ≤ ± and is feasible for practical use...|$|R

25|$|There may be {{locations}} in the Sea of Okhotsk where right whales can reliably be found in summer. In the Sea of Okhotsk, the right whales are currently distributed far from shore {{in the southern part}} of the sea. The Sea is mainly Russian territorial waters, so Russian cooperation is required for any surveys. The remoteness of the location and the enormous demand for ships and aircraft associated with oil <b>and</b> <b>gas</b> <b>exploration</b> near Sakhalin Island, make any ship or aerial surveys difficult and expensive.|$|E

25|$|Sodium {{chloride}} {{is heavily}} used, so even relatively minor applications can consume massive quantities. In oil <b>and</b> <b>gas</b> <b>exploration,</b> salt {{is an important}} component of drilling fluids in well drilling. It is used to flocculate and increase the density of the drilling fluid to overcome high downwell gas pressures. Whenever a drill hits a salt formation, salt is added to the drilling fluid to saturate the solution in order to minimize the dissolution within the salt stratum. Salt is also used to increase the curing of concrete in cemented casings.|$|E
25|$|In 1919, Colter issued first {{mortgage}} {{bonds for}} $250,000, using 16,135 acres of his ranch as collateral, including 7,500 acres which were cultivated and irrigated, {{in order to}} pay off debts he had accumulated during his campaign for the governorship, as well as to provide him with extra funds to use on the ranch.

25|$|Galluccio {{presented}} an investment program on June 5, 2012, to increase oil exploration by tenfold <b>and</b> <b>gas</b> <b>exploration</b> by twenty-fold, {{with the goal}} of raising production of oil and gas by 6% annually and of refined fuel by over 7% annually over five years. The US$39 billion plan would be largely self-financed, as well as by investments from Chevron Corporation and the periodic issuance of high-yield, 8.75% corporate bonds. These bond issuances were raised to US$1.5 billion per series in April 2015, as demand surged to US$4 billion.|$|E
