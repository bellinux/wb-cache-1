"Thinking {{back to when}} we met and {{the many}} times that we spent {{together}} and whenever we were out together, {{there would be a}} caption of some kind, and the caption usually said something like 'an odd couple' or 'an unlikely pair,' but to us it was the most natural and easiest of friendships....

500|$|The {{stubborn}} defence of {{the garrison}} irritated the khagan, who blamed his Soghdian allies for claiming {{that there were}} [...] "fifty donkeys in this (town) <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> take it in five days, but now the five days have become two months". At length, the khagan resumed negotiations, and offered safe-conduct for either Dabusiyya or Samarkand, which were still in Arab hands. The garrison sent a rider to Samarkand to ask for advice, and was told to choose Dabusiyya, which was closer to Kamarja. After fifty-eight days, out of which, according to al-Tabari, the garrison [...] "did not water their camels for thirty-five days", the siege was over. The Arabs and Turgesh exchanged five hostages each, including one of Suluk's most important nobles, Kursul. After the mutual massacre of captives early in the siege, the Arabs' mistrust was such that they refused to leave until the khagan and his army had departed, and an Arab with a dagger in his hand was seated behind each of the Turgesh hostages, who wore no armour.|$|E

2500|$|Lilly {{has stated}} that future books will each reveal a new Squickerwonker {{character}} and unique vice, which will eventually become the undoing of the character. The illustrator for the book is Johnny Fraser-Allen of Weta Workshop, a New Zealand-based concept design firm that worked on films including The Hobbit. Lilly stated that {{the goal was to}} [...] "make a book that {{we would like to have}} read as children <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> still enjoy as adults today".|$|E
2500|$|... "All {{our people}} being {{gathered}} together, we held a council together, to leave off drinking {{for the space}} of four years, and we all in general agreed to it, taking into consideration the ill consequences that attend it and what disturbance it makes, and that two of our brothers, the Mingoes, {{lost their lives in}} our towns by rum, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> live in peace and quietness and become another people...The proposal of stopping the rum and all strong liquors was made to the rest [...] in the winter, and they were all willing. As soon as it was concluded of, all the rum that was in the Towns was all staved and spilled, belonging both to Indians and white people, which in quantity consisted of about forty gallons, that was thrown in the street, and we have appointed four men to stave all the rum or strong liquors that is brought to the Towns hereafter, either by Indians or white men, during the four years. We would be glad if our brothers would send strict orders that we might prevent the rum coming to the hunting cabins or to the neighboring towns. We have sent wampum to the French, to the Five Nations, to the Delaware...to tell them not to bring any rum to our towns, for we want none...so we would be glad if our brothers would inform the traders not bring any for we are sorry, after they have brought it a great way, for them to have it broke, and when they're once warned they will take care." ...|$|E

60|$|The fellow begged again <b>and</b> again <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> relieve {{him from}} his bonds so he might walk around, {{promising}} to be as obedient to our orders as was Horry Sims; but I knew him too well to put any trust in his words.|$|R

2500|$|Melchior Wańkowicz, {{a popular}} Polish journalist, met Beck {{in the autumn}} of 1939 during his {{internment}} in Romania. This is how he described the meeting: [...] "Beck was locked in a golden cage of a luxurious hotel in Brașov, where he and his entourage occupied one floor. He was closely guarded: whenever he went out, hordes of Allied, German and Romanian agents followed him (...) I met him at 5 in the afternoon, and our conversation continued until almost two in the morning, with a dinner break. Beck emphasized achievements of the last month of his post: a military treaty with England, Hungarian refusal to let German troops pass through their territory, droit de residence and droit de passage, granted by Romanian government. Beck believes in a solid coalition, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> sit at a negotiating table as partners, while Czechs would remain outside. He does not care about the fact that Lloyd George stated that Poland did not deserve help as a reactionary country. He is not bothered by the fact that Lord Halifax wants to recreate the Curzon Line. Instead, he points out that when British king gave a speech on the radio, only English, French and Polish anthems were played (...) Since I cannot tolerate this kind of wishful thinking, I ask him whether he had ever seriously considered German attack. He keeps saying that he had met Hitler several times, that Hitler backs out of discussions, that he can easily be talked into different things, that he was influenced by von Ribbentrop." ...|$|E
2500|$|Crazy Horse {{attempted}} to rescue American Horse and his family. Indians who escaped Mills’ early morning assault {{spread the word}} to nearby Lakota and Cheyenne camps, and informed Crazy Horse, Sitting Bull and other leaders they were attacked by 100-150 soldiers. [...] Crazy Horse immediately assembled 600-800 warriors and rode about ten miles northward to rescue Chief American Horse and recover ponies and supplies. During the afternoon Chief American Horse {{and some of the}} squaws informed Gen. Crook, through the scouts, that Crazy Horse was not far off, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> certainly be attacked before nightfall. “In anticipation of that afternoon tea party which was promised to be given by Crazy Horse, Crook deployed his forces to give that chieftain the surprise of his life. [...] Concealing the major portion in the ravine in up-to-the-minute readiness and eagerness for an attack, he deployed just enough of the boys in plain sight to carry out the impression, which the Indian couriers had conveyed to Crazy Horse, that only about a hundred soldiers would be found to oppose his eager and confident large reinforcements.” [...] As a grave was being dug for Private Wenzel, and the starved troopers were ready to dine on captured bison meat, rifle shots were heard from the bluffs above and around the camp. Crook immediately ordered the village to be burned. [...] “Then followed the most spectacular and tragically gripping and gratifying drama of the whole Sioux War, enacted with a setting and view for {{those of us in the}} ambushing corps that could not be improved upon. [...] The huge amphitheater, leading from our position in the front orchestra row, up over a gradually rising terrain to the rim of the hills which surrounded on three sides, was not unlike the situation which Crazy Horse had chosen for his Battle of the Rosebud.” [...] Finerty tells how the Indians attacked. “Like the Napoleonic cuirassiers at Waterloo, they rode along the line looking for a gap to penetrate. [...] They kept up perpetual motion encouraged by a warrior, doubtless Crazy Horse himself, who, mounted on a fleet, white horse, galloped around the array and seemed to possess the power of ubiquity.” [...] Strahorn reported, “Suddenly the summits seemed alive with an eager, expectant and gloating host of savages who dashed over and down the slope, whooping and recklessly firing at every jump.” ...|$|E

5000|$|We {{started our}} design work <b>and</b> {{realized}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> {{need to have}} even more story and history than would be revealed in the game itself.

6000|$|There {{followed}} a flutter of polite offers and refusals, acknowledgments and disavowals, {{and an understanding}} that I would arrange it all, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> come to Mrs. Deering's hotel after supper and see Miss Gage about the when and the how of her coming to us." ...|$|E

60|$|In {{this little}} preface we have {{deliberately}} used the old-fashioned terms {{for the two}} races, fully aware that they are both inexact, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> today <b>we</b> <b>would,</b> for instance, use the term Inuit instead of Eskimo.

60|$|I {{waited until}} they were quite close enough to hear me, and then I hailed them.

And {{they said they were}} very glad that we had learned our lesson, and we said for the ten-thousandth time that we were sorry <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> not do it again. Also, we poured sand upon our heads. Then the skippers said that it was all very well, but just to show us that they did not forget us, they would send a devil-devil that we would never forget <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> always remember any time we might feel like harming a white man. After that the mate mocked us one more time and yelled, Yah! Yah! Yah!' Then six of our men, whom we thought long dead, were put ashore from one of the schooners, and the schooners hoisted their sails and ran out through the passage for the Solomons.|$|E
6000|$|I told Florac {{that the}} Newcomes could not receive us, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> remain, if he willed it, his guests {{for a little}} longer.

5000|$|Another early 17th century author, Michael Praetorius, agreed.
