40|$|Abstract. Influence of {{nitrogen}} and oxygen <b>annealing</b> atmospheres on the carrier concentration, carrier mobility, electrical resistivity and PL characteristics {{as well as}} the crystallinity of ZnO films deposited on sapphire substrates by atomic layer deposition (ALD) were compared. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and photoluminescence (PL) analyses, and Hall measurement were performed to investigate the crystallinity, optical properties and electrical properties of the ZnO thin films, respectively. The UV emission intensity for oxygen <b>annealing</b> is stronger than that for nitrogen <b>annealing</b> in the case of <b>annealing</b> at 600 °C, but the difference decreases with the Increase of <b>annealing</b> temperature. The strongest UV emission is obtained by oxygen <b>annealing</b> at 800 °C.

Taking both the PL and electrical properties into consideration it may be concluded that optimum <b>annealing</b> condition for ZnO thin films grown on the sapphire substrate by ALD is an <b>annealing</b> temperature of 900 °C and an <b>annealing</b> atmosphere of oxygen although the effects of <b>annealing</b> atmosphere on the optical and electrical properties are not so significant...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe billet was {{prepared}} {{by putting the}} aluminum bar into the silver tube, and the silver clad aluminum wire was fabricated through cold hydrostatic extrusion and subsequent drawing. The effects of <b>annealing</b> parameters on the interface and properties of the wires were investigated. The results showed that when the <b>annealing</b> temperature was below 150 °C and <b>annealing</b> time was less than 30 min, no new phase was observed obviously, while new phase could be observed {{when the temperature reached}} above 200 °C. The results of energy spectrum analysis showed that new phase were mainly Ag 3 Al electronic compound (μ phase) which was hard brittle phase with the β-Mn structure. The effects of <b>annealing</b> temperature and time on the interface were different: for any <b>annealing</b> time in this study, the width of the interface rose markedly with the increase of <b>annealing</b> temperature, while <b>annealing</b> time had no significant effect on the width of interface when the temperature was low. Only when the temperature was comparatively high, the increment rate of width of the interface gradually increased with the rise of <b>annealing</b> time. The width of interfaces was 5 ∼ 7 μm, 7 ∼ 9 μm and 10 ∼ 12 μm after <b>annealing</b> treatment under the temperature of 150 °C, 200 °C and 300 °C respectively for 30 minutes. If the <b>annealing</b> temperature was lower than 200 °C, the main way was that silver diffused towards aluminum, but when the <b>annealing</b> temperature was up to 300 °C, the reverse diffusion occurred. When <b>annealing</b> temperature was 150 °C or 200 °C, the tensile strength of composite wire decreased after increased with the increment of <b>annealing</b> time, while when it was 300 °C, the tensile strength always increased. The elongation percentage of composite wire had an adverse change compared to that of tensile strength. The reason for the change of mechanical properties of composite wire is mainly that mechanical properties was synthetically influenced by three mechanisms called <b>annealing</b> softening, diffusion phase transformation of interface and alloying of sheath and core because of their interdiffusion. <b>Annealing</b> softening produced dominant effect in lower <b>annealing</b> temperature and shorter <b>annealing</b> time condition, while the other two mechanisms had main effect in higher <b>annealing</b> temperature and longer <b>annealing</b> time condition...|$|R
25|$|Gamma ray {{treatment}} is also uncommon, because {{although it is}} the safest and cheapest irradiation method, successful treatment can take several months. The color produced is a blue to blue-green which penetrates the whole stone. Such diamonds are not <b>annealed.</b> The blue color can sometimes approach that of natural Type IIb diamonds, but the two are distinguished by the latter's semiconductive properties. As with most irradiated diamonds, most gamma ray-treated diamonds were originally tinted yellow; the blue is usually modified by this tint, resulting in a perceptible greenish cast.|$|E

25|$|Diamond is {{notorious for}} having a {{relatively}} large lattice strain.

Many of them already have sufficient concentrations of grown-in N-V centers and are suitable for applications. If not, they are irradiated by high-energy particles and <b>annealed.</b> Selection of a certain irradiation dose allows tuning the concentration of produced N-V centers such that individual N-V centers are separated by micrometre-large distances.

Batches of silver were melted in crucibles with the addition of copper for a subtler alloy. The melted silver was cast into flat ingots and hammered into intermediate plates. For the relief work, the sheet-silver was <b>annealed</b> to allow shapes to be beaten into high repoussé; these rough shapes were then filled with pitch from the back to make them firm enough for further detailing with punches and tracers.

The plates were probably worked in a flat form and later bent into curves to solder them together.|$|E
25|$|Presently {{diamonds}} are safely irradiated in four ways: proton and deuteron bombardment via cyclotrons; {{gamma ray}} bombardment via exposure to cobalt-60; neutron bombardment via {{the piles of}} nuclear reactors; and electron bombardment via Van de Graaff generators. These high-energy particles physically alter the diamond's crystal lattice, knocking carbon atoms out of place and producing color centers. Irradiated diamonds are all some shade of green, black, or blue after treatment, but most are <b>annealed</b> to further modify their color into bright shades of yellow, orange, brown, or pink. The annealing process increases the mobility of individual carbon atoms, allowing some of the lattice defects created during irradiation to be corrected.

The three layers consisting of Ge2Se3/Ag/Ge2Se3, directly below the top tungsten electrode, mix together during deposition and jointly form the silver-source layer. This silver-source layer is not {{in direct contact with}} the active layer. This allows the device to have significantly higher processing and operating temperatures (above 250°C and at least 150°C, respectively) since silver does not migrate into the active layer at high temperatures, and the active layer maintains a high glass transition temperature (~350°C). These processing and operating temperatures are higher than most ion-conducting chalcogenide device types, including the S-based glasses (e.g. GeS) that need to be photodoped or thermally <b>annealed.</b> It is a combination of these factors that allow the SDC device to operate over a wide range of temperatures, including long-term continuous operation at 150°C.|$|E
