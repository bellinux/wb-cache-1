50|$|An engineer's {{spirit level}} (or machinist's level) is {{generally}} used to <b>level</b> <b>machines,</b> {{although they may}} also be used to level large workpieces on machines such as planers. Using gravity as a reference and checking a machine's axis of travel at several points, the level is used to ensure the machine's axis is straight. A perfectly <b>level</b> <b>machine</b> does not actually need to be achieved, unless the particular manufacturing process requires it. Spirit levels are also used in building construction by carpenters and masons.|$|R
40|$|A {{brief summary}} of the Hierarchical Development Methodology (HDM) is provided. The design of a system is {{decomposed}} into a hierarchy of abstract machines, linearly ordered with a different abstract <b>machine</b> at each <b>level</b> in the hierarchy. Each abstract machine in the hierarchy is dependent only on the functionality of lower <b>level</b> <b>machines.</b> The facilities of the highest <b>level</b> abstract <b>machine,</b> and only those of that machine, are visible to a user of the system. A machine is itself decomposed into modules, each module having operations and data structures which typically define a single abstract data concept. As in the Parnas module concept, the module is the programming unit of HDM; each of the modules may be independently implemented. The programs implementing a module can access the data structures of their own abstract machine, but not those of lower <b>level</b> <b>machines...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the factors that influence fill weight and weight variability of capsules produced on the In-Cap and to assess any differences in terms of capsule defects between gelatin and HPMC (Quali-V) shells. The In-Cap is an <b>automatic</b> <b>tamping</b> type capsule-filling machine and the low output of ≈ 3000 capsules/hour makes it ideal for early formulation development and phase I/IIa clinical supplies manufacture. Four commonly used excipients (Avicel PH 101, Avicel PH 302, A-Tab, and Prosolv HD 90) and a poorly flowing drug blend were encapsulated at various pin settings and powder bed heights. The average fill weight and coefficient of weight variation were determined. The percentage of defective capsules formed during encapsulation was calculated. Results of the study showed that pin setting was critical for controlling the fill weight and the weight variation. The order of pin setting with pin 1 (closer to the powder chute) set to a relatively higher position and pin 4 (before ejection) set to a lower position was found to give higher fill weights with relatively lower weight variability. The powder bed height influenced the fill weight for poorly flowing powders. The capsule machine speed did not appear to significantly influence the fill weight. The fill weight and weight variation were found to depend on the flow property of the material. A large percentage of defective capsules was obtained using HPMC shell size # 00. Some of the commonly observed defects included split caps and improperly closed filled capsules. In general, appropriate selection of pin settings and bed height can reduce the weight variability seen, especially with poorly flowing high-dose formulations...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{synchronized}} intermittent mandatory ventilation, it {{is generally}} accepted {{that the work of}} the inspiratory muscles is decreased by the ventilator so that their activity can be modulated by the frequency of assisted breaths. We examined the validity of this concept, which recently has been questioned. METHODS: We studied five patients receiving synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation because of an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The <b>level</b> of <b>machine</b> assistance, defined as the percentage of total ventilation delivered by the ventilator, was varied from a high (> 60 %) to a medium (20 - 50 %) and to the lowest tolerated value (0 % in four patients). Esophageal pressure, air flow, and the electromyograms of the diaphragm and sternocleidomastoid muscles were recorded. At each <b>level</b> of <b>machine</b> assistance, distinguishing assisted from spontaneous breaths, the duration of electrical activation, the integrated electromyograms, and the work of breathing were computed. RESULTS: The durations of electrical activation and the integrated electromyograms of the diaphragm and sternocleidomastoid were similar in successive spontaneous and assisted breaths. At > 60 % of machine assistance, the cumulative values per minute of the integrated electromyograms of the diaphragm and sternocleidomastoid and the work of breathing were reduced only by 38, 32, and 44 %, respectively, compared with the lowest tolerated <b>level</b> of <b>machine</b> assistance. The durations of electrical activation did not change with increasing <b>level</b> of <b>machine</b> assistance. CONCLUSIONS: The degree of inspiratory muscle rest achieved by synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation is not proportional to the <b>level</b> of <b>machine</b> assistance; furthermore, the inspiratory motor output is not regulated breath by breath but rather is constant for a given <b>level</b> of <b>machine</b> assistance...|$|R
