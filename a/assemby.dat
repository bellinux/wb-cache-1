40|$|The modern {{concept of}} the high {{temperature}} gas-cooled reactor (HTGR) with its outstanding inherent safety characteristics very much approaches the objective of a 'catastrophe-free' nuclear technology. By appropriate layout and design, an unpermittedly high release of radioactive materials {{for most of the}} imaginable, including hypothetical, accident scenarios can be ruled out. For a few extremely unlikely scenarios, nevertheless, like a massive air ingress into the reactor core without any, including long-term counter measures, there has been no proof so far. Therefore, taking the Chinese 10 MW pebble bed HTGR (HTR- 10) as an example, the Jong-term consequences of an assumed full size rupture of the connection vessel between reactor and steam generator have been investigated. The reactor dynamics computer code TINTE has been used to analyse the transient behaviour of an air ingress ruled by natural convection phenomena. As the ultimate consequence of a long-term air ingress, it is assumed that all coated particles (CPs) are free and uncovered and that they have <b>assembied</b> at certain locations in the reactor structure. The integrity of TRISO CPs in air atmosphere cannot be fully maintained at temperatures over 1400 °C. Therefore, the hegt dissipation from a large CP assembly is of particular importance. Based an newly developed models for the assessment of the effective heat conductivity of CP assemblies and mixed assemblies of fuel elements and CPs, the heat dissipation from CP assemblies in hot-coolant channels, in the hot plenum, and in the fuel discharge tube ist analysed. It is shown that, for the HTR- 10, the temperature in such assemblies even under the indicated conditions cannot exceed the limit temperature of 1400 °C. The safe containment of radioactive materials in the CPs is maintained even {{in the case of a}} massive, complete corrosion of the fuel elements. As the investigations clearly show, even the extreme accidentalevents assumed could not affect the safy of the system. For future commercial HTGRs, some measures are proposed to avoid massive air ingresses, and to limit the damage in case of an accident...|$|R

In particular, {{it is now possible}} to quantify and monitor surface mesoscale eddies. However, the single use satellite altimetry only allows providing surface information with a limited spatio/temporal coverage. Thus, to circumvent these limitations and to fully understand the three-dimensional variability it is necessary to complement altimetry data with alternative remote and in-situ sensors. In this study we review recent advances on mesoscale variability as seen by the synergy of altimetry and independent observations in the Western Mediterranean, where the circulation is rather complex due to the presence of multiple interacting scales, including basin, sub-basin scale and mesoscale structures. The challenges of characterizing these processes imply therefore precise and high-resolution observations in addition to multi-sensor approaches. Accordingly, multi-platform experiments have been designed and carried out in the different sub-basins of the Western Mediterranean Sea highlighting the need of synergetic approaches through the combined use of observing systems at several spatial/temporal scales, with the aim of better understanding mesoscale dynamics.

Also, some authors have claimed that during the XXI century the likely {{increase}} of the salinity in the basin (i. e. the decrease of the halosteric component of sea level), could partially compensate the projected global sea level rise. These claims have generated confusion {{on the fate of}} Mediterranean sea level under climate change. In this presentation we will argue that changes in the salinity of the Mediterranean Sea do not {{have a significant impact on}} the basin averaged sea level. Furthermore we use a novel approach to combine the information from global and regional models to generate a large ensemble of Mediterranean sea level projections for the XXI century. Our results suggest that under all the scenarios the Mediterranean sea level will rise approximately at the same rate than the NE Atlantic. The projections also show that, in turn, the NE Atlantic sea level will be between 5 and 35 cm higher than global sea level by the end of the XXI centuryPeer Reviewe...|$|E

Monitoring the weekly to monthly variability of ocean currents and associated mesoscale instabilities, then placing this within the context of, and modifying, the seasonal to interannual circulation models is key. SOCIB (the Balearic Islands Coastal Ocean Observing and Forecasting System) has undertaken the monthly monitoring of ocean currents in the Ibiza Channel, a key 80 km ‘choke’ point in the Western Mediterranean basin-scale circulation, using gliders. Here, as in other locations in the global ocean, high frequency variability in the system is observed, {{in conjunction with a}} seasonal variability in the main thermohaline circulation. Now, with three years of semi-continuous glider data and 16 years of seasonal ships CTD data, we have greater insight into the high frequency processes that modify and govern the large basin-scale flow variability at this ‘choke’ point and thus better understand the important north/south exchanges of Atlantic (fresher and warmer) and Mediterranean (more saline and colder) watermasses and associated dynamical effectsPeer reviewe...|$|E

In this context, SOCIB (the Balearic Islands Coastal Observing and Forecasting System, www. socib. es) has developed an operational ocean forecasting system in the Western Mediterranean Sea (WMOP). WMOP uses a regional configuration of the Regional Ocean Modelling System (ROMS, Shchepetkin and McWilliams, 2005) nested in the larger scale Mediterranean Forecasting System (MFS) with a spatial resolution of 1. 5 - 2 km. WMOP aims at reproducing both the basin-scale ocean circulation and the mesoscale variability which is known to {{play a crucial role}} due to its strong interaction with the large scale circulation in this region. An operational validation system has been developed to systematically assess the model outputs at daily, monthly and seasonal time scales. Multi-platform observations are used for this validation, including satellite products (Sea Surface Temperature, Sea Level Anomaly), in situ measurements (from gliders, Argo floats, drifters and fixed moorings) and High-Frequency radar data. The validation procedures allow to monitor and certify the general realism of the daily production of the ocean forecasting system before its distribution to users. Additionally, different indicators (Sea Surface Temperature and Salinity, Eddy Kinetic Energy, Mixed Layer Depth, Heat Content, transports in key sections) are computed every day both at the basin-scale and in several sub-regions (Alboran Sea, Balearic Sea, Gulf of Lion).

Optimal Interpolation (OI) is often the preferred method for this task, as it {{leads to the lowest}} expected error and provides an error field associated to the analysed field. However, the numerical cost of the method may limit its utilization in situations where the number of data points is significant. Furthermore, the separation of non-adjacent regions with OI requires adaptation of the code, leading to a further increase of the numerical cost. To solve these issues, the Data-Interpolating Variational Analysis (DIVA), a technique designed to produce gridded from sparse in situ measurements, is applied on SLA data in the Mediterranean Sea. DIVA and OI {{have been shown to be}} equivalent (provided some assumptions on the covariances are made). The main difference lies in the covariance function, which is not explicitly formulated in DIVA. The particular spatial and temporal distributions of measurements required adaptation in the Software tool (data format, parameter determinations, [...] .). These adaptation are presented in the poster. The daily analysed and error fields obtained with this technique are compared with available products such as the gridded field from the Archiving, Validation and Interpretation of Satellite Oceanographic data (AVISO) data server.

The strategy allowed to investigate the mesoscale and sub-mesoscale processes associated with the Balearic Current, the main oceanographic feature of the area. A mission using 2 Slocum gliders was performed simultaneously in combination with other type of measurements (drifters, CTDs from ship and remote sensing data). In this experiment the coastal glider operated between surface and 200 m while the deep (1000 m maximum depth), was set-up to reach only 600 m. The autonomous platforms covered an area of 50 x 40 km 2 collecting 811 hydrographic (temperature and salinity) and bio-geochemical (turbidity, oxygen and chlorophyll) profiles. The horizontal resolution in the along track direction was around 0. 3 km for the coastal glider and around 1. 1 km for the deep glider and about 4 km between gliders tracks. The preliminary analysis of in-situ and remote sensing data reveals the presence of an anomalous anticyclonic eddy near the northwest coast of Mallorca island of about 60 km diameter. This structure blocked the usual path of the Balearic Current along the coast, deflecting the main northeastward flow to the north. The relative fresh waters from Atlantic origin (37. 4 PSU) found in previous studies near the coast were not detected in this experiment. Instead, the signature of the Mediterranean Water (salinity of 38 PSU and higher), typical from open ocean water, was dominant in the study area.

Flow variability and dynamic processes at inter-basin ‘choke’ points in the circulation system, such as Drake Passage in the Southern Ocean and the Fram Straits between the Arctic Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean, have an influential role in the patterns of heat, salt and watermass exchange between ocean basins and are particularly important locations to monitor variability {{at a variety of}} scales. The Ibiza Channel in the Western Mediterranean is one such ‘choke’ point in the basin scale circulation of the Mediterranean Sea, where an important north south exchange of water masses is known to influence the spawning grounds of commercially important fish stocks. Here autonomous underwater gliders are proving particularly effective at capturing the signature of sub-seasonal variability and the dynamics of an sub-basin exchange, previously only monitored at a seasonal level through ships surveys or at a coarse resolution with sparse moorings. Here we show the results of monthly glider monitoring of the Ibiza Channel in 2011 – 2012, although due to technical issues the glider timeseries is not continuous for the whole period, we are nevertheless able to see days-weeks variability in the transport of different watermasses, on a scale comparable to that of the previously identified seasonal cycle. With the high spatial and temporal resolution of glider data, potential ‘modes’ of circulation are also identified with the aim of simplifying the complex pattern of flows previously observed at this dynamically complex location.

An enclosed sea such as the Mediterranean is particularly vulnerable to ship-associated pressures due to a high-volume of shipping routes, long history of use, and sensitive shallow and deep-sea habitats. Negative impacts associated to maritime traffic include biodiversity loss, introduction of alien species, pollution, marine litter and underwater noise among others. The monitoring and characterization of the spatio-temporal patterns of marine traffic constitutes an important element for the effective management and assessment of environmental impacts of this activity. Monitoring of real-time ship locations can be achieved through the Automated Identification System (AIS). The AIS is a VHF transmitter that broadcast the ship position, as well as additional information (eg. timestamp, speed, heading, boat type). All ocean-going commercial traffic > 300 gross tons, or carrying more than 165 passengers, as well as tug/tows, are required to carry AIS transmitters (IALA 2004). In addition, the rest of the ships are able to carry on these transmitters on a voluntary basis. In this work we present the development of an information system designed to store, manage, analyze and visualize historical AIS data based on open-source components. We analyse such data to assess and map multiple anthropogenic pressures. For example, segmented regression on speed distribution is carried out to identify and map fishing activity, whereas neighbourhood statistics and GIS methods are used to generate underwater noise maps. We will illustrate these products within the context of risk assessment on marine ecosystems at the Western Mediterranean Sea. The information provided in this study can be incorporated into Decision Support Systems (DSS) for supporting the implementation of European and national policies for the assessment of environmental impacts and the interactions among human activities as wellPeer reviewe...|$|E

WMOP uses a regional {{configuration of the}} Regional Ocean Modelling System (ROMS, Shchepetkin and McWilliams, 2005) with a high spatial resolution of 1 / 50 º (1. 5 - 2 km). Thus, theses simulations are able to reproduce mesoscale {{and in some cases}} sub-mesoscale features that are key in the Mediterranean Sea since they interact and modify the basin and sub-basin circulation. These simulations are initialized from and nested in either the Mediterranean Forecasting System (MFS, 1 / 16 º) or Mercator-Océan simulations (MERCATOR, 1 / 12 º). A repeated glider section in the Ibiza Channel, operated by SOCIB, has revealed significant differences between two WMOP simulations using either MFS or MERCATOR (hereafter WMOP-MFS and WMOP-MERC). In this study, MFS, MERCATOR, WMOP-MFS and WMOP-MERC are compared and evaluated using available multi-platform observations such as satellite products (Sea Level Anomaly, Sea Surface Temperature) and in situ measurements (temperature and salinity profiles from Argo floats, CTD, XBT, fixed moorings and gliders; velocity fields from HF radar and currentmeters). A quantitative comparison is necessary to evaluate the capacity of the simulations to reproduce observed ocean features, and to quantify the possible simulations biases. This will in turn allow to improve the simulations, so as to produce better ocean forecast systems, to study and better understand ocean processes and to address climate studies. Therefore, various statistical diagnostics have been developed to assess and intercompare the simulations at various spatial and temporal scales, in different sub-regions (Alboran Sea, Western and Eastern Algerian sub-basins, Balearic Sea, Gulf of Lion), in different dynamical zones (coastal areas, shelves and "open" sea), along key sections (Ibiza and Mallorca Channels, Corsica Channel, [...] .) and during specific eventsPeer reviewe...|$|E

This method {{is based on the}} numerical implementation of the Variational Inverse Model (VIM), which consists of a minimization of a cost function, allowing the choice of the analyzed field fitting at best the data sets. The problem is solved efficiently using a finite-element method. This statistical method is particularly suited to deal with irregularly-spaced observations, producing outputs on a regular grid. Initially created to work in a two-dimensional way, the {{software is}} now able to handle 3 D or even 4 D analysis, in order to easily produce ocean climatologies. These analyzes can easily be improved by taking advantage of the DIVA’s ability to take topographic and dynamic constraints into account (coastal relief, prevailing wind impacting the advection, [...] .). In DIVA, we assume errors on measurements are not correlated, which means we do not consider the effect of correlated observation errors on the analysis and we therefore use a diagonal observation error covariance matrix. However, the oceanographic data sets are generally clustered in space and time, thus introducing some correlation between observations. In order to determine the impact of such an approximation and provide strategies to mitigate its effects, we conducted several synthetic experiments with known correlation structure. Overall, the best results were obtained with a variant of the covariance inflation method. Finally, a new application of DIVA on satellite altimetry data will be presented : these data have particular space and time distributions, as they consist of repeated tracks (∼ 10 - 35 days) of measurements with a distance lower than 10 km between two successive measurements in a given track. The tools designed to determine the analysis parameters were adapted to these specificities. Moreover, different weights were applied to measurements in order to take the different times of measurements into account. This application focused on daily fields of sea level anomalies in the Mediterranean SeaPeer reviewe...|$|E

This area is relevant due to the interaction of water masses coming from the Atlantic Ocean – ascending through the Iberian Peninsula coast – with the older Atlantic waters descending from the Gulf of Lion. In 2012, the installation of Coastal HF Radar in the area provides valuable information {{for the study of}} the surface transport along the channel. The Coastal HF Radar operates since June 2012, and provides hourly surface current maps with a spatial resolution of approximately 3 km and a range reaching up to 70 km offshore. The instrument forms part of a monitoring multi-platform system, which is completed with satellite-derived data, gliders, modelling and fixed and lagrangian buoys. All HF Radar data are processed with standard quality control methods. Drifter velocity obtained from lagrangian buoys for two oceanographic campaigns, satellite-derived data and currentmeter data from a fixed buoy in the Ibiza Channel are used to validate the HF Radar data. All surface current data are used to perform a spectrum analysis in order to show the physical processes, at the main temporal periods. The contribution of the different temporal scales to the total Kinetic Energy has been analysed for the first time at different seasonal intervals. This served to evaluate the energetic importance of the different components of the surface currents. The inertial currents have a lower contribution to the total KE during winter, compared with the summer period. Besides, the spatial distribution of the inertial component to the total KE varies seasonally, and according to the bathymetry of the area. The low-pass (sub-inertial) filtered HF Radar currents show a predominant northern current during the summer months in the channel, and a mean southern current during the winter period. These results are discussed and related with the external forcing, and bathymetry distribution, according to coastal or open ocean dataPeer reviewe...|$|E

The Ibiza Channel, located in the Balearic Sea, is of particular importance since it controls the exchanges in the western Mediterranean Sea. In order to understand and describe the upper ocean dynamics, a multi-sensor/integrated approach was applied in the Ibiza Channel in the first days of August 2013 during the G-AltiKa mission. This approach combines: Sea-level anomaly (SLA) measurements from Saral-AltiKa track no. 16, which passed west of Ibiza island. 1 -Hz and 40 -Hz data were considered. Glider data obtained along the satellite track a few hours after its passage. The horizontal resolution ranges from 5 km offshore to about 1 km in the coastal area. HF radar hourly velocities on a 3 km-resolution grid that partially covers the study region (range up to 74 km offshore). Dynamic height (DH) was derived from the glider temperature and salinity profiles, while Absolute Dynamic Topography (ADT) was obtained by combining SLA and the new Mean Dynamic Topography (MDT) jointly produced by CLS and SOCIB. From DH and SLA, the cross-track velocities were derived using geostrophy relations. Different filters were applied on SLA data and different reference levels were tested for the DH computation. DH and ADT both displayed very weak variations, on the order of 2 - 3 cm, along the glider trajectory. The gliderand the altimetry-derived velocities exhibit the signal of a meander centered at 38. 65 ◦N and a narrow coastal current flowing northward a few kilometers off Ibiza. These computed velocities are on the order of 20 cm/s, as confirmed by the HF radar. The time separation between the passage of the satellite and the glider can explain the discrepancies observed between the two platforms. Our results highlight the promising measurements offered by SARAL/AltiKa in the coastal band. In particular, the satellite was able is able to capture the northern edge of the meander which lied on a shallow bathymetry, less than 10 km from the coast. They also constitute the first experiment where satellite altimetry and glider measurements were obtained almost simultaneously on the same track, in a region covered by a HF radar. Such an approach allows us to process, validate and intercalibrate multi-platform datasets dedicated to coastal oceanPeer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Trabajo presentado en la EGU General <b>Assemby</b> 2013, celebrada del 7 al 12 de abril de 2013 en Viena (Austria) The Mediterranean Sea is {{dynamically}} {{connected to}} the Atlantic Ocean through the Strait of Gibraltar. This area is the scenario of a very energetic baroclinic exchange between Atlantic and Mediterranean waters: fresh and warm Atlantic waters enter into the basin while salty and cold Mediterranean waters outflow to the Atlantic. Those water fluxes fluctuate at different timescales (from semi-diurnal to interannual) forced by different factors (tides, meteorological forcing and the seasonal and inter-annual variations of the baroclinic structure). Moreover, incoming and outgoing waters change their properties during their passage through the Strait due to mixing and entrainment between Mediterranean and Atlantic waters. This transformation of the water masses determines the net heat and salt exchanges of the Mediterranean with the global ocean. The aim of this work is to analyse the spatial and temporal variability of the incoming and outgoing transports of water, heat and salt at different sections of the Gibraltar Strait. In particular we investigate the transformations that Atlantic and Mediterranean waters suffer along its path through the Strait and the physical mechanisms behind those transformations. To do that we analyse the outputs from a numerical simulation covering the entire Mediterranean basin (1 / 6 degrees of spatial resolution) with enhanced resolution {{in the area of}} the Strait (1 / 200 degrees). Another special feature of this model is that it includes tidal forcing (diurnal and semidiurnal) and atmospheric pressure as well as heat and water fluxes at the sea surface. The results show that a net entrainment of - 0. 02 Sv into the lower layer occurs in the Strait, which involves a net loss of heat and salt from the Atlantic inflow. This entrainment has a strong time variability changing from 0. 09 to - 0. 21 Sv at monthly scale. Furthermore, when the internal sections of the Strait are considered, a more complex pattern emerges: a net transfer of - 0. 18 Sv towards the lower layer is achieved between the western boundary and the mid-region of the Strait, whereas the opposite behaviour is found in the western part, which presents a net transfer of 0. 16 Sv towards the upper layer. The model outputs also show that this entrainment significantly modifies the properties of the incoming and outgoing waters. Finally, a simple parameterization of the water mass transformations along the Strait will be proposed. This parameterization can be implemented in coarse resolution climate models which do not include tides in order to account for the complexity of the physical processes that take place in the Strait of Gibraltar and that they cannot explicitly solvePeer reviewe...|$|E
