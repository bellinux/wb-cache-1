5|$|The Campaign for Borders Rail {{claimed in}} February 2016 that only 35½% of {{services}} were arriving on time at Tweedbank, {{which made the}} Borders Railway one of ScotRail's most poorly-performing services. In addition, reliability issues with the Class 158 units and traincrew problems resulted {{in at least one}} train being cancelled on 74 of the 143 days between 31 March 2016 and 20 August 2016. This comprised 14 days of severe disruption due to crew shortages, 18 days as a result of issues with the Class 158s and nine days for signalling failures. Crew shortages came about due to higher than expected levels of sickness as well as the difficulty of replacing staff during a popular period for <b>annual</b> <b>leave.</b> Reliability issues with the Class 158s were encountered during hot weather which caused radiators to overheat, particularly on steep gradients with a heavy load, as coolant systems became stressed. To deal with the problem, ScotRail sought to replace the faulty radiators with superior quality models. Signalling problems were mainly due to water ingress into axle counters as well as a faulty telecommunications link coupled with a failure {{on the part of the}} automated fault-finding system to detect the problem locations.|$|E

There are many ever ending problems faced by workers who work in certain time despite their status as contracted workers that {{make it hard to}} get their rights. For example: it is hard for them to get <b>annual</b> <b>leaves</b> and compensations due to workers lay-off made by the company. The fact shows an injustice social reality – the stronger party (businessmen) can do whatever they want to do to the weaker one (workers). 	Based on the fact above, the writer aimed to find out and analyze whether workers who worked in certain time had the rights to get their <b>annual</b> <b>leaves</b> and compensations due to the lay-off made by the company in accordance to the positive law regulations in Indonesia...|$|R

25|$|In {{addition}} to their sick and <b>annual</b> <b>leave,</b> federal executive agency employees are entitled to 30 days paid leave for organ donation. Thirty-two states (excluding only Alabama, Connecticut, Florida, Kentucky, Maine, Michigan, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont, and Wyoming) and the District of Columbia also offer paid leave for state employees. Five states (California, Hawaii, Louisiana, Minnesota, and Oregon) require certain private employers to provide paid leave for employees for organ or bone marrow donation, and seven others (Arkansas, Connecticut, Maine, Nebraska, New York, South Carolina, and West Virginia) either require employers to provide unpaid leave, or encourage employers to provide leave, for organ or bone marrow donation.|$|E
25|$|In a state heavily {{reliant on}} {{continuous}} supply of gas for industrial processing, manufacturing, residential use and electricity generation, the sudden loss of almost 35% of gas supply had immediate social impacts, and significant {{short and long-term}} economic effects. Many businesses were forced to curtail or cease operations, resulting in workers being stood down or forced to take <b>annual</b> <b>leave,</b> and the government requested that businesses and householders conserve energy usage. An emergency coordination committee of government and industry representatives rationed and redirected remaining gas supply sources. When many large gas users switched to diesel for power generation, {{the risk of a}} shortfall in transport fuel led to the federal government authorising the release of emergency fuel reserves stored at the Garden Island naval facility.|$|E

50|$|It {{belongs to}} the Amaryllidaceae family (subfamily Amaryllidoideae) and its {{specific}} name shows that Jacquin felt it resembled an Amaryllis. H. amarylloides is usually found in seasonally-inundated hollows at about 600 m altitude, between Springbok and Grootvlei in Namaqualand, and along the Bokkeveld Mountains escarpment to Gifberg near Vanrhynsdorp. It has a cone-shaped inflorescence of pale to dark pink flowers appearing from May to October. The two <b>annual</b> <b>leaves</b> are strap-shaped to broadly elliptical, carried erect or flat on the ground.

40|$|Foliar {{applications}} of nitrogen (N), when needed, {{have been used}} to supplement the fertilization of fruit trees through the soil. However, information on frequency effects, N amount to be applied, and the importance of increasing N content and N reserves in the leaves and offshoots are few. This paper aimed at evaluating the effect of foliar N applications on the N content and reserves in <b>annual</b> <b>leaves</b> and offshoots of apple trees. The study was carried out in an apple trees orchard (Eva cultivar), crop 2007 / 2008, in the experimental area of the Polytechnic College of Universidade Federal de Santa Maria (UFSM), in the town of Santa Maria, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, on a hydromorphic planosol.

The results showed that foliar N applications resulted in increased N contents in the whole leaves, especially up to the 8 th day after application, but they do not affect N content in the annual offshoots. Nitrogen fertilization via the leaves did not increase the total content of amino acids and proteins in the <b>annual</b> whole <b>leaves</b> and offshoot...|$|R

2500|$|People in the United States {{work among}} the longest {{hours per week}} in the industrialized world, and have the least <b>annual</b> <b>leave.</b> The Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 article 24 states: [...] "Everyone {{has the right to}} rest and leisure, {{including}} reasonable limitation of working hours and periodic holidays with pay." [...] However, there is no general federal or state legislation requiring paid <b>annual</b> <b>leave.</b> Title 5 of the United States Code §6103 specifies ten public holidays for federal government employees, and provides that holidays will be paid. Many states do the same, however, no state law requires private sector employers to provide paid holidays. Many private employers follow the norms of federal and state government, but the right to <b>annual</b> <b>leave,</b> if any, will depend upon collective agreements and individual employment contracts. State law proposals have been made to introduce paid <b>annual</b> <b>leave.</b> A 2014 Washington Bill from United States House of Representatives member Gael Tarleton would have required a minimum of 3 weeks of paid holidays each year to employees in businesses of over 20 staff, after 3 years work. Under the International Labour Organization Holidays with Pay Convention 1970 three weeks is the bare minimum. The Bill did not receive enough votes. By contrast, employees in all European Union countries have the right to at least 4 weeks (i.e. 28 days) of paid <b>annual</b> <b>leave</b> each year. Furthermore, there is no federal or state law on limits to the length of the working week. Instead, the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 §207 creates a financial disincentive to longer working hours. Under the heading [...] "Maximum hours", §207 states that time and a half pay must be given to employees working more than 40 hours in a week. It does not, however, set an actual limit, and there are at least 30 exceptions for categories of employee which do not receive overtime pay. Shorter working time was one of the labor movement's original demands. From {{the first decades of the}} 20th century, collective bargaining produced the practice of having, and the word for, a two-day [...] "weekend". State legislation to limit working time was, however, suppressed by the US Supreme Court in Lochner v New York. The New York State Legislature had passed the Bakeshop Act of 1895, which limited work in bakeries to 10 hours a day or 60 hours a week, to improve health, safety and people's living conditions. After being prosecuted for making his staff work longer in his Utica, Mr Lochner claimed that the law violated the Fourteenth Amendment on [...] "due process". Despite the dissent of four judges, a majority of five judges held that the law was unconstitutional. The whole Lochner era of jurisprudence was reversed by the US Supreme Court in 1937, but experimentation to improve working time rights, and [...] "work-life balance" [...] has not yet recovered.|$|E
