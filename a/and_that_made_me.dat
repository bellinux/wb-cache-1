500|$|John Gielgud's New Theatre {{production}} in 1935 featured Gielgud and Laurence Olivier as Romeo and Mercutio, exchanging roles six {{weeks into the}} run, with Peggy Ashcroft as Juliet. Gielgud used a scholarly combination of Q1 and Q2 texts and organised the set and costumes to match {{as closely as possible}} to the Elizabethan period. His efforts were a huge success at the box office, and set the stage for increased historical realism in later productions. Olivier later compared his performance and Gielgud's: [...] "John, all spiritual, all spirituality, all beauty, all abstract things; and myself as all earth, blood, humanity... I've always felt that John missed the lower half <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> go for the other... But whatever it was, when I was playing Romeo I was carrying a torch, I was trying to sell realism in Shakespeare." ...|$|E
500|$|Heigl {{believes}} that the Grey's Anatomy writers incorporate much of the actors' personalities into their roles, and that Izzie is a [...] "super moral" [...] version of herself. Episode [...] "Bring the Pain", which aired as the fifth episode of the second season, was originally intended {{to be the final}} episode of the first season. Rhimes explained that Izzie's character in this episode came [...] "full circle" [...] from her role in the pilot: [...] "Izzie, so vulnerable and underestimated when we first meet her, is the girl who removes her heart from her sleeve in [...] "Bring the Pain"." [...] Discussing Izzie's personality in a 2006 Cosmopolitan interview, Heigl assessed that she is [...] "immensely kind" [...] and patient. When Denny died in the season two episode [...] "Losing My Religion", Rhimes discussed the impact it had on Izzie, noting that Izzie is forced to abandon her idealism, which in turn leads to her letting go of medicine. In the aftermath of Denny's death, Heigl came to believe that Izzie was not cut out to be a doctor. Executive producer Betsy Beers explained, however, that Denny's death served to make Izzie more mature, and Heigl affirmed that [...] "At the beginning of the [...] season they were trying to show how lost Izzie was. She lost her optimism. She realizes now that life is difficult, but she still tries very hard to see the best in people." [...] In order to demonstrate Izzie's dislike of George's love-interest Callie, Rhimes penned a scene which she deemed one of her favorite moments on the show, in which Callie urinates in front of a stunned Izzie and Meredith. Rhimes assessed that: [...] "I love that Mer and Izzie respond with all the trauma of having viewed [...] a car crash [...] the point is Callie pees and Izzie tortures her a tiny bit about the hand washing <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> overjoyed because that’s the kind of thing people do." ...|$|E

6000|$|There was {{something}} in Alderling's tone <b>and</b> manner <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>me,</b> instead of answering directly that I did not, temporize and ask, [...] "Why?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... '"Then you're a wicked, wicked old man," [...] I said, and I was {{so angry}} that I couldn't help crying, <b>and</b> of course <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> cough.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, I may {{say to your}} ladyship at once," [...] says Mr. Guppy, {{a little}} emboldened, [...] "it is no matter arising out of Jarndyce <b>and</b> Jarndyce <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> so desirous to speak to your ladyship, which conduct I have no doubt did appear, and does appear, obtrusive--in fact, almost blackguardly." ...|$|R

6000|$|She scrutinised me a moment. [...] "You've {{done this}} as a surprise!" [...] she said, and laughed at my laughter. She had become radiant, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> radiant, too.|$|E

5000|$|Mark McConnell of paranormal {{magazine}} Fortean Times {{gave the}} movie 8 out of 10, saying: [...] "The film's climax <b>made</b> <b>me</b> {{wonder if it}} wasn't the director's exploration of interpersonal relationships between men <b>and</b> women <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> want to watch it a second time. Hats off to Hyett, who has taken the mundane British Rail journey {{and turned it into}} a feast of bloody horror." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Oh, we’ll get more, if we {{are careful}} and keep our eyes open,” {{declared}} Dave. “I saw the track of the rabbit in the snow yonder <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> look for him.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No. But I believe so, or {{else the}} I.W.W. leaders took {{advantage}} of a critical time. I'm bound to say that now thousands of I.W.W. laborers are loyal to the United States, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> switch." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose I thought I {{should have}} to answer them, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> careless. But I will read them." [...] Her mother was silent, and {{presently}} Ellen added: [...] "I hate {{to think of the}} past. Don't you, momma?" ...|$|E
50|$|When I {{entered the}} Fontainhas area, there were colors <b>and</b> smells <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> {{remember}} the things and {{events of the}} past, and also ideas about people to which I am attracted. These ideas nestled close to each other, living together even as they led very solitary lives because of violent and painful separation. A form of interesting and incompatible relationships existed in this.|$|R
5000|$|I {{was just}} a young lawyer thinking, What am I doing with my life? What am I doing with my career? As I watched her on that stage I thought, Why aren't I there? It was so poignant for <b>me.</b> <b>And</b> <b>that's</b> what <b>made</b> <b>me</b> {{figure out how to}} get {{involved}} in politics.

5000|$|I sold {{that fucking}} movie {{for a period}} of ten years and with it bought myself some shelter from the storm. It was an agonizing decision, <b>and</b> one <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> a harder person, but it had to be done. I hated the fact <b>that</b> I <b>made</b> it {{possible}} for someone to go into a video store and rent it. But selling that film gave me some control over my life.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{she thought}} I {{did it on}} purpose, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> angry, and so we got into a dispute, and away went all the little moment I might have had, and I was forced to go to Cocksmoor as a promise breaker!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sir. But I wasn't feeling extra {{well just}} then and I didn't eat very much, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> hungry afterwards. And, oh, say! I guess I {{can tell you}} {{something}} about those snowballs," [...] and Codfish's face lit up suddenly.|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{kind and}} generous you are! every one else {{believes}} in her guilt, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> wretched, for I {{knew that it}} was impossible: and to see every one else prejudiced in so deadly a manner rendered me hopeless and despairing." [...] She wept.|$|E
6000|$|He found Elizabeth in the school-room, all {{flushed and}} tear-stained in the face; {{and he told}} her affectionately how much pleased he was with her {{patience}} under this false accusation. Delight very nearly set her off crying again, but she managed to say, [...] "It was Miss Fosbrook and Sam <b>and</b> Susie <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> patient, Papa; they were so kind. And nobody would have believed it, if I wasn't always cross, you know." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "I am most {{surprised}} by {{those moments when}} I have {{felt as if the}} sentences, dreams, <b>and</b> pages <b>that</b> have <b>made</b> <b>me</b> so ecstatically happy have not come from my own imagination– that another power has found them and generously presented them to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dolcino, {{come and}} see your daddy!" [...] There was {{something}} in the way he stood still <b>and</b> waited <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> think he did it for a purpose. Mrs. Ambient had her arm round the child's waist, and he was leaning against her knee; but though {{he looked up at the}} sound of his father's voice, she gave no sign of releasing him. A lady, apparently a neighbor, was seated near her, and before them was a garden-table, on which a tea-service had been placed.|$|R
6000|$|She {{gave him}} her hand, and said, 'You wonder {{to see me}} here by myself? But the evening is so lovely, I have strolled further than I meant at first. I thought it likely I might meet you, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> more confident. You always come this way, do you not?' ...|$|E
60|$|Dor. Was it so, think you? nay, then, I'll confess {{my part of}} the malice too. As soon as ever I spied {{my husband}} and Melantha come together, I had a strange temptation to make him jealous in revenge; <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> call Palamede, Palamede! as though {{there had been an}} intrigue between us.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{feel sorry}} now myself," [...] {{admitted}} Davy, [...] "but {{the trouble is}} I never feel sorry for doing things till after I've did them. Dora wouldn't help me make pies, cause {{she was afraid of}} messing her clo'es <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> hopping mad. I s'pose Paul Irving wouldn't have made HIS sister walk a pigpen fence if he knew she'd fall in?" ...|$|E
60|$|This was the {{beginning}} of it. Both men attacked the problem with all the tremendous energy for which they were noted, and with a rancor <b>and</b> bitterness <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> tremble for the success of either. Each trusted me to the utmost, and in the long weeks of experimentation that followed I was made a party to both sides, listening to their theorizings and witnessing their demonstrations. Never, by word or sign, did I convey to either the slightest hint of the other's progress, and they respected me for the seal I put upon my lips.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not quite. Occasionally I {{meet the}} people afterwards. For instance, Thomas Sims, the cabman, {{was one of}} them, and," [...] he added colouring, [...] "forgive me for saying so, but you are another. I knew it at once, the moment I saw you, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> is what <b>made</b> <b>me</b> feel so friendly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'That was the {{beginning}} of it,' she said, 'but there was worse; <b>and</b> it was <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> break off my engagement. I doubt now whether in any case I could have held to it. I had begun to feel I had made a mistake before that came, but even had I not done so {{it would have been the}} same. I am accused of theft.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tried!" [...] {{he exclaimed}} bitterly. [...] "I've been {{knocking}} at doors, and asking if Mrs. McQuae lives there steadily all the afternoon, and they {{slam the door}} in my face, mostly without answering. I told a policeman--I thought perhaps he might suggest something--but the idiot only burst out laughing, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> so mad that I gave him a black eye, and had to cut. I expect they're {{on the lookout for}} me now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Wet,' {{replied the}} boy. 'Very wet. I have always said, {{when it has}} rained hard, {{that it was like}} the night I came: and they used to crowd round and laugh to see me cry when the rain fell heavily. It was like a child, they said, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> think of it more. I turned cold all over sometimes, for I could see myself as I was then, coming in at the very same door.' ...|$|E
60|$|FALDER. It's no good deceiving you, Mr. Cokeson. The fact is, I {{seem to be}} {{struggling}} against a thing that's all round me. I can't explain it: it's as if I was in a net; as fast as I cut it here, it grows up there. I didn't act as I ought to have, about references; {{but what are you}} to do? You must have them. <b>And</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> afraid, and I left. In fact, I'm--I'm afraid all the time now.|$|E
5000|$|Supporting {{cast member}} Alyssa Milano {{initially}} auditioned {{for the role}} of Heather, but fear of casting a former child actress initiated the producers to find her a smaller role instead. The role of Heather eventually went to Lara Flynn Boyle. On why she accepted the role, she commented in a 1991 interview that the script smacked her with reality: [...] "One day when I was thinking about doing the movie, I passed Hollywood and Highland Avenue, and looked over and saw 30 kids hanging out. I thought of the movie <b>and</b> <b>that</b> sight <b>made</b> <b>me</b> eager to do it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'O, don't say {{anything}} about it!' cried Annette, frightened. 'It may be only my foolish fancy--but I cannot {{get it out of}} my mind. You see I have no one to talk over things with now you are gone. I have lost my pair in you, so I am solitary among them, <b>and</b> perhaps <b>that</b> has <b>made</b> <b>me</b> think of it the more.' ...|$|R
60|$|One reason I {{have not}} {{answered}} sooner is because your letter was so sweet <b>and</b> loving <b>that</b> it <b>made</b> <b>me</b> feel an ungrateful and unappreciative wretch. Another {{is that this}} life I now lead does not induce writing. I am outdoors all day, and when I get back to this cabin at night I am too tired for anything but bed.|$|R
