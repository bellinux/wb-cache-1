40|$|While {{clinical}} and pre-clinical {{evidence suggests that}} <b>adolescence</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>risk</b> period {{for the development of}} addiction, the underlying neural mechanisms are largely unknown. Stress during adolescence has a huge influence on drug addiction. However, {{little is known about the}} mechanisms related to the interaction among stress, adolescence and addiction. Studies point to ΔFosB as a possible target for this phenomenon. In the present study, adolescent and adult rats (postnatal day 28 and 60, respectively) were restrained for 2 hours once a day for 7 days. Three days after their last exposure to stress, the animals were challenged with saline or amphetamine (1. 0 mg/kg i. p.) and amphetamine-induced locomotion was recorded. Immediately after the behavioral tests, rats were decapitated and the nucleus accumbens was dissected to measure ΔFosB protein levels. We found that repeated restraint stress increased amphetamine-induced locomotion in both adult and adolescent rats. Furthermore, in adult rats, stress-induced locomotor sensitization was associated with increased expression of ΔFosB in the nucleus accumbens. Our data suggest that ΔFosB may be involved in some of the neuronal plasticity changes associated with stress induced-cross sensitization with amphetamine in adult rats...|$|E
40|$|<b>Adolescence</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>risk</b> {{period for}} {{offending}} and head injury (HI), with rates of HI in young offender populations frequently exceeding {{those in the}} community. Poor parenting practices {{have been associated with}} increased risk of offending and development of reactive and proactive aggression. Preliminary research suggests HI may discriminate offender profiles within young offenders, but the influence of HI on offending alongside parenting and aggression is less well known. This study explored the relationships between parenting practices, reactive and proactive aggression, HI and offending in a sample of male young offenders from a Young Offender Institute (n= 98) using self report data. A history of at least one HI was reported by 73. 5 %, with 61. 1 % reporting a knock out from their worst HI. Poor supervision emerged as a key predictor: predicting knock out history, indicators of offending and reactive and proactive aggression. Repeated HI was predictive of reactive aggression and a knock out history predicted earlier age of first offence. The impact of HI on outcomes via neuropsychological sequelea or as a “marker” for contextual risk factors such as poor supervision and reactive aggression are examined. Clinical implications for young offenders are discussed. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

The influence of mentoring relationships are also assessed. Longitudinal data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health and ordered and multinomial logistic regression analyses were used to test models predicting young adults’ frequency of heavy drinking and illicit drug use. Interaction terms were tested between parent and mentor variables as well as college enrolment. Parental monitoring during adolescence reduced young adults’ use of alcohol, but not illicit drugs. Rather, attachment to parents reduced young adults’ use of illicit drugs, particularly for illicit drugs other than marijuana. Conversely, increases in communication with parents during <b>adolescence</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>risk</b> factor {{for the use of}} illicit drugs.

40|$|Purpose of review: Adolescents {{with mental}} health {{problems}} often require transition of care from child and adolescent to adult mental health services. This review is a synthesis of current research and policy literature on transition to describe the barriers at the interface between child and adolescent mental health services and adult mental health services and outcomes of poor transition. Recent findings: <b>Adolescence</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>risk</b> period for emergence of serious mental disorders. Child and adolescent mental health services and adult mental health services use rigid age cut-offs to delineate service boundaries, creating discontinuities in provision of care. Adolescent mental health services are patchy across the world. Several recent studies have confirmed that problems occur during transition in diverse settings across several countries. In physical health, there are emerging models of practice to improve the process and outcomes of transition, but {{there is very little}} comparable literature in mental healthcare. Summary: Poor transition leads to disruption in continuity of care, disengagement from services and is likely to lead to poorer clinical outcomes. Some young people, such as those with neurodevelopmental disorders and complex needs, are at a greater risk of falling through the care gap during transition. Services need robust and high-quality evidence on the process and outcomes of transition so that effective intervention strategies can be developed. ...|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to find out if weaker self-esteem in <b>adolescence</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>risk</b> factor of cigarette smoking in a longitudinal study in Iran. MethodsIn this longitudinal study, 4, 853 students (14 – 18 years) completed a self-administered multiple-choice anonym questionnaire. The students were evaluated twice, 12 months apart. Students were matched based on coarsened exact matching on pretreatment variables, including age, gender, smoking stages at the first wave of study, socioeconomic status, general risk-taking behavior, having a smoker in the family, having a smoker friend, attitude toward smoking, and self-injury, to ensure statistically equivalent comparison groups. Self-esteem was measured using the Rosenberg 10 -item questionnaire and were classified using a latent class analysis. After matching, the effect of self-esteem was evaluated using a multinomial logistic model. ResultsIn the causal fitted model, for adolescents with weaker self-esteem relative to those with stronger self-esteem, the relative risk for experimenters and regular smokers relative to nonsmokers would be expected to increase by a factor of 2. 2 (1. 9 – 2. 6) and 2. 0 (1. 5 – 2. 6), respectively.

40|$|Stress during {{childhood}} and <b>adolescence</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>risk</b> factor for psychopathology. Alterations in c-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, {{have been found}} following stress exposure and fear experiences and are often implicated in anxiety and mood disorders. Abnormal amygdala functioning has also been detected following stress exposure and is also implicated in anxiety and social disorders. However, the amygdala is not a unitary structure; it includes several nuclei with different functions and little is known on the potential differences the impact of early life stress may have on this system within different amygdaloid nuclei. We aimed here to evaluate potential regional differences in the expression of GABAergic-related markers across several amygdaloid nuclei in adult rats subjected to a peripuberty stress protocol that leads to enhanced basal amygdala activity and psychopathological behaviors. More specifically, we investigated the protein expression levels of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD; the principal synthesizing enzyme of GABA) and of GABA-A receptor subunits a 2 and a 3. We found reduced GAD and GABA-A a 3, but not a 2, subunit protein levels throughout all the amygdala nuclei examined (lateral, basolateral, basomedial, medial and central) and increased anxiety-like behaviors and reduced sociability in peripubertally stressed animals. Our results identify an enduring inhibition of the GABAergic system across the amygdala following exposure to early adversity. They also highlight the suitability of the peripuberty stress model to investigate the link between treatments targeting the dysfunctional GABAergic system i...|$|E

40|$|Social stress, {{including}} bullying during <b>adolescence,</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>risk</b> {{factor for}} common psychopathologies such as depression. To investigate the neural mechanisms associated with juvenile social stress-induced mood-related endophenotypes, {{we examined the}} behavioral, morphological, and biochemical effects of the social defeat stress model of depression on hippocampal dendritic spines within the CA 1 stratum radiatum. Adolescent (postnatal day 35) male C 57 BL/ 6 mice were subjected to defeat episodes for 10 consecutive days. Twenty-four h later, separate groups of mice were tested on the social interaction and tail suspension tests. Hippocampi were then dissected and Western blots were conducted to quantify protein levels for various markers important for synaptic plasticity including protein kinase M zeta (PKMζ), protein kinase C zeta (PKCζ), the dopamine- 1 (D 1) receptor, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), and the dopamine transporter (DAT). Furthermore, we examined {{the presence of the}} α-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methyl- 4 -isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) -receptor subunit GluA 2 as well as colocalization with the post-synaptic density 95 (PSD 95) protein, within different spine subtypes (filopodia, stubby, long-thin, mushroom) using an immunohistochemistry and Golgi-Cox staining technique. The results revealed that social defeat induced a depression-like behavioral profile, as inferred from decreased social interaction levels, increased immobility on the tail suspension test, and decreases in body weight. Whole hippocampal immunoblots revealed decreases in GluA 2, with a concomitant increase in DAT and TH levels in the stressed group. Spine morphology analyses further showed that defeated mice displayed a significant decrease in stubby spines, and an increase in long-thin spines within the CA 1 stratum radiatum. Further evaluation of GluA 2 /PSD 95 containing-spines demonstrated a decrease of these markers within long-thin and mushroom spine types. Together, these results indicate that juvenile social stress induces GluA 2 - and dopamine-associated dysregulation in the hippocampus – a neurobiological mechanism potentially underlying the development of mood-related syndromes as a consequence of adolescent bullying...|$|E
40|$|CONTEXT: Smoking, {{which may}} be {{initiated}} {{as a response to}} stress during <b>adolescence,</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>risk</b> for periodontal disease among adults. Only limited information is available on the effect of smoking on South African adolescents’ oral health. Given that the sense of coherence (SOC) construct seeks to explain the relationship between coping with life stresses and maintaining health, this study sought to examine the independent influence of smoking and SOC on the gingival health of a cohort of rural black South African adolescents. METHODS: This 18 -month longitudinal study involved a three-wave questionnaire survey and clinical oral examination of a representative sample of 8 th-graders from 11 randomly selected high schools in Limpopo province, South Africa (n= 970). Using a generalized estimating equation (GEE) model, we prospectively examined the correlates of experiencing recent or persistent gingivitis, defined as self-reporting recent or persistent frequent bleeding gums. Explanatory variables included baseline socio-economic status, age, gender, plaque levels, tooth-brushing frequency, smoking and snuff use status and SOC levels (measured on a six-item scale with cronbach alpha= 0. 63). Results: Among our sample, 74. 6 % self-reported experiencing gingivitis at some point during follow-up, while 41. 9 % self-reported gingivitis at the last survey. Factors that were positively associated with recent or persistent gingivitis include living in poor households (odds ratio [OR] = 1. 49; p< 0. 01), having higher plaque levels (OR = 1. 18; p= 0. 04) and smoking regularly (OR = 1. 57; p= 0. 04). Recent or persistent gingivitis was negatively associated with being female (OR = 0. 76; p= 0. 02) and having higher SOC (OR = 0. 96; p< 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the integration of smoking prevention with oral health promotion programmes. In addition, poverty alleviation and teaching of stress-coping skills may be important interventions for promoting adolescents’ gingival health.

40|$|Turkish {{adolescents}} in the Netherlands have more mental health problems, especially emotional problems, than Dutch adolescents. It is unclear what happens with this disparity when adolescents grow up into adults and whether it has consequences for social opportunities in adulthood. Further, {{little is known about}} the determinants of mental health problems of Turkish young adults in the Netherlands. In this thesis we will give more insight in the development of Turkish migrant {{adolescents in}}to young adults with regard to mental health. Herein <b>a</b> comparison <b>is</b> made with the development of Dutch native adolescents. Turkish young adults had more emotional problems than Dutch young adults (chapter 3). These differences were about 50 % smaller than the differences in adolescence, due to a larger decrease in emotional problems among the Turkish group (chapter 4). This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> positive development for Turkish youth. In young adulthood cultural adaptation predicted emotional problems (chapter 5). Cultural adaptation was little associated with smoking behavior, but many well-known determinants, in particular low education, were predictors of smoking behavior (chapter 6). Emotional and behavioral problems in <b>adolescence</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>risk</b> factor for low educational and occupational attainment for women, and <b>a</b> <b>risk</b> factor for low occupational attainment in men (chapters 7 & 8). Together with the higher prevalence of especially emotional problems in Turkish adolescents, disparities in emotional problems form an important mediator in the development of ethnic disparities in social careers. The main recommendation for policy and mental health care is to improve signaling of emotional problems of Turkish adolescents (especially girls), in order to prevent long-term negative effects on social careers...|$|R

Research indicates that like adults with BPD, adolescents self-injure to regulate intensely negative emotions. Extensive neuroimaging research implicates the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), the amygdala, the {{anterior cingulate cortex}} (ACC), and their interconnections in the generation and regulation of emotional experience and expression. However, very little imaging {{research has been conducted}} with samples selected for SII, and only one functional imaging study with a small sample size has been conducted with self-injurying adolescents. In the present study, we used functional magnetic resonance to examine neural reactivity during presentation of facial exoressions of emotion among adolescent girls, ages 13 - 19, who engage in SII (n = 21), compared with normal controls (n = 21). An event-related design was implemented in which participants viewed angry, fearful, and neutral facial expressions during a gender typing task. Regions of interest analyses were performed for the amygdala, subgenual ACC and vmPFC/orbital PFC.

40|$|The Influence of ADHD and Adolescent Romantic Relationships on Early Adult Psychopathology in FemalesbyAndrea Lynne Stier Doctor of Philosophy in PsychologyUniversity of California, BerkeleyProfessor Stephen P. Hinshaw, Chair	Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{significantly}} impairing {{disorder of}} childhood that affects functioning across numerous domains, including academic, behavioral, and emotional functioning, through adolescence and into adulthood (Barkley, Murphy, & Fischer, 2007; Hinshaw, Owens, Sami, & Fargeon, 2006). Girls {{and women with}} ADHD have been understudied in past research. The current study uses a longitudinal design to investigate the romantic relationships of girls with and without ADHD during late adolescence and early adulthood {{in order to gain}} a deeper understanding of underlying relationship factors that may be detrimental or protective to their well-being. A large sample of girls with the Inattentive type of ADHD (ADHD/I; n = 47), the Combined type of ADHD (ADHD/C; n = 93), plus a matched comparison group of girls without ADHD (n = 88), were studied when they were 6 - 12 years of age. In a 10 -year prospective follow-up, the sample (age 17 - 22, n = 187) self-reported on the stability, onset, and quality of their romantic relationships, attachment style, relationship aggression, and risky sexual behavior. Girls' relationships were also assessed via information posted on girls' pages on networking websites (Facebook, MySpace), including comments from peers and partners, photographs, and girls' reports about themselves and their relationships. Self-concept, friendship quality and support, and quality and stability of family relationships were examined as potential mechanisms underlying positive or negative relationship effects. Results indicated that girls with ADHD continue to be quite impaired in adulthood relative to their non-ADHD peers with respect to internalizing and externalizing symptoms and that ADHD type (i. e., ADHD/I vs. ADHD/C) does not appear to moderate any such effects. Relative to comparison girls, girls with ADHD initiated dating behavior significantly earlier and showed a significant and sizably larger number of lifetime dating partners. Girls with ADHD also showed a marginally significant effect with regard to increased likelihood of engagement in early sexual intercourse (before age 15). There <b>was</b> also <b>a</b> marginally significant effect with regard to more severe and frequent victimization by relationship aggression and more severe relationship aggression perpetration in girls with ADHD relative to the comparison sample. For all girls, regardless of ADHD diagnosis, there were mixed findings with respect to the impact of romantic relationships: excessive engagement in romantic relationships in <b>adolescence</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>risk</b> factor for later adult externalizing problems, but engagement in a positive romantic relationship in early adulthood was associated with lower levels of concurrent externalizing and internalizing symptoms.

This {{study was conducted to}} clarify the type of injuries and to explore the demographic characteristics of injured individuals in Kerman. Methods: This cross sectional study was conducted in emergency wards of three major hospitals of Kerman from August 2002 through July 2003. Data were collected by trained interviewers on arrival of patients attending the emergency wards every fourth day via a questionnaire. The questionnaire had three parts: demographic characteristics, type of injury, and baseline characteristics of accidents. Results: The age range of the injured patients (61 %) was 15 - 39 years male to female ratio was 2 / 3. The educational level of the majority was less than high school (70 %). Traffic accident was {{the most common cause of}} injury (36. 6 %, CI= 35. 1 % 38. 1 %).

Ethnic identity moderated the relation between sexual abuse and AOD problem severity, such that ethnic identity demonstrated protective properties in the relation between sexual abuse and AOD problem severity.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to examine whether adolescents 2 ̆ 7 measured BMI and self- or mother 2 ̆ 7 s perception of weight status at age 14 are associated with depression at age 21. RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: The study participants <b>were</b> <b>a</b> subsample of 2017 participants of the Mater-University of Queensland Study of Pregnancy and Its Outcomes, a population-based birth cohort study, which commenced in 1981 in Brisbane, Australia, for whom measured BMI at ages 14 and 21 and information on self-reported mental health problems were available at the age 21 follow-up. A total of 1802 individuals had measured BMI and reported weight perception in a supplementary questionnaire at 14 years, and their self-reported mental health problems were reported at 21 years. Mental health was measured using Center for Epidemiology Studies Depression Scale and Young Adults Self-Reported depression/anxiety at 21 years of age. RESULTS: We found that both young adult males and females who perceived themselves as overweight at age 14 had more mental health problems compared with those who perceived themselves as the right weight. When we combined adolescents 2 ̆ 7 weight perception with their measured BMI categories, weight perception but not measured overweight was associated with mental health problems for males and females at age 21. This association remained after adjusting for potential confounders, including adolescents 2 ̆ 7 behavioral problems, family meals, diet, physical activity, and television watching. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the perception of being overweight during <b>adolescence</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> significant <b>risk</b> factor for depression in young adult men and women. The perception of being overweight during <b>adolescence</b> should <b>be</b> considered <b>a</b> possible target for a prevention intervention...|$|R
40|$|Background: An {{understanding}} of the relation in adolescents be-tween serum homocysteine and foods rich in vitamin B- 6, vitamin B- 12, and folate is important because high homocysteine concen-trations in childhood and <b>adolescence</b> may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>risk</b> factor for later cardiovascular disease. However, {{little is known about}} the relation between food intake and homocysteine in adolescents. Objective: Five years after national folic acid fortification of en-riched grain products, cross-sectional relations between food intake and serum homocysteine concentrations were examined in 2695 adolescents [x age: 18. 3 (range: 15 – 20) y] enrolled in the Child and Adolescent Trial for Cardiovascular Health. Design: A nonfasting blood specimen was analyzed for serum ho-mocysteine, folate, and vitamins B- 6 and B- 12. Dietary intake was assessed by using a food-frequency questionnaire. Multiple regres-sion analyses were used to evaluate the relation of intakes of whole grains, refined grains, fruit, vegetables, dairy products, red and pro-cessed meats, and poultry with serum homocysteine concentrations after adjustment for demographic characteristics, lifestyle factors, and food intake. Results: Serum homocysteine concentrations were lower with greater intakes of whole grains (P for trend 0. 002), refined grains (P for trend 0. 02), and dairy foods (P for trend 0. 001); were higher with greater intake of poultry (P for trend 0. 004); and were not related to intakes of fruit, vegetables, or red or processed meat. After additional adjustment for serum B vitamins, the relations of serum homocysteine with most food groups were attenuated. Conclusion: These observational findings suggest a beneficial ef-fect of whole-grain, refined-grain, and dairy products on serum ho-mocysteine concentrations in an adolescent population. Am...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to examine the role of perceived peer influence on the development of body image and eating problems in young adolescent girls over time. Specifically, {{this research}} will investigate (1) whether perceived peer influence is longitudinally associated with the development of eating problems (restrictive dieting or bulimic behaviours), and (2) whether this relationship is mediated by body dissatisfaction. Participants were 1094 female students from ten girls’ high schools in New South Wales who completed a battery of questionnaires at three time points, each one-year apart (Grades Seven, Eight and Nine). The battery included measures of perceived peer influence, body dissatisfaction, bulimic behaviours, dietary restraint, body mass index, and demographic information. Missing data were imputed using multiple imputation methods. A longitudinal mediational model was then developed in order {{to examine the relationship between}} the variables of interest across the three time points. The collected measures served as indicators for the following latent variables: perceived peer influence, body dissatisfaction, dieting and bulimic behaviours. Preliminary analyses showed that the observed variables related to the latent variables as anticipated (that is, the measurement model <b>was</b> <b>a</b> good fit to the data). A comprehensive structural equation modeling approach based on statistical recommendations from the literature will be used to examine pathways between the key variables. Final results will be presented at the conference. Given that early <b>adolescence</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> high <b>risk</b> period for the development of body image and eating problems, and that peers become an increasingly important source of influence during this time, studying these factors in concert may provide further insight into how the development of body image and eating problems may be interrupted. If perceived peer influence contributes significantly to the development of body dissatisfaction, and, in turn, eating problems, then it is important that the peer environment is addressed in prevention and intervention programs. 2 page(s...|$|R
40|$|International audiencePrevious studies {{revealed}} that <b>adolescence</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> period of <b>risk</b> for doping and drug addiction and that young athletes who used doping agents reported low self-esteem. We conducted a preventive {{study with the}} aims to investigate whether young adolescents displayed an attentional bias to doping-related words and whether this attentional bias was related to physical self-esteem. Method Ninety seven adolescents (44 girls and 53 boys) from 11 to 15 years-old participated to a study designed to measure reaction times (RT) in a Stroop emotional task related to doping, cheating and control words. They also completed the Physical Self-Perception Profile subscales assessing perceived general self-esteem, physical self-worth, physical condition, sport competence, body attractiveness, and physical strength. Results Participants exhibited longer RT after doping words than after control words. RT was also longer after doping than after cheating words. Participants belonging to the low physical self-esteem group exhibited larger carry-over effects {{than those who were}} in the high physical self-esteem group. Conclusions These findings suggest that attentional resources allocated to doping words are already present at the onset of adolescence, and that they may <b>be</b> linked to <b>a</b> psychological feature (physical self-esteem) considered as <b>a</b> <b>risk</b> factor of substance abuse in young adults involved in competitive sports...|$|R
40|$|The {{association}} between leisure time {{physical activity in}} adolescence and poor mental health in early adulthood: a prospective cohort study Per Hoegh Poulsen*, Karin Biering and Johan Hviid Andersen Background: The incidence of poor mental health (MH) is increasing in Denmark and worldwide, especially among 16 – 24 year olds. Low physical activity (PA) during <b>adolescence</b> seems to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>risk</b> factor for poor MH in early adulthood. Among adults, it appears that {{a high level of}} PA may be protective against poor MH.

40|$|The {{evidence}} for a hypothesis that eating salted fish is associated with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is reviewed. The hypothesis was tested among Malaysian Chinese using a matched case-control design. The kinds of salted fish and patterns of use were also investigated in a control group comprising 100 Chinese, 50 Malay and 50 Indian households. During 1980, in Selangor, Malaysia, interviews with 100 Chinese cases of NPC and 100 non-disease controls indicated that salted fish consumption during childhood <b>was</b> <b>a</b> significant <b>risk</b> (relative RISK = 3. 0, P = 0. 04), with <b>an</b> elevated <b>risk</b> for daily as opposed to less frequent consumption. Salted fish consumption during <b>adolescence</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> less significant <b>risk,</b> and current consumption not at all. There were 19 kinds of fishes reported as being eaten as salted fish by the 200 control households. There were marked differences between ethnic groups in preference for different kinds: Chinese preferred red snapper (74 % of households), Malay jewfish (54 %) and Indian red snapper (28 %). Salted fish was hardly ever eaten daily by any household; weekly <b>was</b> <b>a</b> moderate frequency in all ethnic groups; less than weekly most common. There were {{no statistically significant differences}} between Chinese NPC case and non-disease control participants in kind of salted fish eaten.

40|$|Graduation date: 2008 A {{majority}} of states require parental consent or notification before a minor {{may have an}} abortion. Parental involvement laws are {{based in part on}} the assumption that abortion poses <b>a</b> <b>risk</b> to the psychological health of adolescents. Previous research has catalogued the risks to adolescent mothers and their children posed by early childbearing, the alternative to abortion. The health risks of delaying abortion also have been documented. Few studies, however, have attempted to quantify the risks of abortion to adolescents' mental health. Research suggests that associations between abortion and depression demonstrated in some studies of adult women may be spurious and reflect unmeasured covariates, such as intendedness of the pregnancy. This study used secondary data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) to test whether having an abortion put adolescent women at risk for developing depression in the short term and over time. Respondents were interviewed three times, in 1994 - 1995 (Wave I), 1996 (Wave II), and in 2001 (Wave III). Logistic regression was used to test whether adolescents who had an abortion between Waves I and II had <b>an</b> increased <b>risk</b> for developing depression. Adolescents who had <b>an</b> abortion <b>were</b> compared with adolescents who also became pregnant but did not have an abortion and with the larger sample of female adolescents. Abortion was not associated with developing depression, either in the short term or over time. Unintended pregnancy between Waves I and II also was not significant in predicting depression. Prior pregnancy (before Wave I), however, did predict depression five years later. Thus, this study found no evidence to support legal restrictions on abortion for minors on the basis of increased risk of depression. However, findings do suggest that pregnancy in early <b>adolescence</b> may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>risk</b> factor for developing depression in young adulthood. The relationship between adolescent pregnancy and later depression underscores the need for effective pregnancy prevention programs in early adolescence...|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. July 2009. Major: Educational Psychology. Advisors: Theodore Christ, Sandra Christenson. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); v, 85 pages, appendices A-B. <b>Adolescence</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> time when <b>risk</b> behaviors begin to increase through experimentation with health risk {{behaviors such as}} substance used and reckless driving and exploratory risk behaviors such as asking someone on a date and standing up to peers. It is likely that some risk-taking is necessary {{in the course of}} social and academic development throughout childhood and adolescence. A shift in the adolescent risk behavior research from a focus on health related behaviors to physical and psychological well-being with a link to educational attainment has gained strength, but the goals of this movement are incomplete. Research is needed to better understand the positive outcomes of health risk and exploratory <b>risk</b> behaviors, and <b>a</b> measure that includes both exploratory risk behavior and health risk behavior is needed. The Adolescent Exploratory and Risk Behavior Rating Scale (AERRS) was developed to address this need. The AERRS was developed using both classical test theory and item response theory methods. The participants were 682 high school students in the Midwest. The results suggest that the developed measure has adequate reliability. The initial examination of validity resulted in a factor structure in which health risk behaviors and exploratory risk behaviors fall into separate factors with some gender differences noted. The item response theory results suggest that <b>risk</b> behavior <b>is</b> <b>a</b> spectrum of behaviors with exploratory behaviors falling on one end and health risk behavior on {{the opposite end of the}} spectrum. It was concluded that the AERRS <b>is</b> <b>a</b> reliable measure that has the potential to become a key assessment that has many potential uses in both academic research and applied settings, such as schools...|$|R

Although {{the symptoms of}} urticaria may increase stress, this association is not fully understood. Our aim was to analyze the risk of depression following a diagnosis of urticaria using a nationwide population-based study. MethodsWe examined the Taiwan Longitudinal Health Insurance Database. Patients who {{had a history of}} urticaria or depression prior to the study period <b>were</b> excluded. <b>A</b> total of 6742 adolescents (aged 13 – 18 years) who <b>were</b> hospitalized for <b>a</b> first-attack urticaria episode between 2006 and 2009 <b>were</b> recruited as <b>a</b> study group, together with 20, 226 matched nonurticaria enrollees as a control group. Each patient was prospectively followed for 1 year to identify episodes of depression. Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare the risk of depression between the study and control groups, making adjustments for the patients' places of residence and sociodemographic characteristics. Depression-free survival curves were also analyzed. Finally, the risks of depression were analyzed between various age groups. ResultsA total of 63 (0. 9 %) adolescents with urticaria and 61 (0. 3 %) nonurticarial control individuals suffered a new-onset episode of depression during the follow-up period. The stratified Cox proportional analysis indicated that the crude hazard ratio of depression among adolescents with urticaria was 1. 86 times (95 % confidence interval, 1. 25 – 2. 98) that of the control individuals without urticaria. Patients who were 16 – 18 years of age and who had a history of asthma were more likely to suffer from depression (p <  0. 05 for both). Finally, urticaria was determined to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>risk</b> factor for depression only during adolescence and not in patients aged < 13 years (n =  6745) or those aged between 19 years and 24 years (n =  7185).
