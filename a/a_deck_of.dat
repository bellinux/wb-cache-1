5|$|Before play begins, the Dungeon Master (or DM, {{the player}} who organizes and directs the game play) {{randomly}} draws five cards from <b>a</b> <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> six. Two of these cards determine the locations of two magical weapons useful in defeating Strahd: the Holy Symbol and the Sunsword. The next two cards determine the locations of Strahd and the Tome of Strahd, a book that details Strahd's long-ago unrequited love. In this work, it is revealed that Strahd {{had fallen in love}} with a young girl, who in turn loved his younger brother. Strahd blamed his age for the rejection, and made a pact with evil powers to live forever. He then slew his brother, but the young girl killed herself in response, and Strahd found that he had become a vampire. All six possible locations are inside Castle Ravenloft.|$|E
5|$|Diệm's {{advertising}} {{included the}} parading of giant pageant-style floats of Bảo Đại {{through the streets}} of Saigon, depicted with bags of money on his shoulders, <b>a</b> <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> cards in his hands, and with naked blonde women and bottles of cognac in his arms. This was a reference to the head of state's reputation for opulence, gambling and womanising. In particular, the blonde hair referred to Bảo Đại's purported penchant for European mistresses with whom he liaised on the French Riviera. Bảo Đại's dummy was accompanied by that of a Frenchman putting gold into his pockets, thereby questioning his nationalist credentials. Posters and effigies associating Bảo Đại with a pig's head were disseminated, while a prominent newspaper composed and encouraged the people to sing insulting songs about Bảo Đại.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, {{a remnant}} of the {{earliest}} known bridge-like structure in London was discovered alongside Vauxhall Bridge, when shifting currents washed away a layer of silt which had covered it. Dating to between 1550BC and 300BC, it consists of two rows of wooden posts, which it is believed would originally have carried <b>a</b> <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> some kind. It is believed {{that it did not}} cross the whole river, but instead connected the south bank to an island, possibly used for burial of the dead. As no mention of this or similar structures in the area is made in Julius Caesar's account of crossing the Thames nor by any other Roman author, it is presumed that the structure had been dismantled or destroyed prior to Caesar's expedition to Britain in 55BC. The posts are still visible at extreme low tides.|$|E
50|$|The game uses <b>a</b> small <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> brown cards, and <b>a</b> large <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> green cards. Each brown card {{contains}} a sentence with a missing word. The green cards contain random {{words that are}} used to fill the missing word.|$|R

50|$|Similar to B series, K-Series has {{two short}} blocks {{with the same}} design; the only {{difference}} between them being the deck height. K20 uses the short block with <b>a</b> <b>deck</b> height <b>of</b> 212mm where K23 and K24 block has <b>a</b> <b>deck</b> height <b>of</b> 231.5mm.|$|R
5|$|Sora, Donald, Goofy, and Jiminy Cricket {{walk down}} a winding path in search of Riku and King Mickey. A man dressed in a black, hooded coat appears and directs Sora towards a massive {{fortress}} called Castle Oblivion. Upon entering, the travelers realize that they have forgotten all of their abilities. The hooded man explains that the deeper {{they go into the}} castle, the more memories they will lose, but they will also uncover new memories in the process. He creates <b>a</b> <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> cards made from Sora's and his friends' memories, and tells them that everything they encounter in this castle will be based on their memories.|$|E
5|$|Enemies appear on-screen, and can {{be engaged}} by {{clicking}} on them. During the player's turn, three cards are randomly drawn from <b>a</b> <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> nine, each resulting in an attack. If the cards' combined strength and attached skills are insufficient to exhaust the enemy's HP, the heartless will counterattack. If the player survives this attack, or continues by spending additional AP, a new turn begins. Upon defeating an enemy, the player earns Lux (which unlocks rewards as it accumulates, but resets weekly), experience points (through which the player advances in level), and Munny (an in-game currency). The player also earns Fragments, cards based on the characters original to the Kingdom Hearts series and those from Disney and Final Fantasy franchises: the fragments are imbued with different properties depending on the character, such as physical or elemental strikes. Players can level up their cards to improve their attack and defense. Players can strengthen their Keyblade using materials found in each world, and new Keyblades are acquired as the story progresses. Each strengthens different types of cards; for example, Starlight is an all-around Keyblade offering boosts for Power-, Speed- and Magic-type cards, while the Snow White-inspired Treasure Trove is Power-type focused.|$|E

5|$|Tetra Master is a card-based minigame {{that can}} be {{initiated}} with various non-playable characters in the field. Players assemble <b>a</b> <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> five cards, which can be obtained via chests, given as a reward, or earned from fighting monsters. Each card has various arrows which point to the four sides and {{four corners of the}} card, and various stats that vary between cards, with rarer cards being more powerful. Players take it in turns to strategically place cards on a 4x4 playing grid based on the available directions. Battles can occur when players place a card next to another card, depending on where the player places it. If the defending card has no arrows whilst the attacking card has an arrow pointing towards it, that card is placed under the player's control. When two arrows meet with each other, the cards do battle based on their point values, with the losing card coming under the winning player's control, sometimes triggering combos that put multiple cards in the winner's control. After all cards are played, the winner is the player who has the most cards under their control, with a draw occurring if they have the same number of cards. The winning player may choose a card from their opponent's deck out of the ones they put under their control. If the winning player scores a perfect win however, in which all ten cards are put under their control, they will win all five cards from the opponent's deck.|$|E

25|$|There are {{literally}} hundreds of different divinatory techniques in the world. However, Western occult practice mostly includes the use of astrology (calculating the influence of heavenly bodies), bibliomancy (reading random passages from a book, such as Liber Legis or the I Ching), tarot (<b>a</b> <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> 78 cards, each with symbolic meaning, usually {{laid out in a}} meaningful pattern), and geomancy (a method of making random marks on paper or in earth that results in a combination of sixteen patterns).|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{reason for}} the use of one-pass assemblers was speed of assembly – often a second pass would require rewinding and rereading the program source on tape or rereading <b>a</b> <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> cards or punched paper tape. Later computers with much larger memories (especially disc storage), had the space to perform all necessary processing without such re-reading. The advantage of the multi-pass assembler is that the absence of errata makes the linking process (or the program load if the assembler directly produces executable code) faster.|$|E
