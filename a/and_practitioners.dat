5|$|Although advocates <b>and</b> <b>practitioners</b> of {{scientific}} jury selection claim {{the practice is}} overwhelmingly effective at choosing juries that will render the desired verdict, its true effect is often more difficult to discern. Part of this difficulty is in duplicating the conditions of a real trial. In one experiment, two kinds of shadow juries watched a trial and rendered a verdict. The {{results indicated that the}} juries were substantially different, but that this difference was likely due to the two experimental juries’ knowledge that they were not deciding an actual verdict, prompting a lower burden of proof.|$|E
5|$|Barbauld's {{pedagogy}} was fundamentally {{based on}} John Locke's Some Thoughts Concerning Education (1693), {{the most influential}} pedagogical treatise in 18th-century Britain. Building on Locke's theory of the Association of Ideas, which he had outlined in Some Thoughts, philosopher David Hartley had developed an associationist psychology that greatly influenced writers such as Barbauld (who had read Joseph Priestley's redaction of it). For the first time, educational theorists <b>and</b> <b>practitioners</b> were {{thinking in terms of}} developmental psychology. As a result, Barbauld and the women writers she influenced produced the first graded texts and the first body of literature designed for an age-specific readership.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to investigate academic <b>and</b> <b>practitioner</b> understandings of the term employee engagement. The sample consisted of 13 academic participants from Industrial Psychology/Human Resource departments of universities across South Africa <b>and</b> 8 <b>practitioner</b> participants from organisations and consulting firms across the Gauteng region. The aim of the research was to determine the similarities and differences between academic <b>and</b> <b>practitioner</b> understandings of employee engagement, to determine employee engagements relationship with other well-known constructs, namely, affective commitment, job involvement and organisational citizenship behaviour, and to determine the uniqueness and importance of the construct employee engagement. Participants were emailed a questionnaire comprising of both open-ended and close-ended questions. It was found that academic <b>and</b> <b>practitioner</b> understandings of employee engagement were similar and reflected what is said in both the academic <b>and</b> <b>practitioner</b> literature. Both academic <b>and</b> <b>practitioner</b> participants used similar words to describe the concept that are indicative of something extra that a person feels towards his/her work or organisation that results in the person working hard and passionately resulting in positive consequences for both the individual and the organisation. Both academic <b>and</b> <b>practitioner</b> participants also found employee engagement to be different to, or include small aspects of other well-known constructs such as affective commitment, job involvement and organisational citizenship behaviour. Both academic <b>and</b> <b>practitioner</b> participants found employee engagement to be an important construct that organisations should address due to it‟s various positive organisational and individual consequences. It was concluded that further research of the construct is necessary so that engagement can be better understood, interpreted and utilised in both the academic <b>and</b> <b>practitioner</b> arenas...|$|R

5|$|After Khan's {{departure}} from Comilla, the cooperative's model failed in independent Bangladesh because {{only a few}} occupational groups managed to achieve the desired success. By 1979, only 61 of the 400 cooperatives were functioning. The model actually fell prey to the ineffective internal and external controls, stagnation, and diversion of funds. This prompted the subsequent scholars <b>and</b> <b>practitioners</b> in microfinance, such as Muhammad Yunus of Grameen Bank and Fazle Hasan Abed of BRAC, to abandon the cooperative approach in favour of more centralised control and service delivery structures. The new strategy targeted the poorest villagers, while excluding the 'less poor'.
