Craig was given another chance while Rachael was eliminated.|$|R

5|$|Strathcona County and the Regional Municipality (RM) of Wood Buffalo {{are home}} to the unincorporated hamlets of Sherwood Park and Fort McMurray respectively. These {{communities}} are designated urban service areas, which <b>are</b> <b>deemed</b> equivalents of cities.

5|$|To {{improve the}} {{leaching}} {{process in the}} gold cyanidation, lead(II) nitrate solution is added. Although a bulk process, only limited amounts (10 to 100milligrams lead(II) nitrate per kilogram gold) are required. Both the cyanidation itself, {{as well as the}} use of lead compounds in the process, <b>are</b> <b>deemed</b> controversial due to the compounds' toxic nature.|$|E
5000|$|Whilst {{athletes may}} <b>be</b> <b>deemed</b> {{to have a}} {{disability}} or impairment, this does not guarantee classification. Athletes may <b>be</b> <b>deemed</b> ineligible to compete based {{on any of the}} following findings: ...|$|R

30|$|A mentolabial {{angle of}} {{approximately}} 107 ° to 118 ° <b>was</b> <b>deemed</b> the most attractive, {{with a range}} of up to 140 ° deemed acceptable. Angles above or below this range were perceived as unattractive, and anything outside the range of below 98 ° or above 162 ° <b>was</b> <b>deemed</b> very unattractive. A deep mentolabial angle (84 °) or an almost flat angle (162 °) <b>was</b> <b>deemed</b> the least attractive.|$|R
5|$|All NHLs {{are also}} {{included}} on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), a list of historic properties that the National Park Service deems to be worthy of preservation. The NHLs in Michigan comprise approximately 2% of the 1,757 properties and districts listed on the National Register of Historic Places in Michigan as of January 2012. The primary difference between a NHL and a NRHP listing is that the NHLs are determined to have national significance, while other NRHP properties <b>are</b> <b>deemed</b> significant at the local or state level.|$|E
5|$|Allocations {{will be made}} to firms who {{undertake}} {{activities that}} <b>are</b> <b>deemed</b> to be both 'trade-exposed' and 'emissions-intensive'. Moderately emissions intensive activities will receive allocations equal to 60% of the industry average for the financial years ending 2007, 2008 and 2009. Highly emissions intensive industries will receive allocations equal to 90% of the industry average for this period. Allocation per unit of output will decrease by 1.3% per year from 2013 (on an exponential basis rather than a summation basis).|$|E
5|$|Another initiative, {{presented}} by the late Mayor Thomas Menino, is the Renew Boston Whole Building Incentive, which reduces {{the cost of living}} in buildings that <b>are</b> <b>deemed</b> energy efficient. This, much like the green housing developments, gives people of low socioeconomic status an opportunity to find housing in communities that support the environment. The ultimate goal of this initiative is to enlist 500 Bostonians to participate in a free, in-home energy assessment.|$|E

Angles above or below this range are perceived as unattractive, and anything outside the range of below 98 ° or above 162 ° <b>is</b> <b>deemed</b> very unattractive.

5|$|The former Spanish Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero {{is often}} mocked {{in his own}} country for his facial {{resemblance}} to Mr. Bean, and a computer hacker broke into Spain's official website for its presidency of the European Union, inserting the character {{on the front page of}} the website. Satirists have also compared Zapatero to Mr. Bean when discussing government policies that <b>are</b> <b>deemed</b> to have been unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|The infrageneric {{classification}} of the fungus is unclear, and {{depends on what}} taxonomic characters <b>are</b> <b>deemed</b> most important. According to Takahashi, the mushroom's violet pigment, the inamyloid (not staining when treated with Melzer's reagent) hymenophoral tissue (hymenium-bearing tissue), and the smooth hyphae of the outer layer of stem suggest a placement in the section Adonideae (Fr.) Quel., {{as defined by the}} Dutch Mycena specialist Maas Geesteranus. However, if greater taxonomic emphasis is placed on the weakly amyloid basidiospores, it would be more appropriate in the section Fragilipedes (Fr.) Quél.|$|E
5|$|Those {{with either}} {{definite}} pulmonary AVMs or an abnormal contrast echocardiogram with no clearly visible lesions <b>are</b> <b>deemed</b> {{to be at}} risk from brain emboli. They are therefore counselled to avoid scuba diving, during which small air bubbles may form in the bloodsteam that may migrate to the brain and cause stroke. Similarly, antimicrobial prophylaxis is advised during procedures in which bacteria may enter the bloodstream, such as dental work, and avoidance of air bubbles during intravenous therapy.|$|E

However, he receives a letter from his mother in India, reminding him of his arranged marriage to Manjula, the daughter of a family friend. Not wanting to get married, Apu asks Homer for advice, who suggests Apu tell his mother that he is already married. Days later, Apu thinks that he has escaped the marriage until he sees his mother walking towards the Kwik-E-Mart. To cover him, Homer tells Apu to pretend that Marge is his wife.|$|E
5|$|Elections for {{president}} occur {{every five years}} by a national vote. Candidates, {{as soon as they}} <b>are</b> <b>deemed</b> eligible under Article 80 of the Constitution, are tasked with collecting signatures from eligible voters. After 100,000 signatures are collected and certified, the candidate is declared to be official by the Central Elections Committee. In the voting, the secret ballots are collected directly from eligible voters. During the first round of voting, if a candidate earns fifty percent plus one of the votes, they are declared the President-elect. If no one has achieved that number during the first round, then a run-off election will occur between two candidates who won the most votes. The person who wins the most votes in the run-off is declared the President-elect.|$|E

5|$|In a {{range of}} studies, {{participants}} have been requested to answer general knowledge questions, each of which had two possible answers, and also to estimate their chances of answering each question correctly. If the participants had a sufficient degree of self-knowledge, their level of confidence in regard to each answer they gave would be high for the questions they answered correctly and lower for the ones they answered wrong. However, this generally is not the case. Many people are overconfident; indeed, studies show that most people systematically overestimate their own abilities. Moreover, people are overconfident {{about their ability to}} answer questions that <b>are</b> <b>deemed</b> to be hard but underconfident on questions that are considered easy.|$|E

5|$|Relay {{races are}} the only track and field event in which a team of runners {{directly}} compete against other teams. Typically, a team {{is made up of}} four runners of the same sex. Each runner completes their specified distance (referred to as a leg) before handing over a baton to a teammate, who then begins their leg upon receiving the baton. There is usually a designated area where athletes must exchange the baton. Teams may be disqualified if they fail to complete the change within the area, or if the baton is dropped during the race. A team may also be disqualified if its runners <b>are</b> <b>deemed</b> to have wilfully impeded other competitors.|$|E
