5000|$|Sulfate {{reduction}} can be dissimilatory or assimilatory. Sulfate reduction by sulfate-reducing bacteria, for example, is dissimilatory; {{the purpose}} of reducing the sulfate is to produce energy, and the sulfide is excreted. Dissimilatory sulfate reduction utilizes the enzymes <b>ATP</b> <b>sulfurylase,</b> APS reductase, and sulfite reductase. [...] In assimilatory sulfate reduction, however, the sulfate is assimilated, or incorporated into organic compounds. In some organisms (e.g., gut flora, cyanobacteria, and yeast), assimilatory sulfate reduction is a more complex process that makes use of the enzymes <b>ATP</b> <b>sulfurylase,</b> APS kinase, PAPS reductase, and sulfite reductase.|$|E

50|$|The system {{relied on}} fixing nebulized and adapter-ligated DNA {{fragments}} to small DNA-capture beads in a water-in-oil emulsion. The DNA fixed to these beads was then amplified by PCR.

50|$|The protein {{complexes}} {{responsible for}} these chemical conversions — Sat, Apr and Dsr — are found in all currently known organisms that perform dissimilatory sulfate reduction. Energetically, sulfate is a poor electron acceptor for microorganisms as the sulfate-sulfite redox couple is E0' -516 mV, which is too negative to allow reduction by NADH or ferrodoxin that are the primary intracellular electron mediators. To overcome this issue, sulfate is first converted into APS by the enzyme <b>ATP</b> <b>sulfurylase</b> (Sat), {{at the cost of}} a single ATP molecule. The APS-sulfite redox couple has a E0' of -60 mV, which allows APS to be reduced by either NADH or reduced ferrodoxin using the enzyme adenylyl-sulfate reductase (Apr), which requires the input of 2 electrons. In the final step, sulfite is reduced by the dissimilatory sulfite reductase (Dsr) to form sulfide, requiring the input of 6 electrons.|$|E

The <b>ATP</b> <b>sulfurylase</b> activity in transgenic cells was 8 -fold that in control cells, and was correlated with {{the expression of a}} specific polypeptide revealed by western analysis using an anti-ATP sulfurylase antibody. The molecular mass of this polypeptide agreed with that for the overexpressed mature protein. <b>ATP</b> <b>sulfurylase</b> overexpression had no effect on [35 S]SO 42 − influx or <b>ATP</b> <b>sulfurylase</b> activity regulation by S availability, except that <b>ATP</b> <b>sulfurylase</b> activity variations in response to S starvation in transgenic cells were 8 times higher than in the wild type. There were also no differences in cell growth or sensitivity to SeO 42 − (a toxic SO 42 − analog) between transgenic and wild-type cells.

40|$|<b>ATP</b> <b>sulfurylase</b> and 5 ′-adenylylsulfate (APS) reductase {{catalyze}} two {{reactions in}} the sulfate assimilation pathway. Cell fractionation of Arabidopsis leaves revealed that <b>ATP</b> <b>sulfurylase</b> isoenzymes {{exist in the}} chloroplast and the cytosol, whereas APS reductase is localized exclusively in chloroplasts. During development of Arabidopsis plants the total activity of <b>ATP</b> <b>sulfurylase</b> and APS reductase declines by 3 -fold in leaves. The decline in APS reductase {{can be attributed to}} a reduction of enzyme during aging of individual leaves, the highest activity occurring in the youngest leaves and the lowest in fully expanded leaves. By contrast, total <b>ATP</b> <b>sulfurylase</b> activity declines proportionally in all the leaves. The distinct behavior of <b>ATP</b> <b>sulfurylase</b> can be attributed to reciprocal expression of the chloroplast and cytosolic isoenzymes. The chloroplast form, representing the more abundant isoenzyme, declines in parallel with APS reductase during aging; however, the cytosolic form increases over the same period. In total, the results suggest that cytosolic <b>ATP</b> <b>sulfurylase</b> plays a specialized function that is probably unrelated to sulfate reduction.

Both of these anions derepress <b>ATP</b> <b>sulfurylase</b> in cells growing on sulfate, {{but not in}} cells growing on L-cysteine. However, the two anions appear to derepress by different mechanisms. Molybdate caused derepression only at concentrations that were in excess over sulfate and were sufficient to inhibit growth and protein accumulation, indicating that the derepression resulted from sulfur starvation. Selenate caused derepression at one-tenth the concentration of sulfate, a concentration of selenate that was subtoxic, while toxic levels of selenate produced far less derepression. The susceptibility of the tobacco cells to selenate toxicity was high under conditions of sulfur nutrition that derepress <b>ATP</b> <b>sulfurylase,</b> and low under conditions that repress <b>ATP</b> <b>sulfurylase,</b> {{in agreement with the}} idea that selenate acts via a functional sulfate assimilation pathway. Since it is known that selenate is incorporated into analogs of sulfur compounds, it is proposed that the tobacco cells synthesize the seleno-analog of the end product of the sulfate pathway responsible for repression, and the seleno-analog antagonizes the normal end product in the repression mechanism, the net result being derepression of <b>ATP</b> <b>sulfurylase</b> by selenate...|$|E

The utilization of reduced sulfur compounds to fuel CO 2 fixation by the still-uncultured bacterial endosymbionts provides the basis of nutrition in invertebrates, such as the tubeworm Riftia pachyptila, found at deep-sea hydrothermal vents. The symbiont-containing trophosome tissue contains high levels of <b>ATP</b> <b>sulfurylase</b> activity, facilitating the recent purification of the enzyme. The gene encoding the <b>ATP</b> <b>sulfurylase</b> from the Riftia symbiont (sopT) has now been cloned and sequenced by using the partial amino acid sequence of the purified protein.

In this organism, the sat gene is located in one operon and co-transcribed with the aprMBA genes for membrane-bound APS reductase.

40|$|In earlier studies, the {{assimilation}} of selenate by plants appeared to be limited by its reduction, a step that {{is thought to be}} mediated by <b>ATP</b> <b>sulfurylase.</b> Here, the Arabidopsis APS 1 gene, encoding a plastidic <b>ATP</b> <b>sulfurylase,</b> was constitutively overexpressed in Indian mustard (Brassica juncea).

The APS plants showed increased selenate reduction: x-ray absorption spectroscopy showed that root and shoot tissues of mature APS plants contained mostly organic Se (possibly selenomethionine), whereas wild-type plants accumulated selenate. The APS plants were not able to reduce selenate when shoots were removed immediately before selenate was supplied. In addition, Se accumulation in APS plants was 2 - to 3 -fold higher in shoots and 1. 5 -fold higher in roots compared with wild-type plants, and Se tolerance was higher in both seedlings and mature APS plants.

The internal levels of SO 42 - and glutathione (GSH) declined after S starvation of the whole root system, but only GSH concentration declined in +S roots of plants from split root experiments. The concentration of GSH in phloem exudates decreased upon transfer of plants to S-free solution. Supplying GSH or cysteine to roots, either exogenously or internally via phloem sap, inhibited both <b>ATP</b> <b>sulfurylase</b> activity and SO 42 - uptake. Buthionine sulfoximine, an inhibitor of GSH synthesis, reversed the inhibitory effect of cysteine on <b>ATP</b> <b>sulfurylase.</b> It is hypothesized that GSH is responsible for mediating the responses to S availability. <b>ATP</b> <b>sulfurylase</b> activity and the SO 42 - uptake rate are regulated by similar demand-driven processes that involve the translocation of a phloem-transported message (possibly GSH) to the roots that provides information concerning the nutritional status of the leaves...|$|E

For example, microRNA 395 (miR 395), which targets three out of four isoforms of <b>ATP</b> <b>sulfurylase,</b> the first enzyme of sulfate assimilation, as well as a low-affinity sulfate transporter, SULTR 2; 1, is strongly induced by sulfate deficiency. However, other components of sulfate assimilation are induced by sulfate starvation, so that the role of miR 395 is counterintuitive. Here, we describe the regulation of miR 395 and its targets by sulfate starvation. We show that miR 395 is important for the increased translocation of sulfate to the shoots during sulfate starvation. MiR 395 together with the SULFUR LIMITATION 1 transcription factor maintain optimal levels of <b>ATP</b> <b>sulfurylase</b> transcripts to enable increased flux through the sulfate assimilation pathway in sulfate-deficient plants. Reduced expression of <b>ATP</b> <b>sulfurylase</b> (ATPS) alone affects both sulfate translocation and flux, but SULTR 2; 1 is important for the full rate of sulfate translocation to the shoots. Thus, miR 395 is an integral part of the regulatory circuit controlling plant sulfate assimilation with a complex mechanism of action...|$|E
