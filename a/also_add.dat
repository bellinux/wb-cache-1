5|$|When SpongeBob SquarePants is {{broadcast}} in non-English languages, the voice actors dubbing SpongeBob's voice use Tom Kenny's {{rendition of the}} character {{as a starting point}} but <b>also</b> <b>add</b> unique elements. For example, in the French version of the series, SpongeBob speaks with a slight Daffy Duck-style lisp.|$|E
5|$|Despite its age, Worms Armageddon still {{receives}} periodic updates, {{mainly from}} two programmers known as Deadcode and CyberShadow, recruited by Team17. These updates address bugs and compatibility issues, and <b>also</b> <b>add</b> new features to the game, such as {{support for a}} greater number of worms in a match and support for arbitrarily-sized colour levels. The latest update was on 19 March 2013.|$|E
5|$|On 9 December 2016, it was {{announced}} that the segment between Highway 407 and Stouffville Road would be widened from six to eight lanes, and that an HOV lane would be added in each direction. The project will <b>also</b> <b>add</b> a carpool lot at Major Mackenzie Drive, upgrade overpasses at Highway 7 and 16th Avenue, and replace the Rouge River overpass. The project will start in 2017 and is expected to be completed in 2021.|$|E
50|$|Under the {{direction}} of Dr. Ken Graham, Superintendent of Schools, the school recently added on a $15 million gym complex, as well as extensive remodeling to the sports fields located on the campus. This expansion <b>also</b> <b>added</b> eight new classrooms to the academic structure of the building. The expansion <b>also</b> <b>added</b> a Senior Lounge to the building. The expansion <b>also</b> <b>added</b> a new Literacy Center adjacent to the Senior Lounge. The expansion <b>also</b> <b>added</b> new parking lot space. The expansion was {{under the supervision of}} The Rush Henrietta Central School District. The expansion is set to be completed in September 2014.|$|R
50|$|During {{this time}} period, the airline <b>also</b> <b>added</b> {{additional}} frequencies {{to many of}} its international routes, including to Singapore, Bangkok, Beijing and Shanghai from Jakarta, while it <b>also</b> <b>added</b> capacity to Denpasar-Seoul. It also re-opened routes, including Jakarta-Taipei in 2012.|$|R

5|$|Users can <b>also</b> <b>add</b> and delete icons {{from the}} dock, {{which is the}} same on every home screen. Each home screen holds up to twenty icons, and the dock holds up to six icons. Users can delete Web Clips and {{third-party}} applications at any time, and may select only certain applications for transfer from iTunes. Apple's default programs, however, may not be removed.|$|E
5|$|Frequent radio {{transmissions}} through the player's communications device <b>also</b> <b>add</b> to the atmosphere, by broadcasting certain sounds and messages from non-player characters meant to unsettle the player. Early in the game, during and directly {{after the event}} that plunges the base into chaos, the player often hears the sounds of fighting, screaming and dying through their radio transmitter. The ambient sound is extended to the base itself through such things as hissing pipes, footsteps, and occasional jarringly loud noises from machinery or other sources. Often ambient sounds can be heard that resemble deep breathing, unexplained voices and demonic taunting from the game's antagonists.|$|E
5|$|Studies of {{the water}} quality of the lake in 1983–84 {{indicate}} a decline in quality since the 1965–66 analysis. Scientific research over the years also reveal that Telbal, Botkal, and sewage drains are responsible for a substantial influx of nitrogen and phosphorus into the lake. Quantitatively, fifteen drains and several other sources have released a total of 156.62 tonnes (56.36 tonnes by drains alone) of phosphorus, and 241.18 tonnes of inorganic nitrogen into the lake from a discharge of 11.701 million cubic metres /year. Non-point sources, such as seepage and diffused runoff, <b>also</b> <b>add</b> to this pollution and have been recorded as further adding 4.5 tonnes of total phosphates and 18.14 tonnes of nitrogen (NO3–N and NH4–N) to the lake. Based on the values mentioned above, it has been inferred that the water quality of the lake has deteriorated.|$|E

50|$|In 1978, the {{military}} intelligence agency was <b>also</b> <b>added</b> to the oversight {{responsibilities of the}} committee. In 1996 the oversight of foreigners registered by the agencies was <b>also</b> <b>added</b> to the oversight responsibilities. The committee is appointed by the Minister of Justice and consist of a chairman and three members.|$|R
5|$|At Exit 33 (I-95/John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway), both {{highways}} {{had crossed}} over themselves {{so that all}} through traffic was {{on the left side}} of the road with left-hand entrance/exit ramps connecting the crossover sections. This interchange is currently being replaced by a more conventional flyover ramp interchange, as part of the I-95 expansion project under construction since 2007, eliminating the left-turn ramps and I-95's double crossovers. So far, several ramps have been completed, with the ramp from northbound I-95 to eastbound I-695 completed in September 2008, the ramp from westbound I-695 to northbound I-95 completed in October 2008, the ramp from northbound I-95 to westbound I-695 completed in November 2008 (eliminating the left-hand exit), and the ramp from eastbound I-695 to southbound I-95 was completed in May 2009. The ramps from southbound I-95 to both westbound and eastbound I-695 were completed in June 2009 and the ramp from westbound I-695 to southbound I-695 was completed in July 2009 and the ramp from eastbound I-695 to northbound I-95 opened in August 2009. In addition to rebuilding these ramps, the project will <b>also</b> <b>add</b> four ramps to service the high-occupancy toll lanes being added to I-95.|$|E
5|$|COPD {{develops}} as {{a significant}} and chronic inflammatory response to inhaled irritants. Chronic bacterial infections may <b>also</b> <b>add</b> to this inflammatory state. The inflammatory cells involved include neutrophil granulocytes and macrophages, two types of white blood cell. Those who smoke additionally have Tc1 lymphocyte involvement and some people with COPD have eosinophil involvement {{similar to that in}} asthma. Part of this cell response is brought on by inflammatory mediators such as chemotactic factors. Other processes involved with lung damage include oxidative stress produced by high concentrations of free radicals in tobacco smoke and released by inflammatory cells, and breakdown of the connective tissue of the lungs by proteases that are insufficiently inhibited by protease inhibitors. The destruction of the connective tissue of the lungs is what leads to emphysema, which then contributes to the poor airflow and, finally, poor absorption and release of respiratory gases. General muscle wasting that often occurs in COPD may be partly due to inflammatory mediators released by the lungs into the blood.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the two new cups, {{it is also possible}} to create custom cups. The disk can save up to a hundred tracks and up to three ghost racers per course. IGN singled out the track creator as the F-Zero X Expansion Kits strongest feature since it is virtually the same tool the designers of F-Zero X used for themselves to create the original circuits. The Car Editor offers a variety of options when creating a vehicle. Using a set of pre-existing parts, the player must balance their creations' settings and performance abilities before the machine is finished and named. The Track Editor is a detailed track creator that allows the player to design their own racing circuits. Using a cursor, the player can determine the basic layout of the track and <b>also</b> <b>add</b> points to it to create track elements such as curves and hills. Furthermore, numerous different properties like half pipes and cylinders, as well as numerous road surfaces, such as slip zones, can be added. The player can test the creation at any time and run practice laps.|$|E

5|$|Standard cards can be {{purchased}} at vending machines within all Metrorail stations, at Metro sales offices, selected retail stores, and online. The purchase price includes $2 for the card itself plus an initial fare value, which varies depending on where they are purchased: cards purchased at stations cost $10 ($2 for the card and $8 fare value), while those purchased online cost either $10 or $30 ($2 for the card and $8 or $28 fare value). The cards can be reloaded using farecard vending machines or using cash at fareboxes onboard buses. Until 2016, riders could <b>also</b> <b>add</b> value to their SmarTrip cards by trading in paper farecards (a used farecard up to $20, or an unused farecard of any value). There is a difference between SmarTrip and CharmCard on the maximum value that can be stored on the card. SmarTrip can store up to $300 in value, while CharmCard can store up to $200.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} hours of 13 May, the 10th Panzer Division slipped into {{position}} upstream to the north-east of Sedan, ready to strike at its designated crossing point near the town of Wadelincourt. Downstream, the 2nd Panzer Division moved into position to cross at Donchery. The 1st Panzer Division prepared to strike at the Gaulier bridgehead, in the centre of Sedan's tactical front. It was on the northern bend of the Sedan Meuse loop that the Luftwaffe was to make its maximum effort, between Gaulier and Wadelincourt. To supplement his air support, Guderian stripped most of his Panzer Divisions of their artillery, which he then positioned directly opposite Gaulier. However, the artillery regiments lacked ammunition. Sustained and damaging bombardment through shelling was impossible. The Luftwaffe {{was going to have to}} do most of the work. Guderian reported that his Corps had only 141 artillery pieces against the French 174. To the north and south of Sedan, the French X Corps and French XXXXI Corps (at the artillery fortress at Charleville-Mézières) could <b>also</b> <b>add</b> their artillery and shell Guderian's Panzer units as they crossed the bridgeheads. The slow advance of artillery units to the front added to the German numerical inferiority, which was now 1:3 against. Only in the afternoon did the German artillery make an appearance, but with little effect. The 2nd Panzer Division was forced to attack without artillery support. For these reasons, Guderian had decided the outcome depended on the quality of air support, acting as flying artillery.|$|E
5|$|The rebels quickly {{extended}} their {{control over the}} neighbouring towns of Venosa, Ascoli, and Lavello. Dokeianos, who had just reimposed order in Bari and the surrounding region, marched to meet them with a hastily assembled and incomplete force: most of the imperial army was still in Sicily, so that Skylitzes writes that Dokeianos only took the Opsician {{and part of the}} Thracesian contingents with him, while other sources <b>also</b> <b>add</b> that his army comprised elements of the Varangian Guard. The two armies met at the Olivento river, where Dokeianos was defeated in a battle fought on 17 March. The rebels then moved south towards the coast, and on 4 May defeated another Byzantine force under Dokeianos in another battle near Cannae, a field that had served as the site for the famous battle of 216 BC and the first Norman engagement in southern Italy in 1018. The Annales Barenses claims, with obvious exaggeration, that 2,000 Normans defeated 18,000 Byzantines, but whatever the true numbers it does appear that the Byzantines considerably outnumbered the rebel forces. Dokeianos himself fell from his horse during the battle and was almost captured, until rescued by a squire. In the aftermath of the battle, both sides remained quiescent. The Lombards and Normans were probably exhausted and may have suffered heavy casualties, while the Byzantines regrouped: Dokeianos was recalled and replaced by Exaugustus Boioannes, while the garrisons in Sicily were withdrawn to the Italian mainland to face the rebel threat.|$|E
