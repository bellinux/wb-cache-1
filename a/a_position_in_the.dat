40|$|This paper studies how options trading, by {{circumventing}} {{constraints on}} borrowing, permits optimistic investors {{to hold the}} desired portfolio.

We show that aggregate demand for the stock is what prevails when options do not exist and no constraints hold. Furthermore, the option listing causes an increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> aggregate demand for the stock and consequently an increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> equilibrium stock price. ...|$|R
