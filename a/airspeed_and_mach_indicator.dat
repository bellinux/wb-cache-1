The stall was precipitated by the flightcrew's improper reaction to erroneous <b>airspeed</b> <b>and</b> <b>Mach</b> indications which had resulted from a blockage of the pitot heads by atmospheric icing.|$|R

After the publication, data for additional 67 hours became available. All the data were obtained at altitudes less than 20, 000 feet and under approximately the same conditions. The combined data have been analyzed to obtain the results given in the tables and figures contained herein. Based on the combined data, the probability of exceeding a given airspeed or Mach number is of the same order of magnitude as that given. The conclusions are, therefore, unchanged...|$|R
40|$|Including a gust {{analysis}} in an optimization framework is computationally inefficient as the critical load cases {{are not known}} a priori and hence {{a large number of}} points within the flight envelope have to be analyzed. Model order reduction techniques can provide significant improvement in computational efficiency of an aeroelastic analysis. In this paper a reduced order aeroelastic model is formulated by reducing the aerodynamic system with a balanced proper orthogonal decomposition and coupling it to a structural solver. It is demonstrated that the dominant modes of the aerodynamic model can be assumed to be constant for varying equivalent <b>airspeed</b> <b>and</b> <b>Mach</b> number, enabling the use of a single reduced model for the entire flight envelope. Comparison of the results from the full and reduced order aeroelastic model shows a high accuracy of the latter and a large saving in computational cost. A dynamic aeroelastic optimization framework is then formulated using the reduced order aeroelastic model. Results show that both dynamic and static loads play a role in optimization of the wing structure. Furthermore, the worst case gust loads change during the optimization process and hence it is important to identify the critical loads at every iteration in the optimization.

40|$|A {{computational}} {{methodology for}} an experimental design problem {{based on the}} concept of potential and repulsive fields is presented. The problem consists of finding the optimal distribution of test points in a two-dimensional domain, pursuant to hard constraints (permitted boundaries of the domain) and soft constraints (minimization of potential). Each test point is assumed to be the source of different fields which expose all other points to repulsive forces, thus accelerations, acting in different directions. The result of the mutual repulsive forces is a dynamic evolution of the configuration of test points in the domain, which eventually converges to a condition of minimum potential, where forces are balanced. An iterative process is adopted to find a numerical solution where residual accelerations are below a desired threshold. When a change of the number of test points (either an increment or reduction) is needed, the method has been extended to the additional task of dynamically relocating the remaining test points, after an initial subset has been performed. The proposed technique allows for an easy accomplishment of the task with minor modifications to the algorithm. The idea has been tested against a practical case: the definition of a flight test matrix for the evaluation of the aero-elastic and environmental characteristics of an aircraft. The goal is to distribute flight test points in the flight envelope in such a way to satisfy the requirements of structural engineers, interested in an optimal distribution in terms of <b>airspeed</b> <b>and</b> <b>Mach,</b> <b>and</b> systems engineers, more interested in the altitude <b>and</b> <b>airspeed</b> distribution. The method provides to combine all objectives in a single test campaign through an optimization of the test point distribution, in line with classical facility location problems. A large degree of flexibility in the algorithm is allowed to tune the relative weights assigned to the different requirements. The presented method shows effective and computationally efficiency, exhibiting satisfactory results in both the test matrix design task and the dynamic relocation task...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{miniature}} air data {{system is}} designed based on thermally excited resonant silicon micro structural pressure sensor. The system employs thermally excited resonant silicon micro structural pressure sensor for the pressure measurement. Using miniature embedded computer, calculation of the parameters such as height, <b>airspeed</b> <b>and</b> <b>mach</b> number <b>and</b> real-time display by LCD are realized. The volume and weight of this system is only one-twelfth of the original. In addition, it has the characteristics of high accuracy, high resolution, high stability and repeatability. I．Instruction In the modern aircraft, {{air data system}} is used to measure flight parameters such as flight altitude, <b>airspeed</b> <b>and</b> M number. At present, air data computer often adopts vibrating cylinder pressure sensor to measure pressure. Due to measure two atmospheric parameters: total pressure and static pressure, internal configuration of air data computer is two vibrating cylinder pressure sensors. Therefore, volume and weight of air data computer depends on two vibrating cylinder pressure sensors. Bigger the volume is, greater the weight is. Such {{as a type of}} air data computer, length X width X high is 314 × 240 × 210 mm. Weight of air data computer (excluding shock absorber) is about 11 kg. However, if air data system adopts micro silicon resonant pressure sensor, the volume and the weight will be only 1 / 12 of the one of vibration cylinder pressure sensor and performance will be considerable. If electronic circuit and resonant pressure sensor is integrated, it will become the prototype of miniature air data computer. At the same time, development of airborne distributed air data computer become possible...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is the evaluation of a relatively simple minimum induced loss propeller design and a radially-graded momentum theory analysis method to provide the initial propeller design and analysis capability for predicting propeller performance of a High Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) flight vehicle. These design and analysis capabilities cover flight conditions from take off at sea level to the low air density, high true <b>airspeeds</b> <b>and</b> high blade <b>Mach</b> numbers of high altitude flight. A conceptual propeller was designed and its performance analysed within a time-stepped mission simulation code. Wind tunnel tests were carried out on a scaled model of the propeller comparing actual performance against theoretical predictions. The design method was shown to be capable of producing a propeller design that could provide sufficient thrust over a large range of advance ratios (0. 12 to 0. 4) and altitudes (0 to 15 000 m). Agreement between the predicted and measured results is particularly good at the lower thrust coefficients and advance ratios, at higher power coefficients and advance ratios increasing differences between the predicted and measured results became apparent...|$|R

5000|$|As an {{airplane}} approaches its coffin corner, the margin between stall speed <b>and</b> critical <b>Mach</b> number becomes smaller and smaller.
