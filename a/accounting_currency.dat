5|$|The name euro {{was officially}} adopted on 16 December 1995 in Madrid. The euro was {{introduced}} to world financial markets as an <b>accounting</b> <b>currency</b> on 1 January 1999, replacing the former European Currency Unit (ECU) {{at a ratio of}} 1:1 (US$1.1743). Physical euro coins and banknotes entered into circulation on 1 January 2002, making it the day-to-day operating currency of its original members, and by May 2002 had completely replaced the former currencies. While the euro dropped subsequently to US$0.8252 within two years (26 October 2000), it has traded above the U.S. dollar since the end of 2002, peaking at US$1.6038 on 18 July 2008. Since late 2009, the euro has been immersed in the European sovereign-debt crisis which has {{led to the creation of}} the European Financial Stability Facility as well as other reforms aimed at stabilising the currency. In July 2012, the euro fell below US$1.21 for the first time in two years, following concerns raised over Greek debt and Spain's troubled banking sector. As of October 2017, the euro–dollar exchange rate stands at ~US$1.18.|$|E

The widespread currency floats and devaluations set back aspirations for European monetary union. However, in March 1979 the European Monetary System (EMS) was created, fixing exchange rates onto the European Currency Unit (ECU), an <b>accounting</b> <b>currency,</b> to stabilise exchange rates and counter inflation.

Under current arrangements, the Minister retains a good deal of discretionary authority with respect to banking supervision, but this situation is likely to be modified if a draft bill, now under discussion, becomes law.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} ability of {{portfolio}} and foreign direct investment flows to track movements in the euro and the yen against the dollar. Net portfolio flows from the euro area into U. S. stocks—possibly reflecting differences in expected productivity growth—track movements in the euro against the dollar closely. Net FDI flows, which capture the recent burst in cross-border M&A activity, appear less important in tracking movements in the euro-dollar rate, possibly because many M&A transactions consist of share swaps. Movements in the yen versus the dollar remain more closely tied to such conventional variables as the current account and interest differential.

This paper develops a simple two-region open economy macroeconomic model to analyze the alternative impacts of currency appreciation and fiscal adjustment on the current account. We stress a number of structural features of emerging Asian economies that may make currency appreciation an ineffective means of current account adjustment relative to fiscal policy changes.
