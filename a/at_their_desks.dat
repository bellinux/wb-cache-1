25|$|McCarl {{struggled}} to make GAO a competent and authoritative agency. In the first six years in office, he strictly controlled work start and stopping times, banned employees from discussing anything which was not work-related, and required employees to stay <b>at</b> <b>their</b> <b>desks.</b> He relaxed these rules significantly in 1927 after realizing they were harming staff morale.|$|E
25|$|Afternoon {{television}} news bulletins during {{the mid to}} late 1970s were broadcast from the BBC newsroom itself, rather than one of the three news studios. The newsreader would present to camera while {{sitting on the edge of}} a desk; behind him staff would be seen working busily <b>at</b> <b>their</b> <b>desks.</b> This period corresponded with when the Nine O'Clock News got its next makeover, and would use a CSO background of the newsroom from that very same camera each weekday evening.|$|E

25|$|Stoneman and his protégé Silas Lynch, a mulatto exhibiting psychopathic tendencies, head to South Carolina {{to observe}} the {{implementation}} of Reconstruction policies firsthand. During the election, in which Lynch is elected lieutenant governor, blacks are observed stuffing the ballot boxes, while many Whites are denied the vote. The newly elected, mostly black members of the South Carolina legislature are shown <b>at</b> <b>their</b> <b>desks</b> displaying inappropriate behavior, such as one member taking off his shoe and putting his feet up on his desk, and others drinking liquor and feasting on stereotypically African American fare such as fried chicken.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Z. Marcas nonetheless represents a fiery drive {{to succeed in}} the world of politics, an acute mind seeking to do good in the public sphere. One critic calls him [...] "ambition in its pure state". Like other persons of genius in La Comédie humaine, Marcas is seen as a reflection of Balzac's own ego and desire. Like Marcas, the author dreamed of fame and positive influence; as Balzac believed himself to be, the character is dismissed and manipulated by mediocre minds. Even their work habits– toiling <b>at</b> <b>their</b> <b>desks</b> throughout the night– are similar.|$|E
500|$|Like {{the rest}} of the series, the scenes for the first-season episodes were shot on-location in Baltimore. The use of {{hand-held}} cameras allowed the film to be shot more easily in the city, rather than on a sound-stage in Los Angeles or New York City, where most shows are typically shot. Levinson said being on location at all times allowed Baltimore [...] "to be a character in the show". The Recreation Pier Building, a Fells Point structure built in 1914 which once housed Baltimore's marine police, was used as the set of the police department station, which was the principal set for the show. The building looked so realistic that Baltimore residents would occasionally wander into it to report actual crimes. Production director Vincent Peranino created the squad room set inside the Recreation Pier Building. While most sets include a few fake walls opposite an open space for the cameras and crew, Peranino designed the entire room {{as if it were a}} real setting, including separate areas for the detectives' coffee room and the interrogation room known as [...] "The Box". The actors began storing their actual belongings <b>at</b> <b>their</b> <b>desks</b> on the set, left real personal messages to each other on the bulletin boards, and got business cards with their characters' actual names for their desks.|$|E

Rather than picking up a newspaper, or watching the 10 o'clock news, people can log onto the internet to get the news they want, when they want it.

500|$|Wiene {{asked the}} actors to make {{movements}} similar to dance, most prominently from Veidt, {{but also from}} Krauss, Dagover and Friedrich Feger, who played Francis. Krauss and Veidt are the only actors whose performances fully match the stylization of the sets, which they achieved by concentrating their movements and facial expressions. Barlow notes that [...] "Veidt moves along the wall {{as if it had}} 'exuded' him ... more a part of a material world of objects than a human one", and Krauss [...] "moves with angular viciousness, his gestures seem broken or cracked by the obsessive force within him, a force that seems to emerge from a constant toxic state, a twisted authoritarianism of no human scruple and total insensibility". Most of the other actors besides Krauss and Veidt have a more naturalistic style. Alan, Jane and Francis play the roles of an idyllically happy trio enjoying youth; Alan in particular represents the archetype of a sensitive 19th century student. Mike Budd points out realist characters in stylized settings are a common characteristic in Expressionist theatre. However, David Robinson notes even the performances of the more naturalistic supporting roles in Caligari have Expressionist elements, like Hans-Heinz von Twardowski's [...] "strange, tormented face" [...] as Alan. He also cites Feher's [...] "large angular movements," [...] especially in the scene where he searches the deserted fairground. Other minor roles are Expressionistic in nature, like two policemen who sit facing each other <b>at</b> <b>their</b> <b>desks</b> and move with exaggerated symmetry, and two servants who awaken and rise from their beds in perfect synchronization. Vincent LoBrutto said of the acting in the film: ...|$|E
2500|$|Active {{strategic}} management required active information {{gathering and}} active problem solving. In {{the early days}} of Hewlett-Packard (HP), Dave Packard and Bill Hewlett devised an active management style that they called management by walking around (MBWA). Senior HP managers were seldom <b>at</b> <b>their</b> <b>desks.</b> They spent most of their days visiting employees, customers, and suppliers. This direct contact with key people provided them with a solid grounding from which viable strategies could be crafted. Management consultants Tom Peters and Robert H. Waterman had used the term in their 1982 book [...] Some Japanese managers employ a similar system, which originated at Honda, and is sometimes called the 3 G's (Genba, Genbutsu, and Genjitsu, which translate into [...] "actual place", [...] "actual thing", and [...] "actual situation").|$|E
2500|$|On the [...] {{morning of}} May 9, 1853, while Hannah Rosa and the {{children}} were assembled <b>at</b> <b>their</b> <b>desks,</b> two police officers stationed themselves at the front and back door of her house. [...] They informed Margaret and Hannah Rosa that teaching free black children was illegal under Virginia law, then took the two women and the twenty-five terrified children on foot to the mayor's office. This 1849 law, like similar ones throughout the South, was the result of Southern white panic following Nat Turner's Rebellion in 1831. Under this law, it was an 'unlawful assembly' [...] for black people to gather together to learn to read and write, punishable by whipping, and for any white person to instruct them, punishable by up to 100 dollars and six months in jail.|$|E
5000|$|Even if {{employers}} block both sites {{used for}} personal business (e.g., social-networking and web-based email sites) and sites configured as proxies, employees can circumvent the block entirely with devices with data plans such as smartphones. As well, if employers monitor employees' telephone use, whether by tracking numbers dialed and/or by tracking {{time spent on}} the phone, employees can simply use their personal phones to make calls, whether <b>at</b> <b>their</b> <b>desk</b> or (if individual offices are [...] "bugged") by slipping into an area not monitored.|$|R

40|$|Background: Prolonged, {{uninterrupted}} sitting time {{is associated}} with poor health outcomes. As most sitting time occurs at work, accurate, objective measurement of occupational sitting patterns is required to fully understand its effects on employee health. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine associations between desk-based sitting patterns, waist circumference (WC) and body mass index (BMI). Methods: Participants were full-time, office-based employees (N= 105; mean age 40. 9 ± 11. 5 years; BMI 26. 1 ± 3. 9, 65 % women). Sitting patterns (total desk-based sitting time and number of times employees got up from <b>their</b> <b>desk)</b> were assessed for five days using an objective measure of desk-based sitting, the sitting pad. WC, height and weight were measured, and BMI calculated (weight/height 2). Associations between sitting patterns, WC and BMI were tested using logistic regression models. Data were collected and analysed between 2011 / 12. Results: Those with high sitting time <b>at</b> <b>their</b> <b>desk</b> were 2. 7 times (95 % CI: 1. 3 to 6. 3) more likely to have WC ≥ 94 cm (men) or ≥ 80 cm (women), and 9. 0 times (95 % CI: 1. 9 to 41. 9) more likely to have BMI ≥ 30 than those with lower sitting time. There were no significant associations between the number of times employees got up from sitting <b>at</b> <b>their</b> <b>desk</b> and WC or BMI. Conclusion: High desk-based sitting time was associated with increased likelihood of weight related health outcomes whereas frequency of getting up from sitting at the desk was not. ...|$|R
2500|$|According to Sun Yat-sen's [...] "Three Stages of Revolution" [...] theory, the KMT was {{to rebuild}} China in three phases: {{the first stage}} was {{military}} unification, which was carried out with the Northern Expedition; the second was [...] "political tutelage" [...] which was a provisional government led by the KMT to educate people about their political and civil rights, and the third stage was constitutional government. By 1928, the Nationalists, having taken over power militarily and reunified China, started the second phase, promulgating a provisional constitution and beginning the period of so-called [...] "tutelage". The KMT was criticized as instituting totalitarianism, but claimed it was attempting to establish a modern democratic society. Among others, they created {{at that time the}} Academia Sinica, the Central Bank of China, and other agencies. In 1932, China sent a team {{for the first time to}} the Olympic Games. Historians, such as Edmund Fung, argue that establishing a democracy in China at that time was not possible. The nation was at war and divided between Communists and Nationalists. Corruption within the government and lack of direction also prevented any significant reform from taking place. Chiang realized the lack of real work being done within his administration and told the State Council: [...] "Our organization becomes worse and worse... many staff members just sit <b>at</b> <b>their</b> <b>desks</b> and gaze into space, others read newspapers and still others sleep." [...] The Nationalist government wrote a draft of the constitution on 5 May 1936. Mass killing under the nationalists were common with millions of people killed. Notable mass killings include deaths from forced army conscription and the White Terror.|$|E
