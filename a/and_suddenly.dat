5|$|After {{learning}} to speak English, the children– Ralph says just the surviving girl– {{explained that they}} came from a land where the sun never shone and the light was like twilight. William says the children called their home St Martin's Land; Ralph adds that everything there was green. According to William, the children were unable to account for their arrival in Woolpit; they had been herding their father's cattle when they heard a loud noise (according to William, the bells of Bury St Edmunds) <b>and</b> <b>suddenly</b> found themselves by the wolf pit where they were found. Ralph says that they had become lost when they followed the cattle into a cave and, after being guided {{by the sound of}} bells, eventually emerged into our land.|$|E

5|$|Albert and Victoria {{chose the}} names Louisa Caroline Alberta. She was baptized on 13 May 1848 in Buckingham Palace's private chapel by John Bird Sumner, the Archbishop of Canterbury. Though she was christened Louisa at the service, she was {{invariably}} known as Louise throughout her life. Her godparents were Duke Gustav of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (her paternal great-great-uncle, for whom Prince Albert stood proxy); the Duchess of Saxe-Meiningen (for whom her great-aunt Queen Adelaide stood proxy); and the Hereditary Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (her first cousin once-removed, {{for whom the}} Duchess of Cambridge stood proxy). During the ceremony, the Duchess of Gloucester, {{one of the few}} children of King George III who was still alive, forgot where she was, <b>and</b> <b>suddenly</b> got {{up in the middle of}} the service and knelt at the Queen's feet, much to the Queen's horror.|$|E
5|$|In Granny's Cafe, Sheriff Graham (Jamie Dornan) throws darts at {{a picture}} of a deer very accurately. Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) arrives but leaves {{immediately}} because she has not forgiven him for hiding his relationship with Regina (Lana Parrilla). Emma attempts to avoid conversation, but Graham is insistent on explaining to her he feels nothing for Regina. He kisses Emma <b>and</b> <b>suddenly</b> sees a vision of a wolf, only to have Emma push him away. Frustrated by Emma's lack of understanding, Graham later sleeps with Regina. During the night, he awakens abruptly from a dream of a deer and a wolf. When Graham tells Regina that the dream felt like a memory, Regina tries to convince him to stay, but Graham leaves. As Graham attempts to get to his car, the wolf from his visions appears next to him, startling him before it leaves. As he tries to find the wolf in the woods, he runs into Mr. Gold (Robert Carlyle). Graham tells him about the wolf, and Mr. Gold suggests to him that dreams are memories from another life.|$|E
5|$|In many of {{the legends}} of the Cascade Mountains, there are thunderbirds that live on them and Adams is no exception. This {{particular}} thunderbird was named Enumtla and he terrorized {{the inhabitants of the}} land. Speelyi, the Klickitat coyote god, came along one day and they implored him to do something. Speelyi transformed himself into a feather and waited. It did not take long for Enumtla to see the feather and investigate. Being suspicious, he thundered at the feather with no effect. He paused <b>and</b> <b>suddenly</b> the magic feather let loose a terrific volley of thunder and lightning and stunned Enumtla. Speelyi then managed to overpower Enumtla and decreed that the thunderbird could no longer terrify the people, could only thunder on hot days, and could not destroy with lightning.|$|E

5|$|Michael's {{hatred of}} Toby has been {{transferred}} to the new human resources representative, Holly Flax (Amy Ryan), and he and Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) plan to haze her. When she playfully affects disdain for Toby, Michael takes her seriously, <b>and</b> <b>suddenly</b> {{falls in love with}} her. Taking advice from Jim Halpert (John Krasinski), Michael succeeds in warming Holly up with small talk and jokes, and even tempers Toby's exit interview, which he had originally planned to be brutally insulting, because Holly attends. Dwight, however, continues the hazing, telling Holly that Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) is mentally challenged, and putting a raccoon in her car. When Michael catches Dwight trying to release a raccoon into Holly's car, he loudly proclaims his esteem for Holly. Holly gives special attention to Kevin throughout the episode due to her belief that he is mentally challenged, but Kevin believes her attention is a sexual interest in him.|$|E
5|$|The period {{immediately}} after half‑time saw few chances, but then, after just over an hour's play, Manchester City regained their stride <b>and</b> <b>suddenly</b> went two goals ahead. A throw-in to Revie led to interplay {{on the right}} wing involving Barnes, Dyson, and Johnstone, resulting in a through-ball which put Dyson clear of the defence to score. Two minutes later, Trautmann collected the ball {{at the end of}} a Birmingham attack and kicked the ball long to Dyson, over the heads of the retreating Birmingham players. Dyson flicked the ball on to Bobby Johnstone, who scored Manchester City's third, becoming the first player ever to score in consecutive Wembley finals in the process.|$|E
5|$|After {{numerous}} {{requests for}} design alterations from the Brazilian Navy were accommodated or rejected, a contract was signed for a ship with fourteen 12-inch guns on 3 June 1911 for £2,675,000, and Rio de Janeiros keel was laid {{for the fourth}} time on 14 September. It did not take long for the Brazilian government to reconsider their decision again; by mid-1912, battleships with 14-inch guns were under construction, <b>and</b> <b>suddenly</b> it seemed that Rio de Janeiro would be outclassed upon completion. Making matters worse, a European depression {{after the end of the}} Second Balkan War in August 1913 reduced Brazil's ability to obtain foreign loans. This coincided with a collapse in Brazil's coffee and rubber exports, the latter due to the loss of the Brazilian rubber monopoly to British plantations in the Far East. The price of coffee declined by 20 percent and Brazilian exports of it dropped 12.5 percent between 1912 and 1913; rubber saw a similar decline of 25 and 36.6 percent, respectively. The Brazilian Navy later claimed that selling Rio de Janeiro was a tactical decision, so they could have two divisions of battleships: two with 12-inch guns (the Minas Geraes class), and two with 15-inch guns.|$|E

The second woman yells at them to go away and the two men, inexplicably, get into a fight in the second woman's front yard. Later, two FBI agents who look and sound remarkably similar to Mulder and Scully visit the first woman, Betty Templeton (Kathy Griffin). Betty claims to have never seen the other woman before. The other woman then passes her by in a car and the two agents begin fighting each other, much like the missionaries. They are severely injured after the gruesome mauling. Both agents, who had worked together for seven years, said that they were possessed. Meanwhile, the other woman, Lulu Pfeiffer (also Kathy Griffin), applies for a job at Koko's Copies, but does not get it because she has had 17 jobs in 17 states {{in the past three years}} and moves around too much. She becomes aggravated <b>and</b> <b>suddenly,</b> all the copies become black. The other woman, Betty, goes to another job with the same name and same resume.|$|E
5|$|His seat on MGM's {{board would}} last {{less than a}} year. After the {{unexpected}} death of studio head Harry Cohn in late February 1958, Columbia's board of directors selected a committee to pursue hiring his replacement. In early April {{it was confirmed that}} Briskin {{was one of those who}} they were considering. In April 1958 Briskin resigned from MGM, in order to return to Columbia, this time as Vice President in Charge of West Coast Activities. In addition to his executive production roles, Briskin was also made one of 9 members of Fico's board of directors. Fico was a company formed with the express purpose of buying up shares of Columbia stock on the open market as a way to display confidence in the company. By the end of 1958, Briskin was Vice President and General Manager of the studio. In April 1959, Briskin announced an ambitious plan for Columbia, wherein they scheduled 99 films for release over an 18-month span, and studio head Abe Schneider (also Briskin's brother-in-law) tagged Briskin to head the program. Among the films scheduled for production during this span included Anatomy of a Murder, A Raisin in the Sun, <b>and</b> <b>Suddenly,</b> Last Summer. Also in 1959, Briskin made Glenn E. Miller Productions a Columbia affiliate, the new arm specializing film production for military and defense purposes. Something Briskin had experience in during World War II. In July, Briskin's brother, Irving, sold his independent television production company to Screen Gems, Columbia's wholly owned subsidiary. After the sale, he went back to work at Columbia, where he had been prior to forming his own company. Shortly after, Briskin, reunited with his brother, announced that he was re-integrating Screen Gems back into Columbia, and it would no longer operate as a separate entity. Under Briskin, in July 1959 production hit an all-time high at Columbia, with over $11.5 million in production at one time. In August, despite rising production costs, Briskin took the unprecedented step of lowering the fees Columbia charged independent producers under contract to the studio. In September 1959 it was announced that Briskin had been elected to Columbia's board of directors, a position he held until his death. At the same time as Briskin was being elected to Columbia's board, it was announced that his son, Jerry, would be joining him at Columbia, working in the Screen Gems division as the producer for the television series, Manhunt. In December, Briskin's contract with Columbia was up for renewal by their shareholders.|$|E
