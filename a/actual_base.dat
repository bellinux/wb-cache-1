5|$|DNA {{nanostructures}} must be rationally {{designed so}} that individual nucleic acid strands will assemble into the desired structures. This process usually begins with specification of a desired target structure or function. Then, the overall secondary structure of the target complex is determined, specifying the arrangement of nucleic acid strands within the structure, and which portions of those strands should be bound to each other. The last step is the primary structure design, which is the specification of the <b>actual</b> <b>base</b> sequences of each nucleic acid strand.|$|E

500|$|MPC {{additionally}} {{worked on}} the disappearing waterfall that serves as Jennifer's grave when she is killed {{at the beginning of}} the film. They transformed the mysterious waterfall into a whirlpool. [...] "We came up with an approach that we thought would work because we had a lot of confidence in our water sims", stated Nordby. [...] "The waterfall appears both as a day and night shot, so we had to integrate with the water. And the night shots play a pivotal role in the film, and we do a huge crane over." [...] They could not lock it to a pan or to a tilt and filming the shots was difficult due to the <b>actual</b> <b>base</b> of the waterfall being out of reach. Nordby said, [...] "I eventually lowered down a shot—a ton of reference of the area because I knew we'd have to do some digi-matte work to recreate the basin that the whirlpool ends up in." [...] They soon realized that there was an insufficient amount of churning and foam to read as real as the location. The CG Supervisor, Pete Dionne, presented a different idea. [...] "He grabbed chunks of that river and tialing it so that it had a nice stretch of birds' eye point of view of the water that existed on the location in the lighting situation we were trying to match", stated Nordby. [...] "And then he projected that onto a whirlpool of animated sprites and had similar enough texture to the actual water that existed there, but pulled control into lighting it and could add depth mainly to the center of it." [...] Dealing with [...] "very shallow" [...] water, the team had to take extra care when filming the scenes.|$|E

6000|$|... § 16. I {{have drawn}} the flakes in Fig. 36, for illustration's sake, under a caricatured form. Their real aspect will be {{understood}} in a moment by {{a glance at the}} opposite plate, +31+, which represents the central aiguille in the woodcut outline Fig. 35 (Aiguille Blaitière, called by Forbes Greppond), as seen from within about half a mile of its <b>actual</b> <b>base.</b> The white shell-like mass beneath it is a small glacier, which in its beautifully curved outline[63] appears to sympathize with the sweep of the rocks beneath, rising and breaking like a wave {{at the feet of the}} remarkable horn or spur which supports it on the right. The base of the aiguille itself is, as it were, washed by this glacier, or by the snow which covers it, till late in the season, as a cliff is by the sea; except that a narrow chasm, of some twenty or thirty feet in depth and two or three feet wide, usually separates the rock from the ice, which is melted away by the heat reflected from the southern face of the aiguille. The rock all along this base line is of the most magnificent compactness and hardness, and rings under the hammer like a bell; yet, when regarded from a little distance, it is seen to be distinctly inclined to separate into grand curved flakes or sheets, of which the dark edges are well marked in the plate. The pyramidal form of the aiguille, as seen from this point, is, however, entirely deceptive; the square rock which forms its apparent summit is not the real top, but much in advance of it, and the slope on the right against the sky is a perspective line; while, on the other hand, the precipice in light, above the three small horns at the narrowest part of the glacier, is considerably steeper than it appears to be, the cleavage of the flakes crossing it somewhat obliquely. But I show the aiguille from this spot that the reader may more distinctly note the fellowship between its curved precipice and the little dark horn or spur which bounds the glacier; a spur the more remarkable because there is just such another, jutting in like manner from the corresponding angle of the next aiguille (Charmoz), both of them looking like remnants or foundations of the vaster ancient pyramids, of which the greater part has been by ages carried away.|$|E

40|$|Compressed sensing theory {{suggests}} that successful inversion of {{an image of the}} physical world from its modal parameters can be achieved at measurement dimensions far lower than the image dimension, provided that the image is sparse in an a priori known basis. The assumed basis for sparsity typically corresponds to a gridding of the parameter space, e. g., an DFT grid in spectrum analysis. However, in reality no physical field is sparse in the DFT basis or in an a priori known basis. No matter how finely we grid the parameter space the sources may not lie {{in the center of the}} grid cells and there is always mismatch between the assumed and the <b>actual</b> <b>bases</b> for sparsity. In this paper, we study the sensitivity of compressed sensing (basis pursuit to be exact) to mismatch between the assumed and the <b>actual</b> sparsity <b>bases.</b> Our mathematical analysis and numerical examples show that the performance of basis pursuit degrades considerably in the presence of basis mismatch.
