2500|$|In her {{autobiography}} Cross Creek {{first published}} in 1942, Rawlings described how she owned many acres of land and also hired many people to help her with day-to-day chores and activities. An entire chapter {{of the book is}} dedicated to one woman she hired, whose name was Beatrice, but whom she was affectionately known as [...] "GeeChee", because the woman was ethnically part of the GeeChee people. In the book Rawlings said GeeChee's mother lived in nearby Hawthorne, Florida and GeeChee was blind in one eye from a fight she was involved in. GeeChee was employed by Rawlings on and off for nearly two years in which GeeChee dutifully made life easier for Rawlings. GeeChee revealed to Rawlings that her boyfriend named Leroy was serving time in prison for manslaughter, and asked Rawlings for help in gaining his release. She arranged for Leroy to be paroled to her and come work for her estate, and had a wedding on the grounds for Beatrice and Leroy. After a few weeks, Leroy aggressively demanded for more earnings from Rawlings and threatened her. She decided he had to leave, which caused her distress because she did not want GeeChee to go with him, and was sure she would. GeeChee eventually decided to stay with Rawlings, but GeeChee began to drink heavily and abandoned her. Weeks later, Rawlings went out searching for GeeChee and drove her back to her estate, describing GeeChee as a [...] "Black Florence Nightingale". GeeChee was unable to stop herself from drinking, which led a heartbroken Rawlings to dismiss her. Rawlings stated in her autobiography [...] "No maid of perfection--and now I have one--can fill the strange emptiness she left in a remote corner of my heart. I think of her often, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>she</b> does of me, for she comes once a year to see me".|$|E
60|$|THE PRINCESS. Oh, {{something}} she did. I am {{sure she had}} never done it before; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>she</b> would never have done it again, she was so truly contrite and nice about it.|$|E
6000|$|<b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>she</b> will {{shine on}} a lady of witchcraft, [...] Gladness and grief to see, [...] Who has taken my heart with her nimble fingers, [...] Calls {{in my dreams}} to me: ...|$|E
60|$|And Charmian {{looked at}} me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> {{wondered}} where <b>I</b> had got it.|$|R
60|$|Then I saw {{his wife}} signing to him, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> {{wanted to be}} left alone with me.|$|R
60|$|We quarrelled about Havanas--we fought o'er a good cheroot, <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> is exacting, <b>and</b> {{she says}} <b>I</b> am a brute.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course she}} is!" [...] said Charmian. [...] "Everybody works too {{hard at the}} Synthesis. It's {{the ideal of the}} place. We woke her out of a nap, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>she</b> was tired to death." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "On the avenue, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>she</b> {{lives in}} the {{neighborhood}} somewhere, because she was shopping here on the avenue, and I could have easily followed her home {{if she had not}} taken the Elevated for down town." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was Aunt Josephine," [...] said Diana, gasping with laughter. [...] "Oh, Anne, it was Aunt Josephine, however {{she came}} to be there. Oh, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>she</b> will be furious. It's dreadful--it's really dreadful--but did you ever know {{anything}} so funny, Anne?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Exactly. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>she's</b> of New England ancestry, {{she told}} me so. What I can't make out is, why she joined the I.W.W. That seems so contradictory." ...|$|R
60|$|I saw my mother's lips move, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> was murmuring {{a thanksgiving}} {{to the power}} which had {{preserved}} her husband and son through the late struggle.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's so VERY dark," [...] <b>she</b> answered, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> {{had taken}} it. [...] "I can hardly see a step, and poor Mr. March with his glasses--I don't know what he'll do." ...|$|R
60|$|GERALD. My {{mother is}} awfully conscientious, Lord Illingworth, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>she</b> doesn't think I am educated {{enough to be}} your secretary. She is {{perfectly}} right, too. I was fearfully idle when I was at school, and I couldn't pass an examination now to save my life.|$|E
6000|$|... "My mother {{ought to}} have known my father better," [...] she {{declared}} sullenly. [...] "I must not criticize her judgment, for her memory is my most precious possession <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>she</b> loved me devotedly. But {{there is one thing}} in her history I can never understand." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No; no one!" [...] she exclaimed, {{accepting}} the platitude {{as if it}} were now uttered for the first time. She dried her eyes and smiled. [...] "I will tell Mrs. Bowen how you feel and what you've said, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>she</b> will appreciate your generosity." ...|$|E
6000|$|For a second, perhaps, {{we faced}} {{one another in}} stark understanding. [...] . Then she plumped back to the chest of drawers, and her wet pocket-handkerchief, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> sought refuge from my {{relentless}} eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{told her}} what <b>I</b> had seen, <b>and</b> while <b>I</b> spoke {{she put on her}} bonnet, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> exulted, thinking--and then she took off her bonnet, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> would not go away with me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yea, yea," [...] <b>she</b> said (<b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> {{was nodding}} her head sagaciously); I {{looked out at}} the room window, but all I could see was a man {{wheeling}} an empty barrow down the brae.|$|R
6000|$|The girl hesitated. [...] "I don't think I {{ought to}} tell you all she said and did. It was really a private {{interview}} between us two, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>she</b> would not {{want me to say}} much about it. And I don't think you would want to hear everything." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Never!' {{said the}} girl passionately. 'I shall never do that. Nobody knows that better than Miss Wade, though she taunts me because she has made me her dependent. And I know I am so; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>she</b> is overjoyed when she can bring it to my mind.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{let her go}} on the bond," [...] he said at last; [...] "it's splendid of her, but if {{she does}} {{that she will be}} kept here, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>she</b> is crazy to get away, and we must not let her any deeper into this muss of mine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{there is}} anybody that thinks {{now that the}} oil-belt don't extend up this way, I should like to have them come up and take a squint at 'The Harnett.' She's {{spouting}} like a daisy, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> would, from the first," [...] said Bob, as he came in to breakfast next morning, after having worked all night, his joy so great {{that he did not}} even feel the fatigue.|$|R
40|$|<b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> loved Melissa in {{the second}} grade because she was always so serious, her gray eyes locked on {{whatever}} {{she was looking at}} like {{it was the only thing}} in the world. One day, her eyes locked on me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> wasn 2 ̆ 7 t ever going to let me go. I didn 2 ̆ 7 t want her to. Me and Melissa, we were always going to be something...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't {{write to}} her while I'm at home, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>she's</b> {{in the next}} room to me. I will send her a letter when I'm out of the house, saying it's only for a little time, and that I'm coming back when the angry part of this infernal {{business}} is all blown over." [...] Such was his resolution, as he tore up the crumpled paper, and went out quickly into the passage.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am doing}} it entirely on Mrs. Deering's I account," [...] said my wife that evening after tea, {{as we walked}} down the side-street that descended from our place to Broadway. [...] "She has that girl on her hands, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>she</b> must be at her wits' end." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Some {{people would}} fancy so," [...] said his companion, [...] "Lily {{will have a}} good deal of money, by and by, and she is very young. Atterly has nothing but an {{unprofitable}} farm; but he is an honest lad, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>she</b> is very fond of him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed, indeed I have not," [...] {{repeated}} Margaret, {{struggling to}} retain the unbidden tear which seemed ready to burst out on the slightest occasion. [...] "Do but say to the lady that your brother's god-daughter desires earnestly to speak to her, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>she</b> will not refuse to see me." ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{reflection}} on competing at Rio 2016, Patterson says [...] "If {{someone told me}} one year ago {{that this is where}} I'd be I would have said, 'no, this is a joke.'" [...] But after winning her first gold medal against Jessica Long, she states [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> had to attack and go out hard and keep fighting for it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> was right behind me, so I just had to keep going forward." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A queer sentence, was it not, Yorke? <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew,</b> as <b>she</b> uttered it, it {{was true}} as queer. Her words were a mirror in which I saw myself.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{even in that}} case, I don't see why {{you should}} mind it. It was {{certainly}} very friendly of her, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that <b>she</b> has your interest at heart entirely." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am sure we don't like Jonas {{any more}} than you do, Vincent; but you see mamma has to depend upon him so much. No, I don't think she can like it; but you can't have {{everything}} you like in a man, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>she</b> thinks he is a very good overseer. I suppose she could get another?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Because true mothers {{never forget}} their children; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>she</b> was one, {{from the fact}} that she ran away from the cruel husband, to save her little son from bad influences. Had she lived, life would have been happier for you, with this tender friend to help and comfort you. Never forget that she risked {{everything}} for your sake, and don't let it be in vain.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your {{request is}} granted," [...] she said. [...] "If you can induce the Princess to swallow this pill her evil temper will disappear, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>she</b> will love you dearly for having cured her. Take great care of it, for {{if it should}} be lost I can not give you another. Do you wish me to grant any other request before you return to the court?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I liked it, Mr. Paret," [...] <b>she</b> replied simply, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>she</b> had understated. It {{was quite}} {{apparent}} that Krebs had captivated her. I {{tried not to}} betray my annoyance.|$|R
6000|$|... "I never asked. <b>I</b> hate gossiping, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> make a rule {{to inquire}} into no secrets but such as are voluntarily confided to me; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that <b>she</b> has never told Sabina." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The thing was, you see, she {{happened}} to trickle in rather quietly when I happened {{to be looking at}} something, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> didn't <b>know</b> <b>she</b> was there till she suddenly grabbed it..." ...|$|R
