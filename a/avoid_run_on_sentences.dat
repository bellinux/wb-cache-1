The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to explore the grammatical errors made by the students of SMKN 2 Tegallalang in practicing their English. The theory applied for this paper is Error Analysis, Perspectives on Second Language Acquisition (1974) edited by Jack C. Richards. The data of the analysis of this paper are taken from the compositions by the students of SMKN 2 Tegallalang. Then the errors were collected and classified based on the types of errors according to the theory applied. The finding shows that they made some errors when they made a sentence. Actually they seem to be clever to use English in writing grammatically, however they are lack of knowledge as seen in the errors encountered in their statement. The error found can be classified into error of using singular-plural, error of using word form, error of using word choice, error of using verb tense, error of using add word, error of omit word, error of using word order, error of spelling, error of using punctuation, error of using article, error of meaning not clear, error of <b>run</b> <b>on</b> <b>sentence...</b>|$|R

The importance {{of this research is}} to make Korean pop community more aware of grammatical error. Moreover, this research is trying to identify the types of error that made by Korean pop communities in Twitter. This research was conducted using qualitative research design. The data was obtained from tweets of 5 Korean pop communities in Twitter from January until May. The instrument that researcher used was document analysis. Furthermore, the study was done by several steps such as searching some tweets of Korean pop communities that have grammatical error, screenshoting tweets that contains grammatical error, and marking the tweets that contains grammatical error. After that, the tweets were analyzed and classified using types of error and validating based on the AzarÂ’s book. Based on the result of the study, the researcher found total 58 types of error in the tweets made by Korean pop communities in Twitter. The types of error found in their tweets are 5 errors in singular-plural, 4 errors in word choice, 3 errors in verb tense, 2 errors in omit a word, 4 errors in add a word, 4 errors in incomplete sentence, 5 errors in spelling, 15 errors in punctuation, 5 errors in capitalization, 3 errors in unclear meaning, 4 errors in <b>run</b> <b>on</b> <b>sentence,</b> and 4 errors in possessive noun...|$|R

[...] Also, in regard to the episode's ending with the reveal of Pierce's death, Goldman said [...] "The news of Pierce’s death in the midst of all this was certainly a shock and a bit of a jolt to the system, given the episode was in such a specific zone up until then.

English Education Program. State Islamic Institute (IAIN) of Tulungagung. Advisor: Dr. Nurul Chojimah, M. Pd. Key words : Sentence {{structure}} error, Writing, Descriptive text Sentence {{structure is}} one of aspect {{that should be considered}} by students in writing. In real practice of writing, sentence structure hold important role in arranging a group of word. It will make a group of word more meaningful, which i s expressing a complete thought. However, some students may get difficulties in constructing correct sentence structure. As the result, they will commit error. Error in sentence structure can be identified and analyzed to give some contribution in attempti ng to decrease errors made by the students in writing. The formulation of the research problems in this research were: (1) what types of sentence structure errors are made by the first grade students of MAN Rejotangan in writing descriptive text? (2) what is the most dominant sentence structure error made by the first grade students of MAN Rejotangan in writing descriptive text? The objective of this research were: (1) to know the types of sentence structure errors are made by the first grade students of M AN Rejotangan in writing descriptive text (2) to know the most dominant sentence structure error made by the first grade students of MAN Rejotangan in writing descriptive text. This research is descriptive design with quantitative approach. The population of this research was all the first grade students of MAN Rejotangan in academic year 2014 / 2015. The sample of this research was X IPA 4 class which consists of 32 students. The instrument used in this research was writing test. The data analysis was using identifying and classifying the sentence structure errors into <b>sentence</b> fragment, <b>run</b> - <b>on</b> <b>sentences</b> and comma splice, choppy sentence, and stringy sentence. The result of this study shows that: (1) the types of sentence structure errors in descriptive text made by the first grade students on MAN Rejotangan in academic year 2014 / 2015 were <b>sentence</b> fragments, <b>run</b> - <b>on</b> <b>sentences</b> and comma splices, choppy sentences and stringy sentences (2) the students made the total 264 errors in their writing. In term of each error, sentence fragments appeared 182 times, <b>run</b> - <b>on</b> <b>sentences</b> and comma splice 69 times, choppy sentences 11 times, and stringy sentences 2 times. Therefore, it can be concluded that the most dominant errors made by students was <b>sentence</b> fragments. Based <b>on</b> the finding of the research, it is suggested that (1) English teacher should pay attention to the sentence structure errors that often made by students in composing writing. After knowing the students’ errors, the teacher have to give explanation and fe edback for their students related to the errors. (2) The student as learner should learn from their error and not to do the same again, and, if necessary they can look for information from teacher or reviewing related book. This research concern only analy zing sentence structure error in students’ descriptive text. So, other researchers are suggested to analyze other aspects in writing composition...|$|R
40|$|IN THIS PAPER, I {{attempt to}} add a few {{thoughts}} on the macroeconomic {{context in which the}} firm- and institution-level changes are taking place, with an emphasis on emerging markets. Financial Integration and Regulation The major presence of international firms in financial markets has made an important contribution to stability in domestic banking systems in a number of emerging-market economies. Argentina is a case in point. More than half of Argentina’s banking system now comprises large international institutions. This helped to build confidence in the banking system, which in turn helped to <b>avoid</b> a <b>run</b> <b>on</b> bank deposits after the Russian and Brazil-ian crises comparable to that following Mexico’s 1995 crisis. In view of the critical role that weak domestic banking systems played in the East Asian crisis, Argentina’s experience suggests that increased openness in financial services can {{play a major role in}} stabilizing the domestic banking system...|$|R
40|$|April 2001 For {{more than}} 20 years, the United States has run current-account deficits {{with the rest}} of the world—and is now the world’s largest {{international}} debtor. Because the world is on a dollar standard, the United States is unique in having a virtually unlimited international line of credit which is largely denominated in its own currency, i. e., dollars. In contrast, foreign debtor countries must learn to live with currency mismatches where their banks’ and other corporate international liabilities are dollar denominated but their assets are denominated in the domestic currency. As these mismatches cumulate, any foreign country is ultimately forced to repay its debts in order to <b>avoid</b> a <b>run</b> <b>on</b> its currency. But however precarious and over-leveraged the financing of individual American borrowers—including American banks, which intermediate such borrowing internationally—might be, they are invulnerable to dollar devaluation. In effect, America’s collective current-account deficits are sustainable indefinitely. Working Papers Index...|$|R
40|$|Public {{intervention}} in the banking sector takes three main forms: prudential regulation, especially with the Basel II ratio for adequacy of a bank's own funds for their exposure to risk; insuring deposits, the goal {{of which is to}} ensure a minimum level of protection for depositors and savers in order to <b>avoid</b> a <b>run</b> <b>on</b> banks; and control and supervision of banks by public authorities, which ensures that the rules are applied properly. Intervention by central banks, through their monetary policy and as lenders of last resort, constitutes the fourth means of regulating the banking system, and the main form of {{intervention in}} financial markets. Central banks intervene in order to ensure the stability of financial systems. The financial crisis has shown that traditional modes of public {{intervention in the}} financial system are ineffective and insufficient. Before analyzing the principles and limits of these forms of public intervention, we examine cases of exceptional intervention and support to banks by public powers during the crisis. Then, in conclusion, we compare these forms of public intervention with the current state of financial systems...|$|R

Also, BNP Paribas {{did not have any}} plans to let go of employees of Fortis Bank. Also on this day, De Tijd reports that Fortis Bank has finally realized that there is the possibility that shareholders will vote against the sales and are drawing up a plan B over the weekend. This will be submitted for approval to the board by Tuesday February 10 or Wednesday February 11. The court decision of December 12 has ordered BNP Paribas to supply credit to Fortis Bank up to February 16. If the shareholders in their February 11 meeting disapprove of the sales, BNP Paribas could withdraw from the sale and an alternate way of supplying credit would be required. There is a daily need for some €30 to 40 billion credit, with the Belgian state, {{in the case of an}} emergency, able to provide up to €150 billion. Also there is the matter of assuring the clients of Fortis Bank of the continuity of the company, so as to <b>avoid</b> a <b>run</b> <b>on</b> the bank. De Standaard counters this: there is no special activity at Fortis Bank this weekend, work on the plan B started weeks ago. Also there is no need for liquidity support: BNP Paribas still is ready to provide support, but at the moment it is not needed. Furthermore, it was announced that the Dutch-language court action (announced on January 20) has been started; the initial court-session is scheduled for February 20.|$|R
