5|$|A {{habitat is}} an {{ecological}} or environmental <b>area</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> inhabited {{by a particular}} species of animal, plant, or other type of organism. The term typically refers to the zone in which the organism lives and where it can find food, shelter, protection and mates for reproduction. It is the natural environment in which an organism lives, or the physical environment that surrounds a species population.|$|E
5|$|A male {{sea otter}} {{is most likely}} to mate if he {{maintains}} a breeding territory in an <b>area</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> also favored by females. As autumn is the peak breeding season in most areas, males typically defend their territory only from spring to autumn. During this time, males patrol the boundaries of their territories to exclude other males, although actual fighting is rare. Adult females move freely between male territories, where they outnumber adult males by an average of five to one. Males that do not have territories tend to congregate in large, male-only groups, and swim through female areas when searching for a mate.|$|E
40|$|Motivation: Association {{analysis}} is {{the method of}} choice for studying complex multifactorial diseases. The premise of this method <b>is</b> <b>that</b> affected persons contain some common genomic regions with similar SNP alleles and such areas will be found in this analysis.

Clearly, <b>areas</b> <b>that</b> can <b>be</b> marked with higher probability as IBD and have the same correlation with the disease status of identical <b>areas</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> more probably only IBS, are better candidates to be causative, and yet this distinction is not encoded in standard association analysis...|$|R

5|$|Buford {{appears in}} {{historical}} records {{beginning in the}} early 19th century. The <b>area</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> now Buford was originally part of Cherokee territory. Despite the treaty in 1817 that ceded the territory to the United States and Gwinnett County's legislative establishment in 1818, the area was still largely inhabited by the Cherokee until the 1830s. The first non-Native Americans moved to the Buford area in the late 1820s or early 1830s, although the Buford area was not largely settled by them until the 1860s.|$|E
5|$|By 1704, the <b>area</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> today Elmsford {{was known}} as Storm's Bridge, after Abraham Storm, who {{established}} a tavern at the junction of the Saw Mill River and Tarrytown roads (today routes 9A and 119) that {{is the center of}} that village today. In 1719, one of the Philipse tenant farmers, William Hammond, built his house on land he leased in what is today Eastview, where his house still stands. Along the river to the north, his brother Staats Hammond built two mills along the river; the small settlement of Hammond's Mill became today's Hawthorne.|$|E

5|$|Many equestrians were publicans, {{in charge}} of tax-collecting in Asia (Asia in Roman times meant {{essentially}} the Roman-dominated <b>area</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> now referred to as western Anatolia), and of contracting for construction projects. The equestrian class would get to control a court that tried senators for misconduct in provincial administration. In effect, the equestrians replaced senators already serving at the court. Thus, Gaius became an opponent of senatorial influence. Other reforms implemented by Gaius included fixing prices on grain for the urban population and granting improvements in citizenship for Latins and others outside the city of Rome.|$|E

Those who settled in Kuching did so near the Sarawak River in an <b>area</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> now referred to as Chinatown. Immigrants from Fujian, led by Wong Nai Siong in 1901, settled along the Rajang River {{in what is now}} Sibu, while those who arrived in Miri sought work in the coal mines and oilfields.|$|E

In formerly strip-mined areas there are patches of grassland and reforestation. Almost all of the <b>area</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> considered impaired by the Environmental Protection Agency, is forested. However, in areas where strip mining was done in the past, there are patches of grassland or reforested land. This land includes sports camps and summer retreats.|$|E
