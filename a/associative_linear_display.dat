40|$|Reflectometric {{interference}} spectroscopic {{measurements were}} performed on molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) films with the herbicide atrazine as the template molecule. A conventional imprinting protocol was used relying on non-covalent interactions between the functional monomers and the template.

Reproducible results were obtained upon measurements of atrazine solutions in toluene with both films.

40|$|AbstractA finitely {{generated}} algebra A {{in a variety}} V is called finitely determined in V if there exists a finite V-consistent set of equalities and inequalities in an alphabet containing the generating set of A, which, together with the identities of V, yields all relations and non-relations of A. Obviously, if the equational theory of V is recursively enumerable then any finitely determined algebra in V has solvable word problem. The known algebraic characterizations of groups and semigroups with solvable word problem imply that in the varieties of all groups and all semigroups the members with solvable word problem are finitely determined. We construct a {{finitely generated}} center-by-metabelian group with solvable word problem, which is not finitely determined in every group variety V with ZA 2 ⊆V⊆A 3. We show that every extension of a finitely generated abelian group by a finite group from a variety W is finitely determined in every variety V⊇ZA 2 W. However, in any abelian-by-nilpotent variety no infinite group is finitely determined; moreover, in every variety, in which all finitely presented algebras are residually finite, each finitely determined algebra is finite. In the variety of all <b>associative</b> <b>linear</b> algebras over a finitely generated field every member with solvable word problem is finitely determined. We construct an example, which shows that for the variety of all associative rings it is not true; however, in this variety each torsion-free member with solvable word problem is finitely determined...|$|R

A method of presenting results {{in a way that is}} meaningful and useful to searchers is now emerging and beginning to show its impact on scholarly research.

Performance was equivalent regardless of the relative order of the target results and data in the laboratory report.

However NMT systems with deep architecture in their encoder or decoder RNNs often suffer from severe gradient diffusion {{due to the}} non-linear recurrent activations, which often make the optimization much more difficult. To address this problem we propose novel <b>linear</b> <b>associative</b> units (LAU) to reduce the gradient propagation length inside the recurrent unit. Different from conventional approaches (LSTM unit and GRU), LAUs utilizes <b>linear</b> <b>associative</b> connections between input and output of the recurrent unit, which allows unimpeded information flow through both space and time direction. The model is quite simple, but it is surprisingly effective.
