Zuckerberg writes: [...] "I read over all the stuff you sent and it seems like it shouldn't take too long to implement, so we can talk about that <b>after</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> all the basic functionality up tomorrow night." [...] The next day, on December 1, 2003, Zuckerberg sent another email to the HarvardConnection team. [...] "I put together one of the two registration pages so I have everything working on my system now. I'll keep you posted as I patch stuff up and it starts to become completely functional." [...] On December 4, 2003, Zuckerberg writes: [...] "Sorry I was unreachable tonight. I just got about three of your missed calls. I was working on a problem set." [...] On December 10, 2003: [...] "The week has been pretty busy thus far, so I haven't gotten a chance to do much work on the site or even think about it really, so I think it's probably best to postpone meeting until we have more to discuss. I'm also really busy tomorrow so I don't think I'd be able to meet then anyway." [...] A week later: [...] "Sorry I have not been reachable for the past few days. I've basically been in the lab the whole time working on a cs problem set which I'm still not finished with." [...] On December 17, 2003, Zuckerberg met with the Winklevosses and Narendra in his dorm room, allegedly confirming his interest and assuring them that the site was almost complete. On the whiteboard in his room, Zuckerberg allegedly had scrawled multiple lines of code under the heading “Harvard Connection,” however, this would be the only time they saw any of his work. On January 8, 2004, Zuckerberg emailed to say he was [...] "completely swamped with work [...] week" [...] but had [...] "made some of the changes ... and they seem to be working great" [...] on his computer. He said he could discuss the site starting the following Tuesday, on January 13, 2004. On January 11, 2004, Zuckerberg registered the domain name thefacebook.com. On January 12, 2004, Zuckerberg e-mailed Eduardo Saverin, saying that the Facebook site [...] was almost complete and that they should discuss marketing strategies. Two days later, on January 14, 2004, Zuckerberg met again with the HarvardConnection team; however, he allegedly failed to disclose registering the domain name thefacebook.com or developing a competing social networking website. Rather, he allegedly reported progress on HarvardConnection, told the team he would continue to work on it, and would email the group later in the week. On February 4, 2004, Zuckerberg launched thefacebook.com, a social network for Harvard students, designed to expand to other schools around the country.|$|E

25|$|It {{usually takes}} me an hour <b>after</b> <b>I</b> awaken to <b>get</b> {{all the pain}} out. It used to be easier when I was younger. I have more muscle and joint {{difficulties}} now...

That was very uncomfortable: But it was discomfort I was deliberately creating.|$|R
6000|$|Ethel {{smiled a}} quiet smile of resignation. [...] "They are rather trying, Cecil," [...] she said gently, [...] "especially {{on days when}} one has got a headache; but, after all, I'm very glad to have the work to do; it helps such a lot to eke out our little income. We have so very little, you know, even for two lonely women to live upon in simple little lodgings like these, that I'm thankful I can do {{something}} to help dear Aunt Emily, who's really goodness itself. You see, <b>after</b> all, <b>I</b> <b>get</b> very well paid indeed for the lessons." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When I {{see a new}} scholar {{enter this}} school and she does not happen [...] to suit me exactly in her ways and manners, I very often get [...] prejudiced against her, though {{sometimes}} I find her a valuable [...] friend, <b>after</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> acquainted with her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're not a farmer," [...] Daylight said. The {{young man}} laughed {{and shook his}} head. [...] "No; I'm a {{telegraph}} operator.

6000|$|... "I know that, Bill, an' I'm goin' {{to talk to}} Mr. Davis now. I {{was only}} sayin' I wouldn't do it if things wasn't the way they are.

40|$|In my Bachelor Thesis I {{focused on}} masks as an {{authentic}} imprint of human face. My {{intention was to}} verify the possibility of working with specific people in the broadest possible spectrum. My work has both artistic and psychological extent. I work with human identity and its forms within different social roles. This work is time consuming. I make plaster casts of faces of many dozen people. <b>After</b> removing, <b>I</b> <b>get</b> a form from which I cast the final form of masks. I work with a polyester resin that I mix with other materials. This gives me very different structures, colors {{and the appearance of}} masks. In this way I try to emphasize the differences of individual people. Every specimen is original, exceptional and inimitable...|$|R
