5|$|Ever {{since the}} victory against an Egyptian army at the Battle of Tel-el-Kebir, the {{standard}} British tactic against an entrenched position was an <b>approach</b> <b>march</b> {{at night in}} close order to maintain cohesion, followed by deployment into open order within {{a few hundred yards}} of the objective and a frontal attack with the bayonet at first light. Methuen planned to bombard the Boer positions with artillery from 16:50 to 18:30 on 10 December. Following the barrage, the newly arrived Highland Brigade under Major General Wauchope was to make a night march that would position them to launch a frontal attack on the Boers at dawn the following day. Wauchope had argued for a flanking attack along the Modder River, but had been unable to convince his superior.|$|E
5|$|The {{extensive}} and complex arrangements required {{to support the}} infantry attack from {{the west and the}} mounted attack from the east were completed by 30 October, when these attacking forces moved to positions within a day's march of their deployment. Three divisions of XX Corps were concentrated in position: the 53rd (Welsh) Division at Goz el Geleib, the 60th (London) Division at Esani and the 74th (Yeomanry) Division at Khasif. In preparation for their final <b>approach</b> <b>march,</b> the Civil Service Rifles and the Queen's Westminster Rifles (179th Brigade, 60th Division) were supplied with tea and rum for the following day. In their haversack rations were five onions, a tin of bully beef, a slice of cooked bacon, biscuits and dates.|$|E
5|$|As the division's assault units {{began their}} <b>approach</b> <b>march</b> towards {{the line of}} {{departure}} late {{on the evening of}} 6 June, the German artillery opened up with a gas bombardment that severely hindered the march, breaking up the assaulting units as men became lost. Suffering over 2,000 casualties before the battle even began, many of the division's assault units reached their assembly points with less than 200 men, nevertheless they arrived on time and at the appointed hour, after a number of mines were exploded in front of their positions, the assault began. The exploding mines had destroyed {{a large part of the}} German line and as a result initial resistance was quickly overcome by the division's lead battalions—the 33rd, 34th, 38th and 39th—and by 5am, the division had gained the crest of the Messines ridge and began digging in to defend against a possible counter-attack. In the engagements that followed the division largely played only a supporting role.|$|E

5|$|In June, {{during a}} brief period away from the line in billets, the battalion, {{along with the rest}} of the 1st Brigade, was {{reviewed}} by the Australian prime minister, Billy Hughes near Fleurbaix. Following this, although several units from I Anzac Corps took part in a number of raids against the German line during late June and early July, the 2nd Battalion was not involved and as such, apart from experiencing some enemy shelling, the 2nd Battalion's first significant action came at Pozières in July 1916. The battalion entered the line on the night of 19/20 July as the 1st was sent forward to relieve the British 68th Brigade along with the 3rd Brigade; just after midnight the 2nd Battalion, after an <b>approach</b> <b>march</b> over which they had endured gas attack, arrived at its position opposite the south-western side of the village.|$|E
5|$|During {{the day the}} Fusiliers again {{assaulted}} Hill 217 {{from the}} south, and attempted {{to work their way}} around the eastern and western flanks of the feature. Despite preparation by the divisional artillery and the 3 RAR Machine Gun Platoon firing their Vickers medium machine-guns in support from Maryang San, the Fusiliers were unable to make progress due to Chinese machine-guns located in bunkers {{at the top of their}} objective. Meanwhile, their flanking movements were also blocked by Chinese small arms and grenades. 1 RNF had now taken over 100 casualties during two days of fighting and by the afternoon they were a spent force. Sensing the Fusiliers' weakness, the Chinese then launched their own assault, forcing them to withdraw in contact. Previous plans for an assault on the Hinge had not occurred due to issues with resupply and the dangerous <b>approach</b> <b>march</b> that would have been required. Again, despite their efforts, the Fusiliers had failed to capture their objective. It seemed that the only way to finally secure Hill 217 was along the ridge from Hill 317, via the Hinge, and as such the Australians would be tasked with capturing the Hinge the following day. B Company was subsequently allocated the attack. In preparation, they ascended Hill 317 late in the afternoon of 6 October, finally securing the crest, and at last light joined 9 Platoon on the knoll northwest of the summit where they would form up the next day to conduct the assault.|$|E
5|$|That night, the Japanese made a minor {{attack against}} 'C' Company, {{but this was}} turned back with {{artillery}} and small arms. The following day the Australians resumed their attack. In doing so, McKinna ordered 'D' Company to renew the assault, aiming for Pear Hill, on the right hand side of the Australian line. Although it required a more physically draining <b>approach</b> <b>march</b> over Artillery Hill and through dense scrub, the tactic {{proved to be more}} successful than the previous day's efforts. Pear Hill was joined by a narrow razorback ridge that limited the Australian frontage to just three men side-by-side, who had to cut their way through the thick bamboo with machetes. Weighed down with full marching order and heavy weapons, including Vickers machine guns, the Australians found it heavy going. It took the majority of the afternoon to reach {{the crest of the hill}} where they were to form up for the final assault. A thirty-minute pause followed, after which an artillery barrage was called down upon the Japanese defenders. On their right, 'A' Company, began to draw the Japanese fire and at 15:30 hours 'D' Company attacked the ridge, across a thin saddle. By late afternoon, the Japanese defenders had pulled back from the ridge, leaving the Australians in possession of it after heavy fighting with 'D' Company securing the main position, while 'B' Company skirted north of Barton's Knoll and secured a secondary position below the ridge, which the Australians dubbed Baker's Brow. Meanwhile, on the Australian left—the western side of the battlefield—a Juki heavy machine and snipers held up 'C' Company's advance.|$|E
5000|$|The slow {{movement}} {{opens with}} a distant trumpet call, with both timpani playing quietly.

25|$|The {{rains and}} French mortar fire {{destroyed}} German field fortifications almost {{as fast as}} they were built. To gain more defensive depth and to mislead the French about German offensive preparations at Verdun, the I Bavarian Reserve Corps (General der Infanterie Karl von Fasbender) conducted Unternehmen Rupprecht (Operation Rupprecht), several carefully prepared local attacks. Before the first attack (Unternehmen Rupprecht I), a battalion of Reserve Infantry Regiment 229 of the 50th Reserve Division built fake encampments and made several <b>approach</b> <b>marches</b> to simulate a big reinforcement of the area to French reconnaissance aircraft.|$|R
50|$|Vega 1 {{made its}} closest <b>approach</b> on <b>March</b> 6, around 8,890 km from the nucleus, and Vega 2 made its closest <b>approach</b> on <b>March</b> 9 at 8,030 km. The data {{intensive}} {{examination of the}} comet covered only the three hours around closest approach. They were intended to measure the physical parameters of the nucleus, such as dimensions, shape, temperature and surface properties, {{as well as to}} study the structure and dynamics of the coma, the gas composition close to the nucleus, the dust particles' composition and mass distribution as functions of distance to the nucleus and the cometary-solar wind interaction.|$|R
25|$|Quick Advance - This was a rapid {{movement}} forward, generally after a circuitous <b>approach</b> <b>march</b> meant {{to confuse the}} enemy. Once all the units in the operation were on track, a quick advance was usually made in small and inconspicuous groups to a forward staging area from where the attack would be launched.|$|E
25|$|Recon {{elements}} scouted {{the flanks}} and rear extensively, especially while crossing obstacles or in enemy-held areas. Most movement was at night. Integral to any movement into a camp {{was the use}} of multiple avenues of approach, avoiding predictable patterns that could be exploited by opposing forces. When making an <b>approach</b> <b>march</b> for a planned battle, a long, roundabout route was generally taken, often criss-crossing earlier movements to fool enemy surveillance.|$|E
25|$|In June–July 1941 the {{battalion}} {{took part in}} the fighting against the Vichy French in the Syria–Lebanon campaign, during which it was initially placed in brigade reserve during the advance into Lebanon, which saw {{the battalion}}’s companies split up as they were detached to the other three battalions of the brigade as required. Later they were reunited and on 19 June, after carrying out a grueling <b>approach</b> <b>march</b> over difficult terrain, the 2/25th launched its only major attack of the campaign in an effort to retake the town of Merdjayoun after a Vichy counterattack had recaptured it a few days earlier. Encountering a force of French tanks, however, the battalion’s attack was ultimately unsuccessful and they suffered heavy casualties, as well as losing over 50 men captured.|$|E

50|$|In 1972, the ERA {{was sent}} to the states, with a seven-year {{deadline}} to get 38 states to ratify the amendment. Most states were eager to pass the legislation; in 1972, 22 states ratified the amendment and eight more joined in 1973. Between 1974 and 1977, only five states approved the ERA, and advocates became worried about the <b>approaching</b> <b>March</b> 22, 1979 deadline. At the same time, the legislatures of four states which had ratified the ERA then adopted legislation purporting to rescind those ratifications. If, indeed, a state legislature has power to rescind, then the ERA actually had ratifications by only 31 states - not 35 - when March 22, 1979 rolled around.|$|R
25|$|As Hohenlohe marched {{along the}} Schönermark road, his troops kept bumping into French patrols {{in the morning}} mist. As the column passed through the marshes, the dragoon flankers {{returned}} to the main road and pushed {{their way into the}} line of march. This spread the column out over a greater distance. Lasalle tried to block the Prussian <b>approach</b> <b>march</b> in the suburb, but Schwerin's cuirassiers brushed the French hussars out of the way. Hohenlohe directed his troops to move through the city and draw rations from a wagon train parked {{on the other side of}} Prenzlau. To cover his march, Hohenlohe posted General-Major von Tschammer with two grenadier battalions across the Berlin highway with their battalion guns trained on the road. Smaller detachments guarded the lake shore, the town gate, and a paper-mill.|$|E
25|$|In {{the months}} {{following}} the raid on Salamaua, the 2/5th continued patrol operations around the Huon Gulf. When {{it became apparent that}} the Japanese were concentrating their forces at Mubu with the intention of launching an attack against Wau, the 2/5th launched another raid on 1 October 1942, consisting of a party of 60 men, again under Winning's command. During the <b>approach</b> <b>march,</b> Lieutenant Bill Drysdale was wounded by a booby trap, which alerted the nearby Japanese. The Japanese defenders came out to meet the raid, driving the outnumbered Australians back. Heavy fighting followed, and while attempting to cover the withdrawal, one of the raiders, Sergeant William O'Neill, killed up to 16 Japanese with sub-machine-gun fire. The Japanese were later estimated to have lost 50 killed, including the company commander; nevertheless, the raid was broken up and the Australians spent several days regrouping.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, dubbed Operation Off Balance, {{the plan}} tried {{to live up}} to its name by kicking off hurriedly on 1 July 1969, three days after it was proposed. The Hmong Bataillon Guerrier 206 (Warrior Battalion 206) was helilifted to a landing zone at the old Operation Momentum base at San Luang. They moved out on foot northeastward toward the objective. Neutralist Bataillon Commando 208 (Commando Battalion 208), which had been regrouped at Xieng Dat after their flight from Muang Soui, marched eastward to join that column. In a {{separate}} move, the paratroop battalion, 101 Bataillon de Parachutistes (101st Parachute Battalion), was helicoptered to Ban Na, southeast of the objective, to begin their <b>approach</b> <b>march.</b> In a third part of the operation, the Hmong Bataillon Guerrier 201 (Warrior Battalion 201) paired with the Neutralist Bataillon d'Infanterie 15 (Battalion of Infantry 15); they were helicoptered to Phou So to walk south to Muang Soui.|$|E

25|$|Nevertheless, the battalion's {{first major}} action {{did not come}} until mid-1917 when the British shifted their focus towards the Ypres sector in Belgium and the 3rd Division was {{committed}} to the Battle of Messines as part of II Anzac Corps on 7 June. The 34th Battalion, {{along with the rest}} of the 9th Brigade, was tasked with leading the division's assault. Beginning their <b>approach</b> <b>march</b> late on 6 June, they were caught in a German gas bombardment that inflicted heavy casualties; nevertheless, they arrived at the line of departure on time and, after a number of mines were exploded in front of their positions, the assault began. The exploding mines destroyed a large part of the German line and as a result initial resistance was quickly overcome. By 5am on 7 June, the division had gained the crest of the Messines Ridge and dug-in to defend against a possible counter-attack, with the 34th occupying a position around Grey Farm.|$|E
25|$|After {{landing at}} Alexandria, 60th Division {{moved to the}} Suez Canal to join the Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF), where its units were re-equipped and {{underwent}} training before crossing Sinai in early July 1917. Further intensive training followed until late October, when the division made its first full-scale attack of the war, at Beersheba. After a silent <b>approach</b> <b>march</b> during the night of 30/31 October, the division bombarded and then attacked Hill 1070, a prominent feature {{in front of the}} Turkish main defences. 181st Brigade advanced on the left at 08.30, with 2/21st in close support, and the position was taken at the double within 10 minutes. 2/21st Battalion lost a few casualties to enemy shellfire while waiting, but none in the attack. The guns then moved up to bombard the Turkish main line, and at 12.15, 181 Bde went forward again with 2/21st in the centre, capturing their objectives without a hitch and forming an outpost line. That evening the town of Beersheba fell to the Desert Mounted Corps.|$|E
25|$|At the Battle of Monmouth on 28 June 1778, the {{regiment}} {{was led by}} Lieutenant Colonel Parke. The unit fought in William Grayson's 600-man and two-gun detachment together with David Cook's company of the 3rd Continental Artillery Regiment, Grayson's Additional Continental Regiment, and the converged 4th, 8th, and 12th Virginia Regiments under James Woods. Charles Lee ordered Grayson's detachment to lead his Advanced Guard in the <b>approach</b> <b>march</b> to Monmouth Courthouse. Lee placed Grayson, Henry Jackson's detachment and Richard Butler's detachment, and Eleazer Oswald's four guns under Anthony Wayne. Between 9:30 and 10:00 AM, Wayne's group engaged in a somewhat confused skirmish with the British rear guard. At this point, the British commander Sir Henry Clinton mounted a powerful counterattack with 6,000 men and Lee lost control of his division, which began to retreat. To his amazement, Washington saw Lee's troops retreating toward him, led by Grayson's and Patton's Regiments. After Washington and his generals organized a new battle line, Lee's division regrouped behind the main body and {{the second half of}} the battle began.|$|E

5000|$|Back in Guayaquil, General Sucre {{concluded}} that {{the best course of}} action for the next campaign would be to drop any further attempt of a direct advance to Quito by way of Guaranda, in favor of an indirect <b>approach,</b> <b>marching</b> first to the southern highlands and Cuenca before wheeling north and advancing up the inter-Andean [...] "corridor" [...] towards Quito. This plan had several advantages. Retaking Cuenca would cut all communications between Quito and Lima, and would allow Sucre to wait for the reinforcements that in the meantime San Martín had promised would come from Perú. Also, a more progressive and slower advance from the lowlands up the Andes into the southern highlands would allow for a gradual adaptation of the troops to the physiological effects of the altitude. Moreover, {{it was the only way}} to avoid another direct clash in unfavorable conditions with the Royalist forces coming down from Quito.|$|R
25|$|Lieutenant Colonel Marcel Bigeard and his 3rd Colonial Parachute Regiment (3e RPC) - {{recently}} returned from successful operations in Algiers - were tasked with hunting down the unit and stopping it. French intelligence suggested that the unit would move west, tasked with escorting commanders of Wilya 4 to a rendezvous with other FLN forces near Médéa. Bigeard decided to ambush Commando 41 on their way and picked Agounenda on the Oued Boulbane, a known FLN route. Bigeard and the 3e RPC was transported by truck from their base at Sidi Ferruch to Hill 895, where they arrived by 01:30 on 23 May. From there Bigeard and his 700 paratroopers made a cold, 4-hour night <b>approach</b> <b>march</b> under strict noise and light discipline. Before dawn the paratroopers was in place and concealed. The Headquarters and mortars were on Hill 1298; the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Companies and the Reconnaissance Squadron on foot were spread over 10km on four crests overlooking the enemy’s probable route. The 4th and Support Companies were in reserve, while helicopters and ground-attack aircraft were on stand-by at Médéa.|$|E
25|$|On {{the second}} day, Lee {{attempted}} {{to capitalize on}} his first day's success by launching multiple attacks against the Union flanks. After a lengthy delay to assemble his forces and avoid detection in his <b>approach</b> <b>march,</b> Longstreet attacked with his First Corps against the Union left flank. His division under Maj. Gen. John Bell Hood attacked Little Round Top and Devil's Den. To Hood's left, Maj. Gen. Lafayette McLaws attacked the Wheatfield and the Peach Orchard. Although neither prevailed, the Union III Corps was effectively destroyed as a combat organization as it attempted to defend a salient over too wide a front. Gen. Meade rushed as many as 20,000 reinforcements from elsewhere in his line to resist these fierce assaults. The attacks in this sector concluded with an unsuccessful assault by the Third Corps division of Maj. Gen. Richard H. Anderson against the Union center on Cemetery Ridge. That evening, Ewell's Second Corps turned demonstrations against the Union right flank into full-scale assaults on Culp's Hill and East Cemetery Hill, but both were repulsed. The Union army had occupied strong defensive positions, and Meade handled his forces well, resulting in heavy losses for both sides but leaving the disposition of forces on both sides essentially unchanged.|$|E
25|$|A muster roll from September 10, 1775 {{showed that}} Thayer's company {{consisted}} of two lieutenants, four sergeants, four corporals, a fifer, and 79 privates. That month his company was selected to join Benedict Arnold's expedition to Quebec. On the morning of December 31, 1775 the Americans opened the Battle of Quebec by attacking the city. The main column under Colonel Benedict Arnold and Lieutenant Colonel Christopher Greene was led by Captain Daniel Morgan's company. Morgan's advance guard {{was followed by the}} companies of Captains John Lamb, Henry Dearborn, John Topham, and Thayer. Seven more companies formed the center and rear of the attack column. In the <b>approach</b> <b>march,</b> the column suffered some casualties from enemy fire. Since a snow storm was raging, the head of the column became disoriented and lost its direction before Thayer, who knew the way, led the soldiers on. Presently, they arrived before a barrier armed with two cannons which fired, causing further losses. As the guns were withdrawn to reload, Thayer and Morgan climbed through the gunports, followed by their men, and captured 60 of the defenders. Continuing up the street, the Americans surprised a group of Quebec militia and made them prisoners, making a total of 130. Since their own firearms were wet from the snow, the Americans appropriated the dry weapons of the Canadians. A second barrier farther along repelled all their attempts to seize it, partly because so many muskets misfired in the blizzard. After four hours of fighting, the Americans found themselves trapped and they surrendered when the British promised to grant them quarter.|$|E
