[...] Arnaz, Jr. said, [...] "It is an amazing saga of people in search of the American dream. It is my father`s story. It is the story of many people who came to this country with hopes and dreams." [...] Tito Puente praised the film prior to its {{theatrical}} release, stating, [...] "I've seen the movie twice, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>it</b> the second time. The first time I couldn't get into it. I was watching for too many details, I guess. But now I've seen it a second time, and I think it's great." ...|$|E

He {{believes}} that an actor with a [...] "proven track record" [...] would likely have been chosen if another network had broadcast the show. He went through numerous auditions; each time he explained to the casting directors what he could bring to the character, if given the part. Alan Taylor and Mad Men creator Matthew Weiner initially thought Hamm was too handsome for the role but ultimately decided, [...] "it was perfect to cast sort of the perfect male in this part". Weiner also sensed that the actor had suffered early loss of his parents, which was similar to Draper's backstory.|$|E

[...] "I plan to continue school, [...] I’m looking into transferring somewhere in Boston,” {{she said in an interview}} with Inside Gymnastics magazine. “Brown is a great school <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>it,</b> but it was just not the best atmosphere for me; maybe a little too liberal. It was a great two years, and I learned a lot about myself and from the professors and coaches there. I’m looking at Boston University, Boston College and Harvard. I want to weigh my options before I make an ultimate decision, but I would love to transfer to Harvard. I think that would be pretty much ideal." ...|$|E

500|$|Reviewers {{who gave}} Wipeout 3 lower marks noted {{a sense of}} {{disappointment}} that the series broke little new ground. Stuart Miles of The Times admitted Wipeout 3 was a good game, but {{felt that he had}} been expecting much more from the sequel: [...] "It's as if the programmers have concerned themselves more with the overall look and feel, rather than further developing the existing gameplay." [...] Alistair Wallace of Gamasutra, in a retrospective on Wipeout 2097, remembered that [...] "I enjoyed [...] because it was more of the same <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>it,</b> but I think the series ran out of its innovation. Doing loop the loops isn't a big deal really." [...] GameSpot summed up its review of the game by judging Wipeout 3 an excellent racer, but not able to beat Wipeout 2097 as the best futuristic racing game of all time.|$|E

In April 2010, Sebastian Stan, who had been mentioned in media accounts as a possibility for the title role, was cast as Bucky Barnes. Stan is contracted for multiple films. Also in April, Marvel announced that Hayley Atwell had been cast as Peggy Carter, and that the film's name had been changed from The First Avenger: Captain America to Captain America: The First Avenger. The next day it was reported that Joss Whedon would be rewriting the script as part of his negotiation to write and direct The Avengers. Whedon said in August, [...] "I just got to make some character connections. The structure of the thing was really tight <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>it,</b> but {{there were a couple of}} opportunities to find his voice a little bit —and some of the other characters' — and make the connections so that you understood exactly why he wanted to be who he wanted to be.

The same day, Spears uploaded {{a picture of the}} cover art to her Twitter account. Kesha told MTV News, [...] "I'm a massive fan of both the ladies I share the track with. I wrote 'TTWE' for Britney [...] and she killed it <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>it,</b> but I just thought a supergroup of three hot, strong women could just take over the airwaves." [...] The remix adds heavier bass during the beginning, and starts with Minaj rapping with intensity about a female hater, in lines such as [...] "Told you they'd revive your career, but somebody lied/ I ain't talkin' poultry when I say this chicken's fried." [...] This continues by Spears singing the first verse, after which Minaj says [...] "It's Britney, bitch. I'm Nicki Minaj and that's Kesha!", and the first chorus is sung by the latter. Spears continues with the song and is accompanied by Kesha {{towards the end of the}} second verse and the bridge.

He tells this story in his autobiography, The Confessions. He remembers that he did not steal the fruit because he was hungry, but because [...] "it was not permitted." [...] His very nature, he says, was flawed. 'It was foul, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>it.</b> I loved my own error—not that for which I erred, but the error itself."

But most of all I loved it when no trace of man marred the majesty of Nature, and when the sun-bursts slanted down on it from between the drifting rainclouds. Then I have seen the further edge draped in the gauze of the driving rain, with its thin grey shading under the slow clouds, while my headland was golden, and the sun gleamed upon the breakers and struck deep through the green waves beyond, showing up the purple patches where the beds of seaweed are lying. Such a morning as that, with the wind in his hair, and the spray on his lips, and the cry of the eddying gulls in his ear, may send a man back braced afresh to the reek of a sick-room, and the dead, drab weariness of practice.|$|E
6000|$|Arthur Berkeley {{laid the}} letter {{down with a}} quiet sigh, and folded his hands despondently before him. He hadn't seen very much of Edie, yet the {{disappointment}} was to him a very bitter one. It had been a pleasant day-dream, truly, and he was both to part with it so unexpectedly. 'Poor little Miss Butterfly,' he said to himself, tenderly and compassionately; 'poor, airy, flitting, bright-eyed little Miss Butterfly. I must give you up, must I, and Ernest Le Breton must take you for better, for worse, must he? La reyne le veult, it seems, and her word is law.

He will overshadow and darken your bright little life, I fear me; not intentionally--he couldn't do that--but by his Quixotic fads and fancies; good fads, honest fads, but fads wholly impracticable in this jarring universe of clashing interests, where he who would swim must keep his own head steadily above water, and he who minds his neighbour must sink like lead to the unfathomable bottom. He will sink, I doubt not, poor little Miss Butterfly; he will sink inevitably, and drag you down with him, down, down, down to immeasurable depths of poverty and despair. Oh, my poor little butterfly, I'm sorry for you, and sorry for myself. It was a pretty dream, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>it</b> dearly.

I'd been studying hard for some years, and needed rest, so I was glad to go. As a good book for an excursion, I took this Wordsworth in my bag. It is full of fine passages, you know, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>it,</b> for {{it was one of the}} books given to Lucretia by her lover. We had a charming time, and were on our way to Quebec when my little adventure happened. I was in raptures over the grand St. Lawrence as we steamed slowly from Montreal that lovely summer day. I could not read, but sat on the upper deck, feasting my eyes and dreaming dreams as even staid maiden ladies will when out on a holiday. Suddenly I caught the sound of voices in earnest discussion on the lower deck, and, glancing down, saw several gentlemen leaning against the rail as they talked over certain events of great public interest at that moment. I knew that a party of distinguished persons were on board, as my friend's husband, Dr. Tracy, knew some of them, and pointed out Mr. Warburton as one of the rising scientific men of the day. I remembered that my sister had met him years ago, and much admired him both for his own gifts and because he had known Lyman. As other people were listening, I felt no delicacy about doing the same, for the conversation was an eloquent one, and well worth catching. So interested did I become that I forgot the great rafts floating by, the picturesque shores, the splendid river, and leaned nearer and nearer that no word might be lost, till my book slid out of my lap and fell straight down upon the head of one of the gentlemen, giving him a smart blow, and knocking his hat overboard." ...|$|E
