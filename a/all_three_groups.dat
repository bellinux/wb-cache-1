5|$|Central Atlas Tamazight {{is one of}} {{the four}} most-spoken Berber languages, in {{addition}} to Kabyle, Shilha, and Riff, and rivals Shilha as the most-spoken Berber language in Morocco. Differentiating these dialects is {{complicated by the fact that}} speakers of other languages may also refer to their language as 'Tamazight'. The differences between <b>all</b> <b>three</b> <b>groups</b> are largely phonological and lexical, rather than syntactic. Tamazight itself has a relatively large degree of internal diversity, including whether spirantization occurs.|$|E
5|$|In 1695 {{the colonial}} {{authorities}} decided to act upon {{a plan to}} connect the province of Guatemala with Yucatán, and a three-way invasion of the Lacandon was launched simultaneously from San Mateo Ixtatán, Cobán and Ocosingo. Captain Rodriguez Mazariegos, accompanied by Fray de Rivas and 6 other missionaries together with 50 Spanish soldiers, left Huehuetenango for San Mateo Ixtatán. Following the same route used in 1686, they managed {{on the way to}} recruit 200indigenous Maya warriors from Santa Eulalia, San Juan Solomá and San Mateo. On 28 February 1695, <b>all</b> <b>three</b> <b>groups</b> left their respective bases of operations to conquer the Lacandon. The San Mateo group headed northeast into the Lacandon Jungle, and joined up with Jacinto de Barrios Leal, president of the Royal Audiencia of Guatemala.|$|E

5|$|Group Two, {{under the}} command of Captain Burn, would land at the old {{entrance}} to the St Nazaire basin. Their objectives were to destroy the anti-aircraft positions in the area and the German headquarters, to blow up the locks and bridges at the old entrance into the basin and then to guard against a counter-attack from the submarine base. Group Three was {{under the command}} of Major William 'Bill' Copland, who was also the Commandos' second in command. They were to secure the immediate area around Campbeltown, destroy the dock's water-pumping and gate-opening machinery and the nearby underground fuel tanks. <b>All</b> <b>three</b> <b>groups</b> were subdivided into assault, demolition and protection teams. The assault teams would clear the way for the other two. The demolition teams carrying the explosive charges only had sidearms for self-defence; the protection teams, armed with Thompson submachine guns, were to defend them while they completed their tasks.|$|E
5|$|Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino (STT) of Trieste was {{selected}} for the contract to build eight vessels, ahead of one other tenderer. Despite the specifications of the contract being {{very close to the}} requirements for the coastal torpedo boat, the STT boats were classified as sea-going. The STT boats used Parsons turbines driving two propeller shafts. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when Ganz & Danubius reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them. These boats were powered by AEG-Curtiss turbines, and had two funnels rather than the single funnel of the STT boats. The third contract went to Cantiere Navale Triestino (CNT), who used Melms-Pfenniger turbines, and their boats also had two funnels. The boats of <b>all</b> <b>three</b> <b>groups</b> used steam generated by two Yarrow water-tube boilers, one of which burned fuel oil and the other coal.|$|E
5|$|Within clade Synapsida, Dimetrodon {{is part of}} the clade Sphenacodontia, {{which was}} first {{proposed}} as an early synapsid group in 1940 by paleontologists Alfred Romer and Llewellyn Ivor Price, along with the groups Ophiacodontia and Edaphosauria. <b>All</b> <b>three</b> <b>groups</b> are known from the Late Carboniferous and Early Permian. Romer and Price distinguished them primarily by postcranial features such as the shapes of limbs and vertebrae. Ophiacodontia was considered the most primitive group because its members appeared the most reptilian, and Sphenacodontia was the most advanced because its members appeared the most like a group called Therapsida, which included the closest relatives to mammals. Romer and Price placed another group of early synapsids called varanopids within Sphenacodontia, considering them to be more primitive than other sphenacodonts like Dimetrodon. They thought varanopids and Dimetrodon-like sphenacodonts were closely related because both groups were carnivorous, although varanopids are much smaller and more lizard-like, lacking sails.|$|E

5|$|In Ireland, the {{population}} was split into three main socio-political groups: the Gaelic Irish, who were Catholic; the Old English, who were descended from medieval Normans and were also predominantly Catholic; and the New English, who were Protestant settlers from England and Scotland aligned with the English Parliament and the Covenanters. Strafford's administration had improved the Irish economy and boosted tax revenue, but had done so by heavy-handedly imposing order. He had trained up a large Catholic army {{in support of the}} king and had weakened the authority of the Irish Parliament, while continuing to confiscate land from Catholics for Protestant settlement {{at the same time as}} promoting a Laudian Anglicanism that was anathema to Presbyterians. As a result, <b>all</b> <b>three</b> <b>groups</b> had become disaffected. Strafford's impeachment provided a new departure for Irish politics whereby all sides joined together to present evidence against him. In a similar manner to the English Parliament, the Old English members of the Irish Parliament argued that while opposed to Strafford they remained loyal to Charles. They argued that the king had been led astray by malign counsellors, and that, moreover, a viceroy such as Strafford could emerge as a despotic figure instead of ensuring that the king was directly involved in governance.|$|E

25|$|When it {{was first}} discovered, the {{scientists}} who studied Anchiornis conducted a phylogenetic analysis and concluded {{that it was an}} early member of the group Avialae, along with Archaeopteryx. Members of Avialae, called avialans, are all more closely related to modern birds than they are to dromaeosaurid and troodontid dinosaurs, though the earliest and most primitive members of <b>all</b> <b>three</b> <b>groups</b> are extremely similar to each other, which makes it difficult to sort out exactly which of these three main paravian branches they belong to.|$|E
25|$|From 1970, the VHSL's member {{schools were}} {{organized}} into three group classifications based on enrollment: A, AA, and AAA. Each {{of the three}} groups were split into four geographic regions, which usually contained three or four districts. District sizes vary and consist of four to eleven teams. The group of schools with the largest enrollments were in Group AAA, the group with the next largest enrollments were in Group AA, and the schools with the smallest enrollments were in Group A. Regional boundaries were different for <b>all</b> <b>three</b> <b>groups</b> as average school sizes vary substantially in different parts of Virginia.|$|E
25|$|While {{the first}} episode aired as planned, Kirschenbaum, then Director-General of the Israel Broadcasting Authority, was {{reluctant}} to screen the second episode until <b>all</b> <b>three</b> <b>groups</b> that interrogated prisoners—the police, the Shin Bet, and the military—responded to the allegations against them. Both {{the police and the}} Shin Bet did, but the IDF refused to respond to the charges of an anonymous young reservist, who claimed on camera to {{have been involved in the}} physical and mental abuse of prisoners. Even when it finally agreed to respond, it refused to ensure that the whistleblower's anonymity would be protected. The second episode finally aired almost eight months after the first, on 14 June 2004.|$|E

25|$|After {{the end of}} the war, {{from which}} al-Mu'tazz emerged victorious, the Faraghina {{returned}} to Samarra. As the government continued to suffer from a worsening fiscal crisis, the caliph attempted to favor the Faraghina and Maghariba and use them against the Turks; in spite of this, however, <b>all</b> <b>three</b> <b>groups</b> united to overthrow al-Mu'tazz in July 869. The next caliph, al-Muhtadi, likewise promised to bestow favors upon the Faraghina and the other non-Turkish regiments of the army. When the Turks under Musa ibn Bugha al-Kabir revolted against the caliph in June 870, the Faraghina defended al-Muhtadi and comprised the bulk of his cavalry; in the resulting battle, they were defeated and suffered heavy losses.|$|E
25|$|Ludlow's inquisition {{post mortem}} at Shrewsbury in January 1391 showed that, despite his great wealth, {{technically}} he held no land {{at all in}} the county, as the king, Richard II, had licensed him to vest everything in Burley and other feoffees, a strategem that allowed him to avoid payment of impositions like feudal relief as well as free disposal of the properties according to his own wishes. Ludlow had appointed three groups of feoffees to hold his properties in trust and Burley was a member of <b>all</b> <b>three</b> <b>groups.</b> On 8 February the king instructed his escheator in Shropshire to meddle no further with the Ludlow estates and remitted the feoffees' homages and fealties for 6s. 8d.|$|E
25|$|The {{individuals}} in each colony {{can usually be}} separated into three groups: on the nest, next to the nest, or absent from the nest. Those {{who are on the}} nest usually consist of the dominant reproductive female, queens, and those caring for the brood or taking care of the nest. If more than one reproducing female is present in a nest, the less dominant one either stays on a smaller comb or remains next to the nest {{out of the way of}} the dominant individual. Non-reproductive individuals can reside in <b>all</b> <b>three</b> <b>groups,</b> but they usually remain either next to the nest or absent from the nest foraging for food. If they are on the nest, the dominants often force these subordinates onto smaller combs.|$|E
