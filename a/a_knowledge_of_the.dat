5|$|Robert {{died after}} 1174, and was {{probably}} buried in his priory. His successor was Philip of Oxford, {{who was in}} office by 1180. Besides his theological works, Robert also searched throughout England for Hebrew texts {{of the works of}} Josephus, according to Gerald of Wales, who claimed that Robert had <b>a</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hebrew language.|$|E
5|$|A {{knowledge}} of pKa values {{is important for}} the quantitative treatment of systems involving acid–base equilibria in solution. Many applications exist in biochemistry; for example, the pKa values of proteins and amino acid side chains are of major importance for the activity of enzymes and the stability of proteins. Protein pKa values cannot always be measured directly, but may be calculated using theoretical methods. Buffer solutions are used extensively to provide solutions at or near the physiological pH for the study of biochemical reactions; the design of these solutions depends on <b>a</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pKa values of their components. Important buffer solutions include MOPS, which provides a solution with pH 7.2, and tricine, which is used in gel electrophoresis. Buffering {{is an essential part of}} acid base physiology including acid–base homeostasis, and is key to understanding disorders such as acid–base imbalance. The isoelectric point of a given molecule is a function of its pK values, so different molecules have different isoelectric points. This permits a technique called isoelectric focusing, which is used for separation of proteins by 2-D gel polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.|$|E
5|$|In 1801, Hinde {{got a job}} {{as deputy}} clerk for the Kentucky Court of Appeals. William Kavanaugh, the husband of Hinde's older sister Hannah, {{assigned}} him to Achilles Sneed of Frankfort. He received a good legal education with Sneed, who was Clerk of the Court of Appeals. During this time, Hinde became acquainted with many of the state's leading men, and acquired <b>a</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law. He also developed {{a reputation as one of}} Kentucky's most efficient businessmen. Hinde wrote to Henry Clay that he was the first lawyer whom Hinde heard address a court. Hinde resided in a boarding house, shared with many of the leading judges and politicians of the day, where he strengthened his personal and political contacts.|$|E

25|$|Directional-hemispherical {{reflectance}} {{is sometimes}} referred to as black-sky albedo and bi-hemispherical reflectance as white-sky albedo.

50|$|<b>As</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{significant}} role that mangrove ecosystems {{play in the}} tropical coastal zone grew worldwide, {{it became clear that}} mangroves are marginal ecosystems, vulnerable to sudden or drastic changes in the environment.

25|$|Resonating bass traps will absorb {{sound with}} high {{efficiency}} at their fundamental frequency of resonance. As such, <b>a</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> frequencies of resonances which require damping is helpful before designing and constructing a resonating bass trap.

25|$|A {{variation}} {{is that the}} alphabet was first invented, for whatever reason, in 4th-century Irish settlements in west Wales after contact and intermarriage with Romanised Britons with <b>a</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Latin alphabet. In fact, several ogham stones in Wales are bilingual, containing both Irish and British Latin, testifying to the international contacts {{that led to the}} existence of some of these stones.|$|E

25|$|Piecing {{together}} landscapes {{requires a}} sometimes difficult union between natural and social sciences, {{close attention to}} geographic and temporal scales, <b>a</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> range of human ecological complexity, and the presentation of findings {{in a way that}} is useful to researchers in many fields. Those tasks require theory and methods drawn from geography, biology, ecology, history, sociology, anthropology, and other disciplines.

25|$|What {{is needed}} is <b>a</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water content in the thunderstorm, the {{freezing}} level and {{the height of the}} summit of the precipitation. One way of calculating the water content is to transform the reflectivities in rain rate at all levels in the clouds and to sum it up. This is done by an algorithm called Vertically integrated liquid, or VIL. This value represent the total amount of liquid water in the cloud that is available. If the cloud would rain out completely, it would be the amount of rain falling on the ground and one can estimate with VIL the potential for flash flood.|$|E
25|$|Alvin Smith (February 11, 1798 – November 19, 1823) was {{the eldest}} brother of Joseph Smith, {{founder of the}} Latter Day Saint movement. Alvin took {{a leading role in}} helping the Smith family work toward paying their debts and {{building}} their home. His death at age 25 resulted in his younger brother Joseph taking more of a leading role in family affairs. A vision claimed by Joseph Smith is said to have included Alvin's presence and {{played a significant role in}} the establishment of the Mormon doctrines of redemption of those who die without <b>a</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gospel and baptism of the dead.|$|E
25|$|On 17 July 1808 Napier {{took two}} boats from Pultusk {{to join the}} three boats from Fawn in a cutting out {{expedition}} on the NE end of Port Rico. Lieutenant James Robertson, First Lieutenant of Fawn, was in charge, although Napier outranked Robertson. Napier was only accompanying Robertson to gain <b>a</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coast and agreed {{that he would have}} the status of a volunteer, and that Robertson would be responsible for the operation. The British cut out a Spanish merchant schooner from under the guns of two batteries, and then Robertson and Napier landed and spiked the guns in one battery and rendered the guns' carriages unusable.|$|E
