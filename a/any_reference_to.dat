5|$|Further {{coordination}} in {{the form}} of a General Managers' Conference faltered after Selbie withdrew in 1911 when the Central London Railway, without <b>any</b> <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> the conference, set its season ticket prices significantly lower than those on the Met's competitive routes. Suggestions of merger with the Underground Group were rejected by Selbie, a press release of November 1912 noting the Met's interests in areas outside London, its relationships with main-line railways and its freight business.|$|E
5|$|No {{surviving}} list {{of bishops}} or dioceses under the Archbishop of Uppsala from 1164, 1189, 1192, 1233, 1241 or 1248 contains <b>any</b> <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> Finland, neither factual or propagandist. No claim about a Swedish bishop in Finland {{is made in}} any other source from the era prior to the so-called Second Swedish Crusade in 1249.|$|E

25|$|As {{there are}} no {{official}} definitions of any level below 11, <b>any</b> <b>references</b> <b>to</b> the structure at level 12 and below should not be regarded as definitive.|$|R
5|$|Lands {{that were}} exempt from taxes were called manya and {{sometimes}} consisted of several villages. They were granted by local chieftains without <b>any</b> <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> the overlord, indicating a de-centralised economy. These lands, often given to heroes who {{perished in the}} line of duty were called bilavritti or kalnad. When such a grant was made for the maintenance of temples at the time of consecration, it was called Talavritti. Some types of taxes on income were kara or anthakara (internal taxes), utkota (gifts due to the king), hiranya (cash payments) and sulika (tolls and duties on imported items). Taxes were collected from those who held the right to cultivate land; even if the land was not actually cultivated.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea of a}} sonic {{weapon was}} one which had been unsuccessfully pioneered by German {{scientists}} {{under the control of}} Albert Speer during World War II. A book that Tintin examines in Professor Topolino's house, German Research in World War II by Leslie E. Simon– a retired Major General in the US Army– really existed and was published in 1947. In the strip, Hergé preserved the English language title of the book rather than translating it into French, although altered the book's cover design to remove a prominent swastika. The inclusion of the book {{is one of the few}} instances that there is <b>any</b> <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> the Second World War within The Adventures of Tintin.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, Lugosi was not {{prone to}} fits of swearing, {{particularly}} {{in front of}} women and did not perform his own water stunt in Bride of the Monster. Lugosi is also depicted as dying alone and miserable. Lugosi's wife of twenty years, Lillian, did leave him in 1953, but he remarried in 1955 to Hope Lininger. They were together until his death a year later. This, plus <b>any</b> <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> Lugosi's teenage son, Bela G. Lugosi, were omitted, as is any mention of Lugosi's role in the 1956 United Artists film The Black Sleep. Also, when Ed Wood talks to George Weiss about making I Changed My Sex!, Weiss mentions Chained Girls, implying that Chained Girls was made before Glen or Glenda, when in fact Chained Girls was made afterwards.|$|E

50|$|Later, on 12 May 2009, Lutsenko {{claimed he}} would sue Bild. According to Lutsenko, the {{publication}} {{does not contain}} “any true things, <b>any</b> <b>references</b> <b>to</b> documents or real officials”.|$|R
50|$|The {{film was}} altered taking out <b>any</b> <b>references</b> <b>to</b> the {{original}} film, re-edited {{and then finally}} released in 1993 as Savage Vengeance. Director Donald Farmer still denies these claims.|$|R
5|$|The Communist Party {{strongly}} supported {{the restoration of}} Alexandrov's melody, but some members proposed other changes to the anthem. In March 2010, Boris Kashin, a CPRF member of the Duma, advocated {{for the removal of}} <b>any</b> <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> God in the anthem. Kashin's suggestion was also supported by Alexander Nikonov, a journalist with SPID-INFO and an avowed atheist. Nikonov argued that religion should be a private matter and should not be used by the state. Kashin found that the cost for making a new anthem recording will be about 120,000rubles. The Russian Government quickly rejected the request because it lacked statistical data and other findings. Nikonov asked the Constitutional Court of Russia in 2005 if the lyrics were compatible with Russian law.|$|E
5|$|The Western Ganga {{rule was}} a period of brisk {{literary}} activity in Sanskrit and Kannada, though many of the writings are now considered extinct and are known only from references made to them. Chavundaraya's writing, Chavundaraya Purana (or Trishashtilakshana mahapurana) of 978 CE, is an early existing work in prose style in Kannada and contains a summary of the Sanskrit writings, Adipurana and Uttarapurana which were written a century earlier by Jinasena and Gunabhadra during the rule of Rashtrakuta Amoghavarsha I. The prose, composed in lucid Kannada, was mainly meant for the common man and avoided <b>any</b> <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> complicated elements of Jain doctrines and philosophy. His writings seem to be influenced by the writings of his predecessor Adikavi Pampa and contemporary Ranna. The work narrates the legends of a total of 63 Jain proponents including twenty-four Jain Tirthankar, twelve Chakravartis, nine Balabhadras, nine Narayanas and nine Pratinarayanas.|$|E
5|$|The {{absence of}} <b>any</b> <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> a Davidic son-ship {{in the gospel}} text {{suggests}} that Jesus has been elected to be the end-time prophet, the Chosen One, sent to abolish the Jewish sacrifices. The Prophet-Christology of the gospel text quoted by Epiphanius is more {{at home with the}} Clementine literature than the Christology of the Ebionites known to Irenaeus. According to scholars Richard Bauckham and Petri Luomanen, Jesus is understood in this gospel as having come to abolish the sacrifices rather than substituting for them; thus it is unlikely that it contained the same institution of the Eucharist as practiced by Nicene orthodox Christianity. However, scholars have yet to reach a consensus over the sacrificial significance of Jesus' mission as depicted in the Ebionite gospel.|$|E

25|$|The legal {{consequences}} of a civil partnership are identical to those of a marriage under the Marriage Act, except for such changes as are required by the context. <b>Any</b> <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> marriage in any law, including the common law, is deemed to include civil partnership {{in terms of the}} Civil Union Act; similarly, <b>any</b> <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> husband, wife or spouse in any law is deemed to include a civil partner.

25|$|Couples marrying {{in terms}} of the Civil Union Act may choose whether their union is {{registered}} as a marriage or a civil partnership. In either case, the legal consequences are identical to those of a marriage under the Marriage Act, except for such changes as are required by the context. <b>Any</b> <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> marriage in any law, including the common law, is deemed to include a marriage or civil partnership {{in terms of}} the Civil Union Act; similarly, <b>any</b> <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> husband, wife or spouse in any law is deemed to include a reference to a spouse or civil partner {{in terms of the}} Civil Union Act.|$|E

50|$|Note: <b>Any</b> <b>references</b> <b>to</b> St Nicholas, Newcastle on the IGI under Libbis are misattributions {{of records}} from St Nicholas, Great Yarmouth {{and the same}} applies for misattributions that say Earsdon by North Shields, but should say St Edmund's, Southwold.|$|R

25|$|Even the {{indirect}} reference to types {{implicit in the}} notion of stratification can be eliminated. Theodore Hailperin showed in 1944 that Comprehension is equivalent to a finite conjunction of its instances, so that NF can be finitely axiomatized without <b>any</b> <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> the notion of type.|$|E
25|$|In 1639, {{the actors}} were fined £1000 for {{depicting}} a religious ceremony on stage this depiction {{was taken as}} anti-Catholic, but in the late 1630s, almost <b>any</b> <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> religion was risky.
