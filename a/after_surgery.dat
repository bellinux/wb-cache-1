5|$|Cholangiocarcinoma is {{considered}} to be an incurable and rapidly lethal cancer unless both the primary tumor and any metastases can be fully removed by surgery. No potentially curative treatment exists except surgery, but most people have advanced stage disease at presentation and are inoperable at the time of diagnosis. People with cholangiocarcinoma are generally managed - though not cured - with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and other palliative care measures. These are also used as additional therapies <b>after</b> <b>surgery</b> in cases where resection has apparently been successful (or nearly so).|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{explore the}} {{surgical}} intervention time in treatment of proliferative diabetic retinopathy(PDR) combined with vitreous hemorrhage. METHODS: Totally, 128 cases(177 eyes) with PDR combined with vitreous hemorrhage were investigated retrospectively. Patients with PDR {{were divided into}} Ⅳ group, Ⅴ group and Ⅵ group. Vitrectomy and laser treatment were applied. Surgical complications, anterior chamber inflammation, intraocular pressure 1 week <b>after</b> <b>surgeries</b> and restoration of vision 6 months <b>after</b> <b>surgeries</b> were observed and compared between groups. RESULTS:Vision of all patients restored significantly <b>after</b> <b>surgeries,</b> but more significantly in Ⅳ group(P P > 0. 05). CONCLUSION: Clinical effects could be improved significantly by surgical intervention at Ⅳ stage of PDR without increasing any surgical risks...|$|R

5|$|A less {{invasive}} {{approach is}} thoracoscopy, {{usually in the}} form of a procedure called video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). The results from VATS-based pleural abrasion are slightly worse than those achieved using thoracotomy in the short term, but produce smaller scars in the skin. Compared to open thoracotomy, VATS offers a shorter in-hospital stays, less need for postoperative pain control, and a reduced risk of lung problems <b>after</b> <b>surgery.</b> VATS may also be used to achieve chemical pleurodesis; this involves insufflation of talc, which activates an inflammatory reaction that causes the lung to adhere to the chest wall.|$|E

5|$|After {{percutaneous}} coronary interventions (PCIs), such as {{the placement}} of a coronary artery stent, a U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality guideline recommends that aspirin be taken indefinitely. Frequently, aspirin is combined with an ADP receptor inhibitor, such as clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor to prevent blood clots. This is called dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). United States and European Union guidelines disagree somewhat about how long, and for what indications this combined therapy should be continued <b>after</b> <b>surgery.</b> U.S. guidelines recommend DAPT for at least 12 months, while EU guidelines recommend DAPT for 6–12 months after a drug-eluting stent placement. However, they agree that aspirin be continued indefinitely after DAPT is complete.|$|E
5|$|Another area of {{interest}} is in assessing whether keyhole surgery (laparoscopy) {{would be better than}} Whipple's procedure in treating the disease surgically, particularly in terms of recovery time. Irreversible electroporation is a relatively novel ablation technique that has shown promise in downstaging and prolonging survival in persons with locally advanced disease. It is especially suitable for treatment of tumors that are in proximity to peri-pancreatic vessels without risk of vascular trauma. The limited success of outcomes <b>after</b> <b>surgery</b> has led to a number of trials that were running in 2014 to test outcomes using chemotherapy or radiochemotherapy before surgery. This had previously not been found to be helpful, but is being trialed again, using drug combinations which have emerged from the many trials of post-operative therapies, such as FOLFIRINOX.|$|E
5|$|Obesity {{has long}} been {{regarded}} as {{a risk factor for}} venous thrombosis. It more than doubles the risk in numerous studies, particularly in combination with the use of oral contraceptives or in the period <b>after</b> <b>surgery.</b> Various coagulation abnormalities have been described in the obese. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, an inhibitor of fibrinolysis, is present in higher levels in people with obesity. Obese people also have larger numbers of circulating microvesicles (fragments of damaged cells) that bear tissue factor. Platelet aggregation may be increased, and there are higher levels of coagulation proteins such as von Willebrand factor, fibrinogen, factor VII and factor VIII. Obesity also increases the risk of recurrence after an initial episode of thrombosis.|$|E

5|$|Pituitary tumors require {{treatment}} {{when they}} are causing specific symptoms, such as headaches, visual field defects or excessive hormone secretion. Transsphenoidal surgery (removal of the tumor by an operation through the nose and the sphenoidal sinuses) may, apart from addressing symptoms related to the tumor, also improve pituitary function, although the gland is sometimes damaged further {{as a result of}} the surgery. When the tumor is removed by craniotomy (opening the skull), recovery is less likely–but sometimes this is the only suitable way to approach the tumor. <b>After</b> <b>surgery,</b> it may take some time for hormone levels to change significantly. Retesting the pituitary hormone levels is therefore performed 2 to 3 months later.|$|E

5|$|The {{relevance}} of primary implant stability decreases gradually with regrowth of bone tissue around the implant {{in the first}} weeks <b>after</b> <b>surgery,</b> leading to secondary stability. Secondary stability {{is different from the}} initial stabilization, because it results from the ongoing process of bone regrowth into the implant (osseointegration). When this healing process is complete, the initial mechanical stability becomes biological stability. Primary stability is critical to implantation success until bone regrowth maximizes mechanical and biological support of the implant. Regrowth usually occurs during the 3–4 weeks after implantation. Insufficient primary stability, or high initial implant mobility, can lead to failure.|$|E

40|$|AIM:To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} different corneal incisions on corneal astigmatism and visual acuity in patients treated by cataract surgeries and to improve the visual quality <b>after</b> cataract <b>surgeries.</b> METHODS:Totally 96 patients with cataract {{who were going to}} take phacoemulsification and intracular lens(IOL) implantation were selected. They were randomly divided into group A and group B, 48 patients(48 eyes) in each group and both were comparability. Patients in group A were treated with corneal incision on the temporal side if the right eye was the affected one, or on the nasal side if the left eye was affected. Patients in group B were treated with axial corneal incisions on the radial direction determined by the maximum curvature of the cornea. RESULTS:The difference of visual acuity between two groups at 1 wk, 1, 3 mo <b>after</b> <b>surgeries</b> was not statistically significant(P > 0. 05). Corneal astigmatism of group A at 1 wk and 1 mo <b>after</b> <b>surgeries</b> were 4. 03 ± 0. 41, 3. 72 ± 0. 35 D, respectively, and those of group B were 2. 96 ± 0. 38, 1. 29 ± 0. 15 D, which were increased compared to those before surgeries. The post-operative corneal astigmatism of group A were significant higher than those of group B(P P > 0. 05). The most common axis of the two groups preoperatively was astigmatism against the rule. At 1 wk <b>after</b> <b>surgeries,</b> astigmatism with the rule increased, and the difference of astigmatism with the rule before and <b>after</b> <b>surgeries</b> was significant(P P > 0. 05). CONCLUSION:The transparent corneal phacoemulsification incision in the cornea astigmatism maximum radial direction can effectively reduce early postoperative astigmatism, but has little effect on long-term corneal astigmatism and visual acuity. If the conditions permit, doctors can create the corneal incision this way. But considering the increased complexity of the surgery, this is little meaningful...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackground. The {{impact of}} echocardiographic-guided {{treatment}} on outcome after tricuspid valve (TV) surgery {{is not well}} defined. Objectives. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine clinical and echocardiographic factors associated with adverse outcomes <b>after</b> TV <b>surgery</b> and determine the role of intraoperative echo (IOE) in facilitating successful outcomes <b>after</b> TV <b>surgery.</b> Methods. Four hundred and one patients (279 females, mean age 60 years) underwent TV surgery and other concomitant cardiac surgery at a single institution and were followed clinically and by echocardiography during a 10 -year period. Results. Decreased survival <b>after</b> TV <b>surgery</b> was associated with: preoperative increased New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification (relative risk [RR] = 2. 02), increased left ventricular dysfunction by echocardiography (RR = 1. 28), and use of a TV replacement strategy (RR = 2. 92). Decreased event-free survival <b>after</b> TV <b>surgery</b> was associated with concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting (RR = 2. 97). Late echocardiographic failure (3 to 4 + tricuspid valve regurgitation [TR]) <b>after</b> TV <b>surgery</b> was associated with increased severity of TR on preoperative echocardiogram (odds ratio [OR] = 1. 91). Decreased late echocardiographic failure <b>after</b> TV <b>surgery</b> was associated with the use of a TV annuloplasty ring with a repair strategy (OR = 0. 40). The surgical plan was altered at the time of surgery to insure a successful outcome in 32 (10 %) of 335 patients based on IOE findings. Conclusions. Adverse outcomes <b>after</b> TV <b>surgery</b> can be predicted by several preoperative clinical and echocardiographic variables. IOE is useful in improving immediate, but not late, outcomes <b>after</b> TV <b>surgery...</b>|$|R
