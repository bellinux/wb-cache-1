2500|$|The {{completion}} of the screenplay, concerned Sparks that Cyrus {{would not be able}} to successfully execute the role: [...] "The first thing I thought when I finished the screenplay was, wow, I hope she can do this, this is a tough role because I'm bringing you through a whole gamut of emotion and you're just a 16-year-old girl who's done the Disney Channel. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>able</b> to do this as an actress?", After visiting the set and watching Cyrus film, Sparks' worries abated. To play the New York teen, Cyrus worked with a dialect coach to lose her Southern accent and learned to play classical piano. After she completed filming, Cyrus said that in a case of life imitating art, she had matured and [...] "changed a lot" [...] over the course of her summer in Georgia, similar to the way Ronnie does in the film. [...] "Showing this movie, I feel like I'm really showing a part of my growth as a person as well. So I'm really excited for people to see it." ...|$|E

[...] He was speaking now in a low and throbbing voice, oblivious of time and space. [...] "I must be something more than physician or friend. I have been saying 'must' to you, but I am, after all, a very strange autocrat. My power is dependent on you." [...] Then, in answer to her questioning eyes, he hurried on: [...] "I love you, dear girl, and if you find you can trust yourself to me, fully, in this way, then I am sure of victory.

6000|$|The saint {{acted with}} the concubinarians almost {{in the same}} manner as our Saviour dealt with the publicans and harlots. Far from {{treating}} them severely, the deeper they were plunged in that darling vice, the more tenderly he seemed to use them. On all occasions he declared himself their friend; he made them frequent visits, without fear of being upbraided with so infamous a conversation. He invited himself sometimes to eat with them; and then, assuming an air of gaiety, he desired the master to bring down the children to bear him company. When he had a little commended their prettiness, he asked to see their mother, and shewed her the same countenance, as if he had taken her for an honest woman. If she were beautiful or well shaped, he praised her, and said [...] "she looked like a Portuguese:" [...] after which; in private conversation, [...] "you have," [...] said he to her master, [...] "a fair slave, who well deserves to be your wife." [...] But if she were a swarthy, ugly Indian, [...] "Good God!" [...] he cried out, [...] "what a monster do you keep within your doors! and how <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>able</b> to endure the sight of her?" [...] Such words, spoken in all appearance without design, had commonly their full effect: the keeper married her whom the saint had commended, and turned off the others.|$|E

6000|$|Ans. This you cannot do by your moral natural {{principles}} of humanity: For {{even some of}} your brave philosophers, whose godliness {{you have so much}} applauded, were even then in the midst of their, and your virtues, atheistically ignorant of the religion of Jesus. And as to the loose Christian; Christ neither hath need of, nor will he bless your blasphemous opinions, nor feigned godliness, but real ungodliness, to make them converts to his faith and grace, neither can it be expected it should, seeing you have not only dirty thoughts, but vilifying words, and sayings of his person, work, and righteousness. you have set your works before his (p. 223), calling them substantial, indispensable, and real; but coming to God by him, a thing in itself indifferent (p. 7-9). You go on, and say, 'Let us declare--that we are not barely reliers on Christ's righteousness, by being imitators of it' (p. 300). You cannot leave off to contemn and blaspheme the Son of God. Do you not yet know that the righteousness of Christ on which the sinner ought to rely for life, is such, as consisted in his standing to, and doing of the law, without a Mediator? And would you be doing this? What know you not, that an essential of the righteousness he accomplished for sinners {{when he was in the}} world; is, 'That he was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born without sin, did all things in the power of, and union with his own eternal Godhead.' And <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>able</b> thus to imitate him? Again, the righteousness on which we ought to rely for life, is that which hath in it the merit of blood: we are 'justified by his blood' through faith in his blood (Rom 5:9). Is this the righteousness you would imitate? Farther, the righteousness on which poor sinners should rely, is that, for the sake of which God forgiveth the sins of him that resteth by faith thereupon. But would you be imitating of, or accomplishing such a righteousness? ...|$|E

If there {{be one of}} those qualities in you, I will give up to you all that you ask."[105] Cæcilius was probably even now in alliance with Verres. He himself, when Quæstor, had robbed the people {{in the collection of the}} corn dues, and was unable therefore to include that matter in his accusation. [...] "You can bring no charge against him on this head, lest it be seen that you were a partner with him in the business."[106] He ridicules him as to his personal insufficiency. [...] "What, Cæcilius! as to those practices of the profession without which an action such as this cannot be carried on, do you think that there is nothing in them? Need there be no skill in the business, no habit of speaking, no familiarity with the Forum, with the judgment-seats, and the laws?"[107] [...] "I know well how difficult the ground is.
