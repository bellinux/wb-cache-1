The authors are investigating the production of narrow energy band X-ray beams with a standard X-ray tube by using Bragg diffraction on mosaic crystals for mammography application. Quasi-monochromatic X-ray beams (ΔE/E~ 0. 1) have been produced in the mammography energy range. Small-field (1. 1 × 3. 0 cm 2) radiographs of a plexiglas phantom 3. 6 cm thick were obtained with 18, 20, and 22 keV quasi-monochromatic beams and a conventional film/screen combination for mammography. Images showed a non-uniformity in the irradiation field. A digital detector was used as imaging system to correct the phantom radiographs for this uneven illumination across the image.

40|$|Purpose: The {{quality of}} a {{radiography}} system is affected by several factors, a major one being the focal spot size of the x-ray tube. In fact, the measurement of such size is recognized to be of primary importance during acceptance tests and image quality evaluations of clinical radiography systems. The most common device providing {{an image of the}} focal spot emission distribution is a pin-hole camera, which requires a high tube loading in order to produce a measurable signal. This work introduces an alternative technique to obtain an image of the focal spot, through the processing of a single radiograph of a simple test object, acquired with a suitable magnification. Methods: The radiograph of a magnified sharp edge is a well-established method to evaluate the extension of the focal spot profile along the direction perpendicular to the edge. From a single radiograph of a circular x-ray absorber, it is possible to extract simultaneously the radial profiles of several sharp edges with different orientations. The authors propose a technique that allows to obtain an image of the focal spot through the processing of these radial profiles by means of a pseudo-CT reconstruction technique. In order to validate this technique, the reconstruction has been applied to the simulated radiographs of an ideal disk-shaped absorber, generated by various simulated focal spot distributions. Furthermore, the method has been applied to the focal spot of a commercially available mammography unit. Results: In the case of simulated radiographs, the results of the reconstructions have been compared to the original distributions, showing an excellent agreement for what regards both the overall distribution and the full width at half maximum measurements. In the case of the experimental test, the method allowed to obtain images of the focal spot that have been compared with the results obtained through standard techniques, namely, pin-hole camera and slit camera. Conclusions: The method was proven to be effective for simulated images and the results of the experimental test suggest that it could be considered as an alternative technique for focal spot distribution evaluation. The method offers the possibility to measure the <b>actual</b> <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> size and emission distribution at the same exposure conditions as clinical routine, avoiding high tube loading {{as in the case of}} the pin-hole imaging technique...|$|E

40|$|The <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> of {{a linear}} {{accelerator}} is often {{considered to have}} a fully stable position. In practice, however, the beam control loop of a linear accelerator needs to stabilize after the beam is turned on. As a result, some motion of the <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> might occur during the start-up phase of irradiation. When acquiring portal images, this motion will affect the projected position of anatomy and field edges, especially when low exposures are used. In this paper, {{the motion of the}} <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> and the effect of this motion on portal image analysis are quantified. A slightly tilted narrow slit phantom was placed at the isocenter of several linear accelerators and images were acquired (3. 5 frames per second) by means of an amorphous silicon flat panel imager positioned approximately 0. 7 m below the isocenter. The motion of the <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> was determined by converting the tilted slit images to subpixel accurate line spread functions. The error in portal image analysis due to <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> motionwas estimated by a subtraction of the relative displacement of the projected slit from the relative displacement of the field edges.

40|$|Purpose: The goal of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} a new method based on a coded aperture mask combined with a digital x-ray imaging detector for measurements of the <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> sizes of diagnostic x-ray tubes. Common techniques for <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> size measurements employ a pinhole camera, a slit camera, or a star resolution pattern. The coded aperture mask is a radiation collimator consisting of a large number of apertures disposed on a predetermined grid in an array, through which the radiation source is imaged onto a digital x-ray detector. The method of the coded mask camera allows one to obtain a one-shot accurate and direct measurement of the two dimensions of the <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> (like that for a pinhole camera) but at a low tube loading (like that for a slit camera). A large number of small apertures in the coded mask operate as a ???multipinhole??? with greater efficiency than a single pinhole, but keeping the resolution of a single pinhole. Methods: X-ray images result from the multiplexed output on the detector image plane of such a multiple aperture array, and the image of the source is digitally reconstructed with a deconvolution algorithm. Images of the <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> of a laboratory x-ray tube (W anode: 35 ??? 80 kVp; <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> size of 0. 04 mm) were acquired at different geometrical magnifications with two different types of digital detector (a photon counting hybrid silicon pixel detector with 0. 055 mm pitch and a flat panel CMOS digital detector with 0. 05 mm pitch) using a high resolution coded mask (type no-two-holes-touching modified uniformly redundant array) with 480 0. 07 mm apertures, designed for imaging at energies below 35 keV. Measurements with a slit camera were performed for comparison. A test with a pinhole camera and with the coded mask on a computed radiography mammography unit with 0. 3 mm <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> was also carried out. Results: The full width at half maximum <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> sizes were obtained from the line profiles of the decoded images, showing a <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> of 0. 120 ???mm× 0. 105 ???mm at 35 kVp and M = 6. 1, with a detector entrance exposure as low as 1. 82 mR (0. 125 mA???s tube load). The slit camera indicated a <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> of 0. 112 ???mm× 0. 104 ???mm at 35 kVp and M = 3. 15, with an exposure at the detector of 72 mR. <b>Focal</b> <b>spot</b> measurements with the coded mask could be performed up to 80 kVp.

In order to increase the peak intensity at the <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> {{it is possible to}} either increase the pulse energy, to reduce the pulse length or to make the <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> smaller.

The aim for this project was to investigate the abilities of an adaptive optics system to precompensate for alignment or intrinsic optical errors that would degrade the focusing power of the laser system. A test system, using a smaller deformable mirror than required for the main laser system was developed and implemented by the author and comprise a deformable mirror, a detection system and an optimization algorithm. The deformable mirror was a Micromachined Membrane Deformable Mirror (MMDM), it had 37 electrostatic actuators and was coated with gold.

By controlling, the electron emitter location at the nanoscale, coarse control over the position of the electron beam, and subsequent X-ray beam are possible. A range of focussing techniques has also been developed to reduce the electron beam <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> size. Standard X-ray tubes have a <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> size of typically around 1  mm diameter. For greater spatial resolution, “mini-focus” X-ray tubes have been developed, with a spot size down to 50  μm, as well as “micro focus” X-ray tubes with a spot size of ~ 5  μm [227]. Almost exclusively, X-ray sources with effective <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> sizes of < 10  μm, which are commercially available, employ electrostatic or magnetic focussing and require high beam current pulsing techniques, to prevent limitation in their imaging resolution by motion-induced blurring [206]. The size of the electron beam at its source and latterly as it impacts the target material, contributes, in part, {{to the size of the}} X-ray <b>focal</b> <b>spot,</b> which itself impacts on the resolution of the resultant X-ray image. A large electron beam <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> will create a penumbra effect where the X-ray spot subtends a significant angle at the subject; this blurs the resultant image. Conventional X-ray tubes will use a lensing cup around the heated filament assembly. This, to a first order, electrostatically focuses the electrons onto the centre of the anode. Careful design of the cathode and supporting electrostatic lenses will minimise the size of the <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> [228, 229]. Additionally, further electrostatic rings or focussing coils may also be employed to redirect the flow of electrons emanating from the cathode, to further reduce the spot size, where the <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> size is determined by measuring the Point Spread Function using standard methods [230].|$|R

This extra-cavity phase filtering method is set-up {{in the frame of}} femtosecond micromachining processes. Various <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> shapes are demonstrated together with drilling and marking results in metals and dielectrics. Photowriting of waveguides in bulk fused silica is also presented...|$|R
40|$|A {{distributed}} {{phase plate}} (DPP) {{is designed for}} the: University of Rochester Laboratory for Laser Energetics OMEGA laser system that can, manipulate the <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> size during a three-nanosecond pulse. These hybrid full aperture diffractive elements alter the <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> size to match the diameter of an imploding target. When implemented in the OMEGA system, these DPPs will greatly increase on-target energy efficiency in direct drive experiments. The OMEGA'S current <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> diameter is unchanging during the beam pulse. Because of this, much of the energy misses the target after it shrinks from implosion. The newly modified DPPs {{have the ability to}} dynamically control the <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> diameter on target to account for an imploding target. Simulated illumination shows that the new DPPs increase the late pulse percent intensity on-target from 27. 5 % to 73. 4 %. They also produce an azimuthally symmetric and super-Gaussian intensity profile to maintain reasonable irradiation uniformity. Page I 2...|$|R
40|$|As Weiss et. al. {{demonstrated}} [1] {{the movement}} of the <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> of a microfocus X-ray source during the CT scan significantly influences the results of the CT scan and of dimensional measurements derived from such a scan. Fröba et. al. [2] showed the effects of thermal extension and summarized the requirements for microfocus X-ray tubes used in long term CT scan. In this paper the <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> movement of an X-ray source with a newly developed internal cooling is discussed. Furthermore the results are compared with previous results [4] obtained with an external cooling module. To analyse the net effect of controlling the <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> movement a simulation study is performed. It starts with the simulation of projections by using the aRTist software of German BAM. In the next step the new TomoSynth software allows to simulate {{the movement of}} the <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> during the scan. This software was recently introduced by Bellon et. al. [3].

40|$|Unsharpness in {{the image}} may reduce the {{visibility}} of details. Magnification is often required to achieve a spatial resolution similar to film technique, when using digital systems. A part of the unsharpness results from the <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> size. To determine the effective <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> size, thousands of images with different tubes, energies, magnifications and IQIs from different EN and ASTM standards were taken to evaluate {{the influence of the}} unsharpness in the digital image due to the <b>focal</b> <b>spot.</b> This leads to reference values for the effective <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> size of the different tubes. These reference values were compared with the values of the pin hole camera images according to EN 12543 - 2 and they deviated significantly. Several modifications of the evaluation method were proposed and a method with Integrated Line Profiles which produces results like an edge profile method was developed and tested providing similar results as the reference values. A second more simple method for end-users was introduced based on the evaluation of Penetrameter hole edges. A proposed update of the standards for <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> measurements in ASTM and ISO is introduced. New classes will help the users to identify more simple and reliable the X-ray tube for their application...|$|R

40|$|Time-reversal is {{a method}} of {{focusing}} sound in the ocean that has found a variety of applications in recent years, ranging from underwater communications to biological stone destruction. In order to produce a <b>focal</b> <b>spot,</b> the time- reversal process first needs to acquire the Green's function between source and receiver. This Green's function is time-reversed and retransmitted {{in order to produce}} a spatio-temporal <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> at the original source location. If the medium properties in between the source and receiver change between the acquisition of the Green's function and the subsequent retransmission, the quality of the <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> can degrade or even disappear. However, the time-reversal <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> {{has been found to be}} surprisingly robust to changes in medium properties, which are chiefly sound speed fluctuations in underwater acoustics. At 445 Hz, the <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> was seen to persist for a week, while at 3. 5 kHz, the <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> persists for about an hour. Sensitivity kernels have the ability to linearly map sound speed perturbations to a perturbation of an acoustic parameter such as travel-time or pressure. Sensitivity kernels have a Fresnel-like interference pattern with regions of positive and negative sensitivities in the medium. Time-reversal, which causes different arrival paths to arrive at the same time, results in overlapping sensitivity kernels that leads to a net reduction in pressure sensitivity at the <b>focal</b> <b>spot.</b> Upon expressing the pressure at the <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> in terms of sensitivity kernels, source transmissions are derived that are even more robust than time-reversal. The theory developed using pressure sensitivity kernels is tested on experimental data, along with an internal wave model, using various metrics. The linear limitations of the kernels are explored in the context of time-evolving Green's functions. The optimized source functions are then tested using experimental Green's functions and their behavior is seen to be in the right sense. Finally, thermistor chain data gathered during a similar experiment allowed for the testing of a 'synthetic aperture thermistor chain'. Temperature observations, presumably caused by displacements of a reference temperature profile, are inverted to provide an estimate of the background temperature profile...|$|R
