25|$|On 11 November 2009, Sivarak Chutipong {{was arrested}} by Cambodian police for passing the {{confidential}} flight plans of Thaksin and Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen to Kamrob Palawatwichai, First Secretary of the Royal Thai Embassy in Cambodia. Sivarak was a Thai engineer working in Cambodia for Cambodia <b>Air</b> <b>Traffic</b> <b>Service,</b> the private firm which manages air traffic control in Cambodia. Sivarak denied {{that he was a}} spy, and the Thai government claimed that he was innocent and that the incident was a Thaksin/Cambodian plot to further damage relations between the two countries. The Thai First Secretary was expelled from Cambodia. Sivarak demanded that former First Secretary Kamrob speak out and restore his damaged reputation by confirming he was not involved in a spy ring. Kamrob refused to provide comment to the press throughout the controversy, and Kasit's secretary, Chavanond Intarakomalyasut, insisted that although that there was no misconduct {{on the part of the}} First Secretary or Sivarak, there would be no statement from Kamrob. Sivarak's mother appeared often on Thai television, pleading for the government to assist her son.|$|E

Vehicles, in this matter aircraft {{as a tool of}} transportation, have a global characteristic because of the high speed and wide range capability compare to vehicles of any other transportation mode. An airway is a flight lane in air space. Every aircraft, which pass the airways, has the right of <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>services.</b> The authority provision of giving the <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>services</b> Internationally is provided in Annex 11 to the Convention on Civil Aviation about <b>Air</b> <b>Traffic</b> <b>Services.</b> The authority mentioned above includes responsibility to provide <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>services</b> in <b>air</b> space above the territory, which the state has its jurisdiction and responsibility to the aerodrome where the <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>services</b> are given.

In June 2005, Sustainable Aviation; a joint initiative involving a number of UK airlines, airports, manufacturers and the <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>service</b> provider NATS, was launched with a vision statement relating to environmental issues of [...] "…removing or minimising any negative impacts on the local and global environment…".

These are however long term aspirations, and whilst progress is being made in engine development, the more immediate efforts of Sustainable Aviation to address climate change are directed towards supporting research, common reporting of emissions, emissions trading, and personal offsetting.|$|E
