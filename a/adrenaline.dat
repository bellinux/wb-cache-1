5|$|<b>Adrenaline</b> and {{noradrenaline}} are catecholamines, water-soluble {{compounds that}} have a structure made of a catechol group and an amine group. The adrenal glands are {{responsible for most of}} the <b>adrenaline</b> that circulates in the body, but only for a small amount of circulating noradrenaline. These hormones are released by the adrenal medulla, which contains a dense network of blood vessels. <b>Adrenaline</b> and noradrenaline act at adrenoreceptors throughout the body, with effects that include an increase in blood pressure and heart rate. The actions of <b>adrenaline</b> and noradrenaline are responsible for the fight or flight response, characterised by a quickening of breathing and heart rate, an increase in blood pressure, and constriction of blood vessels {{in many parts of the}} body.|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal medulla}} {{is at the}} centre of each adrenal gland, and is {{surrounded}} by the adrenal cortex. The chromaffin cells of the medulla are the body's main source of the catecholamines <b>adrenaline</b> and noradrenaline, released by the medulla. Approximately 20% noradrenaline (norepinephrine) and 80% <b>adrenaline</b> (epinephrine) are secreted here.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, a {{new theory}} {{surfaced}} after the newspaper Crónica spoke to the police about {{the cause of the}} accident. The police source mentioned the possibility that Rodrigo's intensive routine might have increased the production of <b>adrenaline</b> in his body. The investigators explained that, if Rodrigo did not release the excess <b>adrenaline</b> through urination after his last concert, he could have lost his sense of distance in relation to Pesquera's Blazer. This could have caused Rodrigo to apply the brake and turn the wheel violently.|$|E

5|$|Exercise also {{increases}} the respiratory rate, partly {{in response to}} the movement of the limbs detected by proprioceptors in the muscles and joints, an increase in body temperature, the release of <b>adrenaline</b> (epinephrine) from the adrenal glands, and from motor impulses originating from the cerebral cortex.|$|E
5|$|For {{six weeks}} from 28 September, Jones {{presented}} a programme for Virgin 1 entitled Gethin Jones' Danger Hunters, which featured <b>adrenaline</b> junkies and {{their search for}} the ultimate thrill.

5|$|The {{adrenal glands}} (also known as suprarenal glands) are {{endocrine}} glands that produce {{a variety of}} hormones including <b>adrenaline</b> and the steroids aldosterone and cortisol. They are found above the kidneys. Each gland has an outer cortex which produces steroid hormones and an inner medulla. The adrenal cortex itself {{is divided into three}} zones: zona glomerulosa, the zona fasciculata and the zona reticularis.|$|E
5|$|The {{clinical}} {{state of}} DKA is associated, {{in addition to}} the above, with the release of various counterregulatory hormones such as glucagon and <b>adrenaline</b> as well as cytokines, the latter of which leads to increased markers of inflammation, {{even in the absence of}} infection.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} excess thyroid hormone {{typically}} {{respond to the}} administration of a non-selective beta blocker, such as propranolol (as most of the symptoms are driven by increased levels of <b>adrenaline</b> {{and its effect on}} the β-adrenergic receptors). Subsequent attacks may be prevented by avoiding known precipitants, such as high salt or carbohydrate intake, until the thyroid disease has been adequately treated.|$|E

5|$|The {{multiplayer}} side of Mysteries of the Sith {{was received}} positively, {{but did not}} completely escape criticism. Emil Pagliarulo of The <b>Adrenaline</b> Vault questioned why certain features seemed to be missing from the multiplayer mode that {{were present in the}} single-player mode. One such feature is the rancor which appears prominently in a single-player level but is not in any multiplayer maps.|$|E
5|$|On February 13, 2014, {{the band}} {{announced}} the track list and title of their album to be Blood for Blood, released on June 10. It was also announced that guitarist Greg Tribbett and bassist Bob Kakaha have departed the band, and were shortly replaced by Christian Brady (Magna-Fi/Überschall) on guitar and (Skrew/Bloodsimple/MonstrO) bassist Kyle Sanders (brother of Troy Sanders of Mastodon). Hellyeah and <b>Adrenaline</b> Mob have announced a few tour dates together. On June 3, the full album {{was available for}} streaming via YouTube.|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal glands}} are {{composed}} of two heterogenous types of tissue. In the center is the adrenal medulla, which produces <b>adrenaline</b> and noradrenaline and releases them into the bloodstream, {{as part of the}} sympathetic nervous system. Surrounding the medulla is the cortex, which produces a variety of steroid hormones. These tissues come from different embryological precursors and have distinct prenatal development paths. The cortex of the adrenal gland is derived from mesoderm, whereas the medulla is derived from the neural crest, which is of ectodermal origin.|$|E

5|$|By then, Lincoln {{has broken}} {{out of the}} cold locker and called for backup. Frank rushes Fauxlivia to a {{hospital}} while Lincoln interrogates Dr. Silva. Dr. Silva reveals he was the last host, and implores Lincoln to remember his name as he extracts the live queen beetle from his body and dies. Meanwhile, Frank discovers Fauxlivia is pregnant; the <b>adrenaline</b> had induced morning sickness symptoms. At the hospital, the fetus is found to be six weeks old. Frank realizes he was away at that time, accuses Fauxlivia of sleeping with another man, and leaves her. Fauxlivia cries to herself, realizing her child's father is Peter (Joshua Jackson) from her time in the prime universe.|$|E
5|$|Dopamine {{was first}} {{synthesized}} in 1910 by George Barger and James Ewens at Wellcome Laboratories in London, England and first {{identified in the}} human brain by Kathleen Montagu in 1957. It was named dopamine {{because it is a}} monoamine whose precursor in the Barger-Ewens synthesis is 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (levodopa or L-DOPA). Dopamine's function as a neurotransmitter was first recognized in 1958 by Arvid Carlsson and Nils-Åke Hillarp at the Laboratory for Chemical Pharmacology of the National Heart Institute of Sweden. Carlsson was awarded the 2000 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for showing that dopamine is not only a precursor of norepinephrine (noradrenaline) and epinephrine (<b>adrenaline),</b> but is also itself a neurotransmitter.|$|E
5|$|Emergency {{treatment}} {{is needed in}} a case of a severe allergic reaction. Before calling for help, laying a person down and elevating the legs is suggested. Depending on a patients needs, they will be given an EpiPen or an Anapen to use in case they are stung. In a scenario of experiencing anaphylaxis, further doses of <b>adrenaline</b> and intravenous infusions may be required. Some with severe anaphylaxis may suffer cardiac arrest and will need resuscitation. Inhalers may additionally be used in case a victim has asthma and experiences a reaction from a sting. The use of ACE inhibitors is not recommended, as it is known to increase the risk of anaphylaxis. Medications like antihistamines, H2 blockers, corticosteroids and anti-leukotrienes have no effect on anaphylaxis.|$|E
