5|$|After {{retiring}} from football, Gatski was a scout for the Boston Patriots {{for two years}} before becoming head football coach and athletic director at the West Virginia Industrial School for Boys, a correctional facility for young offenders in Pruntytown, West Virginia. He worked there until the school shut down in 1982. He hunted and fished in retirement, and was often difficult to reach. He lived on a mountain in West Virginia <b>and</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> a telephone for many years.|$|E
5|$|After the Second World War, {{there was}} a large {{increase}} in the number of gangs in Sophiatown. Part of the reason for this was that there were about 20000 African teenagers in the city who were not at school <b>and</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> jobs. Township youths were unable to find jobs easily. Employers were reluctant to employ teenagers as they did not have any work experience, and many of them were not able to read or write. They also considered them to be undisciplined and weak.|$|E
5|$|After {{the defeat}} of the ARVN 7th Airborne Battalion, U.S. General William Westmoreland {{concluded}} that the Viet Cong still had the strength to continue the attacks on Đồng Xoài. In contrast, South Vietnamese forces within the vicinity of Đồng Xoài were severely depleted, <b>and</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> sufficient strength to defeat the Viet Cong. Furthermore, there was only one remaining battalion in South Vietnam’s strategic reserve, and it {{may not be enough to}} drive the Communist out from the area if it was committed.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} August 1915, about 150 Armenians with Russian {{citizenship}} were deported from Constantinople to holding centers. A few of the detained, including writer Alexander Panossian (1859–1919), {{were released}} the same weekend before even being transferred to Anatolia. In total, {{it is estimated that}} 2,345 Armenian notables were detained and eventually deported, most of whom were not nationalists <b>and</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> any political affiliations.|$|E
5|$|Karl {{holds the}} record for the northernmost {{formation}} of a November tropical or subtropical cyclone in the Atlantic Ocean. It also attained hurricane strength at an unusual latitude, and contributed {{to one of the most}} active Novembers on record in terms of tropical cyclones. However, it stayed over open waters <b>and</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> any effects on land. It was the 11th named storm of the season, and due to the lack of damage, its name was not retired.|$|E

5|$|Pellerin was {{originally}} scheduled {{to fly in}} this mission, {{as he had done}} on the 17 June flight. Pellerin was unavailable for the flight on 24 June and Wolff was selected as the replacement aircrew member. Due to the short notice of his assignment to the mission, Wolff did not participate in the pre-flight briefing and boarded the aircraft after the engines were started. Thus, Wolff was not aware of the planned mission profile <b>and</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> an opportunity to raise any objections before take-off.|$|E
5|$|The Victory Tests {{started in}} May 1945 between the Australian Services and England {{in celebration of}} the allied victory in Europe. In {{previous}} seasons, the English cricket administrator and former captain Pelham Warner had organised matches between the RAAF and various English military teams {{as an expression of}} defiance against Nazi air raids, and the Victory Tests were a continuation of this, although the matches were only three days long <b>and</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> Test status.|$|E
5|$|The {{destinations}} in Asia {{were served}} from 1949 to 1954. Then, Braathens became a domestic airline, <b>and</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> international scheduled services again until 1987, except during part of 1960. From 1994, the airline market was deregulated, and Braathens {{was free to}} operate domestically and within the European Economic Area. In 1997, it bought Transwede and started domestic services in Sweden, but these were terminated in 1999. The company merged with the Norwegian division of Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) in 2004 to create SAS Braathens.|$|E

5|$|An {{exception}} {{was made for}} Christians to participate in Christmas ceremonies in Bethlehem. Some sources claim Jews could only visit the wall if they traveled through Jordan (which {{was not an option}} for Israelis) <b>and</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> an Israeli visa stamped in their passports. Only Jordanian soldiers and tourists were to be found there. A vantage point on Mount Zion, from which the Wall could be viewed, became the place where Jews gathered to pray. For thousands of pilgrims, the mount, being the closest location to the Wall under Israeli control, became a substitute site for the traditional priestly blessing ceremony which takes place on the Three Pilgrimage Festivals.|$|E
5|$|Archives {{show the}} village's All Saints' Church dates to around 1350. In the early 15th century, Quex Park manor house—named after the park's second owner, John Quek—was built {{just south of}} the village. The {{ownership}} of the manor passed to various families until 1770 when it was acquired by the present owners, the Powell family. In the late 17th century, the house was visited by King William III. In 1565, a report on the coast of Thanet by the commissioners of Queen Elizabeth I stated that Birchington had 42 houses <b>and</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> an active port. Before the 19th century, the village coastline was frequented by smugglers, leading to skirmishes between them and excise officers. Several of the older houses in the village contain cellars and bricked up tunnels, once used for storing contraband.|$|E
5|$|Benicio del Toro as Fred Fenster. Spacey {{suggested}} del Toro for the role. The {{character was}} originally written with a Harry Dean Stanton-type actor in mind. Del Toro met with Singer and the film's casting director {{and told them}} {{that he did not want}} to audition because he did not feel comfortable doing them. After reading the script, del Toro realized that his character's only purpose was to be killed to demonstrate Söze's power, <b>and</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> any meaningful impact on the story. As a result, del Toro developed Fenster's unique, garbled speech pattern to make him more memorable as a character.|$|E

5|$|Blonde {{remained}} with the 4th Battle Squadron through 1916, {{although she was}} detached for several months mid year. She had been transferred to the 1st Battle Squadron by April 1917 and was converted into a minelayer later in the year, although she never laid any mines in combat. Similarly, Blanche {{remained with}} the 3rd Battle Squadron until January 1916 when she joined her sister in the 4th Battle Squadron. The ship participated in the Battle of Jutland, but was on the unengaged side of the fleet <b>and</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> the opportunity to fire at the Germans. She was detached from the 4th Battle Squadron {{at the beginning of}} 1917, presumably to be converted into a minelayer. Blanche was assigned to the 5th Battle Squadron by April and laid some mines {{at the entrance to the}} Kattegat in February 1918.|$|E
5|$|During early 1942, Gens became {{involved}} in a power struggle {{with the head of}} the Judenrat, Anatol Friend. Friend had not been involved in Vilnius' Jewish organizations prior to the German invasion, <b>and</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> much support from the ghetto's inhabitants. Gens was viewed favorably by the ghetto residents, partly because he lived in the ghetto when he could have escaped. Over time, Gens and the police force encroached on the functions of the Judenrat. The Germans backed Gens' efforts to secure more power, and implied that he was not responsible to the Judenrat, and that the Judenrat had no power over Gens or the Jewish policemen.|$|E
5|$|Eusebius {{notes that}} this event marked the {{beginning}} of a temporary respite from persecution. Although the precise dating of this respite is not specifically noted by Eusebius, the text of the Martyrs records no Palestinian martyrs between July 25, 308 and November 13, 309. The political climate probably impinged on persecutory policy here: This was the period of the conference of Carnuntum, which met in November 308. Maximinus probably spent the next few months in discussion with Galerius over his role in the imperial government, <b>and</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> the time to deal with the Christians.|$|E

5|$|Kartik then {{played in}} one Test against Bangladesh and Zimbabwe {{respectively}} in India, taking match totals of 1/42 and 2/66. He scored 43 in the nine-wicket win over Bangladesh {{but was not}} required to bat in the seven-wicket win over Zimbabwe. New captain Sourav Ganguly—who had taken over after Sachin Tendulkar resigned following the South African whitewash—did not show much confidence in him, by only affording him frequent but short spells. Kartik was dropped from the team after the First Test against Zimbabwe, <b>and</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> an opportunity to immediately prove his captain wrong, as the one-day domestic circuit was in progress at the time. Kartik took nine wickets at 25.22 at an economy rate of 4.02, and then {{had a chance to}} stake his claims for a Test recall in the Duleep Trophy.|$|E
5|$|The next year, Luo {{and colleagues}} {{published}} {{a more thorough}} analysis confirming their previous conclusion and adding the Cretaceous Australian Bishops to Australosphenida. They mentioned {{the condition of the}} hypoconulid, which is inclined forward, rather than backward as in boreosphenidans, as an additional australosphenidan character and noted that Ausktribosphenos and monotremes were united, to the exclusion of Ambondro, by the presence of a V-shaped notch in the distal metacristid. In the same year, Asfaltomylos was described from the Jurassic of Argentina as another australosphenidan. In contrast to Ambondro, this animal lacked a distal metacristid <b>and</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> as well-developed a lingual cingulum.|$|E
5|$|Until the mid-20th century, the Charolais {{and other}} demi-sang breeds, {{such as the}} Angevin, the Charentais, the Cheval Limousin and the Vendéen, were {{generally}} known {{by the name of}} the region in which they existed, <b>and</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> individual breed studbooks. As these horses were not separated by breed type, but instead by geography, there were no significant physical characteristics that distinguished the Charolais from other demi-sang types that developed prior to the mid-19th century. Charolais horses were primarily raised in what is now the Saône-et-Loire department. The areas of Cluny, Charolles, Blanzy, Paray-le-Monial and Digoin were preferred for breeding, due to the clay-limestone soils that favored the development of the equine skeletal structure.|$|E
