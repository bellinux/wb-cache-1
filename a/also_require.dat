2500|$|The Act <b>also</b> <b>requires</b> the {{development}} of a transport plan for Victoria and requires that the plan be periodically revised. [...] It <b>also</b> <b>requires</b> transport agencies regulated by the Act to prepare corporate plans and to coordinate them with the central Department of Transport and other affected transport agencies.|$|R
5|$|A variant on {{this design}} {{is the use}} of arrays, whose tilt angle can be {{adjusted}} twice or four times annually to optimise seasonal output. They <b>also</b> <b>require</b> more land area to reduce internal shading at the steeper winter tilt angle. Because the increased output is typically only a few percent, it seldom justifies the increased cost and complexity of this design.|$|E
5|$|Chopin's polonaises show {{a marked}} advance on {{those of his}} Polish {{predecessors}} in the form (who included his teachers Zywny and Elsner). As with the traditional polonaise, Chopin's works are in triple time and typically display a martial rhythm in their melodies, accompaniments and cadences. Unlike most of their precursors, they <b>also</b> <b>require</b> a formidable playing technique.|$|E
5|$|Many {{species of}} sundews are self-fertile; their flowers will often self-pollinate upon closing. Often, {{numerous}} seeds are produced. The tiny black seeds germinate {{in response to}} moisture and light, while seeds of temperate species <b>also</b> <b>require</b> cold, damp, stratification to germinate. Seeds of the tuberous species require a hot, dry summer period followed by a cool, moist winter to germinate.|$|E

5|$|On the {{successful}} completion of a PLTU course a Scout is entitled to wear a PLTU woggle (which is made by the Scout while on the course) and to wear a special PLTU badge on their uniform. Many Troops <b>also</b> <b>require</b> a Scout to complete a PLTU course before allowing them to become a Patrol Leader.|$|E
5|$|Some devices, when {{plugged into}} {{charging}} ports, draw even more power (10watts at 2.1amperes) than the Battery Charging Specification allows — The iPad {{is one such}} device. Barnes & Noble NOOK Color devices <b>also</b> <b>require</b> a special charger that runs at 1.9amperes.|$|E
5|$|A {{binary search}} tree is a binary tree data {{structure}} that works {{based on the principle}} of binary search. The records of the tree are arranged in sorted order, and each record in the tree can be searched using an algorithm similar to binary search, taking on average logarithmic time. Insertion and deletion <b>also</b> <b>require</b> on average logarithmic time in {{binary search tree}}s. This can faster than the linear time insertion and deletion of sorted arrays, and binary trees retain the ability to perform all the operations possible on a sorted array, including range and approximate queries.|$|E

5|$|Air {{travel is}} {{discouraged}} {{for up to}} seven days after complete resolution of a pneumothorax if recurrence does not occur. Underwater diving is considered unsafe after an episode of pneumothorax unless a preventative procedure has been performed. Professional guidelines suggest that pleurectomy be performed on both lungs and that lung function tests and CT scan normalize before diving is resumed. Aircraft pilots may <b>also</b> <b>require</b> assessment for surgery.|$|E
5|$|At {{the local}} {{sectional}} level, a section {{is run by}} a Scout Leader, who is in overall charge of the section, and by Assistant Scout Leaders, who assist the Leader in their role. These roles are uniformed and <b>also</b> <b>require</b> training to achieve their Wood Badge, although their training content consists of the basic values of the association, safety and child protection, inclusion, camping and Scout skills and administration. They are also required to complete First Aid every three years.|$|E
5|$|Communication {{partners}} may <b>also</b> <b>require</b> {{training to}} notice and consistently interpret the communication signals of a severely disabled individual, particularly {{because there is}} a danger that learned helplessness can be the result of repeated failure to communicate successfully. Parties may need assistance to avoid the directive communication style that can lead a child user of AAC not to develop a full range of communication skills such as initiating or taking the lead in conversation, using complex syntax, asking questions, making commands or adding new information.|$|E

5|$|Cultivation {{requirements}} {{vary greatly}} by species. In general, though, sundews require high environmental moisture content, {{usually in the}} form of a constantly moist or wet soil substrate. Most species <b>also</b> <b>require</b> this water to be pure, as nutrients, salts, or minerals in their soil can stunt their growth or even kill them. Commonly, plants are grown in a soil substrate containing some combination of dead or live sphagnum moss, sphagnum peat moss, sand, and/or perlite, and are watered with distilled, reverse osmosis, or rain water.|$|E
5|$|Full {{meetings}} of the Privy Council are held only when the reigning sovereign announces {{his or her own}} engagement (which last happened on 23 November 1839, in the reign of Queen Victoria); or when there is a demise of the Crown, either by the death or abdication of the monarch. A full meeting of the Privy Council was also held on 6 February 1811, when George, Prince of Wales was sworn in as Prince Regent by Act of Parliament. The current statutes regulating the establishment of a regency in the case of minority or incapacity of the sovereign <b>also</b> <b>require</b> any regents to swear their oaths before the Privy Council.|$|E
5|$|The two {{components}} of the proton-motive force are thermodynamically equivalent: In mitochondria, the largest part of energy {{is provided by the}} potential; in alkaliphile bacteria the electrical energy even has to compensate for a counteracting inverse pH difference. Inversely, chloroplasts operate mainly on ΔpH. However, they <b>also</b> <b>require</b> a small membrane potential for the kinetics of ATP synthesis. In the case of the fusobacterium Propionigenium modestum it drives the counter-rotation of subunits a and c of the FO motor of ATP synthase.|$|E

5|$|To {{operate on}} these lines would require new or heavily {{modified}} rolling stock designed {{to operate at}} these different voltages, {{in addition to those}} already in use. Signalling systems also differ. In addition to the infrastructure difficulties, any potential Eurostar services beyond Paris and Brussels would <b>also</b> <b>require</b> the installation of stringent security measures, due to the UK's not having signed up to the Schengen Agreement, which allows unrestricted movement across borders of member countries.|$|E
5|$|A {{regional}} {{transit authority}} {{was formed in}} the early 1990s to build and operate a light rail system that would use the bus tunnel within Downtown Seattle. The authority, later named Sound Transit, gained voter approval in November 1996 to build a $3.9billion system between Seattle–Tacoma International Airport, Downtown Seattle, and the University District. In 1998, Sound Transit found that the rails in the tunnel {{would need to be}} replaced at a cost of up to $110 million and require a full closure for two years. The plan would <b>also</b> <b>require</b> the purchase of new hybrid electric buses to replace the Breda fleet, as the electrical systems were incompatible. Convention Place station would have to be abandoned as it was too shallow to support a northern extension under Interstate 5.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{cross-sections}} {{of these}} fusion-evaporation reactions increase with the asymmetry of the reaction, titanium {{would be a}} better projectile than chromium for the synthesis of element 121. This necessitates an einsteinium target, since titanium has 22 protons and the remaining 99 must be supplied by the target, and einsteinium is element 99. This poses severe challenges due to the significant heating and damage of the target due to the high radioactivity of einsteinium-254, but it would probably be the most promising approach to element 119 with 48Ca beams and possibly element 121 with 50Ti beams. It would <b>also</b> <b>require</b> working on a smaller scale due to the lower amount of 254Es that can be produced. This small-scale work could in the near future only be carried out in Dubna's SHE-factory.|$|E
