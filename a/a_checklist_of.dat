She wrote that: [...] "Beyoncé's body becomes its undeniable emblem. Tom Moon of The Philadelphia Inquirer wrote that Beyoncé shakes every inch of her famously photogenic goddess frame." [...] The music video won three awards at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards in the categories of Best Female Video, Best R Video, and Best Choreography. It however lost to Good Charlottes [...] "Lifestyles of the Rich & Famous" [...] in the Viewer's Choice category.

500|$|The {{second book}} {{to use the}} name Unearthed Arcana was written by Andy Collins, Jesse Decker, David Noonan, and Rich Redman, and {{published}} in February 2004 by Wizards of the Coast, for use with the Dungeons & Dragons third edition rules. Cover art was by Matt Cavotta, with interior art by Steven Belledin, Ed Cox, Wayne England, Emily Fiegenschuh, David Hudnut, Jeremy Jarvis, Doug Kovacs, John and Laura Lakey, David Martin, Dennis Crabapple McClain, Mark Nelson, James Pavelec, Steve Prescott, David Roach, Richard Sardinha, Ron Spencer, Stephen Tappin, Joel Thomas, and Ben Thompson. The designers aimed the book at experienced players and DMs looking for something new, encouraging them to customize the game's rules. The designers {{did not want the}} third edition book to be like the original Unearthed Arcana mechanically, because according to Andy Collins: [...] "Every book on the market looks like the original Unearthed Arcana. New classes, new spells, new magic items - that's the default [...] "recipe" [...] for a d20 product these days. We saw no need to do that with this book." [...] Where the original Unearthed Arcana had simply expanded the rules and options of the core game, this 224-page supplement was aimed at providing an extensive list of variant rules and options to change the standard game itself. The volume of options added was intentionally excessive; according to the designers, a Dungeon Master who reads the book must be prepared to [...] "Drink from the fire hose" [...] and to think before using options that may radically imbalance the game. [...] The book ends with <b>a</b> <b>checklist</b> <b>of</b> the included variants, preceded by a short chapter discussing ways of transitioning among multiple games using different rulesets (one of which explicitly emulates the [...] "Eternal Champion" [...] stories of Michael Moorcock).|$|E

Alex Macpherson of Fact called the album [...] "occasionally transcendent" [...] and commented that it [...] "aims more to be a well-rounded work than a visionary one, and in that respect it succeeds admirably." ...|$|E
