500|$|The Marcellus Formation, a shale rich {{in natural}} gas, lies {{thousands}} of feet below Worlds End State Park and much of Pennsylvania. As of June 30, 2012, there were 127 <b>active</b> <b>gas</b> wells in Sullivan County, with 14 of those in Forks or Shrewsbury Townships. The state did not purchase the mineral rights {{to much of the}} land it owns. Energy company Anadarko has [...] "reportedly purchased 50 percent of the mineral rights under the [...] state forest", and plans to drill in it. About 80 percent of the mineral rights to its state parks are not owned by Pennsylvania, and the owner of Worlds End State Park's mineral rights is unknown. According to William Kocher, Worlds End's manager, [...] "if the owner decided to drill ... the state would have no right to say no." [...] Natural gas pipeline construction upstream of the park spilled a [...] "significant amount" [...] of sediment and mud into Loyalsock Creek in September 2012.|$|E
2500|$|The {{reliance}} on untreated well {{water in the}} rural regions of the Marcellus shale play leaves communities at a strong disadvantage if aquifer contamination would occur. [...] It {{has been found that}} methane concentrations in well water within one kilometer from an <b>active</b> <b>gas</b> well were 17 times higher than in those outside of <b>active</b> <b>gas</b> production area. Produced water includes naturally occurring radioactive materials, as wells as high levels of brine, barium, strontium, and radium. At high exposure levels, these contaminants have been shown to cause skin rashes, nausea, abdominal pain, breathing difficulties, headaches, dizziness, eye irritations, throat irritations, and nosebleeds. Residents are also exposed to a myriad of air pollutants through mechanisms such well venting and flaring. Volatile organic compounds, diesel particulate matter, and methane are found in elevated levels around producing wells, often in concentrations that exceed EPA guidelines for carcinogenic health risks. Unfortunately, there have been no studies to try and quantify the cumulative impacts of multiple low dose exposures.|$|E

2500|$|Plasma-assisted {{ferritic}} nitrocarburizing is {{also known}} as ion nitriding, plasma ion nitriding or glow-discharge nitriding. The process works to achieve the same result as the salt bath and gaseous process, except the reactivity of the media is not due to the temperature but to the gas ionized state. In this technique intense electric fields are used to generate ionized molecules of the gas around the surface to diffuse the nitrogen and carbon into the workpiece. Such highly <b>active</b> <b>gas</b> with ionized molecules is called plasma, naming the technique. The gas used for plasma nitriding is usually pure nitrogen, since no spontaneous decomposition is needed (as is the case of gaseous ferritic nitrocarburizing with ammonia). Due to the relatively low temperature range ( [...] to [...] ) generally applied during plasma-assisted ferritic nitrocarburizing and gentle cooling in the furnace, the distortion of workpieces can be minimized. Stainless steel workpieces can be processed at moderate temperatures (like [...] ) without the formation of chromium nitride precipitates and hence maintaining their corrosion resistance properties.|$|E
