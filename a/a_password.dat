5|$|Mega Man 2 {{features}} a few gameplay changes {{from the original}} Mega Man. A new item, the Energy Tank, allows a player to refill Mega Manâ€™s health at any time. Also introduced is <b>a</b> <b>password</b> system. After defeating each Robot Master <b>a</b> <b>password</b> is displayed, allowing the player to return to that particular point in the game after restarting the system. The password stores the particular list of completed Robot Masters, {{as well as the}} number of accumulated Energy Tanks. Unlike the first game, Mega Man 2 does not feature a score counter, and the player is unable to return to Robot Master levels once completed.|$|E

5|$|The Vs. Battle is the {{multiplayer}} mode {{where two}} to four players can compete simultaneously. Time Attack lets the player choose any track and complete it in the shortest time possible. An Internet ranking system was established where players enter <b>a</b> <b>password</b> on the official F-Zero website and get ranked based on {{their position in the}} database. Players receive <b>a</b> <b>password</b> after completing a Time Attack race, which records their time and machine used. Ghost data, transparent re-enactments of the player's Time Attack performances, can be saved on memory cards to later race against. Up to five ghosts can be raced against simultaneously. The Replay mode allows saved Grand Prix and Time Attack gameplay to be replayed with different camera angles and in-game music. The Pilot Profile mode has each character's biography, theme music, information on their machine, and a short full motion video sequence.|$|E
50|$|<b>As</b> <b>password</b> {{cracking}} {{is inherently}} embarrassingly parallel Crack v4.0a introduced {{the ability to}} use a network of heterogeneous workstations connected by a shared filesystem as parts of <b>a</b> distributed <b>password</b> cracking effort.|$|R
30|$|Sharing <b>a</b> long <b>password</b> {{also proved}} <b>a</b> {{usability}} challenge. We required users {{to come up}} with and share <b>a</b> long <b>password</b> or phrase, independent of the OSN account and unique for each group. Users had a hard time remembering passwords and resorted to using simple easy to guess passwords. The situation was complicated further by having <b>an</b> application <b>password,</b> <b>a</b> self-destruct <b>password</b> and the possibility of adding multiple groups.|$|R
50|$|S/KEY is <b>a</b> {{one-time}} <b>password</b> system {{developed for}} authentication to Unix-like operating systems, especially from dumb terminals or untrusted public computers on which {{one does not}} want to type <b>a</b> long-term <b>password.</b> <b>A</b> user's real <b>password</b> is combined in an offline device with a short set of characters and a decrementing counter to form <b>a</b> single-use <b>password.</b> Because each password is only used once, they are useless to password sniffers.|$|R
5|$|Upon {{completing}} either game, players receive <b>a</b> <b>password</b> {{that can}} be used to play an alternative version of the other. In this version, some characters mention passwords {{that can be}} given to characters in the first game in exchange for an item or upgrade. Then, by taking a new password back into the linked game, the item or upgrade can be transferred. Rings can be traded by this password system or randomly created by connecting two games with a Game Link Cable.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} titles, Ninja Gaiden III received mostly positive reviews from critics. Early reviews praised the game for its plot, gameplay, and difficulty; later reviews criticized it for that plot being overly outlandish, inconsistent level designs, and the game's difficulty level, in which the North American version was intentionally made harder than the Japanese version through limited continues, stronger enemies, and omission of <b>a</b> <b>password</b> system. The Atari Lynx port, while receiving general praise for graphics and controls, received poor reception for its sound and for the inability for players to see characters and items, attributing it to the Lynx's small screen.|$|E
5|$|Blue and Red Landers, {{recurring}} {{characters in}} many Compile games, increase the player's maximum life and power chip capacities, respectively. Blue Landers play multiple roles in The Guardian Legend. Some {{of them are}} not items but non-player characters that dispense advice to the player or exchange upgrades for power chips; others provide <b>a</b> <b>password</b> that allows the player to resume the game at a later time with their progress retained. These Blue Landers also serve as checkpoints; players can restart their game in these designated rooms after being defeated provided the system has not been turned off.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> partial <b>password</b> is <b>a</b> mode of <b>password</b> authentication.|$|R
50|$|This {{symmetrical}} encryption {{happens in}} the user's web browser using AES-256. Upon the account registration, the user is asked to provide <b>a</b> login <b>password</b> for their account. ProtonMail also offers users to login with two password mode that require <b>a</b> login <b>password</b> and <b>a</b> mailbox <b>password.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> 14-character <b>password</b> {{is broken}} into 7+7 {{characters}} and the hash is {{calculated for the}} two halves separately. This way of calculating the hash makes it exponentially easier to crack, as the attacker need to brute force 7 characters twice instead of 14 characters. This makes the effective strength of <b>a</b> 14-characters <b>password</b> equal to twice that of <b>a</b> 7-character <b>password,</b> which is significantly less complex than the strength of <b>a</b> 14-character <b>password.</b>|$|R
5|$|Commander Keen is a side-scrolling {{platform}} video game: {{the majority}} of the game features the player-controlled Commander Keen viewed from the side while moving on a two-dimensional plane. The player can move left and right and can jump, and can use a pogo stick to bounce continuously and jump higher than they can normally with the correct timing. The levels are composed of platforms on which Keen can stand, viewed from the side as in the original Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons trilogy, and some platforms allow Keen to jump up through them from below. The game also includes moving platforms and teleporters that Keen can respectively jump on and interact with. In between levels, the player travels on a two-dimensional map, viewed from above; from the map, the player can enter levels by approaching the entrance. Once entered, the only way to exit a level is to reach the end, or by resetting the game. When a level is completed, the player is given <b>a</b> <b>password</b> that records their progress, lives, and points; this password is entered when starting the game in order to resume where the player left off. The game is divided into three worlds, connected by a central hub area where the game begins and where Keen starts whenever <b>a</b> <b>password</b> is entered.|$|E
5|$|Dragon Quest {{was created}} by Yuji Horii, who took {{inspiration}} from previous role-playing games such as Wizardry, Ultima, and his own 1983 title The Portopia Serial Murder Case. Horii wanted to create an RPG which would appeal to a wide audience {{of people who were}} unfamiliar with the genre of video games in general. He tried to place a greater emphasis on storytelling and emotional involvement, as well as simplify the interface and expose the mostly Western computer genre to the Japanese console market. Manga artist and Dragon Ball creator Akira Toriyama produced the game's artwork and Koichi Sugiyama composed its music. The North American version featured numerous changes, including battery-backed RAM save games (rather than using <b>a</b> <b>password</b> save system), modified character sprites and pseudo-Elizabethan English style dialog.|$|E
5|$|Following release, {{there were}} several {{complaints}} about the game crashing, having a vague user interface, and lacking any save system. In response to these complaints, Svensson noted that a patch was being discussed with the development team {{to address these issues}} in a future update. An updated version was released on January 28, 2013 under the name, Street Fighter X Mega Man V2. The update boasts an improved user interface, better controller compatibility, bug fixes, <b>a</b> <b>password</b> save system reminiscent of the original Mega Man games on the Nintendo Entertainment System, and an additional boss character.|$|E

Bugs filed on this issue have been marked [...] "WontFix". , the Windows version asks the user to enter the Windows account password before showing saved passwords.|$|R
5|$|In most Dragon Quest games, players must visit {{a church}} (known as a House of Healing in the NES translations) {{and talk to}} a priest or nun to save the games' progress; in Dragon Warrior, players {{had to talk to}} a king to save their progress, though the first two Dragon Quest titles for Famicom use <b>a</b> <b>password</b> save system. If the party dies in battle the group loses half of its gold and warps to the nearest save {{location}} where the hero is revived; players must then pay a priest or nun to revive their party members.|$|E
5|$|The Famicom {{version of}} Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei is a {{traditional}} role-playing video game in which the player takes control of a party composed of two humans {{and a number of}} demons. The party explores a large dungeon using a first-person perspective. The human characters use a variety of weapons and items, with the primary weapons being swords and guns. The items, which can range from healing items to different types of currency, are picked up from enemies or found in chests scattered through the dungeon. Weapons and accessories are purchased at different shops found within the dungeon. Progress is saved using <b>a</b> <b>password</b> system.|$|E
5|$|The console {{features}} parental controls, {{which can}} be used to prohibit younger users from playing games with content unsuitable for their age level. When one attempts to play a Wii or Virtual Console game, it reads the content rating encoded in the game data; if this rating is greater than the system's set age level, the game will not load without <b>a</b> <b>password.</b> Parental controls may also restrict Internet access, which blocks the Internet Channel and system-update features. Since the console is restricted to Nintendo GameCube functionality when playing Nintendo GameCube Game Discs, GameCube software is unaffected by Wii parental-control settings.|$|E
50|$|When FileVault {{is enabled}} the system invites {{the user to}} create <b>a</b> master <b>{{password}}</b> for the computer. If <b>a</b> user <b>password</b> is forgotten, the master password or recovery key {{may be used to}} decrypt the files instead.|$|R
50|$|A disk {{always has}} two {{password}}s: <b>A</b> User <b>password</b> and <b>a</b> Master <b>password.</b> Most disks support <b>a</b> Master <b>Password</b> Revision Code. Reportedly, some disks can report if the Master password has been changed, {{or if it}} still is the factory default. The revision code is word 92 in the IDENTIFY response. Reportedly, on some disks, a value of 0xFFFE means the Master password is unchanged. The standard does not distinguish this value.|$|R
50|$|At {{the core}} of <b>a</b> {{cognitive}} <b>password</b> system lies the questions. These questions were designed to be more memorable than the standard username/password authentication method. As such, {{a measure of the}} strength of <b>a</b> cognitive <b>password</b> is the memorability/guessability ratio.|$|R
5|$|The {{draft was}} {{announced}} by WWE Chairman Vince McMahon on the May 26, 2008 episode of Raw. During the announcement, {{he stated that}} every WWE performer from all three brands, Raw, ECW, and SmackDown, were eligible to be drafted. On the June 16 episode of Raw, McMahon announced that his McMahon's Million Dollar Mania contest would {{take place on the}} same night as the WWE Draft. During the contest, McMahon gave away one million dollars to WWE fans. McMahon telephoned fans, who had registered for the contest, at their homes and asked them for <b>a</b> <b>password,</b> which was revealed {{at the opening of the}} Raw broadcast. If their answer was correct, he awarded the fan a portion of one million dollars.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Wily's Revenge reuses and mixes stage components, enemies, and robot masters {{from the}} first two NES games in the Mega Man series. The initial four stages and bosses (Cut Man, Ice Man, Fire Man, and Elec Man) come from the {{original}} Mega Man. <b>A</b> <b>password</b> system allows the player {{to return to the}} game after any or all of these first four stages are cleared or when the player suffers a game over. Once the player completes these stages and travels through Wily's fortress, four more robot masters must be fought in order to progress. These bosses (Quick Man, Bubble Man, Flash Man, and Heat Man) are taken from Mega Man 2 for NES. Although they do not have their own stages, the player earns the special weapons of these bosses. Once all four are defeated, the player faces a new robot master created for the game, Enker.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy XIV: From Astral to Umbral- Band & Piano Arrangement Album is a Blu-ray {{album of}} rock and piano {{arrangements}} of music from A Realm Reborn. It features arrangements by Soken, GUNN, Keiko, and Nobuko Toda of pieces originally composed by Soken for the game, and was published by Square Enix on December 17, 2014. The first six tracks on the album are piano covers, performed by Keiko, of field and town themes from the game. The following six are rock covers by Soken's band The Primals of the musical themes from the game of the primals, powerful elemental creatures. The Blu-ray disc also features the original versions of the twelve tracks, videos of in-game scenes where the original music plays, {{as well as one}} secret track that needs <b>a</b> <b>password</b> to unlock. Some of the original tracks had not yet been released on an official album when Astral to Umbral was produced.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> Super <b>Password</b> {{video game}} was {{released}} for DOS, the Apple II, and the Commodore 64 in 1988. A version for the NES was also planned around that time, but never surfaced. In 2000, <b>a</b> Super <b>Password</b> hand-held game was released.|$|R

30|$|As storing content locally leaves users {{vulnerable}} to device confiscation and search, SecurePost encrypts all data using <b>an</b> application-wide <b>password.</b> In {{the event that}} a user is under duress they can provide <b>a</b> false <b>password</b> that wipes the application data including posting keys.|$|R
5|$|If the player's {{character}} {{falls in}} battle, {{they are forced}} to restart from the beginning, with all their items and experience points gone; to avoid this, the player can store items in warehouses found in towns they travel through. Because of this, the player makes long-term progress by upgrading powerful items at village blacksmiths and storing them in warehouses, while upgrading their character is more of a temporary improvement. In the Nintendo DS version of the game, the player can avoid having to start over by getting rescued by another player: this is done by giving the other player a rescue quest, either through <b>a</b> <b>password</b> or the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. When a player embarks on a rescue mission, they start from level 1 and have to reach the fallen character without stopping at towns on their way. If they succeed, the rescued player can proceed from where they left off, and keep their items and experience points.|$|E
5|$|The games {{interacted with}} each other: players could begin {{with any of}} the three titles and have the actions of the first game affect the story of the other two, a concept {{conceived}} by Okamoto. More than ten of Flagship's scenarists, among them Resident Evil writer Junichi Miyashita, worked simultaneously on the three stories. The developers considered using a cell phone adapter to transfer data, but later decided on <b>a</b> <b>password</b> system. The limitations of this system and the difficulty of coordinating three games proved too complicated, so the team scaled back to two titles at Miyamoto's suggestion. Condensing the games into a single cartridge was never considered, as the prospect of multiple endings and the added replay value afforded by the ability to play the titles in either order was very attractive. Oracle of Seasons was adapted from Mystical Seed of Power, Oracle of Ages was adapted from Mystical Seed of Wisdom, and Mystical Seed of Courage was canceled.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} Mega Man {{series on}} the NES has generally consisted of 2D platform games that focus on run-and-gun gameplay. Mega Man X uses the same basic principles as its precursors but with many added options. The player takes control of the protagonist X, and, after completing an introductory stage, is presented with a stage selection screen that depicts eight boss characters. Each stage is littered with various enemies and hazards and ends with a boss battle against its respective Maverick. Completing a stage rewards the player with a new weapon. The player may attempt these eight levels in any order, using weapons gained in one level to overcome challenges in the others. The player can return to the game at a later point using <b>a</b> <b>password</b> system; the password will retain any number of the eight stages cleared and most power-ups. Completing some stages will subtly affect the landscape of others. For example, clearing Storm Eagle's aircraft carrier stage will cause electrical outages in Spark Mandrill's power plant stage. In certain stages, X can hop inside Ride Armors to fight enemies. Ride Armors are bipedal tanks capable of powerful punches.|$|E
