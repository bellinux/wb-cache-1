40|$|This thesis starts by {{describing}} {{research on the}} design of low frequency <b>induction</b> <b>heaters</b> using <b>a</b> series equivalent circuit model. Limitations associated with this design method are explained. An alternative called the transformer equivalent circuit (TEC) model is then presented. This models the <b>induction</b> <b>heater</b> as <b>a</b> single turn secondary transformer. Its advantage is that the currents and voltages associated with components of the <b>induction</b> <b>heater</b> are what you would expect to measure on components of <b>an</b> actual <b>induction</b> <b>heater.</b> Finite element analysis (FEA) is also used to predict the performance of <b>induction</b> <b>heaters.</b> The performances of these models are compared, with experimental veri cation on <b>a</b> small <b>induction</b> <b>heater</b> unit. The research is then extended to transduction heaters, a combination of transformer and in- duction heaters, which include a secondary winding to boost performance. The transformer equivalent circuit method is used to predict the performance of transduction heaters as they cannot be modelled using the series equivalent circuit model. The performances of the trans- former equivalent circuit and nite element analysis models are compared with results from a set of experimental transduction heaters. Modi cations are then made to the components of the TEC model to improve its performance predictions. The accuracy of TEC modelling is con rmed with a second design and veri ed with experimental results. This forms the basis for the nal design and implementation of an industrial unit. The improved TEC model is then used to predict the performance of a 40 kW transduction uid heater that was designed, built and tested. Comparisons are made between the TEC and FEA models calculated results and test results. The TEC calculated results yielded much closer values to those measured...|$|R

50|$|Induction heating is {{the process}} of heating an {{electrically}} conducting object (usually a metal) by electromagnetic induction, through heat generated in the object by eddy currents. <b>An</b> <b>induction</b> <b>heater</b> consists of an electromagnet, and an electronic oscillator that passes a high-frequency alternating current (AC) through the electromagnet. The rapidly alternating magnetic field penetrates the object, generating electric currents inside the conductor called eddy currents. The eddy currents flowing through the resistance of the material heat it by Joule heating. In ferromagnetic (and ferrimagnetic) materials like iron, heat may also be generated by magnetic hysteresis losses. The frequency of current used depends on the object size, material type, coupling (between the work coil and the object to be heated) and the penetration depth.|$|E

40|$|A {{fast and}} {{accurate}} technique for simulation of power electronics circuits is presented. The methodology begins by using Chebyshev polynomials to derive an adaptive stepwise quadratic state-space model for each piecewise-linear circuit topology. The state-space equation sets are integrated with modified nodal equations. The key {{feature of this}} algorithm is that it gives an approximate value of the optimum simulation step size for analysis of each circuit topology {{in order to achieve}} a desired accuracy in calculating the state transition matrix of the topology. Moreover the algorithm hybridizes the advantages of calculating the circuit responses at circuit level and determining switching instants at device level. The switching instants are calculated directly by solving simple quadratic equations. Furthermore it is unnecessary to have prior knowledge of the circuit operations such as the topology sequence and duration. The algorithm automatically looks for a valid topology at any time instant. The proposed method is illustrated with the examples of <b>a</b> practical <b>induction</b> <b>heater</b> and <b>a</b> boost dc/dc regulator.

40|$|Current-fed {{resonant}} converters {{have been}} widely used in large induction heating systems due to their low power losses and low EMI (Electromagnetic Interference). However, because of the bulky magnetic components and complicated control circuits employed, conventional current-fed inverters can hardly satisfy low power heating applications where the cost and size are of major concerns. This paper proposes a novel low cost push-pull current-fed inverter that is suitable for a portable car heater or other similar applications. The inverter integrates the dc inductor and the splitting transformer used in a conventional push-push inverter into one magnetic component using two drum cores wound with two identical windings. Furthermore, it does not require any additional controllers, thus the cost, weight, and physical size of the inverter are significantly reduced, making it ideal for portable car heater applications. The operation of the proposed inverter has been analysed in detail, and both simulation and practical experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed inverter works very well in generating the high frequency current required for <b>an</b> <b>induction</b> car <b>heater</b> or other low power heating devices...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{current work}} aims to {{describe}} a methodology to test brake friction materials through a braking tribometer, which is integrated by <b>an</b> electromagnetic <b>induction</b> <b>heater.</b> This technology allows to characterize the isolated effect of load and temperature on friction. Characteristics of the main machines and procedures for testing friction materials are evaluated, paying particular attention {{with regard to the}} effect of load and temperature on friction. Experimental methodology consisted of performing brakings under 3 levels of load and 4 levels of temperature. Results from the experiments show that coefficient of friction decreases considerably when temperature is higher than 300 °C. It was also observed that the effect of load on friction varies according to the friction material evaluated. About the number of braking applications at each temperature level, it has been verified that at temperatures of 200 °C, 300 °C and 350 °C, three braking are able to characterize the friction behavior. However, when temperature is 100 °C, at least 10 brakings are required in order to obtain satisfactory results. The reason for that is due to the bedding-in and also recovery effect of friction, which occurs immediately after to the brake friction material to be subjected to high temperatures (300 °C or higher) ...|$|R
40|$|To {{assess the}} {{integrity}} and reliability of an adhesive joint in an automotive composite component, several non-destructive evaluation (NDE) methodologies are correlated to lap shear bond strengths. A glass-fabric-reinforced composite structure was bonded to a metallic structure with a two-part epoxy adhesive. Samples were subsequently cut and tested in shear, and flaws were found in some areas. This study aims to develop a reliable and portable NDE system for service-level adhesive inspection in the automotive industry. The results of the experimental investigation using several NDE methods are presented and discussed. Fiberglass-to-metal bonding is the ideal configuration for NDE via thermography using excitation with induction heating, due to the conductive metal and non-conductive glass-fiber-reinforced composites. Excitation can be either by <b>a</b> research-grade <b>induction</b> <b>heater</b> of highly defined frequency and intensity, or by a service-level heater, such as {{would be used for}} sealing windshields in a body shop. The thermographs thus produced can be captured via a high-resolution infrared camera, with principal component analysis and 2 D spatial Laplacian processing. Alternatively, the thermographs can be captured by low resolution thermochromic microencapsulated liquid crystal film imaging, which needs no post-processing and can be very inexpensive. These samples were also examined with phased-array ultrasound.
