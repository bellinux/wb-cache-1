50|$|The first Skyfox {{converted}} was an ex-Canadian Forces CT-133, the Canadian license-built {{equivalent of}} the T-33 which were formerly a Silver Star 3AT (<b>Armament</b> <b>Trainer).</b> This particular aircraft, produced in 1958, had construction number T.33-160 and serial number RCAF21160. It was struck-off charge on 10 November 1970 and was sold through Crown Assets Disposal Corporation to Leroy Penhall/Fighter Imports in 1973. It was then sold to Murray McCormick Aerial Surveys in 1975. Its next owner was Consolidated Leasing in 1977.|$|E
50|$|After {{the end of}} the Cold war Bulgaria's {{air force}} is limited to 226 aircraft. A large number of early MiG-21 {{variants}} were withdrawn from service and were cut for scrap, and <b>armament</b> from the <b>trainers</b> for the MiG-21 and MiG-23 was removed. In 1998 four air bases were closed down: Gabrovnitsa, Balchick, Uzundzhovo and Shtraklevo. Then in 2000 the Stara Zagora (operating Mi-24s) air force base was closed. Then in 2001 three more bases were closed down: Dobrich, Ravnets and Cheshnegirovo. In 2003 Dobroslavtsi was closed down and the MiG-23s were withdrawn from service, because it is more expensive to run than the MiG-21. In February 2004 the Su-22s, which were stationed first in Dobrich then in Bezmer, were withdrawn.|$|R
50|$|As far as bombers are concerned, the Potez 25 and Breguet 19 were {{replaced}} by an all-metal monoplane, the PZL.23 Karaś (250 built, after 1936), but even by 1939 the Karas was outdated. In 1938 the Polish factory PZL designed a modern twin-engine medium bomber PZL.37 Łoś (Elk), arguably the best bomber in the world when it entered service that year. The Los had a bomb payload of 2580 kg and {{a top speed of}} 439 km/h. Unfortunately, too few entered service before the war (approximately 30 Los A bombers (single-fin tail) and 70 Los B (twin-fin) bombers were delivered before the war started). As an observation and close reconnaissance plane, Polish escadres used slow and easily damaged Lublin R-XIII, then RWD-14 Czapla. Polish naval aviation used Lublin R-XIII on floats. Just before the war, some Italian torpedo planes CANT Z.506 were ordered, but only one was delivered, without <b>armament.</b> The main <b>trainer</b> plane was the Polish-built high-wing RWD-8 (primary) and biplane PWS-26 (trainer). In 1939, Poland ordered 160 of MS-406 and 10 Hawker Hurricane fighters abroad, but they were not delivered before the outbreak of war.|$|R
