40|$|Coccidia were {{identified}} in intestinal sections from 82 piglets comprising 37 consignments from 34 farms, and represented a yearly increasing incidence {{in the three years}} 1978 to 1980. Piglets were primarily from medium to large farms with intensive, continuous-farrowing, confinement-rearing programs. Piglets, usually five days to 15 days old, had yellow, fluid diarrhea, became unthrifty and sometimes died. In six piglets from two farms, <b>a</b> green, <b>adherent,</b> fibrinonecrotic <b>membrane</b> was seen throughout most of the jejunum and ileum. Significant gross lesions were not observed in the other 76 piglets. Moderate to severe villous atrophy of jejunum and ileum was seen histologically. Various asexual and sexual stages of coccidia were seen within parasitophorous vacuoles of villar epithelial cells. Multifocal erosions with necrosis of villar tips and occasionally more diffuse mucosal necrosis with fibrinocellular exudate were seen. Isospora suis oocysts {{were identified}} in feces from several weaners from one farm.

40|$|The {{ability to}} persist in the host after the {{establishment}} of infection is an important virulence determinant for mycobacteria. Mycobacterium abscessus is a rapidly growing mycobacterial species which causes a variety of clinical syndromes in humans. We have obtained a rough, wild-type human clinical isolate of M. abscessus (M. abscessus-R) and a smooth, attenuated mutant (M. abscessus-S) which spontaneously dissociated from the clinical isolate. We have found that M. abscessus-R is able to persist and multiply in a murine pulmonary infection model in contrast to M. abscessus-S, which is rapidly cleared. To understand the basis for this difference, we characterized the behavior of these variants in human tissue culture models of infection. M. abscessus-R is able to persist and multiply in human monocytes, while M. abscessus-S is deficient in this ability. Both of these variants are phagocytized by human monocytes. M. abscessus-R resides in a phagosome typical for pathogenic mycobacteria with <b>a</b> tightly <b>adherent</b> phagosomal <b>membrane.</b> In contrast, M. abscessus-S resides in a “loose” phagosome with the phagosomal membrane separated from the bacterial cell wall. Both M. abscessus variants also have distinctive growth patterns in a recently described fibroblast-mycobacterium microcolony assay, with M. abscessus-R exhibiting growth characteristics similar to those previously reported for virulent M. tuberculosis and M. abscessus-S exhibiting growth characteristics similar to those previously reported for avirulent M. tuberculosis. In both the monocyte infection assay and the murine pulmonary infection model, numerous infected mononuclear phagocyte aggregates develop at sites of M. abscessus-R infection, but are absent with M. abscessus-S infection. We conclude that a mutation {{has occurred in the}} M. abscessus-S variant which has altered the ability of this organism to persist and multiply in host cells and that this {{may be related to the}} phenotypic changes we have observed in our tissue culture models of infection...|$|R

Normal rat kidney fibroblasts showed similar attachment kinetics on either peptide GRGDSC or bovine plasma fibronectin and binding to either substratum was inhibited by peptide alone. We now demonstrate, however, considerable differences in biological activity between peptide and fibronectin. In particular, cells developed novel adhesion structures on peptide-coated substrata.

40|$|The {{mechanics}} of membrane-membrane adhesion are {{developed for the}} approximation that the molecular cross-bridging forces are continuously distributed as a normal stress (force per unit area). The significance of the analysis is that the finite range of the cross-bridging forces and the microscopic contact angle are not assumed negligible. Since the cross-bridging and adhesion forces are finite range interactions, there are two membrane regions: a free zone where the membranes {{are not subject to}} attractive forces; and <b>an</b> <b>adherent</b> zone where the membranes are held together by attractive stresses. The membrane is treated as an elastic continuum. The approach is to analyze the mechanics for each zone separately and then to require continuity of the solutions at the interface between the zones. Final solution yields the membrane contour and stresses proximal to and within the contact zone as well as the microscopic contact angle {{at the edge of the}} contact zone. It is demonstrated that the classical Young equation is consistent with this model. The results show that the microscopic contact angle becomes appreciable when the strength of adhesion is large or the length of the cross-bridge is large; however, the microscopic contact angle approaches zero as the membrane elastic stiffness increases. The solution predicts the width of the contact zone over which molecular bonds are stretched. It is this boundary region where increased biochemical activity is expected. In the classical model presented here, the level of tension necessary to oppose spreading of the contact is equal to the minimal level of tension required to separate the <b>adherent</b> <b>membranes.</b> (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|R

40|$|Background: Dehiscence of {{abdominal}} wounds {{is often}} a clinical and surgical challenge, especially in patients with multiple comorbidities. Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) is a treatment based on controlled negative pressure. Objectives: Our experience concerning NPWT in 2 patients affected with surgical abdominal wound dehiscences and significant comorbidities is reported and discussed. Methods: Both the patients has been treated using V 1 STA® (Smith & Nephew), a device based on the Chariker-Jeter technique (a flat/tubular drain embedded in the wound bed, on a layer of saline-moistened gauze, completely covered by other layers of gauze placed in the wound to fill the defect to the skin level; <b>an</b> <b>adherent</b> plastic <b>membrane</b> attached over the dressing and the surrounding skin to convert the open wound in a closed, controlled system; the drain is connected to a canister, linked to the NPWT suction system), with a - 70 / 80 mmHg continuous suction. Patient A, a 43 years old woman affected with type 1 advanced-stage spinocerebellar ataxia, chronic pain not responsive to morphine, abdominal distension related to hepatomegaly and enteric hypotonia, had a 8, 5 x 1 x 2, 5 cm median laparotomy wound dehiscence (related to a subtotal colectomy for megacolon, enteral hypotonia), yet unsuccessfully treated for a month with traditional methods (contaminated and dead tissue removal, frequent changes in wound dressings). Patient B, a 75 years old woman, affected with class III obesity (BMI: 44), diabetes mellitus type I, colonic diverticular disease, was admitted to our Surgical Unit with a 20 x 8 x 6 cm median laparotomy wound dehiscence, developed after a left emicolectomy, performed for a diffuse peritonitis due to a colonic diverticulum perforation. Results: In both patients no side effects were recorded. Patient A was treated for 20 days with NPWT. Complete resolution of the wound dehiscence was recorded at day 30 th. Patient B was discharged 9 days after the admittance at our Surgical Unit (NPWT was applied on the 2 nd day). Nowadays (42 days after discharging) she’s still in treatment with NPWT, followed at our outpatient clinic, where the dressing changes are performed two times/week; dehiscence (actually 10 x 5 x 2, 5 cm) is healing, with no signs of infection. Conclusion: Several studies validated NPWT efficacy reducing oedema, evacuating fluids from the extravascular space of the wound margins and bed, improving bacterial clearance, increasing local blood perfusion, stimulating the proliferation of fibroblasts and neo-angiogenesis. NPWT is a well-tolerated option, which {{has been used for}} several types of wounds (sternal, abdominal, vascular wounds, decubitus ulcers, etc [...] ), offering increased patient comfort, less nursing time spent with dressing changes, and, in some cases, outpatient management. NPWT may be considered a succesful method in the management of wound dehiscences in patients with difficult healing wounds and important comorbidities...|$|R

Typically, symptoms develop first in one eye, but may spread to the other eye within 2-5 days. Bacterial conjunctivitis due to common pyogenic (pus-producing) bacteria causes marked grittiness/irritation and a stringy, opaque, greyish or yellowish mucopurulent discharge that may cause the lids to stick together, especially after sleep. Severe crusting of the infected eye and the surrounding skin may also occur. The gritty and/or scratchy feeling is sometimes localized enough for patients to insist they must have a foreign body in the eye. The more acute pyogenic infections can be painful. Common bacteria responsible for non-acute bacterial conjunctivitis are Staphylococci, Streptococci, Haemophilus sp. Less commonly Chlamydia trachomatis is involved.Bacteria such as Chlamydia trachomatis or Moraxella can cause a non-exudative but persistent conjunctivitis without much redness.
