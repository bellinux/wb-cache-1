25|$|While on harbor patrol, McNulty {{spots the}} body of a dead woman in the water. When Rawls argues the case is not in his jurisdiction, McNulty, spends three hours poring over wind and tide charts to prove the death {{occurred}} within city limits. When port authority officer Beadie Russell finds thirteen dead women in a shipping container on the Baltimore docks, McNulty again intervenes and, {{with the help of the}} medical examiner, proves that the deaths were not accidental: the <b>air</b> <b>pipe</b> to the container was deliberately closed off, and, with the help of a mining engineer, they are able to prove that the ship was within the city limits when it happened. The case is given to Bunk and Lester, who don't look forward to investigating these difficult cases.|$|E
2500|$|Shippen Street {{was named}} after William W. Shippen, who owned large {{properties}} in Weehawken Heights [...] adjacent to those in West Hoboken belonging to the Hoboken Land and Improvement Company, {{of which he was}} the president for 21 years. A prominent German immigrant population in the area during the late 19th century housed large groups of anarchists; saloons could be found in several locations within the Union Hill area. The largest assembly hall, The New Casino was on Shippen Street. Although it now ends at Palisades, in the past the name Shippen Street was used {{at least as far as}} Central Avenue, where it was once proposed by the city government and townspeople to utilize a 200-foot shaft used in the construction of the railroad tunnels as a stop to provide North Hudson's then 130,000 residents within the mile radius of the shaft with transportation to the Pennsylvania Station being constructed in Manhattan. In 1904, the Geological Society surveyed the area, but ultimately no stop was made on Shippen Street. A few years later in 1907, 125 men working in the North River Tunnels were forced to evacuate through the Shippen Street opening when tar paper used for waterproofing became ignited. Eleven men were unaccounted for upon the initial count; they were found 500 feet from the shaft at Shippen alive but unconscious, and had apparently survived by inhaling oxygen through a compressed <b>air</b> <b>pipe</b> which they hacked through. Although some were hospitalized with serious injury, none were reported dead.|$|E

40|$|On-line {{measurement}} of pulverized fuel (PF) distribution between primary <b>air</b> <b>pipes</b> on a {{coal-fired power plant}} is of great importance to achieve balanced fuel supply to the boiler for increased combustion efficiency and reduced pollutant emissions. An instrumentation system using multiple electrostatic sensing heads are developed and installed on 510 mm bore primary <b>air</b> <b>pipes</b> of a 600 MW coal-fired boiler for the {{measurement of}} mass flow distribution of PF. An array of electrostatic electrodes with different axial widths is housed in a sensing head. An electrode with a greater axial width and three narrower electrodes are used to derive the electrostatic signals for the determination of PF mass flow rate and velocity, respectively. The measured PF velocity {{is used for the}} calibration of coal mass flow rate. On-plant comparison trials of the developed system were conducted under typical operating conditions. Isokinetic sampling equipment is used to obtain reference data to evaluate the performance of the system. Experimental data demonstrate that the developed system is effective and reliable for the on-line continuous measurement of PF mass flow distribution between the primary <b>air</b> <b>pipes</b> of the same mill...|$|R

50|$|The annular {{atmospheric}} condenser {{was easier to}} control with respect to cooling rates. The gas in the tall vertical cylinders was annular in form and allowed an inside and outside surface {{to be exposed to}} cooling air. The diagonal side pipes conveyed the warm gas to the upper ends of each annular cylinder. Butterfly valves or dampers were fitted to the top of each vertical <b>air</b> <b>pipe,</b> so that the amount of cooling could be regulated.|$|E

The bogies were of the Görlitz III type, the wheelsets ran on roller bearings. Instead of the usual brake blocks the coaches were given disc brakes, that acted directly on the wheel discs.|$|R
