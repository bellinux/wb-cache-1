5|$|In {{a passive}} ALF, the input {{frequency}} must correspond <b>almost</b> <b>exactly</b> {{to the natural}} absorption lines of the vapor cell. Active ARFs are much more flexible, however, as the vapor may be stimulated {{so that it will}} absorb other frequencies of light.|$|E
5|$|An {{international}} {{version of}} the video was also officially released. This version is <b>almost</b> <b>exactly</b> {{the same as the}} original, with the only difference being that some early shots were Spears dances in front of the multicolored background are replaced by shots of Spears with a short blonde bob wig wearing a purple dress and in front of a black background with flashing lights.|$|E

The first of George III and Queen Charlotte's children to die, Alfred died nearly seventy five years before his older sister Mary, who was the last survivor of George III and Queen Charlotte's fifteen children. Alfred is also unique among their first fourteen children for never being an older sibling while he was alive, as the only child younger than him was born after his death.|$|E

The average annual rainfall is about , the wettest months being September to January. This is lower than the national average annual rainfall of 838mm(33inches).|$|E
5|$|Pre-orders of Blue Dragon bundled with {{a limited}} edition Xbox 360 Core system were sold out in Japan well before the December 7, 2006 release date. Microsoft and Mistwalker {{initially}} hoped to sell over 200,000 copies, which would break their record for sales of an Xbox 360 game in Japan. The game did manage the goal, with <b>almost</b> <b>exactly</b> 200,000 copies sold as of December 27, 2007. Creator Hironobu Sakaguchi was pleased the game sold {{as well as it}} did.|$|E
5|$|The gross {{underestimation}} of Fighter Command's strength {{issued to}} Luftwaffe units meant the British reaction was {{much stronger than}} expected. During the 24-hour period, Fighter Command flew 927 sorties, slightly fewer than the Germans. Only 41 of these sorties were flown by night, 28 on 17/18 August and 13 on 18/19 August. The remaining 886 sorties were flown by day, a number <b>almost</b> <b>exactly</b> equal to the 861 serviceable Spitfire, Hurricane, Defiant and Gladiator day fighters available to squadrons.|$|E
50|$|When several {{separate}} paths from transmitter to receiver exist, {{a condition}} known as multipath, they <b>almost</b> never have <b>exactly</b> {{the same length}} so they almost never exhibit the same propagation delay. Small delay differences, or delay spread, smear adjacent modulation symbols together and cause unwanted intersymbol interference.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Problems {{concerning}} {{characterization of}} eigenvalues of some linear and homogenous differential systems by the Pellew and Southwell method of con-jugate eigenfunctions {{in the domain}} of hydrodynamic instability are discussed and a general mathematical framework described. In this general survey we look back on and rewrite this work <b>almost</b> in <b>exactly</b> the way it evolved out of a few naive looking calculations in hydrodynamic instability. We show in the process the close relationship that exists between mathematical analysis and its applications with due credit to intuition as the main source of mathematical activity...|$|R
5|$|At present, {{the orbits}} of the Haumean moons appear <b>almost</b> <b>exactly</b> edge-on from Earth, with Namaka having {{periodically}} occulted Haumea from 2009 to 2011. Observation of such transits would provide precise information on {{the size and shape}} of Haumea and its moons, as happened in the late 1980s with Pluto and Charon. The tiny change in brightness of the system during these occultations required at least a medium-aperture professional telescope for detection. Hiʻiaka last occulted Haumea in 1999, a few years before its discovery, and will not do so again for some 130 years. However, in a situation unique among regular satellites, the great torquing of Namaka's orbit by Hiʻiaka preserved the viewing angle of Namaka–Haumea transits for several more years.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, {{this design}} would prove too {{advanced}} and expensive for Reynolds. He instead devised an alternate {{design of the}} Reynolds Building, {{which was published in}} August 1928. The new design was much more conservative, with an Italianate dome that a critic compared to Governor Al Smith's bowler hat, and a brick arrangement on the upper floors that simulated windows in the corners, a detail that remains in the current Chrysler Building. This design <b>almost</b> <b>exactly</b> reflected the shape, setbacks, and the layout of the windows of the current building, but with a different dome.|$|E
5|$|Hafnium is a shiny, silvery, {{ductile metal}} that is {{corrosion-resistant}} and chemically similar to zirconium (due to its {{having the same}} number of valence electrons, being in the same group, but also to relativistic effects; the expected expansion of atomic radii from period 5 to 6 is <b>almost</b> <b>exactly</b> cancelled out by the lanthanide contraction). The physical properties of hafnium metal samples are markedly affected by zirconium impurities, especially the nuclear properties, as these two elements are among the most difficult to separate because of their chemical similarity.|$|E
40|$|An {{algebraic}} {{method of}} constructing potentials {{for which the}} Schroedinger equation with position dependent mass can be solved exactly is presented. A general form of the generators of su(1, 1) algebra has been employed with a unified approach to the problem. Our systematic approach reproduces a number of earlier results and also leads to some novelties. We show that the solutions of the Schroedinger equation with position dependent mass are free from the choice of parameters for position dependent mass. Two classes of potentials are constructed that include <b>almost</b> all <b>exactly</b> solvable potentials...|$|R
50|$|Adding a {{water soluble}} substance, such as salt or sugar also {{increases}} the boiling point. This is called boiling-point elevation. At palatable concentrations of salt, {{the effect is}} very small, and the boiling point elevation is difficult to notice. However, while making thick sugar syrup, such as for Gulab Jamun, one will notice boiling point elevation. Due to variations in composition and pressure, the boiling point of water is <b>almost</b> never <b>exactly</b> 100 °C, but rather close enough for cooking.Foods suitable for boiling include vegetables, starchy foods such as rice, noodles and potatoes, eggs, meats, sauces, stocks and soups.|$|R
40|$|Using the {{modified}} factorization method employed in [5], we construct {{a new class}} of radial potentials whose spectrum for l = 0 coincides exactly with that of the hydrogen atom. A limiting case of our family coincides with the potentials previously derived by Abraham and Moses [6]. 1 Introduction. In <b>almost</b> all <b>exactly</b> soluble spectral problems of the energy operator, the possibility of obtaining an exact expression for the energy levels and the corresponding eigenstates stems from the group theoretical symmetries which lead to the algebraic factorization method [1]-[3]. This method, until quite recently, appeared to have been fully explored...|$|R
5|$|The {{abundance}} of {{silver in the}} Earth's crust is 0.08parts per million, <b>almost</b> <b>exactly</b> {{the same as that}} of mercury. It mostly occurs in sulfide ores, especially acanthite and argentite, Ag2S. Argentite deposits sometimes also contain native silver when they occur in reducing environments, and when in contact with salt water they are converted to chlorargyrite (including horn silver), AgCl, which is prevalent in Chile and New South Wales. Most other silver minerals are silver pnictides or chalcogenides; they are generally lustrous semiconductors. Most true silver deposits, as opposed to argentiferous deposits of other metals, came from Tertiary period vulcanism.|$|E
5|$|The {{brightest}} {{star in the}} night sky, Sirius is recorded in the earliest astronomical records. Every year, it disappears for seventy days {{before returning to the}} night sky just before sunrise. Its displacement from the ecliptic causes this heliacal rising to be remarkably regular compared to other stars, with a period of <b>almost</b> <b>exactly</b> 365.25 days holding it constant relative to the solar year. This occurs at Cairo on 19July (Julian), placing it just prior to the summer solstice and the onset of the annual flooding of the Nile during antiquity.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of a stable star {{is in a state}} of hydrostatic equilibrium: the forces on any small volume <b>almost</b> <b>exactly</b> counterbalance each other. The balanced forces are inward gravitational force and an outward force due to the pressure gradient within the star. The pressure gradient is established by the temperature gradient of the plasma; the outer part of the star is cooler than the core. The temperature at the core of a main sequence or giant star is at least on the order of 107 K. The resulting temperature and pressure at the hydrogen-burning core of a main sequence star are sufficient for nuclear fusion to occur and for sufficient energy to be produced to prevent further collapse of the star.|$|E
50|$|They {{finished}} in ninth place with 44 points, <b>almost</b> in <b>exactly</b> {{the same spot}} they had finished {{for the past two}} seasons. The defence had tightened up, but the attack, and especially top-scorer Kirkham had been somewhat off the boil. This led to Jack Lowe, Sidney Blunt, and Alex Trotter all being handed free transfers; they left for Oldham Athletic, Shrewsbury Town, and Manchester Central respectively. Meanwhile, back-up keepers Matthews and Holdcroft were also released, the former went to Halifax Town; however the latter would eventually find himself an England international and FA Cup winner at Preston North End.|$|R
5000|$|Under {{the best}} of circumstances, Sigma serial numbers can only provide an {{indicator}} of the year in which a particular model was built. This may be due to them being built in several Japanese factories at the same time with no coordination or tracking in the numbering system.However, while some models lasted the entire run from 1970 through 1983, others did not and were only offered for a limited number of years. Other physical indicators or attributes, such as finish, trim, tuners, etc., can help determine the approximate construction date of a particular example, but <b>almost</b> never <b>exactly.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In aesthetics, {{the uncanny}} valley is the {{hypothesis}} that human replicas which appear <b>almost,</b> but not <b>exactly,</b> like real human beings elicit feelings of eeriness and revulsion (or uncanniness) among some observers. Valley denotes {{a dip in the}} human observer's affinity for the replica, a relation that otherwise increases with the replica's human likeness.|$|R
5|$|The {{path of the}} Sun in {{the local}} sky {{over the course of}} a local day during Uranus's and its major moons' summer {{solstice}} is quite different from that seen on most other Solar System worlds. The major moons have <b>almost</b> <b>exactly</b> the same rotational axial tilt as Uranus (their axes are parallel to that of Uranus). The Sun would appear to follow a circular path around Uranus's celestial pole in the sky, at the closest about 7 degrees from it. Near the equator, it would be seen nearly due north or due south (depending on the season). At latitudes higher than 7°, the Sun would trace a circular path about 15 degrees in diameter in the sky, and never set.|$|E
5|$|The peak {{brightness}} of the μ ring lies <b>almost</b> <b>exactly</b> on the orbit of the small Uranian moon Mab, which is probably {{the source of the}} ring’s particles. The ν ring is positioned between Portia and Rosalind and does not contain any moons inside it. A reanalysis of the Voyager 2 images of forward-scattered light clearly reveals the μ and ν rings. In this geometry the rings are much brighter, which indicates that they contain much micrometer-sized dust. The outer rings of Uranus may be similar to the G and E rings of Saturn as E ring is extremely broad and receives dust from Enceladus.|$|E
5|$|The pier {{opened in}} 1869 {{and served as}} an {{embarkation}} point for paddle steamer excursions for <b>almost</b> <b>exactly</b> 100 years. Two of the spans collapsed during stress testing in 1970 and demolition was proposed, but local fund raising and heritage grants allowed the pier to be dismantled for restoration and reassembled. It reopened in 1989, and ten years later was awarded the Pier of the Year from the National Piers Society, and a Civic Trust Award. The pier now, once again, offers a landing stage for steamers and is a popular attraction for tourists and anglers.|$|E
50|$|These sodium {{channels}} are voltage-dependent, opening rapidly due to depolarization of the membrane, which usually occurs from neighboring cells, through gap junctions. They {{allow for a}} rapid flow of sodium into the cell, depolarizing the membrane completely and initiating an action potential. As the membrane potential increases, these channels then close and lock (become inactive). Due to the rapid influx sodium ions (steep phase 0 in action potential waveform) activation and inactivation of these channels happens <b>almost</b> at <b>exactly</b> the same time. During the inactivation state, Na+ cannot pass through (absolute refractory period). However they begin to recover from inactivation as the membrane potential becomes more negative (relative refractory period).|$|R
50|$|A major {{outstanding}} {{problem is}} that the same quantum field theories predict a huge cosmological constant, more than 100 orders of magnitude too large. This would need to be <b>almost,</b> but not <b>exactly,</b> cancelled by an equally large term of the opposite sign. Some supersymmetric theories require a cosmological constant that is exactly zero, which does not help because supersymmetry must be broken.|$|R
50|$|The {{provinces of}} Sweden serve no {{administrative}} or political purposes, but function as {{historical and cultural}} entities. In the case of Dalarna a corresponding administrative Dalarna County has <b>almost,</b> but not <b>exactly,</b> the same boundaries as the province, except for {{a part of the}} north-east (Hamra parish, also known as Orsa Finnmark) which forms part of Ljusdal Municipality, Gävleborg County.|$|R
