Schmuel Baruch and Yakar Kanai (2001) suggested that shochu, a Japanese distilled beverage, {{might be a}} Giffen good. In both cases, the authors offered supporting econometric evidence. However, the empirical evidence has been generally considered incomplete. In a 2005 article, Sasha Abramsky of The Nation conjectured that gasoline, in certain circumstances, may act as a Giffen good. However, no supporting evidence was offered, and evidence from the large increases in oil prices in 2008 would suggest that quantity demanded for gasoline did actually fall {{as a result of}} increased prices. Of course, the lack of evidence at the <b>aggregate</b> <b>level</b> does not rule out that the proposed goods may have been Giffen for certain groups of consumers—in particular for poor consumers.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – Since the 1990 s, {{there has}} been a {{discussion}} about the use of weather index-based insurance, also called weather derivatives, as a new instrument to hedge against volumetric risks in agriculture. It particularly differs from other insurance schemes by pay-offs being related to objectively measurable weather variables. Due to the absence of individual farm yield time series, the hedging effectiveness of weather index-based insurance is often estimated on the basis of aggregated farmdata. The authors expect that there are differences in the hedging effectiveness of insurance on the <b>aggregated</b> <b>level</b> and on the individual farm-level. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to estimate the magnitude of bias which occurs if the hedging effectiveness of weather index-based insurance is estimated on aggregated yield data. Design/methodology/approach – The study is based on yield time series from individual farms in central Germany and weather data provided by the German Meteorological Service. Insurance is structured as put-option on a cumulated precipitation index. The analysis includes the estimation of the hedging effectiveness of insurance on <b>aggregated</b> <b>level</b> and on individual farm-level. The hedging effectiveness is measured non-parametrically regarding the relative reduction of the standard deviation and the value at risk of wheat revenues. Findings – Findings indicate that the hedging effectiveness of a weather index-based insurance estimated on <b>aggregated</b> <b>level</b> is considerably higher than the realizable hedging effectiveness on the individual farm-level. This refers to: hedging effectiveness estimated on the <b>aggregated</b> <b>level</b> is higher than the mean of realized hedging effectiveness on the individual farm-level and almost every evaluated individual farm in the analysis realizes a lower hedging effectiveness than estimated on the <b>aggregated</b> <b>level</b> of the study area. Nevertheless, weather index-based insurance designed on the <b>aggregated</b> <b>level</b> can lead to a notable risk reduction for individual farms. Originality/value – To the authors’ knowledge, this paper is the first that analyzes the influence of crop yield aggregation with regard to the hedging effectiveness of weather index-based insurance...|$|R

This paper assesses the performances of load characterization at different <b>aggregated</b> <b>levels</b> by two spectral analysis techniques, using the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and discrete wavelet transform (DWT).

40|$|The {{main purpose}} {{in this paper}} is to study to what extent {{accessibility}} to R&D can explain patent production. Therefore a knowledge production function is estimated both on <b>aggregated</b> <b>level</b> and for different industrial sectors. The output of the knowledge production is the number patent applications in Swedish municipalities from 1994 to 1999. In order to account for the importance of proximity, the explanatory variables are expressed as accessibilities to university and company R&D. The total accessibility is then decomposed into local, intra-regional and inter-regional accessibility to R&D. As often is the case with R&D outputs, the regional distribution of patents is highly skewed with influential outliers. The estimations are therefore conducted with quantile regressions. The main results on <b>aggregated</b> <b>level</b> indicate that high accessibility (local) to company R&D has the greatest positive effects on patent production. The effects are statistically significant for municipalities with a patent production corresponding to the median and to quantiles above the median. Local accessibility to university R&D is only of importance for certain industrial sectors and not on <b>aggregated</b> <b>level.</b> There is also evidence that intra-regional accessibility to company R&D affects patent production positively. A conclusion is that concentrated R&D investments in companies situated in municipalities with a high patenting activity would not only gain the municipalities themselves, but also the patent production in other municipalities in the functional region. innovations; patents; R&D; knowledge production functions...|$|R
