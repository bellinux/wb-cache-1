5|$|After Against All Odds, the feud between Abyss and Judas Mesias ended, with Abyss {{disappearing from}} TNA after the February 14 episode of Impact!, when {{he removed his}} mask and left the arena.

5|$|Facekini: The facekini mask is <b>a</b> <b>mask</b> {{designed}} for swimmers and beachgoers which covers {{the head and}} reveals only the eyes, nose, and mouth. It was invented by Zhang Shifan, a former accountant from the coastal Chinese city of Qingdao.|$|E
50|$|At {{a simplistic}} level <b>a</b> {{wildcard}} <b>mask</b> {{can be thought}} of as <b>an</b> inverted subnet <b>mask.</b> For example, <b>a</b> subnet <b>mask</b> of 255.255.255.0 (binary equivalent = 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000) inverts to <b>a</b> wildcard <b>mask</b> of 0.0.0.255.|$|R

5|$|A comic book, Lagaan: The Story, {{along with}} two {{colouring}} books, <b>a</b> <b>mask</b> book and a cricket board game were subsequently released to the commercial market. The comic book, available in English and Hindi, was targeted at {{children between the ages}} of six and 14. At the book's launch, Aamir Khan said that they were keen to turn the film into a comic strip during the pre-production phase itself.|$|E
5|$|A large alcove {{close by}} in the garden, entered through a portal of grey Sussex marble, formed an amphitheatre that {{contained}} an effigy representing Truth crushing <b>a</b> <b>mask,</b> again probably the work of Roubiliac. It drew the visitor's attention towards two life-sized pictures by Francis Hayman, depicting a Christian and an Unbeliever as they died, set into compartments in the wall.|$|E

5|$|A wet bell, or open bell, {{is similar}} to a diving stage in concept, but has an air space, open to the water at the bottom in which the divers, or at least their heads, can shelter during ascent and descent. A wet bell {{provides}} more comfort and control than a stage and allows for longer time in the water. Wet bells are used for air and mixed gas, and divers can decompress using oxygen from <b>a</b> <b>mask</b> at 12m.|$|E
5|$|After the Morris {{family and}} Clay {{discover}} that the gates have been locked to prevent their escape, the monsters surround them. In anger, Lizzy tries to remove <b>a</b> <b>mask</b> {{from one of the}} monsters, which she discovers is actually the Horror's face. The Horrors explain that they are monsters, but that the visitors' experiences were part of a television show. As an apology, the monsters say that they will lead them towards a new car, but they are led to carnivorous animals.|$|E
5|$|Because an ASIC is (by definition) {{specific}} {{to a given}} application, it can be fully optimized for that application. As a result, for a given application, an ASIC tends to outperform a general-purpose computer. However, ASICs are created by UV photolithography. This process requires <b>a</b> <b>mask</b> set, which can be extremely expensive. <b>A</b> <b>mask</b> set can cost over a million US dollars. (The smaller the transistors required for the chip, the more expensive the mask will be.) Meanwhile, performance increases in general-purpose computing over time (as described by Moore's law) tend to wipe out these gains in {{only one or two}} chip generations. High initial cost, and the tendency to be overtaken by Moore's-law-driven general-purpose computing, has rendered ASICs unfeasible for most parallel computing applications. However, some have been built. One example is the PFLOPS RIKEN MDGRAPE-3 machine which uses custom ASICs for molecular dynamics simulation.|$|E

Mary Balogh won the Romantic Times Award for best new Regency writer in that year.|$|R

5|$|He {{broke his}} nose during {{training}} camp after {{engaging in a}} pickup game. The injury required surgery and he needed to wear <b>a</b> <b>mask.</b> On November 23, he made his NBA debut in a 109–88 loss against the Milwaukee Bucks, recording two points and three rebounds in 12 minutes. During his rookie season, he received multiple assignments to the Grand Rapids Drive, the Pistons' D-League affiliate.|$|E
5|$|Ibarra {{has also}} worked outside his native Mexico on {{multiple}} occasions, with his highest profile work being for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) in the United States, and New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW) in Japan.

Parents complained that their children were having nightmares and the BBC subsequently moved back the screening times.|$|E

5|$|In September 1987, Adams {{returned}} to NJPW {{with a couple}} of victories over Kenichi Oya. By February 1988, he began wearing <b>a</b> <b>mask</b> and going by the name The Midnight Soldier.

5|$|In early July the Mordecai gimmick {{was dropped}} and Fertig {{was sent back}} to OVW for more training. Fertig's return to OVW was also due to his {{involvement}} in a bar fight, and subsequent impending lawsuits meant that WWE decided to take Fertig off television. Fertig returned to OVW, wrestling under <b>a</b> <b>mask</b> as Vengeance, and competed only sporadically against wrestlers including Elijah Burke, Mark Henry, Johnny Jeter, and Matt Cappotelli. He was then soon released in July 2005.|$|E
5|$|Invader works incognito, often masked {{and largely}} at night.

40|$|Four-dot <b>masking</b> with <b>a</b> common onset <b>mask</b> was {{recently}} demonstrated in a fully attended and foveated target (Filmer, Mattingley & Dux, 2015). Here, we replicate and extend this finding by directly comparing <b>a</b> four-dot <b>mask</b> with <b>an</b> annulus <b>mask</b> while probing <b>masking</b> as <b>a</b> function of <b>mask</b> duration, and target-mask separation. Our {{results suggest that}} while <b>an</b> annulus <b>mask</b> operates via spatially local contour interactions, <b>a</b> four-dot <b>mask</b> operates through spatially global mechanisms. We also measure how the visual system’s representation of an oriented bar is impacted by <b>a</b> four-dot <b>mask,</b> and find that masking here does not degrade the precision of perceived targets, but instead appears to be driven exclusively by rendering the target completely invisible...|$|R
