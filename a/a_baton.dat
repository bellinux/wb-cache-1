5|$|The first {{post-mortem}} {{concluded that}} Tomlinson {{had suffered a}} heart attack, but a week later The Guardian published video of Harwood, a constable with London's Metropolitan Police Service, striking Tomlinson on the leg with <b>a</b> <b>baton,</b> then pushing him to the ground. Tomlinson was not a protester, {{and at the time}} he was struck was trying to make his way home through the police cordons. He walked away after the incident, but collapsed and died minutes later.|$|E
5|$|Relay {{races are}} the only track and field event in which a team of runners {{directly}} compete against other teams. Typically, a team {{is made up of}} four runners of the same sex. Each runner completes their specified distance (referred to as a leg) before handing over <b>a</b> <b>baton</b> to a teammate, who then begins their leg upon receiving the baton. There is usually a designated area where athletes must exchange the baton. Teams may be disqualified if they fail to complete the change within the area, or if the baton is dropped during the race. A team may also be disqualified if its runners are deemed to have wilfully impeded other competitors.|$|E

5|$|The first Guardian video shows {{one officer}} lunge at Tomlinson from behind, strike {{him across the}} legs with <b>a</b> <b>baton</b> and push his back, causing him to fall. On 8 April Channel4 News {{released}} their own footage, which showed the officer's arm swing back to head height before bringing it down to hit Tomlinson on the legs with the baton. Another video obtained by The Guardian on 21 April shows Tomlinson standing by a bicycle rack, hands in his pockets, when the police approach him. After he is hit, he can be seen scraping along the ground {{on the right side}} of his forehead; eyewitnesses spoke of hearing a noise as his head hit the ground.|$|E
5|$|The {{statue of}} James II is an outdoor bronze {{sculpture}} {{located in the}} front garden of the National Gallery at Trafalgar Square in London, United Kingdom. Probably inspired by French statues of the same period, it depicts James II of England as a Roman emperor, wearing Roman armour and a laurel wreath (traditionally awarded to a victorious Roman commander). It originally also depicted him holding <b>a</b> <b>baton.</b> It was produced by the workshop of Grinling Gibbons, though probably not by Gibbons himself. The statue has been relocated several times since it was first erected in {{the grounds of the}} old Palace of Whitehall in 1686, only two years before James II was deposed.|$|E
5|$|Track {{and field}} events {{are divided into}} three broad categories: track events, field events, and {{combined}} events. The majority of athletes tend to specialise in just one event (or event type) {{with the aim of}} perfecting their performances, although the aim of combined events athletes is to become proficient in a number of disciplines. Track events involve running on a track over a specified distances and—in the case of the hurdling and steeplechase events—obstacles may be placed on the track. There are also relay races in which teams of athletes run and pass on <b>a</b> <b>baton</b> to their team member {{at the end of a}} certain distance.|$|E
5000|$|Some police {{may prefer}} to carry <b>a</b> fixed <b>baton</b> {{due to the}} greater {{intimidation}} it may provide. Similarly, <b>a</b> fixed <b>baton</b> serves better as a conspicuous symbol of authority (i.e., [...] "badge of office") than <b>a</b> collapsed expandable <b>baton.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Due to its design, <b>a</b> {{side handle}} <b>baton</b> is {{generally}} {{used in a}} more defensive and less offensive manner than <b>a</b> straight <b>baton,</b> and thus it is less likely for an officer to [...] "instinctively" [...] use <b>a</b> side-handle <b>baton</b> as <b>a</b> simple bludgeon and direct indiscriminate strikes against a suspect. Also, the typically defensive stance the side-handle baton is used with is generally believed to present a more community-friendly image than <b>a</b> straight <b>baton.</b>|$|R
5000|$|More {{training}} {{is required for}} an officer to fully utilize the potential of <b>a</b> side-handle <b>baton</b> compared to <b>a</b> straight <b>baton.</b> Its use is not as instinctive as the straight batons.|$|R
5|$|A {{few days}} later, he {{finished}} {{fifth in the}} 200m final {{with a time of}} 19.98seconds, some distance off the winner Usain Bolt who had broken the world record. However, it transpired that both the silver and bronze medalists (Churandy Martina of the Netherlands Antilles and American Wallace Spearmon) had stepped out of their lanes thus they were disqualified. As a result, Dix received his second Olympic bronze medal. Further disqualifications occurred in the heats of the Olympic 4×100 meter relay race: Darvis Patton and Tyson Gay misjudged <b>a</b> <b>baton</b> pass, causing the American team to be eliminated and spoiling any chance of Dix receiving a relay medal. He finished the Olympics as the only American sprinter to medal in two individual events. Dix closed the season with two sub-10 second runs at the Weltklasse and Athletissima meetings, finishing second to a Jamaican on both occasions (Bolt and Asafa Powell).|$|E
5|$|The {{portrait}} {{represents a}} man, estimated {{by some to}} be 45years of age, standing turned to the viewer's right, looking at the viewer with a commanding expression. In his uplifted right hand he holds <b>a</b> <b>baton</b> with a golden cap. He has a thick moustache and wears a high fur cap on which there is a golden chain with precious stones and a coat of arms in the center. From his ear a large pear-shaped pearl hangs from a golden pendant earring. He wears a reddish-brown mantle with a broad fur collar and, over it, a heavy gold chain from which the order of three horse tails, set in rich pendants, hangs on his right shoulder. A full light from the left falls {{on the right side of}} his face. The background is brownish-grey.|$|E
5|$|By September 10, the {{prospect}} of securing <b>a</b> <b>Baton</b> Rouge location to host the Hornets was fading {{as a result of}} the facilities being utilized for hurricane related relief operations. Numerous cities inquired about hosting the franchise for the season, including Kansas City, Louisville, Nashville, Oklahoma City and San Diego. During this period, Oklahoma City announced that it was the favored choice to serve as the temporary home of the franchise, although by mid-September SMG announced that the New Orleans arena could potentially be ready for occupancy by the All-Star Game break. However, by late September the Hornets finalized a move to Oklahoma City, where 35 games would be played at the Ford Center, as well as six in Baton Rouge at the Pete Maravich Assembly Center. Additionally, it was announced that three of the games in March could be moved to New Orleans if the arena repairs were complete. At the same time, the NBA also announced the team would be referred to officially as the New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets, and that the deal reached with Oklahoma City would allow for the team to return for the 2006–07 season, if necessary.|$|E
