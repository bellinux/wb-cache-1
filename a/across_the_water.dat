5|$|St Mawes Castle is {{situated}} on a headland over the Carrock Roads, overlooked by higher {{land to the}} rear. At {{the top of the}} site is the entrance to the castle, the high-level gun batteries and the 16th-century Henrician Castle; the terraced site slopes down to the water, where gun batteries and the 16th-century blockhouse look out <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E
5|$|Storm petrels {{are small}} birds which {{spend most of}} their lives at sea, coming ashore only to breed. They feed on planktonic {{crustaceans}} and small fish picked from the surface, typically while hovering or pattering <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b> Their flight is fluttering and sometimes bat-like.|$|E
5|$|On August 27, 1776, British troops {{under the}} command of General William Howe flanked and {{defeated}} the American army at the Battle of Long Island. Howe moved his forces and pinned the Americans down at Brooklyn Heights, with the East River to the American rear. On the night of August 29, General George Washington, Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army, evacuated his entire army of 9,000 men and their equipment <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> to Manhattan.|$|E

5|$|The bull {{appears to}} have had a sacred role in a number of Celtic cults. The animal was viewed {{positively}} by the Celts as an image of fertility and abundance; one tribe, the Taurini, even adopted the bull's name. It is unknown how it came to be associated with bodies of water {{in the form of the}} water bull, but historian and symbologist Charles Milton Smith has suggested that such mythological creatures might originate with the water spouts that can form over the surface of Scottish lochs, which can give the impression of a living form as they move <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E
5|$|Defeated at Lae, the Japanese {{pulled back}} to Finschhafen, which the Americans and Australians chose {{as the site}} of their next offensive. On 21 September an assault force under Barbey left Buna, escorted by US destroyers {{including}} Mahan, and stopped at Lae to pick up an Australian infantry brigade. Additional US destroyers were attached to the force, preceding the convoy to the rendezvous point. On 22 September, before daylight, the amphibious force stormed the beach at Finschhafen; by noon, all troops were ashore. As the destroyers began to withdraw from the area, ten Japanese torpedo planes winged <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>water,</b> targeting Mahan and five other US destroyers. The ships returned fire, shooting down eight of the ten planes; the remaining two escaped. This scrimmage ended without any hits by enemy planes. By 2 October, Finschhafen was {{in the hands of the}} Allies.|$|E
5|$|Improvements {{were carried}} out between 1852 and 1856 {{at a cost of}} over £6,725. The keep was adapted to support 32-pounder (14.5kg) guns, the seaward-facing bastions and curtain walls were {{reinforced}} with brick casemates and new gun positions, and the moat was deepened to protect against any surprise attack. Two batteries were built to the west and east of the castle, protected by shingle and earth and linked to the old castle by covered passageways called caponiers; a defensible barrack block was built beside the western battery, to provide further protection against any attack from the land. The result was that Hurst was re-established as a powerful fortification, equipped with fourteen 32-pounder guns, fifteen 8-inch (203mm) shell guns and two 32-pounder carronades; in wartime, these required a team of 440 men, with a peacetime garrison of 105 soldiers. Fort Albert was built <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> on the Isle of Wight to provide supporting fire. The old inn was first reused as the garrison canteen and then demolished.|$|E

5|$|The heavy dagger-like bill is evenly tapered and greyish, {{sometimes}} {{having a}} black tip. The bill colour and angle distinguish this species from the yellow-billed loon. The neck {{is short and}} thick. It swims very low in the water, with sometimes only its head held above and horizontal to water. It must run <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> surface to get in flight. During flight, its head is slightly lower than its body, with its feet trailing behind. It has a skeletal structure {{made up of a}} number of solid bones (this is usual for the Gaviiformes and penguins but unlike most flying birds which have bones with extensive pneumatization, hollow and filled with air to make the lighter), which adds weight but helps in diving.|$|E
5|$|The {{stretch of}} water known as Carrick Roads {{at the mouth}} of the River Fal was an {{important}} anchorage serving shipping arriving from the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. A small gun tower, called the Little Dennis Blockhouse, was built in 1539 overlooking the entrance, and plans were made to protect the anchorage further with five additional castles. In the event, only two of these were constructed, Pendennis and St Mawes Castle, positioned on each side of Carrick Roads and able to provide overlapping fire <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b> John Killigrew, a prominent member of the local Cornish gentry, probably oversaw the construction of Pendennis; it was built on his land and he was appointed as its first captain. Pendennis Castle cost £5,614 to construct.|$|E
5|$|During the fighting, the Hòa Hảo {{attempted}} {{to help the}} Bình Xuyên by attacking towns and government forces in their Mekong Delta heartland. Ba Cụt's men, who had also been angered by the recent arrest of some colleagues, blockaded the Mekong and Bassac rivers and laid siege to various towns, including Sa Đéc, Long Xuyên and Châu Đốc, stifling the regional economy. The Hòa Hảo shut down several important regional roads and stopped the flow of agricultural produce from the nation's most fertile region into the capital, causing food prices to rise by 50%, as meat and vegetables became scarce. Ba Cụt then attacked a battalion of VNA troops south of Sa Đéc. Soon after, they retreated to a Hòa Hảo citadel {{on the banks of}} the Bassac. After reinforcing their base, the Hòa Hảo proceeded to fire mortars <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> into the city of Cần Thơ, which stood on the opposite side of the river. During this period, the United Front publicly accused Diệm of trying to bribe Ba Cụt with 100 million piasters.|$|E
