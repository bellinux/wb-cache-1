Many Achaean heroes {{did not return to}} their homes, but died or founded colonies outside the Greek mainland. The most famous returns are those of Odysseus, whose wanderings are narrated in the Odyssey, and Agamemnon, whose murder at the hands of his wife Clytemnestra was portrayed in Greek tragedy.|$|E

500|$|Jatakas {{are stories}} about the Buddha {{before he was born}} as Prince Siddhartha. [...] They <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> that tell about the {{previous}} lives of the Buddha, in both human and animal form. The future Buddha may appear in them as a king, an outcast, a god, an elephant—but, in whatever form, he exhibits some virtue that the tale thereby inculcates. Avadanas are similar to jatakas, but the main figure is not the Bodhisattva himself. The saintly deeds in avadanas are attributed to other legendary persons. Jatakas and avadanas are treated in one and the same series in the reliefs of Borobudur.|$|E

[...] Jarrard further described this as an attempt to move away from the story of the Master Chief, the central character of the franchise, and focus instead on what they believed to be the core themes that lay behind the game universe, such as maintaining hope in the face of overwhelming odds and humanity's struggle for survival; themes that extended beyond [...] "...a genetically enhanced super soldier picking up two guns and kicking some alien butt." [...] The four stories that ended up in the final publication were [...] "the most interesting to , and the writers of [...] ". Although Bungie created the story arcs present in the Halo Graphic Novel, the studio described the importance of providing a framework for each story that the various artists and writers could tell without jeopardizing their own voice. Artist Simon Bisley said that [...] "the stress was to make the characters look very much as they do in the game. Beyond that point I was given free rein to interpret the script and the action" [...] based on what was given to the artists and writers.|$|E
