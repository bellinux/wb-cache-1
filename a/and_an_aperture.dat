50|$|The Model 68 was {{conceived}} {{as a replacement for}} the slow-selling Model 60A Target model which was designed for the competition market. The Model 68 was basically a Model 67 with a hooded front sight <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>aperture</b> rear sight. The Model 68 was effectively rendered redundant when its special sights became optional on the Model 67 in August 1943, but the rifle was not actually discontinued until 1944, and deliveries from inventory continued into 1945.|$|E
5000|$|Suppose a {{photographer}} has a flash device with a guide number of 44 (m)&thinsp;/&thinsp;144 (ft), [...] sets the camera’s aperture to , {{and wants to}} know the required flash-to-subject distance; he merely divides the guide number by 4. Thus, a subject 11 meters or 36 feet away will be correctly illuminated (GN&thinsp;44 (m)&thinsp;÷&thinsp;&thinsp;=&thinsp;11 m, and GN&thinsp;144 (ft)&thinsp;÷&thinsp;&thinsp;=&thinsp;36 ft). For the same guide number <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>aperture</b> of , the light source must be 5.5 meters or 18 feet from the subject.|$|E
5000|$|The Starflash accepts type 127 {{film and}} slides, in {{both black and}} white and color <b>and</b> {{contains}} <b>an</b> <b>aperture</b> adjustment below the lens to accommodate the various film types supported. The images generated on film are 4 cm x 4 cm (1 5/8" [...] x 1 5/8").|$|R
50|$|For example, <b>a</b> wider <b>aperture</b> is {{used for}} lower light <b>and</b> <b>a</b> lower <b>aperture</b> for more light. If a subject is in motion, then a high shutter speed may be needed. A tripod can also be helpful in that it enables a slower shutter speed to be used.|$|R

50|$|The bunker {{would have}} been linked with the main railway line from Saint Pol to Abbeville, {{enabling}} trains carrying V-1s and supplies to enter {{the body of the}} structure. It was, in effect, a fortified railway tunnel with a storage area capable of housing 150 missiles <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>aperture</b> from which they {{would have been}} launched. Although Allied reconstructions imagined a single launch ramp, {{it is possible that the}} Germans intended to install two parallel ramps to increase the rate at which V-1s could be fired.|$|E
50|$|The {{other similar}} design is the Trinitron. The Trinitron {{combined}} the vertical stripes of the beam-index and Chromatron tubes {{with a new}} single-gun three-beam cathode <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>aperture</b> grille shadow mask. The result was a design with the mechanical simplicity of the shadow mask design and the bright images of the beam-index system. Trinitron was a major product for Sony for several decades, representing the high-point of conventional color TV displays until the widespread introduction of plasma displays and LCD televisions in the 21st century.|$|E
50|$|With the Maxxum line, {{the heavy}} duty metal bodies of earlier Minoltas were {{abandoned}} {{in favor of}} lighter and less expensive plastics. The Maxxum 7000, {{the most popular of}} the new Maxxums, introduced the innovation of arrow buttons for setting aperture and shutter speed, rather than a shutter speed dial on the body <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>aperture</b> ring on the lens. That way, the only control necessary on the lens is the manual focus ring (plus the zoom ring in the case of zoom lenses).|$|E
5000|$|The sellar {{diaphragm}} is {{the smallest}} dural infolding <b>and</b> is <b>a</b> circular sheet of dura that is suspended between the clinoid processes, forming a partial roof over the hypophysial fossa.
