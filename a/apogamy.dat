40|$|The {{life cycle}} of land plants {{alternates}} between the haploid gametophyte and the diploid sporophyte generations. Asexual reproductive strategies, that bypass meiosis and fertilization, have evolved in diverse land plant taxa. <b>Apogamy</b> is one such strategy that produces a sporophyte directly from a gametophyte cell. The genes that drive the process of <b>apogamy</b> are unknown. Knowledge of these genes and their functions will {{provide insight into the}} evolution of asexual reproduction, the sporophyte body plan and the alternation of generations in land plants. My Ph. D. research has focused on identifying the genes function in <b>apogamy</b> commitment, and understanding the functions of their counterparts in angiosperms. First, I successfully induced <b>apogamy</b> from the fern Ceratopteris richardii and discovered that the gametophytes begin to become committed to <b>apogamy</b> after 10 days of culture on inductive medium. I then created a cDNA library that represents genes with enhanced expression during commitment. Comparison of the Gene Ontology terms mapped to this cDNA library with that of the gametophyte transcriptome of the fern Pteridium aquilinum showed that this library is enriched in genes that function in stress response and metabolism. This library contains many sequences whose homologues in Arabidopsis are specifically expressed or upregulated in flower organs or seed structures, both of which are absent in ferns. One of these genes, UNC 93 -like, is expressed in the eggs of C. richardii gametophytes, as evidenced by in situ hybridization. Functional egg cells are implicated as necessary for C. richardii gametophytes to undergo <b>apogamy.</b> In Arabidopsis, an AtUNC 93 -like mutant, which produces a partial AtUNC 93 -like transcript, has vegetative and reproductive defects. Embryo abortion and gametophyte lethality contribute to a small seed set in these plants. Reciprocal crosses indicate that the mutant allele does not affect gametophyte function but cause a maternal failure to maintain viability of all gametophytes. Thus, the AtUNC 93 -like gene is necessary for normal sporophyte vegetative growth and reproductive success, but is dispensable for the direct function of gametophytes. My research has provided insight into the mechanisms that induce <b>apogamy</b> in a fern. The <b>apogamy</b> library is a valuable resource for future investigations into <b>apogamy...</b>|$|E

40|$|Land {{plants have}} {{distinct}} developmental programs in haploid (gametophyte) and diploid (sporophyte) generations. Although usually the two programs strictly alternate at fertilization and meiosis, one {{program can be}} induced during the other program. In a process called <b>apogamy,</b> cells of the gametophyte other than the egg cell initiate sporophyte development. Here, we report for the moss Physcomitrella patens that <b>apogamy</b> resulted from deletion of the gene orthologous to the Arabidopsis thaliana CURLY LEAF (PpCLF), which encodes a component of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC 2). In the deletion lines, a gametophytic vegetative cell frequently {{gave rise to a}} sporophyte-like body. This body grew indeterminately from an apical cell with the character of a sporophytic pluripotent stem cell but did not form a sporangium. Furthermore, with continued culture, the sporophyte-like body branched. Sporophyte branching is almost unknown among extant bryophytes. When PpCLF was expressed in the deletion lines once the sporophyte-like bodies had formed, pluripotent stem cell activity was arrested and a sporangium-like organ formed. Supported by the observed pattern of PpCLF expression, these results demonstrate that, in the gametophyte, PpCLF represses initiation of a sporophytic pluripotent stem cell and, in the sporophyte, represses that stem cell activity and induces reproductive organ development. In land plants, branching, along with indeterminate apical growth and delayed initiation of spore-bearing reproductive organs, were conspicuous innovations for the evolution of a dominant sporophyte plant body. Our study provides insights into the role of PRC 2 gene regulation for sustaining evolutionary innovation in land plants. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|The {{events that}} {{accompany}} sporogenesis in the apogamous fern Dryopteris borreri parallel those seen in sexually reproducing ferns. Organelles dedifferentiate and redifferentiate, {{and form a}} discrete band across the equator of dyads; nuclear vacuoles and lipid spherosomes appear during prophase, and the {{major part of the}} ribosome population is removed and subsequently replaced during meiosis. Similar events have been found to occur during sporogenesis in mosses, gymno-sperms and angiosperms, and are therefore characteristic of the meiotic transition from sporophyte to gametophyte, {{even in the absence of}} a transition from diplophase to haplophase. The novel aspects of meiosis in D. borreri are largely those connected with the restitution event that precedes meiosis 1 and serves to maintain the sporophytic chromosome number throughout the life cycle of this fern.

40|$|The Pteris cadieri complex {{displays}} extensive morphological {{variation and}} seems to have originated through hybridization. However, {{the members of this}} complex reproduce by <b>apogamy,</b> which usually limits genetic variation. To evaluate the hypotheses of hybrid origins, the pattern of evolution in this species complex is reconstructed. Multiple methodologies were used. Diploids, triploids, and tetraploids were identified by chromosome counts and flow cytometry. Nuclear DNA markers (cytosolic phosphoglucose isomerase gene, PgiC) were used, together with chloroplast DNA markers (atpB-rbcL spacer and rbcL gene) to infer the biparental and maternal lineages of the Pteris cadieri complex. The three cpDNA haplotype groups and five PgiC alleles found in this study indicate that the evolution of the Pteris cadieri complex has been extremely reticulate. Up to 11 taxa belonging to eight morphs were identified. By comparing genetic variation in the Pteris cadieri in two independent areas, Hainan and Taiwan, we inferred that hybridization has occurred independently in different areas. Furthermore, we found evidence for phenological divergence (evergreen and deciduous) within Taiwan. We propose that the Pteris cadieri complex originated from different genetic lineages through multiple hybridizations in different geographical areas, leading to its present morphological diversity...|$|E
40|$|In land plants, two {{distinct}} generations, gametophyte and sporophyte, alternate {{to complete the}} life cycle. Sporophytes undergo meiosis to produce spores, from which gametophytes develop. Gametophytes produce gametes, which participate in fertilization to produce the zygote, the first cell of the sporophyte generation. In addition to this sexual reproduction pathway, some fern species can undergo apospory or <b>apogamy,</b> processes that bypass meiosis or fertilization, respectively, to alternate between the two generations without changing the chromosome number. Apospory is inducible in the laboratory in various fern species simply by altering the sugar level in the media. In sporophytes induced to undergo apospory, sporophyte regeneration is also observed. The ratio of aposporous gametophytes to regenerated sporophytes varies, {{in a manner consistent}} with being dependent on sugar level. Whereas the sugar signaling pathway is yet to be elucidated in lower plants, in angiosperms it has been shown to play a regulatory role in controlling essential processes including flowering and embryo development, which give rise to the gametophyte and the next sporophyte generation, respectively. Here, we present evidence for the role of different sugar levels on the balance of apospory and regeneration in the fern Ceratopteris richardii. The demonstration of crosstalk between sugar signaling and the hormone ethylene signaling in angiosperms prompted us to test the effects of this hormone in combination with sugar on apospory vs. regeneration. These results provide insight into how a group of redifferentiating cells determines which generation to become and lay the groundwork for further analysis of this asexual pathway...|$|E
40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{differentiation}} of the gametophyte and sporophyte of Pteridophyta, conducted through the culture, on nutritive media, of the green, incompletely differentiated sporangia and spores, exhibits {{a variety of}} peculiarities. Whereas {{in the case of}} the spore culture, a single prothallus is usually obtained out of the spore, {{in the case of the}} green sporangia (sori) culture, a group (colony) is obtained out of a single explant, a group which is made up of numerous prothalli. The agarized medium ensures a much better physical support for forming larger colonies. The secondary gametophytes can be formed through: the branching out of the prothallic filaments (each ramification representing the intial stage for the development of a new prothallus); the elongation of the cells in the apical area of the gametophyte, (which represent the initial cells of the new prothalli); out of the cells located in the base area of the prothalli, (cells which also function as prothalian initial); out of ramifications of the prothalli. The formation of the sporophyte may be the result of amphimixis, e. g. in Cystopteris fragilis, or of apomixis (<b>apogamy)</b> in Cyrtomium falcatum and Phegopteris connectilis. In the amphimixic species, the embryo is formed after three months from the culture initiation. What is characteristic of the apogamous species is the presence of the tracheides in the gametophyte, and the absence of the root in the first stages of development. The culture of green sporangia on agarized media is recommended, due to the fact that a very large number of gametophytes, and subsequently little plants, are formed. </p...|$|E
40|$|In {{dealing with}} the {{problems}} associated with apomictic ferns, {{it is not so much}} a question of defining and delimiting mor-phological discontinuities, but one of dis-covering and defining biological discon-tinuities. Whereas it is assumed that morphological discontinuities of suffi-cient magnitude to delimit taxa have a genetic basis, with apomictic taxa it is more a question of determining biological or genetic discontinuities behind which one must then evaluate the morphological differences in order to make taxonomic determinations. In dealing with vascular plants we often are faced with a covert, or sometimes overt, convention-at least at the floristic level-that in the final analysis the dif-ferent taxa must be separable with a 10 X hand lens or else we are splitting the pie too thinly. This has its advantages as long as one is willing to compromise and gloss over some of the more complicated prob-lems in evolutionary diversity. If one wishes to classify on the basis of conven-ience, one could make a case for it. But if one wishes to base a classification on phylogeny, however imperfect our knowl-edge or our ability to trace it, we have a different problem. Here I shall identify myself as considering it of more scientific validity to attempt phylogenetic classifi-cation, conceding that we may never arrive at a completely satisfactory conclu-sion and that this philosophy will lead to periodic changes in the "system.

Both results independently eliminate <b>apogamy</b> as an explanation for these results. Many interesting observations were made on amoebal growth during progress towards synthesising an axenic medium for amoebae. New mutagenic techniques devised to mutagenise amoebae all failed to increase mutagenic rate. An independent check {{on the work of}} Haugli using his method confirmed that (1) mutation rate could be enhanced from 10 to 100 fold by ultraviolet light with the synergistic effect of caffeine, (2) the maximum expression of mutations under these conditions occumed after 30 hours. Using this method 4 mutants affecting the amoebal-plasmodial transition were isolated. These amoebae fail to undergo the necessary developmental switch and do not produce plasmodia in clones. Genetic analysis showed them to be recessive, functionally different and, in the detailed analysis of one of these mutants, freely recombining with all other genetic markers including mt. This groundwork showed the feasibility of genetic analysis of a developmental process in great detail. A review of developmental genetics was made. The processes of cell fusion, nuclear fusion and mitosis in other organisms was discussed. Cell fusion seems to be a rare but important biological event. Nuclear fusion of interphase nuclei is restricted to gametic cells. All syncytial cells have a closed mitosis but not all cells with a closed mitosis are syncytial.

We studied the morphogenesis of the gametophyte, and the morphology of the young sporophytes of four species: P. cretica, P. ensiformis, P. multifida and P. vittata, together with a palynological analysis that includes the ability of spores to germinate. Gametophytes were obtained trough in vitro culture techniques with agar-gellified Knudson medium. Young sporophytes were placed in earth-sand (3 : 1) sterile substrate. We used light and SEM microscopy. Triletes spores predominate, but monolete, tetralete, {{and other types of}} apertura are often found. The viability of spores is not affected by the variation, so the term spore polymorphism is applied to the condition occurring among these species. Spore polymorphism is similar in P. cretica and P. multifida. Germination occurs following the Vittaria type, 3 - 7 days after the sowing. Filamentous, 3 - 5 celled gametophytes were found in P. cretica, P. multifida and P. vittata, and 7 - 9 celled in P. ensiformis. Development of gametophytes takes place following Adiantum type and eratopteris type.
