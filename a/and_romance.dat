5|$|Candide is characterised by its sarcastic tone {{as well as}} by its erratic, fantastical and {{fast-moving}} plot. A picaresque novel with a story {{similar to}} that of a more serious coming-of-age narrative (Bildungsroman), it parodies many adventure <b>and</b> <b>romance</b> clichés, the struggles of which are caricatured in a tone that is mordantly matter-of-fact. Still, the events discussed are often based on historical happenings, such as the Seven Years' War and the 1755 Lisbon earthquake. As philosophers of Voltaire's day contended with the problem of evil, so too does Candide in this short novel, albeit more directly and humorously. Voltaire ridicules religion, theologians, governments, armies, philosophies, and philosophers through allegory; most conspicuously, he assaults Leibniz and his optimism.|$|E

Only three domestic productions were released in 1948; the last was another SPFC production, entitled Anggrek Bulan (Moon Orchid), which was also directed by Andjar.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, American musical theater {{was a major}} source for popular songs, many of which {{influenced}} blues, jazz, country, and other extant styles of popular music. The center of development for this style was in New York City, where the Broadway theatres became among the most renowned venues in the city. Theatrical composers and lyricists like the brothers George and Ira Gershwin created a uniquely American theatrical style that used American vernacular speech and music. Musicals featured popular songs and fast-paced plots that often revolved around love <b>and</b> <b>romance.</b>|$|E
5|$|Terang Boelan was a {{commercial}} success {{in both the}} Indies and abroad, earning 200,000 Straits dollars in British Malaya.
