40|$|International audienceThe genus Axinella is {{difficult}} to define {{on the basis of}} morphological characters and includes a heterogeneous assemblage of species. Several previous authors have suspected the polyphyly of both this genus and the family <b>Axinellidae.</b> To clarify the phylogeny of <b>Axinellidae</b> and Axinella, we propose a new hypothesis based on two molecular markers. In our analyses, <b>Axinellidae</b> and Axinella are polyphyletic assemblages. The 15 species of <b>Axinellidae</b> in our dataset belong to five clades and the nine species of Axinella to three clades. One Axinella clade, named Axinella(p), contains the type-species of the genus: A. polypoides (plus A. aruensis, A. dissimilis, A. infundibuliformis and A. vaceleti). A new clade, Cymbaxinella(p), is proposed, following the PhyloCode, it includes C. damicornis, C. verrucosa, C. corrugate and C cantharella. The species Axinella cannabina is reallocated to a clade named Acanthella(p). The clades Agelas(p) and Cymbaxinella(p) constitute a new clade: Agelasida(p). Few morphological, biochemical and secondary structures characters support these groupings, highlighting the need for new characters for such problematic sponge groups. This work is an attempt to build a framework for the phylogeny of taxa allocated to Axinella and <b>Axinellidae</b> in the traditional classification. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

50|$|Morrow & Cárdenas (2015) {{propose a}} {{revision}} of the Demospongiae higher taxa classification, essentially based on molecular data of the last ten years. Some demosponge subclasses and orders are actually polyphyletic or {{should be included in}} other orders, so that Morrow and Cárdenas (2015) officially propose to abandon certain names: these are the Ceractinomorpha, Tetractinomorpha, Halisarcida, Verticillitida, Lithistida, Halichondrida and Hadromerida. Instead, they recommend the use of three subclasses: Verongimorpha, Keratosa and Heteroscleromorpha. They retain seven (Agelasida, Chondrosiida, Dendroceratida, Dictyoceratida, Haplosclerida, Poecilosclerida, Verongiida) of the 13 orders from Systema Porifera. They recommend to resurrect or upgrade six order names (<b>Axinellida,</b> Merliida, Spongillida, Sphaerocladina, Suberitida, Tetractinellida). Finally, they create seven new orders (Bubarida, Desmacellida, Polymastiida, Scopalinida, Clionaida, Tethyida, Trachycladida). These added to the recently created orders (Biemnida and Chondrillida) make a total of 22 orders in the revised classification. These changes are now implemented in the World Porifera Database part of the World Register of Marine Species.|$|R
40|$|Extracts of 19 of 24 {{species of}} sponge {{collected}} from Queensland. Australia, inhibited {{the growth of}} test microorganisms in in-vitro assays. A similar result has been obtained by earlier workers for extracts of species of sponge obtained from temperate waters. Some of the extracts, including extracts of Thorecta vasiforis, Arenochalina mirabilis and Acanthella kleutha, showed activity against bacterial strains that was comparable with that exhibited by penicillin G and streptomycin against these strains. Gram-positive bacteria were expecially sensitive to many extracts. Little activity was exhibited by any extract against four species of fungi tested. Some of the extracts were markedly toxic {{to one or more}} of the test organisms (a fish, a crustacean and a hydroid) used, but no clear pattern linking toxicity to these organisms with antimicrobial properties of the extracts emerged. In general, there bas a negative correlation between antimicrobial activity and surface-fouling, raising the possibility of using freedom from surface-fouling as an indicator of antimicrobial activity. Four of five encrusting species from the undersides of coral boulders showed antimicrobial activity. This study confirmed the value of using methanol-toluene extracts in field-based screening programmes, but emphasised the need to use additional extracting media such as methylene chloride in order to augment the number of antimicrobial compounds detected. There are indications that antimicrobial activity may be widespread in the order Dictyoceratida, in the order Verongida and in the order <b>Axinellida,</b> but sporadic in other orders of Porifera...|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{consists}} of a phylogenetic and historical biogeographic analysis of the North Atlantic shallow-water Haplosclerida (Porifera, Demospongiae), and of the Chalinidae in particular. The monophyly of the Haplosclerida is founded on five assumed apomorphous (derived) characters. Six related outgroups, viz. the Esperiopsidae, Desmacellidae, Mycalidae, Myxillidae, Microcionidae, and <b>Axinellida</b> s. l. {{have been used for}} establishing the character polarity within the Haplosclerida. A key to the haplosclerid families, the Chalinidae, Niphatidae, Callyspongiidae, Petrosiidae and Oceanapiidae, and a hypothesis on the phylogenetic relationships of the families is presented. Within the Chalinidae, eight monophyletic species groups are distinguished on the basis of assumed apomorphous characters. Two of these groups belong to the nominal genera Acervochalina and Dendroxea, the other six to the genus Haliclona. A key to the species groups and a hypothesis on the phylogenetic relationships of the groups is presented. Subsequently, each individual species group is analyzed phylogenetically. The obtained species cladograms and the distributional types of the species within the North Atlantic Ocean are used {{for the construction of a}} general area cladogram, representing a hypothesis on the historical relationships of areas of endemism in the North Atlantic Ocean. The analysis is based on the component-compatibility and parsimony methods as developed by Zandee & Roos (1987). For generation of the general area cladogram the computer program CAFCA (Zandee, 1987) has been used. Three main vicariance events can be recognized from the general area cladogram, viz. the Cretaceous separation of South America and Africa, a subsequent separation of the Boreal area from the south-eastern part of the North Atlantic and the Mediterranean, and the Miocene (Messinian) salinity crisis in the Mediterranean basin. The individual species area cladograms are evaluated in order to establish which show “vicariance fit” with the general area cladogram, and which species have deviating distribution patterns needing the most parsimonious “ad hoc” explanations, like dispersal or extinction...|$|R
40|$|Using a multicharacter {{approach}} and numerical cladistic computer programs a phylogenetic analysis {{is made of}} a newly defined order Halichondrida (which includes all Halichondrida {{and parts of the}} Axinellida sensu Lévi, 1973), with emphasis on the newly defined family Halichondriidae (which includes the families Halichondriidae and Hymeniacidonidae sensu Lévi, 1973, and some genera formerly assigned to the <b>Axinellidae</b> and Desmoxyidae). The newly defined order consists of the “old” families Axinellidae/Bubaridae and Desmoxyidae, a “new” family Dictyonellidae (containing Dictyonella, Acanthella, Liosina and Dactylella), and the new concept of the family Halichondriidae. On the basis of numerous specimens, including many type and other original material {{from all parts of the}} world oceans, the latter group has been analyzed in depth. Next to classical morphological characters also biochemical data (secondary metabolites) were used. This resulted in the recognition of several discrete generic groups, viz. Axinyssa + Collocalypta, Myrmekioderma + Didiscus, Spongosorites, Topsentia + Epipolasis + Petromica, Ciocalypta + Amorphinopsis, and + Hymeniacidon Halichondria.

40|$|Sponges (phylum Porifera) are the phylogenetically oldest {{metazoan}} animals, their evolution {{dating back}} to 600 million years ago. Here we demonstrate that sponges express ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity, which converts NAD+ into cyclic ADP-ribose, a potent and universal intracellular Ca 2 + mobilizer. In Axinella polypoides (Demospongiae, <b>Axinellidae),</b> ADP-ribosyl cyclase was activated by temperature increases {{by means of an}} abscisic acid-induced, protein kinase A-dependent mechanism. The thermosensor triggering this signaling cascade was a heat-activated cation channel. Elucidation of the complete thermosensing pathway in sponges highlights a number of features conserved in higher organisms: (i) the cation channel thermoreceptor, sensitive to heat, mechanical stress, phosphorylation, and anesthetics, shares all of the functional characteristics of the mammalian heat-activated background K+ channel responsible for central and peripheral thermosensing; (ii) involvement of the phytohormone abscisic acid and cyclic ADP-ribose as its second messenger is reminiscent of the drought stress signaling pathway in plants. These results suggest an ancient evolutionary origin of this stress-signaling cascade in a common precursor of modern Metazoa and Metaphyta...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Field and {{laboratory}} experiments {{were performed to}} investigate the palatability to predatory fishes of organic extracts and purified compounds from the Caribbean reef sponge Axinella corrugata (=Teichaxinella morchella). When incorporated into artificial foods at the same volumetric concentration as found in sponge tissue, crude extracts of the sponge, {{as well as a}} butanol-soluble partition of the crude extract, deterred feeding of the Caribbean reef fish Thalassoma bifasciatum in laboratory aquarium assays and deterred feeding of a natural assemblage of fishes in assays performed on reefs where A. corrugata is found. Bioassay-directed fractionation of the butanol-soluble partition led to the isolation of a single compound responsible for feeding deterrency, stevensine, a previously described dibrominated alkaloid. The mean concentration of stevensine in A. corrugata, as determined by quantitative NMR analysis, was 19. 0 mg/ml (N = 8, SD = 7. 2 mg/ml). Stevensine deterred feeding in laboratory aquarium assays at concentrations> 2. 25 mg/ml, and deterred feeding in field assays at- 12 mg/ml. Stevensine represents another in the oroidin class of brominated pyrrole derivatives that function as chemical defenses of sponges in the families <b>Axinellidae</b> and Agelasidae...|$|E
40|$|The marine sponge Axinella corrugata {{is being}} {{developed}} as a model organism for in vitro marine invertebrate research. Molecular genetics methods such as DNA fingerprinting [amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) ] and single-locus DNA sequence analyses were applied to this model to meet the primary objective of identifying positive A. corrugata–specific molecular markers that will aid in verifying cell identity in vitro and distinguish sponge cells from potential microbial contaminants. The extent of intra- and interspecific variation in these markers from geographically distinct samples of A. corrugata and closely related sponge taxa was also assessed. Two novel nuclear loci along with intervening transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of nuclear rRNA were characterized, although the latter appeared to better meet primary marker criteria, such as taxonomic specificity and high frequency of detection (via polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) from different individuals (n 3 ̆e 40) and cell cultures. Phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses of ITS DNA sequences helped clarify taxonomies and also suggested species boundaries between and among western Atlantic and eastern Atlantic/Indian Ocean A. corrugataand <b>Axinellidae</b> samples.

40|$|Pyrrole-imidazole {{alkaloids}} {{represent a}} unique family of natural products which are exclusively found in marine sponges, mainly the Agelasidae, <b>Axinellidae,</b> and Halichondridae families. The pyrrole-imidazole alkaloids are fascinating due to thier biogenetic relationship {{leading to a}} large, strucurally diverse family based on a common key metabolite, oroidin. Some of the pyrrole-imidazole alkaloids have interesting biological activities, e. g., potent antitumor or antibacterial activities. One of these chellenging alkaloids is dibromophakellstatin which was first isolated from Phakellia mauritiana. In this work an efficient five step synthesis of dibromophakellstatin is described providing the natural product in an overall yield of 10 %. Based on a broad investigation of the reactivity of dipyrrolopyrazinone-type enamides, a novel three component imidazolidinone anellation was exploited as the key step of the total synthesis. With this findings the overall yield of the synthesis could increased up to 18 %. Based on these results {{it was possible to}} develope the first enantioselective total synthesis of (-) -dibromophakellstatin in a chiral pool approach (10 steps, 3. 5 % overall yield). In a collaboration effort the antitumor activity of dibromophakellstatin was confirmed. It was found that only the natural enantiomer shows biological activity by an unknown mechanism. Encouraged by the biological activity of (-) -dibromophakellstatin, different cyclopropane variations of the tetracyclic phakellin- and isophakellin scaffolds were obtained by reaction of dichlorocarbene with tri- and bicyclic precursors. Some of these compounds werde found to have interesting new anti proliferative activities...|$|E
40|$|The {{most diverse}} and species-rich {{class of the}} phylum Porifera is Demospongiae. In recent years, the {{systematics}} of this clade, which contains more than 7000 species, has developed rapidly in light of new studies combining molecular and morphological observations. We add more than 500 new, nearly complete 18 S sequences (an increase of more than 200 %) {{in an attempt to}} further enhance understanding of the phylogeny of Demospongiae. Our study specifically targets representation of type species and genera that have never been sampled for any molecular data in an effort to accelerate progress in classifying this diverse lineage. Our analyses recover four highly supported subclasses of Demospongiae: Keratosa, Myxospongiae, Haploscleromorpha, and Heteroscleromorpha. Within Keratosa, neither Dendroceratida, nor its two families, Darwinellidae and Dictyodendrillidae, are monophyletic and Dictyoceratida is divided into two lineages, one predominantly composed of Dysideidae and the second containing the remaining families (Irciniidae, Spongiidae, Thorectidae, and Verticillitidae). Within Myxospongiae, we find Chondrosida to be paraphyletic with respect to the Verongida. We amend the latter to include species of the genus Chondrosia and erect a new order Chondrillida to contain remaining taxa from Chondrosida, which we now discard. Even with increased taxon sampling of Haploscleromorpha, our analyses are consistent with previous studies; however, Haliclona species are interspersed in even more clades. Haploscleromorpha contains five highly supported clades, each more diverse than previously recognized, and current families are mostly polyphyletic. In addition, we reassign Janulum spinispiculum to Haploscleromorpha and resurrect Reniera filholi as Janulum filholi comb. nov. Within the large clade Heteroscleromorpha, we confirmed 12 recently identified clades based on alternative data, as well as a sister-group relationship between the freshwater Spongillida and the family Vetulinidae. We transfer Stylissa flabelliformis to the genus Scopalina within the family Scopalinidae, which is of uncertain position. Our analyses uncover a large, strongly supported clade containing all heteroscleromorphs other than Spongillida, Vetulinidae, and Scopalinidae. Within this clade, there is a major division separating <b>Axinellidae,</b> Biemnida, Tetractinellida, Bubaridae, Stelligeridae, Raspailiidae, and some species of Petromica, Topsentia, and Axinyssa from Agelasida, Polymastiidae, Placospongiidae, Clionaidae, Spirastrellidae, Tethyidae, Poecilosclerida, Halichondriidae, Suberitidae, and Trachycladus. Among numerous results: (1) Spirophorina and its family Tetillidae are paraphyletic with respect to a strongly supported Astrophorina within Tetractinellida; (2) Agelasida is the earliest diverging lineage within the second clade listed above; and (3) Merlia and Desmacella appear to be the earliest diverging lineages of Poecilosclerida...|$|E
