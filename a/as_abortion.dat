5|$|As {{a member}} of the House Ways and Means Committee and former {{chairman}} of the Subcommittee on Select Revenue Measures, Neal is an influential figure in House economic policy. He has also dedicated much of his career to US–Ireland relations and maintaining American involvement in the Northern Ireland peace process, for which he has won several acclamations. He has a generally liberal voting record, but is considered a moderate on such issues <b>as</b> <b>abortion</b> and trade.|$|E
5|$|His final {{re-election}} campaign came in 1990 against businessman Harry Lonsdale. Lonsdale aggressively went after Hatfield with television attack ads that attacked Hatfield {{as out of}} touch on issues such <b>as</b> <b>abortion</b> and timber management and accused the incumbent of being too closely allied with special interest groups in Washington. Lonsdale's tactics moved him even with, and then ahead of Hatfield in some polls. Hatfield, who had typically stayed above the fray of negative campaigning, was forced to respond in kind with attack ads of his own. He raised $1million in a single month after trailing Lonsdale in the polls before the November election. He defeated the Democrat with 590,095 (53.7percent) votes to 507,743 (46.2percent) votes.|$|E
50|$|Anti-abortion feminist {{organizations}} {{generally do}} not distinguish between views on <b>abortion</b> <b>as</b> a legal issue, <b>abortion</b> <b>as</b> a moral issue, and <b>abortion</b> <b>as</b> a medical procedure. Such distinctions are made by many women, for example, women who would not abort their own pregnancies but would prefer that abortion remain legal.|$|R

5|$|A {{mathematical}} look at {{the voting}} numbers reveals that Bush {{would have had to}} win 12.55% of Perot's 18.91% of the vote, 66.36% of Perot's support base, to earn a majority of the vote, and would have needed to win nearly every state Clinton won by less than five percentage points. Furthermore, Perot was most popular in states that strongly favored either Clinton or Bush, limiting his real electoral impact for either candidate. He gained relatively little support in the Southern states and happened to have the best showing in states with few electoral votes. Perot appealed to disaffected voters all across the political spectrum who had grown weary of the two-party system. Perot's anti-NAFTA stance played a role in his support, and Perot voters were relatively moderate on hot button social issues such <b>as</b> <b>abortion</b> and gay rights.|$|E
5|$|The Republican offer {{called for}} an {{approximately}} $35 billion budget and no tax increases, and relied on delaying the payment of some K-12 school aid and issuing bonds against future tobacco revenue to cover the remaining gap. It differed from the previous Republican proposals in several provisions, particularly increasing the K-12 per-student formula by $50 per year to cover additional borrowing costs, adding $10 million to the University of Minnesota budget to equalize Minnesota State Colleges and Universities cuts, and restoring funding to the Department of Human Rights and the Trade Office. Dayton's conditions were that measures on social issues such <b>as</b> <b>abortion</b> be dropped from the budget, 15percent reductions to state employees in all agencies be dropped, and a $500 million infrastructure construction bonding bill.|$|E
25|$|In September 2005, Feinstein {{was one of}} five Democratic {{senators}} to vote against Supreme Court nominee John Roberts on the Senate Judiciary Committee, saying she still {{was not aware of}} Roberts' stances on certain issues such <b>as</b> <b>abortion</b> and the right to death.|$|E

Clinical signs include reproductive failure in sows such <b>as</b> <b>abortions</b> and {{giving birth to}} stillborn or mummified fetuses, and cyanosis of the ear and vulva. In neonatal pigs, the disease causes respiratory distress, with increased susceptibility to respiratory infections such as Glasser's disease.|$|R

25|$|Bloomberg had privately {{indicated}} he believed Mitt Romney {{would be better}} at running the country, but could not publicly support him because of Romney's positions on social issues such <b>as</b> <b>abortion</b> and gun control.

25|$|In {{addition}} to its white middle class base, Republicans attracted strong majorities from the evangelical Christian vote (including Southern pockets of traditionalist Roman Catholics as in South Louisiana), which had been nonpolitical before 1980. The national Democratic Party's support for liberal social stances such <b>as</b> <b>abortion</b> drove many former Democrats into a Republican Party that was embracing the conservative views on these issues. Conversely, liberal Republicans in the northeast began to join the Democratic Party.|$|E

All candidates opposed a pullout from Iraq except for Ron Paul, who spoke and voted against the resolution to authorize war on Iraq in 2002 {{and has been a}} vocal critic of the war.|$|E
25|$|The {{album was}} one of the most {{anticipated}} releases of 2011 due to the sharp rise in Cole's popularity and mainstream fan base. Cole's lyrics perhaps most strikingly deal with issues such <b>as</b> <b>abortion</b> and the consequences of growing up in a fatherless household. However, these themes are incorporated alongside more introspective issues such as relationships, family problems, fame and attempting to be successful – an area which very much links in with the subtitle of the album 'The Sideline Story'. Upon its release, the album was generally well received by critics, who praised the wholesomeness of the album.|$|E
25|$|In the Republican primary, {{incumbent}} Senator Bob Packwood {{was running}} for a third term. With his moderate stance on issues such <b>as</b> <b>abortion,</b> several conservative challengers filed to challenge Packwood in the Republican primary. These included Brenda Jose, {{the vice chairman of}} the Oregon Republican Party, and Rosalie Huss, who was the wife of Walter Huss, an ultraconservative minister who had been chair of the Oregon Republican Party before being ousted by a moderate and liberal coalition, which included Packwood and Republican governor Victor G. Atiyeh. Packwood went on to defeat all challengers by a wide margin.|$|E

25|$|Episodes {{revolve around}} the adventures of Sarah and her friends in Valley Village, California, a {{district}} in the San Fernando Valley portion of Los Angeles, which is portrayed as an autonomous city within the show. Silverman plays a fictionalized version of herself, an unemployed woman who leads an irresponsible life. Her most notable trait is her undiluted, childlike self-absorption, which commonly leads to awkward comedic situations in which she insults friends, family, and total strangers. The show tackled issues such <b>as</b> <b>abortion,</b> racism, and same-sex marriage; it was canceled after three seasons. The show was filmed at Hollywood Center Studios, Hollywood, California.|$|E
25|$|Objectivism has {{remained}} popular on college campuses, {{with dozens of}} student groups dedicated to promoting and studying the philosophy of Objectivism spread across the U.S., Australia, Canada, Guatemala, Israel, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and Norway. These clubs often present speakers on controversial topics such <b>as</b> <b>abortion,</b> religion, and foreign policy, often allying with conservative (and sometimes liberal) organizations to organize their events. For example, the New York University Objectivism Club hosted a joint panel on the Muhammad cartoons that received nationwide coverage for NYU's censorship of the cartoons. There are several dozen speakers sponsored by the Ayn Rand Institute and other organizations who give nationwide tours each year speaking about Objectivism.|$|E
25|$|In her candidacy, Bean {{focused on}} the fiscal and {{environmental}} side of politics, rather than on controversial social issues. Bean's campaign website mentioned {{little in the way}} of her views on social issues such <b>as</b> <b>abortion</b> and gay marriage. Instead, the website mentioned her work to protect middle class working families and help small businesses, as well as protect the environment. However, as Bean was endorsed by the Illinois Planned Parenthood Council in her 2004 election bid, it is likely that she is pro-choice. Other endorsements of Bean included those from the United Auto Workers, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, the Sierra Club, the American Federation of Teachers, the Chicago Tribune, and the Chicago Sun-Times.|$|E
25|$|The Leges Henrici Primi, written c. 1115, treated pre-quickening <b>abortion</b> <b>as</b> a misdemeanor, and post-quickening <b>abortion</b> <b>as</b> {{carrying}} a lesser penalty than homicide.

25|$|Early {{polls showed}} Giuliani {{with one of}} the highest levels of name {{recognition}} and support among the Republican candidates. Throughout most of 2007 he was the leader in most nationwide opinion polling among Republicans. Senator John McCain, who ranked a close second behind the New York Mayor, had faded, and most polls showed Giuliani to have more support {{than any of the other}} declared Republican candidates, with only former Senator Fred Thompson and former Governor Mitt Romney showing greater support in some per-state Republican polls. On November 7, 2007, Giuliani's campaign received an endorsement from evangelist, Christian Broadcasting Network founder, and past presidential candidate Pat Robertson. This was viewed by political observers as a possibly key development in the race, as it gave credence that evangelicals and other social conservatives could support Giuliani despite some of his positions on social issues such <b>as</b> <b>abortion</b> and gay rights.|$|E
25|$|Telefís Éireann began {{broadcasting}} at 19:00 on New Year's Eve, 1961. The channel {{was launched}} with opening address by the then President de Valera. There were other messages from Cardinal d'Alton and Lemass; following this, a live concert was broadcast from the Gresham Hotel in Dublin. The show, {{which was a}} countdown to the New Year, was hosted by Andrews, with appearances by tenor Patrick O'Hagan (father of Johnny Logan), the Artane Boys' Band and Michael O'Hehir. Television became an important force within Irish culture as it helped to explore topics often deemed controversial such <b>as</b> <b>abortion</b> and contraception. The development of entertainment show The Late Late Show, began in July 1962 and is still broadcasting today. Such programming helped to influence in the changing social structure of Ireland. Telefís Éireann began to explore children's television at this point producing the ground breaking show Wanderly Wagon which inspired a generation with characters like Judge and Mr Crow.|$|E
25|$|Goldwater {{returned}} to the Senate in 1969, and specialized in defense policy, bringing to the table {{his experience as a}} senior officer in the Air Force Reserve. In 1974, as an elder statesman of the party, Goldwater successfully urged President Richard Nixon to resign when evidence of a cover-up in the Watergate scandal became overwhelming and impeachment was imminent. By the 1980s, the increasing influence of the Christian right on the Republican Party so conflicted with Goldwater's views that he became a vocal opponent of the religious right on issues such <b>as</b> <b>abortion,</b> gay rights, and {{the role of religion in}} public life. After narrowly winning re-election to the Senate in 1980, he chose not to run for a sixth term in 1986, and was succeeded by fellow Republican John McCain. A significant accomplishment in his career was the passage of the Goldwater–Nichols Act of 1986, which restructured the higher levels of the Pentagon by placing the chain of command from the President to the Secretary of Defense directly to the commanders of the Unified Combatant Commands.|$|E
