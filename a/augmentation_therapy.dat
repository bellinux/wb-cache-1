40|$|An {{emerging}} {{theory of}} schizophrenia postulates that hypofunction of adenosine signaling {{may contribute to}} its pathophysiology. This {{study was designed to}} test the “adenosine hypothesis” of schizophrenia and to evaluate focal adenosine-based strategies for therapy. We found that augmentation of adenosine by pharmacologic inhibition of adenosine kinase (ADK), the key enzyme of adenosine clearance, exerted antipsychotic-like activity in mice. Further, overexpression of ADK in transgenic mice was associated with attentional impairments linked to schizophrenia. We observed that the striatal adenosine A 2 A receptor links adenosine tone and psychomotor response to amphetamine, an indicator of dopaminergic signaling. Finally, intrastriatal implants of engineered adenosine-releasing cells restored the locomotor response to amphetamine in mice overexpressing ADK, whereas the same grafts placed proximal to the hippocampus of transgenic mice reversed their working memory deficit. This functional double dissociation between striatal and hippocampal adenosine demonstrated in Adk transgenic mice highlights the independent contributions of these two interconnected brain regions in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and thus provides the rationale for developing local adenosine <b>augmentation</b> <b>therapies</b> for the treatment of schizophrenia...|$|R

Four antidepressants and four <b>augmentation</b> <b>therapies</b> had previously been ineffective or intolerable, and electroconvulsive therapy had only a temporary effect.

40|$|Excessive {{neutrophil}} activation {{accompanied by}} delayed apoptotic cell death in inflammatory conditions causes progressive damage of cells and tissues, leading to life-threatening multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Previous work suggested that circulating serum factors during inflammation are critically {{involved in the}} suppression of neutrophil cell death although the identity of these antiapoptotic mediators remained elusive. In this study, we identified the acute phase protein α- 1 Antitrypsin (AAT) as a potent suppressor of staurosporine (STS) -induced apoptosis in human neutrophils through a mechanism implicating caspases-independent pathways. We show here that serum levels of AAT, potentially in part released by stimulated neutrophils, are markedly elevated in major trauma patients suffering from systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Notably, AAT depletion from serum increased sensitivity of human neutrophils for STS-induced cell death. In fact, AAT was demonstrated to confer intrinsic apoptosis resistance by preventing PKC/Akt inactivation and subsequent proteasomal degradation of antiapoptotic Mcl- 1 protein in response to STS treatment. Neither MAP kinase ERK 1 / 2 nor caspases {{were found to be}} involved in AAT-triggered antiapoptotic pathways in neutrophils. In summary, these results establish a novel pivotal role of circulating AAT in mediating survival by antagonizing the proapoptotic action of the PKC inhibitor STS and should be considered for AAT <b>augmentation</b> <b>therapies</b> in future...|$|R

Paroxetine (5 mg/kg s. c.) combined with WAY 100635 (0. 3 mg/kg s. c.) increased Arc mRNA in frontal, parietal and piriform cortices, and caudate putamen. Paroxetine (5 mg/kg s. c.) plus NAD- 299 (1 or 5 mg/kg s. c.) had a similar effect. None of these drugs increased Arc mRNA when administered alone. Paroxetine (5 mg/kg s. c.) plus p-MPPI (8. 5 mg/kg s. c.) also increased Arc mRNA but p-MPPI itself elevated Arc mRNA in many regions. Whilst LY 426965 (3 or 10 mg/kg s. c.) had no effect alone, when combined with paroxetine (5 mg/kg s. c.), the drug increased Arc mRNA in caudate putamen but not cortical regions. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that four 5 -HT(1 A) receptor antagonists augment the effect of an SSRI on Arc mRNA expression, which is suggestive of increased postsynaptic 5 -HT function. However, the data reveal certain differences in the 5 -HT(1 A) receptor antagonists not recognised in models of presynaptic 5 -HT function...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{long-term}} {{outcome of}} antidepressant-refractory depression {{is not well}} known. Therefore, {{the present study investigated}} the long-term outcome of 26 antidepressant-refractory patients with depression, whom we had studied and treated in 1995. Methods: Before being classified as nonresponse, these patients had been treated adequately with at least two tricyclic or heterocyclic antidepressants (a minimum of the equivalent of 150 mg of imipramine for 4 weeks). In 1995, 21 of 26 patients were diagnosed with unipolar depression, while 5 were diagnosed with bipolar depression. Mean follow-up was 5. 7 years (range: 1 – 7 years) and changes in diagnosis, remission and treatment efficacy were evaluated. Results: Following the long-term follow-up, 13 patients achieved full remission and demonstrated high social functioning (mean GAF score, 91). A further four depressed patients experienced full remission; however, subsequent recurrence was observed. In total, 17 of 26 patients experienced remission at least once during the long-term follow-up period despite the chronic depressive episodes observed at study entry. Adjuvant treatment with lithium, dopamine receptor agonists or thyroid hormone was effective for promoting full remission. Among the 21 patients initially diagnosed with unipolar depression in 1995, diagnoses were changed to bipolar disorder in 5 cases. Limitations: This naturalistic study had a relatively small sample size and treatment was not controlled. Conclusions: Long-term follow-up revealed that a substantial proportion of antidepressant-refractory depression is comprised of bipolar disorders.

40|$|The authors {{studied the}} {{efficacy}} {{and safety of}} combined venlafaxine and quetiapine treatment for treatment-resistant depression (TRD) by dividing 95 TRD patients into two treatment groups: a combined venlafaxine (225 mg/day) and quetiapine (400 mg/day) group and a venlafaxine-only (225 mg/day) group for 8 weeks. Efficacy was assessed with the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, 17 items (Ham-D– 17) and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (Ham-A); safety was assessed with the Treatment-Emergent Symptom Scale (TESS). The two groups showed significant differences for the Ham-D– 17 and Ham-A and no differences on the TESS. Combined venlafaxine and quetiapine treatment showed good efficacy and safety in TRD.

A further indication of short implants is the molar region of the lower jaw, in which the possibility of implant placement can be restricted due to the anatomical position of the nervus alveolaris inferioris.|$|R
