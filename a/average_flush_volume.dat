40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} to evaluate the dynamics of an arterial first pass gadolinium (Gd) contrast medium (CM) bolus at the descending aorta (DAo), depending on various saline <b>flush</b> and Gd <b>volumes.</b> Using an ultra-fast two- dimensional GE-sequence (Siemens Vision®, 1. 5 -T), 200 sequential cross-sectional images of the addressed vessel (1 slice/s) were obtained. Several saline <b>flush</b> <b>volumes</b> (15 mL, 30 mL, and 60 mL) were applied following the administration of 10 mL Gd (single dose) {{to a group of}} 4 normal volunteers (body weight 50 – 55 kg) using a mechanical MR injector (injection rate = 3. 0 mL/s). Additionally, when performing a second test series, the saline volume remained constant, while the Gd volumes were varied from half doses to triple doses (5, 10, 20, and 30 mL Gd were given to every volunteer of the group). The signal intensity versus time (SI/T) curve at a measured region of interest (ROI) within the DAo was calculated. The bolus arrival time (BAT), the maximal signal-to-noise ratio (SNRmax), the bolus time length (BL; 75 and 80 maximum intensity duration), the slope of the SI/T curve, and the areas below the SI/T curve for both the 80 and 75 maximum intensity duration level (INT 80 and INT 75) were calculated. The increase of saline <b>flush</b> <b>volume</b> from 30 to 60 mL caused significant bolus lengthening of approximately 50 (mean BL = 9. 5 s, 10. 3 s, and 15. 4 s for 15 mL, 30 mL, and 60 mL saline <b>flush</b> <b>volumes,</b> respectively, measured as SI/T duration at the 75 SNRmax level). Using saline <b>flush</b> <b>volumes</b> equal to or higher than 30 mL increased the slope of the SI/T curve. A continuous increase of INT 75 / 80 by using higher saline <b>flush</b> <b>volumes</b> was found. Different saline and Gd volumes did not affect the SNRmax and the BAT. Only the low dose (0. 05 mmol/kg Gd) showed a 17 – 21. 6 significantly lower SNRmax. The BL and the INT increased mainly by enlarging of applied Gd volume from single to double dose (BL 75 and INT 75 were 9. 6 s and 1305, 12. 3 s and 2121, 38. 5 s and 6181, 37. 8 s and 6613 for 5, 10, 20, and 30 mL applied Gd volume, respectively). The arterial bolus length benefits from increasing Gd and saline <b>flush</b> <b>volumes</b> due to increased venous bolus length and wash out effects of Gd within the injection site of the vein. Doses larger than a single dose are not needed to increase the SNR in contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography images of the thoracic aorta...|$|R

40|$|In {{this article}} the {{relation}} between contrast medium (CM) application and sequence parameters will be discussed with respect to clinical use of the contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (CE-MRA) in the peripheral vessel region. The adjustment of the sequence parameters, the CM application timing and the bolus geometry is necessary for an effective use of CE-MRA. Investigation protocols for several vascular regions differ mainly corresponding to varying fields of view and slab thickness. Restrictions of increasing the measurement time are expected in peripherally localized vessels if fast arteriovenous transit time occurs. The vessel contrast depends from (1) optimal CM bolus timing and (2) bolus geometry defined by {{the parameters of the}} intravenous bolus injection (flow rate, dose and NaCl <b>flush</b> <b>volume).</b> Our study results have shown that the bolus remains compact but also shorter if a higher flow rate is being applied at equal dose. The enlargement of the NaCl <b>flush</b> <b>volume</b> has evidently caused an increased intraarterial CM concentration and a slightly bolus lengthening. The exact timing regimen requires an automated mechanical CM injection pump. In most countries, a total dose of 0. 3 mmol/kg Gd is allowed for application during one investigation. Therefore, obtaining an angiogram of the entire iliac and leg region this total dose must be separated. 0. 1 mmol/kg {{for each of the three}} measurements can be recommended. Otherwise, using this lower CM dose results in less spatial resolution. At least a dosage of 0. 2 mmol/kg Gd is necessary to achieve a higher spatial resolution. The calculation of CM dosage should be also related to the dedicated vessel region of interest than to the body weight only...|$|R

The research methodology consisted of a case study in a multifamily residential building with submetering system, by monitoring the total water consumption and the two flushing systems using water meters installed in WC cisterns. By means of a mathematical model, a comparison of the design flowrate in the main branch was carried out considering the two types of WC cisterns. The results indicated that the water consumption in the 6 L WC cistern was 20 % in relation to the total domestic consumption, whereas the water consumption observed in the dual-flush WC cistern (6 / 3 L) was 16 %. The dual flushing system (6 / 3 L) presented about 18 % consumption reduction impact as compared to the 6 L system. The design flowrate values in the main branch, obtained by the mathematical model, were 0. 35 L/s for systems with 6 L WC cistern and 0. 34 L/s with dual-flush WC cistern (6 / 3 L), that is, a reduction of similar to 3 %.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{velocity}} of dripline flushing in subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) systems affects system design, cost, management, performance, and longevity. A 30 ‐day field {{study was conducted}} at Kansas State University to analyze the effect of four targeted flushing velocities (0. 23, 0. 30, 0. 46, and 0. 61 m/s) for a fixed 15 min duration of flushing and three flushing frequencies (no flushing or flushing every 15 or 30 days) on SDI emitter discharge and sediments within the dripline and removed in the flushing water. At {{the end of the}} field experiment (371 h), the amount of solids carried away by the flushing water and retained in every lateral were determined as well as laboratory determination of emitter discharge for every single emitter within each dripline. Greater dripline flushing velocities, which also resulted in greater <b>flushing</b> <b>volumes,</b> tended to result in greater amounts of solids in the flushing water, but the differences were not always statistically significant. Neither the frequency of flushing nor the interaction of flushing frequency and velocity significantly affected the amount of solids in the flushing water. There was a greater concentration of solids in the beginning one‐third of the 90 m laterals, particularly for treatments with no flushing or with slower dripline flushing velocities. As flushing velocity and concurrently <b>flushing</b> <b>volume</b> increased, there was a tendency for greater solids removal and/or more equal distribution within the dripline. At the end of the field study, the average emitter discharge as measured in the laboratory for a total of 3970 emitters was 0. 64 L/h. which was significantly less (approximately 2. 5 %) than the discharge for new and unused emitters.

40|$|Estuaries {{represent}} an economically and biologically {{important part of}} our coast. These bodies of water are used as permanent homes or nursery grounds for many of the important forms of marine life. Estuaries also provide protected transportation routes for cargo ships and barges. Because of their biological productivity and their economically advantageous locations, estuaries often attract industrial and commercial development along with associated dense populations. Because of industrial and metropolitan development, estuaries are often expected to accept large amounts of waste materials. Many estuaries are large in size and give the appearance of being able to assimilate large volumes of this waste material. In actuality, estuaries may act as natural traps for pollutants. The fresh-water flow into some estuaries is relatively small. Once a pollutant enters such an estuary, the material is carried back and forth by the tides and makes only slow progress toward the ocean. These conditions are especially characteristic of Gulf Coast estuaries. For example, recent studies (92) indicate that the <b>average</b> <b>flushing</b> time (i. e., the time necessary for the volume of fresh water inflow to equal the volume of the estuary) for the upper 14 miles of the Houston Ship Channel is 26 days and the <b>average</b> <b>flushing</b> time for Galveston Bay is 155 days. In regard to salinity, estuaries vary between two extremes: the homogeneous estuary and the highly stratified. At each section of a homogeneous estuary, there is complete vertical mixing of the salt and fresh water. In a stratified estuary, there are two layers of water: the upper layer contains fresh water flowing toward the sea, and the lower layer contains salt water moving away from the sea. A sharp change in salinity occurs at the interface between the upper and lower layers. The Delaware Estuary is representative of a homogeneous estuary, whereas the Mississippi Delta represents a highly stratified estuary. Many estuaries fall somewhere between these two extremes and include some mixing and some stratification at each section; hence, they are more difficult to analyze than the idealized homogeneous or stratified cases.

Therefore fluid dynamics, flushing techniques, and sufficient <b>flushing</b> <b>volumes</b> are important matters in adequate flushing in all catheter types. If a catheter is not in use, it is locked. For years, it has been thought that the catheter has to be filled with an anticoagulant to prevent catheter occlusion. Heparin has {{played a key role in}} locking venous catheters. However, the high number of risks associated with heparin forces us to look for alternatives. A long time ago, 0. 9 % sodium chloride was already introduced as locking solution in peripheral cannulas. More recently, a 0. 9 % sodium chloride lock has also been investigated in other types of catheters.

40|$|Seawater {{desalination}} {{has significantly}} developed towards membrane technology than phase change process during last decade. Seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) {{in general is}} the most familiar process due to higher water recovery and lower energy consumption compared to other available desalination processes. Despite major advancements in SWRO technology, desalination industry is still facing significant amount of practical issues. Therefore, the potentials and problems faced by current SWRO industries and essential study areas are discussed in this review {{for the benefit of}} desalination industry. It is important to consider all the following five components in SWRO process i. e. (1) intake (2) pre-treatment (3) high pressure pumping (4) membrane separation (performance of membranes and brine disposal) and (5) product quality. Development of higher corrosion resistant piping materials or coating materials, valves, and pumps is believed to be in higher research demand. Furthermore, brine management, that includes brine disposal and resource recovery need further attention.

40|$|The {{velocity}} of dripline flushing in subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) systems affects system design, cost, management, performance, and longevity. A 30 ‐day field {{study was conducted}} at Kansas State University to analyze the effect of four targeted flushing velocities (0. 23, 0. 30, 0. 46, and 0. 61 m/s) for a fixed 15 min duration of flushing and three flushing frequencies (no flushing or flushing every 15 or 30 days) on SDI emitter discharge and sediments within the dripline and removed in the flushing water. At {{the end of the}} field experiment (371 h), the amount of solids carried away by the flushing water and retained in every lateral were determined as well as laboratory determination of emitter discharge for every single emitter within each dripline. Greater dripline flushing velocities, which also resulted in greater <b>flushing</b> <b>volumes,</b> tended to result in greater amounts of solids in the flushing water, but the differences were not always statistically significant. Neither the frequency of flushing nor the interaction of flushing frequency and velocity significantly affected the amount of solids in the flushing water. There was a greater concentration of solids in the beginning one‐third of the 90 m laterals, particularly for treatments with no flushing or with slower dripline flushing velocities. As flushing velocity and concurrently <b>flushing</b> <b>volume</b> increased, there was a tendency for greater solids removal and/or more equal distribution within the dripline. At the end of the field study, the average emitter discharge as measured in the laboratory for a total of 3970 emitters was 0. 64 L/h. which was significantly less (approximately 2. 5 %) than the discharge for new and unused emitters. Only six emitters were nearly or fully clogged, with discharges between 0 % and 5 % of new and unused emitters. Flushing velocity and flushing frequency did not have consistent significant effects on emitter discharge, and those numerical differences that did exist were small (< 3 %). Emitter discharge was approximately 3 % less for the distal ends of the driplines (last 20 % of the dripline). Although not a specific factor in the study, the results of solids removals during flushing and solids retention within the different dripline sections suggest that duration of flushing may be a more cost‐effective management option than increasing the dripline flushing velocity through SDI system design. Finally, although microirrigation system components have been improved over the years, the need for flushing to remove solids and reduce clogging potential has not been eliminate...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Objective. Blood {{sampling}} from an um-bilical artery catheter (UAC) {{placed in}} a high position (thoracal 6 – 9) {{has the potential to}} produce clinically sig-nificant changes in cerebral blood flow and, thereby, in cerebral oxygenation. This may contribute to cerebral impairment in preterm newborn infants. Therefore, we set up a study {{to determine the effects of}} different sam-pling speeds through a UAC on cerebral oxygenation in preterm infants. Methods. Thirty pairs of measurements were con-ducted on 20 preterm infants (median gestational age: 30. 14 weeks; median birth weight: 1170 g). For each in-fant, 2 blood samplings (both 2. 3 mL, including <b>flush</b> <b>volume)</b> through the UAC in high position were taken at 2 different speeds (20 and 40 seconds) in alternating sequence. Cerebral oxygenation was measured noninva-sively by near-infrared spectroscopy. Concentration changes in cerebral oxygenated hemoglobin (O 2 Hb) and deoxygenated hemoglobin (HHb), along with the tissue oxygenation index (TOI; O 2 Hb/[O 2 Hb HHb] 100), were recorded while blood was withdrawn and subse-quently reinfused. Results. A significant decrease in O 2 Hb and TOI oc-curred during blood sampling within 20 seconds (median O 2 Hb: 1. 5 mol/L; range: 4. 1 – 2. 3; median TOI: 0. 6 %; range: 6. 3 – 2. 3), whereas HHb increased (media...|$|R

Flushing and locking of intravenous catheters {{are thought to}} be essential in the prevention of occlusion. The clinical sign of an occlusion is catheter malfunction and flushing is strongly recommended to ensure a well-functioning catheter. Therefore fluid dynamics, flushing techniques, and sufficient <b>flushing</b> <b>volumes</b> are important matters in adequate flushing in all catheter types. If a catheter is not in use, it is locked. For years, it has been thought that the catheter has to be filled with an anticoagulant to prevent catheter occlusion. Heparin has {{played a key role in}} locking venous catheters. However, the high number of risks associated with heparin forces us to look for alternatives. A long time ago, 0. 9 % sodium chloride was already introduced as locking solution in peripheral cannulas. More recently, a 0. 9 % sodium chloride lock has also been investigated in other types of catheters. Thrombolytic agents have also been studied as a locking solution because their antithrombotic effect was suggested as superior to heparin. Other catheter lock solutions focus on the anti-infective properties of the locks such as antibiotics and chelating agents. Still, the most effective locking solution will depend on the catheter type and the patient’s condition. 1...|$|R
40|$|Histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate {{solution}} (HTK) {{has been}} scrutinized {{for use in}} pancreas transplantation. A recent case series and a United Network for Or-gan Sharing data base review have suggested an in-creased incidence of allograft pancreatitis and graft losswith HTK compared to theUniversity ofWisconsin solution (UW). Conversely, a recent randomized, con-trolled study failed to show any significant difference between HTK and UW for pancreas allograft preser-vation. This study was a retrospective review of all pancreas transplants performed at Indiana University between 2003 and 2009 comparing preservation with HTK or UW. Data included recipient and donor demo-graphics, 7 -day, 90 -day and 1 -year graft survival, peak 30 -day serumamylase and lipase, HbA 1 c andC-peptide levels. Of the 308 pancreas transplants, 84 % used HTK and 16 % UW. There were more SPK compared to pan-creas after kidney and pancreas transplant alone in the HTK group. Donor and recipient demographics were similar. Therewas {{no significant difference in}} 7 -day, 90 -day or 1 -year graft survival, 30 -day peak serumamylase and lipase, HbA 1 c or C-peptide. No clinically significant difference between HTK and UW for pancreas allograft preservation was identified. Specifically, in the con-text of low-to-moderate <b>flush</b> <b>volume</b> and short cold ischemia time (≤ 10 h), no increased incidence of allo-graft pancreatitis or graft loss was observed.

40|$|Carotenoids {{are known}} for their {{antioxidant}} activity and health promoting effects. One of the richest sources of carotenoids are carrots. However, about 25 % of the annual production is regarded as by-products due to strict market policies. The aim {{of this study was to}} extract carotenoids from those by-products. Conventional carotenoid extraction methods require the use of organic solvents, which are costly, environmentally hazardous, and require expensive disposal procedures. Pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) utilizes conventional solvents at elevated temperatures and pressure, and it requires less solvent and shorter extraction times. The extraction solvent of choice in this study was ethanol, which is a solvent generally recognized as safe (GRAS). The extraction procedure was optimized by varying the extraction time (2 – 10 min) and the temperature (60 – 180 °C). β-Carotene was used as an indicator for carotenoids content in the carrots. The results showed that time and temperatures of extraction have significant effect on the yield of carotenoids. Increasing the <b>flush</b> <b>volume</b> during extraction did not improve the extractability of carotenoids, indicating that the extraction method was mainly desorption/diffusion controlled. Use of a dispersing agent that absorbs the moisture content was important for the efficiency of extraction. Analysing the content of β-carotene at the different length of extraction cycles showed that about 80 % was recovered after around 20 min of extraction...|$|R
