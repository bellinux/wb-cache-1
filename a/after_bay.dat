5000|$|Bay's time at Oregon {{was also}} marked by {{disputes}} with track coach Bill Dellinger and with Nike founders Phil Knight and Bill Bowerman. Bay first drew fire when he terminated a practice whereby Nike supplied free equipment {{to members of}} the track team. Bay asserted that the practice violated NCAA rules, but Phil Knight angrily protested. In his memoirs, Bay wrote that he replied: [...] "Mr. Knight, I agree that you have every right to send our guys free equipment. I can't stop you. But every time you do, I'll have to make that athlete ineligible and he'll have to send that stuff right back to Nike." [...] Bay also refused to accept a proposed donation from Bowerman to build a new athletic building on grounds that Bowerman wanted to control the use of the building, and Bay refused to accept the condition. The building was not built until <b>after</b> <b>Bay</b> left Oregon.|$|E
50|$|A {{series of}} {{convoluted}} turning lanes {{can be found}} at the termini of County Road 44C and County Road 19A. Old 441 moves southwest onto Tavares Road, and continues this pattern until turning straight west <b>after</b> <b>Bay</b> Road. Later, it moves away from the railroad line at Merry Road. Around Anderson Drive, Old 441 becomes East Alfred Street. Continuing westward, the former US 441 Business serves as the western terminus of County Road 19A, but not the terminus of Dora Avenue, which continues south toward Main Street. Shortly after this, it crosses a railroad line for the former Tavares Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Depot. West of Barrow Avenue, Old 441 makes a right turn from East Alfred Street to Lake Shore Boulevard, where it runs parallel to a rail trail that was originally part of the ACL line it ran parallel to in Mount Dora. The road meets its demise at a wye with SR 19, and US 441/SR 44 ending at the US 441/SR 44 section of the wye.|$|E

They also occasionally went into the Saigon-Cholon areas to kidnap, rob or shakedown the wealthy in order to give to the poor. In 1949, Emperor Bảo Đại gave the decree that all non-communist military forces in the country could function as independent armies within the main army in order to solve the problem of having the national army being too small. Shortly <b>after,</b> <b>Bảy</b> Viễn (Lê Văn Viễn), the leader of a major branch of the Bình Xuyên was given the rank of Major General of the Vietnamese National Army and his troops became the QDQG Bình Xuyên, which was a self-funded army with revenues that were derived from legally-run brothels and casinos; Bảy Viễn forcibly took control of the casinos from Macanese organized crime groups.|$|E

50|$|The {{film was}} {{produced}} by DreamWorks and Reliance Entertainment. Film producer and director Michael Bay brought the manuscript of the young adult novel I Am Number Four to Stacey Snider and Steven Spielberg at DreamWorks. A bidding war developed for the film rights between DreamWorks and J.J. Abrams, with DreamWorks winning the rights in June 2009, {{with the intention of}} having Bay produce and possibly direct the project. The rights were purchased with the hope of attracting teenage fans of The Twilight Saga films, and the potential of establishing a film franchise, with at least six more installments planned by the book's publisher. Al Gough and Miles Millar, the creators of the television series Smallville, were hired to write the screenplay in August 2009. Marti Noxon, writer and producer for the television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer, also contributed to the screenplay. D. J. Caruso was brought on to direct in early 2010, <b>after</b> <b>Bay</b> opted to focus on directing the third film of the Transformers series. Caruso had been selected by Spielberg to direct Disturbia and Eagle Eye for DreamWorks, and had success with both films. Caruso had less than a year to prepare, shoot and edit the film, due to a worldwide release date set for Presidents Day weekend.|$|E

The Palm Wine Drinkard, which featured several R&B tracks and other experimental music styles, received mixed reviews from critics. In April 2012, Vazquez {{released his}} second solo mixtape, 51, which received positive reviews from critics. In 2012, Vazquez {{stated that he}} had three new albums that he was working on. Two of them - titled 19 and 63 (like 51, the albums are named <b>after</b> <b>Bay</b> Area bus lines) - he released as a double-album on February 7, 2013. The albums include collaborations with Pictureplane, Young L, SKYWLKR, Keyboard Kid, Trackademicks, Fat Tony, Mike Finito, Lakutis and Spank Rock {{as well as a}} beat Ad-Rock of the Beastie Boys originally made for Das Racist. Vice described 19 and 63 as [...] "taking the discursive and funny work he was doing with Das Racist and stripping it of any sense of structure or formula, but also working to free him from the label of 'Dude in Das Racist.'" [...] Pitchfork also praised the mixtapes, calling them [...] "organically avant-garde". Vazquez and Kassa Overall released a collaborative mixtape as Kool & Kass entitled Peaceful Solutions on April 30, 2013. In December 2013, Vazquez released the mixtape Not O.K., composed of tracks that did not make it on his then-forthcoming album, entitled Word O.K.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{objectives}} {{of the study were}} to evaluate the allosteric mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor BAY 86 - 9766 in monotherapy and in combination with sorafenib in orthotopic and subcutaneous hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) models with different underlying etiologies in two species. DESIGN: Antiproliferative potential of BAY 86 - 9766 and synergistic effects with sorafenib were studied in several HCC cell lines. Relevant pathway signaling was studied in MH 3924 a cells. For in vivo testing, the HCC cells were implanted subcutaneously or orthotopically. Survival and mode of action (MoA) were analyzed. RESULTS: BAY 86 - 9766 exhibited potent antiproliferative activity in HCC cell lines with half-maximal inhibitory concentration values ranging from 33 to 762 nM. BAY 86 - 9766 was strongly synergistic with sorafenib in suppressing tumor cell proliferation and inhibiting phosphorylation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). BAY 86 - 9766 prolonged survival in Hep 3 B xenografts, murine Hepa 129 allografts, and MH 3924 A rat allografts. Additionally, tumor growth, ascites formation, and serum alpha-fetoprotein levels were reduced. Synergistic effects in combination with sorafenib were shown in Huh- 7, Hep 3 B xenografts, and MH 3924 A allografts. On the signaling pathway level, the combination of BAY 86 - 9766 and sorafenib led to inhibition of the upregulatory feedback loop toward MEK phosphorylation observed <b>after</b> <b>BAY</b> 86 - 9766 monotreatment. With regard to the underlying MoA, inhibition of ERK phosphorylation, tumor cell proliferation, and microvessel density was observed in vivo. CONCLUSION: BAY 86 - 9766 shows potent single-agent antitumor activity and acts synergistically in combination with sorafenib in preclinical HCC models. These results support the ongoing clinical development of BAY 86 - 9766 and sorafenib in advanced HCC...|$|E
40|$|There are {{two types}} of adipose tissue. White adipose tissue (WAT) stores energy in the form of lipids. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) consumes energy to produce heat by thermo-genesis, which depends on the brown adipocytes {{specific}} marker uncoupling protein- 1 (UCP— 1). Metabolically active BAT is present in adult humans and its energy con-suming properties could be exploited to increase energy expenditure. We and others showed that the nitric oxide (NO) / cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) pathway is crucial for brown adipocyte differentiation [1, 2]. Here we studied the role of sGC in brown adipocyte differentia-tion employing the sGC stimulator BAY 41 — 2272. Material and methods Mesenchymal stem cells isolated from BAT of newborn mice were differentiated into brown adipocytes in vitro using established protocols [1]. During differentiation, cells were incubated with 3 µM BAY 41 — 2272, 200 µM 8 -pCPT-cGMP or 30 µM ODQ. Accumulated intracellular lipids were assessed by RedO staining and measurement of triglyceride (TG) content. To investigate the adipogenic program, Western Blot analysis of PPARg, C/EBPa and AP 2 was performed. Thermogenic differentiation of the cells was determined by protein expression analysis of Cytc and gene expression analysis of thermogenic markers UCP— 1, Cidea and PGC- 1 a. Results BAY 41 - 2272 increased lipid accumulation as deter-mined by RedO staining and TG content (1, 44 -fold) compared to control. Protein expression of the adi-pogenic marker proteins PPARg (1, 4 -fold), C/EBPa (1, 5 -fold) and AP 2 (1, 6 —fold) were increased <b>after</b> <b>BAY</b> 41 - 2272 incubation compared to control. Adipogenic markers PPARg (2, 3 -fold), C/EBPa (1, 8 -fold) and AP 2 (2, 1 -fold) were increased after cGMP incubation com-pared to control. In contrast, inhibition of sGC by ODQ decreased protein expression of PPARg (50 %), C/EBPa (29 %) and AP 2 (51 %). The thermogenic marker genes UCP- 1 (5, 38 -fold), Cidea (2, 44 -fold) and PGC- 1 a (2, 26 -fold) increased upon incubation with BAY 41 - 2272 compared to control. cGMP increased RNA levels o...|$|E

40|$|The Central Arizona Project (CAP) is {{designed}} to bring about 1. 9 ML of Colorado River water per year to Maricopa, Pima, and Pinal counties in Arizona. CAP carries water from the Colorado River at Lake Havasu toTucson. The CAP canal system is a 540 km long system of conveyance system aqueducts, tunnels, pumping plants,pipelines and a large reservoir (just north of Phoenix, AZ). Water is pumped uphill from the Colorado River. This study was conducted for the Hayden-Rhodes Aqueduct of the Central Arizona Project (CAP), which starts at the <b>after</b> <b>bay</b> of the Bouse Hill Pumping Plant and extends to the fore bay of the Salt-Gila Pumping Plant, which is {{just south of the}} Salt River, east of Phoenix. Additional pumping plants downstream lift water uphill to Tucson. The canal between adjacent pumping plants defines a canal segment. A sloping lined canal with check structures carries water between power plants. The canal between adjacent check structures defines a canal pool. The Pumping Plants use electric motors to power the pumps. Power outages could cause the canal to overtop at the fore bay of these power plants, since the flow in the canal would not stop with a power outage. The check structures in between the power plants can be closed with battery-operated electric motors. This was intended to contain water within each canal pool, if power is lost. Stopping the pumping plants and closing the check gates causes surge waves in the canal. Some additional freeboard at the downstream end of each canal pool was provided to contain these surge waves. Increases in frictional resistance in the canal have reduced the available canal freeboard from design conditions. This study evaluated the available freeboard in the canal during steady conditions and during unsteady conditions, associated with a power outage. HEC-RAS was used to determine water surface elevations and available freeboard under both steady and unsteady conditions...|$|E
