5|$|Oliver Cromwell, {{who led the}} {{uprising}} <b>and</b> <b>declined</b> invitations to be made king, became Lord Protector of England in 1657. It was marked by a ceremony in Westminster Hall, where he donned purple robes, sat on the Coronation Chair, and was invested {{with many of the}} traditional symbols of sovereignty, except a crown. A crown, perhaps saved from the melting pot in 1649, was placed beside Cromwell at his lying in state in 1660.|$|E

The major city of Calakmul in Mexico raised the greatest number of stelae known from any Maya city, at least 166, although they are very poorly preserved.|$|E

5|$|Allen did {{not feel}} suited to working in a {{department}} store, and on his return home took {{a job with the}} stockbroking company David Bevan and Co. Consequently, he played little cricket in 1933. He planned to be unavailable for the Test matches against the West Indies, but Larwood was injured and Voce out of form, so he was persuaded to play in the first Test. He played little thereafter that season <b>and</b> <b>declined</b> an invitation to tour India with an MCC team. In three games that season, he scored 199 runs and took 13 wickets.

5|$|Author Roald Dahl {{disapproved of}} the 1971 film {{adaptation}} <b>and</b> <b>declined</b> the film rights {{to produce the}} sequel, Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator. Warner Bros. and Brillstein-Grey Entertainment entered discussions with the Dahl estate in 1991, hoping to purchase the rights to produce another film version of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. The purchase was finalized in 1998, with Dahl's widow, Felicity ("Liccy"), and daughter, Lucy, receiving total artistic control and final privilege on the choices of actors, directors and writers. The Dahl Estate's subsequent protection of the source material was the main reason that Charlie and the Chocolate Factory had languished in development hell since the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Bradley's {{political}} career began in 1870, {{when he was}} elected prosecuting attorney of Garrard County. A Republican in the heavily Democratic Eighth District, Bradley was defeated by Milton J. Durham for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1872. In 1875, his party honored him with a nomination to serve in the U.S. Senate, even though he was too young to legally qualify for the office. Nevertheless, he received the vote of every Republican in the state legislature. The following year, he again lost to Durham for a seat in the House of Representatives, but received 3,000 more votes than any Republican candidate had ever received in that district. He refused his party's nomination for the Senate in 1878 and 1882, <b>and</b> <b>declined</b> a nomination for state attorney general in 1879 because of ill health.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{his years}} in the Philippines, Taft was keenly {{interested}} as president in East Asian affairs.

Knox did not agree, <b>and</b> <b>declined</b> a suggestion that he go to Peking to view the facts on the ground. Taft considered Roosevelt's minister there, William W. Rockhill, as uninterested in the China trade, and replaced him with William J. Calhoun, whom McKinley and Roosevelt had sent on several foreign missions. Knox did not listen to Calhoun on policy, and there were often conflicts. Taft and Knox tried unsuccessfully to extend John Hay's Open Door Policy to Manchuria.|$|E
