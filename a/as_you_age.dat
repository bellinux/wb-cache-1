[...] Among these are technological failures, {{such as a}} television that's [...] "on the blink," [...] a clothes dryer that doesn't work and a video machine that breaks down. [...] In addition, there are more domestic problems as the basement is flooded, the attic has woodworm and the ceiling has collapsed. [...] To make matters worse, when the video machine breaks, the singer's girlfriend gets bored and leaves him. [...] Later in the song, the singer is frustrated by trying {{to cross the street}} amidst traffic. [...] The song ends with the singer unable to sleep due to financial worries and concluding that there is [...] "no escape" [...] from the world's [...] "state of confusion."

50|$|Designing {{lighting}} for {{the elderly}} requires special consideration and care from architects and lighting designers. As people age, they experience neurodegeneration in the retina and in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Less light reaches {{the back of the}} eyes because the pupils decrease in size <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>age,</b> the lens inside your eye becomes thicker, and the lens scatters more light, causing objects and colors to appear less vivid. These symptoms are particularly common with persons having alzheimer's disease. Older people also have reduced levels of retinal illuminance, such as having smaller pupils and less transparent crystalline lenses. Furthermore, as an individual ages, he or she begins to lose retinal neurons, which not only compromises the ability to see but also to register a robust daily pattern of light-dark that is needed to maintain biological rhythms. The 24-hour light-dark cycle is the most important external stimulus for regulating the timing of the circadian cycle.|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Billboard, Alesso explained the song: [...] "When Tove Lo and I first started working together, she'd tell me about how {{she wanted to be}} different, to stand out as an artist. And on some level, I think everyone goes through that. As a teenager, I was always wondering about who I was, what was my identity, did I secretly wish I was someone else. But <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>age,</b> you realize that it's not about being someone else." [...] When asked what inspired the song's lyrics, he continued, [...] "My team and I reached out to Lo to see if she'd be interested in a collaboration, and a couple months later, we began writing the lyrics that would go over these instrumentals. We discussed what it should be about -- we knew it should be an emotional record -- and this gorgeous girl came back with this gorgeous topline." ...|$|E

I was employed in the East India House at the time Charles Lamb was a clerk there. It was not long after he had begun to contribute his Elia essays to the 'London Magazine.' I had read some of them, and was interested in the man. I met him several times in the corridors or on the stairways, and one day I was going up-stairs, carrying a hod of coals, as he was coming down. Looking up at him, I made a misstep, and came near dropping a portion of my burden. 'My good man,' said he, with a queer smile, 'if you would learn to carry your coals <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>you</b> carry your <b>age</b> <b>you</b> would do well.' I don't remember what I said in reply; but I know I thought if Charles Lamb could be made aware of my real age he would abandon his Elia work and devote himself to me." ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{success of}} Alf would soon make Moyet resentful {{as she felt}} the album's mass market appeal had defined her before she had the chance and {{experience}} to properly decide the direction she wanted to take her solo career in. Furthermore, she felt the album and her weight-gain at that time [...] "presented an image of unthreatening cosy womanliness". Speaking of the album, Moyet later recalled in 2016: [...] "I have, in the past, distanced myself from Alf. Because there were things about me at 21 that I could no longer relate to and it's slightly odd singing the lyrics of a 21-year-old <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>age.</b> But distance creates a love. I fell out with Alf because I felt like that, after marking subsequent records, it was like {{walking down the street}} and being told, 'I liked you better when you were going out with him.' When you're older you can see that your first love was actually a really nice soul." ...|$|E
5000|$|When {{the race}} riot occurred, Robert Gammon {{was only a}} teenager. All {{he wanted to do}} wash cool down at the Fairground Park {{swimming}} pool. Sixty years later, he can still remember the fear he endured. He remembers the taunts, the bricks, and the fights. When he heard the radio announcement that the pool would be open for blacks as well, he did not think it would cause such backlash. For the longest time, all {{he wanted to do was}} swim in the outdoor pool that had the wooden diving platform. However, he had never experienced such fear as he did when he headed home that night. When he along with the other black kids were escorted to the changing room, he remembers a white woman spitting at him. Once the police escorts separated, Gammon and his friends were chased by whites to St. Louis Avenue before giving up. He even recalls one of his friends getting hit in the head by a brick that was thrown at him. After the riot, he felt that it would be a long time before he could trust white people again. He said, “I thought all white people hated us.” To this day Gammon cannot understand why the riot happened. He wonders, “Just because I’m black?” He remembers the crowds continuing to get larger and larger as the day went on and more fights kept breaking out. Time magazine published an article about the riot in the days following the riot and described the scene as, “Negro boys were chased and beaten by white gangs. In the gathering dusk, one grown-up rabble-rouser spoke out. 'Want to know how to take care of those niggers?' he shouted. 'Get bricks. Smash their heads, the dirty, filthy [...] "-".'" [...] Years later Gammon visited the Fairground Park and leaned against the fence that once had enclosed the original pool. As the years have gone by, he does not see race the same way. He does not continue to hold the belief that all whites hate him; however, he does wish that the whole incident would have never happened. In his eyes, he sees things are better nowadays, but the issue is still prevalent and there is still progress to be made. J.C. Tobias recalls being chased by a mob of white teenagers when he and some friends were walking back home from the park’s baseball diamond. He said, “When you’re a kids, you don’t think much about it. <b>As</b> <b>you</b> <b>age,</b> you realize it didn’t make much sense. We were just up there to swim.” J.C. Tobias was just a teenager when the riot occurred and sixty years later he still has a vivid recollection of the event.|$|E

40|$|For {{the last}} four years of your life, you have been {{supported}} by strength coaches, academic advisors, athletic trainers, tutors, mentors, and coaches. Your life is dedicated to your sport, and your body is molded into the ideal build to compete at the highest level you can achieve. As soon as your competitive days are over, your life dramatically changes and the needs of your body change as well. Because you typically do not sustain the same level of activity, you {{do not have the same}} nutritional needs. The demands you place on your body for your sport are higher than what you will maintain after you complete your eligibility. It is important for you to learn how to implement a healthy lifestyle that is sustainable following graduation and into your adult years. The transition from collegiate competition to normal adult life is a major transition that has thus far been neglected. Athletes often struggle going from college lifestyle and competition to a normal adult life in the work force. The daily structure of college life is gone and you are left on your own to build the life that suits you. Without nutritional and fitness guidance, it is easy to continue the eating habits you acquired while competing while significantly decreasing your activity levels. This can lead to rapid weight gain as well as a number of serious health issues <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>age.</b> The purpose of this project is to provide a “detraining guide” for graduating student-­‐athletes regarding leading a healthy lifestyle after they conclude their collegiate careers.

60|$|Like most old {{physicians}} and surgeons {{who have seen}} much service, and have been promoted to high professional place for their scientific attainments, this Cuticle was an enthusiast in his calling. In private, {{he had once been}} heard to say, confidentially, that he would rather cut off a man's arm than dismember the wing of the most delicate pheasant. In particular, the department of Morbid Anatomy was his peculiar love; and in his state-room below he had a most unsightly collection of Parisian casts, in plaster and wax, representing all imaginable malformations of the human members, both organic and induced by disease. Chief among these was a cast, often to be met with in the Anatomical Museums of Europe, and no doubt an unexaggerated copy of a genuine original; it was the head of an elderly woman, with an aspect singularly gentle and meek, {{but at the same time}} wonderfully expressive of a gnawing sorrow, never to be relieved. You would almost have thought it the face of some abbess, for some unspeakable crime voluntarily sequestered from human society, and leading a life of agonised penitence without hope; so marvellously sad and tearfully pitiable was this head. But when you first beheld it, no such emotions ever crossed your mind. All your eyes and all your horrified soul were fast fascinated and frozen by the sight of a hideous, crumpled horn, like that of a ram, downward growing out from the forehead, and partly shadowing the face; but <b>as</b> <b>you</b> gazed, the freezing fascination of its horribleness gradually waned, and then your whole heart burst with sorrow, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> contemplated those <b>aged</b> features, ashy pale and wan. The horn seemed the mark of a curse for some mysterious sin, conceived and committed before the spirit had entered the flesh. Yet that sin seemed something imposed, and not voluntarily sought; some sin growing out of the heartless necessities of the predestination of things; some sin under which the sinner sank in sinless woe.|$|R
