5|$|Cooking {{onions and}} sweet onions are better stored at room temperature, optimally {{in a single}} layer, in mesh bags in a dry, cool, dark, well-ventilated location. In this environment, cooking onions have a shelf life of {{three to four weeks}} and sweet onions one to two weeks. Cooking onions will absorb odours from apples and pears. <b>Also,</b> <b>they</b> draw {{moisture}} from vegetables with which they are stored which may cause them to decay.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) {{assessed}} both Coquerel's giant {{mouse lemur}} {{and the northern}} giant mouse lemur as endangered. Prior to that, both species had been listed as vulnerable. Populations of both species are in decline due to habitat destruction, primarily for slash-and-burn agriculture and charcoal production. <b>Also,</b> <b>they</b> are both hunted for bushmeat. The population announced by the WWF in 2010 was found outside the limits of a nearby protected area, PK32-Ranobe, which was granted temporary protection status in December 2008 and is co-managed by the WWF. Its forests {{were not included in}} the protected area due to existing concessions for mining activities.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, {{the first}} Cairanoolithus fossils {{discovered}} outside of France were first reported by Albert G. Selles in his PhD thesis at Universitat de Barcelona, {{in which he}} also proposed that Cairanoolithus be moved into its own oofamily. Three years later, Selles and Angel Galobart published a comprehensive reanalysis of Cairanoolithus, in which they formally named the new oofamily, Cairanoolithidae, to contain Cairanaoolithus. Contrary to Cousin's conclusions, Selles and Galobart separated the oospecies C. dughii and C. roussetensis. <b>Also,</b> <b>they</b> demonstrated that Cairanoolithus was not the eggs of an ornithopod or sauropod and conjectured {{that it could be}} the eggs of a nodosaur.|$|E

5|$|In the film, Aksel Winther, who {{is based}} on Vilhelm Leifer, {{is the one who}} gives Flammen and Citron orders to kill. Birkelund pointed out that he had already moved to Sweden by the time of their assassinations, while Madsen stated he was sure Leifer gave orders before leaving the country. <b>Also,</b> <b>they</b> met Frode Jacobsen in a meeting in Sweden, and he is said to have given orders from there. Birkelund {{rejected}} the idea of Jacobsen giving orders, but Madsen said the meetings were created by him to show that the resistance movements of that time had approaches different from those of their present-day counterparts.|$|E
5|$|Lamason then {{instructed}} the group not {{to trust the}} SS, or provoke {{them in any way}} because as they had experienced on the train, the guards were unpredictable and trigger-happy. <b>Also,</b> <b>they</b> were not to explore the camp because of the chance of breaking unknown rules, but to stay together and keep as far away from the guards as possible. He further stated that acting on the group's behalf, he would make further contact with the camp authorities for recognition of their rights.|$|E

5|$|An adult {{dragonfly}} {{has three}} distinct segments, the head, thorax, and abdomen {{as in all}} insects. It has a chitinous exoskeleton of hard plates held together with flexible membranes. The head is large with very short antennae. It {{is dominated by the}} two compound eyes, which cover most of its surface. The compound eyes are made up of ommatidia, the numbers being greater in the larger species. Aeshna interrupta has 22650 ommatidia of two varying sizes, 4500 being large. The facets facing downward tend to be smaller. Petalura gigantea has 23890 ommatidia of just one size. These facets provide complete vision in the frontal hemisphere of the dragonfly. The compound eyes meet {{at the top of the}} head (except in the Petaluridae and Gomphidae, as also in the genus Epiophlebia). <b>Also,</b> <b>they</b> have three simple eyes or ocelli. The mouthparts are adapted for biting with a toothed jaw; the flap-like labrum, at the front of the mouth, can be shot rapidly forward to catch prey. The head has a system for locking it in place that consists of muscles and small hairs on the back of the head that grip structures on the front of the first thoracic segment. This arrester system is unique to the Odonata, and is activated when feeding and during tandem flight.|$|E
5|$|Proposed in 1987 by Brinkman and Sues, Herrerasaurus has {{at times}} been {{considered}} basal to Ornithischia and Saurischia, although Brinkmann and Sues still considered {{it to be}} inside Dinosauria. They supported this {{on the basis that}} Herrerasaurus has a large pedal digit V, and has a well developed medial wall on the acetabulum. Brinkmann and Sues considered Staurikosaurus and Herrerasaurus to not form a true group called Herrerasauridae, and that instead they were successively more primitive forms. <b>Also,</b> <b>they</b> considered the characters used by Benedetto to be invalid, instead representing only the plesiomorphic state that was found in both taxa. This was disagreed with in 1992 by Novas, who stated many derived synapomorphies of Herrerasauridae, such as a distinct pubic boot, but still classified them as basal to Ornithischia and Saurischia. Novas defined the family as the least common ancestor of Herrerasaurus and Staurikosaurus and all its descendants. A differing definition of Herrerasaurus but not Passer domesticus first suggested by Sereno (1998), and more closely follows the original inclusion proposed by Benedetto. Another group, Herrerasauria was named by Galton in 1985, and defined as Herrerasaurus but not Liliensternus or Plateosaurus by Langer (2004), who used the node-based definition for Herrerasauridae.|$|E
