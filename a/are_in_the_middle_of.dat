5|$|Built in 2000, {{the main}} Trinity Road Stand {{is the most}} {{recently}} completed at Villa Park and houses the dressing rooms, club offices and director's boxes. The stand is composed of three tiers with a row of executive boxes between {{the second and third}} tiers. Although much larger than the other stands, the stand has roughly the same roof level as the other three sides. The players' tunnel and the technical area where the managers and substitutes sit during the match <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the stand at pitch level. The press and the directors' VIP area are situated in the centre of the middle tier. The upper tiers of the stand extend over Trinity Road, the street that cuts behind the ground.

25|$|Second, {{the trail}} is served by two parking lots along 23A, both of which require a walk of at least 0.2 mile (400 m) to reach the trailhead at Bastion Falls, just above 23A at {{a bend in the}} road. Due to both the rugged {{surrounding}} terrain and the limitations placed on Forest Preserve land by the state constitution, New York's Department of Transportation (DOT) has been unable to expand the narrow shoulder {{on either side of the}} road, requiring that visitors walk very close to high-speed traffic, including trucks, some of which <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> descending a pronounced grade. The risk of serious accidents is great. Both DOT and DEC have indicated a willingness to develop a solution that will accommodate their concerns, however this has not happened as of 2006. Some hikers try to avoid this by parking near the Laurel House site or at North-South Lake and following the closed route of the former Escarpment Trail; this is equally risky as it is very near the edge of the falls.|$|E

[...] He added that, unlike their promotion efforts for Ghost Stories, the band will tour for the seventh record. In an interview with Jo Whiley on BBC Radio 2, Martin hinted at the style of the album by saying that the band was trying to make something colourful and uplifting, yet not bombastic. He also stated that it will be something to [...] "shuffle your feet" [...] to.|$|E
500|$|The oldest {{stand at}} Anfield is the Main Stand, taking 76 years to complete. The stand was {{completed}} in 2016, however, the lower section dates from 1906. The bottom tier of the stand houses the directors' box. The directors' VIP box {{is located at the}} rear of the lower tier of the stand.

Above the stairs leading down to the pitch hung a sign stating [...] "THIS IS ANFIELD". Its purpose was to both intimidate the opposition and to bring the Liverpool players who touch it good luck. Accordingly, Liverpool players and coaching staff traditionally reached up and placed one or both hands on it as they passed underneath.|$|E

2500|$|Reginald Innes Pocock in 1892 was {{the first}} to realize that the {{exceptional}} characters of the genus Liphistius (the only member of the group then known) meant that it was more different from the remaining spiders than they were among themselves. Accordingly, he proposed dividing spiders into two subgroups, Mesothelae for Liphistius, and Opisthothelae for all other spiders. The names refer to the position of the spinning organs, which <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the abdomen in Liphistius and nearer the end in all other spiders.

After consuming more mescaline, as well as huffing diethyl ether, Duke and Gonzo arrive at the Bazooko Circus casino, but leave shortly afterwards, the chaotic atmosphere frightening Gonzo. Back in the hotel room, Duke leaves Gonzo unattended, and tries his luck at a quick round of Big Six. When Duke returns, he finds that Gonzo, after consuming a full sheet of LSD, has trashed the room, and is sitting fully clothed in the bathtub, attempting to pull the tape player in with him, as he wants to hear the song better. He pleads with Duke to throw the machine into the water when the song [...] "White Rabbit" [...] peaks. Duke agrees, but instead throws a grapefruit at Gonzo's head before running outside.|$|E

2500|$|According to the International Food Policy Research Institute, {{there are}} five stages of school feeding. The first stage {{includes}} school feeding programs that rely mostly on external funding and implementation, while the last stage includes school feeding programs that rely mostly on internal government funding and implementation. Countries that are within the first stage include Afghanistan and Sudan, where country governments are unable to lead school feeding programs. Countries that are within the fifth stage include Chile and India, which have functional, country-led school feeding programs. For example, the Government of Chile has provided a school feeding program for over 40 years through the La Junta Nacional de Auxilio Escolar y Becas (National Board of School Assistance and Scholarships) through a public-private partnership. This program involves technology that allows food to be centrally mass-produced and then distributed across the country. [...] Additionally, the Government of India has supported school feeding programs since 2001, when the country recognized Indians' Constitutional Right to Food. Countries that <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the stages, such as Kenya and Ecuador may have some {{but not all of}} the governmental policies, financial capacities, or institutional capacities to operate school feeding programs without external funding or implementation.|$|E
