50|$|The valley {{has been}} {{populated}} {{at least since}} the Mesoamerican period, especially in the south around what is now Tula. It is considered to be the northern edge of Mesoamerica, with evidence of <b>agriculture</b> <b>on</b> <b>terraces</b> and some irrigation, at least in Tula, as well as hunter-gatherer communities. While there has been work on a number of sites, many have been damaged or destroyed by the irrigation works related to the Tula River, as well as areas in Ixmiquilpan, Actopan, Mixquiahuala, Tlahuililpan, and Ajacuba. In the Preclassic period, there were small settlements showing influence from Chupícuaro and Ticoman. The settlement of the northwest of the valley began in the Classic period by Xajay groups with possible Chupicuaro-Mixtlan connections. The southeast was settled by those affiliated with Teotihuacan, mostly in the Tula area.|$|E
40|$|La presente tesis de investigación titulada “Integrando dimensiones para la comprensión del proceso de abandono de los sistemas de andenería de la comunidad campesina de San Juan de Iris, subcuenca Santa Eulalia, Huarochirí” tiene como objetivo general analizar articuladamente los factores de las dimensiones físico-natural, social, económica, productiva e institucional que conllevan al abandono del sistema de andenería de la Comunidad Campesina de San Juan de Iris, con la finalidad de tener una comprensión integrada de la problemática como base para el planteamiento de recomendaciones para un sistema productivo que contribuya al desarrollo sostenible de la comunidad, así como a la conservación y puesta en valor de sus andenes. Para lograr el objetivo mencionado, la metodología de la investigación se organizó en tres fases en los que se aplicaron instrumentos de diferentes ciencias, como la edafología, la geografía y la antropología, para levantar información de naturaleza tanto cualitativa como cuantitativa. La primera fase de gabinete consistió en la revisión de información bibliográfica, estadística y cartográfica, como base para el planteamiento de la investigación y de la metodología en sí misma. En campo, se hizo el muestro de suelos de los andenes, el levantamiento de información cuantitativa y de percepción a través de encuestas, entrevistas y un taller. Por último, en la segunda fase de gabinete, se recopilaron los datos de precipitación con el {{posterior}} cálculo de la variabilidad interanual, se analizaron e interpretaron las propiedades físicas y químicas del suelo muestreado, y se sistematizó y analizó la información obtenida en campo. Aplicando un enfoque participativo, se involucró a la comunidad campesina de San Juan de Iris a {{lo largo de}} la investigación para que forme parte activa del proceso. El sistema de andenería estudiado pertenece a la comunidad campesina de San Juan de Iris, en el distrito del mismo nombre, ubicado en la margen izquierda de la parte alta de la subcuenca del río Santa Eulalia, provincia de Huarochirí, sierra de Lima. En la década de los 90, esta comunidad se vio beneficiada con una experiencia de rehabilitación de andenes del Programa Nacional de Manejo de Cuencas Hidrográficas y Conservación de Suelos (PRONAMACHCS); sin embargo, al día de hoy, un 59, 7 % de sus andenerías se encuentran en situación de abandono. Por esta razón, se eligió como estudio de caso a esta comunidad. The present research, "Integrating dimensions for {{the understanding}} of the abandonment process of highland terracing systems of the rural community of San Juan de Iris, Santa Eulalia sub–basin, Huarochirí" has as general objective to analyze articulately physical, social, economic, productive and institutional factors that lead to the abandonment of the highland terracing systems. The integrated understanding of the problematic is the base to propose recommendations for a productive system that contributes to the sustainable development of the community, {{as well as to the}} conservation and enhancement of its agricultural terraces. In order to achieve this objective, the methodology was organized in three phases in which instruments of different sciences, such as soil science, geography and anthropology, were applied to collect qualitative and quantitative information. The first phase consisted in a revision of bibliographical, statistical and cartographical information, as a basis for the research approach and the methodology itself. In the fieldwork, soil samples of the platforms were taken, and quantitative information and perception were collected through surveys, interviews and a workshop. Finally, in the third phase, precipitation data was acquired with the subsequent calculation of interannual variability, the physical and chemical properties of the sampled soil were analyzed and interpreted, the information obtained from the surveys, interviews and workshop were systematized and the analysis was made. Applying a participatory approach, the rural community of San Juan de Iris was involved throughout the investigation to be an active part of the process. The highland terracing system studied belongs to the rural community of San Juan de Iris, in the district of the same name, located in left margin of the upper part of the Santa Eulalia sub– basin, Huarochirí, in the Andean zone of Lima. In the 1990 s, this community was benefited from a rehabilitation experience of the National Program for Watershed Management and Soil Conservation (PRONAMACHCS, for its acronym in Spanish); nevertheless, at the present time, 59. 7 % of its terracing systems are in a situation of abandonment. For this reason, this community was chosen as the case study. Field verification carried out by PRONAMACHCS indicates that the abandonment of terraces in San Juan de Iris was in an 80 % due to the water deficit (natural factor) and 20 % to the migration from the countryside to the city (social factor). However, the Andean rural reality is much more complex; therefore, physical, institutional, economic-productive, and social dimensions of the territory were explored in the research. The main drivers of the abandonment of the San Juan de Iris terracing systems were the search for generating economic power (economic-productive factor); migration of young people and adults (social factor); perception of decrease and lack of water resources (physical-natural factor); change in the regime of the land tenure (institutional factor); and dependence on projects and programs of external agents (socio-institutional factor). With the main drivers of the abandonment process of the terracing systems identified, it is possible to propose the actions in order to eliminate the causes of the problem. Otherwise, the consequences derived from the abandonment process will intensify: underutilization of the soil resource and food insecurity; increasing pressure on the natural pasture ecosystem that leads to a risk in the profitability of livestock; loss of ancestral technique and knowledge; and lack of initiative for the conservation of their agricultural terraces and for the development of the community. As a solution strategy is proposed to position the highland terraces as key element in the development of the rural community of San Juan de Iris. For this, the <b>agriculture</b> <b>on</b> <b>terraces</b> must respond to the expectations of the community, so that by their own and shared initiative, they will include this productive and cultural resource in their vision of development.

The system of trade was well established providing both the higher social classes and the general population abundances of gold, feathers, marine snails, coca, yopo and other luxury goods.

They have a simple political life and are governed by Dap-ay/abong and experience {{a certain degree of}} autonomy. The council of elders, known as the Amam-a, are a group of old, married men expert in custom law and lead in the decision-making for the village.Through time the village has maintained a perfect balance between modern and traditional way of living. The modifications on the culture of the Northern Kankana-eys were brought about the interaction with other villages with different customs and the trade relations with the lowland traders. There is also some external influence from the arrival of missionaries bringing Anglican and Pentecostal religions, towards which some have converted. Despite the modifications, the culture of the Northern Kankana-eys remain vibrant and alive.|$|R
