2500|$|Although {{the part}} of Face was written by Frank Lupo and Stephen J. Cannell with Dirk Benedict in mind, NBC insisted that the part should be played by another actor, instead. [...] Therefore, in the pilot, Face was portrayed by Tim Dunigan, who was later {{replaced}} by Dirk Benedict, with the comment that Dunigan was [...] "too tall and too young". According to Dunigan: [...] "I look even younger on camera than I am. So {{it was difficult to}} <b>accept</b> <b>me</b> as a veteran of the Vietnam War, which ended when I was a sophomore in high school." ...|$|E
2500|$|After he {{left the}} Disney studios, Driscoll's parents withdrew him from the Hollywood Professional School which served child movie actors, and {{sent him to the}} public Westwood University High School instead. There his grades dropped substantially, he was the target of ridicule for his {{previous}} film career, and he began to take drugs. He said later, [...] "The other kids didn't <b>accept</b> <b>me.</b> They treated me as one apart. I tried desperately {{to be one of the}} gang. When they rejected me, I fought back, became belligerent and cocky— and was afraid all the time." [...] At his request, Driscoll's parents returned him the next year to Hollywood Professional School, where in May 1955 he graduated.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, come {{to think}} of it," [...] said Mavering, {{laughing}} it all lightly away, [...] "there's no hurry. Tell <b>me</b> why you <b>accepted</b> <b>me</b> to-day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why not? My {{lawyer is}} ready. There are no {{preparations}} to make. You said when you <b>accepted</b> <b>me</b> {{that it was}} to be a private marriage." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But you're not a child--you're not a {{woman of}} moods," [...] Rodney persisted. [...] "You couldn't have <b>accepted</b> <b>me</b> if you hadn't loved me!" [...] he cried.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1960s Moore began {{publishing}} his own poetry and essays in fanzines, eventually setting {{up his own}} fanzine, Embryo. Through Embryo, Moore became involved in a group known as the Northampton Arts Lab. The Arts Lab subsequently {{made significant contributions to}} the magazine. He began dealing the hallucinogenic LSD at school, being expelled for doing so in 1970 – he later described himself as [...] "one of the world's most inept LSD dealers". The headmaster of the school subsequently [...] "got in touch with various other academic establishments that I'd applied to and told them not to <b>accept</b> <b>me</b> because I was a danger to the moral well-being {{of the rest of the}} students there, which was possibly true." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although I am {{ordinary}} and foolish, but I {{have had the}} opportunity to, by my ancestors' largess, receive the opportunity to be an imperial messenger when leaving the capital and a guard leader in the capital. If the administration falls and I am unable to help it, even the most understanding wise man will rebuke me. Therefore, I have organized a righteous army and sought peace with the barbarians to the north [...] to try to calm the earth and to protect Sui. However, for the people under the heavens, there must be someone to rule over them, and other than you, who can be that person? I am too old – over 50 – and that is not my intent, but I am happy to support you, my younger brother. I {{hope to be able to}} climb onto the scale of a dragon and hold onto the wing of a phoenix, and I hope that you, my younger brother, will soon, in accordance with the prophecy, pacify all who are on this earth. You are the leader among the Li, and I hope that you will be gracious and <b>accept</b> <b>me,</b> and to give me again the domain of Tang; that will be enough glory for me. I do not have the heart to hear such commands as killing Xin of Shang at Muye, nor do I dare to listen to the order of capturing Ziying at Xianyang. Also, the Fen and Jin region [...] requires pacification right now, and I am not yet able to arrange a time for the meeting at Mengjin [...]|$|E

6000|$|... "There! Be done, you silly thing! I'm {{not going}} to have you <b>accepting</b> <b>ME</b> before I've offered myself, ANYWAY." [...] She freed herself from her sister's embrace, and ran from her round the room.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{what do you}} imagine? That I {{have been}} {{disappointed}} in love? That I have been rejected? That the girl who had <b>accepted</b> <b>me</b> has broken her engagement? Something of that sort?" [...] demanded Halleck, scornfully.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{take that}} as a compliment," [...] she said quietly, [...] "for it shows at least that I am never sulky. Well, Don Harry, do you <b>accept</b> <b>me</b> as a fellow watcher?" ...|$|E
