5|$|Prior to Adams' performances, finger billiards {{had been}} {{demonstrated}} in New York by French player M. Adrien Izar, who had astonished spectators with an exhibition held on September 20, 1875, before which the game was little known in the United States. In France and England, Izar was considered the game's champion player. The night before his 1878 exhibition, Adams received a telegram in which Izar challenged him {{to play for the}} championship and named Chicago as the venue for contest. Adams replied that he was unwilling to leave New York at that time, but that he would pay Izar's expenses to travel to New York. Adams later issued the following statement to newspapers:I have never intended to play a public match in my line, having never arrogated to myself a superiority above other hand billiard players, <b>although</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> deemed myself the equal of any one living in my line, not excepting Mons. Izar, by whom continually letters are written, whose contents have for their purpose a derogation of my skill. That this may be checked, and summarily, I would state that I am willing to play Mons. Izar a match game for $500 a side, in New York City, Boston or Chicago, on a 5x10 table, full size balls and Collender cushion; the championship and gate money to be awarded the player showing the greatest variety of shots in connection with accuracy, and in all giving the most interesting exhibition of finger billiards.|$|E
25|$|Wright {{expressed}} the following sentiments regarding the CLMC death threat {{in an interview}} he conducted with journalist Emer Woodful in late August 1996:My {{heart goes out to}} my family at a time like this. Well, if you think you're right, then you're right. <b>Although</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> done nothing wrong except express an opinion that's the prevalent opinion of the people of Northern Ireland and I will always do that, dear, no matter what the price. Well, I've been prepared to die for long many a year. I don't wish to die, {{but at the end of}} the day no one will force their opinions down my throat – no one.|$|E

500|$|The lecture {{caused a}} storm of controversy, even at the {{reception}} immediately following his talk. Many English professors in attendance were upset by his remarks; one elderly professor reportedly approached him, said: [...] "How dare you!", and stormed away. Another suggested that Achebe had [...] "no sense of humour", but several days later Achebe was approached by a third professor, who told him: [...] "I now realize that I had never really read Heart of Darkness <b>although</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> taught it for years." [...] Although the lecture angered many of his colleagues, he was nevertheless presented later in 1975 with an honorary doctorate from the University of Stirling and the Lotus Prize for Afro-Asian Writers.|$|E
500|$|Anthony Lane, {{reviewing}} for The New Yorker, called The Fountain [...] "a gorgeous nimbus of confusion." [...] Lane {{complained about}} the film's up-close and far-away shots, [...] "What fails to concern or attract Aronofsky {{is the place where}} most of us hang out—the in-between, the midshot of everyday existence." [...] He summarized, [...] "The movie may have significant truths to impart, <b>although</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> my doubts, but it feels too inexperienced, too unworldly, to have earned the right to them." [...] Roger Ebert, who admired Aronofsky's previous films, conceded in the Chicago Sun-Times that The Fountain was [...] "not a great success." [...] He identified the film's issues: [...] "too many screens of blinding lights," [...] "too many transitions for their own sake," [...] and [...] "abrupt changes of tone." [...] He believed that the scaling down of the film from Aronofsky's original ambition lost some elements and anticipated a director's cut truer to Aronofsky's vision.|$|E
500|$|The British POWs {{provided}} the Americans with necessary advice regarding the camp life and shared rations and clothing {{sent by the}} British Red Cross. The British, {{who were in the}} process of digging an escape tunnel, requested help from the Americans. Juskalian would later describe the operation: [...] "I volunteered, <b>although</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> had claustrophobia ever since a boyhood friend shut me up in a wood bin for a prank. When I look back at it, I wonder how I did it. Some nights when I think about it, I break out in a cold sweat. Somehow, I was able to summon up the will to do it. The tunnel was already some 80 to 100feet long. It extended underground beyond the barbed wire fence, but those in charge wanted to lengthen it so that the opening would come out below ground level on the steep side near the bank of the Fulda River. In that way when the tunnel was broken open, the escapees could not be seen by the guards in the towers." ...|$|E

[...] In 2007, a Canadian actress, Maggie Blue O'Hara, announced plans to renovate and convert the property into {{a home for the}} street children of New Delhi. In 2011, a plan was announced by the state government to build an Ayush Gram on the site. In 2003, Jerry Hall produced a series for the BBC titled Gurus, which included interviews with TM initiates, Jagger, and Cooke de Herrera, and a visit to the ashram in Rishikesh. Saltzman's photographs at the ashram have subsequently been displayed in galleries worldwide, published in two books and in a permanent exhibition above the retail units in the departure lounge of Liverpool John Lennon Airport. Mira Nair began work on a documentary film about the Beatles' visit to India; although no date for the film release has been announced.|$|E

2500|$|It was one {{of three}} songs Lennon was the {{principal}} writer for on With the Beatles, with [...] "It Won't Be Long" [...] and [...] "Not a Second Time". Lennon said that it was written specifically for the American market; the idea of calling a girl on the telephone was unthinkable to a British youth in the early 1960s. For instance, Lennon said in an interview regarding [...] "No Reply": [...] "I had the image of walking down the street and seeing her silhouetted in the window and not answering the 'phone, <b>although</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> never called a girl on the 'phone in my life!

This assumption is {{based on the fact that}} the upper strata of wind in this latitude is always flowing eastward. Mr. Lowe informs me, and I do not doubt his statement, that he will on any day which is favorable make an excursion of the kind above mentioned.|$|E
2500|$|Spinoza's {{break with}} the {{prevailing}} dogmas of Judaism, and particularly the insistence on non-Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch, was not sudden; rather, {{it appears to have}} been the result of a lengthy internal struggle: [...] "If anyone thinks my criticism [...] is of too sweeping a nature and lacking sufficient foundation, I would ask him to undertake to show us in these narratives a definite plan such as might legitimately be imitated by historians in their chronicles... If he succeeds, I shall at once admit defeat, and he will be my mighty Apollo. For I confess that all my efforts over a long period have resulted in no such discovery. Indeed, I may add that I write nothing here that is not the fruit of lengthy reflection; and <b>although</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been educated from boyhood in the accepted beliefs concerning Scripture, I have felt bound in the end to embrace the views I here express." ...|$|E

2500|$|Joubert {{moved to}} Moseley, Birmingham, in 1962 {{to take up}} a Senior Lectureship at the University of Birmingham; he was later made Reader in Music. In 1979 he was a visiting {{professor}} at the University of Otago in New Zealand. The number and scope of his works increased, and among those composed during the following decades were two further full-length operas, Under Western Eyes (Op. 51, 1968) and Jane Eyre (Op. 134) (based on the novels by Joseph Conrad and Charlotte Brontë respectively), Symphony No. 2 (Op. 68, 1970), various large-scale choral works with orchestras including the oratorio The Raising of Lazarus (Op. 67, 1970) and Herefordshire Canticles (Op. 93, 1979), a second and third piano sonata (Op. 71, 1972; Op. 157), a second and third string quartet (Op. 91, 1977; Op. 112, 1986), song cycles with piano and/or instrumental ensembles, and accompanied and unaccompanied smaller-scale choral music. On the wide scope of his work, Joubert has commented: [...] "I've never really wanted to be pigeonholed as a composer. I've always wanted to write anything that I was either asked to, or wanted to write. I've never wanted to specialise, <b>although</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to a certain extent been pigeonholed already. I'd rather not be looked upon as sort of limited in that way." ...|$|E
