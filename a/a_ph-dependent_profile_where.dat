Batch adsorption studies {{were carried out}} to examine the influence of various parameters such as the pH, contact time, adsorbent dose, initial metal ion concentration, temperature and agitation speed on the metal ion uptake. Uptake of Pb(II) ions on the E. crassipes roots showed <b>a</b> <b>pH-dependent</b> <b>profile.</b> The maximum metal uptake values were 164 µg/mL.

The sorbent could easily be separated from aqueous solution {{under the influence of}} external magnetic field due to the ferromagnetism property. A trimodal distribution was obtained for the sorbent with average particle size of 22. 74 [*]μm. The –OH functional groups played an important role for efficient removal of divalent ions. The surface of the sorbent was rough with abundant protuberance while the existence of divalent ions on the sorbent surface after the sorption process was demonstrated. Decontamination of the heavy metal ions was studied as a function of initial metal ions concentration and solution pH. Uptake of the heavy metal ions showed <b>a</b> <b>pH-dependent</b> <b>profile</b> with maximum sorption at around pH 5. The presence of the ferromagnetic sorbent in solution at different initial pH has shown a buffering effect.

It has been suggested that they might act in “biomimetic” analogy to the active site of glycosidases, where also two carboxylic groups are present, and it is assumed that one residue acts as proton donor and the other one as proton acceptor. In the present paper, a series of structurally distinct carboxylic acids were experimentally assessed as catalysts in the hydrolysis of cellobiose under fully identical acidic conditions.

The mutation of D 81 E decreased k(cat) marginally by about 4. 7 -fold and increased K-m by about 8 -fold, suggesting that the aspartic acid at position 81 is important for substrate binding hut can be substituted by glutamate without any significant decrease in catalysis, The replacement of Cys- 151 by Ser to mimic the catalytic triad of chymotrypsinlike serine protease resulted in the drastic decrease in k(cat) by about 1, 260 -fold. This result might be due to the difference of the active-site geometry between the NIa protease and chymotrypsin.

In this study, bovine serum abumin (BSA) nanoparticles were introduced in multilayer thin film via layer-by-layer self-assembly for localized delivery of the anticancer drug Doxorubicin (Dox). BSA nanoparticles (similar to 100 nm) show a high negative zeta potential in aqueous medium (- 55 mV) and form a stable dispersion in water without agglomeration for a long period.

Then the complex was encapsulated into poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) nanoparticles by emulsion solvent diffusion method. The PLGA nanoparticles have a mean size of 168 nm and a zeta potential of − 29. 2 mV. The encapsulation efficiency was increased to 94. 2 % for the complex. In order to deliver insulin to specific gastrointestinal regions and reduce the burst release of insulin from PLGA nanoparticles, hence enhancing the bioavailability of insulin, enteric targeting multifunctional composite microcapsules were further prepared by encapsulating PLGA nanoparticles into pH-sensitive hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose phthalate (HP 55) using organic spray-drying method. <b>A</b> <b>pH-dependent</b> insulin release <b>profile</b> was observed for this drug delivery system in vitro.

The NIa protease was found to exhibit its optimum catalytic activity at approximately 15 ° and <b>a</b> bell-shaped <b>pH-dependent</b> activity <b>profile</b> with <b>a</b> maximum at approximately pH 8. 5. Kinetic studies showed that bothKmandVmaxvalues were lower at 12 than at 25 ° in all three different pH conditions, pH 7. 0, 7. 4, and 8. 3, indicating that the higher activity at 12 ° is due to the lower value ofKm. Interestingly, the self-cleavage of the 27 -kDa protease to generate the 25 -kDa protease occurred more rapidly at 25 than at 12 °, implying that the C-terminal self-cleavage site may interfere with the binding of the peptide substrate to the active site of the protease. Mutations and deletions at the C-terminal cleavage site had no effect on the temperature dependence of the proteolytic activity, demonstrating that the C-terminal self-cleavage is not related to the low-temperature optimum catalytic activity. The fluorescence measurement of the NIa protease upon temperature variation revealed that the protease undergoes a large conformational change between 2 and 42 ° and a drastic transition near 45 °, suggesting that the low-temperature optimum catalytic activity is due to the highly flexible structure of the NIa protease...|$|R

40|$|HpUreI is a pH-gated urea channel {{found in}} the {{pathogenic}} bacterium Helicobacter pylori. This protein is {{an essential component of}} the mechanism of acid acclimation, which allows Helicobacter pylori to survive in the acidic conditions of the stomach. HpUreI conducts urea into the cytoplasm, where it is hydrolyzed by urease into carbon dioxide and ammonia. These products then transit back into the periplasm, where they function as a buffer and proton consumer respectively. HpUreI is an attractive target for small molecule inhibitors for the treatment of H. pylori infections as mutant strains lacking this protein no longer survive under acidic conditions. Despite the importance of HpUreI, it remains biochemically uncharacterized and many questions remain as to how this channel performs its roles. We have solved many of the technical issues regarding the heterologous expression and purification of HpUreI, allowing us to investigate this protein in detail. A robust stopped-flow light-scattering assay was developed which was used to determine the permeability of urea (or other solute) through HpUreI reconstituted proteoliposomes. With slight modifications this assay was be used to measure a wide range of characteristics and variables. Our results show that HpUreI is a hexameric protein that has a relatively weak affinity for urea (˜ 160 mM). Proteoliposome studies indicate that HpUreI is highly selective for urea and hydroxyurea, and is able to conduct water. Interestingly, water and urea conduction is pH-gated, suggesting that both solutes share a common conduction pathway. HpUreI displayed <b>a</b> <b>pH-dependent</b> activity <b>profile</b> with <b>a</b> pH of half maximum activity of ˜ 5. 9. Based on these results an updated mechanism of acid acclimation was proposed. HpUreI is a pH-gated channel; only conducting urea under acidic conditions. The mechanism by which this occurs is not well understood, but can be localized to the periplasmic loops. Chimeric proteins were prepared by swapping the periplasmic loops of HpUreI and StUreI, a pH-independent UreI channel from Streptococcus thermophilus. Our results show that the pH-gating behavior of HpUreI was lost if either periplasmic loop was replaced with the corresponding loop from StUreI. Conversely, pH-gating was gained by StUreI when both periplasmic loops were swapped for those of HpUreI. A model of pH-gating was proposed which takes these findings into account. The mechanism of urea conduction was also examined. The recent crystal structure of HpUreI revealed a ladder of tryptophan residues lining one face of the conduction pathway. Mutation of these residues resulted in lower rates of urea conduction and reduced urea affinity. Our findings indicate that urea interacts directly with the tryptophan residues, via stacking and dipole-dipole interactions, to facilitate urea conduction. These studies have greatly increased our understanding of HpUreI and the role it plays in H. pylori. Further research is required to fully elucidate the mechanisms by which HpUreI operates. However, this is a starting point with which to pursue the ultimate goal of developing small molecule drugs to inhibit HpUreI, culminating in the eradication of H. pylori infections and prevention of gastric cancer...|$|R

40|$|Fe 2 + binding to both apo- and holo- {{bacterial}} ferritin from Azotobacter vinelandii (AVBF) {{was measured}} {{as a function}} of pH under carefully controlled anaerobic conditions. Fe 2 + binding to apo-AVBF is strongly pH dependent with 25 Fe 2 + ions/apo-AVBF binding tightly at pH 5. 5 and over 150 Fe 2 +/apo-AVBF at pH 9. 0. Holo-AVBF gave <b>a</b> similar <b>pH-dependent</b> binding <b>profile</b> with over 400 Fe 2 +/AVBF binding at pH of 9. 0. Proton release per Fe 2 + bound to either AVBF protein increases with increasing pH until a total of about two protons are released at pH 9. 0. These binding results are both qualitatively and quantitatively different from corresponding measurements (Jacobs et al., 1989) on apo- and holo- mammalian ferritin (MF) where less Fe 2 + binds in both cases. The high level of Fe 2 + binding to holo-AVBF relative to that of mammalian ferritin is a consequence of the higher phosphate content in the core of AVBF. Reduction of AVBF by either dithionite or methyl viologen in the absence of chelating agents demonstrated that phosphate, but not Fe 2 +, is released from the AVBF core in amounts comensurate with the degree of iron reduction, although even at 100 % reduction considerable phosphate remains associated with the reduced mineral core. Fe 2 + binding to holo-AVBF made deficient in phosphate was lower than that of native AVBF, while the addition of phosphate to native holo-AVBF increased the Fe 2 + binding capacity. These results clearly support the role of phosphate as the site of interaction of Fe 2 + with the AVBF mineral core. Mossbauer measurements of Fe- 57 (2 +) bound to holo-AVBF under controlled anaerobic conditions indicate that the bound Fe 2 + undergoes a reversible electron-transfer reaction with the mineral core iron and forms Fe- 57 (3 +), presumably bound to the mineral core surface. The phosphate present on the mineral core is involved in catalyzing this internal electron-transfer reaction, a process which may be an important step in bacterial ferritin mineral core development...|$|R
