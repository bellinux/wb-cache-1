This paper was written during my stay at Columbia University as senior visiting research scholar. I {{hope that this}} paper will lead to further discussion of practical aspects of Transfer Pricing Methodologies for Bilateral <b>Advance</b> <b>Pricing</b> <b>Arrangements.</b> The opinions expressed herein are my personal views {{and do not necessarily}} reflect organizational or state positions. It is desirable for multinational enterprises to minimize the risk of economic double taxation arising as a result of transfer pricing adjustments. Such economic double taxation should be, if at all possible, addressed under the condition of rational income allocation between countries. For this purpose we need practicable transfer pricing methodologies. Furthermore, it is better if we have an efficient bilateral framework in which to settle transfer pricing disputes. There is some possibility that Bilateral <b>Advance</b> <b>Pricing</b> <b>Arrangements</b> ('BAPA'), where Transfer Pricing Methodologies ('TPMs') are mainly based on profit methods, can be a reliable way of resolving these disputes. Looking to the past, actual results of BAPA between Japan and the United States may be viewed as a successful model whereby tax authorities have reached agreement in a considerable number of cases of various types related to both inbound and outbound transactions. In this paper, which is intended to be highly supportive of the BAPA, I enumerate the practical points at issue, after taking note of world currents in transfer pricing taxation. I also express some important items for development of the BAPA...|$|R

40|$|Australia’s {{domestic}} income tax legislation and double tax agreements contain transfer pricing rules which {{are designed to}} counter the underpayment of tax by businesses engaged in international dealings between related parties. The current legislation and agreements require that related party transactions take place at a value which reflects an arm’s length price, that is, a price which would be charged between unrelated parties. For a host of reasons, it is increasingly difficult for multinational entities to demonstrate that they are transferring goods and services at a price which is reflective of the behaviour of independent parties, thereby {{making it difficult to}} demonstrate compliance with the relevant legislation. Further, where an Australian business undertakes cross-border related party transactions there is the risk of an audit by the Australian Tax Office (ATO). If a business wishes to avoid the risk of an audit, and any ensuing penalties, there is one option: an <b>advance</b> <b>pricing</b> <b>arrangement</b> (APA). An APA is an agreement whereby the future transfer pricing methodology to be used to determine the arm’s length price is agreed to by the taxpayer and the relevant tax authority or authorities. The ATO views the APA process as an important part of its international tax strategy and believes that there are complementary benefits provided to both the taxpayer and the ATO. The ATO promotes the APA process on the basis of creating greater certainty for all parties while reducing compliance costs and the risk of audit and penalty. While the ATO regards the APA system as a success, it may be argued that the implementation of such a system is simply a practical solution to an ongoing problem of an inherent failure in both the legislation and ATO interpretation and application of this legislation to provide certainty to the taxpayer. This paper investigates the use of APAs as {{a solution to the problem}} of transfer pricing and considers whether they are the success the ATO claims. It is argued that there is no doubt that APAs provide a valuable practical tool for multinational entities facing the challenges of the taxation of global trading under the current transfer pricing regime.

50|$|Tax {{authorities}} of most major countries have entered into unilateral or multilateral agreements between taxpayers and other governments regarding the setting or testing of related party prices. These agreements {{are referred to}} as <b>advance</b> <b>pricing</b> agreements or <b>advance</b> <b>pricing</b> <b>arrangements</b> (APAs). Under an APA, the taxpayer and one or more governments agree on the methodology used to test prices. APAs are generally based on transfer pricing documentation prepared by the taxpayer and presented to the government(s). Multilateral agreements require negotiations between the governments, conducted through their designated competent authority groups. The agreements are generally for some period of years, and may have retroactive effect. Most such agreements are not subject to public disclosure rules.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{transfer}} pricing {{has become one}} of the most important issues for tax authorities and companies. As the area has become more complex this has lead to an increase in disputes and a need for dispute resolution procedure. <b>Advanced</b> <b>Pricing</b> <b>Arrangement</b> (APA) is the latest dispute resolution procedure and was introduced in Sweden in 2010. APAs determine a taxpayer’s future taxation of cross-border transaction by a taxpayer. Through co-operation the taxpayer and the tax authorities reach an APA that aims to avoid double taxation. The legislation is based on the guidance from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and it serves as a framework for many domestic legislations. Other countries with more experience from APAs have implemented additional guidance from the OECD in its legislation but the Swedish legislation has left some options outside. The Swedish APA does not allow for unilateral APAs where an agreement is concluded only with one tax authority in a cross-border transaction. In Sweden, only APAs negotiated with other tax authority are allowed. To increase legal certainty where unilateral APAs are the best or only way Sweden should implement them it its legislation. As the APA process is costly and complex small and medium companies cannot benefit from the advantages. In order for smaller companies to be able to take advantage of the APA program a simplified system should be implemented. In some countries the tax administrations also allows the APA to be applicable retrospective, referred to as roll-back. Through a roll-back taxpayers can avoid potential disputes regarding past transactions as well as the advantages from the APA for future transactions. This can be done while a taxpayer is under audit and is considered a less hostile alternative...|$|R
40|$|Strengthening the {{protection}} measures of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) {{in compliance with}} the TRIPS agreement creates a need for an appropriate tax treatment of IPR by developing countries. This need is important to stimulate locally developed IPR and protect the tax revenue arising from IPR transactions. This thesis examines the tax treatment of IPR in Egypt and India. Accordingly, the thesis employs a mixed research methodology approach consisting of legal reasoning and economic analysis The thesis demonstrates that there are significant differences in the tax policy and legislation relating to IPR in Egypt and India. In particular, the pharmaceutical industry is disadvantaged compared with other industries in Egypt. By contrast, the Indian pharmaceutical industry is given a preferential tax treatment when compared with over other industries in terms of taxation. However, the tax burden on the pharmaceutical industry is approximately equivalent in both countries. Nevertheless, the use of the B-index indicator for tax competitiveness in terms of taxing IPR shows that India is more competitive compared with Egypt. The thesis identifies the role of withholding tax and transfer pricing measures in protecting the tax base related to IPR. These work as integrity measures which reinforce the role of tax incentives to stimulate locally developed IPR. India has a comprehensive definition of royalty within ITA 1961 and stable international tax policy which reflected in its tax treaties with other countries. By contrast, Egypt has a narrow definition of royalty within ITL 2005 and it does not set a definite international tax policy. In relation to transfer pricing measures relating to IPR, neither Egypt nor India has specific measures to deal with IPR licensing and cost sharing arrangements. India has specific measures for managing tax incentives for the development of IPR. Moreover, India has paid attention to exchange of information while Egypt does not has specific administrative measures for exchange of information. Neither Egypt nor India has proper mechanisms for <b>advance</b> <b>pricing</b> <b>arrangements</b> to simplify compliance. The thesis makes recommendations concerning tax treatment of IPR in developing countries. These include (1) targeted tax incentives are necessary to encourage locally developed IPR, (2) a broad definition of royalty and stable international tax policy, (3) proper transfer pricing measures for IPR, and (4) adequate administrative measures to enhance procedural simplicity...|$|R

40|$|Economic {{globalization}} impacts to {{the increase}} of international transactions. The Company does not boundary their operation within their county anymore, but also extends their business performance abroad and may become multinasional and transnational typed of enterprise.

Transfer pricing could be conducted among others with taxes motivation, in which the main objective is to transfer the tax burden from the higher rated country to the lower rate jurisdiction. Under this circumstance, some countries may have losses the potential taxes revenue because of such transfer mechanism. To anticipate the conditions outlined above, Indonesian Tax Law introduces a transfer pricing resolution so called <b>Advance</b> <b>Pricing</b> Agreements (APA).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this master’s thesis is to examine and analyse how a {{transfer}} pricing adjustment is made and how related parties should handle price adjustments from a customs perspective in Sweden. The examination includes describing the valuation methods available for transfer pricing and customs valuation with regards to related parties. In addition, the differences in connection to the valuation are described and analysed. Goods imported to Sweden must be cleared through customs: the importer presents a customs declaration to the Swedish Customs and pays customs duty. The customs duty is calculated using a customs value and customs valuation is the system that enables the importer to establish correct customs values on imported goods. Transfer pricing is the determination of prices on transactions taken place between companies belonging to the same group and has a direct effect on the income tax payable. There are six customs valuation methods that are hierarchically applied and six transfer pricing methods that are applied somewhat differently. There are similarities between the methods {{and most of the}} customs valuation methods have a corresponding transfer pricing method, or vice versa. Even if there are similarities, many factors make reconciliation of the methods difficult. Such factors are the different time for assessing the value and that the customs valuation methods are applied in a strictly hierarchical way with no possibility to choose the most suitable method. Customs duties and transfer pricing both share the same valuation concept, although interpreted differently, being that the value shall be based on the price that the parties would arrive at under open market conditions. However, relevant values on the same transaction differ significantly due to trying to be in accordance with respective rules. The differences in expectations and the conflicting interests on the outcome of the valuation lead to problems in the tax field. As a conclusion, customs valuation and transfer pricing can undeniably be described as “the two opposing and necessary sides of the same ‘coin’, whose respective values unavoidably affect the whole balance of a system of closely connected valuation”. In order for related parties to use the transaction value method, which is the superior customs valuation method, the price must not have been influenced due to their relationship. If one of two tests prescribed by law can prove that the relationship has not influenced the price, the related parties can use the transaction value method to establish the customs value. If the transaction value, for some reason cannot be used, the importer has to address other options on to how to establish the customs value. The conclusion of this master’s thesis is that related parties should include a price review clause in their contract or pricing policy. The company should notify the Swedish Customs about the provisional price and make an incomplete customs declaration. When information enabling the calculation of the customs value is available, the importer should file a complementary declaration. As an alternative, the importer should declare an open claim to the Swedish Customs arguing that the transaction value cannot be applied and, as a consequence thereof, explain in the customs value declaration why the applied customs value is correct. This thesis provides three recommendations concerning {{how to deal with the}} complications of customs valuation and transfer pricing. The first recommendation is that rules and recommendations surrounding transfer pricing and customs valuation should, to the extent possible, be harmonised. The second recommendation is that co-operation between the Swedish Tax Agency and the Swedish Customs must improve, for example through <b>advance</b> <b>pricing</b> <b>arrangements</b> for both transfer pricing and customs purposes, documentation requirements, and joint audits. The third recommendation is that related parties should take the same care and documentation approach for customs purposes as it does for transfer pricing. Importing companies should make a price review clause in their contract before the importation and present an incomplete customs declaration. This way, in case of adjustments, the related party is able to uphold an arm’s length standard on the price and has the possibility to use the preferred transaction value for customs purposes, if that is desirable...|$|R

A consolation reward is most profitable if buyers are risk averse. To motivate buyers to participate in a contingent <b>pricing</b> <b>arrangement,</b> the seller must provide sufficient incentives.

40|$|During {{the past}} three years petrol <b>pricing</b> <b>arrangements</b> in Australia have {{undergone}} several major changes. In particular, the 1977 - 78 Budget introduced a new set of crude oil <b>pricing</b> <b>arrangements</b> which were to have wide ranging ramifications over the next decade- for all consumers. These <b>pricing</b> <b>arrangements</b> were amended in the 1978 - 79 Budget to encompass a policy of moving Australia 2 ̆ 7 s oil prices to world market prices immediately. The impact of these petroleum price increases on the rural sector in aggregate is estimated, for example, at approximately 36 million in the 1977 - 78 period and 69 million in the 1978 - 79 period. This represents an average across the board increase of 1. 2 and 1. 6 per cent per annum respectively, in total cash costs per farm. The assessments given in this paper are tentative and assume a number of factors which may well change. It is therefore important to realise the assumptions behind some of these qualitative statements. These are: (i) price elasticity of demand for petroleum products is more inelastic in agriculture than other sectors, (ii) rural sector 2 ̆ 7 s petroleum intensity remains unchanged; (iii) agricultural producers lack the ability to pass on cost increases; (iv) there is no change in the marketing or distribution of close substitutes to petroleum or rapid change in farm technology.
