25|$|In February of 2017, then-National Security Advisor Michael Flynn named Fontes, a {{colleague}} from {{his tenure as}} Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, {{to be the next}} senior director for India, Pakistan and Central Asian Affairs at United States National Security Council (NSC). Anonymous sources within the Government of India told The Telegraph that they were hopeful Fontes's appointment in the White House would help convey New Delhi's concerns. Senior officials familiar with Fontes commented upon her understanding of India's security concerns vis-à-vis China and Pakistan; that she would be a friendly face among a Trump Administration cabinet mostly unknown to India. With Flynn's subsequent ouster, Fontes's assignment to the NSC was cancelled and the position was filled by Lisa Curtis (<b>a</b> <b>former</b> <b>CIA</b> analyst and fellow at The Heritage Foundation) at the behest of Flynn's replacement, H.

500|$|Robert Baer, <b>a</b> <b>former</b> <b>CIA</b> officer, {{said that}} the agency would be {{outsourcing}} intelligence {{and would have to}} go to the Jordanians [...] "because we simply cannot, as blond haired blue eyed Americans, cannot get into these camps." [...] He said the attack would make the CIA more reluctant to engage with informants. He added that the attack would have been a huge setback for the CIA's intelligence collection in Afghanistan. [...] "You're talking about an institutional nightmare," [...] said Tim Weiner, author of the book [...] Former 9/11 Commission chairman Lee H. Hamilton predicted that the attack would forever change how the CIA handles informants. [...] "They will never forget this lesson," [...] he said.|$|E
500|$|Sixty letters {{asking for}} {{leniency}} for Hastert were {{submitted to the}} court ahead of sentencing, but nineteen of these letters were withdrawn after Judge Durkin {{said that he would}} not consider any letters that were not made public. Of the forty-one letters that were made public, several were from current or former members of Congress: John T. Doolittle, David Dreier, Thomas W. Ewing, and Porter Goss (who also is <b>a</b> <b>former</b> <b>CIA</b> director). The Chicago Tribune noted that DeLay and Doolittle had [...] "have had legal troubles of their own" [...] stemming from the Abramoff scandal, although DeLay's conviction in that scandal was later overturned and Doolittle was never charged. Other supporters of Hastert who wrote letters on his behalf included his family members; former Illinois Attorney General Tyrone C. Fahner; [...] "local leaders, board members, police officers and others from his home base in rural Kendall County"; and [...] "several members of Illinois' wrestling community." ...|$|E
500|$|A U.S. {{intelligence}} {{official said the}} danger of using informants was inherent but unavoidable. Intelligence agencies {{have to rely on}} unsavory individuals to penetrate terrorist groups because no one else has the access. Those hazards would be neither denied nor ignored by the CIA officers. Former {{intelligence official}}s said they were deeply troubled about al-Balawi's ability to get close to so many CIA officers. A former agency case officer expressed surprise that [...] "a potential hostile" [...] was able to be in immediate proximity to a large number of CIA operatives. [...] "Why the officers would show a source all their faces, that alone was a terrible decision," [...] said one former senior CIA paramilitary operative who served in Afghanistan. Larry C. Johnson, <b>a</b> <b>former</b> <b>CIA</b> officer and counter-terrorism agent, said that a source supposedly as significant as al-Balawi should never have been brought inside the base, because it risked exposing him.|$|E

500|$|Aldrich Ames, a CIA counterintelligence agent {{working in}} the SE Division, {{approached}} the Soviet Embassy in Washington, D.C. on April 16, 1985, and within a month received $50,000 from the KGB in exchange for espionage service. Meeting with Soviet official and go-between Sergey Dmitriyevich Chuvakhin on June 13, Ames passed him copied documents identifying over ten Soviet agents working for the CIA and FBI. As a CIA review related, [...] the Soviets began arresting and sometimes executing U.S. operatives later in 1985, and the CIA realized that it [...] "was faced with a major CI problem." [...] Suspicions initially fell on Edward Lee Howard, <b>a</b> <b>former</b> <b>CIA</b> officer who also compromised CIA operations in 1985 and defected to the Soviet Union on September 21. However, the CIA realized by Fall 1985 that Howard was not responsible {{for all of the}} damage. Three agents arrested in Fall 1985 and later executed, some of the CIA's most valuable sources, had been betrayed by Ames, not Howard. By December, six SE agents had vanished, a trend which continued into 1986; according to a congressional report, the over 20 operations Ames revealed [...] "amounted to a virtual collapse of the CIA's Soviet operations." [...] Ames, who stated that he spied for the KGB due to his financial debt, gave thousands of pages of classified documents to the Soviets and later admitted to disclosing over 100 CIA, FBI, military, and allied operations; he was deemed responsible for the arrests and executions of ten U.S. sources.|$|E

5000|$|What {{made the}} {{responsibility}} difficult {{to pin down}} in retrospect was a sophisticated system of institutionalized vagueness and circumlocution whereby no official - and particularly a President - had to officially endorse questionable activities. Unsavory orders were rarely committed to paper and what record the committee found was shot through with references to [...] "removal," [...] "the magic button" [...] and [...] "the resort beyond the last resort." [...] Thus the agency might at times have misread instructions from on high, but it seemed more often to be easing the burden of presidents who knew there were things they didn't want to know. <b>As</b> <b>former</b> <b>CIA</b> director Richard Helms told the committee: [...] "The difficulty {{with this kind of}} thing, as you gentlemen are all painfully aware, is that nobody wants to embarrass a President of the United States." ...|$|R
5000|$|The year 1965 {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of major military activity in {{what became known as the}} secret war in Laos. Although the full extent of the conflict was not revealed to the US public until 1969-70, the war was not all that secret. News of the fighting frequently found its way into the pages of The Bangkok Post, The New York Times, and other newspapers. Congress was kept well informed. <b>As</b> <b>former</b> <b>CIA</b> Director Richard Helms has pointed out, the Appropriations subcommittees that provided the funds for the war were briefed regularly. Also, Senator Stuart Symington and other Congressmen visited Laos and gave every indication of approving what was happening. They believed, Helms noted, that [...] "It was a much cheaper and better way to fight a war in Southeast Asia than to commit American troops." ...|$|R
2500|$|In {{the episodes}} [...] "Father of the Bride Redux" [...] and [...] "Died in Plain Sight", when Ed DeLine travels to Morocco {{to find and}} {{relocate}} <b>a</b> <b>former</b> <b>CIA</b> asset, the false passport he uses is {{in the name of}} Alan Bourdillion Traherne. This {{is the name of the}} character he played, also known as [...] "Mississippi", in the 1966 film El Dorado in which he starred with John Wayne. When Wayne asks the character his real name, he replies [...] "Alan Bodillion Traherne", to which Wayne responds incredulously [...] "Lord Almighty!".|$|E
2500|$|In November 1986, Hoffman {{was arrested}} along with 14 others, {{including}} Amy Carter, {{the daughter of}} former President Jimmy Carter, for trespassing at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. [...] The charges stemmed from a protest against the Central Intelligence Agency's recruitment on the UMass campus. [...] Since the university's policy limited campus recruitment to law-abiding organizations, the defense argued that the CIA engaged in illegal activities. The federal district court judge permitted expert witnesses, including former Attorney General Ramsey Clark and <b>a</b> <b>former</b> <b>CIA</b> agent who testified that the CIA carried on an illegal Contra war against the Sandinista regime in Nicaragua {{in violation of the}} Boland Amendment.|$|E

ABC {{reported that}} waterboarding had been authorized by a 2002 Presidential finding.
