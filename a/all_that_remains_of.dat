5|$|Ben Nevis is <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>remains</b> <b>of</b> a Devonian volcano {{that met}} a cataclysmic {{end in the}} Carboniferous period around 350 million years ago. Evidence near the summit shows light-coloured granite (which had cooled in {{subterranean}} chambers several kilometres beneath the surface) lies among dark basaltic lavas (that only form on the surface). The two lying side-by-side is evidence the huge volcano collapsed in on itself creating an explosion comparable to Thera (2nd millennium BC) or Krakatoa (1883).|$|E
5|$|Kilve has {{the remains}} of a red-brick retort built in 1924 after the shale in the cliffs was found to be rich in oil. Along this coast, the cliffs are layered with {{compressed}} strata of oil-bearing shale and blue, yellow and brown Lias embedded with fossils. The Shaline Company was founded in 1924 to exploit these strata but was unable to raise sufficient capital. The company's retort house is thought to be the first structure erected here for the conversion of shale to oil and is <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>remains</b> <b>of</b> the anticipated Somerset oil boom.|$|E

5|$|Reading Abbey {{was founded}} by Henry I in 1121. He was buried there, as were parts of his {{daughter}} Empress Matilda, William of Poitiers, Constance of York, and Princess Isabella of Cornwall, among others. The abbey {{was one of the}} pilgrimage centres of medieval England; it held over 230 relics including the hand of St. James. Today <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>remains</b> <b>of</b> the abbey are the inner rubble cores of the walls of many of the major buildings of the abbey, together with a much restored inner gateway and the intact hospitium.|$|E

It can be reached by underground on the Northern line to Borough tube station, or by train to London Bridge station.|$|E
5|$|A harbour {{was built}} {{south-east}} of the castle, which would originally {{have been used}} to receive first building materials, then later senior members of the castle household or important guests. <b>All</b> <b>that</b> <b>remains</b> <b>of</b> the harbour is its 246-foot (75 m) quay, built from basalt boulders, and {{it may not have been}} in frequent use during the medieval period, since it could only have been safely used during periods of good weather. West of the castle is a later shieling, the earthwork remains of a longhouse. South of this is a rectangular earthwork, with walls over 3-foot 3 inches (1 m) high, which may have been a siege fortification from 1462. If this is in fact such a siege-work, it would be a unique survival in England from this period.|$|E

5|$|Artillery {{may have}} been {{installed}} at Gun Hill on the coast near Burnham Overy during the Napoleonic wars, {{but there were no}} modern fortifications in north Norfolk at the start of World War I. Following the German naval attack on Great Yarmouth in November 1914, defences such as trenches, concrete pillboxes and gun batteries were constructed along much of the Norfolk coast. The main bases were outside the SSSI boundaries, but Thornham Marsh was used between 1914 and 1918 by the Royal Flying Corps as a bombing range. A World War I concrete building on Titchwell's west bank was let as holiday accommodation until the British Army returned in 1942; some brickwork on Titchwell Marsh is <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>remains</b> <b>of</b> a military hospital dating from that period.|$|E
5|$|At Kilve are {{the remains}} of a red brick retort, built in 1924, when it was {{discovered}} that the shale found in the cliffs was rich in oil. The beach is part of the Blue Anchor to Lilstock Coast SSSI (Site of Special Scientific Interest). Along this coast the cliffs are layered with compressed strata of oil-bearing shale and blue, yellow and brown lias embedded with fossils. In 1924 Forbes-Leslie founded the Shaline Company to exploit them. This retort house is thought to be the first structure erected here for the conversion of shale to oil but the company was unable to raise sufficient capital and this is now <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>remains</b> <b>of</b> the anticipated Somerset oil boom.|$|E
5|$|In 1843, {{the manor}} house was {{destroyed}} by fire, news of which was carried in The Illustrated London News. The estate passed into the Court of Chancery and was purchased by Daniel Higford Davall Burr. In 1848, Burr commissioned {{the building of a}} neoclassical mansion to the south west of the original building. Burr saved the 17th-century manor's wooden staircase, though <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>remains</b> <b>of</b> the building is a staircase to the cellar (which is now home to a colony of bats). By 1851 the new building was complete, costing £20,000 and having a Tudor-like appearance. Burr held the estate until his death 50 years later, when was inherited by his son, who sold it in 1893.|$|E

5|$|Leonardo's The Battle of Anghiara was a fresco {{commissioned}} in 1505 for the Salone dei Cinquecento (Hall of the Five Hundred) in the Palazzo Vecchio, Florence. Its central scene depicted {{four men}} riding raging war horses {{engaged in a}} battle for possession of a standard, at the Battle of Anghiari in 1440. At the same time his rival Michelangelo, who had just finished his David, was assigned the opposite wall. <b>All</b> <b>that</b> <b>remains</b> <b>of</b> Leonardo's work is a copy by Rubens, but Maurizio Seracini is convinced it can still be found and has spent a lifetime searching for it. He was allowed to drill some pilot holes in a mural in the Salone dei Cinquecento, Palazzo Vecchio, Florence, and his team did find evidence of an oil painting underneath.|$|E
5|$|St Mary the Virgin's Church {{has been}} in {{existence}} since the 12th century and probably much earlier. It was once known as the Church of St Peter at Westleigh in Leigh, and straddles {{the boundary between the}} old townships of Westleigh and Pennington, the nave and churchyard, in Westleigh and the chancel in Pennington. Its early history is connected with the Westleigh and Urmston families. Its dedication changed to St Mary the Virgin in the 14th century. The church tower, said to have been built in 1516, is <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>remains</b> <b>of</b> the medieval structure, which was replaced by the present church after becoming unsafe. Paley and Austin of Lancaster designed the present church, the foundation stone was laid in 1871 and the church consecrated in 1873. The church is built in red sandstone it is a Grade II listed building.|$|E
5|$|The AdelaideMannum {{pipeline}} {{crosses the}} park and the Anstey Hill water filtration plant lies on its southern boundary; together they supply 20% of Adelaide's reticulated water.

5|$|The castle was {{in decline}} {{by the end}} of the reign of Elizabeth I. Although the {{stonework}} was sound, minimal maintenance had led to significant deterioration of other parts of the structure. The manor was purchased in 1604 by Henry Hastings, 5th Earl of Huntingdon, who had his own castle in nearby Ashby-de-la-Zouch. The Melbourne property was then demolished and used as a source for building materials. <b>All</b> <b>that</b> <b>remains</b> <b>of</b> Melbourne Castle today is a section of wall about 15m (50ft) long and 4m (13ft) high and some foundations; nothing is known of the internal layout of the former building. The ruins are grade II listed and the site is a scheduled monument. There is no public access to the castle remains.|$|E
5|$|Back at Kiamo Ko, Elphaba {{has already}} {{captured}} Dorothy, refusing to release {{her until she}} relinquishes Nessarose's slippers – the only things left of her dead sister. Glinda travels to Elphaba's castle to warn her of the danger and persuade her to let Dorothy go. Elphaba refuses until she suddenly receives a letter saying that Fiyero has died. The two women forgive each other for all grievances, acknowledging they have both made mistakes. To help her in her future, Elphaba gives the Grimmerie to Glinda. The two friends embrace {{for the last time}} before saying goodbye forever, and acknowledge that they are who they are because of each other ("For Good"). As the mob arrives at the castle, Elphaba tells Glinda to hide, and she watches from the shadows as Dorothy throws a bucket of water on Elphaba, who appears to melt away. Grief-stricken, Glinda sees that <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>remains</b> <b>of</b> her friend is her black hat and the small bottle of green elixir which she had slept with under her pillow.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} known {{member of}} the family Equidae was the Hyracotherium, which lived between 45 and 55million years ago, during the Eocene period. It had 4toes on each front foot, and 3toes on each back foot. The extra toe on the front feet soon disappeared with the Mesohippus, which lived 32 to 37million years ago. Over time, the extra side toes shrank in size until they vanished. <b>All</b> <b>that</b> <b>remains</b> <b>of</b> them in modern horses is a set of small vestigial bones on the leg below the knee, known informally as splint bones. Their legs also lengthened as their toes disappeared until they were a hooved animal capable of running at great speed. By about 5million years ago, the modern Equus had evolved. Equid teeth also evolved from browsing on soft, tropical plants to adapt to browsing of drier plant material, then to grazing of tougher plains grasses. Thus proto-horses changed from leaf-eating forest-dwellers to grass-eating inhabitants of semi-arid regions worldwide, including the steppes of Eurasia and the Great Plains of North America.|$|E
