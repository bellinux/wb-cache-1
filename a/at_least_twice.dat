5|$|Filming {{had begun}} by August1926, when several scenes were {{shot in a}} cave that had been {{excavated}} for the production on Karang Hill. Heuveldorp, unable to force the actors to play their roles seriously, shot several scenes with them acting as they wished before showing them the results; upon realising that their acting had been disappointing, the cast began to listen to stage directions. Afterwards they began rehearsing each scene <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>twice,</b> with Kartabrata standing behind the cameraman and giving directions.|$|E

Advanced students audition for the Acting Ensemble Company, which provides a full season of performances in venues outside the school. The creative writing program focuses on writing as an art in journalism, script writing, poetry, and creative non-fiction. Students participate in writing competitions, internships, and develop portfolios to showcase their work.|$|E

50|$|The {{general theory}} for non-baseband and {{nonuniform}} samples {{was developed in}} 1967 by Landau.

In the 2000s, a complete theory was developed(see the section Beyond Nyquist below) using compressed sensing.

5|$|The {{earliest}} medieval European clockmakers were Christian monks. Medieval {{religious institutions}} required clocks because they regulated daily prayer- and work-schedules strictly, using {{various types of}} time-telling and recording devices, such as water clocks, sundials and marked candles, probably in combination. When mechanical clocks came into use, they were often wound <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>twice</b> a day to ensure accuracy. Monasteries broadcast important times and durations with bells, rung either by hand or by a mechanical device, such as by a falling weight or by rotating beater.|$|E

Another notice in November 1933 noted her impending return to Los Angeles, where she was scheduled to take on a load of borax and scrap brass. In early May 1939, Seisho Maru ran aground in Tokyo Bay, but was refloated after several days.|$|E
5|$|Amin retaliated {{against the}} {{attempted}} invasion by Ugandan exiles in 1972, by purging {{the army of}} Obote supporters, predominantly those from the Acholi and Lango ethnic groups. In July 1971, Lango and Acholi soldiers were massacred in the Jinja and Mbarara barracks. By early 1972, some 5,000 Acholi and Lango soldiers, and <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>twice</b> as many civilians, had disappeared. The victims soon came to include members of other ethnic groups, religious leaders, journalists, artists, senior bureaucrats, judges, lawyers, students and intellectuals, criminal suspects, and foreign nationals. In this atmosphere of violence, many other people were killed for criminal motives or simply at will. Bodies were often dumped into the River Nile.|$|E
