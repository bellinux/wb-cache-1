5|$|After {{settling}} at Glen Noe, {{the chiefs}} {{are said to}} have held the land for centuries. While presumably owning the property outright originally, it is generally agreed that at some, uncertain date, they acquired a feudal obligation to the Campbells of Breadalbane.

Tradition identifies this as <b>a</b> <b>snowball</b> supplied at midsummer and a white calf surrendered but then killed and shared by landlord and tenant as a token of mutual esteem.|$|E

Michael forces Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) to plan a second Christmas party on the day Holly returns to Scranton.

25|$|Interest in {{the notion}} of <b>a</b> <b>snowball</b> Earth {{increased}} dramatically after Paul F.

25|$|Global warming {{associated}} with large accumulations {{of carbon dioxide}} in the atmosphere over millions of years, emitted primarily by volcanic activity, is the proposed trigger for melting <b>a</b> <b>snowball</b> Earth.

25|$|In addition, glacial sediments of the Port Askaig Tillite Formation in Scotland clearly show {{interbedded}} {{cycles of}} glacial and shallow marine sediments. The {{significance of these}} deposits is highly reliant upon their dating. Glacial sediments are difficult to date, and the closest dated bed to the Portaskaig group is 8km stratigraphically above the beds of interest. Its dating to 600Ma means the beds can be tentatively correlated to the Sturtian glaciation, but they may represent the advance or retreat of <b>a</b> <b>snowball</b> Earth.|$|E
25|$|On 5 November 1915, the Queensland Recruiting Committee held {{a public}} {{meeting in the}} Exhibition Hall in Brisbane to {{initiate}} <b>a</b> <b>snowball</b> recruitment march. Snowball Marches—named {{for their ability to}} gather up men along the way—began with the 'Cooees' march from Gilgandra to Sydney in October 1915. The March of the Dungarees was the second snowball march, travelling from Warwick to Brisbane. Another Queensland snowball march was the Cane Beetles March from Mooliba to Cairns for Anzac Day in April 1916.|$|E
25|$|The {{initiation}} of <b>a</b> <b>snowball</b> Earth event would involve some initial cooling mechanism, which {{would result in}} an increase in Earth's coverage of snow and ice. The increase in Earth's coverage of snow and ice would in turn increase Earth's albedo, which would result in positive feedback for cooling. If enough snow and ice accumulates, run-away cooling would result. This positive feedback is facilitated by an equatorial continental distribution, which would allow ice to accumulate in the regions closer to the equator, where solar radiation is most direct.|$|E

5000|$|... ===Great Depression and World War II=== During the Great Depression and World War II, snowballs became {{available}} outside of Baltimore. <b>As</b> <b>snowballs</b> were so cheap, {{they were one}} of the few treats that people could afford. This inexpensiveness earned snowballs the nicknames Hard Times Sundae and Penny Sunday. People in need of a job could sell snowballs, as it required little overhead. The treat became more popular during World War II, when all available ice cream was sent to soldiers, creating a need for an icy treat. This newfound lack of competition helped snowballs become popular across the country.|$|R
25|$|Many {{possible}} triggering mechanisms {{could account}} for the beginning of <b>a</b> <b>snowball</b> Earth, such as the eruption of a supervolcano, a reduction in the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases such as methane and/or carbon dioxide, changes in Solar energy output, or perturbations of Earth's orbit. Regardless of the trigger, initial cooling results in an increase in the area of Earth's surface covered by ice and snow, and the additional ice and snow reflects more Solar energy back to space, further cooling Earth and further increasing the area of Earth's surface covered by ice and snow. This positive feedback loop could eventually produce a frozen equator as cold as modern Antarctica.|$|E
25|$|Earth's {{surface is}} very {{depleted}} in the element iridium, which primarily {{resides in the}} Earth's core. The only significant source of the element at the surface is cosmic particles that reach Earth. During <b>a</b> <b>snowball</b> Earth, iridium would accumulate on the ice sheets, and when the ice melted the resulting layer of sediment would be rich in iridium. An iridium anomaly has been discovered {{at the base of}} the cap carbonate formations, and has been used to suggest that the glacial episode lasted for at least 3 million years, but this does not necessarily imply a global extent to the glaciation; indeed, a similar anomaly could be explained by the impact of a large meteorite.|$|E
25|$|As I {{walked down}} {{at this place}} I was walled on both sides by those {{inaccessible}} high rocky barren hills which hang over one’s head in some places and appear very terrible; and from them springs many little currents {{of water from the}} sides and clefts which trickle down to some lower part where it runs swiftly over the stones and shelves in the way, which makes a pleasant rush and murmuring noise and like <b>a</b> <b>snowball</b> is increased by each spring trickling down on either side of those hills, and so descends into the bottoms which are a Moorish ground in which in many places the waters stand, and so form some of those Lakes as it did here.|$|E
