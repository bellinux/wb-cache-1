40|$|This {{study is}} a {{qualitative}} interpretative study of conflict management in a multicultural Namibian institution. The focus {{of the study is}} to understand how individual people in a particular organization perceive conflict, the possible sources of conflict as well as to explore the possible strategies of managing conflict. This is followed by an analysis of the general educational cultural and social characteristics of Namibia, which relate to the sources of conflict. I also make an attempt to have a deeper understanding of people from different cultural and educational backgrounds in viewing conflict and how these differences might be seen as major sources of conflict and how they deal with it - by using a case study approach. I interviewed 5 participants from different cultural backgrounds. The major research methodology I used in this study is in-depth interviews that allowed me to explore people's understanding of, attitudes to and views on conflict. I supplemented the interviews with participant observation, which allowed me to get first-hand information on how people interact socially and in meetings in order to explore possible sources and existence of conflict in meetings and how the staff dealt with it. Furthermore, I tried as much as possible to observe daily activities as an observer. People interviewed have different perceptions about conflict. Some use conflict to their advantage to <b>arouse</b> <b>discussion</b> and stimulate creative thinking. Some people find conflict to be a burden, something to be minimized. This avoidance leads to poor decisions and poor use of teams as a way to improve both decision making and acceptance of the decisions that are made. Cultural differences among staff and the process of reform emerge as the major sources of conflict. Whether a conflict will result in negative or positive consequences, or both, will depend to a large part on the strategy taken to resolve the conflict. ...|$|E

Methods the basis of research is universal dialectic method of cognition historical and formallegal methods and special and private law research methods including criminalstatistical method of documents analysis more than 60 sentences by the Russian courts in 20102014. 	Results the historicallegal analysis shows that only in the current criminal law homicide of a newborn child by the mother is classed among the privileged crimes. However the circumstances determined by the legislator as crime mitigating <b>arouse</b> <b>discussion</b> and criticism. The study of the law enforcement practice shows that in all mothers found guilty under Article 106 of the Criminal Code the goal {{to get rid of the}} child was formed long before birthgiving the murder was coldbloodedly planned and executed with great cynicism. The authors substantiate the conclusion that the signs that reduce the risk of the homicide of a newborn by the mother should include only traumatic situation and the motherrsquos state of mental disorder not excluding sanity. The paper also substantiates the proposal for a legislative ban on the termination of criminal prosecution due to reconciliation with the victim in criminal cases the consequence of which is death of a person. 	Scientific novelty basing on the analysis of judicial practice the sociodemographic characteristics of women is proposed who were convicted under Article 106 of the Criminal Code together with aggregate materials on the criminallegal measures applied to perpetrators. The paper formulates proposals and recommendations on improvement of the Article 106 of the Criminal Code the implementation of which will ensure the criminallegal protection of the life of babies. 	Practical significance the theoretical findings formulated in the study can be used in the research activities on further investigation of the considered crime and the implementation of proposals aimed at improving the legislation will ensure the inevitability of criminal responsibility of mothers who deprived their newborn children of their lives as well as the differentiation of criminal prosecution of women whose goal to get rid of the child was formed long before birthgiving and the murder was coldbloodedly planned and those who deprived the newborn of life being in a psychotraumatic situation or in a state of mental disorder not excluding sanity. 	nbs...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{the first of a series}} of working papers on data {{processing}} networks of a certain type, termed User-Oriented Networks. The need for some such series of discussions is brought about by current activities at IIASA aimed at creating a telecommunications network connecting Laxenburg with various centers in the NMOs and with at least a few large computing centers. The goals of such a network differ from those of conventional, existing networks and the nature of the network, if implemented as now being discussed, will introduce a number of new operational problems. The main purpose of this series is to bring to light the kinds of problems which will be encountered and to suggest designs which will minimize the difficulties and enhance overall effectiveness. This series is concerned only peripherally with hardware, per se. Other investigators are much better equipped to evaluate particular componentry and necessary hardware interfaces and line protocols. At the same time, however, suggestions which will be made will have strong implications for capacity and compatibility among nodal units and the interconnecting telecommunication lines. In some parts of the series, rather specific recommendations will be made for computers needed as nodal switch points. For the most part, this series is concerned with programming considerations, both for operation of a network and for its use. The programming of application software systems or application programs on large computers is not a principle area of discussion but, of course, the requirements for such work will arise from time to time and provide major considerations for network capability. The term "programming" is used herein in a broader sense which encompasses the flow of data among nodes of the net ork and the kind of higher-level protocols, command and con-trol languages, symbology standards, etc., which will be required. This writer is aware that many suggestions to be made [...] or their implications [...] may be impractical at the present time for either financial or political reasons. However, these cannot be considered permanent constraints or the network can never be realized. On the other hand, it is not intended that anything will be suggested which is technologically or logically infeasible. In general, it is hoped that the series will <b>arouse</b> <b>discussion</b> and criticism by a number of people at IIASA. It is necessary to think very carefully about the consequences of any design decision in such a long-range and far-reaching undertaking as an international network of the kind being contemplated. Part I-B following defines the kind of network contemplated in terms of overall goals and then discusses nine general classes of problems which are immediately foreseen. Part II will take up the inter-user communication problem and suggest an overall network design which satisfies these requirements...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the work is}} to investigate social representations of students of Pedagogy about knowledge of practice. It is based on the Moscovician theory of social representations. The research was made with 34 students in the final year of the course of Pedagogy, 10 from a private University and 24 from a public University of the State of Rio de Janeiro. Four groups were made, two in each University. In order to <b>arouse</b> <b>discussions</b> in the groups it was used as initial resource a reporting style text that described an experience of formation in service. The analysis of the material supported itself in the analysis of thematic content. The results showed a figurative nucleus of the social representations that distinguishes the dissociation between theory and practice in the formation. This meaning can be condensed by a metonymy observed in the analysis of the material, "a stage where it is played a play in which the teacher is the actor". On the 'stage' in which he would be the bearer of the theory necessary 'to play', the teacher makes an 'adaptation' to the different school realities and to the different audiences of students. Thus, the teacher-actor plays his practice and each day the 'show' can be different, depending on the 'scenery' and on the 'audience'. In 'adapting'and 'playing' the teacher builds the 'knowledge of practice' in his daily life of work, which tends {{to get away from the}} scientific knowledge acquired in the formation...|$|R

40|$|A inserção de tecnologias digitais na Educação - neste texto, em especial no âmbito da formação de professores de línguas - tem gerado reflexão em pesquisadores de Lingüística Aplicada a partir do momento em que as teorias que compõem a "Lingüística Aplicada dominante" (LARSEN-FREEMAN, 2000) se mostram insuficientes para abarcar o fenômeno das relações sociais que fundamentam a aprendizagem. Na busca de uma abordagem teórica que dê conta dos movimentos complexos típicos da experiência pedagógica - na qual incluem-se, indissociavelmente, docentes e discentes - optamos pelo suporte no Pensamento Complexo (MORIN, 1995), na Teoria do Caos (GLEICK, 1989), na Emergência (JOHNSON, 2003) e na Teoria dos Valores Qualitativos (PIAGET, 1973) e relatamos reflexões resultantes de pesquisa sobre grupos de professores (em serviço e pré-serviço) em um curso a distância, em ambiente virtual de aprendizagem (AVA). Percebemos que entender os grupos como sistemas complexos nos permite identificar elementos que fomentam sua manutenção e atuam na emergência de comportamentos interativos os quais são essenciais para a aprendizagem sob uma perspectiva sócio-construtivista. The {{integration}} of digital technologies in Education - in this paper, {{especially in the}} language teachers' training - has <b>aroused</b> <b>discussion</b> among Applied Linguistics researchers, mainly when theories which {{are part of the}} "mainstream Applied Linguistics" (LARSEN-FREEMAN, 2000) cannot embrace the phenomenon of social relationships on which learning is based.

Also, reflections resulting from research on groups of (in-service and pre-service) teachers in an online course through a virtual learning environment (VLE) are related here.

Recently the downturn in economy has again <b>aroused</b> <b>discussions</b> on the CEO's high remuneration levels while companies are in reality performing poorly and public has witnessed series of downsizings and lay-offs. As compensation has traditionally {{been seen as a}} reward for good performance, the witnessed events raise the question what are the CEO's actually being paid for. The determinants of CEO remuneration should be looked at a wider perspective as company performance doesn't seem to explain the remuneration levels exhaustively. Previous research has used companies' corporate governance characteristics to look for explanations. In this thesis 117 publically listed Finnish companies are studied to search the determinants of CEO remuneration. The data was hand-collected for the research during the spring 2014 and consists of data from 2013. The main interest {{of this study is to}} estimate the effects of publically listed companies' share ownership structure on CEO remuneration. The study looks into share ownership concentration as well as different ownership typologies to see whether there is a connection with the remuneration levels and use of share based incentives. The results of the study indicate that share ownership concentration is negatively associated with CEO remuneration levels. This suggests that concentrated share ownership results in closer monitoring on CEO performance and less use of monetary incentives. No statistically significant connection was found with shareowner typologies and CEO remuneration levels. Regarding the use of share based incentives, shareowner structure was not found to be statistically significant factor. The results are in some aspects in line with previous findings. Share ownership concentration has been found to lower the pay levels in previous studies. On the contrary we found no statistical significance with the share owner typology variable, which has been recorded before. The categorization into different typologies is quite subjective and with different categorization method the results might change. This could be interesting to study further in the future with Finnish data...|$|R
