2500|$|Pacific halibut have {{diamond-shaped}} bodies. They {{are more}} elongated than most flatfishes, the width being {{about one-third of}} the length. [...] It has a high arch in the lateral line over the pectoral fin, and [...] a lunate, or crescent-shaped tail, which is different from other flat fishes. Small scales are embedded in the skin. Halibut have both eyes on their dark or upper sides. The color on the dark side varies, but tends to assume the coloration of the ocean bottom. The underside is lighter, appearing more like the sky from below. This color adaptation allows halibut to avoid detection by both prey and predator. They are one of the largest flatfish (only surpassed by the closely related <b>Atlantic</b> <b>halibut),</b> and can weigh up to [...] and grow to over [...] long.|$|E

The company has an integrated value chain, {{with the company}} making its own broodstock in freshwater, followed by growth and maturing in seawater, harvesting, manufacturing in processing plants and distribution. Production is concentrated in Norway, Scotland, Ireland, Canada, the Faroe Islands and in Chile, with sales globally.|$|R
50|$|For over 400 years, Georges Bank {{supported}} lucrative fisheries for <b>Atlantic</b> cod and <b>halibut.</b> Over time, bottom trawlers {{became very}} efficient, some catching as much cod {{in an hour}} as traditional boats caught in a season. Bottom trawlers, however, damaged the sea floor coral and sponge habitats, and federal fisheries regulations aim to control this large scale overfishing to establish future sustainability.|$|R
50|$|Due to its {{popularity}} {{as a food}} fish, <b>Atlantic</b> <b>halibut</b> has attracted investment in fish farming. As of 2006, five countries - Canada, Norway, the UK, Iceland and Chile - were engaged {{in some form of}} <b>Atlantic</b> <b>halibut</b> aquaculture production.|$|E

5|$|Apparently {{opportunistic}} in feeding habits, {{the black}} dogfish typically hunts in open water, but also scavenges off the bottom. The bulk of its diet {{consists of a}} variety of bony fishes, including rattails, whitings, rockfishes, lanternfishes, and barracudinas, as well as pelagic crustaceans such as krill and shrimp, and cephalopods. Fish become a progressively more important food source as the shark ages, while crustaceans become less important. Infrequently, polychaete worms and jellyfish are also eaten. In the northwestern <b>Atlantic,</b> Greenland <b>halibut</b> (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) and rattail offal discarded from fishing vessels have become a major source of food for this species, particularly for older sharks that are capable of consuming larger pieces such as heads.|$|R
5000|$|The U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service has {{designated}} Saco Bay as [...] "essential fish habitat" [...] for {{at least}} fifteen types of fish, including <b>Atlantic</b> salmon, hake, <b>halibut,</b> herring, and scallops. Stratton Island in the bay is a wildlife sanctuary owned and run by the National Audubon Society where multiple species of terns nest.

50|$|Fishing is the {{mainstay}} of the economy, with stocks of <b>Atlantic</b> cod, Greenland <b>halibut</b> and Greenland shark. A variety of mammal species are harvested: ringed seal, bearded seal, harp seal, hooded seal, and walrus. There is a seasonal catch of narwhal and beluga - on rare occasions pilot whales are caught. Capelin and fin whales have been observed at Niaqornat as late as in November in recent years. Like other settlements in northwestern Greenland, Niaqornat experiences the effects of global warming.|$|R

40|$|Based on tag-recapture experiments, {{this paper}} shows that {{previous}} age determinations of Northeast <b>Atlantic</b> Greenland <b>halibut</b> from whole otolith surfaces greatly underestimates {{the age of}} older individuals. It also shows that the mean individual annual growth of adults is slightly below one cm per year. Surface methods are much more effective than other more time-intensive methods, which is an important consideration for use in stock assessment. The paper describes a new surface method that is in accordance with growth increments from tag-recaptures. The method relies on improved protocols relating to storing, imaging, choice of reading axis, and definition of annuli. The definitions {{of the first two}} annuli were validated by length frequencies of juveniles. The new reading axis and annuli of older otoliths were validated by tagging experiments involving injection of OTC, a chemical tag that incorporates into the otolith as a visual band marking the otolith size at time of release. With the new method, several measures of otolith size were correlated with age after correct-ing for fish length. This is expected for an accurate age determination method and was not apparent with the traditional method...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge of diet is {{fundamental}} to studies of seal ecology and especially to any understanding of their role as predators in the northwest Atlantic marine ecosystem. Hooded seals (Cyostophora cristata) {{are one of the}} largest of the northern phocids and are abundant in the north Atlantic and Arctic seas, but very little quantitative data is available on their feeding behaviour and dietary preferences. The main objective {{of this study was to}} determine the diet of hooded seals in Newfoundland waters. [...] Otoliths of six common prey species, determined from a previous study on diet of hooded seals, were used to determine fish length / weight - otolith length / height regressions. For all species except Greenland halibut, the strongest correlations between otolith size and fish length / weight were established using maximum otolith length. For Greenland halibut, maximum otolith height gave a better correlation with fish length and weight. Least squares linear equations were used to derive fish length for Arctic cod, Atlantic herring and capelin, while second order polynomial models were used for Greenland halibut, redfish spp., and Atlantic cod. Fish weight estimates were derived using power (log - log) models for all six fish species. [...] Stomach contents of 67 hooded seals collected from inshore and offshore waters off Newfoundland were examined to determine the types of prey eaten by hooded seals. The majority of stomachs (73 %) came from the nearshore region along the northeast coast of Newfoundland and were taken in April. Over half of the samples collected were female (64. 2 %). [...] Fourteen prey groups were identified in stomachs (10 fish, 4 invertebrate). The relative importance of prey, expressed as the percent total wet weight of prey recovered, indicated that Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) was the most important species, followed in order of importance by redfish (Sebastes spp.), Arctic cod (Boreogadus saida), Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus), squid (Gonatus spp.), Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and capelin (Mallotus villosus). [...] Using otoliths from a previous study and from this study, lengths and weights of fish were estimated from a total of 72 stomachs. Hooded seals fed mainly on fish of 25 - 35 cm length for the larger species, and 15 - 25 cm for the smaller ones. Fish consumed by seals caught incidentally from offshore trawlers were larger than those taken elsewhere. The estimated lengths, and proportions (% weight) of fish found per stomach did not differ significantly between male and female hooded seals. [...] The proportions (percent weight) of redfish and Atlantic herring consumed by hooded seals were significantly larger in the summer months, whereas a higher proportion of Arctic cod was consumed in the winter months. No seasonal differences were found in actual lengths of fish eaten. [...] Total energetic values for fish eaten were calculated from estimated wet weights and energy densitites (kJ/g). Greenland <b>halibut,</b> <b>Atlantic</b> herring and Atlantic cod had the highest average energetic values (kJ), followed by redfish, Arctic cod, capelin and squid. Relative contributions of prey, expressed as the percent total energy of prey recovered, showed that Greenland halibut contributed approximately 53 % of the total energy consumed, followed by redfish, Atlantic herring, Arctic cod, squid, Atlantic cod and capelin. These proportions corresponded with those obtained from percent total wet weight of prey recovered. [...] The relative abundance of the fish species has a strong influence on the composition of the food in the diet of seals. Hooded seals spend some time in areas that are exploited by commercial fisheries, and consume commercial fish species of commercial size. However, in order to evaluate the impact of local predation on individual fish stocks, more information on behavioural and physiological characteristics of seals and fish are needed...|$|R

50|$|The <b>Atlantic</b> <b>halibut</b> has a {{relatively}} slow growth rate and late onset of sexual maturity, with males attaining maturity at {{seven to eight}} years old, females at 10 to 11 years, and individuals are thought {{to live up to}} 50 years. Little is known about their breeding except their spawning is seasonal, although its timing varies somewhat with location. In the eastern Atlantic, spawning occurs chiefly in March, April and May, although may span from January to June. Off the American coast, however, the spawning season appears to continue through the summer as late as September. After spawning, both sexes migrate northwards in search of food. Young <b>Atlantic</b> <b>halibut</b> individuals feed on crustaceans such as crabs and prawns. These halibut lie motionless and invisible on the sea bed, capturing any fish that pass within reach, although they may also hunt for fish in open water.|$|E
50|$|They {{are found}} on the bottoms of oceans around the world, with some species, such as the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>halibut,</b> Hippoglossus hippoglossus, being found down to 2000 m. The smaller species eat sea-floor {{invertebrates}} such as polychaetes and crustaceans, but the larger righteye flounders, such as H. hippoglossus, which grows up to 4.7 m in length, feed on other fishes and cephalopods, as well.|$|E
50|$|The native {{habitat of}} the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>halibut</b> is the {{temperate}} and arctic {{waters of the}} northern Atlantic, from Labrador and Greenland to Iceland, the Barents Sea and {{as far south as}} the Bay of Biscay and Virginia.

Young fish are paler with more mottled colouration.|$|E
5000|$|In his 1883 {{inaugural address}} to the International Fisheries Exhibition in London, Thomas Huxley {{asserted}} that overfishing or [...] "permanent exhaustion" [...] was scientifically impossible, and stated that probably [...] "all the great sea fisheries are inexhaustible". In reality, by 1883 marine fisheries were already collapsing. The United States Fish Commission was established 12 years earlier {{for the purpose of}} finding why fisheries in New England were declining. At the time of Huxley's address, the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>halibut</b> fishery had already collapsed (and has never recovered).|$|E
50|$|The <b>Atlantic</b> <b>halibut</b> (Hippoglossus hippoglossus) is a {{flatfish}} of {{the family}} Pleuronectidae. They are demersal fish living on or near sand, gravel or clay bottoms at depths of between 50 and 2000 m. The halibut is among the largest teleost (bony) fish in the world, and is an endangered species due to a slow rate of growth and previous overfishing. Halibut are strong swimmers {{and are able to}} migrate long distances. Halibut size is not age-specific, but rather tends to follow a cycle related to halibut (and therefore food) abundance.|$|E
