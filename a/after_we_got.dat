500|$|Petrucci {{has called}} Portnoy's {{departure}} {{one of the}} hardest things Dream Theater have had to face, and speaking of when he first heard the news, Jordan Rudess recounted, [...] "You know, just to give you an idea of how deep this was to lose him, how difficult it was... <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> off the phone with him... I literally sat on the steps of my studio and cried. This is a guy who's a friend of mine, who we all love and admire. We didn't want to see it come crashing down." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Don't You Wanna Stay" [...] {{was written}} by Andy Gibson, Paul Jenkins and Jason Sellers. According to Sellers, they were at Jenkins' house when they started {{composing}} the song. He explained, [...] "We just {{wanted to write a}} love song. We had an idea of what we were targeting. We didn’t write it as a duet. We wrote it, and Andy thought about recording it. <b>After</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> the song written, we played it for Jason. Jason Aldean's idea for it was to make it a duet." [...] The song is the first duet that Aldean has recorded. In an interview with Nashville.com, Aldean revealed that the song was not originally presented to him as a duet. Nevertheless, he and producer Michael Knox thought the lyrics would work for two people if he could find a female artist as a duet partner. Aldean considered a number of female vocalists to record the song with, especially Kelly Clarkson and Carrie Underwood. However, Clarkson remained as his first choice. He explained, ...|$|E
500|$|Jonathan Davis said {{regarding}} {{the writing of}} the album [...] "Right <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> done touring with Ozzy Osbourne, Ross [...] hooked up with us. We went into a rehearsal studio and started writing. It was faster and thrashier. It was us reacting the vibe that we had to hurry up and get this done. We thought, [...] "Let's do something great, but let's not take a year on it." [...] James [...] "Munky" [...] Shaffer collaborated [...] "Some of the songs and riffs from the first record had been lingering around for years. When it was time to write Life Is Peachy, we went back into the rehearsal studio and we wanted to take the elements that the fans liked and we liked about Korn and elaborate on some of those like Jonathan freaking out. [...] "Twist" [...] came to life. There was that dissonant guitar playing. There was more of a punk rock feel and attitude that the band had. I think a lot of that came from touring so much and the energy of the crowds. We wanted to create a really angry album." ...|$|E
60|$|There came a {{delicate}} exchange of compliments, <b>after</b> which <b>we</b> <b>got</b> to table, {{and for my}} part I did ample justice to the viands.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then,' Eames went on, 'he became rather noisome, and {{we thought}} {{we might as well}} impound the correspondence'--he {{wrinkled}} his swelled left eye--'and <b>after</b> that, <b>we</b> <b>got</b> him to take a seat in my car.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing {{was ever}} done," [...] Miss Brett asserted, [...] "without a certain element of Faith. <b>After</b> <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> the Vote and are {{recognized}} as citizens, then we can come to all these other things." ...|$|R
500|$|The third single, [...] "All My Life", was {{released}} on March 17, 1998, and was the duo's most successful song. JoJo wrote the song about his daughter but originally intended it for another artist. In an interview with MTV, he said, [...] "The song was originally supposed to be used for… another artist, a female artist on A Records. But we listened to it <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> out of the studio and it was like, 'I'm keeping this, this is too hot. [...] "All My Life" [...] peaked at {{number one on the}} Hot 100 and R/Hip-Hop Songs, tying a record set by The Beatles by jumping from 15th to first on the U.S. charts. It was also a number-one song in Australia, the Netherlands, and New Zealand. It peaked at second on the Norwegian Singles Chart, third on the Flanders Belgium Singles Chart, fourth on the Swedish Singles Chart and the Swiss Singles Chart, eighth on the UK Singles Chart, 11th on the Wallonia Belgium Singles Chart, 12th on the Austrian Singles Chart, and 43rd on the French Singles Chart. It was certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association and gold by IFPI Sweden. [...] "All My Life" [...] was nominated for Best R Video at the 1999 MTV Video Music Awards.|$|E
500|$|Pamela's {{marriage}} to Bobby Ewing {{is central to}} understanding her character. The couple produced the opening scene of Dallas when the show first aired in 1978, with Bobby bringing his new bride home to meet Jock and Miss Ellie Ewing. [...] Their complex relationship has often been {{compared to that of}} Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. When asked about whether or not series creator David Jacobs had this parallel relationship in mind from the start, he said: [...] "Yes, guilty (laughs)". Relations can be made from William Shakespeare's two feuding families in Romeo and Juliet, the Montagues and the Capulets. These families represent the Barnes and the Ewing feuding families, with Pamela being portrayed as Juliet Capulet and Bobby as Romeo Montague. According to Patrick Duffy, being immediately paired off with Principal was a challenge. He said, [...] "We were {{in a constant state of}} competition. We were very territorial in front of the camera, and it was a strain." [...] However, their off-screen relationship significantly improved in the show's third season, with Duffy explaining: [...] "I developed an appreciation for her, and I think for the first time she started to trust me. Some of the best scenes on the show were between Victoria and me, and they happened <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> comfortable with each other." ...|$|E
500|$|Lee Ruth Davis, her sister, and two {{brothers}} were {{hidden by the}} Wrights while their father hid in the woods. On the morning of Poly Wilkerson's funeral, the Wrights left the children alone to attend. Davis and her siblings crept {{out of the house}} to hide with relatives in the nearby town of Wylly, but they were turned back for being too dangerous. The children spent the day in the woods but decided to return to the Wrights' house. After spotting men with guns on their way back, they crept back to the Wrights, who were frantic with fear. Davis later described the experience: [...] "I was laying that deep in water, that is where we sat all day long... We got on our bellies and crawled. We tried to keep people from seeing us through the bushes... We were trying to get back to Mr. Wright house. <b>After</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> all the way to his house, Mr. and Mrs. Wright were all the way out in the bushes hollering and calling us, and when we answered, they were so glad." [...] Several other white residents of Sumner hid black residents of Rosewood and smuggled them out of town. Gainesville's black community took in many of Rosewood's evacuees, waiting for them at the train station and greeting survivors as they disembarked, covered in sheets. On Sunday, January 7, a mob of 100 to 150 whites returned to burn the remaining dozen or so structures of Rosewood.|$|E
5000|$|Ellie continued: [...] "Couple {{of weeks}} {{after they were}} auditioning the sister role. So they were just doing the {{brothers}} and then they do the sisters <b>after</b> that. But <b>we</b> (sic) just went in and we read together and <b>we</b> <b>got</b> a callback. The following couple of days <b>after</b> that, <b>we</b> <b>got</b> a callback and then it kind of went off with that." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>After</b> that, <b>we</b> <b>got</b> on fine. Whenever I heard {{anyone at}} the window I just kept curled up and took no notice, and every time I got a bone or {{something}} good. It was easy, once you had got the hang of things.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And we couldn't {{turn back}} <b>after</b> <b>we</b> once <b>got</b> into Alaska. There {{is no such}} thing as {{travelling}} back and forth between the months of October and May. The rivers freeze up, and everything is snow and ice." ...|$|R
2500|$|During {{the final}} fifteen {{months of the}} war, Matthews reports, [...] "we were not {{accustomed}} to [...] {{as much as we}} could eat, in consequence of which our stomachs became drawn and contracted; and for two years or more <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> home, we could not eat as much as we could before we entered the army." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Other Indians {{came to us}} <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> {{most of the men}} at the ravine. We all kept {{after them}} until they got to where Custer was. There was only a few of them left then. By that time all the Indians in the village got their horses and guns and watched Custer. When Custer got nearly to {{the lower end of the}} camp. he started to go down a gulch, but the Indians were {{surrounding}} him, and he tried to fight. They got off their horses and made a stand but it was no use. Their horses ran down the ravine right into the village. The squaws caught them as fast as they came. One of them was a sorrel with white stocking. Long time after some of our relatives told us that they had seen Custer on that kind of horse when he was on the way to the Big Horn." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the conflict, Nehru wrote two desperate {{letters to}} US President John F. Kennedy, {{requesting}} 12 squadrons of fighter jets and a modern radar system. These jets {{were seen as}} necessary to beef up Indian air strength so that air-to-air combat could be initiated safely from the Indian perspective (bombing troops was seen as unwise for fear of Chinese retaliatory action). Nehru also asked that these aircraft be manned by American pilots until Indian airmen were trained to replace them. These requests were rejected by the Kennedy Administration (which {{was involved in the}} Cuban Missile Crisis during most of the Sino-Indian War), leading to a cool down in Indo-US relations. According to former Indian diplomat G Parthasarathy, [...] "only <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> nothing from the US did arms supplies from the Soviet Union to India commence". Per Time Magazine's 1962 editorial on the war, however, this {{may not have been the}} case. The editorial states, 'When Washington finally turned its attention to India, it honoured the ambassador's pledge, loaded 60 US planes with $5,000,000 worth of automatic weapons, heavy mortars and land mines. Twelve huge C-130 Hercules transports, complete with US crews and maintenance teams, took off for New Delhi to fly Indian troops and equipment to the battle zone. Britain weighed in with Bren and Sten guns, and airlifted 150 tons of arms to India. Canada prepared to ship six transport planes. Australia opened Indian credits for $1,800,000 worth of munitions'.|$|E
60|$|<b>After</b> <b>we</b> were <b>got</b> {{well into}} the town, we found {{ourselves}} part of an immense bicycle parade, with bicyclers of both sexes on their wheels, in masks and costumes, Pierrots, and Clowns, and Harlequins and Columbines, in a competition for the prettiest and fanciest dress.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hurrah for Nippon!" [...] cried Larry, enthusiastically. [...] "Luke, <b>after</b> this <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> {{to learn}} to yell Banzai! in true Japanese style." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{must see}} to the other wounds <b>after</b> <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> him away," [...] he said. [...] "Now, Hassan, do you two bind one of those spare {{blankets}} to the shaft of the two spears, wind it round them until the sides are not more than three feet apart." ...|$|R

50|$|<b>After</b> the Bitch <b>We</b> <b>Got</b> A Problem Tour, Baird {{continued}} to work with KoRn frontman Jonathan Davis on his Alone I Play tour {{as a part of}} his backing band SFA.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let's be serious," [...] Kenwyne replied. [...] "There's {{something}} to be said for his contention, <b>after</b> all. <b>We</b> have <b>got</b> along pretty well so far." ...|$|R
5000|$|McQuilken added, [...] "We're so disappointed. You don't win {{anything}} by giving Rangers a two-goal lead and we don't think we'll {{ever get a}} better chance to beat Rangers. <b>After</b> <b>we</b> scored <b>we</b> <b>got</b> an extra spring in our step and they looked worried and tired. They were arguing amongst themselves and I thought 'we've got a right good chance here'. We needed to score in the first five minutes after our second goal when we were on top. But credit to Rangers, you don't get to UEFA Cup finals for nothing." ...|$|R
60|$|Our {{master and}} {{mistress}} came <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> in; {{and as soon}} as they did come we were told, downstairs, that company was expected from the country.|$|E

6000|$|... "'Do {{you want}} me to understand, sir, that you mind there being one life more or less on this earth?' I asked him, a few hours <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> away.|$|E
6000|$|I said I had {{got it on}} the boat. So {{then she}} started for the house, leading me by the hand, and the {{children}} tagging <b>after.</b> When <b>we</b> <b>got</b> there she set me down in a split-bottomed chair, and set herself down on a little low stool in front of me, holding both of my hands, and says: ...|$|R
60|$|<b>After</b> breakfast <b>we</b> <b>got</b> a time-table, {{and looked}} out for a train to Ober-Ammergau. I found one which started at 3.10. It seemed a very nice train indeed; it did not stop anywhere. The railway {{authorities}} themselves were evidently very proud of it, and had printed particulars of it in extra thick type. We decided to patronise it.|$|R
6000|$|... "We are {{broke up}} a bit," [...] John Little said. [...] "It wasn't to be {{expected}} as we should hang together long <b>after</b> <b>we</b> once <b>got</b> out here; one thought one place best, and another another; but I and my two mates here, and long Simpson, and Alick, and Jones, we have stuck together." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We might {{carry you}} {{as far as}} Nottingham, if you'd agree to ship on some other craft <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> there," [...] Jerry said without {{stopping}} to ask my permission.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not that I know of," [...] Quest assured her. [...] "As {{a matter}} of fact, I was called downstairs {{to see one of}} my men soon <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes, we {{were safe}} enough, <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> to the shack," [...] said Laura, {{in answer to}} a {{question}} from her brother. [...] "But, oh, how it did blow!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No {{more just}} now," [...] said Snap. [...] "We must keep {{something}} for supper and for breakfast, you know. <b>After</b> that <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> {{to live on}} regular camp fare." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, lad--no--not for salvation," [...] {{returned}} Evan; [...] "we {{have only}} to accept salvation--to cease from refusing it and scorning it. <b>After</b> <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> it from and in Jesus, we will pray, and sing, and work, ay, an' preach too, if we can, {{for the love of}} the Master who `loved us and gave Himself for us.'" ...|$|R
60|$|So with a groan I {{consigned}} {{all these}} valuables to my capacious pockets. Then I locked up the empty safe, replaced the keys where I had found them on Marnham, fastened the shutter {{and left the}} room with Anscombe, waiting for a while outside till Heda joined us, sobbing a little. <b>After</b> this <b>we</b> <b>got</b> something to eat, insisting on Heda doing the same.|$|R
