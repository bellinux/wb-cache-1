LHCII <b>apoproteins</b> were not detected in etiolated cotyledons. Upon illumination, Chi a was formed {{as a result of}} photoconversion of protochlorophyllide (Pchlide) which had ac-cumulated in the dark. During the lag period that preceded the accumulation of Chi, a small amount of LHCII <b>apoproteins</b> appeared. The amount of LHCII <b>apoproteins</b> increased with in-creases in levels of Chi b, though somewhat more rapidly during the first 10 h of greening. Treat-ment with benzyladenine (BA) or levulinic acid (LA) was used to vary the supply of Chi a for <b>apoproteins</b> by promoting or inhibiting the synthesis of Chi a, respectively. LA decreased but BA increased the rate of accumulation of Chi b and LHCII <b>apoproteins.</b> Only small amounts of Chi b and LHCII <b>apoproteins</b> were formed under intermittent illumination.

40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} for the chromatographic separation of mixtures of egg-yolk proteins of low solubility {{by using a}} hydrophobic column (phenyl-Sepharose) and eluting with increasing concentrations of aqueous urea at low pH. The resolving power of the method was established by tests on proteins and protein fragments of known sequence. The theoretical basis for the method remains, however, unclear. Factors such as the aggregation of the protein often appeared {{to be more important}} than its hydrophobicity in determining the urea concentration needed for elution. The method was applied to the mixture of <b>apoproteins</b> from the low-density lipoprotein (density about 0. 95 g/ml) of avian egg yolk. For the previously studied <b>apoproteins</b> from egg yolk of the hen (Gallus domesticus), hydrophobic chromatography provided a new and convenient method for isolating the main <b>apoproteins</b> (hen apovitellenins I-VI). For the hitherto unexplored <b>apoproteins</b> from egg yolk of the duck (Anas platyrhynchos) the method has now been used to isolate three new proteins, two of which were not readily separated by methods based on molecular size.

Our data suggest that warfarin does not interfere with synthesis and secretion of these proteins into dog lung surfactant. Abnormal surfactant <b>apoproteins,</b> produced in response to warfarin treatment of the dog, were also not found in lung surfactant. 4 -Carboxyglutamic acid analysis of purified dog <b>apoproteins</b> also failed to detect the vitamin K-modification. When vitamin K-dependent 14 C labelling of precursors of vitamin K-dependent proteins was carried out, fluorography of these precursors, when electrophoresed into SDS/polyacrylamide gels, revealed 14 C-labelled proteins of apparent molecular mass 74, 46, 42, 34, 31 and 23 kDa.

40|$|<b>Apoproteins</b> from plasma lipoproteins were {{localized}} by immunofluorescence {{techniques in}} human carotid artery atherosclerotic lesions. These studies were performed {{in light of}} the possi-ble importance of these <b>apoproteins</b> in both lipid metabolism and the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. ApoA-I from high density lipoproteins, apoB from low density lipoproteins, and apoC-III from very low density lipoproteins were localized also as markers for their respec-tive lipoproteins, since the latter cross-react immunologically. The three <b>apoproteins</b> were localized to the same regions of lesions as neutral lipids and, to some extent, fibrinogen. These regions consisted of bands of collagen fibers, usually deeper within the lesion, and the lipid core or atheroma of such advanced lesions. Although the superposition of localization for the three <b>apoproteins</b> and lipid was only 53 %, it was suggested that deviation from complete superposi-tion was due to the abrupt changes in lesion structure resulting from the focal nature of the atherosclerotic process. These results suggest that there is a broader specificity than previously implied of the interaction between such lesion components as connective tissue and extracellular lipid accumulations, and <b>apoproteins</b> from plasma lipoproteins. This interaction is believed to result in a net retention within atherosclerotic lesions of human extracranial arteries of these plasma-derived factors, either as free <b>apoproteins</b> or as native lipoproteins.

To examine the role of intact HDL <b>apoproteins</b> in receptor-mediated cholesterol removal, HDL 3 <b>apoproteins</b> were digested with the proteolytic enzymes trypsin and pronase, and the residual particles were used in sterol efflux experiments. Protease treatment abolished the interaction of HDL, with the 110 -kd cell membrane protein postulated to represent the HDL receptor molecule, indicating that this interaction is mediated by HDL <b>apoproteins</b> rather than lipids. Compared with native HDL 3, protease-modified HDL, had a markedly reduced ability to selectively remove sterol from intracellular pools, even though modified particles promoted greater cholesterol efflux from the plasma membrane than did native particles. These results indicate that whereas sterol efflux from plasma membranes is mediated by HDL lipids, removal of excess intracellular sterol from cells is mediated by HDL <b>apoproteins.</b> These {{findings are consistent with}} the hypothesis that receptor binding of HDL <b>apoproteins</b> stimulates translocation of excess intracellular sterol to the cell surface where it becomes accessible for removal by HDL or other lipid-rich acceptor particles.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{pulmonary}} surfactant contains nonserum proteins, which are called pulmonary surfactant <b>apoproteins.</b> However, only a few papers have reported on the behavior of <b>apoproteins</b> in various pathological states. In a previous paper, we reported on the changes in phospholipid metabolism of pulmonary surfactant for rats intratracheally exposed to silica. The present paper describes the changes in <b>apoproteins</b> as a series of studies on the pulmonary surfactant of rats exposed to silica. Adult rats exposed intratracheally to silica (40 mg/kg of body weight) were killed 28 days after silica treatment. The lung fractions were then isolated and the proteins contained in the lung fractions were analyzed. Polyclonal antibodies to rat pulmonary surfactant <b>apoproteins</b> were prepared, which recognized 26 kD, 32 kD, 38 kD and 43 kD proteins in control rats. In the lungs treated by silica, the protein content of extracellular surfactant fractions, i. e., P- 1 and P- 2, increased to 2 - 2. 5 fold. A marked accumulation of 32 kD and 38 kD proteins was found in P- 1 fraction which consisted mainly of cellular components such as macrophages. The P- 1 fraction also contained several protein bands of small molecular weights which were not observed in control rats. These protein bands were stained by the immunoblot method using the antibodies to surfactant <b>apoproteins.</b> These findings indicate that pulmonary surfactant <b>apoproteins</b> accumulate markedly in the alveolar space of rats exposed to silica, and they are partly degradated to peptide fragments in the alveolar space. Immunohistochemical studies using the antibodies showed distinct stainings of amorphus materials and macrophages which were accumulated markedly in the alveolar space of rats exposed to silica. Alveolar type II cells which were also stained by the antibodies seemed to be somewhat atrophied probably by the pressure due to a marked accumulation of pulmonary surfactant in the alveolar space...|$|R

This isotherm presented three transitions (neutral lipid (surface pressure, pi= 19 mN/m), apoprotein-lipid (pi= 41 mN/m) and phospholipid (pi= 51 mN/m) transitions). We have studied only the apoprotein-lipid transition. In order to observe the LDL film structure before (pi= 30 mN/m) and after (pi= 45 mN/m) the apoprotein-lipid transition, the formed films were transferred and visualised by atomic force microscopy (AFM).
