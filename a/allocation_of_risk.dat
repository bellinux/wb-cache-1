5000|$|In 1992, the Conservative {{government}} of John Major in the UK introduced the PFI, the first systematic programme aimed at encouraging public-private partnerships. The 1992 programme focused on reducing {{the public sector}} borrowing requirement, although, as already noted, the effect on public accounts was largely illusory. The Labour {{government of}} Tony Blair, elected in 1997, expanded the PFI initiative but sought to shift the emphasis to the achievement of [...] "value for money," [...] mainly through an appropriate <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk.</b> However, it has since been found that many programs ran dramatically over budget and have not presented as value for money for the taxpayer, with some projects costing more to cancel than to complete.|$|E
5000|$|One {{response}} to these negative findings was the development of formal procedures {{for the assessment of}} PPPs in which the focus was on [...] "value for money" [...] rather than reductions in debt. The underlying framework was one in which value for money was achieved by an appropriate <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk.</b> These assessment procedures were incorporated in the private finance initiative and its Australian counterparts from the late 1990s onwards. Another model being discussed is the public-private community partnership (PPCP), in which both the government and private players work together for social welfare, eliminating the prime focus of private players on profit. This model is being applied more in developing nations such as India.|$|E

40|$|As {{societies}} are increasingly concerned with risks, {{it is important}} to evaluate risks not only from an individual but also from a societal perspective. Two essential dimensions of public or social risks are the inequality concerning the distribution <b>of</b> <b>risks</b> over various groups and members of society and the level <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> faced by individuals and by the society as a whole. This paper disentangles these two essential dimensions and studies people’s preferences concerning different types <b>of</b> <b>allocations</b> <b>of</b> <b>risks</b> over groups <b>of</b> people. We do so in a laboratory experiment with real incentives, where subjects are placed in the role of a social planner and choose between different types <b>of</b> <b>allocations</b> <b>of</b> <b>risks</b> over 10 other participants. The allocations differ only in terms of dispersion, i. e. they differ only in terms <b>of</b> inequality and <b>risk.</b> The majority <b>of</b> our subjects exhibit clear preferences over different types <b>of</b> <b>allocations</b> consistent with ex ante inequality and individual risk aversion, and ex post inequality and collective risk seeking behavior. These results are consistent with the literature on public risk and can be reconciled with responsibility aversion...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{some positive}} and normative {{aspects of the}} inflation indexation {{of public and private}} pensions. The analysis shows that alternative indexing arrangements may have far less impact on actual patterns <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> bearing than is usually thought to be the case. In so far as inflation indexing has real effects, there is no presumption that they are beneficial. In particular, the pre—commitment aspects of public indexing may not be efficient. There are sound reasons to believe that voluntarily agreed on, non—indexed private pensions may well be efficient. Non—indexed pensions may result in an efficient <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>risks</b> given the other assets and liabilities of pension issuers and beneficiaries. In this case, indexation would impede the efficient <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>risks.</b> In this paper is also developed an ICOLI (interteinporal cost of living index) which is superior to conventional price indices as a way of evaluating the changes in real well being, associated with changes in wealth. The use of this measure has significant implications for the indexation of pensions, and for the question of what assets should be held in pension portfolios...|$|R
5000|$|Failure of {{consideration}} is a technical legal term referring to {{situations in which}} one person confers a benefit upon another upon some condition or basis ("consideration") which fails to materialise or subsist. It is {{also referred to as}} [...] "failure of basis". It is an 'unjust factor' {{for the purposes of the}} law of unjust enrichment. Where there is a [...] "total failure {{of consideration}}" [...] the claimant can seek restitution of the benefit by bringing an action in unjust enrichment against the defendant. Historically speaking, this was as a quasi-contractual claim known as an action for money had and received to the plaintiff's use for a consideration that wholly failed. The orthodox view is that it is necessary for any relevant contract to be ineffective, for example because it is discharged for breach, void ab initio (from the beginning) or (iii) frustrated.

These risks are faced by all parties involved in a project – owners, contractors, designers, suppliers, etc. However, the more important role the parties play {{in the development and}} successful completion of the project, the greater risks they have to carry. Such parties are the owner and the contractor who conclude a contract to carry out construction works.
