5|$|It is {{possible}} to mimic this <b>asymmetry</b> in the laboratory in model bilayer systems. Certain types of very small artificial vesicle will automatically make themselves slightly asymmetric, although the mechanism by which this <b>asymmetry</b> is generated {{is very different from}} that in cells. By utilizing two different monolayers in Langmuir-Blodgett deposition or a combination of Langmuir-Blodgett and vesicle rupture deposition it is also possible to synthesize an asymmetric planar bilayer. This <b>asymmetry</b> may be lost over time as lipids in supported bilayers can be prone to flip-flop.|$|E

In many cases the adult patterns of behavioral and brain <b>asymmetries</b> were modified by early handling in a sexually dimorphic manner. In addition, the direction of postural/motor <b>asymmetries</b> was very much task-dependent, especially in females. We conclude that: (1) early experience may modify the development of behavioral and brain asymmetries; (2) sex differences in <b>asymmetries</b> are very common; (3) early handling may affect males and females differently; and (4) different measures of postural/motor <b>asymmetries</b> may reflect different and multiple brain <b>asymmetries...</b>|$|R

5|$|The Reuleaux {{triangle}} is {{the least}} symmetric curve of constant width according to two different measures of central <b>asymmetry,</b> the Kovner–Besicovitch measure (ratio of area to the largest centrally symmetric shape enclosed by the curve) and the Estermann measure (ratio of area to the smallest centrally symmetric shape enclosing the curve). For the Reuleaux triangle, the two centrally symmetric shapes that determine the measures of <b>asymmetry</b> are both hexagonal, although the inner one has curved sides. The Reuleaux triangle has diameters that split its area more unevenly than any other curve of constant width. That is, the maximum ratio of areas {{on either side of}} a diameter, another measure of <b>asymmetry,</b> is bigger for the Reuleaux triangle than for other curves of constant width.|$|E
5|$|The {{feathers}} of Archaeopteryx were asymmetrical. This {{has been interpreted}} as evidence {{that it was a}} flyer, because flightless birds tend to have symmetrical feathers. Some scientists, including Thomson and Speakman, have questioned this.

They proposed that cochlear and brainstem <b>asymmetries</b> facilitate development of brain-hemispheric specialization for sound processing. Similarly, in 2006 Sininger and Cone-Wesson described ear <b>asymmetries</b> mainly favoring the right ear in infant auditory brainstem responses (ABRs). The present study analyzed 2640 infant responses to further explore these effects. Ear differences in OAE SNR, signal, and noise were evaluated separately and across frequencies (1. 5, 2, 3, and 4 kHz), and ABR <b>asymmetries</b> were compared with cochlear <b>asymmetries.</b> Analyses of ear-canal reflectance and admittance showed that <b>asymmetries</b> in middle-ear functioning did not explain cochlear and brainstem <b>asymmetries.</b> Current {{results are consistent with}} earlier studies showing right-ear dominance for TEOAE and ABR. Noise levels were higher in the right ear for OAEs and ABRs, causing ear <b>asymmetries</b> in SNR to differ from those in signal level. No left-ear dominance for DPOAE signal was observed. These results do not support a theory that ear <b>asymmetries</b> in cochlear processing mimic hemispheric brain specialization for auditory processing. I...|$|R

5|$|In many {{naturally}} occurring bilayers, the compositions {{of the inner}} and outer membrane leaflets are different. In human red blood cells, the inner (cytoplasmic) leaflet is composed mostly of phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol and its phosphorylated derivatives. By contrast, the outer (extracellular) leaflet is based on phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin and a variety of glycolipids, In some cases, this <b>asymmetry</b> is based on where the lipids are made in the cell and reflects their initial orientation. The biological functions of lipid <b>asymmetry</b> are imperfectly understood, although it is clear that it is used in several different situations. For example, when a cell undergoes apoptosis, the phosphatidylserine— normally localised to the cytoplasmic leaflet— is transferred to the outer surface: There, it is recognised by a macrophage that then actively scavenges the dying cell.|$|E

5|$|It {{has long}} been {{believed}} that a male black-throated blue warbler achieves reproductive maturation well into its first breeding season. A yearling participates in extra-pair mating and cuckoldry as much as or even more than older males. However, research by Graves has found opposing evidence in terms of testicular size and sperm production. Directional <b>asymmetry</b> is present in many passerine birds. The left testicle is often larger in size than the right one, and this holds true for both yearling and older male warblers. However, the testicle to body mass ratio nonetheless is much lower in yearlings than in older males. Moreover, older males have {{a greater degree of}} directional <b>asymmetry</b> than do yearlings. Because the size of testes in birds is correlated to the ejaculate quality, it is likely that females employ age-dependent choice in favor of older males who can be distinguished by their definitive age-specific plumage.|$|E
5|$|It {{is not yet}} {{understood}} why the universe has more matter than antimatter. It is generally assumed that {{when the universe was}} young and very hot it was in statistical equilibrium and contained equal numbers of baryons and antibaryons. However, observations suggest that the universe, including its most distant parts, is made almost entirely of matter. A process called baryogenesis was hypothesized to account for the <b>asymmetry.</b> For baryogenesis to occur, the Sakharov conditions must be satisfied. These require that baryon number is not conserved, that C-symmetry and CP-symmetry are violated and that the universe depart from thermodynamic equilibrium. All these conditions occur in the Standard Model, but the effects are not strong enough to explain the present baryon <b>asymmetry.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lipid <b>asymmetry</b> arises, {{at least}} in part, {{from the fact that}} most {{phospholipids}} are synthesised and initially inserted into the inner monolayer: those that constitute the outer monolayer are then transported from the inner monolayer by a class of enzymes called flippases. Other lipids, such as sphingomyelin, appear to be synthesised at the external leaflet. Flippases are members of a larger family of lipid transport molecules that also includes floppases, which transfer lipids in the opposite direction, and scramblases, which randomize lipid distribution across lipid bilayers (as in apoptotic cells). In any case, once lipid <b>asymmetry</b> is established, it does not normally dissipate quickly because spontaneous flip-flop of lipids between leaflets is extremely slow.|$|E
