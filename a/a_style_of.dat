The continued influence of 1980s synth-pop could be seen in various incarnations of 1990s dance music including trance. Hip hop artists such as Mobb Deep have sampled 1980s synth-pop songs. Popular artists such as Rihanna, UK stars Jay Sean and Taio Cruz, as well as British pop star Lily Allen on her second album, have also embraced the genre.|$|E

50|$|The polyamory {{community}} is {{better suited for}} couples who prefer <b>a</b> polyamorous <b>style</b> <b>of</b> open marriage. The swinging {{community is}} better suited for couples who prefer <b>a</b> swinging <b>style</b> <b>of</b> open marriage. However, some couples {{may not have a}} strong preference for either <b>style</b> <b>of</b> open marriage. These couples may feel equally at home in both the Polyamory community and the Swinging community. The partners within a couple may also differ in their preferences. One partner may prefer <b>a</b> polyamorous <b>style</b> <b>of</b> open marriage and participate in the Polyamory community, while the other partner may prefer <b>a</b> swinging <b>style</b> <b>of</b> open marriage and participate in the swinging community. Variations in couple preferences and individual preferences thus result in a certain amount of overlap between the polyamory and swinging communities.|$|R

5|$|As John Wilson {{and others}} have noted, it is {{difficult}} to define leisure. Its definitions are numerous and often mutually contradictory, for example as a discrete portion of one's time or as a quality of experience irrespective of time. Joffre Dumazedier distinguished four distinct definitions of leisure, which begin broadly and gradually narrow in scope. The first and broadest defines leisure as <b>a</b> <b>style</b> <b>of</b> behavior that may occur even at work, the second defines it as any non-work activity; the third further excludes family and household obligations; and, finally, the narrowest defines leisure as activities dedicated to self-fulfillment. Dumazedier's four definitions are not exhaustive. Incompatible definitions and measures are seen as a major factor accounting for occasionally contradictory research findings.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1590s, the full-length portrait came into vogue and artistic patrons among the nobles began to add galleries of such paintings to their homes as a form of cultural ostentation. Peake {{was one of those who}} met the demand. He was also among the earliest English painters to explore the full-length individual or group portrait with active figures placed in a natural landscape, <b>a</b> <b>style</b> <b>of</b> painting that became fashionable in England. As principal painter to Prince Henry, Peake seems to have been charged with showing his patron as a dashing young warrior.|$|E

5|$|Born to a music-loving family, Ravel {{attended}} France's premier music college, the Paris Conservatoire; he was {{not well}} regarded by its conservative establishment, whose biased treatment of him caused a scandal. After leaving the Conservatoire, Ravel found his own way as a composer, developing <b>a</b> <b>style</b> <b>of</b> great clarity, incorporating elements of baroque, neoclassicism and, in his later works, jazz. He liked to experiment with musical form, as in his best-known work, Boléro (1928), in which repetition {{takes the place of}} development. He made some orchestral arrangements of other composers' music, of which his 1922 version of Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition is the best known.|$|E
5|$|From {{the end of}} World War II to {{his death}} in April 1985, Enver Hoxha pursued <b>a</b> <b>style</b> <b>of</b> {{politics}} informed by hardline Stalinism as well as elements of Maoism. He broke with the Soviet Union after Nikita Khrushchev embarked on his reformist Khrushchev Thaw, withdrew Albania from the Warsaw Pact in 1968 in protest of the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, and broke with the People's Republic of China after U.S. President Richard Nixon's 1972 visit to China.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert {{acted as}} stage {{director}} {{for his own}} plays and operas. He sought realism in acting, just as he strove for realistic visual elements. He deprecated self-conscious interaction with the audience and insisted on <b>a</b> <b>style</b> <b>of</b> portrayal in which the characters were never aware of their own absurdity but were coherent internal wholes. Sullivan conducted the music rehearsals. As was to be his usual practice in his later operas, Sullivan left the overture for the last moment, sketching it out and entrusting it to the company's music director, in this case Alfred Cellier, to complete. Pinafore opened on 25 May 1878 at the Opera Comique.|$|E
50|$|The {{distinction}} between polyamory and swinging applies to open marriages. <b>A</b> polyamorous <b>style</b> <b>of</b> open marriage emphasizes {{the expansion of}} loving relationships by developing emotional attachments to extramarital partners. <b>A</b> swinging <b>style</b> <b>of</b> open marriage emphasizes physical gratification by engaging in recreational sex with extramarital partners.|$|R

The film also inaugurates the T.I.D.E. experiment for pan-European and multi-support releases.|$|E
5|$|In Shaanxi in {{the north}} of China, drum {{ensembles}} accompany yangge dance, and in the Tianjin area there are ritual percussion ensembles such as the Fagu hui Dharma-drumming associations, often consisting of dozens of musicians. In Korea, <b>a</b> <b>style</b> <b>of</b> folk music called Nongak (farmers' music) or pungmul has been performed for many hundred years, both by local players and by professional touring bands at concerts and festivals. It is loud music meant for outdoor performance, played on percussion instruments such as the drums called janggu and puk, and the gongs ching and kkwaenggwari. It originated in simple work rhythms to assist repetitive tasks carried out by field workers.|$|E
5|$|Neo soul is a {{genre of}} popular music. The term was coined by music {{industry}} entrepreneur Kedar Massenburg {{during the late}} 1990s to market and describe <b>a</b> <b>style</b> <b>of</b> music that emerged from soul and contemporary R. Heavily based in soul music, neo soul is distinguished by a less conventional sound than its contemporary R counterpart, with incorporated elements ranging from jazz, funk, and hip hop to pop, fusion, and African music. It has been noted by music writers for its traditional R influences, conscious-driven lyrics, and strong female presence.|$|E

5|$|Public {{sociology}} {{refers to}} an approach to the discipline which seeks to transcend the academy in order to engage with wider audiences. It is perhaps best understood as <b>a</b> <b>style</b> <b>of</b> sociology rather than a particular method, theory, or set of political values. This approach is primarily associated with Michael Burawoy who contrasted it with professional sociology, a form of academic sociology that is concerned primarily with addressing other professional sociologists. Public sociology {{is also part of}} the broader field of science communication or science journalism. In a distinct but similar vein, applied sociology, also known as clinical sociology, policy sociology or sociological practice, applies knowledge derived from sociological research to solve societal problems.|$|E
