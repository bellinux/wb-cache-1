5|$|Jovanović {{strove to}} make The Takovo Uprising as {{historically}} accurate as possible. He studied authentic costumes and armaments {{from the time}} of the uprising, visited Takovo and sketched the church and large tree under which Obrenović led the people to revolt. Jovanović also studied the facial features of locals and sketched them, and so some of their faces appear in the painting. Jovanović painted The Takovo Uprising in Paris over the course of several months in 1894. It was first exhibited the following year <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>brother</b> Milan's photography studio in Belgrade, not far from King Alexander's residence, the Old Palace. The exhibition coincided with the uprising's 80th anniversary.|$|E
5|$|Neilson was {{a member}} of Norwich City's youth teams at the age of 11, went on to Charlton Athletic and also won schoolboy honours for Wales. His senior career started <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>brother</b> Tony's club Hertford Town of the Isthmian League in 2005. He was top goalscorer for the {{reserves}} when he made his debut on 25 October in a Isthmian League Associate Members Trophy game against Clapton, before going on to play 15 games in his first season and scoring one goal. In his second season, he played 24 games upping his goal tally by another nine, before he earned a move in December 2006 to Ware – a second club where his brother also played. In one game in January 2008, Neilson came off the bench to score four goals for Ware against Tilbury in a 5–2 victory. The goals went towards Neilson's total of 23 from 40 games for Ware in the Isthmian League First Division North, helping Ware towards the end-of-season play-offs. However, he left Ware {{before the end of the}} season to join Cambridge City in March 2008 for the rest of the club's Conference South campaign.|$|E
25|$|He died {{suddenly}} <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>brother</b> Walter's house at 22 Merrick Square, Newington near Southwark, London. The {{cause of death}} was diabetes. As a member of the Leeds and Hollingbourne Volunteers, a rifle corps which was a forerunner of the Territorial Army, he was entitled to a military funeral. He is buried in Thurnham churchyard next to two of his daughters.|$|E

25|$|Compton's absent-mindedness was legendary. Colin Cowdrey {{writes that}} Compton turned {{up for the}} Old Trafford Test of 1955 against South Africa without his kitbag. Undaunted, he sauntered into the museum and, {{borrowing}} an antique bat off the display, went on to score 158 and 71. Nevertheless, England lost by three wickets. This absent-mindedness was particularly obvious in his tendency to run out his partners at the crease: Trevor Bailey declared that 'a call for a run from Compton {{should be treated as}} no more than a basis for negotiation.' Typically, <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>brother</b> Leslie's benefit match in 1955, he managed to run him out before he had faced a single ball.|$|E
25|$|Now {{estranged from}} his father, Chad learns {{that he is}} Stefano DiMera's son. Stefano welcomes Chad with open arms, but he {{initially}} rejects his new father. His sister Lexie Carver welcomes him with open arms and Chad even stands in as best man <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>brother</b> EJ DiMera's wedding with Nicole. Chad later strikes up a romance with Abigail Deveraux despite his new family's disapproval. Chad briefly moves into the mansion until he is shot in August 2011 and moves out for his own good. Chad then falls for Abigail's best friend Melanie Jonas after they share a kiss at the town's Halloween party. Meanwhile, Chad, Will and Sonny Kiriakis launch an internet website for sport fans at Salem University. However, {{they are forced to}} shut it down when criminals begin using it for illegal gambling. The criminals then kidnap Chad and Melanie and believing they are about to die, the two confess their feelings. Fortunately, they are rescued; however, Chad and Abigail break up. Abigail is initially upset about Chad and Melanie's romance, but she later gives them her blessing. Meanwhile, Chad and Gabi (Camila Banus) are forced to work together when they are both hired as models for Countess Wilhelmina. When Billie Reed (Lisa Rinna) mistakenly assumes they are dating, Gabi begins scheming to win Chad's affections. Melanie is uncomfortable with the attention Chad and Gabi are getting for their modeling campaign and their chemistry, but Chad assures her that he only has eyes for her. In the meantime, Gabi {{goes so far as to}} plant her earring in Chad's bed which interrupts Chad and Melanie's first attempt at making love. Gabi assures Melanie that her earring in Chad's bed was an accident and nothing more.|$|E
25|$|Its story {{focuses on}} the trials of a young cop named Charlie, played by Geoffrey Kennedy, who at the {{beginning}} receives a phone call summoning him for what is presumably his first job. As he leaves his desk, the camera zooms in on a photograph of him standing next to his older brother Brian, played by Brian Krause, {{who is also a}} cop. The film then begins playing the song “Spore” as Charlie joins his brother and a third cop as they enter a residence where they find a dead girl and arrest two thugs, one played by Todd La Torre, as they return to the scene with a bag full of money. The second thug lunges at Brian when he pilfers some of the cash but Charlie restrains him. Later, the chief of police, played by R.J. Adams, is seen looking through a window as the second thug is telling a detective to just ask Charlie about what Brian did during the bust. The chief summons Brian and Charlie to his office where he demands the former to come clean with them but Brian is defiant, forcing the chief to remind him that his brother saw the whole thing. Charlie denies this at first but when the chief threatens to take punitive action against him as well and picks up the phone, he tells them where his brother hid the money, forcing Brian to surrender his badge and gun. Enraged <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>brother</b> for rolling on him, Brian physically assaults Charlie later in the police station's parking garage and then makes a quick getaway in a pickup truck driven by La Torre. While recovering at the hospital, Charlie finds solace with a kind and beautiful nurse named Cathy, played by Cathy Baron, {{and the two of them}} later get married. However, the film then rolls into the song “Midnight Lullaby” as Cathy is seen screaming and crying in agony as she dies during childbirth, leaving Charlie to raise their child alone.|$|E

500|$|Hummer was a [...] back to {{the basket}} player who {{generally}} defended opposing high school centers. He had an underdeveloped face-up game yet he was undersized to play that style of game in power conferences. Power conference schools questioned how much potential he had in a league where his low post skills would likely be defended by larger, stronger and/or more athletic players who relegated him to perimeter play. When Princeton head coach Sydney Johnson recruited him, the only competition was mid-major schools and Hummer {{was not interested in}} any of them. During his campus visit with his father <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>brother</b> Alex's (Princeton Class of 2011) dorm room, he decided at midnight to go hang out at Dan Mavraides room across campus, signalling to his father that he was pretty comfortable with Princeton and likely to attend. Due to Hummer's relationship with former Princeton and current Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball head coach John Thompson III, he was able to train at the Georgetown University gym over the summers. He also played in the Kenner League (the only National Collegiate Athletic Association–sanctioned summer league in the Washington, D.C.) during the summer.|$|E

2500|$|Commonly called Sien Hoornik, Clasina Maria Hoornik (1850–1904) {{lived with}} van Gogh {{during much of}} his time in The Hague from 1881 to 1883. [...] Van Gogh used Sien, a {{pregnant}} prostitute, as a model for his work and later took Sien and her daughter into his home. [...] Van Gogh made drawings and paintings of Sien and her daughter, baby and mother over that period, which reflected the domestic life and hardships of the working poor. [...] Their relationship was not accepted by his family or supporters, although his brother Theo did not withdraw his support over it. It did contribute undoubtedly, however, to a split with Anton Mauve, a cousin-in-law and noted painter of the Hague School, who had introduced van Gogh to painting as well as supporting him financially, and whom van Gogh revered. <b>At</b> <b>his</b> <b>brother</b> Theo's urging, van Gogh left Sien in 1883 to paint in Drenthe, ending the only domestic relationship he would ever have.|$|E
2500|$|On January 23, 1976, {{following}} {{complications of}} a stroke, Robeson died in Philadelphia {{at the age}} of 77. He lay in state in Harlem and his funeral was held <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>brother</b> Ben's former parsonage, Mother Zion AME Zion Church, where Bishop J. Clinton Hoggard performed the eulogy. His twelve pall bearers included Harry Belafonte and Fritz Pollard. He was interred in the Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale, New York. According to biographer, Martin Duberman, contemporary post-mortem reflections on Robeson's life in [...] " [...] white [...] press..ignored the continuing inability of white America to tolerate a black maverick who refused to bend, [...].downplayed the racist component central to his persecution [...] ", as they [...] "paid him gingerly respect and tipped their hat to him as a 'great American,'" [...] while the black American press, [...] "which had never, overall, been as hostile to Robeson , opined that his life '..would always be a challenge to white and Black America.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the first}} {{physical}} descriptions of Kierkegaard comes from an attendee, Hans Brøchner, <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>brother</b> Peter's wedding party in 1836: [...] "I found [...] almost comical. He was then twenty-three years old; he had something quite irregular in his entire form and had a strange coiffure. His hair rose almost six inches above his forehead into a tousled crest that gave him a strange, bewildered look." [...] Another comes from Kierkegaard's niece, Henriette Lund (1829–1909). When Søren Kierkegaard {{was a little boy}} he [...] "was of slender and delicate appearance, and ran about in a little coat of red-cabbage color. He used to be called ‘fork’ by his father, because of his tendency, developed quite early, toward satirical remarks. Although a serious, almost austere tone pervaded the Kierkegaard’s house, I have the firm impression that there was a place for youthful vivacity too, even though of a more sedate and home-made kind than one is used to nowadays. The house was open for an 'old-fashioned hospitality'" [...] (1876).|$|E

2500|$|Barnard later wrote, [...] "For a {{dying man}} {{it is not}} a {{difficult}} decision because he knows he is at the end. If a lion chases you to the bank of a river filled with crocodiles, you will leap into the water, convinced {{you have a chance to}} swim to the other side." [...] The donor heart came from a young woman, Denise Darvall, who had been rendered brain dead in an accident on 2 December 1967, while crossing a street in Cape Town. On examination at Groote Schuur hospital, Darvall had two serious fractures in her skull, with no electrical activity in her brain detected, and no sign of pain when ice water was poured into her ear. [...] Coert Venter and Bertie Bosman requested permission from Darvall's father for Denise's heart to be used in the transplant attempt. The afternoon before his first transplant, Barnard dozed at his home while listening to music. [...] When he awoke, he decided to modify Shumway and Lower's technique. [...] Instead of cutting straight across the back of the atrial chambers of the donor heart, he would avoid damage to the septum and instead cut two small holes for the venae cavae and pulmonary veins. [...] Prior to the transplant, rather than wait for Darvall's heart to stop beating, <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>brother</b> Marius Barnard's urging, Christiaan had injected potassium into her heart to paralyse it and render her technically dead by the whole-body standard. Twenty years later, Marius Barnard recounted, [...] "Chris stood there for a few moments, watching, then stood back and said, 'It works.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{eleventh}} {{match of}} the event was the encounter between The Undertaker and Kane. After Kane made his entrance, he was seen looking toward the entrance ramp saying, [...] "You're not coming back tonight. You're not coming back, I buried you alive." [...] After this, {{the lights in the}} arena went out and Paul Bearer, Undertaker's former manager and Kane's (storyline) father, was heard screaming [...] "oh yes!". Blue light began to fill the arena as Bearer, carrying the Undertaker's former trademark urn, led a group of Druids, all chanting and carrying torches, onto the entrance ramp. As the Druids made a formation {{at the top of the}} ramp, Bearer walked to ringside, turned and said to Kane, [...] "my son...you're no son of mine." [...] He then turned back to face the entryway and raised the urn to summon The Undertaker. As Kane continued to watch in the ring, refusing to believe his brother was back, Undertaker entered the arena in his [...] "Deadman" [...] persona, wearing a long black trenchcoat and hat, and walked through the Druid formation. Bearer met him at ringside and directed him to the ring steps, where Undertaker raised his arms to bring the arena lights back up. Before the match officially got underway, a now visibly shaken and distressed Kane began shouting <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>brother</b> repeatedly, saying things like [...] "I killed you!", [...] "I buried you alive!", and [...] "you're not real!", while Undertaker simply stood staring stoically at Kane. Eventually, Kane decided to see if Undertaker was indeed standing in front of him by slowly inching forward with his hand outstretched. Undertaker responded by punching Kane, knocking him down, and the match got underway. The two continued brawling until Kane delivered a Chokeslam to Undertaker, which he sat up from shortly afterward while Kane was taunting Paul Bearer. The Undertaker then retaliated with a Chokeslam and Tombstone piledriver to win the match and remaining undefeated at WrestleMania with a 12–0 record.|$|E
