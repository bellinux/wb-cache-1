5|$|One of the Green's {{earliest}} uses was as <b>a</b> <b>pasture</b> for cattle {{belonging to}} {{the residents of the}} town. Dartmouth students resented this use, and in the early 19th century herded all the cattle into the basement of Dartmouth Hall as a protest. The fence constructed during the 1836 renovations was in part a response to this action, and was meant to keep animals out.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, {{there was}} only general {{aviation}} at Værnes, organized by two clubs, Værnes flyklubb and NTH flyklubb. From 1 August 1946 to 31 July 1947, there were 1,221 take-offs from Værnes, mostly during the summer. During parts of 1946 and 1947, the airport was used as <b>a</b> <b>pasture</b> for sheep. The first scheduled service was introduced with a Douglas DC-3 operated to Oslo by DNL {{during the winter of}} 19467–48. While there were initially many customers, the lack of sufficient deicing caused low regularity and fewer customers through the season. The route was not reopened the following year.|$|E
5|$|Leigh {{is derived}} from the Old English leah which meant a place at the wood or {{woodland}} clearing, a glade and subsequently <b>a</b> <b>pasture</b> or meadow, it was spelt Legh in 1276. Other recorded spellings include Leech, 1264; Leeche, 1268; Leghthe, 1305; Leght, 1417; Lech, 1451; Legh, 16th century. As its name denotes it was a district rich in meadow and pasture land, and the produce of its dairies, the Leigh cheese, was formerly noted for its excellence.|$|E

5|$|Smith {{reported}} in his autobiography, during one run from Omaha to Cheyenne, {{that he had}} had to ditch into <b>a</b> <b>pasture,</b> landing on a cow. He sent a laconic telegram to his division supervisor at headquarters in College Park, Maryland, reporting the mishap. Crashes were part of the job. Engines were unreliable, and pilots were using road maps. Unpredictable, bad weather was a constant risk. In {{the first five years of}} US Post Office air mail service the average forced landing was every 800 miles and a pilot was killed about every 80,000 miles. Thirty-five pilots died during the Postal Service's operation of air mail flights; most deaths were between 1920 and 1925.|$|E
5|$|Sheep {{are largely}} grazing herbivores, unlike {{browsing}} {{animals such as}} goats and deer that prefer taller foliage. With a much narrower face, sheep crop plants {{very close to the}} ground and can overgraze <b>a</b> <b>pasture</b> much faster than cattle. For this reason, many shepherds use managed intensive rotational grazing, where a flock is rotated through multiple pastures, giving plants time to recover. Paradoxically, sheep can both cause and solve the spread of invasive plant species. By disturbing the natural state of pasture, sheep and other livestock can pave the way for invasive plants. However, sheep also prefer to eat invasives such as cheatgrass, leafy spurge, kudzu and spotted knapweed over native species such as sagebrush, making grazing sheep effective for conservation grazing. Research conducted in Imperial County, California compared lamb grazing with herbicides for weed control in seedling alfalfa fields. Three trials demonstrated that grazing lambs were just as effective as herbicides in controlling winter weeds. Entomologists also compared grazing lambs to insecticides for insect control in winter alfalfa. In this trial, lambs provided insect control as effectively as insecticides.|$|E

Likewise while a feedlot cow may eat as much as she wants without moving, <b>a</b> <b>pastured</b> cow must both walk to a desirable part of the pasture, and then shear the grass with her teeth one mouthful at a time.|$|R

25|$|In 2007, DNA {{analysis}} {{confirmed that}} Grüner Veltliner {{was a natural}} crossing of Savagnin (Traminer) and obscure Austria grapevine {{from the village of}} Sankt Georgen am Leithagebirge located outside Eisenstadt in Burgenland region of eastern Austria. The vine was first found in 2000 in an overgrown part of <b>a</b> <b>pasture</b> in a location where there had not been any vineyard since the late 19th century, and is assumed to have been the last vine in this location for over a century. Local experts were not able to determine the variety of the vine. Only when it was threatened to be ripped out in 2005 additional samples were taken and later analyzed at Klosterneuburg. Genetic analysis in the following years by Ferdinand Regner was able to determine that St. Georgener-Rebe is a parent variety to Grüner Veltliner.|$|E
25|$|The patrol bases were hurriedly created. One of {{the young}} lieutenants who flew from Marfa Field {{in the summer of}} 1919 remembered the flying field as <b>a</b> <b>pasture</b> at the eastern edge of town. Its five hangars were made from canvas. A double row of ten or twelve tents served as officer and enlisted {{quarters}} and sheltered flight headquarters and supply. The lieutenant, Stacy C. Hinkle, recalled his tour of duty on the border as “a life of hardship, possible death, starvation pay, and a lonely life without social contacts, in hot, barren desert wastes, tortured by sun, wind, and sand.” The boredom was as bad as the physical hardship and discomfort, the sole recreation being drinking and gambling. Even so, Hinkle thought the airmen better off than the poor fellows at cavalry outposts up and down the border.|$|E

25|$|The town of Greenwich {{was first}} settled in 1640, but {{settlement}} was scattered among several villages. It {{was not until}} 1665 that Greenwich was formally incorporated as a town of Connecticut. In 1672, a group of settlers bought a tract of land known as Miossehasseky. The area occupied by Havemeyer Fields was used by these settlers as <b>a</b> <b>pasture</b> for horses and the entire village soon acquired the name Horseneck. In 1703, the town voted to have town meetings split between Sound Beach (the oldest settlement) and Horseneck, which was centrally located in the town. In 1760, a “Town House” for conducting town meetings was constructed at {{what is now the}} intersection of Putnam and Maple Avenue. The population of Horseneck boomed in the mid-19th century, transforming from a farming village to a wealth suburban community of New York City, mainly {{as a result of the}} establishment by the New Haven Railroad of a station at the lower part of Greenwich Avenue. This rapid growth prompted the incorporation of Horseneck as the Borough of Greenwich in 1854. The establishment of borough government ultimately allowed for the rapid construction of new public buildings after the Civil War on previously vacant farmland. Around the area of public buildings, intensive development of commercial as well as residential areas was also taking place.|$|E
