40|$|The {{present study}} shows that inhibition-of-return reduces {{competition}} for selection within the oculomotor system. We examined the e#ect of a distractor when it was presented at <b>an</b> inhibited <b>location</b> (IOR). The results show that due to IOR distractors cause less interference. This was evident in all three measures. First, there was less oculomotor capture when a distractor was presented at <b>an</b> inhibited <b>location.</b> Second, the saccade latency to the target was shorter when a distractor appeared at <b>an</b> inhibited <b>location</b> than when it appeared at <b>a</b> non-inhibited <b>location.</b> Third, there was less curvature towards the distractor when it was presented at inhibited <b>location</b> relative to <b>a</b> non-inhibited <b>location.</b> The observation that there is less interference for a distractor presented at <b>an</b> inhibited <b>location</b> suggests that IOR reduces the exogenous activation of the distractor within the saccade map...|$|R
