500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews from television critics. Jessica Morgan from Television Without Pity gave the episode a B– grade. John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it a 6 out of 10. He wrote, [...] "Overall, {{this is not}} nearly as bad an episode as many people are making it out to be, but it’s not exactly a sterling piece of work, either. It feels like they were shooting for a 'Momento Mori' , and wound up with a 'Zero Sum'. This episode is interesting in the information it provides, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>much</b> <b>else.</b> But in my opinion, it’s better than 'Lord of the Flies'." ...|$|E
500|$|Theron Martin of Anime News Network {{considered}} Gamma to be {{a typical}} [...] "bad-ass anti-hero," [...] good at creating mayhem <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>much</b> <b>else.</b> IGN's {{review of the}} series treated him similarly, saying his role of [...] "protagonist who wields {{a lot of power}} and hides a dark secret" [...] was done effectively but not remarkably, and was typical of shōnen action manga. Alexander Gorban of the Russian Animemaniacs Magazine believed Gamma's typical nature as a hero with an inner demon was offset by the character's [...] "devilish charm" [...] and portrayed willingness to fight to the last breath to not lose his humanity. He noted that aspects of this personality were reused for Bleach protagonist Ichigo Kurosaki, who would also bear some similarities in physical appearance to Gamma. Gorban felt, however, that these same strengths of character made Gamma dominate the cast, and that Zombiepowder. would have been improved if he had simply been its sole protagonist.|$|E
2500|$|As far as Led Zeppelin's studio {{recordings}} went, {{every single}} one of them has a certain ambiance, certain atmospherics that made them special. When it came to the live shows, we were always trying to move things forward and we certainly weren't happy leaving them as they were. The songs were always in a state of change. On [...] Song Remains the Same you can hear the urgency <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>much</b> <b>else.</b> The live shows were an extension of the albums.|$|E

"When Ingamells {{looked over}} the poetry scene from the {{standpoint}} of, say, 1937 – which he delivered his address On Environmental Values to the English Association in Adelaide – he saw very little poetry which satisfied the requirement of Australian inspiration, Australian content and imagery, and when Max Harris surveyed the same scene {{at the start of}} the new decade, he saw the burgeoning Jindyworobaks <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>much</b> <b>else</b> – nothing that seemed to have much connection with or awareness of the cultural world beyond the antipodes.

2500|$|The show also {{received}} some negative criticism. Tim Walker {{wrote in the}} Sunday Telegraph: [...] "It is a great big empty vessel of a show that {{makes a lot of}} noise <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>much</b> <b>else,</b> and would have been better entitled 'Irredeemably Bland'. I was aware that for the whole of the two hours and 25 minutes that it ran, I was sitting among a group of people with vacant smiles on faces that otherwise seemed entirely numbed. That was how I looked, too. It is the expression that registers when what one is seeing doesn't entirely sync with {{what is going on in}} one's brain." [...] Quentin Letts wrote for Daily Mail, [...] "It is pink not just in the colour of many of the clothes and stage effects. It is pink to the core of its little, tiny soul ... The plot is pap, the musical unmemorable, the dancing often hefty except for one routine with skipping ropes." ...|$|E

The dog had been mischievous, I conclude, about the decks; and so he had been lashed to a timber head, the which saved his life, since, happily for him he found himself on the weather-side when the hull righted a little, after her spars gave way. Well, sir there was the dog, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>much</b> <b>else,</b> as we could see, though we spent half a day in rummaging round, in order to pick up any small matter that might be useful; but then, as the {{entrance}} to the hold and cabin was full of water, why, we made no great affair of the salvage, after all." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Jones' ranch!--I knew Jones in {{the early}} days. And I've heard of him lately. Thirty years ago he rode a prairie {{schooner}} down into this canyon. He had his wife, a fine, strong girl, {{and he had a}} gun, an axe, some chuck, a few horses and cattle, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>much</b> <b>else.</b> He built him that cabin there and began the real old pioneering of the early days. He raised cattle. He freighted to the settlements twice a year. In twenty-five years he had three strapping boys and a girl just as strapping. And he had a fortune in cattle. Then he sold his stock and left this ranch. He wanted to give his faithful wife and his children some of the comforts and luxuries and advantages of civilization. The war came. His sons did not wait for the draft. They entered the army. I heard a story about Abe Jones, the old man's first boy. Abe was a quiet sort of chap. When he got to the army training camp a sergeant asked Abe if he could shoot. Abe said: 'Nope, not much.' So they gave him a rifle and told him to shoot at the near target. Abe looked at it sort of funny like and he picked out the farthest target at one thousand yards. And he hit the bull's eye ten times straight running. 'Hey!' gasped the sergeant, 'you long, lanky galoot! You said you couldn't shoot.' Abe sort of laughed. 'Reckon I was thinkin' about what Dad called shootin'.'... Well, Abe and his brothers got to France to the front. Abe was a sharpshooter. He was killed at Argonne. Both his brothers were wounded. They're over there yet.... I met a man not long ago who'd seen Jones recently. And the old pioneer said he and his wife would like to be back home. And home to them means right here--Jones' Ranch!" ...|$|E
6000|$|By {{the middle}} of April, for I made no haste in my work, but rather {{made the most of}} it, my house was framed and ready for the raising. I had already bought the shanty of James Collins, an Irishman who worked on the Fitchburg Railroad, for boards. James Collins' shanty was {{considered}} an uncommonly fine one. When I called to see it he was not at home. I walked about the outside, at first unobserved from within, the window was so deep and high. It was of small dimensions, with a peaked cottage roof, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>much</b> <b>else</b> to be seen, the dirt being raised five feet all around {{as if it were a}} compost heap. The roof was the soundest part, though a good deal warped and made brittle by the sun. Doorsill there was none, but a perennial passage for the hens under the door board. Mrs. C. came to the door and asked me to view it from the inside. The hens were driven in by my approach. It was dark, and had a dirt floor for the most part, dank, clammy, and aguish, only here a board and there a board which would not bear removal. She lighted a lamp to show me the inside of the roof and the walls, and also that the board floor extended under the bed, warning me not to step into the cellar, a sort of dust hole two feet deep. In her own words, they were [...] "good boards overhead, good boards all around, and a good window"--of two whole squares originally, only the cat had passed out that way lately. There was a stove, a bed, and a place to sit, an infant in the house where it was born, a silk parasol, gilt-framed looking-glass, and a patent new coffee-mill nailed to an oak sapling, all told. The bargain was soon concluded, for James had in the meanwhile returned. I to pay four dollars and twenty-five cents tonight, he to vacate at five tomorrow morning, selling to nobody else meanwhile: I to take possession at six. It were well, he said, to be there early, and anticipate certain indistinct but wholly unjust claims on the score of ground rent and fuel. This he assured me was the only encumbrance. At six I passed him and his family on the road. One large bundle held their all--bed, coffee-mill, looking-glass, hens--all but the cat; she took to the woods and became a wild cat, and, as I learned afterward, trod in a trap set for woodchucks, and so became a dead cat at last.|$|E

The art and animation is the real charm here, with shooting action — as simplistic as it is — that's pretty satisfying." ...|$|R

5000|$|He says women use a points {{system which}} few men are aware of. Each {{individual}} {{act of love}} gets one point, regardless of magnitude. Men, on the other hand, assign small acts, small expenditures, fewer points. Larger blocks of points (20, 30, 40 points, etc.) go to what they consider bigger expenditures. To a woman, the emotional stroke delivered by sincere attention is inseparable from the act. The different perception of expenditure can lead to conflict when the man thinks his work has earned him, say, 20 points and deserves corresponding recognition, while the woman has assigned him only 1 point and recognizes him accordingly. The man tends to think he can do one Big Thing for her (scoring 50 points) <b>and</b> <b>not</b> do <b>much</b> <b>else,</b> assuming he has [...] "banked" [...] points and can afford to [...] "coast." [...] The woman should be satisfied with his performance and {{give him credit for}} it. Instead, the woman would rather have many little things done for her on a regular basis, because women like to think their men are thinking of them and care for them more constantly.
