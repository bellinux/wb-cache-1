25|$|The {{peculiar}} {{policy of}} the government in employing so weak and vacillating a person as General Miles to look after the uneasy Indians, has resulted in a terrible loss of blood to our soldiers, and a battle which, at best, is <b>a</b> <b>disgrace</b> <b>to</b> the war department. There has been plenty of time for prompt and decisive measures, the employment of which would have prevented this disaster.|$|E

25|$|Schutz made further {{tests at}} Dartford of {{a ton of}} ore on 29 December 1578, and a half ton of ore on 20 January 1579. The latter test yielded a value of only £10 per ton, causing {{suspicion}} to fall on Schutz, Denham, Frobisher and Michael Lok, a major promoter of the Frobisher voyages. The Commissioners appointed to supervise the voyages then ordered Schutz to perform a further test in their presence at Tower Hill, which he did on 22 March 1579. This time he obtained results of £15 a ton, which appeared to satisfy the Commissioners. Seeing his reputation being thus brought into discredit Schutz offered, in partnership with Robert Denham, to buy the entire 1300 tons of ore at Dartford at 20 marks a ton, and to refine it at their own cost; their offer was delivered by Lok to Lord Burghley and Sir Francis Walsingham on 18 April 1579, along with a separate offer from Lok himself for 150 tons of the ore. The Privy Council was at first inclined to accept the offer; however Frobisher insinuated that Lok and Schutz were fraudulently trying to get valuable ore worth £40 a ton into their own hands, and Sir Thomas Gresham and the other Commissioners, influenced by Frobisher, then termed it <b>a</b> <b>disgrace</b> <b>to</b> the Queen to sell it.|$|E
500|$|Many {{references}} in Arbuthnot's diary, however, are less respectful than those she accorded to the Duchess of Kent. Wellington and Arbuthnot often travelled together, and {{a visit to}} Blenheim Palace they shared in 1824 provoked a scathing entry in her journal concerning Wellington's fellow duke the 5th Duke of Marlborough, of whom she wrote: [...] "The family of the great General is, however, gone sadly to decay, and are but <b>a</b> <b>disgrace</b> <b>to</b> the illustrious name of Churchill, which they have chosen this moment to resume. The present Duke is overloaded with debt, is very little better than a common swindler".|$|E
500|$|Following {{the start}} of litigation, an {{investigation}} by the Lay Observer and the Law Society itself (which became known as the Ely Report) highlighted [...] "an appalling catalogue of errors, insensitivity and poor judgment" [...] in the handling of the Davies Affair by the Law Society internal disciplinary organisation. The report found [...] "administrative failures, wrong decisions, mistakes, errors of judgement, failures in communication and insensitivity... the whole affair was <b>a</b> <b>disgrace</b> <b>to</b> the Society". The Society paid compensation to Parsons for their mishandling of the situation and said that they would compensate victims of similar cases where they had failed to investigate complaints with reasonable care.|$|E

500|$|For Frank's protection, he {{was taken}} to the Milledgeville State Penitentiary {{in the middle of the}} night before the {{commutation}} was announced. The penitentiary was [...] "strongly garrisoned and newly bristling with arms" [...] and separated from Marietta by [...] of mostly unpaved road. However, on July 17, The New York Times reported that fellow inmate William Creen tried to kill Frank by slashing his throat with a [...] butcher knife, severing his jugular vein. The attacker told the authorities he [...] "wanted to keep the other inmates safe from mob violence, Frank's presence was <b>a</b> <b>disgrace</b> <b>to</b> the prison, and he was sure he would be pardoned if he killed Frank." ...|$|E
500|$|By this time, Booth {{was arguing}} so vehemently with his older, pro-Union brother Edwin about Lincoln {{and the war}} that Edwin finally {{told him that he}} was no longer welcome at his New York home. Booth also railed against Lincoln in conversations with his sister Asia, saying, [...] "That man's appearance, his pedigree, his coarse low jokes and anecdotes, his vulgar similes, and his policy are <b>a</b> <b>disgrace</b> <b>to</b> the seat he holds. He is made the tool of the North, to crush out slavery." [...] As the Confederacy's defeat became more certain in 1865, Booth decried the end of slavery and Lincoln's {{election}} to a second term, [...] "making himself a king", the actor fumed, in [...] "wild tirades", his sister recalled.|$|E
500|$|Erskine then {{argued that}} if Sandwich was not {{responsible}} for the actions of the hospital's officers, he should respond by denying responsibility for them and restoring Baillie to his office; if he did not, he would be [...] "a shameless oppressor, <b>a</b> <b>disgrace</b> <b>to</b> his rank, and a traitor to his trust". Were the situation in the hospital allowed to continue, the Royal Navy would be [...] "crippled by abuses", with seamen no longer willing to risk their lives for a fleet that would fail to reward them with good treatment in retirement. Baillie, who had merely tried to prevent this from happening, deserved [...] "a palace, instead of a prison"; Erskine then left Baillie {{in the hands of the}} judges, and the case was dismissed with costs.|$|E

500|$|Al-Badr and his {{personal}} servants managed to escape through a door in the garden wall {{in the back of}} the palace. Because of the curfew declared, they had to avoid the main streets. They decided to escape individually and meet in the village of Gabi al Kaflir, where they were reunited after a forty-five-minute walk. Sallal had to defeat a fellow revolutionary, Al-Baidani, an intellectual holding a doctorate degree, who did not share in Nasser's vision. On September 28, the radio announced al-Badr's death. Sallal gathered tribesmen in San'a and proclaimed: [...] "The corrupt monarchy which ruled for a thousand years was <b>a</b> <b>disgrace</b> <b>to</b> the Arab nation and to all humanity. Anyone who tries to restore it is an enemy of God and man!" [...] By then, he had learned that al-Badr was still alive and had made his way to Saudi Arabia.|$|E
500|$|In 2003, the Egyptian Museum in Berlin {{allowed the}} Hungarian artist duo Little Warsaw, Andras Galik and Balint Havas, {{to place the}} bust atop a nearly nude female bronze for a video {{installation}} to be shown at the Venice Biennale modern art festival. The project called the Body of Nefertiti was, according to the artists, an attempt {{to pay homage to}} the bust. According to Wildung, it showed [...] "the continued relevance of the ancient world to today's art." [...] However, Egyptian cultural officials took offense and proclaimed it to be <b>a</b> <b>disgrace</b> <b>to</b> [...] "one of the great symbols of their country's history". As a consequence, they also banned Wildung and his wife from further exploration in Egypt. The Egyptian Minister for Culture, Farouk Hosny, declared that Nefertiti was [...] "not in safe hands", and although Egypt had not renewed their claims for restitution [...] "due to the good relations with Germany," [...] this [...] "recent behaviour" [...] was unacceptable.|$|E
500|$|Amidst all of {{this family}} turmoil, Imlay still found time to ponder larger social issues. The utopian socialist Robert Owen came to visit Godwin {{in the summer of}} 1816 and he and Imlay {{discussed}} the plight of the working poor in Britain. She agreed with many of Owen's proposals, but not all of them. She decided, in the end, that his utopian scheme was too [...] "romantic", because it depended heavily on the goodwill of the rich to sacrifice their wealth. That same summer, George Blood—the brother of Fanny Imlay's namesake—came to meet {{her for the first time}} and told her stories of her mother. After this meeting she wrote to Mary Godwin and Shelley: [...] "I have determined never to live to be <b>a</b> <b>disgrace</b> <b>to</b> such a mother... I have found that if I will endeavour to overcome my faults I shall find being's [...] to love and esteem me" [...]|$|E

500|$|After {{less than}} five years as a judge, Denning was {{appointed}} a Lord Justice of Appeal on 14 October 1948. He was sworn in as a Privy Counsellor on 25 October 1948. As a Lord Justice of Appeal he continued to make reforming judgments in a variety of areas, particularly in family law and the rights of deserted wives. In 1952 the Court of Appeal heard Bendall v McWhirter [...] 2 QB 466 and ruled that a deserted wife occupying the marital home had a personal licence to stay there. The decision provoked disapproval among the judiciary and from the public; a correspondent wrote: Dear Sir: You are <b>a</b> <b>disgrace</b> <b>to</b> all mankind to let these women break up homes and expect us chaps to keep them while they rob us of what we have worked for and put us out on the street. I only hope you have the same trouble as us. So do us all a favour and take a Rolls and run off Beachy Head and don't come back.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} a view of a Carey's {{personal}} family album. As the pages open, the camera zooms to one particular photograph, of her young mother facing a wall, with her back turned. As the picture comes into full view, it turns into actual footage. Her mother turns around in anguish, as her own mother begins shouting at her and calling her <b>a</b> <b>disgrace</b> <b>to</b> the family. This {{is due to the fact}} that she is pregnant with the child of a black man, with whom she wants to move out with. As she goes to leave the home, her mother grabs her arm and rips off a [...] "charmbracelet" [...] from her wrist. As she picks it up off the floor, she tells her mother she hates her and leaves in a taxi. From the clothing and scenery, it is notable that the scenes depicted are happening in the late 1960s, prior to Carey's birth. As the song starts playing, the video focuses on Carey, walking down the street in New York City. As she continues singing and walking down the street, the camera aims to the sky, which is darkened with cloud while light starts to peer through.|$|E
500|$|In 2008, Rajinikanth {{took part}} in a hunger strike {{organised}} by the Nadigar Sangam against Karnataka's stance on the Hogenakkal Falls water dispute. In his speech, which was well received in Tamil Nadu, he warned leaders not to inflame the water project issue for political gains and requested that the issue should be resolved soon. He reprimanded politicians in Karnataka and urged them [...] "to speak the truth" [...] to the public. [...] "They cannot be fooled and will not remain silent if you continue to act in such manner" [...] he stated. The speech led to Vatal Nagaraj, leader of the Kannada nationalist group Kannada Chaluvali Vatal Paksha, demanding an apology from Rajinikanth and threatening that he and his films would be boycotted from the state of Karnataka. The threats were echoed by other pro-Kannada organisations, such as the Karnataka Rakshana Vedike. He later thanked the Kannada film industry for allowing the release of Kuselan and lifting the ban the industry had briefly imposed on it. This led to strong reactions from Nadigar Sangam members R. Sarathkumar, Sathyaraj and Radha Ravi, who called the apology <b>a</b> <b>disgrace</b> <b>to</b> Tamils and opined that his speech never provoked the sentiments of the Kannada people.|$|E

500|$|In Southey's tale, three {{anthropomorphic}} bears [...] "a Little, Small, Wee Bear, a Middle-sized Bear, and a Great, Huge Bear" [...] {{live together}} {{in a house in}} the woods. Southey describes them as very good-natured, trusting, harmless, tidy, and hospitable. Each of these [...] "bachelor" [...] bears has his own porridge bowl, chair, and bed. One day they make porridge for breakfast, but it's too hot to eat, so take a walk in the woods while their porridge cools. An old woman approaches the bears' house. As she has been sent out by her family, she is <b>a</b> <b>disgrace</b> <b>to</b> them. She is [...] impudent, bad, foul-mouthed, ugly, dirty, and a vagrant deserving of a stint in the House of Correction. She looks through a window, peeps through the keyhole, and lifts the latch. Assured that no one is home, she walks in. The old woman eats the Wee Bear's porridge, then settles into his chair and breaks it. Prowling about, she finds the bears' beds and falls asleep in Wee Bear's bed. The dark end of the tale is reached when the bears return. Wee Bear finds his empty bowl, his broken chair, and the old woman in his bed and cries, [...] "Somebody has been lying in my bed, and here she is!" [...] The old woman starts, runs away, breaks her neck and goes to the hospital.|$|E
500|$|The {{ancestors}} of the Lusitano were originally used for classical dressage, driving and bullfighting on horseback. Today, Lusitanos are seen in internationdisciplines, including high-level combined driving competition. In 1995, a four-in-hand team driven by Belgian Felix Brasseur won the FEI Driving World Cup, and took the World Championships in 1996. In 2002, there was a Lusitano on the World Equestrian Games bronze-winning dressage team that went on to collect a silver medal at the 2004 Summer Olympics. In 2006, the entire Portuguese dressage team rode Lusitanos at the World Equestrian Games, as did one Spanish dressage competitor. The Belgian Brasseur took {{the gold medal in}} four-in-hand driving at the same competition with a team composed solely of Lusitanos. They are still used for mounted bullfighting today, in a form where the bull is not killed and it is considered <b>a</b> <b>disgrace</b> <b>to</b> the rider if the horse is injured. Horses bred for this sport must be agile and calm, remaining in the control of the rider even when confronted by a bull. [...] Between 1980 and 1987, Lusitanos were used for breeding Colorado Ranger horses, although these crosses are no longer allowed by the breed registry. An Alter Real stallion, taken to Brazil prior to Napoleon's invasion, was a foundation stallion of the Mangalarga Marchador breed.|$|E
500|$|By early 1887, 13 African Americans {{were playing}} in the [...] "white" [...] minor leagues, {{including}} four in the Ohio State League. [...] Weldy began the season with the Akron Acorns of the Ohio State League. [...] However, he appeared in only four games for the Acorns. During the 1887 season, racial segregation began to become the official policy in certain minor leagues. [...] Weldy was outraged by a report that the Tri-State League (successor to the Ohio State League) had abandoned racial integration. [...] In March 1888, {{he wrote a letter}} to the league's president protesting the decision. [...] In his 1970 history of racial segregation in baseball, Robert Peterson described Weldy's letter as [...] "perhaps the most passionate cry for justice ever voiced by a Negro athlete." [...] In the letter, Walker wrote:The law is <b>a</b> <b>disgrace</b> <b>to</b> the present age, and reflects very much upon the intelligence of your last meeting, and casts derision at the laws of Ohio– the voice of the people– that say all men are equal. I would suggest that your honorable body, in case that black law is not repealed, pass one making it criminal for a colored man or woman to be found on a ball ground... There should be some broader cause– such as lack of ability, behavior and intelligence– for barring a player, rather than his color. [...] It is for these reasons and because I think ability and intelligence should be recognized first and last– at all times and by everyone– I ask the question again, 'Why was the law permitting colored men to sign repealed, etc.?' ...|$|E
