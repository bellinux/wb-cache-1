During this decade, they dominated the top four spots, which came with UEFA Champions League qualification, taking all top-four places in 5 out of 6 seasons from 2003–04 to 2008–09 inclusive. Arsenal went as far as winning the league without losing a single game in 2003–04, the only time it has ever happened in the Premier League. In May 2008 Kevin Keegan stated that [...] "Big Four" [...] dominance threatened the division, [...] "This league is in danger of becoming one of the most boring but great leagues in the world."

Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy said Rhys's arrival would cause a stir in Erinsborough and may not go down well with some of the local residents.

[...] Barber told a writer for Inside Soap that Rhys is good at separating his work life from his home life, and can easily switch from one to the other. Barber quipped that Rhys knows how to have a good time, while the official Neighbours website said he considers himself [...] "a bit of a ladies' man".

Fletcher explained that it can be [...] "somewhat galling" [...] for Karl to be faced with Rhys, who is an enthusiastic young doctor. The actor added [...] "So expect some fun confrontation but also cleverly the writers have explored what Rhys and Karl might have in common." ...|$|E
