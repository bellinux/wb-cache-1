5|$|Franklin died on April 12, 1945 after {{suffering}} a cerebral hemorrhage at the Little White House in Warm Springs, Georgia. Eleanor later learned that FDR's mistress Lucy Mercer Rutherfurd had been {{with him when he}} died, a discovery made more bitter by learning that her daughter Anna had also been aware of the ongoing relationship between the President and Rutherfurd. It was Anna who told her that Franklin had been with Lucy when he died; in addition, she told her that Franklin had continued the relationship for decades, and people surrounding him had hidden the information from Eleanor. After the funeral, Eleanor temporarily returned to Val-Kill. Franklin left instructions for Eleanor in the event of his death; he proposed turning over Hyde Park to the federal government as a museum, and she spent the following months cataloging the estate and arranging for the transfer. After FDR's death, Eleanor moved into an apartment at 29 Washington Square West in Greenwich Village. In 1950, she rented suites at The Park Sheraton Hotel (202 West 56th Street). She lived here until 1953 when she moved to 211 East 62nd Street. When that lease expired in 1958, she returned to The Park Sheraton <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>waited</b> for the house she purchased with Edna and David Gurewitsch at 55 East 74th Street to be renovated. The Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum opened on April 12, 1946, setting a precedent for future presidential libraries.|$|E

25|$|The autumn passed, and winter, too, and as {{the first}} green began to show in the hickory and oak along the Housatonic, Lillinonah bedecked herself with the wild flowers of the forest <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>waited</b> in happy {{anticipation}} for her lover's return. But summer came and went, the reds and yellows of autumn showed bright on the trees, and still the young Englishman had not {{come back to the}} land of the Pootatucks. Lillinonah no longer sang a joyous song. There were no more flowers in her hair. Wan and listless, she wandered through the woods, her eyes red-rimmed from weeping, searching and hoping against hope that she had not been forgotten.|$|E
25|$|Among Andrea Dorias {{passengers}} were Hollywood actress Ruth Roman and her three-year-old son, Richard. In the 1950 film Three Secrets, Roman had portrayed a distraught mother waiting to learn {{whether or not}} her child had survived a plane crash. She and her son were separated from each other during the collision and evacuation. Rescued, Roman had to wait to learn her child's fate {{which resulted in a}} media frenzy for photos <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>waited</b> at the pier in New York City for her child's safe arrival aboard one of the rescue ships. Actress Betsy Drake, wife of movie star Cary Grant, also escaped from the sinking liner, as did Philadelphia mayor Richardson Dilworth and songwriter Mike Stoller (of the team Leiber and Stoller).|$|E
500|$|The gallows {{consisted}} of {{nothing more than}} a large elm tree. [...] Here the prisoners would step up a ladder with one end of a rope about their neck and the other end secured to the tree, and the ladder would then be pulled away. [...] William Robinson {{was the first of the}} three to mount the ladder, and when he was positioned he made a statement to the crowd, then died when the ladder was removed. [...] Marmaduke Stephenson was the next to hang, and then it was Dyer's turn, after she witnessed the execution of her two friends. [...] Dyer's arms and legs were bound and her face was covered with a handkerchief provided by Reverend John Wilson who had been one of her pastors in the Boston church many years earlier. [...] She stood calmly on the ladder, prepared for her death, but <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>waited,</b> an order of a reprieve was announced. [...] A petition from her son, William, had given the authorities an excuse to avoid her execution. [...] It had been a pre-arranged scheme, in an attempt to unnerve and dissuade Dyer from her mission. [...] This was made clear from the wording of the reprieve, though Dyer's only expectation was to die as a martyr.|$|E

500|$|From {{there she}} was taken west by Peter Fraser (a page of Lord Lovat) and his men through Perthshire. At Balquhidder, {{according}} to MacGregor tradition, she was entertained in the great hall, provided with a meal of venison, and slept on a heather bed covered with deerskins. [...] The existence of St Fillan's Pool on the River Fillan near Tyndrum would have provided useful cover for her captors: it was regularly used as a cure for insanity, which would have helped to explain her presence to the curious. The details of the onward route from there are not clear but it is likely she was taken through Glen Coe to Loch Ness and then through Glen Garry to Loch Hourn on the west coast. After a short delay she was then put on board ship to the Monach Isles. The difficulty of her position must have quickly become evident. She was {{in the company of}} men whose loyalty was to clan chieftains rather than the law, and few of them spoke any English at all. [...] Their native Gaelic would have been incomprehensible to her, although as her years of captivity wore on she slowly learned something of the language. She complained that young members of the local aristocracy visited her <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>waited</b> by the shores of Loch Hourn, but that [...] "they came with design to see me, but not to relieve me".|$|E
