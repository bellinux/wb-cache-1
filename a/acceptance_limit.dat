40|$|The {{probabilistic}} design approach currently receiving {{attention for}} structural failure modes has been adapted for obtaining measured bearing wear limits in the Space Shuttle Main Engine high-pressure oxidizer turbopump. With {{the development of}} the shaft microtravel measurements to determine bearing health, an <b>acceptance</b> <b>limit</b> was neeed that protects against all known faiure modes yet is not overly conservative. This acceptance criteria limit has been successfully determined using probabilistic descriptions of preflight hardware geometry, empirical bearing wear data, mission requirements, and measurement tool precision as an input for a Monte Carlo simulation. The result of the simulation is a frequency distribution of failures as a function of preflight acceptance limits. When the distribution is converted into a reliability curve, a conscious risk management decision is made concerning the <b>acceptance</b> <b>limit...</b>|$|E

The processes for product development and manufacturing {{have been developed}} to meet the tighter specifications and quality requirements. The development of test methods and measurement devices have not been as fast, and as a con-sequence, the relative impact of measurement errors has increased. Traditionally, the measurement inaccuracies have been compensated by tightening the <b>acceptance</b> <b>limits.</b> This study concentrates on analysing, through simulation, how compa-nies should minimise the failure costs by adjusting <b>acceptance</b> <b>limits.</b> The study shows, in contrast to the conventional thinking, that widening the <b>acceptance</b> <b>limits</b> makes business sense in some cases...|$|R

From the specificity study, {{it was observed that}} there was no response in case of blank (without sample or standard) measurement, and the spike sample (with 0. 1 %water standard) showed positive response.

40|$|Background & Aims of the Study: One way to {{increasing}} shelf life of meat is {{the production of}} sausages along with additives. One of these additives contains nitrite that in an <b>acceptance</b> <b>limit</b> is not a threat for human health but if it's amount is higher than standard, it will react in the body with secondary amine {{and the result is}} the formation of carcinogenic nitrosamines. Also, the consumption of healthy and safe food is concerned for every consumer. That's why we decided to examine Nitrite, Carbohydrates, Fat, Protein, Humidity, microbial contamination and exterior features of the sausages which were produced in Qazvin province. 						Materials and Methods: The study population consisted of sausages produced in Qazvin province from 2011 to 2014. A total of 74 samples of products that have been produced in the factories of meat products of Qazvin, distribution system and retail level were collected. Additive composition, microbial contamination and exterior features were examined according to standard methods of Iranian national standards No 2303. 						Results: The overall result showed that all products comply with their nitrite <b>acceptance</b> <b>limit.</b> Of course, the amount of humidity (13. 84 %) and carbohydrates (39. 62 %) were infringement but the two combinations no adverse effects on human health and microorganism counts determined in overall processing were not at harmful levels for human health and microbial contamination of all meat products of our study were acceptable.

40|$|In {{industry}} and in laboratories, {{it is crucial}} to continuously control the validity of the analytical methods used to follow the products' quality characteristics. Validity must be assessed at two levels. The 'pre-study' validation aims at demonstrating be re use that the method will be able to achieve its objectives. The 'in-study' validation is intended to verify, by inserting quality control (QC) samples in routine runs, that the method remains valid over time. At these two levels, the analytical method will be claimed valid if it is possible to prove that a sufficient proportion of analytical results is expected to lie within given <b>acceptance</b> <b>limits</b> [-lambda, lambda] around the nominal value. This paper presents and compares four approaches to checking the validity of a measurement method at the pre-study level. They can be classified into two categories. In the first, a lower confidence bound for the estimated probability pi of a result lying within the <b>acceptance</b> <b>limits</b> is computed and compared with a given acceptance level. Maximum likelihood and delta methods are used to estimate the quality level pi and the corresponding estimator variance. Two approaches are then proposed to derive the confidence bound: the asymptotic maximum likelihood approach and a method proposed by Mee (Commun. Stat. Theory Methods 1988; 17 (5) : 1465 - 1479). The second category of approaches checks whether a tolerance interval for hypothetical future measurements ties within the predefined <b>acceptance</b> <b>limits</b> [-lambda, lambda]. beta-expectation and beta-gamma-content tolerance intervals are investigated and compared in this context. These four approaches are illustrated on a bioanalytical HPLC-UV analytical process and compared through simulations. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
