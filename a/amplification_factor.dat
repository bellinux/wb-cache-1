Shear wave velocity measurement and standard penetration test are generally expensive and are not feasible to be carried out at large number of sites for the purpose of microzonation. Ambient Vibrations measurement (also called Microtremor) has become a popular method for determining the dynamic properties of soil strata and is being extensively used for microzonation. Microtremor observations are easy to perform, inexpensive and can be applied to places with low seismicity as well, hence, microtremor measurements can be used conveniently for microzonation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Telecommunication towers {{are among}} the few steel {{structures}} that {{little attention has been}} paid to their seismic behavior in existing design codes. Due to lack of design provisions, the designers apply the existing building design codes to telecommunication towers. However, the seismic behavior and response of telecommunication towers is very different from that of building structures. For example, the base shear values obtained for telecommunication towers using the building codes is much higher than what it actually is. In this research, for obtaining the seismic <b>amplification</b> <b>factors,</b> ten of the existing self-supporting four-legged telecommunication towers in Iran with heights ranging from 18 to 67 meters are selected. Then, strong motion earthquakes are applied to these towers in both vertical and horizontal directions. By performing linear dynamic analysis, the base shear and vertical response of the towers are calculated. Dividing the obtained base shear or the vertical response by the product of the tower mass and maximum horizontal and/or vertical acceleration components will result in seismic <b>amplification</b> <b>factors</b> of both horizontal and vertical earthquake components. At the end, by drawing the <b>amplification</b> <b>factors</b> versus the fundamental flexural mode and the first axial mode of the towers, relations for estimating the base shear and the vertical response of the telecommunication towers are obtained.

40|$|AbstractInformation on pedestrian-level wind (PLW) {{speed for}} wind comfort {{assessment}} {{can be obtained}} by wind-tunnel measurements or Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. Wind-tunnel measurements for PLW are routinely performed with low-cost techniques such as hot-wire or hot-film anemometers, Irwin probes or sand erosion, while Laser-Doppler Anemometry (LDA) and Particle-Image Velocimetry (PIV) are less often used because they are more expensive. CFD simulations are routinely performed by the relatively low-cost steady Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) approach. Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) is less often used because of its larger complexity and cost. This paper reviews wind-tunnel and CFD techniques to determine PLW speeds expressed generally in terms of <b>amplification</b> <b>factors</b> defined as the ratio of local mean wind speed to mean wind speed at the same position without buildings present. Some comparative studies systematically indicate that the low-cost wind-tunnel techniques and steady RANS simulations can provide accurate results (∼ 10 %) at high <b>amplification</b> <b>factors</b> (> 1) while their accuracy can deteriorate at lower <b>amplification</b> <b>factors</b> (< 1). This does not necessarily compromise the accuracy of PLW comfort assessment, because the higher <b>amplification</b> <b>factors</b> provide the largest contribution to the discomfort exceedance probability in the comfort criterion. Although LDA, PIV and LES are inherently more accurate techniques, this paper supports the continued use of faster and less expensive techniques for PLW studies. Extrapolating a previous saying, we argue that pedestrian-level wind comfort {{is one of the few}} topics in wind engineering where nature is kind to us concerning turbulent flows...|$|R
