5|$|The five {{processes}} formed what Aristotle {{called the}} soul: {{it was not}} something extra, but the system consisting exactly of these mechanisms. The Aristotelian soul died with the animal and was thus purely biological. Different types of organism possessed different types of soul. Plants had a vegetative soul, responsible for reproduction and growth. Animals had both a vegetative and <b>a</b> <b>sensitive</b> soul, responsible for mobility and sensation. Humans, uniquely, had a vegetative, <b>a</b> <b>sensitive,</b> and a rational soul, capable of thought and reflection.|$|E
5|$|Acute pelvic {{inflammatory}} disease is highly unlikely when recent intercourse has not taken place or an IUD is not being used. <b>A</b> <b>sensitive</b> serum pregnancy test is typically obtained to rule out ectopic pregnancy. Culdocentesis will differentiate hemoperitoneum (ruptured ectopic pregnancy or hemorrhagic cyst) from pelvic sepsis (salpingitis, ruptured pelvic abscess, or ruptured appendix).|$|E
5|$|In 1976 Vainio's Jawohl, jawohl from Kansi kiinni ja kuulemiin ("Shut the Lid and Goodbye") {{was criticized}} for its {{commentary}} about German tourists who visit Lapland. The album also featured <b>a</b> <b>sensitive</b> song, Mä uskon huomispäivään ("I Believe in Tomorrow").

5|$|Kirsten Klein (born 1945) studied {{portrait}} {{and museum}} photography before specializing in landscapes. Her black-and-white photographs often {{make use of}} older techniques such as cyanotype and platinum printing. Concentrating on landscapes, she conveys <b>a</b> <b>sensitive,</b> poetic and often melancholic mood. Since 1976, she has lived on the Danish island of Mors where she has photographed the ever-changing countryside and coastline.|$|E
5|$|Noctilucent clouds {{can form}} only under very {{restricted}} conditions during local summer; their occurrence {{can be used}} as <b>a</b> <b>sensitive</b> guide to changes in the upper atmosphere.

5|$|Over {{the initial}} {{four years of}} {{directed}} observations, Granat observed many galactic and extra-galactic X-ray sources with emphasis on the deep imaging and spectroscopy of the galactic center, broad-band observations of black hole candidates, and X-ray novae.

50|$|The survey {{utilized}} 14-inch square photographic plates, covering about 6° of sky {{per side}} (approximately 36 square degrees per plate). Each {{region of the}} sky was photographed twice, once using <b>a</b> red <b>sensitive</b> Kodak 103a-E plate, and once with <b>a</b> blue <b>sensitive</b> Kodak 103a-O plate. This allowed the color of celestial objects to be recorded.|$|R
5|$|Two primary {{methods have}} been used to define and locate the G-spot as <b>a</b> <b>sensitive</b> area in the vagina: {{self-reported}} levels of arousal during stimulation, and stimulation of the G-spot leading to female ejaculation.

5|$|Comparisons {{between the}} scleral rings of Corythosaurus and modern birds and {{reptiles}} {{suggest that it}} may have been cathemeral, active throughout the day at short intervals. The sense of hearing in hadrosaurids, specifically such as Lophorhothon, also seems to have been greatly developed because of an elongated lagena. The presence of a thin stapes (an ear bone that is rod-like in reptiles), combined with a large eardrum implies the existence of <b>a</b> <b>sensitive</b> middle ear. It is possible that hadrosaurid ears are sensitive enough to detect as much sound as a modern crocodilian.|$|E
5|$|Differentiating between {{infectious}} and non-infectious illness, {{and identifying}} the underlying etiology of infection, {{can be quite}} challenging.

5|$|Gibraltar's {{relationship}} with Spain {{continued to be}} <b>a</b> <b>sensitive</b> subject. By 2002, Britain and Spain had proposed an agreement to share sovereignty over Gibraltar. However, it was opposed {{by the government of}} Gibraltar, which put it to a referendum in November 2002. The agreement was rejected by 17,000 votes to 187– a majority of 98.97%. Although both governments dismissed the outcome as having no legal weight, the outcome of the referendum caused the talks to stall and the British government accepted that it would be unrealistic to try to reach an agreement without the support of the people of Gibraltar.|$|E
5|$|However, some {{problems}} have been encountered with basing agencies in the eastern states. For example, Frontex, the new border agency, has had problems recruiting skilled experts because many {{do not want to}} live in the agency's host city, Warsaw, due to its relatively low wages and standard of living. In addition, plans to place the headquarters of Galileo in Prague met with opposition over security concerns that the city would not be safe enough for such <b>a</b> <b>sensitive</b> agency.|$|E
5|$|In 1862, Lee and the Shaws {{agreed to}} share a house, No. 1 Hatch Street, in an {{affluent}} part of Dublin, and a country cottage on Dalkey Hill, overlooking Killiney Bay. Shaw, <b>a</b> <b>sensitive</b> boy, found the less salubrious parts of Dublin shocking and distressing, and was happier at the cottage. Lee's students often gave him books, which the young Shaw read avidly; thus, as well as gaining a thorough musical knowledge of choral and operatic works, he became familiar with {{a wide spectrum of}} literature.|$|E

5|$|Magnetic Airborne Detection (MAD) {{was used}} to detect {{submerged}} U-boats. It consisted of <b>a</b> <b>sensitive</b> magnetometer installed in the cone of the aircraft (mostly Catalinas) that could detect anomalies in the Earth's magnetic field within a range of 400 feet and was sensitive to detect a submarine to within a few feet. The mine was {{used in conjunction with}} a 65.5lb retro bomb. It was filled with 25lb of Torpex and the weapon was rocket propelled backwards to the line of flight at a speed that counteracted the aircraft's forward motion. It was released rearwards from rails on the wings of the aircraft. Thus, with the aircraft's forward motion cancelled-out by the rocket motor, the device fell directly onto the target.|$|E
5|$|Meyerbeer's immense wealth (increased by {{the success}} of his operas) and his {{continuing}} adherence to his Jewish religion set him apart somewhat from many of his musical contemporaries. They also gave rise to rumours that his success was due to his bribing musical critics. Richard Wagner (see below) accused him of being interested only in money, not music. Meyerbeer was, however, a deeply serious musician and <b>a</b> <b>sensitive</b> personality. He philosophically resigned himself to being a victim of his own success: his extensive diaries and correspondence – which survived the turmoil of 20th-century Europe and have now been published in eight volumes – are an invaluable source for the history of music and theatre in the composer's time.|$|E
