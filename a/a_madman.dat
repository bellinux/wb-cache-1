5|$|Since the attack, Canadians have debated various {{interpretations of}} the events, their significance, and Lépine's motives. Many feminist groups and public {{officials}} have characterized the massacre as an anti-feminist attack that is representative of wider societal violence against women. Consequently, {{the anniversary of the}} massacre has since been commemorated as the National Day of Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women. Other interpretations emphasize Lépine's abuse as a child or suggest that the massacre was simply the isolated act of <b>a</b> <b>madman,</b> unrelated to larger social issues. Still other commentators have blamed violence in the media and increasing poverty, isolation, and alienation in society, particularly in immigrant communities.|$|E

5|$|Having {{identified}} the culprit as Adachi, the party chases and locates him within the TV world. Adachi explains that his actions {{were out of}} both boredom {{and the belief that}} humanity is better off believing what it wants; his claims are dismissed by the party as the rantings of <b>a</b> <b>madman.</b> After fighting Adachi, he is possessed by Ameno-sagiri, the Japanese God of Fog, who reveals that the fog is harmful to people and will eventually cause humanity to fall into a permanent state of ignorance and transform into Shadows. Upon his defeat, he agrees to lift the fog, congratulating the party on their resolve. Defeated, the wounded Adachi agrees to assume responsibility for his actions and turns himself in. The game moves forward to the day before the protagonist must travel home. If the player returns to the Dojima residence, the game ends with the party sending the protagonist off as he departs Inaba. Alternatively, should the player be able to identify the unexplained cause of the Midnight Channel and attempt to resolve this plot element, the protagonist meets with the party, and together they decide to end the case for good.|$|E
