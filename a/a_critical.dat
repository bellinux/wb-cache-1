5|$|In {{the later}} phase of decompression, the {{critical}} event {{is assumed to}} be the presence of a large bubble that has taken up a large quantity of dissolved gas from the adjacent tissue in a joint. If the bubble reaches <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> volume, it will have a mechanical effect on the nerve endings causing pain in a tendon. The bubble volume is the critical parameter. This criterion is used to prevent type I pain-only symptoms. The strategy for a safe ascent at this stage is to prevent any gas phase from growing beyond <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> volume.|$|E

30|$|An {{isolated}} {{critical point}} O(0, 0) {{is called a}} nilpotent singular point if the linear part of systems has double zero eigenvalues but the matrixes of the linearized systems at the origin are not identically null. Over the past twenty years, {{many different kinds of}} topological phase portraits around <b>a</b> nilpotent <b>critical</b> point have been given in [2]. Some results before 1980 were also introduced in [3]. It is well known that it is more difficult to study a phase portrait around <b>a</b> nilpotent <b>critical</b> point than around <b>an</b> element <b>critical</b> point. However, more and more {{attention has been paid to}} the center problem and bifurcation of limit cycles of a system with <b>a</b> nilpotent <b>critical</b> point recently.|$|R
