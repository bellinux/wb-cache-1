5|$|In {{the seventh}} stage to Bordeaux, Trousselier {{punctured}} after only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>kilometers.</b> The {{rest of the}} cyclists quickly sped away from him, and Trousselier had to follow them alone for 200km. <b>A</b> <b>few</b> <b>kilometers</b> before Bordeaux, Trousselier {{caught up with the}} rest, and even managed to win the sprint. Louis Trousselier kept his lead {{until the end of the}} race, winning five stages. Trousselier was accused of bad sportsmanship: he reportedly smashed the inkstands of a control post to prevent his opponents from signing. Unlike the 1904 Tour de France, no stage winners, nor anyone from the top ten of the general classification, were disqualified.|$|E
5|$|By extrapolating the now-eroded {{and tilted}} beds upward, geologists have {{determined}} that these mountains were several kilometers high. Similar projections of the tilted beds downward, coupled with geophysical measurements on the greenstone belts in Canada, suggest the metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks of the belts project downward at least <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>kilometers.</b>|$|E

5|$|Monitoring of {{the volcano}} and {{predictions}} of large eruptions are particularly important because of its location in a densely populated area, {{with the city of}} Kagoshima's 680,000 residents just <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>kilometers</b> from the volcano.

5|$|Janus and Epimetheus {{are called}} co-orbital moons. They are of roughly equal size, with Janus being {{slightly}} larger than Epimetheus. Janus and Epimetheus have orbits with only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>kilometers</b> difference in semi-major axis, close enough that they would collide if they attempted to pass each other. Instead of colliding, however, their gravitational interaction causes them to swap orbits every four years.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—A novel {{configuration}} for a Brillouin distributed {{fiber sensor}} based on Brillouin optical time-domain analysis is proposed. This configuration eliminates many intensity noise issues found in previous schemes. Resolution of 7 m all over a 47 km single-mode fiber was achieved and resolution down to 30 cm in <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>kilometer</b> fiber. Noise reduction makes possible measurements with a 16 times averaging. Index Terms—Brillouin scattering, nonlinear optics, optical fiber sensors. I...|$|R

5|$|Scientists {{have so far}} {{recognized}} {{only one}} class of geological feature on Umbriel—craters. The surface of Umbriel has far more and larger craters than do Ariel and Titania. It shows the least geological activity. In fact, among the Uranian moons only Oberon has more impact craters than Umbriel. The observed crater diameters range from <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>kilometers</b> {{at the low end}} to 210kilometers for the largest known crater, Wokolo. All recognized craters on Umbriel have central peaks, but no crater has rays.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of Uranus's rings are opaque and only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>kilometers</b> wide. The ring system contains little dust overall; it consists mostly of large bodies 0.2–20m in diameter. However, some rings are optically thin: the broad and faint 1986U2R/ζ, μ and ν rings {{are made of}} small dust particles, while the narrow and faint λ ring also contains larger bodies. The relative lack of dust in the ring system {{may be due to}} aerodynamic drag from the extended Uranian exosphere.|$|E
5|$|By mid-July, the German {{forces had}} {{advanced}} within <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>kilometers</b> of Kiev below the Pripyat Marshes. The 1st Panzer Group then went south while the 17th Army struck east and trapped three Soviet armies near Uman. As the Germans eliminated the pocket, the tanks turned north {{and crossed the}} Dnieper. Meanwhile, the 2nd Panzer Group, diverted from Army Group Center, had crossed the Desna River with 2nd Army on its right flank. The two panzer armies now trapped four Soviet armies and parts of two others.|$|E

5|$|In the race's sixth stage, Roberto Visentini won the leg after attacking <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>kilometers</b> {{from the}} finish. Saronni regained the race lead after {{finishing}} {{second on the}} stage and earning a fifteen-second time bonus. The next two stages both resulted in a bunch sprint, with Guido Bontempi winning stage 7 and Franco Chioccioli, stage 8. The ninth stage contained the climbs of Monte Terminillo and La Forca and was considered one of the tougher stages in the race. Malvor-Bottecchia-Vaporella rider Acácio da Silva won the stage as the top of the general classification rankings remained unchanged from the previous days.|$|E
5|$|Jet stream-powered cirrus {{can grow}} {{long enough to}} stretch across continents while {{remaining}} only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>kilometers</b> deep. When visible light interacts with the ice crystals in cirrus cloud, it produces optical phenomena such as sun dogs and halos. Cirrus is known to raise {{the temperature of the}} air beneath the main cloud layer by an average of 10°C (18°F). When the individual filaments become so extensive that they are virtually indistinguishable from one another, they form a sheet of high cloud called cirrostratus. Convection at high altitudes can produce another high-based genus called cirrocumulus, a pattern of small cloud tufts that contain droplets of supercooled water.|$|E
5|$|Sea otters live {{in coastal}} waters 15 to 23meters (50 to 75ft) deep, and usually stay within a {{kilometer}} (⅔mi) of the shore. They are found {{most often in}} areas with protection from the most severe ocean winds, such as rocky coastlines, thick kelp forests, and barrier reefs. Although they are most strongly associated with rocky substrates, sea otters can also live {{in areas where the}} sea floor consists primarily of mud, sand, or silt. Their northern range is limited by ice, as sea otters can survive amidst drift ice but not land-fast ice. Individuals generally occupy a home range <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>kilometers</b> long, and remain there year-round.|$|E

5|$|During a June 2007 {{visit to}} the {{predominantly}} Muslim Albania, Bush was greeted enthusiastically. Albania {{has a population of}} 2.8million, has troops in both Iraq and Afghanistan, and the country's government is highly supportive of American foreign policy. A huge image of the President was hung {{in the middle of the}} capital city of Tirana flanked by Albanian and American flags while a local street was named after him. A shirt-sleeved statue of Bush was unveiled in Fushë-Krujë, <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>kilometers</b> northwest of Tirana. The Bush administration's support for the independence of Albanian-majority Kosovo, while endearing him to the Albanians, has troubled U.S. relations with Serbia, leading to the February 2008 torching of the U.S. embassy in Belgrade.|$|E
5|$|Filming of {{the second}} season's {{southern}} scenes shifted from Malta to Croatia, where the city of Dubrovnik and nearby locations allowed exterior shots of a walled, coastal medieval city. The Walls of Dubrovnik and Fort Lovrijenac were used for scenes in King's Landing and the Red Keep. The island of Lokrum, the St. Dominic monastery in the coastal town of Trogir, the Rector's Palace in Dubrovnik, and the Dubac quarry (<b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>kilometers</b> east) were used for scenes set in Qarth. Scenes set north of the Wall, in the Frostfangs and at the Fist of the First Men, were filmed in November 2011 in Iceland: on the Vatnajökull glacier near Smyrlabjörg, the Svínafellsjökull glacier near Skaftafell and the Mýrdalsjökull glacier near Vik on Höfðabrekkuheiði.|$|E
5|$|Jolly Green 67 flew east at first, {{further into}} {{territory}} {{held by the}} North Vietnamese, before it turned southeast for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>kilometers,</b> when a fire {{broke out in the}} left engine.

The entire crew was listed as MIA and presumed killed: Capt. Peter Hayden Chapman II (pilot), Capt. John Henry Call III (co-pilot), TSgt. William Roy Pearson, TSgt. Allen J. Avery (para-rescuemen), TSgt. Roy D. Prater (Crew Chief), and Sgt. James Harold Alley (combat photographer).
