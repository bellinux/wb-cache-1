5|$|Marquis' {{interest}} in the West was first sparked in 1890 by stories from three fellow printers who had spent a year there.

He boarded a train for Helena, Montana, on July23, 1890, arriving on the 27th. He soon found temporary work at the Helena Independent-Record. It was in Helena that Marquis first met Native Americans. Perhaps more remarkably, {{it was there that}} he first experienced a Chinese restaurant.|$|E

30|$|Interpersonal exchanges {{are also}} {{significant}} mechanisms for communication and 11 % of respondents claimed {{to learn about}} SCALE-UP from <b>a</b> departmental <b>colleague,</b> 11 % from <b>an</b> institutional <b>colleague</b> outside the department, and 6 % from <b>a</b> disciplinary <b>colleague</b> outside the institution. Interpersonal exchanges better allow individuals to clarify information, overcome some of the barriers associated with selective exposure, and tend to change strongly held beliefs more effectively (Rogers [2003]). The exchange of information between <b>colleagues</b> at <b>an</b> institution, but in different departments, may have facilitated the ‘natural’ spread of SCALE-UP into other subjects.|$|R
