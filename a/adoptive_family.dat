5|$|Concern {{with the}} harm of {{separation}} from the mother is characteristic of the belief systems behind some complementary and alternative (CAM) psychotherapies. Such belief systems are concerned {{not only with the}} effect of the young child's {{separation from the}} care of the mother, but with an emotional attachment between mother and child which advocates of these systems believe to develop prenatally. Such attachment is said to lead to emotional trauma if the child is separated from the birth mother and adopted, even if this occurs on the day of birth and even if the <b>adoptive</b> <b>family</b> provides all possible love and care. These beliefs were at one time in existence among some legitimate psychologists of psychoanalytic background. Today, however, beliefs in prenatal communication between mothers and infants are largely confined to unconventional thinkers such as William Emerson.|$|E

Gabaldon joined the Marines when he was only 17 years old; he was a Private First Class (PFC) when his unit was engaged in the Battle of Saipan in 1944. Gabaldon, who acted as the Japanese interpreter for the Second Marines, working alone in front of the lines, entered enemy caves, pillboxes, buildings, and jungle brush, frequently in the face of hostile fire, and succeeded in not only obtaining vital military information, but in convincing well over 1,000 enemy soldiers and civilians to surrender. He was nominated for the Medal of Honor, but was awarded the Silver Star instead. His medal was later upgraded to the Navy Cross. He turned in more enemy soldiers than Sergeant Alvin York, who was awarded the Medal of Honor during World War I for having captured 132 enemy German soldiers.

40|$|Purpose: There is {{a dearth}} of {{research}} on older adoptive parents caring for minor children, despite {{a growing number of}} such adoptions finalized each year. This study offers a large-scale investigation of <b>adoptive</b> <b>families</b> headed by older parents.

Design and Methods: We analyze data from kin (n = 98) and nonkin (n= 310) <b>adoptive</b> <b>families</b> headed by adults aged 60 years and older. Results: We find that older kin <b>adoptive</b> <b>families</b> are smaller, report lower income, and include adoptive mothers with less formal education.

40|$|The way {{in which}} {{relationships}} develop between adopted children and their 'new' grandparents {{is a matter of}} great interest to <b>adoptive</b> <b>families</b> and those working with them. However, it has received little attention in the academic or clinical literature. This study seeks to explore this aspect of family life. At the heart of the study is a set of qualitative interviews with six <b>adoptive</b> <b>families.</b> All three generations were involved. The interviews were analysed using two approaches: Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis, and an approach viewing the respondent as a 'defended psychosocial subject'. From the findings, which are presented using the case study method, there emerges a picture of grandparents as being of great significance within the <b>adoptive</b> <b>families.</b> Their attitude towards adoption, and towards the adopted children, appears as especially significant. Adoption involves three generations. This study then develops a theoretical understanding of the findings. The grandparent is a "witness" to the adopter as a parent. Developmental processes, such as the child's gradual separation from the mother, are worked out differently within <b>adoptive</b> <b>families,</b> and this takes place within the 'family field'. The study concludes with recommendations for practice and policy. This study will be of relevance, not only to members of <b>adoptive</b> <b>families</b> and those working with them, but also to those involved with other family forms, such as step-families and foster families...|$|R

25|$|Externally focused theories, in contrast, {{suggest that}} reunion {{is a way}} for adoptees to {{overcome}} social stigma. First proposed by Goffman, the theory has four parts: 1) adoptees perceive the absence of biological ties as distinguishing their <b>adoptive</b> <b>family</b> from others, 2) this understanding is strengthened by experiences where non-adoptees suggest adoptive ties are weaker than blood ties, 3) together, these factors engender, in some adoptees, a sense of social exclusion, and 4) these adoptees react by searching for a blood tie that reinforces their membership in the community. The externally focused rationale for reunion suggests adoptees may be well adjusted and happy within their adoptive families, but will search as an attempt to resolve experiences of social stigma.|$|E

40|$|The {{process of}} {{adoption}} in the U. S. is incredibly hard to navigate as an adoptive parent. Each primary type of adoption (international, foster, private domestic) comes {{with its own}} challenges and costs.
