Caldwell said {{it was easy to}} obtain guns in New Mexico: [...] "we found it was pretty easy to buy guns. <b>All</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> was show some identification and it was easy to get." [...] Caldwell said she and Stork went to a university library to find the identity [...] "of someone dying very young", next went [...] "to public records and asked for a copy of a birth certificate" [...] and described how [...] "we got a rent receipt book and just made up a rent receipt". [...] "And then we were able to go to several different gun shops in Albuquerque with those two bits of identification and buy five different guns and bullets," [...] said Caldwell. They were able to obtain one Colt [...]38-caliber revolver, and four Ruger [...]357-caliber Security-Six Magnum revolvers. The conspirators smuggled the guns into Oregon by packing them in luggage and putting the luggage on a Greyhound Lines bus. Caldwell said that she and Stork traveled by bus back to the Rajneesh commune so as to avoid airport metal detectors.|$|E
2500|$|SST {{issued the}} Minutemen's debut EP Paranoid Time as its second release in 1980. The songs were {{recorded}} and mixed {{in a single}} night for $300. Minutemen bassist Mike Watt recalled, [...] "It {{was at that point}} we realized <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> was pay for the pressings, that records weren't a gift from Mount Olympus [...] [...] [...] Maybe it was from Greg's experience with ham radios, but he believed if you try, you can get things beyond your little group." [...] Facing hostility towards hardcore punk, SST groups like Black Flag and the Minutemen played wherever they could, mainly at house parties and in basements early on. Black Flag began traveling up the California coast to play Mabuhay Gardens in San Francisco, making seven trips in total. SST house record producer Spot went along as sound-man and tour manager, a job he would perform for several years, along with helping to record much of the label's music.|$|E

When he grabbed at the leg you drew it back and hit hint on the nose again. That was all.|$|E

60|$|Mrs. March {{assured her}} once more {{that she had}} behaved with {{absolute}} impartiality; and she proved to her by a process of reasoning quite irrefragable {{that it was only}} a question of time, with which place had nothing to do, when she and Burnamy should come together again, and all should be made right between them. The fact that she did not know where he was, any more than Mrs. March herself, {{had nothing to do with}} the result; that was a mere detail, which would settle itself.

A child could do it, if in funds. At this thought his hand strayed to his trouser-pocket. A musical crackling of bank-notes proceeded from the depths. His quarterly allowance had been paid to him only a short while before, and, though a willing spender, he still retained a goodly portion of it. He rustled the notes again.

60|$|Their technic {{consisted}} in {{waving their}} tails and moving {{their heads in}} a regular succession of measured movements resulting in a cadence which evidently pleased {{the eye of the}} Mahar as the cadence of our own instrumental music pleases our ears. Sometimes the band took measured steps in unison to one side or the other, or backward and again forward--it all seemed very silly and meaningless to me, {{but at the end of}} the first piece the Mahars upon the rocks showed the first indications of enthusiasm that I had seen displayed by the dominant race of Pellucidar. They beat their great wings up and down, and smote their rocky perches with their mighty tails until the ground shook. Then the band started another piece, and all was again as silent as the grave. That was one great beauty about Mahar music--if you didn't happen to like a piece that was being played <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> was shut your eyes.|$|E

He had been through so much that he was just as subdued as Michael and just as taciturn. He bored most people, who could not understand him. Of course, the truth was the other way around. They bored him. They knew so little of life that he knew the last word of. And one could scarcely get any word out of him. It was not that he had forgotten how to speak, but that he could not see any reason for speaking when nobody could understand. He was really crusty from too-bitter wise experience. But <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> was look at him in his tremendous repose and know that he had been through the thousand hells, including all the frozen ones. His eyes had the same quietness of Michael's. And they had the same wisdom. I'd give almost anything to know how he got his shoulder scarred. It must have been a tiger or a lion." ...|$|E

If you can buy one member of the lower house for ten dollars, how many members can you buy for fifty? It was no such problem in primary {{arithmetic}} that Mr. Balch and his associates had to solve--theirs was in higher mathematics, in permutations and combinations, and in least squares. No wonder the old campaigners speak with tears in their eyes of the days of that ever memorable summer. There were spoils to be picked up in the very streets richer than the sack of the thirty cities; and as the session wore on it is affirmed by men still living that money rained down in the Capitol Park and elsewhere like manna from the skies, if you were one of a chosen band. If you were, <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> was to look in your vest pockets when you took your clothes off in the evening and extract enough legal tender to pay your bill at the Pelican for a week. Mr. Lovejoy having been overheard one day to make a remark concerning the diet of hogs, the next morning certain visitors to the capital were horrified to discover trails of corn leading from the Pelican House to their doorways. Men who had never seen a receiving teller opened bank accounts. No, it was not a problem in simple arithmetic, and Mr. Balch and Mr. Flint, and even Mr. Duncan and Mr. Worthington, covered whole sheets with figures during the stifling days in July. Some men are so valuable that they can be bought twice, or even three times, and they make figuring complicated.|$|E

I had long been convinced that about the nearest approach to the perfect job in this world, where good jobs are so hard to acquire, was to own a paper. <b>All</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> once you had secured your paper, was {{to sit back and}} watch the other fellows work, {{and from time to time}} forward big cheques to the bank. Nothing could be more nicely attuned to the tastes of a Shropshire Psmith. The glimpses I was enabled to get of the workings of this little journal gave me the impression that Comrade White was not attached with any paternal fervour to Cosy Moments. He regarded it, I deduced, not so much as a life-work as in the light of an investment. I assumed that Comrade White had his price, and wrote to my father, who was visiting Carlsbad at the moment, to ascertain what that price might be. He cabled it to me. It was reasonable. Now it so happens that an uncle of mine some years ago left me a considerable number of simoleons, and though I shall not be legally entitled actually to close in on the opulence for a matter of nine months or so, I anticipated that my father would have no objection to staking me to the necessary amount on the security of my little bit of money. My father has spent some time of late hurling me at various professions, and we had agreed some time ago that the Law was to be my long suit. Paper-owning, however, may be combined with being Lord Chancellor, and I knew he would have no objection to my being a Napoleon of the Press on this side. So we closed with Comrade White, and--" ...|$|E

If you only saw his foot, you'd take him to be nineteen feet high, but he wasn't; it was because his foot was out of drawing. He was intended to be nineteen feet high, no doubt, if his foot was made first, but he didn't get there; he was only five feet ten. That's what he was, and that's what he is. You take the lies out of him, and he'll shrink to the size of your hat; you take the malice out of him, and he'll disappear.

One morning, just at daybreak, the last trip she ever made, they took her rudder aboard to mend it; I didn't know anything about it; I backed her out from the wood-yard and went a-weaving down the river all serene.
