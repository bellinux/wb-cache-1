5|$|Ambrose Channel is {{the main}} {{shipping}} channel in <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Port of New York and New Jersey, making it {{the only means of}} accessing an important commercial port. Delays posed a major problem for shipping en route to New York City, and bad weather could close the Channel for days. Ships were forced to wait at the Harbor's entrance for conditions to clear. These delays cost shipping companies substantial amounts of money, with each ship costing between $500 and $4000 per hour it was stopped (roughly $5,700 to $46,000 in 2013 dollars).|$|E

In 1879 he bought the steamer Varuna and the tug Mary Hume and started a shipyard at Ellensburg. In 1880 he added the steam schooner Mary D. Hume, the tug Pelican in 1883, the schooner Berwick in 1887, the steamer Thistle in 1888, and replacement craft in subsequent years. Returning ships brought goods for Hume's general store.|$|E

5|$|Bird's nest custody is an {{uncommon}} {{form of joint}} custody in which, rather than having the children go from one parent's house to the other parent's house, the parents move in <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house in which the children constantly reside. The goal of this arrangement is to shift the burden of upheaval and moving between homes onto the parents rather than the children. However, due to {{the high cost of}} maintaining three households, one for each parent and one for the children, it's rarely a viable option in a custody case.|$|E
5|$|By 1944, the SS-TV {{had been}} {{organized}} into three divisions: {{staff of the}} concentration camps in Germany and Austria, in the occupied territories, and of the extermination camps in Poland. By 1944, it became standard practice to rotate SS members in <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> camps, partly based on manpower needs, but also to provide easier assignments to wounded Waffen-SS members. This rotation of personnel meant that nearly the entire SS {{knew what was going}} on inside the concentration camps, making the entire organization liable for war crimes and crimes against humanity.|$|E

5|$|David Livingstone, {{who visited}} Feira in 1856, {{described}} it as utterly ruined at that time, but still conspicuous by the ramshackle monastery buildings on the site. When Clark arrived about three decades later, the Portuguese still maintained a boma (fort) called Zumbo on the opposite bank of the Luangwa, but the surrounding country, then called Mashukulumbwe, was largely wild, <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> control of any government. Harrison Clark settled at Feira, initially alone. According to a letter he wrote in 1897, he flew the British Merchant Navy's Red Ensign flag over his house.|$|E

As a consequence, the fluctuating movement of children, beggars and homeless people in <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> centre has been considerably reduced, with most of the initial beneficiaries successfully integrated into the programme rather than returning to the streets.|$|E

5|$|In {{interstellar}} astronomy, visible spectra {{can appear}} redder due to scattering processes in a phenomenon {{referred to as}} interstellar reddening – similarly Rayleigh scattering causes the atmospheric reddening of the Sun seen in the sunrise or sunset and causes {{the rest of the}} sky to have a blue color. This phenomenon is distinct from redshifting because the spectroscopic lines are not shifted to other wavelengths in reddened objects and there is an additional dimming and distortion associated with the phenomenon due to photons being scattered in <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> line-of-sight.|$|E
