5000|$|Though {{established}} {{as an alternative}} to policy debate, there has been a strong movement to embrace certain techniques that originated in policy debate (and, correspondingly, a strong backlash movement). Plans, counterplans, critical theory, postmodern theory, debate about the theoretical basis and rules of the activity itself, and critics have all reached more than occasional, if not yet universal, usage. Traditional L-D debate attempts to be free of policy debate [...] "jargon". Lincoln-Douglas speeches can range from a conversational pace to well over 300 words per minute (when trying to maximize the number of arguments and depth of each <b>argument's</b> <b>development).</b> This technique is known as spreading.

40|$|The Science Threshold Learning Outcomes (TLOs) {{developed}} {{recently as}} part of the Learning and Teaching Academic Standards project, reinforce that the ability to develop evidence-based, well-reasoned arguments and to clearly communicate those arguments in a variety of communication modes, are key graduate attributes (Jones, Yates & Kelder, 2011). However, in practice, specific measurement of these skills is limited, particularly in oral presentations. This study describes the initial literature-based development of a rubric for the evaluation of scientific argument in oral presentations (Toulmin, 1958; Sampson, Grooms & Walker, 2009), and the reiterative, data-driven process of refinement of that rubric. The rubric reflects the established framework for the scientific argument, by including criteria for claim, evidence and reasoning, and evaluates these three components across standards that represent the variation within a mid-level undergraduate cohort. Using this rubric, we evaluated the ability of undergraduate science students to communicate scientific arguments in an oral presentation task in which they presented data acquired from an inquiry-based practical (Bugarcic, Zimbardi, Macaranas & Thorn, 2012). Students demonstrated the ability to make claims, supply evidence and articulate reasoning that linked claims with supporting evidence. However, the standard of these elements was varied, and the structure of students’ arguments was not always complete. Using an action-research approach, these initial findings were used to develop student guidelines and alter the curriculum in a subsequent iteration of the course. This intervention resulted in students presenting more complete and higher-quality arguments. Overall, this study reports {{on the development of the}} rubric and describes the design and impact of an evidence-driven teaching intervention that enhances students’ scientific <b>argument</b> <b>development</b> in oral presentations...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{to report on}} teachers’ ability in {{composing}} expository texts. The texts were composed by six high school teachers in Bandar Lampung, Lampung, Indonesia. This study is a descriptive qualitative case study investigating three Analytical and three Hortatory Expository texts. Those texts were analyzed using Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL) {{to deal with the}} textual, experiential and interpersonal metafunctions which were exposed within the texts’ Theme, Transitivity and Mood systems. The results of texts analyses then were confirmed and validated through interviews conducted with the teachers. The result of this study shows that the teachers could demonstrate appropriate strategies to compose the texts although some problems of writing were evident in the texts. The grammatical analyses indicate that the writers had successfully attempted to use some of the main conventions of written argumentative discourse. In this case, to construe textual metafunction, the teachers could employ the demands of the generic form of arguing genre, the linguistic devices as well as the thematic progression. Furthermore, referring to experiential metafunction, the teachers could demonstrate their ability to use various linguistic resources such as appropriate conjunction system and appropriate Process types, Circumstantials and Nominalisations. Finally, interpersonally, the writers could enrich the text with the use of appropriate Modality to create objective arguments and communicate with the readers. However, the study reveals that not all of the teachers’ texts can be considered successful or mature texts in that they seem to have problems with <b>Argument</b> <b>development</b> characterized with lack of fact and objective evidence, inconsistency of argument, and absence of intertextuality. Besides, the inappropriate use of imperative mood, realis/universal statements and some syntax errors are also found. It is found that the teachers’ problems were mainly to do with their time management to carry out the task which resulted in their inability to give maximum efforts to work with the texts. In addition their background knowledge and language competence as well as their commitment to carry out the task also appeared to be problems in producing the texts. Thus, the teachers are suggested to commit to more practices and to have effective teacher trainings to maintain and improve the teachers’ professional competence particularly to concern the issue of SFL and GBA within the curriculum...|$|E
40|$|The {{notion of}} {{progress}} performs a powerful role {{in international law}} discourse. The determination that a certain development constitutes “progress” impacts the production of knowledge, policy-making, allocation of resources, or access to power. The objective of the dissertation is to explore what makes a given development appear as constituting progress in international law. It is an investigation of how meaning about progress may be produced and {{an investigation of the}} consequences of the production of such meaning. The Dissertation argues that, although progress is a convenient rubric to describe international law events (<b>arguments,</b> <b>developments,</b> actions, and so on), it is a notion that is ultimately devoid of meaning unless placed {{in the context of a}} story of how things were, how things are, and how they need to be [...] a “progress narrative”. Progress narratives are by definition non-objective and compete/exclude other progress narratives. International law discourse tends to deny or mask the non-objective character of its progress narratives. Although progress narrative may be a useful discursive form, the de-mystification of such narratives may be an equally productive and meaningful form of international law argument and one that gives access to a different horizon of action and intellectual possibility.

40|$|In this PhD we {{deal with}} lexical {{collocations}} in Modern Greek. Collocation is a widely used term mostly {{in the field of}} applied linguistics, lexicography, computational linguistics and language acquisition studies. Starting point for our research was the native and non-native speaker lexical production. Through our research it was found that while the advanced learner has acquired linguistic competence in Modern Greek, his phraseological/collocational competence in the language, competence in producing typical word sequences, is not in the same way developed. The native speaker has not acquired the phraseology of the language. Acquisition and production of collocations was not our only interest. In this PhD we focus, following a linguistic perspective, on verbal collocations, verb + noun (object) collocations such as δino prosoxi (pay attention), δino eksetasis (take an exam), perno mja apofasi (make a decision), etc. Phraseology (idioms, collocations, prefabricated patterns, similes, etc.) holds a wide spectrum from less to more stereotyped word combinations. A distinction between lexical collocations and idioms in the verb + noun structure is more than necessary and fundamental rixno mia matja (collocation) rixno δilitirio (idiom) Lexical collocations are semi-phrasemes, with restricted collocability due to, according to Cowie (1992), the specialized (figurative, technical) sense of one of their constituent, the verb. We argued that restricted collocability results from the bleached sense of the verb whereas the noun of the collocation carries its literal sense. We claimed that literal sense of the noun is the basic criterion for distinguishing collocations from idioms. Both of the constituents forming an idiom carry figurative sense or the combination as a whole is totally opaque in meaning. Lexical collocations permit lexical substitutability whereas idioms are absolutely frozen. Lexical decomposition of collocations has shown that the verb is a ditransitive verb requiring two internal arguments, a theme (y) {{on one side and a}} goal or source or location (z) on the other. Verb action is a transition, the event is divided into two subevents with a final point of change, referring to the physical world. The noun on the other side is an abstract entity. The ditransitive verbs of Modern Greek analyzed are the following δino, perno, vazo, vγazo, rixno, travao, pjano, arpazo, afino, δixno, ferno Lexical decomposition was based on argument structure-thematic roles and lexical conceptual structure of the predicates developed. Lexical decomposition of a wide range of lexical collocations brought to light a process concerning full, prototypical verb on one side and lexical collocations on the other side: verb of lexical collocations is, gradually, semantically bleached. Semantic bleaching of the verb is meant to be: a) loss of the control of the predicate arguments loss/abolishment of the verb’s arguments and new <b>argument</b> <b>development</b> in their place. ...|$|E

Conversely, poor governance implies that the state fails to satisfy collective needs and fails as an arbiter in civil conflict. If so, a central government has to rely more on the political and economic coercion of minorities and thus increases the probability of violent escalation of civil conflict. © 2005 Taylor & Francis...|$|R
