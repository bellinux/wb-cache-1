40|$|Is Africa {{ready for}} a 'Green Revolution'? In his recent book 'Indigenous <b>Agricultural</b> Revolution: <b>Ecology</b> and Food Production in West Africa', British {{anthropologist}} Paul Richards argues that it is. But, says Richards, it is the peasants themselves who best know their local environments. The author suggests that the way forward is to build on this foundation of local knowledge. As {{an example of the}} peasant enterprise on which researchers should build, Richards cites Mende farmers in Sierra Leone, who are developing their own new rice strains and carrying out their own field trials. Richards does not argue that science cannot help peasant systems. In recent UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) fertilizer trials in Nigeria, half the crops were grown under FAO's ''improved cultivation practices' and half using traditional crop-mixing. The peasant methods yielded far more than FAD's, but fertilizers increased the peasants' yields.

40|$|A simplistic {{explanation}} of why tropical forests degrade or disappear all together is, because loggers take out too many trees, companies convert forest for plantations, and small farmers slash forest to make <b>agricultural</b> fields. Political <b>ecology</b> is a scientific inter-discipline that tries to identify the political dimension of forest resource appropriation, contestation over forest benefits, {{and the role of}} power and discourse in the processes of unsustainable use and resulting forest degradation. This chapter summarizes ten chapters in the volume in which it is published. Several of chapters demonstrate that modern struggles over forests have their roots in colonial periods. Colonial powers used force, but also the argument that deforestation negatively affected the local climate, to expulse forest farmers from timber rich forest lands. Often control of the trade of lucrative forest products like rattan was decided by force. In these struggles, colonial powers used force against local Sultans, local Sultans used force against forest dwellers, and powerful forest dweller groups used force against weaker groups...|$|R
40|$|International audienceFood webs in {{agricultural}} systems {{are complex and}} trophic linkages are difficult to track using conventional methodologies. Here, we review three alternative approaches that allow empirical assessment of feeding interactions: DNA-based techniques, and stable isotope and fatty acid analyses. DNA-based methods, namely multiplex PCR and nextgeneration sequencing, allow identification of food types and host-parasitoid linkages, resulting in taxonomically highly resolved feeding networks. Stable isotopes and fatty acids reflect the assimilation of broader categories of resources, as metabolised into the consumers' tissue, together with the associated energy and nutrient fluxes in the food web. We discuss {{the strengths of the}} approaches but also highlight their limitations, providing practical advice on which technique is best suited to answer specific questions in examining food web interactions in agroecosystems. Future refinements of these techniques, especially when used in combination, could herald a new era in <b>agricultural</b> food web <b>ecology,</b> enabling management and environmental impact to be placed in the mechanistic context of trophic networks...|$|R
40|$|Problem statement: During recent {{several decades}} soil was {{polluted}} {{more and more}} serious by heavy metals because of mining, smelting, irrigating with sewerage and some other human activities. These heavy metals may adversely affect soil <b>ecology,</b> <b>agricultural</b> production or product quality and ground water quality and will ultimately harm to health of mankind by food chain. Approach: We had analyzed the quantity of Lead in two different highways Prishtina-Skopje (near the Ferizaj) and in Prishtina-Gjilan (near the Artane), Kosova. The samples were taken in different distance from routs. Results: The quantity of lead near the highways is very higher. Away from routs the quantity of lead decreases significantly.

40|$|Human {{society is}} {{increasingly}} facing {{a variety of}} complex, intertwined environmental conservation and rural development issues. For example, national park objectives have expanded from the conservation of biological diversity to also include contributing to the livelihood and development needs of local people. Human settlements in fragile uplands create conflicts between upstream agricultural livelihoods and the downstream effects of watershed degradation. Distant and remote populations are brought into both collaborative and conflictual relationships over their interests in shared natural resources, requiring new scales of analysis and integration of the biophysical and social sciences. These conservation and sustainable development (CSD) issues cut across many of the traditional boundaries in natural resource management. As a result, {{the boundaries of the}} traditional disciplines of <b>ecology,</b> <b>agricultural</b> sciences, and the social sciences must be spanned, and science must increasingly be integrated with political and local collaborative processes of governance and decision making.
