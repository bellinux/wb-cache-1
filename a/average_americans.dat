In the episode, Bart uploads a video on YouTube in which Homer rants about airlines' horrible treatment of passengers. It quickly becomes popular and Homer is eventually given his own political cable news show. Homer wins support among <b>average</b> <b>Americans</b> and is chosen by the Republicans to pick their candidate for the next presidential election. He chooses Ted Nugent, but in the end, he realizes that he made the wrong decision and that everything he has said on his show is nonsense, so he admits on television that he is [...] "full of crap".|$|E

500|$|US Census Bureau {{data from}} 2002 {{identified}} {{a series of}} housing characteristics for units owner-occupied units inhabited by households with average incomes, ranging from $40,000 to $60,000. The median square footage for homes occupied by middle income households was 1,700 with 52% of such homes having two or more bathrooms. The median value of these homes was $112,000 with the median year of construction being 1970. Middle income households tended to spend roughly 18% of their monthly income on housing. Considering these statistics {{it is likely that}} many <b>average</b> <b>Americans</b> reside in [...] homes, priced slightly above $100,000 with two or more bathrooms that were built in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

500|$|Homer {{is invited}} to speak his mind on a popular cable news show called Head Butt, on which host Nash Castor and {{commentator}} Adriatica Vel Johnson argue that he will soon be forgotten. However, Homer makes a convincing rant in which he tells the viewers that unlike television [...] such as Nash and Adriatica, he speaks for the common man. When the show is over, the cable network executives give Homer his own television show called Gut Check with Homer Simpson, where he provides a mix of populist and conservative ideas. During one episode, he pours [...] "gravy of freedom" [...] over a steak shaped like America, using the gravy {{as a metaphor for}} the things that make the country great. He then encourages his viewers to [...] "get on the boat" [...] to protest about the bad things in society, and proceeds to place a gravy boat on his head.

On the Today Show he was interviewed by Katie Couric, and proposed to cut Medicare and Social Security for [...] "people who don't need it". He appeared on Face the Nation later in the month, and argued that wealthy Americans should spend more than <b>average</b> <b>Americans</b> to eliminate the budget deficit. His budget numbers were contested by Tim Russert on Meet the Press, during a heated interview, after which, a frustrated Perot considered dropping out of the race. [...] C-SPAN ran a speech by Perot, where he announced that he hoped to run a campaign without [...] "political pros" [...] to avoid the [...] "dirty tricks" [...] of past campaigns. After this appearance, campaign consultant Raymond Strother explained to Perot that professionals such as pollster Mark Penn were essential to a successful campaign. In late April, Perot hired former Chicago Tribune editor James Squires as press spokesman to handle the large volume of interview requests from the media. At the end of the month, Perot realized that he had spent too much time visiting talk shows, and announced that he would spend his next few weeks focusing on the issues.|$|E

500|$|Herbert [...] "Herb" [...] Powell (voiced by Danny DeVito), is Homer's {{paternal}} half-brother. He resembles Homer, {{though he}} is much thinner, boasts {{a full head of}} hair and is more astute. He first appeared in the season two episode [...] "Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?" [...] when Homer discovered he had a half-brother, the product of a short-lived affair between his father Abe and a carnival dunk-tank worker who was also a prostitute (identified in The Simpsons Uncensored Family Album as [...] "Gaby"). [...] A year after putting the baby up for adoption, Abe married Mona, who insisted he promise never to tell Homer about Herb or how he was conceived. [...] Herb was raised by his adoptive parents Edward and [...] Mililani Powell (first names given in The Simpsons Uncensored Family Album), put himself through college by working odd jobs, then founded Powell Motors, a car company based in Detroit. Herb is an exception to [...] "the Simpson Gene", which causes all male members of the Simpson family to gradually lose their intelligence as they mature, as Herb is intelligent, successful and an astute businessman, becoming extremely wealthy due to his car dealership. Overjoyed to learn that he had a blood family, Herb bonded with the children and hired Homer, as a representative of <b>average</b> <b>Americans,</b> to design a car. The car was a flop, bankrupting the company, and Herb angrily rejects Homer as a brother and became a street vagrant. The episode was written by Jeff Martin but the idea of having Herb voiced by Danny DeVito had been pitched by Sam Simon. Some were upset with the sad ending of the episode, and as a result the producers decided to make a sequel. Herb re-appeared the next season in [...] "Brother, Can You Spare Two Dimes?". Now broke and homeless, he briefly settled in the Simpson household, despite his intense continuing antipathy toward Homer. Homer loaned Herb $2000, which Herb used to build an invention that translated infantile speech into comprehensible English, based on observations he made of Maggie. He proceeded to mass-produce his new product and regained his fortune. In gratitude, he bought gifts for each member of the family and paid Homer back with his forgiveness. Homer's [...] "seldom seen half-brother" [...] has had only one brief speaking part since this episode: DeVito reprised his role for the Season 24 episode [...] "The Changing of the Guardian", in which Powell's answering machine message, [...] "Hi, you've reached Herb Powell.

2500|$|O'Reilly {{has long}} {{said that his}} {{inspiration}} for speaking up for <b>average</b> <b>Americans</b> is his working-class roots. He has pointed to his boyhood home in Levittown, New York, as a credential. In an interview with The Washington Post, O'Reilly's mother said that her family lived in Westbury, which is {{a few miles from}} Levittown. Citing this interview, then liberal talk-show pundit Al Franken accused O'Reilly of distorting his background to create a more working-class image. O'Reilly countered that The Washington Post misquoted his mother and that his mother still lives in his childhood home, which was built by William Levitt. O'Reilly placed a copy of the house's mortgage on his website; the mortgage shows a Levittown postal address. O'Reilly has also said, [...] "You don't come from any lower than I came from on an economic scale" [...] and that his father, a currency accountant for an oil company, [...] "never earned more than $35,000 a year in his life."

On January27, 2010, Obama further condemned the decision during the 2010 State of the Union Address, stating that, [...] "Last week, the Supreme Court reversed a century of law to open the floodgates for special interests â including foreign corporations â to spend without limit in our elections. Well, I don't think American elections should be bankrolled by America's most powerful interests, or worse, by foreign entities."

[...] According to Obama, the [...] "audacity of hope" [...] is [...] "God's greatest gift" [...] to Americans, allowing him to feel optimistic that the lives of <b>average</b> <b>Americans</b> can be improved with the right governmental policies.

2500|$|McCain {{appeared}} to undercut {{his line of}} attack by picking first-term Alaska governor Sarah Palin to be his running mate. Palin had been governor only since 2006, and before {{that had been a}} council member and mayor of Wasilla. The choice of Palin was controversial, however it {{appeared to}} solve two pressing concernsâMcCain's age and health since a youthful vice president would succeed him to office if he died or became incapacitated, and appealing to right-wing conservatives, a group that had been comparatively unmoved by McCain. Palin also came off as more down-to-earth and relatable to <b>average</b> <b>Americans</b> than McCain, widely tarbrushed as a [...] "Beltway insider". However, media interviews suggested that Palin lacked knowledge on certain key issues, and they cast doubt among many voters about her qualifications to be Vice President or President. In this regard, her inexperience was also a liability when McCain's age and health were factored inâthere was a higher-than-normal probability of Palin succeeding to the presidency and many moderates and independents chafed at this idea. [...] "One 72 year old heartbeat away from the presidency" [...] became a popular anti-GOP slogan. Late night TV host David Letterman jokingly referred to Palin as resembling [...] "a slutty flight attendant" [...] and even Obama himself on a September 9 speech referred to the Alaska governor as [...] "the equivalent of putting lipstick on a pig". She also came under attack on everything from her 17-year-old daughter giving birth to a child out of wedlock to actively participating in hunting moose and other animals. Because of Palin's conservative views, there was also concern that she would alienate independents and moderates, two groups that pundits observed McCain would need to win the election.|$|E
