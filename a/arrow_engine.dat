50|$|For 62 years, Waukesha was an {{independent}} supplier of gasoline engines, diesel engines, multifuel engines (gasoline/kerosene/ethanol), and LNG/propane engines to many truck, tractor, heavy equipment, automobile, boat, ship, and engine-generator manufacturers. In 1906, The Waukesha Motor Company {{was founded in}} Waukesha, Wisconsin. In 1957, Waukesha bought the Climax Engineering Co. of Clinton, Iowa, also a noted builder of large engines. In 1968, Waukesha Motor Company was acquired by the Bangor-Punta Corporation. In 1973, Waukesha sold the Climax division to the <b>Arrow</b> <b>Engine</b> Company. In 1974, Waukesha Motor Company was sold to Dresser Industries and became Dresser's Waukesha Engine Division; its typical nicknames afterward were Waukesha Engine and Dresser Waukesha. In 1989, Dresser acquired the Brons company of the Netherlands. In 2010, Dresser, including Dresser Waukesha, was acquired by GE Energy.|$|E

5000|$|In 1987, Warwick {{moved to}} the Arrows team {{alongside}} his Jaguar teammate Eddie Cheever, ending the season with 3 points scored. The 1988 season saw an improvement on the Arrows performance due to the powerful Megatron (a re-badged BMW M12) engine and Warwick finished 7 times in the top 6, earning him 17 points and a respectable 8th position in the championship. His best race of the season was 4th in the Italian Grand Prix at Monza where he finished only half a second behind Cheever. Italy was also notable {{in that it was}} the first time since the beginning of 1987 that <b>Arrows</b> <b>engine</b> guru Heini Mader finally solved the problem with the FIA's mandatory pop-off valve which restricted turbo boost.

25|$|The Arrow Sport F was {{specifically}} built {{to accommodate the}} low-cost, yet heavy <b>Arrow</b> F V-8 <b>engine,</b> an aircraft modification of the Ford V-8. The engine was designed by Ford Engineer David E. Anderson with an aluminum oil pan, aluminum cylnders, and a 2:1 gear reduction to drive the prop at reasonable rpm ranges. The engine weighed 402lbs for 85hp vrs 182lbs for an equivalent Continental aircraft engine.|$|R
50|$|Three Guans {{were ordered}} by the Air Ministry in 1925. As in the Gorcock, power came from {{variants}} of the Napier Lion broad <b>arrow</b> 12-cylinder <b>engine.</b> The first Guan had the 450 hp (335 kW) geared Lion IV; the second the ungeared 525 hp (475 kW) Lion VI. A projected third aircraft would have had an inverted Lion, known as the Lioness, but this machine was not built. These engines had their exhaust-driven supercharger (a concept nowadays known as turbocharger) mounted on the nose under the propeller, with much exposed pipework. The radiator was mounted under the fuselage and between the undercarriage legs. Initially these engines drove two-blade fixed-pitch airscrews, but the first aircraft was later fitted with a metal variable-pitch constant-speed propeller.|$|R

The heavy-armed Romans could do nothing against us; but marched steadily on--leaving numbers of dead behind them--till they reached their former camp at Gabao, six miles away. Here Cestius waited two days but, seeing how the hills around him swarmed with our people, who flocked in from all quarters, he gave the word for a further retreat; killing all the beasts of burden, and leaving all the baggage behind, and taking on only those animals which bore the <b>arrows</b> and <b>engines</b> of war.

50|$|The {{accounts}} of Polybius {{leading up to}} the Battle of Telamon, c. 225 BC mention chariot warfare, but it was ultimately unsuccessful. The Gauls met comprehensive defeat by the Roman legions under Papus and Regulus. Chariot forces also attacked the legions as they were disembarking from ships during Caesar's invasion of Britain, but the Roman commander drove off the fast-moving assailants using covering fire (slings, <b>arrows</b> and <b>engines</b> of war) from his ships, and reinforcing his shore party of infantry to charge and drive off the attack. In the open field against Caesar, the Gallic/Celtics apparently deployed chariots with a driver and an infantry fighter armed with javelins. During the clash, the chariots would drop off their warriors to attack the enemy and retire a short distance away, massed in reserve. From this position they could retrieve the assault troops if the engagement was going badly, or apparently pick them up and deploy elsewhere. Caesar's troops were discomfited by one such attack, and he met it by withdrawing into his fortified redoubt. A later Gallic attack against the Roman camp was routed.|$|R
50|$|Multi-cylinder {{internal}} combustion engines have their cylinder banks arranged in different ways. If {{there are just}} two, they may be in-line, opposed or at an angle, the latter often described as a Vee (or V) arrangement. When {{there are more than}} two cylinders, they are either arranged radially, in-line or in in-line groups. Thus a V-6 engine has two banks of three cylinders at an angle driving a common crankshaft, a V-12 two groups of six in-line. Broad <b>arrow</b> or W <b>engines</b> have three groups, one vertical and the two others symmetrically angled at less than 90° on either side. The Napier Lion was an aircraft engine from the 1920s with this layout, a twelve-cylinder motor with three in-line groups of four cylinders.|$|R
50|$|For 2001 he was {{retained}} by <b>Arrows.</b> The Supertec <b>engines</b> {{were replaced by}} Asiatech units and de la Rosa was dropped {{on the eve of}} the season in favour of the Red Bull-backed Enrique Bernoldi. The package was more reliable but less competitive and Verstappen was hurt on occasion by indifferent qualifying form (often lining up behind his rookie team-mate on the grid). Highlights of the season included running 2nd at Sepang having started 18th, making a superb start and running well in changing conditions before dropping to 7th and later scoring the team's only point of the year for 6th at the A1-Ring. Less impressive were his performances at Interlagos, where he ran into the back of leader Juan Pablo Montoya just after being lapped and Montreal where he moved into the top 6 but asked too much of his brakes and crashed out on a day when points were possible.|$|R
6000|$|At length, {{having left}} {{more than two-thirds}} of their brave companions behind them, the yeomanry {{attained}} the point, which, being commanded by <b>arrows</b> and <b>engines</b> from the battlements, might be considered as that of comparative safety. A volley of large stones, and square-headed bolts of great size and thickness, effectually stopped the farther progress of the pursuit, and those who had led it drew back their desultory forces to the plain, where, with shouts of jubilee and exultation, their countrymen were employed in securing the plunder of the field; while some, impelled by hatred and revenge, mangled and mutilated the limbs of the dead Normans, in a manner unworthy of their national cause and their own courage. The fearful yells with which this dreadful work was consummated, while it struck horror into the minds of the slender garrison of the Garde Doloureuse, inspired them at the same time with the resolution rather to defend the fortress to the last extremity, than to submit to the mercy of so vengeful an enemy. [Footnote: This is by no means exaggerated in the text. A very honourable testimony was given to their valour by King Henry II., {{in a letter to the}} Greek Emperor, Emanuel Commenus. This prince having desired that an account might be sent him of all that was remarkable in the island of Great Britain, Henry, in answer to that request, was pleased to take notice, among other particulars, of the extraordinary courage and fierceness of the Welsh, who were not afraid to fight unarmed with enemies armed at all points, valiantly shedding their blood in the cause of their country, and purchasing glory at the expense of their lives.] ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{first two}} rulers {{to make use}} of siege engines to a large extent were Philip II of Macedonia and Alexander the Great. Their large engines spurred an {{evolution}} that led to impressive machines, like the Demetrius Poliorcetes' Helepolis (or [...] "Taker of Cities") of 304 BC: nine stories high and plated with iron, it stood 40 m (132 ft) tall and 21 m (69 ft) wide, weighing 180 t (360,000 lb). The most utilized engines were simple battering rams, or tortoises, propelled in several ingenious ways that allowed the attackers to reach the walls or ditches with a certain degree of safety. For sea sieges or battles, seesaw-like machines (sambykē or sambuca) were used. These were giant ladders, hinged and mounted on a base mechanism and used for transferring marines onto the sea walls of coastal towns. They were normally mounted on two or more ships tied together and some sambykē included shields at the top to protect the climbers from <b>arrows.</b> Other hinged <b>engines</b> were used to catch enemy equipment or even opposing soldiers with opposable appendices which are probably ancestors to the Roman corvus. Other weapons dropped heavy weights on opposing soldiers.|$|R
25|$|Selecting and {{commanding}} units only {{forms the}} basic gameplay of Soulblighter, however. The battles {{are more complex}} than simply commanding units to attack the enemy, with strategy and awareness of {{the conditions of the}} battlefield, and even the weather, also playing important roles. For example, due to the game's physics engine, objects react with one another, with units, and with the terrain. This can manifest itself simply in a severed head bouncing off one of the player's units and changing direction. However, it can also have more serious consequences. For example, a dwarf could throw a molotov cocktail at an enemy on a hillside and miss, with the projectile rolling back down the hill towards the player's own units. Projectiles in general, both those used by the player and the enemy, have no guarantee of hitting anything; they are merely propelled in the direction instructed by the physics <b>engine.</b> <b>Arrows,</b> for example, may miss their intended target due to a small degree of simulated aiming error that becomes more significant at long range, or the target may move out of the way, or behind a tree or building. If archers are firing at enemies who are engaged in melee combat, they may also hit the player's own units instead of the enemy, causing the same amount of damage. This is also true of dwarfs' molotov cocktails. As such, friendly fire is an important aspect of the game. The weather is also something the player must always bear in mind. For example, rain or snow can put out explosive-based attacks. It is also much easier for projectile units to hit enemies below them rather than above them, and as such, positioning of the player's units is an important aspect of the game.|$|R

Edward's son Dennis and {{daughter}} Pat then helped get the engine installed in a Piper <b>Arrow</b> airplane. The <b>engine</b> was flown for about 700 hours from 1987 through 1991. Their longest-life engine ran for nearly 4000 hours before overhaul. Dyna-Cam opened a research and development facility about 1993 and won many various awards from NASA, the United States Navy, the United States Marine Corps, California Energy Commission, Air Quality Management District, and Los Angeles Regional Technology Alliance for different variations of the same Dyna-Cam engine. About 40 prototype engines were built by the Herrmann Group and another 25 built by the Dyna-Cam Group since they acquired the engine and opened their shop. A new patent was granted to Dennis Palmer and Edward Palmer, first in 1985 and then several more around 2000 to Dennis Palmer. In 2003 the assets of the Dyna-Cam Engine Corporation were acquired by Aero-Marine Corporation, who changed their name to Axial Vector Engine Corporation.
