25|$|In this environment, states Rosalind O'Hanlon, a {{professor}} of Indian History, the newly arrived colonial East India Company officials, attempted to gain commercial interests in India by balancing Hindu and Muslim conflicting interests, by aligning with regional rulers and large assemblies of military monks. The British Company officials adopted constitutional laws segregated by religion and caste. The legal code and colonial <b>administrative</b> <b>practice</b> was largely divided into Muslim law and Hindu law, the latter including laws for Buddhists, Jains and Sikhs. In this transitory phase, Brahmins together with scribes, ascetics and merchants who accepted Hindu social and spiritual codes, became the deferred-to-authority on Hindu texts, law and administration of Hindu matters.|$|E
25|$|An {{indigenous}} elite {{trained in}} French <b>administrative</b> <b>practice</b> formed an intermediary group between the French and the Africans. Assimilation was practiced in Ivory Coast {{to the extent}} that after 1930, a small number of Westernized Ivoirians were granted the right to apply for French citizenship. Most Ivoirians, however, were classified as French subjects and were governed under the principle of association. As subjects of France, natives outside the above-mentioned civilized elite had no political rights until they entered it. They were drafted for work in mines, on plantations, as porters, and on public projects as part of their tax responsibility. They were expected to serve in the military and were subject to the indigénat, a separate system of law.|$|E

500|$|Most {{historians have}} seen Nigel as an administrator, not a {{religious}} bishop. The historian David Knowles wrote that Nigel [...] "had devoted all his energies and abilities to matters purely secular; {{in the department of}} financial administration he was supreme, and more than any other man he helped to ensure the continuity and development of the excellent <b>administrative</b> <b>practice</b> initiated under Henry I". The historian W. L. Warren said that [...] "Stephen probably paid dearly for the dismissal of Bishop Roger of Salisbury and Bishop Nigel of Ely, for the expertise of the exchequer was lodged in their expertise." [...] Whatever Nigel's administrative talent, his ecclesiastical abilities are generally held to be low; the Gesta Stephani says of both him and Alexander that they were [...] "men who loved display and were rash in their reckless presumption... disregarding the holy and simple manner of life that befits a Christian priest they devoted themselves so utterly to warfare and the vanities of this world that whenever they attended court by appointment they... aroused general astonishment on account of the extraordinary concourse of knights by which they were surrounded on every side." ...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} about the {{problems}} with the <b>administrative</b> <b>practices</b> and procedures in the IMF. It argues that currently the IMF lacks <b>administrative</b> <b>practices</b> and procedures that are consistent with the requirements of good governance. There are 2 requirements for such <b>administrative</b> <b>practices</b> and procedures. The first is clearly articulated and publicly available standards that guide IMF staff in their work and that other stakeholders can utilize in measuring the performance of IMF staff. These standards should set out both the substantive and procedural requirements applicable to the operations of the IMF. The second is a mechanism through which IMF staff and management can be held accountable for their failure to comply with the applicable procedures. The paper concludes with recommendations on designing a formal and comprehensive set of operational policies and procedures for the IMG and a call for the IMF to establish and ombudsman to oversee compliance with these operational policies and procedures...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the opinions of administrators regarding <b>administrative</b> <b>practices</b> associated with declining enrollment. Options chosen by three types of administrators in school districts experiencing a decline in enrollment were compared to those chosen by administrators in school districts not experiencing a decline in enrollment. The design of this investigation was ex post facto in nature. A survey study included 1, 000 randomly sampled administrators from suburban school systems in five states located in the Great Lakes area. The three types of administrators included in the study were junior high school principals, senior high school principals, and superintendents. Three hypotheses were developed and tested by three dependent variables represented by options associated with Instructional Practices, Personnel <b>Practices,</b> and <b>Administrative</b> <b>Practices.</b> The primary independent variables were Enrollment Status and Administrative Position. Relevant demographic variables such as Age, Number of Years of Educational Administrative Experience, and Recency of Graduate Work also were utilized in testing the hypotheses. Means were calculated for the scores on the three dependent variables for the three types of administrators. Both two-way and three-way factorial analyses were utilized to test the null hypotheses for significant main effect differences and interactions. The principal findings of the study indicated that administrators held similar opinions regarding Instructional Practices options and Personnel Practices options. However, there were significant main effect differences among administrators regarding <b>Administrative</b> <b>Practices</b> options. Administrators seemed more willing to implement cutbacks represented in <b>Administrative</b> <b>Practices.</b> This finding was the same both for the administrators en toto and for those sorted by Enrollment Status. Superintendents apparently were more willing to make cutbacks in <b>Administrative</b> <b>Practices</b> than the two types of principals. Number of Years of Educational Administrative Experience had an impact upon the choices selected by administrators when testing for Enrollment Status, but only on the <b>Administrative</b> <b>Practices</b> options. Significant interactions were evident within those schools experiencing no decline in enrollment. Within school districts not experiencing a decline in enrollment, administrators with 6 - 10 Years of Educational Administrative Experience were more willing to implement cutbacks than were others...|$|R
