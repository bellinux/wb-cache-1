5|$|Early in the 1934 season, Ruth openly campaigned {{to become}} the Yankees manager. However, the Yankee job was never a serious possibility. Ruppert always {{supported}} McCarthy, who would remain in his position for another 12 seasons. Ruth and McCarthy's relationship had been lukewarm <b>at</b> <b>best,</b> <b>and</b> Ruth's managerial ambitions further chilled their relations. By {{the end of the}} season, Ruth hinted that he would retire unless Ruppert named him manager of the Yankees. When the time came, Ruppert wanted his slugger to leave the team without drama or hard feelings.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, {{within a few}} years to decades of the {{destruction}} of Easter Island society by slave raiding and introduced epidemics, two amateur investigators recorded readings and recitations of rongorongo tablets by Easter Islanders.

5|$|Jacobson's case {{attracted}} {{some national}} media attention. Civil liberties advocates supported him, worried {{over what they}} saw as dangerous growth in government police powers during the Reagan and Bush administrations, when law enforcement were alleged to have cracked down on drugs as well as pornography distribution {{at the behest of the}} Religious Right. Operation Looking Glass, the USPS claimed, had netted 147 convictions, but only 35 where evidence was found that the offenders had either been involved in producing child pornography or molested children. Critics claimed that the government was exaggerating the child-porn problem <b>at</b> <b>best</b> <b>and</b> contributing to it at worst, possibly by introducing some consumers to material they might never have developed a taste for otherwise.|$|E

5|$|Parseghian also {{recognized}} talent in quarterback John Huarte {{and wide receiver}} Jack Snow, who had been used only sparingly for two seasons by previous coaches. Huarte could throw far and accurately but was soft-spoken, a trait Parseghian and his staff helped change. Snow was large for a receiver of his era, but Parseghian thought his athleticism and sure hands would make him a good wideout. Still, expectations were muted for the 1964 season: Parseghian told his coaches that the team would have a 6–4 record if they were lucky. Sports Illustrated predicted a 5–5 record <b>at</b> <b>best,</b> <b>and</b> the team did not rank among the top 20 programs {{in the country in}} the pre-season AP Poll.|$|E
5|$|Ranavalona's European contemporaries {{generally}} condemned her {{policies and}} characterized {{her as a}} tyrant <b>at</b> <b>best</b> <b>and</b> insane at worst.

5|$|During the 11th century, the navy, {{like the}} Empire itself, began to decline. Faced with new naval {{challenges}} from the West, the Byzantines were increasingly forced {{to rely on}} the navies of Italian city-states like Venice and Genoa, with disastrous effects on Byzantium's economy and sovereignty. A period of recovery under the Komnenians was followed by another period of decline, which culminated in the disastrous dissolution of the Empire by the Fourth Crusade in 1204. After the Empire was restored in 1261, several emperors of the Palaiologan dynasty tried to revive the navy, but their efforts had only a temporary effect. By the mid-14th century, the Byzantine fleet, which once could put hundreds of warships to sea, was limited to a few dozen <b>at</b> <b>best,</b> <b>and</b> control of the Aegean passed definitively to the Italian and Ottoman navies. The diminished navy, however, continued to be active until the fall of the Byzantine Empire to the Ottomans in 1453.|$|E

5|$|George VI's {{coronation}} at Westminster Abbey {{took place}} on 12 May 1937, the date previously intended for Edward's coronation. In a break with tradition, Queen Mary attended the ceremony {{in a show of}} support for her son. There was no Durbar held in Delhi for George VI, as had occurred for his father, as the cost would have been a burden to the government of India. Rising Indian nationalism made the welcome that the royal party would have received likely to be muted <b>at</b> <b>best,</b> <b>and</b> a prolonged absence from Britain would have been undesirable in the tense period before the Second World War. Two overseas tours were undertaken, to France and to North America, both of which promised greater strategic advantages in the event of war.|$|E

Indeed, the first scholarly report on the battle, by James Henry Breasted in 1903, praised the sources that allowed the reconstruction of the battle with certainty. However, some historians argue that the battle was a draw <b>at</b> <b>best</b> <b>and</b> that Egyptian influence over Amurru and Qadesh seems to have been lost forever.|$|E

25|$|Many modern {{scientists}} have also critiqued classical environmental determinism as unscientific. Carl Sauer criticized the premature generalizations resulting from bias in environmentalism in 1924.

Furthermore, since evolutionary change manifests over very long time periods, some argue {{that the ability to}} adequately correlate human behaviour with any specific environmental condition is speculative <b>at</b> <b>best</b> <b>and</b> impossible at worst.|$|E
