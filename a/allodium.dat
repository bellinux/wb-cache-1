2500|$|In , {{director}} Sam Dunn described Vikernes as [...] "the {{most notorious}} metal musician of all time" [...] {{due to his}} crimes {{as well as his}} political and religious views. In the late 1990s, [...] "to avoid confusion" [...] and [...] "to find a term more suitable and accurate", Vikernes coined the name [...] "Ôðalism" [...] for his beliefs, based on the Odal rune. He explains that Ôðalism encompasses [...] "Paganism, traditional nationalism, racialism and environmentalism". Vikernes contrasts it with [...] "modern 'civilization'" [...] which he equates with [...] "capitalism, materialism, Judeo-Christianity, pollution, urbanization, race-mixing, Americanization, socialism, globalization, et cetera".

500|$|Further {{unification}} of the Lithuanian tribes was {{facilitated by the}} social changes {{that took place in}} Lithuania during this period. Private land ownership was established (<b>allodiums,</b> Lithuanian: atolai), which would later evolve into a feudal system. As attested by many chronicles, it was the principal form of organization governing land ownership in the 13th century. Under this system, known in England as primogeniture, only the eldest son could inherit lands, which allowed dukes to consolidate their holdings. Social classes and divisions of labor also began taking shape. There were classes of experienced soldiers (bajoras), of free peasants (laukininkas), and of [...] "unfree" [...] people (kaimynas and šeimynykštis). In order to enforce this social structure, a united state was needed. Another force behind unification was the desire to take advantage of Ruthenian lands, which were suffering from the Mongol invasion. Temporary alliances among Lithuanian dukes often sufficed for military ventures into, and plundering of, these lands (including Pskov, plundered in 1213). Altogether, between 1201 and 1236, Lithuanians launched at least 22 incursions into Livonia, 14 into Rus, and 4 into Poland. The ongoing administration of conquered territories, however, required a strong and unified central power.|$|R

50|$|Most libertarians (such as {{free market}} {{environmental}}ists and Objectivists) believe environmental damage {{is more often}} than not a result of state ownership and mismanagement of natural resources, for example by the military-industrial complex, and claim that private ownership of all natural resources will result in a better environment, as a private owner of property will have more incentive to ensure the longer term value of the property.

50|$|As a title, {{by the end}} of {{the medieval}} era, prince was borne by rulers of territories that were either {{substantially}} smaller than or exercised fewer of the rights of sovereignty than did emperors and kings. A lord of even a quite small territory might come to be referred to as a prince before the 13th century, either from translations of a native title into the Latin princeps (as for the hereditary ruler of Wales), or when the lord's territory was allodial. The lord of an <b>allodium</b> owned his lands and exercised prerogatives over the subjects in his territory absolutely, owing no feudal homage or duty as a vassal to a liege lord, nor being subject to any higher jurisdiction. Most small territories designated as principalities during feudal eras were allodial, e.g. the Princedom of Dombes.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Allodium,</b> meaning [...] "land {{exempt from}} feudal duties", is first attested in English-language texts in the 11th-century Domesday Book, but was {{borrowed}} from Old Low Franconian *allōd, meaning [...] "full property", and attested in Latin as e.g., alodis, alaudes, in the Salic law (ca. A.D. 507-596) and other Germanic laws. The word is {{a compound of}} *all [...] "whole, full" [...] and *ōd [...] "estate, property" [...] (cf. Old Saxon ōd, Old English ead, Old Norse auðr). Allodial tenure {{seems to have been}} common throughout northern Europe, but is now unknown in common law jurisdictions apart from the United States. An allod could be converted into a fief, by the owner surrendering it to a lord and receiving it back as a fief. Allodial titles are known as udal tenure in Orkney and Shetland, the only parts of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland where they exist.|$|E
5000|$|Emperor Lothair III (1133-1137) {{began to}} reassert his claims by {{repeatedly}} choosing the Kaiserpfalz at Altenburg (Castro Plysn) as his temporary residence and by promoting the colonization the surrounding estates {{up to the}} Ore Mountains {{in the course of}} the Ostsiedlung, including the foundation of the Benedictine abbey of Chemnitz. He also seized parts of the homelands of the Lusatian Margrave Henry of Groitzsch, who had died without heirs in 1135. The Reichsgut gained in importance with the accession of King Conrad III of Germany from the House of Hohenstaufen in 1138: As Conrad's elder brother Duke Frederick II of Swabia held the Swabian home territories of the Hohenstaufen dynasty, the King had to rely on the Pleissnerland around the Altenburg Kaiserpfalz as a personal <b>allodium</b> in his quarrels with the mighty Bavarian duke Henry the Proud and his successors from the House of Welf.|$|E
5000|$|In English common law, the Crown has radical title or the <b>allodium</b> of all land in England, {{meaning that}} it is the {{ultimate}} [...] "owner" [...] of all land. However, the Crown can grant ownership in an abstract entity—called an estate in land—which is what is owned rather than the land it represents. The fee simple estate is also called [...] "estate in fee simple" [...] or [...] "fee-simple title", sometimes simply [...] "freehold" [...] in England and Wales. From the start of the Norman period, when feudalism was introduced to England, the tenant or [...] "holder" [...] of a fief could not alienate (sell) it from the possession of his overlord. However, a tenant could separate a parcel of the land and grant it as a subordinate fief to his own sub-tenant, a process known as sub-enfeoffing or [...] "subinfeudation". The 1290 Statute of Quia Emptores abolished subinfeudation and instead allowed the sale of fee simple estates.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most likely}} {{candidate}} for the biological father of Dirk and Waldger is Radboud, prince of the Frisians. (Note: this link is incorrect as it links to King Redbad who ruled about 760) Waldger's nickname Freso may also be indicative of this origin. This prince Radboud fell in battle in 874, while repelling a Viking incursion together with Reginar [...] "Longneck" [...] (Count of Maasgau, later Duke of Lorraine). At this time Dirk and Waldger were still infants. It is further speculated that because Gerolf's sister may have been Dirk and Waldger's mother, her brother acted as her children's guardian after their father had been killed. While Dirk and Waldger were still minors, Gerolf, as guardian, presumably was then appointed count of the threatened area {{to protect it from}} the Vikings. Later on, after Gerolf had died without leaving any sons of his own, Dirk then inherited the fief or was appointed as its next count.
