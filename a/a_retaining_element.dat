40|$|Structures {{placed on}} hillsides often present {{a number of}} {{challenges}} and {{a limited number of}} economical choices for site design. An option sometimes employed is to use the building frame as <b>a</b> <b>retaining</b> <b>element,</b> comprising a Rigidly Framed Earth Retaining Structure (RFERS). The relationship between temperature and earth pressure acting on RFERS, is explored in this monograph through a 4. 5 year monitoring program of a heavily instrumented in service structure. The data indicated that the coefficient of earth pressure behind the monitored RFERS had a strong linear correlation with temperature. The study also revealed that thermal cycles, rather than lateral earth pressure, were the cause of failure in many structural elements. The book demonstrates that depending on the relative stiffness of the retained soil mass and that of the structural frame, the developed lateral earth pressure, during thermal expansion, can reach magnitudes several times larger than those determined using classical earth pressure theories. Additionally, a nearly perpetual lateral displacement away from the retained soil mass may occur at the free end of the RFERS leading to unacceptable serviceability problems.   These results suggest that reinforced concrete structures designed for the flexural stresses imposed by the backfill soil will be inadequately reinforced to resist stresses produced during the expansion cycles. Parametric studies of single and multi-story RFERS with varying geometries and properties are also presented to investigate the effects of structural stiffness on the displacement of RFERS and the lateral earth pressure developed in the soil mass. These studies can aid the reader in selecting appropriate values of lateral earth pressure for the design of RFERS. Finally, simplified closed form equations {{that can be used to}} predict the lateral drift of RFERS are presented.   KEY WORDS:  Earth Pressure; Soil-Structure Interaction; Mechanics; Failure; Distress; Temperature; Thermal Effects; Concrete; Coefficient of Thermal Expansion; Segmental Bridges; Jointless Bridges; Integral Bridges; Geotechnical Instrumentation; Finite Element Modeling; FEM; Numerical Modelin...|$|E

A connection and a channel through the beam guiding module and the extension module are arranged to each channel for the additive material present in the processing module and the nozzle. A supporting element is arranged at the beam guiding module and/or extension module, and is formed by a rotatably mounted bead, roller or wheel. Nozzles or parts of the nozzle, with which the channels for the additive material are inclined at different angles, are exchangeably fastened at the processing module. The system is movable with the processing module and/or the workpiece relative to each other in two axes. The protective gas is directly guided into the beam guiding module, extension module or the processing module above or below the element focusing the laser beam. The protective gas is guided at the reflecting element in the processing module and through the discharge opening for the laser beam. A two-dimensional cross-table is arranged at the coupling module for the adjustment of the laser beam. The coolant is guided into the processing module through the channel over the beam guiding module for cooling the reflecting element and/or the nozzle.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{examines}} the potential and actual {{role played by}} international investment in pension fund management. The paper draws largely on experience {{of a range of}} OECD countries and selected emerging market economies with established funded pension systems, although we also provide estimates for Trinidad and Tobago, and for Jamaica. It is shown that international investment allows superior investment performance in terms of risk and return, and pension funds are well placed {{to take advantage of the}} benefits, but they typically hold low proportions of foreign assets in their portfolios. Whereas some degree of “home bias ” is likely to occur naturally, it is undesirable for regulations to enforce tighter limits on foreign assets than these market forces would suggest. The arguments favouring regulatory restrictions are weak. The future of funding itself seems likely to be turbulent, given the growing scope of asset flows and the future decumulation when ageing accelerates in OECD countries. These developments do not negate the case for international investment, but they do suggest <b>a</b> need to <b>retain</b> <b>elements</b> of <b>a</b> pay-as-you-go system, as a form of insurance...|$|R
