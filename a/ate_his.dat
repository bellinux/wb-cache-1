5|$|Prometheus– Punished by Zeus {{for giving}} mankind the Fires of Olympus, Prometheus was made mortal, and was {{attacked}} by an eagle that ripped out and <b>ate</b> <b>his</b> liver, which regrew instantly, on a daily basis. Kratos encountered Prometheus near Typhon's lair. Prometheus was eventually freed by Kratos, died by self-immolation in fire, and his ashes empowered Kratos, giving him the ability called the Rage of the Titans. The character was voiced by Alan Oppenheimer in God of War II.|$|E

5|$|Charles Domery (later {{also known}} as Charles Domerz) was born in Benche, Poland, in around 1778. From the age of 13, Domery had an unusually large appetite. He was one of nine brothers, all of whom Domery said {{suffered}} from the same condition. Domery recalled {{that his father was}} a hearty eater and generally <b>ate</b> <b>his</b> meat half-boiled, but was too young to recall the quantity. The only illness Domery was aware of in the family was an outbreak of smallpox in his youth, which was survived by all the family.|$|E
5|$|On Thursday, December 12, 1799, Washington {{spent several}} hours {{inspecting}} his plantation on horseback, in snow, hail, and freezing rain; that evening, he <b>ate</b> <b>his</b> supper without changing from his wet clothes. He awoke {{the next morning}} with a severe sore throat and became increasingly hoarse as the day progressed, yet still rode out in the heavy snow, marking trees for cutting on the plantation. Some time around 3a.m. that Saturday, he suddenly awoke with severe difficulty breathing and almost completely unable to speak or swallow. He was {{a firm believer in}} bloodletting, which was a standard medical practice of that era, and he had used it to treat various ailments of slaves on his plantation. He ordered estate overseer Albin Rawlins to remove nearly a pint of his blood.|$|E

50|$|In 1957, an {{illustrated}} children's book, Come To Eat (בואו לאכול), written by Avigdor Hameiri {{and illustrated by}} Mariam Bartov, was published in Hebrew in Israel. It tells the story about Mother Mambo and Father Sambo {{trying to get their}} little boy Bambo to <b>eat</b> <b>his</b> supper. Only after Bambo watches a series of animals only too happy to <b>eat</b> <b>his</b> food does he learn his lesson and come home to <b>eat</b> <b>his</b> supper. The story contains no racist overtones and reads as any number of stories of mildly rambunctious children.|$|R

In the letter, he urged the Iraqi people to unite, and not to hate the people of countries that invaded Iraq, like the United States, but instead the decision-makers. He said {{he was ready to}} die as a martyr and he said that this is his death sentence. In the hours before the execution, Saddam <b>ate</b> <b>his</b> last meal of chicken and rice with a cup of hot water and honey.|$|E
25|$|Saturn Devouring His Son, a {{disturbing}} {{portrait of the}} titan Saturn consuming one of his children, was one of six works with which Goya decorated the dining room. According to Roman myth (inspired by the original Greek myth), it had been foretold {{that one of the}} sons of Saturn would overthrow him, just as he had overthrown his father, Caelus. To prevent this, Saturn <b>ate</b> <b>his</b> children moments after each was born. His wife Ops eventually hid his third son, Jupiter, on the island of Crete, deceiving Saturn by offering a stone wrapped in swaddling in his place. Jupiter eventually supplanted his father just as the prophecy had predicted.|$|E
25|$|According to the Mahaparinibbana Sutta of the Pali canon, {{at the age}} of 80, the Buddha {{announced}} that he would soon reach Parinirvana, or the final deathless state, and abandon his earthly body. After this, the Buddha <b>ate</b> <b>his</b> last meal, which he had received as an offering from a blacksmith named Cunda. Falling violently ill, Buddha instructed his attendant Ānanda to convince Cunda that the meal eaten at his place {{had nothing to do with}} his passing and that his meal would be a source of the greatest merit as it provided the last meal for a Buddha. Mettanando and von Hinüber argue that the Buddha died of mesenteric infarction, a symptom of old age, rather than food poisoning.|$|E

25|$|Bennett {{moved to}} Calgary in 1897. A lifelong {{bachelor}} and teetotaler (although Bennett was known by select associates to occasionally drink alcohol when {{the press was}} not around to observe this), he led a rather lonely life in a hotel and later, in a boarding house. For a while a younger brother roomed with him. He <b>ate</b> <b>his</b> noon meal on workdays at the Alberta Hotel. Social life, such as it was, centred on church. There was, however, no scandal attached to his personal life. Bennett worked hard and gradually built up his legal practice. In 1908 {{he was one of}} five people appointed to the first Library Board for the city of Calgary and was instrumental in establishing the Calgary Public Library.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the more}} famous cases of Wendigo {{psychosis}} reported involved a Plains Cree trapper from Alberta, named Swift Runner. During the winter of 1878, Swift Runner {{and his family were}} starving, and his eldest son died. Twenty-five miles away from emergency food supplies at a Hudson's Bay Company post, Swift Runner butchered and <b>ate</b> <b>his</b> wife and five remaining children. Given that he resorted to cannibalism so near to food supplies, and that he killed and consumed the remains of all those present, it was revealed that Swift Runner's was not a case of pure cannibalism as a last resort to avoid starvation, but rather of a man with Wendigo psychosis. He eventually confessed and was executed by authorities at Fort Saskatchewan.|$|E
25|$|According to the Rabbis, Saul <b>ate</b> <b>his</b> {{food with}} due {{regard for the}} rules of {{ceremonial}} purity prescribed for the sacrifice (Yalq., l.c.), and taught the people how they should slay cattle (cf 1 Samuel 14:34). As a reward for this, God himself gave Saul a sword {{on the day of}} battle, since no other sword suitable for him was found (ibid 13:22). Saul's attitude toward David finds its excuse in the fact that his courtiers were all tale-bearers, and slandered David to him (Deut. Rashi 5:10); and in like manner he was incited by Doeg against the priests of Nob (1 Samuel 22:16–19; Yalq., Sam. 131)—this act was forgiven him, however, and a heavenly voice (bat qol) was heard, proclaiming: Saul is the chosen one of God (Ber. 12b). His anger at the Gibeonites (2 Samuel 21:2) was not personal hatred, but was induced by zeal for the welfare of Israel (Num. Rashi 8:4). The fact that he made his daughter remarry (1 Samuel 25:44), finds its explanation in his (Saul's) view that her betrothal to David had been gained by false pretenses, and was therefore invalid (Sanhedrin 19b). During the lifetime of Saul there was no idolatry in Israel. The famine in the reign of David (cf 2 Samuel 21:1) was to punish the people, because they had not accorded Saul the proper honours at his burial (Num. Rashi 8:4). In Sheol, Samuel reveals to Saul that in the next world, Saul would dwell with Samuel, which is a proof that all has been forgiven him by God ('Er. 53ba).|$|E

[...] "He <b>ate</b> <b>his</b> food {{and left to}} sleep at the shop since he had a class XII {{compartment}} exam in English {{to take the next}} day. Unlike other days, next morning, he did not show up." [...] The following day Babli's uncle arrived to speak with Manoj. According to Chanderpati, [...] "He said he had come to recover some money that Manoj had borrowed, had tea and left when I told him that Manoj was away for an exam. We only discovered late in the evening that Babli, too, was missing and the two had run away." [...] Manoj had eloped with Babli to Chandigarh and married her on 7 April at a Durga temple, their commitment to one another transcending their willingness to abide by the societal norms.|$|E
500|$|After Kamo {{was arrested}} in Berlin and {{awaiting}} trial, he received a note from Krasin through his lawyer Oscar Kohn telling him to feign insanity {{so that he would}} be declared unfit to stand trial. To demonstrate his insanity, he refused food, tore his clothes, tore out his hair, attempted to hang himself, slashed his wrists, and <b>ate</b> <b>his</b> own excrement. To make sure that he was not faking his condition, German doctors stuck pins under his nails, struck him in the back with a long needle, and burned him with hot irons, but he did not break his act. After all of these tests, the chief doctor of the Berlin asylum wrote in June 1909 that [...] "there is no foundation to the belief that [...] is feigning insanity. [...] He is without doubt mentally ill, is incapable of appearing before a court, or of serving sentence. It is extremely doubtful that he can completely recover." ...|$|E
500|$|The first {{published}} mention {{of them was}} by George Borrow in his book Wild Wales, written in the 1850s and published in the next decade. He described them as [...] "not a whit inferior to those of Epping"; Epping sausages were skinless meat-based sausages. Borrow visited Y Gwter Fawr (now known as Brynamman); the Tregib Arms has been suggested as the location at which Borrow <b>ate</b> <b>his</b> sausages. Advertisements promoting the sale of Glamorgan sausages in the British Newspaper Archive begin to appear from 1869 onwards, with the first advert placed by pork butcher Henry S. Morgan of 288 Bute Street, Cardiff, placed in the Western Mail on 15 December. Morgan continued to advertise {{over the next several}} years, and by 1874 was claiming that the demand necessitated making the sausages on an hourly basis, and referenced other makers of the sausages making theirs days in advance prior to sale. The advert makes it clear that the sausages were made from [...] "choice dairy-fed pork".|$|E

500|$|Brassica was {{considered}} by some Romans a table luxury, [...] although Lucullus considered it unfit for the senatorial table. The more traditionalist Cato the Elder, espousing a simple, Republican life, <b>ate</b> <b>his</b> cabbage cooked or raw and dressed with vinegar; he said it surpassed all other vegetables, and approvingly distinguished three varieties; he also gave directions for its medicinal use, which extended to the cabbage-eater's urine, in which infants might be rinsed. Pliny the Elder listed seven varieties, including Pompeii cabbage, Cumae cabbage and Sabellian cabbage. According to Pliny, the Pompeii cabbage, which could not stand cold, is [...] "taller, and has a thick stock near the root, but grows thicker between the leaves, these being scantier and narrower, but their tenderness is a valuable quality". The Pompeii cabbage was also mentioned by Columella in De Re Rustica. Apicius gives several recipes for cauliculi, tender cabbage shoots. The Greeks and Romans claimed medicinal usages for their cabbage varieties that included relief from gout, headaches and the symptoms of poisonous mushroom ingestion. [...] The antipathy towards the vine made it seem that eating cabbage would avoid drunkenness. Cabbage continued to figure in the materia medica of antiquity {{as well as at}} table: in the first century AD Dioscorides mentions two kinds of coleworts with medical uses, the cultivated and the wild, and his opinions continued to be paraphrased in herbals right through the 17th century.|$|E
