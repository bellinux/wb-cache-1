5|$|The District {{is known}} for its medical {{research}} institutions such <b>as</b> <b>Washington</b> Hospital Center and the Children's National Medical Center, as well as the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. In addition, the city is home to three medical schools and associated teaching hospitals at George Washington, Georgetown, and Howard universities.|$|E
5|$|The {{first six}} seasons {{of the show}} were mostly based in Los Angeles and nearby California {{locations}}—both real and fictional. Other locations have also been featured, such <b>as</b> <b>Washington,</b> D.C., for parts of the fourth, sixth, and seventh seasons. The eighth season took place in New York City, and the TV film Redemption, filmed in South Africa, was set mainly in the fictional African nation of Sangala.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season, Tyler {{started at}} fullback {{for the first}} time in a game against Oregon State, winless at the time, and rushed for 151 yards, including a 55-yard fourth-quarter touchdown, to lead the Huskies to a 20–14 victory. In the team's next game, the back scored twice <b>as</b> <b>Washington</b> beat twelfth-ranked Arizona State. The Huskies finished with seven wins and four losses, missing a bowl game. Tyler averaged 5.5 yards a carry in the 1978 season.|$|E

5|$|After {{a year in}} San Diego, Washington {{was traded}} again. Levin decided to acquire Portland center Bill Walton even though Walton had missed the entire 1978–79 season due to broken bones in his foot. Since the Blazers and Clippers could not agree on compensation, the commissioner's office made the final decision, sending Washington, Kunnert and Randy Smith to Portland in {{exchange}} for the center. This became the second time he had been traded along with Kunnert. The center signed with Boston before the 1978–79 season even though Washington was on the team because the Celtics offered him the most money. There remained a mostly quiet discord between the two <b>as</b> <b>Washington</b> felt Kunnert never properly acknowledged his role in the fight.|$|E
5|$|Artillery, supplies, {{and troops}} were all being {{evacuated}} {{across the river}} at this time {{but it was not}} going as fast <b>as</b> <b>Washington</b> had anticipated and daybreak soon came. A fog settled in and concealed the evacuation from the British. British patrols noticed that there {{did not seem to be}} any American pickets and thus began to search the area. While they were doing this, Washington, the last man left, stepped onto the last boat. At 07:00, the last American troops landed in Manhattan. All 9,000 troops had been evacuated with no loss of life.|$|E
5|$|Despite its stated {{commitment}} to providing politically balanced programming, C-SPAN and its shows such <b>as</b> <b>Washington</b> Journal, Booknotes, Q & A, and After Words {{have been accused}} by some liberal organizations of having a conservative bias. In 2005, the media criticism organization Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR) released a study of C-SPAN's morning telephone call-in show Washington Journal, showing that Republicans were favored as guests over Democrats by a two-to-one margin during a six-month period that year, and that people of color are underrepresented. A 2007 survey released by the Center for Economic and Policy Research reported that C-SPAN covered conservative think tanks more than left-of-center think tanks.|$|E

5|$|Game 1 {{was held}} in Washington, where Capitals owner Ted Leonsis took steps to prevent Penguins' fans from {{purchasing}} tickets, such as not selling tickets to customers whose 724 or 412 area code indicated they were from Western Pennsylvania. Crosby scored to give the Penguins a first period lead, but Washington scored two goals before {{the conclusion of the}} period. Mark Eaton tied the game in the second period, but Washington's Semyon Varlamov held the Penguins scoreless {{for the remainder of the}} game as the Capitals took a 1–0 lead in the series. The game had 40%more viewers than playoff games the previous season. In Game 2, Ovechkin and Crosby scored three goals each, though Dave Steckel's second period goal was the difference <b>as</b> <b>Washington</b> won 4–3.|$|E
5|$|Huletts Landing is {{a remote}} hamlet, {{accessible}} by car only via Washington County Route 6, which branches off of nearby New York State Route 22. The main road {{is known as}} Huletts Landing Road, and spawns two suffixed routes which reach different parts of Huletts Landing. The first is County Route 6A, which is better known as Lands End Road, heads southward while the other, County Route 6B, which is better known as Bluff Head Road, brings the traveler northward, to locations such <b>as</b> <b>Washington</b> County Park and Huletts Landing Marina. Huletts Landing County Park is also on CR 6B.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, {{they moved}} to St. Louis, Missouri, <b>as</b> <b>Washington</b> University offered both Carl and Gerty positions, {{although}} Gerty's rank and salary were much lower than her husband's. Despite her research background, Gerty was only offered a position as a research associate at a salary one tenth of that received by her husband; she was warned that she might harm her husband's career. Washington University's Chancellor, Arthur Holley Compton made a special allowance for Gerty {{to hold a position}} there, going against the university's nepotism rules. Gerty had to wait thirteen years before she attained the same rank as her husband. In 1943, she was made an associate professor of Research Biological Chemistry and Pharmacology. Months before she won the Nobel Prize, she was promoted to full professor, a post she held until her death in 1957.|$|E

5|$|In February 1799, Adams {{surprised}} many {{by sending}} diplomat William Vans Murray on a peace mission to France. Napoleon, {{realizing that the}} conflict was pointless, signaled his readiness for friendly relations. At the Convention of 1800, the two sides agreed to return any captured ships and {{to allow for the}} peaceful transfer of non-military goods to an enemy of the nation. The Treaty of Alliance of 1778 was superseded and the United States was then free of foreign entanglements, <b>as</b> <b>Washington</b> had advised in his farewell address. Adams brought in John Marshall as Secretary of State and demobilized the emergency army. Adams proudly avoided war, but deeply split his party in the process.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the three television networks, C-SPAN also broadcasts via C-SPAN Radio, which is carried on their owned-and-operated station WCSP (90.1 FM) in the Washington, D.C. area with all three cable network feeds airing via HD Radio subchannels, and nationwide on XM Satellite Radio. Its programming is also livestreamed at c-span.org and is available via apps for iPhone, BlackBerry and Android devices. C-SPAN Radio has a selective policy regarding its broadcast content, rather than duplicating the television network programming, although it does offer some audio simulcasts of programs such <b>as</b> <b>Washington</b> Journal. Unique programming on the radio station includes oral histories, and some committee meetings and press conferences not shown on television due to programming commitments. The station also compiles the Sunday morning talk shows for a same-day rebroadcast without commercials, in rapid succession.|$|E
5|$|Phillips {{writes that}} McKinley's low rating is undeserved, {{and that he}} should be ranked just after the great presidents such <b>as</b> <b>Washington</b> and Lincoln. He pointed to McKinley's success at {{building}} an electoral coalition that kept the Republicans mostly in power for a generation. Phillips believes that part of McKinley's legacy is the men he included in his administration, who dominated the Republican Party for a quarter century after his death. These officials included Cortelyou, who served in three Cabinet positions under Roosevelt, and Dawes, who became vice president under Coolidge. Other McKinley appointees who later became major figures include Day, who Roosevelt elevated to the Supreme Court where he remained nearly twenty years, and William Howard Taft, whom McKinley had made Governor-General of the Philippines and who succeeded Roosevelt as president.|$|E

5|$|Pillars and columns, such <b>as</b> <b>Washington</b> Column and Lost Arrow, {{are created}} by cross joints. Erosion acting on master joints is {{responsible}} for creating valleys and later canyons. The single most erosive force {{over the last few}} million years has been large alpine glaciers, which have turned the previously V-shaped river-cut valleys into U-shaped glacial-cut canyons (such as Yosemite Valley and Hetch Hetchy Valley). Exfoliation (caused by the tendency of crystals in plutonic rocks to expand at the surface) acting on granitic rock with widely spaced joints is responsible for creating domes such as Half Dome and North Dome and inset arches like Royal Arches.|$|E
5|$|SR78 runs {{concurrently}} with SR79 {{across the}} headwaters of the San Diego River and through the hamlet of Wynola, briefly entering Cleveland National Forest before reaching Julian and entering the town <b>as</b> <b>Washington</b> Street. The route, still concurrent with SR79, turns east onto Main Street and travels through downtown Julian before SR79 diverges south towards Cuyamaca and SR 78 heads northeast as Banner Road. The road intersects with County Route S2 (CRS2) at a junction called Scissors Crossing; CRS2 runs concurrently in a wrong-way concurrency. Shortly afterwards, SR78 enters Anza-Borrego Desert State Park and is designated as a scenic highway for its length in the state park. Although this route travels many miles south of the town of Borrego Springs, it provides access to the town via CR S3. SR 78 travels through the town of Ocotillo Wells before exiting the state park and entering Imperial County.|$|E
5|$|The {{visit was}} {{the high point of}} {{relations}} between Diệm and Washington, as in later years, the US government and members of the AFV became increasingly disillusioned with Diệm's failure to liberalize his government and enact changes to make South Vietnam more democratic. The once-supportive media began to report on South Vietnam without overlooking problems in Diệm's administration. In 1963, American support for Diệm collapsed during the Buddhist crisis <b>as</b> <b>Washington</b> concluded that Diệm was incapable of offering a solid alternative to the communists, and he was overthrown in a US-backed military coup and executed after being captured.|$|E

5|$|Letitia Woods Brown (October 24, 1915 – August 3, 1976) was an African American {{researcher}} and historian. Earning a master's degree in 1935 from Ohio State University and a Ph.D. in 1966 from Harvard University, {{she served as}} a {{researcher and}} historian for over four decades {{and became one of}} the first black woman to earn a PhD from Harvard University in history. As a teacher, she started her career in Macon County, Alabama between 1935 and 1936. Later in 1937, she became Tuskegee Institute's instructor in history but left in 1940. Between 1940 and 1945 she worked at LeMoyne-Owen College in Memphis, Tennessee as a tutor. From 1968 to 1971, she served as a Fulbright lecturer at Monash University and Australia National University followed by a period in 1971 working as a consultant at the Federal Executive Institute. Between 1971 and 1976 she served as a history professor in the African-American faculty of George Washington University and became the first full-time black member. She also served as a primary consultant for the Schlesinger Library’s Black Women Oral History project during the course of her professional career. Aside from teaching history, Brown wrote and contributed to books on Washington DC such <b>as</b> <b>Washington</b> from Banneker to Douglas, 1791 – 1870 and Washington in the New Era, 1870 – 1970.|$|E
5|$|MD32 {{heads into}} a forested area and crosses the Morgan Run arm of Liberty Reservoir. The state highway passes through an S-curve before heading through the {{communities}} of Louisville and Gamber, where the highway meets {{the southern end of}} MD91 (Gamber Road). MD32 continues northwest through a mix of farmland and residential subdivisions toward Fenby, where the highway intersects MD97 (New Washington Road). Just north of MD97 adjacent to Carroll Community College, the state highway meets MD97's old alignment, Old Washington Road, which is unsigned MD854B. MD32 continues north <b>as</b> <b>Washington</b> Road through a suburban area; the highway parallels MD97 and passes to the east of the historic Friendship Valley Farm and Carroll County Almshouse and Farm, which is now the Carroll County Farm Museum. Just north of Bennett Avenue, MD32 reaches its northern terminus at the southern city limit of Westminster. The roadway continues north as a municipal street to Main Street, which heads northwest through the Westminster Historic District.|$|E
5|$|Näslund {{subsequently}} {{joined the}} Penguins for the 1993–94 season. Due to teammate Bryan Trottier already wearing his Modo jersey number, 19, he chose number 29 instead. He {{appeared in his}} first NHL game on 5 October 1993 against the Philadelphia Flyers. Five days later, he registered his first NHL point, an assist, during {{a game against the}} Quebec Nordiques. His first NHL goal came the following month on 9 November 1993 in a 3–3 tie against the St. Louis Blues. The goal came in the first period on the powerplay against goaltender Curtis Joseph, assisted by Doug Brown and Marty McSorley. Upon entering the NHL, Näslund struggled and was admittedly frustrated with himself. As a result, he was demoted to the Penguins' International Hockey League (IHL) affiliate, the Cleveland Lumberjacks, on several occasions. He finished his rookie campaign with four goals and seven assists in 71games. Although the Penguins qualified for the 1994 playoffs, Näslund did not participate in post-season play, being made a healthy scratch (non-dressing player), and watched <b>as</b> <b>Washington</b> eliminated Pittsburgh in the first round.|$|E
