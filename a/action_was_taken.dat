5|$|Christian's group {{remained}} undiscovered on Pitcairn until 1808, {{by which}} time only one mutineer, John Adams, remained alive. Almost all his fellow mutineers (including Christian), and their male Polynesian companions, had killed each other over time in varying conflicts. The only survivors of these conflicts were Adams and Ned Young, who had subsequently died of asthma in 1800. No <b>action</b> <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> against Adams.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the fight}} at UFC 92, Jackson drew {{criticism}} from Todd Martin of CBS Sports for ignoring referee Yves Lavigne's attempt {{to stop the}} contest. Martin compared Jackson's actions to Renato Sobral's continued choke of David Heath following a tap out, which led to Sobral's dismissal from the UFC. Martin called for punishment against Jackson, but no <b>action</b> <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> against Jackson for this allegedly unsportsmanlike behavior.|$|E
5|$|For a time, no overt <b>action</b> <b>was</b> <b>taken,</b> and {{the plans}} {{continued}} to evolve. A further refinement {{of the plan}} was developed by William and McGeorge Bundy on 29 November 1964, with a more moderate target list, which the Joint Chiefs opposed. No <b>action</b> <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> while these, and other, plans were considered. But matters {{came to a head}} with the attack on Camp Holloway on 7 February 1965, which demanded immediate action, and resulted in a reprisal raid known as Operation Flaming Dart. A sapper raid against an American enlisted men's billet at Qui Nhon on the 10th led to Flaming Dart II. These small-scale operations were launched against the southern region of the country, where the bulk of North Vietnam's ground forces and supply dumps were located.|$|E

5|$|In 1812, Jonathan Jennings {{defeated}} Harrison's chosen {{candidate and}} became the territory's representative to Congress. Jennings immediately introduced legislation to grant Indiana statehood, even though {{the population of the}} entire territory was under 25,000, but no <b>action</b> <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> on the legislation because of the outbreak of the War of 1812.|$|E
5|$|In the film, Koskov and Whitaker {{repeatedly}} use {{vehicles and}} drug packets {{marked with the}} Red Cross. This action angered a number of Red Cross Societies, which sent letters of protest regarding the film. In addition, the British Red Cross attempted to prosecute the filmmakers and distributors. However, no legal <b>action</b> <b>was</b> <b>taken.</b> As a result, a disclaimer was added {{at the start of}} the film and some DVD releases.|$|E
5|$|No {{management}} <b>action</b> <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> {{until the}} late 1980s and early 1990s, when after years of flourishing population, the island's carrying capacity was exceeded. Malnourishment caused by overcrowding resulted {{in the deaths of}} several horses; the reserve's staff instituted a birth control program to restrict the herd to about 40animals.|$|E

When a rule's <b>action</b> <b>is</b> <b>taken,</b> we say that the rule [...] "fired." [...] Note that the <b>action</b> <b>is</b> conditional: the <b>action</b> <b>is</b> <b>taken</b> only when the rule is selected and its premise is true.|$|R

5|$|The {{night of}} 30 to 31 January was quieter in Cairo, with fewer reports of looting. For {{the fourth day}} in a row the curfew was {{violated}} without repercussions. Security officials had announced that the curfew would start at 3:00pm and threatened to shoot anyone who ignored it, although eventually little or no <b>action</b> <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> as security and army personnel left Tahrir Square.|$|E
5|$|Tyler's {{governorship}} {{was otherwise}} uneventful. He promoted states' rights and adamantly opposed any concentration of federal power. In order to thwart federal infrastructure proposals, he suggested Virginia actively expand its own road system. A proposal {{was made to}} expand the state's poorly funded public school system, but no significant <b>action</b> <b>was</b> <b>taken.</b> Tyler was re-elected unanimously to a second one-year term in December 1826.|$|E
5|$|A notable {{atmospheric}} {{release of}} radioactive gas followed the Soviet Chagan test of 15 January 1965 in present-day Kazakhstan. Roughly 20% of the radioactive debris {{produced by the}} 140-kiloton detonation was released into the atmosphere, with some fallout occurring over Japan. The US complained to Moscow, but no subsequent <b>action</b> <b>was</b> <b>taken.</b> On 25 April 1966, the Pin Stripe underground test in Nevada (part of Operation Flintlock) experienced a venting malfunction and produced a radioactive plume headed towards the Midwestern US; the AEC determined that the test did not threaten human health.|$|E

5|$|<b>Action</b> <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> against Landy's {{professional}} {{practice as a}} result of the Beach Boys' and Wilson family's struggles for control. A former nurse and girlfriend of Wilson's brought Landy to the state's attention in 1984, and they were then aided by journals written by songwriter Gary Usher during a ten-month collaboration with Wilson. These journals depicted Wilson as a virtual captive dominated by Landy, who was determined to fulfill his show business ambitions through Wilson. By this time, Wilson had become Landy's only patient.|$|E
5|$|After {{his release}} from prison in 2010, Chen was placed under house arrest against Chinese law, and was closely {{monitored}} by security forces. Legally, he was proclaimed {{by the government to}} be a free man, but in reality the local government offered no explanation for the hundreds of unidentified agents monitoring his house and preventing visitors or escape. The national propaganda organ, the Global Times, expressed confusion over the issue, and suggested that the local government may not know how to handle it, but no disciplinary <b>action</b> <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> at the national level.|$|E
5|$|During 1895, Robert S. Hatcher, {{the reading}} clerk of the Indiana Senate, was {{directed}} to ascertain {{the legal status of}} the design of the state seal. After a thorough review, Hatcher found that the laws that authorized the seal did not explicitly state what its design should be. He recommended that a bill be passed to standardize the seal. Senator McCord submitted legislation for that purpose, but no <b>action</b> <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> on it.|$|E

5|$|In 1812, Jonathan Jennings {{defeated}} Harrison's chosen {{candidate and}} became the territory's representative to Congress. Jennings used his position there to attempt to speed up Indiana's path to statehood by immediately introducing legislation to grant Indiana statehood, even though {{the population of the}} entire territory was under 25,000. Jennings did this against the wishes of incoming governor Thomas Posey, and there was noted disagreement between the two men on the subject. No <b>action</b> <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> on the legislation at the time, though, because of the outbreak of the War of 1812.|$|E
5|$|In 1894, the {{peninsula}} was visited by the Russian Minister of Finance, who became {{convinced of the}} region's economic potential. Consequently, in 1896 a telephone and a telegraph line were extended to Kola, improving the communication with the mainland. A possibility of building a railway was also considered, but no <b>action</b> <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> at the time. Also in 1896, Alexandrovsk (now Polyarny) was founded, and grew in size so rapidly that it was granted town status in 1899; Kolsky Uyezd was renamed Alexandrovsky on that occasion.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, wildcat <b>action</b> <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> by {{union members}} over a {{decision}} by Gate Gourmet not to renew the contracts of 670 workers {{and replace them with}} agency staff; it is estimated that the strike cost British Airways £30million and caused disruption to 100,000 passengers. In October 2006, BA became involved in a civil rights dispute when a Christian employee was forbidden to wear a necklace bearing the cross, a religious symbol. BA's practice of forbidding such symbols has been publicly questioned by British politicians such as the former Home Secretary John Reid and the former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw.|$|E
50|$|The {{free rider}} {{problem is that}} there may <b>be</b> <b>actions</b> that would benefit a large group of people, but once the <b>action</b> <b>is</b> <b>taken,</b> there <b>is</b> no way to exclude those who did not pay for the action from the benefits. This leads to a game theoretic problem: all members of a group might be better off if an <b>action</b> <b>were</b> <b>taken,</b> {{and the members of the}} group contributed to the cost of the action, but many members of the group may make the {{perfectly}} rational decision to let others pay for it, then reap the benefits for free, possibly with the result that no <b>action</b> <b>is</b> <b>taken.</b> The result of this rational game play is lower utility for everyone.|$|R
