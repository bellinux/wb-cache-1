5|$|An {{airport at}} Lakselv was first {{proposed}} out of military considerations. Despite a Norwegian neutrality policy, there was <b>a</b> <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> Norway could be occupied by foreign powers {{to take advantage}} of the country's strategic position. The military therefore wanted to construct airfields throughout the country to increase the air force's mobility. Especially Finnmark was regarded as a key location, given the increased Soviet militarization on the Kola Peninsula. Increased military funding was granted from 1937, and the following year, a triangular runway was built at Banak.|$|E
5|$|In June 1886, Holmes {{received}} an honorary degree from Yale University Law School. His wife {{of more than}} forty years, who had struggled with an illness that had kept her an invalid for months, died on February 6, 1888. The younger Amelia died the following year after a brief malady. Despite his weakening eyesight and <b>a</b> <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> he was becoming antiquated, Holmes continued to find solace in writing. He published Over the Teacups, {{the last of his}} table-talk books, in 1891.|$|E
5|$|In times past, bright comets often {{inspired}} {{panic and}} hysteria {{in the general}} population, being thought of as bad omens. More recently, during the passage of Halley's Comet in 1910, the Earth passed through the comet's tail, and erroneous newspaper reports inspired <b>a</b> <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> cyanogen in the tail might poison millions, whereas the appearance of Comet Hale–Bopp in 1997 triggered the mass suicide of the Heaven's Gate cult.|$|E

5|$|Raëlians {{say they}} {{encourage}} adult homosexual, bisexual, and heterosexual relationships and that society should recognize them legally. Some Swiss government authorities responded to Raëlians' views about Sensual Meditation with <b>a</b> <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> Raëlians {{are a threat}} to public morals for supporting liberalized sex education for children. They express the view that such liberalized sex education teaches youngsters how to obtain sexual gratification which would encourage sexual abuse of underage children.|$|E

5|$|The work proved dangerous. By {{the end of}} the war, {{half the}} {{experienced}} chemists and metallurgists had to be removed from work with plutonium when unacceptably high levels of the element appeared in their urine. A minor fire at Los Alamos in January 1945 led to <b>a</b> <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> a fire in the plutonium laboratory might contaminate the whole town, and Groves authorized {{the construction of a new}} facility for plutonium chemistry and metallurgy, which became known as the DP-site. The hemispheres for the first plutonium pit (or core) were produced and delivered on 2 July 1945. Three more hemispheres followed on 23 July and were delivered three days later.|$|E

60|$|I {{would have}} sent it long ago. But I must explain. I brought home with me from my bad times in America two strains of {{unsoundness}} of mind, the first, <b>a</b> perpetual <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> I can do no more work--the second, <b>a</b> perpetual <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> my friends have quarrelled with me.[43] This last long silence of yours drove me into really believing it, and I dared not write to you.|$|R

5|$|At {{a meeting}} of the S-1 Executive Committee on 14 November 1942, Chadwick had {{expressed}} <b>a</b> <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> the alpha particles emitted by plutonium could produce neutrons in light elements present as impurities, which in turn would produce fission in the plutonium and cause a predetonation, a chain reaction before the core was fully assembled. This had been considered by Oppenheimer and Seaborg the month before, and the latter had calculated that neutron emitters like boron had to be restricted to one part in a hundred billion. There was some doubt about whether a chemical process could be developed that could ensure this level of purity, and Chadwick brought the matter to the S-1 Executive Committee's attention for it to be considered further. Four days later, though, Lawrence, Oppenheimer, Compton and McMillan reported to Conant that they had confidence that the exacting purity requirement could be met.|$|E
5|$|Much of the Turkish Cypriot {{migration}} to the UK occurred {{as a consequence of}} intercommunal violence in Cyprus during the 1950s and 1960s. Many Turkish Cypriots viewed the EOKA insurgency as an attempt on the part of Greek Cypriots to establish hegemony on the island with the aim of achieving union with Greece. By 1958, there were around 8,500 Turkish Cypriots in Britain. Between 1960 and 1962, the inflow increased substantially because of <b>a</b> <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> Britain would impose immigration controls, and indeed the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962 did reduce migration flows from Cyprus to Britain. Although the expansion of Britain's Turkish Cypriot community took place primarily between the late 1940s and the mid-1960s, there was a further influx of around 3,000 immigrants after partition in 1974. Migration continued because of the political and economic situation in the 1970s and 1980s, and Turkish Cypriots have continued to migrate to the UK due to high unemployment rates in northern Cyprus. In the early 1980s, it was estimated that 160,000 Cypriots were resident in the UK, 20 to 25 per cent of them being Turkish Cypriots. Since Cyprus joined the European Union in May 2004, holders of Republic of Cyprus passports have been able to migrate freely to the UK under EU law.|$|E

25|$|Among {{the causes}} for the Turkish {{campaign}} against the Greek-speaking christian population was <b>a</b> <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> they would aid the Ottoman Empire's enemies, and a belief among some Turks that to form a modern nation state {{it was necessary to}} purge from the territories of the state those national groups who could threaten the integrity of a modern Turkish nation state.|$|E
25|$|After the FTA was signed, {{there were}} {{initially}} {{concerns that the}} American agricultural sector would lobby against the agreement, due to <b>a</b> <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> it could interfere with the government's farm subsidies program. However, the agreement, with time limits on importation of Australian agricultural products such as beef and sugar cane managed to allay {{the concerns of the}} American agricultural market (while greatly frustrating many Australian producers).|$|E
25|$|At the 1911 {{meeting of}} the Institute of International Law in Madrid, {{legislation}} was proposed to limit the use of airplanes to reconnaissance missions and banning them from being used as platforms for weapons. This legislation was rooted in <b>a</b> <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> airplanes {{would be used to}} attack undefended cities, violating Article 69 of the Den Hague Reglement (the set of international laws governing warfare).|$|E

25|$|When a coin is in use {{as money}} and the {{intrinsic}} value becomes greater than the face value, these coins {{are in danger of}} being removed from circulation in large numbers (an expression of Gresham's law). When copper prices skyrocketed in the mid-to-late 1970s, there was <b>a</b> <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> the U.S. one-cent piece might succumb to this fate, leading the Mint to change the composition of the cent in 1982.|$|E
25|$|The reform {{movement}} turned {{its back on}} the perceived corruption and decadence of cosmopolitan Istanbul and its Ottoman heritage, as well as electing to choose a capital more geographically centered in Turkey. During the disastrous 1912–13 First Balkan War, Bulgarian troops had advanced to Çatalca, mere miles from Istanbul, creating <b>a</b> <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> the Ottoman capital {{would have to be}} moved to Anatolia; the {{reform movement}} wanted to avoid a similar incident with Turkey.|$|E
25|$|A 2014 {{annual survey}} by the Entertainment Software Association showed that nearly as many women played video games (48%) as men, and this broader {{audience}} began to question some assumptions and tropes that had been common in games.
