5|$|Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote a {{concurrence}} that <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{finding that}} the state court's decision was reasonable.

5|$|British {{officials}} asked President Wilson for his consent on {{the matter}} on two occasions – first on 3 September, when he replied the time was not ripe, and later on 6 October, when he <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> release of the declaration.|$|E

50|$|The Luganda {{system of}} {{cardinal}} numbers is quite complicated. The numbers 'one' to 'five' are specialised numerical adjectives that <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> noun they qualify.

5|$|In 1892, the Interstate Commerce Commission <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{city after}} it filed a {{complaint}} about these practices, but that decision was struck down by a federal court. In 1906, Spokane sued under the newly passed Hepburn Act, and won on July 24, 1911.|$|E

5|$|A {{full-size}} {{reproduction of}} September Morn was {{displayed in a}} window of Jackson and Semmelmeyer, a photography shop in Chicago, Illinois, in March 1913. A passing police officer noticed the print and on grounds that it was indecent, insisted it be taken down. The mayor of the city, Carter Harrison, Jr., <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> policeman's decision, and deemed that the image could be sold, but should not be displayed in public as children could see it. Fred Jackson, the owner, was charged with indecency, and at his request the case was brought to trial on March 18.|$|E

5|$|Along with Oppenheimer, Compton, and Ernest Lawrence, Fermi {{was part}} of the {{scientific}} panel that advised the Interim Committee on target selection. The panel <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> committee that atomic bombs would be used without warning against an industrial target. Like others at the Los Alamos Laboratory, Fermi found out about the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki from the public address system in the technical area. Fermi did not believe that atomic bombs would deter nations from starting wars, nor did he think that the time was ripe for world government. He therefore did not join the Association of Los Alamos Scientists.|$|E

Most residents of Islamabad agree that the raid restored local peace, despite fears of retaliation.|$|E
5|$|Cramer v. United States (1923) {{involved}} would-be Indian reservations (as {{provided for}} in the aforementioned unratified treaties) that had subsequently been granted to railroads by the federal government. The United States District Court for the Northern District of California canceled the railroad's land patents based upon the actual use and occupation of the Indians since 1855.

5|$|Foliot was a {{canon of}} Lincoln Cathedral by 1147, and an {{official}} of Alexander of Lincoln, the Bishop of Lincoln, who secured Foliot's early promotions in the church. Foliot {{was sent to the}} Council of Reims in 1148 by the Lincoln cathedral chapter to learn Pope Eugene III's wishes regarding the vacant bishopric, as Alexander had died in February 1148. Henry of Blois, the Bishop of Winchester, was attempting to secure Lincoln for one of his nephews, but the pope <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> chapter and appointed Robert de Chesney as bishop instead. After his consecration, Chesney continued to employ Foliot as a clerk.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, the Court held that, {{due to the}} Eleventh Amendment, {{federal courts}} could not {{exercise}} ancillary jurisdiction over cross-claims by counties against states. Although only two other justices <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> entirety of Justice Powell's majority opinion, Brennan and Marshall agreed with Parts I-IV and VI (the Oneida's claims against the counties) and Burger, White, and Rehnquist agreed with Part V (the counties claims against the state), thus forging separate majorities.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, the NBA <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> National Basketball Players' Association {{to limit}} drafts to two rounds, an {{arrangement}} that has remained the same up the present time.

Teams can also trade their picks, which means that in some drafts teams may have {{more or less than}} two draft picks, although they must have at least one first-round pick every other year.|$|E
