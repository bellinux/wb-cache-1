Because nuclear factor-B (NF-B) regulates several genes associated with inflammation, proliferation, carcinogenesis, and apoptosis, we postulated that embelin might mediate its activity through modulation of NF-B activation. We found that embelin inhibited tumor ne-crosis factor (TNF) -induced NF-B activation. Both inducible and constitutive NF-B activation were abrogated by embelin.

40|$|SummaryHuman {{norovirus}} (NoV) is a {{major cause}} of acute gastroenteritis in closed settings such as hospitals, hotels and cruise ships. The virus survives on inanimate surfaces for extended periods of time, and environmental contamination has been implicated in its transmission. The disinfection of contaminated areas is important in controlling the spread of NoV infections. Neutral solutions of electrochemically activated (ECA) -anolyte {{have been shown to be}} powerful disinfectants against a broad range of bacterial pathogens. The <b>active</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>ingredient</b> is hypochlorous acid (HOCl), which is registered as an approved food contact surface sanitizer in the United States by the Environmental Protection Agency, pursuant to 40 CFR 180. 940. We evaluated the antiviral activity of Ecasol (an ECA-anolyte) against feline calicivirus (FCV), a surrogate of NoV. FCV dried on plastic surfaces was exposed to Ecasol for 1, 2, or 5 min. After exposure to Ecasol, the virus titers were compared with untreated controls to determine the virus inactivation efficacy after different contact times. Ecasol was found to decrease the FCV titer by > 5 log 10 within 1 min of contact, indicating its suitability for inactivation of NoV on surfaces...|$|R
50|$|The idea of {{directly}} delivering medication {{into the}} lungs {{was based on}} ancient traditional cures that involved the use of aromatic and medicinal vapours. These did not involve any special devices beyond the apparatus used for burning or heating to produce fumes. Early inhalation devices included one devised by John Mudge in 1778. It had a pewter mug with a hole allowing attachment of a flexible tube. Mudge used it {{for the treatment of}} coughs using opium. These devices evolved with modifications by Wolfe, Mackenzie (1872) and better mouth attachments such as by Beigel in 1866. Many of these early inhalers needed heat to vapourize the <b>active</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>ingredient.</b> The benefits of forced expiration and inspiration to treat asthma were noted by J. S. Monell in 1865. Chemicals used in inhalers included ammonia, chlorine, iodine, tar, balsams, turpentine camphor and numerous others in combinations. Julius Mount Bleyer used a variation in 1890 in New York.In 1968, Robert Wexler of Abbott Laboratories developed the Analgizer, a disposable inhaler that allowed the self-administration of methoxyflurane vapor in air for analgesia. The Analgizer consisted of a polyethylene cylinder 5 inches long and 1 inch in diameter with a 1 inch long mouthpiece.

Materials and Methods: A single blinded cross-over study was conducted among 30 participants in the age group of 18 - 25 years. The mouthwash samples for the study were previously labeled assigning the letters: A (0. 25 % of green tea catechin mouthwash) and B (0. 12 % of chlorhexidine mouthwash). The study subjects were randomly divided into two groups of 15 each and the study was divided into two phases. In phase I, the mouthwash A was given to one group and other group was given mouthwash B. After a 15 day washout period, in phase II, both groups were given other mouthwash. At the end of each phase of 1 week, plaque score was recorded by using Turesky modification of the Quigley-Hein plaque index. Results: The plaque scores were compared and the difference between the green tea catechin and chlorhexidine mouthwash was determined by t-test. The difference between plaque scores were not statistically significant (P > 0. 05). The results showed that both the groups that is green tea catechin mouthwash (0. 25 %) and chlorhexidine mouthwash (0. 12 %) have comparable results in plaque reduction.

30|$|Tomato {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} vegetable crops and its fruit production reaches about 164 [*]×[*] 106 million tons from 4.7 [*]×[*] 106  ha around the world (FAOSTAT, 2015). Using chemical methods for controlling pests such as western flower thrips Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande) is not sustainable because of their high costs and risks on non-target organisms and environmental systems (Herron et al., 2007). F. occidentalis {{is one of the}} serious polyphagous and cosmopolitan insect pests with marked harmful and adverse effects on flowers and fruits to over 200 host plants (Yang et al., 2015). It has also a high resistance to insecticides (about 163 cases) among more than 26 <b>active</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>ingredients</b> around the world (Bielza et al., 2007 and Wang et al., 2011). Larvae and adults of F. occidentalis have a high affinity level to attack aboveground organs of crops, especially buds, fruits, and young leaves (Venette and Davis, 2004). F. occidental injury can range from deformation and shifting for plant colors from bronze to black to heavy infections with lessening, dwarfed and defoliation of leaves, and detached petioles from the plant stem. Moreover, F. occidentalis is a vector of many plant viruses such as maize chlorotic mottle virus, impatiens necrotic spot virus, and tomato spotted wilt virus (Webster et al., 2011 and Zhao et al., 2014). Populations of F. occidentalis can rapidly rebound from insecticide applications due to its high fecundity, haplotype genetics, and short generation time (Gao et al., 2012). It is difficult to control F. occidentalis with insecticides because it deposits its eggs inside plant tissues and the adults and larvae feed in concealed locations such as flower buds, which protected them from insecticide effects (Brodsgaard, 2004). Thus, an urgent requirement is strongly needed for the biological control strategy.|$|E
40|$|To enhance {{therapeutic}} {{efficacy and}} reduce adverse effects, practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) often prescribe {{a combination of}} multiple herbs, called Traditional Chinese Herbal formulae (TCHF), according to the compatibility principle of TCM. To clarify the possible compatibility mechanism of formulae with systems polypharmacology analyses, we use Sini Decoction (SNT), which has been proven {{to be effective in}} treating cardiovascular diseases (CVD), as a model. The main components of SND are Aconitum carmichaeli Debeaux [Ranunculaceae], Zingiber officinale Roscoe [Zingiberaceae] and Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch. ex DC [Febaceae]. In this research, we initially construct a chemical library with 347 reported constituents in SND, and narrowed the library to 40 compounds by selecting representative chemical structures. Then, we constructed several databases for the specific indications of SND, including heart failure, myocardial infarction, and shock, and an integrated database for CVD to perform high throughput docking with the 40 compounds in SND. Systems pharmacology is applied to investigate the polypharmacological mechanisms of SND formulae in treatment of CVD. The predicted results showed that 31 ingredients in SND were associated with 33 targets related to the autonomic nervous system, the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system, blood coagulation, ionic channels and the glucocorticoid receptor. Through analysis of the compound-target interaction, we found multiple <b>active</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>ingredients</b> might interact with the same target, thus explaining the synergistic mechanisms of SND as ‘‘Jun (emperor) - Chen (minister) - Zuo (adjuvant) - Shi (courier) ’’. To validate the polypharmacological effects predicted by molecular docking, the experimental validation was further performed on three selected representative constituents (aconitine, liquiritin, and 6 -gingerol) according to our predicted results. The results showed that the three constituents combination could produce the same cardiac effects in the rat heart failure model with the combination of three herbs in SND, and confirmed the three constituents we predicted are most likely the active constituents. This computational systems pharmacology data revealed that aconitine was the principal component of the formula, whereas liquiritin and 6 -gingerol served as adjuvant ingredients, as 6 -gingerol can enhance the cardiac effects of aconitine, and liquiritin can alleviate the arrhythmia caused by aconitine. The predictions are all congruent with the other reports and experiments results...|$|E
