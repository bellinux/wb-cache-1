50|$|This unique {{structure}} {{is believed to}} damage tumor cells through {{the production of the}} weakly alkylating species formaldehyde, a product of CYP450-mediated N-demethylation. Administered orally, <b>altretamine</b> is extensively metabolized on first pass, producing primarily mono- and didemethylated metabolites. Additional demethylation reactions occur in tumor cells, releasing formaldehyde in situ before the drug is excreted in the urine. The carbinolamine (methylol) intermediates of CYP450-mediated metabolism also can generate electrophilic iminium species that are capable of reacting covalently with DNA guanine and cytosine residues as well as protein. Iminium-mediated DNA cross-linking and DNA-protein interstrand cross-linking, mediated through both the iminium intermediate and formaldehyde, have been demonstrated, although the significance of DNA cross-linking on <b>altretamine</b> antitumor activity is uncertain.|$|E
40|$|Background. <b>Altretamine</b> has {{reported}} efficacy {{in the treatment}} of recurrent ovarian cancer following platinum-based therapy. This report presents the cases of two long-term survivors with recurrent ovarian cancer given oral <b>altretamine.</b> Cases. Two patients diagnosed with stage IIIC ovarian cancer underwent optimal cytoreductive surgery. Both women were subsequently treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. One had persistent cancer documented 2 months post therapy, while the other was disease-free for 22 months before recurring. Both received <b>altretamine</b> in a salvage setting. Each of these women achieved a prolonged response to third-line <b>altretamine</b> therapy, and one of whom was disease-free for 4 years and the other remains disease-free over 7 years following initiation of salvage therapy. Conclusion. Outpatient-administered oral <b>altretamine</b> can provide a prolonged disease-free interval with minimal toxicity. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the activity of}} oral <b>Altretamine</b> in women with epithelial ovarian carcinoma who responded (PR or CR) to first line chemotherapy but relapsed within 6 months. The protocol was later amended to include patients with relapse within 12 months. METHODS: A multicentric phase II trial. The patients had to have measurable disease. No more than one prior chemotherapy regiment was allowed. The patients were treated with 260 mg/m(2) /day of <b>Altretamine</b> in four divided doses for 2 weeks, repeated every 4 weeks. The response was evaluated after every two courses. RESULTS: Thirty-one eligible patients were treated with a median of 3 courses of <b>Altretamine</b> (range 1 - 12). Hematological toxicity was minimal. Gastrointestinal toxicity was common. Response evaluation was possible for 26 patients. Three patients (9. 7 % intent-to-treat) achieved a partial response. Eight patients had stable disease, and 15 patients had progressive disease after two treatment courses. The median time to progression was 10 weeks (range, 5 - 51 weeks). Medial survival was 34 weeks (range, 7 - 112 +). CONCLUSION: <b>Altretamine</b> should not be chosen as standard treatment in patients with platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer.

40|$|Purpose: The {{efficacy}} and pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel {{when combined with}} <b>altretamine</b> for ovarian cancer were studied. Methods: A group of 30 patients, whose only chemotherapy was one or more cisplatin-based non-paclitaxel-containing regimens and whose ovarian cancer failed to respond or had relapsed within 6 months of their last platinum regimen, received paclitaxel as a 3 -h intravenous infusion and <b>altretamine</b> given orally in four divided doses daily for 14 days repeated every 28 days. Doses were escalated from paclitaxel/altretamine 135 / 150 mg/m 2 to 250 / 300 mg/m 2 in cohorts of three patients. Results: The dose-limiting toxicities at 250 / 300 mg/m 2 were WHO grade 3 myalgias and arthralgias in two patients and grade 3 lethargy, stomach cramps, peripheral neuropathy and vomiting in single patients. Considering all dose levels in cycle 1, 16 patients had grade 3 or 4 neutropenia {{but there was only}} one episode of febrile neutropenia. Other grade 3 toxicities were vomiting in four patients, myalgias in three, peripheral neuropathy in two and lethargy in two. Grade 3 alopecia occurred in 23 patients. Three patients achieved a complete response and 12 achieved a partial response for an overall objective response rate of 50 %. Responses occurred at all dose levels of 175 / 150 mg/m 2 and higher. The median freedom from progression was 35 weeks, with a median survival of 55 weeks. <b>Altretamine</b> did not alter the pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel and there were no consistent differences in paclitaxel pharmacokinetic parameters or toxicities between course 1 and 2. No dose-response relationships were evident above paclitaxel/altretamine 175 / 150 mg/m 2. Conclusion: Paclitaxel and <b>altretamine</b> can be safely combined and with a high response rate in relapsed ovarian cancer, justifying further studies with this combination.

40|$|SummaryGenome-wide {{identification}} of the mechanism of action (MoA) of small-molecule compounds characterizing their targets, effectors, and activity modulators represents a highly relevant yet elusive goal, with critical implications for assessment of compound efficacy and toxicity. Current approaches are labor intensive and mostly limited to elucidating high-affinity binding target proteins. We introduce a regulatory network-based approach that elucidates genome-wide MoA proteins based on {{the assessment of the}} global dysregulation of their molecular interactions following compound perturbation. Analysis of cellular perturbation profiles identified established MoA proteins for 70 % of the tested compounds and elucidated novel proteins that were experimentally validated. Finally, unknown-MoA compound analysis revealed <b>altretamine,</b> an anticancer drug, as an inhibitor of glutathione peroxidase 4 lipid repair activity, which was experimentally confirmed, thus revealing unexpected similarity to the activity of sulfasalazine. This suggests that regulatory network analysis can provide valuable mechanistic insight into the elucidation of small-molecule MoA and compound similarity...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Ovarian {{cancer is}} the most common gynaecological cancer with an annual {{incidence}} of 21. 6 per 100, 000 in England and Wales. Due to the often asymptomatic nature of {{the early stages of the}} disease, most cases are not detected until the advanced stages. Consequently, the prognosis after diagnosis is poor and the 5 -year survival rate in the UK is only about 30 %. Current recommendations suggest that first-line chemotherapy for ovarian cancer should involve paclitaxel and platinum (Pt) -based therapy (cisplatin/ carboplatin), however, most patients develop resistant or refractory disease and require second-line therapy. Patients may respond to re-challenge with Pt-agents if the treatment-free interval is > 6 months, but an alternative is often required. Topotecan is one of six drugs currently licensed in the UK for second-line therapy, and recent reviews suggest that it has modest efficacy in the treatment of advanced disease and performs favourably against paclitaxel. However, these reviews are based on a limited number of reports mainly consisting of non-randomised Phase I and II studies. OBJECTIVES OF THE REVIEW: To examine the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of oral and intravenous topotecan (Hycamtin, SmithKline Beecham, UK) for the treatment of all stages of ovarian cancer. METHODS: SEARCH STRATEGY: Sixteen electronic databases from inception to September 2000 and Internet resources were searched, in addition to the bibliographies of retrieved articles and submissions from pharmaceutical companies. METHODS: INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Two reviewers independently screened all titles/abstracts and included/excluded studies based on full copies of manuscripts. Any disagreements were resolved through discussion. Only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and full economic evaluations comparing topotecan to non-topotecan regimens were included. All stages of therapy and disease were considered, and the outcomes included were survival, response, symptom relief, quality of life, adverse effects and costs. METHODS: DATA EXTRACTION STRATEGY: Data were extracted into an Access database by one reviewer and checked by a second. Any disagreements were resolved through discussion. METHODS: QUALITY ASSESSMENT STRATEGY: Two reviewers, using specified criteria, independently assessed the quality of the clinical effectiveness studies and the economic evaluations. Any disagreements were resolved through discussion. METHODS: ANALYSIS STRATEGY: Due to the limited number of studies included in the review and the fact that they compared topotecan with different comparators, the out-come data could not be pooled statistically. Clinical effectiveness data are discussed separately under the different outcome subheadings. For time-to-event data, hazard ratios with 95 % confidence intervals are presented where available, and for the remaining outcomes, relative risks are reported or calculated where sufficient data were available. Relative risk data are also presented in the form of Forest plots without pooled estimates. Economic data are presented in the form of a summary and critique of the evidence, and a grading (A-I) assigned to each study indicating the direction and magnitude of the cost-effectiveness data. RESULTS: INCLUDED STUDIES: A total of 568 titles/abstracts were identified and screened for relevance. Full copies of 72 papers were assessed and seven published manuscripts reporting details of two studies of clinical effectiveness and one economic evaluation were included. Further details of the two clinical effectiveness studies and two new economic evaluations were identified from confidential company submissions. Overall, two international multicentre RCTs of effectiveness comparing topotecan with paclitaxel (trial 039) and topotecan with caelyx (trial 30 - 49) were included in the review. The three economic evaluations included in the review comprised one cost-minimisation analysis (CMA) comparing topotecan with caelyx, one cost-consequences analysis (CCA) comparing topotecan with paclitaxel, etoposide and <b>altretamine</b> and one cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) comparing topotecan with paclitaxel. RESULTS: QUALITY OF CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS DATA: Both clinical effectiveness studies (trial 30 - 49 and 039) were of reasonable quality, although it was unclear whether either performed valid intention-to-treat analyses. In addition, trial 30 - 49 failed to state whether the outcome assessors were blinded to treatment allocation. RESULTS [...] QUALITY OF ECONOMIC EVALUATIONS: The CCA (comparing topotecan with three comparators) was of poor quality and of little relevance to the UK NHS. The CMA and CEA were of reasonable quality overall and relevant to the UK NHS. However, both, in particular the CEA, suffered from methodological problems, and thus their findings should be interpreted with caution. RESULTS: ASSESSMENT OF CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS: The assessment of clinical effectiveness was based on limited data. Only two trials with a total of 709 participants were identified. In general, with a few minor exceptions, there were no statistically significant differences between topotecan and paclitaxel, or topotecan and caelyx in survival, response rate, median time to response, median duration of response and quality of life. Significant differences that were reported were mainly identified in subgroup analyses (Pt-sensitive disease and disease without ascites) of questionable validity and their relevance to a general advanced ovarian cancer patient population undergoing second-line chemotherapy is unclear. However, statistically significant differences were observed in the incidence of adverse effects. Topotecan was associated with increased incidences of haematological toxicities (including neutropenia, leukopenia, anaemia and thrombocytopenia), alopecia, nausea and vomiting. Caelyx-treated patients suffered from significantly increased incidences of Palmar-Plantar erythrodysesthesia, stomatitis, mucous membrane disorders and skin rashes. Paclitaxel was associated with significant increases in alopecia, arthralgia, myalgia, neuropathy, paraesthesiae, skeletal pain and flushing. RESULTS: ASSESSMENT OF COST-EFFECTIVENESS: The assessment of cost-effectiveness was also based on limited data, with three evaluations identified, one of which was not relevant. The two remaining studies, comparing topotecan with paclitaxel (CEA) and topotecan with caelyx (CMA), both used effectiveness data from multicentre RCTs and based their costs on 1999 / 2000 UK sources. The evaluations were conducted from a UK NHS perspective and findings presented in GB pounds/Euros. Topotecan for the second-line treatment of advanced ovarian cancer was shown to be more cost-effective than paclitaxel (32, 513 GB pounds versus 46, 186 GB pounds per person in terms of any response (complete or partial), incremental cost-effectiveness = 3065 GB pounds) in all respects except cost per time without toxicity or symptoms, but less cost-effective than caelyx (14, 023 GB pounds versus 9979 GB pounds per person regardless of whether the patient responded). However, direct comparisons of the cost findings between the two studies is difficult because they used different designs, different time horizons for the cost analyses and the findings were presented as costs per person for only patients who responded in one study (topotecan versus paclitaxel) and costs per person regardless of whether they responded in the other study (topotecan versus caelyx). CONCLUSIONS: This review indicates that there is little evidence in the form of RCTs on which to base an assessment of the effectiveness of topotecan as second-line therapy for advanced ovarian cancer. The evidence suggests there were no statistically significant differences overall between topotecan and paclitaxel, or topotecan and caelyx in clinical outcomes. However, statistically significant differences were observed in the incidence of adverse effects. The clinical significance of the findings is not discussed. Overall, the effects of topotecan could at best be described as modest, but the alternative agents offer no real advantages except fewer side-effects and possibly improved cost-effectiveness. Both of the clinical effectiveness studies on which this evidence is based had methodological flaws, the most serious being the lack of a blinded assessor in the topotecan versus caelyx trial, which is important for unbiased assessment of response outcomes. The economic evaluations also suffered from a number of potential problems. CONCLUSIONS: RECOMMENDATIONS FOR RESEARCH: Further good quality RCTs and CEAs are required comparing topotecan with other licensed and potentially useful (soon to be licensed) second-line treatments for ovarian cancer. At present, it is difficult to make any decisions about topotecan and other drugs for second-line therapy without good quality direct comparisons. In view of the ongoing studies identified, an update of the current review should be considered in approximately 18 months (Summer 2002) or possibly sooner if the recently commissioned National Institute for Clinical Excellence review of caelyx for ovarian cancer identifies additional data relevant to topoteca...|$|E
