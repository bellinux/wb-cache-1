5|$|After <b>a</b> <b>futile</b> {{attempt to}} {{approach}} Herald Island, the ship began the journey back to Alaska; {{next day she}} encountered Bear, with Bartlett aboard. McConnell records that the party were unanimous in their desire to remain with the ship that had effected their rescue, but Bartlett ordered them aboard Bear. Before returning to Alaska, Bear made a final attempt to reach Herald Island; ice limited their approach to , and they saw no signs of life. The reunited party arrived at Nome on 13 September, to a great welcome from the local population.|$|E
5|$|In {{carbohydrate}} anabolism, simple {{organic acids}} {{can be converted}} into monosaccharides such as glucose and then used to assemble polysaccharides such as starch. The generation of glucose from compounds like pyruvate, lactate, glycerol, glycerate 3-phosphate and amino acids is called gluconeogenesis. Gluconeogenesis converts pyruvate to glucose-6-phosphate {{through a series of}} intermediates, many of which are shared with glycolysis. However, this pathway is not simply glycolysis run in reverse, as several steps are catalyzed by non-glycolytic enzymes. This is important as it allows the formation and breakdown of glucose to be regulated separately, and prevents both pathways from running simultaneously in <b>a</b> <b>futile</b> cycle.|$|E
5|$|The other French {{ships were}} pursued by British ships {{of the line}} and the chase lasted much longer, into the morning of 11 April when HMS Hannibal caught the frigate Gentille. Hannibal was far larger than its {{opponent}} and the French captain surrendered immediately rather than fight <b>a</b> <b>futile</b> engagement. The third French frigate, Fraternité successfully escaped. After refitting in Portsmouth, Colpoys' ships returned to their station off Brest, the blockade remaining in place {{for the remainder of the}} year.|$|E

5|$|By the {{outbreak}} of the American Revolution, Martin was serving as an appointed justice on the Commission of Peace for Frederick County. Martin was reappointed as a justice of the peace by Governor Patrick Henry, along with William Booth and Warner Washington, but all three men declined to serve another term. Martin did not swear into the committee because he refused to serve under the new revolutionary regime, initially believing that American independence from Great Britain was <b>a</b> <b>futile</b> effort. The committee had also been actively arresting Loyalists, which may have influenced Martin's decision to turn down his reappointment. Martin retreated from performing civil service entirely, and afterward retired to Greenway Court. Prior to his death, Martin became an active Freemason.|$|E
5|$|St. Louis Cardinals Pro Bowl rookie Vai Sikahema tied an NFL {{record by}} {{returning}} two punts for touchdowns as the Buccaneers clinched the NFL's worst {{record for the}} second consecutive year. Frank Garcia, playing with a back injury, had a third punt blocked for a net gain of 1 yard. The Buccaneers scored first, on a 1-yard Bobby Howard run, but the Cardinals' 21 unanswered points gave them the lead for good before halftime. A 33-yard touchdown pass from Steve Young to Phil Freeman brought the Buccaneers to within 4 points in the third quarter. The game not only ended <b>a</b> <b>futile</b> season for the Buccaneers, but also concluded the Cardinals' worst season since moving to St. Louis 27 years earlier.|$|E
5|$|The 4th Cruiser Squadron was tasked {{to protect}} Allied {{merchant}} shipping from commerce raiders in the Caribbean {{and along the}} East Coast of North America and Craddock dispersed his ships shortly before the war began on 4 August 1914 in <b>a</b> <b>futile</b> search for the two German warships known {{to be in the}} area. In the early evening of 6 August, Bristol spotted the German light cruiser , but failed to inflict any significant damage before engine problems allowed the German ship to disengage behind her own smoke. Later in the month, Bristol began patrolling off the northern coast of Brazil in an unsuccessful attempt to find the German ships. The ship was detached to continue to patrol the Brazilian coast and did not join Craddock's ships as they searched for the East Asia Squadron off the Chilean coast in October.|$|E

5|$|The High Seas Fleet, {{particularly}} its wartime impotence {{and ultimate}} fate, strongly influenced the later German navies, the Reichsmarine and Kriegsmarine. Former Imperial Navy officers continued {{to serve in}} the subsequent institutions, including Admiral Erich Raeder, Hipper's former chief of staff, who became the {{commander in chief of the}} Reichsmarine. Raeder advocated long-range commerce raiding by surface ships, rather than constructing a large surface fleet to challenge the Royal Navy, which he viewed to be <b>a</b> <b>futile</b> endeavor. His initial version of Plan Z, the construction program for the Kriegsmarine in the late 1930s, called for large number of s, long-range light cruisers, and reconnaissance forces for attacking enemy shipping, though he was overruled by Adolf Hitler, who advocated a large fleet of battleships.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, {{his wife}} Badia'a died and al-Hajj Muhammad {{was left with}} his four sons. With the killing of Izz al-Din al-Qassam, a Muslim revivalist preacher and anti-colonial militant by British forces, {{tensions}} between the Palestinian Arab population, among whom al-Qassam was popular, and the authorities rose significantly. His sympathizers grew in number {{and the notion of}} armed struggle against British rule and British sponsorship of Zionism became increasingly popular {{as an alternative to the}} diplomatic negotiations between the Palestinian leadership and the British government. The negotiations were ultimately seen by the local population as <b>a</b> <b>futile</b> effort that bore no tangible results. When al-Hajj Muhammad actively took part in the upcoming revolt, he entrusted his children with his sister Halima, a widow. According to his eldest son Kamal, she too was a grain merchant, who later traded in textiles. She also financially supported the children's education. Al-Hajj Muhammad would normally meet with his sons for one or two days in different villages. His children would be escorted to his location by one of al-Hajj Muhammad's rebels.|$|E
5|$|Jeff Winger, a disbarred lawyer, has {{enrolled}} at Greendale Community College {{as a condition}} for getting his license back. His plan is to use his friendship with Dr. Ian Duncan to obtain test answers. In the cafeteria Jeff meets the attractive Britta, and (in an attempt to get closer to her) convinces her to join his non-existent Spanish study group. As the study group convenes, Jeff pretends the other members simply did not show up. Britta, however, has invited Abed to join them. Jeff unsuccessfully tries to make him leave, and then gets called to the football field by Dr. Duncan. The professor makes <b>a</b> <b>futile</b> attempt to appeal to Jeff's conscience, and eventually agrees to provide the answers. Jeff returns to the study group, discovering that Abed has also invited Troy, Shirley, Pierce and Annie. Finding Britta smoking outside, he suggests the two study alone, but she persuades him to return.|$|E

Like all women of her rank, Helen was also interested in social works. Nevertheless, she continued to be worried for her family, and even visited her sister Irene, her aunt Maria and her Greek cousins in <b>an</b> <b>futile</b> attempt to console herself about the remoteness of her parents.|$|R

5|$|The New Kingdom pharaohs began a {{large-scale}} building {{campaign to promote}} the god Amun, whose growing cult was based in Karnak. They also constructed monuments to glorify their own achievements, both real and imagined. The Karnak temple is the largest Egyptian temple ever built. The pharaoh Hatshepsut used such hyperbole and grandeur during her reign of almost twenty-two years. Her reign was very successful, marked by {{an extended period of}} peace and wealth-building, trading expeditions to Punt, restoration of foreign trade networks, and great building projects, including an elegant mortuary temple that rivaled the Greek architecture of a thousand years later, a colossal pair of obelisks, and a chapel at Karnak. Despite her achievements, Amenhotep II, the heir to Hatshepsut's nephew-stepson Tuthmosis III, sought to erase her legacy {{near the end of his}} father's reign and throughout his, touting many of her accomplishments as his. He also tried to change many established traditions that had developed over the centuries, which some suggest was <b>a</b> <b>futile</b> attempt to prevent other women from becoming pharaoh and to curb their influence in the kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Lion {{became the}} {{flagship}} of Vice-Admiral W. C. Pakenham in December 1916 when he assumed {{command of the}} Battlecruiser Fleet upon Beatty's promotion to command of the Grand Fleet. Lion had an uneventful time {{for the rest of}} the war, conducting patrols of the North Sea as the High Seas Fleet was forbidden to risk any more losses. She provided support for British light forces involved in the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight on 17 November 1917, but never came within range of any German forces. The 1st BCS, including Lion, sailed on 12 December in <b>a</b> <b>futile</b> attempt to intercept the German destroyers that had sunk the convoy en route to Norway earlier that day, but returned to base the following day. Lion, along with the rest of the Grand Fleet, sortied on the afternoon of 23 March 1918 after radio transmissions had revealed that the High Seas Fleet was at sea after a failed attempt to intercept the regular British convoy to Norway. However, the Germans were too far ahead of the British and escaped without firing a shot. When the High Seas Fleet sailed for Scapa Flow on 21 November 1918 to be interned, she was among the escorting ships. Along with the rest of the 1st BCS she guarded the interned ships until she was assigned to the Atlantic Fleet in April 1919 and then placed in reserve in March 1920. Paid off on 30 March 1922, despite a press campaign to have her saved for the nation as a memorial, Lion was sold for scrap on 31 January 1924 for £77,000 to meet the tonnage limitations of the Washington Naval Treaty.|$|E
5|$|The CIA {{operation}} was complicated by a premature coup on 29 March 1953, with <b>a</b> <b>futile</b> raid against the army garrison at Salamá, {{in the central}} Guatemalan department of Baja Verapaz. The rebellion was swiftly crushed, {{and a number of}} participants were arrested. Several CIA agents and allies were imprisoned, weakening the coup effort. Thus the CIA came to rely more heavily on the Guatemalan exile groups and their anti-democratic allies in Guatemala. The CIA considered several candidates to lead the coup. Miguel Ydígoras Fuentes, the conservative candidate who had lost the 1950 election to Árbenz, held favor with the Guatemalan opposition but was rejected {{for his role in the}} Ubico regime, as well as his European appearance, which was unlikely to appeal to the majority mixed-race mestizo population. Another popular candidate was the coffee planter Juan Córdova Cerna, who had briefly served in Arévalo's cabinet before becoming the legal adviser to the UFC. The death of his son in an anti-government uprising in 1950 turned him against the government, and he had planned the unsuccessful Salamá coup in 1953 before fleeing to join Castillo Armas in exile. Although his status as a civilian gave him an advantage over Castillo Armas, he was diagnosed with throat cancer in 1954, taking him out of the reckoning. Thus it was Castillo Armas, in exile since the failed 1949 coup and on the CIA's payroll since the aborted PBFORTUNE in 1951, who was to lead the coming coup.|$|E
