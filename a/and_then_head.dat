John Schofield (Pope's immediate predecessor in the Department of the Missouri <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>head</b> of the Department of the Pacific) concluded that Major General Fitz John Porter had been unfairly convicted of cowardice and disobedience at the Second Battle of Bull Run.

Soon, Schofield himself was criticized for his actions as superintendent of the U.S. Military at West Point following the hazing of an African American cadet.|$|E
