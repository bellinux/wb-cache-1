5000|$|Aerodrome or [...] "Tower" [...] {{controllers}} work in tall towers {{with large}} windows allowing them, in good weather, {{to see the}} aircraft flying {{in the vicinity of}} the aerodrome, unless the aircraft is not in sight from the tower (e.g. a helicopter departing from a ramp area). Also, aircraft in the vicinity of an aerodrome tend to be flying at lower speeds. Therefore, if the aerodrome controller can see both aircraft, or both <b>aircraft</b> <b>report</b> that they can see each other, or a following aircraft reports that it can see the preceding one, controllers may reduce the standard separation to whatever is adequate to prevent a collision.|$|E

50|$|Unlike first-generation ACMI systems, {{which use}} ground radars {{to track and}} record the {{position}} of the aircraft on the range, AACMI systems use aircraft-mounted satellite navigation systems such as the US NAVSTAR GPS system. Recording of aircraft tracks can therefore be independent of ground-based radar, and are sometimes called range-less or autonomous. Radio transmissions from the <b>aircraft</b> <b>report</b> its position in three dimensions to other aircraft on the range and also to ground control. This enables real-time air-to-air exercises to be carried out and also complex ground debriefs (after-action review or AAR) based on data recorded at the time. Such de-briefs involve the use of modern graphics and display techniques that can bring out training and other points to aircrew and ground staff.|$|E
50|$|In the U.S. system, {{at higher}} altitudes, over 90% of the U.S. {{airspace}} {{is covered by}} radar and often by multiple radar systems; however, coverage may be inconsistent at lower altitudes used by unpressurized aircraft due to high terrain or distance from radar facilities. A center may require numerous radar systems to cover the airspace assigned to them, and may also rely on pilot position reports from aircraft flying below the floor of radar coverage. This results in {{a large amount of}} data being available to the controller. To address this, automation systems have been designed that consolidate the radar data for the controller. This consolidation includes eliminating duplicate radar returns, ensuring the best radar for each geographical area is providing the data, and displaying the data in an effective format.Centers also exercise control over traffic travelling over the world's ocean areas. These areas are also flight information regions (FIRs). Because there are no radar systems available for oceanic control, oceanic controllers provide ATC services using procedural control. These procedures use aircraft position reports, time, altitude, distance, and speed to ensure separation. Controllers record information on flight progress strips and in specially developed oceanic computer systems as <b>aircraft</b> <b>report</b> positions. This process requires that aircraft be separated by greater distances, which reduces the overall capacity for any given route. See for example the North Atlantic Track system.|$|E

40|$|A {{high-resolution}} mesoscale {{model with}} horizontal mesh size of 6 km {{is applied to}} simulate upper-level wave breaking above the Alps during a south foehn event in January 1996.

The simulations predict breaking gravity waves above the jet stream in a layer between 10 and 15 km altitude where the shear is maximum.
