40|$|The noise {{emissions}} evaluation of large vessels {{is often an}} underestimated issue. In recent years, the evolution of ship design has been characterized, both for commercial and cruise ships, by the growing tonnage and {{the increasing number of}} sound sources present on board. Consequently, the determination of acoustic emissions of sources so large and complex requires the development of measurement techniques that need to be always adapted to the specific context of analysis and operational procedures of the vessel. Despite there being many references that can be found on technical standards, the majority of measurement methods are devoted to specific types of ships, mainly of small size, and it’s difficult to fit these evaluation procedures to large vessels. In the present paper a comparison between different measurement techniques and evaluation methods is reported, with reference to <b>airborne</b> <b>noise</b> <b>emission</b> in the external environment of large vessels during procedures of navigation, manoeuvring and mooring...|$|E
40|$|The {{evaluation}} of noise emissions {{of a ship}} is a problem particularly complex. The difficulties {{are related to the}} characteristics and to the ways of relating to potential receptors of the source itself. The analysis of noise emission and propagation from a vessel can be divided in several parts, essentially based on the medium of sound energy propagation and on the environmental reference: internal (airborne and structural propagation) and external (airborne and underwater propagation, vibration effects on harbour structures inducted by wave motion). While internal and underwater sound propagation can be effectively evaluated by standardized test methods for many types of vessels, the assessment of external noise propagation requires more attention, because measurement methods do not always fit to the type of vessel and to operating procedures of navigation and mooring. From this point of view, a very interesting case is that of the large cruise ships. In recent years, the gross tonnage rose sharply and the form factor has been modified to allow the housing of an increasing number of passengers. Therefore, several aspects related to acoustic emissions are involved, such as the increase of funnels height and number of sources on the ship sides, mainly ventilation outlets. The consequences are particularly noticeable when the ship is moored, often because its height overlooks the port facilities and the effect of noise produced by power supply and ventilation systems can be significant on the surrounding urban areas. The paper addresses the actual framework regarding ship noise, comparing different measurement techniques and evaluation methods, with reference to <b>airborne</b> <b>noise</b> <b>emission</b> in the external environment of moored large cruise ships...|$|E
40|$|The work {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} the ship <b>noise</b> <b>emissions</b> towards the inner part of the vessel and towards the external space. In the former case, {{the focus is on the}} air-borne and structureborne transmission to living and working spaces on board. Limits and regulations are devoted primarily to the preservation of the worker's health and integrity and to the attainment of comfortable conditions in resting and recreational spaces for crew and passengers. As regards <b>airborne</b> <b>noise</b> <b>emissions</b> from the ship, the main concern is for the inhabitants of the living areas near ports and along the coast in case of heavy ship traffic. Finally, <b>noise</b> <b>emissions</b> in water are considered; in this case, the concern is about their negative impact on the marine wildlife. The present situation in terms of national, regional and international requirements and the trends in the normative framework for the various emissions are highlighte...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} the impact of <b>airborne</b> <b>noise</b> emitted by {{commercial}} ships moored at quay is gaining attention by Regulatory Bodies. The question is often raised by citizens sending complaints to the municipalities of port cities in which the harbour is located inside the town. The problem may be even more important in the case of pleasure crafts accessing protected areas and mooring there. Limit levels for <b>airborne</b> <b>noise</b> <b>emissions</b> started therefore to be fixed in normative as well as contract requirements. In the light of what above, an effective measurement procedure to characterise the <b>noise</b> <b>emissions</b> from ships and compare them to limits plays an important role. The procedure needs to take into account aspects linked to the ship source characteristics (dimensions, complexity, directivity) as well as related to the surrounding environment, which is often represented by the shipyard where the ship is built. The latter aspect includes the presence of obstacles and reflecting surfaces around the ship, as well as significant components of background noise. The paper recalls the background of a measurement procedure that was defined within the project SILENV of the 7 th Framework Programme specifically for the purpose of the characterisation of ships as <b>airborne</b> <b>noise</b> sources and reports a trial application of this procedure to a ship moored at a yard quay. Instrumentation used and data post processing are discussed, together with practical problems encountered and solutions found in order to carry out measurements...|$|R
40|$|Noise {{pollution}} {{is an important}} part of the environmental impact of ships. The noise inside the vessel (affecting crew and passengers) has been regulated since a few decades, while the impact of emissions in water on the marine fauna has been under consideration at the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) only in the last few years. No specific effort seems to be in place towards a regulatory framework for external <b>airborne</b> <b>noise</b> <b>emissions</b> from sea going commercial ships. Only the particular cases of inland vessels and pleasure crafts are partially covered by rules. The <b>airborne</b> <b>noise</b> pollution from commercial ships, on the other hand, does affect people living near channels, in coastal areas with intense traffic or near ports, where ships enter and stay at wharf for loading/unloading processes. The actual dimension of the problem is remarked by several cases of complaints sent out by citizens living in the urban areas affected. Within the SILENV project (Ships oriented Innovative soLutions to rEduce Noise & Vibrations, funded by the E. U.) assessment criteria for the <b>airborne</b> <b>noise</b> emitted by sea-going ships have been proposed: the background information, the general criteria at the basis of the formulation, the aims as well as the verification procedure of the proposed limits are discussed in the paper...|$|R
40|$|<b>Airborne</b> <b>noise</b> <b>emissions</b> from ships {{can be a}} {{significant}} source of annoyance. Therefore, it is important to accurately predict ship noise in order to get an effective environmental noise control in planning new ports, or in widening existing harbor, or in locating new mooring positions. To test the reliability of current commercial simulators in predicting the noise field from complex sources such as ships, in the present work the <b>airborne</b> <b>noise</b> propagation from two different vessels was modelled: a Multipurpose Ship and a Fishing Research Vessel. The development of the model for both ships was performed in five steps: acquisition of the input data; modelling of the ship in the sound propagation software; definition of the noise sources; model validation; output data generation. Simulated data were then compared with on field measurements. The obtained results rise some questions about the measurement techniques adopted to characterize the source levels and the validation data, the simplifications made on the ship surface and the typologies of sources utilized in the study. Future developments in numerical simulators are needed in order to better describe outdoor noise propagation from ships, taking into account the specific nature and complexity of such source...|$|R
40|$|Noise is a {{circumstance}} of ordinary life and mainly originated by continually growing dynamic and the rapid development of society. In the industrial environment there are noise-intensive parts {{that influence the}} condition of present operators negatively. Thus, measures of noise abatement have been investigated intensely by industrial companies as well as federal agencies.

The following paper outlines the mechanisms that induce the emission of high sound pressure levels. In order to achieve reproducible results a test bench for varying pneumatic standard components is introduced. Based on a selection of those components results are compared to standardized measurement procedures whether fulfilling the standardizations’ requirements. In conclusion, two benefits are achieved. Firstly, standardization is derived enabling neutral comparison of standard pneumatic components’ <b>noise</b> <b>emission.</b> Secondly, the measures can be evaluated to determine the most promising way to redesign pneumatic components of lower <b>noise</b> <b>emissions...</b>|$|R
40|$|Wind turbine design {{requirements}} are increasingly focussing on vibration and <b>noise</b> <b>emission</b> levels. In {{addition to the}} rotor and blades also the drive train is {{a contributor to the}} overall noise and vibrational behaviour of the wind turbine. Therefore good dynamic design of the drivetrain is highly important. With regard to acoustic radiation both excitations at gearbox input and output as internal excitations originating from the gears are important. Two acoustic phenomena are investigated: structure borne excitation past by/comming from the gearbox through the nacelle to the receiver and <b>airborne</b> <b>noise</b> directly radiated from the gearbox housing. This work discusses the use of a flexible multibody in combination with a Boundary Element Model (BEM) to asses these phenomena. The multibody model is used to calculate the housing vibrations. A method is discussed to convert these deformations at the structural mesh nodes to the nodes of the BEM mesh.

40|$|This article {{presents}} various operating systems, developed and implemented at the Athens Tram network {{to reduce the}} <b>airborne</b> <b>noise</b> emitted in the sharp curves of the tramway. From {{the first days of}} the network's operation (Olympic Games 2004), the problem of producing <b>airborne</b> squealing <b>noise</b> in certain sharp curves of the tramway was revealed, with a series of complaints to be recorded from residents in certain urban areas, regarding especially squealing <b>noise</b> <b>emissions</b> introducing annoying peak levels especially during evening & night hours. The problem was treated, initially, by coating the tracks with biodegradable lubricant, at sharp curves, where it appeared that friction phenomena were significant. The coating has been performed manually for some years by maintenance personnel of the network, providing suitable results by the acoustic measurement program. Even though this intervention has produced positive results, as well as alternative technical solutions relating to the installation of mechanisms for automatic lubrication of rails with special friction modifiers, they were proven not to be feasible economically. Therefore an automatic rail wetting system was implied, containing sensors to detect approaching trams, water supply, timer, solenoid valves, pipes and common irrigation vaporizers. The system is quite simple and is implemented using common components of retail trade, many of which are already used in existing irrigation network of the tramway, while the maintenance does not require trained staff, it is performed by the staff of TRAM SA and in connection with the maintenance of the irrigation network.

40|$|The {{sources and}} paths by which noise enters the cabin {{of a small}} single engine {{aircraft}} were determined {{through a combination of}} flight and laboratory tests. The primary sources of noise were found to be <b>airborne</b> <b>noise</b> from the propeller and engine casing, <b>airborne</b> <b>noise</b> from the engine exhaust, structureborne noise from the engine/propeller combination and noise associated with air flow over the fuselage. For the propeller, the primary airborne paths were through the firewall, windshield and roof. For the engine, the most important airborne path was through the firewall.

These signals, for various sets of experiments, were recorded using a digital microphone. A Matlab code was developed and employed to estimate the noise parameters from the recorded sound.

Since diamond grinding has been observed to affect tyre/pavement <b>noise</b> <b>emission</b> favourably, the relationship among surface texture, concrete composition and <b>noise</b> <b>emission</b> of concrete pavement surfaces has been systematically investigated. The simulation program SPERoN was used in a parameter study to investigate the main factors which affect <b>noise</b> <b>emission.</b> Based {{on the results of}} the simulations, textured concrete surfaces were produced by using a laboratory grinding machine. As well as the composition of the concrete, the thickness and spacing of the diamond blades were varied. The ability of the textured surfaces to reduce <b>noise</b> <b>emission</b> was assessed from the texture characteristics and air flow resistance of textured surfaces measured in the laboratory. It was found that concrete composition and, in particular, the spacing of the blades affected the reduction in <b>noise</b> <b>emission</b> considerably. The <b>noise</b> <b>emission</b> behaviour of numerous road sections was also considered in field investigations. The pavement surfaces had been textured by diamond grinding during the last years or decades. The results show that diamond grinding is able to provide good, durable noise-reducing properties. Several new pavement sections were investigated using thicknesses and spacings of the blades similar to those used in the laboratory to optimize <b>noise</b> <b>emission</b> reduction. It is concluded that diamond grinding is a good alternative to exposed aggregate concrete for the production of low-noise pavement surfaces...|$|R

While underwater noise levels were shown to be harmful for the marine biology, the propagation of <b>airborne</b> piling <b>noise</b> over sea has not been studied in detail before. In this study, detailed numerical calculations have been performed with the Green's Function Parabolic Equation (GFPE) method to estimate noise levels up to a distance of 10 km. Measured <b>noise</b> <b>emission</b> levels during piling of pinpiles for a jacket-foundation wind turbine were assessed and used together with combinations of the sea surface state and idealized vertical sound speed profiles (downwind sound propagation). Effective impedances were found and used to represent non-flat sea surfaces at low-wind sea states 2, 3, and 4. Calculations show that scattering by a rough sea surface, which decreases sound pressure levels, exceeds refractive effects, which increase sound pressure levels under downwind conditions. This suggests that the presence of wind, even when blowing downwind to potential receivers, is beneficial to increase the attenuation of piling sound over the sea. A fully flat sea surface therefore represents a worst-case scenario...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the <b>airborne</b> <b>noise</b> reduction of agricultural tractor cabs. The characteristics of the noise radiated from a non-cab-equipped tractor have been evaluated and used in conjunction with the classical theories of airborne sound transmission loss to predict the <b>airborne</b> <b>noise</b> reductions of tractor cabs. An experimental cab has beep constructed and used to evaluate these predictions. The theoretical and experimental <b>airborne</b> <b>noise</b> reductions do not show a good agreement. This {{has been shown to be}} due to two ressons. Firstly, there are anomalies in the classical airborne sound transmission loss theory whereby the theoretical and experimental sound transmission loss spectra do not show good agreement. Secondly, one-dimensional standing wave resonances in the cab cavity have been shown to give rise to an irregular plateau in the experimental <b>airborne</b> <b>noise</b> reduction spectra. Anomalies have been shown to exist between airborne sound transmission loss theory and reverberant room transmission loss measurements. These have arisen because the theory has not hitherto considered panel flexure. Modifications have been introduced which take account of panel flexure and these show that the dependence of classical theory on the angle of incident excitation is false and angular dependence occurs on the transmitted side of the panel, giving rise to a coincidence effect on the transmitted side which is independent of the angle of incidence. These modifications give rise to complete qualitative explanation of the shape of empirical airborne sound transmission loss spectra. Quantitative modifications have not been introduced because of lack of information regarding the angular nature of the transmitted waves...|$|R

Here {{it was found that}} the <b>noise</b> <b>emission</b> of wet porous road surfaces is significantly higher than the <b>noise</b> <b>emission</b> at dry weather conditions and that rainfall can incidentally increase noise levels up to 5 dBA. The results for the N 256 motorway at Colijnsplaat in Zeeland in 2005 are in agreement with 2004 and show a discrepancy in measured and calculated <b>noise</b> <b>emissions</b> for all vehicle categories. At this site during rainfall the traffic <b>noise</b> <b>emissions</b> increased with approximately 1, 5 dBA. The <b>noise</b> <b>emissions</b> of heavy trucks here are almost independent of temperature. Furthermore there is a large variation in vehicle <b>noise</b> <b>emissions</b> within the distinguished categories. In March of 2006, a small sample set of additional measurements was therefore carried out at the Amsterdamsestraatweg in Utrecht in order to gain further insight into these variations.
