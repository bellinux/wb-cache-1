5|$|Chana School is a Registered Historic Place in Ogle County, Illinois, in {{the county}} seat of Oregon, Illinois. One of six Oregon sites listed on the Register, the school is <b>an</b> <b>oddly</b> shaped, two-room schoolhouse which has been moved from its {{original}} location. Chana School joined the Register in 2005 as an education museum.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) leaves The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan (TGS) crew {{unmanaged}} as {{she must}} participate in jury duty {{for the trial}} of <b>an</b> <b>oddly</b> familiar woman (Hoffman). NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) tries to assert control over the crew in her stead and Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) uses the writers {{to develop a new}} name for a General Electric product. Meanwhile, Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) seeks Dr. Leo Spaceman's (Parnell) help so she can work on TGS and her movie.|$|E
5|$|Allosaurus is {{regarded}} as senior synonym of the genera Creosaurus, Epanterias, and Labrosaurus. Most of the species that are regarded as synonyms of A. fragilis, or that were misassigned to the genus, are obscure and were based on scrappy remains. One exception is Labrosaurus ferox, named in 1884 by Marsh for <b>an</b> <b>oddly</b> formed partial lower jaw, with a prominent gap in the tooth row {{at the tip of}} the jaw, and a rear section greatly expanded and turned down. Later researchers suggested that the bone was pathologic, showing an injury to the living animal, and that part of the unusual form of the rear of the bone was due to plaster reconstruction. It is now regarded as an example of A. fragilis.|$|E
6000|$|Wilfred laughed <b>a</b> little <b>oddly.</b> It {{was quite}} plain {{that he had}} been {{withstanding}} the temptress, only how long would the resistance have lasted? ...|$|R
6000|$|Ed Davies {{came toward}} him. [...] "Can I help you?" [...] he said. The man was <b>a</b> little <b>oddly</b> dressed, {{and with a}} beard! Ed couldn't help smiling.|$|R
6000|$|They had {{resumed their}} stroll. It {{seemed to her}} that he looked at her once or twice <b>a</b> little <b>oddly</b> without speaking. [...] "What caused your mother's illness?" [...] he asked, abruptly.|$|R
5|$|Several species coined in genera {{other than}} Allosaurus are also now {{thought to be}} synonymous with A. fragilis. Labrosaurus ferox was named in 1884 by Marsh for <b>an</b> <b>oddly</b> formed partial lower jaw, with a {{prominent}} gap in the tooth row {{at the tip of}} the jaw, and a rear section greatly expanded and turned down. Later researchers suggested that the bone was pathologic, showing an injury to the living animal, and that part of the unusual form of the rear of the bone was due to plaster reconstruction. It is recognized as most likely a specimen of A. fragilis.|$|E
5|$|Controversy arose {{regarding}} the artwork {{for the cover}} for the Classics VHS cassette when the film was first released on video when close examination of the artwork revealed <b>an</b> <b>oddly</b> shaped structure on the castle, closely resembling a human penis. Disney and the cover designer insist it was an accident, resulting from a late night rush job to finish the cover artwork. The questionable object does not appear {{on the cover of}} the second releasing of the movie. A second allegation is that a clergyman is seen with an erection during a scene late in the film. The clergyman is a short man, dressed in Bishop's clothing, and a small bulge is slightly noticeable in a few of the frames that are actually later shown to be the stubby-legged man's knees, but the image is small and is very difficult to distinguish. The combined incidents led an Arkansas woman to file suit against The Walt Disney Company in 1995, though she dropped the suit two months later.|$|E
25|$|Drode - The Drode is {{an alien}} creature, {{described}} as being similar to a very dark purple dinosaur with wrinkled, pruny skin, and <b>an</b> <b>oddly</b> humanoid face. Little is known of the Drode, but it serves Crayak and usually shows up when he does.|$|E
60|$|Madame la Vicomtesse smiled, for Auguste {{was fairly}} caught. He {{had not the}} astuteness to be <b>a</b> rogue; <b>oddly</b> he had the sense {{to know that he}} could fool us no longer.|$|R

25|$|In May 2017, astronomers {{reported}} studies {{related to}} laser light emissions from stars, {{as a way}} of detecting technology-related signals from an alien civilization. The reported studies included KIC 8462852, <b>an</b> <b>oddly</b> dimming star in which its unusual starlight fluctuations {{may be the result of}} interference by an artificial megastructure, such as a Dyson swarm, made by such a civilization. No evidence was found for technology-related signals from KIC 8462852 in the studies.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} development of multiple characters produced varying response from critics. Contrary to Mitch's stance {{as the main}} protagonist, Michael O'Sullivan of The Washington Post felt that Contagion [...] "treats him with <b>an</b> <b>oddly</b> clinical detachment". In particular Law's character, Alan Krumwiede, attracted commentary from Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times, who wrote, [...] "The blogger subplot doesn't interact clearly with the main story lines and functions mostly as an alarming but vague distraction." ...|$|E
500|$|... "White has {{the strange}} {{power to make}} natural historians of his readers, whether gardeners, historians or biologists", noting that this demands analysis. He observes further that [...] "White is {{straight}} out of Jane Austen. If {{it were not for}} his fame as a naturalist and writer, nothing in his life would distinguish him from hundreds of country parsons in the 18th and 19th centuries. The Natural History of Selborne is <b>an</b> <b>oddly</b> unassuming masterpiece, its haphazard construction revealing the process by which White came to write it." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{scale is}} also {{present on the}} Moodswinger. Although this {{functions}} quite differently than <b>a</b> Guqin, <b>oddly</b> enough the scale occurs on this instrument {{while it is not}} played in a just intonation tuning but a regular equal temperament.|$|R
50|$|Paul Francis Jennings (20 June 1918 - 26 December 1989) was an English humourist. For {{many years}} he wrote <b>a</b> column, <b>Oddly</b> Enough, in The Observer. Many {{collections}} were published, including The Jenguin Pennings, (a spoonerism) by Penguin Books in 1963.|$|R
6000|$|Francis Newman, the cardinal’s high-minded and {{accomplished}} brother, writes to Mr. Gladstone (1878) in {{a strain of}} exalted recognition of his services to the nation, and quotes (<b>a</b> little <b>oddly</b> perhaps) the beautiful lines in Euripides, foretelling the approaching triumph of Dionysus over his mortal foe.(331) ...|$|R
500|$|It {{remains the}} custom in Britain, on or around 5November, to let off fireworks. Traditionally, {{in the weeks}} running up to the 5th, {{children}} made [...] "guys"—effigies supposedly of Fawkes—usually made from old clothes stuffed with newspaper, and fitted with a grotesque mask, to be burnt on the 5November bonfire. These guys were exhibited in the street to collect money for fireworks, although this custom has become less common. The word guy thus came in the 19th century to mean <b>an</b> <b>oddly</b> dressed person, and hence in the 20th and 21st centuries to mean any male person.|$|E
500|$|Dylan mixed {{the album}} in Los Angeles in early April, before he {{departed}} on the Australian leg of his 1966 world tour. Wilentz writes {{that it was}} at this point it became [...] "obvious that the riches of the Nashville sessions could not fit onto a single LP", and they had [...] "produced enough solid material to demand <b>an</b> <b>oddly</b> configured double album, {{the first of its kind}} in contemporary popular music". According to producer Steve Berkowitz, who supervised the reissue of Dylan's LPs in mono as The Original Mono Recordings in 2010, Johnston told him that they carefully worked on the mono mix for about three or four days whereas the stereo mix was finished in about four hours.|$|E
500|$|Tom (Aziz Ansari) is {{attending}} a launch party for cologne maker Dennis Feinstein (Jason Mantzoukas) at the Snakehole Lounge, where Tom hopes to pitch his own cologne [...] "Tommy Fresh" [...] to him. Ben (Adam Scott) initially turns down the invitation {{because he does}} not want to get too attached to anybody, since his job will require him move soon. However, Ben relents when Tom invites him again at Leslie's urging (Ben also notes that [...] "Dennis Feinstein" [...] is <b>an</b> <b>oddly</b> ordinary name for a cologne designer, but Tom explains that Dennis' real name, [...] "Dante Fiero", is considered less exotic here). Meanwhile, April (Aubrey Plaza) and Andy (Chris Pratt) are now dating, but Andy is worried he is too broke to take her out.|$|E
50|$|Since 1969 when {{original}} model production started, constant {{change in}} auto models' {{shape and size}} meant that the 1310 was a small-sized sedan by now, {{even if it had}} started life as <b>a</b> medium-sized. <b>Oddly</b> enough, for <b>a</b> few months in 2004, Dacia had 3 different small sedan models simultaneously on offer.|$|R
50|$|For 1991, a four-speed {{electronic}} {{automatic transmission}} (known as the 4L80E), 25 more horsepower, and even higher torque (405 lbs/ft at 2400 rpm) {{were added to}} the 454SS. The rear-axle ratio was also lowered to 4.10:1 for extra jolt off the line. On the dash was <b>a</b> tachometer, <b>oddly</b> omitted from 1990 models. Dual exhaust was also added during the '91-'93 model years.|$|R
5000|$|The {{mountain}} summit area {{is known}} as Geiger's Garden, and sports <b>a</b> number of <b>oddly</b> shaped boulders caused by exfoliation of the granite rocks. These are popular with photographers and mountaineers.|$|R
500|$|Blade Runner delves {{into the}} effects of {{technology}} {{on the environment and}} society by reaching to the past, using literature, religious symbolism, classical dramatic themes, and film noir techniques. This tension between past, present, and future is mirrored in the [...] "retrofitted" [...] future depicted in the film, one which is high-tech and gleaming in places but decayed and outdated elsewhere. In an interview with The Observer in 2002, director Ridley Scott described the film as [...] "extremely dark, both literally and metaphorically, with <b>an</b> <b>oddly</b> masochistic feel". He also said that he [...] "liked the idea of exploring pain" [...] {{in the wake of his}} brother's death from skin cancer: [...] "When he was ill, I used to go and visit him in London, and that was really traumatic for me." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1948, Henery Wise {{who visited}} Lahaina Fort, where the then {{governor}} was residing, noted: “ a large square enclosure constructed of red coral rocks, banked up fifteen feet with earth , and mounting <b>an</b> <b>oddly</b> resorted battery of some thirty pieces of artillery, {{of all sorts}} of cartridges , and claibre long, short, and medium; they commanded the usual anchorage and no doubt very well to prevent any acts of violence from merchant ships; but it is a question, if, at the second discharging of shot, they do not tremble to pieces. There were a company of Hawaiian troops to man this fortress, who were well uniformed , and looked as well as Kanakas, or any other savages who have been accustomed half their lives to go naked can [...] look when their natural ease of motion is cramped by European clothing".|$|E
500|$|Some doubt exists {{about the}} height of her {{standing}} masts (excludes top and gallant masts), as surviving diagrams of Endeavour depict {{the body of the}} vessel only, and not the mast plan. While her main and foremast standing spars (excludes top and gallant masts) are accepted to be a standard (standards differed from shipyard to shipyard and country to country) , respectively from an annotation on one surviving ship plan National Maritime Museum in Greenwich NMM ZAZ6594 [...] which records these lengths has the mizzen as [...] "16yards 29inches" [...] (m). If correct, this would produce <b>an</b> <b>oddly</b> truncated mast a full [...] shorter than the standards of the day. late 20th century research suggested the annotation may be a transcription error and should read [...] "19yards29 inches" [...] (m), which would more closely conform with both the naval standards (which standard?) and the lengths of the other masts.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Oddly,</b> <b>A</b> 1909 listing still {{describes}} the {{light as a}} square wooden lightroom, carrying a fixed sixth order dioptric apparatus. The light shown {{is described as a}} white sector, visible for [...]|$|R
6000|$|... "The word 'good-bye,'" [...] I {{remarked to}} Clara, {{as we drove}} away, [...] "is always <b>a</b> painful one. <b>Oddly</b> enough when I was hunting the humpo, or humped buffalo, of the Himalayas----" ...|$|R
50|$|Early in Schayes' career, {{he broke}} his right arm and played almost an entire season in <b>a</b> cast. <b>Oddly,</b> this injury became a seminal point in his development: he learned to shoot with his off-hand, making him {{especially}} difficult to guard. He {{was one of the}} best—and the last—to use a two-handed set-shot with feet planted on the floor, before the game changed to one-handed jump shots.|$|R
500|$|As the whaling {{industry}} declined and the California Gold Rush gained {{prominence in}} the late 1840s, Hawaii's population dropped, and infectious disease epidemics contributed {{to the loss of}} local populations. The fort was restored in 1847 but was now used more as a prison than for defending the Kingdom. The cannons were rusting and the fort was mostly empty of personnel except for a few soldiers and the Governor of Maui who lived there. When Henry Augustus Wise visited in 1848, he met James Young (1797–1851), then Governor of Maui, who was living in the fort. [...] Wise wrote that it was: <b>an</b> <b>oddly</b> assorted battery of some thirty pieces of artillery, of all sorts of carriages and calibre—long, short, and mediums; they command the usual anchorage, and no doubt do very well to prevent any acts of violence from merchant ships; but it is a question, if, at the second discharge of shot, they do not tumble to pieces.|$|E
500|$|In Britain, 5 November has {{variously}} {{been called}} Guy Fawkes Night, Guy Fawkes Day, Plot Night and Bonfire Night; the latter {{can be traced}} directly {{back to the original}} celebration of 5 November 1605. Bonfires were accompanied by fireworks from the 1650s onwards, and it became the custom to burn an effigy (usually the pope) after 1673, when the heir presumptive, James, Duke of York, made his conversion to Catholicism public. [...] Effigies of other notable figures who have become targets for the public's ire, such as Paul Kruger and Margaret Thatcher, have also found their way onto the bonfires, although most modern effigies are of Fawkes. The [...] "guy" [...] is normally created by children, from old clothes, newspapers, and a mask. [...] During the 19th century, [...] "guy" [...] came to mean <b>an</b> <b>oddly</b> dressed person, but in American English it lost any pejorative connotation, and was used to refer to any male person.|$|E
500|$|Walter Joseph Kovacs / Rorschach: A vigilante {{who wears}} a white mask that {{contains}} a symmetrical but constantly shifting ink blot pattern, he continues to fight crime {{in spite of his}} outlaw status. Moore said he was trying to [...] "come up with this quintessential Steve Ditko character—someone who's got a funny name, whose surname begins with a 'K,' who's got <b>an</b> <b>oddly</b> designed mask". Moore based Rorschach on Ditko's creation Mr. A; Ditko's Charlton character The Question also served as a template for creating Rorschach. Comics historian Bradford W. Wright described the character's world view [...] "a set of black-and-white values that take many shapes but never mix into shades of gray, similar to the ink blot tests of his namesake". Rorschach sees existence as random and, according to Wright, this viewpoint leaves the character [...] "free to 'scrawl [...] own design' on a 'morally blank world. Moore said he did not foresee the death of Rorschach until the fourth issue when he realized that his refusal to compromise would result in him not surviving the story.|$|E
50|$|The unusual {{placement}} of this crater and {{the proximity of}} Green have given Hartmann <b>a</b> somewhat <b>oddly</b> shaped outer rim. The rim is slightly oblong in shape and it has an outward bulge to the east. The inner wall is wider on the eastern side, offsetting the interior floor to the western side. This floor is also oval in shape and is somewhat irregular.|$|R
60|$|Nevertheless, {{she did not}} utterly neglect {{her husband}} on that account. She rode to Kirk o' Field early in the evening, {{accompanied}} by Bothwell, Huntly, Argyll, and some others; and leaving the lords at cards below to while away the time, she repaired to Darnley, and sat beside his bed, soothing <b>a</b> spirit <b>oddly</b> perturbed, as if with some premonition of what was brewing.|$|R
50|$|The next 3-4 miles are {{remote and}} rugged. The trail {{is not always}} easy to follow and {{requires}} multiple crossings of the creek. At one point, after <b>a</b> large, <b>oddly</b> out of place palm tree, a rope had been placed for climbing a rock wall in order to further traverse the trail down the canyon. It should be noted that this has now been replaced with a much more navigable ladder.|$|R
