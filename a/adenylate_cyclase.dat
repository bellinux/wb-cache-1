5|$|ATP {{is also a}} {{substrate}} of <b>adenylate</b> <b>cyclase,</b> {{most commonly}} in G protein-coupled receptor signal transduction pathways and is transformed to second messenger, cyclic AMP, which is involved in triggering calcium signals by the release of calcium from intracellular stores. This form of signal transduction is particularly important in brain function, although it {{is involved in the}} regulation of a multitude of other cellular processes.|$|E
5|$|Enzymes with single-substrate {{mechanisms}} include isomerases such as triosephosphateisomerase or bisphosphoglycerate mutase, intramolecular lyases such as <b>adenylate</b> <b>cyclase</b> and the hammerhead ribozyme, an RNA lyase. However, {{some enzymes}} that {{only have a}} single substrate do not fall into this category of mechanisms. Catalase {{is an example of}} this, as the enzyme reacts with a first molecule of hydrogen peroxide substrate, becomes oxidised and is then reduced by a second molecule of substrate. Although a single substrate is involved, the existence of a modified enzyme intermediate means that the mechanism of catalase is actually a ping–pong mechanism, a type of mechanism that is discussed in the Multi-substrate reactions section below.|$|E
25|$|Further signal {{transduction}} {{depends on the}} type of G protein. The enzyme <b>adenylate</b> <b>cyclase</b> {{is an example of a}} cellular protein that can be regulated by a G protein, in this case the G protein Gs. <b>Adenylate</b> <b>cyclase</b> activity is activated when it binds to a subunit of the activated G protein. Activation of <b>adenylate</b> <b>cyclase</b> ends when the G protein returns to the GDP-bound state.|$|E
25|$|EF {{acts as a}} Ca2+ and calmodulin {{dependent}} <b>adenylate</b> <b>cyclase</b> that greatly {{increases the}} level of cAMP in the cell. This increase in cAMP upsets water homeostasis, severely throws the intracellular signaling pathways off balance, and impairs macrophage function, allowing the bacteria to further evade the immune system.|$|E
25|$|The {{actions of}} THC result from its partial agonist {{activity}} at the cannabinoid receptor CB1 (Ki=10nM), located mainly in the central nervous system, and the CB2 receptor (Ki=24nM), mainly expressed in cells of the immune system. The psychoactive effects of THC are primarily mediated by the activation of cannabinoid receptors, which result in {{a decrease in the}} concentration of the second messenger molecule cAMP through inhibition of <b>adenylate</b> <b>cyclase.</b>|$|E
25|$|Resting {{platelets}} maintain active calcium efflux via a cyclic AMP activated calcium pump. Intracellular calcium concentration determines {{platelet activation}} status, {{as it is}} the second messenger that drives platelet conformational change and degranulation (see below). Endothelial prostacyclin binds to prostanoid receptors on the surface of resting platelets. This event stimulates the coupled Gs protein to increase <b>adenylate</b> <b>cyclase</b> activity and increases the production of cAMP, further promoting the efflux of calcium and reducing intracellular calcium availability for platelet activation.|$|E
25|$|Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases (protein kinase A) are {{activated}} by the signal chain {{coming from the}} G protein (that was {{activated by}} the receptor) via <b>adenylate</b> <b>cyclase</b> and cyclic AMP (cAMP). In a feedback mechanism, these activated kinases phosphorylate the receptor. The longer the receptor remains active the more kinases are activated and the more receptors are phosphorylated. In β2-adrenoceptors, this phosphorylation results in the switching of the coupling from the Gs class of G-protein to the Gi class. cAMP-dependent PKA mediated phosphorylation can cause heterologous desensitisation in receptors other than those activated.|$|E
25|$|ADP on {{the other}} hand binds to purinergic receptors on {{platelet}} surface. Since the thrombocytic purinergic receptor P2Y12 is coupled to Gi proteins, ADP reduces platelet <b>adenylate</b> <b>cyclase</b> activity and cAMP production, leading to accumulation of calcium inside the platelet by inactivating the cAMP calcium efflux pump. The other ADP-receptor P2Y1 couples to Gq that activates phospholipase C-beta 2 PLCB2, resulting in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)generation and intracellular release of more calcium. This together induces platelet activation. Endothelial ADPase degrades ADP and prevents this from happening. Clopidogrel and related antiplatelet medications also work as purinergic receptor P2Y12 antagonists.|$|E
25|$|Misoprostol is {{used for}} the {{prevention}} of NSAID-induced gastric ulcers. It acts upon gastric parietal cells, inhibiting the secretion of gastric acid by G-protein coupled receptor-mediated inhibition of <b>adenylate</b> <b>cyclase,</b> which leads to decreased intracellular cyclic AMP levels and decreased proton pump activity at the apical surface of the parietal cell. Because other classes of drugs, especially H2-receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors, are more effective for the treatment of acute peptic ulcers, misoprostol is only indicated for use by people who are both taking NSAIDs and are at high risk for NSAID-induced ulcers, including the elderly and people with ulcer complications. Misoprostol is sometimes coprescribed with NSAIDs to prevent their common adverse effect of gastric ulceration (e.g. with diclofenac in Arthrotec).|$|E
25|$|The {{effector}} of {{both the}} Gαs and Gαi/o pathways is the cyclic-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-generating enzyme <b>adenylate</b> <b>cyclase,</b> or AC. While there are ten different AC gene products in mammals, each with subtle differences in tissue distribution or function, all catalyze the conversion of cytosolic adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cAMP, and all are directly stimulated by G-proteins of the Gαs class. In contrast, however, interaction with Gα subunits of the Gαi/o type inhibits AC from generating cAMP. Thus, a GPCR coupled to Gαs counteracts {{the actions of a}} GPCR coupled to Gαi/o, and vice versa. The level of cytosolic cAMP may then determine the activity of various ion channels as well as members of the ser/thr-specific protein kinase A (PKA) family. Thus cAMP is considered a second messenger and PKA a secondary effector.|$|E
25|$|For the cholera toxin, the {{principal}} glycolipid receptor for the cholera toxin is ganglioside GM1. After endocytosis to the golgi apparatus, the toxin is redirected to the endoplasmic reticulum. In {{order for the}} A subunit to reach its target, a disulfide bond between the A1 and A2 domain must be broken. This breakage is catalyzed by a protein disulfide isomerase {{that is in the}} endoplasmic reticulum. Following separation, the A1 domain unfolds and is redirected back to the cytosol where it refolds and catalyzes ADP-ribosylation of certain G protein alpha subunits. In doing so, the downstream effects of the G protein signal transduction pathway is disrupted by activating <b>adenylate</b> <b>cyclase.</b> This causes a higher concentration of cAMP in the cell, which disrupts the regulation of ion transport mechanisms.|$|E
25|$|In insects, synephrine {{has been}} found to be a very potent agonist at many {{invertebrate}} octopamine receptor preparations, and is even more potent than octopamine at a locust (Schistocerca americana gregaria) nerve-muscle preparation. Synephrine (racemic) is also more potent than octopamine (racemic) at inducing light-emission in the firefly (Photinus species) light organ. Synephrine exhibits similarly high potency in stimulating <b>adenylate</b> <b>cyclase</b> activity and in decreasing clotting time in lobster (Homarus americanus) hematocytes. Racemic synephrine was found to increase cAMP in the abdominal epidermis of the blood-sucking bug, Rhodnius prolixus. Rachinsky reported that synephrine was equipotent with octopamine in stimulating JH (juvenile hormone) release in the corpora allata of honey bee (Apis mellifera), but Woodring and Hoffmann found that synephrine had no effect on the synthesis of JH III, in in vitro preparations from the cricket, Gryllus bimaculatus.|$|E
500|$|Approximately 1 in 10 {{documented}} {{cases of}} hyperparathyroidism {{are a result}} of hereditary factors. Disorders such as familial hyperparathyroidism, multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN Type 1) and hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome can, if left unchecked, result in OFC. MEN Type 1 is an autosomal dominant disorder and the most common hereditary form of hyperparathyroidism, affecting about 95% of genetic cases of OFC, and also tends to affect younger patients than other forms. Major mutations which can lead to hyperparathyroidism generally involve the parathyroid hormone receptor, G proteins, or <b>adenylate</b> <b>cyclase.</b> [...] Certain genetic mutations have been linked to a higher rate of parathyroid carcinoma occurrence, specifically mutations to the gene HRPT2, which codes for the protein parafibromin.|$|E

2500|$|The {{connection}} between dopamine and psychosis is generally believed complex. [...] While dopamine receptor D2 suppresses <b>adenylate</b> <b>cyclase</b> activity, the [...] D1 receptor increases it. [...] If D2-blocking drugs are administered the blocked dopamine spills {{over to the}} D1 receptors. The increased <b>adenylate</b> <b>cyclase</b> activity affects genetic expression in the nerve cell, which takes time. Hence antipsychotic drugs take {{a week or two}} to reduce the symptoms of psychosis. Moreover, newer and equally effective antipsychotic drugs actually block slightly less dopamine in the brain than older drugs whilst also blocking 5-HT2A receptors, suggesting the 'dopamine hypothesis' may be oversimplified. Soyka and colleagues found no evidence of dopaminergic dysfunction in people with alcohol-induced psychosis and [...] Zoldan et al. reported moderately successful use of ondansetron, a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, in the treatment of levodopa psychosis in Parkinson's disease patients.|$|E
2500|$|... β receptors {{have the}} subtypes β1, β2 and β3. All three {{are linked to}} Gs {{proteins}} (although β2 also couples to Gi), which in turn are linked to <b>adenylate</b> <b>cyclase.</b> Agonist binding thus causes {{a rise in the}} intracellular concentration of the second messenger cAMP. [...] Downstream effectors of cAMP include cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), which mediates some of the intracellular events following hormone binding. Isoprenaline is a non-selective agonist.|$|E
2500|$|Apomorphine is an agonist, or activator, of both D1 and D2 type {{dopamine}} receptors with {{a preference}} toward the D2 group. [...] The {{members of the}} D2 subfamily, consisting of D2, D3, and D4 receptors, are involved with inhibitory neurotransmission. [...] Inhibition is achieved through a signaling pathway in which the activated receptor, a G protein–coupled receptor, inhibits the enzyme <b>adenylate</b> <b>cyclase,</b> therefore decreasing the levels of the signaling molecule cyclic AMP.|$|E
2500|$|Yeasts contain {{three main}} {{elements}} {{that are associated with}} actin: patches, cables and rings that, despite being present for long, are subject to a dynamic equilibrium due to continual polymerization and depolymerization. [...] They possess a number of accessory proteins including ADF/cofilin, which has a molecular weight of 16kDa and is coded for by a single gene, called COF1; Aip1, a cofilin cofactor that promotes the disassembly of microfilaments; Srv2/CAP, a process regulator related to <b>adenylate</b> <b>cyclase</b> proteins; a profilin with a molecular weight of approximately 14 kDa that is associated with actin monomers; and twinfilin, a 40 kDa protein involved in the organization of patches.|$|E
2500|$|Muscarinic {{acetylcholine}} receptors have a {{more complex}} mechanism, and affect target cells over a longer time frame. In mammals, five subtypes of muscarinic receptors have been identified, labeled M1 through M5. All of them function as G protein-coupled receptors, meaning that they exert their effects via a second messenger system. The M1, M3, and M5 subtypes are Gq-coupled; they increase intracellular levels of IP3 and calcium by activating phospholipase C. [...] Their effect on target cells is usually excitatory. [...] The M2 and M4 subtypes are Gi/Go-coupled; they decrease intracellular levels of cAMP by inhibiting <b>adenylate</b> <b>cyclase.</b> [...] Their effect on target cells is usually inhibitory. [...] Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors are found in both {{the central nervous system}} and the peripheral nervous system of the heart, lungs, upper gastrointestinal tract, and sweat glands.|$|E
2500|$|Sweetness, usually {{regarded}} as a pleasurable sensation, is produced {{by the presence of}} sugars and a few other substances. Sweetness is often connected to aldehydes and ketones, which contain a carbonyl group. Sweetness is detected by a variety of G protein coupled receptors coupled to the G protein gustducin found on the taste buds. At least two different variants of the [...] "sweetness receptors" [...] must be activated for the brain to register sweetness. Compounds the brain senses as sweet are thus compounds that can bind with varying bond strength to two different sweetness receptors. These receptors are T1R2+3 (heterodimer) and T1R3 (homodimer), which account for all sweet sensing in humans and animals. Taste detection thresholds for sweet substances are rated relative to sucrose, which has an index of 1. The average human detection threshold for sucrose is 10 millimoles per liter. For lactose it is 30 millimoles per liter, with a sweetness index of 0.3, and 5-Nitro-2-propoxyaniline 0.002 millimoles per liter. “Natural” sweeteners such as saccharides activate the GPCR, which releases gustducin. The gustducin then activates the molecule <b>adenylate</b> <b>cyclase,</b> which catalyzes the production of the molecule cAMP, or adenosine 3', 5'-cyclic monophosphate. This molecule closes potassium ion channels, leading to depolarization and neurotransmitter release. Synthetic sweeteners such as saccharin activate different GPCRs and induce taste receptor cell depolarization by an alternate pathway.|$|E
50|$|Cyclic AMP is {{synthesized}} from ATP by <b>adenylate</b> <b>cyclase</b> {{located on}} the inner side of the plasma membrane and anchored at various locations in the interior of the cell. <b>Adenylate</b> <b>cyclase</b> is activated by a range of signaling molecules through the activation of <b>adenylate</b> <b>cyclase</b> stimulatory G (Gs)-protein-coupled receptors. <b>Adenylate</b> <b>cyclase</b> is inhibited by agonists of <b>adenylate</b> <b>cyclase</b> inhibitory G (Gi)-protein-coupled receptors. Liver <b>adenylate</b> <b>cyclase</b> responds more strongly to glucagon, and muscle <b>adenylate</b> <b>cyclase</b> responds more strongly to adrenaline.|$|E

VIPR2 transduction results in upregulation of <b>adenylate</b> <b>cyclase</b> activity. Furthermore, VIPR2 mediates the anti-inflammatory effects of VIP.|$|E
50|$|It {{may also}} be present in hypomagnesemia, Magnesium is a {{cofactor}} for <b>Adenylate</b> <b>cyclase.</b> The reaction that <b>Adenylate</b> <b>cyclase</b> catalyzes is the conversion of ATP to 3',5'-cyclic AMP. The 3',5'-cyclic AMP (cAMP) is required for parathyroid hormone activation. It is frequently seen in alcoholics, persons with diarrhea, patients taking aminoglycosides or diuretics, because hypomagnesemia can cause hypocalcemia. It is also seen in measles, tetanus and myxedema.|$|E
50|$|The C-terminal {{domain of}} the <b>adenylate</b> <b>cyclase</b> toxin (ACT or CyaA; TC# 1.C.11.1.4) of Bordetella {{pertussis}} forms a small cation-selective channel, disrupting the permeability barrier. This channel probably delivers the N-terminal <b>adenylate</b> <b>cyclase</b> to the host cell cytoplasm. Mutations in residues in an amphipathic α-helix (Glu509 and Glu516) in the pore-forming domain block <b>adenylate</b> <b>cyclase</b> translocation and modulate cation selectivity of the membrane channel. ACT does not use a protein receptor and inserts into liposomes. Phosphatidylethanolamine and cholesterol stimulate ACT insertion. ACT also promotes lipid flip-flop suggesting that ACT forms trans-bilayer nonlamellar lipid structures when it inserts into the membrane. CyaA may form {{two different types of}} pore-like structures, dependent on the orientation of the membrane potential and the pH.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to actin-binding, CAPs can have additional roles, and may act as bifunctional proteins. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker's yeast), CAP is {{a component of}} the adenylyl cyclase complex (Cyr1p) that serves as an effector of Ras during normal cell signalling. S. cerevisiae CAP functions to expose <b>adenylate</b> <b>cyclase</b> binding sites to Ras, thereby enabling <b>adenylate</b> <b>cyclase</b> to be activated by Ras regulatory signals. In Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Fission yeast), CAP is also required for <b>adenylate</b> <b>cyclase</b> activity, but not through the Ras pathway. In both organisms, the N-terminal domain is responsible for <b>adenylate</b> <b>cyclase</b> activation, but the S. cerevisiae and S. pombe N-termini cannot complement one another. Yeast CAPs are unique among the CAP family of proteins, because they are the only ones to directly interact with and activate <b>adenylate</b> <b>cyclase.</b> S. cerevisiae CAP has four major domains. In {{addition to}} the N-terminal adenylate cyclase-interacting domain, and the C-terminal actin-binding domain, it possesses two other domains: a proline-rich domain that interacts with Src homology 3 (SH3) domains of specific proteins, and a domain that is responsible for CAP oligomerisation to form multimeric complexes (although oligomerisation appears to involve the N- and C-terminal domains as well). The proline-rich domain interacts with profilin, a protein that catalyses nucleotide exchange on G-actin monomers and promotes addition to barbed ends of filamentous F-actin. Since CAP can bind profilin via a proline-rich domain, and G-actin via a C-terminal domain, {{it has been suggested that}} a ternary G-actin/CAP/profilin complex could be formed.|$|E
