Days later, {{he spoke in}} opposition to increasing a subsidy to the Collins Line for carrying trans-Atlantic mail, noting that Collins profited by carrying passengers and cargo on mail ships. In wartime, the government could commandeer and retrofit Collins's steamboats as warships, but Breckinridge cited Commodore Matthew C. Perry's opinion {{that they would be}} useless in war. Finally, he showed Cornelius Vanderbilt's written statement promising to build a fleet of mail ships at his expense and carry the mail for $4 million less than Collins. Despite this, the House approved the subsidy increase.|$|E
5|$|Following Roy's {{departure}} in 1995, the Canadiens {{fell into}} an extended stretch of mediocrity, missing {{the playoffs in}} four of their next ten seasons and failing to advance past {{the second round of}} the playoffs until 2010. By the late 1990s, with both <b>an</b> <b>ailing</b> team and monetary losses exacerbated by a record-low value of the Canadian dollar, Montreal fans feared their team would end up relocated to the United States. Team owner Molson Brewery sold control of the franchise and the Molson Centre to American businessman George N. Gillett Jr. in 2001, with the right of first refusal for any future sale by Gillett and a condition that the NHL Board of Governors must unanimously approve any attempt to move to a new city. Led by president Pierre Boivin, the Canadiens returned to being a lucrative enterprise, earning additional revenues from broadcasting and arena events. In 2009, Gillett sold the franchise to a consortium led by the Molson family which included The Woodbridge Company, BCE/Bell, the QFL Solidarity Fund, Michael Andlauer, Luc Bertrand and the National Bank Financial Group for $575million, more than double the $275million he spent on the purchase eight years prior.|$|E

5|$|Halotus, as the Emperor's {{official}} taster, {{would probably}} have {{had a role in}} the plot, deceiving Claudius into believing the food was safe to consume. He is a prime suspect because he would have had access to everything eaten by the Emperor on the night of his death. It has been suggested that Halotus may have been the murderer but was working under orders of Agrippina. While it is uncertain whether Halotus would have had anything to gain from the death of the Emperor, Agrippina's political and personal advantage gained by the death of her husband was evident; with Claudius dead, Nero, Agrippina's biological son, would be able to claim the throne. It was also known that the animosity between Agrippina and Claudius had grown during the months preceding the homicide. Other notable suspects included Locusta, a professional poisoner, and Xenophon, Claudius' royal physician, who, in line with the suggestion that the poison was not immediately fatal, is said to have carried <b>an</b> <b>ailing</b> Claudius out of the banquet, taken him to his room and forced a poisoned feather into his mouth on the pretence of encouraging him to regurgitate. Others say Xenophon used poisoned gruel.|$|E
5|$|Michigan lost to Purdue on January 3, {{by making}} only 4 second half field goals after taking an 8-point half time lead. The team {{defeated}} Penn State on January 6 with Albrecht {{in the starting}} lineup in place of Chatman. On January 10, the team wore throwback uniforms honoring the 1988–89 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team that won the 1989 NCAA Tournament. Michigan was down 49–40 with less than nine minutes remaining, before coming back to defeat Minnesota by a margin of 62–57. Michigan lost to (Receiving votes/#25) Ohio State on January 13. On January 17 Michigan defeated Northwestern, but lost LeVert for the season after he reinjured the foot that he had had surgery on the prior May. In the game, Muhammad-Ali Abdur-Rahkman made his first start (in place of <b>an</b> <b>ailing</b> Albrecht) and made the game winning three-point shot. At the time of his injury, LeVert led Michigan in scoring (14.9), rebounds (4.9), assists (3.7), steals (1.7) and minutes (35.8). Nonetheless, the team defeated Rutgers in its first game without LeVert and with Dawkins making his first start. With LeVert absent, Walton scored 10 of the team's 15 points as it rallied from a 42–37 deficit to assume a 52–44 lead with just 32.5 seconds left. On January 24, Michigan fell to (AP #6/Coaches #5) Wisconsin in overtime after Walton, who had a team-high 17 points, scored Michigan's final seven points, including a game-tying three point shot with 1.3 seconds remaining in regulation. The game had been the featured College GameDay game of the week. On January 27 with Walton and Mark Donnal sidelined Michigan defeated Nebraska, as Irvin recorded his first career double-double, leading the team with 14 points and a career-high 12 rebounds. Eventually, Walton missed final 12 of the season due to a toe injury. Due to the backcourt injuries, Dakich burned his redshirt season. Michigan finished the first half of its conference schedule with a 6–3 record.|$|E

40|$|Two Yersinia enterocolitica genes, inv and <b>ail,</b> play <b>a</b> {{major role}} in the ability of this {{microorganism}} to enter cultured mammalian cells. ail-homologous sequences are present only in pathogenic species and strains of Yersinia. We previously demonstrated (D. E. Pierson and S. Falkow, Infect. Immun. 58 : 1059 - 1064, 1990) that four different nonpathogenic isolates of Y. enterocolitica are not able to invade tissue culture cells because they contain functionally inactive variants of the inv gene. When a functional version was introduced into these strains, they became invasive. In this study, we introduced <b>a</b> functional <b>ail</b> gene into the same strains and found that the ail gene was expressed but that these strains neither adhere to nor invade cultured animal cells. However, these recombinant strains became resistant to killing by human serum, whereas their parental strains were not. Using <b>an</b> <b>ail</b> mutant, we also demonstrate that the <b>ail</b> gene has <b>a</b> role in both invasion/adherence and serum resistance in a pathogenic isolate of Y. enterocolitica.
