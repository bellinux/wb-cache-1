5|$|Between Kintbury Lock and Newbury, passing to {{the north}} of Hamstead Marshall, the canal is very close to the River Kennet, which flows into the canal via several channels. The canal passes through an area known as the Kennet Valley Alderwoods, the largest {{remaining}} fragments of damp, <b>ash-alder</b> woodland in the River Kennet floodplain. The SSSI includes two woods– the Wilderness and part of Ryott's Plantation– which are important because they support a very great diversity of plants associated with this woodland type, dominated by alder (Alnus glutinosa); though ash (Fraxinus excelsior) is abundant in places and there is occasional oak (Quercus robur) and wych elm (Ulmus glabra). In addition to the wide range of higher plants the woods support a diverse bryophyte flora including the uncommon epiphytes Radula complanata, Zygodon viridissimus and Orthotrichum affine. Nearby is Irish Hill Copse. This site of coppiced ancient woodland includes an extensive area of calcareous ash/wych elm coppice on the hill sides, merging into wet ash/maple and acid oak/ash/hazel woodland with aspen, on the higher parts of the site. The lower slopes are dominated by dog's mercury (Mercurialis perennis), with abundant herb paris (Paris quadrifolia), toothwort (Lathraea squamaria), Solomon's seal (Polygonatum multiflorum), twayblade and early purple orchids (Listera ovata) and Orchis mascula and, locally, wild daffodil (Narcissus pseudonarcissus).|$|E

40|$|Changes of the {{groundwater}} {{levels in the}} area of clearcutting in a swampy habitat and moist mixed broadleaved forest are analysed in the paper. The aim of the research is to evaluate the influence of clearcutting on the amount of changes in groundwater levels. The research was carried out in two forestries located on the southern tip of Greater Poland, belonging to Siemianice Experimental Forest Farm. The analysis is based on data from wells located in <b>ash-alder</b> swamp forest in Marianka forestry and moist broadleaved forest in Laski forestry. The research is based on the relation of groundwater levels in wells located in clearcutting and observation wells. The received relationship of groundwater levels helps estimate changes in groundwater table, depending on its depth before clearcutting. The research shows increases of groundwater levels {{in the area of}} clearcutting. Increments are significantly higher in moist broadleaved forest than in <b>ash-alder</b> swamp forest...|$|E
40|$|Goričko Landscape Park is a well-preserved {{example of}} typical Central-Europeanagricultural landscape. We used {{modified}} PHYSIS typology {{to describe and}} classify different habitat types (HT), especially the riparian stream corridors and patches (RSCP) -habitats of riparian woody stands occurring outside the closed woodland. The RSCP of Goričko were categorized into 107 HT, which cover 1. 35 % of the 45, 000 ha in Goričko. The <b>ash-alder</b> vegetation is the most widespread riparian HT. For the detailed analysis, we compared two similar areas that differ only in land-use intensity. RSCP showed slightly higher fractal dimension and significantly higher elongation index in more intensified area B. The analysis of RSCP types on these areas showed a shift, accompanying increased agricultural impact, from pure stands to mixed, from trees to scrub, from <b>ash-alder</b> and white willow stands to mixed riverine willow stands. The course of the intensification produced two results: arable HT were united into large, homogeneous polygons, while less usable land was abandoned. We can conclude {{that some of the}} landscape characteristics we used can be applied to detect the level of preserved traditional cultural landscape...|$|E
40|$|Extensive {{investigation}} of ash dieback impact on different rural vegetation types (solitaires, scattered plantations, riparian stands, scree- and <b>ash-alder</b> alluvial forests) {{was performed in}} the Lusatian Mts. (the Czech Republic) between 2011 and 2013. The rate of ash dieback and 27 environmental variables were investigated in 80 research plots {{with a total of}} 1045 evaluated trees. The developed model (GLM) explained ca 27 % of the disease variability. Particular models for each vegetation type importantly differed from each other and explained 28 [...] 46 % of the disease variability. The variables that positively affected the disease impact included the host crown area, ash area and rate of ash in the stands, tree layer area, canopy closure, north aspect, shrub and herbaceous layer canopy, vertical heterogeneity and standard deviation of TPI. Tree height, the distance and damage of the nearest host as well as the water source distance, slope and its standard deviation affected it negatively. The coincidental attack of the trees by Armillaria sp. and Hylesinus fraxini positively affected the disease progress, whereas the presence of Nectria sp. and Aceria fraxinivorus conclusively decreased progress, most likely via the induction of secondary metabolites. The highly conclusive regression of ash dieback on the number of days with an air humidity of > 95 % between 6 [...] 11 a. m. in the main period of ascospore spread was identified. Because the air humidity near the ground was highly affected by local factors, a GLM model explaining the variability of air humidity with that of investigated factors was developed. This model explained 77 % of the variability attributed to air humidity, local factors (TPI and SD of TPI, aspect, slope, altitude, distance from open water, tree and shrub layers canopy, tree stand height, etc.) greatly affected the disease impact related to air humidity. The landscape form was identified as a factor (most likely via air humidity) that affects the impact of the disease [...] for example, the stands on mountain tops and slopes were less affected than the stands in valleys. The vegetation types highly differed in the disease extent. In general, the solitaires and scree forests were significantly less damaged than mixed <b>ash-alder</b> forests and riparian stands. The smaller stands were less affected than the more extended, the stands enclosed in canopy of other forests were less damaged than comparable vegetation in open landscapes and stands with higher humidity (riparian stands and mixed <b>ash-alder</b> forests) were more damaged than those without water. The outcome clearly supports the possibility of development and usefulness of appropriate forest and landscape management of the disease...|$|E
40|$|Abies alba and Senecio rivularis - two of 44 {{mountain}} species {{reported from}} the Roztocze Highlands, SE Poland were objects of the study. Both species reach the north-eastern {{limits of their}} occurrence in this region. In case of Abies alba, the extent of its habitat niche and possibility of adaptation to alternative niches at the range limits were investigated in two areas of the Roztocze Highlands - the Roztocze National Park (RNP) and gorge sections of four river valleys (RV) of a mountainous character. In both landscapes, fir prefers mineral soils that are too leachy for deciduous species and even for spruce. In the RV sites, fir {{seems to have a}} much broader ecological scale and often colonizes organic soils with wet mixed coniferous forests with spruce, <b>ash-alder,</b> and bog alder forests...|$|E
40|$|We {{explored}} {{patterns of}} land snail assemblages using 93 alluvial forest sites in six river floodplains of the Elbe drainage basin (northwestern Bohemia, Czech Republic). Differences in species richness and composition across the four floodplain forest types (i. e., alder carrs, <b>ash-alder</b> forests, willow-poplar softwood forests, and hardwood forests) were analysed using generalized linear models, multidimensional scaling and redundancy analysis with the Monte Carlo permutation test. The studied floodplain forest types {{did not differ}} in species richness, except for the alder carrs which were significantly poorer. The number of species expressed a significant unimodal response along with elevation and Ellenberg nutrients, and further significantly decreased towards the most humid sites. Contrary to species richness, the main forest types clearly differed based on land snail species composition, {{with the exception of the}} <b>ash-alder</b> and willow-poplar forest sites which became completely overlapped in the ordination space. The main changes in species composition were mostly associated with elevation and Ellenberg moisture on the first MDS axis: Ellenberg nutrients and light were fitted on the second and the third axes, respectively. These variables, along with calcium content estimated using Ellenberg indicator values for soil reaction, had significant effects on the variation and snail species composition in the final RDA model. No response of either species richness or compositional changes was found for the measured content of topsoil calcium, most likely due to the higher importance of other variables. On the basis of some recently published data we can conclude that historical development and long-term human activities on the succession of floodplain assemblages have resulted in a sharp impoverishment of strictly land snail species of several hardwood forest sites in the majority of lower river stretches. Whilst in most areas there are no exact palaeoecological data available, these historical influences were closely correlated with the site elevation in our dataset as the main difference in species composition was hard to explain solely using environmental predictors...|$|E
40|$|Using soil {{sampling}} and subsequent heat extraction of animals, four alder {{stands in the}} wetlands of the Biebrza, Narew and BiałowieŜa national parks, north-eastern Poland, were surveyed for millipedes and centipedes. Among 12 millipede species revealed, Xestoiulus laeticollis, Polydesmus complanatus and Craspedosoma rawlinsii occurred and predominated in all alder woods. The centipede fauna was very poor, altogether represented by four species, only Lithobius curtipes being shared by all sites. The myriapod communities from the swampy alder woods (Ribeso nigri-Alnetum) at Biebrza and in the BiałowieŜa Primeval Forest were mainly {{under the influence of}} fertility soil parameters (available and total phosphorus contents) while the assemblage from an alder swamp at Narew was largely affected by soil humidity. Apparently, the community from an <b>ash-alder</b> alluvial wood (Fraxino-Alnetum) sampled in the BiałowieŜa Primeval Forest mostly depended on soil pH. Comparing all available information, the structure of myriapod assemblages seems to be quite similar even over distant regions in Central Europe...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{demonstrates}} {{the classification of}} the riparian alder forests of the Alpokalja region through the analysis of their stan ds in the Sopron Hills. Besides the historical, ecological and floristic data collection, the diffe rentiation of these forests was examined using 36 coenological relevés recorded according to the B raun-Blanquet method. Cluster analysis, principal component analysis and TWINSPAN analysis were applied in the process; the definition of diagnostic species for the resulting units was c arried out by fidelity analysis using the Ф coefficient. The presence of three alder forest as sociations was verified by the research in the study area. In {{the vicinity of the}} lower and middle sections of the streams, characterized by stagnant water, small patches of swampy alder fores ts (Angelico sylvestris – Alnetum glutinosae) occur. In the fast-flowing stream sections alder wo ods rich in species of mesophilic deciduous forests (Aegopodio – Alnetum glutinosae) can be found, while along the middle and upper se ctions of the streams, at sites with seepage water, mixed <b>ash-alder</b> forests with montane herb species (Carici remotae – Fraxinetum) are typical. The investigations revealed that the Carex brizoides dominance-type alder groves were secondary forests that formed in former meadows and they belong to the 3 mentioned riparian alder forest typ es...|$|E
40|$|The {{contribution}} of {{four types of}} secondary woodlands to Scottish invertebrate biodiversity was investigated for coniferous plantation forestry, riparian <b>ash-alder</b> woodlands, early successional deciduous woodlands and climax deciduous woodlands. Considerable variation in the type and intensity of management within these four woodland types existed. Adult Diptera from 21 families, representing diverse trophic and ecological guilds, were sampled from 31 woodlands in the Aberdeenshire region of northeast Scotland, between June and August 2001. Environmental differences between woodlands were recorded at each site using environmental parameters such as pH and organic matter content, vegetation characteristics, including percentage canopy cover and dominant field layer plant species. Multivariate ordination techniques detected significant responses in the Dipteran communities to soil type, organic matter content, soil pH, field layer plant species richness, dominant field layer plant species and percentage cover of Pteridium aquilinum. Responses in terms of Dipteran abundance, species richness, diversity and evenness were observed to soil type and dominant species of the field layer vegetation. The role of woodland type and management in diversifying Diptera communities is discussed {{with a view to}} maintain and possibly enhance Dipteran and other invertebrate communities in Scottish secondary woodlands.

40|$|The ‘Czmoń’ {{nature reserve}} was {{established}} in 1998 to protect oak-hornbeam forest (Galio sylvatici-Carpinetum betuli) – a plant community rare in the Wielkopolska region. The reserve covers the area of 23. 65 ha of forest in which also other plant communities rare in this region are found (Querco-Ulmetum minoris and Fraxino-Alnetum). Both communities of natural character, as well as degenerated communities, {{can be found in}} this reserve. This {{can be attributed to the}} type of forest management conducted in this area earlier. The objective of this study was to characterise the stand structure and species composition in this reserve and to trace potential changes in stands resulting from the abandonment of treatments associated with forest management. On potential forest sites of oak-hornbeam forest, elm-oak riparian forest and <b>ash-alder</b> riparian forest, forest communities at different stages of development and forms of degeneration are found to occur. On the basis of the species composition analysis of the undergrowth layer, the quantity of dead trees and shrubs, as well as the DBH distribution of living trees, we found an advancing process of regeneration in the direction of communities complying with potential vegetation. The highest proportion of dead trees was determined among those tree species growing in the reserve which were site (Pinus sylvestris) or geographically (Populus canadensis, Fagus sylvatica) alien for this particular area. In the undergrowth layer, a domination of oak-hornbeam forest and riparian forest tree species (primarily Carpinus betulus and Acer pseudoplatanus) was recorded. Absence of pedunculate oak (Quercus robur), as well as massive dying out of ash (Fraxinus excelsior) occurring in the undergrowth layer is perplexing...|$|E
40|$|The {{break section}} of the Szum river and the mouth part of its left tributary, Miedzianka (Roztocze, SE Poland) were {{the object of the}} {{research}} conducted in the years 1999 - 2001. The aim {{of the study was to}} establish the abiotic conditions of the diversity of vegetation and the richness of vascular flora in a small lowland river valley. A real vegetation map was drawn in the scale 1 : 5000. The syntaxonomic classification of plant communities and habitat trophism were established on the basis of 120 phytosociological relevés and 160 soil samples, respectively. On the area of barely 35. 4 ha identified were 48 plant associations and communities representing 11 phytosociological classes, among them habitats protected in Poland (16 types) and important at the EU scale (3). There were found 378 species of 72 families, including: 21 species under strict protection, 9 under partial protection, 25 plants threatened on the regional scale, and 2 included into the Polish Red Data Book. Most of interesting species and non-forest communities occur in the parts of the valley above and below a landscape reserve 'Szum', established in 1958, covering presently 18. 17 ha. The greatest floral richness was found in the peatbog-meadow complexes (Phragmitetea, Molinio-Arrhenatheretea, Scheuchzerio-Caricetea), in bog-alder forests and willow bushes (Alnetea glutinosae), and streamline <b>ash-alder</b> carrs (Querco-Fagetea, Alno-Ulmion), while the smallest - in the pine and poorer upland mixed fir forests (Vaccinio-Piceetea). Vascular flora appears to be the richest in the sections of the valley where the bottom is overgrown by non-forest communities. The results of the study indicate that it is necessary to enlarge the area of the existing nature reserve...|$|E
40|$|The {{composition}} {{and structure of}} the breeding bird community in the Borki Forest in north-eastern Poland were investigated during two separate periods: 1994 – 1996 and 2012 – 2014. Bird censuses were carried out in three plots located in mature oak-hornbeam, <b>ash-alder</b> and mixed coniferous forest stands. A standard combined mapping technique for estimating the number of breeding birds was applied. A total of 74 bird species bred at least once within any plot during 1994 – 1996 or 2012 – 2014. The structure of the bird assemblages on particular plots displayed a high degree of similarity, exceeding 75 %, which means that they represent essentially the same bird community. However, the investigated assemblages have changed substantially over the 20 years. Both, the number of breeding bird species and the population densities on all plots, were much higher in 2012 – 2014 than in 1994 – 1996. The mean number of breeding species on all plots was over 50 % higher in 2012 – 2014 than in 1994 – 1996, whereas the mean total density of breeding pairs increased by more than 60 %. Total population densities on the plots increased {{as a result of an}} increase in population densities of individual bird species combined with an increase in the number of breeding species. Due to different rates of population growth for certain species, also the composition of dominating species group have changed. The observed changes in the avifauna of the Borki Forest were most probably due to an enrichment of the forest habitats structure, which was caused by natural factors, such as ageing of forest stands, forest succession and a change in water regime by beaver dams, as well as by forest management, including group felling within or in the vicinity of plots and uncovering of the forest edge...|$|E
