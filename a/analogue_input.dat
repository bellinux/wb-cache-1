2500|$|During {{adventure}} segments, Shinjiro {{can both}} navigate New York {{on his own}} and bring along a member of the New York Combat Revue. During these sequences, when talking with both the main heroines and supporting characters, conversations rely on the LIPS (Live & Interactive Picture System) system. When faced with critical choices {{in the course of a}} conversation, up to three dialogue options are displayed with a time limit for the player to select a response. Depending on the type of response, the character may respond positively or negatively, impacting the relationship and future interactions. An additional [...] "Analog LIPS" [...] option has a single response with <b>analogue</b> <b>input</b> which changes the intensity of Shinjiro's voice, which further affects characters' reactions. Other actions within LIPS include holding the cursor over parts of a character's portrait to trigger internal monologues and varying responses from the characters, and quick time events relying on moving the control sticks and button inputs. If Shinjiro has a strong-enough bond with one of the heroines, he can initiate a romance, unlocking a character-specific ending once the main story is finished. When exploring New York, Shinjiro can access a device called the Cameratron, a device which can both be used as a communication device with members of the Little Lips Theater and take photographs around the city.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION There {{are several}} {{advantageous}} with analogue implementations of neural networks. The main one is, of course, that most signal sensors generate analogue signals. Several years ago Intel introduced the Electrically Trainable Neural Network, ETANN i 80170 NX [1 - 4], {{with a fairly}} conventional back-propagation (BP) algorithm and a processing time of a few micro seconds. The main disadvantageous of the analogue implementations are the relatively low precision (12 %), the sensitivity to noise {{and the fact that}} one generally requires some post-processing of the outputs from the neural networks. This is generally performed using some von Neumann computer, i. e a digital machine. Pulse Coupled neural Networks, PCNN, [5 - 10] could easily be implemented as hybrid circuits, i. e. an <b>analogue</b> <b>input</b> and a digital output. One would simply have an <b>analogue</b> <b>input</b> to the circuit and make use of the inherent feature that the output is a temporal series of binary images. However, as has be...|$|E
