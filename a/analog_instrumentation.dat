When used to measure radial runout, the stylus is fitted to a large-area paddle that can span the voids in the tread pattern. When used to measure lateral runout on the sidewall the stylus runs in a very narrow smooth track. The contact stylus method is one of the earliest technologies, and requires considerable effort to maintain its mechanical performance.

"Hard realtime applications" signifies applications, like real-time radar signal processing, in which the data to be processed are generated at "hundreds" of pulses per second, each pulse "requiring" millions of arithmetic operations. In these applications, the digital processors must be tightly integrated with <b>analog</b> <b>instrumentation</b> (e. g., radar equipment), and data input/output must be synchronized with <b>analog</b> <b>instrumentation,</b> controlled to within fractions of a microsecond. The scalable multiprocessor is a cluster of identical commercial-off-the-shelf generic DSP (digital-signal-processing) computers plus generic interface circuits, including analog-to-digital converters, all controlled by software. The processors are computers interconnected by high-speed serial links. Performance can be increased by adding hardware modules and correspondingly modifying the software.

40|$|Electrical signals {{produced}} {{in the human body}} can be used for medical diagnosis and research, treatment of diseases, pilot safety etc. These signals are extracted using an electrode (or transducer) to convert the ion current in the body to electron current. After the electrode, the very low amplitude extracted signal is amplified by an analog frontend that typically consists of an instrumentation amplifier (IA), a programmable gain amplifier (PGA), and a low pass filter (LPF). The output of the analog frontend is converted to digital signal by an analog to digital converter (ADC) for subsequent processing in the digital domain. 	This thesis discusses the circuit design challenges of the <b>analog</b> frontend <b>instrumentation</b> amplifier, compares existing circuit topologies used to implement the IA and proposes a new frontend IA. The proposed circuit uses the Current Balancing Instrumentation Amplifier (CBIA) topology to achieve high gain accuracy over a wide range of the output impedance. In addition it uses common circuit design techniques such as chopper modulation to achieve low flicker noise corner frequency, high common mode rejection (CMRR) and low noise efficiency factor (NEF). The proposed circuit has been implemented in the 0. 5 um CMOS ON-semiconductor process and consumes 16 uW of power.

40|$|Historically, <b>instrumentation</b> <b>analog</b> tape based data {{recorders}} did {{not have}} a built- in data multiplexer, {{due to the nature of}} multiple track capability. Digital tape based recorders have been available with and without built- in data multiplexers.

This paper describes a distributed data multiplexer and recording system, acquiring data from high-speed avionics data busses (Optical Fibre Channel and 1394 B), PCM, wideband analog, video, and others.

40|$|A {{prototype}} wireless acoustic {{measurement system}} (WAMS) {{is one of}} two main subsystems of the Acoustic Prediction/ Measurement Tool, which comprises software, acoustic instrumentation, and electronic hardware combined to afford integrated capabilities for predicting and measuring noise emitted by rocket and jet engines. The other main subsystem is described in the article on page 8. The WAMS includes <b>analog</b> acoustic measurement <b>instrumentation</b> and <b>analog</b> and digital electronic circuitry combined with computer wireless local-area networking to enable (1) measurement of sound-pressure levels at multiple locations in the sound field of an engine under test and (2) recording and processing of the measurement data. At each field location, the measurements are taken by a portable unit, denoted a field station. There are ten field stations, each of which can take two channels of measurements. Each field station is equipped with two instrumentation microphones, a micro- ATX computer, a wireless network adapter, an environmental enclosure, a directional radio antenna, and a battery power supply. The environmental enclosure shields the computer from weather and from extreme acoustically induced vibrations. The power supply is based on a marine-service lead-acid storage battery that has enough capacity to support operation for as long as 10 hours. A desktop computer serves as a control server for the WAMS. The server is connected to a wireless router for communication with the field stations via a wireless local-area network that complies with wireless-network standard 802. 11 b of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. The router and the wireless network adapters are controlled by use of Linux-compatible driver software. The server runs custom Linux software for synchronizing the recording of measurement data in the field stations. The software includes a module that provides an intuitive graphical user interface through which an operator at the control server can control the operations of the field stations for calibration and for recording of measurement data. A test engineer positions and activates the WAMS. The WAMS automatically establishes the wireless network. Next, the engineer performs pretest calibrations. Then the engineer executes the test and measurement procedures. After the test, the raw measurement files are copied and transferred, through the wireless network, to a hard disk in the control server.
