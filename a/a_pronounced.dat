Analysis of the cross-sectional shape of the galaxy appears to demonstrate <b>a</b> <b>pronounced,</b> S-shaped warp, rather than just a flat disk. A possible cause of such a warp could be gravitational interaction with the satellite galaxies near the Andromeda Galaxy. The Galaxy M33 could be responsible for some warp in Andromeda's arms, though more precise distances and radial velocities are required.|$|E

5|$|A {{temporary}} wooden effigy with {{a copper}} crown {{was made for}} the funeral; {{this is the first}} known use of a funeral effigy in England, and was probably necessary because of the condition of the King's body, which had been dead for three months. Edward's heart was removed, placed in a silver container, and later buried with Isabella at Newgate Church in London. His tomb includes a very early example of an English alabaster effigy, with a tomb-chest and a canopy made of oolite and Purbeck stone. Edward was buried in the shirt, coif and gloves from his coronation, and his effigy depicts him as king, holding a sceptre and orb, and wearing a strawberry-leaf crown. The effigy features <b>a</b> <b>pronounced</b> lower lip, and may be a close likeness of Edward.|$|E
5|$|After the Great War, Moore {{received}} an ex-serviceman's grant {{to continue his}} education and in 1919 he became {{a student at the}} Leeds School of Art (now Leeds College of Art), which set up a sculpture studio especially for him. At the college, he met Barbara Hepworth, a fellow student who would also become a well-known British sculptor, and began a friendship and gentle professional rivalry that lasted for many years. In Leeds, Moore also had access to the modernist works in the collection of Sir Michael Sadler, the University Vice-Chancellor, which had <b>a</b> <b>pronounced</b> effect on his development. In 1921, Moore won a scholarship to study at the Royal College of Art in London, along with Hepworth and other Yorkshire contemporaries. While in London, Moore extended his knowledge of primitive art and sculpture, studying the ethnographic collections at the Victoria and Albert Museum and the British Museum.|$|E
5|$|Among Uranus's {{five major}} moons, Ariel {{is the second}} closest to the planet, {{orbiting}} at the distance of about 190,000km. Its orbit has a small eccentricity and is inclined very little relative to the equator of Uranus. Its orbital period is around 2.5Earth days, coincident with its rotational period. This means that {{one side of the}} moon always faces the planet; a condition known as tidal lock. Ariel's orbit lies completely inside the Uranian magnetosphere. The trailing hemispheres (those facing away from their directions of orbit) of airless satellites orbiting inside a magnetosphere like Ariel are struck by magnetospheric plasma co-rotating with the planet. This bombardment may lead to the darkening of the trailing hemispheres observed for all Uranian moons except Oberon (see below). Ariel also captures magnetospheric charged particles, producing <b>a</b> <b>pronounced</b> dip in energetic particle count near the moon's orbit observed by Voyager 2 in 1986.|$|E

5|$|During late August {{and early}} September1986, the Western Pacific monsoon trough became {{displaced}} to the east. Lower than normal pressures favored {{the building of}} convection over the trough. By the evening of September9, <b>a</b> <b>pronounced</b> area of disturbed weather developed southwest of the Truk Atoll. Aided by low wind shear, the disturbance developed slowly, even though the Hurricane Hunters initially failed to find a well-defined center. The disturbance drifted towards the northwest, and early on September12, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started monitoring the system. Based on ship reports, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified {{the system as a}} tropical depression at 06:00UTC on September13. Both the JMA and JTWC upgraded the depression into Tropical Storm Abby at 00:00UTC on September14.|$|E

To counter the effects of his several aches and pains, Pinfold has taken to dosing himself with a powerful sedative of chloral and bromide. He conceals this practice from his doctor.|$|E
5|$|Hibernian played {{its first}} match on the Meadows, on 25 December 1875. The club {{first moved to}} the Easter Road area in 1880, to a ground known as Hibernian Park. This {{location}} {{had the advantage of}} being equidistant between their two main sources of support, the Irish immigrant communities in the port of Leith and the Old Town of Edinburgh. When Hibs suffered financial difficulties in the early 1890s, the lease on Hibernian Park expired and developers started building what would become Bothwell Street. The club was reformed in 1892 and a lease on a piece of land called Drum Park was secured. The site had restricted access from Easter Road, <b>a</b> <b>pronounced</b> slope and was in close proximity to Bank Park, the home of Leith Athletic. There was a sense of continuity from the previous ground, however, and the supporters were keen to get started again. The first match at Easter Road was played on 4 February 1893, a friendly against Clyde.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Karl {{originated}} {{in a low}} pressure area that formed along a frontal boundary near the southeastern United States. It approached the Canadian Maritimes {{the next day and}} strengthened to below 1000 millibars. On November 24, the broad cyclone was located south of Newfoundland, and early the next day a mass of convection developed near the core. It evolved into a separate vortex, and {{due to the lack of}} inhibiting wind shear, a small cyclone developed. It became a subtropical storm at 0000 UTC before executing a tight counterclockwise loop as it rotated within the larger cyclone. About 18 hours later, the storm strengthened and gained enough tropical characteristics to be designated a hurricane, accompanied by the formation of <b>a</b> <b>pronounced</b> eye feature. At the time, it was situated around 610miles (1,110km) west-southwest of the Azores. Although the development of a tropical cyclone within a non-tropical storm is rare, it is not unprecedented. An unnamed hurricane in November 1991 also formed in this manner.|$|E
5|$|Norman Osborn has {{consistently}} been depicted with several unusual weaknesses {{related to his}} psychosis and to his personality. He suffers from manic depression, has <b>a</b> <b>pronounced</b> narcissistic personality disorder co-morbid with severe anti-social psychopathic traits, and in some depictions, a multiple-personality disorder. For some of his early appearances he and the Goblin were separate personalities; his Goblin side disdaining his human weaknesses, while his Norman Osborn persona was primarily motivated by his concern for Harry. Although his anger over his son's failing health as Norman helped to provoke his transformation back into the Goblin, this supposedly separate and more compassionate side of him never reappeared after he was believed dead. Norman is also highly sadistic, showing a complete lack of empathy for the lives of innocent people who stand {{between him and his}} objectives. These weaknesses have often been referenced in stories featuring him and exploited by his enemies.|$|E
5|$|Of equal profile was Rutherford's government's {{management}} of the province's railways. Alberta's early years were optimistic ones, which manifested itself in <b>a</b> <b>pronounced</b> enthusiasm {{for the construction of}} new railway lines. Every town wanted to be a railway centre, and the government had great confidence in the ability of the free market to provide low freight rates to the province's farmers provided sufficient charters were issued to competing companies. The legislature passed government-sponsored legislation setting out a framework for new railways in 1907, but interest from private firms in actually building the lines was limited. In the face of public demand and support by legislators of all parties for as rapid as possible an expansion of the province's lines, the government offered loan guarantees to several companies in exchange for commitments to build lines. Rutherford justified this in part by his conviction that railways needed to expand along with population, rather than having railway expansion follow population growth as would be the case without government intervention. The Conservatives argued that this strategy didn't go far enough, and called for direct government ownership.|$|E
