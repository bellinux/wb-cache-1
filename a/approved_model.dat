Two versions were created – a high definition version that was created for use in the television series itself and a lower resolution, which was also referred to as the [...] "approved model". The low-res model was used for promotional purposes while work was conducted on the television model. The exterior of the ship made its debut in a centerfold spread in the July 14, 2001 edition of TV Guide using the <b>approved</b> <b>model.</b> This version looked smaller as the windows on the ship were larger than used on the television version, and the hull had a bronze tint.

2500|$|Geoff Eley {{summed up}} the change in {{attitude}} at this time as follows:By the Fifth Comintern Congress in July 1924 … the collapse of Communist support in Europe tightened the pressure for conformity. A new policy of [...] "Bolshevization" [...] was adopted, which dragooned the CPs toward stricter bureaucratic centralism. This flattened out the earlier diversity of radicalisms, welding them into a single <b>approved</b> <b>model</b> of Communist organization. Only then did the new parties retreat from broader Left arenas into their own belligerent world, even if many local cultures of broader cooperation persisted. Respect for Bolshevik achievements and defense of the Russian Revolution now transmuted into dependency on Moscow and belief in Soviet infallibility. Depressing cycles of [...] "internal rectification" [...] began, disgracing and expelling successive leaderships, {{so that by the}} later 1920s many founding Communists had gone. This process of coordination, in a hard-faced drive for uniformity, was finalized at the next Congress of the Third International in 1928.|$|E

In this work, we aim to foster reuse in respect of trust and reputation systems by providing a hierarchical component taxonomy of computation engines which serves as a natural framework for the design of new reputation systems.

30|$|It {{has been}} argued (e.g. by [3]) that most reputation-based trust models {{proposed}} in the academic community are built from scratch and do not rely on existing approaches. Only a few authors continue their research on the ideas of others. Thus, many <b>approved</b> <b>models</b> and promising thoughts go unregarded. The benefits of reuse, though, have been recognized in software engineering for years. However, there are only very few works that proposed single components to enhance existing approaches. Rehak et al. [9], for instance, introduced a generic mechanism that can be combined with existing trust models to extend their capabilities by efficiently modeling context. The benefits of such a component that can easily be combined with existing systems are obvious. Nonetheless, research in trust and reputation still lacks in sound and accepted principles to foster reuse.|$|R

50|$|Poly Implant Prothèse (PIP) was a French company {{founded in}} 1991 that {{produced}} silicone gel breast implants.

50|$|Wiki UK Limited was {{incorporated}} {{as a private}} not-for-profit company under the Companies act 2006 on 5 November 2008 and, after the WMF terminated recognition of its predecessor, the organization was officially recognized as a chapter in January 2009. It applied for official recognition of charitable status to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) the same year, but was denied. The HMRC argued that WMUK's purpose of freely disseminating information through Wikipedia would not qualify as charitable unless it included teaching and education {{as part of its}} activities. Andrew Turvey, secretary of the WMUK, responded to the ruling by pledging to seek legal advice before appealing the decision. Following the rejection of its registration-application by the HMRC, Wikimedia UK amended its constitution by adopting new Articles of Association derived from an <b>approved</b> <b>model</b> for charitable status and applied to the Charity Commission for registration as a charity, which was granted in November 2011 once WMUK had met the Commission's minimum income requirement of £5,000.

5000|$|Drexler {{also wanted}} the bussard {{collectors}} {{at the front}} of the warp nacelles to be orange like The Original Series, but this was overruled by producers once more, who wanted them red also like the later series. Drexler thought that this was because Rick Berman wasn't fond of bright colors, and so Star Trek: Enterprise was filmed in greys and dark blues. The rear ends of the nacelles were influenced by Enterprise from The Original Series, with the spheres that appeared on the 1960s version split in two for the NX-01. Direct elements from The Original Series that did make it on to the NX-01 were the impulse engine cones and the lower sensor dome. The most prominent element from the first television Enterprise was the deflector dish. For the NX-01, it was compressed on the vertical axis and placed {{at the front of}} the saucer. The process of Drexler getting his designs approved by the producers was later described as [...] "a long hard battle" [...] by production illustrator and creator of Enterprise-E, John Eaves.The exterior model was created in CGI rather than as a physical model, with the production done by Pierre Drolet from Foundation Imaging using LightWave 3D.

50|$|In hockey, a goal is scored {{when the}} ball or puck passes {{completely}} over the goal line under the crossbar and between the goal posts, after being shot from with a semicircle 14.63 m from the goal. The goal structure in field hockey is 3.66 m wide by 2.14 m tall. Nets are required to hold the ball in. Similarly, in ice hockey, scoring a goal is similar to scoring a goal in football. The puck must be put completely over the goal line between the posts and under the bar either off an offensive player's stick or off any part of a defensive player's body. The puck may not be kicked, batted, or thrown into the goal, though a goal may be awarded if the puck is inadvertently deflected off an offensive player's skate or body into the goal. The goal structure is a frame 4 ft tall and 6 ft wide with a net attached. In most higher levels of play the goal structure {{is attached to the}} ice surface by flexible pegs and will break away for safety when hit by a player. The goal is placed within the playing surface, and players may play the puck behind the goal. Another similarity is in bandy, which has much of its structure from association football. Like in association football, the only way of scoring in bandy is to make a goal and the goal is also used to refer to the scoring structure. If neither of the teams has scored during a match, or if both teams have made the same number of goals, there is a draw. If not otherwise decided in the Bandy Playing Rules set up by the Federation of International Bandy, an approved goal is made {{when the ball}} is played in a regular manner and the whole ball has passed the inner definition of the goal line between the two goal posts and the cross-bar. This is stated in section 9 of the Rules. A goal can be made directly from a stroke-off, penalty-shot, a free-stroke, a face-off or a corner stroke. Centered at each short-line of the bandy field is a 3.5 m wide and 2.1 m high goal cage, regulated to size, form, material and other properties in section 1.4 of the Bandy Playing Rules. The cage has a net to stop the ball when it has crossed the goal-line. The cage shall be of an <b>approved</b> <b>model.</b> In front of the goal cage is a half-circular penalty area with a 17 m radius. A penalty spot is located 12 m in front of the goal and there are two free-stroke spots at the penalty area line, each surrounded by a 5 m circle.|$|E
