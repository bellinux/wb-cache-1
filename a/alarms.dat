5|$|Kelsey wanders {{from the}} tour and {{attempts}} to phone Maria, but disturbs an unknown beast, the Bane Mother, to the annoyance of the staff, to which Wormwood orders the <b>alarms</b> switched off and Sarah Jane killed. Maria attempts to phone Kelsey, but sets off the <b>alarms</b> again, causing the Archetype to escape, transferring the focus upon him. Maria, while escaping, encounters him, who just mimics her, and they escape into a women's bathroom. Sarah Jane then enters, and although they are surprised to see each other, they manage to escape the factory, albeit without Kelsey. When they arrive back on Bannerman Road, Sarah warns Maria not to get involved as her life is too dangerous.|$|E
5|$|The {{objective}} of Apollo11 was to land safely {{rather than to}} touch down with precision on a particular spot. Three minutes into the lunar descent burn, Armstrong noted that craters were passing about two seconds too early, which meant the Eagle would probably touch down beyond the planned landing zone by several miles. As the Eagles landing radar acquired the surface, several computer error <b>alarms</b> appeared. The first was a code 1202 alarm, and even with their extensive training, neither Armstrong nor Aldrin was aware of what this code meant. They promptly received word from CAPCOM Charles Duke in Houston that the <b>alarms</b> were not a concern; the 1202 and 1201 <b>alarms</b> were caused by an executive overflow in the lunar module computer. As described by Buzz Aldrin in the documentary In the Shadow of the Moon, the overflow condition was caused by his own counter-checklist choice of leaving the docking radar on during the landing process, so the computer had to process unnecessary radar data {{and did not have}} enough time to execute all tasks, dropping lower-priority ones. Aldrin stated that he did so with the {{objective of}} facilitating re-docking with the CM should an abort become necessary, not realizing that it would cause the overflow condition.|$|E
5|$|The tornado {{prediction}} {{proved to}} be successful, even if its precision was mostly due to chance.

40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the need of}} including acoustical perspectives in the debate on <b>alarm</b> fatigue within the healthcare domain.

A focal point in the <b>alarm</b> chain – the ‘alarm mediation cleft’ – seems to divide the <b>alarm</b> fatigue literature from the segment of the <b>alarm</b> literature that deals with auditory <b>alarm</b> design. The current healthcare discourse on <b>alarm</b> fatigue is centred around the ‘premediated <b>alarm</b> phase’, which has the consequence of an unfortunate dichotomous approach to the functionality of sound. We address some shortcomings of this approach and outline some methodological implications and potentials of searching for signs of <b>alarm</b> fatigue in the ‘post-mediated <b>alarm</b> phase’...|$|R

50|$|By default, the {{assignment}} of <b>alarm</b> trip points and <b>alarm</b> priorities constitute basic <b>alarm</b> management. Each individual <b>alarm</b> {{is designed to provide}} an alert when that process indication deviates from normal.

The resultant <b>alarm</b> annunciation does not respond to changes in the mode of operation or the operating conditions.|$|R
40|$|The sound {{pressure}} level (SPL) in five large public housing estates in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) was measured to study audibility of fire <b>alarm</b> bell.

A questionnaire survey was conducted and 100 occupants were interviewed to study the human response towards the audio fire <b>alarm.</b> Subjective perception of the <b>alarm</b> loudness is correlated to age and the location of the occupant.

5|$|Stealth is a {{significant}} element of the gameplay; frequent gunfire can alert distant guards, and activated <b>alarms</b> can trigger infinitely-respawning enemies. Therefore, to avoid gunfights with numerous opponents, it is advantageous to eliminate soldiers and security cameras before they spot or hear the player.

There are no health-recovery items in the game, although armour vests can be acquired to provide a secondary health bar.|$|E

50|$|An {{important}} part of most SCADA implementations is <b>alarm</b> handling.

In many cases, a SCADA operator may have to acknowledge the <b>alarm</b> event; this may deactivate some <b>alarm</b> indicators, whereas other indicators remain active until the <b>alarm</b> conditions are cleared.|$|R
5|$|Because the minelayers were {{operating}} {{within range of}} German surface raiders, the American battleships were detailed to provide an escort for them, along with other units of the Grand Fleet. For the most part, these expeditions proved uneventful, but on two occasions, on 30 June and again on 8 August, lookouts on the battleships reported seeing U-boats or torpedoes in the water, forcing the Division to maneuver accordingly. Like the previous sightings made while escorting the Scandinavian Convoy, subsequent review of German war records revealed that both cases were false <b>alarms.</b>|$|E

5|$|Hamilton assumed {{control in}} the War department, and the rift between Adams' and Hamilton's {{supporters}} widened.

By building a large standing army, Hamilton's supporters raised popular <b>alarms</b> and played into the hands of the Democratic-Republicans. They also alienated Adams and his large personal following.
