40|$|Abstract—Recently the Birkhoff-von Neumann load-balanced (LB) switch {{has become}} a {{promising}} switch design due to its high scalability properties and simple control. The performance of the LB switch was studied under strong assumptions such as infinite buffers and admissible traffic conditions. However, both such assumptions may be violated in multi-hop networks since <b>admissibility</b> <b>requirement</b> cannot be maintained unless some inter-switch feedback mechanism is implemented, and infinite buffers are not feasible either. This paper considers {{the performance of the}} LB switch with finite central stage buffers under both (i) admissible and (ii) inadmissible input traffic conditions. Its contributions are two folds: firstly, by means of mathematical model we demonstrate that the load-balanced switch has a non-zero cell dropping probability due to buffer overflow even under the admissible input traffic assumptions. Secondly, cell loss probabilities are even higher and large buffers are required under inadmissible traffic conditions to cope with such behavior. I...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The problem {{addressed}} is the distributed re-configuration of a metamorphic {{robot system}} composed of {{any number of}} two dimensional robots (modules). The initial configuration we consider is a straight chain of modules, while the goal configuration satisfies a simple admissibility condition. Our reconfiguration strategy depends on finding a contiguous path of cells, called a substrate path, that spans the goal configuration. Modules fill in this substrate path and then move along the path {{to fill in the}} remainder of the goal without collision or deadlock. In this paper, we address the problem of reconfiguration when a single obstacle is embedded in the goal environment. We introduce a classification for traversable surfaces which allows for coherence in defining admissibility characteristics for various objects in the hexagonal grid. We present algorithms to 1) determine if an obstacle embedded in the goal fulfills a simple <b>admissibility</b> <b>requirement,</b> 2) include an admissible obstacle in a substrate path, and 3) accomplish distributed reconfiguration.

40|$|The problem {{addressed}} is the distributed reconfiguration of a metamorphic {{robotic system}} composed of {{any number of}} identical hexagonal modules. A metamorphic robotic system {{is a collection of}} independently controlled, smaller robots that can move around adjacent robots to change the shape of the overall system. The shape-changing ability of these systems makes them more versatile than conventional mobile robots. Because the modules are homogeneous, the systems are also capable of self-repair. As part of our research, we developed deterministic, distributed reconfiguration algorithms for planning the reconfiguration when a single obstacle with an irregular surface (e. g., containing pockets) is embedded in the goal. Current reconfiguration algorithms find a bisecting path of goal cells spanning the goal, called the substrate path. Modules fill in this substrate path and then move along the path to fill in the remainder of the goal. We present algorithms to 1) determine if an obstacle fulfills a simple <b>admissibility</b> <b>requirement</b> based on contact patterns, 2) include an admissible obstacle in a substrate path, and 3) determine the order to fill the pocket cells...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. It is {{well-known}} that while strict admissibility of heuris-tics {{in problem solving}} guarantees the optimality of the A * algo-rithm, many problems cannot be effectively faced because of the combinatorial explosion. In order {{to address this problem}} the notion of -admissible search has been introduced, which yields solutions with bounded costs [12]. In this paper, we introduce the related concept of likely-admissible heuristics, where the <b>admissibility</b> <b>requirement</b> is relaxed in a prob-abilistic sense. Instead of providing an upper-bound to the cost we guarantee to end up with optimal solutions with a given probability. Interestingly, likely-admissible heuristics can be obtained naturally by statistical learning techniques such as artificial neural networks, which can learn from examples the expected value of the cost to reach the target. We used multilayered neural networks with a proper novel cost function in order to bias the learning towards admissibility. Our experiments with the 15 -puzzle and IDA * show that the adop-tion of likely-admissible sub-symbolic heuristics yield optimal solu-tions in 50 % of the cases, taking only 1 / 500 time (1 / 13000 space) of classic Manhattan-based search. ...|$|E
40|$|Cloud {{computing}} is {{an emerging}} model that separates application and information {{resources from the}} underlying infrastructure, and the mechanisms used to deliver them. The elastic nature, cost effective price and convenient connectivity make the cloud {{become more and more}} attractive as a storage medium for digital forensic investigators. The increasing volumes of data are also a driver for investigators use of a cloud for storing evidence and performing analysis. However, because of the distributed nature of the cloud (Cruz, & Atkison, 2011, p. 306), data stored in the cloud may likely be divided into smaller chunks and placed at different data centres all over the globe. Moreover, the dynamic and remote nature of the cloud, make data relocating from data centre to data centre. Hence, data may be constantly compressed and resized. Thus, it is possible that data may be lost during the transmission; or compromised by attacks in the cloud. Furthermore, redundant storage in multiple jurisdictions (Yan, 2011, p. 612) and the lack of transparent real-time information about where data is stored introduces judicial issues and further complications for investigations. Virtualisation also impacts on the privacy of other users (Dahbur, & Mohammad, 2011, p. 2) of the cloud. To maintain information security, organisations can encrypt data before storing them in the Cloud; and then decrypt after retrieving the data from the Cloud. The key challenges that a digital investigator is facing before committing to the cloud, is how to ensure that the security of evidence data will be maintained; and privacy will be protected in order to fulfil digital forensic investigation principles. Although solutions such as Hou, Uehara, Yiu, & Hui (2011, p. 378) have been proposed to use homomorphic encryption to protect innocent evidence data from being exposed; they are, however, more suited in a relatively static database environment, and the feasibility and performance of such solutions in a public cloud are still yet to be studied and evaluated. To maintain information security, organisations can encrypt data before storing them in the Cloud; and decrypt after retrieving the data from the Cloud. The research will identify, analyse and evaluate whether or not modern encryption algorithms can be used in providing data security and persevering privacy for digital forensic investigation evidence data stored in the cloud. To conduct the proposed research, a trial system was created in a lab controlled environment to simulate commercial situations where data will be relocated and distributed. The normal operation of the trial system was documented as the semi-trusted Storage-as-a-service cloud, in which stored digital forensic investigation data were scattered. Hence, the integrity, confidentiality and availability of digital forensic investigation data were stressed. Then experimental data generated during the research were collected and analysed, in order to test the robustness and performances of selected encryption tools. The methodology used in a simulated environment was based on descriptive methods in which the case scenario of simulated attack on the cloud by redistributing encrypted sample file data from one storage medium to another. To investigate the robustness and performances of selected encryption tools, a customized cloud simulation were created using VMmare. The descriptive mythology allowed the elaboration of precise details relevant to the research question. 	The purpose of the main research question was to evaluate whether or not modern encryption algorithms can be used in providing security and preserve privacy for digital forensic investigation evidence data stored in the cloud. Consequently, the court evidence <b>admissibility</b> <b>requirement</b> was met according to digital forensic investigation principles and guidelines. The significant findings were found that the selected encryption tools were able to provide security for evidence data in the cloud at a sufficient level. Moreover, the encryption tools examined had reasonably good performance in the cloud. Though, AxCrypt had the overall best performance in terms of security features and data compression result resilience. To conclude, the research conducted confirms that modern encryption algorithms are able to maintain security and preserve privacy for digital forensic investigation evidence data stored in the cloud. Moreover, using modern encryption algorithms ensures that evidence data do meet confidentiality, availability, privacy preserving, chain-of-custody and eventually court admissibility requirements. Ultimately, digital forensic investigator compliance principles are fulfilled...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Forensic DNA {{profiling}} {{is acknowledged}} {{as the model}} for a scientifically defensible approach in forensic identification science, as it meets the most stringent court <b>admissibility</b> <b>requirements</b> demanding transparency in scientific evaluation of evidence and testability of systems and protocols. In this paper, we propose a unified approach to forensic speaker recognition (FSR) oriented to fulfil these <b>admissibility</b> <b>requirements</b> within a framework which is transparent, testable, and understandable, both for scientists and fact-finders. We show how the evaluation of DNA evidence, which is based on a probabilistic similarity-typicality metric in the form of likelihood ratios (LR), can also be generalized to continuous LR estimation, thus providing a common framework for phonetic–linguistic methods and automatic systems. We highlight the importance of calibration, and we exemplify with LRs from diphthongal F-pattern, and LRs in NIST-SRE 06 tasks. The application of the proposed approach in daily casework remains a sensitive issue, and special caution is enjoined. Our objective is to show how traditional and automatic FSR methodologies can be transparent and testable, but simultaneously remain conscious of the present limitations. We conclude with a discussion on the combined use of traditional and automatic approaches and current challenges for the admissibility of speech evidence.

In fact, science evolves, among other things, by questioning and verifying the ideas and theories that are held to be scientifically valid and by continuously searching for new knowledge. As judicial systems in several countries have evolved over time, they have established minimum criteria for the admissibility of scientific evidence in order to ensure accuracy as far as possible. Forensic laboratories in countries with such requirements have established quality systems as a tool for verifying the standards of the scientific information they provide to courts as evidence.

The methodology. The following scientific methods have been used to write this article: analysis, comparing and making conclusions. Results, scope of application. The right of individual petition is rightly considered to be the hallmark and the greatest achievement of the European Convention on Human Rights. Individuals who consider that their human rights have been violated have the possibility of lodging a complaint before the European Court of Human Rights. However, there are important <b>admissibility</b> <b>requirements</b> set out in the Convention that must be satisfied before a case be examined. Applicants are expected to have exhausted their domestic remedies and have brought their complaints within a period of six months from the date of the final domestic decision. The obligation to exhaust domestic remedies forms part of customary international law, recognized as such in the case – law of the International Court of Justice. The rationale for the exhaustion rule is to give the national authorities, primarily the courts, the opportunity to prevent or put right the alleged violation of the Convention. The domestic legal order should provide an effective remedy for violations of Convention rights. Conclusions.

40|$|The citizen {{submissions}} {{procedure of}} the North American Commission for Environmental Cooperation (CEC) celebrates its twentieth birthday this year. After a promising childhood, the procedure {{has had a}} stormy adolescence, vexed by accusations of ineffectiveness, bias, and delay. In 2012, the CEC adopted revisions to the procedure that promise to improve its timeliness, but do {{little or nothing to}} address its other problems. As the procedure enters its twenties, settled maturity is still a distant prospect. Created in 1993 by the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation (NAAEC), a tri-national agreement between Canada, Mexico, and the United States, the submissions procedure allows any individual or group in one of the three Parties to file a complaint with the CEC alleging that a Party is failing to enforce its domestic environmental laws. If the submission meets certain <b>admissibility</b> <b>requirements,</b> it can lead to a detailed investigative report, called a 2 ̆ 2 factual record. 2 ̆ 2 As Section II of this Article describes, the first two decades of the CEC submissions procedure have seen real achievements, but they have also given rise to growing controversies. Scholars and environmental advocates have increasingly criticized the procedure on three grounds: (a) it is far too slow, (b) the Parties interfere with it too often, and (c) the CEC does not follow-up factual records to determine whether they have led to real improvements. As Part III explains, the most recent round in this recurring struggle began in 2011, when the NAAEC Parties announced that they planned to adopt revisions to the procedure 2 ̆ 7 s Guidelines. Outside observers saw the revision process as an opportunity to address long-standing problems, but they also feared that the Parties could use the revisions to weaken the procedure further. In early 2012, a governmental task force proposed revisions that seemed to confirm these concerns. As a result, CEC advisory bodies and others strongly objected to many of the suggested amendments to the Guidelines. The objections appear to have had some effect: {{the final version of the}} Guidelines adopted by the NAAEC Parties in July 2012 drops or softens the more controversial proposals. Moreover, the revisions set new deadlines that, if followed, would greatly shorten the time the procedure takes to process submissions. However, the revised Guidelines still impose new restrictions on the submissions procedure, and they continue to ignore the need for effective follow-up to factual records. Part IV concludes by underlining that while the CEC submissions procedure still offers a unique mechanism to draw attention to important environmental issues that might otherwise be overlooked, its shortcomings have sapped its attractiveness to potential submitters. The adoption of stricter deadlines is a step in the right direction, but to restore trust in the procedure, the CEC must do more. Specifically, it must regularly meet the deadlines in practice, it should start following-up factual records, and, most importantly, the Parties must resist the urge to micromanage the process. Otherwise, criticisms and controversy will continue to follow the procedure as it enters its third decade...|$|R

A solution to creating hardware-based security in devices producing digital evidence was proposed in 2012. Additionally, this paper revises the proposal and discusses three distinct scenarios where forensic readiness of devices and secure digital evidence are relevant. It sho ws, how the different requirements of the three scenarios can be realized using a hardware-based solution. The scenarios are: lawful interception of voice communication, automotive black box, precise farming. These three scenarios come from very distinctive application domains. Nevertheless, they share a common set of security requirements for processes to be documented and data records to be stored. ©, 2015, Harbin Institute of Technology. All right reserved...|$|R
