5|$|A {{traditional}} {{definition is}} {{that to be a}} Cockney, one had to be born within the sound of Bow Bells, situated in Cheapside.

5|$|Alzheimer's {{disease is}} characterised by loss of neurons and synapses in the {{cerebral}} cortex and certain subcortical regions. This loss results in gross atrophy {{of the affected}} regions, including degeneration in the temporal lobe and parietal lobe, <b>and</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> frontal cortex and cingulate gyrus. Degeneration is also present in brainstem nuclei like the locus coeruleus. Studies using MRI and PET have documented reductions {{in the size of}} specific brain regions in people with AD as they progressed from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease, and in comparison with similar images from healthy older adults.|$|E
5|$|By the 16th century Conisbrough Castle {{was in a}} poor {{state of}} repair, and a royal survey carried out in 1537 and 1538 showed that the gates, bridge <b>and</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> walls had {{collapsed}} in a spectacular land slippage, and that one floor of the keep had also fallen in. The collapse of the walls was {{a consequence of the}} instability of the topsoil on top of the limestone spur, which was a mixture of clay and sandstone; once the clay was washed away over time, the remaining sandstone proved extremely unstable and liable to crack.|$|E

5|$|Cabernet Sauvignon is {{the most}} widely planted red grape variety in Washington state {{according}} to the Washington State Wine Commission. It is generally found in the warmer sites of the Columbia Valley. The vines are choice plantings for growers due to their hardy vine stalks and resistance to the cold winter frost that is commonplace in Eastern Washington. Washington Cabernet Sauvignon is characterized by its fruitiness and easy drinking styles that are not overly tannic. Recent Washington American Viticultural Areas (AVAs) that have seen some success with their Cabernet Sauvignons include Red Mountain, Walla Walla Valley <b>and</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Yakima Valley AVA near the Tri-Cities region.|$|E
5|$|Crete {{had been}} the target of Muslim attacks since the first wave of the Muslim conquests in the mid-7th century. It had {{suffered}} a first raid in 654 and again in 674/675, <b>and</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> island were temporarily occupied during the reign of the Umayyad Caliph al-Walid I (r. 705–715). Nevertheless, the island was never conquered and despite occasional raids in the 8th century it remained securely in Byzantine hands; Crete was too far from the Arab naval bases in the Levant for an effective expedition against it to be undertaken.|$|E

5|$|Eleven {{percent of}} Nescopeck Creek's {{watershed}} {{is made up}} of the Udorthents-Urban Land-Volusia series. There is some urban development over lands containing the soil series. Other areas where this soil series occurs have been surface-mined. The limiting factor for plant growth in this series is the rocky surface and the depth of the bedrock below. The Udorthents-Urban Land-Volusia soil series occurs in the southeastern <b>and</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> southwestern parts of the Nescopeck Creek watershed. The Lackawanna-Arnot-Morris series is present in nine percent of Nescopeck Creek's watershed. The Lackawanna-Arnot-Morris soil series mostly is near Nescopeck Creek's source, but there is some of it in the central Nescopeck Creek watershed.|$|E
5|$|Haraldr Guðrøðarson was {{a member}} of the Crovan dynasty, a family of sea-kings who ruled the Mann <b>and</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hebrides from the late {{eleventh}} century to the mid thirteenth century. He was the son of Guðrøðr Rǫgnvaldsson, King of the Isles (died 1231), who was in turn a son of Rǫgnvaldr Guðrøðarson, King of the Isles (died 1229). Although the latter monarch may have managed to rule a somewhat independent kingdom, surrounded by formidable Norwegian, Scottish, and English monarchs, his successors fell under the shadow of Hákon Hákonarson, King of Norway (died 1263), and rendered tribute to the latter in recognition of Norwegian overlordship.|$|E
5|$|Ibn Tulun {{stands out}} as the first {{governor}} of a major province of the Abbasid Caliphate to not only establish himself as its master independently of the Abbasid court, but to also pass power on to his son.

5|$|In 2001, {{a quarter}} of the Welsh {{population}} were born outside Wales, mainly in England; about 3% were born outside the UK. The proportion born in Wales varies across the country, with the highest percentages in the south Wales valleys and the lowest in mid Wales <b>and</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> north-east. In both Blaenau Gwent and Merthyr Tydfil, 92% were Welsh-born, compared to only 51% and 56% in the border counties of Flintshire and Powys. Just over 1.75 million Americans report themselves to have Welsh ancestry, as did 440,965 Canadians in Canada's 2006 census.|$|E

5|$|It is a dance-pop {{song with}} heavy, {{pounding}} synths. The song {{also has a}} fast techno beat with electroclash and Eurodisco influences. Gaga speaks the first verse <b>and</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chorus of the song faux-German, as {{the name of the}} song is German. The lyrics have a feminist tone, speaking of female empowerment. The song received positive reviews from contemporary critics, who complimented its heavy dance beat and catchy chorus, despite criticizing the faux-German lyrics and Gaga's accent. The song charted on the South Korean Gaon Music Chart and US Billboard dance charts, as well as entering the component charts in Canada, Germany, and the United States.|$|E
