5|$|An era {{came to an}} end in 1668 {{with two}} events: Davenant died suddenly, leaving <b>a</b> <b>messy</b> {{ownership}} situation for the Duke's Company, and Pepys' eyesight forced him to stop keeping a diary. Thomas Betterton, though formally a minority shareholder, continued to run the Duke's Company, and, in the spirit of Davenant, commissioned the most elaborate of the Restoration playhouses, the theatre at Dorset Garden (or Dorset Gardens), with a flat for himself on top. Although the Dorset Garden Theatre quickly became a famous and glamorous venue, very little is concretely known about the building and outfitting of it: a vague and undocumented tradition ascribes its design to Christopher Wren. The absence of Pepys' record means that performance data for the next decades are only patchily known.|$|E
5|$|The Browns {{beat the}} Chicago Rockets in Chicago for their third {{straight}} victory. The matchup was <b>a</b> <b>messy</b> one, marked by turnovers and rough play by both sides. The teams combined for eight fumbles and four interceptions, and play was stopped {{several times to}} break up fights. Chicago was penalized 30 yards for unnecessary roughness, while Cleveland was penalized 15 yards. Despite the interruptions and frequent turnovers, Cleveland quarterback Otto Graham had his best game of the season, throwing three touchdowns and rushing for a fourth. Bob Cowan caught two of the touchdowns. Chicago, meanwhile, scored just one touchdown – a short pass to Elroy Hirsch from quarterback Angelo Bertelli in the second quarter. Chicago successfully contained Marion Motley, Cleveland's most productive back, who finished the game with 49 yards on 14 carries. The final score was 28–7.|$|E

50|$|Because Messier {{compiled}} his catalog from {{a northern}} latitude, {{not all of}} the Messier objects are visible from the southern hemisphere. In particular, M81, M82, M52, and M103 make southern-hemisphere Messier marathons difficult, because they are all located at a declination of 60° north or greater. Although <b>a</b> <b>Messier</b> marathon can be attempted from any northern latitude, low northern latitudes are best. In particular, a latitude of around 25° north lends the best possibility to complete <b>a</b> <b>Messier</b> marathon at the right time of year.|$|R

25|$|The {{defeat at}} Notium caused the {{complete}} downfall of Alcibiades in Athenian politics. Restored to favor after the victory at Cyzicus, {{he had been}} placed in command with great expectations. When his unorthodox appointment of Antiochus led to <b>a</b> <b>messy</b> defeat, his political enemies saw their chance, and he was removed from office. Never again returning to Athens, he sailed north to land he owned in the Thracian Chersonese; except for a brief appearance at Aegospotami, his involvement in the war was over.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{restoration}} work was undertaken, vandalism and illegal encroachments were rampant {{at the site}} of the tomb, presenting a serious danger to the preservation of this invaluable treasure. At the main entrance of Humayun’s Tomb, dingy stalls had been put up under a very corrupt system of municipal patronage known as tehbazari, and all sorts of heavy vehicles were allowed to be parked illegally in these open spaces. On the Nila Gumbad side was a huge citadel of India’s vote bank politics — thousands of ‘slum dwellers’ were kept by an influential section of the political leadership to serve as ‘bonded voters’ during elections. The environment of the dargah of Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya had also been ruthlessly degraded and the holy tank had become <b>a</b> <b>messy</b> cesspool.|$|E
25|$|Shen Teh is {{rewarded for}} her hospitality, as the gods {{take it as}} a sure sign of goodness. They give her money and she buys a humble tobacco shop which they intend as both gift and test: will Shen Teh be able to {{maintain}} her goodness with these newfound means, however slight they may be? If she succeeds, the gods' confidence in humanity would be restored. Though at first Shen Teh seems {{to live up to the}} gods' expectations, her generosity quickly turns her small shop into <b>a</b> <b>messy,</b> overcrowded poorhouse which attracts crime and police supervision. In a sense, Shen Teh quickly fails the test, as she is forced to introduce the invented cousin Shui Ta as overseer and protector of her interests. Shen Teh dons a costume of male clothing, a mask, and a forceful voice to take on the role of Shui Ta. Shui Ta arrives at the shop, coldly explains that his cousin has gone out of town on a short trip, curtly turns out the hangers-on, and quickly restores order to the shop.|$|E
50|$|At low {{northern}} latitudes, particularly around latitude 25° north, it {{is possible}} to observe all Messier objects in one night during a window of a few weeks from mid-March to early April.

50|$|<b>A</b> <b>Messier</b> {{marathon}} is <b>an</b> attempt, usually {{organized by}} amateur astronomers, to find as many Messier objects as possible during one night.

25|$|From May-to-Oct 1938 {{a murder}} case {{consumed}} his time - that of Mathias Warren, father to Earl Warren who was soon to be was Attorney General, then governor, and in time, supreme court judge. On hearing of the murder then district attorney Warren, who had cultivated a relationship with police in various departments and reporters, came to Bakersfield along with many friends seeking to help {{and there was some}} tension how the investigation would proceed. Powers insisted and Warren let Powers be in charge. Ultimately no one was charged with the crime - Powers ended up viewing it as a breaking-and-entering that became murder from a transient as Mathias Warren had chosen to live on <b>a</b> <b>messy</b> property while his wealth was tied up in land holdings. Of course the matter was covered in many newspaper stories. However, as time went on the importance of the case, at least to Powers, {{had more to do with}} the increasing prominence of Earl Warren. Powers noted the transients of the period were the Okies, indeed The Grapes of Wrath was set in Bakersfield, and that the local establishment tried to keep them pushed out of the way.|$|E
25|$|Pete schooled {{with his}} {{neighbour}} and friend, Den Watts (Leslie Grantham); they remained close in adulthood. In his mid-teens, Pete had {{a one-night stand}} with prostitute Pat Harris (Pam St. Clement) who informed Pete she was pregnant. Pete did the chivalrous thing and married Pat when he was 16; however it transpired that the pregnancy was a false alarm and Lou always {{felt that it was}} a ploy to trap her son. During the marriage, Pat gave birth to two sons, David (Michael French) and Simon (Nick Berry), the latter of whom Pete believed to be his. Yet Pat could not settle down. She had various affairs, including a tryst with her former lover Frank Butcher (Mike Reid), a one-night stand with Den, and an affair with Pete's older brother Kenny (Michael Attwell). Lou found Pat and Kenny in bed together and banished Kenny abroad, but Pete was unaware of the affair. Pat was also having an affair with another man named Brian Wicks (Leslie Schofield). When Pete found out he left Pat - she was six months pregnant with Simon at the time - and then went into a relationship with local girl, Kathy Hills (Gillian Taylforth). There was <b>a</b> <b>messy</b> divorce and soon after, Pat married Brian and he took on responsibility of her two sons. Pete had little contact with his children following this.|$|E

50|$|Typically an {{observer}} attempting <b>a</b> <b>Messier</b> marathon begins observing at sundown and will observe {{through the night}} until sunrise {{in order to see}} all 110 objects. An observer starts with objects low in the western sky at sunset, hoping to view them before they dip out of view, then works eastward across the sky. By sunrise, the successful observer will be observing the last few objects low on the eastern horizon, hoping to see them before the sky becomes too bright due to the rising sun. The evening can be a test of stamina and willpower depending on weather conditions and the physical fitness of the observer. Particularly crowded regions of the sky (namely, the Virgo Cluster and the Milky Way's galactic center) can prove to be challenging to {{an observer}} as well, and <b>a</b> <b>Messier</b> marathon will generally budget time for these regions accordingly.|$|R
500|$|In {{the final}} sequence, it is {{revealed}} that the story that Kint had told Kujan is a fabrication, made up of strung-together details culled from a crowded bulletin board in <b>a</b> <b>messy</b> office.

Kujan realizes the fabrication and pursues Kint, who has already been released, his limp gone. Kint gets into a car, driven by [...] "Kobayashi". As the two drive away, Kujan desperately looks around the crowded streets for him.|$|E
500|$|In a {{day where}} {{half of the}} week's top-10 teams were defeated, USC escaped {{becoming}} the sixth in <b>a</b> <b>messy,</b> mistake-prone 27–24 victory in a wet, windy game in Seattle. [...] Although USC had a 460–190 edge in total yards, their errors helped the Huskies significantly: They committed threeturnovers and 16penalties—their most in more than twoseasons—for 161yards, missed a field goal and had a punt blocked.

5000|$|The cluster was {{probably}} first catalogued by Giovanni Batista Hodierna in 1654, and it subsequently appeared in many star atlases of the 17th and 18th centuries.

500|$|With the video, Madonna {{broke the}} taboo of interracial relationships. Although {{at first it}} seems that Madonna denies the Hispanic guy in favour of the photographer, later she rejects him, {{implying}} her desire to control her own sexual pleasures or going over the established pop borderlines with lyrics like [...] "You just keep on pushing my love, over the borderline". The contrasting image of Madonna, first as <b>a</b> <b>messy</b> blonde in the Hispanic sequence and later as a fashioned glamorous blonde, suggested that one can construct one's own image and identity. Portraying herself as a Hispanic also had the clever marketing strategy of appealing to Hispanic and black youths, thus breaking down racial barriers.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} to {{the episode}} was mostly mixed. Television Without Pity writer Jessica Morgan rated the episode a [...] "B".

No trash. It's nicer than my apartment, really." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen gave the episode a mixed review and rated it two-and-a-half stars out of five. Despite writing that [...] "on paper [...] the right episode at the right time", the two criticized the episode, noting that [...] "the teaser never really makes sense in light of the relations offered, the appearance of the mute boy is <b>a</b> <b>messy</b> contrivance, and the ending is too abrupt." ...|$|E
500|$|Mahesh {{played the}} role of a billionaire's son in the film. For his character's appearance, he chose a casual look replete with cardigans, jackets and scarves.

Shruti Haasan was selected as the heroine of the film; the role was supposed to be her first on-screen appearance with Mahesh though she had appeared in an item number in Aagadu after signing this film. She charged a remuneration of 12.5 million, which was the highest she had received in her career until then. Haasan said that she would play a [...] "strong, independent, intelligent" [...] and simple girl in the film, adding that the romance between the lead pair would be a [...] "very calm, relaxed and classy" [...] one.

500|$|Alaina Yee of IGN also praised how Xbox One {{had evolved}} since its launch, {{assigning}} it with Kinect {{a score of}} 8.1/10 and acknowledging that Microsoft had [...] "made good on its promise of listening to consumers, rolling out {{a steady stream of}} updates that have both broadened and deepened what this third Xbox console offers." [...] Regarding the console's slightly lower level of graphics capabilities in comparison to PlayStation 4, it was noted that [...] "while videophiles might spot instances of upscaled graphics and less detailed environments immediately, most people generally won't notice a difference between Xbox One and PlayStation 4 versions of a game (when there is one) unless they see both running side by side", and examples of [...] "gorgeous" [...] Xbox One games were noted, such as Sunset Overdrive and Forza Motorsport 5. The number of [...] "hidden" [...] options in Xbox One's user interface was equated to [...] "hunting for treasure in <b>a</b> <b>messy</b> room"; as such, Kinect voice commands, in combination with access to common functions within the Xbox SmartGlass app, were praised for helping to provide a more streamlined user experience.|$|E
500|$|The song {{begins with}} drummer Questlove's off-beat, cross-snare clicks {{on the two}} and four beat with <b>a</b> <b>messy</b> kick. Music critic Steve McPherson noted that its first two {{measures}} sound [...] "like a disaster", contrasting its solid groove. While most musical compositions rely on tension and release, which can be produced by factors such as soft verses and loud choruses, gradual buildup, sublte tension within verses or {{over the course of}} the bridge, or harmonic tension in chords that provides space for improvisation, D'Angelo's arrangements subdivide the tension into each moment of the song. According to McPherson, this results in [...] "no linear way to measure how far off things slide before they pull themselves back ... can't be measured in beats or fractions of beats in a meaningful way. For lack of a less cliched word, it's entirely 'feel'". Similar to most of the song's album, Voodoo, [...] "Untitled (How Does It Feel)" [...] has this syncopation style as its center. D'Angelo's casual vocal style follows the same concept, applying it to melody, harmony, and phrasing, and is accompanied by falsetto climbs and skittery phrasing similar to Prince's singing.|$|E
500|$|In 1989, the Smashing Pumpkins {{made their}} first {{appearance}} on record with the compilation album Light Into Dark, which featured several Chicago alternative bands. The group released its first single, [...] "I Am One", in 1990 on local Chicago label Limited Potential. The single sold {{out and they}} released a follow-up, [...] "Tristessa", on Sub Pop, after which they signed to Caroline Records. The band recorded their 1991 debut studio album Gish with producer Butch Vig at his Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin for $20,000. In order to gain the consistency he desired, Corgan often played all instruments excluding drums, which created tension in the band. The music fused heavy metal guitars, psychedelia, and dream pop, garnering them comparisons to Jane's Addiction. Gish became a minor success, with the single [...] "Rhinoceros" [...] receiving some airplay on modern rock radio. After releasing the Lull EP in October 1991 on Caroline Records, the band formally signed with Virgin Records, which was affiliated with Caroline. The band supported the album with a tour that included opening for bands such as the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Jane's Addiction, and Guns N' Roses. During the tour, Iha and Wretzky went through <b>a</b> <b>messy</b> breakup, Chamberlin became addicted to narcotics and alcohol, and Corgan entered a deep depression, writing some songs for the upcoming album in the parking garage where he lived at the time.|$|E
