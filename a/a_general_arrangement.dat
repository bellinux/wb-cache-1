In general, the cohomology of the complement of <b>a</b> <b>general</b> complex <b>arrangement</b> is well behaved and well understood. In this paper we consider the homotopy theory of such spaces.

In particular, in the case of arrangements in a three-dimensional vector space, we find that whether or not the complement is Eilenberg-MacLane depends solely on its fundamental group...|$|R

In De Jussieu's system (1789), he followed Ray, arranging his Monocotyledones into three classes based on stamen position and placing them between Acotyledones and Dicotyledones.

40|$|Abstract. Many {{computational}} geometry algorithms involve {{the construction and}} maintenance of planar arrangements of conic arcs. Implementing <b>a</b> <b>general,</b> robust <b>arrangement</b> package for conic arcs handles most practical cases of planar arrangements covered in literature. A possible approach for implementing robust geometric algorithms is to use exact algebraic number types — yet this {{may lead to a}} very slow, inefficient program. In this paper we suggest a simple technique for filtering the computations involved in the arrangement construction: when constructing an arrangement vertex, we keep track of the steps that lead to its construction and the equations we need to solve to obtain its coordinates. This construction history can be used for answering predicates very efficiently, compared to a naïve implementation with an exact number type. Furthermore, using this representation most arrangement vertices may be computed approximately at first and can be refined later on in cases of ambiguity. Since such cases are relatively rare, the resulting implementation is both efficient and robust. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} light {{position}} calibration technique based on <b>a</b> <b>general</b> <b>arrangement</b> {{of at least}} two reflective spheres in a single image. Contrary to other techniques we do not directly intersect rays for triangulation but instead solve for the optimal light position by evaluating the image-space error of the light highlights reflected from the spheres. This approach has been very successful in the field of Structure-from-Motion estimation. It has not been applied to light source calibration because determining the reflection point on the sphere to project the highlight back in the image is a challenging problem. We show a solution and define a novel, non-linear error function to recover the position of a point light source. We also introduce a light position estimation that is based on observing the light source directly in multiple images which does not use any reflections. Finally, we evaluate both proposed techniques and the classical ray intersection method in several scenarios with real data...|$|E

40|$|In a cold-dark-matter universe, cosmological {{structure}} formation proceeds {{in rough}} analogy to origami folding. Dark matter occupies a three-dimensional ‘sheet, ’ non-intersecting in six-dimensional velocity-position phase space.

The regions outlined by these caustics, which we call streams, may be colored according to the two possible orientations of initial basis vectors, a two-coloring such that adjacent streams are not colored the same.

Previous research has revealed deficiencies in ship engine department work environments, {{and their impact}} on crew productivity, health and wellbeing. OBJECTIVE: Connect operational task demands to pragmatic physical design and layout solutions by implementing a user-centric perspective. METHODS: Three focus groups, each consisting of three marine engineers participated in this study. Focus groups were divided into two sessions: first, to investigate the end-user's operational requirements and their relationship with ship physical design and layout. Second, criteria formulated from group discussions were applied to a ship design case study. All focus group sessions were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim.

40|$|Many {{have argued}} {{that there is no}} silver bullet capable of solving the complex and interdependent {{problems}} of climate change, sustainability, and economic development. A consensus is emerging, however, that a major culprit at the intersection of these problems is what the Stern Review (1) called the “greatest and widest-ranging market failure ever seen ”- the failure of the market to send proper signals about the real costs of greenhouse gas emissions. This is one of a long list of market failures surrounding open-access resources (2 - 6).

40|$|In a cold-dark-matter universe, cosmological {{structure}} formation proceeds {{in rough}} analogy to origami folding. Dark matter occupies a three-dimensional 'sheet' of free- fall observers, non-intersecting in six-dimensional velocity-position phase space. At early times, the sheet was flat like an origami sheet, i. e. velocities were essentially zero, {{but as time}} passes, the sheet folds up to form cosmic structure. The present paper further illustrates this analogy, and clarifies a Lagrangian definition of caustics and streams: caustics are two-dimensional surfaces in this initial sheet along which it folds, tessellating Lagrangian space into a set of three-dimensional regions, i. e. streams. The main scientific result of the paper is that streams may be colored by only two colors, with no two neighbouring streams (i. e. streams {{on either side of}} a caustic surface) colored the same. The two colors correspond to positive and negative parities of local Lagrangian volumes. This is a severe restriction on the connectivity and therefore arrangement of streams in Lagrangian space, since arbitrarily many colors can be necessary to color <b>a</b> <b>general</b> <b>arrangement</b> of three-dimensional regions. This stream two-colorability has consequences from graph theory, which we explain. Then, using N-body simulations, we test how these caustics correspond in Lagrangian space to the boundaries of haloes, filaments and walls. We also test how well outer caustics correspond to a Zel'dovich-approximation prediction. Comment: Clarifications and slight changes to match version accepted to MNRAS. 9 pages, 5 figure...|$|E
