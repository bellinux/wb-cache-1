5|$|In Soho {{but almost}} nowhere else, {{such things as}} Italian pasta, and Parmesan cheese, olive oil, salame, and {{occasionally}} Parma ham were to be had....With southern vegetables such as <b>aubergines,</b> red and green peppers, fennel, the tiny marrows called by the French courgettes and in Italy zucchini, much the same situation prevailed.|$|E
5|$|The {{ingredients}} of Mediterranean cuisine are {{to an extent}} {{different from those of}} the cuisine of Northern Europe, with olive oil instead of butter, wine instead of beer. The list of available ingredients has changed over the centuries. One major change was the introduction of many foods by the Arabs to Portugal, Spain and Sicily in the Middle Ages. Those foods included <b>aubergines,</b> spinach, sugar cane, rice, apricots and citrus fruits, creating the distinctive culinary tradition of Al-Andalus.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, {{isolated}} {{communities were}} unable to access produce {{that the majority of}} Britain would such as peppers or <b>aubergines.</b> Artisan Welsh produce was limited or non-existent, farms rarely made their own cheese, and Welsh wine was of poor quality. By the 1990s, historical Welsh foods were going through a revival. Farmers' markets became more popular, Welsh organic vegetables and farm-made cheese started to appear in supermarkets. Other modern Welsh characteristics are more subtle, such as supermarkets offering salty butters and laverbread or butchers labelling beef skirt as 'cawl meat'.|$|E
40|$|<b>Aubergine</b> allergy is rare {{outside of}} India {{and the far}} east, and very few cases have been reported. We {{describe}} a case of <b>aubergine</b> allergy in a 9 -year-old girl of Anglo-Indian descent who also had sensitivity to potato, coincidental oral allergy syndrome, and latex sensitisation with mild oral symptoms on consuming kiwi fruit. Specific IgE to <b>aubergine</b> was negative, but skin testing was positive to both raw and cooked <b>aubergine.</b> With early and increased consumption of exotic vegetables in western countries, more cases of <b>aubergine</b> allergy can be expected and negative blood tests do not exclude type 1 sensitivity...|$|R

5|$|The term iftar has a {{different}} meaning in Ramadan where {{it is used to}} describe the 'breaking of fasting' unlike its common meaning of breakfast in the morning. Iftar begins with soup, either made from lentils, vegetables or freekeh. Shurbat freekeh ("freekeh soup") is made from cracked, green wheat cooked in chicken broth. There is a wide variety of meals served during iftar, ranging from small plates or bowls vegetable-based courses or saniyyehs (large plates or trays) of a particular meat. Common small dishes on the dinner table are bamia—a name for okra in tomato paste, mloukhiyeh—a corchorus stew—or maqali, an array of fried tomatoes, <b>aubergines,</b> potatoes, peppers and zucchini. Pilaf or plain freekeh are normally served alongside the dinner meat. Each household prepares extra food to provide for their neighbors and the less fortunate—who must receive an equal version of the food eaten at home.|$|E
5|$|In 1946 David {{returned}} to England, where food rationing imposed during the Second World War remained in force. Dismayed by {{the contrast between}} the bad food served in Britain and the simple, excellent food to which she had become used in France, Greece and Egypt, she began to write magazine articles about Mediterranean cooking. They attracted favourable attention, and in 1950, at the age of 36, she published A Book of Mediterranean Food. Her recipes called for ingredients such as <b>aubergines,</b> basil, figs, garlic, olive oil and saffron, which at the time were scarcely available in Britain. Books on French, Italian and, later, English cuisine followed. By the 1960s David was a major influence on British cooking. She was deeply hostile to anything second-rate, and to over-elaborate cooking and bogus substitutes for classic dishes and ingredients. In 1965 she opened a shop selling kitchen equipment, which continued to trade under her name after she left it in 1973. Her reputation rests on her articles and her books, which have been continually reprinted. Between 1950 and 1984 she published eight books; after her death her literary executor completed a further four that she had planned and worked on.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the well-known potato dishes such as Gratin dauphinois, cooking au gratin is a widely used cooking technique {{in the preparation of}} numerous dishes including many meat, fish, vegetable and pasta dishes, fennel, leeks, crab meat, celeriac and <b>aubergines</b> (eggplant).|$|E
50|$|Beguni (বেগুনী) is a Bengali snack made of {{eggplant}} (also {{known as}} <b>aubergine</b> or brinjal) which is sliced and battered before being either fried or deep fried in oil. A similar European dish {{is known as}} <b>aubergine</b> fritters.|$|R
25|$|The Arabic name is {{the common}} source of all the European names for this plant, but through two {{distinct}} paths of transmission, with the melongene family coming through the eastern Mediterranean, and the <b>aubergine</b> family through the western Mediterranean. In the western Mediterranean, the Arabic (al)-bāḏinjān was borrowed as Spanish alberengena and berenjena, Catalan albergínia, and Portuguese beringela, whence the modern French <b>aubergine</b> (and the earlier albergine, albergaine, albergame, belingèle), {{the source of the}} British English <b>aubergine.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Aubergine</b> was a {{restaurant}} in Chelsea, London. Owned by A-Z Restaurants, it was opened under chef Gordon Ramsay in 1993. <b>Aubergine</b> was awarded two Michelin stars in 1997, which it held until Ramsay left the restaurant in 1998 following the sacking of Marcus Wareing from sister restaurant L'Oranger. It subsequently reopened and held a single Michelin star under William Drabble until he left the restaurant in 2009. <b>Aubergine</b> closed in 2010, pending a relaunch as an informal Italian restaurant.|$|R
25|$|In 1998, Ramsay {{opened his}} own {{restaurant}} in Chelsea, Restaurant Gordon Ramsay, {{with the help}} of his father-in-law, Chris Hutcheson, and his former colleagues at <b>Aubergines.</b> The restaurant gained its third Michelin star in 2001, making Ramsay the first Scot to achieve that feat.|$|E
25|$|The {{plant species}} {{originated}} in cultivation. It has been cultivated in {{southern and eastern}} Asia since prehistory. The first known written record of the plant is found in Qimin Yaoshu, an ancient Chinese agricultural treatise completed in 544. The numerous Arabic and North African names for it, along {{with the lack of}} the ancient Greek and Roman names, indicate it was introduced throughout the Mediterranean area by the Arabs in the early Middle Ages. A book on agriculture by Ibn Al-Awwam in 12th-century Arabic Spain described how to grow <b>aubergines.</b> Records exist from later medieval Catalan and Spanish.|$|E
25|$|The {{island has}} a long history of {{producing}} a variety of noted cuisines and wines, to the extent that Sicily is sometimes nicknamed God's Kitchen because of this. Every part of Sicily has its speciality (for example Cassata is typical of Palermo, even if available everywhere in Sicily, as is Granita, a Catania speciality). The ingredients are typically rich in taste while remaining affordable to the general public The savoury dishes of Sicily are viewed to be healthy, using fresh vegetables and fruits, such as tomatoes, artichokes, olives (including olive oil), citrus, apricots, <b>aubergines,</b> onions, beans, raisins commonly coupled with seafood, freshly caught from the surrounding coastlines, including tuna, sea bream, sea bass, cuttlefish, swordfish, sardines, and others.|$|E

25|$|Eggplant (Solanum melongena), or <b>aubergine,</b> is {{a species}} of nightshade, grown for its edible fruit. Eggplant is the common name in North America, Australia and New Zealand, but British English uses the French word <b>aubergine.</b> It is known in South Asia and South Africa as brinjal.|$|R
25|$|Eggplant {{is often}} stewed, {{as in the}} French ratatouille. Eggplant is also often deep fried as in the Italian parmigiana di melanzane, the Turkish karnıyarık, or Turkish and Greek musakka/moussaka, and Middle Eastern and South Asian dishes. Eggplants can also be {{battered}} before deep-frying and served with a sauce made of tahini and tamarind. In Iranian cuisine, it is blended with whey as kashk e bademjan, tomatoes as mirza ghassemi, or made into stew as khoresh-e-bademjan. It can be sliced and deep-fried, then served with plain yogurt (optionally topped with a tomato and garlic sauce), {{such as in the}} Turkish dish patlıcan kızartması (meaning fried <b>aubergines),</b> or without yogurt, as in patlıcan şakşuka. Perhaps the best-known Turkish eggplant dishes are imam bayıldı (vegetarian) and karnıyarık (with minced meat).|$|E
500|$|In {{her other}} books David gives recipes {{from around the}} Mediterranean, {{including}} gazpacho and tortillas from Spain; dolmádés, and eggs with skordalia from Greece, mutton-stuffed <b>aubergines,</b> yoghurt soup, and a stew of carrots and rice from Turkey; and a Syrian dish of chicken with almonds and cream. From further afield she includes Mauritian prawn chutney; iced cucumber and beetroot soup from Russia; a Persian [...] "maqlub" [...] of <b>aubergines,</b> rice and mutton; Sikh kebabs and garam masala from India; and Armenian pizza, claimed to be older than the Italian version.|$|E
500|$|Caroline Stacey, {{writing in}} The Independent, calls the book [...] "her hymn of longing to the cooking around the {{southern}} shores", noting that it [...] "changed what the British middle classes ate", {{and that she}} [...] "ushered not only olive oil and garlic, but also <b>aubergines,</b> courgettes and basil on to the stripped-pine tables of 1960s kitchens." ...|$|E

Among her recipes are asparagus with Parmesan cheese, cold roast duck {{on a bed of}} fresh mint, paupiettes of sole in lettuce leaves, broad beans with bacon, and <b>aubergines</b> à la Provençale.|$|E
500|$|David {{identifies}} [...] "the ever recurring elements" [...] in {{the food}} of this extensive region as olive oil, saffron, garlic, [...] "pungent" [...] local wines, {{as well as the}} [...] "aromatic perfume" [...] of herbs, especially rosemary, wild marjoram, and basil, and the bright colours of fresh foods in the markets, [...] "pimentos, <b>aubergines,</b> tomatoes, olives, melons, figs" [...] and [...] "shiny fish, silver, vermilion, or tiger-striped".

500|$|John Koski, {{writing in}} the Daily Mail, notes {{that most of the}} {{publishers}} at the time thought a cookery book [...] "at best absurd" [...] when there was so little food to cook, and [...] "the ingredients of the Mediterranean lands – olive oil, saffron, garlic, basil, <b>aubergines,</b> figs, pistachio nuts – were hardly to be found in Central London, and readers had to rely on memory or imagination" [...] to enjoy David's recipes. All the same, the recipes were [...] "honest", [...] "collected in Provence, Italy, Corsica, Malta and Greece", and the book was [...] "acclaimed as a serious work". Within a few years, Koski observes, [...] "paella, moussaka, ratatouille, hummus and gazpacho had become familiar in home kitchens, restaurants and supermarkets throughout the country." ...|$|E

2500|$|Upon {{his return}} to London in 1993, Ramsay was offered the {{position}} of head chef (under chef-patron Pierre Koffmann) at the Three Michelin starred La Tante Claire in Chelsea. Shortly thereafter, Marco Pierre White re-entered his life, offering to set him up with a head chef position and 10% share in the Rossmore, owned by White's business partners. The restaurant was renamed Aubergine {{and went on to}} win its first Michelin star fourteen months later. In 1997, Aubergine won its second Michelin star. [...] Despite the restaurant's success, a dispute with Ramsay's business owners as they wanted to turn <b>Aubergines</b> into a chain and Ramsay's dream of running his own restaurant led to his leaving the partnership in 1997.|$|E
2500|$|In botany, a berry is a {{fleshy fruit}} without a stone {{produced}} {{from a single}} flower containing one ovary. Berries so defined include grapes, currants, and tomatoes, as well as cucumbers, eggplants (<b>aubergines)</b> and bananas, but exclude certain fruits commonly called berries, such as strawberries and raspberries. The berry {{is the most common}} type of fleshy fruit in which the entire outer layer of the ovary wall ripens into a potentially edible [...] "pericarp". Berries may be formed from one or more carpels from the same flower (i.e. from a simple or a compound ovary). The seeds are usually embedded in the fleshy interior of the ovary, but there are some non-fleshy exceptions, such as peppers, with air rather than pulp around their seeds.|$|E
