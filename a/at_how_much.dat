5|$|During {{the spring}} of 1990, Anjali Dutt was hired to replace Moulder, who had left {{to work with the}} bands Shakespears Sister and Ride. Dutt {{assisted}} in the recording of vocals and several guitar tracks. During this period, the band recorded in various studios, often spending just a single day at a studio before deciding that it was unsuitable. In May 1990, My Bloody Valentine settled on Protocol in Holloway as their primary location, and work began in earnest on the album, as well as a second EP, Tremolo. Like Glider, Tremolo contained a song—"To Here Knows When"—that would later appear on Loveless. The band stopped recording during the summer of 1990 in order to tour in support of the release of Glider. When Moulder returned to the project in August, he was surprised by how little work had been completed. By that point Creation Records was concerned <b>at</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> the album was costing. Moulder left again in March 1991 to work for the noise pop band The Jesus and Mary Chain.|$|E
500|$|A {{scene in}} the film portrays the violent {{destruction}} of the towering Na'vi Hometree, which collapses in flames after a missile attack, coating the landscape with ash and floating embers.

500|$|The {{graphics}} and art {{design of the}} game was praised. Brandon Justice from Electronic Gaming Monthly stated that he expected the game to look [...] "bland" [...] due to its setting, but he was surprised <b>at</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> variety and color there was. The game's level design and vibrant colors were also praised. Critics agreed that the game's setting, Dubai, was excellent and well-realized; some critics praised Yager for adding different details to the game's world. The terrain and landscape was praised for being interesting, unique, and creating [...] "fantastic set piece battles". Some commented that the sand mechanic sometimes became gimmicky. Many criticized the game's poor textures and the poor rendering of cutscenes.|$|E

500|$|The {{destruction}} of the Na'vi habitat Hometree reminded commentators of the September 11 attack on the World Trade Center, one calling it a [...] "tacky metaphor" [...] and others criticizing Cameron for his [...] "audacious willingness to question the sacred trauma of 9/11". Cameron {{said that he was}} [...] "surprised <b>at</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> it did look like September 11", but added that he did not think that it was necessarily a bad thing. A French critic wrote: [...] "How can one not see the analogy {{with the collapse of the}} towers of the World Trade Center? [...] Then, after that spectacular scene, all is justified [...] indigenous peoples (the allied forces)... to kill those who [...] just like terrorists." [...] Another writer noted that [...] "the U.S.' stand-ins are the perpetrators, and not the victims" [...] and described this reversal as [...] "the movie’s most seditious act".|$|E
500|$|When Rhodes was {{involved}} in matches, Cardus believed that [...] "he {{was not a man}} given to affability", showing annoyance on the field and being critical of the performances of others. According to historian Anthony Woodhouse, Rhodes was a [...] "dour, methodical and calculating cricketer." [...] Not popular in the way that a player like Hirst was popular, Rhodes [...] "commanded respect rather than plaudits" [...] in the words of Bowes. An introvert, he did not always get along with the more extrovert Hirst, possibly owing to mutual jealousy and some of Hirst's jocular comments, and was rarely pictured smiling. However, Rhodes became more relaxed and approachable in later life, particularly after his eyesight failed. Cardus was surprised, after meeting him in 1950, <b>at</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> more readily Rhodes engaged in conversation, commenting that [...] "history comes from his mouth in rivers". His obituary in The Times concluded: [...] "Gruff or mellow, he was all of a piece, a fighting Yorkshireman, superbly gifted." ...|$|E

That doesn't mean that there's no gun use, so I did find it really interesting. For me, the thing is, it blew me away that members of [...] Parliament were speaking about this. One, because it's a music video, and two, because don't you guys have television shows out there that show crime? It's really strange to me. I don't understand why pop stars are put on such a high pedestal over other celebrities. Why do members of Parliament feel that they need to scrutinize her for having a gun, and 'She's in the public,' and 'She should know better,' and 'She's a role model,' but what about every other celebrity out there? What about every other actor? That's very strange to me. I was really surprised <b>at</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> the gun use was scrutinized. [...] a professional criminal, so it makes sense he has a gun. We shouldn't censor ourselves." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the view}} of {{students}} of historiography such as Ernst Breisach, all biographers are to some degree psychohistorians, and any biography that refused to examine motives, character traits, {{and the depth of}} personality would be flat and uninteresting. But Brodie became interested in applying the theories of professional psychoanalysts to the study of historical personalities, a subject especially popular during the mid-twentieth century. At first Brodie was amused <b>at</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> psychoanalysis had [...] "become a religion" [...] to its practitioners, but she later become a committed devotee of psychoanalytic theory. Brodie made a number of acquaintances among psychoanalysts, who helped her evaluate Thaddeus Stevens, notably Ralph R. Greenson, with whom she developed a close personal and professional relationship. Both the Brodies also subjected themselves to psychoanalysis, he for insomnia and she for chronic mild depression and sexual problems. (Bernard's employer, the RAND Corporation, paid most of the bills.) Brodie's interest in psychology during this period was heightened by family problems: her mother attempted suicide three times, the second by cutting herself with a Catholic crucifix and the third (which succeeded) by setting herself on fire.|$|E
500|$|Bates goes {{hunting with}} a native, who brings down a crested oropendola with a {{blowpipe}} {{at a range}} of 30 yards (27 metres); {{he notes that the}} usefully silent weapon can kill at twice that range, but that he and Wallace [...] "found it very difficult to hold steady the long tubes". Around a campfire, he listens to tales; the Bouto or river dolphin used to take [...] "the shape of a beautiful woman, with hair hanging loose to her heels, and walking ashore at night in the streets of Ega, to entice the young men down to the water" [...] where the Bouto would grab them and [...] "plunge beneath the waves with a triumphant cry". They go turtle-hunting; and Bates kills an alligator with a heavy stick. He finds many footprints of the jaguar, and [...] "the great pleasure" [...] of seeing the [...] "rare and curious umbrella bird". Arrived in Catua, he admires a woman of 17: [...] "her figure was almost faultless", and her blue mouth [...] "gave quite a captivating finish to her appearance", but she was [...] "extremely bashful". He is amazed <b>at</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> alcohol the [...] "shy Indian and Mameluco maidens" [...] can drink, never giving way to their suitors without it.|$|E
2500|$|In 1999, Smith re-joined Iron Maiden, {{along with}} vocalist Bruce Dickinson, who commented, [...] "When {{he left the}} band in 1990, I think {{everybody}} was a bit surprised <b>at</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> we missed him and certainly, I don't think anybody had realized how much the fans would miss him – big time. I wouldn't have rejoined Iron Maiden if he wasn't in the band. I just don't {{think it would have}} been complete without Adrian, and now, it's great having three guitarists." [...] The band embarked on a short tour, after which the new line-up's first album, Brave New World, was recorded with producer Kevin Shirley and released in 2000.|$|E

2500|$|Reviewing {{the first}} volume for The Fandom Post, Kate O’Neil gave it a grade of B.

[...] She was mildly critical of the series' plot, saying that the [...] "motivation of the players is shaky", and criticized the [...] "simplicity" [...] of the backstory.|$|E

There was the great difficulty of keeping it clear, and of getting space between the trunks standing at different distances - and the place and relative bulk of those trunks change with the perspective - {{to make it so}} that one can breathe and walk around in it, and to make you smell the fragrance of the wood." ...|$|E
2500|$|McNulty mentors Brian Baker, {{a younger}} patrol {{officer in the}} Western, whom he and Bunk end up {{referring}} to as [...] "good police." [...] He also significantly reduces his drinking, sometimes resolving to stay sober despite pressure from his friends. Bunk and Freamon are amazed and slightly dismayed <b>at</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> McNulty has changed, and Elena even expresses regret for having left him. McNulty soon begins to miss the MCU, and quietly begins getting closer to Bodie {{in the hopes of}} turning him into an informant against Marlo. After Stanfield lieutenant Monk Metcalf sees Bodie with McNulty, Bodie is killed as a precaution. McNulty feels guilty and rejoins the MCU, much to the delight of Freamon and Daniels.

J-Pop! called the song a [...] "classic pop tune", and noted the [...] "J-Pop-style approach" [...] of [...] "Sakura Drops", also shared with her previous single [...] "Hikari", which was stronger than anything seen before in her music, as opposed to her earlier R/club styled songs. He likened the song to those of Yumi Matsutoya, feeling its [...] "straightforward emotional expression" [...] and [...] "pop arrangement" [...] left the biggest impression. He felt that Utada's signature lyrics and vocals made the song stand out over other pop-genre songs.|$|E
2500|$|On 15 August 1714, the Feast of the Dormition, when Constantin Brâncoveanu {{was also}} celebrating his 60th birthday, {{he and his}} four sons and his advisor Ianache were brought before Sultan Ahmed III of Turkey. Diplomatic representatives of Austria, Russia, France and England were also present. After all of his fortune has been seized, in {{exchange}} for the life of his family he was asked to renounce the Orthodox Christian faith.

On July 21, 2010, Zuckerberg reported that the company reached the 500 million-user mark.

If you look <b>at</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> of our page is taken up with ads compared to the average search query. The average for us is a little less than 10 percent of the pages and the average for search is about 20 percent taken up with ads... That's the simplest thing we could do. But we aren't like that.

During that interview, Knight said, [...] "I'm getting a bit controversial here, but there is a snobbish attitude towards Gilbert and Sullivan in the opera world.... I believe in excellence.

The Portuguese assumed they must be the descendants of shipwrecked sailors from the previous century, given how light their skin color was (they described them as gente branca (white people), the color of Arabs, Indians or Javanese). These [...] "white people" [...] had settled on a river island they called [...] "Ilha de Santa Cruz" [...] in the Fanjahira river, just west {{of what was to}} become Fort Dauphin, north of Vinanibe. The structure they found there was called Tranovato ("House of Stone"). This structure appeared to be a stone tower or fort with two doors. There was also a fine marble padrao with the Portuguese coat of arms carved on one side, with REX PORTUGALENSIS below it. The other side had a Holy Cross carved into it. Close to this was a stone cross. They also found three graves with crosses.|$|E

[...] When asked if she would ever make a full-time return, Lawrence said, [...] "Once you're re-established, you're a character that other characters can go and visit.
