40|$|In this paper, I review two {{recently}} completed research papers 2 that purport to provide scientific evidence regarding the <b>adverse</b> <b>health</b> <b>effects</b> of Industrial Wind Turbines (IWTs). Having done so, I {{find that they}} provide no scientific information. Rather, they present disinformation which {{may be used to}} improperly shape public policy. Each paper essentially attributes increased reports of <b>adverse</b> <b>health</b> <b>effects</b> to some form of mass hysteria. Chapman gilds this contention with quasi-scientific “labels, ” such as a “mass psychogenic illness ” or a “psychogenic nocebo phenomenon. ” With less jargon, Crichton comes to the same conclusion [...] <b>adverse</b> <b>health</b> <b>effects</b> can be explained by psychological expectations. Both papers conclude that the <b>adverse</b> <b>health</b> <b>effects</b> attributed to IWTs are not actually caused by the audible and non-audible (infrasound) noise they are known to generate.

In adults, the thyroid gland helps regulate the metabolism by releasing hormones, while in children, the thyroid helps in proper development. The NAS, in its 2005 report, Health Implications of Perchlorate Ingestion, emphasized that this effect, {{also known as}} Iodide Uptake Inhibition (IUI) is not an <b>adverse</b> <b>health</b> <b>effect.</b> However, in January 2008, California's Department of Toxic Substances Control stated that perchlorate is becoming {{a serious threat to}} human health and water resources. In 2010, the EPA's Office of the Inspector General determined that the agency's own perchlorate reference dose of 24.5 parts per billion protects against all human biological effects from exposure. This finding was due to a significant shift in policy at the EPA in basing its risk assessment on non-adverse effects such as IUI instead of adverse effects. The Office of the Inspector General also found that because the EPA's perchlorate reference dose is conservative and protective of human health further reducing perchlorate exposure below the reference dose does not effectively lower risk.|$|E
