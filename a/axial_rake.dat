40|$|Abstract. Titanium alloys are difficult-to-cut materials, and {{the rapid}} wear of cutter {{is a big}} problem for {{machining}} of these alloys. In this paper, the wear characteristics of seven milling cutters in milling of TC 4 (Ti 6 Al 4 V) titanium alloys are investigated. The results indicated that the averaged flank wear of each cutter linearly increases as the accumulated cutting length expands. Large radial rake angle as well as <b>axial</b> <b>rake</b> angle is favor for reducing cutter wear...|$|E
40|$|High speed {{machining}} {{was developed}} over {{sixty years ago}} and at present is still limited {{to just a few}} materials, these being aluminium and its alloys, hardened steels for the mould and die industry and titanium for aerospace applications. Recently there has been additional work in high speed machining on some of the more exotic aerospace alloys such as inconel and nimonic alloys. This thesis addresses the problems encountered when machining high chromium/nickel steel alloys {{that are part of the}} stainless steel family. Three grades of stainless steel were selected for this purpose, these being a martensitic grade (416) and two austenitic grades (303 & 316). These materials were high speed milled at cuttinspeeds of up to 3, 000 m min- 1, via the use of two machining methodologies; high torque-low speed and low torque-high speed milling. High torque-low speed milling was accomplished through the use of specially designed large diameter dual-plane balanced face mills, that when rotated at 6, 000 rev mon- 1 generated a cuting speed of 3, 000 m min- 1. These cutters were capable of machining three grades of stainless steel at approximately ten times that of the cutting speeds normally selected for materials that are cut conventionally. However, at the elevated cutting speeds machining of the two austenitic grades of stainless steel exhibited high tool wear rates which contributed to both poor surface finish and high cutting forces. The lo torque-high speed machining of these stainless steel grades was undertaken via specifically designed variable <b>axial</b> <b>rake</b> angle cutters in conjunction with a gear-driven speed increaser. This head gave a maxiumum cutting speed of 750 m min- 1 when the cutters were rotated at 20, 000 rev min- 1. Experiments indicated that the three grades of stainless steel could be machined at high rotational speeds, with good surface finish produced with negative <b>axial</b> <b>rake</b> angled tools. This machining strategy caused tool 'ironing' of the machined surface. cutting forces were lower at all cutting speeds when a positive <b>axial</b> <b>rake</b> angled tool was employed, although at elevated cutting speeds tool wear was excessive regardless of any axia rake angle geometry...|$|E
40|$|This master thesis {{has been}} {{performed}} on and written at Sandvik Coromant in Sandviken {{which is a}} division of Sandvik AB. Sandvik AB is an engineering industry with focus on high technology and the companies turn over for 2004 were 7 billion USD. The business is located in 130 different countries and has an estimated number of 38 000 employees all over the world. This master thesis is a continuance of a previously conducted thesis made by Petter Stenmark. The purpose of the this project were to investigate the factors that affect the form error in finishing milling with insert mills and present effective ways of decreasing these errors. Seven different variables has been investigated in this thesis and these are: • <b>Axial</b> <b>rake</b> angle • Feed per tooth • Radius of cutting edge • Young’s modulus • Mass distribution • Workpiece material • Milling machines A increase in <b>axial</b> <b>rake</b> angle has, through simulations, calculations and experiments with solid mills, been verified to decrees the form error {{which was one of}} the conclusion Stenmark had made. No conclusions could, however, be made regarding the percentile reduction of the form error the <b>axial</b> <b>rake</b> angle had. The influence of the feed and the radius of the cutting edge showed to be somewhat linked to each other. An increase of cutting feed did not necessarily increase the normal force Fy that controls the magnitude of the deflection to the presumed levels. This had a lot to do with the relation between the edge radius and the chip thickness. If the edge radius were very large would the divergens between a feed 0. 1 and 0. 3 mm not effect the form error very much. The next two variables, which are Young’s modulus and mass distribution, are also linked to each other. Many prototype cutters in different material were produced and experimented with so that different material related calculations could be verified. The result form these experiments and calculations were that the cutter shaft stiffens was secondary while the mass location had larger importance on the form error. Different materials have different machine ability. For tougher materials larger cutting forces are required to cut a chip. The workpiece material will because of this influence the form error. The selection of milling machine is one of the most influential parameter that governs the form error. Different machines have different dynamic characteristics because of variation in bearing diameter and positions, mass distribution in the spindle and so on and the variations in form error as a result of these characteristics showed to be large.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{recognized}} that on ductile materials, high radial tool engagement conditions produce the largest burrs in face milling operations. Ideally, high radial engagement is avoided by configuring the tool path such that the mill is kept within the feasible offset region –a region that satisfies user requirements– of a given workpiece geometry and material. Fulfillment of this condition, however, is often difficult due to geometrical complexity of the manufactured components and cycle time constraints. For this reason there is great motivation to minimize burr formation at high tool engagement. In this paper, the mechanisms of burr formation {{and the effect of}} cutting parameters under high radial engagement are investigated, and possible burr minimization strategies are discussed. To this end, face milling tests results conducted by CODEF members and other researchers on different materials were examined. The proposed minimization strategies focus on the optimization of the following parameters: depth of cut, insert nose sharpness, lead angle, and <b>axial</b> <b>rake</b> angle, to promote a transition from primary to secondary burr formation...|$|E
