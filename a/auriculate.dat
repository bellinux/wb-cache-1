500|$|The Golondrina {{point is}} {{medium-sized}} and lanceolate-shaped with a lenticular cross-section that exhibits convex sides. The type displays a distinctive <b>auriculate</b> ("eared") stem with basal corners that flare outward. The blade edges are slightly serrated with a recurved outline—wide at the bottom, then narrowing before becoming wide and then thin {{again at the}} distal end, a so-called [...] "fish shaped profile". The flaking style is generally random, with no attention given to alignment of flake scars. However, collateral flaking—where parallel flakes have been removed equally, resulting in a median ridge on the blade edges—has also been observed in some specimens. The basal edge of the Golondrina presents concave with a deep basal notch that varies from a flattened, inverted, v-shape to recurved. The Golondrina point can range in length from 32–61 mm, with a width ranging from 23–32 mm and a thickness from 6–8 mm. The width of the base ranges from 22–29 mm with a typical basal concavity of 4 mm or more. The Golondrina is unfluted, without a longitudinal channel flake.|$|E

50|$|The {{specific}} epithet auriculata {{refers to}} the two ear-shaped (<b>auriculate)</b> outgrowths at the junctions of the leaf blades and sheaths.|$|E
50|$|The {{species name}} {{refers to the}} shape of the cucullus in the male {{genitalia}} and is derived from Latin auriculatus (meaning <b>auriculate).</b>|$|E
5000|$|The size of {{the shell}} varies between 1.9 mm and 3 mm. The shell is smooth. The {{aperture}} is large and <b>auriculate.</b>|$|E
5|$|Past {{hypotheses}} {{have suggested}} mistakenly that the Golondrina was a descendant or {{variant of the}} Plainview type. Although the two points exhibit similarities, particularly in terms of shape, they are now recognized as separate types. Identification is made {{from a lack of}} an <b>auriculated,</b> fishtail base on the Plainview and a deeper basal concavity on the Golondrina. Plainview points may have served to bring down large bison, while Golondrina points may have been used for killing smaller game such as deer, as well as doubling as a butchering knife. Compared to the split-stem hafting style of the Golondrina point without a deep setting, the shape of the Plainview points would necessitate them being set relatively deeply into a socketed haft that once bound would leave less of the cutting edge exposed. Stratigraphic evidence from the St. Mary's Hall site in southern, central Texas implies that Golondrina may have superseded Plainview on the southern Plains.|$|R
5000|$|The waxy gray-green {{leaves are}} up to 3.5 centimeters long by 2.4 wide. The blades are oval and <b>auriculate</b> (with an earlobe-shaped lobe {{on either side of}} the petiole).|$|E
50|$|The {{aperture}} of a snail shell {{can have}} many other forms: semicircular, trilobate or <b>auriculate.</b> In some gastropods, the aperture is narrowed by protruding plaits, which {{help make the}} soft parts of the animal less vulnerable to predation.|$|E
50|$|Agalinis auriculata is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the broomrape family known by the common names earleaf false foxglove, <b>auriculate</b> false foxglove, and earleaf gerardia.

5000|$|Jill Cowley {{notes that}} R. auriculata has been grown in gardens [...] "for many years" [...] {{under the name}} of a {{different}} species, R. purpurea. She provides a number of distinguishing features, which include the <b>auriculate</b> nature of the leaves, the bright purple colour of the flowers rather than the paler colours of R. purpurea, the relatively shorter white lateral staminodes of R. auriculata, and the latter's deflexed (bent back) labellum.|$|E
50|$|Perennial, {{dioecious}} climber. Shoot length up to 20 m {{and up to}} 6 cm in diameter. Leaves are alternate with 2.5-13 cm long petiole, lamina 12-20 × 11-20 cm, profoundly 5-lobate, more or less <b>auriculate.</b> Upper lamina glabrous {{with clear}} to whitish pustules. Lower lamina paler than upper lamina, glabrous, often with small dark glands along the main nerves. Fresh shoots, lower sides of petioles and leaves are glabrous, sometimes with soft white hairs. Tendrils unequally bifid. Probracts up to 5 mm long.|$|E
50|$|Starry Spikemoss {{plants are}} {{commonly}} confused with a closely related species, Selaginella galeottii. Their appearances are similar however {{the shape of}} the lateral and axillary leaves are different. Axillary and lateral leaves of Selaginella stellata tend to be eciliate and the axillary leaves are biauriculate and conspicuous. Axillary leaves of Selaginella galeottii are rarely <b>auriculate</b> and if they are present they are inconspicuous. Axillary and lateral leaves of Selaginella galeottii also differ in that they have cilia at their base or near their point of attachment.|$|E
50|$|This is {{an annual}} herb growing mostly erect to {{a height of}} 10 to 15 centimeters. The leaves are <b>auriculate</b> (ear-shaped), up to 5 centimeters long by 1.5 wide, and have toothed or lobed edges. They are usually hairy. The flowers have white or {{lavender}} petals with a yellow tinge at the bases. The fruit is an inflated silique drying to a papery texture and measuring about half a centimeter wide. This species is similar to Paysonia stonensis, another Tennessee endemic, from which it differs only in the arrangement of hairs on its fruits.|$|E
5000|$|Roscoea auriculata is a {{perennial}} herbaceous plant. Like {{all members of}} the genus Roscoea, it dies back each year to a short vertical rhizome, to which the tuberous roots are attached. When growth begins again, [...] "pseudostems" [...] are produced: structures which resemble stems but are actually formed from the tightly wrapped bases (sheaths) of its leaves. R. auriculata is usually 20-40 cm tall, with three to seven leaves. The blade of the leaf (the part free from the pseudostem) is 7.5-20 cm long by 2-2.5 cm wide. The leaf sheath is smooth (glabrous) and purple in colour. At the junction of the blade and sheath there are ear-shaped (<b>auriculate)</b> outgrowths.|$|E
50|$|In the {{elongation}} shoot leaves, the petioles {{are short}} and thick, though shorter and thinner {{than those of}} the sucker-shoot leaves. Similarly the leaves are smaller, ranging up to 80 mm long, and the bases are typically only slightly asymmetrical. They have a cordate to <b>auriculate</b> leaf blade base and an acute leaf tip. The primary vein ranges between fully straight and slightly curved as it progresses from base to tip. There are a similar number of secondary veins to those in the other two leaf types, with a usual minimum of eleven pairs; however, the angle of the secondaries to the primary increases towards the base rather than decreasing as seen in the sucker-shoot leaves.|$|E
50|$|Species in Helvella have fruiting bodies (technically ascocarps) {{that grow}} above the ground, and usually have stems. The cup-like fruiting body (the apothecium) can assume {{a variety of}} forms: it may be shaped like an ear (<b>auriculate),</b> or a saddle; it may be convex or irregularly lobed and bent. The spore-bearing surface, the hymenium, can be smooth, wavy or {{wrinkled}} and can range in color from white to black or various shades of gray or brown. Similarly, the outer surface of the fruiting bodies can be smooth, ribbed, or have minute hairlike projections (villi). The stem is cylindrical and tapering or grooved and ribbed. The flesh is usually between 1 - 2 mm thick.|$|E
50|$|Halothamnus auriculus is a sub-shrub up to 90 cm high, with olive-grey or blueish-green pale-striate branches. The {{flat and}} {{slightly}} fleshy leaves are very variably shaped (lanceolate, triangular, ovate, cordate, kidney-shaped, or roundish), up to 68 mm long and 2,5-45 mm wide, with distinct membranous margins, often half-stem-clasping, the lower ones often decurrent, the upper ones often <b>auriculate.</b> The bracts {{are similar to}} the leaves. The bracteoles are adpressed to the perianth, scale-like, surrounded by membranuos margins, shorter than perianth. The flowers are 3,4-1,7 mm long, the stigmas are widened and truncate at the apex. The winged fruit is 12-18 mm in diameter, their wings inserting in or above the middle. The tube of the fruit is broadly barrel-shaped, at its bottom with deep, furrow-like, linear or curved pits.|$|E
5000|$|Malvaviscus is a genus of {{flowering}} {{plants in the}} mallow family, Malvaceae. Common names for species in this genus include Turk's cap mallow, wax mallow, sleeping hibiscus, and mazapan. It belongs {{to a group of}} genera that differ from the closely related Hibiscus in possessing a fruit divided into 5 separate parts (a schizocarp), and having a style surmounted by 10, rather than 5, capitate or capitellate stigmas. Among those genera Malvaviscus is distinguished by having <b>auriculate</b> petals and red, fleshy fruits.The generic name is derived from the Latin words malva, meaning [...] "mallow," [...] and viscus, which means [...] "sticky," [...] referring to the mucilaginous sap produced by members of the genus.The fruit {{can be used to make}} jelly or syrup. Both the fruit and flowers are used to make herbal teas.|$|E
5000|$|Like {{all members}} of the genus Roscoea, it dies back each year to a short {{vertical}} rhizome, to which are attached the tuberous roots.

R. ×&thinsp;beesiana is usually 48-60 cm tall, with seven to nine leaves, of which at most the lowest one consists only of a sheath. Each leaf has a small ligule, extending to about 1-2 mm. The blade of the leaf (the part free from the pseudostem) is usually 8-29 cm long (occasionally as little as 4 cm long) by 2.1-4.5 cm wide. There are small [...] "ears" [...] at the junction of the blade and sheath (i.e. the leaf is somewhat <b>auriculate).</b> The leaf sheath has reddish markings.|$|E

Plants are usually 25 - 35 cm tall, occasionally shorter or up to 45 cm. The first one or two leaves consist only of sheaths; the remaining 5-8(-11) leaves have curved (falcate) blades mainly 8 - 12 cm long by 1 - 2 cm wide (although lengths and widths outside this range are also found). The sheaths sometimes have small 'ears' (<b>auriculate)</b> at the junction of the blade and sheath, where there is also a small ligule, extending to about 1 mm.|$|E
5000|$|Roscoea tumjensis is a {{perennial}} herbaceous plant. Like {{all members of}} the genus Roscoea, it dies back each year to a short vertical rhizome, to which are attached the tuberous roots. When growth begins again, [...] "pseudostems" [...] are produced: structures which resemble stems but are actually formed from the tightly wrapped bases (sheaths) of its leaves. In the case of R. tumjensis, the flowers appear before the leaves are fully grown. Plants are usually 18-25 cm tall, with four to six leaves. The first three to four consist only of sheaths, which may be marked with purple; the remaining leaves have a blade 4-8 cm by 1.5-4 cm, forming 'ears' (<b>auriculate)</b> at the junction of the blade and sheath.

40|$|The {{morphology}} of the antennal funiculus and {{the external}} morphological characteristics {{and distribution of}} sensilla of blow fly, Protophormia terraenovae, have been studied using light and scanning electron microscopy. Cross section of the funiculus is roughly triangular in shape, with an anterior-medial, anterior-lateral, and posterior surface. The latter presents some large-size pits on restricted lateral and median areas of the proximal funiculus, and several smaller-size ones close to the pedicel–funiculus joint. The entire surface of the antennal sub-segment appears densely populated by microtrichia and is inhabited by seven types of sensilla: one trichoid, two basiconic, one <b>auriculate,</b> one coeloconic, and two basiconic-like pit sensilla. Trichoid, basiconic, <b>auriculate</b> and basiconic-like types display a multiporous wall, a feature characteristic of insect olfactory sensilla. It remains to be verified {{whether or not the}} coeloconic structure type has wall pores. The most abundant sensilla are the trichoid ones, which are followed by the basiconic, coeloconic and <b>auriculate</b> types in a decreasing density order. The basiconic-like pit sensilla are present only on the posterior funicular surface, unlike the remaining ones which populate the entire sub-segment. The blow fly’ funiculus displays a significant, even though moderate sexual dimorphism, the female sub-segment being bigger and presenting a higher number of trichoid and <b>auriculate</b> sensilla. The presence of multiple wall pores in most of sensilla types implies an olfactory modality for sensory neurons they accomodate, thus indicating that the blow fly’ funiculus is a plain olfactory organ...|$|E
