Since the current industrial production establishes demands pertaining starch quality, a greater {{attention has been paid}} to development and improvement of existing technological procedures for starch isolated from different botanical sources. This paper describes the procedure for amaranth starch isolation. Starch was isolated from Amaranthus cruentus seeds by low <b>alkaline</b> <b>steeping</b> and protease treatments.

40|$|Rice is {{the staple}} diet of Sri Lankans and mainly {{consumed}} as steamed rice. In {{addition to this}} pre gelatinized milled rice flour is used by some food industries, {{for the production of}} rice noodles, instant hoppers and string hoppers. However, the value addition to rice flour in Sri Lanka is at a minimum level. Therefore, the major objective in the research was to bring value addition to raw rice flour. In starch manufacturing process, it is necessary to remove protein as it can affect starch properties. <b>Alkaline</b> <b>steeping</b> method and enzymatic method were used in this study to remove protein in rice flour. Two rice types, white raw rice and red raw rice were used as a source of starch production. Initial protein percentage in white raw rice and red raw rice were 9. 034 % and 10. 42 % respectively. In <b>alkaline</b> <b>steeping</b> method, milled rice flour was treated with 0. 1 %, - 0. 5 % (w/v) NaOH for 1 - 5 hr. About 89 % of protein can be removed from white raw rice flour by treating with 0. 5 % NaOH for 5 hrs at 30 °C and at a mixing speed of 200 rpm. When red raw rice was treated under the above conditions, 86 % of protein can be removed. In enzymatic method, rice flour slurry was treated with 0. 1 %- 0. 5 % (w/w, dry flour basis) protease enzyme at 55 °C and at a pH 6. 5 for 1 - 5 hrs. After the treatment, sample washing was done in two ways. One part of the sample was washed with water and the other part was washed with 0. 1 % NaOH. Up to 76 % of protein in white raw rice and 68 % of protein in red raw 'rice can be removed by treating with 0. 5 % protease for 5 hours followed by washing with water. When treated with 0. 5 % protease for 5 hrs followed 'by washing with 0. 1 % NaOH, 86 % of protein in white raw rice and 85 % of protein in red raw rice can be removed. In alkaline treatment method, the temperature and mixing speed were changed {{to determine the effects of}} protein removal in white raw rice. While keeping other conditions constant, treatment temperature was increased to 55 °C. According to the results, significant reduction of rice protein was observed at 55 °C than at 30 °C for each NaOH concentration. When the shaking speed of the slurry was 150 rpm while the other conditions were constant, protein removal was slightly lower as compared to a shaking speed of 200 rpm. The change of viscosity with increasing temperature was compared in untreated white raw rice, white raw rice treated with 0. 1 % NaOH for 0. 5 hrs, 0. 5 % NaOH for 5 hrs and 0. 5 % protease enzyme for 5 hrs. The results show that the viscosity increased with decreased residual protein content in each rice sample. Furthermore, rice starch with low protein gelatinizes at low temperature. This property is useful achieving high viscosity at low temperature in the production of starch based thickening agents. As a conclusion, the maximum percentage of protein can be removed from white rice when treated with 0. 5 % NaOH at 55 °C at a shaking speed of 200 rpm. Alkaline method is low cost and more efficient compared to enzymatic method. However, high pH values (pH values> 10) in the alkaline medium may decrease the quality of starch. Furthermore, alkaline method gives out high alkaline effluents which can contribute to environmental pollution. These effects can be overcome by performing a combined method of enzymatic treatment followed by alkaline washing (0. 1 % NaOH) while maintaining an efficient conversion percentage...|$|E
40|$|Significant {{research}} is being conducted to derive environment-friendly, sustainable and fully biodegradable polymers and composites. These help avoid the environmental pollution {{created by the}} conventional non-degradable plastics that end up in landfills. Starch is a yearly renewable plant-based resource that is most abundantly available around the world. Increasing number of scientists have modified starches from potato, corn, rice, etc., to create resins that can replace the more common petroleum based ones. Understanding {{the gravity of the}} situation, the major objectives of this research are as follows: 1. To develop a fully 'green' resin using raw plantain starch and banana microfibrils with the help of minimal and green/ food grade chemicals. 2. To study the effects of chemical and mechanical treatments on morphology, orientation, crystallinity and ultimately tensile strength of the inherently strong liquid crystalline cellulose fibers. 3. To devise an easy to scale up method for fabricating advanced 'green' fiber reinforced composites as a contribution to the greener world. On these lines, starch was isolated from raw plantain pulp using alkaline and non-alkaline methods. A comparative study of the processes used and resulting starch contents was carried out. Starch content of above 80 % was successfully isolated from the plantain fruit by <b>alkaline</b> <b>steeping</b> method using Sodium bisulfite (NaHSO 3), a food grade chemical. The physical and mechanical properties of the obtained starch were characterized and compared with the conventional starches. An environment-friendly cross linker 1, 2, 3, 4 -butane tetracarboxylic acid (BTCA) along with a catalyst, Sodium hypophosphite-monohydrate (SHP), was used to crosslink the plantain starch into a thermoset resin. Further, banana stem fibers were harnessed to extract cellulosic microfibrils and used as the reinforcing element to enhance the modulus (stiffness) of the resin and make it truly 'green'. Liquid Crystalline Cellulose fibers were used as fillers to make a fiber reinforced composite using RP starch based resin. These fibers were characterized for their tensile properties, diameter and crystallinity in order obtain control data and device methods to improve them further. The fibers were subjected to physical (tension) and chemical treatments to enhance their mechanical properties and make them high strength. Various parameters like treatment chemical, load value, duration were varied to carry out a deep study of their effect on the mechanical properties of LCC fibers. A gradual increase in the percentage crystallinity and mechanical properties was seen on optimizing each parameter. A dramatic increase compared to the control fibers was obtained in the tensile modulus and strength on testing the Sodium bisulfite treated fibers under tension at optimum parameters. In summary, a convenient and easy to scale up process was developed to obtain a fiber reinforced composite from plantain-based resin using its pulp, banana stem fibers and LCC yarns. The mechanical and physical properties of this starch suggest that it can be used in place of conventional starch based resins. In addition, the developed process allows using large quantities of raw cull plantains and potentially eliminating the waste problem created by excess production as well as damage caused during their harvest and transportation. 2021 - 02 - 0...|$|E
5|$|Continuing {{upstream}} from Casper, the North Platte bends to the south. The original trail proceeded several {{miles along the}} river to Red Buttes, where {{a bend in the}} river formed a natural amphitheater dominated by red cliffs on the hill above. The river was easier to ford here for those who were unwilling or unable to pay to cross at one of the ferries downstream. This was the last good camp spot before leaving the river and entering the waterless stretch between the North Platte and the Sweetwater River. From here the settlers entered a difficult portion called Rock Avenue which moved from spring to spring across mostly <b>alkaline</b> soil and <b>steep</b> hills until it reached the Sweetwater River. Later settlers who had crossed to the northern side of the river at Casper would come to favor a route through a small valley called Emigrant Gap which headed directly to Rock Avenue, bypassing Red Buttes.|$|R

About 50 mi southwest of Casper the North Platte is joined by the Sweetwater River (Wyoming). This river junction is deep in a canyon now filled by the Pathfinder Reservoir.

40|$|An Ozark and a deltaic {{stream in}} northeastern Arkansas were studied to compare {{physicochemical}} and aquatic macroinvertebrate parameters {{and to determine}} whether the number and kind of organisms increase downstream. Janes Creek, the Ozark-type stream, is clear, spring-fed and <b>alkaline</b> with a <b>steep</b> gradient and high flow velocity; dissolved oxygen values are not limiting. Big Creek, the deltaic stream, is turbid, low in alkalinity and has a slight gradient and low stream velocity. These streams comprise distinct habitats created by differences in substrate, watershed and land use. A total of 122 taxa were collected in both streams, 62 of which were identified to species. Of the total taxa, 100 were found in Janes Creek and 55 were found in Big Creek. Only 33 taxa were common to both streams. Species diversity indices for Janes and Big Creek stations ranged from 3. 272 to 4. 454 and 1. 822 to 2. 905, respectively. Snails which fed on algal film of submerged rocks in pools were characteristic of Janes Creek, whereas oligochaetes which fed on organic detritus were characteristic of Big Creek. Mean numerical standing crop of Big Creek was almost three times that of Janes Creek (726 organisms vs. 265 organisms/m²). Longitudinal zonation was characterized in each stream by an increase in numbers and kinds of aquatic macroinvertebrates downstream. Diversity index values did not completely support this observation, however...|$|R
40|$|In many African countries, {{including}} South Africa, sorghum is malted for the brewing {{of traditional}} beer. In South Africa, most sorghum malting is by traditional outdoor floor malting, whereby the sorghum grain is steeped for about 8 hours, left outdoors to germinate in an uncontrolled environment. These malting conditions (wet grain and {{more or less}} ambient temperature) encourage microbial proliferation. Microorganisms may themselves negatively impact on {{the safety of the}} malts. Of more concern is the proliferation of fungi which can potentially produce highly poisonous mycotoxins in the sorghum malt. Microbial proliferation can also affect the quality of malt, and thereby resulting in undesirable malts. Therefore {{there is a need for}} efficient and safe ways to control microbial growth during sorghum malting. The aim of this research was to determine processes to produce sorghum malt that is free of unwanted yeasts, coliforms, moulds and mycotoxins. The first process investigated involved turning the grains during germination. The second process involved the addition of dilute sodium hydroxide (NaOH) / caustic soda and calcium hydroxide [(Ca(OH) 2]/lime during steeping and the third process was by the use of biological control methods which involved inoculation with microbial starter cultures. The effect of the three processes on the levels of moulds, coliforms, mycotoxins (aflatoxins, fumonisins, deoxynivalenol and zearalenone), cytotoxicity, expressed in terms of their IC 50 (Inhibitory concentration resulting in 50 % inhibition of the cleavage activity) and quality in terms of diastatic power (DP) of sorghum malt were investigated. Turning the sorghum grains during germination did not affect the microbial load of the malt. The total bacterial counts were at high levels of 107 - 109 cfu/g, fungi at 104 - 106 cfu/g and coliforms at 103 - 105 cfu/g. Turned and unturned grains produced malt which showed contamination by about 8 different mould species. Some of these moulds (Fusarium verticillioides, Phoma sorghina. Aspergillus flavus, Alternaria alternata and Penicillium spp.) are known to produce mycotoxins. Malt samples contained fumonisins, deoxynivalenol and zearalenone at levels of 500 mg/kg). Turning had the negative effect of decreasing the DP of the sorghum malt. The reason that turning did not reduce the microbial load is probably due to the fact that the blending of malt as a result of turning ensured that bacteria and moulds were evenly distributed throughout the malt bed. Steeping sorghum grains in 0. 2 % NaOH reduced the level of microbial contamination in the malt. Coliforms and moulds were reduced from 104 and 105 cfu/g respectively, to levels of 102 cfu/g in the malt that do not pose health hazards. The high pH (10 - 13) that resulted from the addition of NaOH probably caused the inhibition of coliforms and moulds by distorting their cell membranes, destroying the proton gradient of the bacterium cell and thus leading to their death. Steeping in 0. 2 % NaOH resulted in malts with no detectable amounts of mycotoxins and no indication of cytotoxicity in the sorghum malt. A further advantage was that the DP of the 0. 2 % NaOH steeped malts was doubled. The addition of about 107 - 108 cfu/ml of Saccharomyces spp. and Pediococcus. pentosaceus cultures to steep water reduced moulds in the malt from 104 cfu/g to 102 cfu/g and coliforms from 104 cfu/g to 102 and < 101 cfu/g, respectively. The antimicrobial activity of the Saccharomyces spp. appears to be mainly due to the competition with the other microorganisms. The antimicrobial activity of P. pentosaceus is mainly attributed to the low pH. In addition to the low pH, production of CO 2, competition for nutrients and the production of antimicrobial activity could have been responsible for the overall antimicrobial activity of P. pentosaceus. Steeping with microbial cultures resulted in malts that contained no traces of mycotoxins and cytotoxicity. The DPs of the sorghum malts were not affected by steeping with microbial cultures. Turning of grains during germination is not a good method to control microbial load during sorghum malting. The addition of dilute NaOH in steeping water is proposed as a chemical method for the control of bacterial and fungal contamination during sorghum malting whereas the use of the Saccharomyces spp. and P. pentosaceus cultures offers a potential alternative as natural, biocontrol agents. However, dilute <b>alkaline</b> <b>steeping</b> is a more favoured method because it is an easier and practical method to put into operation.
