As a child and teenager, she attended both Hebrew school and special classes on Jewish ethics, where she received her [...] "first training in philosophy".

2500|$|Nadan Vidošević {{used his}} {{knowledge}} of economic issues to gain popularity during the recession. He emphasized his business success during the 1990s {{as well as his}} post {{as the president of the}} Croatian Economic Chamber (CEC). However, the press continuously raised the subject of his estate and property <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>was</b> he able to amass such an enormous wealth in a short period of time. He usually responded saying that everything he has he built with hard work and smart business moves. On 9 December Dragan Primorac accused Vidošević of nepotism and criminal, claiming that he employed three of his nephews in the CEC and that his secretary was related to him. Vidošević responded by saying he does not need someone who hits women teaching him moral lessons referring to allegations made to Primorac long ago which claimed he beat his former partner. Primorac accused Vidošević of lying and threatened a lawsuit if he did not apologize to him and his wife. During a debate held on 10 December Primorac and Vidošević exchanged insults, Vidošević repeating his allegations and Primorac demanding an apology. [...] Finally, on 14 December Primorac announced he will be pressing charges against Vidošević claiming he caused great emotional damage to him and especially his wife. [...] Vidošević responded by saying Primorac would do anything to gain attention saying his campaign was falling apart.|$|E
