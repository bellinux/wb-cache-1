2500|$|Hephaestion and Alexander {{grew up in}} a time where, {{according}} to Thomas R. Martin, homosexual affairs were seen as abnormal by majority Greek standards of their time. But Andrew Chugg, Robin Lane Fox and others show different views. According to Eva Cantarella, for instance, male bisexuality was widely permitted and ruled by law, and generally not frowned upon by the public {{to the extent to which}} it remained within the preset limits. The Greeks used to approach the relationships between men in <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>way</b> from how they will be dealt with today (with exceptions of course). For the Greeks [...] "homosexuality was not an exclusive choice. Loving another man was not an option out of the norm, different, somehow deviant. It was just a part of life experience; it was the show of an either sentimental or sexual drive that, over a lifetime, alternated and was associated (sometimes at the very same time) with love for a woman". The pattern that same-sex love affairs followed, however, was not the same in every city-state. Some Roman and later writers, taking the Athenian pattern as their example, have tended to assume either that Alexander and Hephaestion had a sexual relationship which belonged to their adolescence, after which they left it behind, or that one of them was older, the lover (erastes) and the other was the beloved (eromenos) despite there being scarcely any direct evidence that Alexander and Hephaestion had a sexual relationship at all.|$|E

40|$|Message {{authentication}} codes usually {{require the}} underlining universal hash functions {{to have a}} long output so that the probability of successfully forging messages is low enough for cryptographic purposes. To take advantage of fast operation on word-size parameters in modern processors, long-output universal hashing schemes can be securely constructed by concatenating several different instances of a short-output primitive. In this paper, we describe a new method for short-output universal hash function termed digest() suitable for very fast software implementation and applicable to secure message authentication. The method possesses a higher level of security relative to other well-studied and computationally efficient short-output universal hashing schemes. Suppose that the universal hash output is fixed at one word of b bits, then the collision probability of ours is 2 1 -b compared to 6 × 2 -b of MMH, whereas 2 -b/ 2 of NH within UMAC is far away from optimality.

40|$|How {{individuals}} {{respond to}} adversity is {{one component of}} mental toughness and athletes may manage the adversity of <b>a</b> defeat in <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>ways.</b> In this article we focus on four types of cognition (appraisal, attribution, counterfactual thinking, and rumination) that athletes may exhibit {{in the immediate aftermath}} of a competitive defeat. In particular we define each of these terms and present a "caricature "of each of the respective literatures, focussing on the prevailing trends and substantive findings. These caricatures assist in the identification of several areas in which literature on athletes' retrospective cognition about defeat may be advanced. We use combat sports as a vehicle to illustrate our propositions. Key PointsPlease provide 3 - 5 bullet points of the paper. Little is known about how athletes psychologically manage adversity, a key component of mental toughness. There is a great deal of conceptual overlap between four types of retrospective cognition (appraisal, attribution, rumination and counterfactual thinking) athletes may exhibit after defeat. Rather than continue of examine these retrospective cognitions in isolation, there appears to be value in consideration of these constructs collectively to enhance theoretical parsimony...|$|R
40|$|Natively {{unstructured}} or disordered protein regions {{may increase}} the functional complexity of an organism; they are particularly abundant in eukaryotes and often evade structure determination. Many computational methods predict unstructured regions by training on outliers in otherwise well-ordered structures. Here, we introduce an approach that uses a neural network in <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> and novel <b>way.</b> We hypothesize that very long contiguous segments with nonregular secondary structure (NORS regions) differ significantly from regular, well-structured loops, and that a method detecting such features could predict natively unstructured regions. Training our new method, NORSnet, on predicted information rather than on experimental data yielded three major advantages: it removed the overlap between testing and training, it systematically covered entire proteomes, and it explicitly focused on one particular aspect of unstructured regions with a simple structural interpretation, namely that they are loops. Our hypothesis was correct: well-structured and unstructured loops differ so substantially that NORSnet succeeded in their distinction. Benchmarks on previously used and new experimental data of unstructured regions revealed that NORSnet performed very well. Although {{it was not the}} best single prediction method, NORSnet was sufficiently accurate to flag unstructured regions in proteins that were previously not annotated. In one application, NORSnet revealed previously undetected unstructured regions in putative targets for structural genomics and may thereby contribute to increasing structural coverage of large eukaryotic families.

The SFCS sought to improve early childhood outcomes, in keeping with the National Agenda for Early Childhood’s five evidence-based priority areas: healthy young families; supporting families and parents; early learning and care; child-friendly communities; and family and children’s services working effectively as a system (Social Policy Research Centre, 2005). The CfC initiative provided large-scale funding for socioeconomically-disadvantaged communities across Australia. Within each site, the funding was given to a Facilitating Partner organisation who was required to work in partnership with other local organisations, including an independent Local Evaluator, in order to plan, develop, implement and evaluate locally-relevant strategies to improve outcomes for children aged 0 - 5 years, their families and those working with them.
