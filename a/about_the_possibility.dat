40|$|This paper {{argues that}} Epicene, Jonson's first public play after being made {{official}} court masque writer, is unusually optimistic <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> of drama. <b>The</b> play explores <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> {{of creating an}} authentic personality through performance, an idea that Jonson is often hostile towards. However, Jonson's flirtation with this pro-theater perspective was short lived. For complex reasons, Lady Arbella's complaint <b>about</b> <b>the</b> play led Jonson to once again grow cynical <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> of <b>the</b> public stage. These vacillating perspectives, I argue, can be traced within the two different prologues, which offer two very different perspectives on playing, play going and the theater...|$|R

5|$|Eaton {{took his}} revenge on Calhoun. In 1830, reports had emerged {{accurately}} stating that Calhoun, while Secretary of War, had favored censuring Jackson for his 1818 invasion of Florida.
