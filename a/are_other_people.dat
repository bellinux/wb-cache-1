The people called them 'Ajjhayaka' which meant 'They who don't meditate'. At first the Ajjhayaka were viewed lower than Jhayaka but in the Buddha's time, the Ajjhayaka had been viewed higher in status than the Jhayakas.|$|E
500|$|He was not {{a typical}} movie actor, with a pudgy build and lacking matinée idol looks, but Hoffman claimed that he was {{grateful}} for his appearance as it made him believable {{in a wide range}} of roles. Joel Schumacher once said of him in 2000, [...] "The bad news is that Philip won't be a $25-million star. The good news is that he'll work for the rest of his life". The Aiken Standard of South Carolina referred to him as an [...] "anti-star", whose real identity remained [...] "amorphous and unmoored". Hoffman was acutely aware that he was often too unorthodox for the Academy voters. He remarked, [...] "I'm sure that people in the big corporations that run Hollywood don't know quite what to do with someone like me, but that's OK. I think there <b>are</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> who are interested in what I do." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{first time}} she was asked about her mother's {{handling}} of the Lewinsky scandal at a campaign stop Clinton responded, [...] "I {{do not think that}} is any of your business."

But I think there <b>are</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> [...] going to vote on things like healthcare and economics." ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{the time}} we were all trying to find out who the hell we were as individuals, what we wanted {{specifically}} on our own terms, who we wanted to be, what our potentials were, what our differences were, what made us unique… And I think that's why the XXX-rated films were important, because it was like, Oh, my God, there <b>are</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> who like the same things as me, like leather, or being blown on a pool table. [...] It was a start—literally stripping ourselves naked and trying to begin from there.Second, he [...] "wasn't comfortable in his own skin" [...] and wanted some adventure in his life.|$|E
2500|$|Darley and Latané (1968) {{conducted}} research on diffusion of responsibility. The {{findings suggest that}} in the case of an emergency, when people believe that there <b>are</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> around, they are less likely or slower to help a victim because they believe someone else will take responsibility. People may also fail to take responsibility for a situation depending on the context. They may assume that other bystanders are more qualified to help, such as doctors or police officers, and that their intervention would be unneeded. They may also be afraid of being superseded by a superior helper, offering unwanted assistance, or facing the legal consequences of offering inferior and possibly dangerous assistance. For this reason, some legislations, such as [...] "Good Samaritan Laws" [...] limit liability for those attempting to provide medical services and non-medical services in an emergency.|$|E

6000|$|... "Hush! not so loud. There <b>are</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> lodging in the house. Never {{mind about}} {{telling me what}} you heard; it only irritates you to no purpose. I can guess that they had discovered--" ...|$|E

6000|$|To Mrs. Penniman {{it seemed}} monstrous {{that a man}} should play such tricks with <b>other</b> <b>people's</b> money; for after his death, of course, as she said, it <b>was</b> <b>other</b> <b>people's.</b> [...] "Of course, you will dispute the will," [...] she remarked, fatuously, to Catherine.|$|R

6000|$|... "I am afraid," [...] he {{answered}} smiling, [...] "that there <b>are</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> {{who would have}} something to say about that. Your stepmother is already anxious. I have promised that you shall be back at the Hall by ten o'clock." ...|$|E

60|$|But the miscreant {{was evidently}} on the watch, Briot still lingered {{on the top}} of the stairs, there <b>were</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> {{sleeping}} in the house, and St. Genis suddenly realised that his purpose would not be quite so easy of execution as he had hot-headedly supposed.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think it}} is a shame," [...] said Miriam, [...] "that you should be driving to town alone, when there <b>are</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> who wish so much to go, and you have no use at all for that empty seat." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "There <b>are</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> in {{the world}} besides the Colonel," [...] Ermine began to say, though she hardly felt as if there were, and at any rate a sense of rescue crossed her.

6000|$|Newman gave a short laugh, {{but the old}} {{man seemed}} for the moment not to {{perceive}} it; he was gazing away, absently, at some metaphysical image of his implacability.
