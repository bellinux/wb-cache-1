40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a hybrid AC/DC micro grid which will reduces {{the process of}} several reverse conversions in an individual <b>AC</b> and <b>DC</b> grid. The renewable sources such as wind generators, photovoltaic panels and fuel cell are connected to a hybrid grid. AC sources and loads are linked with <b>AC</b> grid and <b>DC</b> sources and loads are linked with DC grid. The proposed hybrid grid operates in a grid-tied or autonomous mode. Both <b>AC</b> and <b>DC</b> networks are connected by a multi- bidirectional converter. This multi-bidirectional converter operates in parallel with <b>AC</b> and <b>DC</b> grid. Hence, demand over an individual grid can be coordinately controlled by multi-bidirectional converter. The co-ordination control algorithm at the bidirectional converter is proposed. Co-ordination control provides uninterrupted and smooth power transfer between <b>AC</b> and <b>DC</b> link. A hybrid grid has modeled and simulated using the Simulink in the MATLAB. The simulation {{results show that the}} system can provides uninterrupted power, smooth power transfer between <b>AC</b> and <b>DC</b> link and also manage the demand...|$|R

The control schemes for <b>AC</b> sub-microgrid and <b>DC</b> sub-microgrid are investigated {{according to the}} power sharing requirement and operational reliability. In addition, the key control schemes of interlinking converter with DC-link capacitor or energy storage, which will devote to the proper power sharing between <b>AC</b> and <b>DC</b> sub-microgrids to maintain <b>AC</b> and <b>DC</b> side voltage stable, is reviewed. Combining the specific control methods developed for <b>AC</b> and <b>DC</b> sub-microgrids with interlinking converter, the whole hybrid AC/DC microgrid can manage the power flow transferred between sub-microgrids for improving on the operational quality and efficiency.|$|R

ELBY Designs modules are also some what unique in the EuroRack market in being able to offer colour-coded jacks to identify the jacks function and this coding has been expanded from the basic 3-colour system (black, blue and red) defined by Serge to an extensive 9-colour system that distinguishes between inputs and outputs within each of the 3 function categories (<b>AC,</b> <b>DC</b> and Logic) with a further 3 colours identifying 'special variants' within each category.

One of these two vehicles was included in the formation depending upon where the unit was operating (on 25 kV overhead lines or third rail). To facilitate third rail running, shoegear was fitted to each driving car. The unit was known as the 'Hitachi Verification Train' or 'V Train' and was used by Hitachi to test and prove its traction equipment in the UK. The subsequent order for the Class 395 Javelin trains which now run on the High Speed 1 line benefitted from this exercise. The V train was scrapped at MoD Pig's Bay in Shoeburyness in 2007.Details and more pictures of the V train on <b>AC,</b> <b>DC</b> and the High Speed 1 lines can be found at Train Testing - Hitachi's V train.|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} new power system transmission concept based on frequency selectivity named Multi-Frequency Power System (MFPS). This system allows for selective power transmission among terminals in an interconnected system, and is enabled by power electronic technology. The dissertation {{starts with a}} presentation {{of some of the}} challenges faced by modern power systems, and includes a description of various power system technologies developed in an attempt to solve them. Then, our proposed solution is presented as an alternative to electric power transmission, and the fundamental concepts are explained. A version of the MFPS is developed, which has relevance to the problem of renewable sources integration. This <b>AC</b> <b>DC</b> Power System is further explored, and the topology of the system and the converters is presented, as well as the control techniques used in its operation. The dissertation also presents a performance study of the <b>AC</b> <b>DC</b> system, which was done in Simulink, and it demonstrates the robustness of the system under various dynamic and fault conditions. Finally, a summary of the work is given in the last section of the dissertation. The contributions of our research to the state of technology are discussed. These contributions include: the demonstration of power selectivity based on frequency identification, the development of a novel transmission system and a <b>AC</b> <b>DC</b> integrated implementation of it, {{and the development of a}} control and converter that enables selective power transmission.
