50|$|His {{career began}} Mittasch first in 1903 in {{mountain}} Stol with {{the manufacture of}} lead and zinc manufacture. After a short time he received there already thanks to his Kenntnisreichheit a leading function in the metal metallurgical engineering. However, after only one year he changed on recommendation of his supervisor {{at that time to}} the BASF where he took up his activity as an assistant from Carl Bosch. Besides, he took part in the attempts with which nitrogen about Metallnitride as well as Metallcyanide should be fixed. In 1909 Mittasch began production on the base from Eisenoxid in whose result approx. 20,000 attempts were carried out for the optimisation with the systematic search for a catalyst to the ammonia. The found catalyst (iron (II/III) oxide Fe3O4, K2O, CaO, Al2O3 and SiO2) allowed the large-scale technical <b>ammoniated</b> synthesis and is nearly unchanged till this day in use. By his great success Mittasch became 1918 research leaders of the then new-founded <b>ammoniated</b> laboratory of the BASF. Not only this start of the efficient catalyst to <b>ammoniated</b> production decreases to Mittasch but also the catalytic <b>ammoniated</b> oxidation to the nitric acid production, the high-pressure methanol synthesis (together with Matthias Pier in 1923) with mixing oxide catalysts (Zn(II) oxide and Chromium(III) oxide), as well as the Hochdruckcarbonylprozesse to the production of the purest metals such as nickel. The results of his works are held on in 85 patents which he announced mostly with his employees. For his knowledge and his engagement received numerous honours for his works, including the honorary doctorate of the universities TH Munich and LwH Berlin, as well as the appointment the professor by the government of Baden-Wurttemberg. Alwin Mittasch awards to honour the DECHEMA regularly the Alwin Mittasch price (early Alwin Mittasch medallion) for prominent achievements {{in the area of the}} catalysis research.|$|E

Next, DHQ synthase catalyzes a ring closure to give 4-amino3-dehydroquinate (aminoDHQ), which is then undergoes a double oxidation via aminoDHQ dehydratase to give 4-amino-dehydroshikimate (aminoDHS). The key intermediate, 3-amino-5-hydroxybenzoic acid (AHBA), is made via aromatization by AHBA synthase.|$|E

Each period consisted of 10 days adaptation, followed by five days data collection. The four diets were untreated maize stovers {Diet A), untreated maize stovers with MUB {Diet B), <b>ammoniated</b> maize stovers {Diet 'C) and <b>ammoniated</b> maize stovers with MUB {Diet D). Daily consumption of maize stovers and total feed by the calves were higher {P< 0. 01) on the diets containing <b>ammoniated</b> maize stovers than those containing untreated maize stovers.

Completely randomized design was used as the experimental design and differences among treatment means were examined using Duncan multiple range test. Variables measured were Ammonia (NH 3) and Volatile Fatty Acid (VFA) concentrations, as fermentability indicators, as well as degradability indicators including degradability of Dry Matter (DM), Organic Matter (OM), Neutral Detergent Fibre (NDF), Acid Detergent Fibre (ADF) and cellulose. The results indicated that fermentability and degradability of diets consisting <b>ammoniated</b> RS with Sulfur supplementation were significantly higher than the control diet (p< 0. 05).
