At 6:25 pm, the pump, which {{was turned off}} at the time, was turned back on. The pump surged, forcing a stronger than usual concentration of liquid bleach and hydrochloric acid into the water. Twenty-four people, including park staff and medical personnel, complained of troubled breathing and nausea. They were given oxygen at the park before being transported to Jasper Memorial Hospital for treatment. All were treated and released that evening. It was later determined that an interlock system designed to prevent chemical feeders from pumping chemicals into the water when the pump was turned off had malfunctioned.|$|E

Oil filters {{are used in}} {{many different types of}} hydraulic machinery. A chief use of the oil filter is in internal-combustion engines in on- and off-road motor vehicles, light aircraft, and various naval vessels.

40|$|This {{work has}} been {{undertaken}} to utilize the used sulphide-lime unhairing liquor {{in order to reduce}} these caustic chemicals in the effluent, save the fresh water and minimize the cost of the liming processes. The chemical analyses of the used liquor indicated that a considerable amount of sulphide of 2100 mg/l was present. And as the lime has a limited solublitiy of 0. 125 %, undissolved lime always remains in solution; this undissolved lime will dissolve when its equilibrium solubility is disturbed by recycling. It has been observed that the unhairing power of the old lime liquor was more effective than the fresh liquor; {{this is due to the}} fact that the disulphide link of the hair is broken and dissolved during the liming process and consequently the sulphide content will build-up through recycling. Wet salted sheepskins were processed with the normal recipe and the once-used lime solution was analyzed for lime and sulphide content, its composition was leveled by a make-up fresh lime-sulphide liquor and recycled. The same was repeated for seven cycles, each time the recycling flow rate was leveled with a fresh make-up. The average savings were 65 % sodium sulphide, 33 % lime and 90 % water. The limed-unhaired pelts from each cycle were further processed through tannage, retannage, drying, and finishing. The physical and chemical properties were satisfactory. The leather produced is normal, soft, of good tensile strength, full and of good quality. This process is recommended to be applyed in all tanneries. Its application is simple. It requires a collection pit, <b>a</b> <b>filter,</b> <b>a</b> <b>pump</b> and a pipe line to and from the drums...|$|R
40|$|The {{personal}} dust monitor (PDM) is {{a sampling}} device developed for measuring the personal exposure to coal mine dust of mine workers. The device is based on proprietary technology known as the tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) originally developed as a fixed- site environmental particulate mass monitor by Rupprecht and Patashnick Co., Inc., Albany, NY. Currently, the monitoring of exposure to coal mine dust relies on periodic samples taken by traditional coal mine dust sampling units that use <b>a</b> cyclone, <b>filter,</b> <b>pump,</b> and laboratory measurement of the filter mass. Better measurement of mine dust levels has been the goal of industry and labor for nearly two decades. PDM technology offers accurate, end-of-shift and near real time assessment of worker dust exposure. Laboratory and underground tests compared measurements taken by a prototype PDM- 2 (a two-piece TEOM) to the average of multiple personal dust samplers monitoring the same space. In the range of mass loadings P between 0. 5 and 4. 0 mg/m the PDM met a 25 % accuracy criterion 95 % of the time with 95 % confidence. However, some questions still exist about potential bias between types of coal.

40|$|Rock {{grouting}} is {{a commonly}} used process for sealing rocks in tunnels to reduce water ingress. In {{order to achieve}} sufficient sealing level the grout must effectively penetrate into rock fractures while the limiting factor is filtration of cement based grout. Many devices and measuring methods {{have been developed to}} study filtration and to measure the penetrability. The <b>filter</b> <b>pump</b> and the penetrability meter are two of the most commonly used instruments for measuring filtration tendency in the field and in the lab, while short slot is used mainly in the lab. The results obtained from these devices have relatively different estimations of the penetrability partly due to the weaknesses in measuring methods and test procedures. Furthermore, there are no clear criteria to find out which of the results are closer to the reality or how much the results differ among these instruments. The aim of this study is comparing, and evaluating the results of these devices in relatively similar conditions while using more accurate methods of weight-time and pressure-time compared to the less reliable total volume method. The <b>filter</b> <b>pump</b> and the penetrability meter were modified In order to fulfill the requirement of testing in similar conditions and to improve their accuracy and versatility. The results show that increasing the pressure improves the penetrability significantly. The modification of the <b>filter</b> <b>pump</b> results in reducing many uncertainties related to the testing procedure. Probably the modified <b>filter</b> <b>pump</b> has higher accuracy in measuring the penetrability compared to regular <b>filter</b> <b>pump.</b> The short slot has the highest accuracy in estimating penetrability of cement based grout especially at higher pressures, furthermore, the short slot provides a more flexible way to measure penetrability with different pressures in the range of 1 - 15 bars...|$|R

40|$|The {{modelling}} of pump sumps for vortex {{formation is}} the focus of this paper. A physical hydraulic model of <b>a</b> large <b>filtered</b> water <b>pumping</b> station at Happy Valley reservoir in southern Adelaide was constructed and tested in 1988. The results and phases of the model test are described. The pumping station has three open sumps. The model scale was 1 : 10. 463. The objective of the model study was to identify and eliminate any vortex formation or excessive swirl in order to maximise the efficiency of pump operation. A parametric study of a number of flow modification elements was carried out. Examples of elements included back splitters, floor splitters, surface beams, screens and fillets. Modifications were also made to the approach chamber leading to the sumps. Eight phases of model testing were performed. The relative effectiveness of various flow modification elements for swirl angle reduction and vortex elimination is summarised. The outcome of the model study was a design that performed satisfactorily with no vortex formation and small swirl angles in each sump. In addition a considerable savings in capital cost was achieved by a significant shortening of the pumping station. A. R. Simpson and R. G. Harriso...|$|R

40|$|In drought-prone {{northern}} California, homeowners {{can collect}} rainwater to irrigate their waterintensive summer vegetable gardens. Rainwater harvesting requires a three-part system: {{a method of}} collection (commonly the roof), a form of storage (cistern) and a method of distribution (<b>a</b> <b>pump,</b> <b>filter</b> and soaker hose are proposed here). To optimize and properly size a rainwater harvesting system, homeowners should consider both their rainwater supply and their garden’s water demand.

The authors analyze the water use of a sample garden, which they adapt to both Berkeley and Sacramento. In both of these cities, one can collect more than enough rainwater to support a small vegetable garden: an individual homeowner’s water supply {{is more likely to be}} limited by storage capacity than rainfall. Ultimately, although rainwater harvesting can supply adequate quantities of water to irrigate vegetable gardens, the level of water treatment required to safely irrigate food crops adds dramatically to the cost of a system.

40|$|The {{coolant supply}} uses in typical {{applications}} of metal cutting manufacturing on average 50 % of the electrical energy. A main optimization option is the retrofit of demandbased control {{strategies in the}} supply system. The study {{of the state of}} the art shows that a high energy saving potential remains in central precoat filter systems for coolant cleaning. The achievable flow rate through the precoat filter with the <b>filter</b> <b>pump</b> is reduced in filter operation due to the rising filter resistance. The precoat filters in the filter system need to be regenerated as soon as the achievable flow rate through the <b>filters</b> falls below <b>a</b> certain level. So far the <b>filter</b> <b>pumps</b> are throttled and operated constantly with maximum speed since this allows triggering the regeneration based on the filter pressure. Thereby the filter systems are operated constantly on an excessive power level, independent on the coolant demand. Within this thesis, an automation procedure for an energy efficient operation of central precoat filter systems is presented. The flow rates through the filters are regulated demand-based with a follow-up control using variable speed pumps. Thereby the energy intake is adapted based on the current coolant demand. The filter pressure is no longer utilizable to trigger the filter regeneration due to the variation of the flow rate. Therefore the filter pressure which would arise in uncontrolled operation is reconstructed in controlled operation with measured variables using a model. The presented procedure was successfully implemented in an existing central precoat filter system. The energy saving potential using the existing pumps and throttle setting is 62 %. Simulation results using <b>filter</b> <b>pumps</b> which allow in addition a reduction of the throttle lead to the conclusion that the energy saving potential is 73 %...|$|R
25|$|Compared to filters {{that hang}} {{on the back of}} the aquarium, canister-style {{external}} <b>filters</b> offer <b>a</b> greater quantity of filter materials to be used along with a greater degree of flexibility with respect to filter material choice. Water enters the canister filled with the chosen <b>filter</b> material through <b>an</b> intake pipe at the bottom of the canister, passes through the material, and is fed back to the aquarium through the return pipe. Water is forced to circulate through the <b>filter</b> by <b>a</b> <b>pump</b> typically installed at the top of the canister. It is important to note that canister filters are sealed, fully flooded systems, meaning that the aquarium, intake pipe, filter interior and the return pipe form a continuous body of water. In this configuration both the intake and return path form two siphons, which precisely counterbalance each other. Under these circumstances, the <b>filter</b> <b>pump</b> does not have to spend any effort to lift the water back to the aquarium, regardless of how high the latter is installed above the canister. The pump should only be powerful enough to push the water through the filtering material as well as overcome the drag in the intake and return pipes. This makes canister <b>filter</b> <b>pumps</b> virtually insensitive to the height difference between the aquarium and the filter (although exceeding the manufacturer-specified height limit can lead to leaks).|$|R

40|$|In a basic, {{ram-type}} EDM system (figure 1 - 1 O), the {{ram head}} is driven {{up and down}} with extreme accuracy by a servodriven system. The servo system is controlled by a microprocessor connected to the power supply. The power supply is solid-state and is also microprocessor controlled. One lead from the power supply is connected to the workpiece, which is immersed in a tank of dielectric oil. The dielectric tank is connected to a dielectric pump, an oil reservoir, and <b>a</b> <b>filter</b> system. The <b>pump</b> provides pressure for flushing the work area and moving the oil while the filter system removes and traps debris in the oil. The oil reservoir stores surplus oil and provides a container for draining the oil between operations. The other lead from the power supply is connected to the electrode. The power supply provides a pulsed DC output to the electrode/workpiece system. On-times and off-times are set manually, along with voltage and current values. When the EDM machine is turned on, the servo microprocessor, sensing that the gap is too wide for cutting to take place, signals the servo mechanism to lower the ram head. When the first spark jumps the gap, downward travel of the ram head stops. With the gap setting held constant, the process gradually erodes the surface. When enough metal has been removed to change the gap distance, the microprocessor senses this and signals the servo mechanism to advance the ram head sufficiently to maintain the proper gap width, and the process continues...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Dust is {{generally}} sampled on <b>a</b> <b>filter</b> using air <b>pumps,</b> but passive sampling {{could be a}} cost-effective alternative. One promising passive sampler is the University of North Carolina passive aerosol sampler (UNC sampler). The {{aim of this study}} is to characterize and compare the UNC sampler’s performance with PM 10 and PM 2. 5 impactors in a working environment. Methods: Area sampling was carried out at different mining locations using UNC samplers in parallel with PM 2. 5 and PM 10 impactors. Two different collection surfaces, polycarbonate (PC) and carbon tabs (CT), were employed for the UNC sampling. Sampling was carried out for 4 – 25 hours. Results: The UNC samplers underestimated the concentrations compared to PM 10 and PM 2. 5 impactor data. At the location with the highest aerosol concentration, the time-averaged mean of PC showed 24 % and CT 35 % of the impactor result for PM 2. 5. For PM 10, it was 39 % with PC and 58 % with CT. Sample blank values differed between PC and CT. For PM 2. 5, PC blank values were ~ 7 times higher than those of CT, but only 1. 8 times higher for PM 10. The blank variations were larger for PC than for CT. Conclusions: Particle mass concentrations appear to be underestimated by the UNC sampler compared to impactors, more so for PM 2. 5 than for PM 10. CT may be preferred as a collection surface because the blank values were lower and less variable than for PC. Future validations in the working environment should include respirable dust sampling...|$|R
