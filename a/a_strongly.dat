40|$|The {{problem of}} whether a given {{connected}} Tychonoff space admits a strictly finer connected Tychonoff topology is considered. We show that every Tychonoff space X satisfying ω (X) ≤ c and c (X) ≤ N 0 admits <b>a</b> finer <b>strongly</b> σ-discrete connected Tychonoff topology of weight 2 c. We also prove that every connected Tychonoff space is an open continuous image of <b>a</b> connected <b>strongly</b> σ-discrete submetrizable Tychonoff space.

5|$|An st-{{planar graph}} is a {{connected}} planar graph {{together with a}} bipolar orientation of that graph, an orientation that makes it acyclic with a single source and a single sink, {{both of which are}} required {{to be on the same}} face as each other. Such a graph may be made into <b>a</b> <b>strongly</b> connected graph by adding one more edge, from the sink back to the source, through the outer face.

5|$|Belgravia is a {{district}} predominantly composed of early 19th-century residential buildings, {{many of which}} now serve diplomatic uses.

Ostrom suggested that this difference in {{the size and shape}} of the sickle claws could be due to individual, sexual, or age-related variation, but admitted he could not be sure.|$|E
5|$|Disruptive {{coloration}} (also {{known as}} disruptive camouflage or disruptive patterning) {{is a form}} of camouflage that works by breaking up the outlines of an animal, soldier or military vehicle with <b>a</b> <b>strongly</b> contrasting pattern. It is often combined with other methods of crypsis including background colour matching and countershading. It appears paradoxical as a way of not being seen, since disruption of outlines depends on high contrast, so the patches of colour are themselves conspicuous.|$|E
