5|$|After I {{released}} my solo record I {{felt really}} disappointed, I {{believed in the}} record I made but if you don't have the back-up of your record company investing and marketing it. It's a really tough job and because I wrote the whole thing I really believed in this record, as did Nellee Hooper, I was jaded <b>and</b> <b>disappointed.</b>|$|E
5|$|Executive {{producer}} Susan Bedsow Horgan, {{when speaking}} of Todd's psychological motivations, reported that Peter Manning degraded him verbally and abused his adoptive mother, whom Todd loved but who abandoned <b>and</b> <b>disappointed</b> him, leaving Todd with wounds that influenced his later behavior. Author Gerry Waggett stated that Peter Manning had physically abused Todd his entire life.|$|E
5|$|Despite Germany's {{comparatively}} {{low expectations}} when for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, the team {{advanced to the}} finals; Kahn conceded only three goals {{in the course of}} the competition, two of which were in the Final. Playing the final match with torn ligaments in his right ring finger, Kahn conceded the first goal by fumbling a rebounded shot from Rivaldo to the feet of striker Ronaldo in the 67th minute. Once the game was over with Brazil as the new champion, he stood alone <b>and</b> <b>disappointed</b> in his goal; nevertheless he refused to blame his injury for his mistake.|$|E

5|$|Despite The Big Room being {{critically}} acclaimed, {{it was not}} as commercially {{successful as}} their first album, which Verdens Gang attributed to a lacklustre promotion campaign by Atlantic Records. Half way through their tour with Jewel in mid July, M2M were removed as the opening act by Atlantic who cited disappointing sales of The Big Room, which at that time had sold around 100,000 units in America. Shocked <b>and</b> <b>disappointed</b> by the decision, M2M returned to Norway, and ceased performing together. Raven was immediately offered a solo record contract from Atlantic, though she later withdrew from the offer.|$|E
5|$|Despite the band's intent, {{a future}} album {{from the group}} was uncertain. On June 12, 2008, Atlantic Records {{filed a lawsuit against}} Weiland and Eric Kretz, {{claiming}} the two had threatened to terminate their contract unless changes were made. Stone Temple Pilots had delivered six albums (five studio records and the compilation, Thank You) and Atlantic wanted a seventh album with an option for two more. In a statement made by email, the band said they were surprised <b>and</b> <b>disappointed</b> by the lawsuit.|$|E
5|$|In June 2012 Chapman was not {{included}} in the final 18–player Great Britain squad for the 2012 London Olympics. She had made the 35–player longlist but was hurt <b>and</b> <b>disappointed</b> to be overlooked for the event in her home city. Chapman felt that her decision to withdraw from the England squad had caused Hope Powell – who managed Great Britain as well as England – to leave her out.|$|E

5|$|The Robins {{released}} Bancroft {{after the}} 1929 season, and {{he returned to}} the Giants as assistant manager and coach, serving under McGraw. He ended his MLB playing career in 1930. He remained as a coach, filling in for McGraw when he was too ill to manage. During the 1930 offseason, he led a team of MLB players on an exhibition trip to Cuba. When McGraw retired in 1932, the Giants appointed Bill Terry as player-manager. Surprised <b>and</b> <b>disappointed</b> that Terry was chosen over him, Bancroft left the Giants.|$|E
5|$|Also in the off-season, Gillis fired Luongo's goaltending coach Ian Clark {{and hired}} Roland Melanson in his place. Luongo {{had been a}} {{personal}} friend of Clark's and publicly stated being surprised <b>and</b> <b>disappointed</b> with the switch. The decision to hire Melanson was largely precipitated on his willingness to work with Luongo on a full-time basis – something Clark was unable to do. Despite the coaching change at the club level, Luongo retained Clark as his personal coach for his summer training. He began working with Melanson {{leading up to the}} 2010–11 season and employed several changes in his playing style, which included playing deeper into his crease instead of challenging shooters.|$|E
5|$|Although Khan {{has bought}} Jasmine a house, she rejects his advances, {{saying that she}} has never seen him as being more than a friend. Angry <b>and</b> <b>disappointed,</b> Khan slaps her and tells her to leave. He angrily destroys {{the set of the}} film she is cast in, leaving with her a twenty-four-hour {{deadline}} to accept his proposal. Jasmine returns home to see that Khan has filled her house with expensive presents. Her mother is taken aback when Jasmine explains that Khan is a gangster with whom she'd prefer not to associate. Her family questions the sense in rejecting a man as powerful and dangerous as Khan.|$|E

5|$|Asche {{began the}} 2015 season among the team's hottest hitters, and a {{mainstay}} {{in the lineup}} as the team's starting third baseman. However, in late April, he began working on skills as an outfielder, ostensibly {{in preparation for the}} arrival of minor league prospect Maikel Franco, regarded as a stronger defensive third baseman. In fact, the Phillies optioned Asche back to Triple-A on May 12 to accelerate his development as a left fielder, as Franco was hitting very well in the minor leagues, and could be ready for a promotion. Although surprised <b>and</b> <b>disappointed</b> by the move, Asche sought to trust the organization and play wherever it needed him. Ultimately, Asche struggled to find playing time during the remainder of the season, although MLB.com writer Todd Zolecki said that Asche would be given an opportunity in 2016 as the Phillies like his makeup, but the burden will be on him to produce results to justify the playing time, given the amelioration of other options at his positions.|$|E
5|$|Geen {{was then}} {{selected}} and played three times for Wales in the 1912–1913 season. He earned his first cap against the same touring South Africans on 14 December. His next international appearance, under the captaincy of his Newport teammate Tommy Vile, was on 18 January 1913 against England. Wales were beaten in Cardiff 0–12. After the game, <b>and</b> <b>disappointed</b> by {{the performance of}} most of the team, the selectors made nine changes for the upcoming match against Scotland. Only two backs were to be retained, Bobby Williams, the fullback, and Billy Geen, deemed the outstanding threequarter against England, moving from wing to centre. However, on the Wednesday preceding the encounter in Edinburgh, Geen withdrew after a training session due to an ongoing shoulder injury, and his place on the team was taken by Willie Watts.|$|E
5|$|Over the {{following}} months many English soldiers, who were unpaid and decimated by disease <b>and</b> <b>disappointed</b> by {{the progress of}} the war, amongst them Captain Roger Williams, deserted the States-General army and went to serve in Francis, Duke of Anjou's French army. By the Treaty of Plessis-les-Tours, Francis had been recognized by the States-General as the sovereign of the Netherlands instead of Philip II of Spain. Even Norreys, in the end, left the States' service and put himself under Anjou's command. Thus, in command of the English infantry, he found himself at the Battle of Steenbergen in 1583, when he covered the rearguard of the defeated French army.|$|E

5|$|Barrowclough {{rejoined the}} 6th Infantry Brigade in October 1940 <b>and,</b> <b>disappointed</b> with its quality, put {{considerable}} emphasis on training. This {{meant that it}} generally performed well during the campaign in Greece in April 1941. After {{the conclusion of the}} fighting in Greece, he refused to join in the criticism directed by some senior officers of the 2nd New Zealand Division at Freyberg's leadership during the battle. He later fought in Operation Crusader, the campaign to lift the Siege of Tobruk. At one point in the battle, his brigade captured elements of the headquarters of the Afrika Korps. However, he was impetuous in his efforts to capture Point 175, a strategically important hill to the south of Tobruk, and this led to heavy losses in one of the battalions of his brigade. Although Point 175 was seized, Barrowclough's brigade was only able to hold it for a few days before being forced to withdraw due to German attacks. He received a Bar to his DSO for his leadership during the Crusader offensive, having already been awarded the Greek War Cross and a mention in despatches for his work in Greece.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{reported}} that players rarely {{need to use}} Undead Nightmare new weapons. Whitehead (Eurogamer) said that Marston's firearms are mostly indistinguishable apart from the blunderbuss, which is only useful when the player is overrun by zombies. GameSpot added that the game's combat is repetitive and less fun in the expansion, as zombies barely pose a threat. The zombies, without guns, cover, horses, lack the complexities of cowboys and, apart {{from some of the}} special zombie types, are only a threat at short distances. The reviewer found little variation between weapons when firing at close range, which is more effective than aiming at a distance. The fun of the new guns quickly faded for the critic, who found little incentive to use traditional gunfight strategies. Whitehead (Eurogamer) too noted that the base game relied on its use of cover during gunfights, which the expansion jettisons altogether. Thus the player is forced into the technique of backtracking and turning to use the time-slowing Dead Eye mode to clear zombies with headshots. The reviewer also found the controls clumsy and often tripped on piles of zombie bodies or became stuck in doorways. While the idea of zombie animals scared Whitehead, he was both relieved <b>and</b> <b>disappointed</b> to find that bears and cougars, like the humans, died with a single bullet.|$|E
5|$|Ewbank {{maintained}} through {{training camp}} that second-year Mike Taliaferro was the number-one quarterback <b>and</b> <b>disappointed</b> a sellout crowd at Houston's Rice Stadium by keeping Namath {{on the bench}} at the Jets' season opener. Ewbank felt that Namath might not be ready for several more weeks, but Werblin intervened. Namath saw his first regular season action in the AFL the next week against the Kansas City Chiefs (the former Dallas Texans), and he was starting quarterback the following week against the Buffalo Bills. Namath's performance was inconsistent as he gained pro experience, but he was named AFL Rookie of the Year. The Jets finished the season 5–8–1 again. Beginning in 1966, the Jets began to improve on the field behind Namath, who led them to a 6–6–2 record. That season, the NFL and AFL announced a merger, which would be effective in 1970. A championship game (it {{came to be known}} as the Super Bowl), played between the two league champions, would follow each season until the merger took place.|$|E

5|$|For George III, Pitt's {{appointment}} {{was a great}} victory. It proved {{that he was able}} to appoint Prime Ministers on the basis of his own interpretation of the public mood without having to follow the choice of the current majority in the House of Commons. Throughout Pitt's ministry, George supported many of Pitt's political aims and created new peers at an unprecedented rate to increase the number of Pitt's supporters in the House of Lords. During and after Pitt's ministry, George III was extremely popular in Britain. The British people admired him for his piety, and for remaining faithful to his wife. He was fond of his children, and was devastated at the death of two of his sons in infancy in 1782 and 1783 respectively. Nevertheless, he set his children a strict regimen. They were expected to attend rigorous lessons from seven in the morning, and to lead lives of religious observance and virtue. When his children strayed from George's own principles of righteousness, as his sons did as young adults, he was dismayed <b>and</b> <b>disappointed.</b>|$|E
5|$|Louise {{returned}} to Britain, from Quebec, {{with her husband}} on 27 October 1883, and landed at Liverpool. Queen Victoria had prepared apartments at Kensington Palace, and the couple took up official residence there. Louise retained those apartments until her death there 56 years later. Lorne resumed his political career, campaigning unsuccessfully for the Hampstead seat in 1885. In 1896, he won the South Manchester seat, entering parliament as a Liberal. Louise, unlike Lorne and his father, was in favour of Irish Home Rule, <b>and</b> <b>disappointed</b> when he defected from Gladstonian Liberalism to the Liberal Unionists. Relations between Louise and Lorne were strained, and, despite the Queen's attempts to keep them under one roof, they often went their separate ways. Even when he accompanied Louise, he was not always received with favour at court, and the Prince of Wales did not take to him. Out of all the royal family, Lorne {{was the only one}} to be identified closely with a political party, having been a Gladstonian liberal in the House of Commons.|$|E
5|$|Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) {{decides to}} start {{painting}} her mural in the warehouse, {{but has a}} hard time getting started as she is afraid of it not being perfect. Meanwhile, bored with having to fill out customer complaint cards (which he finds redundant because the complaints are already in the computer), Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) uses them to build a card tower in the annex with other employees. The card tower takes on a deeper meaning for the employees when Pete points out that it is composed of failures made by every one of them (excepting only Pam), and thus proves that they should not be ashamed of their failures. They decide {{to try to make it}} go all the way to the ceiling, but end up one complaint card short. Not wanting to use a blank card as it would defy the point of the tower, Pam offers to complete the tower by getting her first customer complaint. She calls one of their smaller clients, delivers a yo mama joke, and hangs up. The client, whose mother was actually obese and is now deceased, drops Dunder Mifflin as their paper supplier, leaving them simultaneously excited over getting that last complaint <b>and</b> <b>disappointed</b> over losing a client. After celebrating the completion of the card tower, Pam finally starts painting the mural, saying artists should not care too much in what others think, further asserting this by telling off Hide (Hidetoshi Imura) when he insults her artwork.|$|E
