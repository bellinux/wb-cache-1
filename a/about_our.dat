5|$|Domain-general views {{have been}} criticized for not fully {{explaining}} how children manage to avoid mapping errors when there are numerous possible referents to which objects, actions, or events might point. For instance, if biases are not present from birth, why do infants assume that labels refer to whole objects, instead of salient parts of these objects? However, domain-general perspectives do not dismiss the notion of biases. Rather, they suggest biases develop through learning strategies instead of existing as built-in constraints. For instance, the whole object bias could be explained as a strategy that humans use to reason about the world; perhaps we are prone to thinking <b>about</b> <b>our</b> environment in terms of whole objects, and this strategy is not specific to the language domain. Additionally, children may be exposed to cues associated with categorization by shape early in the word learning process, which would draw their attention to shape when presented with novel objects and labels. Ordinary learning could, then, lead to a shape bias.|$|E
25|$|Pessimism bias is {{an effect}} {{in which people}} exaggerate the {{likelihood}} that negative things will happen to them. It contrasts with optimism bias. The difference {{is that we are}} in an improbable way worried <b>about</b> <b>our</b> society's future.|$|E
25|$|Semantic {{memory has}} had a {{comeback}} in interest in the past 15 years, {{due in part to}} the development of functional neuroimaging methods such as positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which have been used to address some of the central questions <b>about</b> <b>our</b> understanding of semantic memory.|$|E

25|$|The {{existence}} of the Lord's Taverners and the involvement of early members can be broadly summarised by the following:"We've all got professional and sporting interests in common. So why not start a club, based at the beloved old tavern here. We can talk <b>about</b> <b>our</b> work and watch the cricket. And {{we can try to}} put a few bob back into the game at the same time."Since its inception, the Lord's Taverners has developed into a membership charity. For the first fifteen years, the NPFA was the sole beneficiary of the Lord's Taverners, with the money all going to cricket projects, mostly for the installation of artificial pitches.|$|E

25|$|Another primary {{advantage}} to imagination is that, {{though it is}} contextualized by physical elements and time, it is not entirely subject to them, therefore enabling the kind of creativity they need to imagine possibilities not readily visible in their physical world and further weigh alternatives. Put otherwise, imagination provides “the means for navigating between our experiences in conversations and practices, and the theories we develop <b>about</b> <b>our</b> selves, our lives, and our world.” Through discourse, it also enables people to envision the experiences of others in their minds and by so doing invoke a deeper understanding and empathy toward others. Martin and Sugarman write {{that this kind of}} empathic envisioning is instrumental to therapeutically conceptualizing and understanding the clients with which therapists work.|$|E
