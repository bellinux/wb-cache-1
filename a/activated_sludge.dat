5|$|In 1992, {{the problem}} of ammonia levels in the final {{effluent}} was addressed by {{the construction of a}} system using anoxic zones and diffuse air <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> treatment. This dramatically reduced ammonia levels, and was the most significant factor in the re-establishment of fish stocks in the lower River Don. In 1990, the outdated filter presshouse and incineration plant were replaced by a new sludge-dewatering plant and a fluidized-bed incinerator. The new plant made the old sludge beds, situated to the east of the River Don and on the island formed by the Don and the Holmes Cut, redundant, and these have now become a nature reserve. Further improvements to the process were completed by 2005. These included an upgrade to the wet scrubbing system, in order to remove heavy metals and acid gases such as sulphur dioxide, hydrogen chloride and hydrogen fluoride from the flue gases produced by the incinerator, and the addition of a tertiary adsorption filter, which removes mercury and dioxins. The improvements were designed to ensure that the plant met the standards set out in the Waste Incineration Directive.|$|E
25|$|The {{amount of}} sewage sludge {{produced}} from the <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> process is directly proportional {{to the amount of}} wastewater treated. The total sludge production consists of the sum of primary sludge from the primary sedimentation tanks as well as waste <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> from the bioreactors. The <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> process produces about 70–100kg/ML of waste <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> (that is kg of dry solids produced per ML of wastewater treated; one mega litre (ML) is 103 m3). A value of 80kg/ML is regarded as being typical. In addition, about 110–170kg/ML of primary sludge is produced in the primary sedimentation tanks which most - but not all - of the <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> process configurations use.|$|E

25|$|An early feature was a laboratory, where {{trials of}} various types of filter were carried out, and {{incoming}} effluent was analysed. Attempts to improve the treatment process proved successful in 1914, when two chemists, Ardern and Lockett, discovered the <b>Activated</b> <b>Sludge</b> Process, which was soon in use worldwide. A second deep level sewer, started in 1911, eventually reached the works in 1928, and {{to cope with the}} increased flows, half of the sewage was fed into a new <b>Activated</b> <b>Sludge</b> plant. Three separate operating systems were installed, so that comparisons on their efficiency could be made. A second <b>Activated</b> <b>Sludge</b> plant was built between 1955 and 1966, and the control system on the first was upgraded between 1970 and 1973.|$|E
25|$|<b>Activated</b> <b>sludge</b> is {{a common}} suspended-growth method of {{secondary}} treatment. <b>Activated</b> <b>sludge</b> plants encompass a variety of mechanisms and processes using dissolved oxygen to promote growth of biological floc that substantially removes organic material. Biological floc is an ecosystem of living biota subsisting on nutrients from the inflowing primary clarifier effluent. These mostly carbonaceous dissolved solids undergo aeration to be broken down and either biologically oxidized to carbon dioxide or converted to additional biological floc of reproducing micro-organisms. Nitrogenous dissolved solids (amino acids, ammonia, etc.) are similarly converted to biological floc or oxidized by the floc to nitrites, nitrates, and, in some processes, to nitrogen gas through denitrification. While denitrification is encouraged in some treatment processes, denitrification often impairs the settling of the floc causing poor quality effluent in many suspended aeration plants. Overflow from the <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> mixing chamber is sent to a secondary clarifier where the suspended biological floc settles out while the treated water moves into tertiary treatment or disinfection. Settled floc is returned to the mixing basin to continue growing in primary effluent. Like most ecosystems, population changes among <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> biota can reduce treatment efficiency. Nocardia, a floating brown foam sometimes misidentified as sewage fungus, is {{the best known of}} many different fungi and protists that can overpopulate the floc and cause process upsets. Elevated concentrations of toxic wastes including pesticides, industrial metal plating waste, or extreme pH, can kill the biota of an <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> reactor ecosystem.|$|E
25|$|The {{combination}} of wastewater and biological mass is {{commonly known as}} mixed liquor. In all <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> plants, once the wastewater has received sufficient treatment, excess mixed liquor is discharged into settling tanks and the treated supernatant is run off to undergo further treatment before discharge. Part of the settled material, the sludge, is returned {{to the head of the}} aeration system to re-seed the new wastewater entering the tank. This fraction of the floc is called return <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> (R.A.S.).|$|E

25|$|In an aerated basin system, the aerators provide two functions: they {{transfer}} {{air into}} the basins required by the biological oxidation reactions, and they provide the mixing required for dispersing the air and for contacting the reactants (that is, oxygen, wastewater and microbes). Typically, the floating surface aerators are rated to deliver the amount of air equivalent to 1.8 to 2.7kg O2/kWh.

40|$|Bacteria {{are known}} to play {{important}} roles in biogeochemical cycles and biotechnology processes, but {{little is known about}} the influence of bacteriophage on these processes. A major impediment to the study of host-bacteriophage interactions is that the bacteria and their bacteriophage are often not available in a pure culture. In this study, we detected an unexpected decline in the phosphorus-removal performance of a granular laboratory-scale wastewater treatment reactor. Investigations by FISH, transmission electron microscopy and proteomics led us to hypothesize that a bacteriophage infection of the uncultured Candidatus 2 ̆ 7 Accumulibacter phosphatis 2 ̆ 7 was responsible for the decline in performance. Further experiments demonstrated that the addition of a putative bacteriophage-rich supernatant, obtained from the previous failed reactor to phosphorus-removal reactors, caused a decrease in the abundance of Accumulibacter in both granular and floccular <b>activated</b> <b>sludges.</b> This coincided with increases in bacteriophage-like particles and declining phosphorus-removal performance. The granular sludge did not recover after the attack, but the floccular sludge regained Accumulibacter numbers and phosphorus-removal performance.
