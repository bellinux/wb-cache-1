40|$|Purpose. The paper aims at {{estimation}} of resource of strength increase for railway wheel disk. Methodology. The material for research was carbon steel of railway wheel containing 0. 57 %C, 0. 65 %Si, 0. 45 %Mn, 0. 0029 %S, 0, 014 %P, 0, 11 %Cr. A railway wheel was heated to the temperatures above and {{was held at}} this temperature until the completion of аustenite homogenization processes and then the disk was cooled at a growing rate to a certain temperature. A temperature interval of completion of the speed-up wheel disk cooling was 200 - 450 C. Structure was studied {{with the use of}} research methods under electronic and light microscopes. After <b>accelerated</b> <b>cooling</b> the {{estimation of}} metal structure imperfection degree was carried out with the use of X-ray structural analysis method. The stress and yielding limit of carbon steel were determined at tension, at a speed of deformation. The microhardness of steel structural components was estimated using the microhardness tester of PMT- 3 type. Findings. The properties complex of railway wheel carbon steel depending on the temperature of the <b>accelerated</b> <b>cooling</b> termination is determined by the correlation of soften and work-hardening processes development. The effect of work-hardening is based on blocking of mobile dislocations due to a precipitation carbon atoms and dispersion work-hardening from the formed particles of carbidic phase. At the temperatures of the <b>accelerated</b> <b>cooling</b> termination of carbon steel higher than 300 - 350 C the decrease rate of strength properties is determined by the exceeding of total soften effect from disintegration of solid solution, acceleration of spheroidithation and coalescence of cementite particles above the dislocations blocking by the carbon atoms and dispersion work-hardening. Originality. Authors proved that the strength level of the railway wheel carbon steel from the temperature of <b>accelerated</b> <b>cooling</b> completion is determined by the influence ratio of the solid solution satiety degree and dispersion work-hardening from a carbidic phase. For the temperatures of <b>accelerated</b> <b>cooling</b> termination 200 - 300 C a decrease of solid solution satiety degree is a basic factor, which determines the level of the strength characteristic. Practical value. When making the whole-rolled railway wheel one can increase the strength limit of disk metal using the <b>accelerated</b> <b>cooling</b> to the middle interval of temperatures, which was successfully proven by authors...|$|E

The main microstructure of hot rolled steel plates changed from granular bainite to lath bainite (or bainitic ferrite) when the final <b>accelerated</b> <b>cooling</b> temperature decreased from about 530 to 430 °C, accompanied with a notable increase in yield strength {{at the expense of}} slightly decreasing toughness.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The <b>accelerated</b> <b>cooling</b> {{of steel}} plates is an already {{standard}} process {{that increases the}} competitiveness of this product and their users, as it allows {{the adoption of a}} leaner alloy design and the development of new mechanical property combinations with improved weldability. The maximum cooling rate achievable under industrial conditions depends on plate thickness, from 80 °C/s � 10 mm � to about 1 °C/s � 80 mm�, in order to assure minimum temperature gradients along plate thickness and greater uniformity of mechanical properties. The main process variants of this process apply cooling over different temperature ranges: interrupted <b>accelerated</b> <b>cooling,</b> between 800 and 500 °C, and direct quenching, between 900 and 200 °C. In the first case it is aimed at a microstructural grain refining effect; in the latter one a fully martensitic microstructure is desired. The advantages promoted by these new process routes are already benefiting the main fields of application of heavy steel plates, like shipbuilding, civil construction, linepipes, penstocks, and so on.
