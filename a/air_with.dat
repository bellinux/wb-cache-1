5|$|This {{equation}} basically {{describes the}} existence of the jet stream, a westerly current of <b>air</b> <b>with</b> maximum wind speeds close to the tropopause which is (even though other factors are also important) the result of the temperature contrast between equator and pole.|$|E
5|$|A similar {{play in the}} game's {{second half}} scored another {{touchdown}}. Quarterback Doc Kuhn dropped back for a more than 40-yard touchdown pass to Bomar. The pass went 28 yards in the <b>air,</b> <b>with</b> Bomar running {{the rest of the}} way. Georgia running back Dave Collings tackled him as he crossed the goal line (injuring himself), and Bomar also made an interception in the 12–0 Vanderbilt victory. The season's final game, against Vanderbilt's oldest rival Sewanee, had a trick play by the Commodores. A fake run ended with Kuhn tossing the ball to Bomar, who was left open behind the defense and easily ran it in; Vanderbilt won, 26–0.|$|E

5|$|At the lek, {{males have}} been {{observed}} to break up into pairs, performing “confrontation displays”. This consists of facing each other while bowing, jumping, and flapping their wings, sometimes even snapping their bills, {{and at the same}} time giving off various squawking and grunting calls. When the female approaches, it becomes even more intense. The display turns into a cacophony of bright color and a frenzied activity filling the <b>air</b> <b>with</b> very strange sounds.|$|E
5|$|Brolgas {{are well}} known for their ritualised, {{intricate}} mating dances. The performance begins with a bird picking up some grass and tossing it into the air before catching it in its bill. The bird then jumps a metre (yard) into the <b>air</b> <b>with</b> outstretched wings and continues by stretching its neck, bowing, strutting around, calling and bobbing its head up and down. Sometimes just one brolga dances for its mate; often they dance in pairs; and sometimes {{a whole group of}} about a dozen dance together, lining up roughly opposite each other before they start.|$|E
5|$|Californium {{can enter}} the body from ingesting {{contaminated}} food or drinks or by breathing <b>air</b> <b>with</b> suspended particles of the element. Once in the body, only 0.05% of the californium will reach the bloodstream. About 65% of that californium will be deposited in the skeleton, 25% in the liver, and the rest in other organs, or excreted, mainly in urine. Half of the californium deposited in the skeleton and liver are gone in 50 and 20 years, respectively. Californium in the skeleton adheres to bone surfaces before slowly migrating throughout the bone.|$|E

5|$|In Washington, D.C., {{sustained}} winds remained below {{tropical storm}} force, though gusts reached 71mph (114km/h) as {{recorded by the}} National Academy of Science. Hurricane-force winds existed several hundred feet in the <b>air,</b> <b>with</b> wind sensors {{on the top of}} tall buildings recording winds of 70 to 85mph (115 to 135km/h). Rainfall was minimal, amounting to around two inches across the district. A gauge on Wisconsin Avenue recorded a storm surge of 11.3feet (3.4m), and a gauge on a pier in the southwest portion of the district recorded a storm surge of 10.25feet (3.1m). Both observations were records, surpassing the previous observation set by the 1933 Chesapeake Potomac Hurricane.|$|E
5|$|In his 1638 Discorsi, Galileo's {{character}} Salviati, {{widely regarded}} as Galileo's spokesman, held that all unequal weights would fall with the same finite speed in a vacuum. But this had previously been proposed by Lucretius and Simon Stevin. Cristiano Banti's Salviati also held it could be experimentally demonstrated by the comparison of pendulum motions in <b>air</b> <b>with</b> bobs of lead and of cork which had different weight but which were otherwise similar.|$|E

Eleven survey meters and a Geiger counter were shipped to England in early 1944, along with 1,500 film packets, which {{were used to}} measure radiation exposure. Another 25 survey meters, 5 Geiger counters and 1,500 film packets were held in storage in the United States, but in readiness to be shipped by <b>air</b> <b>with</b> the highest priority. Chemical Warfare Service teams were trained in its use, and Signal Corps personnel in its maintenance. The equipment was held in readiness, but the preparations were not needed, because the Germans had not developed such weapons.|$|E

5|$|Potassium is an {{extremely}} active metal that reacts violently with oxygen in water and <b>air.</b> <b>With</b> oxygen it forms potassium peroxide, and with water potassium forms potassium hydroxide. The reaction of potassium with water is dangerous because of its violent exothermic character {{and the production of}} hydrogen gas. Hydrogen reacts again with atmospheric oxygen, producing water, which reacts with the remaining potassium. This reaction requires only traces of water; because of this, potassium and the liquid sodium-potassium — NaK — are potent desiccants {{that can be used to}} dry solvents prior to distillation.|$|E
5|$|Prithu himself {{shattered}} many mountains {{with his}} arrows {{and made the}} earth even.

Mountains made way for Prithu on his chariot and his flagstaff was never entangled when Prithu travelled through dense forests as the trees made way for him.

5|$|Scandium is a {{soft metal}} with a silvery appearance. It {{develops}} a slightly yellowish or pinkish cast when oxidized by air. It {{is susceptible to}} weathering and dissolves slowly in most dilute acids. It does not react with a 1:1 mixture of nitric acid (HNO3) and 48% hydrofluoric acid (HF), possibly due {{to the formation of}} an impermeable passive layer. Scandium turnings ignite in <b>air</b> <b>with</b> a brilliant yellow flame to form scandium(III) oxide.|$|E
5|$|Television {{broadcasting}} in Winnipeg {{started in}} 1954.

In May 1954, CBWT went on the <b>air</b> <b>with</b> four hours of broadcasting per day. There are now five English-language stations and one French-language station based in Winnipeg.

CBC Radio One and CBC Radio 2 broadcast local and national programming in the city. NCI is devoted to Aboriginal programming.|$|E
