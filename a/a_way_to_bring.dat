Nevertheless, {{the roots of}} present-day communities along the river were established during the colonial era. In 1695, a land agent named Isaac See settled at the north bound of Philipse Manor, in the flat land between {{a bend in the}} river. Other farmers came to the area, and the settlement ultimately became today's village of Pleasantville.|$|E
5|$|Partly as <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> {{publicity}} {{to progress}} in physics, Feynman offered $1,000 prizes {{for two of}} his challenges in nanotechnology; one was claimed by William McLellan and the other by Tom Newman. He {{was also one of}} the first scientists to conceive the possibility of quantum computers. In 1984–86, he developed a variational method for the approximate calculation of path integrals, which has led to a powerful method of converting divergent perturbation expansions into convergent strong-coupling expansions (variational perturbation theory) and, as a consequence, to the most accurate determination of critical exponents measured in satellite experiments.|$|E
5|$|Allen and {{his family}} moved to Burlington in 1787, which was no longer a small {{frontier}} settlement but a small town, and much more to Allen's liking than the larger community that Bennington had become. He frequented the tavern there, and began work on An Essay on the Universal Plenitude of Being, which he characterized as an appendix to Reason. This essay was less polemic than many of his earlier writings. He affirmed the perfection of God and His creation, and credited intuition as well as reason as <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> Man closer to the universe. The work was not published until long after his death, and is primarily of interest to students of Transcendentalism, a movement the work foreshadows.|$|E

While negotiating Tracy's new contract, Jack mentions this fact, which comes as a shock to Tracy, who had never realized that he could survive financially without the income. After realizing that Tracy has quit the show, Jack must find <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> him back, after Tracy's son, Tracy Jr. (Bobb'e J.

Meanwhile, in order to get attention for herself, Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) decides to cut her hair for charity as a publicity stunt. Jenna makes an appearance on NBC's Today Show, where her haircut will be broadcast. Meredith Vieira asks Jenna's opinion on the news that Tracy has left TGS. At learning this, Jenna bails out on her haircut.|$|E
5|$|The group battles Fei-Wang who {{destroys the}} Syaoran clone when he betrays him. He then uses the immeasurably strong ability and {{strength}} of the two Sakuras to resurrect Yūko, accidentally frozen in time by Clow Reed himself to halt her death, therein proving himself Clow's superior. Yūko uses her life and Clow's magic as payment to make the clones reborn {{in the past to}} live together. As the two know all of the series' events would repeat, the clones seal themselves in Yūko's shop until the battle against him. The group manages to kill Fei-Wang, who traps Syaoran in a void between time and space, dragging both his clone and Watanuki along as a consequence of their connection. With their creator's death, both clones of Sakura and Syaoran fade away leaving behind two feathers. Syaoran and Watanuki escape from the void for a price: Syaoran must continue traveling through the dimensions forever, while Watanuki must stay in Yūko's shop. The group rests in the Kingdom of Clow where Fai, Kurogane, and Mokona decide to join Syaoran once again in hope of finding <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> back the clones who still exist as the two feathers. Before departing on their separate ways, Syaoran and Sakura confess their mutually strong, close and pure romantic love for each other as they hope to meet again.|$|E

25|$|Grayson's {{regiment}} {{was one of}} 16 planned Additional Continental Regiments. Unlike the September 1776 state regiments, the Additional Regiments {{were put}} directly under Washington's control. On 27 December 1776, the Second Continental Congress authorized these units, along with three artillery regiments, 3,000 light cavalry, and an engineer corps. Washington was convinced that capable officers were being held back by the states on political grounds. Activating the Additional Regiments was seen as <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> these competent men into leadership roles in the Continental Army. Three Additional Regiments were allotted to Virginia.|$|E
25|$|According to the tale, three {{brothers}} evaded Death, who {{gave them a}} choice of anything they wanted. The first brother chose a wand {{that could not be}} defeated in battle, the second brother asked for <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> back someone from the dead, and the third brother selected a cloak that made the wearer invisible, even to Death himself. Eventually, the first brother was killed, the second committed suicide, and finally, the third brother made Death a friend and gave the cloak to his son. The story is generally believed to refer to the Peverell brothers centuries ago, although very few actually believe the story to be fully true. Dumbledore believed that the Peverells were simply particularly powerful and ingenious wizard inventors. The sign of the Deathly Hallows had also been adopted as a personal symbol by dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald; therefore many wizards, such as Viktor Krum, mistakenly understood it to be a symbol of dark magic.|$|E
25|$|The Hudson River valley {{also proved}} to be a good area for railroads. The Hudson River Railroad was {{established}} in 1849 {{on the east side of}} the river as <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> passengers from New York City to Albany. The line was built as an alternative to the New York and Harlem Railroad for travel to Albany, and as a way to ease the concerns of cities along the river. The railroad was also used for commuting to New York City. Further north, the Livingston Avenue Bridge was opened in 1866 as a way to connect the Hudson River Railroad with the New York Central Railroad, which goes west to Buffalo. Smaller railroads existed north of this point. On the west side of the Hudson River, the West Shore Railroad opened to run passenger service from Weehawken, New Jersey to Albany, and then Buffalo. In 1889, the Poughkeepsie Railroad Bridge opened for rail service between Poughkeepsie and the west side of the river.|$|E

25|$|The Duke de Broglie was {{carefully}} preparing <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> down Thiers. He modified {{the rules of}} the Assembly so that the President had the power to veto laws passed by the Assembly, but also requiring that the President ask permission from the head of the Assembly before he spoke to the body. On 2 April, the moderate republican president of the Assembly, Jules Grévy, was forced to resign by a personal scandal and was replaced by a deputy of the center-right, Buffet, who supported a constitutional monarchy. Soon afterwards, on 27 April, an election was held in Paris to fill a vacant seat in the Assembly. Both the candidate of the monarchists and the moderate republican candidate supported by Thiers was defeated by a more radical republican named Barodet, who was supported by Leon Gambetta and the left wing of the republicans. Further elections were held on 11 May: five of the six open seats were won by republicans. The right wing of the Assembly became alarmed that the country was moving too far to the left and {{decided it was time to}} get rid of Thiers.|$|E
