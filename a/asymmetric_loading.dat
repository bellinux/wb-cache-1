The current study explored attaching a rehabilitative anklebot to subjects {{walking on a}} treadmill and observed duration, kinematic, and electromyography data to determine the biomechanical response to the <b>asymmetric</b> <b>loading.</b> The present report identified various gait cycle parameters that changed {{as a response to}} the <b>asymmetric</b> <b>loading.</b> Notably, significant differences in the stride time of the legs occurred under loading, while contralateral stride times also adjusted to remain equal to those of the loaded legs. Symmetry index analysis led to the conclusion that, while the <b>asymmetric</b> <b>loading</b> of the lower limbs had some effects on temporal gait parameters, the body adjusted to minimize any temporal asymmetry. However, goniometer data demonstrated kinematic changes in response to loading as knee flexion peaked earlier in the gait cycle. by Wesley D. McDougal. Thesis (S. B.)

30|$|As an {{assumption}} to this work, we considered only symmetrical loading cases. Two reasons {{did not allow}} to consider asymmetrical loading: first, the geometric imperfection at the unloaded state and second, the high deformability of the mock-up. The deviation of the initial geometry from the theoretical model influenced the structural behavior, producing asymmetrical displacement fields and asymmetrical modal shapes although the symmetrical loading. Hence, asymmetrical loading would have complicated the structural identification of the mock-up. Moreover, since the lowest collapse multiplier is usually associated with asymmetrically loaded grid shells, the Voronoi vault would have prematurely drawn its ultimate limit state for the same (or even lower) loading rates, being the vault not optimized for <b>asymmetric</b> <b>loading</b> conditions.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} was to investigate how <b>asymmetric</b> <b>load</b> carriage affects joint kinetics and postural control during walking and stair negotiation. In the first two studies, frontal plane joint moments were analyzed when carrying unilateral versus bilateral loads during stair negotiation. Peak L 5 /S 1 contralateral bending moments were significantly higher when carrying a 20 % body weight (BW) unilateral load for both stair ascent and descent. In addition, peak external knee varus and hip abduction moments were significantly higher in unloaded limb stance as compared to loaded limb stance. Based on our findings, we suggest that the low back and lower extremity play different roles in adjusting to <b>asymmetric</b> <b>loads</b> and recommend splitting loads bilaterally in order to decrease the frontal plane joint moments. In the last dissertation study, we assessed postural control when carrying unilateral versus bilateral loads during walking on even and uneven surfaces. Carrying 20 % BW bilateral or unilateral loads resulted in a significantly higher double stance ratio than unloaded walking. Carrying a 20 % BW unilateral load or walking on an uneven surface resulted in a significantly increased coefficient of variation (CV) of double stance ratio. Unloaded limb stance had a significantly higher double stance ratio and mean medial-lateral (ML) center of pressure (COP) velocity, although the loaded limb had a significantly higher CV of ML COP velocity. We suggest that load carriage and unloaded limb stance require more conservative postural control, while <b>asymmetric</b> <b>loads</b> and uneven surfaces require more step-by-step postural adjustments...|$|R

Epidemiologic {{studies suggest that}} sudden, unexpected loading will lead to low back pain. Also, <b>asymmetric</b> <b>loading</b> {{is considered to be}} harmful to the spine. It can be anticipated that unexpected <b>asymmetric</b> <b>loading</b> will increase the risk of injury even more. Methods. Ten subjects lifted in an upright posture a crate, in which a mass of 10 kg was placed laterally at the left side either expectedly or unexpectedly.

Unexpected lateral placement of the mass caused no clear increase in peak low back loading. The stiffness of the trunk was lower in the unexpected condition, which, in combination with inadequate net moments produced, resulted in movement of the trunk {{to the side of the}} displaced mass. Conclusions. Unexpected lateral mass placement does not increase the compression force.

40|$|An {{improved}} tensile adhesion button {{has been}} designed and tested that results in higher measured tensile adhesion strength while providing increased capability for testing high strength epoxy adhesive systems. The best attributes of two well-established tensile button designs were combined and refined into an optimized tensile button. The most significant design change to the tensile button was to improve alignment of the bonded tensile button specimens during tensile testing by changing the interface between the tensile button and the tensile test machine. The established or old button design uses a test fixture that pulls from a grooved annulus or anvil head while the new button design pulls from a threaded hole in the centerline of the button. Finite element (FE) analysis showed that <b>asymmetric</b> <b>loading</b> of the established anvil head tensile button significantly increases the stress concentration in the adhesive, causing failure at lower tensile test loads. The new tensile button was designed to eliminate <b>asymmetric</b> <b>loading</b> and eliminate misalignment sensitivity.

40|$|Objective To develop {{modified}} {{finite element}} models to simulate degenerative lumbar scoliosis (DLS) based on the normal lumbar spine model and to investigate the facet joint force of the DLS. Methods A 3 -dimensional finite element model of a normal lumbar spine was modified to simulate 3 different Cobb angles conditions (12. 3 °, 22. 2 °, and 31. 8 °). The stresses on the facet joint were calculated on both sides (right and left) of the each vertebra. Changes of stress and asymmetry in contact forces between facet joints {{in the development of}} DLS were quantitatively analyzed to better understand the development of DLS and the biomechanical forming mechanism. Results The results show that asymmetric responses of the facet joint forces exist in various postures and that such effect is amplified with larger curve. When the Cobb angle was smaller, the convex side of the facet joints suffered larger force. When the Cobb angle was larger than 20 °, the concave side of the facet joints suffered larger force. In the axial-rotation cases, the facet joint compression is less often located on the ipsilateral side than the contralateral side at the same level. Conclusions With the <b>asymmetric</b> <b>loading,</b> facet joints compressive deformation appears on the concave side, and it decreases in the effect of the facet joints to limit the vertebral rotation and listhesis. <b>Asymmetric</b> <b>loading</b> on facet joint contact forces accelerates asymmetry in the lumbar spine...|$|E

40|$|The Photonic Crystal (PC) is a {{potential}} candidate for a compact optical integrated circuit on a solid state platform. The fabrication process of a PC is compatible with CMOS technology; thus, it could be potentially employed in hybrid optical and electrical integrated circuits. One of the main obstacles {{in the implementation of}} an integrated optical circuit is the polarization dependence of wave propagation. Our goal is to overcome this obstacle by implementing PC based polarization controlling devices. One of the crucial elements of polarization controlling devices is the polarization rotator. The polarization rotator is utilized to manipulate and rotate the polarization of light. In this thesis, we have proposed, designed and implemented an ultra-compact passive PC based polarization rotator. Passive polarization rotator structures are mostly composed of geometrically asymmetric structures. The polarization rotator structure consists of a single defect line PC slab waveguide. The geometrical asymmetry has been introduced on top of the defect line as an <b>asymmetric</b> <b>loaded</b> layer. The top <b>loaded</b> layer is <b>asymmetric</b> with respect to the z-axis propagation direction. To synchronize the power conversion and avoid power conversion reversal, the top loaded layer is alternated around the z-axis periodically. The structure is called periodic <b>asymmetric</b> <b>loaded</b> PC slab waveguide. Due to the compactness of the proposed structure, a rigorous numerical method, 3 D-FDTD can be employed to analyze and simulate the final designed structure. For the quick preliminary design, an analytical method that provides good approximate values of the structural parameters is preferred. Coupled-mode theory is a robust and well-known method for such analyses of perturbed waveguide structures. Thus, a coupled-mode theory based on semi-vectorial modes was developed for propagation modeling on square hole PC structures. In essence, we wish to develop a simple yet closed form method to carry out the initial design of the device of interest. In the next step, we refined the design by using rigorous but numerically expensive 3 D-FDTD simulations. We believe this approach leads to optimization of the device parameters easily, if desired. To extend the design to a more general shape PC based polarization rotator, a design methodology based on hybrid modes of <b>asymmetric</b> <b>loaded</b> PC slab waveguide was introduced. The hybrid modes of the structure were calculated utilizing the 3 D-FDTD method combined with the Spatial Fourier Transform (SFT). The propagation constants and profile of the slow and fast modes of an <b>asymmetric</b> <b>loaded</b> PC slab waveguide were extracted from the 3 D-FDTD simulation results. The half-beat length, which is the length of each loaded layer, and total number of the loaded layers are calculated using the aforementioned data. This method provides the exact values of the polarization rotator structure’s parameter. The square hole PC based polarization rotator was designed employing both coupled-mode theory and normal modal analysis for THz frequency applications. Both design methods led to the same results. The design was verified by the 3 D-FDTD simulation of the polarization rotator structure. For a square hole PC polarization rotator, a polarization conversion efficiency higher than 90 % over the propagation distance of 12 λ was achieved within the frequency band of 586. 4 - 604. 5 GHz corresponding to the normalized frequency of 0. 258 - 0. 267. The design was extended to a circular hole PC based polarization rotator. A polarization conversion efficiency higher than 75 % was achieved within the frequency band of 600 - 604. 5 GHz. The circular hole PC polarization rotator is more compact than the square-hole PC structure. On the other hand, the circular hole PC polarization rotator is narrow band in comparison with the square hole PC polarization rotator. In a circular hole PC slab structure, the Bloch modes (fast and slow modes) couple energy to the TM-like PC slab modes. In both square and circular hole PC slab structures with finite number of rows, and the TM-like PC slab modes are extended to the lower edge of the bandgap. In bandgap calculation using PWEM, it is assumed that the PC structure is extended to infinity, however in practice the number of rows is limited, which is the source of discrepancy between the bandgap calculation using PWEM and 3 D-FDTD. In an <b>asymmetric</b> <b>loaded</b> circular hole PC slab waveguide, the leaky TM-like PC slab modes are extended deep inside the bandgap and overlapped with both the slow and fast Bloch modes; whereas, in an <b>asymmetric</b> <b>loaded</b> square hole PC slab waveguide, the leaky TM-like PC slab modes are below the frequency band of slow and fast modes. Therefore, TM-like PC slab modes have significantly more adverse effect on the performance of the circular-hole based polarization rotator leading to a narrow band structure. SOI based PC membrane technology for THz application was developed. The device layer is made of highly resistive silicon to maintain low loss propagation for THz wave. The PC slab waveguide and polarization rotators were fabricated employing this technology. Finally, an a-SiON PC slab waveguide structures were also fabricated at low temperature for optical applications. This technology {{has the potential to be}} implemented on any substrate or CMOS chips...|$|R
