5|$|The eggs of {{amphibians}} {{are typically}} laid {{in water and}} hatch into free-living larvae that complete their development in water and later transform into either aquatic or terrestrial adults. In many species of frog and in most lungless salamanders (Plethodontidae), direct development takes place, the larvae growing within the eggs and emerging as miniature adults. Many caecilians and some other amphibians lay their eggs on land, and the newly hatched larvae wriggle or are transported to water bodies. Some caecilians, the <b>alpine</b> <b>salamander</b> (Salamandra atra) {{and some of the}} African live-bearing toads (Nectophrynoides spp.) are viviparous. Their larvae feed on glandular secretions and develop within the female's oviduct, often for long periods. Other amphibians, but not caecilians, are ovoviviparous. The eggs are retained in or on the parent's body, but the larvae subsist on the yolks of their eggs and receive no nourishment from the adult. The larvae emerge at varying stages of their growth, either before or after metamorphosis, according to their species. The toad genus Nectophrynoides exhibits all of these developmental patterns among its dozen or so members.|$|E

50|$|Genetic {{analysis}} {{suggests that the}} Corsican fire salamander (Salamandra corsica) is the closest related species, and the black-yellow coloration is an ancestral feature of <b>alpine</b> <b>salamanders.</b> Proposed colonization from south (Prealps) to Alps {{was carried out by}} the fully melanistic (derived feature) S. a. atra after the last retreat of the ice sheets.|$|R
5000|$|Reptiles such as adders and vipers {{live up to}} {{the snow}} line; because they cannot bear the cold {{temperatures}} they hibernate underground and soak up the warmth on rocky ledges. [...] The high-altitude <b>Alpine</b> <b>salamanders</b> have adapted to living above the snow line by giving birth to fully developed young rather than laying eggs.

50|$|The <b>alpine</b> <b>{{salamander}}</b> (Salamandra atra) is a {{shiny black}} salamander {{found in the}} central, eastern and Dinaric Alps, at altitudes above 700 m. The western Alps are inhabited by a similar species, Lanza's <b>alpine</b> <b>salamander</b> (Salamandra lanzai), in only one small area. No differences in length are seen between the sexes (9 - 14 cm) and the sex ratio is 1:1. Their life expectancy is at least 10 years. Unlike other salamanders, whose larvae are developed in water, the <b>alpine</b> <b>salamander</b> is a fully terrestrial species. Capture-recapture methods suggest that the species is very stationary; 12 m was the maximum observed distance travelled by one individual during the summer season. About 120 individuals per hectare were counted in most suitable areas with >2000 individuals/ha also observed, suggesting that this rather cryptic species is quite abundant.|$|E

50|$|Pliny {{also notes}} {{medicinal}} and poisonous properties, which are founded in fact on some level, since {{many species of}} salamander, including fire <b>salamanders</b> and <b>Alpine</b> <b>salamanders,</b> excrete toxic, physiologically active substances. These substances are often excreted when the animal is threatened, which {{has the effect of}} deterring predators. The extent of these properties is greatly exaggerated though, with a single salamander being regarded as so toxic that by twining around a tree it could poison the fruit and so kill any who ate them and by falling into a well could slay all who drank from it.|$|R
40|$|International audienceScent marking {{is often}} related to {{activities}} {{associated with the}} occupation of a home range or territory. It is widely agreed that when an animal sends signals, this influences the decisions made by the animal that receives them. Scent marks are mainly used as a warning, in order to decrease the cost of territorial behaviour. They are deposited directly on a substrate by rubbing them on but also through urination and defecation. European terrestrial salamanders show high site fidelity and move very little around their shelter. Risks and costs are compared before an animal decides {{whether or not to}} leave its shelter, and a rapidly detectable and unambiguous cue {{in the direction of the}} home shelter reduces risk. Furthermore, territoriality has also been observed in amphibians, both in Anurans (frogs and toads) and Urodela (newts and salamanders). We tested the use of faecal pellets in <b>alpine</b> <b>salamanders</b> in the laboratory (Salamandra lanzai and Salamandra atra) with regard to homing and territorial behaviour. Our experimental design allowed us to distinguish attraction to from avoidance of shelters containing varying olfactory information. Our results clearly argue for the role faecal pellets play in shelter recognition. Furthermore, contrary to the results observed in other terrestrial salamanders such as Plethodontids, the faecal pellets of S. lanzai and S. atra enable intruders to identify the residents, thus fulfilling the requirements of a genuine territorial warning, as observed in mammals. Excrement marking is used as an economic tactic to identify and warn about the occupation of a territory in these two species of <b>alpine</b> <b>salamanders...</b>|$|R

40|$|Amphibians {{are declining}} worldwide. Recently an alarmingly steep decline in abundances of Fire Salamanders was {{reported}} in the Netherlands. In 2013 a unique fungus, Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans, was isolated and shown to be responsible for the observed mortality in the Fire Salamander populations. In a project funded by the relevant Austrian ministry, we are cooperating with schools to study the distribution and encourage the protection of <b>Alpine</b> and Fire <b>Salamanders.</b> Consequently we decided to test some of the Fire Salamander populations around Salzburg for the presence of B. salamandrivorans within the framework of this project. In addition, we involved the school children in collecting samples in order to introduce them to a current topic and to sensitize them to issues of amphibian protection. Of the 58 skin samples of Fire Salamanders from 8 different locations collected in autumn 2013, none tested positive for the presence of B. salamandrivorans. These results suggest that there is no evidence for infected Fire Salamanders in the study areas around Salzburg...|$|R
5000|$|A species {{complex is}} usually {{a group that has}} one common {{ancestor}} (a monophyletic group), although closer examination can sometimes disprove this.

50|$|The German herpetologist Robert Mertens found a {{pregnant}} Corsican fire salamander in the Restonica Valley that {{gave birth to}} four offspring without gills and already with the characteristic black and yellow of the adults. At the same time, he found normally developing aquatic larvae with their three characteristic feathery external gills on each side of their heads and camouflage blending into the pond's substrate. The astonishing reproductive ability of vivipary is well known from the fire salamander's northwest Spanish subspecies, S. s. bernardezi (Asturian fire salamander) and the <b>alpine</b> <b>salamander</b> (S. atra) from the central and east Alps. This can be interpreted as a local adaptation to xerothermic climate conditions and lack of ponds and brooks.|$|E
50|$|The {{flora and}} fauna of the nature reserve is very rich. In the Kaiser Mountains there are about 940 {{different}} flowering plants, 38 different species of fern and over 400 different mosses. The colonies of fungi and lichen are very rich, with 100 and 236 different species respectively being represented. The forest region comprises mainly mixed forest with beech, fir and spruce. In the submontane area there are also ash and sycamore maple, and, in sunny areas, alder. Hay meadows, poor grassland and pastures are typical of the alpine meadows. In the subalpine region we find the typical dwarf shrub types such as mountain pine and alpenrose, and the rare dwarf alpenrose. Alpine polsterrasen ("cushion grasslands") are found {{all the way up}} to the summit areas. There are various wetlands also stocked with typical plants. As a product of ice age processes the Kaiser is also home to a number of rare, partly endemic invertebrates, such as Allobobophora smaragdina (a yellow-green earthworm), a door snail, and a number of spiders and butterflies. Typical vertebrates are the <b>alpine</b> and fire <b>salamanders,</b> smooth snake, viper (unusual color variants), edible dormouse, hazel dormouse and bank vole. In higher regions there are chamois, stoat, snow vole and mountain hare. Typical birds are wood warbler, the red-breasted flycatcher (for North Tyrol endemic), alpine chough, raven, crag martin, alpine willow tit, lesser redpoll (Carduelis linaria rufescens), alpine accentor, alpine wallcreeper and black grouse - capercaillie and rock ptarmigan. Raptors occurring in the Kaiser are the northern goshawk, Eurasian sparrowhawk, golden eagle, tawny owl, pygmy owl and Tengmalm's owl.|$|R
5000|$|In {{one of the}} {{earliest}} surviving descriptions of a salamander, Pliny the Elder (A.D. 23-79) noted that the creature is [...] "an animal like a lizard in shape and with a body starred all over; it never comes out except during heavy showers and goes away the moment the weather becomes clear." [...] All of these traits, even down to the star-like markings, are consistent with the golden <b>Alpine</b> <b>salamander</b> (Salamandra atra aurorae) of Europe that has golden or yellow spots or blotches on its back and some similarly marked subspecies of the fire salamander (Salamandra salamandra). Pliny even made the important distinction between salamanders and lizards, which are similar in shape but different in other respects, which was not systematized until modern times, when biologists classified lizards as reptiles and salamanders as amphibians.|$|E

50|$|Ovoviviparity is {{a mode of}} {{reproduction}} in which embryos develop inside eggs that remain in the mother's body until {{they are ready to}} hatch. Ovoviviparous animals are similar to viviparous species in that there is internal fertilization and the young are born in an advanced state, but differ in that there is no placental connection and the unborn young are nourished by egg yolk. The mother's body provides gas exchange (respiration), but that is largely necessary for oviparous animals as well. In many sharks the eggs hatch in the oviduct within the mother's body and the embryos are nourished by the egg's yolk and fluids secreted by glands in the walls of the oviduct. The Lamniforme sharks practice oophagy, where the first embryos to hatch consume the remaining eggs and sand tiger shark pups cannibalistically consume neighbouring embryos. The requiem sharks maintain a placental link to the developing young, this practice is known as viviparity. This is more analogous to mammalian gestation than to that of other fishes. In all these cases, the young are born alive and fully functional. The majority of caecilians are ovoviviparous and give birth to already developed offspring. When the young have finished their yolk sacs they feed on nutrients secreted by cells lining the oviduct and even the cells themselves which they eat with specialist scraping teeth. The <b>Alpine</b> <b>salamander</b> (Salamandra atra) and several species of Tanzanian toad in the genus Nectophrynoides are ovoviviparous, developing through the larval stage inside the mother's oviduct and eventually emerging as fully formed juveniles.|$|E
