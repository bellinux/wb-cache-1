5000|$|The another {{characteristic}} {{continuity between}} Kothar and Khidr is their soft and skilled hands. In Ugaritic texts, Kothar is {{mentioned as a}} skilled hand (hrsh yd). Actually, most blacksmiths in mythology were described with such attributions. One of the epithets of the Greek blacksmith Hephaistos, which was used less frequently, was [...] "skilled with both hands" [...] or [...] "all-skilled hands". There are many linguistic remainders which show a symbolic connection between the smithy, skillfulness and hand. For example, in the Ethiopian language, äğāma or <b>äğamma</b> means blacksmith, skillful and it comes from äğ which means hand. In Ethiopian language, äğä wāxe and äğä wārq means also blacksmith, but literally of good or golden hand. In Igbo language the word for arts and craft is nka which derives from another Igbo word aka and aka means hand. In this context {{it is very important}} that Khidr can be recognize by his soft hands among the people. Because the people of Levant and Asia Minor believe that he has boneless hands. Some Sufis teach that we will all meet Khidr at least once in our lifetime, that you will recognize him when you shake hands with a white bearded man with no bone in his thumb. Actually hand or soft hands metaphorically refers skillfulness, generosity and abundance. There is a term in Arabic for skilled men and women which derived from Arabic hand (yad). On the other hand, Arabic semahat used in Islamic mysticism for to be generous and to be soft.|$|E

The catalytic A subunit of calcineurin has three isoforms, alpha, beta and gamma. Their expression and ontogeny {{in the brain}} has not been systematically investigated; such data become important with a report that PPP 3 CC, the gene encoding calcineurin <b>Agamma,</b> is a susceptibility gene for schizophrenia, and the finding that its expression is decreased in the disorder. We used in situ hybridization histochemistry to measure the relative transcript abundance of calcineurin <b>Agamma</b> and the other catalytic isoforms, Aalpha and Abeta, during development of the Sprague-Dawley rat hippocampus and cerebellum. All three isoforms are present in both regions at all time points [embryonic day 19 (E 19) to postnatal day 42 (P 42) ] and undergo developmental regulation, but differ in their ontogenic profile. Calcineurin Aalpha and Abeta mRNAs increased from E 19 through to adulthood, whereas <b>Agamma</b> mRNA was most highly expressed during early developmental stages. Calcineurin Aalpha and Abeta mRNAs positively correlated with synaptophysin mRNA (a synaptic marker), whilst <b>Agamma</b> mRNA was either unrelated to, or negatively correlated, with this transcript.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{measurements of}} the charm sector mixing and CP-violation parameters yCP and <b>AGamma,</b> made using data collected in 2010 by the LHCb experiment at the LHC at s 1 / 2 = 7 TeV. yCP {{is defined as the}} difference from unity of the ratio of the effective lifetime of the D 0 meson decaying to a CP-undefined final state to its lifetime when decaying to a CP-eigenstate. <b>AGamma</b> is the CP-asymmetry of the effective lifetimes of the D 0 and D 0 bar when decaying to a CP-eigenstate. In the absence of CP-violation yCP will be consistent with the mixing parameter y, and <b>AGamma</b> will be consistent with zero. CP-violation in the charm sector is predicted to be very small in the SM, though first evidence for direct CP-violation in D 0 decays has recently been observed by LHCb. Observation of significantly more CP-violation than is allowed in the SM would be a strong indication of new physics. The current world best measurements of yCP and <b>AGamma</b> show no evidence of CP-violation. The methods used to measure the effective lifetime of the D 0 are presented, together with a detailed study of the impact parameter resolutions achieved by Vertex Locator (VELO) sub-detector. A resolution of 1 GeV. The final dataset on which yCP and <b>AGamma</b> are measured comprises 28. 0 +/- 2. 8 pb− 1, from which 226, 110 D 0 to Kpi and 30, 481 D 0 to KK candidates are selected. The dominant sources of systematic uncertainty arise from combinatorial backgrounds and D 0 produced in decays of B mesons. The final results are found to be <b>AGamma</b> = (− 5. 9 +/- 5. 9 (stat.) +/- 2. 1 (syst.)) x 10 − 3, yCP = (5. 5 +/- 6. 3 (stat.) +/- 4. 1 (syst.)) x 10 − 3. yCP is consistent with the world average of y and with zero, and <b>AGamma</b> is consistent with zero.

40|$|The human gamma-globin genes {{form part}} of a 5 -kb tandem {{duplication}} within the beta-globin gene cluster on chromosome 11. Despite {{a high degree of}} identity between the two genes, we show that while the upstream Ggamma-globin gene terminates transcription efficiently, termination in the <b>Agamma</b> gene is inefficient. This is primarily due to the different strengths of the polyA signals of the two genes; Ggamma-globin has a functionally stronger polyA signal than the <b>Agamma</b> gene. The probable cause of this difference in polyA efficiency characteristics lies with a number of base changes which reduce the G/U content of the GU/U-rich region of the <b>Agamma</b> polyA signal relative to that of Ggamma. The 3 ' flanking regions of the two gamma-globin genes have similar abilities to promote transcription termination. We found no evidence to suggest a cotranscriptional cleavage event, such as that seen in the human beta-globin gene, occurs in either gamma-globin 3 ' flank. Instead we find evidence that the 3 ' flank of the Ggamma-globin gene contains multiple weak pause elements which, combined with the strong polyA signal the gene possesses, are likely to cause gradual termination across the 3 ' flank...|$|E

After adsorption of the organism to the HeLa monolayers, an overlay consisting of 10 % newborn calf serum (NBCS), 90 % Eagles basal medium (EBM), and 1. 5 % agar containing neutral red was added. Plaques developed after 24 hr of incubation at 37 C which were indistinguishable from viral lesions. Optimal conditions for plaques included: serum in the adsorption fluid as well as the overlay medium; 1 -hr adsorption time; healthy HeLa monolayers; and the presence of EBM. The formation of plaques instead of colonies in agar was due to the inhibitory effect of NBCS or EBM. By omitting both of these components from the overlay, colonies appeared in place of plaques. Adult bovine serum acted in a similar bacterial colony-suppressing fashion, but fetal or <b>agamma</b> calf serum did not. Furthermore, NBCS or adult bovine serum when incorporated in the overlay medium instead of fetal or <b>agamma</b> calf serum displayed a plaque-suppressing effect by reducing the number and size of plaques formed.

Final state interactions for the ejected pions and nucleons are implemented in a relativistic Glauber eikonal approach. The proposed model {{can account for}} the color transparency (CT) phenomenon and short-range correlations (SRC) in the nucleus. Results are presented for kinematics corresponding to completed experiments for A(gamma,pi -p), A(e, e’ pi+) and <b>A(gamma,</b> pp). The influence of CT and SRC on the nuclear transparency is studied. Both the SRC and CT mechanisms increase the nuclear transparency. The two mechanisms can be clearly separated, though, as they exhibit a completely different dependence on the hard-scale parameter. Recent A(e, e pi+) results point towards the early onset of the CT phenomenon in pion production processes. The similarities in the trends and magnitudes of the computed nuclear transparencies compared to semi-classical models indicate {{that they are not}} subject to strong model dependencies. A comparison made in the model between the density dependence of the A(e, e’p), A(p, 2 p) and <b>A(gamma,</b> pp) reactions shows that the bulk of the (gamma, pp) strength stems from the high density regions in the deep nuclear interior. Despite the strong attenuation, sizable densities can be probed by (p, 2 p) provided that the energy resolution allows one to pick nucleons from s orbits.

Specific populations of myelinated nerve fibers can be investigated by retrograde tracing from a muscle followed by microscopic measurements of the labeled fibers at different anatomical levels. Gastrocnemius muscles of adult rats were injected with the retrograde tracer Fluoro-Gold. After a survival period of 3 days, cross-sections of spinal cords, ventral roots, sciatic, and tibial nerves were collected and imaged on a fluorescence microscope. Nerve fibers were classified using a variation-based criterion acting {{on the distribution of}} their equivalent diameters. The same criterion was used to classify the labeled axons using the size of the fluorescent marker. Measurements of the axons were paired to those of the entire fibers (axons+myelin sheaths) in order to establish the correspondence between so-established axonal and fiber classifications. It was found that nerve fibers in L 6 ventral roots could be classified into four populations comprising two classes of Aalpha (denoted Aalpha 1 and Aalpha 2), <b>Agamma,</b> and an additional class of Agammaalpha fibers.

The levels of total hemoglobin were significantly higher in patients treated with hydroxyurea (mean +/- SD, 9. 6 +/- 2. 16 g/dl) than in untreated patients (8. 07 +/- 0. 91 g/dl).

40|$|Graduation date: 1964 Methods {{examined}} for {{the preparation of}} cells from tissues of salmonid fishes for primary cultivation were the fragment (explant) and enzyme dispersion techniques. Both methods were employed for the cultivation {{of a variety of}} tissues from Pacific salmon, Oncorhynchus spp., and the steelhead trout, Salmo gairdneri gairdneri. A technique was devised whereby embryonic cells of these fishes were prepared in primary culture and maintained with periodic fluid changes and transfers over long periods of time. These preparations, referred to as stock cultures, were used as a cell source for much of the experimental work reported here. The optimum concentration of cell inoculum for primary culture of embryonic cells was found to be one to one and one-half million per ml of culture medium. The optimum concentration of cell inoculum for subcultures of the primary cultures was found to be 600, 000 per ml of medium. Several enzymes were compared with trypsin for the preparation of primary cell cultures. All were able to cause separation of cells from the tissue mass; however, these test enzymes were found to be more toxic to the cells than trypsin. The {{first of a series of}} experiments to determine factors influencing cell growth involved the comparison of five tissue culture media. Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 20 percent <b>agamma</b> calf serum was found to be more growth stimulatory for embryonic cells than any of the other preparations tested. The addition of 25 percent by volume of Eagle's basal medium with 20 percent <b>agamma</b> calf serum removed from an actively growing culture to 75 percent by volume of this same medium failed to stimulate more cell growth than did Eagle's basal medium prepared with all fresh components. There appeared to be no growth stimulatory factors for these cells present in the fluid of actively growing cultures. Antibiotics have been employed at concentrations as high as 1000 units of penicillin, 1000 micrograms of streptomycin and 100 units of Mycostatin per ml of medium for the control of microorganisms without any indication of toxicity. Cultures were routinely carried for long periods of time at concentrations of 100 units penicillin, 100 micrograms streptomycin and 25 units Mycostatin without obvious harmful effects. Vitamin B₁₂ was found to inhibit growth of steelhead trout embryonic cells at concentrations of 0. 5, 1. 0, and 2. 0 mg per liter in Eagle's basal medium supplemented with 20 percent <b>agamma</b> calf serum. Oxaloacetic acid was also incorporated into this same medium at 2. 5, 5. 0, and 10. 0 millimolar concentrations. This compound was found to inhibit the growth of coho salmon embryonic cells. The use of blood serum to supplement media was investigated. Homologous fish serum was toxic for the steelhead embryonic cell cultures tested. Horse serum failed to support growth of these same cells. Human and calf serum, with and without gamma globulin, were compared and the <b>agamma</b> calf serum was superior to the other three as a growth stimulant for fish cells. The growth of coho salmon embryonic cells was inhibited when incubated in an atmosphere containing concentrations of one and three percent CO₂. Steelhead trout embryonic cells were found to grow best at 18 ° and 23 ° C. Twenty-eight and 35 ° C. were both lethal for these cells. Cultures incubated at 4 ° and 13 ° C. failed to grow. Twenty-five degrees centigrade was believed to be inhibitory for these cultures but not lethal. Observations indicated that the pH of the medium used to culture chinook salmon embryonic cells increased in alkalinity shortly after planting, followed by a slow decrease requiring approximately 28 days to reach values near neutrality.

40|$|Chemical and {{physical}} variables influencing the plaquing of all dengue serotypes in two simian cell systems were studied. Calf serum in the nutrient overlay may {{be replaced by}} mouse ascitic fluid or bovine plasma albumin when employing the rhesus monkey kidney LLC-MK 2 cell system for plaquing all dengue serotypes. Doubling the serum concentration in the overlay had little effect in modifying dengue types 1, 2, 3, and 4 plaque titers. Newborn <b>agamma,</b> 4 -week-old and 8 -week-old calf serum gave comparable titers with all dengue virus serotypes. Dengue virus titers, plaque size, and development time were unaffected by sodium bicarbonate concentrations ranging from 1. 1 to 4. 4 mg/ml of overlay. A twofold increase (0. 00332 g%) {{in the amount of}} either autoclaved or filtered-sterilized neutral red reduced the dengue 2 virus titer as much as 2. 2 logs. An increased Mg++ and decreased Ca++ concentration in the overlay medium increased the efficiency of the plaquing system...|$|E
40|$|Data for {{coherent}} photoproduction of pi(O) mesons from nuclei (C- 12, Ca- 40, Nb- 93, Pb-nat), recently {{measured with}} the TAPS detector at the Mainz MAMI accelerator, have been analyzed {{in view of}} the mass form factors of the nuclei. The form factors have been extracted in plane-wave approximation of the <b>A(gamma,</b> pi(O)) A reaction and corrected for final-state interaction effects with the help of distorted-wave impulse approximations. Nuclear mass rms radii have been calculated from the slope of the form factors for q(2) -< 0. Furthermore, the Helm model (hard-sphere form factor folded with Gaussian) was used to extract diffraction radii from the zeroes of the form factor and skin thicknesses from the position and height of its first maximum. The diffraction radii from the Helm model agree with the corresponding charge radii obtained from electron scattering experiments within their uncertainties of a few per cent. The rms radii from the slope of the form factors are systematically lower by up to 5 % for PWIA and up to 10 % for DWIA. Also the skin thicknesses extracted from the Helm model are systematically smaller than their charge counterparts...|$|E
40|$|High {{precision}} fundamental {{neutron physics}} experiments {{have been proposed}} for the intense pulsed spallation neutron beams at JSNS, LANSCE, and SNS to test the standard model and search for new physics. Certain systematic effects {{in some of these}} experiments have to be controlled at the few ppb level. The NPDGamma experiment, a search for the small parity-violating gamma-ray asymmetry <b>A(gamma)</b> in polarized cold neutron capture on parahydrogen, is one example. For the NPDGamma experiment we developed a radio-frequency resonant spin rotator to reverse the neutron polarization in a 9. 5 cm x 9. 5 cm pulsed cold neutron beam with high efficiency over a broad cold neutron energy range. The effect of the spin reversal by the rotator on the neutron beam phase space is compared qualitatively to rf neutron spin flippers based on adiabatic fast passage. We discuss the design of the spin rotator and describe two types of transmission-based neutron spin-flip efficiency measurements where the neutron beam was both polarized and analyzed by optically polarized (3) He neutron spin filters. The efficiency of the spin rotator was measured at LANSCE to be 98. 8 +/- 0. 5 % for neutron energies from 3 to 20 meV over the full phase space of the beam. Systematic effects that the rf spin rotator introduces to the NPDGamma experiment are considered...|$|E
40|$|A {{panel of}} {{previously}} characterized monoclonal antibodies: OKT* 3, OKT 4, OKT 8, OKT 10, OKT 11, OKIa 1, OKM 2; 3 A 1, 4 F 2, UCTH 1 and 5 / 9 {{were used to}} evaluate {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} in patients with severe primary immunodeficiencies: three patients with severe combined immunodeficiency, five with X-linked agammaglobulinemia, 20 with common variable hypogammaglobulinemia, 11 with IgA defect, and one with an unclassified form of T cell defect and hypogammaglobulinemia. Surface markers for T and B cells and in some cases functional assays, were also performed. Our results indicate a heterogeneous pattern in patients with severe combined immunodeficiency: one had peripheral blood mononuclear cells negative with all the monoclonal antibodies used; one had an increase in OKM 2 + cells, whereas OKT 3 + cells were absent; one had defect and imbalance of immunoregulatory T cell subpopulations. Major imbalances of T cell subsets were not detected in patients with X-linked <b>agamma</b> and IgA defect, whereas in some patients with common variable hypogammaglobulinemia an inversion of the physiological ratio between OKT 4 + and OKT 8 + cells was consistently detected. In an unclassified case of primary immunodeficiency, almost all peripheral blood mononuclear cells formed rosettes with sheep erythrocytes, but lacked antigens detected by monoclonal antibodies. Based on these observations, possible sites of defects in the T cell differentiation are discussed. We believe that monoclonal antibodies are useful for diagnosis, classification, and monitoring of therapy of primary immunodeficiencies...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a measurement of indirect CP asymmetries in the charm system. The indirect CP violation for the charm-meson system {{is expected to}} be small in the Standard Model and has not been observed experimentally so far. Effects of beyond Standard Model physics phenomena but as well perturbatively non-calculable processes can manifest themself in a potential non-zero CP violation. The knowledge of the size of CP violation makes a significant contribution for the understanding of the Standard Model and has a direct impact on the effective parameters in the charm system. The LHCb experiment has collected the world largest data samples of charm mesons. The proton-proton collisions data used in this thesis have been recorded in the first run period in 2011 - 2012. They correspond to an integrated luminosity of 3. 0 fb− 1. The measurement uses the singly Cabibbo-suppressed D 0 ->K−K+ and D 0 ->pi−pi+ decays. The charm mesons exploited in this analysis are produced in semi-muonic B-meson decays. Thereby, the charge of the created muon determines the flavour of the charm meson at production time. To perform this measurement, a robust method is developed that reaches a sensitivity at sub-permille level. The indirect CP asymmetry manifests itself in the asymmetries of effective lifetimes, <b>AGamma,</b> of the D 0 and D 0 bar decays and is measured for both decays AGamma(K−K+) = (− 0. 134 ± 0. 077 + 0. 026) ...|$|E
40|$|Normally {{circulating}} human leucocytes {{were found}} to consistently lyse rabbit erythrocyte (RRBC) target cells within 24 hr in culture. The reaction {{is referred to as}} the naturally-occurring cell-mediated cytotoxic, or NOCC, reaction. Characteristics of this cytotoxic reaction are as follows. (i) The cytotoxic reaction described here can be distinguished from the antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxic (ADCC) reaction as conventional Fc receptors do not appear to play a role. Although the cytotoxic reaction occurs optimally in medium fortified with normal human serum to a final concentration of 1 %, neither antibodies nor immunoglobulins in general appear to play a role. <b>Agamma</b> human serum or purified human serum albumin without detectable immunoglobulins are as capable of facilitating and sustaining the NOCC cytotoxic reaction as is normal human serum. Furthermore, foetal calf serum, which promotes the ADCC cytotoxic reaction, inhibits the NOCC cytotoxic reaction. (ii) The NOCC reaction is not a phagocytic one as phagocytosis of the RRBC could not be detected during the culture period. (iii) Monocytes and neutrophils, but not lymphocytes, are capable of lysing the target cells in the NOCC reaction. The effector mononuclear cell is a monocyte with receptors for Fc and C' 3. (iv) The NOCC cytotoxic reaction is dependent upon direct effector cell [...] target cell contact and not upon soluble mediators secreted by the effector cells since third-party bystander erythrocytes are not lysed in the presence of rabbit erythrocyte target cells and human mononuclear cells. Supernatants from lysed RRBC target cells could not lyse fresh RRBC. It is concluded that the NOCC cytotoxic reaction utilizing rabbit erythrocytes as target cells permits the identification of cytotoxic subclasses of monocytes and neutrophils...|$|E

Bacteriol. 91 : 1834 – 1839. 1966. —Maximal growth of Mycoplasma neurolyticum (between 108 and 109 colony-forming units per ml) was obtained after 3 days of incubation at 36 C in broth media containing 10 % <b>agamma</b> horse serum. When whole horse serum {{was used in}} the medium, a complement-mediated inhibition was observed. This inhibition could only be detected when growth was followed by daily plate counts. Maximal growth was delayed for about 24 hr by the horse serum, and the inhibition was spontaneously reversed at the temperature of incubation. Penicillin G was also found to have a temporary inhibitory effect. This was detected with as little as 40 units per ml. Maximal growth was delayed until the 6 th day of incubation, when 200 units per ml was present, and until the 16 th day, when 1, 000 units per ml was present. The survival of M. neurolyticum at undetectable levels in cultures during the incubation period presented an “eclipse” phenomenon which has not been explained. The recrudescence of growth in such cultures late in the incubation period illustrates the events which may occur when mycoplasmas are isolated from clinical material by prolonged incubation in the presence of inhibitors. Survival data showed that M. neurolyticum had greatest stability at pH 8. 0, with reduced viability at pH 9. 0, 7. 0, 10. 0, and 6. 0, in that order The data on growth and stability suggest a close relationship between the species. of Mycoplasma studied and bacteria...|$|E
40|$|Eggs and {{spermatozoa}} of an outbred strain (CD-i) and two inbred strains (C 3 H and C 57 BL/ 6) of mice {{were tested}} for in vitro fertilization. Spermatozoa from CD-i and C 3 H males {{were capable of}} fertilizing large numbers of eggs (73 - 85 percent) from CD-i, C 3 H and C 57 BL/ 6 females in a modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution. In contrast, spermatozoa from C 57 BL/ 6 males were able to fertilize only small numbers of eggs (14 - 30 percent) from C 57 BL/ 6, CD-I and C 3 H females. When gametes of F, hybrids of all possible pairings of the three strains were tested in vitro, the rates of fertilization were high (75 - 95 percent). Altering the medium by increasing bovine serum albumin, decreasing sodium chloride (94. 6 mM instead of 119. 37 mM), or adding agaxnma human serum or bovine follicular fluid did not increase the rates of fertilization when using spermatozoa from C 57 BL/ 6 mice. Preincubating spermatozoa for longer times and varying sperm concentrations also failed to increase the in vitro fertilizing capacity of C 57 BL/ 6 spermatozoa. This was an indication {{that a majority of}} spermatozoa from this strain may not capacitate in a Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution. When spermatozoa from C 57 BL/ 6 males were suspended in a modified Tyrode’s solution, with or without <b>agamma</b> human serum, rates of fertilization were high (94 percent) whenever less than 0. 8 X 106 sperm/mI were incubated for 1 - 2 h before the addition of eggs. This study emphasizes the importance of selecting the proper strain of mouse and fertilization medium for in vitro fertilization...|$|E
