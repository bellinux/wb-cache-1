2500|$|An {{important}} game mechanic is {{the construction}} of a road network so as to allow for an efficient transportation system, as any settlers transporting goods must use roads. To build a road, the player must place a flag, select the [...] "build road" [...] option, and then place another flag. The computer will then automatically find the shortest route between the two and build the road, although the player is also free to build the road manually. To maximize distribution, the player must set as many flags as possible on each road. Flags can only be set a certain distance apart, and serve as transport hubs; a settler will carry an item to a flag <b>and</b> <b>set</b> <b>it</b> <b>down,</b> at which point the next settler along will pick up the item and continue, freeing the first settler to return and pick up another item at the previous flag. The more flags the player has, the more settlers will operate on a given road, cutting down the distance each settler must travel, and reducing the time to transport one item and return for the next, thus avoiding item congestion at each flag. When more than one item is placed at a flag, the game has an adjustable goods priority system, which determines the order in which items are transported. Players can also build shipyards, which allow for the manufacture of boats (can transport goods over small stretches of water), and ships (can transport goods across oceans).|$|E

60|$|No one {{can tell}} what harm an {{earthquake}} will, or will not, do. There are three kinds.

5000|$|Play is {{centered}} on the game board. Dungeonquest is unusual in that the game board is only revealed as play progresses. The board begins blank except for a grid pattern and the treasure at the center. A set of [...] "room tiles" [...] are arranged randomly near the board, face down. Play progresses in turns as each player, controlling an adventurer, selects a tile at random <b>and</b> <b>sets</b> <b>it</b> <b>down</b> on a grid space on the board. Each tile represents a space and {{may be one of}} several different configurations. The space may be a room with several doorways, it may be a turn, a hallway, a dead end, a bottomless pit, a rotating room or several other spaces. In all, the game contains 115 room tiles.|$|R
