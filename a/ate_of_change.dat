In spring, females would normally separate from the males, so they could give birth in more isolated areas. Kids were typically born during May, usually singularly. During the winter, the ibex would migrate to valleys that are not covered in snow. These valleys allowed them to <b>eat</b> regardless <b>of</b> the <b>change</b> in season.|$|R
5|$|Since David {{wrote about}} Mediterranean food in 1950, and indeed since dietary {{researchers}} {{showed in the}} 1950s that people around the Mediterranean had less coronary heart disease than the peoples of northern Europe, the traditional Mediterranean ways of life and <b>of</b> <b>eating</b> have <b>changed.</b> Increased wealth and busy lives have led people to eat more meat and less vegetables: their diet is becoming more northern European, with more convenience foods and with less of a preventative effect on cardiovascular disease.|$|R
40|$|We study a model problem {{describing}} vibrational resonance {{by means}} of a high-order averaging technique based on so-called word series. With the tech- nique applied here, the tasks of constructing the averaged system and the associ- <b>ated</b> <b>change</b> <b>of</b> variables are divided into two parts. It is first necessary to build recursively a set of so-called word basis functions and, after that, all the required manipulations involve only scalar coefficients that are computed {{by means of}} sim- ple recursions. As distinct from the situation with other approaches, with word- series, high-order averaged systems may be derived without having to compute the associated <b>change</b> <b>of</b> variables. In the system considered here, the construction of high-order averaged systems makes it possible to obtain very precise approxima- tions to the true dynamics...|$|R

Following a brief review of discussions surrounding different definitions of local food and the concept of coping strategy, this paper presents the methods for collecting preliminary information about local food coping strategies in Michigan and then discusses the coping strategies of these activists. The consumers we interviewed mostly adopt problem-centered strategies: they change their food-consumption habits including shopping, purchasing, cooking, storing and obviously, <b>eating.</b> None <b>of</b> these <b>changes</b> are easy to implement, and most require re-allocations of time as well as trade-offs to overcome time and cost barriers. In return, most of these consumers feel empowered...|$|R
40|$|The {{provision}} of underground parking facilities (UPFs) {{has become a}} necessity particularly in densely popu lated urban areas and business districts. Indoor air quali ty (IAQ) in such facilities is of great concern due to vehi cle-induced emissions. This paper presents an IAQ as sessment at six representative UPFs in Beirut using car bon monoxide and volatile organic compounds as IAQ indicators. For this purpose, concentrations of both pol lutants were measured at different time intervals throughout the day. Vehicular emission factors (EFs) were estimated using the EMFAC 7 F 1. 1 model. A tran sient mass balance model was then applied to construct concentration profiles. The ventilation rates required to maintain pollutant concentrations within acceptable standards were estimated under maximum UPF occu pancy, and a sensitivity analysis was conducted to evalu <b>ate</b> the effect <b>of</b> <b>changes</b> in EMFAC 7 F 1. 1 input parame ters on EFs and ventilation rates...|$|R
5000|$|Valayapathi's {{story can}} not be discerned from the {{currently}} available fragments of the epic. However some scholars contend that the epic's story has been retold in the 35th chapter of Vaisyapuranam or Vanikapuranam written by Chintamani Pulavar in 1855. Chintamani Pulavar describes the chapter as the story of [...] "Vaira Vanikan Valayapathi" [...] (Valayapathi the Diamond merchant) of the Panchakavyam (five great epics). But the text itself does not contain the word Valayapathi. Tamil scholars M. Arunachalam and Kamil Zvelebil consider this hypothesis as doubtful. The content of the recovered verses {{are consistent with the}} ideals of Jainism and have led to the conclusion that this epic is a Jain religious work. Rejection of worldly pleasures, advocation of asceticism, misanthropy and praise for chastity, horror at meat <b>eating,</b> vision <b>of</b> constant <b>change</b> and transiency all point to the epic's author being a Jain monk. The 345th verse of Tirukkuṛaḷ is quoted in the epic.|$|R
40|$|Nutrition {{intervention}} {{is an integral}} part of type 2 diabetes care. Dietary management entails a series <b>of</b> <b>eating</b> behavior <b>changes</b> regarding meal planning, food selection, food preparation, dinning out, portion control, as well as appropriate responses to eating challenges. Diabetic patients encounter several difficulties in complying with the dietary regime. They exhibit restrictive eating behaviors, they express feelings of dietary deprivation, and rigid dietary control is perceived as the only way to a proper diet and weight management. However, pressure to conform to nutritional recommendations may render diabetics more prone to dietary under-reporting. Binge eating, restraint and body dissatisfaction frequently occur among these patients. Health professionals, therefore, need to take into account these difficulties in their collaboration with the patients in order to improve the effectiveness of nutrition intervention...|$|R
40|$|Eating {{disorders}} {{have been}} defined as "characterized by persistence disturbance <b>of</b> <b>eating</b> or eating-related behavior that results in the altered consumption or absorption of food and that significantly impairs health or psychosocial functioning". The psychopathology <b>of</b> <b>eating</b> disorders <b>changed</b> across time {{under the influence of}} environmental factors, determining the emergence of new phenotypes. Some of these conditions are still under investigation and are not clearly identified as independent diagnostic entities. In this review, the historic evolution <b>of</b> the <b>eating</b> disorder concept up to the recent Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, has been evaluated. We also examined literature supporting the inclusion <b>of</b> new emergent <b>eating</b> behaviors within the eating disorder spectrum, and their relationship with anorexia, autism, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. In particular, we focused on what is known about the symptoms, epidemiology, assessment, and diagnostic boundaries of a new problematic eating pattern called orthorexia nervosa that could be accepted as a new psychological syndrome, as emphasized by an increasing number of scientific articles in the last few years...|$|R
