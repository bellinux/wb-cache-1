25|$|Although it {{is usually}} {{translated}} as 'element' the Chinese word xing literally means something like 'changing states of being', 'permutations' or 'metamorphoses of being'. In fact, Sinologists cannot <b>agree</b> <b>on</b> <b>one</b> single translation. The Chinese conception of 'element' is therefore {{quite different from the}} Western one. The Western elements were seen as the basic building blocks of matter. The Chinese 'elements', by contrast, were seen as ever changing and translation of xing is simply 'the five changes'.|$|E
25|$|Pope Alexander IV and the Curia {{continued}} to live in Naples, until {{the first week of}} June 1255 when they returned to Anagni, and it was not until mid-November that the Pope was back in Rome. There the Curia stayed until the end of May, 1256, when it was off to Anagni for the summer, until the beginning of December. The problem was that Rome was in the hands of Senator Brancaleone degli Andalo, Count of Casalecchio, since 1252, and the Ghibbelines and Alexander was repeatedly driven out by unruly mobs. Rome was home again until the end of May, 1257, until the summer vacation at Viterbo began. The vacation lasted until the end of October, 1258, when the Court visited Anagni again; they stayed until the beginning of November, 1260. The Pope then was able to reside at the Lateran until the first week of May, 1261, when the Court was off to Viterbo again. Alexander IV died at Viterbo on 25 May 1261. A total of nineteen months was spent in Rome, {{out of a total of}} seventy-eight months. Alexander had created no new cardinals, and so the Electoral meeting following his death had only eight participants. The Election was a long-drawn-out one, lasting from 25 May to 29 August 1261. Unable to <b>agree</b> <b>on</b> <b>one</b> of themselves, the Cardinals chose Jacques Pantaléon, the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, who, since 1255, was Papal Legate with the Crusade in the Holy Land. He became Pope Urban IV, and was crowned at Viterbo on 4 September 1261.|$|E

2500|$|According to the pro-Israeli group CAMERA, Nasrallah {{stated that}} [...] "The Lebanese {{refuse to give}} the Palestinians {{residing}} in Lebanon Lebanese citizenship, and we refuse their resettlement in Lebanon. There is Lebanese consensus on this...we thank God that we all <b>agree</b> <b>on</b> <b>one</b> clear and definite result; namely, that we reject the resettlement of the Palestinians in Lebanon." [...] There is broad consensus in Lebanon against the permanent resettlement of Palestinians, due to fears that it could reignite Lebanon's civil war. Likewise, Palestinian refugees in Lebanon consistently favor right of return over Lebanese naturalization.|$|E
2500|$|Historically, {{the words}} {{religious}} and spiritual {{have been used}} synonymously to describe all the {{various aspects of the}} concept of religion. However, religion is a highly contested term with scholars such as Russell McCutcheon arguing that the term [...] "religion" [...] is used as a way to name a [...] "seemingly distinct domain of diverse items of human activity and production". The field of Religious Studies cannot even <b>agree</b> <b>on</b> <b>one</b> definition. Critical theory in Religious Studies encourages a focus on the political nature of any attempt to determine what the [...] "real" [...] boundaries of religion are. Spirituality has more of a clear definition than religion and scholar Siobhan Chandler argues that it is made up of three parts: nature, divine wisdom from a high power, and the self.|$|E
2500|$|Criticisms {{directed}} against Esperanto and other early auxiliary languages {{in the late}} 19th century included the idea that different races have sufficiently different speech organs that an international language might work locally in Europe, but hardly worldwide, and the prediction that if adopted, such an auxlang would rapidly break up into local dialects. Advances in linguistics have done away with the first of these, and the limited but significant use of Esperanto, Ido and Interlingua on an international scale, without breakup into unintelligible dialects, has shown that either a rapid break-up into dialects shall not happen too soon in the future, or that there is enough constant 'standardisation' to reduce {{the diversity of the}} language. Subsequently, much criticism has been focused either on the artificiality of these auxlangs, or on the argumentativeness of auxlang proponents and their failure to <b>agree</b> <b>on</b> <b>one</b> auxlang, or even on objective criteria by which to judge auxlangs. [...] However, probably the most common criticism is that a constructed auxlang is unnecessary because natural languages such as English are already in wide use as auxlangs and work well enough for that purpose.|$|E

50|$|For both HTS {{catalyst}} and LTS catalyst the redox {{mechanism is}} the oldest theory and most published articles support this theory, but as technology has developed the adsorptive mechanism has become more of interest.

40|$|Why is <b>agreeing</b> <b>on</b> <b>one</b> {{particular}} {{name for}} each gene important? As one genome after another becomes sequenced, {{it is imperative}} to consider the complexity of genes, genetic architecture, gene expression, gene–gene and gene–product interactions and evolutionary relatedness across species. To <b>agree</b> <b>on</b> a particular gene name not only makes one’s own research easier, but will also be helpful to the present generation, as well as future generations, of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows who are about to enter genomics research...|$|R

6000|$|For in {{a darkened}} chamber of the fine house at Steamingbath, lies on a sofa Honoria Lavington--beautiful no more; the victim of some mysterious and agonising disease, about which the {{physicians}} <b>agree</b> <b>on</b> <b>one</b> point only--that it is hopeless. The 'curse of the Lavingtons' is on her; and she bears it. There she lies, and prays, and reads, and arranges her charities, and writes little books for children, full of the Beloved Name which is for ever on her lips. [...] She suffers--none but herself knows how much, or how strangely--yet she is never heard to sigh. She weeps in secret--she has long ceased to plead--for others, not for herself; and prays for them too--perhaps some day her prayers will yet he answered. But she greets all visitors with a smile fresh from heaven; and all who enter that room leave it saddened, and yet happy, like those who have lingered a moment {{at the gates of}} paradise, and seen angels ascending and descending upon earth. There she lies--who could wish her otherwise? Even Doctor Autotheus Maresnest, the celebrated mesmeriser, who, though he laughs at the Resurrection of the Lord, is confidently reported to have raised more than one corpse to life himself, was heard to say, after having attended her professionally, that her waking bliss and peace, although unfortunately unattributable even to autocatalepsy, much less to somnambulist exaltation, was on the whole, however unscientific, almost as enviable.|$|E
