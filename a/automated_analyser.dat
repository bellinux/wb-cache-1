40|$|Objective. To {{determine}} the feasibility, accuracy {{and cost of}} developing a system of on-site screening for anaemia in pregnancy in primary care clinics. Setting. Mobile clinic team in Hlabisa health district, KwaZulu-Natal. Methods. Four hundred and forty-nine consecutive women attending antenatal clinics were screened for anaemia (haemoglobin < 10 g/dl) using copper sulphate solution; the results were compared with true haemoglobin levels as determined by an <b>automated</b> <b>analyser,</b> Three hundred women had haemoglobin concentration estimated with a portable haemoglobinometer and results compared with those from the <b>automated</b> <b>analyser.</b> Results. Screening with copper sulphate solution was highly sensitive (95. 7 %) but had low positive predictive value for anaemia (37. 2 %). Haemoglobin concentration estimated by haemoglobinometer correlated highly with results from the analyser (r = 0. 82; P < 0. 0001), and the mean difference in concentrations between the two methods was 1. 1 g/dl. The average cost of screening all women with copper sulphate solution (6 cents/sample) and determining the true concentration in those screened as possibly anaemic(R 2. 64 /sample) was 72 cents per woman. The cost of using an <b>automated</b> <b>analyser</b> was R 6. 20 per sample. Conclusion. Combined use of copper sulphate solution and a haemoglobinometer is a feasible, accurate and cost-effective way of screening for and diagnosing anaemia in pregnant women, on-site, in primary care clinics. 3 page(s...|$|E

40|$|Plasma {{fibrinogen}} measurement is {{a routine}} laboratory procedure commonly performed on <b>automated</b> coagulation <b>analysers.</b> Its determination is quantitative, not quantitative. Yet, {{a lack of}} precision has been an issue for fibrinogen measurement. A control material derived from plasma comprises many proteins, inhibitors and fatty acids, {{any or all of}} which can interfere in the fibrinogen assay. This study has attempted to develop a quality control material using purified human fibrinogen and has compared measurement precision between both purified and plasma materials. Purified fibrinogen was prepared using Cohn fraction 1 and glycine precipitation. Purified fibrinogen clottability was greater than 95 %, with no main plasma proteins, lipids or fibrinogen degradation products observed. Two purified control materials were lyophilized at normal (2. 30 g lm 1) and abnormal (1. 20 g lm 1) levels of fibrinogen concentration. Precision was evaluated using a liquid-type reagent, Thrombocheck Fib(L), on <b>automated</b> coagulation <b>analysers.</b> Coefficient of variation for within-run, intraday and between-day precision of the purified materials was 0. 7 - 3. 5 %. In comparison, the coefficient of variation for plasma materials ranged from 1. 2 to 5. 3 %.

40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{evaluated}} the recently released chemiluminescence assay for 25 -hydroxy vitamin D (25 -OHD) on the Immunodiagnostic Systems iSYS (IDS-iSYS) <b>automated</b> <b>analyser.</b> METHODS: The IDS-iSYS comparison was performed using patient samples previously measured for 25 -OHD by a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method (n = 119) and an IDS enzyme immunoassy (IDS-EIA) method (n = 64). Limit of detection and {{limit of quantification}} were determined from a precision profile. Imprecision was assessed using quality control material and pooled serum. External QAP material (Vitamin D External Quality Assessment Scheme, UK) was analysed to establish inaccuracy. Linearity was assessed by two dilution studies. Cross-reactivity was determined by three serial dilution studies of patient samples with known 25 -OHD(2) concentrations. RESULTS: The IDS-iSYS correlated well with both established methods (iSYS = 1. 03 LC-MS/MS - 6. 53, R(2) = 0. 82 and iSYS = 1. 07 IDS-EIA - 1. 61, R(2) = 0. 86). Imprecision of the iSYS assay for IDS control material was 13. 4 % at 32 nmol/L, 10 % at 78 nmol/L, 9. 4 % at 161 nmol/L, and for the pooled material 9. 3 % at 72 nmol/L and 5. 6 % at 158 nmol/L. The evaluation found the assay to be highly accurate (IDS-iSYS = 0. 93 ALTM + 3. 79, R(2) = 0. 94) and linear (obs(1) = 0. 93 exp(1) - 5. 05, R(2) = 0. 99 (P = 0. 256); and obs(2) = 0. 97 exp(2) + 6. 07, R(2) = 0. 97 (P = 0. 654); ALTM, all-laboratory trimmed mean). Cross-reactivity studies demonstrated no significant difference to the calculated total 25 -OHD as measured by LC-MS/MS. CONCLUSIONS: Even though the imprecision of the iSYS {{was found to be}} greater than that of the LC-MS/MS and EIA methods, the performance characteristics of the IDS-iSYS 25 -OHD assay are suitable for routine diagnostic purposes on a high throughput <b>automated</b> <b>analyser.</b> Zee N Cluse, Andrew N Fudge, Malcolm J Whiting, Brett McWhinney, Ian Parkinson, and Peter D O’Loughli...|$|E
40|$|A {{multicentre}} {{evaluation of}} the urine test strip analyser Super Aution- 4220 {{was carried out in}} six laboratories. The analytical performance of the instrument with regard to imprecision, linearity, detection limit, drift, carry-over and method comparison was studied. Using the Aution stick 8 test strip the pH, glucose, protein, ketones, bilirubin, blood, urobilinogen and leukocyte esterase were analysed. Specific gravity measurements were performed by refractive index method. Within-run and between-run imprecision determined at three levels of analyte were good. No carry-over was observed. Obtained results were linear through all the described analytical range. No significant drift was detected. Method comparison with some quantitative methods was performed and showed a good correlation with most of the analytes.

40|$|Nitrification {{is usually}} the {{bottleneck}} of biological nitrogen removal processes. In SBRs systems, it is not often enough to monitor dissolved oxygen, pH and ORP to spot problems which may occur in nitrification processes.
