Connected directly to a constant-voltage power supply, a fluorescent lamp would rapidly self-destruct due to the uncontrolled current flow.

40|$|As {{large-scale}} photovoltaic (PV) generation reaches higher penetration levels, {{there is}} a greater need to meet the certain grid code requirements for interconnection. Ultracapacitor, battery energy storage system (BESS) or shunt capacitor have recently been used as <b>auxiliary</b> <b>devices</b> for large-scale PV generator system to meet the grid code requirements for interconnection. Although the individual <b>auxiliary</b> <b>devices</b> are well documented, a comparative study of these devices impact on the damping of electromechanical (EM) modes and oscillatory instability problem has not been reported so far. This paper aims to fill in the gap, and provides a comparative analysis of these <b>auxiliary</b> <b>devices</b> performance along with PV plant on the damping of EM modes. The oscillation problem is analyzed by considering different types of synchronous generator (e. g. hydro, thermal) as the non-electrical components of hydro and thermal units have major influences on system dynamics. The comparisons are based on the results obtained from two-area test system and New England-New York test system (16 machine 68 bus system), which are the benchmark systems for angular stability analysis...|$|R

The <b>auxiliary</b> <b>devices</b> run like many smart spies. They each probe the internal interconnected signals inside a sensor node with extra tributary wires, and then transfers the accuracy test data to the testbed server over additional networks.

40|$|Service vehicles, such as {{refrigerator}} {{trucks and}} tour buses, {{are equipped with}} <b>auxiliary</b> <b>devices,</b> including refrigeration systems and cabin air conditioning systems, which consume significant amount of energy. The engine of these vehicles should idle to supply power for <b>auxiliary</b> <b>devices</b> when they stop for a long time, e. g. for loading and unloading goods. This study proposes a new anti-idling system for service vehicles that powers <b>auxiliary</b> <b>devices</b> by a battery pack and an engine-driven generator (or alternator). In addition to idle elimination which is the main objective of all current anti-idling systems, the proposed system called Regenerative Auxiliary Power System (RAPS) attempts {{to reduce fuel consumption}} by enabling regenerative braking and utilizing an optimal power management system. The objectives of this study are to identify drive and service loads of a service vehicle for component sizing of the RAPS and to develop an optimal power management system for more fuel saving. In order to determine the size of required components (a battery pack and a generator) for the RAPS, drive and service loads of a given service vehicle should be identified. The drive load is the amount of power that is required for moving the vehicle, and the service load is the power consumption of the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>devices.</b> To identify drive and service loads, all the parameters in power balance equation of the engine should be either measured or estimated. As two inputs with unknown variations in this equation, vehicle mass and torque of <b>auxiliary</b> <b>devices</b> are required to be estimated. This study proposes a model-based algorithm that utilizes available signals in the CAN bus of the vehicle as well as a signal from a GPS receiver (road grade information) for simultaneous estimation of the vehicle mass and torque of <b>auxiliary</b> <b>devices.</b> The power management system of the RAPS should determine the split ratio of auxiliary power demand between the generator and battery in order to minimize fuel consumption. It should also guarantee that the battery has enough energy for powering <b>auxiliary</b> <b>devices</b> at all the engine-OFF stops. To meet these objectives, a two-level control system is proposed in this study. In the high-level control system, a fast dynamic programming (DP) technique which utilizes extracted features of the predicted drive and service loads obtains an SOC trajectory. In the low-level control system, a refined Adaptive Equivalent Fuel Consumption Minimization (A-ECMS) technique is employed to track the SOC trajectory obtained by the high-level control scheme. Many numerical simulations are carried out to test the functionality of the proposed identification algorithm and power management system. Moreover, the numerical simulations are validated by Hardware-In-The-Loop (HIL) simulations. The results show the idling is completely eliminated and a significant amount of fuel is saved by implementing the RAPS on a service vehicle. Therefore, the cost of energy can be noticeably reduced and consequently the cost of RAPS is recouped {{in a short period of}} time...|$|R

5000|$|In {{the world}} of gambling, knowing a secret which is not priced into the odds gives a {{significant}} advantage, which may {{give rise to a}} perception of cheating. However, legal systems do not regard secretly making use of knowledge in this way as criminal deception in itself. This is in contrast to the financial world, where people with certain categories of relationship to a company are restricted from transacting, which would constitute the crime of insider trading. This may be because of a stronger presumption of equality between investors, or it may be because a company employee who also trades in the company's stock has a conflict of interest, and has thus misrepresented himself the company.An advantage player typically uses mental, observational or technical skills to choose when and how much to bet, and neither interferes with the instruments of the game nor breaks any of its rules. Representatives of the casino industry have claimed that all advantage play is cheating, but this point of view is reflected neither among societies in general nor in legislation. As of 2010, the only example anywhere of a type of advantage play being unlawful is for an advantage player to use an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>device</b> in the U.S. State of Nevada, whose legislation is uniquely influenced by large casino corporations. Nonetheless it remains a widely held principle that the law should not impose any restraint over the method by which a player arrives at a playing or betting decision from information held by him lawfully and which he is not debarred from under the rules of the game. In [...] "hole carding", a casino player tries to catch sight of the front of cards which are dealt face-down according to the rules.One way of cheating and profiting through gambling is to bet against yourself and then intentionally lose. This is known as throwing a game or taking a dive. Illegal gamblers will at times pay sports players to lose so that they may profit from the otherwise unexpected loss. An especially notorious case is the Black Sox Scandal, when eight players of the 1919 Chicago White Sox took payment from gamblers and intentionally played poorly. Another happened in boxing when Jake LaMotta famously took a dive against Billy Fox in order to obtain his entry to a championship match against Marcel Cerdan, a deal offered by the mobsters who controlled professional boxing.|$|E
