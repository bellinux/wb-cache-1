5|$|Defensive {{structures}} such as spines may be {{used both}} to ward off attack as <b>already</b> <b>mentioned,</b> and if need be to fight back against a predator. Methods of fighting back include chemical defences, mobbing, defensive regurgitation, and suicidal altruism.|$|E
5|$|Hox genes {{determine}} where repeating parts, {{such as the}} many vertebrae of snakes, will grow in a developing embryo or larva. Pax-6, <b>already</b> <b>mentioned,</b> is a classic toolkit gene. Homeobox genes are also found in plants, implying they are common to all eukaryotes.|$|E
5|$|Epiacum is in {{some ways}} a typical Roman fort: inside the wall are {{straight}} roads which cross, a headquarters building (the Praetorium), the commandant's house, a set of barrack blocks for the cohort of auxiliary soldiers, and granaries to store food. Also as usual, there is a bath house and a temple (dedicated by the auxiliaries to the Emperor Caracalla) outside the wall. There is an altar to Mithras and another, as <b>already</b> <b>mentioned,</b> to Hercules.|$|E
50|$|In 1315, {{the commune}} becomes {{independent}} {{and the oldest}} known document about Leukerbad <b>already</b> <b>mentions</b> the baths.|$|R

5|$|One other point, <b>already</b> <b>mentioned,</b> {{was how to}} {{deal with}} the problem of {{rendering}} the poem’s fourth line. Gray remarked to Anstey, “’That leaves the world to darkness and to me’ is good English, but has not the turn of a Latin phrase, and therefore, I believe, you were in the right to drop it.” In fact, all that Anstey had dropped was reproducing an example of zeugma with a respectable Classical history, but only in favour of replicating the same understated introduction of the narrator into the scene: et solus sub nocte relinqor (and I alone am left under the night). Some other translators, with other priorities, found elegant means to render the original turn of speech exactly.|$|E
5|$|The {{surface of}} the nucleus is {{generally}} dry, dusty or rocky, suggesting that the ices are hidden beneath a surface crust several metres thick. In addition to the gases <b>already</b> <b>mentioned,</b> the nuclei contain a variety of organic compounds, which may include methanol, hydrogen cyanide, formaldehyde, ethanol, and ethane and perhaps more complex molecules such as long-chain hydrocarbons and amino acids. In 2009, {{it was confirmed that}} the amino acid glycine had been found in the comet dust recovered by NASA's Stardust mission. In August 2011, a report, based on NASA studies of meteorites found on Earth, was published suggesting DNA and RNA components (adenine, guanine, and related organic molecules) may have been formed on asteroids and comets.|$|E
5|$|Such {{publications}} {{were followed}} by multilingual collections, of which the most ambitious was Alessandro Torri’s L'elegia di Tommaso Gray sopra un cimitero di campagna tradotta dall'inglese in più lingue con varie cose finora inedite (Verona 1819). This included four translations into Latin, of which one was Christopher Anstey’s and another was Costa’s; eight into Italian, where versions in prose and terza rima accompanied those <b>already</b> <b>mentioned</b> by Torelli and Cesarotti; two in French, two in German and one each in Greek and Hebrew. Even more translations were eventually added in the new edition of 1843. By that time, too, John Martin’s illustrated edition of 1839 had appeared with translations into Latin, Greek, German, Italian and French, of which only the Torelli version had appeared in previous collections. What we learn from all this activity is that, as the centenary of its first publication approached, interest in Gray’s Elegy continued unabated in Europe and new translations of it continued to be made.|$|E
50|$|The {{name of the}} {{district}} <b>already</b> <b>mentions</b> the two main geographic features of {{the district}} - the river Rhine which forms the boundary to the north-east and the hills of the Hunsrück cover most of {{the area of the}} district.|$|R
50|$|Epigraphical {{evidence}} indicates that regardless of her origins, Durga is an ancient goddess. The 6th-century CE inscriptions in early Siddhamatrika script, such as at the Nagarjuni hill cave during the Maukhari era, <b>already</b> <b>mention</b> the legend of her victory over Mahishasura (buffalo-hybrid demon).|$|R
5000|$|The Skar-cung pillar erected by Sadnalegs (ruled c. 800-815) {{says that}} {{during the reign of}} Trisong Detsen, [...] "shrines of the Three Jewels were {{established}} by building temples at the centre and on the borders, Bsam-yas in Brag-mar and so on". The first edict of Trisong Detsen <b>already</b> <b>mentions</b> a community of monks at Bsam-yas (Samye).|$|R
5|$|After {{retiring}} to stud full-time, {{he had a}} {{very successful}} career. He became the first All American Futurity winner to sire another winner when his daughter Easy Date won the All American Futurity in 1974. Easy Date was later named 1975 World Champion Quarter Running Horse. He also sired Pie In the Sky, the 1979 All American Futurity winner, and Mr Trucka Jet, the 1985 All American Futurity winner. More than 1,500 of his offspring earned their AQHA Race Register of Merit, and nine became World Champion Quarter Running Horses. Besides the horses <b>already</b> <b>mentioned,</b> the champions include My Easy Credit, Extra Easy, Easily Smashed, Easy Angel, Easy Move, and Megahertz. His foal Sunset Gallant Jet was the 1979 and 1980 AQHA High Point Cutting & Chariot Racing Co-Champion. At various points in time, Easy Jet has led the AQHA's lists of All-time leading sires of sires, All-time leading sires of Register of Merit qualifiers, All-time leading sires of stakes winners, and All-time leading broodmare sires. In March 2008, he still led the list of All-time leading sires of Quarter Horse racehorses by winners, and on the corresponding list ordered by earnings, he ranks fourth. As a broodmare sire, or maternal grandsire, of racehorses, Easy Jet led the All-time leading lists by winners in March 2008, and the same list ordered by earnings had him second. As of 2008, his offspring had earned over $26,000,000 on the racetrack. In total, he sired 2,507foals in 25years of breeding.|$|E
5|$|The 10th Battalion {{was back}} in action on 22–23 August as the Allied advance {{continued}} north of Proyart. The 10th Battalion was in a supporting role protecting the flank of the 1st Brigade. Wilder-Neligan visited the neighbouring battalion, and upon learning of some difficulties due to German positions in a wood, immediately deployed two companies to clear the area, and due to his initiative the advance was able to continue. The 10th Battalion continued in the advance towards the Hindenburg outpost line {{over the next few}} days before being relieved for a short period of training and rest. On 18 September, the battalion saw its last fighting of the war during the capture of the Hindenburg outpost line south of the village of Villeret. In heavy fighting, the unit captured the second and third objectives, and were then relieved and went into a period of training and rest. By this point, the battalion had been reduced to a strength of 517 men. On 10 October, Wilder-Neligan was awarded the French Croix de guerre. He was mentioned in despatches for the fifth and final time on 8 November. After the Armistice of 11 November, Wilder-Neligan remained with his battalion until 1 January 1919. He returned to Australia in July, arriving in Brisbane in September. For his service during the war, in addition to the decorations <b>already</b> <b>mentioned,</b> Wilder-Neligan was awarded the 1914–15 Star, British War Medal and Victory Medal.|$|E

50|$|The {{name of the}} {{district}} <b>already</b> <b>mentions</b> the two biggest rivers of {{the district}}. The Rhine forms the boundary to the west, its narrow valley is used for wine cultivation. The Lahn flows through {{the northern part of}} the district until it joins the Rhine near Lahnstein. In the southern part of the district are the hills of the Taunus.|$|R

30|$|This work {{proposed}} LT-HPM {{and some}} its modifications, {{in order to}} find analytical approximate expressions for stationary functions solutions of the Euler equations, which turned out from four cases studied. Such as it was <b>already</b> <b>mention,</b> research in this area of knowledge is relevant because calculus of variations is a branch of the analysis with applications for both, pure and applied mathematics and expressing the basic principles of physics with simplicity and elegance among others.|$|R

30|$|Allen (1987) <b>already</b> <b>mentions</b> that {{a minimum}} wage can be a useful policy tool when the incentive- {{compatibility}} constraint is upward binding. This would be irrelevant in Allen’s two-type setting with a standard welfare function, since it would require that the redistribution goes from the poor toward the rich. In our case with a three-type framework, redistribution goes from the undeserving poor (who earn less) toward their deserving counterparts (who earn more).|$|R
30|$|Another {{shortcoming}} {{addressed in}} our study involves what Kochhar et al. (2014) call localized bug reports, i.e., bug reports that <b>already</b> <b>mention</b> the file containing the defect on its own description. These bug reports {{should not be considered}} in the evaluation of bug localization techniques because (i) they artificially increase the effectiveness of the techniques (Kochhar et al. 2014), and (ii) it is unlikely that developers would even need assistance from an automated technique to localize these bugs.|$|R

To the name of Silvanus it adds the statement that his body was stolen by the Novatians (hunc Silvanum martyrem Novatiani furati sunt). It does not say that they were brothers.|$|R
25|$|Ruskin's {{work has}} been {{translated}} into numerous languages including, {{in addition to those}} <b>already</b> <b>mentioned</b> (Russian, French, Japanese): German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Hungarian, Polish, Swedish, Danish, Dutch, Chinese, Welsh and even Esperanto and Gikuyu.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{the books}} <b>already</b> <b>mentioned</b> and some smaller treatises Peters {{published}} a philosophical work entitled Willenswelt und Weltwille (1883), and a disquisition on early gold production entitled Das goldene Ophir Salomo's (1895), translated into English during 1898.|$|E

5000|$|See also: Mons Fortis (toponym) [...]In {{the thirteenth}} century, {{the town was}} called Nompot (as stated in {{the charter of the}} city of Alicante). On December 28 of 1328 the king Alfonso [...] "El Benigno" [...] gave Nompot village as part of a series of towns and villages in {{inheritance}} to his other son, the infant [...] "Fernando de la Cerda". In an account book of Don Fernando from 1355, it <b>already</b> <b>mentions</b> the town with the name of [...] "Monfort".|$|R
50|$|However, {{the history}} of the village of Sosnowiec dates back to the year 1227, when it was {{mentioned}} for the first time. It then was a small settlement in the Polish Duchy of Kraków, located in close vicinity of much larger and better developed villages of Sielce and Zagórze (both are now districts of the city). Other districts are even older. Milowice was first mentioned in 1123 as Miley. Documents from 1228 <b>already</b> <b>mention</b> Milowice, Klimontów, and Zagórze. Furthermore, Milowice was placed on a 1561 map.|$|R
50|$|Lazăr has {{among the}} oldest school {{libraries}} in Transylvania. Although the date it opened is unknown, {{it is believed}} to have been operating in the second half of the 18th century. Evidence for this comes from the large collection of Latin and Greek works in rare 16th-18th century editions. Documents from 1810 to 1837 <b>already</b> <b>mention</b> the need for reorganizing the library. There are some 46,000 books in all; most are freely available to students and teachers, but 13,000 appeared before 1900 and are kept separately.|$|R
