5|$|In 1805 or 1806 {{the last}} bull-baiting {{in the town}} took place. On 7 July 1839, a severe fire {{destroyed}} many houses in Cullompton. About {{two thirds of the}} town burnt with 145 houses and other buildings being destroyed. A subscription for rebuilding was set and donations of £5 were made by Barne and Son, tanners of Tiverton, and Cullompton tanners Mortimore and Selwood. In 1847 a riot occurred in the town due to the high price of wheat. Three houses were attacked, including one in Pound Square belonging to Mr Selwood, the owner of a local tannery and also a maltster. He was accused of speculatively buying 2000 bushels of corn and when his house was attacked, almost <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> were broken and his furniture was also damaged.|$|E
5|$|The Bull's Head {{hotel on}} 44th Street, which refused to provide alcohol to the mob, was burned. The mayor's {{residence}} on Fifth Avenue, the Eighth and Fifth District police stations, and other buildings were attacked and set on fire. Other targets included {{the office of}} the New York Times. The mob was turned back at the Times office by staff manning Gatling guns, including Times founder Henry Jarvis Raymond. Fire engine companies responded, but some firefighters were sympathetic to the rioters because they had also been drafted on Saturday. Later in the afternoon, authorities shot and killed a man as a crowd attacked the armory at Second Avenue and 21st Street. The mob broke <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> with paving stones ripped from the street. The mob beat, tortured and/or killed numerous black people, including one man who was attacked by a crowd of 400 with clubs and paving stones, then lynched, hanged from a tree and set alight.|$|E

25|$|The Biba logo {{played a}} crucial part in Biba’s success; the logo was gold and black which {{reflected}} the growing taste in youth for art deco. The logo was designed by Antony Little. To create a look for Biba in the first store, Little painted the Biba sign above the shop and blacked out <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows.</b> The blacked out windows didn’t allow the store’s interior to receive any sunlight, which was vital for the Biba’s art nouveau atmosphere.|$|E

25|$|A tornado caused {{widespread}} damage across downtown Atlanta, including to the CNN Center {{and to the}} Georgia Dome, {{where the}} 2008 SEC Men's Basketball Tournament was postponed. Other buildings that were damaged include the Georgia World Congress Center, Philips Arena (during an Atlanta Hawks game), and the Omni Hotel, which was evacuated after many windows were blown out. The Westin Peachtree Plaza suffered major window damage. The image of the building with <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> blown out became famous and, for a time, was {{the symbol of the}} tornado. Centennial Olympic Park, SunTrust Plaza and historic Oakland Cemetery were also damaged.|$|E

25|$|Entry to most KR models {{except the}} KR201 Sport Roadster and a {{corresponding}} Tg500 version was through a canopy door hinged {{on the right}} side of the vehicle.

On Sport Roadster models, the canopy was fixed and there was neither a top nor any windows at all, only a tonneau cover.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} hours of 14 July 1989, the affair {{allegations}} and suspicions that Allan was a spy led Cornelius Lottering, member of breakaway AWB group Orde van die Dood, to place a bomb outside Jani Allan's Sandton apartment. The bomb exploded on a wall abutting Allan's apartment and shattered <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> in the apartment complex up to the seventh floor but there were no casualties in the blast. Allan's newspaper reported in a front-page spread that the attack was a culmination of a campaign of intimidation against her that had included prowlers outside her apartment and telephone death threats. Lottering was subsequently convicted of the assassination attempt.|$|E
25|$|Scattered {{all over}} England, {{sometimes}} in remote churches, is similar {{evidence of the}} designs, motifs and techniques used in the past. Two churches, St Neot's in Cornwall and Fairford in Gloucestershire, are of particular interest. Fairford escaped the depredations of the Puritan era and, uniquely in England, retained its complete medieval cycle of glass. The theme {{is that of the}} east window of York, the Salvation of Mankind, but in this case the theme is spread across <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> of the church, large and small. The west window, of seven lights, shows a single narrative incident, the Last Judgment. This scheme and these particular windows provided a rare source for the designers of narrative windows for parish churches.|$|E

25|$|The {{explosion}} {{blew out}} <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> in the vicinity, sending {{shards of glass}} into people's faces and bodies as they were hit by falling masonry and timber; severed limbs were hurled into the road and into the mangled front of an office building. The ground floor of the News Letter offices and all buildings in the area suffered heavy damage. The News Letter library in particular sustained considerable damage with many priceless photographs and old documents destroyed. Around the blast's epicentre, the street resembled a battlefield. About one hundred schoolgirls lay wounded on the rubble-strewn, bloody pavement covered in glass and debris, and screaming in pain and fright. A total of 148 people were injured in the explosion, 19 of them seriously, including people who had lost eyes and were badly maimed. Among the injured were many News Letter staff.|$|E
25|$|Building the new chapel {{with the}} same {{proportions}} as the old one and making it fit {{within the walls of}} the old chapel, with a retained high ceiling inside the walls of the former northeast tower (now the northeast corner of the palace), proved difficult for Tessin if he was to be able to adhere to the austere Baroque style where <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> aught to be the same size, and placed in precise rows despite what rooms were behind them. To achieve this, Tessin added a mezzanine floor with smaller square windows just above the lower row of windows. These smaller windows now encircles the whole building, a remnant of the first castle chapel. After the fire, when Tessin could make more substantial alterations, the Royal Chapel and the Hall of State were placed in the southern row instead, and the furniture and inventories, such as benches, household silver and decorations are to some extent preserved in the present-day Royal Chapel.|$|E
25|$|The {{rectangular}} {{windows on}} the south, east, north wing of the east wall, the west wall, and all walls in the north wing are similar. They consist of two rectangular, facing guillotine sashed windows covered by heavy wooden shutters painted dark green and fixed with wrought iron H or H-L hinges. The shutters are not of colonial origin. The east façade had two window openings: a large rectangular one that is 9 feet wide and 8’ 2” high with 16 over 16 glass panes and a circular window above it with an inner section in quarters and an outer section in eighths. The circular window, in particular, is of uncertain authenticity as it is claimed that until restorations in 1930 it contained not the present type of window but either plastered over stone and rubble or a millstone. All of the other windows have 12 over 12 glass panes. The single south window is 7’ 2” wide and 8 feet high white the north wing has two smaller windows on its east and west walls and another on its north face. The frames for <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> are flat with painted wood. The wooden, bottom sill projects slightly from the frame. All have brick sills with ovolo cast bricks marking them.|$|E
50|$|<b>All</b> of <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> are centre opening casements. Each {{window is}} divided into five lights {{arranged}} as a large rectangle bracketed with two small square lights {{at the top and}} bottom.|$|R

25|$|The Journal {{claims to}} have sent the first news report, on the Dow Jones wire, of a plane {{crashing}} into the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. Its headquarters, at One World Financial Center, was severely damaged {{by the collapse of}} the World Trade Center just across the street. Top editors worried that they might miss publishing the first issue {{for the first time in}} the paper's 112-year history. They relocated to a makeshift office at an editor's home, while sending most of the staff to Dow Jones's South Brunswick, N.J., corporate campus, where the paper had established emergency editorial facilities soon after the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. The paper was on the stands the next day, albeit in scaled-down form. Perhaps the most compelling story in that day's edition was a first-hand account of the Twin Towers' collapse written by then-Foreign Editor (and current Washington bureau chief) John Bussey, who holed up in a ninth-floor Journal office, literally in the shadow of the towers, from where he phoned in live reports to CNBC as the towers burned. He narrowly escaped serious injury when the first tower collapsed, shattering <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> in the Journal offices and filling them with dust and debris. The Journal won a 2002 Pulitzer Prize in Breaking News Reporting for that day's stories.|$|E
25|$|The {{church has}} {{undergone}} multiple restorations, including one by John Dobson of Newcastle in 1850, when the Falloden aisle was built; and another by F. R. Wilson in 1867 when the chancel was rebuilt. The first alteration {{seems to have}} been the replacing of the original chancel by another one, probably larger, {{towards the end of the}} 12th century, about 1180. There is no certain proof that this change took place, but the present modern chancel arch is supported upon two capitals that are of the Transitional style. The next change that took place was the addition of aisles to the nave, and the insertion of a three bay arcade on either side in the old walls about the year 1200. No further alteration appears to have been made until the 14th century, when, about 1330-40, the aisles were rebuilt on a more extended plan. They were widened, and were projected westwards as far as the west wall of the tower, so that the tower, which in the Norman church had been isolated, became attached. The two upper stages of the tower were then rebuilt. At the same time, a chapel was added. No other additions or alterations appear to have been made until the 19th century, with a new chancel. <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> in the body of the church were renovated, most of them being copies of the previous ones. Into the walls of the more modern vestry, several ancient stones were discovered during renovation of the old chancel which was of the Georgian period.|$|E
500|$|The windows mainly {{date from}} the 19th century. [...] The south wall of the nave has a blocked-up round-headed window from the 12th century. The 19th-century east window has three lights (sections of window {{separated}} vertically by mullions) topped by tracery in trefoil shapes (decorative stonework in a three-leaf circular pattern). The chapel's north and west window are similar. The north window in the vestry has details {{similar to those of}} the blocked nave window, and reuses some medieval material in the window sill. There is no stained glass in the church; <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> have clear glass.|$|E
