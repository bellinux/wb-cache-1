This is because, for a perfect case, each intersection test would divide the possibilities by two, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> a binary tree type structure.

What fun she was." [...] Novelist Hervey Allen called Marjory Stoneman Douglas and Muir, [...] "the Stewart Avenue Gang". The two were fond of having sherry together and gossiping, but those moments were followed by serious talk {{of the future of}} libraries, and {{the role of women in}} South Florida. They were confidants, and often shared their work with one another. Douglas never learned to drive and never owned a car. Her house also had no air conditioning, electric stove, or dishwasher.|$|E

500|$|The Americans {{continued}} to defy expectations in 1938–39. They again {{qualified for the}} playoffs, losing to Toronto in the first round, while Dutton was named an NHL Second-Team All-Star as coach. [...] He {{led them to the}} playoffs again in 1939–40, but the loss of players due to World War II took its toll on the franchise. [...] After finishing in last place the season before, the league announced that the Americans had suspended operations for the 1942–43 NHL season though Dutton {{continued to}} represent the team on the Board of Governors. Dutton believed that if the Americans could have held on through the war, his team would become more popular than the Rangers. [...] "A couple of more years <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> run the Rangers right out of the rink," [...] he said.|$|E
500|$|By 1972, Deep Purple had {{achieved}} considerable commercial success in Japan, including several hit singles, so {{it made sense}} to tour there. Three dates were booked; the Festival Hall, Osaka on 11 and 12 May, and the Budokan, Tokyo on 16 August, though these were later changed to the 15 and 16 August, and 17 August respectively due to an earlier US tour being rescheduled. The dates sold out almost immediately, and consequently the Japanese arm of the band's label, Warner Bros. Records, wanted to record the tour for a live album to be released in the country. The band eventually agreed to the idea, but insisted {{if it was going to}} be released, they wanted it to be done properly. Gillan recalled, [...] "we said we would have to OK the equipment, we wanted to use our own engineer <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> the last say on whether the tapes were released". The band enlisted producer Martin Birch, who had worked on previous studio albums, to record the shows onto an 8-track recorder so they could subsequently be mixed.|$|E

Brando told a journalist: [...] "If Wally had been a woman, I would have married him <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> lived happily ever after."

2500|$|According to 19th century {{historian}} James Talboys Wheeler, Langhorne was [...] "far {{more tolerant}} of the religious opinions of others, than could have been expected in that intolerant age".

2500|$|According to the Russian {{historian}} Boris Vadimovich Sokolov, Lend-Lease {{played a}} crucial role in winning the war:On the whole the following conclusion can be drawn: that without these Western shipments under Lend-Lease the Soviet Union not only would not have been able to win the Great Patriotic War, it would not have been able even to oppose the German invaders, since it could not itself produce sufficient quantities of arms and military equipment or adequate supplies of fuel and ammunition. The Soviet authorities were well aware of this dependency on Lend-Lease. Thus, Stalin told Harry Hopkins [...] that the U.S.S.R. could not match Germany's might as an occupier of Europe and its resources.Nikita Khrushchev, having served as a military commissar and intermediary between Stalin and his generals during the war, addressed directly the significance of Lend-lease aid in his memoirs:I would like to express my candid opinion about Stalin’s views on whether the Red Army and the Soviet Union could have coped with Nazi Germany and survived the war without aid from the United States and Britain. First, I would like to tell about some remarks Stalin made and repeated several times when we were [...] "discussing freely" [...] among ourselves. He stated bluntly that if the United States had not helped us, we would not have won the war. If we had had to fight Nazi Germany one on one, we could not have stood up against Germany's pressure, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> lost the war. No one ever discussed this subject officially, and I don't think Stalin left any written evidence of his opinion, but I will state here that several times in conversations with me he noted that these were the actual circumstances. He never made a special point of holding a conversation on the subject, but when we were engaged in some kind of relaxed conversation, going over international questions of the past and present, and when we would return to the subject of the path we had traveled during the war, that is what he said. When I listened to his remarks, I was fully in agreement with him, and today I am even more so.|$|E
