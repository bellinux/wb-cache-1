25|$|As the {{popularity}} of Bordeaux wine increased, the vineyards expanded to accommodate the demands from abroad. Henry and <b>Aliénor</b> youngest son, John {{was in favor of}} promoting the wine industry, and to increase it further, abolished the Grande Coutume export tax to England from the Aquitaine region. In the 13th and 14th century, a code of business practices called the police des vins emerged to give Bordeaux wine a distinct trade advantage over its neighboring regions.|$|E
25|$|Eleanor {{is said to}} {{have been}} named for her mother Aenor and called <b>Aliénor</b> from the Latin alia Aenor, which means the other Aenor. It became Eléanor in the langues d'oïl of {{northern}} France and Eleanor in English. There was, however, another prominent Eleanor before her—Eleanor of Normandy, an aunt of William the Conqueror, who lived a century earlier than Eleanor of Aquitaine. In Paris as the Queen of France she was called Helienordis, her honorific name as written in the Latin epistles.|$|E

25|$|Although {{domestically}} popular, French {{wine was}} seldom exported, as the areas covered by vineyards and {{the volume of}} wine produced was low. In the 12th century however, the popularity of Bordeaux wines increased dramatically following the marriage of Henry Plantagenet and <b>Aliénor</b> d’Aquitaine. The marriage made the province of Aquitaine English territory, and thenceforth the majority of Bordeaux claret was exported in exchange for other goods. Upon the ascension of their son, Richard, to the English throne Bordeaux became the base for Richard's French operations.|$|E

So I grew up to the years of pagehood, which came early with me, and forth I went on my first foray {{with the rest of}} them. But as we rode joyously home with our prey before us, a band of full a hundred and fifty men-at-arms set on us in the forest. Our brave thirty--down they went on all side. I {{remember}} the tumult, the heavy mace uplifted, and my father's shield thrust over me. I can well-nigh hear his voice saying, 'Flinch not, Gaston, my brave wolf-cub!' But then came a fall, man and horse together, and I went down stunned, and knew no more till a voice over me said, 'That whelp is stirring--another sword-thrust!' But another replied, 'He bears the features of <b>Alienor,</b> I cannot slay him.'" ...|$|E

50|$|Briefly, under Louis VII 'the Young' (1120-1180), the House of Capet rose {{in their}} power in France - Louis married <b>Aliénor</b> (1122-1204), the heiress of the Duchy of Aquitaine, and so became Duke - an {{advantage}} which had been eagerly grasped by Louis VI 'the Fat' (1081-1137), Louis the Young's father, when Aliénor's father had asked of the King in his Will to secure a good marriage for the young Duchess. However, the marriage - and thus one avenue of Capetian aggrandisement - failed: the couple produced only two daughters, and suffered marital discord; driven to secure {{the future of the}} House, Louis thus divorced <b>Aliénor</b> (who went on to marry Henry II of England (1133-1189), and be known to English history as Eleanor of Aquitaine), and married twice more before finally securing a son, Philippe Dieu-donné ("The God-Given"), who would continue the House as Philip II Augustus (1165-1223), and break the power of the Angevins - the family of <b>Aliénor</b> and Henry II - in France.|$|E
