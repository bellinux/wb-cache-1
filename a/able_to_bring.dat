5|$|Amazings {{reputation}} {{had been}} for formulaic science fiction almost since it began, but White was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> the magazine {{to a higher standard}} than any other editor except Cele Goldsmith, and gave Amazing a respectable position in the field. His successors were not able to maintain the level of quality that he achieved.|$|E
5|$|His staff {{searched for}} volunteers in the Unteroffiziersschulen (non-commissioned {{officers}} schools) and supplementary units. They were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> together roughly 8,000 volunteers, {{mostly from the}} threatened territories of Pomerania, East Prussia and Silesia. Strachwitz's tactics quickly made news within the Wehrmacht, and even Generalfeldmarschall Albert Kesselring, Commander-in-Chief, West as of 11 March 1945, expressed an interest. Strachwitz subsequently had one of his officers transferred to Kesselring's staff.|$|E
50|$|According to Myers-Briggs, ESTPs are {{hands-on}} learners {{who live}} in the moment, seeking the best in life, wanting to share it with their friends. The ESTP is open <b>to</b> situations, <b>able</b> <b>to</b> improvise <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> about desired results. They are active people who want to solve their problems rather than simply discuss them.|$|R

5|$|On 5 February 2009 a fire {{broke out}} at the west wing on {{the third and fourth}} floor of the College building. Eight London Fire Brigade fire engines were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> the flames under control, in the {{meantime}} 35 people were evacuated from the building and a further 100 from adjacent buildings. Fortunately no records or books of the College were damaged. Repairs to the smoke-damaged rooms and exterior brickwork were completed in December 2009.|$|E
5|$|The authors detail {{commonly}} used disinformation tactics by the Soviet intelligence agencies, including forgery as covert operation {{in order to}} fool target dupes into believing such fabricated documents were real. Additionally, the writers explain how Soviet covert spies were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> agents of influence into their fold and do their bidding, whether knowingly or through social influence as a useful idiot.|$|E

5|$|Anderson's efforts helped spark renewed {{interest}} in the trail, and Avery (who led the charge after Perkins’ death in 1932) was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> other states on board. Upon taking over the ATC, Avery adopted the more practical goal of building a simple hiking trail. He and MacKaye clashed over the ATC's response to a major commercial development along the trail's path; MacKaye left the organization, while Avery was willing to simply reroute the trail. Avery reigned as Chairman of the ATC from 1932 to 1952 (he died that same year).|$|E
5|$|Neither of the qaghans {{were able}} to {{successfully}} exert control. Turkic tribes resisted Yuanqing's rule, defeating the qaghan and forcing Yuanqing to return to Chang'an. Kusrau was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> the western tribes temporarily under his rule, but was defeated in 690 during an invasion by the Second Turkic Khaganate, and he too was forced to escape the region with his loyalists. Later attempts to install puppet qaghans failed, and the title {{was reduced to a}} symbolic position in the Tang court.|$|E
5|$|North of the Humber, the kingdoms of Deira and Bernicia possessed rival royal dynasties. Ælla ruled Deira {{until his}} death in 588, leaving his {{daughter}} Acha, his son Edwin, and another unknown sibling. The Bernician dynasty, allied by kinship to the kingdom of Wessex, gained ascendancy over Deira, forcing Edwin to live in exile in the court of Cadfan ap Iago of Gwynedd. In various wars, Æthelfrith of Bernicia consolidated the Northumbrian state, and in around 604 he was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> Deira under his dominion.|$|E

5|$|Not {{until the}} 21st century did players and analysts begin to revive Black's chances in this line. First, Watson {{showed that the}} {{disruptive}} check 9...Qh4+ was playable, the point being that after 10.g3 White is no longer <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> the bishop on c1 to the squares g3 or h4, where it can assist in White's kingside attack. Later players such as Gashimov showed that the queen check is not mandatory, and that Black also retains good chances in the line 9...0-0 10.Nf3 Na6 11.0-0 Nb4, {{taking advantage of the}} outpost on b4.|$|E
5|$|On Russell's Top the Auckland Mounted Rifles {{were in a}} {{precarious}} position; their trenches were still far from being fully constructed, and three saps heading towards The Nek {{had yet to be}} joined up. The 19th Division, using hand grenades, attacked the New Zealanders' position in three waves. The Wellington Mounted Rifles to the north were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> their machine-guns to bear on the attackers. The flanking fire caused devastation amongst the Turkish ranks. At the same time the Aucklands charged them in a counter-attack, forcing the survivors to withdraw.|$|E
5|$|Texian troops confiscated the {{provisions}} they {{found at the}} fort. Although they found 300muskets, {{most of them were}} broken and unable to be repaired. Dimmitt hired two gunsmiths who were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> the remaining weapons into service. The food, clothing, blankets, and other provisions were valued at US$10,000. The new quartermaster at the fort, John J. Linn, reported that 175barrels of flour were confiscated, along with a large supply of sugar, coffee, whiskey, and rum. For the next three months, {{the provisions}} were parceled out among companies in the Texian Army. The Texians also gained control of several cannons.|$|E

Intervention by the Motorcycle Club of Beijing helped him enter the country without any prepayment.|$|R
50|$|The Summit’s {{goals are}} {{to create a}} lasting {{community}} of youths in the Southeast Asian region who are willing and <b>able</b> <b>to</b> work <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> positive changes <b>to</b> {{their lives and their}} communities. Attendees include regional and global business leaders as well as political figures and youths from all over Southeast Asia. 500 of the youth attendees were winners chosen out of the one million participants in the SEAchange survey. These winners were given free transportation, accommodations and tickets to the event. In addition <b>to</b> <b>bringing</b> the youth community together, the Summit saw the release of results from the SEAchange survey, which was presented to the UN and global NGOs and demonstrated what change Southeast Asian youth would like to help accomplish.|$|R
2500|$|Pickle was {{in company}} with [...] on 9 July 1805 when they {{captured}} the brig Argo and the sloop Nelly. Then on 19 July Pickle found herself becalmed in the Straits of Gibraltar. Two Spanish gunboats {{came up and}} fired on her until there was enough wind for Pickle <b>to</b> be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> maneuver <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> her broadsides <b>to</b> bear, at which point she was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> chase the gunboats towards Tarifa. However, the wind faltered, and seven Spanish gunboats came out to harass Pickle. Pickle was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> tack to the shelter of Fort Tangier, though one gunboat continued to harass her until the wind was strong enough for Pickle to sail away {{and return to the}} British fleet. Despite the duration of the engagement, Pickle suffered only one man wounded.|$|R
5|$|The {{documentary}} {{was shot}} on 16mm colour film by cameraman John McGlashan, {{who had also}} worked on the BBC's M.R. James series of adaptations A Ghost Story for Christmas, of which the early installments were entirely filmed in Norfolk (Betjeman was a fan of Jamesian ghost stories, and often read them to the crew while travelling to locations). McGlashan was also a part-time priest for a Liberal Catholic church, and was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> to the production additional knowledge of the Sacraments.|$|E
5|$|The patrolling British {{warships}} first sighted Junon in the Virgin Islands on 8 February. They then chased her {{north into}} the Atlantic Ocean {{for two days}} until the frigates HMS Horatio and HMS Latona were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> her to action. In a bitterly contested running engagement, Junon was badly damaged and suffered heavy casualties before surrendering to the numerically superior British force. She was later commissioned into the Royal Navy under the same name and remained in the Caribbean. Less {{than a year after}} her capture, a French convoy to Guadeloupe recaptured and destroyed Junon; the British subsequently intercepted and defeated the convoy in turn.|$|E
5|$|When {{he moved}} to Salisbury, Allen met Thomas Young, a doctor living and {{practicing}} just across the provincial boundary in New York. The doctor, only five years older than Allen, taught the younger Allen {{a great deal about}} philosophy and political theory, while Allen was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> to Young his appreciation of nature and life on the frontier. Young and Allen eventually decided to collaborate on a book intended to be an attack on organized religion, as Young had convinced Allen to become a Deist. They worked on the manuscript until 1764, when Young moved away from the area, taking the manuscript with him.|$|E
40|$|M. A. This {{study is}} a {{critical}} assessment of F. A. Thuketana's novels, which are a rich addition to the corpus of Xitsonga literature. Narratological aspects evident in his novels Xisomisana, N'waninginingi ma ka tindleve and Ndzi ngo tinciki, were identified. Thuketana is a successful writer, who through his themes, milieu and space, time and characterization, is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> effectively <b>bring</b> out his ideas and thoughts to his readers...|$|R
50|$|The {{number of}} rockets that each vehicle is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> quickly <b>bring</b> <b>to</b> bear on an enemy target makes it effective, {{especially}} at shorter ranges. One battalion of eighteen launchers is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> deliver 720 rockets {{in a single}} volley. The system has lower precision than typical artillery and cannot be used in situations that call for pinpoint precision. It relies on {{a large number of}} shells dissipating over an area for a certain hit rate on specific targets. Nonetheless, because of the short warning time for the impact of the whole volley, the BM-21 is still considered an effective weapon.|$|R

5|$|According to Schafer, Brütal Legend {{had been}} in {{development}} since 2007, prior to the completion of Psychonauts. Schafer noted that in Psychonauts, they attempted to bring together a lot of assets, including characters and environments, but {{were not able to}} successfully integrate them on their first attempt and had to start over on the development of some. In several cases for Psychonauts, changes made in gameplay required them to return and redesign levels to account for the new features. The company decided at the start to use the scrum development approach for Brütal Legend, which they found worked well with their company's culture, allowing them to quickly arrive at playable targets at every milestone. For example, the team was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> about their terrain engine, renderer, and a playable Eddie Riggs within a month of development, and by the third month, the ability for Eddie to drive about the terrain, running over hordes of enemies.|$|E
5|$|Back in Egypt, as-Sallar {{was assassinated}} in 1153 by his son Abbas, Abbas's son Nasr, and caliph az-Zafir, who, {{according}} to Usama, was Nasr's lover. Thirteenth-century historian Ibn al-Athir says that Usama was the instigator of this plot. Usama {{may also have been}} behind the assassination of az-Zafir by Abbas, in 1154. Az-Zafir's relatives called upon a supporter, Ibn Ruzzik, who chased Abbas out of Cairo, and Usama followed him. He lost his possessions in Cairo, and on the way to Damascus his retinue was attacked by the crusaders and Bedouin nomads, but in June 1154 he safely reached Damascus, which had recently been captured by Nur ad-Din. Ibn Ruzzik tried to persuade him to come back, as the rest of his family was still in Cairo, but Usama was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> them to Damascus, through crusader territory, in 1156. The crusaders promised to transport them safely, but they were attacked and pillaged, and Usama lost his entire library.|$|E
5|$|Battleship {{doctrine}} emphasised {{the concentration}} of the battlegroup. In order for this concentrated force to be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> its power to bear on a reluctant opponent (or to avoid an encounter with a stronger enemy fleet), battlefleets needed some means of locating enemy ships beyond horizon range. This was provided by scouting forces; at various stages battlecruisers, cruisers, destroyers, airships, submarines and aircraft were all used. (With the development of radio, direction finding and traffic analysis would come into play, as well, so even shore stations, broadly speaking, joined the battlegroup.) So {{for most of their}} history, battleships operated surrounded by squadrons of destroyers and cruisers. The North Sea campaign of the First World War illustrates how, despite this support, the threat of mine and torpedo attack, and the failure to integrate or appreciate the capabilities of new techniques, seriously inhibited the operations of the Royal Navy Grand Fleet, the greatest battleship fleet of its time.|$|E

I am afraid that very little in that way can be brought up here until the bridge is repaired and the line in working order, for it is as much as the transport will be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> do <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> food enough from Chieveley for the troops and people here." ...|$|R
