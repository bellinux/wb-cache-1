5|$|After being {{recalled}} from Germania, Germanicus celebrated {{a triumph}} in Rome in AD17, {{the first full}} triumph that the city had seen since Augustus's own in 29BC. As a result, in AD18 Germanicus was granted control over {{the eastern part of}} the empire, just as both Agrippa and Tiberius had received before, and was clearly the successor to Tiberius. Germanicus survived <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> before dying, accusing Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso, the governor of Syria, of poisoning him.|$|E

To date, it remains Hamasaki's last two-album release in a single year.|$|E

5|$|After {{his final}} return to Northumbria Wilfrid retired to the monastery at Ripon, {{where he lived}} until his death {{during a visit to}} Oundle, at the age of 75. <b>A</b> <b>little</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> before his death in either 709 or 710 Wilfrid {{suffered}} another stroke or seizure, which led him to make arrangements for the disposition of his monasteries and possessions. He was buried near the altar of his church in Ripon. Bede records the epitaph that was placed on the tomb. Wilfrid was succeeded at Hexham by Acca of Hexham, a protégé who had accompanied him to Rome in 703. The monastery at Ripon celebrated the first anniversary of Wilfrid's death with a commemoration service attended by all the abbots of his monasteries and a spectacular white arc was said to have appeared in the sky starting from the gables of the basilica where his bones were laid to rest.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his failure}} to take Ayutthaya, Tabinshwehti claimed to have regained control of the Tavoy frontier. Indeed, the Burmese chronicles claim the Siamese king had agreed to pay an annual tribute. Even if this claim was true, the Toungoo Dynasty's control over Tavoy lasted <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> in any case. Tabinshwehti was assassinated just {{a year after the}} Siamese {{campaign}} on 30 April 1550, and the empire he had built in the previous 16 years quickly collapsed, with each town claiming a king. Even after Bayinnaung had restored the kingdom in the following years, the frontier region was likely under overlapping spheres of influence. (During his 1554–1555 campaign against Upper Burma, his southernmost garrison was at Ye, not Tavoy.) It was only in 1562 that Bayinnaung made an emphatic claim on the region by setting up a Burmese garrison at Tavoy, in preparation for his invasion of Siam a year later.|$|E

5|$|Kinladze {{transferred}} from Dinamo Tbilisi to English Premier League club Manchester City in 1995, where his dribbling ability and spectacular goals {{made him a}} cult hero, winning the club's Player of the Year award in two consecutive seasons. Kinkladze stayed with Manchester City despite relegation to the Football League First Division in 1996, but the club continued to decline, and after a second relegation in 1998 he joined Dutch champions Ajax. Kinkladze was unable to settle in the Netherlands, and returned to England with Derby County <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> later. He spent four years at Derby, making nearly 100 appearances. After leaving Derby in 2003, he became a journeyman footballer, having unsuccessful trials at several clubs before joining Cypriot club Anorthosis in 2004, where he won a league championship medal. He finished his playing career with Russian club Rubin Kazan in 2006.|$|E
5|$|On April 19, 1861, {{following}} {{the outbreak of}} the American Civil War, White enlisted as a Private in the Hampshire Guards, which later became Company K within the 13th Virginia Volunteer Infantry Regiment of the Army of Virginia. While Company K was under the command of Captain John B. Sherrard, White was promoted to Third Sergeant. White's company under the command of Sherrard departed Romney in June 1861. Within four to five months, White was successively promoted through the non-commissioned officer ranks to Sergeant Major and acting Adjutant of the 13th Virginia Infantry. He was further promoted to Adjutant, but White did not receive a commission. White served in the 13th Virginia Infantry for <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> until he was discharged from his service on account of a disability. White had developed typhoid fever and was ordered to recover in a hospital in Staunton.|$|E
5|$|Supporters rallied and {{collected}} funds for Johnson to complete her {{education in the}} United States, and she enrolled at New York University, completing her Doctor of Education in 1962. When suffrage passed in 1961, Johnson immediately entered the fray, accepting a nomination as a PLP candidate for the Eleuthera District. She wrote a booklet entitled The Next Step: Votes for Women in which she explained useful information for voting, {{such as how to}} register to vote and cast a ballot. She lost the race, but three years later participated in a debate in the push for majority rule on the parliamentary imbalance in the Bahamas with a delegation from the PLP at the United Nations. At that meeting, she met the president of her alma mater from Virginia Union, and agreed to accept a teaching post at Southern University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. <b>A</b> <b>little</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> later, Johnson left Louisiana and came back to the Bahamas to participate in the 1967 elections. The PLP won the majority of seats and she became the first woman appointee to serve in the Bahamian Senate. One of her first acts was to form a committee to help the Haitian diaspora who had fled to the Bahamas because of unrest in their own country. With an estimated 20,000 to 30,000 refugees and a government decree to stop issuing work permits to Haitians, the situation was critical. The following year, PLP had a landslide victory in the 1968 election and Johnson was reappointed to the Senate, and appointed as the first woman to lead government business.|$|E
