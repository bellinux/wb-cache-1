5|$|I {{consider}} {{him to be}} {{one of my best friends}} but the real thing is about managers: I think Steinman's manager is the devil and Steinman feels the same way about my manager. So, we had to communicate through managers and he refused to sign some papers that would have allowed for the recording of Bat Out of Hell III without <b>a</b> <b>hitch.</b> So, really, I didn't sue Jim Steinman. I sued his manager.|$|E
5|$|When Elsa turns twenty-one, {{she is to}} be crowned {{queen of}} Arendelle. She is terrified that the kingdom's {{citizens}} might find out about her powers and fear for her. The castle gates {{open to the public}} and visiting dignitaries {{for the first time in}} years. Amongst them is the scheming Duke of Weselton, and the dashing Prince Hans of the Southern Isles, with whom Anna falls head-over-heels in love. Elsa’s coronation happens without <b>a</b> <b>hitch,</b> but she still remains distant from Anna. When Hans proposes to Anna, Elsa objects, accidentally unleashing her powers before the court. The Duke brands her a monster. Elsa flees the kingdom, but her suppressed magic engulfs Arendelle in an eternal winter. Reaching the North Mountain, Elsa discards her crown and creates a palace of ice in which to live a solitary life.|$|E

His first great success was as Duke Mantee in The Petrified Forest (1936), and this led to a period of typecasting as a gangster with films such as Angels with Dirty Faces (1938).|$|E

25|$|Riding the {{momentum}} of their late season run, on April 4 the Drillers went into Milwaukee and hammered the Wave {{in the first game}} of their best-of-three series 20–6.

To the public eye, this spectacular sight, which involved creatures ranging from newborn lambs and Shetland ponies to Brahman bulls and Clydesdale stallions, was staged with such skill that it invariably took place without <b>a</b> <b>hitch.</b> However, on one memorable occasion a steer broke loose and plunged into the quarters of the Royal Agricultural Society. The Grand Parade continues to take place, though on a somewhat smaller scale, at the Sydney Showground Stadium.|$|E

Further intensive training followed until late October, when the division made its first full-scale attack of the war, at Beersheba. After a silent approach march during the night of 30/31 October, the division bombarded and then attacked Hill 1070, a prominent feature {{in front of the}} Turkish main defences. 181st Brigade advanced on the left at 08.30, with 2/21st in close support, and the position was taken at the double within 10 minutes. 2/21st Battalion lost a few casualties to enemy shellfire while waiting, but none in the attack. The guns then moved up to bombard the Turkish main line, and at 12.15, 181 Bde went forward again with 2/21st in the centre, capturing their objectives without <b>a</b> <b>hitch</b> and forming an outpost line.
