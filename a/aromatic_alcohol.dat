40|$|Many fungi {{undergo a}} {{developmental}} {{transition from a}} unicellular yeast form to an invasive filamentous form in response to environmental cues. Here we describe a quorum signaling pathway that links environmental sensing to morphogenesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Saccharomyces cells secrete <b>aromatic</b> <b>alcohols</b> that stimulate morphogenesis by inducing the expression of FLO 11 through a Tpk 2 p-dependent mechanism. Mutants defective in synthesis of these alcohols show reduced filamentous growth, which is partially suppressed {{by the addition of}} these <b>aromatic</b> <b>alcohols.</b> The production of these autosignaling alcohols is regulated by nitrogen: High ammonia restricts it by repressing the expression of their biosynthetic pathway, whereas nitrogen-poor conditions activate it. Moreover, the production of these <b>aromatic</b> <b>alcohols</b> is controlled by cell density and subjected to positive feedback regulation, which requires the transcription factor Aro 80 p. These interactions define a quorum-sensing circuit that allows Saccharomyces to respond to both cell density and the nutritional state of the environment. These same autoregulatory molecules do not evoke the morphological switch in Candida albicans, suggesting that these molecular signals are species-specific...|$|R

40|$|Colonization by the fungal {{pathogen}} Candida albicans varies significantly, {{depending upon}} the pH and availability of oxygen. Because of our interest in extracellular molecules as potential quorum-sensing molecules, we examined the physiological conditions which regulate {{the production of the}} aromatic alcohols, i. e., phenethyl alcohol, tyrosol, and tryptophol. The production of these fusel oils has been well studied for Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our data show that <b>aromatic</b> <b>alcohol</b> yields for C. albicans are determined by growth conditions. These conditions include the availability of aromatic amino acids, the pH, oxygen levels, and the presence of ammonium salts. For example, for wild-type C. albicans, tyrosol production varied 16 -fold merely with the inclusion of tyrosine or ammonium salts in the growth medium. <b>Aromatic</b> <b>alcohol</b> production also depends on the transcription regulator Aro 80 p.

40|$|Candida albicans is {{a common}} opportunistic, dimorphic human fungal pathogen. One of its {{virulence}} factors is the morphological switch between yeasts and hyphal or pseudohyphal forms, which can invade tissues and cause damage. Our studies focus on factors regulating pseudohyphae and epigenetic modifications of C. albicans. Regulating factors of pseudohyphae are <b>aromatic</b> <b>alcohols</b> and high phosphate. At low concentrations, exogenous <b>aromatic</b> <b>alcohols</b> induced pseudohyphae, as did high phosphate. For addressing the pathways involved in inducing pseudohyphae by <b>aromatic</b> <b>alcohols</b> or high phosphate, we used mutants defective in cAMP dependent PKA pathway (efg 1 /efg 1), MAP kinase pathway (cph 1 /cph 1), or both (cph 1 /cph 1 /efg 1 /efg 1). These mutants failed to produce either hyphae or pseudohyphae {{in the presence of}} aromatic alcohols; but high phosphate still stimulated pseudohyphae. Gcn 4, a transcription activator of more than 500 amino acid related genes, is turned-on in response to amino acid starvation. The accumulation of <b>aromatic</b> <b>alcohols</b> sends nitrogen starvation signals, which inhibit eIF 2 B, which in turn derepresses Gcn 4 p. High phosphate also induces pseudohyphae by derepressing Gcn 4 p, although the pathways involved are still unknown. In sum, <b>aromatic</b> <b>alcohols</b> and high phosphate induce pseudohyphae by derepressing Gcn 4. In this study we found a novel posttranslational histone modification in C. albicans, which is biotinylation. Western blot and Mass spectrometry techniques were used to find that Histones H 2 B and H 4 were biotinylated at every condition tested such as yeast vs. hyphae, aerobic growth vs. anaerobic growth, rich medium vs. defined medium. In C. albicans lysines K 8, K 11 in histone H 4 and lysines K 17, K 18, K 31 in histone H 2 B are biotin attachment sites as found using mass spectrometry. Biotin was also found to enhance the germ tube formation of C. albicans. Germ tube formation assays with biotin-starved cells as inoculum showed low percent of germ tubes (1 - 5 %). Addition of biotin to the media showed 100 % germ tubes. Biotinylation of histones were not detected from biotin-starved cells.

40|$|Asymmetric {{reduction}} of the prochiral aromatic ketone catalyzed by yeast cells {{is one of the}} most promising routes to produce its corresponding enantiopure <b>aromatic</b> <b>alcohol,</b> but the space-time yield does not meet people’s expectations.

Asymmetric {{reduction of}} acetophenone to chiral S-α-phenylethyl alcohol (PEA) catalyzed by the yeast cell was chosen as the model reaction to study in detail the promotion effect of the introduction of the resin adsorption on the asymmetric reduction reaction.
