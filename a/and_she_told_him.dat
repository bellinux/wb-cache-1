25|$|In {{order to}} avoid being delayed by the Virgin and ashamed at having failed to meet her on the Monday as agreed, Juan Diego chose another route around the hill, but the Virgin intercepted him and asked {{where he was going}} (fourth apparition); Juan Diego {{explained}} what had happened and the Virgin gently chided him for not having had recourse to her. In the words which have become the most famous phrase of the Guadalupe event and are inscribed over the main entrance to the Basilica of Guadalupe, she asked, “¿No estoy yo aquí que soy tu madre?” (Am I not here, I who am your mother?). She assured him that Juan Bernardino had now recovered <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> to gather flowers from the top of Tepeyac Hill, which was normally barren, especially in December. Juan followed her instructions and he found Castilian roses, not native to Mexico, blooming there. The Virgin arranged the flowers in Juan's tilma, or cloak, and when Juan Diego opened his cloak before archbishop Zumárraga on December 12, the flowers fell to the floor, and on the fabric was the image of the Virgin of Guadalupe.|$|E
25|$|Bishop Stefan (Nikitin) was {{a medical}} doctor and this {{assisted}} his survival in the concentration camps through work as a camp doctor. He often allowed the overworked and underfed prisoners {{to be allowed to}} stay in hospital to recuperate. The camp authorities became aware of this and warned him that a new trial was probably awaiting him that would have a possible maximum sentence of fifteen years for wrecking Soviet industrial effort by taking workers from their jobs. The bishop was told by a nurse of a woman named Matrionushka in the Volga city of Penza who he should ask to pray for him, and he was told that Matrionushka did not need a letter because she could hear him if he asked for her help. He shouted for her help, and the threatened trial did not happen, and he was released several weeks later. He moved to Penza in order to find Matrionushka. When he met her, she supposedly knew intimate details about him and that he had asked for her help, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that he had prayed to the Lord for him. She was soon arrested, however, and transported to a Moscow prison where she died.|$|E
500|$|The next {{opportunity}} for Rodin in America was the 1893 Chicago World's Fair. Hallowell {{wanted to help}} promote Rodin's work and he suggested a solo exhibition, which she wrote him was beaucoup moins beau que l'original but impossible, outside the rules. [...] Instead, she suggested he send a number of works for her loan exhibition of French art from American collections <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> she would list them as being part of an American collection. Rodin sent Hallowell three works, Cupid and Psyche, Sphinx and Andromeda. [...] All nudes, these works provoked great controversy and were ultimately hidden behind a drape with special permission given for viewers to see them.|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> then <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him,</b> whilst he {{sat there}} hunched and shuddering.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> then <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> {{the strange}} {{story of the}} little lost prince of England.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> so <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> {{of little}} Phil till {{his father was}} seen looking wistfully at him.|$|R
500|$|Sebastian Coe was {{instrumental}} in asking the Queen to take part, responding positively when Boyle first pitched the Happy and Glorious film sequence featuring the Queen. [...] Boyle suggested that the Queen be played either a lookalike, or by a world-class actress such as Helen Mirren, in a location to double as Buckingham Palace. [...] Coe asked Princess Anne, a British member of the IOC and LOCOG, what she thought, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> to ask the Queen. [...] Coe presented the idea to the Queen's Deputy Private Secretary. [...] Boyle was {{surprised to hear that}} the Queen would be happy to play herself, and wanted a speaking part. Filming took place in late March 2012, and Happy and Glorious was produced by the BBC, as was the opening film sequence Journey along the Thames.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{incident}} in 429 showed Qifu Mumo's harshness. [...] His mother had, during Qifu Chipan's reign, been accidentally injured by slingshots fired by Qifu Chipan's official Xin Jin (辛進), while Xin was attending Qifu Chipan on a hunt. [...] The injury disfigured her face. [...] In 429, Qifu Mumo asked his mother {{how she got}} injured, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him.</b> [...] In anger, Qifu Mumo not only executed Xin but executed 27 other individuals related to Xin.|$|E
2500|$|In late Summer 1912, the [...] "Second Military Air Contest" [...] {{was held}} in St. Petersburg, and though injured, Golanchikova tried out several new aircraft, {{performing}} aerobatic maneuvers with skill. She {{had the ability to}} precisely pinpoint each airplane's deficiencies, and engineers began taking notes. That also included Anthony Fokker, whom she met at the show: he asked 'Fräulein Galantchikova' her opinion about his new plane, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> she liked the way his planes [...] "handled".|$|E
5000|$|The song [...] "By the Bed" [...] {{is about}} Alex's grandmother, <b>and</b> what <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> on her deathbed.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> then <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> all--told him {{the truth}} word by word, without {{attempting}} to shield herself or condone her error.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> then <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> the {{sad story}} of her life, as a heroine must do, sooner or later, either to a {{theatrical}} manager or to a reporter.|$|R
2500|$|It {{was obvious}} that his {{drinking}} problem was getting worse. By this time, Bill and Martha fought all the time <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> to stop drinking or move out. He then did move out into a room in their pool house. Martha still took care of him and sometimes he would come {{in the house to}} eat, but he ate very little. [...] "There were days we never saw him," [...] said his daughter Martha Maria.|$|E
2500|$|According to SEC-sponsored, ESPN Films' documentary, [...] "Lolo" [...] about Jones' life (and her {{personal}} {{telling of the}} story during it), the [...] "clipping" [...] of the ninth hurdle at the 2008 Beijing Olympics was attributed to a spinal problem. The doctor who treated her said that the problem {{was so bad that}} he would examine her feet and ask which toe of which foot he was touching <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that she couldn't feel anything. The doctor said that the problem was that, since she couldn't feel her feet, her brain wasn't able to process where they were, leading to the [...] "clipping" [...] in the medal race in Beijing. Also according to the documentary, the doctor operated on Jones to repair the problem and the operation was a success.|$|E
2500|$|The song Midnight Train to Georgia had {{initially}} {{been inspired by}} Fawcett and Lee Majors. Songwriter James Dawn [...] "Jim" [...] Weatherly phoned Majors, {{who was one of}} his friends, but it was Fawcett who actually answered the call. Weatherly and Fawcett chatted briefly <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> she was going to visit her mother and was taking [...] "the midnight plane to Houston." [...] Although Majors and Fawcett were both successful by that time, Weatherly used them as [...] "characters" [...] in his song, about a failed actress who leaves Los Angeles and is followed by her boyfriend who cannot live without her. Eventually the genders were swapped to a failed actor who leaves Los Angeles and is followed by his girlfriend who cannot live without him, a train replaced the plane, and Houston was changed to Georgia. The recording by Gladys Knight & the Pips attained the number 1 position on the Billboard chart in 1973.|$|E
6000|$|When {{he awoke}} towards morning, he asked what day it was, <b>and</b> when <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him,</b> answered, [...] "So I thought. Then I have not lost count of time." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> then <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> briefly of {{all that}} she had passed through since the Wieroos had stolen her and of how Bradley had rescued her and sought to rescue An-Tak, her brother.|$|R
6000|$|For {{the next}} day or two George Hatchard was in such a state of {{nervousness}} and excitement that Alf was afraid that the 'ousekeeper would notice it. On Tuesday morning he was trembling so much that she said he'd got a chill, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>'im</b> to go to bed and she'd make 'im a nice hot mustard poultice. George was afraid to say [...] "no," [...] but while she was in the kitchen making the poultice he slipped out for a walk and cured 'is trembling with three whiskies. Alf nearly got the poultice instead, she was so angry.|$|R
2500|$|Fourth apparition: {{in order}} to avoid being delayed by the Virgin and embarrassed at having failed to meet her on the Monday as agreed, Juan Diego chose another route around the hill, but the Virgin intercepted him and asked where he was going; Juan Diego {{explained}} what had happened and the Virgin gently chided him for not having had recourse to her. In the words which have become the most famous phrase of the Guadalupe event and are inscribed over the main entrance to the Basilica of Guadalupe, she asked: [...] "No estoy yo aqui que soy tu madre?" [...] (Am I not here, I who am your mother?). She assured him that Juan Bernardino had now recovered <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> to climb the hill and collect flowers growing there. Obeying her, Juan Diego found an abundance of flowers unseasonably in bloom on the rocky outcrop where only cactus and scrub normally grew. Using his open mantle as a sack (with the ends still tied around his neck) he returned to the Virgin; she re-arranged the flowers and told him to take them to the bishop. On gaining admission to the bishop in Mexico City later that day, Juan Diego opened his mantle, the flowers poured to the floor, and the bishop saw they had left on the mantle an imprint of the Virgin's image which he immediately venerated.|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him,</b> briefly, laconically, her position. He {{watched her}} closely, curiously all the while.|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> {{about the}} water that had run along {{the nose of the}} old four-wheeler man.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Miss Bertha {{was sure}} it was, so {{that she might have}} all the fortune, <b>and</b> so <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> flung the betrothal ring in his face, and he went right off, and never has been heard of since.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Festing {{asked where}} she {{expected}} to find the mushrooms, <b>and</b> when <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> said, [...] "Very well; I'll meet you. It only means half an hour's journey on your fine English road; that is, if the bicycle holds up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{is talking}} to me, but you don't {{understand}} him," [...] <b>she</b> replied. <b>And</b> then <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> of the ferryman's punishment and afterward explained to the ferryman {{that they wanted to}} stay all night with him and be fed.|$|R
60|$|His {{reply was}} to lean earnestly forward, {{awaiting}} her words, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> briefly of her grievous perplexity about the title-deeds.|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> of {{the incessant}} reading and the remark Mr Clinton had just made. The doctor looked grave, and began thinking.|$|E
60|$|Muriel's {{faith in}} Prescott {{had never been}} shaken, but his {{surprise}} caused her keen satisfaction, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> all she knew about Jernyngham's discovery.|$|E
60|$|She smiled, but had {{no desire}} to laugh at his little {{delusion}} about a mysterious faculty. It is one common enough, and very innocent. The girl was an orphan, <b>and</b> that, <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him,</b> was all <b>she</b> knew of her history.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> thereat <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> {{more of her}} ranch life in {{the days}} before her father died. And Daylight was hugely pleased with himself. They were getting acquainted. The {{conversation}} had not lagged in the full half hour they had been together.|$|R
60|$|He {{accordingly}} went in <b>and</b> asked her. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> {{that he must}} {{wash his}} own sand, and {{that would make it}} clean.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, father, since to him I {{must have}} seemed to deserve the words. Listen." [...] <b>And</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> all that had passed, hiding nothing.|$|E
6000|$|... “Sit down here,” said Kokua, “and let me {{tell you}} a tale.” <b>And</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> the story of Keawe from the {{beginning}} to the end.|$|E
60|$|Her voice fell {{a little}} when she {{mentioned}} her son's name, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> of her plan, {{when he came home}} in the evening, with evident misgiving.|$|E
60|$|Pansy {{presently}} {{told her}} that the only thing she wanted in life was to marry Mr. Rosier. He had asked her <b>and</b> <b>she</b> had <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>she</b> would do so if her papa would allow it. Now her papa wouldn't allow it.|$|R
60|$|Soon sleep came, but {{not without}} dreams. He dreamed that he was rowing Kate on the river at Bridgetown, <b>and</b> that <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> in a low sweet voice, {{with a smile on}} her lips and her eyes tenderly upturned, that she would like to row thus with him forever.|$|R
6000|$|<b>And</b> <b>she</b> never <b>told</b> <b>him</b> who {{his father}} was, {{that he might}} do it. I have [...] thought it all out, fool. I know a great many things because I [...] listen when nobody is noticing and I keep my wits awake. What ails you [...] now? ...|$|R
