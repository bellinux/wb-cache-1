50|$|During {{the eighteenth}} and nineteenth centuries, a {{controversy}} exported from geology, between supporters of James Hutton (uniformitarianism thesis) and Georges Cuvier (catastrophism) strongly influenced the field of geography, because geography at this time was a natural science since Human Geography or <b>Anthropogeography</b> had just developed as a discipline in the late nineteenth century.|$|E
50|$|Economic {{geography}} is sometimes approached as {{a branch of}} <b>anthropogeography</b> that focuses on regional systems of human economic activity. An alternative description of different approaches {{to the study of}} human economic activity can be organized around spatiotemporal analysis, analysis of production/consumption of economic items, and analysis of economic flow. Spatiotemporal systems of analysis include economic activities of region, mixed social spaces, and development.|$|E
5000|$|Ellen Churchill Semple (January 8, 1863 - May 8, 1932) was an American {{geographer}} and {{the first}} female president of the Association of American Geographers. She {{contributed significantly to the}} early development of the discipline of geography in the United States, particularly studies of human geography. She is most closely associated with work in <b>anthropogeography</b> and environmentalism, and the debate about [...] "environmental determinism".|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} the 1870s {{geography}} {{started to}} change its objects and goals, which upset the previously important position of what was then called the ‘Gotha Academy’. When Charles Darwin published The descent of man {{it was the beginning of}} the expansion of human geography, which till then was only rarely focused upon, except in the field of ethnography. The physical-deterministic view of humanity that followed led to the rise of the branch of geography we now call <b>anthropogeography,</b> especially after 1875, when Friedrich Ratzel (1844-1904) was the first new professor of geography appointed in München and later Leipzig (only Carl Ritter ever before had been professor of geography worldwide).|$|E
50|$|Visher’s early {{geographical}} {{work was}} {{heavily influenced by}} Ellen Churchill Semple’s widely-read Influences of Geographic Environment (1911) - {{so much so that}} he introduced much of Semple’s thinking into his geography course at Indiana University in 1919 (Keighren, 2010). He was particularly interested in the fields of <b>anthropogeography</b> and environmental determinism. He borrowed from these geographical trends to help explain, for example, the historic development of urban areas and the ‘geography of notables’ (S. Visher, 1928). In addition, the works of ecologist Harlan Barrows and sociologist George Vincent stirred Visher’s interests in social evolution, educational attainment, civic sciences and the spatial nature of intelligence (C. Lavery, 2015).|$|E
50|$|From {{the birth}} of {{geography}} as a science during the Greek classical period and until {{the late nineteenth century}} with {{the birth of}} <b>anthropogeography</b> (human geography), geography was almost exclusively a natural science: the study of location and descriptive gazetteer of all places of the known world. Several works among the best known during this long period could be cited as an example, from Strabo (Geography), Eratosthenes (Geographika) or Dionisio Periegetes (Periegesis Oiceumene) in the Ancient Age to the Alexander von Humboldt (Kosmos) in the nineteenth century, in which geography is regarded as a physical and natural science, of course, through the work Summa de Geografía of Martín Fernández de Enciso from the early sixteenth century, which indicated {{for the first time the}} New World.|$|E
50|$|Petermann was {{sometimes}} {{accused of being}} an ‘armchair’ geographer as he never traveled wide or experienced new discoveries with his own eyes, but {{the quality of the}} maps and geographic ideas he produced proves the accusation unfair. Some people are better at observing and describing circumstances and phenomena, others are better at interpretation of data. Petermann’s greatest accomplishment lay in the interpretation and evaluation of sometimes contradictory sources, and his great legacy is {{that he was able to}} develop this faculty in most of his pupils in such a fine way that geography at large has profited from it ever since. Should one criticize the journal under his direction for not being geographically innovative then one may come nearer to the truth. Lots of articles are of a descriptive physical nature, with lots of intimate details in the explorers’ colloquial style, and hardly any tries to find explanations for the physical phenomena. Most emphasis is laid on geomorphology and geology — old disciplines by then with their own technical language already — meteorology, botany and biology. Articles on <b>anthropogeography</b> usually reach no further than ethnographic descriptions of regions. It is still the era of data-gathering and in this they weren’t far beyond the cameralistic nature of the first half of the nineteenth century. One should have expected more articles concerning (parts of) Europe, but a count in the annuals for 1860-1864 shows that only 16% of the articles and 22% of the Kleinere Mitteilungen (small communications) concerned Europe. As accommodation one might say that the journal, though geographic by nature, was aimed at popular use. That was one of its strengths, as shown by its large circulation.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to outline a {{genealogy}} of the concept of Lebensraum. It will focus on the way that Darwinian evolutionary thought was translated into 19 th Century German geography, particularly in the work of Friedrich Ratzel and his formulation of the concept of Lebensraum. The paper argues that the Ratzelian Lebensraum must be viewed as a concept aimed towards a synthesis between biogeography and <b>anthropogeography.</b> The paper will also trace how the Ratzelian Lebensraum came to play a vital part in Rudolf Kjellén's later formulation of an organic theory of the state. Here the paper will focus specifically on Kjellén's organic taxonomy of the political system. The paper will end with a short discussion on the synthetic aspects of the Lebensraum concept, focusing on the seemingly divergent ways that the Lebensraum concept was mobilised within National socialist ideology and planning...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{the reception of}} the work of Jovan Cvijić in Slovenian ethnology. Cvijić is considered {{to be one of the}} founding fathers of Serbian ethnology, due in large part to his anthropogeographical orientation that strongly marked ethnological research in Serbia until the second half of the 20 th century. In Slovenian ethnology, the so-called anthropogeographical school is virtually unknown; however, some of its tenets can be recognized or were actively applied in research of cultural areas, carried out by geographers and ethnographers before and after the Second World War when <b>anthropogeography</b> was considered to be a branch of geography and a discipline akin to ethnography/ethnology. The author aims to discuss when, for whom and in what way was Jovan Cvijić direct or indirect reference within the horizon of Slovenian ethnology. His reception is marked by acknowledging the powerful influence of his political views and engagement on his scholarship...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The article {{discusses}} {{several aspects}} of the Greek community of Tunis during the 19 th century. Initially, we will approach the <b>anthropogeography</b> of the Greek community focused {{on the characteristics of}} Greek migration in Tunisia. We will study a few demographic factors and will query why Greeks from certain geographical areas moved to Tunisia. Then we will refer to the main economic activities of the Greeks settled in Tunisia, including the operation of retail stores commerce and sponge fishery. We will define the framework through which, Greeks managed to get significant economic power and become Bey’s main partners. Therefore, we will question the political status of the Greeks located in Tunisia during the 19 th century, analyzing their tactics and the reasons for their way of acting. Finally, we will examine the case of a few Greeks who arrived in Tunisia as enslaved {{in the first quarter of}} 19 th century and gradually undertook import offices in the administrative mechanism of Tunisia government, supporting in parallel the Greek community’s interest...|$|E

Przedstawiono najistotniejsze zdaniem autora problemy badawcze, które należy podjąć w dalszych badaniach dotyczących mniejszości narodowych, etnicznych i etniczno-regionalnych zamieszkujących współczesną Polskę. Omó- wiono różnorodne metody badawcze wraz ze wskazaniem ich zalet oraz licznych ograniczeń. We wnioskach autor przedstawił główne, jego zdaniem, uwarunkowania wpływające na dynamiczne przekształcenia struktury narodowościowej w Polsce oraz zasadnicze cechy relacji państwo polskie – mniejszości narodowe. The {{issue of}} {{ethnicity}} is interdisciplinary and tackled by many sciences such as history, statistics, demography, politology, sociology, ethnology or ethnography, {{as well as}} geography, which focuses primarily on the spatial element of distribution of ethni-cities, the causes and consequences of its changes and the genesis of concentrations of ethnic minorities. As part of population geography or, more broadly, <b>anthropogeography,</b> and apart from geographies of religion and languages, there is a discipline called geography of ethnicity, which studies the numerousness, as well as assesses and analyses the ethnic structures in various spatial scales. Studies of ethnic structures and their transformations are common especially in political geography, which devotes more place to the issues of ethnic, linguistic and religious minorities than any other geographical science. Owing to its ability to study the spatial and temporal context of various phenomena, it facilitates the recognition and comprehension of interrelations between political, demographic, social and cultural factors. Such studies are particularly justified {{in the case of}} clear dependence between ethnic transformations and territorial or political transitions, i. e. the elements within political geography's scope of interest. Studies concerning ethnic minorities in Polish geography have had a long research tradition and great scientific achievements, especially in the interwar period and the last twenty years. These studies, though episodic in Communist times, have seen a contemporary renaissance. When dealing with issues of ethnicity, geography uses the achievements of other disciplines, especially history, statistics, sociology, and political science. The main point of reference in any analyses of the ethnic specifics is space, geographical environment and the socio-economic circumstances, while also considering the influence of historical and political conditions. Close links between political and historical geography caused by both disciplines studying the natural variability over time and space allow for referencing the socio-historical context which is indispensable in this kind of research. The vast majority of national, ethnic and regional minorities living in contemporary Poland {{are a part of the}} historical, cultural and political heritage of Poland, a testament to the former complexity and multicultural character of Poland, a part of its history, present day and, hopefully, its future. These minorities, even though thought of as “different” and separate in regards to their national, linguistic or religious identity are “at home”, with all rights and obligations that entails. Therefore, further research into the ethnic structure of Poland in essential, mainly due to the dynamic changes the country is currently undergoing (quantitative, qualitative, territorial, institutional, cultural, social, political), the growing importance of native regional groups and nationalities stemming from the non-European cultures, as well as the geopolitical, economic and civilisation transformations that are changing Europe...|$|E
40|$|As some has {{attempted}} to prove, both “titular” disciplines have different origins. They differ in their development trends and, thus, in the contents, scope {{and place in the}} system of sciences. However, different paths of development do not preclude them from tackling the same issues, especially considering that historical geography and political geography both refer, the former in a literal sense, to the unique bond between history and geography. Specific topics, that may seem familiar to both disciplines today, were discussed {{as far back as the}} 18 th century, when political geography was still defining its identity and attempting to become a valid subject of geography. However, in the case of this discipline, its interests shared with its historical counterpart (concerning such issues as heraldry and toponymy) were mostly incidental and marginal. On the other hand, the issue of territorial divisions (nations, regions, borders), described by historians (or historical geographers) as “historical and political landscapes”, was discussed by both geographies since the very beginning. The main difference between the two – geo- -political and geo-historical – approaches was the temporal perspective they assumed. While the present was most important for political geography, historical geography was more concerned with “former territorial divisions” (thus the term “historical and political landscapes” is apt). Each of the disciplines also treated the research subject differently. Political geography considered “the area described by borders and characterised by some organisation, i. e. above all a state” or region as central, while historical geography acknowledged its importance as one of many elements, apart from the transformed (cultural) environment, settlement, elementary disasters, formed communication network, the history of geographical horizons, toponymy and historical cartography, while referring it, as mentioned earlier, the reconstructed image of the past. With the development of the methodological foundations of both sciences, the belief that “what is today includes what was yesterday, so in order to understand the presence, we have to study the past” grew. This reflection was aided by the deepening relations between historical geography and <b>anthropogeography,</b> which influenced not only the expansion of tasks of the former, but also lead to the inclusion of the “historical element” in the scope of geo-political discussion. Reaching into the past to reveal spatial differences and similarities of a political nature, more and more boldly practised by political geography, was also caused by the references to human history (human “fate”) construed in the spirit of mechanistic determinism, as well as the changes in the political map of the world at the break of 19 th and 20 th centuries. As their eyewitness, political geography could not close itself in a narrow, quickly dating formula of the present. The explanation of interrelations between political entities and their physical-geographical surrounding attempted at the time required constant references to the historical context. The contemporary political map was quickly becoming, if we can paraphrase Barbag, a strictly historical map. The practice of reaching into the past to interpret contemporary phenomena and political systems caused the historical context to become an immanent element of political geography. The discipline was becoming more and more bold in interpreting the political map and the territorial characteristics of political formation and development of states and regions, not only in the presence, but also in the future. This research field saw the formation – in reference to the bond between history and geography – of a unique relationship between historical geography and political geography. Significantly, by exposing the past, political geography sometimes lost view of the presence, i. e. the element that defined its existence and distinguished it from historical geography. Thus, we can say that M. Kulesza (2009) was right when he observed, as mentioned above, that the development of political geography after World War II and, especially in the 1990 s, resulted in the “internal” expansion and the emergence of new research fields, which was caused by, among other things, taking some of them from historical geography.

40|$|Abanoz Plateau {{is located}} in 36 o 18 ’ north {{latitude}} and 32 o 56 ’ east longitude on Taşeli plateau in the borders of ÇukurabanozVillage connected to Anamur district of Mersin city. The plateau was set on a polje that is surrounded by the contour line of 1450 m. on the 52 nd km. of Anamur-Ermenek highway. The {{aim of this study}} is to contribute to its presentation by determining geographical elements that are efficient for thesettlement and improvement of Abanoz Plateau. In the preparation of the study firstly in the different times of the year (2008 July, 2008 December) land studies and required negotiations were performed. In the meantime, both ÇukurabanozHeadmanship’s and some official institutions’ data were followed up. Then the land data obtained in the plateau (photograph,statistical information and negotiation notes) and gathered statistical data were commented and the plateau was evaluated in termsof accommodation geography. At the end of the study, some advices and results were tried to be set forted about the plateauaccommodation. Transhumance in Anamur is a significant activity. Transhumants that use Anamur beaches as winter quarters in winter,migrates to plateaus that have various altitudes being on Taşeli Plateau as from April. There are 37 small and large plateausettlements belonging to district centre and villages in Taşeli Plateau. The most important plateaus of these are: Kaş, Abanoz,Akpınar, Kaysan, Çandır, Çamurlu, Barçın, Elbalak, Halkalı, Sanova, Kırkkuyu. The improvements in socio-economic structuresof people living in Anamur and Anamur villages have changed the transhumance based on husbandry in a big deal. Instead ofthat, countryside transhumance has come into prominence in order to get rid of hot and moist air. After all, plateaus in whichtranshumance are being performed are available. The most developed caduceus countryside settlement in Anamur is Abanoz Plateau. Geographical elements have gotsignificant roles on the establishments and developments of this plateau. In terms of physical geography, the plateau reflects thefeatures of Taşeli Plateau character. Because in Taşeli Plateau, Miocene limestone that is horizontally stratified and eligible to melt,is common. A number of karstic melting and deposition patterns developed on these limestones. One of the karstic meltingpatterns, Abanoz polje has been the most important factor enabling the emplacement of the plateau. Since the plateau is in high place comparing with coastal zone in Mediterranean climate (1450 m.) becomes an auspicioushabitat in terms of climate conditions in summer. When the distribution of climate data is taken into account according to seasonsand months, in the plateau around Mediterranean mountain climate is seen that is hot, dry in summer and rainy, harsh climate Depressive air conditions of which moisture gradient is extremely high affect human life negatively. That reason comprises asignificant effect in moving plateaus of people in summer months. And this shows us the effect of physical geographical elementsin improvement of transhumance that is the one of <b>anthropogeography</b> elements. Yoruks who settled around Anamur in Seljuk Period, continued transhumance through long ages that is based on husbandryas a continuance of Middle East migration culture. However, improving of life conditions of the public in aspect of socioeconomyalso affected transhumance activity. Because the public getting along with nomadic livestock, inclined to agriculturebased on greenhousing. As a result of this, leisure and recreation activities became widespread. In the mean time we performed land studies in Abanoz Plateau, making the amount of population is hard due to the fact thatthere is no regular enumeration. However, according to both Çukurabanoz Headmanship and the numbers of electric and watersubscribers, 7500 people were determined involving in the activity of transhumance in 2008 transhumance period. Thepopulation in the plateau starts coming beginning from April and becomes the highest level in July and August. In the plateau, local services that are necessary to be in a settlement are available. In the period of transhumance, social andcommercial services like health centre, mosque, grocery store, restaurant, bake house, butcher, coffee houses that can fulfil theneeds are available. There has been no important substructure problem like electric supply, transportation, water supply,telephoning. However, there can be some water cuts when population level is high in summer months (July, August) While traditional houses that are suitable for nature conditions were common in Abanoz Plateau in the past, today concretetype houses (two-three storey in patches) that do not reflect natural beauty of the plateau are being built. In these buildings,manufacturing-produced construction material (like cement, brick, iron and lime) is used mostly. Ponding that is made by doline’snot being able to debark the upward water in winter months that evacuates water, is built on concrete poles in order not todamage the houses are polje base. Economic activity areas of people going up to the plateau in Abanoz, are mostly in the permanent settlements. For thatreason, economic activity is not common in the plateau. However, economic activities of which gaining are not so much high likecommercial shops, husbandry, agriculture and apiculture that fulfil the needs of transhumants. In 2008 transhumance season, ascommercial workplaces, 6 grocery stores, 6 bake houses, 3 restaurants, 3 butchers, 4 coffee houses offered services. Most of thecommercial workings in the plateau are food premises. This is because the population predominantly consists of consumingpeople like retired, student, worker and officer. Transhumants fulfil their needs from plateau bazaar that is set every Wednesday. In husbandry which is an old economic activity in plateau, mostly hair goat raising is in the foreground. However, thedecadence of the husbandry value every passing day decreased the number of families dealing with husbandry. In the study weperformed in the plateau in 2008 summer, 1700 hair goats, 120 sheeps, 30 dairy cattles were ascertained. Products like meat, milk,cheese, butter, skim-milk cheese are taken from animals. The plateau where the altitude is high and grass variety is excessive,apiculture is also performed and honey obtained from this production is famous named Abanoz plateau honey. Around Abanoz plateau, as agricultural crops; especially wheat, tomato, onion, cucumber, paprika, bean and some field cropslike apple, pear, greengage, grape are grown up. These crops are for their own needs and have unimportant commercial value. While weaving was an important activity in the past in the plateau, today it is mostly abandoned. Within these traditionalweaving products, yoruk rugs, saddlebags, hairy sackings, gunny bags, salt bags are the most conspicuous. The alternation of the Abanoz plateau from transhumance function based on husbandry to the transhumance aiming leisureand recreation has brought along some changes and troubles. Especially; 1 - The most remarkable feature of the plateau is administrational problem. Because Abanoz that absorbs population intranshumance season is administrated by Headmanship that is rudimentary in aspect of functioning. Therefore, Headmanshipremains incapable of fulfilling the services of the plateau. 2 - Especially for weaving, some hand crafts and life culture as nomadic transhumance based on husbandry caused largely tobe abandoned. 3 - In the plateau, accessibility, compliance of substructure services caused population increasing. And gradually increasingpopulation has brought along problems like irregular settlements, the lack of potable water and environmental pollution. 4 - In the past traditional houses that are compatible with nature were abandoned in the plateau and today concretereinforced buildings that are high-rise and do not reflect environment beauty become widespread. This situation is going toconvert the plateau into a city scene that is out of its function. 5 - In the plateau, there is no accommodation places (except for forestry department guesthouse) in which outer guests canstay. 6 - The reawakening of the plateau in tourism with completing tourism substructure by determining cultural, natural,historical values must be aimed. I am of opinion that the expanding to tourism of the plateau will contribute to both Turkey andregion econom...|$|E
