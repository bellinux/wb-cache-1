40|$|Abstract: Fruits {{of banana}} cv. Grand Naine bunches were {{harvested}} at mature stage {{and subjected to}} different post-harvest treatments. Treated fruits were stored in CFB boxes for ripening at room temperature (mean maximum temperature 28. 650 C and minimum temperature 25. 240 C, RH 79 - 89 %). Ethrel treated fruits ripened in 4 days with excellent quality attributes, whereas control (untreated) fruits ripened in 10 days. Degradation of green colour was noticed in banana fruits with the <b>advancement</b> <b>of</b> <b>ripening</b> period of 10 days. Total sugars increased as the ripening duration progressed (1. 22 % to 24. 05 %). The mean starch content decreased (21. 52 % to 2. 53 %) gradually in banana fruits as the ripening advanced. Sensory quality characteristics with respect to taste and flavor (up to 9. 50 on 6 th day) and overall acceptability increased (up to 9. 25 on 4 th day) up to certain stage depending upon treatment and thereafter decreased during 10 days of ripening, whereas the firmness decreased (9. 00 to 4. 83) as the ripening duration progressed in all the treatments...|$|E
40|$|The {{study was}} carried out to {{undertake}} the effect of different stages of maturity and ripening conditions on the physical characteristics of tomato fruit {{during the process of}} ripening. Fruit of three maturity stages viz., mature green, half ripen and full ripen were kept under three ripening conditions viz., floor without covering(control), covering with straw and CaC 2 + straw covering. Data were taken on color development of fruit, firmness of tissue, decay or rotting percentage, weight loss percentage and Shelf life of tomato. Different maturity stages, ripening conditions and their combination showed highly significant variation in different physical characteristics of tomato were studied. The highest value of decay or rotting was shown by full ripen tomatoes. However, the highest weight loss and shelf life were found by mature green tomatoes. The percentage of decay or rotting and weight loss was increased with gradual advancement of time.

40|$|UMR AGAP - équipe DAAV (Diversité, {{adaptation}} et amélioration de la vigne) The {{timing of}} grape picking {{is a critical}} point for to production of high quality wines. Berry growth and major solutes are routinely measured on a mix of randomly sampled berries, in order to characterize the <b>advancement</b> <b>of</b> <b>ripening</b> at the vineyard scale, and optimize the date of harvest {{with respect to the}} specific conditions of the millesime. Most if not all knowledge on grape berry metabolism emerged from this procedure. Since berries do not ripen simultaneously, averaging induces a statistical bias leading tounderestimation of water, sugars and organic acids fluxes in individual berries. Moreover, detachment of fruits not only blocks sugar import whose speed, even underestimated, largely exceeds the measured variable, but also reverses the direction of vacuolar transport. The influence of temperature {{on the nature of the}} respiratory substrate and on global carbon balance needs to be revisited because of these two possible artefacts. This preliminary study aims at evaluating the heterogeneity of developing berries and to decipher the relations between growth, sugar storage, and malate breakdown, at the cluster and berry levels, rather than on the average population. The scattering of sugars and malic acid concentrations shows that heterogeneity among berries is maximal at veraison. Berry volume shows considerable variationwithin and between clusters and doubles during the first period of sugar accumulation, while malate disappears. Sugar accumulation then continues at a constant volume (rate?), and its concentration tends to homogenize during this process, whilemalate content is maintained at a very low value. Finally, phloem unloading completely stops and sugars concentrate as the result of shriveling, malate being totally exhausted at this stage. Preliminary results on respiration show that stopping phloem unloading would increase the O 2 demand by 25 %...|$|E

The effects of four concentrations of hydrogen cyanamide (0. 0 as control, 2. 0, 3. 5 and 5. 0 %) and three times of application were tested on 'Burlat' and 'Ferrovia'. In 2002, the best results were obtained by early treatments (57 and 50 days before natural bloom of 'Burlat' and 'Ferrovia', respectively) with all concentrations. The maximum <b>advancement</b> <b>of</b> bloom was 11 to 13 days in 'Burlat' and 7 to 9 days in 'Ferrovia'.

40|$|Niagara Peninsula of Ontario is {{the largest}} viticultural area in Canada. Although it is {{considered}} to be a cool and wet region, in the last decade many water stress events occurred during the growing seasons with negative effects on grape and wine quality. This study was initiated to understand and develop the best strategies for water management in vineyards and those that might contribute to grape maturity advancement. The irrigation trials investigated the impact of time of initiation (fruit set, lag phase and veraison), water replacement level based on theoretical loss through crop evapotranspiration (ETc; 100, 50 and 25 %) and different irrigation strategies [partial root zone drying (PRD) versus regulated deficit irrigation (RD!) ] on grape composition and wine sensory profiles. The irrigation experiments were conducted in a commercial vineyard (Lambert Vineyards Inc.) located in Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario, from 2005 through 2009. The two experiments that tested the combination of different water regimes and irrigation time initiation were set up in a randomized block design as follows: Baco noir - three replicates x 10 treatments [(25 %, 50 % and 100 % of ETc) x (initiation at fruit set, lag phase and veraison) + control]; Chardonnay - three replicates x seven treatments [(25 %, 50 % and 100 % of ETc) x (initiation at fruit set and veraison) + control]. The experiments that tested different irrigation strategies were set up on two cultivars as follows: Sauvignon blanc - four replicates x four treatments [control, fully irrigated (100 % ETc), PRD (100 % ETc) and RDI (25 % ETc) ]; Cabemet Sauvignon - four replicates x five treatments [control, fully irrigated (100 % ETc), PRD (100 % ETc), RDI (50 % ETc) and RDI (25 % ETc) ]. The controls in each experiment were nonirrigated. The irrigation treatments were compared for many variables related to soil water status, vine physiology, berry composition, wine sensory profile, and hormone composition [(abscisic acid (ABA) and its catabolites]. Soil moisture profile was mostly affected by irrigation treatments between 20 and 60 em depth depending on the grapevine cultivar and the regime of water applied. Overall soil moisture was consistently higher throughout the season in 100 and 50 % ETc compare to the control. Transpiration rates and leaf temperature as well as shoot growth rate were the most sensitive variables to soil water status. Drip irrigation associated with RDI treatments (50 % ETc and 25 % ETc) had the most beneficial effects on vine physiology, fruit composition and wine varietal typicity, mainly by maintaining a balance between vegetative and reproductive parts of the vine. Neither the control nor the 100 ETc had overall a positive effect on grape composition and wine sensory typicity. The time of irrigation initiation affected the vine physiology and grape quality, the most positive effect was found in treatments initiated at lag phase and veraison. RDI treatments were overall more consistent in their positive effect on grape composition and wine varietal typicity comparing to PRD treatment. The greatest difference between non-irrigated and irrigated vines in most of the variables studied was found in 2007, the driest and hottest season of the experimental period. Soil water status had a greater and more consistent effect on red grapevine cultivars rather than on white winegrape cultivars. To understand the relationships among soil and plant water status, plant physiology and the hormonal profiles associated with it, abscisic acid (ABA) and its catabolites [phaseic acid (PA), dihydrophaseic acid (DPA), 7 -hydroxy-ABA (TOH-ABA), 8 ' -hydroxy-ABA, neophaseic acid and abscisic acid glucose ester (ABA-GE) ] were analyzed in leaves and berries from the Baco noir and Chardonnay irrigation trials over two growing seasons. ABA and some of its catabolites accurately described the water status in the vines. Endogenous ABA and some of its catabolites were strongly affected in Baco noir and Chardonnay by both the water regime (i. e. ET level) and timing of irrigation initiation. Chardonnay grapevines produced less ABA in both leaves and berries compared to Baco noir, which indicated that ABA synthesis is also cultivar dependant. ABA-GE was the main catabolite in treatments with high water deficits, while PA and DPA were higher in treatments with high water status, suggesting that the vine produced more ABA-GE under water deficits to maintain rapid control of the stomata. These differences between irrigation treatments with respect to ABA and catabolites were particularly noticeable in the dry 2007 season. Two trials using exogenous ABA investigated the effect of different concentrations of ABA and organs targeted for spraying, on grape maturation and berry composition of Cabemet Sauvignon grapevines, in two cool and wet seasons (2008 - 2009). The fIrst experiment consisted of three replicates x three treatments [(150 and 300 mg/L, both applications only on clusters) + untreated control] while the second experiment consisted in three replicates x four treatments [(full canopy, only clusters, and only leaves sprayed with 300 ppm ABA) + untreated control]. Exogenous ABA was effective in hastening veraison, and improving the composition of Cabemet Sauvignon. Ability of ABA to control the timing of grape berry maturation was dependant on both solution concentration and the target organ. ABA affected not only fruit composition but also yield components. Berries treated with ABA had lower weight and higher skin dry mass, which constitutes qualitative aspects desired in the wine grapes. Temporal <b>advancement</b> <b>of</b> <b>ripening</b> through hormonal control can lead to earlier fruit maturation, which is a distinct advantage in cooler areas or areas with a high risk of early frost occurrence. Exogenous ABA could provide considerable benefits to wine industry in terms of grape composition, wine style and schedule activities in the winery, particularly in wet and cool years. These trials provide the ftrst comprehensive data in eastern North America on the response of important hybrid and Vitis vinifera winegrape cultivars to irrigation management. Results from this study additionally might be a forward step in understanding the ABA metabolism, and its relationship with water status. Future research should be focused on ftnding the ABA threshold required to trigger the ripening process, and how this process could be controlled in cool climates...|$|E

In this research {{it was assumed}} that applied milk thermal treatment, as well as curd processing, will have appropriate influence on proteins as substratum. During ripening, due to a presence of whey proteins, which influence decrease of casein content in total cheese proteins, substratum is hydrolyzed. In traditionally made cheeses, casein is the basis of protein matrix. In comparison to whey proteins, casein is substantially faster changed during ripening, while whey proteins incorporated in the curd give so called «unspecific» <b>ripening.</b> Besides, application <b>of</b> high temperatures influences decrease of plasmin activity in cheese, regardless of its significant thermal stability.

The most intensive primary products formation occurred in the first 15 days <b>of</b> <b>ripening.</b> Compared to the literature, experimental cheeses were similar to traditionally made cheeses in the Edam type, and even to cheeses with longer ripening period such as Cheddar, regarding ripening «depth» and «width». Compounds soluble in 12 % TCA and 5 % PTA can be significant parameters of proteolytic processes dynamics during cheese ripening. Also, they can describe ripening «width», and especially «depth» <b>of</b> <b>ripening.</b> Nitrogen content soluble in 12 % TCA increased during ripening. After 120 days <b>of</b> <b>ripening,</b> nitrogen content soluble in 12 % TCA was 19. 58 times higher compared to the first day <b>of</b> <b>ripening.</b> Nitrogen matter soluble in 5 % PTA, with molecule masses less than 600, also had permanent rising trend. Average values of nitrogen content soluble in 5 % PTA during ripening period from 1 to 120 days were: 12. 98 mg %, 33. 23 mg %, 53. 87 mg %, 92. 28 mg % and 148. 32 mg %. At the end <b>of</b> <b>ripening</b> period nitrogen content soluble in 5 % PTA was 11. 43 times higher compared to the first day <b>of</b> <b>ripening.</b> Generally, it could be concluded that protein changes were very intensive during investigated ripening period.

40|$|The {{formation}} of volatile compounds in Turkish Divle Cave cheese produced in 3 different dairy farms was determined during production and ripening, revealing 110 compounds including acids, alcohols, ketones, esters, and terpenes. The presence and concentration of these volatile compounds varied between specific {{phases of the}} production and the 120 -d ripening process. Smaller differences were also detected between cheeses produced at different farms. Carboxylic acids were established as a major class at the end <b>of</b> <b>ripening.</b> The relative amounts of acids and ketones increased until d 90 <b>of</b> <b>ripening,</b> whereas alcohols increased for the first 30 d and tailed off during the remaining part <b>of</b> the <b>ripening</b> process.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of the addition of commercial lipase in various forms on the acceleration <b>of</b> the <b>ripening</b> <b>of</b> UF-Feta cheese. Commercial lipase from Aspergillus niger was encapsulated by using silica composition based on Sol-Gel method. Lipase was then added to cheeses in three forms, namely, free lipase, encapsulated lipase, and encapsulated lipase with Arabic gum. Lipase was added to the retentate in the ratio of 4 g: 100 kg. The effects of free lipase, encapsulated lipase, and encapsulated lipase with Arabic gum on lipolysis, quantity of free water, bounded water, and chemical compounds were studied during the 60 days <b>of</b> <b>ripening.</b> Based on FTIR analysis, encapsulated lipases were completely released from the capsules during the first 15 days <b>of</b> <b>ripening</b> period. The greatest amount of lipolysis was detected in free lipase samples, compared to encapsulated and encapsulated with Arabic gum treatments. Thermal analysis of all treatments indicated that lipolysis could affect the free and bounded water content by decreasing both of them from the 15 th to 60 th days <b>of</b> <b>ripening.</b> The amount <b>of</b> salt, moisture, and fat changed during the first 15 days <b>of</b> <b>ripening</b> significantly (P< 0. 05).

40|$|The main {{fermented}} {{meat products}} are fermented sausages in which {{lactic acid bacteria}} (LAB) are the essential agents <b>of</b> the <b>ripening</b> process. Their application as starter organisms ensures {{the dominance of the}} starter during the whole ripening process. However, when no starter cultures are used, direct addition of acids like a glucono-delta-lactone (GdL) is preferred. The goal {{of this study was to}} determine the influence of commercial spices mixtur (containing GdL) on selected technological parameters of fermented dry-cured sausages - Danube sausage in comparison with currently available conventional spices. Comparison was evaluated also with addition of starter cultures. Determinations of technological (value of pH, water activity, color) and microbiological properties (count of Lactobacillus spp., Enterobacteriaceae family, yeasts and moulds) were realized after 24 hours, 5 and 30 days. The sensory analysis of sausages was carried out after 30 days <b>of</b> <b>ripening</b> process. In sausages with the addition of commercial spice mixture in combination with starter culture were determined the lowest values of pH and a w at the end <b>of</b> <b>ripening</b> process (30 days). Bacteria of Enterobacteriaceae family were occurred in the samples with the addition of currently available conventional spices at the beginning <b>of</b> <b>ripening,</b> but after 5 days <b>of</b> <b>ripening</b> were bacteria <b>of</b> this family not detected. The counts of yeasts in analyzed samples were not detected. Counts of LAB at the end <b>of</b> <b>ripening</b> proccess (30 days) were lower in coparison with result obtained after 5 days; however their count was comparable with count determined at the beginig <b>of</b> the <b>ripening.</b> Our results show, that the combination of starter culture and commercial spice mixture containig GdL may cause excesive sour taste and sensory defect of dry fermented meat products. <!
