5|$|Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca secretes {{large amounts}} of oxalic acid—a {{reducing}} agent and relatively strong acid—into the soil around its woody substrate. This chemical stimulates weathering of the humus layer of forest soil, as the organic matter in soil breaks down into smaller molecules. This influences the solubility and turnover of nutrients (particularly phosphorus and nitrogen), which in turn <b>affects</b> <b>their</b> availability for use by forest trees.|$|E

5|$|The main themes {{expressed}} in the collection include how an individual's worldview (Weltanschauung) <b>affects</b> <b>their</b> actions and the attitudes of those around them, the philosophy of social determinism, and why a lack of personal responsibility for one's actions results from an individual's beliefs in determinism. The writing style that Dalrymple explains these in was praised by reviewers for its clear, witty prose and for going immediately to the truth and heart of any matter that is being discussed.|$|E

The Malkavians have separate dialog options, reflecting their inherent insanity. Upgrading some skills provides additional dialog options; attractive and charismatic characters seduce to get their way, aggressive characters threaten, and others persuade their targets to cooperate.|$|E

5|$|The travel {{journal of}} the Dutch ship Gelderland (1601–1603), rediscovered in the 1860s, {{contains}} the only known sketches of living or recently killed specimens drawn on Mauritius.

Apart from these sketches, it is unknown how many of the twenty or so 17th-century illustrations of the dodos were drawn from life or from stuffed specimens, which <b>affects</b> <b>their</b> reliability.|$|E
5|$|Each unit is {{assigned}} a character class, while <b>affects</b> <b>their</b> assigned weapon, strengths and weaknesses, and range {{and speed of}} movement on the battlefield. These classes range from axemen and swordsmen to thieves, to mounted units and magic users such as healers. Some characters, such as main protagonist Leif, have unique classes. Classes also naturally evolve {{during the course of}} the story. Mounted units have the option of dismounting their steeds to fight on-foot. Weapons within a unit's selected character class can be freely swapped out for more powerful versions: when mounted units dismount, they swap spears for axes or swords. Weapon effectiveness is governed by the Weapons Triangle: swords are strong against axes, axes against spears, and spears against swords.|$|E
30|$|Moreover, the {{behaviour}} related {{studies reported}} above do not clarify {{the reasons that}} relate the online user’s habits to the phishing victimisation.

5|$|Neurocognitive {{symptoms}}, such as fatigue, mood disturbances, {{and other}} related symptoms are common sequelae. Even in those who have made good neurological recovery, anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and cognitive impairment are common; 46 {{percent of people who}} have had a subarachnoid hemorrhage have cognitive impairment that <b>affects</b> <b>their</b> quality of life. Over 60 percent report frequent headaches. Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage may lead to damage of the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland, two areas of the brain that {{play a central role in}} hormonal regulation and production. More than a quarter of people with a previous SAH may develop hypopituitarism (deficiencies in one or more of the hypothalamic-pituitary hormones such as growth hormone, luteinizing hormone, or follicle-stimulating hormone).|$|E
5|$|Battles {{take place}} on a grid-based map, with the battle system {{employing}} a turn-based system for the player, enemy units and allied units. The movement and attack ranges of enemies can be optionally displayed to players. While seventy-four units are accessible in-game by completing its chapters, only twelve can be taken into battle at any one time. When two units engage, a separate battle screen activates, and the battle plays out automatically. Enemy resistances to weapons are covered by the Weapon Triangle: lances are strong against swords, swords are strong against axes, and axes are strong against lances. Each unit gains experience points with each action, and when they accumulate 100 points, they level up and their stats are randomly raised. Each unit has a class, which <b>affects</b> <b>their</b> weaponry and movement range: these classes, when at level 10, can be promoted to a stronger class using a Master Seal item.|$|E
5|$|Battles use a turn-based battle system, {{with the}} player, enemies, and {{sometimes}} non-playable characters each taking turns and moving across a grid-based battlefield: battles are {{won by the}} player defeating all enemies in a map or killing a boss character. Enemies include human troops and monsters. The players are given {{a limited number of}} units, which are each assigned unique character classes that have various functions in battle, such as being mounted or having access to magic. A unit's class also <b>affects</b> <b>their</b> range of movement on the battlefield. In contrast to the previous game, character classes are not set but can switch once a character reaches a certain level. A special example of class promotion is the two main characters: Alm can promote from a Fighter to a Hero, while Celica promotes from a Priestess to a Princess. Each time a unit raises its experience level, its various stats increase based on a percent chance unique for each character. Spells for magical classes are learned through leveling up rather than being part of a separate system, and each spell consumes part of the caster's health when used.|$|E

5|$|Defending a {{breeding}} territory is fairly common among male dragonflies, especially among species that congregate around ponds in large numbers. The territory contains desirable {{features such as}} a sunlit stretch of shallow water, a special plant species, or a particular substrate necessary for egg-laying. The territory may be small or large, depending on its quality, the time of day, {{and the number of}} competitors, and may be held for a few minutes or several hours. Some dragonflies signal ownership with striking colours on the face, abdomen, legs, or wings. The common whitetail (Plathemis lydia) dashes towards an intruder holding its white abdomen aloft like a flag. Other dragonflies engage in aerial dogfights or high-speed chases. A female must mate with the territory holder before laying her eggs. There is also conflict between the males and females. Females may sometimes be harassed by males {{to the extent that it}} <b>affects</b> <b>their</b> normal activities including foraging and in some dimorphic species females have evolved multiple forms with some forms appearing deceptively like males. In some species females have evolved behavioural responses such as feigning death to escape the attention of males.|$|E
5|$|Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light is a {{tactical}} role-playing game where players {{take on the}} role of Marth and his growing army during their campaign across the continent of Archanea. The game progresses in a linear fashion, with maps being unlocked and played as dictated by the storyline. Each playable character is assigned a unique character classes that have various functions in battle, such as being mounted or having access to magic. A unit's class <b>affects</b> <b>their</b> range of movement and strength on the battlefield; mounted or flying units have greater mobility, archers have a greater attack range, while heavily armored characters have more damage resistance. Each character has a set character class, and each time a unit raises its experience level, its various stats increase randomly. There are a total of 25 characters that can be recruited {{over the course of the}} game, and 21 available classes for the majority of characters, with the exception of main protagonist Marth.|$|E
5|$|In Fallout Shelter, players {{build and}} {{manage their own}} Vault as an Overseer – the leader and {{coordinator}} of their Vault. Players guide and direct {{the citizens of the}} Vault, and need to keep them happy through meeting their needs such as power, food, and water. They rescue dwellers from the wasteland and assign them to different resource-generating buildings in the Vault, using the SPECIAL statistics system from the other Fallout games. Each character's SPECIAL profile <b>affects</b> <b>their</b> ability to generate different resources, and their statistics can be increased by training them in rooms devoted to each stat. The dwellers can level up over time, increasing their health, and can be given new items and weapons to help with various tasks. The number of dwellers can be increased by waiting for new dwellers from the wasteland to arrive or by pairing a male and a female dweller in living quarters to produce babies.|$|E
