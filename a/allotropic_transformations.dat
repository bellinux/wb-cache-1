40|$|Additive Manufacturing (AM) is a {{valid and}} {{economically}} viable technique to produce fully functional, geometrically complex parts. One such AM technique, Selective Laser Melting (SLM), uses a high power laser to selectively melt layers of metal powder. Selective Laser Melting {{can be compared to}} a repetitive welding process, stacking thousands of welds next to and {{on top of each other}} to produce a 3 D geometry. The difference lies in the fact that the purpose of welds is to join two or more separate geometries into one, while in SLM, the welds itself are the geometry. Moreover, the process takes place on a much finer scale compared to commercial welding processes, with melt pool dimensions in the order of 0. 1 mm³. The localized melt pool and its heat affected zone are small compared to the thermal heat sink effect of the base plate and previously consolidated layers, creating extremely large and directional thermal gradients. In turn, these gradients lead to the buildup of residual stresses which have an effect on the mechanical performance and cause deformation, as well as micro- and macrocracks. Stress is built up locally by the thermal shrinkage of the solidified melt pool, and is larger in the direction of a scan track than perpendicular to it. The shrinkage is impeded in the horizontal direction by the solid material below, causing horizontal tensile stresses at the top surface of SLM produced parts. These horizontal stresses exert a pulling force which would cause the part to curl up if it were not anchored to the base plate. Because the part is anchored, curl up is avoided but vertical tensile stresses are introduced at the side surfaces. Compressive stress in all directions exists in the center of the part. Different possibilities to induce lower residual stresses were explored in this work, at various stages throughout the SLM process chain. The effects of thermal and other material properties are difficult to isolate from the influence of process parameters during the process, or material specific problems such as ductile to brittle transitions, solidification cracking, and low temperature <b>allotropic</b> <b>transformations.</b> Overall, using process parameters that increase the heat input reduces macroscopic residual stresses. This includes using thin layers, slow scan speeds, high laser powers and most importantly, base plate preheating. In addition, modified alloy compositions introduce benefits of tailored mechanical properties and, to a certain extent, a tailored microstructure. Finally, the impact of residual stress on the mechanical behavior was highlighted by the overlap of 2 D maps of the residual stress with the observed crack growth behavior of Ti 6 Al 4 V compact tension specimens produced by SLM. Base plate preheating, as well as tailored alloy compositions may provide the largest gains. Combining all the favorable procedures described in this work will lower residual stresses, which enables production of bigger parts or processing of new materials. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|In the {{practice}} of solid state chemistry, structural phase transitions are fairly common events. Nonetheless, their understanding, in terms of both: A rationalization of the observed changes in symmetry pattern and; An understanding of the mechanisms allowing for a particular transformation, are outstanding problems. The thermodynamic classification of phase transitions distinguishes between first and second order transitions, {{on the basis of}} the discontinuous behavior of quantities related to first or second derivatives of the free energy, respectively. Small atomic displacements are typically associated with second order phase transitions, and latent heat changes amount to a few calories per gram only. Additionally, the symmetries of the phases surrounding the transition are typically in the relation of a group and a subgroup. Reconstructive phase transitions, on the contrary, involve breaking of (large) parts of the bond scaffolding of the initial structure, and exhibit drastic changes at the transition point, with large latent heat and hysteresis effects. The corresponding atomic displacements can be in the order of the lattice parameters, and no group-subgroup is found, between the symmetry of the phases. These type of transitions have generally a strong first-order character. Landau theory accounts for continuous, second-order phase transitions. As a phenomenological theory, it does not establish the existence of a phase transition, which remains an experimental fact. It only bridges microscopic characteristics, like space-group symmetries and structural changes, or phonon softening effects, with measurable macroscopic quantities. Therein, distortions are carried by an order parameter, which fully specifies the form of the analytical variational free energy. The latter is continuous and derivable with respect to temperature, pressure and atomic displacement, at the transition point. First order, non-continuous phase transitions are still within the scope of Landau theory in the mentioned special case of the existence of a group-to-(isotropic) subgroup relationship. In the majority of cases, however, and for the most interesting phase transitions (for basic and applied research), such a relationship is missing, making the choice of an order parameter less straightforward. Most of the <b>allotropic</b> <b>transformations</b> of the elements, many intermetallic systems, and numerous insulating systems belongs to this class. This class also includes most interesting and fundamental electronic effects, like metallization in perovskites or spinel oxides for example. This very simple fact of a missing symmetry condition has helped reinforcing the opinion of first-order phase transitions being a world apart, and possibly contributed to discouraging a firm theory to develop, able to account for their transformation mechanisms and the change of physical properties across phase transition. The thermodynamic distinction between first and second order phase transitions is too narrow, as, in case of first order phase transitions, it embraces both weakly discontinuous transition and reconstructive ones, where bonds are being strongly modified. Especially, a mean to qualify the distance between two structures (geometric, with respect to symmetry, a. s. o.), is missing. Clearly, a group-subgroup relationship may, and typically does imply shortest shifting distances, as a tiny atomic displacement can already do for a symmetry lowering. Naively, missing such a relation means no constraints, and apparently no means to conclude at a connection of two structures in general, let alone a full mechanistic analysis. First order phase transitions proceed by nucleation and subsequent growth of the new phase from the initial one. Different from (second-order) continuous phase transitions, they do imply coexistence of the transforming motifs. The discontinuity in some order parameter between the two phases is driven by lowering of the free energy as the new phase forms. However, close to the transition, the original phase remains metastable, and a fluctuation is needed to cause the formation of the new phase to set in. Such a process responds to thermal changes, and depending on the height of the nucleation barrier, its rate may be slower or faster. In the former case, large deviations from equilibrium may be required to achieve transformation to the stable phase, which means that large hysteresis effects will be observed in the course of transformation. The intent of this work consists in giving a face to the intermediate configurations appearing in first order phase transitions, in solid-solid reconstructive processes. Apart of a mechanistic elucidation, consisting in answering the question “Which atomic displacements bring structural motif A into structural motif B ?”, another purpose of this work is a rather pedagogical one, that is, showing that first-order phase transitions can be understood in detail, not only in principle but in fact. The core of the examples illustrated in this work is concerned with phase transformations where pressure represents the thermodynamic controlling parameter. Pressure is extensively used in chemical synthesis, as a mean to achieve novel properties, optical or mechanical just to mention a few. Additionally, reports on novel high-pressure polymorphs are regularly appearing. In this sense, pressure is a relevant parameter for approaching fundamental questions in solid state chemistry...|$|E

Excellent welds were produced which were shown to be responsive to post weld heat treatments which substantially improved joint strength. Prior to welding the rotors, test specimens of complex geometry were welded to demonstrate that complex surfaces with intentional mechanical misfit could be readily joined using HIP welding. This preliminary work demonstrated not only that interface compliance is achieved during welding but that welding pressure is developed in these thick sections sufficient to produce sound joints. Integral weld-heat treatment cycles {{were developed}} that permitted the attainment of magnetic properties while minimizing residual stress associated with the <b>allotropic</b> <b>transformation</b> of 4340 steel...|$|R
40|$|The cold curves {{for energy}} and {{pressure}} of Copper, Iron, and Tantalum were obtained using {{methods of the}} density functional theory. We consider hydrostatic and uniaxial deformations {{in the range from}} double compression of the initial volume per atom to double stretching. The presence of <b>allotropic</b> <b>transformation</b> from α - phase of Iron to the hexaferrum with the growth of pressure is observed. In the case of hydrostatic deformations we also have obtained analogous cold curves, but with non-zero electronic temperatures in the range up to 5 eV. The similar volume and electronic temperature ranges have been considered recently. The behavior of electronic internal energy, pressure, and density of states was investigated in the volume and temperature ranges called above. The maximum hydrostatic strains and the types of lattice instabilities were theoretically predicted for the considered metals. The influence of high electronic temperature on the electronic heat conductivity and electric resistivity has been provided for d-band metals by the approach based on the solution of Boltzmann kinetic equation in τ-approximation. This data is compared with the results of quantum molecular dynamics for Gold...|$|R
