5|$|Wine was {{commonly}} {{drunk and}} was also regarded as the most prestigious and healthy choice. According to Galen's dietetics it was considered hot and dry but these qualities were moderated when wine was watered down. Unlike water or beer, which were considered cold and moist, consumption of wine in moderation (especially red wine) was, among other things, believed to aid digestion, generate good blood and brighten the mood. The quality of wine differed considerably according to vintage, the type of grape and more importantly, the number of grape pressings. The first pressing was made into the finest and most expensive wines which were reserved for the upper classes. The second and third pressings were subsequently of lower quality and alcohol content. Common folk usually {{had to settle for}} a cheap white or rosé from a second or even third pressing, meaning that it could be consumed in quite generous amounts without leading to heavy intoxication. For the poorest (or the most pious), watered-down vinegar (similar to Ancient Roman posca) would often be the only <b>available</b> <b>choice.</b>|$|E
25|$|On the Saturday 5 January 2013 {{broadcast}} of BBC 3's CD Review – Building a Library, music critic Erica Jeal in her survey recommended the 1995 recording by the London Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Colin Davis, {{as the best}} <b>available</b> <b>choice.</b>|$|E

500|$|Georgii Pobedonosets was {{originally}} {{intended as a}} version of [...] rearmed with three [...] and four [...] guns, but this changed when {{the decision was made}} to provide her with three twin 12-inch turrets rather than the barbettes used by her sisters. The turrets were significantly heavier than the barbette mountings so the armour scheme was revised in compensation. However this revised design was still deemed overweight and rejected. The Naval Ministry held a competition for a replacement, but these were rejected by the Naval Technical Committee in turn. So a modified version of Sinop, with barbettes, was chosen again as the most readily <b>available</b> <b>choice.</b> The height of her armour was lowered to reduce the overweight condition of her half-sisters. Other changes were made while building, but they came early in the process and did not seriously delay her completion past her contractual date of 13 September 1893. These changes included smaller mountings for her main guns that eliminated the sponsons needed in her sisters for the forward barbettes, the substitution of 35-calibre guns for the older 30-calibre guns and steel armor imported from Schnider et Cie of France replaced the compound armour used in her half-sisters.|$|E

50|$|Note: This was {{an unusual}} straw poll in which voter's {{preferences}} were matched against each other for five rounds, with the less popular candidate being removed at each stage. There were initially 6 <b>available</b> <b>choices,</b> which were whittled down to two, with the final result being as shown above.|$|R
50|$|The game {{is played}} with a joystick. Players {{navigate}} the Leeper icon across the menu screen to choose a minigame.

50|$|In-house {{applications}} of X-ray diffraction {{has always been}} limited to the relatively few wavelengths shown in the table above. The <b>available</b> <b>choice</b> was much needed because the combination of certain wavelengths and certain elements present in a sample can lead to strong fluorescence which increases the background in the diffraction pattern. A notorious example {{is the presence of}} iron in a sample when using copper radiation. In general elements just below the anode element in the period system need to be avoided.|$|E
50|$|Local {{numbers are}} also {{occasionally}} used, such as +1-514-AUTOBUS or STM-INFO {{to reach the}} Société de transport de Montréal, but {{are subject to the}} constraint that the first few digits are tied to a geographic location - potentially limiting the <b>available</b> <b>choices</b> based on which telephone exchanges serve a local area.|$|R
50|$|Power supply {{problems}} {{in rural areas}} of developing countries make it sensible to use the most power-efficient options.

5000|$|When {{a player}} first created {{his or her}} {{character}} in the game, {{he or she was}} given one free [...] "guest room", which they could name and decorate with items. If the player was creating their character in a real-life park, then they were given another room (one of each <b>available</b> <b>choice),</b> as a bonus. Several other kinds of rooms were also available; a player could purchase/get them in the game. Players could set some of their items to be movable by their guests, a feature added sometime in late 2007 or early 2008.|$|E
50|$|One {{reason for}} rapid model {{development}} was a felt need. Systems were being proposed (especially transit systems) where no empirical {{experience of the}} type used in diversion curves was <b>available.</b> <b>Choice</b> models permit comparison {{of more than two}} alternatives and the importance of attributes of alternatives. There was the general desire for an analysis technique that depended less on aggregate analysis and with a greater behavioral content. And there was attraction, too, because choice models have logical and behavioral roots extended back to the 1920s as well as roots in Kelvin Lancaster’s consumer behavior theory, in utility theory, and in modern statistical methods.|$|E
50|$|Rational choice theory then {{assumes that}} an {{individual}} has preferences among the <b>available</b> <b>choice</b> alternatives {{that allow them to}} state which option they prefer. These preferences are assumed to be complete (the person can always say which of two alternatives they consider preferable or that neither is preferred to the other) and transitive (if option A is preferred over option B and option B is preferred over option C, then A is preferred over C). The rational agent is assumed to take account of available information, probabilities of events, and potential costs and benefits in determining preferences, and to act consistently in choosing the self-determined best choice of action.|$|E
2500|$|Intelligent agents {{must be able}} to {{set goals}} and achieve them. They need a way to {{visualize}} the future—a representation {{of the state of the}} world and be able to make predictions about how their actions will change it—and be able to make choices that maximize the utility (or [...] "value") of <b>available</b> <b>choices.</b>|$|R
30|$|From {{the review}} {{it is clear}} that {{developing}} CPMs is not a straightforward task: there are many <b>available</b> <b>choices</b> and decisions to be made during the process without definite guidance. This explains the diversity of approaches, techniques, and model types. The paper explains how some fundamental modelling decisions affect practical aspects of modelling safety performance.|$|R
50|$|General Motors' Iron Duke I4 {{engine was}} also made {{available}} for 1980 to replace the rarely ordered VW/Audi four.

50|$|Two teams {{take on a}} {{guessing}} {{game with}} a series of unusual, unlikely and often unbelievable line-ups. The celebrity teams have to work out who in each line up has the odd skill, talent or secret. The teams are allowed to ask questions to the line up, to determine which of the number of <b>available</b> <b>choice</b> is the Odd One In. The fifth and final round features familiar faces from the previous rounds where a member of each of the previous rounds return for one last Odd One In. At the end of the games, the winning team was awarded a cash prize by multiplying scores from both teams by 5,000,000 VND.|$|E
5000|$|Garofalo's long stint on {{the final}} season of the NBC drama The West Wing (as Louise Thornton, media {{strategist}} for Jimmy Smits' character, presidential candidate Matt Santos) did not allow her to be in New York to co-host The Majority Report for several weeks; this allowed Sam to make the program his own, and she acknowledged that this had a part to play in her decision to leave. She mentioned that Seder was her favorite <b>available</b> <b>choice</b> for co-host when she was approached by Air America for the radio show; her first choice (as she said in obvious jest) was her favorite actor, the legendary Steve McQueen, who of course has been deceased for many years. Her last broadcast as co-host of The Majority Report aired on July 21, 2006.|$|E
5000|$|Other sports {{people in}} this class are {{eligible}} to compete in include sitting volleyball [...] and lawn bowls. A9 lawn bowlers can be classified as LB1 and LB2. Players have the choice to compete in sitting or standing. Sitzball, the precursor to sitting volleyball, is another <b>available</b> <b>choice</b> to play. It is open to A1 to A9 classified players along with anyone who might be classified as [...] "les autres" [...] or who have lesser amputations that would not qualify them for ISOD classification. It is not open to people with spinal cord injuries. Play is open, with no requirements as to which types of disabilities are on the court at any time.
