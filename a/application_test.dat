40|$|Web {{applications}} are dynamic and interactive, {{as compared to}} traditional <b>applications.</b> Therefore, traditional <b>testing</b> techniques and tools are not sufficient for web <b>applications</b> <b>testing.</b> This paper presents a proposed Web testing approach, in which hyperlinks of the website to be tested are automatically followed one by one to retrieve all HTML texts of its pages starting from the home page. The HTML text of each encountered page is analyzed to extract the needed information about it. Then, the collected information {{is used in the}} error checking process. The proposed approach guaranties the satisfaction of two web <b>application</b> <b>testing</b> criteria, namely page coverage criterion and hyperlink coverage criterion. The paper also describes an automated Web <b>application</b> <b>testing</b> system that has been developed to implement the proposed approach. The effectiveness of the proposed approach and the developed system in discovering several possible Web applications errors is demonstrated through a case study.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{provides}} an overview of the scope and methodology for transient relay testing. The scope of transient relay testing is divided into: a) conformance test for examining the functionality and generic performance characteristics of relays, and b) <b>application</b> <b>test</b> for analyzing the specific performance issues and trouble-shooting relay misoperations. For conformance test, the methodology including system modeling, automated generation of test scenarios, relay modeling, and implementation of automated relay testing is discussed in detail. For <b>application</b> <b>test,</b> the key issue is the selection of typical scenarios for analyzing the relay behavior in vulnerable system conditions. A view about benefits and approaches of transient based relay testing is explained in this paper. I...|$|E
