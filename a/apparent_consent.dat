2500|$|Another {{milestone}} came in 1961-62. First, in {{a symbolic}} gesture Don Javier declared Hugues [...] "duque de San Jaime", a historic title borne by Alfonso Carlos; then, he instructed {{his followers to}} perceive the prince as embodiment of [...] "a king". Hugues, styling himself as Carlos Hugo, settled in Madrid and set up his Secretariat, a personal advisory body. For {{the first time in}} history, a Carlist heir officially lived in the capital and openly pursued his own politics. From this moment onwards, Don Javier was increasingly perceived as ceding daily business to his son and merely providing general supervision from the back seat. Carlos Hugo was gradually taking control of communication channels with his father, replacing him also as a key person representing the house of Bourbon-Parma in Spain. Moreover, three daughters of Don Javier, all in their 20s, with <b>apparent</b> <b>consent</b> of their father engaged themselves in campaigns intended to enhance the standing of their brother in the Spanish public ambience; the younger son of Don Javier, Sixte, soon followed suit.|$|E
2500|$|A study {{published}} in The Scientific Review of Mental Health Practice attempted to replicate the Rind study, correcting for methodological and statistical problems identified by Dallam and others. It supported some of the Rind findings, both {{with respect to the}} percentage of variance in later psychological outcomes accounted for by sexual abuse and in relation to the finding that there was a gender difference in the experience of child sexual abuse, such that females reported more negative effects. It, however, acknowledged the limitations of the findings (college student sample, self-report data), and did not endorse Rind's recommendation to abandon {{the use of the term}} child sexual abuse in cases of <b>apparent</b> <b>consent</b> in favor of the term adult-child sex. In their conclusion, the authors address the objection that Rind's work and their own would give support to those who deny that child sexual abuse can cause harm: [...] "The authors of the current research would hesitate to support such a general statement. Instead, our results, and the results of the Rind et al. meta-analysis, can be interpreted as providing a hopeful and positive message to therapists, parents, and children. Child sexual abuse does not necessarily lead to long-term harm." ...|$|E
50|$|United States v. Andrus, {{decided on}} April 25, 2007, {{was a case}} heard in the Tenth Circuit of the United States Court of Appeals. The court held that defendant's father had the <b>apparent</b> {{authority}} to <b>consent</b> to search of defendant's computer.|$|R

5000|$|On 8 January 1847, the Queen's {{first cousin}} Prince George of Cambridge married, by licence of the Faculty Office but in {{contravention}} of this Act, Sarah Fairbrother, a pregnant actress with four illegitimate children (two {{by himself and}} two by other men), at St James, Clerkenwell. From about 1858, Fairbrother took the name Mrs FitzGeorge. The marriage was non-existent, not a morganatic marriage as many have called it. [...] It is also incorrect to say that Queen Victoria refused to consent to this marriage, as no application was made to her under the Act, it being very <b>apparent</b> that no <b>consent</b> would be given.|$|R
2500|$|Attempts of the Kingdom of Hungary {{to repay}} the debt (most notably in 1419, 1426, and 1439) failed and later the will (or ability) to pay declined. After alleged mistreatment of the towns – {{especially}} by Teodor Konstanty Lubomirski, Maria Josepha of Austria (queen consort of August III of Poland), and [...] Count Heinrich Brühl [...] – Maria Theresa of Austria decided to recover them by force. She {{took advantage of the}} Polish noble insurrections {{in the second half of}} the 18th century and occupied the towns in 1769 (with the <b>apparent</b> <b>consent</b> of the then Polish king Stanislaus II of Poland) without debt repayment. This act was confirmed by the First Partition of Poland in 1772. In 1773, the pawn was cancelled. In 1778, the 13 towns regained their privileges of 1271, the privileges were extended to the other three previously pawned towns, and this newly formed entity was named [...] "Province of 16 Szepes towns". The capital of the province was Igló, also known as Neudorf and later as Spišská Nová Ves. However, the privileges were gradually reduced and some 100 years later only religious and cultural rights remained. Finally, the province was dissolved altogether and incorporated into Szepes county in 1876.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} Federal law {{as it relates}} to consent to search {{relating}} to Fourth Amendment privacy in the practice of Digital Forensics. In particular, Digital Examiners should be aware of how decisions in Federal Court may impact their ability to acquire evidence in both civil and criminal settings. Digital Forensics, being a relatively new field, is particularly subject to change as cases and appeals are decided. This paper provides an overview of relevant case law relating to issues in Digital Forensics. More importantly, our research provides Digital Forensic Examiners (DFE), as defined by Lonardo, White, and Rea (Lonardo, 2008, 2009), with scenarios that illustrate the various nuances when dealing with the consent to search. From issues of common authority, conflicting <b>consent,</b> <b>apparent</b> authority, and voluntary consent, our research explores court findings and applies them to practical advice and policy formation for DFEs. </p...|$|R

50|$|A defence against {{criminal}} liability may arise when a defendant can argue that, because of consent, {{there was no}} crime (e.g., arguing that permission was given to use an automobile, {{so it was not}} theft or taken without owner's consent).

50|$|Lord Diplock said duress is {{not about}} not knowing what you are {{contracting}} for, but ‘his <b>apparent</b> <b>consent</b> was induced by pressure exercised on him by that other party which {{the law does not}} regard as legitimate, with the consequence that the consent is treated in law as revocable unless approbated either expressly or by implication after the illegitimate pressure has ceased to operate on his mind.’ It was not appropriate to say the conduct was commercial pressure ‘wherever one party to a commercial transaction is in a stronger bargaining position than the other party’ should give rise to a right of redress.|$|E

50|$|Laws against {{child sexual}} abuse vary by country based on the local {{definition}} of who is a child and what constitutes {{child sexual abuse}}. Most {{countries in the world}} employ some form of age of consent, with sexual contact with an underage person being criminally penalized. As the age of consent to sexual behaviour varies from country to country, so too do definitions of child sexual abuse. An adult's sexual intercourse with a minor below the legal age of consent may sometimes be referred to as statutory rape, based on the principle that any <b>apparent</b> <b>consent</b> by a minor could not be considered legal consent.|$|E
50|$|If {{the vehicle}} is taken with the owner's knowledge, the owner has consented. But <b>apparent</b> <b>consent</b> can be ignored if {{obtained}} by a deception, e.g. giving a false identity when hiring a car. This overlaps with the section 15 offence of obtaining property or services by deception. Taking by force may be robbery when the defendant did not intend the victim to recover the vehicle at all or so seriously damaged it that such conduct amounts to a theft (see section 6). If the evidence is insufficient for theft, the alternative charges are aggravated vehicle taking or blackmail under section 21. Note that section 12(7) protects the interests of people hiring or buying under a hire purchase agreement by deeming them to be the owner {{for the purposes of}} section 12.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{definitions}} {{have been}} proposed for prostitution of children. The United Nations defines it as [...] "the act of engaging or offering {{the services of a}} child to perform sexual acts for money or other consideration with that person or any other person". The Convention on the Rights of the Child's Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution, and Child Pornography defines the practice as [...] "the act of obtaining, procuring or offering the services of a child or inducing a child to perform sexual acts for any form of compensation or reward". Both emphasize that the child is a victim of exploitation, even if <b>apparent</b> <b>consent</b> is given. The Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999, (Convention No 182) of the International Labour Organization (ILO) describes it as the [...] "use, procuring or offering of a child for prostitution".|$|E
50|$|The {{basis of}} {{contractual}} liability, where {{the parties to}} a contract do not misunderstand each other, is consensus ad idem animo contrahendi. In those exceptional {{cases in which the}} parties misunderstand each other and only <b>apparent</b> <b>consent</b> exists, liability appears to rest on the reasonable reliance by the contracting party on the existence of consensus. This is known in contract law as the reliance theory. Such consent may be termed “constructive consent.” Of course, there is always room also for the application of the doctrine of estoppel, if a litigant can satisfy its more stringent requirements, and if he wishes to avail himself of this remedy in order to hold a party bound to the appearance of consensus he has created. For a contract as such to exist, however, actual or constructive consent must be achieved. This is brought about by offer and acceptance.|$|E
5000|$|Barry's first book, Female Sexual Slavery (1979), {{prompted}} international {{awareness of}} human sex trafficking [...] {{and has been}} translated into six languages. Her follow-up to Female Sexual Slavery, The Prostitution of Sexuality (1995) makes {{an important contribution to}} political philosophy and feminist theory by discussing the idea of [...] "consent" [...] in liberal modern American discourse and concluding that [...] "every form of oppression is sustained" [...] through <b>apparent</b> <b>consent</b> by the oppressed group or class to their exploitation. She further concludes that the normalization and acceptance of prostitution based on arguments of prostitutes' consent ignores the human-rights principle that violation cannot be consented to. She states that women, as members of an oppressed class under patriarchy, are compelled to [...] "consent" [...] to their own sexual exploitation by society, much in the way a Marxist would say workers are compelled to cooperate with their oppressors, the capitalists.|$|E
50|$|Sex {{work has}} been a particularity {{divisive}} issue within feminism. Some feminists may regard sex work {{as an example of}} societal oppression of the sex workers by the patriarchy. The ethical argument underlying this position is that despite the <b>apparent</b> <b>consent</b> of the sex worker, the choice to engage in sex work is often not an autonomous choice, because of economic, familial or societal pressures. Sex work may also be seen as an objectification of women. An opposing view held by other feminists such as Wendy McElroy is that sex work is a means of empowering women, the argument here being that in sex work women are able to extract psychological and financial power over men which is a justified correction of the power unbalance inherent in a patriarchal society. Some feminists regard to sex work as simply a form of labor which is neither morally good or bad, but subject to the same difficulties of other labor forms.|$|E

5000|$|Morrison {{spent nearly}} the {{entirety}} {{of his adult life}} with a woman named Pamela Courson after meeting her while both attended university. They met and she encouraged him to develop his poetry. At times, Courson used the surname [...] "Morrison" [...] with his <b>apparent</b> <b>consent,</b> or at least lack of concern. She was buried as Pamela Susan Morrison. After Courson's death in 1974, and after her parents petitioned the court for inheritance of Morrison's estate, the probate court in California decided that she and Morrison had once had what qualified as a common-law marriage, despite neither having applied for such status, and common-law marriage not being recognized in California. Morrison's will lists him as [...] "an unmarried person" [...] but listed Courson as the sole heir. They had previously obtained marriage licenses in Colorado in 1967 and in Los Angeles in 1968. The Doors' keyboardist Ray Manzarek described Courson as Morrison's [...] "other half". Morrison spoke to Courson through his lyrics and his poetry and dedicated his published poetry book The New Creatures to her. Songs like [...] "Love Street", [...] "Queen of the Highway", [...] "Blue Sunday", and [...] "Indian Summer" [...] as well as many of his poems were said to be written about her.|$|E
40|$|This article {{challenges}} the traditional view of consent as a binary issue. Because “lack of consent” {{is an element}} of an intentional tort, courts do not apply comparative responsibility principles and therefore must find that plaintiff has either consented to the invasion of her person or not. In cases where consent is predicated on <b>apparent</b> <b>consent</b> or implied consent, however, the all–or-nothing approach to consent fails to take into account that both plaintiff and defendant may have been responsible for a miscommunication as to consent. This essay focuses on well-known cases and situations where both parties likely contributed to a misunderstanding as to whether the plaintiff consented to the defendant’s conduct and suggests that, in such cases, comparative fault provides a modality for assessing damages. In many cases, the binary approach to consent is justified. When a court finds that both parties contributed to the misunderstanding, however, they should apply comparative fault to reflect that reality...|$|E

40|$|In this {{ground-breaking}} article {{submitted for}} publication in mid- 1986, Lucinda Vandervort creates a radically new and comprehensive theory of sexual consent as the unequivocal affirmative communication of voluntary agreement. She argues that consent is a social act of communication with normative effects. To consent is to waive a personal legal right to bodily integrity and relieve another person of a correlative legal duty. If the criminal law {{is to protect the}} individual’s right of sexual self-determination and physical autonomy, rather than simply to regulate the type and degree of force that may be used to obtain compliance from a victim, the point of reference must be the individual complainant, as a person who makes choices, not social norms or objective tests based on the ordinary person. To determine whether consent is voluntary, attention must be directed to {{the presence or absence of}} factors that had a coercive impact on the individual complainant, a specific person with a collection of social, cultural, and psychological experiences, needs, fears, values, and priorities. Individuals have the right to exercise self-determination in accordance with their own values and perceptions, not those of a mythical victim. Accordingly, Vandervort argues that the prosecution may show either refusal, the absence of affirmative voluntary agreement (including passivity or the absence of consent due to unconsciousness), or circumstances that invalidate any <b>apparent</b> <b>consent.</b> Any of these prove the absence of consent for the purposes of establishing the actus reus of sexual assault. The definition of consent as the affirmative communication of voluntary agreement is also shown to have a variety of implications for the interpretation and application of the law of sexual assault and the handling of evidentiary issues at trial in sexual assault cases. Key among these is the pivotal significance of the legal definition of consent as a tool to bar availability of the defence of “mistaken belief in consent. ” Vandervort argues that in many cases the defence of “mistaken belief in consent” is based on ignorance of the law of consent, mistake about the legal definition of consent, or a failure to appreciate the legal significance of facts that are well-known, and not on a mistaken belief in an erroneous set of facts. The broad proposition asserted here is that a statutory criminal law is enforceable only if all defences based directly or indirectly on belief in the validity of extra-legal norms that authorize infringement of rights protected by the criminal law are barred. This proposition and the characterization of some mistakes about consent as legal, not factual, are also shown to be useful to exclude rape-myths and stereotypical assumptions [...] -the stuff of which “social” definitions of consent have long been constructed [...] -from the decision-making process at trial...|$|E
