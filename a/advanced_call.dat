The valuable potential contained within this data {{to assist them in}} not only their daily operational decisions, but also long-term strategic planning decisions were recognized by <b>Advance</b> <b>Call.</b> From the comprehensive literature review conducted, a conclusion was drawn that a customized integrated business planning (IBP) tool would satisfy the needs of <b>Advance</b> <b>Call.</b> The objective of this tool can be translated to the imitation of the high-level interdependencies within the company in order to assist in planning activities. For this reason it was found that a system dynamics simulation methodology, utilizing AnyLogic simulation software, would be the most appropriate approach for developing the tool. The development process is set out in the proposed framework for the tool, a conducted data analysis and the conceptual design of the solution.

Public safety communications experts recognized that the nation's current 9-1-1 system was not capable of handling the text, data, images and video that are increasingly common in personal communications. The stated goal of a related USDOT project is: [...] "To enable the general public to make a 9-1-1 “call” (any real-time communication - voice, text, or video) from any wired, wireless, or IP-based device, and allow the emergency services community {{to take advantage of}} <b>advanced</b> <b>call</b> delivery and other functions through new internetworking technologies based on open standards."

As a result, Tuco is arrested and is imprisoned for assault and robbery, putting him out of the picture for five years. Nacho asks Mike why he went through all the trouble to avoid killing Tuco, for half the payoff, but Mike refuses to answer.|$|E
40|$|Internet based {{call control}} Web {{services}} enable telecommunications network operators to offerWeb developers a simplified method of controlling telecommunication resources. Web Services that expose telecommunication networks to third parties are highly abstracted. This abstraction allows Web developers to create applications that provide call control functionality without detailed {{knowledge of the}} underlying network. Functionality offered by network operators is usually of a simple nature, and does not provide developers with <b>advanced</b> <b>call</b> control functionality, similar to that found in operator services. <b>Advanced</b> <b>call</b> control requires the Web application to have detailed knowledge {{of the state of}} the telecommunication resources. In this research an Extended Call Control call model and Extended Call Control Web service are developed and demonstrated to provide Web applications with this knowledge. To develop the Extended Call Control call model existing telecommunication call models were analysed for components suitable for Web control. The Extended Call Control Web service was developed using <b>advanced</b> <b>call</b> control use cases. The proof of concept successfully demonstrates the use of the Extended Call Control Web service and the value of the Extended Call Control call model in proving asynchronous Web based <b>advanced</b> <b>call</b> control of telecommunications resources. This research has developed a novel call model for Web based call control of telecommunications networks. The Extended Call Control call model and API fulfils a fundamental requirement for Web based <b>advanced</b> <b>call</b> control, namely knowledge {{of the state of the}} underlying network and asynchronous control of those resources. This research facilitates the development of advancedWeb applications controlling telecommunications calls within the network which previously was limited by the knowledge of the network state.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new <b>advanced</b> <b>Call</b> Admission Control(CAC) {{strategy}} involving {{for the first}} time, a bandwidth reservation scheme that {{is influenced by the}} direction attribute of a mobile terminal (MT). Aside from the Quality-of-Service (QoS) parameters, the direction attribute {{plays a key role in}} efficiently reserving resources for MTs supporting multimedia communications for different QoS classes. The framework for a direction-based CAC system is entirely distributed and may be viewed as a message passing system, where MTs inform their neighbouring base stations (BS) not only of their QoS requirements, but also of their mobility parameters. The base stations then predict future demand and reserve resources accordingly, only admitting those terminals that can be adequately supported. The bandwidth reservation scheme proposed in this paper, integrates the direction attribute into the conventional Guard Channel (GC) scheme. Simulation results prove that this new scheme offers significant improvements in both Call Blocking Probability (CBP) and bandwidth utilization, under a variety of differing traffic conditions...|$|E
40|$|Several {{trends in}} SIP {{application}} server deployments exacerbate the classic problem of feature interaction in large enterprise telephony environments: use of distributed feature servers, mixing of legacy and green-field feature servers, and the co-existence of multiple third-party feature implementations provisioned {{in the same}} environment. Next-generation SIP application servers will include an application router (AR) to provide more control over feature sequencing. As we discuss here, the AR can be augmented to incorporate feature interaction detection and resolution logic. We describe a novel design for run-time feature interaction detection and resolution {{in an environment of}} distributed feature servers using a SIP application server with application routing function, such as that defined in JSR 289. The approach is based on the algorithm of the Kolberg-Magill (K-M) method for feature interaction detection.
