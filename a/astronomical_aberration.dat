2500|$|The {{aberration}} {{of light}} (also {{referred to as}} <b>astronomical</b> <b>aberration,</b> stellar aberration, or velocity aberration) is an astronomical phenomenon which produces an apparent motion of celestial objects about their true positions, dependent on the velocity of the observer. Aberration causes objects {{to appear to be}} displaced towards the direction of motion of the observer compared to when the observer is stationary. The change in angle is typically very small — of the order of v/c where c is the speed of light and v the velocity of the observer. In the case of [...] "stellar" [...] or [...] "annual" [...] aberration, the apparent position of a star to an observer on Earth varies periodically {{over the course of a}} year as the Earth's velocity changes as it revolves around the Sun, by a maximum angle of approximately 20arcseconds in right ascension or declination.|$|E
40|$|A new {{interpretation}} of <b>astronomical</b> <b>aberration</b> {{is given in}} this paper and {{it is based on}} the new theory of reference frames. The new interpretation confirms the result of classical physics based on the concept of ether and does not confirm the result of Special Relativity based on the constancy of the speed of light. But in the new theory there is no need to suppose the existence of ether. Comment: 5 pages, 1 figur...|$|E

As it accelerates, the wind as seen from the boat increases and the wind appears to shift forward. This is the same effect that causes rain to appear to fall at an angle when seen from a moving car, and is analogous to the <b>astronomical</b> phenomenon of <b>aberration</b> of light.|$|R

With Francis Baily he began in 1822 the construction of tables for the mean places of the fixed stars; the work was left uncompleted, because of the publication of the Fundamenta Astronomiæ of Friedrich Bessel. Their efforts, however, led to the complete catalogue of stars of the Royal Astronomical Society.|$|R
