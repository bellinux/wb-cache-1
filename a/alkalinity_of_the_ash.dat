40|$|In the US, over 100 {{million tons}} of coal {{utilization}} by-products (CUB) are generated annually. To determine if exposure of these materials to aqueous fluids poses an environmental threat, researchers at the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) have conducted extensive leaching tests. Five 1 kg samples of 35 PC fly ashes have been leached with acid, neutral and alkaline solutions at an approximate rate of 130 mL/d for 1 to 3 months. The leachates are analyzed for pH and 19 cations. The data from this leaching experiment {{has shown that the}} release of metal ions from fly ash is related to the <b>alkalinity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ash</b> and the mineral matrix of the element. However, comparing the maximum concentration in a leachate sample to its pH indicates that the dominant influence on solubility of metallic elements is pH. The pH of the leachate is determined by the soluble <b>alkalinity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ash</b> and the H + /OH- concentration of the leachant. Those elements that form oxyanions are apparently most soluble at high pH. Heavy metals are more soluble at low pH. Only Ca, Na, and K indicate significant solubility in the circumneutral pH range. For all elements except Ca, solubility is relatively low at all pH’s; generally less than 2 % of the amount present in the ash can be extracted even by long term leaching...|$|E
30|$|Nevertheless, the phytoavailability of Pb, Cr, and As in ashes {{appeared}} low {{compared to}} that predicted by the leaching amounts in water (the JLT 18 solution) because of the amphoteric leaching behavior. When the ash dissolves in an acid environment like a forest soil, the <b>alkalinity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ash</b> is consumed and the hazardous elements are exposed to a pH far lower than in ash, reducing their solubility. Moreover, under the soil environment, Cr(VI) will react with humic acid and revert to an oxidation state +III [34]. Therefore, to control the leaching amount of these hazardous substances, setting an adequate application dose considering the soil-dependent solubility of ash is crucial.|$|E

Individual seed Zn in farmers' seed lots of local upland rice varieties from a slash-and-burn system was evaluated by staining with dithizone (DTZ). Concentration of Zn in the farmers' seed lots and their single-seed descent genotypes grown at Chiang Mai University was determined by chemical analysis. The DTZ staining of individual seeds in most of the farmers' seed lots covered the intensity of standards that ranged from 19 mg Zn/kg (RD 21) to 31 (Nam Roo) mg Zn/kg. Zinc content by chemical analysis was closely correlated with the weighted-average staining for each seed lot. Almost all of the single-seed descent genotypes had higher seed Zn than RD 21; two-thirds were higher than Nam Roo. The variation within seed lots detected by DTZ staining was confirmed by seed Zn in the single-seed descent genotypes.

Using gypsum (CaSO 4 • 2 H 20) allows the amount of tartaric acid needed to reach a given pH to be reduced. This paper is {{a study of the}} acidification of musts produced in Sherry area (Southern Spain) to a pH of 3. 25 with tartaric acid alone and tartaric acid acting together with 2 g/L of gypsum.

40|$|Incineration is a {{commonly}} applied management method for {{municipal solid waste}} (MSW). However, significant amounts of potentially hazardous metal species {{are present in the}} resulting ash, and these may be leached into the environment. A common idea for cleaning the ash is to use enhanced leaching with strong mineral acids. However, due to the <b>alkalinity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ash,</b> large amounts of acid are needed and this is a drawback. Therefore, this work was undertaken in order to investigate some alternative leaching media (EDTA, ammonium nitrate, ammonium chloride and a number of organic acids) and to compare them with the usual mineral acids and water. All leaching methods gave a significant increase in ash specific surface area due to removal of soluble bulk (matrix) compounds, such as CaCO 3 and alkali metal chlorides. The use of mineral acids and EDTA mobilised many elements, especially Cu, Zn and Pb, whereas the organic acids generally were not very effective as leaching agents for metals. Leaching using NH 4 NO 3 was especially effective for the release of Cu. The results show that washing of MSW filter ash with alternative leaching agents is a possible way to remove hazardous metals from MSW fly ash...|$|E
40|$|The {{utilization}} of coal combustion by-products (CCB) as bulk fill and as mine backfill has {{raised questions about}} the potential contamination of surface and groundwater. A number of studies have addressed the release of various metal ions from CCB, but correlation of results has been difficult due to the multiplicity of methods and the variety of leachant solutions. Differences in the type of samples and sample size also have complicated the discussion. Leaching is related to the solubility of a specific compound and can be influenced by pH, temperature, complexation, and oxidation/reduction potential. A recent survey identified more than 100 leaching methods to remove soluble components from a solid matrix, including regulatory methods, standard methods, and those developed for a particular application. Regulatory tests and standard methods are not necessarily appropriate for leaching tests intended to simulate natural processes. Data obtained by different laboratories using standard or regulatory tests may be comparable (within an order of magnitude). Studies performed with different leaching methods do not necessarily produce comparable data, although researchers using different methods may arrive at similar conclusions. In the leaching studies surveyed, the disparity in leaching conditions, the duration of leaching, and the different samples make direct comparisons of results very difficult. However, many studies reached these general conclusions: C than calcium, less than 50 percent of an element in CCB is labile, even in long-term tests; C except for oxyanions, the solubility of cations in CCB increases with a decrease in pH; C the <b>alkalinity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ash</b> will affect its leachability; and C the distribution of an element in solid phases (crystalline, amorphous, surface coating) may control its solubility...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop data that are broadly applicable to the release of trace metals from fly ash, and to quantify the rate of release as a function of the composition of the ash. Thirty-two samples of Class F fly ash from pulverized coal combustion boilers were leached with seven leaching solutions simulating natural fluids. The leachate was analyzed for 21 cations that were major, minor, or trace constituents of the ash. The rate at which metal ions are released from fly ash is a complex function of the <b>alkalinity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ash,</b> the distribution of elements in various chemical compounds or minerals, and characteristics of the leachant solution, particularly its pH. In this experiment, the release of cations is defined as a solubility function with respect to the volume of leachant solution. During the first leaching interval, the ashes alkalinity is neutralized, and the release of metal ions, except for Ca, is relatively low. At some point, the release of metal ions increases by one or more orders of magnitude, and remains at that level, until the readily soluble ions are released. Then the elemental release decreases, again by one or more orders of magnitude. The solubility of an element is defined by the three volumetric functions and the median volumes for those functions. The N LF (neutralization leaching function) is describes the release of cations until the sample is neutralized (dMN/dVN, meq/L). The RLF (rapid leaching function) rate is the average slope of cumulative curve between inflection points (dML/dVL, meq/L). The TLF (terminal leaching function) is the average slope of cumulative curve after 2 nd inflection point (dMT/dVT, meq/L). In a natural setting, if the infiltration rate is known (L/d), the time dependent release of the elements can be estimated. The results of this study show that most cations in fly ash are only slightly soluble, that elements, other than arsenic, tend to be most soluble in acid solutions, and that non-silicates tend to be more soluble than silicates...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{several aspects of}} ash {{chemistry}} are discussed. An issue of primary concern for boiler operators is the formation of ash deposits. New biomass fuels are introduced, {{many of which have}} unfavourable ash melting behaviour due to high levels of alkali metal species and chlorine. In addition to the inferior heat recovery caused by insulating deposits, aggressive ash components may cause corrosion on heat exchanger tube materials. In fluidised bed combustion, ash sintering and melting can cause bed material agglomeration and, at worst, total bed sintering. Furthermore, chemical reactions involving bed ash components may add to the sintering through formation of new products encapsulating the original particles. Reducing conditions, which in combination with high SO 2 levels resulted in formation of CaS, was observed in the bottom bed of an FBC boiler. Under reducing conditions, due to insufficient fuel-air mixing and staged combustion, transformations and eutectics in the systems CaS - CaSO 4 - alkali species and silicates-iron-rich oxides increase the risk for sintering. Chemical mechanisms involved in bed material agglomeration, deposit formation and fouling of heat exchanger surfaces during coal firing in pressurised fluidised bed combustors were investigated. The results showed that all of the following three chemical systems CaS - CaSO 4 - alkali species, silicate - alkali - chlorine and silicate systems containing iron-rich oxides had contributed to the sintering and fouling processes. Furthermore, the use of fuel additives to enhance the ash melting point in biomass combustion has been investigated. Kaolin was found to be a more effective additive than dolomite. This can be assigned partly to chemical reactions between kaolin and alkali salts from the fuel ash and partly to physical adsorption of the ash melt. In the second part of this thesis the environmental effects of ash utilisation and deposition are discussed. Recycling of wood ash to forest soil may be used as a means of maintaining a sustainable forestry and avoiding a mineral nutrient impoverishment in the forest soil. In order to obtain suitable release rates for nutrients, a stabilisation of the ash is recommended. Stabilisation may be accomplished by moistening and agglomeration of the ash. In this so-called hardening process some ash components form secondary hydrated minerals with low solubility. The secondary minerals contribute to inter-particle bonding during agglomeration The most important transformation is that of Ca(OH) 2 to CaCO 3 since it reduces the solubility of calcium and the <b>alkalinity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ash.</b> Thus, a pH shock in the forest soil is avoided. The ash particle dissolution rate is dependent on the particle size and the stability of the hardened ash matrix. The results obtained indicate that granulation may be a more efficient agglomeration method than spontaneous self-hardening. Potassium is mainly present in soluble salts and thus the release rate is rather high whereas the release of phosphorous as well as minor and trace metals is very slow due to the high pH of the pore water. Since P is an essential plant nutrient, its slow release from wood ash may be problematic. Granules were observed to retain alkali chlorides better than spontaneously formed agglomerates. Ashes from co-combustion of wood with peat, coal and oil were also investigated. The coal and peat introduce inorganic species such as sulphides, clay minerals and feldspars, giving the ash a higher content of S, Al, Si and Fe than that of wood ash. However, the release of minor and trace metals was equally low as observed for pure wood ashes. Thus, the results obtained in this work indicate that a limited admixture of fossil fuels may not be detrimental {{to the use of the}} ash as a forest mineral fertiliser...|$|E

Within two STAR’s we will focus on <b>the</b> fly <b>ash</b> and limestone as replacements for part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clinker. This first part will mainly focus on the reactivity, activation and reaction products of fly ash. Fly ash is a relatively slow reacting pozzolan. Its reactivity depends on <b>the</b> <b>alkalinity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cement, the curing temperature, the replacement level and the water-binder ratio. <b>The</b> reactivity <b>of</b> fly <b>ash</b> can be improved by thermal, chemical or mechanical activation.

Although it might be of interest for prefabrication industry, it is not really an option for every day use on the construction side. When discussing chemical activation, it is clear that alkalinity place a major role. At room temperature fly ash only starts to react noticeable at a pH higher than 13. 3. This level <b>of</b> <b>alkalinity</b> is only reached after one or more days in ordinary Portland cement.

40|$|International audienceThis paper reports <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> <b>alkalinity,</b> Si/Al {{ratio and}} amount of {{tetramethylammonium}} (TMA) on <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> nanocrystals <b>of</b> faujasite. <b>The</b> presence <b>of</b> TMA allows to form faujasite crystals smaller than 0. 1 μm. In {{a wide range of}} composition, there is no proportionality between <b>the</b> concentration <b>of</b> TMA in <b>the</b> synthesis system and <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> zeolite crystals formed. TMA concentrations as low as 0. 05 mmol L- 1 are enough to induce <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> crystals <b>of</b> 30 nm. <b>The</b> role <b>of</b> TMA in <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> nanocrystals corresponds to a shift <b>of</b> <b>the</b> balance between nucleation and growth kinetics due to <b>the</b> adsorption <b>of</b> organics at <b>the</b> surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nuclei <b>of</b> zeolite. <b>The</b> field <b>of</b> composition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> faujasite crystals shifts from zeolite Y to zeolite X according to <b>the</b> <b>alkalinity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> synthesis system. As expected, <b>the</b> effectiveness <b>of</b> silicon incorporation decreases with <b>the</b> <b>alkalinity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> synthesis system. However, <b>the</b> effectiveness <b>of</b> silicon incorporation significantly increases with <b>the</b> content <b>of</b> TMA, suggesting that the large TMA cations contrast <b>the</b> depolymeryzing effect <b>of</b> <b>alkalinity</b> on <b>the</b> silicate species implied in <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> zeolite. This effect is modulated by <b>the</b> concentration <b>of</b> silicate in <b>the</b> synthesis system...|$|R
