5|$|Historically, <b>all</b> <b>living</b> <b>things</b> were {{classified}} as either animals or plants and botany covered the study of all organisms not considered animals. Botanists examine both the internal functions and processes within plant organelles, cells, tissues, whole plants, plant populations and plant communities. At each of these levels, a botanist may be concerned with the classification (taxonomy), phylogeny and evolution, structure (anatomy and morphology), or function (physiology) of plant life.|$|E

A life-form whose solvent was a hydrocarbon would not face the risk of its biomolecules being destroyed in this way.|$|E
5|$|Lamarck {{proposed}} the transmutation of species ("transformisme"), {{but did not}} believe that <b>all</b> <b>living</b> <b>things</b> shared a common ancestor.

5|$|Originally Aristotle divided <b>all</b> <b>living</b> <b>things</b> between plants, which {{generally}} do not move fast enough for humans to notice, and animals. In Linnaeus' system, these became the kingdoms Vegetabilia (later Plantae) and Animalia. Since then, {{it has become clear}} that the Plantae as originally defined included several unrelated groups, and the fungi and several groups of algae were removed to new kingdoms. However, these are still often considered plants in many contexts. Bacterial life is sometimes included in flora, and some classifications use the term bacterial flora separately from plant flora.|$|E
5|$|Teilhard de Chardin's {{ideas have}} been seen by advocates of the Gaia {{hypothesis}} proposed by James Lovelock, which holds that the living and nonliving parts of Earth {{can be viewed as}} a complex interacting system with similarities to a single organism, as being connected to Lovelock's ideas. The Gaia hypothesis has also been viewed by Lynn Margulis and others as an extension of endosymbiosis and exosymbiosis. This modified hypothesis postulates that <b>all</b> <b>living</b> <b>things</b> have a regulatory effect on the Earth's environment that promotes life overall.|$|E

The shark has the greatest electrical sensitivity of any animal. Sharks find prey hidden in sand by detecting the electric fields they produce. Ocean currents moving in the magnetic field of the Earth also generate electric fields that sharks can use for orientation and possibly navigation.|$|E

5|$|Cell theory {{states that}} the cell is the {{fundamental}} unit of life, that <b>all</b> <b>living</b> <b>things</b> are composed {{of one or more}} cells, and that all cells arise from other cells through cell division. In multicellular organisms, every cell in the organism's body derives ultimately from a single cell in a fertilized egg. The cell is also considered to be the basic unit in many pathological processes. In addition, the phenomenon of energy flow occurs in cells in processes {{that are part of the}} function known as metabolism. Finally, cells contain hereditary information (DNA), which is passed from cell to cell during cell division. Research into the origin of life, abiogenesis, amounts to an attempt to discover the origin of the first cells.|$|E
5|$|Titanium was {{discovered}} in Cornwall, Great Britain, by William Gregor in 1791, and was named by Martin Heinrich Klaproth for the Titans of Greek mythology. The element occurs within a number of mineral deposits, principally rutile and ilmenite, which are widely distributed in the Earth's crust and lithosphere, and it is found in almost <b>all</b> <b>living</b> <b>things,</b> water bodies, rocks, and soils. The metal is extracted from its principal mineral ores by the Kroll and Hunter processes. The most common compound, titanium dioxide, is a popular photocatalyst and {{is used in the}} manufacture of white pigments. Other compounds include titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4), a component of smoke screens and catalysts; and titanium trichloride (TiCl3), which is used as a catalyst in the production of polypropylene.|$|E
5|$|Organisms {{were first}} {{classified}} by Aristotle (Greece, 384–322 BC) during his {{stay on the}} Island of Lesbos. He classified beings by their parts, or in modern terms attributes, such as having live birth, having four legs, laying eggs, having blood, or being warm-bodied. He divided <b>all</b> <b>living</b> <b>things</b> into two groups: plants and animals. Some of his groups of animals, such as Anhaima (animals without blood, translated as invertebrates) and Enhaima (animals with blood, roughly the vertebrates), as well as groups like the sharks and cetaceans, are still commonly used today. His student Theophrastus (Greece, 370–285 BC) carried on this tradition, mentioning some 500 plants and their uses in his Historia Plantarum. Again, several plant groups currently still recognized {{can be traced back}} to Theophrastus, such as Cornus, Crocus, and Narcissus.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} relations between 124 British children’s and their parents’ endorsements {{about the origins}} of three <b>living</b> <b>things</b> (human, non-human animal, plant) as reported on questionnaires. In addition to completing questionnaires, half of the sample discussed the origins of entities (n = 64) in parent-child dyads before completing the questionnaires. The 7 -year-old age group endorsed creationism more than evolution and the 10 -year-old age group endorsed both concepts equally for <b>all</b> three <b>living</b> <b>things.</b> Children’s endorsements were correlated with their parents’ endorsements for <b>all</b> three <b>living</b> <b>things.</b> Children’s endorsement of evolutionary theory was more closely related to parent-child conversational mentions of evolution than to parents’ endorsement of evolutionary theory in questionnaires. A similar pattern was found for children’s endorsement of creationism. Parent-child conversations did not consistently invoke evolution or creationism even when parents endorsed a particular theory. Findings are interpreted in relation to the pivotal role of joint collaborative conversation in children’s appropriation of scientific content...|$|R

5|$|Before {{the modern}} medical era, the main means for {{studying}} the internal structures of the body were dissection {{of the dead and}} inspection, palpation and auscultation of the living. It was the advent of microscopy that opened up an understanding of the building blocks that constituted living tissues. Technical advances in the development of achromatic lenses increased the resolving power of the microscope and around 1839, Matthias Jakob Schleiden and Theodor Schwann identified that cells were the fundamental unit of organization of <b>all</b> <b>living</b> <b>things.</b> Study of small structures involved passing light through them and the microtome was invented to provide sufficiently thin slices of tissue to examine. Staining techniques using artificial dyes were established to help distinguish between different types of tissue. Advances in the fields of histology and cytology began in the late 19th century along with advances in surgical techniques allowing for the painless and safe removal of biopsy specimens. The invention of the electron microscope brought a great advance in resolution power and allowed research into the ultrastructure of cells and the organelles and other structures within them. About the same time, in the 1950s, the use of X-ray diffraction {{for studying the}} crystal structures of proteins, nucleic acids and other biological molecules gave rise to a new field of molecular anatomy.|$|E
5|$|Jean-Baptiste Lamarck proposed, in his Philosophie Zoologique of 1809, {{a theory}} of the {{transmutation}} of species (transformisme). Lamarck {{did not believe that}} <b>all</b> <b>living</b> <b>things</b> shared a common ancestor but rather that simple forms of life were created continuously by spontaneous generation. He also believed that an innate life force drove species to become more complex over time, advancing up a linear ladder of complexity that was related to the great chain of being. Lamarck recognized that species adapted to their environment. He explained this by saying that the same innate force driving increasing complexity caused the organs of an animal (or a plant) to change based on the use or disuse of those organs, just as exercise affects muscles. He argued that these changes would be inherited by the next generation and produce slow adaptation to the environment. It was this secondary mechanism of adaptation through the inheritance of acquired characteristics that would become known as Lamarckism and would influence discussions of evolution into the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{study of}} plants is vital because they {{underpin}} almost all animal life on Earth by generating {{a large proportion}} of the oxygen and food that provide humans and other organisms with aerobic respiration with the chemical energy they need to exist. Plants, algae and cyanobacteria are the major groups of organisms that carry out photosynthesis, a process that uses the energy of sunlight to convert water and carbon dioxide into sugars that can be used both as a source of chemical energy and of organic molecules that are used in the structural components of cells. As a by-product of photosynthesis, plants release oxygen into the atmosphere, a gas that is required by nearly <b>all</b> <b>living</b> <b>things</b> to carry out cellular respiration. In addition, they are influential in the global carbon and water cycles and plant roots bind and stabilise soils, preventing soil erosion. Plants are crucial to the future of human society as they provide food, oxygen, medicine, and products for people, as well as creating and preserving soil.|$|E

5|$|Most Egyptian deities {{represent}} {{natural or}} social phenomena. The gods were generally {{said to be}} immanent in these phenomena—to be present within nature. The types of phenomena they represented include physical places and objects as well as abstract concepts and forces. The god Shu was the deification of all the world's air; the goddess Meretseger oversaw a limited region of the earth, the Theban Necropolis; and the god Sia personified the abstract notion of perception. Major gods often had many roles and were involved in several types of phenomena. For instance, Khnum was the god of Elephantine Island {{in the midst of}} the Nile, the river that was essential to Egyptian civilization. He was credited with producing the annual Nile flood that fertilized the nation's farmland. Perhaps as an outgrowth of this life-giving function, he was said to create <b>all</b> <b>living</b> <b>things,</b> fashioning their bodies on a potter's wheel. Gods could share the same role in nature; Ra, Atum, Khepri, Horus, and other deities acted as sun gods. Despite their diverse functions, most gods had an overarching role in common: maintaining maat, the universal order that was a central principle of Egyptian religion and was itself personified as a goddess. But some deities represented disruption to maat. Most prominently, Apep was the force of chaos, constantly threatening to annihilate the order of the universe, and Set was an ambivalent member of divine society who could both fight disorder and foment it.|$|E
25|$|The {{fundamental}} principles of Jainism {{revolve around the}} concept of altruism, not only for humans but for all sentient beings.

It also considers <b>all</b> <b>living</b> <b>things</b> to be equal. The first Tirthankara, Rishabhdev introduced the concept of altruism for all living beings, from extending knowledge and experience to others to donation, giving oneself up for others, non-violence and compassion for <b>all</b> <b>living</b> <b>things.</b>|$|E
