5000|$|These five {{components}} {{work together}} to greatly dampen, if not eliminate, the nervousness of traditional MRP systems and the bullwhip effect in complex and challenging environments. The Demand Driven Institute claims the following: In utilizing these approaches, planners will {{no longer have to}} try to respond to every single message for every single part that is off by even one day. This approach provides real information about those parts that are truly at risk of negatively impacting the planned availability of inventory. DDMRP sorts the significant few items that require attention from the many parts that are being managed. Under the DDMRP approach, fewer planners can make better decisions more quickly. That means companies will be better able to leverage their working and human capital as well as the huge investments they have made in information technology. One down-side, however, is that DDMRP can not run on the majority of MRPII/ERP systems in use today, so organisations will have to implement <b>a</b> <b>compatible</b> <b>system</b> in order to run DDMRP.|$|E
50|$|The Play-Yan is an MP3 and MPEG-4 player add-on for the Game Boy Advance SP, Nintendo DS, DS Lite, and Game Boy Micro. Music {{and video}} files stored on an SD memory card can be loaded {{into a slot}} {{on the right side}} of the Play-Yan, which resembles a Game Boy Advance game cartridge. The Play-Yan is loaded {{directly}} into the Game Boy Advance game slot of <b>a</b> <b>compatible</b> <b>system.</b> While the original Game Boy Advance is compatible, its non-illuminated screen and the Play-Yan's high rate of power consumption do not make the Game Boy Advance a very suitable platform. The Play-Yan is also compatible with the Game Boy Player, but compressed video does not play back as nicely on a television screen as it does on a small, portable screen. Therefore, the Game Boy Player is a somewhat unsuitable platform as well, at least compared to any standard DVD player. The adapter has its own integrated headphone port, but uses the parent console's power supply, controls, and display. The Play-Yan is advertised as offering sixteen hours of MP3 playback and four hours of MPEG-4 playback on a fully charged Game Boy Advance SP. In addition to multimedia playback, the Play-Yan offers support for minigames which could be downloaded from Nintendo of Japan's website.|$|E
5000|$|Various approximations of {{non-linear}} editing systems {{were built in}} the '80s using computers coordinating multiple laser discs, or banks of VCRs. One example of these tape & disc-based systems was Lucasfilm's EditDroid, which used several laserdiscs of the same raw footage to simulate random-access editing (<b>a</b> <b>compatible</b> <b>system</b> was developed for sound post-production by Lucasfilm called SoundDroid—one of the earliest digital audio workstations). The LA-based post house Laser Edit (which later merged with Pacific Video as Laser-Pacific) also had an in-house system using recordable random-access laserdiscs. The most popular non-linear system was Ediflex, which used a bank of multiple Sony JVC VCRs for offline editing. Ediflex was introduced in 1983 on the Universal series [...] "Still the Beaver," [...] edited by Herb Dow, A.C.E. By 1985 it was used on over 80% of filmed network programs. In 1985 Cinedco was awarded the Technical Emmy for [...] "Design and Implementation of Non-Linear Editing for Filmed Programs. Adrian Ettlinger, Herb Dow A.C.E., Milt Forman and Andy Maltz shared the award, All were slow, cumbersome, and had problems with the limited computer horsepower of the time, but the mid-to-late-1980s saw a trend towards {{non-linear editing}}, moving away from film editing on Movieolas and the linear videotape method (usually employing 3/4" [...] VCRs).|$|E
