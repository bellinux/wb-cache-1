5|$|In Heart of the Swarm, Valerian helps Raynor and his Raiders {{escape into}} the Umojan Protectorate, where Kerrigan {{undergoes}} extensive testing {{in a research}} lab. The lab is discovered and attacked by a Dominion task force, and Valerian and Kerrigan escape on board the Hyperion, the Raiders' flagship. Valerian is nearly psionically strangled by Kerrigan for leaving Raynor behind on the base. Valerian knew that his father {{would be willing to}} sacrifice him to destroy Kerrigan, even in spite of Hyperion captain Matt Horner warning the Dominion fleet that he was on board, and so he aided Kerrigan and the Raiders in searching for him. During the final assault against Korhal, Valerian recognized that Arcturus was beyond redemption, and asked only that Kerrigan minimize civilian casualties; Kerrigan thus elected to attend his request, recognizing him as <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>man</b> from his father. Kerrigan killed Arcturus shortly thereafter. Following {{the death of his father}} and the departure of the Zerg, Valerian assumed the throne and became the new Emperor of the Dominion. He immediately went to work rebuilding the Dominion, and enacted new laws to eliminate the corruption and abuse of power that had occurred during his father's reign. These reforms included abolishing forced military conscription and slave labor. He also reorganized a number of his father's secret projects, such as Project Blackstone.|$|E
25|$|In county cricket, however, Salisbury was <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>man.</b> He passed 50 wickets most seasons, {{and when}} he left Sussex for Surrey in 1997 he revelled in wickets that suited his bowling style. In {{successive}} seasons his bowling average improved: 31.20, 22.89, 22.19, and in 2000 he took 52 wickets at just 18.92, including a career-best 8–60 (and 11–101 in the match) at The Oval against Somerset.|$|E

25|$|Castaneda {{moved to}} the United States in the early 1950s and became a {{naturalized}} citizen on June 21, 1957. He was educated at UCLA (B.A. 1962; Ph.D. 1973). Castaneda married Margaret Runyan in Mexico in 1960, according to Runyan's memoirs. Castaneda is listed on the birth certificate of Runyan's son C.J. Castaneda as his father even though his biological father was <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>man.</b> It is unclear whether Carlos and Margaret were divorced in 1960, 1973, or not at all, and his death certificate even stated {{he had never been}} married.|$|E
25|$|Near {{the end of}} the story, {{the group}} that set out to bury Kazangap has nearly reached the Ana-Beiit cemetery. However, they are {{hindered}} in their journey by a barbed wire fence erected {{in the middle of their}} route. Resolved to go around it, they travel along it toward another road only to reach a check-point manned by a young soldier. To their dismay, they are told that access beyond the fence is prohibited, but the soldier calls his superior to see if an exception can be made. It is then that Yedigei learns that the superior is named Tansykbaev but discovers that this is <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>man</b> from the one previously known. However, the new Tansykbaev is also encrusted in a patina of hierarchical obedience and interpersonal tyranny; unmoved by the procession's request, he denies them entry and also informs them that the Ana-Beiit cemetery is to be leveled in the future.|$|E
25|$|The ritual {{was usually}} {{conducted}} approximately every 10–12 years for all girls, including infants, within a tharavad {{who had not}} previously {{been the subject of}} it. Higher-ranked groups within the caste, however, would perform the ritual more frequently than this and in consequence the age range at which it occurred was narrower, being roughly between age 10 and 13. This increased frequency would reduce the likelihood of girls from two generations being involved in the same ceremony, which was forbidden. The karnavan organised the elaborate ritual after taking advice from prominent villagers and also from a traditional astrologer, known as a Kaniyan. A pandal was constructed for the ceremony and the girls wore ornaments specifically used only on those occasions, as well as taking a ritual bath in oil. The ornaments were often loaned as only a few villagers would possess them. The person who tied the thali would be transported on an elephant. The higher the rank of that person then the greater the prestige reflected on to the tharavad, and also vice versa since some people probably would refuse to act as tier in order to disassociate themselves from a group and thereby bolster their claims to be members of a higher group. Although information is far from complete, those who tied the thali for girls of the aristocratic Nair families of Cochin in Central Kerala appear to have been usually Samantans, who were of higher rank, or occasionally the Kshatriyas, who were still higher. The Nambudiri Brahmins of Central Kerala acted in that role for the royal house of Cochin (who were Kshatriyas), but whether they did so for other Kshatriyas is less certain. The Kshatriyas would tie for the Samantans. Having the thali of each girl tied by <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>man</b> was more prestigious than having one tier perform the rite for several girls. The thali tying was followed by four days of feasting, and on the fourth day the marriage was dissolved.|$|E

500|$|American actresses Kitty Cheatham and Isabel Irving—each {{married to}} <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>man</b> named [...] "W. H. Thompson"—traveled on Kroonland in May 1910. Alerted to each other's {{presence}} when mail addressed to [...] "Mrs. W. H. Thompson" [...] was confused, the actresses—old friends, having both {{worked in the}} theatre company of Augustin Daly—shared a state room for the voyage. Later that month, the ship was the official [...] "World Missionary Conference Steamship" [...] for delegates and representatives {{on their way to}} the World Missionary Conference in Edinburgh, Scotland. Honda Yoitsu, said to be the only Japanese Methodist Episcopal bishop, was among those on the liner when she sailed on 31 May. News accounts reported on some of the unusual activities aboard Kroonland during this trip. Among them were morning devotional services held daily in the ship's dining room, and the spontaneous singing of hymns on deck every evening.|$|E
500|$|Both Ben and Brother Justin {{would have}} been alive in the third season. Daniel Knauf would have written Brother Justin as a man [...] "with an {{inoperable}} chunk of shrapnel near his heart", which the anointed blade had caused in the final season 2 episode. Brother Justin {{would have been}} [...] "severely weakened and prone to exhaustion, serving as a hollow figurehead in his burgeoning ministry. Sofie and Iris would be vying for the power behind the throne, with Sofie by far the more dangerous of the two, although Iris is {{a force to be}} reckoned with." [...] Knauf had the intention of marrying Brother Justin to Sofie at some point in the future, and the third season would have shown a three-year-old boy amidst Sofie and the Crowes. Knauf left the question about the child's parents open. Ben's future would face other hardships. According to Knauf, Ben's wounds of the season 2 finale would require repeated suturing, causing him to lose his Vitae Divina and draining him of strength. Ben would be <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>man</b> than he was before, with a personality closer to Management, and while he and Sofie would be bound together by love, their ultimate fates remain uncertain.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by {{producer}} Eric Buchman, while filmmaker Michael Grossman directed it. Buchman explained how his main concept for the episode was to describe O'Malley's grieving {{in a different way}} than depicted for Stevens, but in a manner that would be both bothering to her and painful for his partner, Torres. However, he stated that Torres' emotional state during the mourning was also significant to the episode: [...] "We wanted Callie to feel some remorse. She finally got George, but not in the way she wanted. She's gotten his body, but the underlying relationship isn't there anymore." [...] Buchman disclosed that one of the story lines he had originally intended to include in the scrip was Yang and Burke's cold relationship being [...] "kept alive" [...] by having silent sex, which ultimately did not occur, due to being looked upon as [...] "boring, neither dramatic, nor comedic", and also as not being descriptive of the character's feelings. The story line involving the four attending physicians fighting for the title of chief of surgery, was described by Buchman as a comic relief, used to emphasize a childish side of the characters' personalities which had not been previously developed. In addition, Buchman described Webber's retirement as an attempt to reconcile with his estranged wife, but leads to emotional devastation at the realization that she had moved on with <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>man.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Timothy Wilson Spencer (March 17, 1962 – April 27, 1994), {{also known}} as the [...] "Southside Strangler", was an American serial killer who {{committed}} three rapes and murders in Richmond, Virginia and one in Arlington, Virginia in the fall of 1987. In addition, he is believed to have committed at least one previous murder, in 1984, for which <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>man,</b> David Vasquez, was wrongfully convicted. Spencer grew up in one of the toughest black neighborhoods in Arlington, called Green Valley. He was known to police as a prolific home burglar.|$|E

[...] Because he had prior felony convictions, Larsen was sentenced to 28 years to life in prison.

2500|$|The girl often {{never saw}} the man who tied the thali again and later married <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>man</b> during the sambandham. However, {{although}} she neither mourned {{the death of her}} sambandham husband nor became a widow, she did observe certain mourning rituals upon the death of the man who had tied her thali. Panikkar argues that this proves that the real, religious marriage is the thalikettu kalyanam, although he also calls it a [...] "mock marriage". He believes that it may have come into existence to serve as a religious demarcation point. Sexual morality was lax, especially outside the higher ranks, and both relationship break-ups and realignments were common; the thali kalyanam legitimised the marital status of the woman in the eyes of her faith prior to her becoming involved in the amoral activities that were common practice.|$|E
2500|$|Warrior {{returned}} to the WWF at WrestleMania VIII after nearly eight months on hiatus since SummerSlam 1991. Due to the drastic change in his appearance (shorter, blonder hair and a smaller physique), rumors began circulating that a new wrestler was playing the role. At {{the time it was}} rumored to be Kerry Von Erich, who was under contract at the time. Some said Warrior died from liver failure due to years of steroid abuse or that his signature arm tassels cut off his blood circulation. WWE claims that the theory that <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>man</b> {{returned to}} play The Ultimate Warrior at WrestleMania VIII remains [...] "perhaps the longest standing urban legend in WWE history". WWE announcer Tom Phillips claims that the rumors likely originated from Gene Okerlund's WCW Hotline as well as the WCW debut of Warrior doppelgänger The Renegade.|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} day, {{a neighbor}} of Casolaro's and long-time housekeeper, Olga, helped Casolaro pack a black leather tote. She remembers him packing a thick sheaf of papers into a dark brown or black briefcase. Casolaro said he was leaving for several days to visit Martinsburg, West Virginia, to meet a source who promised to provide an important missing piece to his story. This {{was the last time}} Olga saw him. Olga told The Village Voice that she answered several threatening telephone calls at Casolaro's home that day. She said that one man called at about 9:00a.m. and said, [...] "I will cut his body and throw it to the sharks". Less than an hour later, <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>man</b> said: [...] "Drop dead." [...] There was a third call, but Olga remembered only that no one spoke and that she heard music as though a radio were playing. A fourth call was the same as the third, and a fifth call, this one silent, came later that night.|$|E

2500|$|On May 8, 1872, as {{covered by}} the Washington Star, Mosby {{personally}} thanked now-U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant for that document. Mosby also told Grant he believed vehemently that election of Horace Greeley (a long-time editor of the New York Tribune detested in the South) would be worse for the South because the men surrounding him were worse than those surrounding his old benefactor Grant. A few days later, Massachusetts Congressman Benjamin Butler presented an amnesty bill for former Confederates, as Mosby had suggested in that meeting, and soon President Grant signed it into law. After Greeley became the Democratic party's nominee in July, Mosby became Grant's campaign manager in Virginia, and an active Republican, although he also made sure the Republicans would not run a candidate against his friend and fellow Warrenton attorney Eppa Hunton, who campaigned and won as a Democrat. In his autobiography Grant stated, [...] "Since {{the close of the}} war, I have come to know Colonel Mosby personally and somewhat intimately.
