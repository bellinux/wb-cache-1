40|$|In {{cities in}} the {{emerging}} world, public transport networks are governed by {{a large number of}} agents, each with their own agendas, priorities, incentives and resources, interacting nonlinearly through complex feedback loops. The transport system in these cities have developed into a semi-chaotic self-organizing structure with seemingly unpredictable behaviour to an outside observer. This is due to user agent actions by passengers, independent determination of operating plans and practices by transport operators, and <b>a</b> <b>managing</b> <b>authority</b> exhibiting a lack of will (both political and institutional), to implement adequate control measures to provide regulation and management of these systems. Based on the problems that face transport systems in developing cities and public transport in particular, this paper reports on an attempt to understand the supply of public transport in the Kampala area in a novel manner. We describe a mapping approach using a custom-developed smartphone application which was used to quickly and accurately capture informal transport systems for analysis and study of urban mobility where no dependable data was currently available. Secondly, based on the data created by the study project, to provide insights into the routes, operations and characteristics of the minibus taxi network which convey the majority of Kampala?s travelers. Our hypothesis is that by understanding the network in geospatial terms, {{we will be able to}} create benefits for all role-players and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the supply of public transport to more closely match the demand for public transport in an emerging world city.

The paper {{assesses the}} {{structures}} and dynamics of transnational coopera-tion projects promoted by Local Action Groups (LAGs) in different periods (from LEADER II to LEADER Axis) using Social Network Analysis (SNA) {{in a specific}} case study: the Veneto Region in Italy. The classical indexes of SNA have been critically examined, and the paper also presents innovative indexes that can capture the peculi-arity of transnational cooperation: disaggregated densities of the network and transna-tional centrality of the node. These indexes are useful in order to quantify how trans-national a network actually is, and to measure the power-information that each actor (LAG) can acquire through its transnational contacts. The methodology can become <b>a</b> tool for <b>Managing</b> <b>Authorities</b> to implement new forms of evaluation of transnational cooperation of LAGs...|$|R

40|$|The common {{security}} policies of access control and resource management {{are based upon}} <b>a</b> central <b>managing</b> <b>authority,</b> called the system administration, that is ultimately responsible {{for the management of}} a usage policy. This management is usually done with some combination of mandatory access control and discretionary access control methods, where each user is granted (or denied) privileges and resources depending on the usage policies enforced at that particular system. System administration includes the management of system resources, user accounts, and user privileges. This security policy is typified by an operating system such as UNIX, and it introduces several dificulties when working in a distributed computing environment. This paper addresses distributed resource management and access control. It proposes {{a new version of the}} “Distributed Compartment Model ” (DChf), first developed by Greenwald in his 1994 doctoral dissertation. DCM consists of two major components: Handles, a method for role based access control, and Distributed Compartments, a method allowing users to <b>manage</b> resources within <b>a</b> distributed system across administrative domain boundaries. This new version of DCM dis-cussed in this paper is a refinement of the original formal security policy model. This paper concentrates on the history and background of the problems motivating the creation of DCM, describes the informal security policy, proposes some ezample scenan’os as to how DCM could be used, and concludes with a discussion of the results of this research. ...|$|R
