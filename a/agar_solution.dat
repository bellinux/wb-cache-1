50|$|The {{presence}} of lysogenic bacteriophage T12 {{can be tested}} through plaque assays if the indicator strain utilized is susceptible to the phage being tested. Plaque assays consist of pouring a soft <b>agar</b> <b>solution</b> with an indicator strain onto an agar plate. The indicator strain should be a strain of bacteria that can be infected by the phage {{that needs to be}} detected. After the soft agar is set the samples that are being tested for phage presence are then spread-plated onto the soft agar plates. The plates are then incubated overnight and checked for clearings (plaques) the next day. If the phage is present, indicator strains will become infected and go through the normal lysogenic cycle while the plates incubate, and then undergo lysis. The plaque that determines whether the phage is present or not is caused by the lysis of the indicator strains. Titers of plaques can be found by diluting the samples and counting plaque-forming units (PFUs).|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{cyanobacterium}} Mastigocladus laminosus forms hormogonia, which glide slowly {{away from}} the parent colony by extruding slime out of nozzles. Using video microscopy, we observed hormogonia embedded in and moving through 1 – 4 % <b>agar</b> <b>solutions</b> with an average velocity of 0. 5 μm/s. Agar is non-Newtonian and is subject to shear-thinning so that its viscosity greatly increases at low shear rates. We measured the viscosity of these <b>agar</b> <b>solutions</b> at the very low shear rates appropriate for gliding hormogonia and found it to vary from 1 to 52 million centipoise. Then, by applying a Newtonian drag coefficient for a 100 -μm-long, cigar-shaped hormogonium, we found that it produced a force of several million pN. A typical hormogonium has 10 – 100 thousand 9 -nm-wide slime extrusion nozzles. Wolgemuth et al. have proposed hydration-driven swelling of the polyelectrolyte slime ejected from these nozzles as the force production mechanism, and our experiment found a large nozzle force that was consistent with this hypothesis.

As a consequence, both the viscosity and the pH of the solution decrease continuously during the incubation period. Furthermore, samples withdrew at different incubation times are cooled down to form gels which structure and mechanical properties are systematically determined.

40|$|The {{gelation}} of an <b>agar</b> biopolymer <b>solution</b> under quiescent conditions {{enables the}} formation of a strong network structure capable of sustaining mechanical deformation up to a critical strain or stress above which it fractures. Gelation of the same solution under shear conditions results in a weak gel which is capable of sustaining mechanical deformation at small strain or stresses but which flows if subjected to higher deformations. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate how shear can alter so drastically the rheological properties of biopolymer gels. We achieve this by investigating the nonisothermal gelation behaviour of agar biopolymer gels prepared under both oscillatory and steady shear conditions. A dynamic phase diagram summarises the effects of strain amplitude and frequency on the rheological properties of biopolymer gels formed at a constant cooling rate. We show that certain combinations of strain amplitude and frequency produce a new class of physical gel, a 2 ̆ 7 soft 2 ̆ 7 gel. Such gels present both yielding and cohesive characteristics. It is proposed that the imposition of shear changes the pathway through which structures are developed by promoting short range interactions beyond those possible through temperature change alone. Understanding the strength of such interactions and the time scales over which they occur will ultimately allow tuning of the structure development during cooling.

A protocol was developed for growing rice to maturity in <b>agar</b> nutrient <b>solution</b> (ANS), with optimum Zn-sufficient growth achieved at 1. 5 μM ZnSO 4. 7 H 2 O. The redox potential in ANS showed a decrease from + 350 mV to − 200 mV, mimicking the reduced conditions of flooded paddy soils. In subsequent experiments, rice genotypes contrasting for Zn deficiency tolerance and grain Zn were grown in ANS with sufficient and deficient Zn to assess differences in root uptake of Zn, root-to-shoot Zn translocation, and in the predominant sources of Zn accumulation in the grain. Zn efficiency of a genotype was highly influenced by root-to-shoot translocation of Zn and total Zn uptake. Translocation of Zn from root to shoot was more limiting at later growth stages than at the vegetative stage.

In vitro IAA production was estimated colorimetrically (with and without tryptophan in the medium). The Salkowski reagent was used to estimate IAA production and quantified spectrophotometrically by measuring the intensity of pink colour at 530  nm. The standard calibration curve was prepared by using standard IAA stock solution (0 – 100  μg ml− 1) which was prepared in 50  % ethanol (Gordon and Weber 1951). Pikovskaya medium containing tricalcium phosphate was used for the qualitative assay for P solubilization (Pikovskaya 1948) and the isolates showing the clear halo zone around the culture spot, after incubation for 48  h 30  °C, indicated the P solubilization capacity of the isolate. For qualitative analysis Pikovskaya’s broth was inoculated with PGPR isolates and incubated at 28  ±  2  °C on a rotary shaker. After 6 – 7  days of incubation water soluble Phosphorous was determined in the supernatant by the method of Olsen et al. (1954). HCN production was evaluated by the qualitative method of Bakker and Schippers (1987). In this the isolates were streaked in the sterilized King’s B medium amended with 4.4  g l− 1 of glycine. Whatman (No. 1) filter paper disc (9  cm in diameter) soaked in picric acid (0.05  % solution in 2  % Sodium Carbonate) was placed in the lid of each Petri plate. Colour change of the filter paper from deep yellow to orange and finally to dark brown show positive results of HCN production. Ammonia production was detected by growing the isolates in peptone broth for 72  h and then adding 1  ml of Nessler’s reagent to it. The isolates showing yellowish brown colour were found to exhibit positive results (Dye 1962). Chrome Azurole’s (CAS) agar media was used for the qualitative assay of siderophore production (Schwyn and Neilands 1987) and the isolates which showed a yellow orange halo around the colony were taken as positive results. The activity of 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylate (ACC) deaminase enzyme in the induced bacteria was quantified by measuring α-ketobutyrateamount produced by the enzymatic cleavage of ACC (Jacobson et al. 1994). The dual culture technique was used for accessing the antifungal activity against the test pathogen (Macrophomina phaseolina) on Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) medium (Dennis and Webster 1971) and after 48  h the diameter of zone of inhibition was measured. Nitrogen fixing ability of the isolates was determined by Acetylene reduction assay in nitrogen free medium. The pure cultures of the isolates were inoculated on a semi-solid nitrogen-free medium (Rennie 1981) which was prepared by solution A and solution B with 1  % <b>agar.</b> <b>Solutions</b> A and B were mixed together after being autoclaved separately and after filter sterilization Biotin (5  μg l− 1) and PABA (10  μg l− 1) were also added to the above mixture. After inoculating the isolates on this nitrogen-free semi- solid medium they were incubated at 30  °C for 48  h under stationary conditions. After incubation, the air was replaced with acetylene (10  % v/v) and the tubes are again incubated at 30  °C for 6  h. Ethylene production was measured using a Gas chromatograph and the total cell pellet obtained after centrifugation was digested by adding 500  μl of 2  N NaOH and kept at 100  °C for 30  min. After cooling, equal amounts of 2  N HCl were added to neutralize the aliquot. The values of ARA expressed in terms of nmol C 2 H 4  mg− 1  protein h− 1 and the protein concentration of the cell suspension was estimated by the method of Lowry et al. (1951).|$|R
