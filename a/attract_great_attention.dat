25|$|Zimmer Comes to the Front With an Indoor GameCharley Zimmer, the good-natured and gentlemanly catcher of the Cleveland Club has invented and {{patented}} {{an indoor}} game of base ball {{that ought to}} make him a little fortune. It promises {{to become one of the}} greatest toys of the age. A regular game can be played. The ball is pitched from an ingenious device and goes straight over the plate. If a hit isn't made or the ball struck at all the 'catcher' gets it. All the 'players' are in position, and there are regular catches in the outfield and pick-ups in the infield. The bat is a curious contrivance, and it takes good judgment to operate it. A fast or slow ball can be pitched, and the batter is liable to be 'fooled' by changes of pace. Nothing like it was ever seen before in toy games. The invention is to be shown in Hudson's window after Thanksgiving, and will surely <b>attract</b> <b>great</b> <b>attention.</b>|$|E

In particular, luminescent quantum dots (QDs) are defined as semiconductor structures with physical dimensions that are smaller than the exciton Bohr radius[1, 2].

30|$|SnO 2 nanobelts (NBs) have unique {{structural}} and functional properties which <b>attract</b> <b>great</b> <b>attention</b> in gas detecting. In this work, Eu doping is adopted {{to improve the}} gas sensitivity of pure SnO 2, especially to enhance the response to one single gas. The Eu-doped SnO 2 NBs, pure-SnO 2 NBs, and their single NB devices are fabricated by simple techniques. The sensing properties of the two sensors have been experimentally investigated. It is found that the two sensors possess long-term stability with rapid response performance, and Eu doping improves the electronic performance and the gas-sensing response, particularly to acetone. In addition, the effects aroused by Eu have been theoretically calculated, which indicates that Eu doping enhances the sensing performance of SnO 2. Consequently, Eu-doped SnO 2 NBs show great potential applications in the detection of acetone.|$|E
40|$|International audienceTransition metal ions in zeolites TMI-zeolite (TM = Fe, Co, Cu) <b>attract</b> <b>great</b> <b>attention</b> due {{to their}} {{potentialities}} as catalysts. In the recent years, the high efficiency of TMI-zeolites for the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of contaminated flue gases has been demonstrated.

Experimental results based on spectroscopies, as well as on reactivity studies have led to valuable insights about the structure of cationic sites as well as about the active species involved during the catalytic reactions. However, it is not sufficient to obtain all this information. This review reporting density functional theory (DFT) calculations shows that a molecular approach is very useful and has become an indispensable tool for the determination of the geometries, the electronic structures, the spectroscopic properties and the reactivity of TMI-zeolites...|$|E

This study investigates the possibilities of real-time and automated analysis of Twitter messages during crises. The analysis was performed through application of an information extraction tool to nearly 97, 000 tweets that were published shortly before, during and after a storm hit the Pukkelpop 2011 festival in Belgium. As soon as the storm hit the festival tweet activity increased exponentially, peaking at 576 tweets per minute. The extraction tool enabled analyzing tweets through predefined (geo) graphical displays, message content filters (damage, casualties) and tweet type filters (e. g., retweets). Important topics that emerged were 'early warning tweets', 'rumors' and the 'self-organization of disaster relief' on Twitter. Results indicate that automated filtering of information provides valuable information for operational response and crisis communication. Steps for further research are discussed. © 2012 ISCRAM.

40|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNTs) <b>attract</b> <b>great</b> <b>attention</b> due to {{the unique}} combination of physical, chemical, electrical and mechanical properties which have high potential for design of nanocomposite materials with customized properties (electromagnetic shielding, high strength and electroconductivity materials), actua-tors (e. g. artificial muscles and tissues), sensors, components of microfluidic devices, etc. Usage of CNT in practical applications is limited by their lower solubility in most solvents.

40|$|Hydrogels <b>attract</b> <b>great</b> <b>attention</b> as {{biomaterials}} as {{a result}} of their soft and wet nature, similar to that of biological tissues. Recent inventions of several tough hydrogels show their potential as structural biomaterials, such as cartilage. Any given application, however, requires a combination of mechanical properties including stiffness, strength, toughness, damping, fatigue resistance and self-healing, along with biocompatibility. This combination is rarely realized. Here, we report that polyampholytes, polymers bearing randomly dispersed cationic and anionic repeat groups, form tough and viscoelastic hydrogels with multiple mechanical properties. The randomness makes ionic bonds of a wide distribution of strength. The strong bonds serve as permanent crosslinks, imparting elasticity, whereas the weak bonds reversibly break and re-form, dissipating energy. These physical hydrogels of supramolecular structure can be tuned to change multiple mechanical properties over wide ranges by using diverse ionic combinations. This polyampholyte approach is synthetically simple and dramatically increases the choice of tough hydrogels for applications...|$|E
