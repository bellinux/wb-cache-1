40|$|Objectives: Because most {{research}} on long-term <b>acute</b> care <b>hospitals</b> {{has focused on}} Medicare, {{the objective of this}} research is to describe the Georgia Medicaid population who received care at a long-term <b>acute</b> care <b>hospital,</b> the type and volume of services provided by these long-term <b>acute</b> care <b>hospitals,</b> and the costs and outcomes of these services. For those with select respiratory conditions, we descriptively compare costs and outcomes to those of patients who received care for the same services in <b>acute</b> care <b>hospitals.</b> Methods: We describe Georgia Medicaid recipients admitted to a long-term <b>acute</b> care <b>hospital</b> between 2011 and 2012. We compare them to a population of Georgia Medicaid recipients admitted to an <b>acute</b> care <b>hospital</b> for one of five respiratory diagnosis-related groups. Measurements used include patient descriptive information, admissions, diagnosis-related groups, length of stay, place of discharge, 90 -day episode costs, readmissions, and patient risk scores. Results: We found that long-term <b>acute</b> care <b>hospital</b> admissions for Medicaid patients were fairly low (470 90 -day episodes) and restricted to complex cases. We also found that the majority of long-term <b>acute</b> care <b>hospital</b> patients were blind or disabled (71. 2 %). Compared to patients who stayed at an <b>acute</b> care <b>hospital,</b> long-term <b>acute</b> care <b>hospital</b> patients had higher average risk scores (13. 1 versus 9. 0), lengths of stay (61 versus 38 [*]days), costs (US$ 143, 898 versus US$ 115, 056), but fewer discharges to the community (28. 4 % versus 51. 8 %). Conclusion: We found that the Medicaid population seeking care at long-term <b>acute</b> care <b>hospitals</b> is markedly different than the Medicare populations described in other long-term <b>acute</b> care <b>hospital</b> studies. In addition, our study revealed that Medicaid patients receiving select respiratory care at a long-term <b>acute</b> care <b>hospital</b> were distinct from Medicaid patients receiving similar care at an <b>acute</b> care <b>hospital.</b> Our findings suggest that state Medicaid programs should carefully consider reimbursement policies for long-term <b>acute</b> care <b>hospitals,</b> including bundled payments that cover both the original hospitalization and long-term <b>acute</b> care <b>hospital</b> admission...|$|R

Most of the differences are explained by differences in the amount of [...] "supply-sensitive" [...] care available in an area. <b>Acute</b> <b>hospital</b> care accounts for over half (55%) of the spending for Medicare beneficiaries {{in the last two years}} of life, and differences in the volume of services provided is more significant than differences in price.
