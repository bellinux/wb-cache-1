40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of radio <b>astronomical</b> <b>stations</b> is often limited by man-made {{radio frequency interference}} (RFI) due {{to a variety of}} terrestrial activities. An RFI mitigation subsystem (RFIMS) based on real-time digital signalprocessing is proposed here for the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope based on a powerful field programmable gate array processor. In this system the radio astronomy signals polluted by RFI are "cleaned" with the RFIMS before routine back-end correlation processing takes place. The high temporal and frequency resolution of RFIMS allows the detection and excision of RFI better than do standard radio telescope back-end configurations. Comment: 17 pages, 17 figure...|$|R
