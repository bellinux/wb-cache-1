50|$|In genetics, {{a strain}} {{is said to}} be auxotrophic if it carries a {{mutation}} that renders it unable to synthesize an essential compound. For example, a yeast mutant with an inactivated uracil synthesis pathway gene is a uracil <b>auxotroph</b> (e.g., if the yeast Orotidine 5'-phosphate decarboxylase gene is inactivated, the resultant strain is a uracil <b>auxotroph).</b> Such a strain is unable to synthesize uracil and will only be able to grow if uracil can be taken up from the environment. This is the opposite of a uracil prototroph, or in this case a wild-type strain, which can still grow in the absence of uracil. Auxotrophic genetic markers are often used in molecular genetics; they were famously used in Beadle and Tatum's Nobel prize-winning work on the one gene-one enzyme hypothesis.|$|E

The degree to which revertants were observed in yeast was not as high as with bacteria. Other scientists have conducted similar experiments, such as Hall who tested histidine revertants, or Steele & Jinks-Robertson who tested lysine. These experiments demonstrate how recombination and DNA replication are necessary for adaptive mutation. However, in lysine-tested cells, recombination continued to occur even without selection for it. Steele and Jinks-Robertson concluded that recombination occurred in all circumstances, adaptive or otherwise, while mutations were present only when they were beneficial and adaptive.|$|E

50|$|A {{commonly}} used selection marker for transformation in C. merolae involves a uracil <b>auxotroph</b> (requiring exogenous uracil).

Random mutation led to several loss-of-function mutants in Ura5.3, which allowed cells to survive in the presence of 5-FOA as long as uracil was provided. By transforming this mutant with a PCR fragment carrying both a gene of interest and a functional copy of Ura5.3, researchers can confirm that the gene of interest has been incorporated into the C. merolae genome if it can grow without exogenous uracil.|$|E

5000|$|After {{moving to}} Stanford University in 1937, Beadle {{began working with}} {{biochemist}} Edward Tatum to isolate the fly eye pigments. After some success with this approach - they identified one of the intermediate pigments shortly after another researcher, Adolf Butenandt, beat them to the discovery - Beadle and Tatum switched their focus to an organism that made genetic studies of biochemical traits much easier: the bread mold Neurospora crassa, which had recently been subjected to genetic research by one of Thomas Hunt Morgan's researchers, Carl C. Lingegren. Neurospora had several advantages: it required a simple growth medium, it grew quickly, {{and because of the}} production of ascospores during reproduction it was easy to isolate genetic mutants for analysis. They produced mutations by exposing the fungus to X-rays, and then identified strains that had metabolic defects by varying the growth medium. This work of Beadle and Tatum led almost at once to an important generalization. This was that most mutants unable to grow on minimal medium but able to grow on “complete” medium each require addition of only one particular supplement for growth on minimal medium. If the synthesis of a particular nutrient (such as an amino acid or vitamin) was disrupted by mutation, that mutant strain could be grown by adding the necessary nutrient to the medium. This finding suggested that most mutations affected only a single metabolic pathway. Further evidence obtained soon after the initial findings tended to show that generally only a single step in the pathway is blocked. Following their first report of three such <b>auxotroph</b> mutants in 1941, Beadle and Tatum used this method to create series of related mutants and determined the order in which amino acids and some other metabolites were synthesized in several metabolic pathways. [...] The obvious inference from these experiments was that each gene mutation affects the activity of a single enzyme. This led directly to the one gene-one enzyme hypothesis, which, with certain qualifications and refinements, has remained essentially valid to the present day. As recalled by Horowitz et al., the work of Beadle and Tatum also demonstrated that genes have an essential role in biosyntheses. At the time of the experiments (1941), non-geneticists still generally believed that genes governed only trivial biological traits, such as eye color, and bristle arrangement in fruit flies, while basic biochemistry was determined in the cytoplasm by unknown processes. Also, many respected geneticists thought that gene action was far too complicated to be resolved by any simple experiment. Thus Beadle and Tatum brought about a fundamental revolution in our understanding of genetics.|$|E
40|$|Purine <b>auxotrophs</b> {{of various}} Rhizobium species are symbiotically defective, usually unable to {{initiate}} or complete the infection process. Earlier studies demonstrated that, in the Rhizobium etli-bean symbiosis, infection by purine <b>auxotrophs</b> is partially restored by supplementation {{of the plant}} medium with 5 -amino-imidazole- 4 -carboxamide (AICA) riboside, the unphosphorylated form of the purine biosynthetic intermediate AICAR. The addition of purine to the root environment does not have this effect. In this study, purine <b>auxotrophs</b> of Rhizobium fredii HH 303 and Rhizobium leguminosarum 128 C 56 (bv. viciae) were examined. Nutritional and genetic characterization indicated that each mutant was blocked in purine biosynthesis prior {{to the production of}} AICAR. R. fredii HH 303 and R. leguminosarum 128 C 56 appeared to be deficient in AICA riboside transport and/or conversion into AICAR, and the <b>auxotrophs</b> derived from them grew very poorly with AICA riboside as a purine source. All of the <b>auxotrophs</b> elicited poorly developed, uninfected nodules on their appropriate hosts. On peas, addition of AICA riboside or purine to the root environment led to enhanced nodulation; however, infection threads were observed only in the presence of AICA riboside. On soybeans, only AICA riboside was effective in enhancing nodulation and promoting infection. Although AICA riboside supplementation of the <b>auxotrophs</b> led to infection thread development on both hosts, the numbers of bacteria recovered from the nodules were still 2 or more orders of magnitude lower than in fully developed nodules populated by wild-type bacteria. The ability to AICA riboside to promote infection by purine <b>auxotrophs,</b> despite serving as a very poor purine source for these strains, supports the hypothesis that AICAR plays a role in infection other than merely promoting bacterial growth...|$|R

In these sites {{it is thought that}} adaptation of the pathogen might occur and growth factors, present in relative excess, may thus promote survival of the organism. Auxotrophy of pulmonary isolates of P aeruginosa has previously been shown to be a feature of cystic fibrosis and chronic lung sepsis; auxotrophic isolates have additional nutritional requirements to the prototrophic "wild types" of the species. A study was therefore carried out to determine whether the proportion of <b>auxotrophs</b> differs between stable and acutely ill patients, or correlates with the extent of underlying disease. METHODS [...] Sputum samples were cultured for P aeruginosa and tested for auxotrophy by spreading serial dilutions of homogenised sputum on to a minimal medium which supports only prototrophs, and a complete medium which supports both nutritional types. The proportion of <b>auxotrophs</b> to prototrophs was determined and growth factors of confirmed <b>auxotrophs</b> were identified. RESULTS [...] Thirty two (86 %) of 37 adults with cystic fibrosis infected with P aeruginosa harboured auxotrophs; methionine dependent mutants were isolated from seven of 16 patients tested (44 %). More than 50 % {{of the total number of}} colonies were auxotrophic in 19 of 26 samples (73 %) from patients with acute exacerbations and in only six of 15 samples (40 %) from clinically stable patients. In four patients from whom samples in both the acute and stable states were available, the proportion of <b>auxotrophs</b> fell in the sample taken when stable. <b>Auxotrophs</b> predominated in all samples from 11 of those patients with very severe underlying lung disease, in contrast to 13 of 30 samples from patients with less severe disease.

40|$|Abstract Bacteria {{are highly}} social and community-centric, despite being labeled as “single-celled” organisms. The {{communities}} that dominate bacterial lifestyles are called biofilms. Cells in a biofilm are protected {{from a variety}} of environmental insults that includes toxins, antibiotics, and immune defense mechanisms. Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) form biofilms outside the host to prolong survival, inside the host on catheters, and inside of bladder epithelial cells. Bacteria in biofilms self-produce a protective extracellular matrix (ECM) composed of proteins, sugars, and DNA. The transcription of UPEC ECM components, curli and cellulose, is activated via the CsgD protein. The projects presented here detail molecular pathways that influence production of the UPEC ECM. I have found that: 1) The production of both curli and cellulose is activated by the catabolite repressor protein, which activates transcription of csgD in the absence of glucose. 2) YfiR is a disulfide bonded periplasmic protein that misfolds in reducing conditions, which leads to constitutive production of cyclic di-GMP by YfiN and constitutive expression of cellulose. 3) Cysteine <b>auxotrophs</b> have uncoupled ECM production, producing decreased amounts of cellulose and increased amounts of curli compared to WT. Uncoupling of the ECM is {{due to the lack of}} thiol reductants in cysteine <b>auxotrophs.</b> Cellulose production is inhibited in cysteine <b>auxotrophs</b> through yfiR, possibly because YfiR is stabilized by the oxidative cellular environment.
