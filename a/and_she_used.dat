5|$|John Churchill died at Windsor in 1722, and Sarah {{arranged}} a large funeral for him. Their daughter, Henrietta, became duchess {{in her own}} right. Sarah {{became one of the}} trustees of the Marlborough estate, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>used</b> her business sense to distribute the family fortune, including the income for her daughter Henrietta.|$|E
5|$|Her {{journeys}} {{into the}} land of slavery put her at tremendous risk, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>used</b> a variety of subterfuges to avoid detection. Tubman once disguised herself with a bonnet and carried two live chickens to {{give the appearance of}} running errands. Suddenly finding herself walking toward a former owner in Dorchester County, she yanked the strings holding the birds' legs, and their agitation allowed her to avoid eye contact. Later she recognized a fellow train passenger as another former master; she snatched a nearby newspaper and pretended to read. Since Tubman was known to be illiterate, the man ignored her.|$|E
5|$|Sarah’s {{personal}} income was now considerable, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>used</b> {{the money to}} invest in land; she believed this would protect her from currency devaluation. The dowager duchess purchased Wimbledon manor in 1723, and rebuilt the manor house. Her wealth was so considerable that Sarah hoped to marry her granddaughter, Lady Diana Spencer, to Frederick, Prince of Wales, for which she would pay a massive dowry of £100,000. However, Robert Walpole, the First Lord of the Treasury (effectively the same as today's Prime Minister) vetoed the plan. Walpole, although a Whig, had alienated Sarah by supporting peace in Europe; she was also suspicious of his financial probity; and Walpole, in turn, mistrusted Sarah. Despite this, {{good relations with the}} royal family continued, and Sarah was occasionally invited to court by Queen Caroline, who attempted to cultivate her friendship.|$|E

5|$|Diablo Cody {{was first}} {{approached}} {{to write a}} screenplay by film producer Mason Novick, who had previously landed her a book deal for her memoir, , after discovering her blog about stripping. He persuaded her to adapt the book for the screen, but suggested that she first write a screenwriting sample to show studios; that sample became Juno. After deciding on an adoption storyline, Cody collected the stories of adoptees, birth parents and adoptive parents, including that of her then-husband, an adoptee who reunited with his birth parents after she wrote the film. She also found inspiration {{in the story of}} a close friend who had become pregnant in high school and used some details from her friend's experience in the film, such as mistreatment from an ultrasound technician. Much of Juno, however, was based on Cody's own high school experiences: She dated a tic-tac-loving boy similar to Paulie, she was best friends with a cheerleader like Leah, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>used</b> a hamburger phone identical to the one that appears in the film. After writing the screenplay over seven weeks in the Starbucks section of a Target store in Crystal, Minnesota, Cody compared writing to breathing, seeing Juno as an extension of herself.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of oil on her family's cotton plantation made Hogg very wealthy, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>used</b> this income {{to benefit the}} people of Texas. In 1929, she founded the Houston Child Guidance Center, which provides counseling for children with mental health problems or diagnoses and their families. Through her brother's will, she established the Hogg Foundation for Mental Health at the University of Texas at Austin in 1940. Hogg successfully ran for {{a seat on the}} Houston School Board in 1943, where she worked to remove gender and race as criteria for determining pay and established art education programs for black students. Hogg never married, and died in 1975. The Ima Hogg Foundation was the major beneficiary of her will, and carries on her philanthropic work today. Several annual awards have been established in her name, honoring her efforts to preserve cultural heritage in Texas.|$|E

25|$|In Värend, Sweden, Freyja {{could also}} arrive at Christmas night <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>used</b> {{to shake the}} apple trees {{for the sake of}} a good harvest and {{consequently}} people left some apples in the trees for her sake. However, it was dangerous to leave the plough outdoors, because if Freyja sat on it, it would no longer be of any use.|$|E
25|$|In 1930, {{at the age}} of 37, {{she married}} a banker, Henry Maxwell Andrews, and they {{remained}} nominally together, despite one public affair just before his death in 1968. West's writing brought her considerable wealth, and by 1940 she owned a Rolls-Royce and a grand country estate, Ibstone House, in the Chiltern Hills of southern England. During World War II, West housed Yugoslav refugees in the spare rooms of her blacked-out manor, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>used</b> the grounds as a small dairy farm and vegetable plot, agricultural pursuits that continued long after the war had ended.|$|E

25|$|During {{everyday}} {{interactions with}} other people Genie inconsistently applied what linguistic abilities she possessed, although her use of both vocabulary and grammar remained better in imitation than in her own spontaneous speech. Her ability and willingness to engage in verbal interactions steadily increased during her stay with the Riglers, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>used</b> her language to serve a progressively larger number of functions. Nonetheless, she continued to speak very little, {{and when she did}} talk it was almost always in utterances significantly shorter than she was actually able to spontaneously produce. Because of this, the scientists wrote that it was extremely difficult to analyze her comprehension and use of grammar in conversations.|$|E
25|$|By late {{afternoon}} Drake had {{slowed to a}} crawl due to her inability to keep up steam. Northern Wave still hovering nearby. The situation appeared hopeless until the steel freighter, Crescent City, came upon the struggling Drake. Crescent City was nearly {{twice the size of}} Drake <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>used</b> her massive hull to provide an artificial lee from the gale force wind. Michigans cook, Harry Brown, leaped toward Crescent City before the two vessels were close enough and was swallowed by Lake Superior. The rest of the crew waited until the hulls of the two ships were grinding together and all of them safely jumped to Crescent City by 17:00. Crescent City reached the Soo Locks with Michigan and Drake crews at 2:00 on 3 October 1901.|$|E
25|$|After the {{marriage}} of Mamie Gwinn to Alfred Hodder, Mary Garrett moved into the Deanery, where she resided until her death in 1915. Garrett {{was the daughter of}} John W. Garrett, the wealthy president of the B Railroad, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>used</b> her financial resources to help the fledgling Bryn Mawr College in a variety of ways, including extensive renovations to the Deanery building. The two large renovations of the Deanery, in 1894–1896 and 1908–1909, and the decoration of the interior were largely financed through Garrett. In addition, Thomas and Garrett decorated the interior and garden of the Deanery with art that they collected during their many travels from all over the world, such as the pair of stone dogs from a Mandarin's palace in Manchuria and inlaid tables from Damascus.|$|E

25|$|The {{scientists}} also measured Genie's conversational competence. Most verbal {{interactions with}} her consisted either of someone asking her a question several times until she responded or her saying something {{to which the}} other person responded, and unless she actively attempted to control a conversation's direction she relied on the other person to achieve and maintain its flow. She typically did not acknowledge statements, requests, or other common pieces of conversation, {{and when she did}} respond it was often with a significant delay. Curtiss wrote that Genie grew progressively better at both, although even by mid-1975 she did not always respond or took an unusually long time to do so. If she did respond she often repeated something said earlier, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>used</b> repetitive statements to serve several conversational functions.|$|E
25|$|After their {{liberation and}} a short period on Labuan Island for rest and recuperation, the Keiths {{returned}} to Victoria, British Columbia, where Harry had had a small country house since his bachelor days. In February 1946 {{he was asked to}} return to Borneo by the new Colonial Administration, which had taken over from the Chartered Company. He was {{to be in charge of}} food production. He agreed to go, so he and his family were split yet again. The couple remained in Victoria, and Agnes worked on her second book, an autobiographical account of her imprisonment: on her release Agnes had gathered up her notes and diary entries from their various hiding places, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>used</b> them as the basis for her book, Three Came Home, which was published in April 1947. It detailed the hardships and deprivations that the internees and POWs had undergone under the Japanese, and became a bestseller.|$|E

Later that year, she {{received}} her first computer as a Christmas gift from drummer and producer Ahmir [...] "Questlove" [...] Thompson, and began communicating with and receiving music from him and other producers such as Q-Tip and J Dilla. Beginning in 2005, Badu worked from her home in Dallas and used the software application GarageBand as a digital audio workstation, which she was introduced to by her son, Seven. He taught her how to use her laptop as a mini recording studio, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>used</b> it to construct various backing tracks for songs. Using GarageBand, she recorded demos of her vocals by singing into the computer's microphone.|$|E

500|$|In September 1930 Christie {{married the}} {{archaeologist}} Max Mallowan, whom she met when she visited the excavations at Ur in Mesopotamia. The pair travelled frequently on expeditions, where Christie would {{help with the}} finds, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>used</b> the experiences {{as a basis for}} her plots, including Murder on the Orient Express (1934), Murder in Mesopotamia 1936) and Death on the Nile (1937). She also wrote the autobiographical travel book Come, Tell Me How You Live (1946), which described their life in Syria; her biographer, Janet Morgan, reports that [...] "archaeologists have celebrated... contribution to Near Eastern exploration". Christie died in January 1976, her reputation as a crime novelist high. Her biographer, H. R. F. Keating, describes Christie as [...] "a towering figure in the history of crime literature", while her obituarist in The Times considers that, following the death of Dorothy L. Sayers in 1957, Christie was [...] "the undoubted queen of her profession".|$|E
