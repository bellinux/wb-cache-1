25|$|The {{site was}} {{discovered}} in 1982 when work began on building a road <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>pond</b> in a new housing development, Windover Farms. A backhoe operator noticed several skulls in the bucket of his machine. The sheriff and medical examiner determined that the burials were not recent. The local forensic expert originally believed he was examining modern Caucasian remains. The developers, Jack Eckerd and Jim Swann, halted construction at the pond and called in archaeologists. Radiocarbon dating on two bones excavated from the pond by the backhoe, {{paid for by the}} developers, yielded dates of 7,210 years and 7,320 years Before Present, establishing the importance of the find. The developers changed their development plans in order to leave the pond intact and donated $60,000 worth of pumping equipment to drain the pond for excavation.|$|E
25|$|After her {{breakthrough}} award-winning {{performance at}} the Royal Court Theatre in the improvised play Four in a Million, the BBC offered Ullman her own show. She was quickly cast in A Kick Up the Eighties and Three of a Kind. becoming the first British woman to be offered her own sketch comedy show. Her performance earned her a BAFTA award in 1984. She became a household name with the British media affectionately dubbing her 'Our Trace.' In 1983, she started a successful (and brief) music career, which extended itself <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>pond</b> in the United States. In 1985, she teamed with comedians Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders in the sitcom Girls on Top. Ullman's husband, Allan McKeown, a successful television producer, convinced her to take a gamble on a career in America. After turning down due to creative differences, she teamed with famed television and film producer James L. Brooks who had {{a deal with the}} yet-to-be launched Fox network. They created and launched a sketch comedy vehicle The Tracey Ullman Show in 1987. Ullman received critical acclaim and was rewarded with a slew of accolades. The show would go on to win the Fox network's first Emmy award. The Tracey Ullman Show, while American-based, included Ullman's British sensibility with a variety of British characters created for her to play alongside American. Cartoon bumpers, The Simpsons were featured in the show.|$|E

[...] The character is less well known outside the UK, but according to [...] director Adam McKay, [...] "every American comic knows who Steve is, whether it's Stiller or Ferrell or Jack Black or me ... and everyone watching those [...] DVDs had the same reaction.

2500|$|The {{same year}} Richardson {{released}} a feature-length film of Stella Street through his new production company. Richardson co-wrote {{and directed the}} film.

[...] while Michael Rechtshaffen in the Hollywood Reporter said [...] "What might have achieved a degree of cult status <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>pond</b> when it was aired in 10-minute installments, struggles to pass big-screen scrutiny in a feature-length treatment that hinges on the flimsiest of plot lines." [...] However Derek Elley in Variety thought it [...] "Manages to sustain its single-joke premise...over feature length." [...] The film opened in 10 screens in the USA and took $2,574 on the opening weekend.|$|E

40|$|Inland waters {{actively}} exchange gases {{with the}} atmosphere, {{and the gas}} exchange rate informs system biogeochemistry, ecology, and global carbon budgets. Gas exchange in medium- to large-sized lakes is largely regulated by wind; yet less is known about processes regulating gas transfer in small ponds where wind speeds are low. In this study, we determined the gas transfer velocity, k 600, in four small (3 ̆c 250 m 2) ponds by using a propane (C 3 H 8) gas injection. When estimated across 12 h periods, the average k 600 ranged from 0. 19 to 0. 72 m d- 1 <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>ponds.</b> We also estimated k 600 at 2 to 3 h intervals {{during the day and}} evaluated the relationship with environmental conditions. The average daytime k 600 ranged from 0. 33 to 1. 83 m d- 1 <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>ponds</b> and was best predicted by wind speed and air or air-water temperature; however, the explanatory power was weak (R 2 3 ̆c 0. 27) with high variability within and among ponds. To compare our results to larger water bodies, we compiled direct measurements of k 600 from 67 ponds and lakes worldwide. Our k 600 estimates were within the range of estimates for other small ponds, and variability in k 600 increased with lake size. However, the majority of studies were conducted on medium-sized lakes (0. 01 to 1 km 2), leaving small ponds and large lakes understudied. Overall, this study adds four small <b>ponds</b> to <b>the</b> existing body of research on gas transfer velocities from inland waters and highlights uncertainty in k 600, with implications for calculating metabolism and carbon emissions in inland waters...|$|R
60|$|Already, by {{the first}} of September, I had seen two or three small maples turned scarlet <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>pond,</b> beneath where the white stems of three aspens diverged, {{at the point of}} a promontory, next the water.

50|$|Miniaturization is the {{principle}} of evoking the entire of spirit of nature in a limited physical space (the Japanese Tea Garden of San Francisco is only 5 acres). It also encompasses the use of small stones and other small elements to represent the yin-yang. The Buddhist value of yin-yang expresses the incomplete and dynamic nature of everything around us. The yin-yang symbolizes multiple parts that come {{together to create a}} larger whole, and that nothing on its own is entirely whole or static. The coming together of water and stone is symbolic of the yin-yang in numerous locations throughout the San Francisco Japanese Tea Garden, as seen in the waterfalls, water basins made of stone, flat stones <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>ponds,</b> and waves in the stones of the dry Zen Garden.|$|R
