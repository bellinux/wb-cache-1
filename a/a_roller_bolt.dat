5000|$|The rifle fires the [...]223 Remington or 5.56×45mm NATO {{cartridge}} and feeds from a 10-, 20- or 30-round detachable magazine (depending on the {{variant of}} the rifle). Unlike earlier types of HK rifles, it is not <b>a</b> <b>roller</b> lock <b>bolt</b> but rather a lug-type rotating bolt system as seen on the AR-18.|$|R
2500|$|In contrast, the T44 {{prototype}} service rifle was not principally {{designed by}} any single engineer at Springfield Armory, but rather was a conventional design developed {{on a shoestring}} budget {{as an alternative to}} the T47. With only minimal funds available, the earliest T44 prototypes simply used T20E2 receivers fitted with magazine filler blocks and re-barreled for 7.62×51mm NATO, with the long operating rod/piston of the M1 replaced by the T47's gas cut-off system. [...] Lloyd Corbett, an engineer in Harvey's rifle design group, added various refinements to the T44 design, including a straight operating rod and <b>a</b> <b>bolt</b> <b>roller</b> to reduce friction.|$|R
50|$|The MG 3 is an automatic, air-cooled, belt-fed short recoil-operated firearm. It {{features}} <b>a</b> <b>roller</b> locked <b>bolt</b> {{mechanism that}} consists of the bolt head, <b>a</b> pair of <b>rollers,</b> the striker sleeve, bolt body and return spring. The bolt is locked securely by a wedge-shaped striker sleeve, which forces two cylindrical rollers contained in the bolt head outward, and into corresponding recesses in {{the extension of the}} breech of the barrel. On firing, both the barrel and barrel extension recoil to the rear. The resulting impact (much like a Newton's cradle) moves the carrier to the rear withdrawing the wedge and both rollers as they are cammed inward and out of their sockets by fixed cams, unlocking the bolt head. The bolt carrier and bolt then continue to the rear together guided by fixed guides while the barrel and barrel extension return to battery. Upon return of the bolt forward, the impact of the rollers against the camming surfaces on the breech carry the rollers from their seats, and, together with the surfaces on the striker sleeve, force the rollers outward, locking the bolt head into the barrel extension and ensuring a complete lock. The bolt also houses a spring-loaded casing extractor and ejector. Ejection is carried out when the ejector strikes the buffer head, sending a push forward through the ejector bar, which hits the ejector pin. This pin pushes the top of the base of the cartridge, which is still held by the extractor at the base, causing the empty casing to rotate and eject downward through the ejection chute.|$|R

50|$|The HK33 is a {{selective}} fire weapon with Heckler & Koch's roller-delayed blowback system of operation. It employs a two-piece bolt {{consisting of a}} bolt head with <b>a</b> pair of <b>rollers</b> and <b>bolt</b> carrier. Upon firing, the two cylindrical <b>rollers</b> in the <b>bolt</b> head are cammed inward by inclined surfaces of the barrel extension and impart a rearward motion on the locking piece, which also propels the bolt carrier rearward. This built-in mechanical disadvantage delays {{the movement of the}} bolt head relative to the bolt carrier which is withdrawing at four times the velocity of the <b>bolt.</b> The <b>rollers</b> soon compress entirely into the bolt head, clearing the locking recesses of the barrel extension, and both parts now continue rearward together, opening the breech and actuating the extraction and feeding cycles. The chamber is opened under very high pressure, thus the chamber received a series of flutes in order to increase extraction reliability and prevent sticking of the spent casing to the chamber walls.|$|R

50|$|At a given velocity, {{the longer}} <b>a</b> <b>roller</b> coaster train becomes, the more {{momentum}} it gains throughout the ride's course. <b>A</b> <b>roller</b> coaster train that is fully loaded {{will also have}} more momentum than one that is empty or nearly empty.|$|R
5000|$|<b>A</b> <b>roller</b> coaster train {{describes}} the vehicle(s) which transports passengers around <b>a</b> <b>roller</b> coaster's circuit. More specifically, <b>a</b> <b>roller</b> coaster train {{is made up}} of two or more [...] "cars" [...] which are connected by some sort of specialized joint. It is called a [...] "train" [...] because the cars follow one another around the track as a railroad train. Individual cars often vary in design and can carry anywhere from one to eight or more passengers each.|$|R
5|$|Rumors of <b>a</b> new <b>roller</b> coaster {{being built}} at Busch Gardens Tampa Bay began to {{circulate}} after <b>a</b> <b>roller</b> coaster enthusiast emailed {{the park and}} received a response saying that <b>a</b> <b>roller</b> coaster would be built. These rumors stated that the roller coaster would include a splashdown and an inversion on Bolliger & Mabillard's Dive Coaster, both a first for its kind. Later in the season, the park began to remove part of the track of Serengeti Express. On April 26, 2004, construction permits were discovered that confirmed that <b>a</b> <b>roller</b> coaster, restaurant, and gift shop would be constructed.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} numerically {{the relation}} between <b>a</b> <b>roller</b> and the pressure distribution to clarify {{the dynamics of the}} roller in circular hydraulic jumps. We found that <b>a</b> <b>roller</b> which characterizes <b>a</b> type II jump is associated with two high pressure regions after the jump, while a type I jump (without the roller) is associated with only one high pressure region.
