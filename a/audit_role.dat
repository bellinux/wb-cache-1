50|$|Salt spray {{testing is}} popular {{because it is}} {{relatively}} inexpensive, quick, well standardized, and reasonably repeatable. Although {{there may be a}} weak correlation between the duration in salt spray test and the expected life of a coating in certain coatings such as hot dip galvanized steel, this test has gained worldwide popularity due to low cost and quick results. Most Salt Spray Chambers today are being used NOT to predict the corrosion resistance of a coating, but to maintain coating processes such as pre-treatment and painting, electroplating, galvanizing, and the like, on a comparative basis. For example, pre-treated + painted components must pass 96 hours Neutral Salt Spray, to be accepted for production. Failure to meet this requirement implies instability in the chemical process of the pre-treatment, or the paint quality, which must be addressed immediately, so that the upcoming batches are of the desired quality. The longer the accelerated corrosion test, the longer the process remains out of control, and larger is the loss in the form of non-conforming batches.The principle application of the salt spray test is therefore enabling quick comparisons to be made between actual and expected corrosion resistance. Most commonly, the time taken for oxides to appear on the samples under test is compared to expectations, to determine whether the test is passed or failed. For this reason the salt spray test is most often deployed in a quality <b>audit</b> <b>role,</b> where, for example, {{it can be used to}} check the effectiveness of a production process, such as the surface coating of a metallic part.The salt spray test has little application in predicting how materials or surface coatings will resist corrosion in the real-world, because it does not create, replicate or accelerate real-world corrosive conditions. Cyclic corrosion testing is better suited to this.|$|E

40|$|Increasingly, governments use {{the private}} sector to deliver public services, {{creating}} a significant need for a method of evaluation. While there is copious detailed guidance on contract design, contract negotiation and contract completion and even the early operational stage of these 'private provision of public service' arrangements, there is little to no guidance on the mature operational stage. This paper considers the development of a theoretically and empirically based post project evaluation model. In developing a model, the researchers firstly find that Economy, Efficiency and Effectiveness (the 3 Es) are key for assessing value for money in private provision of public service arrangements and these concepts are central to any performance audit. The nature of the 3 Es is, however, dependent on the context of the activity under review. In order for evaluation to be effective, the 3 E and their context must be defined and outlined in the initial contract phase. Secondly, two <b>audit</b> <b>roles</b> need to be recognised and undertaken. These are the watchdog, in which information is provided to parliament and the public to establish accountability, and the sheepdog, in which public bodies are shepherded towards improved performance. These two roles must both be present in undertaking performance <b>audits.</b> These <b>audit</b> <b>roles</b> require dialogic evaluation in which the auditor acts as a 'critical interpreter', involved in active discourse with the actors, concerned about the success of the project being evaluated but, at the same time, able to 'interpret' and 'confront'. 25 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine {{attempts}} at jurisdictional expansion in the audit field. Specifically, the authors critically analyse the professional implications of "new audit spaces", that is, novel auditing and assurance services that have emerged at intersections between audit and other fields such as the environment, the public sector, sport and education. The purpose is two-fold. First, to better understand the dynamics of new audit spaces, and second, to highlight the major challenges and adaptations prompted by these dynamics. Design/methodology/approach - Drawing on Bourdieu’s theory of practice, the authors highlight and problematise four issues central to the construction of new audit spaces: independence; reporting; professional accreditation; and the nature of the <b>audit</b> <b>role.</b> Findings - The audit profession has experienced mixed success in seeking to annex new audit spaces; in some instances, practices initially located at the margins of auditing have moved towards its centre, while elsewhere projects have been abandoned, colonised by others or remain in flux. In these ventures, the accounting profession is brought into competition with other bodies of expertise and modes of practice. In new audit spaces, core elements of auditing, as conventionally conceived, are transmogrified as they travel. Originality/value - This analysis calls into question some of the "sacred cows" of auditing and challenges the transferability of the capitals and habitus of the accounting profession in other domains.

40|$|Purpose: This paper investigates auditor {{choice in}} those Italian non-listed firms {{adopting}} the ‘traditional’ model of corporate governance. In Italy, non-listed firms can choose between {{two types of}} auditor: the Board of Statutory Auditors (BSA), that is, the statutory auditors, or an ‘external’ auditor. At the same time, a BSA conducts the administrative auditing for all companies with equity exceeding 120, 000 euros. Design/Methodology/Approach: The paper estimates a logistic regression model of firm auditor choice between an external auditor and the BSA which incorporates variables proxying for both agency conflict and organizational complexity effects. Findings: Our results show that of the potential agency factors, only board independence drives auditor choice, whereas organizational complexity and risk factors including firm size, investment in inventories, subsidiary status and complexity drive auditor choice. These results may be explained in the administrative <b>audit</b> <b>role</b> of the BSA which both monitors day-by-day firm operations and the financial statements preparation ‘project’. Stakeholders as a result are reassured that in general their interests are protected. Finally, we find that legal form and voluntary IFRS compliance exert an impact on auditor choice. Originality/value: The paper provides support for an internal yet independent auditing body such as the Italian BSA as a wider model for corporate governance in European non-listed firms (OECD, 2004 and 2015). The BSA as an administrative and financial auditing body made up solely of independent highly qualified professionals can work within the firm on an operational basis, {{and in so doing}} can increase stakeholder protection...|$|E

40|$|Using {{a unique}} set of banking data {{containing}} both originally reported and subsequently revised financial variables, we study the incidence of adverse revisions to accounting statements. As might be expected, our findings indicate banks are more likely to underreport financial losses when their financial performance is substandard. In addition, we provide evidence that supervisory exams have an important role in uncovering financial problems and ensuring bank accounting statements reflect them. Specifically, our estimations point to a significant auditing effect, through which exams can lead to a restatement of financial results to reflect a greater degree of financial difficulty than originally reported. Interestingly, this <b>auditing</b> <b>role</b> of exams is evident not only for institutions previously identified as supervisory concerns, but also at highly rated banks, where financial problems are only just emerging. Because a banking downturn would increase not only the number of problem institutions requiring additional supervisory attention, but also the incidence of loss underreporting at highly rated banks, our findings stress the value of efforts to maintain or bolster the supervisory system's capacity to expand exam activity quickly and substantially.

40|$|This study {{reflects}} on the role, compromise and problems of the external auditor in the corporate governance with particular reference to the UK. The external auditor is an independent person or firm of auditors appointed by the shareholders to investigate the financial statements prepared by the management and report his findings to the shareholders. This study identifies the various instruments used by government and accountancy bodies to regulate {{the role of the}} auditor. The statutory role of the external auditors is to issue audit report of his opinion on true and fair view of the financial statements. The study indicates that the role of the external auditor is greatly facilitated by efficient and effective internal control system and with the cooperation of the audit committee. However, the study provides striking evidence that {{in the course of the}} <b>audit</b> <b>role,</b> some auditors compromise their professional integrity for economic gain. The big four firms provide a better picture of the professional compromise. Alongside this, it identifies corporate accounting scandal linked to the professional misconduct of the auditors. Furthermore, the problems frustrating the effective role of the auditor within the framework of the corporate governance were identified in the study as auditor’s independence, morality, public expectation and audit market cartel. In conclusion, the study shows that the role of the external auditor is inevitable for good corporate governance. However, to have effective role of the auditor, it is recommended among others that the regulatory body should be directly involved in the appointment of auditors of large companies...|$|E

Professors ranked Australian accounting departments on a variety of research, teaching and staffing attributes, on contributions to the accounting profession and provided an overall ranking of the departments. Overall rankings placed the University of Queensland and the University of New South Wales a close first and second, followed by the University of Sydney, the University of Melbourne, the University of Western Australia, and Monash University. Analysis of the separate sub-dimensions of performance shows that it is variations in respondents' perceptions of research-related performance of departments which accounts for variation in the overall ranking. We also asked the professors for their views on several issues facing accounting educators and those who recruit accounting graduates. Most believed that there should be more breadth in undergraduate accounting courses than is currently the case. However, most felt that recruiters would prefer degree structures to remain as they are. There was overwhelming consensus that it was reasonable to expect ethics to be taught in accounting programs; that the Australian Securities Commission should not replace corporate management in the appointment of auditors; and that accounting standards should not be written to force very conservative depictions of profitability and financial position. There was disparity of opinions on whether auditors ought to be expected to foreshadow financial distress; whether the <b>audit</b> <b>role</b> should be expanded to explicitly embrace fraud detection; and whether financial reports should be understandable to the lay person.

40|$|As {{the economies}} in Central Europe have {{commenced}} their transformation from centrally planned to market-led economies, each country has implemented a new legal framework for accounting and auditing. This provides {{a unique opportunity}} to research the implementation of aspects of accounting and auditing well known to Western market economies into different economic contexts. In particular, it provides an opportunity to revisit the role of the independent audit. This paper contributes to the research on the developing of auditing in Central Europe by analysing the role of the audit in the Czech Republic. It covers aspects of both regulation and practice and, in order to gain more understanding of how the <b>audit</b> <b>role</b> is developing in the Czech Republic, focuses on three areas: influences on the Czech audit legislation; the position of the audit report and perceptions of the objectives of the audit in the Czech Republic. After a brief review of the published literature on accounting and audit in the Czech Republic, the paper studies some of the country's recent economic and legislative developments in relation to auditing. These developments are put into the context of auditing before and after the 'Velvet revolution' of 1989. The paper then concentrates on the influences on the development of Czech audit legislation by comparing aspects of the Czech audit legislation with the German and UK equivalents. This comparison highlights some anomalies in the Czech legislation. The Czech audit legislation is then put into the local context based on a review of the contents of the audit report and its publication with interviews among a selection of users and preparers about how the audit is perceived. ...|$|E
