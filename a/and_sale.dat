40|$|Since 1970, the Taiwan government, in {{its effort}} to achieve a stable supply of {{vegetables}} and fruits to an urban area, has been trying to promote joint shipping <b>and</b> <b>sales</b> activities by farmers' organizations, such as agricultural cooperative associations, and to provide support to the production <b>and</b> <b>sales</b> teams who assist in such activities. Production <b>and</b> <b>sales</b> teams are joint shipping organizations consisting of members who have received agricultural training. In a traditional distribution system involving vegetables and fruits, the collecting and shipping of products is conducted by dealers who personally purchase products from farmers and supply them to a consumer city. As part of a drive to modernize such a traditional distribution system in the Taipei whole-sale market, farmers' organizations, such as agricultural cooperative associations, were established to carry out joint shipping <b>and</b> <b>sales.</b> Production <b>and</b> <b>sales</b> teams which support such activities as local organizations have been increasing in number. There have been no studies conducted in Japan on production <b>and</b> <b>sales</b> teams. Even in Taiwan, not much is understood of them since such studies are only conducted in a normative or formal way. Furthermore, production <b>and</b> <b>sales</b> teams are in disrepute among farmers' organizations, which could be attributed to the fact that such teams are organized in order to gain a subsidy and they often leave contracts with farmers' organizations unfulfilled. Nevertheless, production <b>and</b> <b>sales</b> teams have already become essential local entities in joint shipping <b>and</b> <b>sales</b> activities. As the Taiwan market is suffering from oversupply and falling prices, and with the emergence of large-scale discount stores and a large user, the distribution system for fruits and vegetables is under-going changes that also affect {{the very nature of the}} production <b>and</b> <b>sales</b> team. This paper addresses a new movement observed in production <b>and</b> <b>sales</b> teams which aims to distribute products to new markets based on a fact-finding survey conducted among such teams in Xiluozhen, Yunlin District, the largest production center in Taiwan. First, an overview of joint shipping activities and the direction of the policy regarding production <b>and</b> <b>sales</b> teams is given, followed by a summary of the characteristics of the teams based on organizational statistics. Finally, consideration is given of three examples of the production <b>and</b> <b>sales</b> teams located in Xiluozhen to clarify their new functions...|$|R

40|$|Our study {{focuses on}} the mindset {{differences}} between marketing <b>and</b> <b>sales</b> employees (e. g., short-term versus long-term orientation, result versus process orientation, and relationship versus product orientation) to explore {{issues related to the}} integration of activities performed by these two functional areas. Drawing from the research in social categorization and organizational diversity, a dual-process model of marketing-sales mindset differences is outlined. In this model, both the positive and negative aspects of marketing-sales mindset differences are examined. Specifically, two underlying processes, the social categorization process and the information processing process, are proposed to involve in the effect of mindset differences on marketing-sales integration. In the social categorization process, perceived marketing-sales mindset differences are proposed to be positively related to the relationship conflict between these two functions, indicating the negative aspect of marketing-sales mindset differences. In the information processing process, perceived marketing-sales mindset differences are proposed to be positively related to the perceived novelty of information sent between these two functions, indicating the positive aspect of marketing-sales mindset differences. This model also suggests that organizational identification moderates the social categorization process and cross-functional learning moderates the information processing process. Our study also explores the antecedents and consequence of the marketing-sales mindset differences. Specifically, three factors are proposed to affect the actual marketing-sales mindset differences: the selection of marketing <b>and</b> <b>sales</b> employees with cross-functional working experiences in both marketing <b>and</b> <b>sales</b> areas, the cross-functional training of current marketing <b>and</b> <b>sales</b> employees in both marketing <b>and</b> <b>sales</b> areas, <b>and</b> the adoption of the institutionalized organizational socialization tactics. In addition, marketing-sales mindset differences are also proposed to eventually affect the behavioral cooperation between marketing <b>and</b> <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> the subsequent firm performance. Methodologically, this dissertation also develops and validates a new scale of marketing <b>and</b> <b>sales</b> mindset to measure the marketing-sales mindset differences. I tested the conceptual framework by using a cross-sectional survey design collecting data from 88 matched pairs of senior marketing <b>and</b> <b>sales</b> executives from the same businesses. The empirical results generally support the proposed dual-process model of marketing-sales mindset differences. Specifically, the results show that perceived mindset differences are positively related to the relationship conflict between marketing <b>and</b> <b>sales,</b> <b>and</b> this relationship is moderated by the level of organizational identification in the sale data. Also, in both marketing <b>and</b> <b>sales</b> data, the results show that perceived mindset differences is positively related to the perceived novelty of information sent between marketing <b>and</b> <b>sales</b> when the level of cross-functional learning between marketing <b>and</b> <b>sales</b> is high. The results also show that percentage of marketing <b>and</b> <b>sales</b> employees with cross-functional working experience in both marketing <b>and</b> <b>sales</b> areas is negatively related to the actual marketing-sales mindset differences. These results suggests that firms can manage the marketing-sales mindset differences by developing strong organizational identification and by promoting high level of cross-functional learning between marketing <b>and</b> <b>sales.</b> Also, the results suggest that firm can adjust the level of the marketing-sales mindset differences by adjusting their organizational recruitment policy...|$|R
