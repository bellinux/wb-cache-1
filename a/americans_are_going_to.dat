Castro did not forgive the U.S. supply of arms to Batista during the revolution. On 5 June 1958, {{at the height of}} the revolution, he had written: [...] "The <b>Americans</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> pay dearly for what they are doing.

(The United States had stopped supplies to Batista in March 1958, but left its Military Advisory Group in Cuba). Thus, Castro had no intention to bow to the United States. [...] "Even though he did not have a clear blueprint of the Cuba he wanted to create, Castro dreamed of a sweeping revolution that would uproot his country's oppressive socioeconomic structure and of a Cuba that would be free of the United States".|$|E

5000|$|Critics {{state that}} the tax cuts, {{including}} those given to middle and lower income households, failed to spur growth. Critics have further stated that the cuts also increased the budget deficit, shifted the tax burden from the rich to the middle and working classes, and further increased already high levels of income inequality. [...] Economists Peter Orszag and William Gale described the Bush tax cuts as reverse government redistribution of wealth, [...] "shifting the burden of taxation away from upper-income, capital-owning households and toward the wage-earning households of the lower and middle classes." [...] Supporters argued that the tax brackets were still more progressive than the brackets from 1986 until 1992, with higher marginal rates on the upper class, and lower marginal rates {{on the middle class}} than established by either the Tax Reform Act of 1986 or the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990.Economist Simon Johnson wrote in 2010: [...] "The U.S. government doesn’t take in much tax revenue—at least 10 percentage points of GDP less than comparable developed economies—and it also doesn’t spend much except on the military, Social Security and Medicare. Other parts of government spending can be frozen or even slashed, but it just won’t make that much difference.

These variables will range from race and age to disabilities and medical conditions. The main purpose of this research is to model healthcare accessibility in a way that is understandable to those without any statistical background; and for those interested, they can adjust their lifestyles in order to access health care...|$|E

40|$|A {{considerable}} amount of research consistently finds is that the better educated, generally, earn more than the less educated. It is also believed that better work and technical skills are linked to education. For these and other reasons, researchers and policy makers have long pushed for increasing the educational attainment of the American population. And, indeed, over the 20 th Century, the American population has become highly educated {{to the point where}} a high school education is no longer seen as a path to better economic status. Rather, a college degree has taken that role. Since about mid- 20 th century more <b>Americans</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> college, and this may have important implications for income inequality? In this paper, I examine income inequality among four education classes (ECs) : those with less than a High School Diploma, those with a High School Diploma, those with some college, and those with a college degree or more. I compute Gini Coefficients for all four groups for the years 1950 to 2009 using the Decennial Census and the 2009 American Community Survey. I also present a brief analysis about the contribution each EC makes to the overall Gini Index. My results point out that income inequality was initially driven by those with less than a high school education, was passed onto those with a high school diploma, and in recent years has greatly increased due to those with a college education. Moreover, I found that wage inequality was greater among the college educated than among the other ECs...|$|E

[...] Louis Smith, whose work pre-dated Huntington's, discussed issues of congressional and judicial control over the military as well as executive civilian control of military matters.
