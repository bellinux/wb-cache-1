5|$|Clergy of the Church of England {{who were}} not bishops {{historically}} bore arms identical to a layman, with a shield, helm and crest, and no ecclesiastical hat. In England in 1976 a system for deans, archdeacons and canons was authorized by the College of Arms, allowing a black ecclesiastical hat, black or violet cords, and three violet or red tassels on each side. A priest uses {{a black and white}} cord with a single tassel on each side, and a deacon <b>a</b> <b>hat</b> without tassels. A Doctor of Divinity may have cords interwoven with red and <b>a</b> <b>hat</b> appropriate to the degree, and members of the Ecclesiastical Household add a Tudor rose {{on the front of the}} hat. According to Boutell's Heraldry, this system represents the practice of the Church in England in the 16th century.|$|E

Even though grey hat hackers may not necessarily perform hacking for their personal gain, unauthorized access to a system can be considered illegal and unethical.|$|R

5|$|Bakshi's frustrations {{with his}} failing {{marriage}} {{and the state of}} the planet further drove his need to animate. In 1959, he moved his desk to join the rest of the animators; after asking Rasinski for material to animate, he received layouts of two scenes: <b>a</b> <b>hat</b> floating on water and Deputy Dawg, the lead character of one of Terrytoons' syndicated television series, running. Despite threats of repercussion from the animators' union, Rasinski fought to keep Bakshi as a layout artist. Bakshi began to see Rasinski as a father figure; Rasinski, childless, was happy to serve as Bakshi's mentor.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the extreme}} {{difficulty}} of the competition, several stages of preparation are needed. The first is the food drop, when mushers and race officials position caches of food and supplies at race checkpoints. This is necessary because mushers may only use their supplies along the route, reflecting the Gold Rush era, when dog trains would resupply at points along the trail. One week after the food drop, all dogs participating in the race undergo a preliminary veterinarian inspection to ensure they are healthy enough to race 1,000miles in subarctic conditions. The final stage of formal preparation is {{two days before the}} race, when mushers pick their starting order from <b>a</b> <b>hat.</b>|$|E

50|$|If B < W {{then those}} wearing <b>a</b> black <b>hat</b> will see B−1 black hats and W white hats, whilst those wearing <b>a</b> white <b>hat</b> will see B black hats and W−1 white hats.
