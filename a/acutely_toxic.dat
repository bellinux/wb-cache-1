40|$|Abstract- Silver sulfide, {{silver thiosulfate}} complex and silver {{chloride}} complexes were tested and compared with free silver ion for their toxic effects in 96 -h flow-through acute toxicity tests using fathead minnows (Pimephules promelus). Thirty-day fathead minnow embryo-larval {{tests were conducted}} with silver sulfide and silver thiosulfate complex. Extensive chemical analyses were performed to quantify actual exposures. Compared with free silver ion, silver chloride complexes were about 300 times less <b>toxic</b> <b>acutely,</b> silver sulfide was at least 15, 000 times less <b>toxic</b> <b>acutely</b> and silver thiosulfate complex was more than 17, 500 times less <b>toxic</b> <b>acutely.</b> The estimated maximum acceptable toxicant concentrations (MATCs) determined from the embryo-larval tests with silver sulfide and silver thiosulfate complex were greater than 1 1 mglL (as total silver) and greater than 16 but less than 35 mglL (as total silver), respectively. The MATC previously reported for free silver ion from tests with rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri] was greater than 0. 00009 but less than 0. 00017 mglL. These differences in acute toxicities and the differences of five orders of magnitude in the MATC values are attributed {{to the influence of}} chemical speciation on the effects of silver in the aquatic environment. Thus, the speciation of silver is an essential factor in its potential to affect fish and, presumably, other aquatic life, and therefore should be considered in environmental risk assessment...|$|R
40|$|Exposure to {{mixtures}} of toxicants (e. g., pesticides) {{is common in}} real life and a subject of current concern. The present investigation was undertaken to assess some toxicological effects in male rats following exposure to methomyl (MET), abamectin (ABM), and their combination (MET+ABM), and to evaluate the ameliorative effect of zinc co-administration. Three groups of rats were designated for MET, ABM, and the mixture treatments. Three other groups were designated for zinc {{in conjunction with the}} pesticides. Additionally, one group received water only (control), and the other represented a positive zinc treatment. The obtained results revealed that MET was <b>acutely</b> more <b>toxic</b> than ABM. The tested pesticides induced significant elevation in lipid peroxidation and catalase levels, while declined the levels of the other tested parameters e. g., Superoxide dismutase (SOD), Glutathione-S-transferase (GST), Glutathione peroxidase (GPx), Glutathione reductase (GR), Cytochrome P 450 (CYP 450), testosterone, and thyroxine). Biochemical alterations induced by the mixture were greater than those recorded for each of the individual insecticides. The joint action analysis, based on the obtained biochemical data, revealed the dominance of antagonistic action among MET and ABM. Zinc supplementation achieved noticeable ameliorative effects. It was concluded that zinc may act as a powerful antioxidant, especially in individuals who are occupationally exposed daily to low doses of such pesticides...|$|R

Water hyacinth leaf protein concentrate (WHLPC) was extracted in edible form and determination of its physicochemical characteristics, total alkaloids and phenolic compounds was done. Analysis of proximate composition and amino acid profile of the WHLPC was also done. The level of heavy metals (mg/kg) in WHLPC {{was found to be}} Cd (0. 02 ± 0. 001), Cr (0. 13 ± 0. 001), Pd (0. 003 ± 0. 001) and Hg (0. 02 ± 0. 001) while concentrations of Pb, Pt, Sn, Fe, Cu, Zn, Ni and Co were found to be 0. 001 ± 0. 00.

40|$|Abstract. Selenium {{poisoning}} {{in humans}} is reviewed {{from the perspective}} of the clinical laboratory. While evaluation of selenium poisoning is straightforward when the analytic results are markedly elevated and the patient is <b>acutely</b> symptomatic, distinguishing <b>toxic</b> from non-toxic elevations is a more frequent issue and more challenging. A significant problem is that selenium is determined as its total concentration in spite of the fact that different chemical forms of selenium have different toxic potentials. In the published reports reviewed herein, serum selenium concentrations span the following ranges: 400 - 30, 000 μg/L associated with acute toxicity, 500 - 1400 μg/L associated with chronic toxicity, and 1400 μg/L. Tissue selenium levels show a complex pattern and significant elevations in organs such as kidney are not always indicative of toxicity.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that gene {{expression}} profiles change in the livers of animals treated <b>acutely</b> with <b>toxic</b> chemicals such as carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4). This study was undertaken to evaluate the changes in gene expression in mouse liver immedi-ately after a long-term treatment with CCl 4 and possible effects of treatment cessation on these changes. Adult 129 /SvpcJ mice were treated twice a week with CCl 4 at 1 ml/kg in olive oil for 4 weeks. Hepatic pathological changes observed in the CCl 4 -treated mice included necrosis, inflammation, and fibrosis, along with increased serum alanine aminotransferase activities. Consistent with these changes, expression of genes involved in cell death, cell prolifera-tion, metabolism, DNA damage, and fibrogenesis were upregu-lated as detected by microarray analysis and confirmed by real-time RT-PCR. Four weeks after CCl 4 treatment cessation, the pathological changes were recovered, with the exception of fibro-sis, which was not completely reversed. Most of the gene expres-sion profiles also returned to the control level; however, the fibro-genetic genes remained at a high level of expression. These results demonstrate that changes in gene expression profile correlate with pathological alterations in the liver in response to CCl 4 intoxica-tion. Most of these changes are recoverable upon withdrawal of the toxic insult. However, liver fibrosis is a prolonged change both in gene expression and histopathological alterations.

In this paper, the authors highlight {{the contents of}} the chapter 3, Biomonitoring Test Procedures, identify current trends in test procedures and introduce the concept of biological criteria (biocriteria). The book chapter (and this paper) focuses on freshwater and marine chronic and acute toxicity tests used in the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits program to identify effluents and receiving waters containing <b>toxic</b> materials in <b>acutely</b> or chronically <b>toxic</b> concentrations. The two major categories of toxicity tests include acute tests and chronic tests. The USEPA chronic tests required in NPDEs permits have been shortened to 7 days by focusing on the most sensitive life-cycle stages; these tests are often referred to as short-term chronic tests. The type of test(s) required depend on NPDES permit requirements, objectives of the test, available resources, requirements of the test organisms, and effluent characteristics such as variability in flow or toxicity. The permit writer will determine the requirements for toxicity test(s) by considering such factors as dilution, effluent variability, and exposure variability. Whether the required test is acute or chronic, the objective of the test is to estimate the safe or no effect concentration which is defined as the concentration which will permit normal propagation of fish and other aquatic life in the receiving waters.

Cadmium and selenium, which are the major components {{of the majority of}} quantum dots, are known to be <b>acutely</b> and chronically <b>toxic</b> to cells and organisms. Protecting the core of nanoparticles can, to some degree, control the toxicity related to cadmium and selenium leakage. Results This study successfully synthesized and characterized maltodextrin coated cadmium sulfide semiconductor nanoparticles. The results show that CdS-MD nanoparticles are cytotoxic and embryotoxic. CdS-MD nanoparticles in low concentrations (4. 92 and 6. 56 nM) lightly increased the number of HepG 2 cell. A reduction in MDA-MB- 231 cells was observed with concentrations higher than 4. 92 nM in a dose response manner, while Caco- 2 cells showed an important increase starting at 1. 64 nM. CdS-MD nanoparticles induced cell death by apoptosis and necrosis in MDA-MD- 231 cells starting at 8. 20 nM concentrations in a dose response manner. The exposure of these cells to 11. 48 - 14. 76 nM of CdS-MD nanoparticles induced ROS production. The analysis of cell proliferation in MDA-MB- 231 showed different effects.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to: ° Report on the {{occurrence}} of mycotoxins in grain and grain products in South Africa; ° Compare with other countries; ° Weigh the evidence regarding effects on health of test animals, and human and animal consumers; ° Determine the need for statutory measures to regulate mycotoxins in food; and ° Propose practical measures for controlling mycotoxins in grain and grain products in South Afica. Good mycotoxin data for maize were obtained from the author's surveys. Data on other local grains is lacking. In domestic maize, fumonisins and deoxynivalenol occur regularly, at levels as low or lower than in Argentina and the USA. Other mycotoxins occur rarely, or at very low levels. Deoxynivalenol is likely to occur regularly in domestic wheat. Aflatoxins were virtually absent in domestic maize, but often occur at concerning levels in imported Argentinean and USA maize. The literature show that aflatoxins are <b>acutely</b> and chronically <b>toxic</b> to humans and animals and most countries maintain regulatory Maximum Tolerable Levels (MTLs) for aflatoxins in grain and grain products. Several countries also maintain regulatory MTLs for deoxynivalenol, based on lesser scientific evidence. The mycotoxin that occurs most frequently in South African maize, is the fumonisin B group of analogues, with fumonisin B 1 the most abundant. Fumonisins are produced by Fusarium verticillioides (previously known as Fusarium moniliforme) and occur in maize worldwide. Fumonisins cause leukoencephalomalacia in horses, pulmonary oedema in pigs, liver cancer in rats and liver and kidney damage in other animals. A statistical relationship between the occurrence of F. verticillioides and fumonisins in maize and oesophageal cancer in humans has been demonstrated in Transkei and in China. The 'toxins derived from F. moniliforme' and fumonisin B 1 have been evaluated as Group 2 B carcinogens i. e. possibly carcinogenic to humans, by the International Agency for Research on Cancer of the World Health Organisation. Based on a review of epidemiological and toxicological evidence of the effects of fumonisins on humans and animals, their occurrence in maize and maize products, previously proposed MTLs, and the practical implications of MTLs set for maize and maize products, we propose the following MTLs for total fumonisins in maize and maize products for human consumption: ° 4 µg/g in whole, uncleaned maize; ° 2 µg/g in dry-milled maize products with fat content of > 3. 0 %, dry weight basis (e. g., sifted and unsifted maize meal); and ° 1 µg/g in dry-milled maize products with fat content of < 3. 0 %, dry weight basis (e. g., flaking grits, brewers grits, samp, maize rice, super and special maize meal) These MTLs are too high to address a possible link of fumonisins with neural tube defects in neonates. This potential problem remains to be addressed, possibly by fortification of maize products with folic acid. We propose MTLs for deoxynivalenol of 2 µg/g in cereal grains for food use, and 1 µg/g in cereal grain food products. Finally, we propose that the current regulatory MTLs for aflatoxins be raised from 10 ng/g (total aflatoxins in unprocessed maize) to 20 ng/g. Dissertation (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2004.

40|$|Declines in {{some fish}} {{populations in the}} Upper Danube River, Germany, have been {{reported}} during the past decades despite extensive stocking efforts. Many theories exist for why such declines have occurred including habitat change, dams, invasive species, disease and pollution. One of the factors of concern in the Upper Danube River is pollution because {{a number of studies}} have shown that sediments collected from this area were <b>acutely</b> and/or chronically <b>toxic</b> to fish. Although it can be difficult to link bioassay results to direct effects on the population level, bioassays can give us insight into the potential of exposure of wildlife including fish to sediment. In combination with other researchers a large battery of sediment testing on the Upper Danube River is being performed. Testing includes sediment testing of estrogen receptor mediated processes, dioxin-like responses and genotoxic effects. In this study, four sediment extracts from the Upper Danube River in Germany were used with a novel fractionation technique to characterize the sediment extracts and fractions for their ability to disrupt steroidogenesis, for their mutagenic activities and their teratogenic effects. Fractionation of each of the four sediment samples was performed by separating compounds according to their polarity, planarity, and the size of the aromatic ring system in an on-line fractionation procedure on coupled high performance liquid chromatography columns. Mutagenic activity was measured in the raw sediment extracts and all 18 fractions using the Ames fluctuation assay and the Danio rerio embryo assay was used to assess lethal endpoints. Furthermore, disruptions of steroidogenesis were assessed by first establishing methods and a proof of concept of the H 295 R assay by exposing H 295 R cells to 7 model chemicals and measuring changes from a control in estradiol, testosterone and aromatase activity. Once methods were established all sediments and their fractions were analyzed using the Assay. Specifically, in the Danio rerio assay, two raw sediment extracts killed 100 % of Danio rerio embryos at a concentration of 33. 3 mg sediment equivalents (SEQ) /ml, but none of the 18 fractions of these samples produced any measured toxicity at a concentration of 100 mg SEQ/ml. In the Ames fluctuation assay, significant mutagenic activity was measured in raw sediment extracts and in the fractions. Fraction 10 produced a significant mutagenic response in all sediment samples measured only in S 9 bio-activated samples. Furthermore, fraction 15 produced a significant mutagenic response in all sediment samples measured only in non bio-activated samples. All raw extracts tested in the H 295 R assay caused an increase in estradiol production up to 4 -fold from controls. Testosterone production increased slightly from controls in only two of the raw extract samples. Of the 18 fractions, fractions 7, 10 and 15 increased estradiol in at least three of the samples studied (Sigmaringen 2006, Opfingen 2006, Lauchert 2006 and Lauchert 2004). Furthermore, fraction 7 significantly decreased testosterone production compared to controls in three of the four sediment samples. Taken as a whole, these results show the value of using multiple bioassays and fractionation to characterize sediments that covers a variety of different biological endpoints. This study also demonstrates the usefulness of the H 295 R assay when combined with a new fraction technique to assess endocrine disrupting chemicals in sediment samples...|$|R
