500|$|He remixed Kanye West's song, [...] "Diamonds from Sierra Leone", {{renaming}} the {{new version}} as [...] "Conflict Diamonds". With this remix, Fiasco wished {{to raise awareness of}} the conflict diamond business. This caught West's attention, and he asked Fiasco to perform on the song [...] "Touch the Sky" [...] for West's album Late Registration. The song, which sampled Curtis Mayfield's [...] "Move On Up", became a hit in the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number forty-two. After this success, Fiasco's first single [...] "Kick, Push" [...] was released earlier than expected. The song was a love story about two people sharing a passion for skateboarding, a topic generally not discussed in hip-hop. [...] Fiasco explained, [...] " [...] just as deep as hip-hop. I'm not the greatest skateboarder, but I'm <b>a</b> <b>damn</b> <b>good</b> rapper, so I made <b>a</b> <b>damn</b> <b>good</b> skateboarding song." [...] The single, and its accompanying music video, helped Fiasco get attention in the hip-hop community, and was later nominated for two 2007 Grammy Awards. During this time, he recorded guest performances on Tha' Rayne's [...] "Kiss Me" [...] and [...] "Didn't You Know" [...] singles, and also on K Foxx's 2004 [...] "This Life".|$|E
500|$|In {{the context}} of the {{turbulent}} political climate of 1968, [...] "Piggies" [...] was adopted by the counterculture as an anti-establishment theme song. It was also among the tracks on The Beatles that cult leader Charles Manson used as the foundation for his Helter Skelter theory of an American race-related countercultural revolution. Inspired especially by the line [...] "What they need's <b>a</b> <b>damn</b> <b>good</b> whacking", Manson's followers left clues relating to the lyrics at the scenes of the Tate–LaBianca murders in August 1969.|$|E

500|$|According to Chell's granddaughter, his Italian ancestry {{led him to}} {{call the}} drink a [...] "Caesar". [...] The longer name of [...] "Bloody Caesar" [...] is said to {{differentiate}} the drink from the Bloody Mary, but Chell {{said it was a}} regular patron at the bar who served as the inspiration. [...] During the three months he spent working to perfect the drink, he had customers sample it and offer feedback.

500|$|During Harrison's Liverpool {{visit in}} early 1968, his mother, Louise, responded to his request for {{assistance}} with the lyrics by providing the line [...] "What they need's <b>a</b> <b>damn</b> <b>good</b> whacking". Harrison then taped a demo of the song at his house in Esher, Surrey, in late May that year. Following this recording, John Lennon supplied the final phrase in the line [...] "Clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon", replacing the words [...] "to cut their pork chops", which Harrison had sung on the demo version. When performing [...] "Piggies" [...] in concert during the early 1990s, Harrison reinstated the omitted final verse.|$|E
500|$|Charles Manson {{first heard}} the album not long after it was released. He had already claimed to find hidden {{meanings}} in songs from earlier Beatles albums, but in The Beatles he interpreted prophetic significance {{in several of the}} songs, including [...] "Blackbird", [...] "Piggies" [...] (particularly the line [...] "what they need's <b>a</b> <b>damn</b> <b>good</b> whacking"), [...] "Helter Skelter", [...] "Revolution 1" [...] and [...] "Revolution 9", and interpreted the lyrics as a sign of imminent violence or war. He played the album repeatedly to his followers, the Manson family, and convinced them that it was an apocalyptic message predicting an uprising of oppressed races, drawing parallels with chapter 9 of the Book of Revelation.|$|E

500|$|In the Philippines, Mikhail Lecaros of GMA News {{praised the}} action scenes as [...] "technically {{polished}} while simultaneously visceral [...] even intimate [...] in their brutality". Writing for Rappler, Carljoe Javier expressed {{hope that the}} film would [...] " [...] as a shot of adrenaline, {{not only to the}} hearts of viewers, but hopefully also to mainstream cinema". Mari-An Santos of Philippine Entertainment Portal highly recommended it as [...] "a well-crafted film, from script to direction and acting to post-production ... it's <b>a</b> <b>damn</b> <b>good</b> film". Phillip Cu-Unjieng of Philippine Daily Inquirer praised the ensemble cast as [...] "top-notch" [...] and the film as [...] "dark, brooding, muscular and visceral, yet complex and concise in its story-telling".|$|E
500|$|Matt Collar, {{writing for}} AllMusic, {{declared}} [...] "The record's collaborative foundation crackles on every track, but Hayley Williams, a ballsy, extroverted frontwoman {{with a voice}} big enough to stop time, proves unequivocally to be the cunning talent of the band, no matter how vital York and Davis may be". Collar regards it their best album. At AbsolutePunk, Jack Appleby said [...] "Instead of pursuing all things epic or intentionally moving to a specific sound, the band had a blast pursuing every genre under the sun, creating <b>a</b> <b>damn</b> <b>good</b> album in the process...Chances are you won't dedicate undivided attention to Paramore, but you'll regularly queue the whole record." [...] He concluded with that the album isn't for everyone, but has something that anyone could enjoy.|$|E
500|$|Record Mirror {{remarked that}} the birdsong effects of [...] "Blackbird" [...] were {{replaced}} by [...] "snorts and grunts" [...] on [...] "Piggies", which the reviewer described as [...] "a society beef (or pork if you like)" [...] {{in the style of}} folk singer Roy Harper. Writing in Rolling Stone, Jann Wenner considered the song to be [...] "an amazing choice to follow 'Blackbird'", given the contrast between the two pieces – [...] "'Blackbird' so encouraging, 'Piggies' so smug (though accurate: 'what they need's <b>a</b> <b>damn</b> <b>good</b> whacking').

Duffy herself was quoted as saying that she wanted to honour the tradition of poets who were soldiers.|$|E
500|$|According to MacDonald, the {{counterculture}} of the 1960s analysed The Beatles {{above and beyond}} all of the band's previous releases. The album's lyrics progressed from being vague to open-ended and prone to misinterpretation, such as [...] "Glass Onion" [...] (e.g., [...] "the walrus was Paul") and [...] "Piggies" [...] ("what they need's <b>a</b> <b>damn</b> <b>good</b> whacking"). The release also coincided with public condemnation of Lennon's treatment of Cynthia, and of his and Ono's joint projects, particularly Two Virgins. The British authorities similarly displayed a less tolerant attitude towards the Beatles, when London Drug Squad officers arrested Lennon and Ono in October 1968 for marijuana possession, a charge that he claimed was false. In the case of [...] "Back in the U.S.S.R.", the words were interpreted by Christian evangelist David Noebel as further proof of the Beatles' compliance in a Communist plot to brainwash American youth.|$|E

500|$|In {{response}} to the season premiere, Oscar Dahl of Buddytv.com noted the predictability of the series, but expressed hope in its further development, by stating {{that it has become}} [...] "a medical chick flick, but <b>a</b> <b>damn</b> <b>good</b> one" [...] with a big and attractive cast. He also praised the interaction between the characters, noting the [...] "smart" [...] dialogue that helps each character evolve. However, Dahl expressed disappointment in the over emotional scenes, describing them as [...] "off-putting" [...] and [...] "not believable", while comparing them to real life interactions between people who emote in a more subtle manner than displayed on television. [...] "Emotions ran high in the premiere and there was much crying", stated Dahl, but noted that the dialogue, who he had previously been worried would be [...] "too cutesy", was not bothering, and rather realistic, noting how the show is [...] "smartly written". He also described the acting of Ellen Pompeo and Katherine Heigl as [...] "worthy of attention".|$|E

500|$|Musician and cult leader Charles Manson {{interpreted}} several {{songs on}} The Beatles as an inducement for his followers, {{known as the}} Manson Family, {{to carry out a}} series of murders in Los Angeles in August 1969. Inspired by the line [...] "What they need's <b>a</b> <b>damn</b> <b>good</b> whacking", Manson adopted [...] "Piggies" [...] as one of the tracks to justify such attacks on the White bourgeoisie. Believing that the Beatles were instructing him through their music, Manson envisioned these attacks as the prelude to an apocalyptic racial war between the establishment and the Black community that would leave him and his followers to rule America on counterculture principles. At the scenes of the murders of Sharon Tate, Leno and Rosemary LaBianca, Gary Hinman and others, the words [...] "Political Piggy", [...] "Pig" [...] and [...] "Death to Pigs" [...] were written on the walls with the victims' blood.

Robert Rodriguez's action exploitation film Machete opened in September 2010. In the film, Lohan's character takes drugs, is naked in much of her appearance, and later dons a nun's habit while toting a machine gun. Its critical reviews were mixed. The Washington Post described her character as [...] "a campier, trampier version of herself – or at least her tabloid image." [...] Premiere.com said she was [...] "terrible" [...] while Variety called it [...] "her best work in some time." [...] Because of her rehabilitation and legal engagements, Lohan did not participate in promotion of the movie. Lohan filmed a sketch where she is dressed as Marilyn Monroe for Inappropriate Comedy in 2010. The film had issues finding a distributor and was not released until 2013, when it was met with poor box office and critical reception. Lohan appeared on the October 2010 cover of Vanity Fair.
