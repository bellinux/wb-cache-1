5000|$|The Big Four are {{the four}} largest {{international}} professional services networks, offering <b>audit,</b> <b>assurance,</b> tax, consulting, advisory, actuarial, corporate finance, and legal services. They handle {{the vast majority}} of audits for publicly traded companies as well as many private companies, creating an oligopoly in auditing large companies. It is reported that the Big Four audit 99% of the companies in the FTSE 100, and 96% of the companies in the FTSE 250 Index, an index of the leading mid-cap listing companies. The Big Four firms are shown below, with their latest publicly available data. None of the Big Four firms is a single firm; rather, they are professional services networks. Each is a network of firms, owned and managed independently, which have entered into agreements with other member firms in the network to share a common name, brand and quality standards. Each network has established an entity to co-ordinate the activities of the network. In one case (KPMG), the co-ordinating entity is Swiss, and in three cases (Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, PricewaterhouseCoopers and Ernst & Young) the co-ordinating entity is a UK limited company. Those entities do not themselves perform external professional services, and do not own or control the member firms. They are similar to law firm networks found in the legal profession. In many cases each member firm practises in a single country, and is structured to comply with the regulatory environment in that country. In 2007 KPMG announced a merger of four member firms (in the United Kingdom, Germany, Switzerland and Liechtenstein) to form a single firm. Ernst & Young also includes separate legal entities which manage three of its four areas: Americas, EMEIA (Europe, The Middle East, India and Africa), and Asia-Pacific. (Note: the Japan area does not have a separate area management entity). These firms coordinate services performed by local firms within their respective areas but do not perform services or hold ownership in the local entities. This group was once known as the [...] "Big Eight", and was reduced to the [...] "Big Six" [...] and then [...] "Big Five" [...] by a series of mergers. The Big Five became the Big Four after the demise of Arthur Andersen in 2002, following its involvement in the Enron scandal.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The current {{experimental}} study {{addressed the issue}} of whether providing <b>audit</b> <b>assurance</b> on information released by a firm can reduce the uncertainty associated with the reliability of such information. The purpose of the current study is to examine how relatively unsophisticated investors respond to independent <b>audit</b> <b>assurance</b> on firm-released news announcements. This study contributes to extant understanding of how investors respond to auditor assurance, as it is the only study of this nature, to our knowledge, involving participants who possess a considerably low level of knowledge in the areas of accounting, auditing and investing (i. e., graduate liberal arts majors); yet, unsophisticated investors of this profile reflect a growing proportion of the individual investing community. Additionally, consideration needs to be given to the cost/benefit of contracting for audit assurances. The research indicates that there appear to be clear benefits from providing such assurances...|$|E

Enterprise Information Systems (EIS) that run their activities in the form of processes require continuous auditing of a process that invokes the action(s) speci ed in the policies and rules in a continuous manner and/or sometimes in real-time.

40|$|Previous {{literature}} has provided mixed {{evidence of a}} premium in audit fee for industry-specialist auditors in US and other developed countries. In this cross-country study spanning twelve non-US countries, we provide evidence of such a premium in the international context, implying that specialist auditors provide {{a higher level of}} investor assurance than non-specialists. Further, we show that the average audit fee in countries with effective legal, extra-legal and political institutions is higher but the specialization premium is lower than in other countries. We interpret this finding as evidence that while effective institutions increase the demand for average level of <b>audit</b> <b>assurance,</b> they substitute rather than complement the incremental assurance provided by specialist auditors. This finding is reinforced by additional analysis that shows no significant specialization premium in the US, a country where institutions are most conducive to high financial statement assurance...|$|E

These companies experience no change in <b>audit</b> <b>assurance,</b> although they can now reveal {{for the first time}} their desire to be audited. We find that these companies attract upgrades to their credit ratings because they send a positive signal by submitting to an audit when this is no longer legally required. In contrast, companies that dispense with being audited suffer downgrades to their ratings because avoiding an audit sends a negative signal and removes its assurance value...|$|E
40|$|Errors in {{spreadsheet}} {{applications and}} models are alarmingly common (some authorities, with justification cite spreadsheets containing errors as the norm {{rather than the}} exception). Faced with this body of evidence, the auditor can be faced with a huge task - the temptation may be to launch code inspections for every spreadsheet in an organisation. This can be very expensive and time-consuming. This paper describes risk assessment based on the "SpACE" audit methodology used by H M Customs & Excise's tax inspectors. This allows the auditor to target resources on the spreadsheets posing the highest risk of error, and justify the deployment of those resources to managers and clients.

40|$|The use of {{fair value}} {{accounting}} in financial statements has significantly {{increased in the}} last couple of decades. Standard-setters and preparers of financial information have both started to favor this accounting practice over cost-based methods like historical cost accounting. The increased use of fair value accounting has had significant impacts on the reliability and estimation uncertainty of financial statement information. This in turn affects auditors and their ability to provide the required level of <b>audit</b> <b>assurance.</b> The purpose of this thesis is to review earlier literature and studies of these themes. The examined literature includes articles about the reliability, decision usefulness and uncertainty of fair value accounting. I will also examine literature about the implications of the use of complex estimates and fair value accounting for the auditors, auditing processes and standards. Based on the previous studies and literature about fair value accounting, it can be argued that especially the values that don’t have observable market values and thus have to be measured using management’s assumptions and valuation models, contain a significant amount of estimation uncertainty and subjectivity. In consequence of this, it is very difficult to determine if these values are accurate and reliable. The previous literature about the effects of fair value accounting on auditors suggests, that currently auditors are not fully able to answer the challenges it presents. Improving auditors’ ability to provide the required level of <b>audit</b> <b>assurance</b> would require for instance broadening their knowledge (especially regarding valuation techniques), improving the current regulation and standards, and making changes to the format of financial statements. In light of the findings and conclusions of previous literature presented in this essay, it can be argued that the challenges of fair value accounting and especially its impacts on auditing need to be addressed by standard-setters, auditors and preparers of financial statements, so that the reliability of financial information and quality of audits would be ensured in the future...|$|E

We {{find that the}} probability of firms disclosing ICWs is not only associated with firm characteristics such as profitability, age and business complexity, but is also strongly related to the unique attributes of corporate governance and ownership structure in Chinese listed firms, e. g. {{the independence of the}} supervisory board, political connections, concentration of the top 3 shareholders 2 ̆ 7 ownership and tradability of shares. Our results show that the severity of the ICWs disclosed is negatively and significantly associated with earnings response coefficients (ERCs), and <b>audit</b> <b>assurance</b> of ICRs has a significant moderating effect on the relationship between ICWs and ERCs.

40|$|Using {{the reforms}} to audit {{committees}} {{mandated by the}} Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the difference-in-difference approach, we {{examine the impact of}} changes in audit committee attributes (financial expertise, size and independence) on the corporate commitment to <b>audit</b> <b>assurance</b> and on the likelihood of financial statement restatements. Firms that were directly affected by the reforms experienced a greater improvement in audit inputs (measured by audit fees and the appointment of an industry specialist auditor) and a larger decline in financial statements restatements relative to firms that had already been compliant. Importantly, we find that the decline in restatements is not related to the improvement in audit inputs. This suggests that larger, more independent and more competent audit committees are able to better detect misstatements or to deter opportunistic reporting by management, independent of the level of the audit input quality. The results therefore provide justification for the audit committee reforms...|$|E
