25|$|He {{joined the}} Inner Temple and {{was called to}} the bar in 1806. In the same year, he entered Parliament as Whig member for Great Yarmouth, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> in the Commons in favour of the bill to abolish the slave trade in February 1807, and {{remained}} a lifelong advocate of the anti-slavery cause. He was re-elected in 1808, but a few months later, after the defeat of a motion he had proposed to castigate the behaviour of Sir Home Popham, he resigned his seat and devoted his energies to his legal practice.|$|E
60|$|But he ardently desired {{the blood}} of the gentleman in the frockcoat, <b>and</b> when <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> again, <b>and</b> when <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> again it was with a {{strained}} sweetness that Torpenhow knew well for the beginning of strife.|$|R

25|$|When the new Congress {{convened in}} 1935, {{there were only}} twenty-five Republican senators, and Vandenberg {{was one of the}} most {{effective}} opponents of the second New Deal. He voted against most Roosevelt-sponsored measures, notable exceptions being the Banking Act of 1935 and the Social Security Act. He pursued a policy of what he called fiscal responsibility, a balanced budget, states' rights, and reduced taxation. He felt that Franklin Roosevelt had usurped the powers of Congress, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> of the dictatorship of Roosevelt. But at the 1936 Republican National Convention, Vandenberg refused to permit the party to nominate him for Vice President, anticipating Roosevelt's victory that year.|$|E
25|$|DeLeon {{seems to}} have been further politicized by the 1886 workers' {{campaign}} for the Eight-Hour Day, and the brutal excesses of the police which came with it. DeLeon was on the committee which nominated Henry George to run for Mayor in that same year, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> in public several times on George's behalf {{during the course of the}} campaign. DeLeon participated in the first Nationalist Club in New York City, a group dedicated to advancing the socialist ideas expressed by Edward Bellamy in his extremely popular novel of the day, Looking Backward. DeLeon was also deeply influenced by The Co-operative Commonwealth by Laurence Gronlund.|$|E
25|$|Though many of {{the events}} were outside the {{traditional}} time period of the Middle Ages, {{the end of the}} unity of the Western Church (the Protestant Reformation), was one of the distinguishing characteristics of the medieval period. The Catholic Church had long fought against heretic movements, but during the Late Middle Ages, it started to experience demands for reform from within. The first of these came from Oxford professor John Wycliffe in England. Wycliffe held that the Bible should be the only authority in religious questions, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> out against transubstantiation, celibacy and indulgences. In spite of influential supporters among the English aristocracy, such as John of Gaunt, the movement was not allowed to survive. Though Wycliffe himself was left unmolested, his supporters, the Lollards, were eventually suppressed in England.|$|E

25|$|He {{had been}} {{returned}} for Morpeth in the Convention Parliament of April 1660, a constituency that he represented in every ensuing parliament till his death, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> with ability on financial and commercial questions. He was appointed a {{commissioner of the}} customs in 1671. The same year he was again sent to Holland to replace Sir William Temple, {{to break up the}} policy of the Triple Alliance and incite another war between the Dutch Republic and England in furtherance of the French policy. His unpopularity there was extreme, and after three months' residence Downing fled to England, in fear of the fury of the mob. For this unauthorised step he was sent to the Tower on 7 February 1672, but released some few weeks afterwards. He defended the Declaration of Indulgence the same year, and made himself useful in supporting the court policy.|$|E
25|$|Over the years, the Marconi {{companies}} {{gained a}} reputation for being technically conservative, in particular by continuing to use inefficient spark-transmitter technology, which could be used only for radio-telegraph operations, long after it was apparent that the future of radio communication lay with continuous-wave transmissions which were more efficient and could be used for audio transmissions. Somewhat belatedly, the company did begin significant work with continuous-wave equipment beginning in 1915, after the introduction of the oscillating vacuum tube (valve). The New Street Works factory in Chelmsford was the location for the first entertainment radio broadcasts in the United Kingdom in 1920, employing a vacuum tube transmitter and featuring Dame Nellie Melba. In 1922, regular entertainment broadcasts commenced from the Marconi Research Centre at Great Baddow, forming the prelude to the BBC, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> of the close association of aviation and wireless telephony in that same year at a private gathering with Florence Tyzack Parbury, and even spoke of interplanetary wireless communication.|$|E
25|$|Later that summer, a {{well known}} gambler from the Skeena River was aboard, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> to Captain Bucey about the {{possibility}} of having a poker game on one of the lower decks. The gambler promised it would not only occupy the players, but some spectators as well. Bucey was agreeable to the idea and gave his consent. Although gambling on sternwheelers that held liquor licenses was illegal, it was also a long and much-loved tradition. The game started off modestly enough, but soon huge sums were being wagered, and some large jackpots were being won. Present {{since the start of the}} game was a stranger, who was a provincial policeman who was being transferred to a new post by the constable at Fort George. Several hours into play, and when the table was covered with a drift of bills, this man abruptly announced his identity, declared the game illegal and confiscated all the money. The players and other spectators were outraged and immediately turned into an angry mob. The Skeena River gambler jumped to the policeman's defense and let the man return to his stateroom while he tried to mollify the angry men. After promising to refund any losses, the gambler went to speak to Captain Bucey to see what could be done about the matter. Bucey thought for a moment and then suggested to the gambler that he go talk to the policeman and suggest that if he let the game continue, he can keep half the money he took. The gambler did so, and was surprised when the policeman accepted the bribe. Upon hearing of the policeman's decision, Bucey had his first mate take over at the wheel, and accompanied by two deckhands, he went to the policeman's stateroom and took him down to the lower deck where the game had started again. Once there he told everyone how the policeman had tried to steal their money, but he assured everyone that he had complete control of his own ship, and that this incident would be reported to the magistrate at Fort George, and that the crooked policeman would be on the next steamer south. The bribe was surrendered, and the game continued unhampered. Captain Bucey had won the respect of his passengers, and their friendship.|$|E

500|$|Ulysses S.

[...] An accident or injury in his youth caused him to lose part of his palette, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> with a hoarse voice.|$|E
500|$|The Berlin Games had {{increased}} Brundage's admiration for Germany, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> {{out at a}} speech before the German-American Bund at Madison Square Garden in October 1936, stating that [...] "five years ago they [...] were discouraged and demoralized—today they are united—sixty million people believing in themselves and in their country..." [...] In 1938, his construction company received the contract {{to build a new}} German embassy in Washington (this was not fulfilled as World WarII intervened). Brundage joined the Keep America Out of War Committee and became a member of America First (he resigned from both the day after Pearl Harbor).|$|E
500|$|Milk's {{swearing-in}} made national headlines, as {{he became}} the first non-incumbent openly gay man in the United States to win an election for public office. He likened himself to pioneering African American baseball player Jackie Robinson and walked to City Hall arm in arm with Jack Lira, stating [...] "You can stand around and throw bricks at Silly Hall or you can take it over. Well, here we are." [...] The Castro District was not the only neighborhood to promote someone new to city politics. Sworn in with Milk were also a single mother (Carol Ruth Silver), a Chinese American (Gordon Lau), and an African American woman (Ella Hill Hutch)—all firsts for the city. Daniel White, a former police officer and firefighter, was also a first-time supervisor, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> of how proud he was that his grandmother was able to see him sworn in.|$|E

500|$|The cockpit voice {{recorder}} began recording the final 30 minutes of Flight93 at 09:31:57. At this moment, it recorded Jarrah announcing, [...] "Ladies and gentlemen: here the captain. Please sit down, keep remaining seating. We have a bomb on board. So sit." [...] The controller understood the transmission, but chose to respond, [...] "Calling Cleveland center, you're unreadable. Say again, slowly." [...] The cockpit recording captured Dahl moaning and Jarrah telling him in English {{to sit down and}} to stop touching something (presumably the controls); Jason Dahl's wife, Sandy Dahl, listening to the cockpit {{voice recorder}}, determined that Jarrah [...] "was fussing at my husband...he was speaking in English, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> Arabic anytime he was talking with the other hijackers. Jason made moaning sounds after that. It sounded like he was trying to mess with stuff or get up, because the hijacker pilot kept telling him to stop and to sit down." ...|$|E
500|$|Zoltán is of Hungarian descent. In the mid-1990s, his parents, Mihály and Erzsébet Meskó, {{were highly}} educated {{engineers}} in Romania. The family supplemented its income selling homemade {{clothes in the}} market. [...] His father was also a professional nine-pin bowler. [...] On 8 May 1997, when Zoltán was 11, his family moved from his native Romania after Mihály Meskó won a United States Permanent Resident Card (green card) in the Diversity Immigrant Visa lottery for the single child family {{to move to the}} United States. The Meskós now have jobs that pay well. [...] The family spent the first year and half in New York City before moving to Ohio for better jobs. [...] Zoltán speaks Hungarian, Romanian, German and English and is conversant in Spanish. He learned to speak English by watching television. [...] He was schooled at a German school in Timișoara, which was then Romania's second-largest city. His parents taught him Hungarian <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> Romanian with his friends.|$|E
500|$|Coke {{was again}} {{returned}} to Parliament in 1790, sitting continuously until 1832, and he primarily spoke {{on matters of}} local interest, such as the Corn Laws. His second focus was on civil liberties, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> out against the government's response to the Peterloo Massacre and similar events. Described as the [...] "greatest commoner in England", he chose {{the passage of the}} Great Reform Act 1832 as the moment to retire, later being made the Earl of Leicester in July 1837. After a short illness, Coke died on 30 June 1842, and was succeeded as Earl by his son Thomas. Coke's main legacy is as an agricultural reformer, not as a politician; he has historically been credited with sparking the British Agricultural Revolution through the reforms he made to farming on his estates. Later historians have questioned this, however, noting that the developments credited to him are most likely the work of other individuals; nevertheless, he has still been described as [...] "the real hero of Norfolk agriculture".|$|E

500|$|Initially, West felt odd {{in his new}} environment. He was a loner. His high-pitched voice {{earned him}} the {{nickname}} [...] "Tweety Bird", <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> with such a thick Appalachian accent that his teammates also referred to him as [...] "Zeke from Cabin Creek" [...] (his nickname acknowledged his country roots, and his accent was so thick that he squeaked his nickname sheepishly – [...] "Zeek fr'm Cab'n Creek"). However, West soon impressed his colleagues with his defensive hustle, with his vertical jump—he could reach up 16inches above the rim when he went up—and with his work ethic, spending countless extra hours working on his game. On the floor, West scored 17.6points, grabbed 7.7rebounds and gave 4.2assists per game. West won Schaus's trust and, alternating with Hundley, Selvy, and Leonard, played 35 minutes per game and established himself as the Lakers' second scoring option. The NBA commented that the Lakers now had a potent one-two-punchwith [...] "Mr. Inside" [...] (the low-post scorer, Baylor) and [...] "Mr. Outside" [...] (the long-distance shooter, West). These performances soon earned West his first of fourteen NBA All-Star Game call-ups.|$|E
500|$|According to Dunn, Willkie's {{mission was}} to be Roosevelt's {{personal}} representative, [...] "demonstrating American unity, gathering information, and discussing with key heads of state plans for the postwar future". After leaving the U.S. on August 26, Willkie's first stop was in North Africa, where he met General Montgomery and toured the front at El Alamein. In Beirut, he stayed with General de Gaulle, leader of the Free French. In Jerusalem, Willkie met with Jews and Arabs, told the British rulers of Palestine that both peoples should {{be brought into the}} government, and he later wrote that the conflict there was so ancient, it was unrealistic to think that it could [...] "be solved by good will and simple honesty". Willkie had been moved to add the Soviet Union to his itinerary when three Western reporters there urged him by telegram to do so. There, he met with Stalin, and upon his return he advocated more liberal Lend-Lease terms for the USSR. In China, Willkie was hosted by Chiang Kai-shek and was fascinated by Madame Chiang. Willkie was taken to the front in order to observe the Chinese military forces in their fight against the Japanese, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> out against colonialism, in China and elsewhere. [...] His statements were reported widely in Britain, angering Churchill, who responded by saying, [...] "We mean to hold our own. I have not become the King's First Minister in order to preside over the liquidation of the British Empire." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the matter}} of force levels for the war, the Piedmontese {{military}} commander Alfonso Ferrero La Marmora had produced a plan involving an army of 160,000 men, provided 50:50 by France and Piedmont-Sardinia, and a military campaign focused on the Po Valley. [...] The emperor had his own plan, however, involving 300,000 men of whom 200,000 would be French, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> {{in terms of a}} military campaign pushing right through to Vienna.|$|E
