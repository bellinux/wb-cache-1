Agrarianism was the dominant political philosophy in the countryside, as the peasantry organized a movement independent of any existing party. In 1899, the Bulgarian Agrarian Union was formed, bringing together rural intellectuals such as teachers with ambitious peasants.

25|$|Durgapur {{is by far}} {{the most}} industrialised city in eastern India and the second planned city in India. It started with the first prime {{minister}} of independent India, Jawaharlal Nehru. His dream of transforming the backward <b>agricultural</b> <b>country</b> into an industrially advanced nation was picked up in West Bengal by Dr. B.C. Roy. At the earlier stages for the selection of a proper site for a new industrial township, Jnananjan Niyogi, a great business organiser and planner, was involved. Modernist American architect Joseph Allen Stein, invited to head the newly formed Department of Architecture and Planning at the Bengal Engineering College in Calcutta, plunged into a major project as soon as he reached India in 1952 – the designing of Durgapur city with Benjamin Polk, another American architect already living in Calcutta. Thereafter it was the task of local leaders such as Ananda Gopal Mukherjee and bureaucrats such as K.K. Sen to get Durgapur going.|$|E
500|$|Hoskins {{begins his}} chapter on {{industrialisation}} with the remark [...] "England {{was still a}} peaceful <b>agricultural</b> <b>country</b> {{at the beginning of}} the seventeenth century." [...] He describes the early industrial landscape, water power and early mills, steam power and slums. He names transformative inventions such as Kay's flying shuttle of 1733 and Hargreaves's spinning jenny of 1767, and comments that Matthew Boulton opened his steam engine factory [...] "in the still unravished country" [...] outside Birmingham in 1765. He quotes a poem by Anna Seward lamenting the ravishing of Coalbrookdale, c. 1785, and one by Wordsworth from The Excursion. He is critical of the industrial slums and the smoke and dirt of the Staffordshire Potteries. He emphasises the rapid growth of industrial towns like Preston, and of new towns like Middlesbrough, which went from a single farm in 1830 to over 50,000 inhabitants in 1880. However he appreciates the mining landscapes of Cornwall, including the gleaming white china clay pits of St Austell and the abandoned tin mines of St Cleer, commenting that [...] "there is a point, as Arthur Young saw, when industrial ugliness becomes sublime".|$|E
500|$|Bulgaria has an {{emerging}} market {{economy in the}} upper middle income range, where the private sector {{accounts for more than}} 80 per cent of GDP. From a largely <b>agricultural</b> <b>country</b> with a predominantly rural population in 1948, by the 1980s Bulgaria had transformed into an industrial economy with scientific and technological research at the top of its budgetary expenditure priorities. The loss of COMECON markets in 1990 and the subsequent [...] "shock therapy" [...] of the planned system caused a steep decline in industrial and agricultural production, ultimately followed by an economic collapse in 1997. The economy largely recovered during a period of rapid growth several years later, but the average salary remains one of the lowest in the EU at 1,036 leva (€529) per month in March 2017. More than a fifth of the labour force are employed on a minimum wage of €1 per hour. Wages, however, account for only half of the total household income, owing to the substantial informal economy which amounts to almost 32% of GDP. Bulgarian PPS GDP per capita stood at 47 per cent of the EU average in 2015 according to Eurostat data, {{while at the same time}} the cost of living in the country was 47 per cent of the EU average as well. The currency is the lev, which is pegged to the euro at a rate of 1.95583 levа for 1 euro. Bulgaria is not yet part of the eurozone but is showing progress.|$|E

However, unlike Yanagawa’s model, our model adopts the Stone-Geary utility function of a non-homothetic preference. The main results are as follows. First, we find that an increase in agricultural productivity leads to industrialization under the nonhomothetic preference, whereas it leads to deindustrialization under the homothetic preference. Second, the widening disparity of manufacturing productivity among countries leads {{to an increase in}} the number of <b>agricultural</b> <b>countries</b> in the world, even if it is under the non-homothetic preference. ...|$|R
