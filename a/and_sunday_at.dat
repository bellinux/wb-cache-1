25|$|The tournament {{traditionally}} {{took place}} over two weeks in late June and early July, starting on the third Monday in June and culminating with the Ladies' and Gentlemen's Singles Finals, scheduled for the Saturday <b>and</b> <b>Sunday</b> <b>at</b> {{the end of the}} second week. However recent changes to the tennis calendar have seen the event moved back by two weeks cumulatively to begin in early July. Five major events are held each year, with additional junior and invitational competitions also taking place. Wimbledon traditions include a strict dress code for competitors and Royal patronage. The tournament is also notable for the absence of sponsor advertising around the courts. In 2009, Wimbledon's Centre Court was fitted with a retractable roof to lessen the loss of playing time due to rain.|$|E

2500|$|Benwell was a {{prolific}} illustrator for various Victorian religious publications, particularly those {{published by the}} Religious Tract Society and with a missionary theme, for example The Sunday at Home: [...] A Family Magazine for Sabbath Reading, The Leisure Hour, a Family Journal of Instruction and Recreation and The Picture Scrap Book series (the latter aimed at Victorian youth) during the 1850s through to the mid-1860s. His entry in the Modern English Biography states that he '...executed thousands of wood blocks for the Religious Tract Society to about 1876, and in Missionary publications; illustrated The Illustrated London News <b>and</b> <b>Sunday</b> <b>at</b> Home for many years...'. The 1862 edition of Sunday at Home refers to '...an interesting series of 'Indian Illustrations of Scripture', delivered {{in the form of}} a lecture by the Rev W M Robertson BA of London, with the aid of 'dissolving views' painted by Mr Benwell, formerly of Calcutta, many of whose Indian scenes have already appeared in The Sunday at Home’. Joseph Austin Benwell also provided illustrations for other Victorian periodicals, although not necessarily with a religious theme, including the literary Cornhill Magazine and The Welcome Guest: a Magazine of Recreative Reading for All. [...] He produced illustrations on Indian and Eastern life for The Illustrated London News between 1857 and 1864.|$|E

60|$|He {{wanted to}} come home. The midsummer holiday was gone; {{it was a long}} while to Christmas. He wrote in wild excitement, saying he could come for Saturday <b>and</b> <b>Sunday</b> <b>at</b> Goose Fair, the first week in October.|$|E
60|$|Roundhand {{could not}} refuse such an {{invitation}} as that, {{though he had}} told us how Mrs. R. and {{he were going to}} pass Saturday <b>and</b> <b>Sunday</b> <b>at</b> Putney; and we who knew what a life the poor fellow led, were sure that the head clerk would be prettily scolded by his lady when she heard what was going on. She disliked Mrs. Brough very much, that was the fact; because Mrs. B. kept a carriage, and said she didn't know where Pentonville was, and couldn't call on Mrs. Roundhand. Though, to be sure, her coachman might have found out the way.|$|E
60|$|Constance Morton {{was leaning}} on the rail that divided the gardens at Northmoor from the park, which was still rough and heathery. Of all the Morton family, perhaps {{she was the one}} who had the most profited by the three years that had passed since her uncle's {{accession}} to the title. She had been at a good boarding-house, attending the High School in Colbeam, and spending Saturday <b>and</b> <b>Sunday</b> <b>at</b> Northmoor. It had been a happy life, she liked her studies, made friends with her companions, and enjoyed to the very utmost all that Northmoor gave her, in country beauty and liberty, in the kindness of her uncle and aunt, and in the religious training that they were able to give her, satisfying longings of her soul, so that she loved them with all her heart, and felt Northmoor her true home. The holiday time at Westhaven was always a trial. Mrs. Morton had tried Brighton and London, but neither place agreed with Ida: and she found herself a much greater personage in her own world than elsewhere, and besides could not always find tenants for her house. So there she lived at her ease, called by many of her neighbours the Honourable Mrs. Morton, and finding listeners to her alternate accounts of the grandeur of Northmoor, and murmurs at the meanness of its master in only allowing her 300 pounds a year, besides educating her children, and clothing two of them.|$|E
