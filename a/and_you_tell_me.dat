[...] MacLeod also advises Richie {{to get used to}} her loss, because it [...] "won't be the last time it happens to you." [...] Later, while MacLeod trains Richie roughly so that he can face Immortal Annie Devlin (Sheena Easton), Richie angrily tells MacLeod, [...] "You can't get past it, Mac. I know. You've seen a lot of people die. But you had to be the hero, you sent us out to the car that night, you could have been there ...You look me in the eyes <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> you don't blame yourself for her death." [...] Some time later, MacLeod bitterly tells Devlin, [...] "Nothing you do brings anyone back. Once they're dead... nothing." ...|$|E

60|$|Const. Well, {{my opinion}} is, some great lady, {{that is in}} love with you, {{supplies}} you still; <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> an incredible tale of the devil, merely to shadow your infidelity.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Dear, dear!' exclaimed {{the young}} man. 'That is unlucky; <b>and</b> didn't <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that the {{dressmaker}} {{was coming in}} to-morrow?' ...|$|R
3000|$|Interviewer: “Yeah, okay <b>and</b> <b>you</b> were <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> that <b>you</b> play {{once you}} paid all bills and expenses....” [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "That tall, smooth-faced man, {{in a high}} hat, {{who came}} with the lady," [...] said the clerk {{severely}} <b>and</b> concisely,--"didn't <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> he was gone?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no, I didn't think so. But why not? You--you cared once, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> plainly {{you don't}} love him. It {{was all a}} terrible mistake. We were meant for each other." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Degree!" [...] {{said the}} countess. [...] "Why, Frank, I am {{talking to you}} of your {{prospects}} in life, of your future position, of that on which everything hangs, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> of your degree!" ...|$|E
6000|$|SIR PEARCE [rising {{again and}} {{standing}} over him]. What! O'Flaherty: {{do you know}} what you are saying? You sit there wearing the Victoria Cross for having killed God knows how many Germans; <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> you don't know why you did it! ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, {{anywhere}} you like!' he answered--'to the {{restaurant in the}} Bois; we will dine there, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> shall <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> all about yourself.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am the King of the Snakes,' was the reply, 'and {{this is my}} palace. <b>And</b> will <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> who <b>you</b> are, <b>and</b> where <b>you</b> come from?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Think of {{what his}} conduct has been to <b>me.</b> <b>And</b> then <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that I am to own that I have been wrong! In what have I been wrong?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Offensive! I am afraid, Miss Mackenzie, {{you have}} not your spirit subject to a proper control. I have come here in all {{kindness}} to warn you against danger, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that I am offensive! What am I to think of you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Is it {{so certain}} that he is dead?" [...] she asked. [...] "When all is said, none {{actually}} saw him die, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that the body surrendered by Mulai-Ahmed-ben-Mahomet was disfigured beyond recognition. Is it not possible {{that he may have}} survived?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By George, I do nearly always. I don't {{know what}} you mean by sometimes. I've been {{drinking}} brandy-and-water till I'm sick of it, to oblige you, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> about--sometimes. You doctors expect a man to be a slave. Haven't I kept it out of my stomach?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of that," [...] he said, [...] "I {{mean to be}} the judge. <b>And</b> until <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> {{what they}} are, I shall treat them as though they did not exist." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah; yes; I daresay! <b>And</b> that's what <b>you</b> call honest, being a Parliament gent! You had my money, <b>and</b> then <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>you</b> don't {{want to see}} me any more!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I don't {{know about}} Shylock, but I'm blessed if I think you suit me {{very well at}} anything. I'm putting up with a deal of ill-usage, and when I try {{to be happy with}} you, you won't drink, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> about Shylock. He was a Jew, wasn't he?" ...|$|E
60|$|PRINCE PAUL. Ah, I {{am sorry}} you told me. It robs my visit {{of all its}} {{picturesqueness}} and adventure. I thought I was perilling my head by coming here, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> I have saved it. One {{is sure to be}} disappointed if one tries to get romance out of modern life.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I can't bear {{to think}} of you in that miserable village--a {{position}} so unworthy of your talents and your claims! <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> I must not talk about it.

6000|$|... 'No {{trace of}} Ferrari has been {{discovered}} in England,' she said. 'Have you any news of him? <b>And</b> will <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> (if <b>you</b> have heard anything), in mercy to his wife?' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "But Fanny, dear, I {{must speak}} as I find. You {{were talking about}} clouds just now, {{and do you think}} that all this is not a cloud in my sky? Ludovic tells me that he is {{attached}} to Miss Robarts, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that she is attached to him; and I am called upon to decide between them. Her very act obliges me to do so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You dismiss me," [...] she said, {{in a low}} tone. [...] "I {{have come}} all this way, have waited all this time, and you throw me a kiss out of pity, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> to go home as fast as I can. Bertrand, you did not talk like this a few months ago. You did not talk like this when {{you asked me to}} marry you!" ...|$|E
60|$|ASHER. Liberty! License is what we're getting now! The workman {{thinks he}} can do as he pleases. And after all I've done for my workmen,--building them a club house with a piano in it, and a library and a billiard table, trying {{to do my best}} to make them {{comfortable}} and contented. I pay them enough to buy pianos and billiard tables for themselves, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> they want still higher wages.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come {{into the}} house! Come in and refresh yourself, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> shall <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that {{with which you}} are charged while partaking of such food as my wife can prepare quickly." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "A week--only I want it off my mind. You can get {{out somewhere}} and rub up your impressions. We'll dine for half a crown in Soho, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> shall <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> about Paris." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Remember you! Why, {{of course}} I do. I haven't ever forgot you, Ben. Many's the time I've {{wondered}} where you {{was and how}} you was getting on. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> you've been in the Kootenay! Well, well, you have seen a good bit more of the world than I ever have. You've changed a lot, Ben. You ain't a boy no longer. D'ye mind all the pranks you used to play?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, of course," [...] {{she replied}} lightly; [...] "I have friends everywhere. Their {{political}} views {{have nothing to}} do with me. Artistes, I think, should have naught to do with politics. You see, citizen St. Just, I never inquired of you what were your views. Your name and kinship would proclaim you a partisan of citizen Robespierre, yet I find you in the company of M. de Batz; <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that you live in England." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You, John of Gamala!" [...] Tibellus exclaimed. [...] "In {{frequent}} {{letters from}} my {{friends with the}} army I have read that name, and heard how incessant was the watchfulness required to resist his attacks, and how often small garrisons and parties were cut off by him. It was he, too, who burned Vespasian's camp, before Gamala. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me,</b> young man, that you are that Jewish hero--for hero he was, though it was against Rome he fought?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{sent for}} you, Annie, because I {{thought you might}} be able to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> {{something}} about the letters Mrs. Inglethorp wrote last night. How many were there? <b>And</b> can <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> any of the names and addresses?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Criticism has {{no clear}} motivation: [...] "why are <b>you</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> this, <b>and</b> why are <b>you</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> about it now?".|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will go for}} my work, John, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> shall <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> {{all about}} it," [...] she replied, rising. [...] "I shall be five or ten minutes in {{preparing}} it. Can you wait patiently?" ...|$|R
