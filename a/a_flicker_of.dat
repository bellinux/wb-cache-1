500|$|The Bunnygraphs, as a genre, were {{representative}} of the cinema of the period, and were very successful, making Bunny the first American comic film star and Finch the first female star comedian. A Cure for Pokeritis, released February 23, 1912, was individually well-received, including in showings outside the United States. The Thames Star, a New Zealand newspaper, described the film as [...] "screamingly funny". After John Bunny's death, interest in his films led Vitagraph in 1917 to announce the re-release of this film (retitled A Sure Cure for Pokeritis), along with many of his other works, as [...] "Favorite Film Features". However, the comedy style of A Cure for Pokeritis has not aged well, especially in contrast to Mack Sennett's slapstick films and the works of later comedians such as Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton. According to film scholars Donald McCaffrey and Christopher Jacobs, modern viewers [...] "will hardly get <b>a</b> <b>flicker</b> <b>of</b> a smile" [...] from the film, despite the skill of its actors.|$|E
500|$|Hartmann's last kill {{occurred}} over Brno, Czechoslovakia, on 8 May, {{the last day}} of the war in Europe. Early that morning, he was ordered to fly a reconnaissance mission and report the position of Soviet forces. Hartmann took off with his wingman at 08:30 and spotted the first Soviet units just [...] away. Passing over the area, Hartmann saw two Yak-9s performing aerobatics for the Soviet columns. Determined to [...] "spoil the party", Hartmann dove upon the fighters from his vantage point at [...] and shot one down from a range of [...] As he lined up the second fighter, Hartmann noticed <b>a</b> <b>flicker</b> <b>of</b> shiny dots above him coming from the West; they were P-51s. Rather than make a stand and be caught between the Soviets and the Americans, Hartmann and his wingman fled at low level into the pall of smoke that covered Brno. When he landed, Hartmann learned that the Soviet forces were within artillery range of the airfield, so JG52 destroyed Karaya One, 24 other Bf109s, and large quantities of ammunition. Hartmann later recalled his final violent action of the war: ...|$|E
2500|$|Jon Caramanica in The New York Times opined it [...] "liberally borrows styles {{from other}} singers." [...] He {{highlighted}} [...] "where Halsey sets herself apart {{is in her}} subject matter and manner of delivery. Her tales have rough edges and ellipsis endings," [...] however, [...] "there isn't <b>a</b> <b>flicker</b> <b>of</b> musical edge on this album, only {{a belief in the}} crowdsourcing of ideas." [...] USA Todays Maeve McDermott expressed similar sentiments in a mixed review, noting that the album [...] "borrows magpie-like from other stars' signature sounds, with some working better than others." ...|$|E
60|$|There was <b>a</b> <b>flickering</b> <b>of</b> {{lanterns}} ab3ut {{the camp}} that night, and {{a rumor that}} brought men out of their cots to the tent doors, a paddling of the naked feet of doolie-bearers and the rush of a galloping horse.|$|R

60|$|She roused {{herself with}} a start. She became aware that the night outside was no longer still. That there was an {{excitement}} down below on the bridge and a running {{in the street and}} <b>a</b> <b>flickering</b> <b>of</b> searchlights among the clouds from some high place away beyond the Trocadero. And then the excitement came surging up past her and invaded the hall within.|$|R
60|$|<b>A</b> <b>flicker</b> <b>of</b> humour, of ironic question, {{passed over}} the boy's lips.|$|E

60|$|The {{man looked}} at her with <b>a</b> <b>flicker</b> <b>of</b> grim {{amusement}} in his eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "An unspoiled market!" [...] reiterated Mr. May, in full confirmation, {{though with}} <b>a</b> faint <b>flicker</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> smile. [...] "How very {{fortunate}} for us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank ye kindly, Missey," [...] he murmured, with <b>a</b> little <b>flicker</b> <b>of</b> life, {{and then}} sank back again into his stolidity and his silence.|$|R
60|$|But the old Huguenot {{had opened}} his eyes, and with <b>a</b> last <b>flicker</b> <b>of</b> {{strength}} he pushed away the gray-hooded figure which bent over him.|$|R
60|$|<b>A</b> <b>flicker</b> <b>of</b> embarrassment {{passed over}} the butler's large, smooth face--passed, and was gone.|$|E
60|$|<b>A</b> <b>flicker</b> <b>of</b> passion {{distorted}} Dominey's face, flamed for {{a moment}} in his tone.|$|E
60|$|He drew himself up. <b>A</b> <b>flicker</b> <b>of</b> passion flamed {{in his own}} deep gray eyes.|$|E
60|$|Almost <b>a</b> {{softening}} <b>flicker</b> <b>of</b> {{light was}} imminent in his withered {{face as he}} beheld the others proudly lift their hats and exhibit their own supplies.|$|R
60|$|The trapped {{man looked}} away from the {{instrument}} into Quest's face. There was <b>a</b> momentary <b>flicker</b> <b>of</b> something that might have passed for courage in his tone.|$|R

60|$|The sun, rimming {{the east}} wall, shining into Joan's face, awakened her. She had slept hours. She felt rested, stronger. Like the night, {{something}} dark {{had passed away}} from her. It did not seem strange {{to her that she}} should feel that Kells still lived. She knew it. And examination proved her right. In him there had been no change except that he had ceased to bleed. There was just <b>a</b> <b>flickering</b> <b>of</b> life in him, manifest only in his slow, faint heart-beats.|$|R

50|$|The Government quickly {{rounded up}} {{many of the}} instigators. Those who could fled across the seas, and their {{followers}} dispersed. <b>A</b> last <b>flicker</b> <b>of</b> revolt in 1849, led by among others James Fintan Lalor, was equally unsuccessful.|$|R
60|$|The detective smiled. It was <b>a</b> {{very slight}} <b>flicker</b> <b>of</b> the lips, but it {{attracted}} Mr. Sabin's keen attention.|$|R
