5|$|In 1947, {{another son}} of Merthyr Tydfil, Jack Jones, based his novel, Off to Philadelphia in the Morning , {{on the events}} in the life of Joseph Parry. The book became a BBC three-part {{presentation}} of the same name in 1978. Jones never offered the book <b>as</b> <b>anything</b> except a work of fiction; despite this, some aspects of the novel have been misconstrued as fact.|$|E

5|$|One might {{surmise that}} the {{hermeneutic}} style was cultivated energetically in England {{in an attempt}} to show that English learning was as profound and English writing as sophisticated <b>as</b> <b>anything</b> produced on the Continent. The impetus for the cultivation of the style in tenth-century England was therefore probably of Continental origin.|$|E

5|$|Amelia is a {{domestic}} novel taking place largely in London during 1733. It describes the hardships suffered {{by a young}} couple newly married. Against her mother's wishes, Amelia marries Captain William Booth, a dashing young army officer. The couple run away to London. In Book II, William is unjustly imprisoned in Newgate, and is subsequently seduced by Miss Matthews. During this time, it is revealed that Amelia was in a carriage accident and that her nose was ruined. Although this brings about jokes at Amelia's behalf, Booth refuses to regard her <b>as</b> <b>anything</b> but beautiful.|$|E

5|$|Asked by a {{journalist}} once, {{he said that}} his favourite city was London, and in another instance he said that Mohammed Ali Jinnah had asked him to join the Pakistan Army during the partition in 1947, and in his usual jovial style, commented that if he had joined the Pakistan Army, then India would have been defeated in the 1971 war. The latter remark attracted as much criticism <b>as</b> <b>anything</b> else in his career.|$|E
5|$|The Sautrāntika school held {{a form of}} phenomenalism {{that saw}} the world as imperceptible. It held that {{external}} objects exist only as a support for cognition, which can only apprehend mental representations. This influenced the later Yogacara school of Mahayana Buddhism. The Yogācāra school is often called the mind-only school because of its internalist stance that consciousness is the ultimate existing reality. The works of Vasubandhu have often been interpreted as arguing for some form of Idealism. Vasubandhu uses the dream argument and a mereological refutation of atomism to attack the reality of external objects <b>as</b> <b>anything</b> other than mental entities. Scholarly interpretations of Vasubandhu's philosophy vary widely, and include phenomenalism, neutral monism and realist phenomenology.|$|E
5|$|In these areas, a Bulgarian {{resistance}} emerged, {{taking advantage}} of the Byzantine civil wars after the death of Tzimiskes in 976, led by the four sons of a count (comes) Nicholas, who became known as the Cometopuli ("sons of the count"). The most capable amongst them, Samuel, revived the Bulgarian realm, now centered in Macedonia, and was crowned Tsar in 997. A formidable warrior, he led raiding campaigns into Byzantine territory as far south as the Peloponnese, and he engaged the Byzantine emperor Basil II (r. 976–1025) in a series of wars resulting in the final conquest of the Bulgarian state by the Byzantines in 1018. Nevertheless, due to the events of 971, the Byzantines would never regard him <b>as</b> <b>anything</b> other than a rebel against imperial authority, let alone concede the principle of equality enjoyed by the Bulgarian rulers before 971.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the early}} results from the Infrared Astronomy Satellite (IRAS) was the {{discovery}} of excess infrared flux coming from Vega, beyond what would be expected from the star alone. This excess was measured at wavelengths of 25, 60, and 100μm, and came from within an angular radius of 10arcseconds (10″) centered on the star. At the measured distance of Vega, this corresponded to an actual radius of 80astronomical units (AU), where an AU is the average radius of the Earth's orbit around the Sun. It was proposed that this radiation came from a field of orbiting particles with a dimension {{on the order of}} a millimeter, <b>as</b> <b>anything</b> smaller would eventually be removed from the system by radiation pressure or drawn into the star by means of Poynting–Robertson drag. The latter is the result of radiation pressure creating an effective force that opposes the orbital motion of a dust particle, causing it to spiral inward. This effect is most pronounced for tiny particles that are closer to the star.|$|E
5|$|Articles {{published}} in the 1970s and later suggest that Debierne's results {{published in}} 1904 conflict with those reported in 1899 and 1900. Furthermore, the now-known chemistry of actinium precludes its presence <b>as</b> <b>anything</b> other than a minor constituent of Debierne's 1899 and 1900 results; in fact, the chemical properties he reported make it likely that he had, instead, accidentally identified protactinium, which would not be discovered for another fourteen years, only to have it disappear due to its hydrolysis and adsorption onto his laboratory equipment. This has led some authors to advocate that Giesel alone should be credited with the discovery. A less confrontational vision of scientific discovery is proposed by Adloff. He suggests that hindsight criticism of the early publications should be mitigated by the then nascent state of radiochemistry: highlighting the prudence of Debierne's claims in the original papers, he notes that nobody can contend that Debierne's substance did not contain actinium. Debierne, who is now considered by {{the vast majority of}} historians as the discoverer, lost interest in the element and left the topic. Giesel, on the other hand, can rightfully be credited with the first preparation of radiochemically pure actinium and with the identification of its atomic number 89.|$|E

25|$|At the Sydney concert, Peter Trotter, playing {{saxophone}} for Mental <b>As</b> <b>Anything,</b> {{collapsed on}} stage and died a week later. The tour was announced with claims of Australian mateship and cooperation, however arguments ensued between various band managers over the proposed concert series film. Some bands felt they had been coerced into unfavourable tour contracts. The tour ended in acrimony with two managers, Chris Murphy (for INXS) and Jeremy Fabinyi (for Mental <b>As</b> <b>Anything),</b> arguing backstage in Sydney and coming to blows. After the Sydney concert, Rick Grossman, bass guitarist of Divinyls, was fired from the group due to his heroin addiction, he attended the drug rehab centre, , and eventually joined Hoodoo Gurus in 1988. The film of the tour, , directed by Richard Lowenstein, was released in July 1987, was shown in cinemas, and released on VHS home video, but contained no footage of Mental <b>As</b> <b>Anything</b> performing. An edited DVD version, Australian Made: Featuring INXS Live (aka INXS: Australian Made) was released in May 2008. In 1987 the book Australian Made was also published as a companion to the movie.|$|E
