40|$|The <b>anti-ice</b> {{systems are}} {{critical}} for airplane safety, but are also strongly affecting the fuel consumption of the aircraft. A complete model of this system allows the designers to investigate all possible combination of external parameters and improve the design of current <b>anti-ice</b> systems. The dynamic model of an <b>anti-ice</b> system is presented {{and the results of}} the model are validated thanks to a series of experimental tests. The model has been used to analyze the behavior of an <b>anti-ice</b> system at extreme high bleed air temperature which are typical of new generation aircraft engines. An innovative architecture for <b>anti-ice</b> system is studied and the benefits on aircraft fuel consumption for a standard day mission are shown...|$|R
40|$|Ice {{accretion}} on {{surfaces and}} its prevention {{have been investigated}} {{for a long time}} by work groups all over the world with a limited success to date. A more realistic current goal is the production of durable, industrially-viable coatings which function by reducing ice adhesion forces rather than by completely preventing the formation of ice. Besides carrying out research on these (passive acting) coatings, specialists at the Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing Technology and Applied Materials Research (IFAM) are developing new nano-structured surfaces with outstanding <b>anti-ice</b> effect. Another approach is the development of temporary active <b>anti-ice</b> coatings and the biomimetic coating concept which uses a biological model for technical coatings. The research on the development of <b>anti-ice</b> coating concepts is carried out by the Paint Technology department of the Fraunhofer IFAM. This paper summarises the work including reliable test methods (ice chamber tests, adhesion tests and investigations under real icing conditions) and has been completed with the latest results. The following approaches are described: new techniques for nano-structuring of surfaces and its <b>anti-ice</b> effect; biomimetic <b>anti-ice</b> coatings with the inclusion of anti-freeze proteins; temporary <b>anti-ice</b> Coatings and their area of application; hydrophobic coatings...|$|R
5000|$|Gladstone meets Traveller {{personally}} and orders him forthwith to prepare <b>anti-ice</b> weapons for use {{to end the}} war. At first he does so, but Vicars persuades him that such {{a course of action}} is unconscionable. Too late, the two arrive in the Phaeton to see the destruction of Orléans by an <b>anti-ice</b> rocket. Peace is immediately declared, and the United Kingdom sets up its hegemony over Europe—a development not without price, which Vicars notes in a 1910 letter to his son. And the supply of <b>anti-ice,</b> which Traveller thought was confined to the South Pole, is virtually limitless due to the [...] "Little Moon", which is composed entirely of <b>anti-ice.</b> The possibilities of an early 20th-century cold war are dwelt on by the narrator (Vicars) throughout the book, the instrument of deterrence being named the Gladstone Shell.|$|R
5|$|The most {{significant}} source of ethylene glycol is from aircraft de-icing and <b>anti-icing</b> operations, where it is released onto land and eventually to waterways near airports experiencing cold winter climates. It is also used in manufacturing polyester products. In 2006, approximately 1540 kilotonnes of ethylene glycol were manufactured in Canada by three companies in Alberta, {{with most of the}} production destined for export.|$|E
5|$|Though {{metallic}} sodium has some important uses, the major applications for sodium use compounds; millions {{of tons of}} sodium chloride, hydroxide, and carbonate are produced annually. Sodium chloride is extensively used for <b>anti-icing</b> and de-icing and as a preservative; sodium bicarbonate is mainly used for cooking. Along with potassium, many important medicines have sodium added to improve their bioavailability; though potassium is the better ion in most cases, sodium is chosen for its lower price and atomic weight. Sodium hydride is used as a base for various reactions (such as the aldol reaction) in organic chemistry, and as a reducing agent in inorganic chemistry.|$|E
5|$|The {{southern}} terminus of I-35E is at exit 88A in Burnsville, where I-35 splits into I-35E and I-35W. While I-35W heads {{north into}} Minneapolis, I-35E takes a northeasterly path into Saint Paul. There is no access between I-35E and I-35W here, but Dakota County Road 42 (exit 88B), {{immediately to the}} north, connects the two Interstates in Burnsville. Major interchanges south of Saint Paul include State Highway 77 (MN77, signed as Cedar Avenue—exit92) at Apple Valley– Eagan and Interstate 494 (exit99) in Mendota Heights. Between exits94 and 97, the highway deviates from its relatively straight path to avoid Blackhawk Lake. As it crosses I-494, I-35E turns more to the north, crossing MN110 (exit101) and MN13 (exit102) in Mendota Heights before crossing the Mississippi River on the Lexington Bridge into the city of Saint Paul. This portion of I-35E is four lanes wide (two in each direction), except between MN77 and MN110, where it carries six lanes. The Lexington Bridge carries six lanes—four through lanes and the exit and entrance lanes for MN13—as well as a bicycle and pedestrian path. The bridge has an innovative automatic <b>anti-icing</b> system that sprays potassium acetate onto the bridge surface to prevent frost and ice formation in inclement weather.|$|E

25|$|At 17:10 {{local time}} {{the first officer}} {{requested}} clearance and, after a short delay, the crew taxied to depart from runway 06. With the pilot flying, a normal takeoff {{was followed by a}} normal reduction in power at 1,200 feet amsl. At 2,200 feet the co-pilot selected the <b>anti-icing</b> systems on while the pilot changed to a new radio frequency. Four seconds later the torque indicators for both engines rapidly fell to zero and the aircraft suffered a complete loss of propeller thrust.|$|E
25|$|Engine {{failures}} can {{be caused}} by mechanical problems in the engine itself, such as damage to portions of the turbine or oil leaks, as well as damage outside the engine such as fuel pump problems or fuel contamination. A turbine engine failure can also be caused by entirely external factors, such as volcanic ash, bird strikes or weather conditions like precipitation or icing. Weather risks such as these can sometimes be countered through the usage of supplementary ignition or <b>anti-icing</b> systems.|$|E
50|$|In science fiction, Gladstone is an MP in Stephen Baxter's novel, <b>Anti-Ice.</b> After the {{intervention}} of Sir Josiah Traveller and Ned Vickers in halting the Franco-Prussian War of 1871 with apocalyptic <b>Anti-Ice</b> weapons, a cold war settles over Europe in the late 19th century. The peace is maintained by the ministry of Gladstone, and the delivery of destructive medium-range ballistic missiles for delivery of <b>Anti-Ice</b> weapons termed 'Gladstone Shells' set the scene for a First World War in 1914 of such ferocity as to resemble nuclear warfare three generations early. The novel ends on an ambiguous note, with the Gladstone Shell now a component of British diplomacy and deterrence of war between Prussia and France.|$|R
50|$|Many modern civil {{fixed-wing}} {{transport aircraft}} use <b>anti-ice</b> systems {{on the leading}} edge of wings, engine inlets and air data probes using warm air. This is bled from engines and is ducted into a cavity beneath the surface to be <b>anti-iced.</b> The warm air heats the surface up to a few degrees above 0 °C (32 °F), preventing ice from forming. The system may operate autonomously, switching on and off as the aircraft enters and leaves icing conditions.|$|R

The crew computed V speeds of V1 at 137 kn, VR at 139 kn and V2 at 145 kn. After engine start the crew activated the <b>anti-ice</b> systems of the engines, but the wing <b>anti-ice</b> systems were not activated.|$|R
25|$|Magnesium {{chloride}} is used {{in three}} ways for pavement ice control: <b>Anti-icing,</b> when maintenance professionals spread it onto roads before a snow storm to prevent snow from sticking and ice from forming; pre-wetting, which means a liquid formulation of magnesium chloride is sprayed directly onto salt as it is being spread onto roadway pavement, wetting the salt so that it sticks to the road; and pre-treating, when magnesium chloride and salt are mixed together before they are loaded onto trucks and spread onto paved roads.|$|E
25|$|On {{aircraft}} {{powered by}} jet engines, a similar system {{is used for}} wing <b>anti-icing</b> by the 'hot-wing' method. In icing conditions, water droplets condensing on a wing's leading edge can freeze. If that happens, the ice build-up adds weight and changes {{the shape of the}} wing, causing a degradation in performance, and possibly a critical loss of control or lift. To prevent this, hot bleed air is pumped through the inside of the wing's leading edge, heating it to a temperature above freezing, which prevents the formation of ice. The air then exits through small holes in the wing edge.|$|E
25|$|On 28 June 2012, the ARJ21-700 {{travelled}} at {{high speed}} on a specially constructed test lane at Xi'an Yanliang airport. Since 22 June, the aircraft has undergone ten tests on taxiing, takeoff and landing at different speeds on a flooded runway. The tests ensure that the aircraft is able to taxi, take off and land despite having water on the runway. Since the aircraft entered the validation flight test phase in February 2012, it has been scheduled to undergo 1,500hours of validation flight tests involving 280 subjects. It has since completed the airspeed calibration, natural icing, engine nacelle <b>anti-icing</b> and crosswind validation tests and is preparing for a stall flight test.|$|E

5|$|Aircraft {{themselves}} {{now have}} more sophisticated deicing systems {{that can be}} used on the ground and in the air. Many modern civil fixed wing transport aircraft, for example the Boeing 737, use <b>anti-ice</b> systems on the leading edge of wings, engine inlets and air data probes using warm air. This is bled from engines and is ducted into a cavity beneath the surface to be <b>anti-iced.</b> The warm air heats the surface up to a few degrees above freezing, preventing ice from forming.

25|$|A fume event {{occurs when}} bleed air used for cabin {{pressurization}} {{and air conditioning}} in a pressurized aircraft is contaminated by fluids such as engine oil, hydraulic fluid, <b>anti-icing</b> fluid, and other potentially hazardous chemicals. Turbine engine oil is an irritant and contains neurotoxic chemicals such as tricresyl phosphate. The aviation industry claim that engine oil does not contain sufficient quantities of such chemicals to cause long-term damage. However, there is some historical evidence {{that would seem to}} contradict this statement. In 1959, over 10,000 people in Morocco were paralyzed or otherwise effected after ingesting small quantities of tricresyl phosphate in their cooking oil. Unlike tricresyl phosphate, hydraulic fluid — although non-toxic in small quantities — is extremely irritating to the eyes and skin, which creates a hazard to pilots during a fume event but causes no lasting damage. Deicing fluid has a strong smell but is not very irritating or toxic.|$|E
25|$|The EC155 B {{features}} a completely redesigned cabin providing 30% more passenger space than previous Dauphin helicopter models, plus a 130% increase in baggage hold volume. Other major improvements include a five-blade Spheriflex composite main rotor {{combined with the}} familiar shrouded Fenestron tail rotor to reduce vibration levels significantly. The EC155 B is powered by two 635kW (851 shp) Turbomeca Arriel 2C1 turboshaft engines mounted over the luggage hold, which feature a dual-channel Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) system. The EC155 B1 features uprated 697kW (935 shp) Arriel 2C2s. The helicopter can be fitted with an <b>anti-icing</b> system to enable the aircraft to operate in very cold climates. The all-glass cockpit is equipped with an 'Avionique Nouvelle' integrated digital flight control system featuring Eurocopter's Vehicle and Engine Management Display (VEMD), which utilizes active matrix liquid crystal displays. The EC155 is also equipped with a four-axis digital autopilot, coupled to the engine FADECs for full-envelope protection, and is offered with a Health and Usage Monitoring System (HUMS).|$|E
25|$|The EC225 {{is based}} on the Eurocopter AS332L2 Super Puma, {{improving}} upon the design with a five-blade main rotor incorporating a new airfoil shape to reduce vibration and noise levels. The blades of the rotors feature a composite spar and parabolic blade tips; they can also be equipped with an <b>anti-icing</b> system to enable the aircraft to operate within very cold climates. The helicopter is powered by two Turbomeca Makila 2A1 turboshaft engines mounted over the cabin; these engines are capable of providing 14 per cent more engine power and feature a redundant dual-channel full authority digital engine control (FADEC) system for high reliability, a further backup system is present in the event of both FADEC systems failing. The FADEC system ensures that engine power is always kept within the limits of the gearbox. Many of the mechanical components, particularly of the engines, were designed to be modular to ease maintenance, and composite materials were used where possible to reduce the aircraft's weight.|$|E
