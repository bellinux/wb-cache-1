5|$|At {{the time}} of Lambert's return to Leicester, his weight began to {{increase}} steadily, {{even though he was}} athletically active <b>and,</b> <b>by</b> <b>his</b> own account, abstained from drinking alcohol and did not eat unusual amounts of food. In 1805, Lambert's gaol closed. By this time, he weighed , and had become the heaviest authenticated person up to that point in recorded history. Unemployable and sensitive about his bulk, Lambert became a recluse.|$|E

5|$|In 1054, Yaropolk {{became the}} son of the Grand Prince, as in that year Izyaslav ascended the throne of Kiev. Izyaslav's rule and thus Yaropolk's {{security}} were however quickly challenged by Izyaslav's brother Svyatoslav <b>and</b> <b>by</b> <b>his</b> cousin Vseslav Briacheslavich. At this time among the Rurikids, there were two senior branches that could claim the Grand Princeship through descent from Vladimir the Great; namely, the descendents of Yaroslav Vladimirovich and the descendants of Izyaslav Vladimirovich.|$|E

5|$|Wolfgang was {{qualified}} by {{his skills}} {{at the keyboard}} and violin, <b>and</b> <b>by</b> <b>his</b> compositional experience, for a post as Kapellmeister; but at 17 he was too young. He therefore remained in Colloredo's employ at the Salzburg court, increasingly discontent, until his dismissal from the Archbishop's retinue during its stay in Vienna, in 1781. Leopold, unpromoted from his rank of vice-Kapellmeister, remained with the court {{until his death in}} 1787.|$|E

5|$|A {{modicum of}} {{stability}} during his childhood {{was provided by}} his aia (governess), Maria Genoveva do Rêgo e Matos, whom he loved as a mother, <b>and</b> <b>by</b> <b>his</b> aio (supervisor) friar António de Arrábida, who became his mentor. Both {{were in charge of}} Pedro's upbringing and attempted to furnish him with a suitable education. His instruction encompassed a broad array of subjects that included mathematics, political economy, logic, history and geography. He learned to speak and write not only in Portuguese, but also Latin and French. He could translate from English and understood German. Even later on, as an emperor, Pedro would devote at least two hours of each day to study and reading.|$|E
5|$|A {{text from}} Tikal {{mentions}} K'uk' Mo' {{and has been}} dated to AD406, 20 years before K'uk' Mo' Ajaw founded the new dynasty at Copán. Both names are likely {{to refer to the}} same individual originally from Tikal. Although none of the hieroglyphic texts that mention the founding of the new Copán dynasty describe how K'uk' Mo' arrived at the city, indirect evidence suggests that he conquered the city by military means. On AltarQ he is depicted as a Teotihuacano warrior with goggle eyes and a war serpent shield. When he arrived at Copán he initiated the construction of various structures, including one temple in the talud-tablero style typical of Teotihuacan and another with inset corners and apron moldings that are characteristic of Tikal. These strong links with both the Maya and Central Mexican cultures suggest that he was at least a Mexicanized Maya or possibly even from Teotihuacan. The dynasty founded by king K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' ruled the city for four centuries and included sixteen kings plus a probable pretender who would have been seventeenth in line. Several monuments have survived that were dedicated by K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' <b>and</b> <b>by</b> <b>his</b> heir.|$|E
5|$|According to Dawlatshah, Abdollah-ibn-Tahir, an Arabicized Persian, and {{governor}} of Khorasan for the Abbasid caliphs, banned publication in Persian <b>and</b> <b>by</b> <b>his</b> order all the Zoroastrians {{were forced to}} bring their religious books to be thrown in the fire. As a result, many literary works written in Pahlavi script disappeared. During the Abbasid reign the Zoroastrians, {{for the first time}} became a minority in Iran. Nevertheless, there were instances of toleration during the Abbasid era, particularly under the reign of Al-Mu'tasim who flogged an imam and muezzin for destroying a fire-temple and replacing it with a mosque.|$|E

5|$|As a child, Tarrare {{had a huge}} {{appetite}} <b>and</b> <b>by</b> <b>his</b> teens {{could eat}} {{a quarter of a}} bullock, weighing as much as Tarrare himself, in a single day. By this time, his parents could not provide for him and had forced him to leave home. For some years after this, he toured the country with a roaming band of thieves and prostitutes, begging and stealing for food, before gaining employment as a warm-up act to a travelling charlatan. Tarrare would draw a crowd by eating corks, stones and live animals, and by swallowing an entire basketful of apples one after the other. He would eat ravenously and was particularly fond of snake meat.|$|E
5|$|At Christmas 1085, William {{ordered the}} {{compilation}} {{of a survey}} of the landholdings held by himself <b>and</b> <b>by</b> <b>his</b> vassals throughout the kingdom, organised by counties. It resulted in a work now known as the Domesday Book. The listing for each county gives the holdings of each landholder, grouped by owners. The listings describe the holding, who owned the land before the Conquest, its value, what the tax assessment was, and usually the number of peasants, ploughs, and any other resources the holding had. Towns were listed separately. All the English counties south of the River Tees and River Ribble are included, and the whole work seems to have been mostly completed by 1 August 1086, when the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records that William received the results and that all the chief magnates swore the Salisbury Oath, a renewal of their oaths of allegiance. William's exact motivation in ordering the survey is unclear, but it probably had several purposes, such as making a record of feudal obligations and justifying increased taxation.|$|E
5|$|At Wimbledon, Del Potro won against Albert Ramos, Jesse Levine, and Grega Žemlja before {{advancing}} {{past the}} fourth round {{for the first}} time in his career, thanks to a win over Andreas Seppi. He then played David Ferrer and, despite slipping badly during the fifth point of the match and aggravating a pre-existing leg injury, requiring over five minutes of treatment <b>and</b> <b>by</b> <b>his</b> own admission being close to forfeiting the match, he recovered to defeat Ferrer in straight sets to advance to his first Grand Slam semifinal since the 2009 US Open without dropping a set. On 5 July, Djokovic defeated him in five sets in 4 hours and 43 minutes, making it the longest semifinal in the history of Wimbledon men's singles.|$|E

5|$|Brigadier-General Lewis Pugh Evans, of Lovesgrove, a World War I Victoria Cross {{recipient}} {{and former}} churchwarden, {{is buried in}} the churchyard. His grave {{is marked by a}} simple slate headstone giving names and dates of birth and death. He was a kinsman of Major-General Lewis Pugh, who is commemorated in the south transept. Evans was awarded the VC when, as an acting Lieutenant Colonel in The Black Watch (Royal Highlanders), on 4 October 1917, near Zonnebeke, Belgium, he was Commanding Officer of the 1st Battalion, The Lincolnshire Regiment: For most conspicuous bravery and leadership. Lt.-Col. Evans took his battalion in perfect order through a terrific enemy barrage, personally formed up all units, and led them to the assault. While a strong machine gun emplacement was causing casualties, and the troops were working round the flank, Lt.-Col. Evans rushed at it himself and by firing his revolver through the loophole forced the garrison to capitulate. After capturing the first objective he was severely wounded in the shoulder, but refused to be bandaged, and re-formed the troops, pointed out all future objectives, and again led his battalion forward. Again badly wounded, he nevertheless continued to command until the second objective was won, and, after consolidation, collapsed from loss of blood. As there were numerous casualties, he refused assistance, <b>and</b> <b>by</b> <b>his</b> own efforts ultimately reached the Dressing Station.|$|E
5|$|By 1935, {{unbeknownst to}} the public, Piłsudski had {{for several years}} been in declining health. On 12 May 1935, he died of liver cancer at Warsaw's Belweder Palace.

It was led by military personnel — former Legionnaires, members of the Polish Military Organization, veterans of the wars of 1919–21 — <b>and</b> <b>by</b> <b>his</b> political collaborators from his service as Chief of State and, later, Prime Minister and Inspector-General.|$|E
5|$|Education was a {{personal}} priority of Rutherford's, as evidenced by his retention {{of the office of}} Education Minister for his entire time as Premier <b>and</b> <b>by</b> <b>his</b> enthusiastic work in founding the University of Alberta. In 1911 he was elected by Alberta's university graduates to the University of Alberta Senate, responsible for the institution's academic affairs. In 1912 he established the Rutherford Gold Medal in English for the senior year honours English student with the highest standing; the prize still exists today as the Rutherford Memorial Medal in English. In 1912, with the University's first graduating class, Rutherford instituted a tradition of inviting convocating students to his house for tea; this tradition would last for twenty-six years.|$|E

5|$|George Frederic Watts {{was born}} in 1817, {{the son of a}} London musical {{instrument}} manufacturer. His two brothers died in 1823, and his mother in 1826, giving Watts an obsession with death throughout his life. Watts was apprenticed as a sculptor at the age of 10, <b>and</b> <b>by</b> <b>his</b> mid-teens was proficient enough as an artist to be earning a living as a portrait painter. At the age of 18 he gained admission to the Royal Academy schools, although he disliked their methods and his attendance was intermittent. From 1837, Watts was successful enough to devote himself full-time to painting.|$|E
5|$|Historians have divided {{views on}} Stefansson's {{decision}} to leave the ship. Some of the voyage's survivors were critical of his seeming indifference to their ordeal {{and the loss of}} their comrades. He escaped official censure, and was publicly honoured for his later work on the expedition despite the Canadian government's reservations about its overall management. Although Bartlett was criticised by an admiralty commission for taking Karluk into the ice, he was hailed as a hero by the public <b>and</b> <b>by</b> <b>his</b> former Karluk shipmates.|$|E
5|$|In the 2001–02 season, Horsfield {{was chosen}} Player of the Year both by Birmingham's fans <b>and</b> <b>by</b> <b>his</b> team-mates.
