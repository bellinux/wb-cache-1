25|$|Contemporary bank {{management}} {{methods for}} liquidity {{are based on}} maturity analysis of all the bank's <b>assets</b> <b>and</b> <b>liabilities</b> (off balance sheet exposures may also be included). <b>Assets</b> <b>and</b> <b>liabilities</b> are put into residual contractual maturity buckets such as 'on demand', 'less than 1 month', '2–3 months' etc. These residual contractual maturities may be adjusted to account for expected counter party behaviour such as early loan repayments due to borrowers refinancing and expected renewals of term deposits to give forecast cash flows. This analysis highlights any large future net outflows of cash and enables the bank to respond before they occur. Scenario analysis may also be conducted, depicting scenarios including stress scenarios such as a bank-specific crisis.|$|E

The issue of centralisation versus decentralisation of Crown <b>asset</b> <b>and</b> <b>liability</b> management is analysed both from a portfolio management perspective and from an organisational design perspective. Insights from private sector financial conglomerates are also incorporated. The paper concludes that individual Crown financial entities should each continue to be responsible for setting their own strategic asset allocation, after taking into account the nature of their liabilities. A central Crown body should, however, monitor and aggregate information from each of these entities and be delegated the responsibility and power to manage risks to the overall Crown balance sheet.
