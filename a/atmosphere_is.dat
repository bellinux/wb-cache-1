5|$|The {{atmosphere}} of Venus {{is composed of}} 96.5% carbon dioxide, 3.5% nitrogen, and traces of other gases, most notably sulfur dioxide. The amount of nitrogen in the <b>atmosphere</b> <b>is</b> relatively small compared {{to the amount of}} carbon dioxide, but because the <b>atmosphere</b> <b>is</b> so much thicker than that on Earth, its total nitrogen content is roughly four times higher than Earth's, even though on Earth nitrogen makes up about 78% of the atmosphere.|$|E
40|$|Propagation {{properties}} of a decentered general astigmatic partially coherent beam (i. e., decentered twisted anisotropic Gaussian Schell-model beam) in a turbulent <b>atmosphere</b> <b>are</b> investigated. Analytical formulas for the cross-spectral density and decentered parameter of a decentered astigmatic partially coherent beam propagating in a turbulent <b>atmosphere</b> <b>are</b> derived. Irradiance {{properties of}} a decentered astigmatic partially coherent beam in a turbulent <b>atmosphere</b> <b>are</b> studied graphically, and {{are found to}} be quite different from its properties in free space.

40|$|Solutions are {{presented}} for the aerothermal heating {{environment for the}} forebody heatshield of candidate Galileo probe. Entry into both the nominal and cool-heavy model <b>atmospheres</b> <b>were</b> considered. Solutions were obtained for the candidate heavy probe with a weight of 310 kg and a lighter probe with a weight of 290 kg. In the flowfield analysis, a finite difference procedure was employed to obtain benchmark predictions of pressure, radiative and convective heating rates, and the steady-state wall blowing rates. Calculated heating rates for entry into the cool-heavy model <b>atmosphere</b> <b>were</b> about 60 percent higher than those predicted for the entry into the nominal atmosphere.

5|$|Before the flyby of Voyager 2, astronomers {{suspected}} that Triton might have liquid nitrogen seas and a nitrogen/methane atmosphere with a density {{as much as}} 30% that of Earth. Like the famous overestimates of the atmospheric density of Mars, this proved incorrect. As with Mars, a denser <b>atmosphere</b> <b>is</b> postulated for its early history.|$|E

5|$|Earth has {{retained}} {{all of the}} noble gases that were present at its formation except helium. Krypton's concentration in the <b>atmosphere</b> <b>is</b> about 1 ppm. It can be extracted from liquid air by fractional distillation. The amount of krypton in space is uncertain, because measurement is derived from meteoric activity and solar winds. The first measurements suggest an abundance of krypton in space.|$|E
5|$|For some {{of these}} processes, the {{presence}} of nitrogen or oxygen gases might cause defects within the material. Argon is used in some types of arc welding such as {{gas metal arc welding}} and gas tungsten arc welding, {{as well as in the}} processing of titanium and other reactive elements. An argon <b>atmosphere</b> <b>is</b> also used for growing crystals of silicon and germanium.|$|E
5|$|Nearly {{all of the}} argon in the Earth's <b>atmosphere</b> <b>is</b> radiogenic argon-40, {{derived from}} the decay of potassium-40 in the Earth's crust.

5|$|The <b>atmosphere</b> <b>is</b> {{divided into}} a number of {{sections}} depending on altitude. The densest part of the atmosphere, the troposphere, begins at the surface and extends upwards to 65km. At the furnace-like surface the winds are slow, but {{at the top of the}} troposphere the temperature and pressure reaches Earth-like levels and clouds pick up speed to 100m/s.|$|E
5|$|The {{atmosphere}} of Mars consists of about 96% carbon dioxide, 1.93% argon and 1.89% nitrogen along with traces of oxygen and water. The <b>atmosphere</b> <b>is</b> quite dusty, containing particulates about 1.5µm in diameter which give the Martian sky a tawny color when {{seen from the}} surface. It may take on a pink hue due to iron oxide particles suspended in it.|$|E
40|$|In {{spring of}} 1998, Asian dust was {{observed}} with a Mie LIDAR in Okayama University, which can measure depolarization ratio.

5|$|Venus (0.7 AU {{from the}} Sun) is close {{in size to}} Earth (0.815 Earth masses) and, like Earth, has a thick {{silicate}} mantle around an iron core, a substantial atmosphere, and evidence of internal geological activity. It is much drier than Earth, and its <b>atmosphere</b> <b>is</b> ninety times as dense. Venus has no natural satellites. It is the hottest planet, with surface temperatures over 400 °C (752°F), most likely due {{to the amount of}} greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. No definitive evidence of current geological activity has been detected on Venus, but it has no magnetic field that would prevent depletion of its substantial atmosphere, which suggests that its <b>atmosphere</b> <b>is</b> being replenished by volcanic eruptions.|$|E
5|$|Weather radar is a {{very useful}} tool to detect the {{presence}} of hail-producing thunderstorms. However, radar data has to be complemented by a knowledge of current atmospheric conditions which can allow one {{to determine if the}} current <b>atmosphere</b> <b>is</b> conducive to hail development.|$|E
5|$|Above the troposphere, the <b>atmosphere</b> <b>is</b> usually {{divided into}} the stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere. Each layer has a {{different}} lapse rate, defining {{the rate of change}} in temperature with height. Beyond these, the exosphere thins out into the magnetosphere, where the geomagnetic fields interact with the solar wind. Within the stratosphere is the ozone layer, a component that partially shields the surface from ultraviolet light and thus is important for life on Earth. The Kármán line, defined as 100km above Earth's surface, is a working definition for the boundary between the atmosphere and outer space.|$|E

5|$|All of the Solar System planets except Mercury have {{substantial}} atmospheres because their gravity {{is strong enough}} to keep gases close to the surface. The larger giant planets are massive enough to keep large amounts of the light gases hydrogen and helium, whereas the smaller planets lose these gases into space. The composition of Earth's <b>atmosphere</b> <b>is</b> different from the other planets because the various life processes that have transpired on the planet have introduced free molecular oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Argon is {{produced}} industrially by the fractional distillation of liquid air. Argon is mostly {{used as an}} inert shielding gas in welding and other high-temperature industrial processes where ordinarily unreactive substances become reactive; for example, an argon <b>atmosphere</b> <b>is</b> used in graphite electric furnaces to prevent the graphite from burning. Argon is also used in incandescent, fluorescent lighting, and other gas-discharge tubes. Argon makes a distinctive blue-green gas laser. Argon is also used in fluorescent glow starters.|$|E
5|$|As the <b>atmosphere</b> <b>is</b> {{transparent}} {{for radio}} waves, radio telescopes in space are of most use for Very Long Baseline Interferometry; doing simultaneous observations of a source {{with both a}} satellite and a ground-based telescope and by correlating their signals to simulate a radio telescope {{the size of the}} separation between the two telescopes. Observations can be of supernova remnants, masers, gravitational lenses, starburst galaxies, and many other things.|$|E
