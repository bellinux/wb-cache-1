The core plate is unclamped and the core broken out. The bell is then carefully extracted from the case. At this stage, any remaining loam still adhered to the bell is brushed away and flash (excess metal), which may have formed below the bell rim—owing to mould contraction {{in the presence of}} hot metal—is trimmed off. This completes the casting process.|$|R

40|$|River Yamuna {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{polluted}} rivers of the India. It originates from Yamunotri glaciers in the lower Himalayas at an elevation of approximately 6387 meters. The barrages formed on the river are playing a major role in escalating the river pollution. River can be divided into five segments on the bases of hydro-logical and ecological conditions. Water quality of only one segment (Himalayan segment) meets the river water quality standards. Normally no water is allowed to flow downstream of the Himalayan segment (Te-jewala barrage) especially in the summer and winter seasons to fulfill the demand of water of the surround-ing area. Whatever water flows in the downstream of the Tajewala barrage is the untreated or partially treated domestic and Industrial wastewater contributed through various drains. The discharge of untreated domestic and industrial effluents have severely affected the quality of Yamuna River and now it falls under the category E, which makes it fit only for recreation <b>and</b> industrial <b>cooling,</b> <b>completely</b> ruling out the possi-bility for underwater life and domestic supply. Almost every year mass death of fishes is reported. Pollution levels in the Yamuna River have risen. Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) load has increased by 2. 5 time...|$|R

40|$|In a {{laboratory}} of the Aerospace Engineering {{department of the}} Polytechnic University of Milano (Italy) there is a thermal vacuum chamber. The objective {{of this type of}} machines is to test space components. The machine is being improved by student’s projects. This thesis has the objective of including optimal control capabilities for machine’s operation. The typical way of working of the thermal vacuum chamber is the following. An object is put inside the chamber. Then, the chamber is sealed and all air is realised. From this point, the object could be cooled or heated. The heat process is controlled by a PID controller while the cooling is controlled by an on-off control. For this reason, the study of chamber’s heating <b>and</b> <b>cooling</b> is <b>completely</b> different. How the heat has more flexibility to be optimized, this project has the aim of studying a possible change of the PID controller for a new microcontroller that would improve the performances of the system in terms of energy consumption. The idea is to design a smoother and more stable working method that reduces the electricity consumption. Furthermore, with the nowadays microcontrollers calculus power, it is possible to design an algorithm that changes its parameters according to machine’s working conditions. That is to say that, when the Chamber starts the process, are analysed its performances and are chosen the best parameters to work in that moment. Remember that the Chamber heating performances will change every time because of the thermal characteristics of the object that is inside. To carry out the study it has been used the theory of control of physical machines by output prediction with difference equations systems. This mathematical theory is based on the fact that, for any physical system, it is possible to predict its response (output) to any stimulation (input). All software and graphics used in this thesis has been written using the numerical computing environment MATLAB. The future code to be compiled in the microcontroller will be a compilation of the codes used in this work...|$|R

50|$|Spatter cones and spatter ramparts are {{typically}} formed by lava fountaining associated with mafic, highly fluid lavas, {{such as those}} erupted in the Hawaiian Islands.

Consequently, the spatter are not fully solid, like taffy, as they land and they bind to the underlying spatter as both often slowly ooze {{down the side of the}} cone.
