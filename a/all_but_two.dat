5|$|Demolition {{began in}} August 1967. The {{contract}} {{was awarded to}} Nordman Construction after an unsuccessful tender process. The company brought in the Magnus II, a floating crane with a lifting capacity of 400tons, which could remove <b>all</b> <b>but</b> <b>two</b> of the spans. These longer spans were pulled sideways off the piers, expecting that they would break into manageable pieces under their own weight. They proved stronger than this and remained intact, needing to be broken up in the river, with much sinking into the bed instead of being recovered.|$|E
5|$|Despite the block, Salmaniya Medical Complex's {{disaster}} {{plan was}} activated {{on the morning}} of the attack. It called for more than a dozen ambulances to search nearby areas and Pearl Roundabout. Another dozen ambulances were put on stand-by, according to a member of the medical staff. The staff said that ambulances were functioning in accordance with the plan until about 6:00am, when an alleged call from the Ministry of Interior ordered <b>all</b> <b>but</b> <b>two</b> ambulances to head back to the SMC. However, this order was ignored and more ambulances were sent to search for the injured in the areas surrounding the roundabout.|$|E
5|$|During Ruisdael's last period {{he began}} to depict {{mountain}} scenes, such as Mountainous and Wooded Landscape with a River, dateable to the late 1670s. This portrays a rugged range with the highest peak in the clouds. Ruisdael's subjects became unusually varied. The art historian Wolfgang Stechow identified thirteen themes within the Dutch Golden Age landscape genre, and Ruisdael's work encompasses <b>all</b> <b>but</b> <b>two</b> of them, excelling at most: forests, rivers, dunes and country roads, panoramas, imaginary landscapes, Scandinavian waterfalls, marines, beachscapes, winter scenes, town views, and nocturnes. Only the Italianate and foreign landscapes other than Scandinavian are absent from his oeuvre.|$|E

5|$|In 1120, the English {{political}} landscape changed dramatically. Three hundred passengers embarked on the White Ship {{to travel from}} Barfleur in Normandy to England, including {{the heir to the}} throne, William Adelin, and many other senior nobles. Stephen had intended to sail on the same ship but changed his mind at the last moment and got off to await another vessel, either out of concern for overcrowding on board the ship, or because he was suffering from diarrhoea. The ship foundered en route, and <b>all</b> <b>but</b> <b>two</b> of the passengers died, including William Adelin.|$|E
5|$|In 1120, the English {{political}} landscape had changed dramatically after the White Ship disaster. Around three hundred passengers – including Matilda's brother William Adelin {{and many other}} senior nobles – embarked one night on the White Ship to travel from Barfleur in Normandy across to England. The vessel foundered just outside the harbour, possibly {{as a result of}} overcrowding or excessive drinking by the ship's master and crew, and <b>all</b> <b>but</b> <b>two</b> of the passengers died. William Adelin was among the casualties.|$|E
5|$|Lafayette College {{encompasses}} a lively Greek community. Though {{students are not}} eligible to join these organizations until sophomore year, approximately 40.20% of eligible students join the school's fraternities and sororities. <b>All</b> <b>but</b> <b>two</b> of the Greek organizations at Lafayette are located on campus, making it a viable living option. Additionally, members of each house commit themselves to various philanthropic ventures throughout the academic year as these groups work together with the college, local, and national affiliates to help achieve the goals and ideals their organizations were founded upon.|$|E

5|$|Mumbai police {{department}} originally identified 37 suspects—including two army officers—for their alleged {{involvement in the}} plot. <b>All</b> <b>but</b> <b>two</b> of the suspects, {{many of whom are}} identified only through aliases, are Pakistani. Two more suspects arrested in the United States in October 2009 for other attacks were also found to have been involved in planning the Mumbai attacks. One of these men, Pakistani American David Headley (born Daood Sayed Gilani), was found to have made several trips to India before the attacks and gathered video and GPS information on behalf of the plotters.|$|E
5|$|The Meiningen cantatas of Johann Ludwig Bach {{were scored}} {{for the four}} vocal parts and {{a small group of}} instrumentalists, {{consisting}} of two oboes, violins, violas and continuo: at Meiningen, as with many of the smaller courts in Germany, resources were limited; it appears that continuo instruments like bassoons were available only when these works were performed elsewhere. When Bach performed his cousin's cantatas in Leipzig in 1726, he used the same orchestral forces as Meiningen for <b>all</b> <b>but</b> <b>two,</b> adding trumpets with drums in one and piccolo trumpets in another.|$|E
5|$|The Phantoms {{began to}} be {{returned}} to the USAF in 1972. No.6 Squadron ceased operating the aircraft on 4October 1972. Six F-4Es departed for the United States on 25October that year, followed by a further five in early November. The first six F-111s arrived at Amberley on 1June 1973, and six Phantoms left for the United States five days later. The final RAAF Phantom flight was made on 20June, and four of the aircraft departed the next day. The last two Phantoms left Amberley on 21June. <b>All</b> <b>but</b> <b>two</b> of the former RAAF Phantoms were subsequently converted to specialist Wild Weasel aircraft.|$|E
