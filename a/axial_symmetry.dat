5|$|Lie {{groups are}} of {{fundamental}} importance in modern physics: Noether's theorem links continuous symmetries to conserved quantities. Rotation, {{as well as}} translations {{in space and time}} are basic symmetries of the laws of mechanics. They can, for instance, be used to construct simple models—imposing, say, <b>axial</b> <b>symmetry</b> on a situation will typically lead to significant simplification in the equations one needs to solve to provide a physical description. Another example are the Lorentz transformations, which relate measurements of time and velocity of two observers in motion relative to each other. They can be deduced in a purely group-theoretical way, by expressing the transformations as a rotational symmetry of Minkowski space. The latter serves—in the absence of significant gravitation—as a model of space time in special relativity. The full symmetry group of Minkowski space, i.e., including translations, is known as the Poincaré group. By the above, it plays a pivotal role in special relativity and, by implication, for quantum field theories. Symmetries that vary with location are central to the modern description of physical interactions with the help of gauge theory.|$|E

On either side of the main entrance, a blind arch with an ornamental keystone contains a set of three steel-framed doors, along with a large arched window. Decorative friezes separate the arched window from the doors. When these entryway elements are combined, they create a processional experience through the entryway into the grand interior space. The flat-roof illusion, together with the <b>axial</b> <b>symmetry,</b> classical detailing in both structural and decorative elements, heavy ornamentation, and formal setting is typical of the Beaux-Arts style.|$|E

40|$|The {{analysis}} of complex networks is usually based on key properties such as small-worldness and vertex degree distribution. The presence of symmetric motifs {{on the other}} hand has been related to redundancy and thus robustness of the networks. In this paper we propose a method for detecting approximate <b>axial</b> <b>symmetries</b> in networks. For each pair of nodes, we define a continuous-time quantum walk which is evolved through time. By measuring the probability that the quantum walker to visits each node of the network in this time frame, we are able to determine whether the two vertices are symmetrical with respect to any axis of the graph. Moreover, we show that we are able to successfully detect approximate <b>axial</b> <b>symmetries</b> too. We show the efficacy of our approach by analysing both synthetic and real-world data...|$|R
25|$|The quadrilaterals {{formed by}} the edges between the points in any two {{symmetric}} pairs of points {{can be thought of}} as equators of the octahedron. These equators have the property (by their symmetry) that opposite pairs of quadrilateral sides have equal length. Every quadrilateral with opposite pairs of equal sides, embedded in Euclidean space, has <b>axial</b> <b>symmetry,</b> and some (such as the rectangle) have other symmetries besides. If one cuts the Bricard octahedron into two open-bottomed pyramids by slicing it along one of its equators, both of these open pyramids can flex, and the flexing motion can be made to preserve the axis of symmetry of the whole shape. But, by the symmetries of its construction, the flexing motions of these two open pyramids both move the equator along which they were cut in the same way. Therefore, they can be glued back together into a single flexing motion of the whole octahedron.|$|E

2500|$|The {{majority}} of active galaxies are very distant and show large Doppler shifts. This suggests that active galaxies {{occurred in the}} early Universe and, due to cosmic inflation, are receding away from the Milky Way at very high speeds. Quasars are the furthest active galaxies, some of them being observed at distances 12 billion light years away. Seyfert galaxies are much closer than quasars. Because light has a finite speed, looking across large distances in the Universe is equivalent to looking back in time. Therefore, the observation of active galactic nuclei at large distances and their scarcity in the nearby Universe suggests that they were much {{more common in the}} early Universe, implying that active galactic nuclei could be early stages of galactic evolution. This leads to the question about what would be the local (modern-day) counterparts of AGNs found at large redshifts. It has been proposed that NLSy1s could be the small redshift counterparts of quasars found at large redshifts (z>4). The two have many similar properties, for example: high metallicities or similar pattern of emission lines (strong Fe , weak O [...] ). Some observations suggest that AGN emission from the nucleus is not spherically symmetric and that the nucleus often shows <b>axial</b> <b>symmetry,</b> with radiation escaping in a conical region. Based on this observations, models have been devised to explain the different classes of AGNs as due to their different orientations with respect to the observational line of sight. Such models are called unified models. Unified models explain the difference between Seyfertnbsp&I and Seyfertnbsp&II galaxies as being the result of Seyfertnbsp&II galaxies being surrounded by obscuring toruses which prevent telescopes from seeing the broad line region. Quasars and blazars can be fit quite easily in this model. [...] The main problem of such an unification scheme is trying to explain why some AGN are radio loud while others are radio quiet. It has been suggested that these differences may be due to differences in the spin of the central black hole.|$|E

40|$|We {{discuss the}} fate of the <b>axial</b> U(1) <b>{{symmetry}}</b> in 2 -flavor QCD at finite temperature, where the non-singlet chiral symmetry is restored. We first summarize the previous theoretical investigation on the relation between the eigenvalue density of the Dirac operator and the <b>axial</b> U(1) <b>symmetry.</b> We show that the eigenvalue density near the origin behaves as λ^γ with γ > 2 in the chirally symmetric phase, where λ is an eigenvalue. This implies that the <b>axial</b> U(1) <b>symmetry</b> is partially restored, so that the low energy symmetry of the theory becomes SU(2) ⊗ SU(2) ⊗ Z_ 4. Secondly, we report recent numerical investigations on this issue by lattice QCD simulations with lattice chiral fermions such as Overlap or improved domain-wall fermions. Our preliminary results indicate that the eigenvalue density seems to have a gap at the origin just above T_c, the temperature of the chiral symmetry restoration, which implies the <b>axial</b> U(1) <b>symmetry</b> is effectively restored at high temperature. We also point out an importance of the exact lattice chiral symmetry to obtain correct results on this issue.

Our numerical simulations are performed on a 16 ^ 3 × 8 lattice with two flavors of dynamical quarks represented by the overlap fermion formalism. Chiral symmetry and its violation due to the axial anomaly is manifestly realized with this formulation, which is a prerequisite {{for the study of the}} effective restoration of the <b>axial</b> U(1) <b>symmetry.</b> In order to avoid discontinuity in the gauge configuration space, which occurs for the exactly chiral lattice fermions, the simulation is confined in a fixed topological sector.
