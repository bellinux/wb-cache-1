5|$|Jackson's successor, President Martin Van Buren, viewed Texas <b>annexation</b> as {{an immense}} {{political}} liability that would empower the anti-slavery northern Whig opposition – especially if <b>annexation</b> provoked {{a war with}} Mexico. Presented with a formal <b>annexation</b> proposal from Texas minister Memucan Hunt, Jr. in August 1837, Van Buren summarily rejected it. <b>Annexation</b> resolutions presented separately in each house of Congress were either soundly defeated or tabled through filibuster. After the election of 1838, new Texas president Mirabeau B. Lamar withdrew his republic's offer of <b>annexation</b> due to these failures. Texans were at an <b>annexation</b> impasse when John Tyler entered the White House in 1841.|$|E
5|$|In {{the general}} election, Polk {{narrowly}} defeated Clay, who opposed <b>annexation.</b> Lame-duck President Tyler organized a joint House–Senate {{vote on the}} Texas treaty which passed, requiring only a simple majority. he signed a bill of <b>annexation</b> on March 1, With President Polk's support, the Texas <b>annexation</b> treaty {{was approved by the}} Texas Republic in 1845. A bill to admit Texas as the 28th state of the Union was signed by Polk on December 29, 1845.|$|E
5|$|The formal {{controversy}} over {{the legality of the}} <b>annexation</b> of Texas {{stems from the fact that}} Congress approved the <b>annexation</b> of Texas as a state, rather than a territory, with simple majorities in each house, instead of annexing the land by Senate treaty, as was done with Native American lands. Tyler's extralegal joint resolution maneuver in 1844 exceeded strict constructionist precepts, but was passed by Congress in 1845 as part of a compromise bill. The success of the joint house Texas <b>annexation</b> set a precedent that would be applied to Hawaii's <b>annexation</b> in 1897.|$|E

5|$|After {{assuming}} {{office in}} 1897, United States President William McKinley signed {{the treaty of}} <b>annexation</b> for the Republic of Hawaii, but it failed to pass in the United States Senate after the Kūʻē Petitions were submitted by Kaulia, Kalauokalani, John Richardson and William Auld {{as evidence of the}} strong resistance of the Native Hawaiian community to <b>annexation.</b> Members of Hui Aloha ʻĀina collected over 21,000 signatures opposing an <b>annexation</b> treaty. Another 17,000 signatures were collected by members of Hui Kālaiʻāina but not submitted to the Senate because they were asking for the restoration of the queen and the delegates. The petitions were used as evidence of the strong resistance of the Hawaiian community to <b>annexation</b> and the treaty was defeated in the Senate. After the failure of the treaty, Hawaii was instead annexed by means of a joint resolution called the Newlands Resolution, in July 1898, shortly after the outbreak of the Spanish–American War.|$|E

At the same time, the city annexed all of South Omaha, including the Dahlman and Burlington Road neighborhoods.

5|$|Clay {{believed}} the Democrats would again nominate Martin Van Buren, who was ardently opposed to <b>annexation,</b> {{and this would}} keep <b>annexation</b> from becoming {{an issue in the}} campaign. Clay was nominated by acclamation at the Whig convention in Baltimore a week later. At the Democratic nominating convention a month later, however, Van Buren was unable to secure his party's nomination, and the Democrats instead nominated James K. Polk, who strongly favored <b>annexation.</b> Clay tried to moderate his views on <b>annexation,</b> but his changes of position drew opposition from supporters of {{both sides of the issue}} as he attempted to find a middle ground. Polk went on to win the election in a close race. This was the last time Clay would be nominated for president, and many Whigs believed that, following Clay's defeat, Crittenden was the new leader of their party.|$|E

5|$|Grant's {{success with}} Britain was {{undermined}} by {{his attempt to}} annex the Dominican Republic, an independent nation unable to pay its debt. Many Americans believed a Caribbean naval base would establish naval dominance and be useful in protecting shipping from piracy in a potential isthmian canal. Anti-imperialist Republicans had previously rejected a Johnson administration treaty to establish a Samaná Bay naval base. Grant took interest in Dominican <b>annexation</b> and sent his secretary, Orville E. Babcock, there to consult with Buenaventura Báez, the pro-annexation Dominican president. Babcock returned in September 1869 with a draft treaty of <b>annexation,</b> although Fish had not given him any diplomatic authority. Given such authority by Fish, Babcock visited the island nation a second time making a treaty for Dominican <b>annexation</b> and the lease of Samaná Bay. The cabinet discussed the treaties at a meeting on December 21. Fish dismissed <b>annexation,</b> seeing the island as politically unstable. Grant supported it, believing acquisition of the majority-black nation would increase commerce, create a refuge for African Americans, and help to exploit the island's natural resources. He lobbied Sumner in hopes of influencing him to help with passage of the treaties. Fish added to the effort out of loyalty to Grant, but to no avail; Sumner was set against <b>annexation</b> and on June 30, 1870, the Senate rejected the treaties. A congressional investigation headed by Senator Carl Schurz revealed speculators had promoted the treaties' passage. Unwilling to admit defeat, Grant convinced Congress to send a commission to investigate. Although the commission approved Grant's call for <b>annexation</b> in its findings, the Senate remained opposed and Grant was forced to abandon further efforts. Grant retaliated by firing Sumner's friend and Minister to Great Britain, John Lothrop Motley, while he pressured the Senate to depose Sumner of his chairmanship.|$|E
5|$|In 1843, U.S. President John Tyler, unaligned {{with any}} {{political}} party, decided independently {{to pursue the}} <b>annexation</b> of Texas {{in a bid to}} gain a base of popular support for another four years in office. His official motivation was to outmaneuver suspected diplomatic efforts by the British government for emancipation of slaves in Texas, which would undermine slavery in the United States. Through secret negotiations with the Houston administration, Tyler secured a treaty of <b>annexation</b> in April 1844. When the documents were submitted to the US Senate for ratification, the details of the terms of <b>annexation</b> became public and the question of acquiring Texas took center stage in the presidential election of 1844.|$|E
5|$|In 1869, Grant {{proposed}} to annex the independent largely black nation of the Dominican Republic, {{then known as}} Santo Domingo. Previously in 1868, President Andrew Johnson had attempted to annex the Dominican Republic and Santo Domingo, but the House of Representatives defeated two resolutions {{for the protection of}} the Dominican Republic and Santo Domingo and for the <b>annexation</b> of the Dominican Republic. In July, 1869 Grant sent Orville E. Babcock and Rufus Ingalls who negotiated a draft treaty with Dominican Republic President Buenaventura Báez for the <b>annexation</b> of Santo Domingo to the United States and the sale of Samaná Bay for $2million. To keep the island nation and Báez secure in power, Grant ordered naval ships, unauthorized by Congress, to secure the island from invasion and internal insurrection. Báez signed an <b>annexation</b> treaty on November 19, 1869 offered by Babcock under federal State department authorization. Secretary Fish drew up a final draft of the proposal and offered $1.5million to the Dominican national debt, the <b>annexation</b> of Santo Domingo as an American state, the United States' acquisition of the rights for Samaná Bay for 50 years with an annual $150,000 rental, and guaranteed protection from foreign intervention. On January 10, 1870 the Santo Domingo treaty was submitted to the Senate for ratification. Despite his support of the <b>annexation,</b> Grant made the mistakes of not informing Congress of the treaty or encouraging national acceptance and enthusiasm.|$|E

5|$|On April 22, 1844, Secretary Calhoun {{signed the}} treaty of <b>annexation</b> and ten days later {{delivered}} it to the Senate for consideration in secret session. The details of the treaty negotiations and supporting documents were leaked by Senator Benjamin Tappan of Ohio to the press. Tappan, a Democrat, was an opponent of <b>annexation</b> and of slavery. The terms of the Tyler-Texas treaty {{and the release of}} Calhoun's letter to British ambassador Richard Pakenham exposed the <b>annexation</b> campaign as a program to expand and preserve slavery. In the Pakenham letter, Calhoun alleged that the institution of slavery contributed to the physical and mental well-being of Southern slaves. The U.S. Senate was compelled to open its debates on ratification to public scrutiny, and hopes for its passage by the two-thirds majority required by the Constitution were abandoned by administration supporters. In linking Texas <b>annexation</b> to the expansion of slavery, Calhoun had alienated many who might previously have supported the treaty.|$|E
5|$|On May 5, 1845, Texas President Jones {{called for}} a {{convention}} on July 4, 1845, to consider the <b>annexation</b> and a constitution. On June 23, the Texan Congress accepted the US Congress's joint resolution of March 1, 1845, annexing Texas to the United States, and consented to the convention. On July 4, the Texas convention debated the <b>annexation</b> offer and almost unanimously passed an ordinance assenting to it. The convention remained in session through August 28, and adopted the Constitution of Texas on August 27, 1845. The citizens of Texas approved the <b>annexation</b> ordinance and new constitution on October 13, 1845.|$|E

5|$|Regular Democrats {{were forced}} to call for <b>annexation</b> of Texas in their platform, {{but there was a}} bitter battle for the presidential nomination. Ballot after ballot, Van Buren failed to win the {{necessary}} super-majority of Democratic votes, and slowly fell in the rankings. It was not until the ninth ballot that the Democrats turned their sights to James K. Polk, a less prominent candidate who supported <b>annexation.</b> They found him to be perfectly suited for their platform, and he was nominated with two-thirds of the vote. Tyler considered his work vindicated, and implied in an acceptance letter that <b>annexation</b> was his true priority rather than election.|$|E
5|$|Senate {{and house}} legislators who had favored Benton's renegotiated {{version of the}} Texas <b>annexation</b> bill had been assured that President Tyler would sign the joint house measure, but leave its {{implementation}} to the incoming Polk administration. But, during his last day in office, President Tyler, with the urging of his Secretary of State Calhoun, decided to act decisively to improve the odds for the immediate <b>annexation</b> of Texas. On March 3, 1845, with his cabinet's assent, he dispatched an offer of <b>annexation</b> to the Republic of Texas by courier, exclusively {{under the terms of}} the Brown–Foster option of the joint house measure. Secretary Calhoun apprised President-elect Polk of the action, who demurred without comment. Tyler justified his preemptive move on the grounds that Polk was likely to come under pressure to abandon immediate <b>annexation</b> and reopen negotiations under the Benton alternative.|$|E
5|$|Texans were {{hesitant}} {{to pursue a}} US-Texas treaty without a written commitment of military defense from America, since a full-scale military attack by Mexico seemed likely when the negotiations became public. If ratification of the <b>annexation</b> measure stalled in the US Senate, Texas could face a war alone against Mexico. Because only Congress could declare war, the Tyler administration lacked the constitutional authority to commit the US to support of Texas. But when Secretary Upshur provided a verbal assurance of military defense, President Houston, responding to urgent calls for <b>annexation</b> from the Texas Congress of December 1843, authorized the reopening of <b>annexation</b> negotiations.|$|E

5|$|Wickliffe {{supported}} the <b>annexation</b> of Texas, {{an issue that}} helped seal Clay's defeat in the 1844 presidential canvass. In 1845, President James K. Polk sent Wickliffe as an envoy on a secret mission to the Republic of Texas. Originally, his purpose was to quash British and French attempts to forestall the U.S. <b>annexation</b> of Texas, but he later joined Commodore Robert F. Stockton in lobbying leaders of the Republic of Texas to order their military forces across the Rio Grande into Mexico. Stockton and Wickliffe believed that if they could provoke a Texan invasion of Mexico, the United States would have a stronger case for annexing Texas. Ultimately, they failed in convincing the Texans to invade, but succeeded in drumming up support for <b>annexation.</b> Both Wickliffe's position on <b>annexation</b> and his willingness to carry out Polk's assignment further distanced him from the Whigs.|$|E
5|$|Beato, who {{had covered}} {{military}} operations in India and China, was probably attracted by {{the news of the}} <b>annexation.</b> While he arrived in Burma after the main military operations ended, he would still get {{to see more of the}} action, as the <b>annexation</b> by the British led to an insurgency which lasted for the following decade.

Nonetheless, the majority of voters in 1889 supported <b>annexation</b> {{perhaps because of the}} city’s water system for fire prevention or because of the belief that township government had become too unwieldy.
