For this purpose, two types of pasta have been created, with different percentages of mushroom, 10 % and 20 %, but also a blank sample obtained in the same conditions, but without mushroom powder. To achieve the goal the following analyzes were conducted: proteins, total polyphenols, antioxidant activity, fat, humidity, ashes, acidity, increase in volume of the boiled pasta and customers’ preferences.

Th 2, Th 22, Tv 3 and SP grew extensively over Am 1 colonies, disintegrating the rhizomorphs. Isolate Tham 1 of T hamatum was the most effective in reducing mycelial growth of A. mellea isolate 2 (Am 2), followed by Tv 3. Th 12, Th 22, Tv 1, Tv 3 and SP inhibited the initiation and growth of rhizomorphs of Am 2. Regeneration tests showed that both Am 1 and Am 2 attacked by Trichoderma isolates and SP were no longer viable. Th 23 and SP were almost as effective in vivo as in vitro. But isolate Co of Chaetomium olivaceum, which was ineffective in vitro, was found effective in vivo. Conversely, Th 2, which exhibited good antagonistic activity in vitro, performed poorly in vivo. These results show that the in vitro and in vivo efficacies of potential antagonists may not necessarily be closely correlated. Hence, there is a danger that potentially effective isolates may be discarded if decisions are made only on the basis of preliminary screening tests carried out under laboratory conditions...|$|R

40|$|Agaricus subrufescens, {{known as}} Sun Mushroom, is a high-value {{mushroom}} {{because of its}} medicinal properties, used as nutraceutical food to stimulate {{the immune system and}} to prevent some diseases, including cancer. Mushrooms are generally characterized by their great ability to bioaccumulate heavy metals and other toxic substances from the mushroom compost. Sugarcane bagasse is a common raw material used in mushroom compost production for Agaricus subrufescenscultivation, whereas insecticides, such as fipronil, can be applied to combat several pests in sugarcane crops. For this reason, we aimed to assess mushroom yield and fipronil bioaccumulation in Sun Mushroom, regarding different concentrations <b>added</b> to the <b>mushroom</b> compost (0, 8, 16 and 32 mg kg- 1) and casing layer (0, 2, 4 and 8 mg kg- 1).

50|$|In {{addition}} to traditional Mario {{elements such as}} Goombas, warp pipes and power ups, players are able to manipulate the behavior of various elements in unique ways. For example, they can stack enemies, have hazards come out of question blocks and warp pipes, use shells as protective helmets, and make cannons and Lakitu emit any chosen objects. These combinations are possible because editing tools in the game work in tandem with one another. This allows players to enlarge an enemy by giving it a mushroom, grant an enemy the ability to fly by giving it wings, combine different attributes, and more. The Sound Frog adds audiovisual effects to particular locations, including microphone-recorded sounds, though user-generated sounds are removed from uploaded courses. Editing elements are introduced gradually, over a course of nine days, with new elements unlocking as the player spends more time creating courses.

40|$|Functional foods {{may have}} a role to play in either {{preventing}} or treating obesity. Both preventive and treatment studies were carried out in this project. The preventive study was carried out in rats fed a high-fat diet (HFD) adding low dose (LD), medium dose (MD) and high dose (HD) of Oats (O) and Shiitake mushroom (M) containing 2 g/kg, 6 g/kg and 18 g/kg beta-glucans (LD-O, MD-O, HD-O and LD-M, MD-M, HD-M) compared to HFD control group for 6 weeks. The treatment study was carried out in obese rats induced by HFD for 8 weeks followed by <b>adding</b> Shiitake <b>mushroom</b> powder containing 6 g/kg, 12 g/kg and 18 g/kg beta-glucans in the diets as low, medium and high doses. The interesting findings of this study overall are, the diets with a Shiitake mushroom appeared to be stronger lowering plasma lipid than the diets with enriched oats which include their beneficial effect in lowering weight. The results showed that both oats and Shiitake mushroom enriched diets had significantly higher faecal fat exclusion compared to the HFD; while Shiitake mushroom enriched diet had lower levels of plasma triacylglycerol (TAG) level, total fat mass deposition and body weight gain compared to oat enriched diets. The HD-M group had the highest amount of faecal fat exclusion among all groups. In comparison to HFD, the HD-M diet prevented the increase in plasma TAG, fat deposition and body fat index and also resulted in decreased energy efficiency. Negative correlations were found between the amount of Shiitake mushroom supplementation and body weight gain, plasma TAG, and total fat masses. This study demonstrated that lowering of plasma TAG and prevention of BWG using a Shiitake mushroom enriched diet was also possibly influenced by eritadenine content in Shiitake mushroom. We found that the HD-M group significantly increased liver weight per 100 g body weight and liver TAG compared with rats fed the LD-M and MD-M diets but it was not significantly different from rats fed the HFD. The rats in the HD-M group showed the highest incidence of hepatic ballooning, resulting from decreased ratio of liver phosphatidylcholine (PC) to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), which can probably be attributed to eritadenine contained in Shiitake mushrooms. This decrease ratio of PC to PE has been associated with increase membrane permeability and hence promoting influx of lipoproteins into the liver. Unlike the prevention study, the treatment study showed no significant effects. The Shiitake mushroom did not accomplish the dietary treatment effect on existing obesity. In conclusion, this study revealed that a Shiitake mushroom enriched diet was more powerful in preventing high-fat diet induced obesity than oats enriched diet through the increased fat faecal exclusion; however, increased TAG in liver can be an issue when ingesting a high dose of Shiitake mushroom. But, the addition of choline chloride to the diet may help to prevent this side effect. This warrants further investigation. The treatment study showed that shiitake mushroom enriched diet was not sufficient to reverse obesity. This information may provide significant information assisting the use of Shiitake mushrooms and oats as functional foods for the prevention of obesity...|$|R
