5|$|Burtt {{had visited}} Niagara Falls in 1987 {{and used his}} {{recordings}} from his trip for the sounds of wind. He ran around a hall with a canvas bag up to record the sandstorm though. For the scene where WALL-E runs from falling shopping carts, Burtt and his daughter went to a supermarket <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>a</b> recorder in their cart. They crashed it around {{the parking lot and}} then let it tumble down a hill. To create Hal (WALL-E's pet cockroach)'s skittering, he recorded the clicking caused by taking apart and reassembling handcuffs.|$|E
5|$|Eckfeldt also {{produced}} a pattern disme, of which {{only a few}} were struck. When the Mint's first cents (produced in 1793) {{were found to be}} excessively crude and attracted public ridicule, Eckfeldt was called upon to design replacements. He placed a wreath {{on the back of the}} cent instead of the original chain, <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>a</b> trefoil under Liberty's head on the obverse. He also engraved the first half cent dies later the same year.|$|E

5|$|Gummadi Venkateswara Rao was {{recommended}} to Chakrapani by Madhavapeddi Venkatramaiah. After auditioning other actors, Chakrapani asked Venkateswara Rao {{to make a}} cameo appearance as an interviewer. He received 5001,000 for a day's work, a generous salary for the time; actors in major film roles received 2,000 for 20 days of work. Chakrapani justified Venkateswara Rao's salary {{by saying that the}} actor's family included three children who had moved to Madras (now Chennai). For a photo shoot, Rama Rao lent Venkateswara Rao his coat <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>a</b> tilaka on his forehead. Allu Ramalingaiah was cast as the comic teacher-cum-ayurvedic-doctor Panthulu.|$|E
5|$|In 1054, {{relations}} between the Eastern and Western traditions within the Christian Church reached a terminal crisis, known as the East–West Schism. Although there was a formal declaration of institutional separation, on July 16, when three papal legates entered the Hagia Sophia during Divine Liturgy on a Saturday afternoon <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>a</b> bull of excommunication on the altar, the so-called Great Schism was actually the culmination of centuries of gradual separation. Unfortunately the legates {{did not know that}} the Pope had died, an event that made the excommunication void and the excommunication only applied to the Patriarch who responded by excommunicating the legates.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Heathen organisations {{emerged in the}} United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Australia, and Iceland, largely {{independently}} from each other. This has been partly attributed to the wider growth of the modern Pagan movement during the 1960s and 1970s, {{as well as the}} development of the New Age milieu, both of which encouraged the establishment of new religious movements intent on reviving pre-Christian belief systems. Further Heathen groups then emerged in the 1990s and 2000s, many of which distanced themselves from overtly political agendas <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>a</b> stronger emphasis on historical authenticity than their 1960s and 1970s forebears.|$|E

5|$|On 13 May, Del Piero started Juventus's final league game of {{the season}} against Atalanta, marking the {{occasion}} and the victory of their 28th Serie A title by scoring a goal. Twenty-seven minutes into the match, Del Piero picked the ball up {{at the edge of the}} penalty box <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>a</b> shot past Giorgio Frezzolini to make the score 2–0, helping Juventus to go undefeated in Serie A that season. He was substituted off after 59 minutes to an emotional response from both sets of players and supporters, as he made a lap of honour around the pitch. This was Alessandro Del Piero's final Serie A appearance for Juventus.|$|E
5|$|Soon, however, Pei and {{his team}} won the support of several key {{cultural}} icons, including the conductor Pierre Boulez and Claude Pompidou, widow of former French President Georges Pompidou, after whom another controversial museum was named. In an attempt to soothe public ire, Pei took a suggestion from then-mayor of Paris Jacques Chirac <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>a</b> full-sized cable model of the pyramid in the courtyard. During the four days of its exhibition, an estimated 60,000people visited the site. Some critics eased their opposition after witnessing the proposed scale of the pyramid.|$|E
5|$|The next landing {{occurred}} on 10 February 1948 by Larsen's ship Brategg. Biological, geological and hydrographic surveys underwent for three days, before the pack ice forced the expedition to leave. The expedition built a hut <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>a</b> {{copy of the}} document of occupation from 1929 inside. On 23 June 1961, Peter I Island became subject to the Antarctic Treaty, after Norway's signing of the treaty in 1959. Since then, {{there have been several}} landings on the island by various nations for scientific investigations, as well as a limited number of ships that have successfully landed tourists on the island.|$|E

5|$|The {{whole of}} the Pendennis site {{was placed in the}} {{guardianship}} of the Ministry of Works and opened to visitors; the Ministry focused its attention on the 16th-century castle and many of the more modern buildings were destroyed. The barracks were used as a youth hostel between 1963 and 2000. The heritage agency English Heritage took over control of the castle in 1984, <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>a</b> greater priority on the conservation of its more modern features. Extensive work was carried out across the castle in the 1990s to refurbish the fortifications and open new facilities for visitors, accompanied by archaeological surveys and excavations; in the 2000s, the sergeant's mess and the custodian's house were converted into holiday cottages.|$|E
5|$|Alarmed by this Spartan naval resurgence, the Athenians {{sent out}} a fleet of 40 triremes under Thrasybulus. He, judging that he could {{accomplish}} more by campaigning where the Spartan fleet was not than by challenging it directly, sailed to the Hellespont. Once there, he won over several major states to the Athenian side <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>a</b> duty on ships sailing past Byzantium, restoring a source of revenue that the Athenians had relied on in the late Peloponnesian War. He then sailed to Lesbos, where, {{with the support of}} the Mytileneans, he defeated the Spartan forces on the island and won over a number of cities. While still on Lesbos, however, Thrasybulus was killed by raiders from the city of Aspendus.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{dissolution}} of Netley, on 3 August 1536, King Henry granted the abbey buildings {{and some of its}} estates to Sir William Paulet, his Lord Treasurer and subsequently Marquess of Winchester. As soon as he took over, Sir William started the process of turning the abbey into a palace suitable {{for one of the most}} important politicians in England. He converted the nave of the church into his great hall, kitchens and service buildings, the transepts and crossing became a series of luxurious apartments for his personal use, the presbytery was retained as the chapel of the mansion. The monks' dormitory became the long gallery of the mansion and the latrine block became several grand chambers. He demolished the south range and refectory and built a new one with a central turreted gatehouse to provide the appropriate seigneurial emphasis needed for a classic Tudor courtyard house. He likewise demolished the cloister walks to make a central courtyard for his house <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>a</b> large fountain in the centre. The precinct buildings were demolished to create formal gardens and terraces.|$|E

5|$|Harmless to humans, the Pondicherry shark {{was caught}} {{and used for}} meat. Fewer than 20 {{specimens}} have been deposited in museum collections, {{most of which were}} collected prior to 1900. This shark's rarity originally led to fears that it may be possibly extinct. However, in 2016, the Pondicherry shark was rediscovered in the Sri Lankan Menik and Kumbukkam rivers. Two photographs of this species exist; one taken from above by a group of nature enthusiasists, as well as one taken from the side by a freshwater fish survey. Given that artisanal and commercial fishing activity across its range is heavy, unregulated, and intensifying, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed the Pondicherry shark as Critically Endangered <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>a</b> high priority on locating any surviving populations.|$|E
5|$|In 1987, the Kilcoynes {{decided to}} sell the stadium to {{property}} developers, having recently purchased it from the Jesuits. The last game at Glenmalure Park was an FAI Cup semi-final between Shamrock Rovers and Sligo Rovers on 12 April 1987. The game saw a pitch invasion by supporters protesting against {{the sale of the}} stadium. The next season, the supporters formed an association called Keep Rovers at Milltown <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>a</b> picket on home games at Tolka Park, effectively bankrupting the club's owners. They accumulated funds, through supporter contributions, in an effort to purchase the stadium but failed to match the offer of a property developer to whom the Kilcoynes eventually sold the site. After a lengthy appeals process, Glenmalure Park was demolished in 1990 to be replaced by an apartment complex.|$|E
5|$|Nagatos {{presence}} at Yokosuka was {{revealed to the}} Allies by photographs taken during the 10July raid on the Tokyo area. On 16July Halsey and Vice Admiral Bernard Rawlings, the commander of TF37, met to plan raids on the Tokyo area. Halsey was determined to sink {{the remnants of the}} IJN, <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>a</b> particularly strong emphasis on attacking Nagato as she had been Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto's flagship during the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. Due to the battleship's position within a well defended harbor, the Third Fleet's planners assessed that aircraft which attempted the straight and level flight needed to launch torpedoes against her would suffer heavy losses, and so decided to use dive bombing tactics instead. As the landward side of the naval base was mountainous, the approaches which could be used by dive bombers were limited.|$|E

5|$|The Japanese navy {{expanded}} their military facilities from 1937 onwards. More labourers from Japan and Korea {{were employed to}} construct the facilities to complete the facilities within {{a short period of}} time. The number of indentured labourers rose to more than 10,000 throughout Micronesia, <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>a</b> heavy strain on the islands' scarce resources. Many Okinawan and Japanese labourers and permanent settlers were repartriated back to their homeland. Japanese men were conscripted into regular services, and Palauans who held administrative posts in the police force were reallocated jobs in the agricultural sector. The Japanese civilians {{played an important role in}} the islands' propaganda activities. As food resources were cut off from Japan, many Japanese encountered greater difficulties in dealing with starvation than their Palauan counterparts, who were more knowledgeable with tropical survival skills.|$|E
5|$|The {{borders of}} German South-West Africa had been settled via {{treaties}} with Portugal (1886) and Britain (1890), but the coast line {{had not been}} surveyed in detail. Falke was tasked with locating a suitable port to connect to the capital at Windhuk. She departed Luanda on 23 January 1893 and arrived in Cape Cross four days later. The ship surveyed the area thoroughly, and discovered a Portuguese padrão. It had been placed there by the Portuguese explorer Diogo Cão in the late 15th century. Falkes crew removed it {{to protect it from}} further weathering <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>a</b> wooden cross to mark the location. The ship's crew received a period of rest from 14 to 16 March, after which time Falke steamed back to Kamerun, stopping in several ports along the way and arriving in Duala on 29 April. There, the stone monument was unloaded and later transported back to Berlin for preservation by the steamer , which departed Duala on 29 October. A granite copy, carried by the cruiser , was installed in its place in 1895.|$|E
5|$|Washington and the American {{command in}} Saigon {{considered}} the operation a great success, {{both as a}} test of the new American policy of Vietnamization and in setting back any communist offensives planned against the Saigon area during the next year. The logistical haul overrun and captured by the allied forces in the Base Areas was indeed impressive. 20,000 individual and 2,500 crew-served weapons; 7,000 tons of rice; 1,800 tons of munitions; 140,000 rockets and artillery shells; 435 vehicles; 29 tons of communications equipment; 55 tons of medical supplies; and 199,552 anti-aircraft rounds. The incursion was, however, limited in its scale and scope. Nixon had limited the depth of penetration by U.S. forces to 35 kilometers <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>a</b> 30 June deadline for the withdrawal of American troops to South Vietnam.|$|E
