40|$|The cycling of {{atmospheric}} aerosols through clouds can change their chemical and physical properties and thus modify how aerosols affect cloud microphysics and, subsequently, precipitation and climate. Current knowledge about aerosol processing by clouds is rather limited to chemical reactions within water droplets in warm low-altitude clouds. However, in cold high-altitude cirrus clouds and anvils of high convective {{clouds in the}} tropics and midlatitudes, humidified aerosols freeze to form ice, which upon exposure to subsaturation conditions with respect to ice can sublimate, leaving behind residual modified aerosols. This freeze-drying process can occur in various types of clouds. Here we simulate an <b>atmospheric</b> <b>freeze-drying</b> cycle of aerosols in laboratory experiments using proxies for atmospheric aerosols. We find that aerosols that contain organic material that undergo such a process can form highly porous aerosol particles with a larger diameter and a lower density than the initial homogeneous aerosol. We attribute this morphology change to phase separation upon freezing followed by a glass transition of the organic material that can preserve a porous structure after ice sublimation. A porous structure may explain the previously observed enhancement in ice nucleation efficiency of glassy organic particles. We find that highly porous aerosol particles scatter solar light less efficiently than nonporous aerosol particles. Using a combination of satellite and radiosonde data, we show that highly porous aerosol formation can readily occur in highly convective clouds, which are widespread in the tropics and midlatitudes. These observations may have implications for subsequent cloud formation cycles and aerosol albedo near cloud edges. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at: [URL] (SFD) involves spraying a solution into a cold medium, and freeze-drying the resultant frozen particles, {{which can be}} performed by contacting the particles with a cold, dry gas stream in a fluidized bed, typically at atmospheric pressure. This enables much faster drying rates than are usually possible by conventional freeze-drying, due to the small particle sizes involved. However, the quantities of gas required for <b>atmospheric</b> fluidized bed <b>freeze-drying</b> are prohibitively expensive. This {{has led to a}} process modification whereby fluidization is performed at sub-atmospheric pressures, which still allows rapid freeze-drying, but using much less gas. This study demonstrates the fluidized bed spray-freeze-drying technique at sub-atmospheric pressures (0. 1 bar) using whey protein isolate solution (20...|$|R
