5|$|Before {{his final}} {{undergraduate}} year at McMaster, Innis spent a summer {{teaching at the}} Northern Star School in the frontier farming community of Landonville near Vermilion, Alberta. The experience gave him <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vastness of Canada. He also learned about Western grievances over high interest rates and steep transportation costs. In his final undergraduate year, Innis focused on history and economics. He kept in mind a remark made by history lecturer W.S. Wallace that the economic interpretation of history {{was not the only}} possible one, but that it went the deepest.|$|E
5|$|In Malagasy culture lemurs, {{and animals}} in general, have souls (ambiroa) which can get revenge if mocked while alive or if {{killed in a}} cruel fashion. Because of this, lemurs, like many other {{elements}} of daily life, have {{been a source of}} taboos, known locally as fady, which can be based around stories with four basic principles. A village or region may believe that a certain type of lemur may be the ancestor of the clan. They may also believe that a lemur's spirit may get revenge. Alternatively, the animal may appear as a benefactor. Lemurs are also thought to impart their qualities, good or bad, onto human babies. In general, fady extend beyond <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forbidden, but can include events that bring bad luck.|$|E
5|$|Lithuania {{had been}} part of the Russian Empire since the {{partitions}} of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in the late 18th century. After the unsuccessful uprising of 1863, Lithuania was subjected to Russification policies: the Lithuanian press ban was initiated, schools were required to teach in the Russian language, Roman Catholics could not hold positions in government institutions and could own only limited amounts of land, and political rights were restricted. However, these measures had limited effects on the Lithuanian National Revival, and <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lithuanian national identity continued to grow. The first Lithuanian political parties, the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania and Lithuanian Democratic Party, included goals of political autonomy for Lithuania within the Russian Empire in their basic program.|$|E

5|$|Modern scholarship, {{noting the}} way in which similar {{accounts}} were associated in ancient times with the deaths of notable figures, sees the phenomenon as a literary invention that attempts to convey <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> power of Jesus in the face of death, or a sign of God's displeasure with the Jewish people. Scholars have also noted the ways in which this episode appears to draw on earlier biblical accounts of darkness from the Old Testament.|$|E
5|$|Other translators {{have placed}} much greater weight {{on trying to}} convey <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poetic forms used by Du Fu. Vikram Seth in Three Chinese Poets uses English-style rhyme schemes, whereas Keith Holyoak in Facing the Moon approximates the Chinese rhyme scheme; both use end-stopped lines and {{preserve}} some degree of parallelism. In The Selected Poems of Du Fu, Burton Watson follows the parallelisms quite strictly, persuading the western reader {{to adapt to the}} poems rather than vice versa. Similarly, he deals with the allusion of the later works by combining literal translation with extensive annotation.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{conceived}} when Tetsuya Mizuguchi asked Masahiro Sakurai {{to make a}} falling block puzzle. Believing that the genre had not evolved since Tetris Attack (1995), Sakurai {{came up with the}} idea of having the blocks fall and shooting back up. The game's prototype was created in three days by a designer, a programmer, and a graphic artist. It was inspired by the TV series 24, the film The Matrix, and the Missile Command game. According to Mizuguchi, 24 camera work and the beginning of The Matrix (with dripping, green computer code) were the basis of the puzzle-game concept. In a Famitsu interview, Sakurai said that the opening CG video explaining its backstory was added to provide <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game's world.|$|E

5|$|The work {{ends with}} the {{following}} words: Fichte and the powerful men who have inherited his ideals, when they see children, think: 'Here is material that I can manipulate'... All this, to any person with natural affection for the young, is horrible; just as we teach children to avoid being destroyed by motor cars if they can, so we should teach them to avoid being destroyed by cruel fanatics... This is the task of a liberal education: to give <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> value of things other than domination, to help create wise citizens of a free community, and through the combination of citizenship with liberty in individual creativeness to enable men to give to human life that splendour which some few have shown that it can achieve (Russell 1938:251).|$|E
5|$|Angband (1990) was {{developed}} by Alex Cutler and Andy Astrand while attending the University of Warwick. Having played UMoria, they wanted to expand the game even further. Working from UMorias code, they {{increased the number of}} levels and monsters, flavored the game based on Angband, the massive fortress controlled by Morgoth from Tolkien's fiction, and incorporated more of the deadlier creatures described within the Middle Earth mythology. They kept the Balrog as a difficult creature that must be overcome at a mid-game level, while Morgoth became the final boss the player must defeat to win the game. Following Cutler and Astrand's graduation, Sean March and Geoff Hill took over the development to see the game through to a public release outside of the university, adding in elements such as giving the player <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rewards and dangers of a level when they entered it the first time.|$|E
5|$|To give <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dry {{and dusty}} {{environment}} of the Dust Bowl, smoke and dirt were constantly blown through tubes onto the set. The actors' clothes were ragged and drenched in dirt, and Carnivàle had approximately 5,000 people costumed in the show's first season alone. The creative team listened to 1930s' music and radio and read old Hollywood magazines to get the period's sound, language, and slang right. The art department had an extensive research library of old catalogs, among them an original 1934 Sears Catalog, which were purchased at flea markets and antique stores. The East European background of some characters and Asian themes in Brother Justin's story were incorporated into the show. Aside from the show's supernatural elements, a historical consultant deemed Carnivàle historic accuracy to be excellent regarding the characters' lives and clothes, their food and accommodations, their cars and all the material culture.|$|E

However, in the epigraph to the finale, he does make reference to the adventure of Prince Ajib.

25|$|Deep democracy, as the {{psychologist}} Arnold Mindell {{points out in}} his book, The Leader as Martial Artist, is a timeless feeling of shared compassion for all living beings.

25|$|Exteroceptive senses are {{senses that}} {{perceive}} the body's own position, motion, and state, known as proprioceptive senses. External senses include the traditional five: sight, hearing, touch, smell and taste, {{as well as}} thermoception (temperature differences) and possibly an additional weak magnetoception (direction). Proprioceptive senses include nociception (pain); equilibrioception (balance); proprioception (<b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> position and movement of the parts of one's own body).|$|E
25|$|Another {{approach}} to understanding <b>the</b> neuroscientific underpinnings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> agency {{is to examine}} clinical conditions in which purposeful limb movement occurs without <b>an</b> associated <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> agency. <b>The</b> most clear clinical demonstration of this situation is alien hand syndrome. In this condition, associated with specific forms <b>of</b> brain damage, <b>the</b> affected individual loses <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> agency without losing <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> ownership <b>of</b> <b>the</b> affected body part.|$|R

25|$|According to some scholars, {{what both}} {{religion}} and spirituality {{have in common}} is <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> supernatural, while others see supernatural thought unnecessary for spirituality. In colonial America, some people had a supernatural curiosity that was often combined with free-thinking rationalism advocated by intellectuals such as Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson. Robert Fuller has characterized the SBNR phenomenon as a mix of intellectual progressivism and mystical hunger, impatient with the piety of established churches.|$|E
25|$|Bradley's {{service to}} the country as {{assistant}} postmaster general is regarded as influential.

The numerous maps Bradley published, while later discarded and redrawn by the new Jackson administration, created in their time <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> immensity of American territory.|$|E
25|$|To {{increase}} {{the feeling of}} claustrophobia in Sunshine, Boyle refused to cut back to scenes on Earth, a traditional technique in most films about the planet in jeopardy. The director also maintained an atmosphere of confinement in Sunshine by avoiding filming the primary ship, Icarus II, from the outside. There {{are only a few}} outside shots of the ship. He also attempted to avoid filming star field backgrounds, keeping the ship's exterior pitch black, but he was ultimately compelled to show stars outside the spacecraft to help convey <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ship's movement.|$|E
