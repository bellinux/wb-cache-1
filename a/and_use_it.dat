5|$|A {{food web}} is the archetypal {{ecological}} network. Plants capture solar energy <b>and</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> to synthesize simple sugars during photosynthesis. As plants grow, they accumulate nutrients and are eaten by grazing herbivores, {{and the energy}} is transferred through a chain of organisms by consumption. The simplified linear feeding pathways that move from a basal trophic species to a top consumer is called the food chain. The larger interlocking pattern of food chains in an ecological community creates a complex food web. Food webs are a type of concept map or a heuristic device {{that is used to}} illustrate and study pathways of energy and material flows.|$|E

5|$|Decommissioned in 1949, {{the fort}} {{was used for}} a time as a {{storehouse}} for a shoe factory before it was purchased by the local council. The surrounding land was developed into a public park but the fort itself fell into dereliction, despite its historical and architectural significance. Since 1985 it has been leased to a voluntary preservation group, the Coalhouse Fort Project, which has been working to restore the fort <b>and</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> for heritage and educational purposes. It can be visited by the public on regular open days and houses reconstructions, small military museums and open-air displays of military equipment. Funding for its restoration has been provided {{in part by the}} Heritage Lottery Fund and the Warner Bros. film studio, which used the fort as a location for the opening scenes of the 2005 film Batman Begins.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{negative}} effects of poison, which were so evident in these times, cures were being found in poison, even at such a time where it was hated by the most of the general public. An example {{can be found in the}} works of Iranian born Persian physician, philosopher, and scholar Rhazes, writer of Secret of Secrets, which was a long list of chemical compounds, minerals and appratus, the first man to distil alcohol <b>and</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> as an anti-septic, and the person who suggested mercury be used as a laxative. He made discoveries relating to a mercury chloride called corrosive sublimate. An ointment derived from this sublimate was used to cure what Rhazes described as 'the itch', which is now referred to as scabies. This proved an effective treatment because of mercury's poisonous nature and ability to penetrate the skin, allowing it to eliminate the disease and the itch.|$|E
5|$|In {{their work}} The Life and Death of Planet Earth, authors Peter D. Ward and Donald Brownlee {{have argued that}} some form of animal life may {{continue}} even after most of the Earth's plant life has disappeared. Ward and Brownlee use fossil evidence from the Burgess Shale in British Columbia, Canada, to determine the climate of the Cambrian Explosion, <b>and</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> to predict the climate of the future when rising global temperatures caused by a warming Sun and declining oxygen levels result in the final extinction of animal life. Initially, they expect that some insects, lizards, birds and small mammals may persist, along with sea life. However, without oxygen replenishment by plant life, they believe that animals would probably die off from asphyxiation within a few million years. Even if sufficient oxygen were to remain in the atmosphere through the persistence of some form of photosynthesis, the steady rise in global temperature would result in a gradual loss of biodiversity.|$|E

Malik convinces Soong to torture Lucas, and failing that, to expose a scientist to a deadly pathogen using a containment chamber.|$|E
5|$|On 3 December 1846, Brunner began {{what became}} his longest and most arduous expedition. He planned {{to follow the}} Buller River to the sea and then trek down the West Coast {{as far south as}} Milford Sound. During his {{previous}} expedition, he had been told of the existence of a route through the Southern Alps by the Māori at the Arahura River. He hoped to discover this route <b>and</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> to cross the Southern Alps and reach Canterbury. He was accompanied once again by Kehu, who brought along his wife. Another Māori, Pitewate, a friend of Kehu's, also joined the venture, accompanied by his wife. Brunner provided clothing and shoes for his companions. The wives proved problematic during the journey as they quarrelled, sometimes supported by their husbands, and Brunner would have to mediate.|$|E
5|$|Organisms vary {{in their}} ability to take up foreign dsRNA <b>and</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> in the RNAi pathway. The effects of RNA {{interference}} can be both systemic and heritable in plants and C. elegans, although not in Drosophila or mammals. In plants, RNAi is thought to propagate by the transfer of siRNAs between cells through plasmodesmata (channels in the cell walls that enable communication and transport). Heritability comes from methylation of promoters targeted by RNAi; the new methylation pattern is copied in each new generation of the cell. A broad general distinction between plants and animals lies in the targeting of endogenously produced miRNAs; in plants, miRNAs are usually perfectly or nearly perfectly complementary to their target genes and induce direct mRNA cleavage by RISC, while animals' miRNAs tend to be more divergent in sequence and induce translational repression. This translational effect may be produced by inhibiting the interactions of translation initiation factors with the messenger RNA's polyadenine tail.|$|E

5|$|Some of the {{earliest}} evidence of salt processing dates to around 8,000 years ago, when {{people living in the}} area of present-day Romania boiled spring water to extract salts; a salt-works in China dates to approximately the same period. Salt was also prized by the ancient Hebrews, the Greeks, the Romans, the Byzantines, the Hittites, Egyptians, and the Indians. Salt became an important article of trade and was transported by boat across the Mediterranean Sea, along specially built salt roads, and across the Sahara on camel caravans. The scarcity and universal need for salt have led nations to go to war over it <b>and</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> to raise tax revenues. Salt is used in religious ceremonies and has other cultural significance.|$|E
5|$|The Parrs {{escape and}} travel to Metroville in a spare rocket. True to its programming, the Omnidroid recognizes Syndrome as an {{opponent}} and attacks the remote on his wrist, making him incapable of controlling it, while simultaneously knocking him unconscious. The Parrs and Frozone team up {{to fight the}} Omnidroid; the battle is indecisive until Bob comes across the remote, allowing him to control one of the robot's arms <b>and</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> to destroy it's power source. Returning home, the Parrs find Syndrome, who plans to kidnap and raise Jack-Jack as his own sidekick to exact revenge on the family. As Syndrome tries to escape to his airplane, Jack-Jack's own superpowers start to manifest, and he eludes Syndrome's grasp. Bob and Helen rescue Jack-Jack, in the process causing Syndrome to be sucked into the jet's turbine by his cape, where he is killed.|$|E
5|$|The game {{takes place}} across {{a variety of}} levels, many of which require certain {{objectives}} to be performed to progress. Sir Daniel Fortesque can use a variety of weapons, consisting of close range weapons such as swords and clubs to long range weapons such as crossbows. Many can be charged for a powerful attack and some, such as the club, can be used to access areas that are otherwise inaccessible. When not possessing any items, Dan is able to rip his arm off <b>and</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> for both melee and ranged attacks. Dan can equip a shield alongside weapons for defence; though they have limited strength before breaking. Throughout the game, Dan can visit gargoyle heads of two varieties: green ones offer Dan information while blue ones allow Dan to buy services or ammunition by using the treasures he finds.|$|E
