25|$|A corset dress (also {{known as}} hobble corset because it {{produces}} similar restrictive effects to a hobble skirt) {{is a long}} corset. It is like an ordinary corset, but it is long {{enough to cover the}} legs, partially or totally. It thus looks like a dress, hence the name. A person wearing a corset dress can have great difficulty in walking up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> (especially if wearing high-heeled footwear) and may be unable to sit down if the boning is too stiff.|$|E
500|$|Linda Laubenstein {{was born}} on May 21, 1947 in Boston, Massachusetts, to Priscilla and George Laubenstein. She grew up in Barrington, Rhode Island. [...] Her mother worked as a special-education {{preschool}} teacher, while her father worked as a purchasing agent for Providence Gas Company. As a child, she had severe asthma and contracted polio {{at the age of}} five. She was placed in an iron lung for three months to prevent respiratory failure and was left paraplegic; she would use a wheelchair {{for the rest of her}} life. Because she was unable to physically attend elementary school, an intercom was set up from her classroom to her home. Her high school did not have an elevator, so when she needed to attend classes on the second floor, members of the school's football team would carry her wheelchair up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs.</b> She chose to attend Barnard College because the campus was accessible for wheelchair users. Aspiring to become a doctor, she took mostly science classes. She went on to study at the New York University School of Medicine, receiving her M.D. in 1973 and completing her internship, residency and fellowship by 1978.|$|E
2500|$|The first video {{interlude}} featured dancers waving {{large white}} cloths {{in front of}} fans during [...] "Messiah", as footage from the [...] "Ghosttown" [...] video played on the screens. The next segment started with [...] "Body Shop", where Madonna sang the song alongside dancers dressed as mechanics {{in front of a}} 1965 Ford Falcon. She then played the ukulele for an acoustic version of [...] "True Blue" [...] before flowing into a disco version of [...] "Deeper and Deeper", which was sung at end of the catwalk. A spiral staircase descended from the ceiling for a mashup of [...] "HeartBreakCity" [...] and [...] "Love Don't Live Here Anymore", where a male dancer followed Madonna up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> before she pushed him off from the top. She closed the section with a remix of [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] performing it energetically around the stage. The second video interlude began with a mashup of [...] "S.E.X." [...] and [...] "Justify My Love", with eight dancers mimicking sex positions on four beds while an edited version of the [...] "Erotica" [...] music video played on the screens.|$|E

60|$|Walter {{even took}} {{the trouble to}} shout up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> for Sigbert, <b>and</b> to demand hotly of the weary, dejected men-at-arms where Sigbert was; {{but no one could}} tell.|$|R
60|$|And {{catching}} up a pail, {{he ran out}} of the room <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs.</b>|$|E
60|$|She drifted out of {{the room}} <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs,</b> the servant-maid falling into her wake.|$|E
60|$|Saunders {{took the}} {{fourteen}} dollars, counted them over, {{and then did}} as requested. Without another word Ferris hurried out <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs.</b>|$|E
6000|$|The {{prisoner}} now {{upon his}} back, [...] The Laird's Jock has gotten up fu' hie; [...] <b>And</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stair,</b> him, irons <b>and</b> a', [...] Wi' nae sma' speid and joy, brings he.|$|R
6000|$|As daily I went up <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> [...] <b>And</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stair,</b> I did {{not mind}} the Bygone there - [...] The Present once to me; Its moving meek {{companionship}} [...] I wished might ever be, There was in that companionship [...] Something of ecstasy.|$|R
60|$|She {{clung to}} his arm through <b>the</b> dim-lighted {{passages}} <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> narrow <b>stairs.</b>|$|R
60|$|She swept {{past him}} <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> into the street. She threw {{herself into the}} corner of the automobile. The chauffeur looked around.|$|E
60|$|With {{a parting}} hug that revived in Mr. Peters {{recollections}} of the Terrible Turk, his wife hurried {{out of the}} room <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "We must," [...] I {{answered}} fiercely, and ran madly {{from the}} room, along the gallery <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs,</b> shouting and raging like a maniac, Cavalcanti following me.|$|E
60|$|Then Otto turned <b>and</b> crept <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs,</b> frightened at <b>the</b> {{height to}} which he had climbed.|$|R
60|$|And so {{saying he}} led the way out of <b>the</b> {{apartment}} <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> kitchen <b>stairs.</b>|$|R
25|$|In October 2017, Cowell {{was taken}} to {{hospital}} after fainting <b>and</b> falling <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> {{at his home in}} London.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are welcome. But say, I don't {{want any}} more skylarking around here," [...] added the {{proprietor}} of the resort, as Dave hurried {{out of the room}} <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs.</b>|$|E
60|$|Presently {{his feet}} were unfastened, and he was led {{out of the room}} <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs.</b> Then the party made its way {{to the rear of the}} house, and went outside.|$|E
60|$|Like a pair {{of ghosts}} they glided up the front stairs, along the broad hallway, <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> in the rear. The door was unlocked, and they passed into the yard.|$|E
6000|$|Up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> [...] Two {{more young}} ones patter [...] (Twins were never seen [...] Dirtier nor fatter).

50|$|<b>And</b> {{threw him}} <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs.</b>|$|R
60|$|There was {{an almost}} {{imperceptible}} shake of the head from the sick woman, making his heart melt swiftly again. Then, dragging his limbs, {{he got out of}} the room <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "All right," [...] Wallace said, and he {{went out}} <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs.</b> Then from the dining-room below his heavy voice {{offering}} encouragement came up, in terms which the others could not make out.|$|E
6000|$|As in his vain {{inquiries}} {{for these}} articles he stood shouting, [...] "Nurse! Buttons! Rosa my dear!" [...] {{and the most}} fearful execrations up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs,</b> Mr. Truncheon came out on him.|$|E
6000|$|There {{are a few}} hard {{chairs for}} yelling Shand from, and then rushing away. There is an iron spiral {{staircase}} that once led to the ladies' hairdressing apartments, but now leads to more Shand, Shand, Shand. A glass door at the back opens on to the shop proper, screaming Civil and Religious Liberty, Shand, as it opens, and beyond is the street crammed with still more Shand pro and con. Men in every sort of garb rush in and out, up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stair,</b> shouting <b>the</b> magic word. Then there is a lull, <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> comes Maggie Wylie, decidedly overdressed in blue velvet and (let us get this over) less good- looking than ever. She raises her hands to heaven, she spins round like a little teetotum. To her from the street, suffering from a determination of the word Shand to the mouth, rush Alick and David. Alick is thinner (being older), David is stouter (being older), and they are both in tweeds and silk hats.] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tom's in trouble," [...] ejaculated {{the eldest}} Rover, <b>and</b> went <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> four steps at a time, with the German youth behind him.|$|R
60|$|She {{fled from}} <b>the</b> room, <b>and</b> rushed <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs.</b> In another moment, she {{had opened the}} door, and {{was out in the}} front garden.|$|R
60|$|Eleanor half-whispered {{that she}} would, and then, without uttering another word, crept {{out of the}} room <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs,</b> opened the front door for herself without hearing or seeing anyone, and found herself in the close.|$|E
60|$|On went her old brown jacket; on went her old brown hat. With a whirl of {{skirts and}} with the {{brilliant}} sparkle still in her eyes, she fluttered out the door <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> to the street.|$|E
60|$|The maid {{turned up}} the gas and then uttered a cry of astonishment. Without waiting to {{question}} the youth she flew {{out of the room}} <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs,</b> to return, a few minutes later, with a burly man.|$|E
6000|$|Ken strode out of <b>the</b> room <b>and</b> started <b>down</b> <b>the</b> hall. [...] "Come on!" [...] he called, grimly, <b>and</b> ran <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs.</b> Graves {{hesitated a}} moment, then followed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, now," [...] said Ned, {{becoming}} suddenly stern. [...] "I don't {{believe in}} your religion, or your Bible, or your prayin' and psalm-singin'. I tell you plainly, I'm a infidel.

60|$|Pelagia {{gazed down}} one moment more, and then, with a shriek which rang along roof and river, she turned, <b>and</b> fled <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>and</b> {{out into the}} night.|$|R
