40|$|Background: Quotations in Brazilian {{journals}} {{are mainly}} obtained from national <b>articles</b> (<b>articles</b> from Brazilian journals); thus, {{it is essential}} to determine how frequently these <b>articles</b> reference Brazilian journals. Objective: This study sought to verify how frequently national papers are cited in the references of three Brazilian physical therapy journals. Method: All references for <b>articles</b> published in Fisioterapia em Movimento, Fisioterapia e Pesquisa and Revista Brasileira de Fisioterapia between 2010 and 2012 were evaluated. In particular, the numbers of national <b>articles</b> and international <b>articles</b> (<b>articles</b> from international journals) cited in these references were determined. Results: A total of 13, 009 references cited by 456 <b>articles</b> were analyzed, and 2, 924 (22. 47 %) of the cited works were national <b>articles.</b> There were no significant differences among the three examined years. A total of 36 (7. 89 %) <b>articles</b> did not cite national <b>articles,</b> whereas 65 (13. 25 %) <b>articles</b> cited more national <b>articles</b> than international <b>articles.</b> Conclusion: On average, 22. 47 % of the works cited by the evaluated <b>articles</b> were national <b>articles.</b> No significant differences were detected among the three analyzed years...|$|R
