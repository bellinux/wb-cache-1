40|$|The marine sponge Axinella corrugata {{is being}} {{developed}} as a model organism for in vitro marine invertebrate research. Molecular genetics methods such as DNA fingerprinting [amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) ] and single-locus DNA sequence analyses were applied to this model to meet the primary objective of identifying positive A. corrugata–specific molecular markers that will aid in verifying cell identity in vitro and distinguish sponge cells from potential microbial contaminants. The extent of intra- and interspecific variation in these markers from geographically distinct samples of A. corrugata and closely related sponge taxa was also assessed. Two novel nuclear loci along with intervening transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of nuclear rRNA were characterized, although the latter appeared to better meet primary marker criteria, such as taxonomic specificity and high frequency of detection (via polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) from different individuals (n 3 ̆e 40) and cell cultures. Phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses of ITS DNA sequences helped clarify taxonomies and also suggested species boundaries between and among western Atlantic and eastern Atlantic/Indian Ocean A. corrugataand Axinellidae samples. Patterns of genetic variation {{have important implications for}} the systematics, evolution, and chemical ecology of A. corrugata and related <b>axinellids</b> and are discussed...|$|E

40|$|Eight new {{and four}} known peptaibols were {{isolated}} from {{a strain of}} the fungus, Trichoderma atroviride (NF 16), which was cultured from an <b>Axinellid</b> sponge collected from the East Mediterranean coast of Israel. The structures of the pure compounds were determined using HRMS, MS/MS and one- and two-dimensional NMR measurements. The isolated compounds belong to the trichorzianines, a family of 19 -residue linear hydrophobic peptides containing {{a high proportion of}} α-aminoisobutyric acid (Aib), an acetylated N-terminus and a C-terminal amino alcohol.

40|$|The influenceof structure-forming deep-water sponge grounds on the composition, diversity, and {{abundance}} {{of the local}} epibenthicmega-faunal community of the Flemish Pass area, Northwest Atlantic was statistically assessed. These habitats are considered vulnerable marine ecosystems and, therefore, warrant conservationmeasures to protect them frombottomfishing activities. The epibenthicmegafaunawere quantified from four photographic transects, three of which were located on the western slope of the Flemish Cap with an overall depth rangeof 444 – 940 m, and the fourth in the southern FlemishPass between 1328 and 1411 m.

On {{the slope of the}} Flemish Cap, sponge groundswere dominated by <b>axinellid</b> and polymastid sponges, while the deeper sponge ground in the southern Flemish Pass was formed mainly by geodiids and Asconema sp. The presence of structure-forming sponges was associated with a higher biodiversity {{and abundance}} of associated megafauna compared with non-sponge habitat. The composition of megafauna significantly differed between sponge grounds and non-sponge grounds and also between different sponge morphologies.

40|$|The new genus Pipestela {{is created}} to include <b>axinellid</b> sponges with lamellate, {{branching}} or tubular growth form bearing mainly oxeas {{arranged in a}} distinctive loose skeleton of vaguely plumose and wavy spiculo-fibres. The genus is known only from northeastern Australia, from the Great Barrier Reef, Coral Sea, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu, with a single specimen known so far from Western Australia. Type species Pipestela candelabra sp. nov. is the most widely distributed of the five known species, and in some places forms highly abundant local populations. Pipestela rara sp. nov., P. occidentalis sp. nov., P. hooperi (Van Soest et al.) n. comb. and P. terpenensis (Fromont) n. comb. are also assigned to this new genus. All species are associated with coral reefs, in relatively clear water, between 10 - 50 m depth. The genus shows affinity to Cymbastela in the predominance of oxeas, and to Auletta by the common organ-pipe morphology, but is distinct from the former by the loose skeleton and from the latter by its lack of styles and wavy diactinal spicules. The phylogenetic relationships of Pipestela, {{its position in the}} higher classification, and the limits of its spatial distribution are further investigated. The definition of Cymbastela is revised as a consequence of erecting this new genus...|$|R
40|$|Este artículo contiene 12 páginas, 10 figuras, 2 tablas. Sponge assemblages on {{continental}} {{shelves and}} slopes {{around the world}} have been known about for centuries. However, due to limitations of the traditional sampling systems, data about individual sponge species rather than assemblages have been reported. This study characterizes sponge assemblages over a wide bathymetric range (50 – 350 m depth) and covering the entire continental shelf and the upper slope of the Menorca Channel, an area soon to be declared a Marine Protected Area (MPA) as part of the Natura 2000 Network. Quantitative analysis of 85 video-transects (a total linear distance of 75 km), together with representative collections to confirm species identifications, allowed us to discriminate six major assemblages. Differences in the assemblages mainly corresponded to differences in substrate type and depth. On the inner continental shelf, a semi-sciaphilous <b>Axinellid</b> assemblage dominated the rocky outcrops. Maërl beds on the inner continental shelf were dominated by Haliclona (Reniera) mediterranea, whereas the horny sponge Aplysina cavernicola and several other haliclonids mostly dominated maërl beds and rocky substrates of the outer shelf. Soft sediments on the shelf break hosted a monospecific Thenea muricata assemblage, whereas rocky substrates of the shelf break were characterized by a mixture of encrusting, columnar and fan-shaped sponges. Finally, the upper slope was dominated by Hamacantha (Vomerula) falcula and the hexactinellid Tretodictyum reiswigi. Overall, sponge diversity showed its highest values above the shelf break, plummeting severely on the upper slope. Despite this diversity decrease, we found very high densities (> 70 ind. /m 2) of sponges over vast areas of both the shelf break and the upper slope. This work was funded by the European project LIFE+ INDEMARES ‘‘Inventario y designación de la red Natura 2000 en áreas marinas del estado español” (LIFE 07 /NAT/E/ 000732) and the EU-ENPI CBC-Med project ECOSAFIMED ENPI-ECOSAFIMED - II-B/ 2. 1 / 1073 (“Towards Ecosystem Conservation and Sustainable Artisanal Fisheries in the Mediterranean basin”) (2014 - 15).

40|$|Biogenetically {{unrelated}} cyclic guanidine alkaloids and pyrroloquinoline alkaloids {{have been}} reported from sponges assigned to the genus Batzella. These sponges have been assigned to this genus because of their possession of a simple complement of thin strongyles in irregular plumoreticulate arrangement. Cyclic guanidine alkaloids were first reported from an alleged <b>axinellid</b> species from the Caribbean, Ptilocaulis aff. P. spiculifer, and subsequently from a second Carribean specimen identified as Ptilocaulis spiculifer {{and at the same}} time from a Red Sea poecilosclerid, Hemimycale sp. Closely related compounds were described from a Caribbean specimen identified as Batzella sp. and also from the poecilosclerids Crambe crambe (Mediterranean) and Monanchora arbuscula (Brazil). Isobatzellins (pyrroloquinoline alkaloids) were reported from a black deep-water species from the Bahamas identified as Batzella sp. Chemically related pyrroloquinoline alkaloids were found in Pacific representatives of the fistular poecilosclerid genus Zyzzya, the hadromerid genus Latrunculia and the ?haplosclerid genus Prianos. Most of the voucher specimens involved in this puzzle were re-examined and several conclusions can be drawn: when inspected closely it appears, that the cyclic guanidine alkaloids are produced by sponges containing anisostrongyles, often in two categories, a thicker and a thinner one. Monanchora arbuscula, which has been recently discovered to produce these compounds, has monactinal spicules differentiated into a thinner subtylostyle and a thicker (tylo-) style, but many specimens have anisostrongylote modifications. Microscleres in Monanchora can be absent or very rare. By association, all the sponges from which cyclic guanidine alkaloids are known may be united in one family, possibly in a single wider defined genus Monanchora. However, further relationships with Crambe need to be studied. Both have cyclic guanidine alkaloids, both have megascleres of very variable shapes and thickness, differentiated mostly into two overlapping categories, microscleres and other additional spicules are often rare or absent. Relationships with the type of Hemimycale, viz. H. columella remain obscure, but in view of the much larger spicules of that species and the intricate ectosomal specialization (lacking in the above mentioned specimens) it is possible that similarities between the Red Sea Hemimycale and the European species are the product of parallel evolution. The strongyles of sponges producing pyrroloquinoline alkaloids are perfect isostrongyles and in the ectosome these are arranged in a definite ectosomal tangential crust. A good proportion of these strongyles have a faint spination on the apices. Assignment of these sponges to Batzella rest on the properties of its type species Batzella inops. Examination of a type spicule slide of that species did not solve that question, but until further notice Batzella may be used for the deep-water material. A further unsolved problem that remains is the phylogenetic relationships of Batzella with Zyzzya and Latrunculia. The likelyhoods of possible causes for this distribution of compounds are discussed...|$|R
