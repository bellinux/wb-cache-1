40|$|Research {{literature}} widely {{discusses the}} opportunities of process mining to support audit processes. By using process mining tools that can automate {{one or more}} steps of the auditing process, auditors can put more focus on the analytic side of auditing, instead of data gathering and taking samples. However, an approach for conducting process audits with support of process mining tools is still lacking. This report presents the application of process mining {{as a component of}} business process auditing, executed {{within the context of a}} Dutch municipality. Required elements of the <b>auditing</b> <b>approach</b> are defined using the literature research conducted prior to this report. An <b>auditing</b> <b>approach</b> that integrates these elements is developed. In the empirical part of our research, the <b>auditing</b> <b>approach</b> is applied to two process auditing cases. The results of the case studies are used to evaluate the hypotheses that process mining can be a part of process auditing methods and estimate the required activities of the preparation of the process log data and the audit statements for process mining tools. The case studies show that the development of a normative process, collecting the set of audit criteria and analyzing of the completeness of the log data were limiting factors for automation of the audit. Other results concern with the identification the audit criteria that can and cannot be formalized because of incompleteness of the log data (82 % vs 70 % of all limitations) or because of imprecise formulation. It was found that (20 % vs 52 %) of audit criteria can be translated into filters used by process mining tools, allowing for identification of non-compliant cases. Relating the audit criteria to filters and using process mining tools for auditing makes the audit fast, repeatable and based on all process cases instead of samples...|$|R

However, due to the very nature of spreadsheets, their evolution is particularly tricky and therefore error-prone. In our strive to develop tools and methodologies to improve spreadsheet quality, we analysed consolidation spreadsheets of an internationally operating company for the errors they contain. The paper presents the results of the field audit, involving 78 spreadsheets with 60, 446 non-empty cells. As a by-product, the study performed was also to validate our analysis tools in an industrial context. The evaluated auditing tool offers the auditor a new view on the formula structure of the spreadsheet by grouping similar formulas into equivalence classes.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effects of}} a joint audit on auditor’s report consensus and accuracy. We investigate whether a joint audit, particularly the report issued, improves an audit’s quality. We measure the audit’s quality using the degree of auditor consensus in the auditor’s report. We also use an expected opinion, which we believe is appropriate in the defined circumstances, as a scale for the measurement of the report’s accuracy. Participants in the study were statutory auditors from Austria and Germany. At present, manners of improving audit quality and auditing decisions are being intensively discussed in the European Union and everywhere in the world. The joint <b>audit</b> <b>approach</b> is a very current topic in this discussion. Regulators and standard setters are extensively examining the benefits of various audit approaches. Nevertheless, in most countries, the joint <b>audit</b> <b>approach</b> is still utilised on a voluntary basis and is not very common. Our study provides evidence that auditors who use a joint <b>audit</b> <b>approach</b> achieve higher consensus and greater accuracy. In light of current discussion on improving the quality of audits by implementing new methods and regulations, these results are significant for both auditing practice and audit research. Despite this importance, there are very few studies and little research on improving quality {{through the use of a}} joint <b>audit</b> <b>approach.</b> Our results demonstrate the need for further investigation of the determinants of audit performance when using a joint <b>audit</b> <b>approach.</b> Using a case study research design and an interview, we draw conclusions and discuss necessary future research...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines how}} {{differences between the}} strategic-systems <b>audit</b> <b>approach</b> and the traditional, transaction-based <b>audit</b> <b>approach</b> affect the content and complexity of client business knowledge in long-term memory, how these mental representations develop with experience, and how the representations affect risk assessment. Knowledge of the client?s business is essential to conducting an effective and efficient audit, but researchers have devoted little attention to how this knowledge is represented in memory and what effect it has on audit judgment. Moreover, proponents of the strategic-systems approach argue that this approach leads {{to the formation of}} a more-complex client business model and results in better audit judgments than the transaction-based approach. The study?s results contradict these claims, with the strategic-systems auditors having less-complex models than their TBA counterparts. Also, no experience-related differences were found in the client models, and risk assessments were only weakly affected by content and complexity differences between client models. After a variety of supplemental analyses, it was concluded that there is no evidence from this dissertation to suggest that the SSA methodology does not result in an auditor possessing an enhanced knowledge of the client?s business compared to that possessed by an auditor employing a traditional <b>audit</b> <b>approach...</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackgroundWith the 11 th {{revision}} of the International Classification of Disease (ICD) being officially launched by the World Health Organization (WHO), the significance of a formal representation for ICD coding rules {{has emerged as a}} pragmatic concern. ObjectivesTo explore the role of Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) on examining ICD 10 coding rules and to develop FCA-based <b>auditing</b> <b>approaches</b> for the formalization process. MethodsWe propose a model for formalizing ICD coding rules underlying the ICD Index using FCA. The coding rules are generated from FCA models and represented in the Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL). Two <b>auditing</b> <b>approaches</b> were developed focusing upon non-disjoint nodes and anonymous nodes manifest in the FCA model. The candidate domains (i. e. any three character code with their sub-codes) of all 22 chapters of the ICD 10 2006 version were analyzed using the two <b>auditing</b> <b>approaches.</b> Case studies and a preliminary evaluation were performed for validation. ResultsA total of 2044 formal contexts from the candidate domains of 22 ICD chapters were generated and audited. We identified 692 ICD codes having non-disjoint nodes in all chapters; chapters 19 and 21 contained the highest proportion of candidate domains with non-disjoint nodes (61. 9 % and 45. 6 %). We also identified 6996 anonymous nodes from 1382 candidate domains. Chapters 7, 11, 13, and 17, have the highest proportion of candidate domains having anonymous nodes (97. 5 %, 95. 4 %, 93. 6 % and 93. 0 %) while chapters 15 and 17 have the highest proportion of anonymous nodes among all chapters (45. 5 % and 44. 0 %). Case studies and a limited evaluation demonstrate that non-disjoint nodes and anonymous nodes arising from FCA are effective mechanisms for auditing ICD 10. ConclusionFCA-based models demonstrate a practical solution for formalizing ICD coding rules. FCA techniques could not only audit ICD domain knowledge completeness for a specific domain, but also provide a high level auditing profile for all ICD chapters...|$|R

40|$|A hybrid {{analysis}} {{is a combination}} of: a macro-economic input-output analysis (IOA) which covers the entire „background‟ economy; and a process analysis that covers the detail of specific items usually gained through conducting an audit. The Global Reporting Initiative‟s Sustainability Reporting Guidelines, for example, contain a range of specific (micro) indicators that provide good reporting scope or breadth for conducting an audit. In order to make an audit manageable a boundary is set. This boundary usually limits the audit to immediate on-site impacts that are deemed to be within {{the control of the}} reporting entity. Using the <b>audit</b> <b>approach</b> alone can lead to inconsistencies between assessments because boundaries can vary from year to year or project to project. This issue can be addressed by using a macro-economic IOA. The IOA complements the <b>audit</b> <b>approach</b> because it includes the full upstream supply chain, thus providing reporting depth to complement the breadth of the audit, and consistency of reporting because there is no cut-off point or imposed boundary. We can summarise the different approaches to TBL assessment and reporting using the notion of assessment breadth and depth. The combination of <b>audit</b> <b>approach</b> and IOA is known as hybrid analysis. Bounded analysis with many micro indicator...|$|E

Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study is to assess the <b>audit</b> <b>approach</b> in the light of audit quality and the assurances that the financial statement provide. In spite of the number of changes that have taken place in the audit profession during the past twenty years which have changed the way external auditors operate and manage their activities in proving the statutory attest function on the financial statements, there is paucity of research focused on the way auditors’ carry out their attest function in the midst of dwindling investors’ confidence in Nigeria. Using a survey design, the questions that were raised in the study were answered using descriptive and inferential statistics. F-statistics was used in providing answers to the propositions raised in the study.
