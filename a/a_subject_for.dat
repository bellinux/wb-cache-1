5|$|A {{somewhat}} controversial recent {{addition to}} Caversham was the opening, in October 2013, of Whakamana Cannabis Museum, New Zealand's first museum {{dedicated to the}} history of cannabis use. Cannabis, while still a criminalised drug in New Zealand, has moved some way towards grudging acceptance, at least as <b>a</b> <b>subject</b> <b>for</b> open discussion. The museum, run from a former residential house in David Street, is designed to be an information centre on aspects of the history and legislation surrounding the drug, and also a national centre for the Aotearoa Legalise Cannabis Party, a minor single-issue political party.|$|E
5|$|I have {{a rather}} more {{favourable}} {{opinion of the}} 'Vestiges' than you appear to have. I do not consider it a hasty generalization, but rather as an ingenious hypothesis strongly supported by some striking facts and analogies, but which remains to be proven by more facts and the additional light which more research may throw upon the problem. It furnishes <b>a</b> <b>subject</b> <b>for</b> every student of nature to attend to; every fact he observes will make either for or against it, and it thus serves both as an incitement to the collection of facts, and an object to which they can be applied when collected.|$|E
40|$|This study aims to {{describe}} the temporality aspect of verbs in the Western Dani Language (WDL) in Papua. The data were from Morfologi Bahasa Dani Barat, a research report by Purba, et al. (1994). The temporality was proved by the distributional method supplemented by permutation and deletion techniques. The findings show that WDL has nine verb forms. Those are ones with: 1) <b>a</b> singular <b>subject</b> <b>for</b> the present tense, 2) <b>a</b> singular <b>subject</b> <b>for</b> the recent past tense, 3) <b>a</b> singular <b>subject</b> <b>for</b> the remote past tense, 4) <b>a</b> singular <b>subject</b> <b>for</b> the future tense, 5) <b>a</b> plural <b>subject</b> <b>for</b> the present tense, 6) <b>a</b> plural <b>subject</b> <b>for</b> the recent past tense, 7) <b>a</b> plural <b>subject</b> <b>for</b> the remote past tense, 8) <b>a</b> plural <b>subject</b> <b>for</b> the future tense, and 9) the habitual present tense. Temporality verb forms are classified into two groups: eight verbs based on the time an event occurs and one verb of a habitual event. The nine verbs showing time are distinguished {{on the basis of}} singular and plural subjects...|$|R

5|$|Alongside his collaborations with Dada artists {{on various}} pieces, Tzara himself was <b>a</b> <b>subject</b> <b>for</b> visual artists. Max Ernst depicts {{him as the}} only mobile {{character}} in the Dadaists' group portrait Au Rendez-vous des Amis ("A Friends' Reunion", 1922), while, in one of Man Ray's photographs, he is shown kneeling to kiss the hand of an androgynous Nancy Cunard. Years before their split, Francis Picabia used Tzara's calligraphed name in Moléculaire ("Molecular"), a composition printed {{on the cover of}} 391. The same artist also completed his schematic portrait, which showed a series of circles connected by two perpendicular arrows. In 1949, Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti made Tzara the subject of one of his first experiments with lithography. Portraits of Tzara were also made by Greta Knutson, Robert Delaunay, and the Cubist painters M. H. Maxy and Lajos Tihanyi. As an homage to Tzara the performer, art rocker David Bowie adopted his accessories and mannerisms during a number of public appearances. In 1996, he was depicted on a series of Romanian stamps, and, the same year, a concrete and steel monument dedicated to the writer was erected in Moinești.|$|E
5|$|The play {{originated}} as Enright's A Property of the Clan, a theatre-in-education piece {{written for}} Freewheels Theatre in Education in Newcastle which premiered in 1992. Enright {{was approached by}} the director of Freewheels, Brian Joyce, who suggested the murder of Leigh Leigh as <b>a</b> <b>subject</b> <b>for</b> a play. Enright initially refused, but Joyce argued that the actual subject of the play would be the victim's peer-groups. Enright agreed, after being convinced a play could be made out of the conflicting responses to the crime. The title was taken from a quote in the psychological report that was made on Mathew Webster, the man who murdered Leigh, in preparation for his trial. The first decision regarding the play was to omit the criminal acts and the actual murder from it, instead focusing on the drama, its participants and {{the aftermath of the}} murder.|$|E

25|$|For Verdi, {{the years}} 1851 to 1853 {{were filled with}} operatic activity. First, he had agreed with the {{librettist}} Salvadore Cammarano on <b>a</b> <b>subject</b> <b>for</b> what would become Il trovatore, but work on this opera could not proceed while the composer was writing Rigoletto, which premiered in Venice in March 1851. In addition, personal affairs in his home town limited his activities that spring, but after Rigolettos success in Venice, an additional commission was offered by Brenna, the secretary of La Fenice. After Verdi's return from Paris a contract was signed in May 1852, with performances scheduled for March 1853, although no subject was chosen at that time.|$|E
