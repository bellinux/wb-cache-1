40|$|This paper {{presents}} a rare anatomical {{variation in the}} form of accessory fallopian tube on right side. The duplication of fallopian tube was observed in a 34 -year-old female during routine undergraduate dissection in our department. Fallopian tube is the part of uterus that carries the ovum from the ovary to the uterus. Accessory fallopian tube is the congenital anomaly attached to the ampullary part of main tube. This <b>accessory</b> <b>tube</b> is common site of pyosalpinx, hydrosalpinx, cystic swelling and torsion. The ovum released by the ovary may also be captured by the blind <b>accessory</b> <b>tube</b> leading to infertility or ectopic pregnancy. Hence, all patients of infertility or pelvic inflammatory disease should be screened to rule out the presence of accessory fallopian tube and if encountered should be removed...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The {{advent of}} bracket bonding {{simplified}} {{the assembly of}} orthodontic braces, besides giving more comfort to the patient and decreasing the risk of decalcification. However, there is no first molar bracket with <b>accessory</b> <b>tube</b> and hooks in the market, except for the convertible type. Objective:To present a patent for utility model of a bracket Roth prescription, Straight-Wire technique for first molar, {{in order to facilitate}} orthodontic treatment where {{there is a need for}} placing accessories in second molars. Material and methods:This patent consists of a molar bracket for bonding, which contains a retentive base for this, similar to the bracket used in the Edgewise technique,with fins for placing alastic or metal ligature,but containing pre-angles and torques as the tubes of the molar Straight-Wire technique with Roth prescription. It also includes an <b>accessory</b> <b>tube</b> for placing arches or cantilevers and hooks for placing elastics. Results and conclusion:With this bracket design proposal it is possible to obtain an accessory that facilitates the inclusion of the second molar in the assembly of the orthodontic brace without the use of bands. Moreover, this bracket has fins for placing ligatures,accessory tube for placing arches or cantilevers and hooks for placing elastics...|$|E

40|$|IN a {{previous}} communication * we described {{a method for}} the continuous recording of gastric pH in man. At that time we were {{of the opinion that}} colloidal aluminum hydroxide t in 30 c. c. dosage made up to 200 c. c. with water, or 200 c. c. of milk alone, fulfilled the physiological criteria of an ideal antacid. It was also noted that the use of calcium carbonate or of mag-nesium salts caused. a great initial rise in pH but that their buffering effect was of short duration. In the present study we have extended our observations on antacids with the use of an improved method for the continuous recording of gastric pH. In the procedure as originally described a tube at least 5 / 16 ths of an inch in diameter containing a glass electrode and <b>accessory</b> <b>tubes</b> was introduced into the stomach.

30|$|Tubal factor {{infertility}} {{accounts for}} nearly {{one quarter of}} all cases of infertility [8]. The fallopian tubes may be abnormal in structure or function. Structural disorders can block the fallopian tubes. They include tubal scarring or blockage most commonly from pelvic infections, prior abdominal surgeries, and endometriosis. Practically, many gynecologists are reluctant when reporting on diagnostic laparoscopy. Some perform a single-puncture intraumbilical procedure that neglects an auxiliary portal for proper grasping of the adnexa and thorough evaluation of the ovarian fossa. Most of them comment on tubal patency only and neglect tubal morphology, size, length, and proximity to the pouch of Douglas. Rarely, they comment on the mesosalpinx and Wolffian duct remnants. This study directs attention towards more concentration on some factors that would affect tubal motility and commonly missed by gynecologists. Previously, some authors reported on hydatid of Morgagni {{as a cause of}} unexplained infertility (UI) [9]. Likewise, an old study diagnosed fimbrial agglutinations (25  %), <b>accessory</b> <b>tubes</b> (13  %), <b>accessory</b> ostia (10  %), phimoses (13  %), and sacculations (7  %) more in the infertile women [10]. Tubal abnormalities would affect the prognosis of natural pregnancy as well as laparoscopic gamete intrafallopian transfer [11]. At our institution, we consider tubal sacculations, diverticulae, convolutions, phimosis, or fimbrial agglutination as laparoscopic criteria of subtle tubal endometriosis specially if seen with other typical or atypical endometriotic tubal or peritoneal lesions. Proper endoscopic training would eliminate all these mistakes that would affect diagnosis as well as therapy.|$|R

40|$|The {{conclusions}} {{at which}} we arrive are the following: 1. Nodular enlargement of the tube {{can be caused by}} a number of different pathological conditions. 2. Clinical examination does not enable us to make a diagnosis of the pathological condition existing in an individual case of nodule of the tube. 3. The diagnosis of the nature of a tubal nodule can be made only with the microscope. 4. The conditions causing nodular enlargement of the tube are congenital or acquired, non-inflammatory or inflammatory. 5. Any one of these conditions can exist without the production of nodules. 6. The nodules can be found {{in all parts of the}} tube and—taking the peculiar anatomy of each part of the tube into account—show the same structure. 7. The enlargement can be caused by epithelial or epithelioid formations, connective or muscular tissue, by round-cell infiltrations or combinations of two or more of these. 8. The epithelial formations originate in the epithelium of a. the tubal mucous membrane (salpingitis pseudo-follicularis, adenomyoma originating in the tubal epithelium). b. the <b>accessory</b> <b>tubes</b> (intraparietal parasalpinx and hydro-parasalpinx). c. remnants of the Wolffian body (adenomyoma). 9. The epithelioid formations originate in the peritoneal endothelium (peritoneal growths under "relative heterotopy"). 10. The excess of formation of connective tissue is a consequence of inflammatory conditions of the tubal wall (salpingitis interstitialis, Zweifel). 11. The hypertrophy of the muscular tissue is a. non-inflammatory (adenomyoma). b. consequent upon inflammation—Kaltenbach's case (23). 12. The accumulations of round cells are direct evidence of inflammation: a. non-specific (salpingitis interstitialis disseminata, salpingitis abscedens); or b. specific (salpingitis tuberculosa or s. gonorrhoica). 13. The epithelioid formations can occur wherever pseudo-membranes cover organs lined with a serous coat. 14. Extra-uterine pregnancy (abdominal or tubal) produces epithelioid formations by causing pseudo-membranes to form—not by any irritation peculiar to the pregnancy...|$|R

40|$|The {{engine bay}} of an {{automotive}} vehicle is a partly open enclosure that is densely filled with numerous {{objects such as}} <b>accessory</b> parts, pipes, <b>tubes,</b> and cables. These objects cause scattering of the sound waves inside the engine bay, which leads to an increased absorption of sound power compared to an enclosure without objects. However, it is time-consuming to include {{all the details of}} the geometry and acoustical properties of the objects in numerical simulations, predicting the sound power radiated to the exterior. This paper presents how a deterministic boundary element model and a statistical intensity/power model can be combined to give an approximate description of the sound field for cases with randomly distributed scatterers. The boundary element formulation describes the coherent part of the wave field by using modified Green's functions that include the average effect of the scattering objects. The waves scattered at the objects are assumed to result in an incoherent field that is described by an intensity model. The modelling approach is evaluated by calculating the power radiated from a partly open enclosure in a two-dimensional geometry. The results are convincing and it is concluded that the approach is suitable...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivePatients with {{pancreatic}} disease are often malnourished because of biliary and gastric outlet obstruction or the catabolic response to sepsis or cancer. In this study, we reviewed {{our experience of}} providing enteral nutrition through a T-tube jejunostomy in these patients. MethodsThe records of a consecutive series of 36 patients who had undergone pancreatic operations during the last 4 years were reviewed. Data were collected on preoperative nutritional status and postoperative feeding. ResultsAll patients had partially hydrolysed feeds administered through a T-tube jejunostomy, placed during pylorus-preserving proximal pancreatoduodenectomy (21 patients), Whipple's procedure (4), debridement of pancreatic necrosis (3), palliative bypass (2), distal pancreatectomy (2), cyst-jejunostomy (3) or <b>accessory</b> sphincteroplasty (1). <b>Tube</b> feeding was employed for a mean of 18 days. There were no related deaths. Eight patients had complications directly attributable to the tube, including blockage (4), dislodgement (2), pericatheter leakage (2) and peritonitis (1). Twenty patients had complications related to feeds that included transient diarrhoea (13), abdominal distension (8), nausea or vomiting (6) and pain (6). Consequently, nitrogen and energy needs were completely fulfilled in only 19 patients.

40|$|Structural {{changes in}} the female genital system of IIaemaphysalislongicornis during feeding, {{copulation}} and oviposition were observed in the light microscope. The genital system consists of the vestibular and cervical vagina, tubular <b>accessory</b> glands, connecting <b>tube,</b> receptaculum seminis, oviduct and ovary. As in Hyalomma, epithelial cells lining the vestibular cuticle become the lobular accessory glands during feeding, secretions from which coat the surface of passing eggs and may function as a waterproofing agent. However, {{it is clear from}} these observations that dramatic feeding-related changes occur also in the other organs constituting the system. The cervical vagina and connecting tube both have a similar structure, their developed muscles being involved in transfer of male germ cells and/or eggs. Secretions from the feeding-stimulated tubular accessory glands may be a coating agent applied to the egg surface or act as a lubricant for egg passage. Epithelial cells of the receptaculum seminis are probably involved in destruction of the inserted endospermat,ophore. In the fed females, just, after copulation the oviducal epithelium produces a secretion, which also may exert some influence upon the passing spermatozoa and eggs. Muscles surrounding the oviduct,s cause peristalt,ic contract. ions during the passage of spermatozoa and eggs. In the developed ovary, the oocyte prot,rudes into the haemocoel, and is attached to special funicle cells which arise from ovarian epithelium. Numerous spermatozoa present in the ovarian lumen during oviposition imply that fertilization occurs in the ovary...|$|R
40|$|We {{read with}} {{interest}} the article by Jovanovic et al. on the initial validation of a new mechanical endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) training model [1]. Five trainees and five endoscopists, with and without ERCP experience, {{were involved in the}} evaluation of the model. The conclusion was that the model is a useful tool for ERCP training, particularly in improving the position of the scope, handling the wheels and the elevator, targeting the papilla, selectively cannulating the biliary and pancreatic ducts, extracting stones, and placing plastic and metal stents. ERCP is a complex procedure. Teaching the procedure is demanding, as it is difficult to explain the complexity of movements needed to maintain a correct and stable position in front of the papilla. In ERCP it is always a matter of keeping the right axis; if the axis is wrong, the chance of deep cannulation decreases dramatically. The basic issue is therefore how to teach movements to achieve a proper axis. A simple mechanical model to guide fellows on how to reach the correct position in front of the papilla, before they receive training on patients, was therefore imagined. The idea of this ERCP training model (the Boškoski-Costamagna ERCP Trainer; Cook Medical, Limerick, Ireland) arose at the end of 2010. The very first prototype was designed and then built using wires, parts from used <b>accessories,</b> plastic <b>tubes,</b> and sutures ([Fig.   1]). This prototype already had bile and pancreatic ducts, and could be assembled to present different grades of ERCP difficulty. A working team was then created, endorsed by the European Endoscopy Training Center in Rome, with the goal of implementing and further developing the prototype. ERCP training modules were organized, and feedback was collected in order to improve the model. Zoom ImageZoom Image Fig.   1  The Boškoski-Costamagna ERCP Trainer. a The original model (invented by Dr. Ivo Boškoski). b The original model with a duodenoscope. The ERCP simulator was immediately regarded as a useful tool by the trainees. Fellows learned how to move in front of the papilla in order to attain a proper axis and to achieve deep cannulation. Fellows became familiar with movements that are usually difficult to teach and to learn, without losing time in orientation in front of the papilla and without any risk. On the basis of these positive comments, the prototype was then further developed, produced, and distributed. The current version of the ERCP Trainer ([Fig.   2]) is light enough to be transported easily, may simulate different patient positions (prone, oblique, supine), and comes with several easily exchangeable modules featuring variations of the papillary anatomy and biliopancreatic junction. Zoom ImageZoom Image Fig.   2  The second-generation Boškoski-Costamagna ERCP Trainer, which is currently available. It was, indeed, with surprise that we read about this initial validation and the good results reported in the article by Jovanovic et al. These authors used the first generation of the Boškoski-Costamagna ERCP Trainer. The second generation of the ERCP Trainer is currently available, and a third, which will have more advanced features including fluoroscopy, is in development. Although our personal experience and that of Jovanovic et al. are encouraging, further trials are needed. For this purpose, a large multicenter study has been designed in order to identify the role of the training model and to prove the relevance of the ERCP Trainer in training programs...|$|R
5000|$|Pal's {{adaptation}} {{has many}} other notable differences from H. G. Wells' novel. The closest resemblance is probably {{that of the}} antagonists. The film's aliens are indeed Martians, and invade Earth {{for the same reasons}} as those stated in the novel (the state of Mars suggests that it is {{in the final stages of}} being able to support life, leading to the Martians decision to make Earth their new home). They land in the same way, by crashing to the Earth. However, the novel's spacecraft are large cylinder-shaped projectiles fired from the Martian surface from some kind of cannon, instead of the film's meteorite-spaceships; but the Martians emerge from their craft in the same way, by unscrewing a large, round hatch. They appear to have no use for humans in the film. In the novel, however, the invaders are observed [...] "feeding" [...] on humans by fatally transfusing their captives' blood supply directly into Martian bodies by using pipettes; there is also a later speculation about the Martians eventually using trained human slaves to hunt down all remaining survivors after they have conquered Earth. In the film the Martians do not bring their fast-growing red weed with them, but they are defeated by Earth microorganisms, as observed in the novel. However, they die from the effects of the microorganisms within three days of the landing of the first meteorite-ship; in the novel the Martians die within about three weeks of their invasion of England. The Martians themselves bear no physical resemblance to the novel's Martians, who are described as bear-sized, roundish creatures with brown bodies, [...] "merely heads", with quivering beak-like, V-shaped mouths dripping saliva; they have sixteen whip-like tentacles in two groupings of eight arranged on each side of their mouths and two large [...] "luminous, disk-like eyes". Due to budget constraints, their film counterparts are short, reddish-brown creatures with two long, thin arms with three long, thin fingers with suction cup tips. The Martian's [...] "head", if it can be called that, is a broad [...] "face" [...] at the top-front of its broad shouldered upper torso, the only apparent feature of which is a single large eye with three distinctly colored lenses (red, blue, and green). The Martians' lower extremities, whatever they may be, are never shown. (Some speculative designs for the creature suggest the idea of three thin legs resembling their fingers, while others show them as bipeds with short, stubby legs with three-toed feet.) [...] The film's Martian war machines do actually have more of a resemblance than they may seem at first glance. The novel's machines are 10-story tall tripods and carry the heat-ray projector on an articulated arm connected to the front of the war machine's main body. The film's machines are shaped like manta rays, with a bulbous, elongated green window at the front, through which the Martians observe their surroundings. On top of the machine is the cobra head-like heat-ray attached to a long, narrow, goose-neck extension. They can be mistaken for flying machines, but Forrester states that they are lifted by [...] "invisible legs"; in one scene, when the first machine emerges, you can see faint traces of three energy legs beneath and three sparking traces where the three energy shafts touch the burning ground. Therefore, technically speaking, the film's war machines are indeed tripods, though they are never given that designation. Whereas the novel's war machines had no protection against British army and navy cannon fire, the film's war machines have a force field surrounding them; this invisible shield is described by Forrester as a [...] "protective blister". The Martian weaponry is also partially unchanged. The heat-ray has the very same effect as that of the novel. However, the novel's heat-ray mechanism is briefly described as just a rounded hump when first seen in silhouette rising above the landing crater's rim; it fires an invisible energy beam in a wide arc while still in the pit made by the first Martian cylinder after it crash-lands. The film's heat-ray projector when first seen is shaped like a cobra's head and has a single, red pulsing [...] "eye", which likely acts like a targeting telescope for the Martians inside their manta ray-like war machine. The novel describes another weapon, the [...] "black smoke" [...] used to kill all life; the war machines fire canisters containing a black smoke-powder through a bazooka-like <b>tube</b> <b>accessory.</b> When dispersed, this black powder is lethal to all life forms who breathe it. This weapon is replaced in the film by a Martian [...] "skeleton beam", green pulsing bursts fired from the wingtips of the manta-ray machines; these bursts break apart the sub-atomic bonds that hold matter together on anything they touch. These skeleton beams are used off screen to obliterate several French cities. The plot of the film is very different from the novel, which tells the story of a 19th-century writer (with additional narration in later chapters by his medical student younger brother), who journeys through Victorian London and its southwestern suburbs while the Martians attack, eventually being reunited with his wife; the film's protagonist is a California scientist who falls in love with a former college student after the Martian invasion begins. However, certain points of the film's plot are similar to the novel, from the crash-landing of the Martian meteorite-ships to their eventual defeat by Earth's microorganisms. Forrester also experiences similar events like the book's narrator: an ordeal in a destroyed house, observing an actual Martian up close, and eventually reuniting with his love interest at the end of the story. The film is given more of a Cold War theme with its use of the Atomic Bomb against the enemy and the mass-destruction that such a global war would inflict on mankind.|$|R
