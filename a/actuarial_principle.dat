40|$|In this paper, {{we explore}} actuarial {{justification}} for equal or unequal sharing of premiums and benefits between policyholders in a product involving joint lives. The analysis reveals {{a fundamental difference}} between endowment and assurance types of products in this regard. In assurance plans, {{there is a clear}} basis for differential structure in terms of sharing premium payment. In pure endowment plans, the default system of equal premium for equal benefit may be more justified although implications of other alternatives are also considered. A justification is derived for such an alternative through appropriate discount figures as compared to individual live policies. We also suggest an alternative <b>actuarial</b> <b>principle</b> to deal with joint endowment plans: solutions have been worked out under this framework. While lives are considered to be independent for a major part of this work, the implications of dependency have also been presented here with special reference to common shock model and copula models. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} stabilizing {{mechanisms in}} social security retirement systems (“SSRS”), especially those purporting to be automatic balancing mechanisms (“ABM”). It develops a consistent approach to identifying whether an ABM is robust, partial or transitory and establishes a terminology to classify balancing mechanisms. Both financial and equitable balances are considered in assessing whether an ABM achieves balance. Families of definitions of equity are presented and a benchmark by which to measure equitable balance is defined and applied. The balancing mechanisms of Canada, Germany, Japan and Sweden are described, evaluated and classified. None of these mechanisms {{are found to be}} robust. This thesis provides a critical analysis of an approach referred to as integration to financial markets and the approach is found to be deficient. In analyzing the Swedish SSRS a critical error in the way assets are calculated is identified and a suitable correction is proposed. A further weakness in the application of the Swedish ABM is identified that means that once an imbalance occurs, balance is unlikely to be restored. The thesis also discusses some of the unusual characteristics of the steady-state contribution rate calculation for the Canadian SSRS and shows that although it has limited application and does not appear to depend on any <b>actuarial</b> <b>principle,</b> the steady-state contribution rate calculation creates a tension between the near and distant future, which is a factor in achieving financial balance over a seventy-five year horizon. With respect to the balancing mechanism in the Canadian SSRS, the thesis proposes a change in how the mechanism is defined so that the mechanism would be robust, within certain ranges...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} a preface and three chapters each examining how pension <b>actuarial</b> <b>principles</b> distort the financial management of U. S. defined benefit pension plans. Pension actuarial methods were originally developed to assess the relationship between plan assets and liabilities and to manage the flow of cash contributions made by sponsors. Subsequent extensions of <b>actuarial</b> <b>principles</b> to pension accounting and law influenced all aspects of corporate pension plan financial management while ignoring and contradicting contemporaneous developments in finance. This has distorted the accounting, tax and investing environment for U. S. pensions. ^ The first chapter, Assumed Rates of Discount for Valuations of Publicly Sponsored Defined Benefit Plans, illustrates how the use of expected returns on plan assets, unadjusted for risk, misrepresents intergenerational costs in the public sector. Second, The Shareholder-Optimal Design of Cash Balance Pension Plans applies the corporate finance lessons of Black (1980) and Tepper (1981) to “cash balance” pension plans, concluding that these plans can best serve shareholders by investing in fixed income assets while offering equity-based returns to plan participants. Third, Biased Methodology Enables Defined Benefit Pension Plan Equity Investments shows that actuarial distortion can overrule the lessons of financial economics. ^ <b>Actuarial</b> <b>principles</b> erroneously presume that defined benefit plans may anticipate the rewards of risky investing and smooth away the risks incurred without causing bias. Modern finance may correct this and inform future actuarial theory in three ways: (i) market risk cannot be diversified without limit; (ii) Independent risks compounded over time increase absolutely even though the risk per unit of time decreases; (iii) pricing by arbitrage is intellectually compelling when its necessary conditions are met and systems that offer arbitrage opportunities are inherently fragile. ^ Actuaries trained in modern finance are equipped to participate in correcting the biases embedded in present <b>actuarial</b> <b>principles.</b> Recent <b>actuarial</b> writings have moved to integrate <b>actuarial</b> and financial <b>principles.</b> This dissertation is designed to abet that integration in the pension sector. ...|$|R

40|$|On July 1, 1996, {{the federal}} {{government}} introduced Bill-C 12, the new Employment Insurance (EI) legislation claiming that one purpose is to extend coverage {{to those who were}} excluded from UI. This includes the labour force in non-standard forms of employment (those in part-time, temporary, seasonal and ' just-in-time' employment also referred to as the precariously employed). This project concludes that contrary to the proclamation, the new EI legislation is designed to exclude from benefits the very labour force the government contended to extend coverage to. The EI guidelines defeat the very purpose of extension of coverage to this workforce by imposing strict eligibility criteria and increased entry requirements. It increases the qualifying period by 233 % from what it was under UI and it introduces a penalty for repeat-use of the program. The new fixed averaging formula used to determine the level of benefits as well as weeks of benefits and the new-re-entrant requirement of 910 hours end up either excluding many of the precariously employed from benefits or reducing their benefit levels and benefit weeks.

Arguing from a Structural Marxist point of view, this study concludes that the main purpose of the reform is to weaken the safety net for the jobless and thereby increase the vulnerability of the working class in general to the hazards of the market place at a time when unemployment is high. The relative accessibility of the old program, with its income replacement of 55 % of insured earnings and the duration of benefits, was believed to loosen the cash/work nexus by way of de-commodifying labour power. The reform, therefore, is designed to rid the program of these perceived or actual effects and to strengthen the <b>actuarial</b> <b>principle.</b> As a result, the new EI program curtails benefits and entitlements for workers it forces the working class back into the wage-capital labour relations as soon as possible.

Before accessing information, a VO member must purchase a liability policy from the insurance arm of the VO. Insured access uses <b>actuarial</b> <b>principles</b> to set up and run the VO’s insurance arm, and provides the follow-ing benefits: VO members who share their information are compensated if the information is misused, and can expect a positive benefit from sharing; members who use informa-tion well are rewarded and those who misuse it are penalized appropriately; and the level of risk-taking in the system is capped at a certain level.

40|$|When {{assessing}} future {{pecuniary loss}} in personal injury litigation, courts often use the multiplicand/multiplier approach. The {{objective is to}} calculate a lump sum amount to compensate the plaintiff for a stream of future lost earnings and/or a stream of future expenses. Conventionally, the Hong Kong Courts followed the English authorities in choosing multipliers. Most judges select the multipliers by reference to a spread of multipliers in comparable English and Hong Kong cases. This conventional approach was first challenged in the Hong Kong Court of First Instance in 1995 (Chan Pui Ki (An Infant) v Leung On [1995] 3 HKC 732). The trial judge abandoned the conventional method of choosing multipliers and admitted actuarial evidence to calculate the appropriate multiplier. However, this decision was subsequently reversed by the Hong Kong Court of Appeal in 1996 which held that the conventional multipliers for the calculation of loss of future earnings should be maintained. The Court of Appeal also discouraged any further use of expert evidence given by economists and actuaries in Hong Kong personal injury litigation. On the contrary, the House of Lords in England made a landmark decision (Wells v Wells [1999] AC 345). It approved actuarial evidence as the primary method of assessing future pecuniary loss. In this respect, the socio-legal implications of the English House of Lords decision in Hong Kong will be analysed.

Sections 2 and 3 deal with legal or statutory rules of “solvency”, and thus with the situation called “insolvency” or, more often, “ruin”, by the actuary profession. Sections 4, 5 and 6 address the same three questions:– Assuming the insurer has perfectly priced the risks he insures, his future result is a random variable; what can be said about it?– How was this pricing established (by the insurer, or by a pool of insurers, or by authorities) ?

In this research, we investigate {{the relationship between the}} pension risk disclosure quantity in the corporate annual reports and the proportion of independent directors, the market-to-book ratio, the funding ratio, the banking industry dummy variable and the pension scheme size. We find that the coefficients for independent directors are insignificant and thus this study puts forth that independent directors do fulfill their functions in facilitating the pension risk disclosure level. Concerning the market-to-book ratio, there is a mix of results but market-to-book ratio can be partly confirmed in promoting risk disclosure degree. The finding that the funding ratio does not contribute significantly to the risk {{reporting is}} contradictory to O’Brien et al’s recent study on pension disclosure. Separate investigation on banks partially reveals that banks tend to disclose more than firms in the other industries. However, the pension scheme size is found to be significant in more pension risk reporting. This supports O’Brien et al’s prior conclusion on the pension scheme size for its importance in risk disclosure. KEYWORDS: pension, risk disclosure, FTSE 10...|$|R
40|$|We are {{motivated}} by the latest statistical facts that weather directly affects about 20 % of the U. S. economy and, as a result energy companies experience enormous potential losses due to weather that is colder or warmer than expected for {{a certain period of}} a year. Incompleteness and illiquidity of markets renders hedging the exposure using energy as the underlying asset impossible. We attempt to price and hedge a written European call option with an asset that is highly correlated with the underlying asset; still, a significant amount of the total risk cannot be diversified. Yet, our analysis begins by considering hedging in a complete markets system that can be utilised as a theoretical point of reference, relative to which we can assess incompleteness. The Black-Scholes Model is introduced and the Monte Carlo approach is used to investigate the effects of three hedging strategies adopted; Delta hedging, Static hedging and a Stop-Loss strategy. Next, an incomplete system of markets is assumed and the Minimal Variance approach is demonstrated. This approach results in a non-linear PDE for the option price. We use the <b>actuarial</b> standard deviation <b>principle</b> to modify the PDE to account for the unhedgeable risk. Based on the derived PDE, two additional hedging schemes are examined: the Delta hedging and the Stop-loss hedging. We set up a risk-free bond to keep track of any money injected or removed from the portfolios and provide comparisons between the hedging schemes, based on the Profit/Loss distributions and their main statistical features, obtained at expiry...|$|R
40|$|The actuarial and the {{financial}} approach to the pricing of risk remain different despite the increasingly direct interconnection of financial and insurance markets. The difference can be summarized as pricing based on classical risk theory (insurance) vs. non-arbitrage pricing (finance). However, comparable pricing principles are of importance {{when it comes to}} transferring insurance risk to financial markets and vice versa as it is done e. g. by alternative risk-transfer instruments or derivative products. Incompatibilities blur business opportunities or may open up the possibility to arbitrage. For these situations, the paper aims {{to bridge the gap between}} insurance and finance by extending the non-arbitrage pricing principle to insurance. The main obstacle that has to be tackled is related to the incompleteness of the insurance market. It implies that equivalent martingale probabilities are not uniquely defined. By the information theoretical maximum entropy principle a sensible way to choose a particular equivalent martingale measure is found. This approach parallels the successful application of the maximum entropy principle in finance. The paper pays special attention to the role that investment opportunities beyond risk-free investments play for insurance operations. Equivalent martingale probabilities for the combination of insurance operation riskfree investment and a risky investment are determined. They turn out to be connected to the Esscher measure. This recovers a generalized form of a well-known <b>actuarial</b> premium calculation <b>principle.</b> The sketched approach is further investigated for typical reinsurance structures like stop-loss and excess-of-loss reinsurance. Arbitrage-free reinsurance premiums are calculated. A numerical example stresses the influence that characteristics of risky investment opportunities have on arbitrage-free premiums...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the course}} of the past several decades the {{benefits}} of redeveloping brownfields have been widely recognized. Actions have been taken to foster sustainable redevelopment of brownfields by government, policy makers and stakeholders across the world. However, redevelopments encounter great challenges and risks related to environmental and non-environmental issues. In this work, we intend to build a comprehensive and practical framework to evaluate the hydrogeological and financial risks involved during redevelopment and to ensure developers reserve sufficient capital to cover unexpected future costs within the guarantee period. Punitive damages, which contribute to these costs, are in this thesis solely associated with the cost of repossessing a house within a development should the indoor air concentration of TCE exceed the regulatory limit at a later time. The uncertainties associated with brownfield remediation have been among the barriers to brownfield redevelopment. This is mainly caused by the lack of knowledge about a site’s environmental condition. In order to alleviate uncertainties and to better understand the contaminant transport process in the subsurface, numerical simulations have been conducted to investigate the role of controlling parameters in determining the fate and transport of volatile organic compounds originating from a NAPL source zone located below the water table in the subsurface. In the first part of this thesis, the numerical model CompFlow Bio is used on a hypothesized three-dimensional problem geometry where multiple residential dwellings are built. The simulations indicate that uncertainty in the simulated indoor air concentration is sensitive to heterogeneity in the permeability structure of a stratigraphically continuous aquifer with uncertainty defined as the probability of exceeding a regulatory limit. Houses which are laterally offset from the groundwater plume are less affected by vapour intrusion due to limited transverse horizontal flux of TCE within the groundwater plume in agreement with the ASTM (2008) guidance. Within this uncertainty framework, we show that the Johnson and Ettinger (1991) model generates overly-conservative results and contributes to the exclusion zone being much further away from the groundwater plume relative to either CompFlow Bio or ASTM (2008). The probability of failure (or the probability of exceedence of the regulatory limit) is defined and calculated for further study. Due to uncertainties resulting from parameter estimation and model prediction, a methodology is introduced to incorporate field measurements into the initial estimates from the numerical model in order to improve prediction accuracy. The principle idea of this methodology is to combine the geostatistical tool kriging with the statistical data assimilation method Kalman filter to evaluate the worth and effectiveness of data in a quantitative way in order to select an optimal sampling scenario. This methodology is also used to infer whether one of the houses located adjacent to affected houses has indoor air problems based on the measurements subject to the observation that the affected house is monitored and has problems and developers have liability if a problem occurs. In this part of the study, different sampling scenarios are set up in terms of permeability (1 – 80 boreholes) and soil gas concentration (2, 4 and 7 samples) and three metrics are defined and computed as a criterion for comparison. Financing brownfield redevelopment is often viewed as a major barrier to the development process mainly due to risks and liabilities associated with brownfields. The common way of managing the risk is to transfer it to insurers by purchasing insurance coverage. This work provides two different strategies to price the risk, which is equivalent to an insurance premium. It is intended to give an instructive insight into project planning and feasibility studies during the decision-making process of a brownfield project. The two strategies of risk capital valuation are an <b>actuarial</b> premium calculation <b>principle</b> and a martingale premium calculation principle accounting for the hydrogeological and financial uncertainties faced in a project. The data used for valuation are the posterior estimates of data assimilation obtained from the results of different sampling scenarios. The cost-benefit-risk analysis is employed as a basis to construct the objective function in order to find the least cost among sampling scenarios for the project. As a result, it shows that drilling seven boreholes to extract permeability data and taking soil gas samplings in four locations or seven locations alternatively give the minimum total cost. Sensitivity analysis of some influential parameters (the safety loading factors and the possible methods to calculate the probability of failure) is performed to determine their roles of importance in the risk capital valuation. This framework can be applied to provide guidance for other risk-based environmental projects...|$|R
