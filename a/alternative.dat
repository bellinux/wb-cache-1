5|$|<b>Alternative</b> rock is {{a diverse}} {{grouping}} of rock bands that in America developed {{largely from the}} hardcore scene in the 1980s in stark opposition to the mainstream music scene. <b>Alternative</b> rock subgenres that developed during the decade include indie rock, Gothic rock, noise rock, grunge, and college rock. Most <b>alternative</b> bands were unified by their collective debt to punk, which {{laid the groundwork for}} underground and <b>alternative</b> music in the 1970s. Though the genre is considered to be rock, some styles were influenced by American folk, reggae and jazz. Like punk and hardcore, <b>alternative</b> rock had little mainstream success in America in the 1980s, but via the grassroots establishment of an indie scene through touring, college radio, fanzines, and word-of-mouth, <b>alternative</b> bands laid the groundwork for the breakthrough of the genre in the American public consciousness in the next decade.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} has demonstrated that rejecting product <b>alternatives</b> (i. e., choosing which <b>alternatives</b> to give up) may cause preference reversals compared to choosing <b>alternatives.</b> We provide an investigation into the psychological processes underlying this phenomenon. These preference reversals can be caused by increased elaboration on the features of preference-inconsistent <b>alternatives</b> when people reject <b>alternatives.</b> When these features are appealing, increased elaboration increases preference for preference-inconsistent <b>alternatives.</b> When these features are unappealing, increased elaboration may reduce preference for preference-inconsistent <b>alternatives.</b> The findings provide insight into how the amount of elaboration on product <b>alternatives</b> may mediate the influence of different decision-making tasks on decision outcomes. ...|$|R

5|$|<b>Alternative</b> Songs is {{a record}} chart that ranks the most-played songs on American modern rock radio stations. Published by the music {{industry}} magazine Billboard, it {{was created in the}} midst of the growing popularity of <b>alternative</b> music on rock radio in the late 1980s. As less-established <b>alternative</b> acts were receiving minimal exposure on album-oriented rock (AOR) radio stations, their labels turned to modern rock stations for airplay. Billboard introduced the chart in response to demand within the music industry for consistent information on the commercial performance of <b>alternative</b> music. During the decade, it was known as the Modern Rock Tracks chart and tabulated based on weighted reports from twenty-nine radio stations: eighteen established standard-bearer commercial stations and eleven non-commercial college stations.|$|E
5|$|<b>Alternative</b> rock {{is a broad}} {{umbrella}} term {{consisting of}} music that differs greatly {{in terms of its}} sound, its social context, and its regional roots. By the end of the 1980s magazines and zines, college radio airplay, and word of mouth had increased the prominence and highlighted the diversity of <b>alternative</b> rock, helping to define a number of distinct styles (and music scenes) such as noise pop, indie rock, grunge, and <b>alternative</b> hip hop. Most of these subgenres had achieved minor mainstream notice and a few bands representing them, such as Hüsker Dü and R.E.M., had even signed to major labels. But most <b>alternative</b> bands' commercial success was limited in comparison to other genres of rock and pop music at the time, and most acts remained signed to independent labels and received relatively little attention from mainstream radio, television, or newspapers. With the breakthrough of Nirvana and the popularity of the grunge and Britpop movements in the 1990s, <b>alternative</b> rock entered the musical mainstream and many <b>alternative</b> bands became successful.|$|E

Nevertheless, post-grunge remained commercially viable into the start of the 21st century, with the commercial success of Creed and Matchbox Twenty; Radiohead's critical acclaim, and the success of some post-Britpop groups like Coldplay. Emo attracted attention in the larger <b>alternative</b> rock world, and the term was applied to a variety of artists, including multi-platinum acts.

40|$|In {{organic farming}} {{there is an}} ongoing {{discussion}} on piglet castration without anaesthesia and possible <b>alternatives</b> to this practice due to animal welfare concerns. Consumer acceptance of <b>alternatives</b> to piglet castration without anaesthesia {{plays an important role}} in this discussion. This contribution examines organic consumers’ attitudes towards piglet castration without anaesthesia and the <b>alternatives</b> castration with anaesthesia and analgesia, immunocastration and fattening of entire males. Additionally, consumers’ willingness-to-pay for the <b>alternatives</b> is determined. The results show that animal welfare, food safety and health concerns influence consumers’ attitudes towards the <b>alternatives.</b> However, the individual perception of those aspects is quite varying. Thus, consumers’ opinions towards the <b>alternatives</b> are also different. Consumers’ perception of the <b>alternatives</b> is reflected in their willingness-to-pay. When implementing <b>alternatives</b> to piglet castration without anaesthesia the organic farming sector should address consumers’ concerns in an appropriate way in order to avoid misinformation and insecurity among consumers...|$|R
