5|$|Hoover Dam is a {{concrete}} <b>arch-gravity</b> <b>dam</b> in the Black Canyon of the Colorado River, {{on the border}} between the U.S. states of Nevada and Arizona. It was constructed between 1931 and 1936 during the Great Depression and was dedicated on September 30, 1935, by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Originally known as Boulder Dam from 1933, it was officially renamed Hoover Dam by a joint resolution of Congress in 1947. Its construction {{was the result of a}} massive effort involving thousands of workers, and cost over one hundred lives. The dam was named after President Herbert Hoover.|$|E
25|$|A {{gravity dam}} can be {{combined}} with an arch dam into an <b>arch-gravity</b> <b>dam</b> for areas with massive amounts of water flow but less material available for a purely gravity dam. The inward compression of the dam by the water reduces the lateral (horizontal) force acting on the dam. Thus, the gravitation force required by the dam is lessened, i.e. the dam {{does not need to}} be so massive. This enables thinner dams and saves resources.|$|E
25|$|The largest <b>arch-gravity</b> <b>dam</b> was the Kasserine Dam in Tunisia, {{arguably the}} biggest Roman dam in North Africa with 150m length by 10m height by 7.3m width. However, despite its curved nature, it is {{uncertain}} whether the 2ndcenturyAD dam structurally acted by arching action and not solely by its sheer weight; {{in this case it}} would be classified as a gravity dam and considerably smaller structures in Turkey or the Spanish Puy Foradado Dam would move up in this category (see sortable List of Roman dams).|$|E

25|$|Based on {{structure}} and material used, dams {{are classified as}} easily created without materials, <b>arch-gravity</b> <b>dams,</b> embankment dams or masonry dams, with several subtypes.|$|R
50|$|<b>Arch-gravity</b> <b>dams</b> are massive dams of {{concrete}} that resist {{the thrust of}} water by their weight using {{the force of gravity}} and the arch action.|$|R
25|$|The Gileppe Dam (French Barrage de la Gileppe) is an <b>arch-gravity</b> <b>dam</b> on the Gileppe {{river in}} Jalhay, Liège province, Wallonia, Belgium. It {{was built in}} the 1870s to supply water for the wool {{industry}} in nearby Verviers. The monumental structure with its unusually thick profile {{played an important role in}} establishing an international standard for masonry gravity dams as a technology for major water supply systems. It was considered one of the strongest dams in Europe at the time, and it was the first dam built in modern Belgium. In the first decade of the 21st century, it was noted as supplying most of the drinking water for Verviers, as well as industrial water, and as producing hydroelectricity.|$|E
25|$|The Hoover Dam is {{a massive}} {{concrete}} <b>arch-gravity</b> <b>dam,</b> constructed in the Black Canyon of the Colorado River, {{on the border between}} the US states of Arizona and Nevada between 1931 and 1936 during the Great Depression. In 1928, Congress authorized the project to build a dam that would control floods, provide irrigation water and produce hydroelectric power. The winning bid to build the dam was submitted by a consortium called Six Companies, Inc. Such a large concrete structure had never been built before, and some of the techniques were unproven. The torrid summer weather and the lack of facilities near the site also presented difficulties. Nevertheless, Six Companies turned over the dam to the federal government on 1 March 1936, more than two years ahead of schedule.|$|E
500|$|O'Shaughnessy Dam is a [...] high {{concrete}} <b>arch-gravity</b> <b>dam</b> in Tuolumne County, California, in the United States. It impounds the Tuolumne River, {{forming the}} Hetch Hetchy Reservoir {{at the lower}} end of Hetch Hetchy Valley in Yosemite National Park, about [...] east of San Francisco. The dam and reservoir are the source for the Hetch Hetchy Aqueduct, which provides water for over two million people in San Francisco and other municipalities of the west Bay Area. The dam is named for engineer Michael O'Shaughnessy, who oversaw its construction.|$|E
2500|$|Roman {{builders}} {{were the}} first to realize the stabilizing effect of arches and buttresses, which they integrated into their dam designs. Previously unknown dam types introduced by the Romans include <b>arch-gravity</b> <b>dams,</b> arch dams,; [...] buttress dams, and multiple-arch buttress dams.|$|R
25|$|Roman {{engineers}} made routine use {{of ancient}} standard designs like embankment dams and masonry gravity dams. Apart from that, they displayed {{a high degree}} of inventiveness, introducing most of the other basic dam designs which had been unknown until then. These include <b>arch-gravity</b> <b>dams,</b> arch dams, buttress dams and multiple arch buttress dams, all of which were known and employed by the 2nd century AD (see List of Roman dams). Roman workforces also were the first to build dam bridges, such as the Bridge of Valerian in Iran.|$|R
50|$|Below Pit 5 Powerhouse lie two larger {{concrete}} <b>arch-gravity</b> <b>dams,</b> Pit 6 and Pit 7. These dams release water {{directly from}} the base to generate power, rather than diverting the water through long tunnels. The combined reservoirs flood almost 10 mi of the Pit River. Flows for these two dams are supplemented by a diversion from the McCloud River, {{a tributary of the}} Pit River. Water is diverted from the McCloud River at Lake McCloud about 20 mi south of Mount Shasta, through a tunnel to Iron Canyon Reservoir, and then through another tunnel to the James B. Black Powerhouse, which outlets into the Pit River on the upper end of Pit 6 Reservoir. These facilities are collectively known as the McCloud-Pit Hydroelectric Project and are also operated by PG&E.|$|R
500|$|Even before Congress {{approved}} the Boulder Canyon Project, the Bureau of Reclamation was considering {{what kind of}} dam should be used. Officials eventually decided on a massive concrete <b>arch-gravity</b> <b>dam,</b> the design of which was overseen by the Bureau's chief design engineer John L. Savage. The monolithic dam would be thick {{at the bottom and}} thin near the top, and would present a convex face towards the water above the dam. The curving arch of the dam would transmit the water's force into the abutments, in this case the rock walls of the canyon. The wedge-shaped dam would be [...] thick at the bottom, narrowing to [...] at the top, leaving room for a highway connecting Nevada and Arizona.|$|E
500|$|Although {{most of the}} {{watershed}} is generally closed to the public, the protected area includes forest roads, buildings, three dams and reservoirs, two hydroelectric power stations, and other infrastructure used by government employees who manage the forest and the water supply system. The system includes a concrete dam and spillway, added to the natural outlet of Bull Run Lake. The dam, completed in about 1960, was preceded in 1915 by a timber-and-rockfill structure and later by other measures to increase the lake's storage capacity and to prevent seepage. These measures raised the lake's usable storage from about [...] to about , an increase of about 55percent.

40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted to present a {{methodology}} for validating finite element (FE) models of existing concrete dams. It is performed by comparison between monitoring data and the structural response from the numerical analyses. Some general procedures developed by this research group at Politecnico di Milano on significant case studies and traditional static monitoring systems are herein considered with reference to real case studies: a buttress gravity and <b>arch-gravity</b> <b>dams.</b> Numerical analyses are performed to assess the structural response under the effects of seasonal loading conditions, represented by hydrostatic pressure on the upstreamdownstream dam surfaces and thermal variations in the continuum acquired by the monitoring system. Furthermore, the stiffness effect of the rock foundation and the surface degradation of concrete are crucial aspects to be accounted for an accurate validation of the models and a correct interpretation of the real behavior.

40|$|This thesis {{will examine}} the {{construction}} of the St. Francis Dam, which collapsed within two years of its completion in the late 1920 s, and its effect on the subsequent successful completion of the Hoover Dam from a Project Management perspective. Both <b>dams</b> were <b>arch-gravity</b> <b>dams</b> built in similar southwestern climates; this paper will attempt to illustrate why the St. Francis Dam collapsed while the Hoover Dam still stands today {{as one of the greatest}} civil engineering projects of the 20 th Century. The prevailing theory, based on findings shortly after the St. Francis Dam collapsed, was that the Dam’s failure was totally due to the composition of the canyon walls. This thesis will establish a basis for the theory that in addition to unsuitable abutment walls, the failure of the Dam was also due to Project Management related errors. This thesis will show that the content of the concrete and the method in which it was poured caused it to crack, leak, and ultimately collapse when the side walls disintegrated allowing all the water in the reservoir to be released at once...|$|R
50|$|In World War II, the Sorpe Dam {{was among}} the targets of the British airstrikes of Operation Chastise in the night from the 16th to the 17th of May, 1943, as were the dams on the Eder and Möhne. In these attacks, the Royal Air Force {{attempted}} to destroy the dams using bouncing bombs, achieving at least one direct hit on the Sorpe Dam. According to the BBC 'Dambusters Declassified' the bomb used on Sorpe was not to spin as it was dropped on the dam {{rather than on the}} water and had no need to bounce. However, while the older <b>arch-gravity</b> <b>dams</b> of Eder and Möhne were successfully breached, causing a catastrophic flooding of the Ruhr valley, the Sorpe's embankment dam with its concrete core covered in soil withstood the attacks with only minor damage. The planners of the Operation had estimated that it would take 5 of the bouncing bombs placed correctly to weaken the dam sufficiently for water pressure to complete the break. The attacks also had to be made parallel to the line of the dam rather than perpendicular. A second British airstrike on October 15, 1944 with five-ton Tallboy bombs also failed, leaving behind only several huge craters and causing minor spillage.|$|R

50|$|An <b>arch-gravity</b> <b>dam</b> or arched dam is a dam {{with the}} {{characteristics}} of both an arch dam and a gravity dam. It is a dam that curves upstream in a narrowing curve that directs most of the water against the canyon rock walls, providing the force to compress the dam. It combines the strengths of two common dam forms and is considered a compromise between the two. They are made of conventional concrete, Roller Compacted Concrete (RCC), or masonry. Arch-gravity dams are not reinforced except at the spillway. A typical example of the conventional concrete dam is the Hoover Dam. Changuinola Dam {{is an example of}} the RCC <b>arch-gravity</b> <b>dam.</b> A gravity dam requires a large volume of internal fill. An <b>arch-gravity</b> <b>dam</b> can be thinner than the pure gravity dam and requires less internal fill.|$|E
