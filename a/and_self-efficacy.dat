25|$|A study made by Takaki {{and colleagues}} (2006), {{focused on the}} gender {{differences}} with relationship to {{internal locus of control}} <b>and</b> <b>self-efficacy</b> in hemodialysis patients and their compliance. This study showed that females that had high internal locus of control were less compliant in regards to their health and medical advices compared to the men that participated in this study. Compliance is known to be the degree in which a person's behavior, in this case the patient, has a relationship with the medical advice. For example, a person that is compliant will correctly follow his/her doctor's advice.|$|E
40|$|Research has {{documented}} that summer sports camps can {{provide opportunities for}} social and physical benefits for at-risk boys who are often from low-income families and vulnerable to academic failure. However, whether these boys can reap such benefits is largely determined by their self-efficacy, including social <b>self-efficacy</b> <b>and</b> physical activity <b>self-efficacy.</b> Thus, {{the purpose of this}} study was to examine at-risk boys? social <b>self-efficacy</b> <b>and</b> physical activity <b>self-efficacy</b> in a summer sports camp setting. Specifically, this study addressed the following research questions: (1) Can at-risk boys differentiate between social <b>self-efficacy</b> <b>and</b> physical activity <b>self-efficacy?</b> (2) What level of social <b>self-efficacy</b> <b>and</b> physical activity <b>self-efficacy</b> do at-risk boys in this sample display? (3) What is the relationship between social <b>self-efficacy</b> <b>and</b> physical activity <b>self-efficacy?</b> (4) Do at-risk boys? mean scores of social <b>self-efficacy</b> <b>and</b> physical activity <b>self-efficacy</b> change over the course of the summer sports camp? (5) What are the predictive powers of social <b>self-efficacy</b> <b>and</b> physical activity <b>self-efficacy</b> on behaviors, effort, and intention for future physical activity participation, and (6) What factors do at-risk boys perceive contributing to their social <b>self-efficacy</b> <b>and</b> physical activity <b>self-efficacy?</b> The results of this study indicated that social <b>self-efficacy</b> <b>and</b> physical activity <b>self-efficacy</b> were clearly distinguishable, but they were also positively related. Both of them significantly predicted prosocial behaviors, with social self-efficacy having stronger predictive power. Physical activity self-efficacy was a better predictor of effort and intention than social self-efficacy. Boys with higher levels of social self-efficacy or physical activity self-efficacy were more likely to display prosocial behaviors. Besides the sources proposed by Bandura?s self-efficacy theory, such as mastery experience, vicarious experience, social persuasion, and emotional and physiological reactions, boys also identified some unique sources contributing to their social <b>self-efficacy</b> <b>and</b> physical activity <b>self-efficacy.</b> This study provides an initial effort using self-efficacy theory to understand at-risk boys? behaviors, effort, and intention for future physical activity participation in a summer sports camp setting. Given the finding that social <b>self-efficacy</b> <b>and</b> physical activity <b>self-efficacy</b> were related to their behaviors, effort, and intention, it is critical to enhance at-risk boys? social <b>self-efficacy</b> <b>and</b> physical activity <b>self-efficacy</b> in summer sports camps...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Self-efficacy beliefs {{determine}} how people feel, think, motivate themselves and behave. Regarding to similar findings {{it is supposed}} that concept of self efficacy has a general role on mental health. The present study focused on examining the relationships between <b>self-efficacy</b> <b>and</b> symptoms of depression, anxiety, worry and social avoidance in a large sample of normal students (n= 549). Methods: The sample included of 266 female and 283 male high school students from schools of distinct areas 6, 8 and 9 (Tehran, Iran). The schools were chosen randomly. Participants completed the Self-Efficacy Questionnaire for Children and Social Avoidance & Distress Scale and also the scales measuring trait anxiety, depression, worry and social avoidance. Stepwise regression analyses were used as methods of analysis. Results: Main results distinguished {{that there is a}} significant and negative relationship between total <b>self-efficacy,</b> physical <b>self-efficacy</b> <b>and</b> academic <b>self-efficacy</b> <b>and</b> depression. Also significant and negative relationships were found between total <b>self-efficacy,</b> physical <b>self-efficacy</b> <b>and</b> emotional <b>self-efficacy</b> <b>and</b> anxiety.

25|$|Studies {{have shown}} both {{feedback}} from the employer <b>and</b> <b>self-efficacy</b> (belief in one's capabilities to achieve a goal) within the employee must be present for goal-setting to be effective. However, because of the tunnel vision focus created by goal-setting theory, several studies have shown this motivational theory may not be applicable in all situations. In fact, in tasks that require creative on-the-spot improvising, goal-setting can even be counterproductive. Furthermore, because clear goal specificity is essential to a properly designed goal-setting task, multiple goals can create confusion for the employee and {{the end result is}} a muted overall drive. Despite its flaws, Goal-setting Theory is arguably the most dominant theory in the field of I–O psychology; over one thousand articles and reviews published in just over thirty years.|$|E
25|$|Men's {{body image}} is a topic of {{increasing}} interest in both academic articles and in the popular press. Current research indicates many men wish to become more muscular than they currently perceive themselves to be, often desiring up to 26 pounds of additional muscle mass. According to the study, western men desire muscle mass over that of Asian men {{by as much as}} 30 pounds. The desire for additional muscle has been linked to many men's concepts about masculinity. A variety of research has indicated a relationship between men's endorsement of traditionally masculine ideas and characteristics, and their desire for additional muscle. Some research has suggested this relationship between muscle and masculinity may begin early in life, as boys' action figures are often depicted as super-muscular, often beyond the actual limits of human physiology. The connection between masculinity and muscle is however a cultural trend traced {{as far back as the}} Classical antiquity and linked to the war performance and its peaceful substitutes, the athletic events. In addition, men with lower, more feminine, Waist–hip ratio (WHR) feel less comfortable and self-report lower body esteem <b>and</b> <b>self-efficacy</b> than men with higher, more masculine, WHRs.|$|E

50|$|Principle 5: Phase-specific self-efficacy. Perceived self-efficacy is {{required}} {{throughout the entire}} process. However, the nature of self-efficacy differs from phase to phase.

40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVE: Perceiving {{oneself as}} younger than one's actual age {{functions}} as a self-enhancing positive illusion that promotes life satisfaction. However, no research has yet focused on the mechanisms through which a youthful subjective age {{could be related to}} higher life satisfaction. The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify the mediating role of resources, such as subjective health <b>and</b> memory <b>self-efficacy,</b> in the relation between subjective age and life satisfaction among older adults. METHOD: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 250 older individuals aged from 60 to 77 years who completed measures of subjective age, subjective health, memory <b>self-efficacy,</b> <b>and</b> life satisfaction. RESULTS: Path analysis revealed that subjective age was positively related to both subjective health <b>and</b> memory <b>self-efficacy,</b> <b>and</b> that subjective health <b>and</b> memory <b>self-efficacy</b> were both positively related to life satisfaction. Bootstrap procedures further indicated that subjective age has significant total and specific indirect contribution to life satisfaction through subjective health <b>and</b> memory <b>self-efficacy.</b> DISCUSSION: This study fills a gap in existing literature and suggests that a youthful subjective age is associated with higher life satisfaction because it is related to higher evaluation of health <b>and</b> memory <b>self-efficacy.</b> It provides an initial support for a resource-based explanation of the relation between subjective age and life satisfaction...|$|R
40|$|In sales, working {{together}} as a team for achieving individual performance is a relevant element. In this paper, we suggest a theoretical framework that analyzes the impact of team potency on subjective performance, according to two mechanisms: <b>self-efficacy</b> <b>and</b> adaptability. The hypotheses suggest that (a) team potency has a positive relationship with <b>self-efficacy</b> <b>and</b> adaptability; <b>self-efficacy</b> <b>and</b> adaptability impact performance (b) directly and (c) indirectly, through a mediating role; and (d) interpersonal climate quality moderates these associations. We did a national survey with 290 salespeople organized in 101 teams from a water purification company.
