5|$|Los Angeles {{photographer}} Sam Jones contacted Wilco in 2000 about {{producing a}} documentary {{film about the}} creation of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. Jones shot over 80 hours of footage for I <b>Am</b> <b>Trying</b> to Break Your Heart (named after the opening song of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot) beginning {{on the day that}} Coomer was dismissed from the band. The footage was edited down to 92 minutes, and the film was released to theaters in 2002. The documentary has received generally positive reviews.|$|E
5|$|I {{think it}} is {{important}} that people see that spirituality is at the base of Nonviolent Communication, and that they learn the mechanics of the process with that in mind. It's really a spiritual practice that I <b>am</b> <b>trying</b> to show as a way of life. Even though we don't mention this, people get seduced by the practice. Even if they practice this as a mechanical technique, they start to experience things between themselves and other people they weren't able to experience before. So eventually they come to the spirituality of the process. They begin to see that it's more than a communication process and realize it's really an attempt to manifest a certain spirituality.|$|E

25|$|Jim Wyatt, of the Tennesseean, {{reports that}} Ringer is the {{favorite}} for the 3rd string job, and almost a lock to make the roster. Fullback Ahmard Hall said “He’s a character guy, and you could tell that from the start, He’s the total package. You rarely get that combination of humility and natural athletic ability and I think he has that great combination. You combine those two and you get someone who could be unstoppable.’’ Of all the praise, Ringer responded, “I have to give credit to how I was brought up. I {{grew up in a}} religious family and I know without God none of this would be possible for me anyway, so that definitely keeps me humble. My personality is not to boast and brag about the accomplishments and things I <b>am</b> <b>trying</b> to do. Actions speak louder than words and that is what I try and strive for.’’ In a 17-23 loss to the Cleveland Browns, Ringer only had one run for two yards. Ringer finished off the pre-season with a 7 carry 18 yard performance, in a 27-13 win over the Green Bay Packers.|$|E
25|$|I find it {{very hard}} to say this truth. I am to blame for {{everything}} I did at that time. I <b>am</b> <b>trying</b> to erase all this and to be what I was not at that time. I am also to blame for what I did not do, for not trying to protect those prisoners. Regardless of the temporary nature of my then-post. I ask myself again and again, what could I have done that I didn't do? Thousands of innocent victims perished. Graves remain behind, refugees, destruction and misfortune and misery. I bear general part of the responsibility for this. There is misfortune on all sides that stays behind as a warning that this should never happen again. My testimony and admission of guilt will also remove blame from my nation because it is individual guilt, the guilt of a man named Dragan Obrenović. I stand by this. I am responsible for this. The guilt for which I feel remorse and for which I apologise to the victims and to their shadows. I will be happy if this contributed to reconciliation in Bosnia, if neighbours can again shake hands, if our children can again play games together, and if {{they have the right to}} a chance. I will be happy if my testimony helps the families of victims, if I can spare them having to testify again and thus relive the horrors and the pain during their testimony. It is my wish that my testimony should help prevent this ever happening again, not just in Bosnia, but anywhere in the world. It is too late for me now, but for the children living in Bosnia now, it's not too late and I hope that this will be a good warning to them.|$|E

500|$|Kotche re-wrote {{the drum}} parts for the album almost {{immediately}} upon his acceptance into the band.

500|$|The [...] {{advent of}} war in September 1939 did not {{diminish}} Gibbons's creative energy. In November she {{began a series of}} articles, [...] "A Woman's Diary of the War", for St Martin's Review, the journal of the London church of St Martin-in-the-Fields. The series ran until November 1943, and includes many of Gibbons's private reflections on the conflict. In October 1941 she wrote: [...] "he war has done me good... I get a dour satisfaction out of managing the rations, salvaging, fire watching, and feeling that I <b>am</b> <b>trying</b> to work for a better world". In July 1940 Webb enlisted in the Middlesex Regiment, and the following year was commissioned into the King's Royal Rifle Corps. He later served overseas, mostly in Cairo.|$|E
500|$|Coomer wasn't {{the only}} band member that struck a nerve with Tweedy during the {{recording}} sessions. Tweedy {{was unhappy with}} the way that Bennett mixed parts of the album, particularly the sequences between songs. Tweedy felt that Bennett was [...] "burning out" [...] while mixing the album, and invited Jim O'Rourke to remix [...] "I <b>Am</b> <b>Trying</b> to Break Your Heart". Although Bennett conceded that O'Rourke did {{a better job of}} mixing the song, animosity arose between the two engineers. O'Rourke continued to remix more songs, and attempted to increase the drama of the album by reducing the contributions by the backing members of Wilco. He removed so many parts on some songs that only music by Tweedy, Kotche, and himself—the three members of Loose Fur—appeared on those pieces.|$|E

500|$|While {{a segment}} of the press has {{described}} Kapoor as friendly and extremely close to her family, others have criticized her for being arrogant and vain—an image she gained in the wake of her superficial character, Poo, in Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... (2001). She subsequently featured in films portraying similar characters, and this further established her off- and on-screen personae. Before the release of Chameli (2004) (in which she played a sex worker), Kapoor stated that [...] "there is a certain image that people identify you with [...] t always follows you whichever role you play. I <b>am</b> <b>trying</b> to transgress this image and become more screen-friendly than image-friendly." [...] Chameli helped Kapoor reinvent her on-screen persona, and she later explained that her honesty and openness was often perceived by the media as arrogance.|$|E

[...] The response {{after a few moments}} was a request from the others in the flight for suggestions. FT-74 tried again and a man identified as FT-28 (Taylor) came on. [...] "FT-28, this is FT-74, what is your trouble?" [...] "Both of my compasses are out", Taylor replied, [...] "and I <b>am</b> <b>trying</b> to find Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

[...] In 1956, Hemingway agreed to work on the filming of The Old Man and the Sea and abandoned work on the Africa book.
