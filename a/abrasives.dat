The tooth structure indicates combined slicing and grinding capabilities.|$|E
30|$|Two-body and three-body <b>abrasive</b> wear {{tests of}} katsura wood {{were carried out}} using <b>abrasive</b> paper and moving <b>abrasive</b> grains, respectively. The {{two-body}} and three-body <b>abrasive</b> wear properties were investigated and compared. The wear rate of two-body <b>abrasive</b> wear was two orders of magnitude larger than that of three-body <b>abrasive</b> wear. Moreover, two-body <b>abrasive</b> wear of katsura wood increased with higher applied surface pressure, whereas three-body <b>abrasive</b> wear did not always depend on the applied surface pressure. Based on these results and observation of the wear surface profiles, {{it is suggested that}} two-body <b>abrasive</b> wear is more affected by yield stress and surface microstructure, and three-body <b>abrasive</b> wear is more affected by the cutting action of moving <b>abrasive</b> grains. Furthermore, during wear tests with different <b>abrasive</b> grain sizes, critical grain size effects of two-body <b>abrasive</b> wear were observed at low applied surface pressures but not at high applied surface pressures. The critical grain size effects of three-body <b>abrasive</b> wear were observed at both low and high applied surface pressures.|$|R

The worn surface of the frictional samples morphology was observed by using Scanning Electron Microscopy, and the wearing mechanism of different <b>abrasive</b> to 45 # steel was analyzed. The results show that: on the experiment conditions, the wear loss from big to small is alfalfa <b>abrasive,</b> corn <b>abrasive</b> and wheat <b>abrasive,</b> and the wear rules of corn <b>abrasive</b> and wheat <b>abrasive</b> are similar, but the wear loss of alfalfa <b>abrasive</b> {{is much higher than}} the former two. The wear dominant mechanism of the wheat <b>abrasive</b> to 45 # steel is mechanical polishing, the wear dominant mechanism of the corn <b>abrasive</b> to 45 # steel is mechanical polishing and adhesive wear, the wear dominant mechanism of the alfalfa <b>abrasive</b> to 45 #steel is micro-cutting and adhesive wear...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, the {{influences}} of <b>abrasive</b> size, <b>abrasive</b> concentration and admixture way on the <b>abrasive</b> dispersing of the sintered ultra-fine diamond tool were systemically investigated. Then, {{a comparison of the}} <b>abrasive</b> dispersing was made between the sintered ultra-fine diamond tool and the newly developed ultra-fine diamond tool by gel technique. ESEM was applied to observe the <b>abrasive</b> dispersing of the sintered and gel-coupled ultra-fine diamond tools. The <b>abrasive</b> dispersing was quantitatively evaluated by the statistic laws of grit spacing in a certain area. Experimental results indicated that the dispersing was mainly influenced by the <b>abrasive</b> size. The ultra-fine <b>abrasive</b> tended to agglomerate with the decrease of grit sizes due to the increase of surface energies. The <b>abrasive</b> concentration and admixture way had few effects on <b>abrasive</b> dispersing. The <b>abrasive</b> dispersing of the sintered diamond tool was worse compared with the gel-coupled ultra-fine diamond tool...|$|R
5|$|Boron carbide and cubic {{boron nitride}} powders {{are widely used}} as <b>abrasives.</b> Boron nitride is a {{material}} isoelectronic to carbon. Similar to carbon, it has both hexagonal (soft graphite-like h-BN) and cubic (hard, diamond-like c-BN) forms. h-BN {{is used as a}} high temperature component and lubricant. c-BN, also known under commercial name borazon, is a superior abrasive. Its hardness is only slightly smaller than, but its chemical stability is superior, to that of diamond. Heterodiamond (also called BCN) is another diamond-like boron compound.|$|E
5|$|The most {{familiar}} uses of diamonds today are as gemstones used for adornment, a use which dates back into antiquity, and as industrial <b>abrasives</b> for cutting hard materials. The dispersion of white light into spectral colors {{is the primary}} gemological characteristic of gem diamonds. In the 20th century, experts in gemology developed methods of grading diamonds and other gemstones based on the characteristics most important to their value as a gem. Four characteristics, known informally as the four Cs, are now commonly used as the basic descriptors of diamonds: these are carat (its weight), cut (quality of the cut is graded according to proportions, symmetry and polish), color (how close to white or colorless; for fancy diamonds how intense is its hue), and clarity (how free is it from inclusions). A large, flawless diamond {{is known as a}} paragon.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{investigation}} of Olmec basalt workshops {{suggest that the}} colossal heads were first roughly shaped using direct percussion to chip away {{both large and small}} flakes of stone. The sculpture was then refined by retouching the surface using hammerstones, which were generally rounded cobbles that could be of the same basalt as the monument itself, although this was not always the case. <b>Abrasives</b> were found in association with workshops at San Lorenzo, indicating their use in the finishing of fine detail. Olmec colossal heads were fashioned as in-the-round monuments with varying levels of relief on the same work; they tended to feature higher relief on the face and lower relief on the earspools and headdresses. Monument20 at San Lorenzo is an extensively damaged throne with a figure emerging from a niche. Its sides were broken away and it was dragged to another location before being abandoned. It is possible that this damage was caused by the initial stages of re-carving the monument into a colossal head but that the work was never completed.|$|E
40|$|<b>Abrasive</b> flow {{machining}} (AFM) is {{an effective}} method to finish the smooth surface in the complex holes. <b>Abrasive</b> media are key elements which dominate the polished results in AFM. But {{it is hard to}} develop the machining model of these <b>abrasive</b> gels because of its complicated mechanism. In this research, a non-Newtonian flow is used to set up the <b>abrasive</b> mechanism of the <b>abrasive</b> media in AFM. Power law is a main equation of the non-Newtonian flow to describe the motion of the <b>abrasive</b> media. Viscosities vs. shear rates of different <b>abrasive</b> gels are used to establish the power law in CFD-ACE + software first. And the working parameters of AFM were applied as input to study the properties of the <b>abrasive</b> gels in AFM. Finally, the relationships between the simulations and the experiments were found. And the <b>abrasive</b> mechanism of the <b>abrasive</b> gels was set up in AFM. The simulated results show that the <b>abrasive</b> gel with high viscosity can entirely deform in the complex hole than the <b>abrasive</b> gel with low viscosity. And the <b>abrasive</b> gel with high viscosity generates a larger shear force than the <b>abrasive</b> gel with low viscosity in the same area. Moreover, the strain rate is seriously changed when the <b>abrasive</b> gel cross over the narrow cross-section of the complex hole. It also means that <b>abrasive</b> gel will produce large finish force in that area. And these results indeed consist with the experiments in AFM. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

5|$|Both {{commercial}} and artisanal fisheries have targeted mantas for their meat and products. They are typically caught with nets, trawls and harpoons. Mantas were once captured by fisheries in California and Australia for their liver oil and skin; {{the latter were}} used as <b>abrasives.</b> Their flesh is edible and is consumed in some countries, but is unattractive compared to other fish. Demand for their gill rakers, the cartilaginous structures protecting the gills, has recently entered Chinese medicine. To fill the growing demand in Asia for gill rakers, targeted fisheries have developed in Philippines, Indonesia, Mozambique, Madagascar, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Brazil and Tanzania. Each year, thousands of manta rays, primarily M. birostris, are caught and killed purely for their gill rakers. A fisheries study in Sri Lanka and India estimated that over 1000 were being sold in the country's fish markets each year. By comparison, M. birostris populations at most of the key aggregation sites {{around the world are}} estimated to have significantly fewer than 1000 individuals. Targeted fisheries for manta rays in the Gulf of California, the west coast of Mexico, India, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, and the Philippines have reduced populations in these areas dramatically.|$|E

5|$|Once {{purchased}} by Sightholders (which is a trademark term {{referring to the}} companies that have a three-year supply contract with DTC), diamonds are cut and polished in preparation for sale as gemstones ('industrial' stones are regarded as a by-product of the gemstone market; they are used for <b>abrasives).</b> The cutting and polishing of rough diamonds is a specialized skill that is concentrated in {{a limited number of}} locations worldwide. Traditional diamond cutting centers are Antwerp, Amsterdam, Johannesburg, New York City, and Tel Aviv. Recently, diamond cutting centers have been established in China, India, Thailand, Namibia and Botswana. Cutting centers with lower cost of labor, notably Surat in Gujarat, India, handle a larger number of smaller carat diamonds, while smaller quantities of larger or more valuable diamonds {{are more likely to be}} handled in Europe or North America. The recent expansion of this industry in India, employing low cost labor, has allowed smaller diamonds to be prepared as gems in greater quantities than was previously economically feasible.|$|E

40|$|Elastomeric seals {{are prone}} to failure caused by {{abrasion}} during sliding against rough surfaces. In this research, the two body <b>abrasive</b> wear of sealing elastomers in dry and lubricated conditions has been studied. A two body <b>abrasive</b> wear tester {{has been used to}} investigate the <b>abrasive</b> wear of the elastomers under varying test parameters. This test aparatus reciprocates a rectangular elastomeric sample against an <b>abrasive</b> paper wrapped around the circumferential surface of a wheel. The samples were weighed using an accurate scale before and after the tests to quantify the <b>abrasive</b> wear. The experiments have been carried out at varying normal load and <b>abrasive</b> size in dry and lubricated conditions. The influence of two different lubricants, including a synthetic ester and a mineral oil, together with the test parameters on the <b>abrasive</b> wear has been studied. The results show that, depending on the material, lubricant, <b>abrasive</b> size, normal load and test duration, the <b>abrasive</b> wear of elastomers may increase or decrease in the presence of lubricants, however, in most cases, the <b>abrasive</b> wear in the lubricated condition is higher than that in the dry condition.
