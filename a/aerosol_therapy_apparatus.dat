40|$|Advances in {{medicine}} and healthcare have resulted in significant improvements for those children and adolescents living with a chronic health condition. However, the treatments prescribed will only work if they are taken. Rates of adherence to treatment in cystic fibrosis are low. This {{is especially true for}} adherence to <b>aerosol</b> <b>therapy,</b> a particular concern considering the reliance on <b>aerosol</b> <b>therapy</b> for the treatment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The advent of Adaptive Aerosol Delivery™ (AAD) technology has enabled accurate and objective measurement of adherence to <b>aerosol</b> <b>therapy</b> treatment. However, the factors which influence the process of adhering to <b>aerosol</b> <b>therapy</b> remain largely elusive. Therefore, the current study aims to qualitatively explore the process of adhering to <b>aerosol</b> <b>therapy</b> in a clinical sample of adolescents with CF from both a patient and parent perspective. In addition, objective data downloaded from an AAD device (the I-neb™, Respironics, Chichester, UK) will be used to cue reflections on actual events around adherence. 12 participants were interviewed (six parent-child dyads). The participating adolescents were all aged between 11 and 16 years and had a CF diagnosis. There were five mothers and one father who took part. The parent and adolescent data were analysed separately using the Grounded Theory Method. Nine core categories for the parent data and nine core categories for the adolescent data were developed into a coherent framework and represented as a theoretical formulation which described the process of adhering to <b>aerosol</b> <b>therapy</b> from both a parent and adolescent patient perspective. The theoretical formulation highlights the complexity involved and details the numerous interacting biological, psychological, social and environmental influences on adherence to <b>aerosol</b> <b>therapy.</b> These findings are discussed in relation to the existing literature and clinical implications are considered.

The document deals with the principles of and indications for rhinologic <b>aerosol</b> <b>therapy.</b> Materials and methodsThe work group's methodology followed the rules published by the French health authority (Haute Autorité de santé [HAS]) in January 2006 : “Methodological foundations for drawing up professional guidelines by formalized consensus” (available on the HAS website at [URL] The method used is the short version (without editorial group) of the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method; the short version was chosen because this particular consensus conference was dealing with a very precise topic with very few experts in the field. ResultsSonic <b>aerosol</b> <b>therapy</b> with nasal plug is the preferred modality, delivering treatment into the middle meati. The group recommends that drugs with market authorization for use in bronchopulmonary pathology should be nebulized in two 10 -minute sessions per day for at least seven days. Indications for rhinologic <b>aerosol</b> <b>therapy</b> are: purulent edematous rhinosinusitis, subacute rhinosinusitis (4 – 12  weeks’ evolution), exacerbations of chronic rhinosinusitis, and postoperative (> 1  month) rhinosinus suppuration.

40|$|Inhalation of aerosolized drugs {{has become}} an {{established}} means for treatment of pulmonary diseases in the last fifiy years. The majoriry of <b>aerosol</b> <b>therapy</b> in childhood concerns inhaled corticosteroids and bronchodilators {{in the management of}} asthma. Administration of drugs via the inhaled route has major advantages over the oral route. The drug is targeted directly to its site of action, which results in a more rapid effect and a lower dose needed with less systemic side effects. However, to deliver the drug into the lungs reliably and reproducibly is difficult, especially in children. It requires understanding of the mechanisms of aerosol deposition in the lungs and knowledge about the factors affecting delivery and deposition of aerosols. There are several ways to deliver therapeutic aerosols to the lungs. The current methods can be classified in three categoties: nebulizers, pressurized metered dose inhales (pMDI's) with or without spacer, and dry powder inhalers (DPT's). Not all systems are suirable for use in young children. Application of <b>aerosol</b> <b>therapy</b> in young children requires a different approach compared vvith adults and older children. Factors such as age, co-operation, breathing pattern, nose breathing and size of the airways should be raken into account as they can have substantial effect on the dose delivered to the lungs. Nebulizers have long been the mainstay of <b>aerosol</b> <b>therapy</b> in children. Currently, the pMDI combined with spacer is recommended as the first choice for asthma therapy in young children. However, the pMDIIspacer and most other aerosol delivery systems were primarily designed for use in adults, and subsequently adapted for use in children. Furthermore, studying efficiency of aerosol delivery systems in young children is difficult and has ethical limitations. This explains why there is extended information available on the performance of aerosol delivery systems in adults, but only limited data in children. The use of drugs with potential side effects, such as corticosteroids, requires precise dosing with the administration of the lowest effective dose. Therefore, knowledge about the dose inhaled and factors affecting this dose for each particular drug, device and patient is necessary for optimal application of <b>aerosol</b> <b>therapy.</b> Better understanding of <b>aerosol</b> <b>therapy</b> in children is urgently needed...|$|R

40|$|Background: Considering the {{prevalence}} and associated {{burden of disease}} due to bronchial asthma, it is mandatory to obtain an optimal control {{of the disease and}} to improve outcomes for these patients. But it has been observed that there is very poor adherence to the inhalational therapy which leads to the suboptimal control of the disease. Objectives of the Study: To study the adherence for <b>aerosol</b> <b>therapy</b> in bronchial asthma patients and {{to assess the impact of}} health education and self-action plan in improving the compliance to the therapy. Methodology: A prospective study was done in a total of 500 bronchial asthma patients over a period of 2 years. Once included in the study, the patients were followed-up for a total of 12 weeks for calculation of nonadherence to the <b>aerosol</b> <b>therapy.</b> In nonadherent patients, we employed various health education strategies to improve the compliance in these cases. Results: A total of 500 patients of bronchial asthma who were started on <b>aerosol</b> <b>therapy</b> over duration of 2 years were included in the study. At the end of 12 weeks, it was observed that, only 193 patients (38. 6 %) had regular compliance and 307 patients (61. 4 %) were noncompliant to <b>aerosol</b> <b>therapy</b> as prescribed for bronchial asthma. Factors that were associated with poor compliance were: Lower educational level status, poor socioeconomic status, cumbersome regimens, dislike of medication, and distant pharmacies. Nondrug factors that reduced the compliance were: Fears about side effects, anger about condition or its treatment, forgetfulness or complacency, and patient′s ill attitudes toward health. After employing the various strategies for improving the compliance in these patients, the compliance increased in 176 patients (57. 3 %) among the earlier defaulted patients, while the remaining 131 patients (42. 7 %) were found to be noncompliant even after various educational techniques. Conclusion: Noncompliance in asthma management is a fact of life and no single compliance improving strategy probably will be as effective as a good physician-patient relationship. Optimal self-management allowing for optimization of asthma control by adjustment of medications may be conducted by either self-adjustment with the aid of a written action plan or by regular medical review. Individualized written action plans based on peak expiratory flow are equivalent to action plans based on symptoms...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{surface-active}} lipopolymeric nanohybrids (LPH) measuring 200 - 300 nm were developed and evaluated for their efficacy as non-invasive <b>aerosol</b> <b>therapy</b> to reduce lung inflammation and lung injury in rats caused by 5 mg per kg body weight intratracheally administered lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The nanoparticles comprised of phospholipids DPPC and POPG along with polymeric anti-oxidant D-alpha-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS) or dexamethasone disodium phosphate (DXP) or both. The formulation closely mimics surface tension modulation properties like innate pulmonary surfactant (PS). The dual drug LPH (Dual-LPH) <b>aerosol</b> <b>therapy</b> provided maximum beneficial effect compared to individual drug loaded nanoparticle aerosol treatment. Chest X-rays and lung tissue histopathological studies revealed that Dual-LPH <b>aerosol</b> <b>therapy</b> at {{a dose of}} 200 mg phospholipid + 50 mg TPGS + 2 mg DXP per kg body weight significantly reduced inflammation, damage to the alveolar network and pulmonary hemorrhage in LPS injured rats.

BALF capillary patency studies revealed rise in capillary patency from 0 % for LPS injured group to 99. 7 +/- 0. 1 % for Dual-LPH treated group, which is comparable to that of innate surfactant in healthy conditions, indicating that Dual-LPH treatment helped in opening occluded airways. Surface-active TPGS helped in scavenging the free radicals in the injured lungs whereas DXP helped in modulating the inflammation pathway.

40|$|The {{clinical}} use of various aerosol production apparatus for chronic sinusitis was examined. The results are summarized as follows. 1) In <b>aerosol</b> inhalation <b>therapy</b> for chrohic sinusitis {{the most essential}} {{point is that the}} natural ostia are sufficiently open. 2) Nasal cavities and paranasal sinuses are part of a single organ. Therefore the jet nebulizer and the ultrasonic nebulizer for nasal cavity were also useful for paranasal sinuses when the middle meatus lesions were reversible. 3) The most important factor in promoting aerosol deposition in paranasal sinuses was the application of pressure. Without pressure, none of the nebulizers was able to administer sufficient amounts of therapeutic agents. 4) The ultrasonic nebulizer with pressure added was able to administer the largest amount of agent to the paranasal sinuses. As chronic sinusitis is becoming less severe, <b>aerosol</b> inhalation <b>therapy</b> is becoming more widely used.

40|$|Aims: To present new {{developments}} in antibiotic <b>aerosol</b> <b>therapy</b> {{in the treatment of}} tuberculosis (TB). The purpose and potential advantages of aerosol treatment will be discussed. Finally, technical developments will be discussed {{in the light of the}} clinical objective and requirements from the antibiotics and their use. Summary: The rise of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis and extensively-drug resistant tuberculosis strains are a threat to global health. Since the lungs are the main port of entry for the mycobacterium tuberculosis, pulmonary administration of antibioticsseemsanattractive therapeutic option. Potential advantages of pulmonary drug administration in TB encompass: a reduced change of transmission of the disease; a high local exposure, related to an increased therapeutic efficacy; a decreased systemic exposure, which may reduce side effects; the prevention of the development of new drug resistant strains of mycobacteria; and compared to parenteral administration, inhalation does not require medically trained personnel, is free from the injec- tionassociated infection risks and cheaper. So far, only limited information is available from human studies. The increasing lung surface leads to the question whether the drug concentrations attained upon inhalation are sufficient to obtain the antimicrobial effect in the deeper lung. This may shift the purpose of the <b>aerosol</b> <b>therapy</b> to the prevention of transmission. Pulmonary administration of anti-TB drugs is associated with several challenges for the drug delivery system (formulation and inhalation device). These challenges are related to aspects such as: a high dose, prevention of re-infection via the device and world-wide availability. Conclusions: <b>Aerosol</b> <b>therapy</b> of antibiotics offers a number of potential advantages. However, the prevention of transmission may be a more important objective than treatment of the patient. The development of adequate inhalation devices for TB antibiotics is challenging...|$|R

40|$|In this dissertation, the inspiratory {{air flow}} and aerosol {{deposition}} {{in the human}} oral airway are simulated using a commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software package, CFX. The dissertation consists of two parts: ^ In the first part, a three-dimensional curvilinear body-fitted grid system was developed based on the geometry of an anatomically accurate human oral airway. The respiratory tract consists of oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx and upper trachea. Velocity profiles and pressure fields at various inspiratory flow rates observed during <b>aerosol</b> medicine <b>therapy</b> were simulated. Both laminar and turbulent models were employed depending on the Reynolds number defined at the smallest cross-sectional area in the airway. The numerical method described above can be valuable components of <b>aerosol</b> <b>therapy,</b> toxicology risk assessment and basic medical research. ^ In the second part, the trajectories of particles in the human oral airway during mouth only inhalation were simulated, taking particle inertial impaction and sedimentation into consideration. Arrays of particles evenly distributed {{at the entrance of}} the oral airway were launched at the same velocity of airflow. Each of the particles was carefully traced all the way down and its destination recorded. The fraction of particles deposited in each individual airway segments were calculated. Graphical distributions of these particles were presented.

This paper presents a comparative study of the deposition of micron and submicron particles under different steady laminar flow rates using a Lagrangian approach. A computational model of a nasal cavity geometry was developed from CT scans and the simulation of the fluid and particle flow within the airway was performed using the commercial software GAMBIT and FLUENT. The air flow patterns in the nasal cavities and the detailed local deposition patterns of micron and submicron particles were presented and discussed.

The deposition patterns of micron particles in the left cavity are different compared with that in the right one especially in the turbinate regions. In contrast, the deposition for nanoparticles shows a moderately even distribution of particles throughout the airway. Furthermore the particles releasing position obviously influences the local deposition patterns. The influence of the particle releasing position is mainly shown near the nasal valve region for micron particle deposition, while for submicron particles deposition, both the nasal valve and turbinate region are influenced.

RESULTS: A total of 9714 aerosols were administered to 678 of the 2808 admitted patients (24  %, CI 95 22 - 26  %), whereas only 271 patients (10  %) were taking inhaled medication before admission. There were large variations among centers, from 0 to 57  %. Among intubated patients 22  % (n =  262) received aerosols, and 50  % (n =  149) of patients undergoing NIV, predominantly (75  %) inbetween NIV sessions. Bronchodilators (n =  7960) and corticosteroids (n =  1233) were the most frequently delivered drugs (88  % overall), predominantly but not exclusively (49  %) administered to patients with chronic airway disease. An anti-infectious drug was aerosolized 509 times (5  % of all aerosols) for nosocomial infections. Jet-nebulizers were the most frequently used device (56  %), followed by metered dose inhalers (23  %). Only 106 (< 1  %) mild side effects were observed, despite frequent suboptimal set-ups such as an external gas supply of jet nebulizers for intubated patients.

40|$|SummaryInhalers and nebulisers are devices {{used for}} {{delivering}} aerosolised drugs {{in subjects with}} Chronic Airflow Obstruction (CAO). This multicentre, cross-sectional observational study was performed in a large population of outpatients with CAO regularly using home <b>aerosol</b> <b>therapy</b> and referring to chest clinics. The aims {{of the study were}} to compare the characteristics of the group of subjects with CAO who were using home nebulisers but also experienced with inhalers vs. those only using inhalers and to investigate whether the first group of subjects was particularly prone to inhaler misuse. Information was gained evaluating the responses to a standardised questionnaire on home <b>aerosol</b> <b>therapy</b> and the observations of inhaler technique. We enrolled 1527 patients (58 % males; mean ± SE; aged 61. 1  ±  0. 4 years; FEV 1 % pred 69. 9  ±  0. 6; 51 % and 44 % respectively suffering from COPD and asthma) who were only inhaler users (OIU group) and 137 (85 % males; aged 67. 7  ±  1. 3 years; FEV 1 % pred 62. 3  ±  2. 9; 60 % and 23 % respectively suffering from COPD and asthma) who were using both nebulisers and inhalers (NIU group). Nebuliser users were older, had more severe obstruction, related symptoms and health care resources utilisation. Nebulisers users performed more critical inhalers errors than those of the OIU group (49 % vs. 36 %; p =  0. 009). We conclude that our patients with CAO and regular nebuliser treatment had advanced age, severe respiratory conditions and common inhaler misuse...|$|R
