Three of these offices deal substantially with public safety and justice: the sheriff, commonwealth's attorney, and the clerk of the circuit court. The two other offices are concerned with fiscal policy: the city treasurer and the commissioner of the revenue.|$|E

5|$|Nauru {{does not}} have any formal {{structure}} for political parties, <b>and</b> <b>candidates</b> typically stand for office as independents; fifteen of the 19members of the current Parliament are independents. Four parties that have been active in Nauruan politics are the Nauru Party, the Democratic Party, Nauru First, and the Centre Party. However, alliances within the government are often formed on the basis of extended family ties rather than party affiliation.|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} the results obtained from an attempt for multi-criteria analysis of the economic activity in 2008 for European Union Member States <b>and</b> <b>candidate</b> countries. In analysis of the economic activities of member <b>and</b> <b>candidate</b> countries, five macro-economic criteria have been considered. These are; Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Exports, Imports, Inflation rate and Unemployment rate. The European Union Member States <b>and</b> <b>candidate</b> countries were analyzed and sorted under the five criteria by means of TOPSIS and WSA methods...|$|R

40|$|This study takes a {{two-stage}} {{approach to}} examining {{the impact of}} the electoral college on turnout in the 2000 presidential election. First, we examine whether battleground states received more media spending and visits by the <b>candidates</b> <b>and</b> their party committees compared to nonbattleground states. Second, we examine whether media spending <b>and</b> <b>candidate</b> visits were related to state-level turnout. The results of the project show that the battleground states did receive significantly more media expenditures <b>and</b> <b>candidate</b> visits from the two major party campaigns than nonbattleground states. Furthermore, when controlling for state-level contextual and political factors, the more media expenditures <b>and</b> <b>candidate</b> visits a state received the higher the state turnout. Finally, the analysis reveals that state battleground status indirectly impacted state-level turnout through its effect on media spending <b>and</b> <b>candidate</b> visits...|$|R
5|$|Following the {{deployment}} of the AIF a reinforcement system was used to replace wastage. Reinforcements received training in Australia before sailing as drafts and joining their assigned units at the front. To provide officer reinforcements, a series of AIF officer schools, such as that at Broadmeadows, were established in Australia before officer training was eventually concentrated at a school near Duntroon. These schools produced {{a large number of}} officers, but they were eventually closed in 1917 due to concerns that their graduates were too inexperienced and after this most replacement officers were drawn from the ranks of the AIF's deployed units, <b>and</b> <b>candidates</b> attended either British officer training units, or in-theatre schools established in France. After February 1916, the issue of NCO training was also taken more seriously, and several schools were established, with training initially being two weeks in duration before being increased to two months.|$|E
5|$|Preliminary {{reports on}} {{election}} night, November 4, were that Coleman was leading by over 700 votes, {{but by the}} official results, certified on November 18, 2008, Coleman led by only 215 votes. As the two candidates were separated by less than 0.5 {{percent of the votes}} cast, the Minnesota Secretary of State, Mark Ritchie, authorized an automatic recount provided for in Minnesota election law. In the recount, ballots and certifying materials were examined by hand, <b>and</b> <b>candidates</b> could file challenges to the legality of ballots or materials for inclusion or exclusion In the recount. On January 5, 2009, the Minnesota State Canvassing Board certified the recounted vote totals, with Franken ahead by 225 votes.|$|E

Following ratification of the decisions taken at the National Congress, the National Congress dissolves itself.

5|$|The Sex Party was {{registered}} with Elections BC in March 2005 with its founder, John Ince, also {{acting as the}} party leader. Ince was a Vancouver lawyer, author and co-owner of a store that hosted educational seminars and artistic shows about human sexuality, as well as selling sex-themed merchandise. He had been critical of government laws that perpetuated or resulted in harmful attitudes towards sex-related issues. Ince previously authored a non-fiction book, The Politics of Lust, which addresses the impact of antisexual attitudes or erotophobia on a society's political organization. The party launched its election platform <b>and</b> <b>candidates</b> {{at a press conference}} at the Vancouver Public Library in April.|$|E
5|$|The {{campaign}} {{period for}} parties <b>and</b> <b>candidates</b> began on 11 March and continued until 1 April. It was {{split into two}} phases by Nyepi, the Balinese day of silence. Parties delivered their national agendas indoors between 11 and 25 March. Although this was meant to encourage dialogue between parties and their constituents, these events were poorly attended. The International Foundation for Electoral Systems conducted a tracking survey that showed not all voters knew how to vote for candidates of the new DPD, or were even aware it existed.|$|E
5|$|The same {{procedure}} applies to local elections, except that council-election lists require 100, 150 and 500 endorsements for town, city and county-council lists respectively. The city of Zagreb council {{is treated as}} a county council under election law. The number of voter signatures on mayoral and county prefect candidate nominations ranges between 50 (for mayoral elections in towns of up to 1,000 residents), 100 (for other town mayoral candidates), 500 (for mayoral elections in cities of up to 35,000 residents), 1,000 (in cities with populations between 35,000 and 100,000) and 2,000 endorsements for cities of 100,000 residents or more (with the exception of Zagreb). County prefect election candidates require 2,500 endorsements, <b>and</b> <b>candidates</b> running for mayor of Zagreb need 5,000 voter endorsements for their nominations to become valid.|$|E

5|$|Briarcliff Manor {{maintains}} a voting custom that dates {{to at least}} around 1905. In addition to its customary general election, held at the same day in every municipality in New York, the village has a nonpartisan caucus, a town meeting-style forum to determine officeholders. The system of the People's Caucus is largely unique to the village, and {{has been described as}} an extension of the New England town hall concept. The People's Caucus, officially formed in 1946, chooses candidates by majority vote two months before the village election, where the candidates usually run unopposed, turning the election into a formality. The caucus is open to citizens of 18 years or over who have lived in the village for at least a month; voter registration is not required. Voters <b>and</b> <b>candidates</b> do not declare party affiliations, instead candidates present their platforms in early January of each year, and weeks later the caucus meets again to vote.|$|E
5|$|Legislation {{requires}} that all presidential and parliamentary election candidates (or slates) are guaranteed equal opportunity to present and discuss their platforms {{in the media}} (in addition to paid advertising). In 2007 the parliamentary election campaign was covered by all media, including nationwide television broadcasters. During this period the broadcasters, which included Croatian Radiotelevision (HTV), RTL Televizija (RTL) and Nova TV, aired 27.8hours of news on 22 different programs with 1,196 news reports. This total included 171 reports dealing directly with the elections. Analysis of news coverage indicated evenly-matched coverage of the combined ruling party (HDZ) and official government statements on one side, and the main opposition party (SDP) on the other; each received an average of a 37.5-percent share of coverage and a 33-percent share of interviews aired. HTV and Nova TV gave a slight advantage to the HDZ and the government, while RTL gave more coverage to the SDP. However, the differences were small and resulted in matching ratios. Other political parties received considerably less coverage. HNS received an average of approximately 11 percent of the coverage, HSS received six percent and all other parties received less than five-percent coverage. The national television broadcasters air programs where all slates <b>and</b> <b>candidates</b> may talk about their platforms and organise debates.|$|E
