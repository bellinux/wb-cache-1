2500|$|Life jackets for {{outfitting}} large commercial transport {{ventures in}} potentially dangerous waters, such as coastal cruises, offshore passages, and overwater air flights, consisting of either a single air chamber or {{a pair of}} (twin or double) sealed air chambers constructed of coated nylon (sometimes with a protective outer encasing of heavier, tougher material such as vinyl), joined together. For use aboard ships they may be constructed of foam. [...] Twin air chambers provide for redundancy {{in the event of}} one of the air chambers leaking or failing to [...] "fire", for example if the thin <b>air</b> <b>cell</b> fabric is sliced open by sharp metal fragments during emergency evacuation and egress. Most life jackets for leisure use are of the single air chamber type.|$|E
50|$|The <b>air</b> <b>cell</b> {{is a small}} {{cylindrical}} chamber {{with a hole in}} one end. It is mounted more or less coaxially with the injector, said axis being parallel to the piston crown, with the injector firing across a small cavity which is open to the cylinder into the hole in the end of the <b>air</b> <b>cell.</b> The <b>air</b> <b>cell</b> is mounted so as to minimise thermal contact with the mass of the head. A pintle injector with a narrow spray pattern is used. At TDC the majority of the charge mass is contained in the cavity and <b>air</b> <b>cell.</b>|$|E
50|$|The larger {{end of the}} egg {{contains}} the <b>air</b> <b>cell</b> that forms when {{the contents of the}} egg cool down and contract after it is laid. Chicken eggs are graded according to the size of this <b>air</b> <b>cell,</b> measured during candling. A very fresh egg has a small <b>air</b> <b>cell</b> and receives a grade of AA. As the size of the <b>air</b> <b>cell</b> increases {{and the quality of the}} egg decreases, the grade moves from AA to A to B. This provides a way of testing the age of an egg: as the <b>air</b> <b>cell</b> increases in size due to air being drawn through pores in the shell as water is lost, the egg becomes less dense and the larger end of the egg will rise to increasingly shallower depths when the egg is placed in a bowl of water. A very old egg will actually float in the water and should not be eaten.|$|E
50|$|The antrum {{communicates}} {{behind and}} below with the mastoid <b>air</b> <b>cells,</b> which vary considerably in number, size, and form; the antrum and mastoid <b>air</b> <b>cells</b> are lined by mucous membrane, continuous with that lining the tympanic cavity.|$|R
40|$|Electric energy can be {{obtained}} via the electrochemical reaction of aluminium and oxygen. This is the same way of energy conversion as already known from zinc <b>air</b> <b>cells.</b> Zinc <b>air</b> <b>cells</b> are applied as power sources for hearing aids and isolated signals. A galvanic cell for the conversion of metals and oxygen often {{is included in the}} group of fuel cells, the metal replacing the fuel. The development of aluminium <b>air</b> <b>cells</b> so far was focused on power sources for electric vehicles and on different sea water applications...|$|R

50|$|When the {{injector}} fires, the {{jet of fuel}} {{enters the}} <b>air</b> <b>cell</b> and ignites. This results in a jet of flame shooting {{back out of the}} <b>air</b> <b>cell</b> directly into the jet of fuel still issuing from the injector. The heat and turbulence give excellent fuel vaporisation and mixing properties. Also since the majority of the combustion takes place outside the <b>air</b> <b>cell</b> in the cavity, which communicates directly with the cylinder, there is less heat loss involved in transferring the burning charge into the cylinder.|$|E

Inflammation which has spread to the mastoid <b>air</b> <b>cells</b> is very difficult to drain and causes considerable pain. Before the advent of antibiotics it could only be drained by drilling a hole in the mastoid bone, a process known as mastoidectomy.|$|R

40|$|Research on {{the produce}} of {{renewable}} energy {{as a source of}} solar power has continuously advanced. We have proposed an energy cycle that uses solar-pumped pulse lasers and base metal nanoparticles. Here, Fe and Al nanoparticles were prepared by laser ablation in liquid for the energy cycle. Solar power was confined in base metal nanoparticles. Metal plates were fabricated by sintering metal paste with base metal nanoparticles. Electricity was generated by <b>air</b> <b>cells</b> using the sintered metal plate. A highly repetitive laser pulse, which was an alternative to lasers driven by solar power, was used for laser ablation in liquid, and metal oxides (Fe 3 O 4 or Al 2 O 3) were reduced and metal nanoparticles were fabricated. Metal plates with a low electrical resistance were fabricated by sintering them at a low temperature of 520 K. The electrical properties of the <b>air</b> <b>cells</b> fabricated using sintered paste with nanoparticles as negative electrical cathodes were the same as those of the <b>air</b> <b>cells</b> fabricated in a blast furnace. It was found that the sintered metal nanopaste could be used for <b>air</b> <b>cells...</b>|$|R

5000|$|In {{some cases}} the <b>air</b> <b>cell</b> opens on this surface of the bone and then {{communicates}} with the posterior ethmoidal cells. More rarely it opens on both surfaces, and then communicates with the posterior ethmoidal cells and the sphenoidal sinus.|$|E

40|$|Microstructural {{evolution}} in soft matter directly influences {{not only the}} material 2 ̆ 7 s mechanical and functional properties, but also our perception of that material 2 ̆ 7 s taste. Using synchrotron X-ray tomography and cryo-SEM we investigated the time-temperature evolution of ice cream 2 ̆ 7 s microstructure. This was enabled via three advances in synchrotron tomography: a bespoke tomography cold stage; improvements in pink beam in line phase contrast; and a novel image processing strategy for reconstructing and denoising in line phase contrast tomographic images. Using these three advances, we qualitatively and quantitatively investigated the effect of thermal changes on the ice cream 2 ̆ 7 s microstructure after 0, 7 and 14 thermal cycles between - 15 and - 5 °C. The results demonstrate the effect of thermal cycling on the coarsening of both the <b>air</b> <b>cells</b> and ice crystals in ice cream. The growth of ice crystals almost ceases after 7 thermal cycles when they approach {{the size of the}} walls between <b>air</b> <b>cells,</b> while <b>air</b> <b>cells</b> continue to coarsen, forming interconnected channels. We demonstrate that the tomographic volumes provide a statistically more representative sample than cryo-SEM, and elucidate the three dimensional morphology and connectivity of phases. This resulted in new insights including the role of <b>air</b> <b>cells</b> in limiting ice crystal coarsening...|$|R
5000|$|The mastoid portion is {{at first}} flat, with the stylomastoid foramen and {{rudimentary}} styloid immediately behind the tympanic ring. With <b>air</b> <b>cell</b> development, {{the outer part}} of the mastoid component grows anteroinferiorly to form the mastoid process, with the styloid and stylomastoid foramen now on the under surface. The descent of the foramen {{is accompanied by a}} requisite lengthening of the facial canal.|$|E

On July 15 the brothers flew it for 45 minutes from Saint-Cloud to Meudon accompanied by M. Collin-Hullin and Louis Philippe II, the Duke of Chartres. The {{absence of a}} lifting gas release valve meant that the Duke had to slash the envelope to prevent it rupturing when they reached an altitude of about 4,500 metres (15,000 ft).|$|E

50|$|The ethmoidal sinuses or ethmoidal <b>air</b> <b>cells</b> of the ethmoid bone {{are one of}} {{the four}} paired {{paranasal}} sinuses. They are a variable in both size and number of small cavities in the lateral mass of each of the ethmoid bones and cannot be palpated during an extraoral examination. They are divided into the anterior, middle and posterior groups (see below). The ethmoidal <b>air</b> <b>cells</b> consist of numerous thin-walled cavities situated in the ethmoidal labyrinth and completed by the frontal, maxilla, lacrimal, sphenoidal, and palatine bones. They lie between the upper parts of the nasal cavities and the orbits, and are separated from these cavities by thin bony laminae.|$|R
50|$|There is a 40 ft pure {{electric}} bus being developed, using a pre-commercial battery technology. Electric Fuel Corporation is developing and demonstrating a 40 ft electric bus {{powered by a}} zinc <b>air</b> <b>cell,</b> along with an ultracapacitor. The zinc-air energy device, often described as a battery, converts zinc to zinc oxide {{in a process that}} provides energy to the bus. The bus is not recharged; instead, the zinc oxide cartridges are swapped out for new zinc ones. This bus has shown a range of over 100 mi in testing and has been demonstrated in Las Vegas, Nevada. However, this technology is in the development phase, and several major hurdles must be overcome before it can be adopted for transit fleet use, including available refueling infrastructure or use in bus stations.|$|E
50|$|Mastoiditis is {{the result}} of an {{infection}} that extends to the air cells of the skull behind the ear. Specifically, it is an inflammation of the mucosal lining of the mastoid antrum and mastoid <b>air</b> <b>cell</b> system inside the mastoid process. The mastoid process is the portion of the temporal bone of the skull that is behind the ear which contains open, air-containing spaces. Mastoiditis is usually caused by untreated acute otitis media (middle ear infection) and used to be a leading cause of child mortality. With the development of antibiotics, however, mastoiditis has become quite rare in developed countries where surgical treatment is now much less frequent and more conservative, unlike former times. Additionally, {{there is no evidence that}} the drop in antibiotic prescribing for otitis media has increased the incidence of mastoiditis, raising the possibility that the drop in reported cases is due to a confounding factor such as childhood immunizations against Haemophilus and Streptococci. Untreated, the infection can spread to surrounding structures, including the brain, causing serious complications.|$|E
50|$|Le Fort III {{fracture}} (transverse), {{otherwise known}} as craniofacial dissociation, may follow impact to the nasal bridge or upper maxilla. The salient feature of these fractures, beyond pterygoid plate involvement, is that they invariably involve the zygomatic arch, or cheek bone. These fractures begin at the nasofrontal and frontomaxillary sutures and extend posteriorly along the medial wall of the orbit, through the nasolacrimal groove and ethmoid air cells. The sphenoid is thickened posteriorly, limiting fracture extension into the optic canal. Instead, the fracture continues along the orbital floor and infraorbital fissure, continuing through the lateral orbital wall to the zygomaticofrontal junction and zygomatic arch. Within the nose, the fracture extends through {{the base of the}} perpendicular plate of the ethmoid air cells, the vomer, which are both part of the nasal septum. As with the other fractures, it also involves the junction of the pterygoids with the maxillary sinuses. CSF rhinorrhea, or leakage of the nutrient laden fluid that bathes the brain, is more commonly seen with these injuries due to ethmoid <b>air</b> <b>cell</b> disruption, as the air cells are located immediately beneath the skull base.|$|E

40|$|Numerous micro-channels have {{recently}} been discovered in the human temporal bone by x-ray micro-CT-scanning. After a preliminary study suggesting that these micro-channels form a separate blood supply for the mucosa of the mastoid <b>air</b> <b>cells,</b> a structural analysis of the micro-channels using a local structure tensor was carried out. Despite the high-resolution of the micro-CT scan, presence of noise within the <b>air</b> <b>cells</b> along with missing information in some micro-channels suggested the need of image enhancement. This paper proposes an adaptive enhancement of the micro-channels based on a local structure analysis while minimizing the impact of noise on the overall data.

40|$|Suspensions of micron sized <b>air</b> <b>cells,</b> <b>Air</b> Filled Emulsions (AFEs), {{represent}} a new colloidal material with outstanding physical properties. They {{have the potential}} for technological applications in very different fields such as biomedical, environmental sciences and the food industry. This thesis focuses on the construction of AFEs and their use as ingredients to construct reduced fat and calorie emulsion-based products. These microstructurally complex materials have been termed triphasic A/O/W emulsions. A sonochemical templating process has allowed for the construction of <b>air</b> <b>cells</b> (the majority around 0. 5 - 10 μm) in the size range of oil droplets found in emulsion based foods. <b>Air</b> <b>cells</b> were stabilised with either hydrophobins, obtained from submerged fermentation and extraction, or other cysteine rich but more common proteins such as bovine serum albumin (BSA) and egg albumen (EWP). The <b>air</b> <b>cells</b> were stable against disproportionation and ripening for substantial periods of time. They resisted destabilisation effect of oil droplets and could survive unit operations involving mild vacuum treatment and centrifugal forces, relatively high shear forces, temperatures and pressures. Triphasic A/O/W emulsions were created with up to 60 % included phase of air and oil in an aqueous continuous phase. This gave a greater than 50 % reduction in lipid content. Comparative rheology and tribology showed that the triphasic A/O/W emulsions could have similar if not better lubrication properties than a full O/W version. The molecular properties of the protein used for the AFEs {{played a crucial role in}} the determination of lubrication properties (mouth-feel). Moreover, AFEs and triphasic emulsions offer the potential for new structures and textures for the food industry due to their self interaction to give a weak gelEThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
