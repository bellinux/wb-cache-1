5|$|The use of {{lead for}} water pipes is {{problematic}} {{in areas with}} soft or <b>acidic</b> <b>water.</b> Hard water forms insoluble layers in the pipes whereas soft and <b>acidic</b> <b>water</b> dissolves the lead pipes. Dissolved {{carbon dioxide in the}} carried water may result in the formation of soluble lead bicarbonate; oxygenated water may similarly dissolve lead as lead(II) hydroxide. Drinking such water, over time, can cause health problems due to the toxicity of the dissolved lead. The harder the water the more calcium bicarbonate and sulfate it will contain, and the more the inside of the pipes will be coated with a protective layer of lead carbonate or lead sulfate.|$|E
5|$|LACM 149371 is {{a poorly}} {{preserved}} molar-like tooth that largely lacks a recognizable enamel surface and shows many small grooves and holes on the crown surface. This suggests the tooth {{may have been}} chemically degraded, perhaps by <b>acidic</b> <b>water</b> or because it passed through the digestive tract of a predator. The roots are broken off, but remaining pulp cavities suggest the presence of four main roots, which are partially joined into two pairs. A smaller pulp cavity between those roots suggests the likely presence of a fifth root and a slight depression in the tooth may represent another root.|$|E
5|$|The {{eruption}} produced pyroclastic flows that melted summit glaciers and snow, generating four thick lahars that raced down river valleys on the volcano's flanks, destroying a {{small lake}} that {{was observed in}} Arenas' crater several months before the eruption. Water in such volcanic lakes tends to be extremely salty, and may contain dissolved volcanic gases. The lake's hot, <b>acidic</b> <b>water</b> significantly accelerated the melting of the ice, an effect confirmed by the large amounts of sulfates and chlorides found in the lahar flow.|$|E

5|$|The wood used {{to build}} the track is now classed as bog-wood, the name given to wood (of any source) that for long periods (sometimes {{hundreds}} of thousands of years) has been buried in peat bogs, and kept from decaying by the acidic and anaerobic bog conditions. Bog-wood usually is stained brown by tannins dissolved in the <b>acidic</b> <b>water,</b> and represents an early stage of fossilisation. The age of the track prompted large-scale excavations in 1973, funded by the Department of the Environment.|$|E
5|$|LACM 149371 (Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County {{specimen}} 149371) is {{an enigmatic}} fossil mammalian tooth from the Paleogene (66 to 23 million years ago, mya) of Peru. It {{is from the}} Santa Rosa fossil site, which is of uncertain age but possibly late Eocene (55 to 34 mya) or Oligocene (34 to 23 mya). The tooth is poorly preserved {{and may have been}} degraded by <b>acidic</b> <b>water</b> or because it passed through a predator's digestive tract. Its largest dimension is 2.65mm. It is triangular in shape and bears six cusps that surround the middle of the tooth, where there are three basins (fossae). Crests connects the cusps and separate the fossae. The microscopic structure of the enamel is poorly preserved.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{from the}} {{atmosphere}} or soil can end up in groundwater and surface water. It is also potentially in drinking water, e.g. from plumbing and fixtures that are either made of lead or have lead solder. Since <b>acidic</b> <b>water</b> breaks down lead in plumbing more readily, chemicals {{can be added to}} municipal water to increase the pH and thus reduce the corrosivity of the public water supply. Chloramines, which were adopted as a substitute for chlorine disinfectants due to fewer health concerns, increase corrositivity. In the US, 14–20% of total lead exposure is attributed to drinking water. In 2004, a team of seven reporters from The Washington Post discovered high levels of lead in the drinking water in Washington, D.C. and won an award for investigative reporting for a series of articles about this contamination. In the Flint water crisis, a switch to a more corrosive municipal water source elevated lead levels in drinking water in domestic tap water.|$|E
50|$|Silvertip tetras {{prefer a}} densely planted aquarium, {{with a dark}} substrate. They are a {{shoaling}} fish and prefer a space in the center for swimming room. The fish come from very soft and <b>acidic</b> <b>waters</b> and when these conditions are met, their colors become more vivid. They tend to occupy the middle level of the aquarium. While tank-bred silvertips have adapted well {{to a wide range}} of water conditions, in the wild they inhabit very soft, <b>acidic</b> <b>waters.</b> Silvertips have a lifespan of about three years.|$|R

5|$|Lying {{within a}} coastal plain, the St. Johns River passes through {{an area that}} was at one time barrier islands, coastal dunes, and estuary marshes. The Florida Peninsula was created {{primarily}} by forces and minerals from the ocean. It lies so low that minor fluctuations in sea levels can have a dramatic effect on its geomorphology. Florida was once part of the supercontinent Gondwana. Lying underneath the visible rock formations is a basement of igneous granite and volcanic composition under a sedimentary layer formed during the Paleozoic era 542 to 251 million years ago. During the Cretaceous period (145 to 66 million years ago), the basement and its sedimentary overlay were further covered by calcium carbonate and formations left by the evaporation of water called evaporites. What covers the peninsula {{is the result of}} simultaneous processes of deposits of sands, shells, and coral, and erosion from water and weather. As ocean water has retreated and progressed, the peninsula has been covered with sea water at least seven times. Waves compressed sands, calcium carbonate, and shells into limestone; at the ocean's edge, beach ridges were created by this depositional forming. North-south axis rivers, such as the St. Johns, were created by past beach ridges which were often divided by swales. As ocean water retreated, lagoons formed in the swales, which were further eroded by <b>acidic</b> <b>water.</b> Barrier islands, furthermore, formed along the Atlantic Coast, surrounding the lagoon with land and forming a freshwater river.|$|E

40|$|Contrasting effects {{with respect}} to toxicity, have been {{reported}} for freshwaters acidified via anthropogenic or natural means. Decreased diversity, species richness and ecosystem functioning is often reported from waterways acidified via anthropogenic means, whilst on the other hand, naturally <b>acidic</b> <b>waters</b> are reported to contain diverse and functioning ecosystems. Previously {{it has been suggested}} that dissolved organic carbon (DOC) containing high amounts of humic substances (HS) may play a role in buffering aquatic organisms in naturally <b>acidic</b> <b>waters</b> against the detrimental effects of low pH. This research used field studies to investigate the effect of decreased pH in naturally <b>acidic</b> <b>waters.</b> These were complemented by laboratory studies to investigate the ability of HS to influence the toxicity of low pH in waters of varying chemistry and whether this ability can extend to acidified streams affected by multiple stressors (low pH and heavy metal mixtures) such as those contaminated via acid mine drainage (AMD) ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe geochemical {{behaviour}} of Rare Earth Elements, Zr and Hf {{was investigated}} in the thermal waters of Nevado del Ruiz volcano system. A wide range of pH, between 1. 0 and 8. 8, characterizes these fluids. The <b>acidic</b> <b>waters</b> are sulphate dominated with different Cl/SO 4 ratios. The important role of the pH and the ionic complexes for the distribution of REE, Zr and Hf in the aqueous phase was evidenced. The pH rules the precipitation of authigenic Fe and Al oxyhydroxides producing changes in REE, Zr, Hf amounts and strong anomalies of Cerium. The precipitation of alunite and jarosite removes LREE from the solution, changing the REE distribution in <b>acidic</b> <b>waters.</b> Y–Ho and Zr–Hf (twin pairs) have a different behaviour in strong <b>acidic</b> <b>waters</b> {{with respect to the}} water with pH near-neutral. Yttrium and Ho behave as Zr and Hf in waters with pH near neutral-to-neutral, showing super-chondritic ratios. The twin pairs showed {{to be sensitive to the}} co-precipitation and/or adsorption onto the surface of authigenic particulate (Fe-, Al-oxyhydroxides), suggesting an enhanced scavenging of Ho and Hf with respect to Y and Zr, leading to superchondritic values. In <b>acidic</b> <b>waters,</b> a different behaviour of twin pairs occurs with chondritic Y/Ho ratios and sub-chondritic Zr/Hf ratios. For the first time, Zr and Hf were investigated in natural acidic fluids to understand the behaviour of these elements in extreme acidic conditions and different major anion chemistry. Zr/Hf molar ratio changes from 4. 75 to 49. 29 in water with pH < 3. 6. In strong <b>acidic</b> <b>waters</b> the fractionation of Zr and Hf was recognized as function of major anion contents (Cl and SO 4), suggesting the formation of complexes leading to sub-chondritic Zr/Hf molar ratios...|$|R

25|$|Although {{abandoned}} underground mines produce most of {{the acid}} mine drainage, some recently mined and reclaimed surface mines have produced ARD and have degraded local ground-water and surface-water resources. <b>Acidic</b> <b>water</b> produced at active mines must be neutralized to achieve pH 6-9 before discharge from a mine site to a stream is permitted.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{most ancient}} human remains, bog bodies have {{retained}} their skin and internal organs {{due to the}} unusual conditions of the surrounding area. These conditions include highly <b>acidic</b> <b>water,</b> low temperature, {{and a lack of}} oxygen, and combine to preserve but severely tan their skin. While the skin is well-preserved, the bones are generally not, due to the acid in the peat having dissolved the calcium phosphate of bone.|$|E

30|$|To avoid {{mortality}} of newly stocked fish in ponds, acclimatization {{and culture of}} the species should be done at optimal pH in order to prevent metabolic stress. According to El-Sherif and El-Feky (2009), the optimal range of water pH for rearing Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus, is between 7 and 8. However, recent data by Nobre, Lima and Magalhães (2014) suggest that the optimal range of water pH for farming Nile tilapia juveniles ranges from 5 to 8, with the species adapting and growing well in moderately <b>acidic</b> <b>waters.</b> Similarly, Rebouças et al.

25|$|Architectural copper is, however, {{susceptible}} to corrosive attack under certain conditions. Oxidizing acids, oxidizing heavy-metal salts, alkalis, sulfur and nitrogen oxides, ammonia, and some sulfur and ammonium compounds can expedite copper corrosion. Precipitation {{in areas with}} a pH less than 5.5 may corrode copper, possibly before a patina or protective oxide film has the time to form. Acidic precipitation, known as acid rain, is due to emissions from fossil fuel combustion, chemical manufacturing, or other processes that release sulfur and nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere. Erosion corrosion may occur when <b>acidic</b> <b>water</b> from a non-copper roof that does not neutralise the acidity, such as tile, slate, wood, or asphalt, falls on a small area of copper. Line corrosion can occur if the drip edge of an inert roofing material rests directly on copper. A solution to this may be to raise the lower edge of the shingles with a cant strip, or to provide a replaceable reinforcing strip between the shingles and the copper. Proper water-shedding design and detailing, which reduces the dwell time of <b>acidic</b> <b>water</b> on metal surfaces, can prevent the majority of atmospheric corrosion problems.|$|E
25|$|Hot Springs Basin {{is located}} 15 miles (24km) {{north-northeast}} of Fishing Bridge and {{has one of}} Yellowstone's largest collections of hot springs and fumaroles. The geothermal features there release large amounts of sulfur. This makes water from the springs so acidic that it has dissolved holes in the pants of people who sit on wet ground and causes mounds of sulfur three feet (1 m) high to develop around fumaroles. The very hot <b>acidic</b> <b>water</b> and steam have also created voids in the ground that are only covered by a thin crust.|$|E
