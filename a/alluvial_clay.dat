25|$|The city {{lies on the}} Deccan plateau of the Indian Peninsula and has a mean {{altitude}} of 310.5 meters above sea level. The underlying rock strata are covered with alluvial deposits resulting from the flood plain of the Kanhan River. In some places these give rise to granular sandy soil. In low-lying areas, which are poorly drained, the soil is <b>alluvial</b> <b>clay</b> with poor permeability characteristics. In {{the eastern part of}} the city, crystalline metamorphic rocks such as gneiss, schist and granites are found, while in the northern part yellowish sand stones and clays of the lower Gondwana formations are found.|$|E
25|$|The borrindo is {{a simple}} hollow clay ball with three to four {{fingering}} holes, one hole slightly larger than the other three, which are smaller and of equal size to one another. The holes are arranged in an isosceles triangular form. The borrindo {{is made out of}} soft <b>alluvial</b> <b>clay</b> available in plenty everywhere in the central Indus Valley. Being of the simplest design, it is made even by children. Some adults make fine borrindos of larger size, put pottery designs on them, and bake them. These baked borrindos, with pottery designs, are the later evolved forms of this musical instrument, which appears to have previously been used in its simple unbaked form for a long time. The sound notes are produced by blowing somewhat horizontally into the larger hole. Finger tips are placed on smaller holes to regulate the notes. Its ease of play makes it popular among children and the youth.|$|E
60|$|On the 7th of May, about eighty {{miles in}} a {{straight}} line from the foot of the Himalaya, we found the stratified sandy banks, which had gradually risen to a height of thirteen feet, replaced by the hard <b>alluvial</b> <b>clay</b> of the Gangetic valley, which underlies the sand: the stream contracted, and the features of its banks were materially improved by a jungle of tamarisk, wormwood (Artemisia), and white rose-bushes (Rosa involucrata), whilst mango trees became common, with tamarinds, banyan, and figs. Date and Caryota palms, and rattan canes, grew in the woods, and parasitic Orchids on the trees, which were covered with a climbing fern (Acrosticum scandens), so that we easily doubled our flora of the river banks before arriving at Maldah.|$|E

40|$|This is {{a report}} of theoreticl and {{experimental}} researches on the mechanical charac-teristics of Osaka Diluvial Clay. Main results obtained here are as followsThe upper yield value of Diluvial Clay can be measured as the stress corresponding tothe first inflection point of the stress-strain curve on a logarithmic scale obtained by thestress-controlled compression tests. Though the failure strength is effected by the rate ofstress-increment in stress-controlled compression tests, the upper yield value is almost indi-fferent from the rate of stress-increment. The ratio of the upper yield value of Diluvialand <b>Alluvial</b> <b>Clays</b> is almost equal to 1. 7. Applying the concept deduced from the microscopic viewpoint, a new fundamentalformula concerning the secondary consolidation and the final value of consolidation isderived {{and the results of}} tests on secondary consolidation of Diluvial Clay are explainedmicroscopically by this formula. The values of rheological constants which influence therate of settlement of clay are computed and the magnitudes of secondary consolidation ofDiluvial and <b>Alluvial</b> <b>Clays</b> are compared quantitatively...|$|R

50|$|Within Bunge Land and the {{southwest}} corner of Kotelny Island, relatively unconsolidated sediments ranging in age from Early Cretaceous to Holocene overlie the above folded and faulted sedimentary rocks. The oldest of these sediments are Early Cretaceous <b>alluvial</b> <b>clays,</b> silts, and sands that contain layers of conglomerate, tuff, tuffaceous sandstone, coal, and, at top, rhyolite. The Late Cretaceous sediments are overlain by Late Eocene to Pliocene alluvial sands that contain layers of clay, silt, gravel, brown coal, and lignitized wood. The vast majority of Bunge Land is blanketed by Early Holocene marine sediments. Only in the central and southern parts of Bunge Land do either Late to Early Pleistocene marine sediments or very small patches of highly weathered Prequaternary deposits and bedrock underlie the surface.|$|R
50|$|Guayaquil, {{the most}} {{populated}} city of Ecuador, {{is close to}} significant seismogenetic structures. The commercial center of Guayaquil is established on <b>alluvial</b> <b>clay</b> deposits interbedded with silty and clayey sand sediments, and the southwestern and southern part of Guayaquil directly lies on lands reclaimed from marshland.

50|$|With a site {{consisting}} of 25 m of reclaimed land {{on top of}} 15 m of <b>alluvial</b> <b>clay,</b> piles were designed to be 40 m long. To prevent the building sinking into the ground if an earthquake caused liquefaction of the ground, the top 10 m of the piles were designed as precast concrete piles with steel casings. In order to prevent the building from rising up due to buoyancy the piles were cast with a ground floor slab 1.6 - 2.5 m thick to provide sufficient weight.|$|E
5000|$|The key {{innovation}} {{in his work}} was the [...] "wet" [...] grinding of raw materials, which became fundamental to the early development of Portland cement. He ground the soft local chalk together with <b>alluvial</b> <b>clay</b> from the Medway estuary and added water in a washmill to produce a thin slurry from which coarse particles could be removed by settling. The fine, homogenous mixture of chalk and clay particles was dried to a stiff plastic consistency before being burned in a kiln. He thus emulated the natural process of sedimentary formation of a marl.|$|E

It covers {{the vast majority of the}} comarca of Vallès Occidental, passing through the municipalities of Sant Llorenç Savall, Castellar del Vallès, Sabadell, Barberà del Vallès, Ripollet and Montcada i Reixac. Throughout the comarca, it crosses <b>alluvial</b> <b>clay</b> terrains, which erodes easily, causing the river to carve a deep path into the soil.|$|E
50|$|Six {{thousand}} years ago Reedy Lake {{was part of a}} large marine bay. With a subsequent change in relative sea level it was cut off from the sea by a barrier of sand dunes, and its bed covered by a layer of <b>alluvial</b> <b>clay</b> deposited by the Barwon River. Before European settlement of the area in the early 19th century the lake was an ephemeral wetland that became saline in summer from the seepage of salty ground-water and occasional exceptionally high tides. In winter it usually became fresh, as river floods flushed out the saline water.|$|E
50|$|A {{free-standing}} {{bell tower}} {{seems to have}} existed until the early 15th century, further to the west. The present, leaning west tower was built in stages, and completed between 1441 and 1460. The highest stage is at a different angle to the vertical to the lower stages, as the masons attempted to correct for the subsidence of the lower stages. The {{top of the tower}} leans 1.64 m from the vertical. It is 114 ft high. The lean is popularly attributed to the foundations of the tower being built on top of wool-sacks but is most likely due to the soft <b>alluvial</b> <b>clay</b> underneath being compressed.|$|E
50|$|The Logan Cave {{area has}} a very diverse habitat which {{includes}} representatives of several Ozark Mountain types: oak-hickory forest, grassland, shrubland, floodplain, marshland, bottomland hardwood, upland deciduous, and a small prairie. The ecology of the cave {{has been described as}} the highest quality cave habitat in the entire Ozark region. A spring-fed stream, with an average water flow of 5 million gallons/day, extends {{the entire length of the}} cave. This stream, fed by small springs that emanate from the cave, once supplied water to the Logan community, a fish hatchery and 49 fish ponds. Today, the spring forms a small stream which flows into the Osage Creek, a major tributary of the Illinois River. Geological features of the cave distinctly exhibit how Ozark limestone-solution caves are formed. Many fossil marine species are present in the cave, evidence that the region was once covered by an ocean. Extensive deposits of fine <b>alluvial</b> <b>clays</b> of homogenous texture border the stream in some areas.|$|R

50|$|A {{suite of}} unconsolidated {{materials}} have been deposited during the Quaternary period and include <b>alluvial</b> <b>clays,</b> silts, sands and gravels {{on the floors}} of the many smaller watercourses within the area. The main river valleys, {{including those of the}} Avon, Beaulieu and Lymington rivers, are floored by alluvium; sand and gravel laid down in the river channels themselves and silt and clay deposited as the rivers overflow their banks during times of flood. Much the most extensive deposits are those of river terraces of which fourteen are identified at successive levels across the area of the national park. Some are referred to as the 'Plateau Gravels'. Tidal flats composed of clay and silt along the Solent coast are extensive, particularly around the mouths of the Beaulieu and Lymington rivers. Similar deposits are found around Calshot at the end of Southampton Water.Patches of head are recorded in places, most especially on the steeper ground of the valley sides in the north and west of the national park. These deposits typically reflect the underlying solid geology and derive from solifluction and slope wash.|$|R

50|$|Portland Cement is {{made from}} a mixture of chalk and clay {{containing}} alumina and silica. It was first manufactured in 1842 at Rotherhithe by William Aspdin, and the first site outside the Thames valley at which it was manufactured was on Limehouse Reach, Frindsbury. I. C. Johnson, who had previously made cement at Swanscombe, bought an oil mill at Frindsbury, and converted it to make cement, commencing on 1 May 1851. This {{became known as the}} Crown Works. Subsequently, six more cement works were built along Limehouse Reach, all using the chalk that forms the Frindsbury ridge, and <b>alluvial</b> <b>clay</b> from the Medway Estuary.|$|E
