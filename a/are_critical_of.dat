5|$|Although later sources <b>are</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> his character, {{describing}} him as vain, avaricious and power-hungry, his capabilities as {{an administrator}} are widely acknowledged. Thus Bardas founded the Magnaura School with seats for philosophy, grammar, astronomy and mathematics, supported scholars like Leo the Mathematician and promoted the missionary activities of Cyril and Methodius to Greater Moravia. He also scored {{a number of}} successes against the Arabs in the East, culminating in the decisive Battle of Lalakaon in 863, and enforced the Christianization of Bulgaria by Byzantine missionaries. The Patria of Constantinople praise him also for his building activity, but aside from a church dedicated to Saint Demetrius outside the city itself, most of the buildings attributed to him were probably the work of Basil I the Macedonian (r. 867–886).|$|E
5|$|Manning's {{books have}} {{received}} limited critical attention; as during her life, opinions are divided, particularly about her characterisation and portrayal of other cultures. Her works tend to minimise issues of gender, {{and are not}} easily classified as feminist literature. Nevertheless, recent scholarship has highlighted Manning's importance as a woman writer of war fiction and of the British Empire in decline. Her works <b>are</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> war, racism, colonialism and imperialism, and examine themes of displacement and physical and emotional alienation.|$|E

Some authors <b>were</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> how the gay rights movement was trying to achieve its goals, some <b>were</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> certain goals such as hate crime laws, and others <b>were</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> both the ends and the means.|$|R

25|$|The {{concept of}} Flow studied by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi has been {{compared}} to Buddhist meditative states such as samadhi and mindfulness. Ronald Siegel describes flow as “mindfulness while accomplishing something.” Nobo Komagata and Sachiko Komagata, however, <b>are</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> characterizing the notion of “flow” as a special case of mindfulness, noting that the connection is more complicated. Zen Buddhism has a concept called Mushin (無心, no mind) which is also similar to flow.|$|E
25|$|Trotskyism is {{the theory}} of Marxism as {{advocated}} by Leon Trotsky. Trotsky identified himself as an orthodox Marxist and Bolshevik-Leninist, and supported founding a vanguard party of the proletariat, proletarian internationalism, and a dictatorship of the proletariat based on working class self-emancipation and mass democracy. Trotskyists <b>are</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> Stalinism, as they oppose Stalin's theory of Socialism in One Country in favor of Trotsky's theory of Permanent Revolution. Trotskyists also criticize the bureaucracy that developed in the Soviet Union under Stalin.|$|E
25|$|The {{continued}} use of racial categories has been criticized. Apart from the general controversy regarding race, some argue that the {{continued use}} of racial categories {{in health care and}} as risk factors could result in increased stereotyping and discrimination in society and health services. Some of those who <b>are</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> race as a biological concept see race as socially meaningful group that is important to study epidemiologically in order to reduce disparities. For example, some racial groups are less likely than others to receive adequate treatment for osteoporosis, even after risk factors have been assessed. Since the 19th century, blacks have been thought to have thicker bones than whites have and to lose bone mass more slowly with age. In a recent study, African Americans were shown to be substantially less likely to receive prescription osteoporosis medications than Caucasians. Men were also significantly less likely to be treated compared with women. This discrepancy may be due to physicians' knowledge that, on average, African Americans are at lower risk for osteoporosis than Caucasians. It may be possible that these physicians generalize this data to high-risk African-Americans, leading them to fail to appropriately assess and manage these individuals' osteoporosis. On the other hand, some of those who <b>are</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> race as a biological concept see race as socially meaningful group that is important to study epidemiologically in order to reduce disparities.|$|E

For the latter, he used funds borrowed from his friends. These writings angered both the Spanish colonial elite and many educated Filipinos due to their symbolism. They <b>are</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> Spanish friars {{and the power of}} the Church. Rizal's friend Ferdinand Blumentritt, an Austria-Hungary-born professor and historian, wrote that the novel's characters were drawn from real life and that every episode can be repeated on any day in the Philippines.|$|E
25|$|In many {{countries}} greyhound racing is purely amateur and solely for enjoyment. In other countries, particularly Australia, Ireland, Macau, Mexico, Spain, the UK and the US, greyhound racing {{is part of}} the gambling industry and similar to horse racing – although far less profitable. Animal rights and animal welfare groups <b>are</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> the welfare of dogs in the commercial racing industry where, in some countries, dog trainers illegally use live baiting.
