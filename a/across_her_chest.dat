5|$|The sitters are {{presented}} in three-quarter view before flat, nondescript lacquer-like green backgrounds, which although lushly coloured, are thinly layered. Each has a white ground and light red imprimatura with lead content. The sitter's form and pose echo {{and in many ways}} counterbalance each other. Brand Philip draws attention to the similarities of the panels' linear construction, especially {{the manner in which the}} folds and lines of their clothing form triangular shapes. The train of Barbara's headdress <b>across</b> <b>her</b> <b>chest</b> corresponds with the opening of Albrecht's fur-lined coat. It was more usual in pendant portraits of this type for the male to be on the left-hand side; the positioning here may be an indication that Dürer originally intended his father's panel to stand alone, given that Barbara's was painted some time later.|$|E

During this time, {{she was involved in}} her first feud on SmackDown!, against Stacy Keibler, with the two confronting each other many times until Hall cheated to defeat Keibler in Keibler's final match on Velocity, one of WWE's secondary television programs. As JBL's [...] "Image Consultant", she had an important role in JBL's feud with The Boogeyman, which included The Boogeyman spitting worms <b>across</b> <b>her</b> <b>chest,</b> putting worms down her skirt and biting off her mole. She also successfully guided JBL to winning the United States Championship from Chris Benoit at WrestleMania 22 in April.|$|E
500|$|There {{have been}} other {{instances}} when Kvinneakt was {{used to make a}} statement or act as a prop. On April Fools' Day, 1982, the Portland Rainmakers gathered around the sculpture, issued a proclamation condemning nudity, [...] "even in statues, for viewing by the general public", and left the statue covered with a [...] "size 42-plus", lacy bra. In 1984 the statue was vandalized with the painted text [...] "Jesus Saves". [...] In January 1985, on the day Bud Clark took the oath of office as Mayor of Portland, Kvinneakt was draped anonymously with a sash reading [...] "Congratulations". In 2007 Tom Burkleaux, founder of New Deal Vodka, posted an image of the sculpture on the company's website with the woman's nipples airbrushed out, protesting censorship after the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau deemed the website [...] "offensive". In 2012, Century of Action, a project of the Oregon Women's History Consortium, used the sculpture to promote women's suffrage by placing a [...] "Votes for Women" [...] sash <b>across</b> <b>her</b> <b>chest</b> as part of the organization's [...] "Sash Project".|$|E

50|$|McElwee's {{brother is}} a {{successful}} doctor; {{on a visit to}} his brother's practice, Ross talks with his brother about their father's death, which took them both by surprise. Ross's brother receives a patient who has a large malignant tumor on her breast; the woman has had the tumor for years without seeking medical help. Ross's brother takes a slide of the tumor for his files; it has spread <b>across</b> much of <b>her</b> <b>chest</b> and is both multifaceted and multicolored. Ross incorporates his brother's interview with the woman—and the slide his brother takes—into his film, musing in voiceover about motivation and fatality and marvelling at the power of denial.|$|R
6000|$|Rick Voisey was a rackety, hunting fellow, and [...] "dipped" [...] the old farm {{up to its}} {{thatched}} roof. John Ford {{took his}} revenge by buying up the mortgages, foreclosing, and commanding his daughter and Voisey {{to go on living}} here rent free; this they dutifully did until they were both killed in a dog-cart accident, eight years ago. Old Ford's financial smash came a year later, and since then he's lived here with Pasiance. I fancy it's the cross in her blood that makes her so restless, and irresponsible: if she had been all a native she'd have been happy enough here, or all a stranger like John Ford himself, but the two strains struggling for mastery seem to give her no rest. You'll think this a far-fetched theory, but I believe it to be the true one. She'll stand with lips pressed together, her arms folded tight <b>across</b> <b>her</b> narrow <b>chest,</b> staring as if she could see beyond the things round her; then something catches her attention, her eyes will grow laughing, soft, or scornful all in a minute! She's eighteen, perfectly fearless in a boat, but you can't get her to mount a horse--a sore subject with her grandfather, who spends most of his day on a lean, half-bred pony, that carries him like a feather, for all his weight.|$|R

500|$|The film {{opens with}} an inter-title that reads [...] "Poor little rich girl has {{no one to}} play with" [...] and cuts to Baby Helen with her doll, looking out the window. A group of {{children}} play Ring a Ring o' Roses in the yard. Next, Baby Helen goes to tea party {{set up on the}} yard and holds her doll, all by herself, with a lonely expression. The neighbor's dog, Shep comes out of his dog house and barks, and Baby Helen rises with a joyful expression. She takes a piece of a muffin and tosses it through the boxwood hedge separating the two yards. Shep eats the muffin and Helen invites him to her tea party. Shep runs along the hedge and passes through to join her. Helen instructs Shep with her finger and Shep barks in understanding, Helen takes her seat and shares a muffin with Shep. An inter-title announces that a week later, Helen is out on an errand. Helen passes through the hedge and skips down the sidewalk and Shep barks at her. As Helen crosses the street, she is struck by a passing automobile and Shep races to the rescue. He tugs at her dress at the waist and finding that he is unable to move her, runs to Helen's home and jumps against the screen door, barking repeatedly. As Helen's parents are summoned, Shep leads them to Helen, where a passerby has scooped up Helen {{from the middle of the}} street. All three depart and the scene changes to a dimly lit room with Helen laid on a bed, seemingly dead. Her parents watch over her, with sad faces as a doctor inspects her and folds her arms <b>across</b> <b>her</b> <b>chest.</b> Beyond saving, her parents bury their heads in the pillow next to Helen as the doctor pens a note. Then Shep is shown resting against the side of the door in a feeble and sorrowful looking position.|$|E
60|$|So if Mrs. Glegg's front to-day {{was more}} fuzzy and lax than usual, {{she had a}} design under it: she {{intended}} the most pointed and cutting allusion to Mrs. Tulliver's bunches of blond curls, separated from each other by a due wave of smoothness {{on each side of}} the parting. Mrs. Tulliver had shed tears several times at sister Glegg's unkindness on the subject of these unmatronly curls, but the consciousness of looking the handsomer for them naturally administered support. Mrs. Glegg chose to wear her bonnet in the house to-day,--untied and tilted slightly, of course--a frequent practice of hers when she was on a visit, and happened to be in a severe humor: she didn't know what draughts there might be in strange houses. For the same reason she wore a small sable tippet, which reached just to her shoulders, and was very far from meeting <b>across</b> <b>her</b> well-formed <b>chest,</b> while <b>her</b> long neck was protected by a chevaux-de-frise of miscellaneous frilling. One would need to be learned in the fashions of those times to know how far in the rear of them Mrs. Glegg's slate-colored silk gown must have been; but from certain constellations of small yellow spots upon it, and a mouldy odor about it suggestive of a damp clothes-chest, it was probable that it belonged to a stratum of garments just old enough to have come recently into wear.|$|R

2500|$|... “The {{first time}} this thing ever got hit was when a young lady was driving home from the library at the University of Texas,” Sicking explains. “She was driving a small pickup truck with her cruise control set at highway speeds when she fell asleep and drifted off the road. She hit the {{guardrail}} at 65 or 70 miles per hour, and her only injury was a bruise <b>across</b> <b>her</b> <b>chest</b> caused by the seat belt. I got a very nice letter from her father describing the crash. He felt that she almost certainly would have been killed if she had hit {{one of the other}} common guardrail systems, and there is a high probability that he was right. But to hear that from a father whose daughter walked away unhurt—you live for moments like that.” ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{the revolt}} was suppressed, the British {{dismantled}} Bibighar. They raised a memorial railing & cross {{at the site}} of the well in which the bodies of the British women & children had been dumped. The inhabitants of Cawnpore were forced to pay £30,000 for the creation of the memorial; this was partially punishment for not coming to the aid of the women and children in Bibighar. The Angel of the Resurrection was created by Baron Carlo Marochetti and completed in 1865. [...] It has been called by various names throughout the centuries and came to be the most visited statue of British India. [...] The chief proponent and private funder was Charlotte, Countess Canning, wife of the first Viceroy of India, Earl Canning. [...] She approached her childhood friend, Marochetti, for models. [...] In turn, Marochetti suggested that other sculptors be invited. [...] Following the Countess's death, Earl Canning took over the commission. [...] Canning rejected a number of designs accepting, in the end, a version of Marochetti's Crimean War memorial at Scutari, Turkey. [...] The understated figure is an angel holding two branches of palm fronds <b>across</b> <b>her</b> <b>chest.</b> [...] Despite assurances, 'The Angel' had some damage during the Independence celebrations of 1947 and she was later moved from her original site over the Bibi Ghar well to a garden at the side of All Soul's Church, Kanpore (Kanpur Memorial Church).|$|E
