In December 2013, 237 and 159 cervical {{samples were collected}} from Hani and Han ethnic women, respectively, in Mojiang, a rural county in southern Yunnan. The overall HPV infection rate (21. 1 %) <b>among</b> <b>the</b> Hani <b>women</b> {{was significantly higher than}} that <b>among</b> <b>the</b> Han <b>women</b> (12. 6 %). The high-risk (HR) and low-risk (LR) HPV and single- and multiple-genotype infection rates <b>among</b> <b>the</b> Hani <b>women</b> were 11. 0 %, 4. 6 %, 15. 6 %, and 5. 5 %, respectively. HPV- 16 (3. 8 %) was the most prevalent genotype <b>among</b> <b>the</b> Hani <b>women,</b> followed by HPV- 52 (1. 7 %), HPV- 31 (0. 8 %), and HPV- 33 (0. 8 %). Comparatively, <b>the</b> Han <b>women</b> had lower infection rates of high-risk (8. 2 %), low-risk (1. 2 %), single-genotype (9. 4 %), and multiple-genotype HPV infections (3. 1 %). HPV- 16 (3. 1 %) was also <b>the</b> predominant genotype <b>among</b> <b>the</b> Han <b>women,</b> followed by HPV- 52 (1. 3 %), HPV- 33 (0. 6 %), HPV- 44 (0. 6 %), and HPV- 54 (0. 6 %). The area background, number of children, and past history of STIs were recognized as potential risk factors for HPV infection. Rural background, age, education level, number of children, and illness history were significantly associated with HPV infection <b>among</b> <b>the</b> Hani <b>women.</b> These findings highlight the urgent need for HPV prevention and control strategies in Yunnan, particularly for <b>the</b> Hani ethnic <b>women...</b>|$|R

Going into the French Open, Williams had the best clay-court record <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> and was among the favorites to win the title; however, after making the quarterfinals to extend her winning streak on the surface to 19 matches, she lost to eventual champion Anastasia Myskina.

25|$|During {{the last}} centuries of Byzantium's existence, {{the title was}} awarded to the younger sons of {{emperors}} (the eldest sons were usually crowned as co-emperors, symbasileis) {{as well as to}} the emperor's sons-in-law (gambroi). The title entailed extensive honours and privileges, including the control of large estates – the domains of Michael VIII's brother John Palaiologos for instance included the islands of Lesbos and Rhodes – to finance their extensive households. Like the junior titles of sebastokrator and Caesar however, the title of despot was strictly a courtly dignity, and was not tied to any military or administrative functions or powers. Women could not hold a noble title, but bore the titles of their husbands. Thus the spouse of a despot, the despotissa, had the right to bear the same insignia as he. <b>Among</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> of the court, the despotissai likewise took the first place after the empress.|$|E

She was the granddaughter of Alonzo Potter, a Union College vice president, and Sarah Maria Nott Potter, daughter of the school's president. Cotton was herself related to the Potter family, although the relationship was apparently a distant one. Cotton was seen to have an attractive personality and appearance.

Moreover, the incidence of such post-operative complications is greater <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> whose breasts required large-volume resection of the parenchyma; in women who were obese; in women who were tobacco smokers; and in young women. Furthermore, wound dehiscence, epidermolysis, adipose tissue necrosis, and infection occur less among women who undergo Lejour-technique breast reduction, than among women who undergo a periareolar, Anchor pattern breast-reduction, or an inferior-pedicle breast reduction. Nonetheless, bottom-edge asymmetry occurs more among Lejour-technique patients; the revision surgery rates can be up to 10 per cent. Moreover, the liposuctioning of the breast does not increase the rate of local medical complications; decreased NAC sensitivity occurs in 10 per cent of the women; and total NAC insensitivity occurs in 1.0 per cent of women.|$|E
