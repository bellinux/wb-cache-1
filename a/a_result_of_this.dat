5|$|As <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> match victory, Steinitz was {{generally}} regarded as the world's best player. The prize money for this match was £100 to the winner (Steinitz) and £20 for the loser (Anderssen). The winner's prize was a large sum {{by the standards of}} the times, equivalent to about £57,500 in 2007's money.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} {{preceding}} naval engagements around Guadalcanal, the strategic outcome was inconclusive because neither the Japanese nor United States navies secured operational {{control of the}} waters around Guadalcanal as <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> action. However, the Battle of Cape Esperance provided a significant morale boost to the U.S. Navy after the failure at the Savo Island.|$|E

5|$|Banksia aculeata {{has been}} {{reported}} as susceptible to dieback from the soil-borne water mould Phytophthora cinnamomi, but in a 2008 study this pathogen {{was found to have}} no direct impact on the species.

5|$|Between 1951 and 1960 a {{national}} service scheme had operated and {{during this time}} the CMF's numbers remained reasonably steady. However, in 1960 the scheme was suspended and the Australian Army was reorganised {{with the introduction of}} the Pentropic divisional structure. As <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> the CMF was greatly reduced and 14 infantry battalions were disbanded altogether, while many others were amalgamated into the battalions of the six sequentially numbered multi-battalion State-based regiments. As <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> on 1 July 1960, the 2nd Battalion became part of the Royal New South Wales Regiment, and was reduced to a company-sized element of the Pentropic 2nd Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment (2 RNSWR), forming 'C' Company (City of Newcastle Company). Just prior to this, on 30 April 1960, the battalion had been afforded the Freedom of the City of Newcastle.|$|E
5|$|Due to the damage, {{the name}} Ione was retired {{and will never}} be used for an Atlantic {{hurricane}} again. This was before the formal lists were created, as a result it was not replaced with any particular name.

5|$|In {{addition}} to the effect on his spiritual growth, the connection with Deguchi gave Ueshiba entry to elite political and military circles as a martial artist.

Several of these students would found their own styles of aikido.|$|E
5|$|In the ride's debut year, Busch Gardens Williamsburg {{had lower}} than {{expected}} levels of attendance. This {{was attributed to}} prolonged periods of inclement weather.

30|$|Additionally, as {{the salary}} workers {{have to pay}} more taxes {{compared}} to self-employed workers, other things equal, an inefficient incentive to allocate more resources (than socially optimal) in the self-employment activities arises. <b>As</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> individuals see how their employment choice between paid employment and self-employment is distorted in favour of the latter.|$|R

2500|$|The {{effect of}} supply {{inductance}} is {{to slow down}} the transfer process (called commutation) from one phase to the next.

50|$|Furthermore, Honest By shows {{people where}} the {{materials}} come from, {{how much they}} cost, who made the product, where it was made {{and how much money}} everybody earns along the supply chain. <b>As</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> 100% transparency, Bruno Pieters wants to make consumers aware and critical about where clothes come from and how they are produced. He also emphasises the influence consumers can have on clothing companies if they ask questions and express their demands.|$|R
5|$|The largest {{asteroid}} to {{be a true}} {{member of}} a family (as opposed to an interloper in the case of Ceres with the Gefion family) is 4 Vesta.

5|$|The route {{remained}} unchanged {{until the early}} 1960s, when several highways were renumbered. Highway19 between Woodstock and Shakespeare was redesignated as Highway59, while Highway 100 between Thamesford and St. Marys was redesignated as Highway19. The concurrencies with Highway2 and Highway7 were relocated as <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> renumbering; Highway19 became concurrent with Highway2 between Ingersoll and Thamesford, and with Highway7 between St. Marys and Stratford. While {{the length of the}} route was reduced insignificantly as <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> renumbering, it became more direct.|$|E
