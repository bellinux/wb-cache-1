500|$|Nude {{dancing at}} the club began in 1985 after a judge {{overturned}} City of Portland ordinances banning it at venues which served alcohol. A lawsuit over pasties and G-strings was brought after Portland annexed land formerly regulated by Multnomah County, which allowed tavern dancers to perform without clothing. A bar forced by the annexation to eliminate its nude dancing successfully sued the city. [...] "As soon <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> the word , we went nude," [...] said a club employee who was quoted in The Oregonian.|$|E

Executive producer Frank Spotnitz later explained that [...] "there was a pretty strong sentiment inside and outside the show {{that it was time to}} call it a day." [...] As the season progressed, however, the idea of producing another season emerged. Paul Rabwin explained that, [...] "we found ourselves starting to get energized again.

500|$|The Young Avengers series, which {{debuted in}} 2005, {{featured}} two gay teenager major characters, Hulkling and Wiccan, from its inception. The characters' sexuality was criticised by some readers and defended by the writers in an extended series of {{letters on the}} title's letters page. [...] The Young Avengers earned Marvel its first (and to date only) GLAAD Award Best Comic Book Award in 2005. Hulkling was originally planned to be a female character: According to Tom Brevoort, [...] "Originally, Allan pitched Hulkling as a female character using her shape-changing abilities to pose as a man. I suspect this {{was as close as}} Allan felt he could get to depicting an openly gay relationship in a Marvel comic. But <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> underway... he started to have second thoughts and approached me about maintaining Hulkling and Wiccan as two involved male characters." ...|$|E
500|$|Costume {{designer}} Suttirat Anne Larlarb {{says the}} real Jobs never wore his trademark turtleneck jumper {{at any of}} the launches: [...] "The turtleneck was the off book decision. In those 3 actual launches, in real life, he never wore that. In the 1998 portion of the film, in real life he was wearing a dark greyish/brownish suit. We made it for him as a back up idea in case we needed to adhere to it. <b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> closer to the time of filming, I thought we'd set up rules for 1984, we'd set up rules for 1988 – there's so much of the film that's about design and he was about design." [...] Fassbender also remarked that the historically inaccurate black turtleneck for the third act was intentional, believing that wearing the attire [...] "felt like I had arrived at [...] vision, that the person had arrived." [...] Fassbender later added that he and Danny Boyle decided on this look during filming, and wanted to [...] "give the audience kind of a payoff." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Bartley and ÓBriain {{had been}} promised [...] "exclusive access" [...] to Chávez by the government's Minister of Communications. They arrived in Venezuela in September 2001. While filming the pilot they met the president, after which they reconsidered their approach. Bartley explained, [...] "We had... this notion of {{investigating}} Chávez—was he a demagogue? Was the media persona just that? What makes him tick? My sense had changed <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> closer; what we're seeing here {{is a guy who}} is motivated, driven, not the demagogue with another side, drinking, carousing. I began to see him as more transparent—what {{you see is what you}} get." [...] Bartley and ÓBriain began by attempting to build a relationship with Chávez that would allow them the access they required. At first, the president's staff treated the filmmakers with suspicion and made filming difficult. After numerous delays, Bartley and ÓBriain finally got through to Chávez. They calculated that they needed to [...] "press the right buttons" [...] to gain his support, so they presented [...] him with an old edition of the memoirs of the general Daniel Florence O'Leary, irish who had fought alongside Simón Bolívar. Inside, they had written a quote from the Irish socialist playwright Seán O'Casey. Slowly, Bartley and ÓBriain gained their subjects' trust, [...] "dissolving any self-consciousness as a result of their cameras".|$|E

500|$|Bear McCreary {{confirmed}} {{that he would}} compose music for the series in July 2013. Unlike on some of his previous scores, ABC and Marvel allowed McCreary {{to work with a}} full symphonic orchestra, typically featuring 50 or 70 players, with over 90 for [...] "important" [...] episodes. Complex synthesizer programming was also used, to give the score [...] "a modern edge". Since Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. was the first MCU television series, McCreary felt there was [...] "a sense that it had to connect" [...] to the consistent orchestra sound of the films, but viewed through a television lens. McCreary composes on average 30 minutes of music per episode. Creating the main theme for the series, which McCreary also saw as Coulson's theme, was a process which took a lot of collaboration with the executive producers, who wanted a specific sound—"something big, that...belonged in the Marvel Cinematic Universe" [...] but also [...] "intimate because these aren't superheroes, these are regular people." [...] McCreary had to work harder to make the theme heard, given that the show does not have a traditional title sequence. By the third and fourth seasons, McCreary noted [...] "the score became a little more intense and more electronically driven... lectronics really moved to the forefront <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> into more stories about Inhumans and the digital world our characters inhabit. But the orchestra is always our foundation." ...|$|E
500|$|While filming was {{underway}} {{for the seventh}} season, {{many members of the}} crew felt that the show had entered into its final season. Executive producer Frank Spotnitz later explained, [...] "There was a pretty strong sentiment inside and outside the show {{that it was time to}} call it a day." [...] Because the show's producers felt that the show was nearing its end, many story arcs were ended in the season. The fourth episode, [...] "Millennium" [...] was written as a way to bring closure to the recently cancelled Carter-created series of the same name. The episode features Lance Henriksen reprising his role as Frank for the last time. The eleventh episode, [...] "Closure", features Mulder discovering what happened to his sister. The idea to close the story arc received mixed reactions from various production and crew members. However, many of the show's producers realized that the time had come to answer one of the show's biggest questions. Paul Rabwin noted that, [...] "It's been seven years. I don't think any of us are going to miss Samantha Mulder. That device and motivation were very strong in the early years of the show. But as the years have gone by, the speculation kind of melted away." [...] As the season progressed, however, the idea of producing another season emerged. Paul Rabwin explained that, [...] "we found ourselves starting to get energized again. [...] <b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> toward the end of the season, everyone was kind of hopeful." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The {{guy who did}} {{the artwork}} for the first record, Jacob Escobedo, {{came up with that}} concept for the artwork , and in that moment we began talking about retro-futurism: so if you were to {{go back and look at}} the science fiction books {{released}} in the fifties and just how fascinating it is to see what people thought about the future. And for us, that kind of became like a theme. Brian's got all of this ancient gear - synthesisers from the time that synthesisers were being made - and they were incredibly futuristic at that time. And then <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> more into it ... the whole aesthetic started to evolve from there." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1997, Scottish {{researcher}} James Easton {{obtained the}} original witness {{statements made by}} {{those involved in the}} first night’s sightings. One of the witnesses, Ed Cabansag, said in his statement: [...] "We figured the lights were coming from past the forest since nothing was visible when we passed through the woody forest. We would see a glowing near the beacon light, but <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> closer we found it to be a lit-up farmhouse. We got to a vantage point where we could determine that what we were chasing was only a beacon light off in the distance." [...] Another participant, John Burroughs, also stated: [...] "We could see a beacon going around so we went towards it. We followed it for about two miles [...] before we could [...] it was coming from a lighthouse." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{this first}} visit, Schieble told Jobs {{that he had}} a sister, Mona, who was not aware that she had a brother. Schieble then {{arranged}} for them to meet in New York where Mona worked. Her first impression of Jobs was that [...] "he was totally straightforward and lovely, just a normal and sweet guy." [...] Simpson and Jobs then went for a long walk {{to get to know each}} other. Jobs later told his biographer that [...] "Mona was not completely thrilled at first to have me in her life and have her mother so emotionally affectionate toward me [...] [...] [...] [...] <b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> to know each other, we became really good friends, and she is my family. I don't know what I'd do without her. I can't imagine a better sister. My adopted sister, Patty, and I were never close." ...|$|E
2500|$|The next House of Love single, [...] "I Don't Know Why I Love You", was {{released}} in November 1989 but stalled at number 41 in the charts despite being Radio 1's Single of the Week. A sixty-plus date UK tour was set {{for the end of}} the year, with an important press covering and public attention, but this would prove to be the last straw for the band's initial lineup. In 2005 Bickers recollected [...] "After our first album it was manic. A classic case of too much too soon. We needed a break... We had spent eighteen months in the studio recording our second album. Everything we produced got rejected and we were at the end of our ropes. Then as soon <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> the last track down they said 'Right, now off you go on tour'.

[...] Stitch by Stitch immediately went to #1 on the iTunes pop charts. [...] Also in 2011, Hodges and songwriting partner Steven Solomon wrote many songs together with Tristan Prettyman for her Capitol Record's album Cedar and Gold. [...] He also wrote [...] "The Woman I Love" [...] with Jason Mraz which was released on his album Love is a Four Letter Word. [...] By late 2011, Hodges was back in with Christina Perri to write for the hit Twilight film Breaking Dawn.

2500|$|In {{order to}} take {{decision}} the envoys of the Eastern Patriarchs asked the Bulgarian delegated the following question: [...] "When you took [...] Motherland, tell us under which authority {{it used to be}} and were there Latin or Greek priests?". They gave the prepared answer: [...] "We took [...] Motherland with arms from the rule of the Greeks and there we found not Latin but Greek priests." [...] In compliance with the response of the Bulgarian envoys, the Eastern Patriarchates pronounced their decision: [...] "If you have found Greek priests, it is clear that this land was under the rule of Constantinople... Therefore we adjudge, because the Bulgarian motherland, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> to know, was previously under Greek ruler and had Greek priests, to be now returned again through Christianity to the holy Church of Constantinople, from which it was separated through paganism." [...] The protests of the Roman legates were futile. They forged a letter in which the Pope allegedly warned the Patriarch of Constantinople not to interfere with the Bulgarian matters, but Ignatius ignored it. After the Council (in the very same year) the Latin priests had to leave Bulgaria and were substituted by Byzantine missionaries.|$|E
2500|$|In 1987, she {{accepted}} {{an invitation from}} Pet Shop Boys to duet with their lead singer, Neil Tennant, on the single [...] "What Have I Done to Deserve This?". Tennant cites Dusty in Memphis {{as one of his}} favourite albums, and he leapt at the suggestion of using Springfield's vocals for [...] "What Have I Done To Deserve This?". She also appeared on the promotional video. The single rose to No.2 on both the US and UK charts. It appeared on the Pet Shop Boys album Actually, and on both artists' greatest hits collections. Springfield sang lead vocals on the Richard Carpenter song [...] "Something in Your Eyes", recorded for his album, Time (October 1987). Released as a single, it became a US No.12 adult contemporary hit. Springfield recorded a duet with B. J. Thomas, [...] "As Long <b>as</b> <b>We</b> <b>Got</b> Each Other," [...] which was used as the opening theme for the US sitcom Growing Pains in season4 (1988–9). (Thomas had collaborated with Jennifer Warnes on the original version, which was neither re-recorded with Warnes nor released as a single.) It was issued as a single and reached No.7 on the Adult Contemporary Singles Chart.|$|E

And as soon <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> there, things started happening. [...] We just sat by the fire, Dan strumming, me singing, and it happened. Some of the best songs on the record, like [...] "Speak in Rounds" [...] and [...] "Half Gate", came out of that. We stayed there in isolation for two months straight." [...] Droste stated that he and Rossen decided to [...] "'try writing from the bottom up. We've never done it before.' There's {{a little bit of}} fear there because it's a new process we've never tried. We've never sat side by side and said, 'Let's literally, out of the ether, start writing songs together.' A couple of songs came that way, and that's why they're verse me, chorus Dan. [...] Suddenly the synergy hit, and the momentum struck, and then everyone got excited. And that's when the ball started to roll, and then we just started playing around, and people were much more open."" ...|$|E
