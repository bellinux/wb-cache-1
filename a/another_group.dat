25|$|Molecular {{studies have}} not {{unambiguously}} grouped them, possibly {{due to the}} paucity of key rare species such as Bentheuphausia amblyops in krill and Amphionides reynaudii in Eucarida. One study supports the monophyly of Eucarida (with basal Mysida), <b>another</b> <b>groups</b> Euphausiacea with Mysida (the Schizopoda), while yet <b>another</b> <b>groups</b> Euphausiacea with Hoplocarida.|$|R
30|$|Lack of {{completely}} smooth curves {{after the}} first eigenvalues in Figure  4 suggests that some clustering of cultures also occurs with regard to Evaluation and Potency scores. On Evaluation: a component groups Germany, Israel, Netherlands, U.S. Blacks, Yugoslavia; <b>another</b> <b>groups</b> Iran, Lebanon, New Delhi, Calcutta, Malaysia; and a third contrasts U.S. Blacks and Brazil. On Potency: a component groups Germany and the Netherlands; and <b>another</b> <b>groups</b> Yugoslavia and Lebanon. On Activity: a component groups Turkey, Iran, Calcutta, Malaysia, Mexico, Costa Rica; <b>another</b> <b>groups</b> Yugoslavia, Lebanon, New Delhi, Thailand; and a third groups U.S. Blacks, Germany, Netherlands, Israel, Brazil. A major study is needed to examine such cultural clusters and the concepts contributing to them.|$|R

5|$|After {{many years}} of {{research}} an untested HIV vaccine has been created. Bi-specific antibodies that target both the surface of T-cells and viral epitopes can prevent entry of the virus into somatic cells. <b>Another</b> <b>group</b> has utilised the same technology to develop a bi-specific antibody that neutralises viral particles by cross linking of envelope glycoproteins.|$|E
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>group</b> of {{rides in}} Olde Idlewild is located around the park's Skooters, added in 1931. Surrounding the Skooters is the Balloon Race, Paratrooper, Ferris wheel, and Spider. Below the Paratrooper {{on the north}} bank of the Loyalhanna are the Whip, built in 1938, and the Super Round Up. The Whip is closed indefinitely for repair.|$|E
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>group</b> {{was called}} Microsauria by Cope in 1868. He {{classified}} Microsauria as a subgroup of Labyrinthodontia, placing many small, amphibian-like animals within it. Among them was Dendrerpeton, once placed in Ganocephala. Dendrerpeton was later placed as a labyrinthodont with other temnospondyls, but confusion existed {{for many years}} over the classification of small amphibians.|$|E

5|$|By the mid 1950s, {{the vast}} {{majority}} of economists had ceased debating Keynesianism and accepted the synthesis view; however, room for disagreement remained. The synthesis attributed problems with market clearing to sticky prices that failed to adjust to changes in supply and demand. <b>Another</b> <b>group</b> of Keynesians focused on disequilibrium economics and tried to reconcile the concept of equilibrium with the absence of market clearing.|$|E
5|$|However, {{to finance}} these improvements, {{the company also}} {{incurred}} massive debt, and with the market price for iron remaining low, the company was sold in 1880 to <b>another</b> <b>group</b> of Portland financiers led by Simeon Gannett Reed and railroad baron Henry Villard.|$|E
5|$|In 1843, <b>another</b> <b>group</b> {{of planned}} Greek Revival townhouses was built at 160-168 Second Street. Unusual for urban houses, they {{featured}} one-and-a-half-story porticos on their front facades, with Ionic columns, and (originally) side yards. Another {{house was built}} at 170, several years later, in a similar style. They were widely imitated elsewhere in the city.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the Polish, Czech and German national orientations there was <b>another</b> <b>group</b> living in the area, the Ślązakowcy, who claimed a distinct Silesian national identity.

5|$|Indian naval crews earlier {{trained to}} operate the {{submarine}} near St Petersburg and <b>another</b> <b>group</b> of sailors was expected to arrive in Vladivostok in late 2008 for sea trials.

5|$|Leaf {{morphology}} is {{also very}} diverse in this large genus. Some leaves are very thin, almost needle-like (S. affine), while others are short, stubby, and arranged in rosettes (S. pulviniforme). <b>Another</b> <b>group</b> of species, such as S. scandens (climbing triggerplant) form scrambling, tangled mats typically propped up on aerial roots.|$|E
50|$|Two {{groups around}} the world have {{different}} beliefs about the correct name of this species.

50|$|In 1994, the Mouvement autonomiste jurassien (MAJ) {{was formed}} from {{a fusion of}} the Rassemblement jurassien (RJ) and the Unité jurassienne (UJ) <b>groups.</b> <b>Another</b> separatist <b>group</b> is Mouvement Indépendantiste Jurassien (MIJ), formed in 1990.|$|R
50|$|Another {{period of}} {{internal}} crisis beginning in 2001 {{led to a}} loss of members and a further split in 2003 when <b>another</b> <b>grouping</b> of members around former leader Ian Rintoul left to form a group known as Solidarity.

Watts {{explains}} that Black's modem has been bugged; the two argue heatedly and Black declares he is done with the Group.|$|E

5|$|ACLU {{leadership}} was divided {{on how to}} challenge the civil rights violations.

Both groups worked in tandem, but equally revered the Bill of Rights and the US Constitution.|$|E

Some of them use a cantus firmus as a unifying device; some are canonic; some use a motto which repeats throughout; some use several of these methods. The motets that use canon can be roughly divided into two groups: those in which the canon is plainly designed to be heard and appreciated as such, and <b>another</b> <b>group</b> in which a canon is present, but almost impossible to hear, and seemingly written to be appreciated by the eye, and by connoisseurs.|$|E
