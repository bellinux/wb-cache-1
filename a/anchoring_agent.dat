Hydroxybutyl chitosan (HBC), a linear polysaccharide made from shrimps and other crustacean shells, is biocompatible, nontoxic, and hydrophilic, making it ideal for biomedical applications. In this study, HBC was explored for the immobilization of anti-CD 133 antibodies. We demonstrated that CD 133 antibodies mediated by HBC were successfully coated on cobalt–chromium alloy discs and metal stents. The coating was homogeneous and smooth as shown by electronic microscopy analysis. Balloon expansion of coated stents did not cause cracking or peeling. The HBC discs promoted CD 133 þ EPCs and human umbilical vein endothelial cell growth in vitro. The CD 133 antibody-coated but not bare discs bound CD 133 þ EPCs in vitro.

Traditional localization has exploited the sig-nal runtime between “agent ” nodes {{that are to be}} localized and a set of “anchor ” nodes with known position. Recently, cooperative localization that also uses runtime measurement between agent nodes has been shown to provide superior performance. This paper analyzes the optimum power and bandwidth allocation in such systems. We first formulate the general optimization problem and show that it is non-convex. We then develop an approximate algorithm based on Taylor expansion and iterative optimization of power and bandwidth separately to find an approximate solution; simulations show that results are close to the optimum solution (which is NP-hard).
