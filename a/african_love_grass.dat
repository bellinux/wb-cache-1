These include whisky grass (Andropogon virginicus), <b>African</b> <b>love</b> <b>grass</b> (Eragrostis curvula) and Rhodes grass (Chloris gayana). The populations of foxes, feral dogs and cats, and deer, which are all introduced fauna, are annually controlled. Using coal wash waste has been banned within the park. Fire management includes reducing fuel within the park, ensuring that fences are well maintained so as to prevent arson, as well as prescribed burning. Soil erosion and sediment movement is being repaired, especially in the upland swamp region and the Hawkesbury and Maddens Plains Soil Landscape Units.

40|$|Management of {{damaging}} invasive {{plants is}} often undertaken by multiple decision makers, each managing {{only a small}} part of the invader 2 ̆ 7 s population. As weeds can move between properties and re-infest eradicated sites from unmanaged sources, the dynamics of multiple decision makers plays a significant role in weed prevalence and invasion risk at the landscape scale. We used a spatially explicit agent-based simulation to determine how individual agent behavior, in concert with weed population ecology, determined weed prevalence. We compared two invasive grass species that differ in ecology, control methods, and costs: Nassella trichotoma (serrated tussock) and Eragrostis curvula (<b>African</b> <b>love</b> <b>grass).</b> The way decision makers reacted to the benefit of management had a large effect on the extent of a weed. If benefits of weed control outweighed the costs, and either net benefit was very large or all agents were very sensitive to net benefits, then agents tended to act synchronously, reducing the pool of infested agents available to spread the weed. As N. trichotoma was more damaging than E. curvula and had more effective control methods, agents chose to manage it more often, which resulted in lower prevalence of N. trichotoma. A relatively low number of agents who were intrinsically less motivated to control weeds led to increased prevalence of both species. This was particularly apparent when long-distance dispersal meant each infested agent increased the invasion risk for a large portion of the landscape. In this case, a small proportion of land mangers reluctant to control, regardless of costs and benefits, could lead to the whole landscape being infested, even when local control stopped new infestations. Social pressure was important, but only if it was independent of weed prevalence, suggesting that early access to information, and incentives to act on that information, may be crucial in stopping a weed from infesting large areas. The response of our model to both behavioral and ecological parameters was highly nonlinear. This implies that the outcomes of weed management programs that deal with multiple land mangers could be highly variable in both space and through time...|$|E

40|$|AbstractCompanion or nursing taxa may aid the {{establishment}} of agricultural and forestry crops by improving soil N status (if legume) and soil structure, and by reducing soil erosion and suppressing weedy species. This study's objectives were to test the applicability of soybean and weeping <b>love</b> <b>grass</b> as companion plants for assisting Pinus patula establishment on former agricultural lands (oldlands), and their capacity for suppressing growth of weedy species. Two experimental trials were conducted which involved growing pine, soybean, weeping <b>love</b> <b>grass</b> {{and an assortment of}} weedy species in monocultures and mixtures in pots containing oldland and plantation soils. Pine height and stem diameter were measured at monthly intervals, with total biomass accumulation in all taxa determined 14 months after planting. In the presence of soybean, both shoot and root growth of pine seedlings were enhanced, but root growth was reduced in the presence of weeping <b>love</b> <b>grass.</b> In the presence of the weedy species assortment, pine stem diameter, height, shoot and root biomass were all decreased. In contrast, total biomass accumulation of both soybean and weeping <b>love</b> <b>grass</b> was unaffected by the presence of the weed species assortment. However, the total biomass of this assortment was reduced in the presence of these two species. It is concluded, that P. patula establishment on oldlands infested with agronomic weeds may be improved by cultivating this species together with soybean...|$|R

40|$|M. A. The {{purpose of}} this study was to add, through the lens of social and crosscultural psychology, to the much needed body of {{knowledge}} of African intimate relationships. Western romantic relationships are generally characterised by intense attraction and emotional attachment, idealisation of the other, sexual attraction and the want for total acceptance by the other. <b>African</b> <b>love</b> is less well known but seemingly tied up in culture bound collectivism as well as other social phenomenon. The study set out to explore the applicability of the lovestyle model in a Black South African population. The study explored various theories of love which have been developed within the Western canon. These include 1) evolution and love, 2) social exchange theory, 3) attachment theory, 4) love stories and 5) Lee’s lovestyles. Special emphasis was given to Lee’s colours of love theory which consists of a typology of lovestyles namely eros (passionate love), ludus (game-playing love), storge (friendship love), mania (obsessive love), pragma (practical love) and agape (altruistic <b>love).</b> In addition <b>African</b> <b>love</b> was examined from various perspectives including 1) culture; 2) individualism and collectivism; 3) the African collectivistic society; 4) acculturation and; 5) <b>African</b> <b>love.</b> This study’s main focus was on 1) the validity and reliability of the LAS instrument when applied to an African population, 2) the lovestyles of this group as mediated by their Africanness and 3) the possible gender differences. The lovestyles typology was found to be factorially valid for a Black South African population. A key and surprising finding was that individuals high in Africanness were significantly more likely to endorse eros as their dominant lovestyle than individuals low in Africanness. The study found that African men were significantly more agapic than African women and that African women were significantly more erotic and manic than African men. Males who were high in Africanness showed a significant association with eros andpragma in that the more Africanness a male had, the higher the endorsement of eros or pragma was expected to be...|$|R
