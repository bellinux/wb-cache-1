40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} the economic benefit of specific air services and the perceived cost of the carbon dioxide emissions from the <b>aircraft</b> <b>operating</b> the <b>services.</b> Initially a review is made of the basic evidence of climate change and air transport's contribution to it. This is to help put the conclusions of the study into the relevant context. As well as determining air transport's contribution to global warming, the study also considers the current and likely future taxation of air travel from the UK and the importance of air services to the World and specifically to the UK. These assessments are in macro terms. In order to obtain the necessary data to determine {{the relationship between the}} perceived cost of the CO~ produced and the economic value of the air services, research has been carried out at two UK airports - London City Airport, predominantly used by business travellers and Newquay, Cornwall Airport predominantly used by leisure travellers. Passengers were interviewed to obtain data relating to the benefit of their travel. The data was extrapolated for a full year and compared with the amount of CO~ produced by the <b>aircraft</b> <b>operating</b> the air <b>services</b> from and to the two airports in the same year. Forecasts {{of the cost of the}} cost of CO-, were used leading- to a ratio of economic benefit to CO-, cost. The results suggest a significantly greater economic value and this, plus the qualitative assessment of the value of air transport, provide evidence to question plans for increased taxation of air transport. The study then uses a further survey to assess this conclusion in the context of global warming. Consideration is given to air transport's catalytic role as an enabler for business development leading to conclusions that economic damage would result from increased taxation. This proves the research hypothesis...|$|R
