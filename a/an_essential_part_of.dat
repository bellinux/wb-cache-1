5|$|Because {{evolutionary}} naturalism proposes {{an empirical}} account of morality, {{it does not}} require morality to exist objectively; Linville considers the view that this will lead to moral scepticism or antirealism. C. S. Lewis argued that, if evolutionary naturalism is accepted, human morality cannot be described as absolute and objective because moral statements cannot be right or wrong. Despite this, Lewis argued, those who accept evolutionary naturalism still act as if objective moral truths exist, leading Lewis to reject naturalism as incoherent. As an alternative ethical theory, Lewis offered a form of divine command theory which equated God with goodness and treated goodness as <b>an</b> <b>essential</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> reality, thus asserting God's existence.|$|E
