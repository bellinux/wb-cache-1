5|$|Some {{minor changes}} in the gun {{construction}} were introduced during production. The carriage received a modified shoulder guard and traverse controls (carriage M4A1, standardized on 29 January 1942). Although ordnance requested an upgrade of all M4 carriages to M4A1, this process was not completed. Another change was a threaded barrel end to accept a big five-port muzzle brake (gun M3A1, adopted on 5 March 1942). According to some sources, the latter was intended to avoid kicking too much dust {{in front of the}} gun, which hindered aiming; however, the brake {{turned out to be a}} safety problem when firing canister ammunition and consequently the M3A1 went into combat without the muzzle brake. Other sources mention the muzzle brake was intended to soften a recoil <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> it was dropped simply because additional recoil control measures were not really needed.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fourth}} stanza, the poet visits a fruit shop. There she {{inquires}} {{about what they}} are selling. They reply, we sell lemon, pomegranate and plum. Then the musicians were asked what they play and they say sitar, sarangi and drums. The poet even comes across magicians and asks them what they are chanting <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> they are chanting magical spells to charm thousand ages to come.|$|E
25|$|And {{there are}} those who have {{determined}} not only the year of our Lord's birth, but also the day… And the followers of Basilides hold the day of his baptism as a festival, spending the night before in readings. <b>And</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> it was the fifteenth year of Tiberius Caesar, the fifteenth day of the month of Tubi; and some that it was the eleventh of the same month.|$|E

2500|$|Epiphany {{may have}} {{originated}} in the Greek-speaking {{eastern half of the}} Roman Empire as a feast to honor the baptism of Jesus. Around 200, Clement of Alexandria wrote that, [...] "But the followers of Basilides celebrate the day of His Baptism too, spending the previous night in readings. <b>And</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> it was the 15th of the month Tybi of the 15th year of Tiberius Caesar. And some say that it was observed the 11th of the same month." [...] The Egyptian dates given correspond to January 6 and 10. The Basilides were a Gnostic sect.|$|E
2500|$|The {{differences}} between Romans and Goths in Ostrogothic Ravenna were never as clearly defined {{as they were}} along religious lines. The Goths followed the Arian branch of Christianity, while the Romans practiced Orthodoxy. Both considered the other to be heretics. Theodoric, however, was the keystone in maintaining order amongst the peoples that he ruled, commanding respect and fear in equal measure from both Romans and Goths alike. Upon his taking of power the Orthodox bishops and leaders of Ravenna were allowed to keep their posts, but not had to enter into power sharing with Arian counterparts. In his Variae Cassiodorus has letters he penned for Theodoric that show his toleration as well as protection of the Orthodox Church. In one such letter Theodoric had Cassiodorus write, this time to Faustus, a Roman prefect, saying [...] "'The Defensores of the Holy Church of Milan want to be enabled to buy as cheap as possible the things which they need for the relief of the poor; <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> we have bestowed this favor on the Church of Ravenna. 'Your Magnificence will therefore allow them to single out some one merchant who shall buy {{for them in the}} market, without being subject to monopoly, siliquaticum, or the payment of gold-fee." ...|$|E
2500|$|Muawiyah I is a reviled {{figure in}} Shia Islam for several reasons. Firstly, {{because of his}} {{involvement}} in the Battle of Siffin against Ali ibn Abi Talib, whom the Shia Muslims believe was Muhammad's true successor; secondly, for the breaking of the treaty he made with Hasan ibn Ali, after the death of Hasan ibn Ali, one of broken terms being appointing his son Yazid as his successor; thirdly, because they believe that he is responsible for the killing of Hasan ibn Ali by bribing his wife Ja'dah binte Ash'as to poison him whereas the Sunni texts do not say that his wife killed him; and fourthly because some Shia think that he distorted their interpretation of Islam to match his rule; whereas the Sunnis do not say that he distorted Islam, as he was a political leader at a certain time in history to whom Hassan and Hussein also gave their allegiance, whereas they say that Islam is based on the Quran and the teaching of Muhammad and its main center of learning was in Madina not in Syria <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Islam was completed at the time of Muhammad and use the verses [...] "This day I have perfected for you your religion and completed My favor upon you and have approved for you Islam as religion" [...] Quran 5:5.
