5000|$|Poling is a {{metallurgical}} method {{employed in}} the purification of copper which contains cuprous oxide as an impurity {{and also in the}} purification of tin ("Sn") which contains tin oxide (stannic oxide or [...] "SnO2") as an impurity.

A’copper sdphate <b>ammonia</b> <b>liquid</b> filter, suitably diluted, will transmit this wave-band. A gelatin screen filter, absorbing all light below 510 mp. is used in the eyepiece.

The simplicity of the equipment enables fluorescence microscopy of tubercle bacilli to be used at low cost in any laboratory. The phenomenon of fluorescence as applied to stained bacilli may be described as follows. Certain fluorochroms (e. g. auramine) absorb light of a certain wave-length, and convert it into light energy of another wave-length.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} {{for this project}} was to, by varying the {{parameters}} temperature (400 ˚C and 500 ˚C), acid concentration (10 %, 25 % and 40 %), relative impregnation (0. 75, 1. 35 and 2. 0) and impregnation time (1 h, 2 h and 3 h), evaluate which parameters that affect the product. Also, an investigation was made to determine {{the interaction of the}} different parameters. This was done by analysing the properties of the AC with gas adsorption of gasoline and <b>ammonia.</b> <b>Liquid</b> adsorption was analysed with iodine number and the yield of the AC was calculated with two different methods. In general an increasing of the temperature and the impregnation time results in a higher iodine number and higher capacity to absorb gasoline in the produced activated carbon. When the conditions were too strong the iodine number and the capacity to absorb gasoline decreased. The pore structure of the activated carbon is destroyed by too strong conditions. The results were also analysed with a computer program to establish statistical evidence of influence from the parameters indicating that temperature has strong effect on iodine number of the produced activated carbon. If the AC from Caribbean Pine would be commercially produced the recommended design is to keep all parameters low. This is both cost effective and energy efficient. Based on the experimental results it was determined that the AC from Caribbean Pine is better suited for adsorbing gasoline compared with ammonia. Furthermore, the adsorption of gasoline is increasing with an increasing temperature. An industrial manufactured AC was compared with the AC produced from Caribbean Pine and it had a better liquid and gas adsorption showing that more research and optimization of AC from Caribbean Pine must be done before commercializing the product.
