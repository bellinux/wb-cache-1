5000|$|Latchbolt or Latch bolt An {{extremely}} common latch type, typically {{part of a}} lockset, it is a spring-loaded bolt with an <b>angled</b> <b>edge.</b> When {{the door}} is pushed closed, the <b>angled</b> <b>edge</b> of the latchbolt engages with {{the lip of the}} strike plate; a spring allows the bolt to retract. Once the door is fully closed, the bolt automatically extends into the strike plate, holding the door closed. The latchbolt is disengaged (retracted) typically when the user turns the door handle, which via the lockset's mechanism, manually retracts the latchbolt, allowing the door to open.|$|R

The slight roughness of the lines, softening the plane edges without lessening the impact of the image, saves the painting from mechanical precision.

50|$|As royal architect, Antunes' main {{work is the}} Church of Santa Engrácia (started 1682) in Lisbon, a Greek cross {{building}} with curved façades typical of the Baroque architecture of Borromini. Antunes was also responsible for the projects for the Church of Saint Elói (built after 1694, destroyed in the 1755 Lisbon earthquake) and the Church of Menino Deus (1711-1737), both in Lisbon. These churches had {{the shape of a}} rectangle with <b>angled</b> <b>edges,</b> thus assuming the shape of an irregular octagon. This floorplan scheme, possibly derived from designs by Guarino Guarini, would greatly influence other churches in Portugal and colonial Brazil. All of these churches were decorated with marble panels of Italian influence, anticipating the dominant role that Roman art would have in the Portuguese court during the 18th century.|$|E

30|$|In this paper, we {{characterized}} {{the behavior of}} polymer jet from near-field electrospinning onto the inkjet patterned paper with conductive Ag nanoparticles in order to form the controlled three-dimensional nanostructures. Using inkjet patterned paper with conductive ink as a collector, the polymer jet is induced to the pre-patterned shape through the concentrated electric field caused by singularity between the spinneret and the printed patterns. Due to the electric field enhancement of the deposited electrospun fiber, an additionally spun fiber can be stacked on the deposited fibers directly. Therefore, the controlled three-dimensional nano/micro structures can be successfully realized by the proposed method. We {{characterized the}} deposition of the electrospun fiber according to {{the distance between the}} inkjet printed pattern and the spinneret. In addition, the sharp edged three-dimensional microstructures were fabricated by carrying out the electrospinning on the patterns with various <b>angled</b> <b>edges.</b> A CCD camera was used to observe the behavior of the polymer jet, and the SEM image was analyzed to confirm that the fibers are stacked as desired.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. With the {{occurrences of}} ballast stones {{projecting}} from the track during high speed operation without snow or ice the aerodynamic {{load on the}} track induced by the train has come into focus. Within the research cooperation “Aerodynamics in Open Air ” (AOA) aimed at understanding the ballast projection phenomena one part looked at CFD simulation of the flow under the train. A generic train-underfloor wind tunnel experiment was used to validate commercially available computational approaches and particularly turbulence modeling with given limitations on mesh size such {{that at least one}} car of the train can be simulated with at the time available computer resources among the partners in the AOA project. The results presented were attained with CD-Adapco’s codes Star-CD and Star CCM+. The flow is challenging with impingement, separation and reattachment about the rounded and edgy details of the bogies followed by flow about a funnel shaped bogie cavity end with vortices about the <b>angled</b> <b>edges</b> and highly turbulent flow separation after the funnel apex interacting with the inter car gap. The Reynolds no.

50|$|The {{smaller the}} angle between the blade and stone, the sharper the knife will be, but the less side force {{is needed to}} bend the edge over or chip it off. The angle between the blade and the stone is the <b>edge</b> <b>angle</b> - the angle from the {{vertical}} {{to one of the}} knife edges, and equals the angle at which the blade is held. The total angle {{from one side to the}} other is called the included angle - on a symmetric double-ground edge (a wedge shape), the <b>angle</b> from one <b>edge</b> to the other is thus twice the <b>edge</b> <b>angle.</b> Typical <b>edge</b> <b>angles</b> are about 20° (making the included angle 40° on a double-ground <b>edge).</b> The <b>edge</b> <b>angle</b> for very sharp knives can be as little as 10 degrees (for a 20° included angle). Knives that require a tough edge (such as those that chop) may sharpen at 25° or more.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} new {{algorithm}} for rendering translucent materials that combines photon tracing with diffusion. This combination {{makes it possible}} to efficiently render highly scattering translucent materials while accounting for internal blockers, complex geometry, translucent inter-scattering, and transmission and refraction of light at the boundary causing internal caustics. These effects cannot be accounted for with previous rendering approaches using the dipole or multipole diffusion approximations that only sample the incident illumination at the surface of the material. Instead of sampling lighting at the surface we trace photons into the material and store them volumetrically at their first scattering interaction with the material. We hierarchically integrate the diffusion of light from the photons to compute the radiant emittance at points {{on the surface of the}} material. For increased accuracy we use the incidence plane of the photon and the viewpoint on the surface to blend between three analytic diffusion approximations that best describe the geometric configuration between the photon and the shading point. For this purpose we introduce a new quadpole diffusion approximation that models diffusion at right <b>angled</b> <b>edges,</b> and an attenuation kernel to more accurately model multiple scattering near a light source. The photon diffusion approach is as efficient as previous Monte Carlo sampling approaches based on the dipole or multipole diffusion approximations, and our results demonstrate that it is more accurate and capable of capturing several illumination effects previously ignored when simulating the diffusion of light in translucent materials...|$|E

40|$|This paper aims to {{describe}} the effect of tool geometry on cutting characteristics of a 1. 0 mm thickness acrylic worksheet subjected to a punch/die shearing. A set of side-wedge punch and side-wedge die which had the <b>edge</b> <b>angle</b> of 30 °, 60 ° and/or 90 ° was prepared and used for cutting off the worksheet. A load cell and a CCD camera were installed in the cutting system to investigate the cutting load resistance and the side-view deformation of the worksheet. From experimental results, {{it was revealed that}} a cracking pattern at a sheared zone was remarkably affected by the <b>edge</b> <b>angle</b> of cutting tool. A cracking direction was almost coincident to the <b>edge</b> <b>angle</b> when considering the punch/die <b>edge</b> <b>angle</b> of 30 °, while any matching of them was not observed in case of the punch/die <b>edge</b> <b>angle</b> of 60 °, 90 °. By using the 30 ° side-wedge tool, a flat-smooth sheared surface was generated. When combing the punch <b>edge</b> <b>angle</b> of 90 ° and the die <b>edge</b> <b>angle</b> of 60 °, the cracking profile was characterized by the both <b>edge</b> <b>angles</b> for each part (die and punch). Carrying out an elasto-plastic finite element method analysis of cutter indentation with a few of symmetric and asymmetric punch/die edges, the stress distribution and deformation flow at the sheared zone were discussed with the initiation of surface crack...|$|R
