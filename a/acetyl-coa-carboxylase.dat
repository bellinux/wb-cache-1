40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{influence}} of a high alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) diet (linseed diet) and a high linoleic acid (LA) diet (sunflower diet) on performances of pigs, on the dietetical quality of their tissues (adipose tissues and muscles), and on the lipogenic potential of these tissues. Growth and carcass performances, and the lipid content of the tissues were not affected by the diet. Feeding the linseed diet increased the content of n- 3 PUFA and decreased the LA/ALA ratios in all the tissues, while the sunflower diet led to an increase in the n- 6 PUFA contents. Neither the stearoyl-CoA-desaturase and glucose- 6 -phosphate-dehydrogenase activities nor the beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA-dehydrogenase activity were affected by the diet. <b>Acetyl-CoA-carboxylase</b> and fatty acid synthase activities were enhanced with the linseed diet in respectively subcutaneous adipose tissue and intermuscular adipose tissue, while malic enzyme activity was decreased in liver and subcutaneous adipose tissue of pigs fed the linseed diet.

40|$|Elimination of {{cisplatin}} resistant (CR) {{lung cancer}} cells remains a major obstacle. We {{have shown that}} CR tumors have higher reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and can be exploited for targeted therapy. Here we show that increased secretion of the antioxidant thioredoxin- 1 (TRX 1) resulted in lowered intracellular TRX 1, and contributed to higher ROS in CR tumors in vivo and in vitro. By reconstitutingTRX 1 protein in CR cells, we increased sensitivity to cisplatin but decreased sensitivity to elesclomol (ROS inducer). Conversely, decreased TRX 1 protein in parental cells reduced the sensitivity to cisplatin but increased sensitivity to elesclomol. CR cells had increased endogenous oxygen consumption and mitochondrial activity but decreased lactic acid production. They also exhibited higher levels of argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS) and fumarase (FH) mRNA which contributed to oxidative metabolism (OXMET) when compared to parental cells. Restoring intracellular TRX 1 protein in CR cells resulted in lowering ASS and FH mRNAs which in turn sensitized them to arginine deprivation. Interestingly, CR cells also possessed significantly higher basal levels of <b>acetyl-CoA-carboxylase</b> (ACC...|$|E
40|$|To study {{molecular}} {{evolution of}} plants, the plastid encoded rbcL sequences are widely used. In most plastid DNAs, an {{open reading frame}} (ORF) designated yifll can be found next to the highly conserved rbcL gene. This ORF appears to be only loosely conserved and its function {{is a matter of}} debate: On the one hand it is the only gene in plastid DNA of land plants suspected to encode a regulatory zinc finger protein. On the other hand it was postulated to encode the, 6 -subunit of an <b>acetyl-CoA-carboxylase.</b> Accordingly, this ORF has been previously described as zfpA or aceD, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis reveals evolu-tionary conservation of two yif 11 -domains from bacteria to the plastids of dicots. We show that in dicots yif 11 has gained additional sequences through insertions, whereas it has been lost from the plastid DNA in monocots. These findings may reflect physiological differences between major groups of land plants. Fur-thermore, we show that yif 11 may be a useful molecular marker in the study of plant evolution...|$|E
40|$|We have {{recently}} shown that conditions known to activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in primary beta-cells can trigger their apoptosis. The present study demonstrates {{that this is}} also the case in the MIN 6 beta-cell line, which was used to investigate the underlying mechanism. Sustained activation of AMPK was induced by culture with the adenosine analogue AICA-riboside or at low glucose concentrations. Both conditions induced a sequential activation of AMPK, c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) and caspase- 3. The effects of AMPK on JNK activation and apoptosis were demonstrated by adenoviral expression of constitutively active AMPK, a condition which reproduced the earlier-described AMPK-dependent effects on pyruvate kinase and <b>acetyl-coA-carboxylase.</b> The effects of JNK activation on apoptosis were demonstrated by the observations that (i). its inhibition by dicumarol prevented caspase- 3 activation and apoptosis, (ii). adenoviral expression of the JNK-interacting scaffold protein JIP- 1 /IB- 1 increased AICA-riboside-induced JNK activation and apoptosis. In primary beta-cells, AMPK activation was also found to activate JNK, involving primarily the JNK 2 (p 54) isoform. It is concluded that prolonged stimulation of AMPK can induce apoptosis of insulin-producing cells through an activation pathway that involves JNK, and subsequently, caspase- 3...|$|E
40|$|In {{prostate}} cancer cell lines in culture androgens cause a marked and coordinated upregulation of {{the expression of}} several lipogenic genes. Here, using castrated male Wistar rats as an experimental paradigm, we investigated whether coordinated androgen stimulation of lipogenic gene expression represents a more general physiological regulation in non-cancerous androgen-responsive cells as well. In typical target tissues for androgen action such as the ventral prostate and the lacrimal gland, androgen deprivation resulted in a marked reduction in the mRNA and protein levels of genes involved in fatty acid (fatty acid synthase and <b>acetyl-CoA-carboxylase)</b> and cholesterol synthesis (HMG-CoA-reductase and farnesyl diphosphate synthase). Readministration of testosterone immediately following orchidectomy restored the expression of all four genes. Substitution of testosterone by the non-aromatizable androgen dihydrotestosterone gave rise to comparable changes in the mRNA and protein levels of the lipogenic genes under investigation, confirming {{the involvement of the}} androgen receptor in the observed effects. In support of the coordinate nature of this regulation, androgen-induced upregulation of lipogenic gene expression is accompanied by an increase in the nuclear content of SREBP, a key lipogenic transcription factor. Taken together, these findings provide evidence for a coordinate regulation of lipogenic gene expression not only in {{prostate cancer}} cell lines in culture but also in non-cancerous androgen-responsive tissues in vivo. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDoxorubicin (DXR) is {{a widely}} used and {{efficient}} anticancer drug. However, its application {{is limited by the}} risk of severe cardiotoxicity. Impairment of cardiac high-energy phosphate homeostasis is an important manifestation of both acute and chronic DXR cardiotoxic action. Using the Langendorff model of the perfused rat heart, we characterized the acute effects of 1 -h perfusion with 2 or 20 microM DXR on two key kinases in cardiac energy metabolism, creatine kinase (CK) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and related them to functional responses of the perfused heart and structural integrity of the contractile apparatus as well as drug accumulation in cardiomyocytes. DXR-induced changes in CK were dependent on the isoenzyme, with a shift in protein levels of cytosolic isoenzymes from muscle-type CK to brain-type CK, and a destabilization of octamers of the mitochondrial isoenzyme (sarcometric mitochondrial CK) accompanied by drug accumulation in mitochondria. Interestingly, DXR rapidly reduced the protein level and phosphorylation of AMPK as well as phosphorylation of its target, <b>acetyl-CoA-carboxylase.</b> AMPK was strongly affected already at 2 microM DXR, even before substantial cardiac dysfunction occurred. Impairment of CK isoenzymes was mostly moderate but became significant at 20 microM DXR. Only at 2 microM DXR did upregulation of brain-type CK compensate for inactivation of other isoenzymes. These results suggest that an impairment of kinase systems regulating cellular energy homeostasis is involved in the development of DXR cardiotoxicity...|$|E
40|$|Modern crop {{protection}} industry puts great efforts into {{the investigation and}} development of pesticides (insecticides, acaricides) with a novel mode of action, primarily because of increasingly important problem of resistance of pest organisms to pesticides. Resistance of many pest arthropod species (insects and mites) to insecticides and/or acaricides became a global phenomenon in the last decades. Therefore, pest management heavily relies on constant introduction of novel active ingredients in use, i. e. onthe alternative use {{of a number of}} compounds with different modes of action in order to save the longevity of newly developed products. Among pest arthropods, according to the potential for resistance development and a number of documented cases, spider mites (Acari: Tetranychidae), especially species Tetranychus urticae and Panonychusulmi, as well as certain species of whiteflies and leaf aphids (Homoptra: Aleyrodidae,Aphididae) stand out. In 2002, the company Bayer CropScience introduced spirodiclofen, a tetronic acid derivative and the first cyclic ketoenol, acaricide with a wide spectrum and a novel mode of action â€“ inhibition of <b>acetyl-CoA-carboxylase.</b> Soon after, spiromesifen was introduced, also a derivative of tetronic acid, acaricide and insecticide intended for control of phytophagous mites and whiteflies. Spirotetramat, a tetramic acid derivative, and the third member of the ketoenol group, was recently commercialised as an insecticide efficient against whiteflies,leaf aphids and other harmful Homoptera. In this paper are presented the most significant properties of cyclic ketoenols, aiming at pointing to the possibilities and prospects of their use, but also to potential problems and limitations...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Spiromesifen {{is a novel}} insecticidal/acaricidal {{compound}} {{derived from}} spirocyclic tetronic acids that acts effectively against whiteflies and mites via inhibition of <b>acetyl-CoA-carboxylase,</b> a lipid metabolism enzyme. The effects of spiromesifenon thedevelopmental stages of thewhitefly Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) were studied under laboratory conditions to generate baseline action thresholds for field evaluations of the compound. RESULTS: Adult B. tabaci mortality rate after spiromesifen treatment (5 mg Lâˆ’ 1) was 40 %. Treatment with 0. 5 mg Lâˆ’ 1 reduced fecundity per female by more than 80 %, and fertility was almost nil. LC 50 for eggs was 2. 6 mg Lâˆ’ 1, and for first instar 0. 5 mg Lâˆ’ 1. Scanning electronmicroscopy revealed that eggs laid by treated adult females had an abnormally perforated chorion, and females were unable to complete oviposition. Light and fluorescent microscopy showed significantly smaller eggs following treatment, and smaller, abnormally formedand improperly localizedbacteriomes in eggs andnymphs. Thenumber of ovarioles counted in females treated with 5 mg Lâˆ’ 1 was significantly reduced. Spiromesifen showed no cross-resistance with other commonly used insecticides from different chemical groups, and resistance monitoring in Israel showed no development of field resistance to this insecticide after 1 year of use. CONCLUSION: The strong effect on juvenile stages of B. tabaciwith a uniquemode of action {{and the absence of}} cross-resistance with major commonly used insecticides from different chemical groups suggest the use of spiromesifen in pest and resistance management programmes...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} meet dietary requirements, the {{consumption}} of Î±-linolenic acid (ALA, 18 : 3 n- 3) must be promoted. However, its effects on triglyceride (TG) and cholesterol metabolism are still controversial, and may be dose-dependent. The effects of increasing dietary ALA intakes (1 %, 10 %, 20 % and 40 % of total FA) were investigated in male hamsters. ALA replaced oleic acid while linoleic and saturated FA were kept constant. Triglyceridemia decreased by 45 % in response to 10 % dietary ALA and was not affected by higher intakes. It was associated with lower hepatic total activities of <b>acetyl-CoA-carboxylase</b> (up to - 29 %) and malic enzyme (up to - 42 %), which were negatively correlated to ALA intake (r 2 = 0. 33 and r 2 = 0. 38, respectively). Adipose tissue lipogenesis was 2 - 6 fold lower than in the liver and was not affected by dietary treatment. Substitution of 10 % ALA for oleic acid increased cholesterolemia by 15 % but, as in TG, higher ALA intakes did not amplify the response. The highest ALA intake (40 %) dramatically modified the hepatobiliary metabolism of sterols: cholesterol content fell by 45 % in the liver and increased by 28 % in the faeces. Besides, faecal bile acids decreased by 61 %, and contained more hydrophobic and less secondary bile acids. Thus, replacing 10 % oleic acid by ALA is sufficient to exert a beneficial hypotriglyceridemic effect, which may be counteracted by the slight increase in cholesterolemia. Higher intakes did not modify these parameters, but a very high dose resulted in adverse effects on sterol metabolism...|$|E
40|$|The flavones {{apigenin}} (4 ', 5, 7,-trihydroxyflavone) and luteolin (3 ', 4 ', 5, 7,-tetrahydroxyflavone) are plant secondary metabolites with antioxidant, antiinflammatory, and anticancer activities. We evaluated {{their impact}} on cell signaling pathways related to insulin-resistance and type 2 diabetes. Apigenin and luteolin were identified in our U- 2 OS (human osteosarcoma) cell screening assay for micronutrients triggering rapid intracellular translocation of the forkhead box transcription factor O 1 (FOXO 1), an important mediator of insulin signal transduction. Insulin reversed the translocation of FOXO 1 as shown by live cell imaging. The impact on the expression of target genes was evaluated in HepG 2 (human hepatoma) cells. The mRNA-expression of the gluconeogenic enzymes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose- 6 -phosphatase (G 6 Pc), the lipogenic enzymes fatty-acid synthase (FASN) and <b>acetyl-CoA-carboxylase</b> (ACC) were down-regulated by both flavones with smaller effective dosages of apigenin than for luteolin. PKB/AKT-, PRAS 40 -, p 70 S 6 K-, and S 6 -phosphorylation was reduced by apigenin and luteolin but not that of the insulin-like growth factor receptor IGF- 1 R by apigenin indicating a direct inhibition of the PKB/AKT-signaling pathway distal to the IGF- 1 receptor. N-acetyl-L-cysteine did not prevent FOXO 1 nuclear translocation induced by apigenin and luteolin, suggesting that these flavones do not act via oxidative stress. The roles of FOXO 1, FOXO 3 a, AKT, sirtuin 1 (SIRT 1), and nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2) -like 2 (NRF 2), investigated by siRNA knockdown, showed differential patterns of signal pathways involved and a role of NRF 2 in the inhibition of gluconeogenic enzyme expression. We conclude that these flavones show an antidiabetic potential due to reduction of gluconeogenic and lipogenic capacity despite inhibition of the PKB/AKT pathway which justifies detailed investigation in vivo...|$|E
40|$|Metabolic and {{endocrine}} {{adaptations to}} support milk production {{during the transition}} period vary between individual cows. This variation between cows to adapt to lactation may have a genetic basis. The present field study was carried out to determine hepatic adaptations occurring from late pregnancy through early lactation by measuring mRNA abundance of candidate genes in dairy cows on-farm. Additionally, the objective was to observe the diversity in inter-individual variation for the candidate genes that may give indications where individual adaptations at a molecular level can be found. This study was carried out on-farm including 232 dairy cows (parity > 3) from 64 farms in Switzerland. Blood and liver samples were collected on d 20 +/- 7 before parturition, on d 24 +/- 2, and on d 89 +/- 4 after parturition. Blood plasma was assayed for concentrations of glucose, nonesterified fatty acids, beta-hydroxybutyrate, cholesterol, triglycerides, urea, albumin, protein, insulin, insulin-like growth factor- 1, leptin, 3, 5, 3 '-triiodothyronine, and thyroxine. Liver samples were obtained {{at the same time}} points and were measured for mRNA abundance of 26 candidate genes encoding enzymes and nuclear receptors involved in gluconeogenesis, fatty acid beta-oxidation, fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis, ketogenesis, citric acid cycle, cholesterol synthesis, and the urea cycle. The cows in the present study experienced a marked metabolic load in early lactation, as presented by changes in plasma metabolites and hormones, and responded accordingly with upregulation and downregulation of almost all candidate genes involved in metabolic processes in the liver. The observed inter-individual variation for the candidate genes, which was highest for <b>acetyl-CoA-carboxylase</b> and glycerol- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase 2, should be further investigated to unravel the regulation at molecular level for optimal adaptive performance in dairy cows...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} our study was to {{investigate}} the effects of high doses of ALA provided by linseed oil (containing 50 % ALA) on its own bioavailability and that of its derivatives as well as on lipid metabolism. We investigated in male hamsters the dose/response effects of ALA over a broad range of supply as linseed oil (1, 10, 20 and 41 % of total fatty acids, FA, or 0. 4, 3. 6, 6. 7 and 14. 6 % of total energy intake). ALA was substituted for oleic acid in order to keep constant linoleic acid (LA) and saturated fatty acids which could interfere with the metabolism of n- 3 PUFA and lipids, respectively. The capacity of ALA absorption, transport, storage and conversion into EPA had no limitation over the chosen range of dietary intake. However, dietary ALA failed to increase DHA content in plasma phospholipids. In parallel to the increase in EPA, arachidonic acid content decreased, resulting in an improved balance of 20 carbons FA. Moreover, in our atherogenic conditions, triglyceridemia decreased by 45 % in response to 10 % dietary ALA and was not affected by higher intakes. It was associated with lower hepatic activities of <b>acetyl-CoA-carboxylase</b> (up to â€“ 29 %) and malic enzyme (up to â€“ 42 %), which were negatively correlated to ALA intake (r 2 = 0. 33 and r 2 = 0. 38, respectively). Substitution of 10 % ALA for oleic acid increased cholesterolemia by 15 % but, as in TG, higher ALA intakes did not amplify the response. The highest ALA intake (40 %) modified dramatically hepatobiliary metabolism of sterols. Thus, replacing 10 % oleic acid by ALA is sufficient to improve its bioavailability and that of EPA, and to exert a beneficial hypotriglyceridemic effect, that may be counteracted by the slight increase in cholesterolemia. Higher intakes did not modify these parameters, but a very high dose resulted in adverse effects on sterol metabolism and does not seem appropriate for humans...|$|E
40|$|Poster Session 25 : {{abstract}} no. 1591 Esophageal {{cancer is}} the eighth most common cancer worldwide and the sixth {{most common cause of}} cancer-related death. The prognosis for advanced esophageal cancer is very poor due to the limitations of surgery and emergence of chemoresistance. Identification of non-toxic, naturally occurring anticancer agents which may be used in combination with conventional chemotherapeutic drugs may help improve patient survival. Silibinin, a flavonoid isolated from the milk thistle, Silybum marianum, had been shown to have anticancer effects on several types of cancer cells. However, its effect on esophageal cancer has not been reported. Furthermore, although silibinin is known to downregulate the expression of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in cancer cells, {{little is known about the}} upstream signaling events targeted by silibinin. In this study, we investigated the effects of silibinin, alone and in combination with chemotherapy drugs, on human esophageal squamous carcinoma (ESCC) cells in vitro and on ESCC tumor xenografts in nude mice, and explored novel signaling pathways targeted by silibinin. We found that silibinin inhibited cell proliferation, colony-formation, and anchorage-independent growth of ESCC cells. The effects were attributed to silibinin-induced G 2 /M phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Wound healing assay and invasion chamber assay showed that silibinin had suppressive effect on the migration and invasion ability of esophageal cancer cells. Western blot analysis showed that silibinin increased the expression of phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (p-AMPK) and decreased the phosphorylation of its downstream targets, mTOR and <b>acetyl-CoA-carboxylase</b> (ACC). The anti-proliferation and anti-invasion effects of silibinin on ESCC cells were abolished by treatment with the AMPK inhibitor, compound C. In addition, silibinin increased the sensitivity of esophageal cancer cells to the traditional chemotherapeutic drugs 5 -fluorouracil and cisplatin in vitro. In vivo, orally administered silibinin significantly inhibited the growth of ESCC tumor xenografts in immunodeficient mice, and exerted synergistic effects with chemotherapy drugs. In summary, our data demonstrate that silibinin has suppressive effects on ESCC cells, and that these effects may be mediated through the AMPK/mTOR pathway. Silibinin may be a potentially useful drug in the treatment of esophageal cancer. link_to_OA_fulltextThe 102 nd Annual Meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR 2011), Orlando, FL., 2 - 6 April 2011.

The effects of co-culture with bovine oviduct epithelial cell (Boec) monolayers, serum supplementation and embryo development in the ewe oviduct, on gene expression were also examined. Experiments 1 and 2 a lower d 7 embryo survival was found with 100 mu M C 22 6 and 100 mu M C 18 2 supplementation compared to 1 mu M C 22. 6 and 100 mu M beta-ME supplementation (P < 0 05) C 18 3 supplementation had no effect on cl 7 embryo survival, but 100 mu M C 18. 3 increased d 8 embryo survival compared to 100 mu M beta-ME supplementation (P < 0 05) Experiments 3 and 4 stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD 1) and sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1 (SREBP 1) mRNA decreased after 10 mu M C 22. 6 supplementation compared to all other supplementations (P < 0 05) A lower fatty acid desaturase 2 (FADS 2) transcript level was found with 100 mu M C 18 : 2. 10 mu M C 22 : 6 and 10 mu M C 18 : 3 supplementations compared to groups without fatty acid supplementation (P < 0. 05). <b>Acetyl-CoA-carboxylase</b> (ACC), fatty acid synthase (FAS), adipose differentiation-related protein (ADRP). acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 1 (ACSL 1), diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 1 (DGAT 1), carnitin palmitoyltransferase-II (CPT-II) mRNAs expression and AMPKa phosphorylation were not modified with PUFA supplementation Experiment 5.

40|$|A central goal in {{metabolic}} {{engineering is}} {{the design of}} more productive biological systems by genetically modifying metabolic pathways. In this thesis we report such an optimization in the bacterial strain Corynebacterium glutamicum that is employed for the fermentative production of various amino acids such as lysine. The main goal of the research presented here was the application of metabolic and genetic engineering tools in order to investigate {{the role of the}} pyruvate node in cellular physiology. This was achieved by integrating the tools of bioinformatics, recombinant DNA technology, enzymology and classical bioengineering in the context of control and genetically engineered strains of C. glutamicum. First, the main anaplerotic pathway responsible for replenishing oxaloacetate, namely pyruvate carboxylase was targeted. After fruitless attempts to establish an in vitro enzymatic activity for this enzyme, our efforts were directed towards its gene identification. This was achieved by designing PCR primers corresponding to homologous regions among pyruvate carboxylases from other organisms. Utilizing these primers, a PCR fragment was isolated corresponding to part of the gene of the C. glutamicum pyruvate carboxylase. The sequence of the complete gene was finally obtained by screening a C. glutamicum cosmid library. In order to investigate the physiological effect that this enzyme has on lysine production, recombinant strains and deletion mutants were generated. The presence of the gene of pyruvate carboxylase in a multicopy plasmid is not sufficient to yield a significant overexpresssion of this enzyme in C. glutamicum. Contrary to our expectations, overexpression of pyruvate carboxylase has a negative effect on lysine production but improves significantly the growth properties of C. glutamicum. A metabolic model was developed according to which pyruvate carboxylase overexpression increases the carbon flux that enters the TCA cycle, thus the higher growth. However due to the presence of a rate-limiting step in the lysine biosynthesis pathway this increased carbon flux does not translate into higher lysine production. The role of aspartokinase, the first step in lysine biosynthesis, was explored as such a potential bottleneck. Its overexpression proves {{to increase the amount of}} lysine produced, however it leads to a lower growth and finally a lower productivity. Since pyruvate carboxylase and aspartokinase have opposite effects on cell physiology, the combination of the overexpression of these two enzymes was finally studied. By this simultaneous overexpression, we achieved to create a C. glutamicum recombinant strain with similar growth as that of the control but higher lysine production and productivity. In the context of exploring the physiological role of pyruvate carboxylase, a biotinylated enzyme, two other enzyme that utilize biotin were also investigated namely <b>acetyl-CoA-carboxylase</b> and biotin ligase. The first enzyme was purified to completion and its N-terminal as well internal amino acid sequences were obtained. A cosmid from the C. glutamicum cosmid library was identified that most likely contains the gene of the latter enzyme. In summary, in the present work we have achieved to prove unequivocally the presence of pyruvate carboxylase in C. glutamicum. We have also achieved to characterize the second biotinylated enzyme in this organism, namely acetyl-CoAcarboxylase. The physiological effect of both pyruvate carboxylase and aspartokinase was established and a metabolic model was developed based on these experimental results. This model finally led us to the construction of a new recombinant strain with improved lysine productivity. As such, this work stands as one of the few examples of a primary metabolite production improvement using metabolic engineering techniques. by Mattheos A. G. Kofas. Thesis (Ph. D.)
