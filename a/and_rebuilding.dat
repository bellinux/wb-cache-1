Its writ has never extended much beyond Baidoa. Its control of Mogadishu is ever more contested, and it is largely under siege {{in the rest of}} the country.

A small monument to the London Necropolis Railway, consisting of a short length of railway track on the former trackbed, was erected in 2007 outside the southern (cemetery-side) entrance to the station.|$|E

5|$|Built {{predominantly}} of Old Red Sandstone, {{the bridge}} {{was the subject of}} significant reconstruction <b>and</b> <b>rebuilding</b> in the 18th and 19th centuries. In those centuries, it also became a popular subject for artists; Turner, Gastineau and Cotman produced sketches of the bridge and gate. In the 20th century, it suffered increasing damage as higher volumes of traffic and the use of ever-larger vehicles led to several serious accidents. In the 21st century, {{the construction of a new}} road crossing to the south enabled the pedestrianisation of the bridge.|$|E
5|$|By {{this time}} {{construction}} of the MR extension from London to Aylesbury was underway, and on 1 July 1891 the MR absorbed the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway. Sir Harry Verney died on 12 February 1894, and on 31 March 1894 the MR took over services on the A from the GWR. On 1 July 1894 the MR extension to Aylesbury was completed, giving the MR a unified route from London to Verney Junction. The MR embarked on upgrading <b>and</b> <b>rebuilding</b> stations along the line.|$|E
5|$|Following the Union {{victory in}} 1865, three {{amendments}} {{were added to}} the U.S. Constitution: the Thirteenth Amendment prohibited slavery, the Fourteenth Amendment provided citizenship to the nearly four million African Americans who had been slaves, and the Fifteenth Amendment ensured that they had the right to vote. The war and its resolution led to a substantial increase in federal power aimed at reintegrating <b>and</b> <b>rebuilding</b> the Southern states while ensuring the rights of the newly freed slaves.|$|E

5|$|From the mid-twentieth century, public {{architecture}} {{became more}} utilitarian, {{as part of}} the impulse to produce a comprehensive welfare state and the influence of modernism. The main thrust of post-war planning was in clearance <b>and</b> <b>rebuilding.</b> The process began in Paisley, where from 1955 the populations of districts were decanted, the buildings demolished <b>and</b> <b>rebuilding</b> began. The result in the first district, George Street/ Canal Street, were low flats built in render and reused rubble around landscaped courtyards, with a 15-storey tower at one end. As the post-war desire for urban regeneration gained momentum it would focus on the tower block, championed in Glasgow by David Gibson, convener of the city housing committee. Projects like the brutalist Red Road Flats (1964–69) originally offered hope of a new beginning and an escape from the overcrowded nineteenth-century tenements of the city, but lacked a sufficient infrastructure and soon deteriorated. They also made extensive use of asbestos as a fire retardant, leading to long term health problems for builders and residents. Robert Matthew (1906–75) and Basil Spence (1907–76) were responsible for redeveloping the Gorbals in Glasgow.|$|E
5|$|In August 2011, {{militant group}} al Shabaab made a {{strategic}} withdrawal from Mogadishu {{to return to}} hit-and-run tactics. Mayor Mohamed Nur recognized the opportunity as critical to stabilizing <b>and</b> <b>rebuilding</b> the city by any means necessary. Working closely with the UN, USAID, and DRC, Nur's administration also started large-scale rehabilitation of roads and general infrastructure, with residents closely cooperating with the civil and police authorities to tighten up on security. Nur recognized the opportunity to transform Mogadishu although resources were limited. Working closely with urban strategist Mitchell Sipus, the Benadir government sought to design and deploy a data-driven approach to post-war reconstruction.|$|E

The agreement would include training soldiers <b>and</b> <b>rebuilding</b> the Somali army. In November 2014, the Federal Parliament approved a new defense and cooperation treaty with Italy, which the Ministry of Defence had signed earlier in the year.

5|$|On July 11, 2011, Harper was honoured by Alberta's Blood tribe.

Harper issued this apology in 2008.

5|$|Rebuilding work did {{not begin}} in earnest until 1863, when William Gibbs had the {{property}} substantially remodelled in a Gothic Revival style. William Cubitt & Co. were the builders and John Norton was the architect. Norton's design enveloped the original house. He added an extra floor, two new wings and towers. Norton emphasised the importance of architectural continuity in restoration <b>and</b> <b>rebuilding</b> relating to several historical periods. As a result, while some walls remained plain, others were adorned with Gothic and naturalistic carvings {{to fit in with}} the previous architectural styles.|$|E
5|$|Richard, Edward II's second son, took {{possession}} of Lydford Castle in 1239 as the Earl of Cornwall. Richard took a close {{interest in developing}} the town of Lydford, creating an additional market and introducing a new fair in the 1260s. Around this time, the main tower at Lydford Castle was demolished and rebuilt, probably by Richard, possibly following a serious fire in the building. Richard was a wealthy politician <b>and</b> <b>rebuilding</b> the castle in this way would have provided him with an important status symbol in the region.|$|E
5|$|The {{lighthouse}} {{was established}} following {{an increase in}} traffic through the northern entrance to Moreton Bay in the 1840s. It was designed by Edmund Blacket in 1854 and established in 1857. Over the years the light source went through several changes, from oil wick, to kerosene, to acetylene gas, to electricity, and finally to solar power. The structures also went through various modifications, the major one being {{an increase in the}} lighthouse height <b>and</b> <b>rebuilding</b> of several structures, in 1928–1930.|$|E

Robert Matthew (1906–75) and Basil Spence (1907–76) were responsible for redeveloping the Gorbals in Glasgow, for demolitions at the University of Edinburgh and the stark rebuilding typified by the David Hume Tower (1960–63). The new confidence of this period can also be seen in infrastructure projects, of which the Forth Road Bridge (opened 1962) was a key example.|$|E
5|$|With the {{collapse}} of the federation, Welensky moved to Salisbury, Rhodesia (renamed from Southern Rhodesia after Northern Rhodesia gained independence as Zambia). After a short break, he was invited to lead the UFP in Rhodesia, which had recently renamed itself the Rhodesia Party.

5|$|Bridgwater was {{selected}} as the first town in the South West, outside Bristol, to be selected for the UK government's Building Schools for the Future (BSF) initiative, which aimed to rebuild and renew nearly every secondary school in England. Within Bridgwater, BSF was to redevelop all of the four secondary schools and two special provision schools at an expected cost of around £100 million. This included the complete relocation <b>and</b> <b>rebuilding</b> of a new school combining the both Haygrove and Penrose School. In July 2010, several components of the Bridgwater BSF programme were cancelled and others were singled out for further review. Following a meeting with Education Secretary Michael Gove, Bridgwater MP Ian Liddell-Granger announced that the fate of all six affected schools would be subject to review, including the ones that were cancelled.|$|E
