5|$|The second chapter {{examines}} the community's {{conceptions of the}} otherworld, explaining how they approach it through acts of visualisation and altered states of consciousness and their understandings of it as <b>a</b> <b>realm</b> <b>of</b> spiritual energy connected to dreams and the imagination. Discussing the relationship between anthropology and magic, Greenwood argues {{that it is impossible}} for anthropologists to truly understand beliefs regarding magic and the otherworld if they only view it through a western rationalist lens, instead arguing for a phenomenological or relativist perspective that accepts alternative views of the world.|$|E
5|$|In Norse mythology, Hel is a {{being who}} presides over <b>a</b> <b>realm</b> <b>of</b> the same name, where she {{receives}} {{a portion of}} the dead. Hel is attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. In addition, she is mentioned in poems recorded in Heimskringla and Egils saga that date from the 9th and 10th centuries, respectively. An episode in the Latin work Gesta Danorum, written in the 12th century by Saxo Grammaticus, is generally considered to refer to Hel, and Hel may appear on various Migration Period bracteates.|$|E

25|$|The long poem {{has been}} {{considered}} a problematic genre for women writers. Its roots in epic make the genre appear to be non-inclusive of female writers. This {{is due to the}} epic's long history of being primarily <b>a</b> <b>realm</b> <b>of</b> writing for men.|$|E
25|$|There was a {{chasm between}} the official, {{communist}} culture and genuine culture. On the one hand, against the authorities intentions, the outstanding works {{were perceived as}} <b>a</b> <b>realm</b> <b>of</b> moral truths and the significant representatives of genuine cultural achievement were held in very high esteem by the public opinion. On the other hand, the slogans disseminated nationwide through the forms of official culture helped spread simplistic views, which were relatively successful among some ranks of the population.

500|$|The series {{takes place}} in a fictional {{universe}} consisting of eighteen surviving realms which, according to in-game backstories, were created by the Elder Gods. The Mortal Kombat: Deception manual described six of the realms as: [...] "Earthrealm, home to such legendary heroes as Liu Kang, Kung Lao, Sonya Blade, Johnny Cage, and Jax, and also under the protection of the Thunder God Raiden; Netherrealm, the fiery depths of which are inhospitable to all but the most vile, <b>a</b> <b>realm</b> <b>of</b> demons and shadowy warriors such as Quan Chi and Noob Saibot; Outworld, <b>a</b> <b>realm</b> <b>of</b> constant strife which Emperor Shao Kahn claims as his own; Seido, the Realm of Order, whose inhabitants prize structure and order above all else; the Realm of Chaos, whose inhabitants do not abide by any rules whatsoever, and where constant turmoil and change are worshipped; and Edenia, which is known for its beauty, artistic expression, and the longevity of its inhabitants." [...] The Elder Gods decreed that the denizens of one realm could only conquer another realm by defeating the defending realm's greatest warriors in ten consecutive Mortal Kombat tournaments.|$|E

500|$|In the Poetic Edda, Prose Edda, and Heimskringla, Hel is {{referred}} to as a daughter of Loki, and to [...] "go to Hel" [...] is to die. In the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning, Hel is described as having been appointed by the god Odin as ruler of <b>a</b> <b>realm</b> <b>of</b> the same name, located in Niflheim. In the same source, her appearance is described as half blue and half flesh-coloured and further as having a gloomy, downcast appearance. The Prose Edda details that Hel rules over vast mansions with many servants in her underworld realm and {{plays a key role in}} the attempted resurrection of the god Baldr.|$|E
500|$|The book {{explores the}} themes of exile, survival, heroism, leadership, {{political}} responsibility, and the [...] "making of a hero and a community". Joan Bridgman's analysis of Adams's works in The Contemporary Review identifies the community and hero motifs: [...] "he hero's journey into <b>a</b> <b>realm</b> <b>of</b> terrors to bring back some boon to save himself and his people" [...] is a powerful element in Adams's tale. This theme derives from the author's exposure to the works of mythologist Joseph Campbell, especially his study of comparative mythology, The Hero with a Thousand Faces (1949), and in particular, Campbell's [...] "monomyth" [...] theory, also based on Carl Jung's view of the unconscious mind, that [...] "all the stories {{in the world are}} really one story." ...|$|E
500|$|The novella {{explores the}} {{isolation}} {{brought on by}} space travel, as well as themes of religion and utopia. It contains elements of ecocriticism, or {{a critique of the}} idea that human beings are altogether separate from their natural environment. The novella and the collections it was published in received high praise from commentators. For its generation ship setting and examination of utopia, critics compared it to other Le Guin works such as [...] "Newton's Sleep", and The Telling, {{as well as to the}} works of Gene Wolfe and Molly Gloss. Scholar Max Haiven described the novella as [...] "a chastening lesson in both the potential and the perils of freedom", while author Margaret Atwood said that it [...] "shows us our own natural world as a freshly discovered Paradise Regained, <b>a</b> <b>realm</b> <b>of</b> wonder".|$|E

500|$|Author and {{literary}} critic Margaret Atwood, reviewing the volume for New York Books, wrote that [...] "Paradises Lost" [...] {{was a part}} of the [...] "note of renewal" [...] in Birthday of the World. Atwood stated that she found a [...] "release from claustrophobia" [...] in the fact that Le Guin offered a choice between a version of [...] "heaven" [...] on board the ship and life on a [...] "dirtball", but took the side of the dirtball. According to Atwood, in doing so, [...] "Paradises Lost" [...] "shows us our own natural world as a freshly discovered Paradise Regained, <b>a</b> <b>realm</b> <b>of</b> wonder". The novella and the collection end with Hsing and Luis dancing in celebration of [...] "the ordinary dirt that sustains them after they have left the ship," [...] an ending Atwood praised as [...] "minimalist." [...] A review in The Washington Post was more critical, saying that while the story had many [...] "sharp observations and lovely moments", the cult of Bliss did not [...] "possess any imaginative reality". It commented: [...] "Too tidily categorical, the story undermines only its own straw men." ...|$|E
500|$|According to McIlwain, {{the episode}} {{represents}} the series' ultimate [...] "coalescence of science, religion, and metaphysics". It {{is one of}} the few episodes in which Scully sets aside her empirical reasoning to save Mulder's life. Scully, representing the more rational one [...] "who must anchor herself in the certainty of scientific facts", discovers the alien shards and deduces that they hold the key to [...] "every question that has ever been asked". Mulder, on the other hand, represents the one who [...] "seeks the truth among <b>a</b> <b>realm</b> <b>of</b> possibilities too fantastic and beyond the realm of scientific validity" [...] and possesses the needed tool—his immunity—to solve the puzzle. The episode also explores the moral side of The Smoking Man and his affinity for evil. Kenneth Silber of Space.com notes that The Smoking Man's [...] "enticing blandishments confirm he is a highly dangerous foe, one whose Machiavellian creativity borders on the Satanic." [...] Timothy Dunn and Joseph J. Foy note in [...] "Moral Musings on a Cigarette Smoking Man" [...] that The Smoking Man's evil deeds have little to do with his mission in the Syndicate, instead reflecting his desire for [...] "completely gratuitous" [...] evil. The two cite his line [...] "Aren't you expecting me to sprout vampire fangs?" [...] as evidence that The Smoking Man is aware of his crimes but casually shrugs them off.|$|E
500|$|Watch the Throne {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 76, based on 42 reviews. Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club wrote that [...] "exhilarating messiness and go-for-broke spontaneity infect Jay-Z and push him outside his comfort zone and into <b>a</b> <b>realm</b> <b>of</b> intense emotional reflection." [...] Pitchforks Tom Breihan {{felt that it}} [...] "works best when Jay and Kanye are just talking about how great they are," [...] adding that [...] "Kanye is this album's obvious guiding force ... He displays levels of unequaled audacity." [...] Claire Suddath of Time called it [...] "a beautifully decadent album by two of hip-hop's finest artists—men {{with a lot of}} things to say and a lot of money to spend." [...] Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph praised West's [...] "attention to detail" [...] and found their [...] "wit and absurdity [...] entirely suited to the epic scale of productions." [...] Kitty Empire of The Observer stated, [...] "Some find this sort of branded gloating distasteful, but at their best both rappers can still make you laugh." [...] Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times deemed it [...] "a cocksure, fiery, smart, if problematic, collaboration that showcases the pair's distinct lyrical skills." [...] Julian Benbow of The Boston Globe observed [...] "an undeniable synergy that they embraced for this project." [...] AllMusic editor Andy Kellman called it [...] "an audacious spectacle of vacuous pomposity as well as one of tremendous lyrical depth." ...|$|E
