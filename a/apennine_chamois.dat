40|$|AbstractHuman granulocytic {{anaplasmosis}} (HGA) is {{an emerging}} tick-borne zoonosis worldwide. As {{is the case}} for many tick-borne diseases, the epidemiological cycle is associated to the environmental conditions, including the presence of wild vertebrate reservoir hosts, vectors, climate and vegetation. In this study a total number of 87 spleen samples of wild ruminants carcasses from Central Italy, and 77 Ixodes ricinus collected from the same dead animals were screened for Anaplasma phagocytophilum by using Real Time PCR. A. phagocytophilum DNA was detected in 75 %, 66. 7 % and 54. 2 % of the spleen samples from red deer (Cervus elaphus), <b>Apennine</b> <b>chamois</b> (Rupicapra pyrenaica ornata) and roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) respectively, whereas it was detected in the 31. 2 % of I. ricinus. A total of 27 positive samples were characterized by sequencing a portion of the groEL gene. Two A. phagocytophilum lineages could clearly be delineated from the phylogenetic tree. Four sequences from red deer, 2 from I. ricinus and 1 from <b>Apennine</b> <b>chamois</b> clustered into lineage I together with those previously described as virulent genotypes related to HGA. The presence of A. phagocytophilum DNA in the <b>Apennine</b> <b>chamois</b> represents the first report for this Italian endemic subspecies...|$|E
40|$|Invasion of {{the tall}} grass Brachypodium genuense was {{observed}} {{in an area of}} the central Apennines (Italy) where the population size of <b>Apennine</b> <b>chamois</b> (Rupicapra pyrenaica ornata) was in strong decline. Since this dominant tall grass threatens biodiversity and forage quality, our hypothesis was that B. genuense abundance inﬂuenced that of palatable species for the chamois, depending on their functional traits and distribution patterns. Our sampling design used plots of 10 9 10 m and 1 9 1 m to investigate the plant community level and ﬁnescale interactions. We analyzed data using correlation, generalized linear models, and redundancy analyses. We found that B. genuense can reach high abundance values on the deepest soils. Its high cover value inﬂuences plant community composition by competitive exclusion of subordinate species and suppression of functional features because of temporal or spatial niche overlap. This leads to low cover of palatable species at a ﬁne scale, and to poor pasture quality for chamois at a wider scale. Therefore, we postulated that B. genuense invasion, enhanced by longterm grazing cessation, may reduce the availability of palatable plants for <b>Apennine</b> <b>chamois,</b> especially below the potential timberline (1900 – 2000 m a. s. l.). The high abundance of B. genuense may amplify the effect of other negative factors, such as competition with red deer (Cervus elaphus) and climate change, in restricting the suitable habitat of the <b>Apennine</b> <b>chamois</b> to the higher sectors of the central Apennines. Thus, we suggested that B. genuense spread should be monitored carefully and plans to control its invasion should be implemented...|$|E
40|$|Sixteen <b>Apennine</b> <b>chamois</b> Rupicapra pyrenaica ornata (10 females, 6 males) were {{released}} into a protected area, the Sibillini Mountains National Park, Central Apennines, Italy, and monitored using {{global positioning system}} radio tags during 2008 – 2010. Founders caught in the wild (n 58) and those reared in large enclosures (n 58) differed in movement frequency (inter-fix distance per hour) and maximum distance covered (from the release site) in the first 5 months after release: both were significantly greater in wild individuals, males moved significantly more than females, wild individuals shifted their home ranges significantly more often than captive ones, and no differences were observed between the sexes or age classes. A mixed strategy of selection of wild and captive founders has proven successful in preventing large movements {{in the initial stages}} of release yet still providing sufficient opportunity to avoid inbreeding depression...|$|E

These ensure the survival of 75% of Europe's living species including rare species, such as the small wading dotterel, golden eagle, the Abruzzo (or Abruzzese) <b>chamois,</b> <b>Apennine</b> wolf, and Marsican brown bear.

40|$|The chamois is {{a useful}} species with which to {{investigate}} the combined genetic impact of habitat fragmentation, over hunting, and translocations. Genetic variation within and between chamois (genus Rupicapra) populations was analyzed in 259 individuals from 16 sampling sites located in Italy, Spain, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic. Two mitochondrial DNA markers (control region and cytochrome b) and 11 nuclear microsatellites were typed. The principal {{results of this study}} can be summarized as follows: 1) high and significant differentiation between almost all chamois populations is observed even on a microgeographical scale, probably caused by the patchy distribution of this species, sharp geographical barriers to gene flow, and drift effects related to recent bottlenecks; 2) historical translocation events have left a clear genetic signature, including interspecific hybridization in some Alpine localities; 3) the <b>Apennine</b> subspecies of <b>chamois,</b> Rupicapra pyrenaica ornata, shows a high and similar level of divergence (about 1. 5 My) from the Pyrenean (Rupicapra pyrenaica pyrenaica) and the Alpine (Rupicapra rupicapra) chamois; therefore, the specific status of these taxa should be revised. These results confirm the potential of population genetic analyses to dissect and interpret complex patterns of diversity in order to define factors important to conservation and management...|$|R
40|$|Availability of food {{resources}} and individual characteristics can influence foraging behaviour, which can differ {{between males and}} females, leading to different patterns of food/habitat selection. In dimorphic species, females are usually more selective in food choice, show greater bite rates and spend more time foraging than males. We evaluated sexual differences in foraging behaviour in <b>Apennine</b> <b>chamois</b> Rupicapra pyrenaica ornata, during the warm season, before the rut. Both sexes selected nutritious vegetation patches and spent a comparable amount of time feeding. However, males had a significantly greater feeding intensity (bite rate) and a lower search effort for feeding (step rate), {{as well as they}} spent more time lying down than females. Females selected foraging sites closer to refuge areas than males. In chamois, sexual size dimorphism is seasonal, being negligible in winter– spring, but increasing to 30 – 40...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a sub-entire, partially articulated skeleton of chamois found {{together with other}} vertebrate remains in a silty lens with limestone clasts between the 104 and 105 SSUU of Grotta Mora Cavorso (Latium, Italy). This silty lens is chronologically correlatable to a temperate oscillation of MIS 3. The skull and post-cranial remains from Grotta Mora Cavorso were compared with the fossil remains of chamois from numerous Late Pleistocene and older Holocene sites of Italy and of Pyrenees and Iberian Peninsula. Additional comparisons were made with large samples of extant chamois, Rupicapra pyrenaica ornata, R. pyrenaica pyrenaica and R. rupicapra rupicapra. Morphological and morphometric features of the skull and the horn-core, {{as well as other}} characters of the metacarpus suggest to refer the fossil remains from Grotta Mora Cavorso to <b>Apennine</b> <b>chamois,</b> R. pyrenaica ornata. This is the earliest ascertained record in Central-Southern Italy of the ornata-like chamois, a subspecies so far known with certainty only in the Holocene, or possibly in the Lateglacial...|$|E
40|$|The {{interplay between}} social and {{ecological}} stressors may affect phenotype of individuals, e. g. behaviour and physiology. I evaluated {{the role of}} etho-ecological stressors (i: age and seasonality; ii: food depletion; iii: weather) on female social behaviour (activity, herding, aggression, vigilance) and endocrine levels (faecal cortisol and testosterone), in a mountain-dwelling herbivore, the <b>Apennine</b> <b>chamois</b> Rupicapra pyrenaica ornata, throughout July-October (a key period for the biological cycle of mountain herbivores due to nursing/weaning/early growth of offspring). i) Aggression, vigilance and stress peaked during nursing, despite food abundance. Stress peaked in the expected breeder age class. Costs of motherhood were determinants of behavioural/physiological stress. ii) Aggression, vigilance and stress peaked in poor areas, where nutritional quality of pasture has been reduced by climatic/vegetation changes, as well as food exploitation by a competitor (reintroduced red deer Cervus elaphus), over the last decades. Food depletion led to cascading effects on physiology and behaviour. iii) Temperature had a direct, negative effect on activity, suggesting heat avoidance because of thermoregulation. Harsh weather i. e. higher temperature/lower rainfall {{during the growing season}} of vegetation promoted feeding interference to access depleted pasture. Social behaviour and endocrine response were driven by the interaction between several environmental stressors, such as costs related to maternal cares, resource availability and weather parameters. Current environmental changes may be detrimental to viability of wild mountain herbivores, affecting their social behaviour and stress...|$|E
40|$|Lactation exerts heavy {{energetic}} and physiological costs to mothers, whilst determining early {{growth and survival}} of offspring. To mountain ungulates, access to high-quality forage during nursing and weaning is crucial for reproductive success. We have evaluated the effects of pasture quality on suckling behaviour and winter survival of <b>Apennine</b> <b>chamois</b> Rupicapra pyrenaica ornata kids, across three areas. Areas A-B (‘poor’ areas) were characterised by a reduced availability of nutritious forage, thus a lower diet quality for female chamois and kids; Area C (a ‘rich’ area) included a much greater availability of nutritious forage. In poor areas, pasture quality has been reduced by climatic and plant composition changes, {{as well as the}} presence of a herbivore competitor (red deer Cervus elaphus). In poor areas, we recorded a significantly (1) lower suckling success of chamois kids (number of suckling bouts/number of suck attempts); (2) lower frequency of suckling bouts (n. suckling bouts/kid/h); and (3) lower suckling intensity (suck duration/kid/h) in respect to the rich area. Conversely, frequencies of suckling rejections and those of suckling attempts (n. events/kid/h) were the lowest in the rich area. Winter survival of chamois kids was c. 2  times greater in the rich area (45 %) than in poor areas (20 – 26 %). In the poor areas, resource scarcity induced adult female chamois to decrease maternal cares and favour their own maintenance, ultimately affecting population dynamics through kid winter mortality...|$|E
40|$|Coevolved species {{should avoid}} {{competition}} through resource partitioning, but human-induced alteration of plant/animal communities may facilitate {{the onset of}} competitive interactions. In herbivores, access to high-quality forage in the warm months, that is, during nursing and weaning, influences growth and survival of offspring. In turn, resource exploitation by a reintroduced, superior competitor should affect offspring survival of the inferior one, by decreasing foraging efficiency and diet quality of mothers and young. We assessed {{the negative effects of}} reintroduced red deer Cervus elaphus on grassland, on foraging behavior of female <b>Apennine</b> <b>chamois</b> Rupicapra pyrenaica ornata (July–October 2012 – 2013) and on winter survival of chamois kids, across 3 study sites with different deer densities (great/intermediate/extremely low). The size of bare soil patches was positively associated with deer density and, in areas with deer, it increased throughout July–October. The volume of nutritious plants (i. e., legumes) in the diet of female chamois was lower and decreased faster between summer and autumn, in areas with deer than in that with an extremely low deer density. Feeding intensity (bite rate) of female chamois was significantly lower and their food searching (step rate) was greater in areas with deer. Chamois kids showed a significantly greater winter mortality, with a lower proportion of younger individuals, in areas with deer than in that with an extremely low deer density. In human-altered ecosystems, unpredictable consequences can follow interspecific interactions within restored animal communities. In turn, patterns of ecological relationships among ecosystem components may be modified, with an increase of the potential for competitive interactions...|$|E
