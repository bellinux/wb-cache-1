5|$|Nestlé Purina Petcare is a St. Louis, Missouri-based {{subsidiary}} of Nestlé. It produces and markets pet food, treats and litter. Some of its pet food brands include Purina Pro Plan, Purina Dog Chow, Friskies, Beneful and Purina ONE. The company {{was formed in}} 2001 by combining Ralston Purina, which was acquired by Nestlé for $10.3 billion, with Nestlé's Friskies Petcare Company. <b>As</b> <b>consumers</b> became willing {{to spend more money}} on their pets, the company grew. As of 2012, it is the second-largest pet food company globally and the largest in the United States.|$|E
5|$|As {{ubiquitous}} insects, dipterans play {{an important}} role at various trophic levels both <b>as</b> <b>consumers</b> and as prey. In some groups the larvae complete their development without feeding, and in others the adults do not feed. The larvae can be herbivores, scavengers, decomposers, predators or parasites, with the consumption of decaying organic matter being one of the most prevalent feeding behaviours. The fruit or detritus is consumed along with the associated micro-organisms, a sieve-like filter in the pharynx being used to concentrate the particles, while flesh-eating larvae have mouth-hooks to help shred their food. The larvae of some groups feed on or in the living tissues of plants and fungi, and some of these are serious pests of agricultural crops. Some aquatic larvae consume the films of algae that form underwater on rocks and plants. Many of the parasitoid larvae grow inside and eventually kill other arthropods, while parasitic larvae may attack vertebrate hosts.|$|E

25|$|The Depression {{was a major}} blow to cigar manufacturers. Worldwide demand {{plummeted}} <b>as</b> <b>consumers</b> {{sought to}} cut costs by switching to less-expensive cigarettes, and factories responded by laying off workers or shutting down. This trend continued throughout the 1930s as the remaining cigar factories gradually switched from traditional hand-rolled manufacturing to cheaper mechanized methods, further {{reducing the number of}} jobs and the salaries paid to workers.|$|E
25|$|The {{preceding}} {{months before}} the GST became active saw a spike in consumption <b>as</b> <b>consumers</b> rushed to purchase goods that they perceived would be substantially more expensive with the GST. Once the tax came into effect, consumer consumption and economic growth declined such that by the first fiscal quarter of 2001, the Australian economy recorded negative economic growth {{for the first time}} in more than 10 years. Consumption soon returned to normal however. The Government was criticised by small business owners over the increased administrative responsibilities of submitting Business Activity Statements (BAS) on a quarterly basis to the Australian Taxation Office.|$|E
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>consumers</b> {{and farmers}} grew {{increasingly}} vocal in their unhappiness over the situation, Thomas P.

The area of Western Avenue above the Elliott Bay tideflats and {{the area of the}} commission food houses had just been turned into a wooden planked road, called Pike Place, off of Pike Street and First Avenue. Through a city council ordinance vote, he had Pike Place designated temporarily as the city's first public market on August 5, 1907.|$|E

25|$|In 2008, with rapidly rising oil prices, {{industries}} such as {{the automotive}} industry, are experiencing a combination of pricing pressures from raw material costs and changes in consumer buying habits. The industry is also facing increasing external competition from the public transport sector, <b>as</b> <b>consumers</b> re-evaluate their private vehicle usage. Roughly half of the US's fifty-one light vehicle plants are projected to permanently close in the coming years, {{with the loss of}} another 200,000 jobs in the sector, on top of the 560,000 jobs lost this decade. Combined with robust growth in China, in 2009, this resulted in China becoming the largest car producer and market in the world.|$|E

This programme met with administrative nightmare and widespread public resentment. The third programme eliminated the role of middle men, and it was rumoured that the producer as well <b>as</b> <b>consumers</b> of cotton, rice and wheat {{had been at the}} mercy of middle men trading in the milling of these commodities, with the result that producers were deprived of due share and consumer got poor quality and adulterated commodities at much higher prices. By 1977, the peoples party's government had had built a strong and sizeable public sector with priority on cement, steel and fertilizers.|$|E
25|$|The American {{automobile}} industry became notorious for {{the manufacture of}} gas guzzlers during the 1960s and 1970s when fuel prices and consumer awareness concerning fuel economy were at an all-time low. In the 1960s and 1970s, American-made cars took on enormous proportions <b>as</b> <b>consumers</b> placed their emphasis on comfort, power and style. Large sedans from this era {{came to be known}} as land yachts, often rivaling today's largest pick-up trucks in terms of length and width. In 1977, the Lincoln Continental Mark V was reviewed by the German automobile magazine, auto motor und sport and still holds the record for the worst fuel economy of any vehicle ever tested by the magazine with an average of 7 MPG.|$|E

25|$|However, {{according}} to research firm NPD, sales of devices running Windows in the United States have declined 21 percent compared to {{the same time period}} in 2011. As the holiday shopping season wrapped up, Windows 8 sales continued to lag, even as Apple reported brisk sales. The market research firm IDC reported an overall drop in PC sales for the quarter, and said the drop may have been partly due to consumer reluctance to embrace the new features of the OS and poor support from OEM for these features. This capped the first year of declining PC sales to the Asia Pacific region, <b>as</b> <b>consumers</b> bought more mobile devices than Windows PCs.|$|E
25|$|On January 15, 2002 the German Federal Constitutional Court {{held that}} the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany {{provides}} a broader guarantee {{of human rights in}} the area of religious freedom than the European Convention on Human Rights. In an appeal by a Turkish citizen who practiced Islamic ritual slaughter, the German court struck down Germany's former ban on ritual slaughter, holding that the German Basic Law's guarantee of religious freedom prohibited the German government from applying a law requiring stunning prior to slaughter to observant Muslims who practice ritual slaughter for religious reasons, and that the Basic Law's guarantee of religious freedom applies to slaughterers as well <b>as</b> <b>consumers</b> of meat.|$|E
25|$|Hybrid {{electric}} vehicles, {{which featured}} a combined gasoline and electric powertrain, {{were seen as}} a balance, offering an environmentally friendly image and improved fuel economy, without being hindered by the low range of electric vehicles, albeit at an increased price over comparable gasoline cars. Sales were poor, the lack of interest attributed to the car's small size {{and the lack of}} necessity for a fuel-efficient car at the time. The 2000s energy crisis brought renewed interest in hybrid and electric cars. In America, sales of the Toyota Prius (which had been on sale since 1999 in some markets) jumped, and a variety of automakers followed suit, releasing hybrid models of their own. Several began to produce new electric car prototypes, <b>as</b> <b>consumers</b> called for cars that would free them from the fluctuations of oil prices.|$|E

25|$|In April 2010, {{the release}} of Apple's iPad tablet {{computer}} had {{a negative impact on}} Dell and other major PC vendors, <b>as</b> <b>consumers</b> switched away from desktop and laptop PCs. Dell's own mobility division has not managed success with developing smartphones or tablets, whether running Windows or Google Android. The Dell Streak tablet, introduced in 2010, was a failure commercially and critically due to its outdated operating system, numerous software bugs, and low resolution screen. InfoWorld suggested that Dell and other OEMs saw tablets as a short-term, low-investment opportunity running Google Android, an approach that neglected user interface and failed to gain long term market traction with consumers. Dell responded by pushing higher-end PCs, such as the XPS line of notebooks, which do not compete with the Apple iPad and Kindle Fire tablets. Dell also went on an acquisition spree in 2010-2011, acquiring companies in the storage and software markets including Boomi, Exanet, InSite One, KACE, Ocarina Networks, Scalent, Compellent, SecureWorks, RNA Networks, and Force10 Networks.|$|E
25|$|In a post-Snowden {{world of}} global {{surveillance}} disclosures, consumers {{take a more}} active interest in protecting their privacy and demand IoT devices to be screened for potential security vulnerabilities and privacy violations before purchasing them. According to the 2016 Accenture Digital Consumer Survey, in which 28000 consumers in 28 countries were polled on their use of consumer technology, security “has moved from being a nagging problem to a top barrier <b>as</b> <b>consumers</b> are now choosing to abandon IoT devices and services over security concerns.” The survey revealed that “out of the consumers aware of hacker attacks and owning or planning to own IoT devices in the next five years, 18 percent decided to terminate the use of the services and related services until they get safety guarantees.” This suggests that consumers increasingly perceive privacy risks and security concerns to outweigh the value propositions of IoT devices and opt to postpone planned purchases or service subscriptions.|$|E
25|$|While {{deregulation}} allowed Continental {{to expand}} into new profitable areas, it hurt the company's existing business <b>as</b> <b>consumers</b> were {{for the first time}} able to choose lower fares over Continental's better service. In 1978 Continental explored the possibility of a merger with Western Airlines, which held a nearby headquarters and similar fleet. The route systems would have been complementary, with little overlap; although they both served the Western states, Continental had strength in Hawaii, southern-tier and the Great Plains states; Western's strengths were in the California intrastate market, Alaska, Mexico, and the Intermountain West. Both airlines served the Pacific Northwest and Rocky Mountain states, but along different routes from Los Angeles, Denver, San Francisco, Seattle and Phoenix. The merger did not take place. Unlike some airlines (notably Braniff whose expansion was so rapid and unsustainable that the additional costs made investment recovery impossible, and the carrier was forced into bankruptcy and liquidation), Continental's expansion after passage of the Airline Deregulation Act seems, in retrospect, to have been appropriate. The markets that were added were almost all profitable, absorbing some of the hits to its existing markets and helping it in difficult times between 1982 and 1994.|$|E
