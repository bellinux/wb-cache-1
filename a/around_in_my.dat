[...] "Achtung Baby was U2's 'Holy shit!' moment," [...] remarked drummer Ronnie Vannucci, Jr. [...] "I {{was in high school}} when it came out and we'd drive <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> friend's mom's car and rock that shit all the time. When we were asked to record a cover, 'Ultraviolet' was a unanimous choice. It's reassuring to know that we're still on the same page after all these years. We brought it back to its bare bones, dumbed it down a little, took it back to the rock song underneath." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{journalist}} Malcolm Muggeridge, {{who was not}} {{an admirer}} of Eden, recalled that, among other qualities, [...] "an elegant appearance and an earnest disposition... equipped him for dazzling advancement... An astrakhan collar became him. What {{came to be known}} as an Anthony Eden hat grew on heads like his". In June 1938, four months after Eden's resignation from Neville Chamberlain's Cabinet, the Member of Parliament and diarist [...] "Chips" [...] Channon noted that he had [...] "doffed his bowler" [...] to Chamberlain in St. James's Park and that [...] "everyone wears a bowler now... nce the Eden debacle black homburgs are [...] "out"". However, in August of that year, the British Minister in Prague, Basil Newton, wore [...] "a black homburg of the kind made fashionable by Anthony Eden" [...] to greet Lord Runciman on his arrival by train at Wilson station for talks with the Czechoslovak government. In 1939, writing to a former classmate during a European tour, the future United States President John F. Kennedy remarked that he had not been doing much work, [...] "but have been sporting <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> morning coat, my 'Anthony Eden' black Homburg and white gardenia".|$|E
500|$|Bill Janovitz of Allmusic {{describes}} the music as beautiful, with folk guitar chord changes and a somber melody, while the chorus, with its line [...] "and it's all over now, Baby Blue" [...] has a heartbreaking quality to it. Like other Dylan {{songs of the}} period, such as [...] "Chimes of Freedom" [...] and [...] "Mr. Tambourine Man", the lyrics of [...] "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue" [...] bear the strong influence of Symbolist poets such as Arthur Rimbaud. Lines such as [...] "take what you have gathered from coincidence" [...] reflect the I Ching philosophy that coincidence represents more than mere chance. The song was described by Q magazine as, [...] "The most toxic of strummed kiss-offs, with not a snowball's chance in hell of reconciliation." [...] Dylan, later describing the song, said that [...] "I had carried that song <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> head {{for a long time}} and I remember that when I was writing it, I'd remembered a Gene Vincent song. It had always been one of my favorites, Baby Blue... 'When first I met my baby/she said how do you do/she looked into my eyes and said/my name is Baby Blue.' [...] It was one of the songs I used to sing back in high school. Of course, I was singing about a different Baby Blue." ...|$|E

500|$|Gilligan {{also came}} up with the idea to have a {{crossover}} with the show , which also takes place in Baltimore. He later recalled, [...] "I realized that the whole episode was framed around Byers telling his story to a Baltimore homicide detective. So I figured 'what the heck? Homicides a great show, so why not try to get Richard Belzer to play his Detective [...] character?'" [...] Despite some hesitancy from Fox's lawyers, the show got in contact with NBC executive producer Tom Fontana, who was more than willing to allow the use of Belzer: Gilligan later described Fontana as a [...] "great guy" [...] for assistance in the matter. The episode also features the first reappearance of X, who had been murdered in the season four opener [...] "Herrenvolk". The idea to bring back X was thought up by executive producer John Shiban, who helped Gilligan storyboard the episode. He noted, [...] "we had the board set up and [...] and there was a piece missing and we just couldn't come up with a how to get out of this situation, why doesn't this assassin just kill The Lone Gunmen? It was a flashback story and it was in 1989 and we were pacing <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> backyard, and [...] I just turned to him and said, 'X! [...] X has another agenda!

5000|$|Some reviewers have {{discussed}} similarities between Heathers and Massacre at Central High, a low-budget 1976 film. Heathers screenwriter Daniel Waters {{has stated that}} he had not seen Massacre at Central High at the time he wrote Heathers, but that he had read a review of it in Danny Peary's book Cult Movies, and that the earlier film may have been [...] "rattling <b>around</b> somewhere <b>in</b> <b>my</b> subconscious".|$|R

Dalí said to me, 'I dreamed last night of ants swarming <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> hands', and I said, 'Good Lord, and I dreamed that I had sliced somebody or other's eye. There's the film, let's go and make it.'" [...] In deliberate contrast to the approach taken by Jean Epstein and his peers, which was to never leave anything in their work to chance, with every aesthetic decision having a rational explanation and fitting clearly into the whole, Buñuel and Dalí made a cardinal point of eliminating all logical ...|$|E
2500|$|Minna {{pursued a}} career as an actress, specialising in female {{juvenile}} lead roles ("Erste Liebhaberin") in tragedies. She was in demand by many German theatre companies, and appeared in Dessau, Altenburg, Magdeburg and Dresden before she met Richard Wagner. In a letter dated December 27, 1833, Minna sets out her conditions for employment: she would not accept guest appearances, but expected the leading tragic and young heroine parts. Her fee was 600 thaler plus travelling expenses. While she was praised for her abilities as an actress, her physical charms also brought her admiration. One anonymous suitor wrote to her: [...] "When Nature created you, O Fair One, she broke the mold and never more may create so fair an image.

Atkins also mentions that [...] "around 1980 I had a tape of nothing but Kraftwerk, Telex, Devo, Giorgio Moroder and Gary Numan, and I'd ride <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> car playing it." [...] Atkins has also claimed he was unaware of Kraftwerk's music prior to his collaboration with Richard [...] "3070" [...] Davis as Cybotron, which was two years after he had first started experimenting with electronic instruments. Regarding his initial impression of Kraftwerk, Atkins notes that they were [...] "clean and precise" [...] relative to the [...] "weird UFO sounds" [...] featured in his seemingly [...] "psychedelic" [...] music.|$|E

I went {{up to my room}} with a piece of candle, {{and put it on the}} table. Then I set down in a chair by the window and tried to think of something cheerful, but it warn't no use. I felt so lonesome I most wished I was dead. The stars were shining, and the leaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful; and I heard an owl, away off, who-whooing about somebody that was dead, and a whippowill and a dog crying about somebody that was going to die; and the wind was trying to whisper something to me, and I couldn't make out what it was, and so it made the cold shivers run over me. Then away out in the woods I heard that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell about something that's on its mind and can't make itself understood, and so can't rest easy in its grave, and has to go about that way every night grieving. I got so down-hearted and scared I did wish I had some company. Pretty soon a spider went crawling up my shoulder, and I flipped it off and it lit in the candle; and before I could budge it was all shriveled up. I didn't need anybody to tell me that that was an awful bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck, so I was scared and most shook the clothes off of me. I got up and turned <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> tracks three times and crossed my breast every time; and then I tied up a little lock of my hair with a thread to keep witches away. But I hadn't no confidence. You do that when you've lost a horseshoe that you've found, instead of nailing it up over the door, but I hadn't ever heard anybody say it was any way to keep off bad luck when you'd killed a spider.|$|E
