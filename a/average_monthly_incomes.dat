Thus, this study aims to investigate the influence of socio-economic status of the students of Architecture during their educational process. In this study, deep interviews were made with the students of 6 th semester and their grade point averages (dependent variable) were compared with their socio-economic qualities (independent variable) with the chi-square test and correlational analysis. As a conclusion, it is determined that five independent variables effect the students’ educational process. These are the gender, the district where the students’ family live, the educational level of the students’ mothers, the <b>average</b> <b>monthly</b> <b>incomes</b> of the students’ families and the people who the students live wit...|$|E

Design methodology/approach- Two hundred respondents were selected through stratified random sampling. Data were presented using simple percentage distribution tables and Chi-square analyses were used to analyze the data collected for the research. The conditions for accessing credit from the National Housing Trust Fund (NHTF) which is in custody of the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria (FMBN) and private financial institutions are examined. The <b>average</b> <b>monthly</b> <b>incomes</b> of public sector workers was established from two different salary structures which are currently applicable to workers in State and Federal Government establishments.

The programme aims {{to encourage the}} private sector to build housing on private land for sale to low-income buyers, who receive ‘soft ’ credits from the state. The Casa Propia experience suggests that, in Argentina, the absence of consolidated redes de contención social (social contingency networks) has resulted in a housing programme that emphasises financial viability over social and environmental concerns. 1 Negative social and environmental impacts arise from this neglect. Buenos Aires and its social housing production The 12 million residents of the Greater Buenos Aires metropolitan region account for 40 per cent of Argentina’s population. In the densely populated city of Buenos Aires, home to three million of the metropolitan area’s residents, approximately 15 per cent of the population is in need of housing.

Furthermore, the paper argues that although MWI projected to increase about 1. 7 % per year with estimated growth of 5 - 6 % every year from 2016 - 2020, some challenges are expected to undermine the target set by Economic Planning Unit (EPU) if not given a proper attention. Furthermore, the study shared few wellbeing indicators that used internationally, which only concerned about material aspects and outcomes without looking into the spiritual part of wellbeing.

40|$|Objectives: This study {{assesses the}} {{affordability}} of a nutritious diet for households in Toronto that {{are supported by}} welfare. Methods: For three hypothetical households, welfare incomes were compared to the monthly costs for food, shelter, and other essential expenditures in Toronto. Results: If households lived in market rental accommodation, <b>average</b> <b>monthly</b> <b>incomes</b> were insufficient to cover expenses for the single-person household and two-parent family, and barely adequate for the single-parent family considered in this study. However, the single-parent family’s actual income fell below expenses for {{six months of the}} year. For households with children, the relative inadequacy of welfare increased as children grew older. Living in rent-geared-to-income housing afforded substantial financial advantage, but the welfare income of single-person households was still insufficient to meet basic needs. Interpretation: These findings indicate discrepancies between welfare incomes and costs of basic needs, which may explain the vulnerability of welfare recipients to food insecuri-ty. Welfare provides income assis-tance to those people whoseresources are insufficient to meet their needs and who have exhausted all other avenues of support. 1 In Ontario, welfare assistance is currently delivered under a program called Ontario Works. 2 In January 2000, 30, 443 unattached indi-viduals, 31, 473 sole-support parents, and 11, 557 couples were receiving Ontari...|$|E
40|$|The 1991 {{census data}} {{revealed}} that about 60 per {{cent of the}} women in the childbearing age range (i. e. 15 - 49 years) had never been married but bore children. The paper therefore attempts to delineate family or household types within which decision-making processes and reproduction take place. The results of the analysis of census and surveys data indicate that the old traditional nuclear and/or extended family structures have been gradually replaced, to a large extent, by what we refer to as 'zero-couple ' or single-parent family or household type which constitutes about 70 per cent of the households in Botswana and 90 per cent of these are headed by females. These households receive much lower <b>average</b> <b>monthly</b> <b>incomes</b> and are the poorest in the country. Nevertheless, the women in these households exercise greater autonomy. The locus of decision-making process with regard to the number of children to have and the use of resources is the woman herself. And this autonomy has played a major role in the on-going fertility transition in the country (Gaisie 1998). However, the absence of male role models in these households does not augur well for socialization of the children, particularly the boys. The problems facing the female-headed households underscore the need to understand the various dynamics of these households through research in order to devise appropriate strategies and interventions...|$|E

40|$|Q fever is a {{zoonotic}} disease caused by Coxiella burnetii which is ubiquitous {{in nature and}} it poses a substantial public health concern. Q fever has a potential to cause detrimental effect on human health and its effect can translate to substantial economic losses in affected households. Livestock is {{the main source of}} infection in humans. The overall objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the need for surveillance of Q-fever infection within pastoral systems by the relevant health systems in Kenya. The specific objectives were first to describe the knowledge and perception of pastoralist in Kajiado County on the common infectious diseases affecting them and second to estimate the socio-economic impact of Q fever infection in pastoralist households. The study was conducted in the month of May and June 2015 in Namanga, Mashuru and Ngong sub counties of Kajiado County. Seven focus group discussions were conducted with pastoralists and nine key informant interviews were held at the local health facilities with the health workers in-charge by use of interview guides. Data was collected on diseases that affected household members; their perception on the most prevalent diseases; household members response when one is sick; average medical costs incurred for treatment for each of the common infectious diseases; their knowledge of Q fever. Pairwise ranking and scoring methods were used to determine the most common diseases affecting the community. Additionally, data was collected from secondary sources on prevalence of Q fever in humans, cattle, goats and sheep; household monthly incomes; estimated outcomes of primary Q fever infections in humans. Data which was obtained from focus group discussions were used to rank prevalent diseases based on the scores given by pastoralists. Further statistical analysis was done using Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance to determine if there was a significant difference in the mean ranks of diseases across the focus group discussions held with pastoralists/farmers and key informant interviews held with health workers. The economic cost of Q fever infection in humans was estimated using a deterministic model which was developed in Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. The estimation of economic cost was based on the reported prevalence of Q fever infection among pastoralist households, <b>average</b> <b>monthly</b> <b>incomes,</b> average treatment costs and the number of days’ people stayed away from work due to illness with Q fever. From the focus group discussions with pastoralists, common cold and malaria were prioritized as the most prevalent disease, while pneumonia, malaria, upper respiratory tract infections and typhoid fever were prioritized by health workers as most common diseases. Both the pastoralists and clinicians had no knowledge of Q fever infection amongst household members. Based on previously estimated prevalence of 26 % of Q fever in pastoral systems from secondary sources, the economic impact of Q fever infection in a typical pastoralists household was estimated to be Ksh 4, 600 per month. The indirect costs attributed to the number of working days lost were greater than the direct costs such as treatment and transport. Q-fever infection is therefore an important febrile disease in humans and more efforts should be put into increasing its awareness among health workers and pastoralist. Therefore, there is need for surveillance of Q fever infection within pastoral systems by the relevant health delivery systems in Kenya. This can be made possible through combined efforts of pastoralist, veterinarians, health workers, environmental scientists and the government.

30|$|Though it was {{observed}} that nearly all of the women had no formal book keeping system for their business transactions, they were able to report on their <b>monthly</b> generated <b>income</b> (Akinbami, 2015). Despite the well-known challenges in gathering estimates of <b>monthly</b> <b>income</b> for rural farmers through questionnaire survey methods, the findings indicate some clear patterns which appear consistent with other studies. According to the women interviewed, a greater percentage of <b>income</b> generated <b>monthly,</b> concentrated around ₦ 10, 000 and ₦ 20, 000, that is, <b>average</b> <b>monthly</b> <b>income.</b> About 10.6 % of the total respondents earned less than ₦ 5000 <b>average</b> <b>monthly</b> <b>income,</b> while 17 % earned between ₦ 5000 - ₦ 10, 000 and less than one tenth of the respondents earned above ₦ 20, 000 <b>monthly.</b> The mean <b>average</b> <b>monthly</b> <b>income</b> was about ₦ 7500. From this data, {{it is obvious that the}} majority (about 70 %) of the rural women earned less than the approved minimum wage of ₦ 18, 000 in the formal sector in the country. This again could be the reason why most of the women’s livelihood practices remain at the micro level, since there is a lack of sufficient capital for expansion. In situations of chronic poverty, particularly among the women, there are likely to be major barriers to entrepreneurship.|$|R
