40|$|A {{detailed}} discussion on concepts {{is presented as}} a result of a project of research being developed at CETEC Foundation. The main interest was turned to hydrographic basin environmental management and water quality and quantity control. Input data come from various fields of knowledge and an unified mathematical approach is employed to treat the many variables according to the concept of homogeneous unities which may be represented by three others concepts: morphometry, assimilative capacity of rivers, environmental management of waters. Remote sensing is one of the technics applied to data acquisition which will give input to the proposed mapping products. The mathematical treatment involve principal component analysis, cluster analysis, factorial analysis R and Q modes, and an ensemble of correlation methods. The variables must be calculated by different mathematical procedures but they are not presented in this report. These results are part of a wider <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>technics</b> to environmental management and water control. Pages: 190 - 19...|$|E

40|$|The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a {{language}} for metadata assertions about information {{resources on the}} World-Wide Web, and is thus a foundation for a future Semantic Web. The atomic construct of RDF are statements, which are triples consisting of the resource being described, a property, and a property value. A collection of RDF statements can be intuitively understood as a graph: resources are nodes and statements are arcs connecting the nodes. The graph nature of this abstract triple syntax is indeed appealing, but the RDF specification does not distinguish clearly among (1) the term of RDF Graph (merely a set of triples, thus not a standard graph), (2) the mathematical concept of graph, and (3) the graph-like visualization of RDF data (“node and directed-arc diagrams”). This thesis argues that there is need for an explicit graph representation for RDF, which allows the <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>technics</b> and results from graph theory and which serves as an intermediate model between the abstract triple syntax and task-specific serialization of RDF data.

Four of these involved acute infectious disease states and one involved a chronic autoimmune type disease.

Especially the use of inhaled H 2 as indicator and a so-called potentiometric Pt-electrode as detector was used in many investigations, primarily in the evaluation of circulatory shunts. This method however, has the disadvantage of giving only qualitative information. The use of a polarized Pt-electrode for the detection of injected ascorbate as indicator has the benefit of a linear relationship between signal and concentration. The disadvantage of polarized electrodes in a flowing medium is the dependency of the signal on the flow velocity.

40|$|ABSTRACTThe {{pulmonary}} sequestration {{corresponds to}} pulmonary tissue intra or extra-lobar with systemic arterial nutrition and collateral bronchial ramification. It is unfrequent and the intra-lobar identification {{depends on the}} correct clinical signs and morphology. The correct study includes imagiologic identification of the systemic artery and morphological characterization of parenchymal changes. These allow identification of abnormal pulmonary parenchyma in intra-lobar cases and were observed using histochemical and imunohistochemical routine methods, both in intra and extra-lobar cases. Four cases of intra-lobar sequestration and four cases of extra-lobar sequestration were studied with <b>application</b> <b>of</b> histochemical <b>technics</b> – Movat’s pentachrome stain and Verhoeff – and immunolabelling with CK 7 and TTF 1.

40|$|Recent {{developments}} in autoradiography {{leading to the}} use of tritiated compounds in the study of biosynthetic processes have provided a basic method for accurate intracellular localization of such labeled substances (1). The high resolution obtained by using such compounds is attributed to the short path of the beta rays emitted by tritium, 50 per cent of which are stopped in less than 1 # of tissue. Path distances of such magnitude could probably be obtained with higher energy particles in thin sections covered with thin emulsion. Hence, <b>technics</b> <b>of</b> autoradiography should be seriously considered for more general application in electron microscopy. Limitations in resolution imposed by the emulsion thickness and by the relatively large size of silver grains preclude the possibility of localization of labeled compounds at the molecular or even macromolecular level. But the possibility of observing differences in fine structure between cells or cell components which were, and were not, incorporating labeled compounds at the time of fixation is real and is the main justification for the <b>application</b> <b>of</b> the <b>technics</b> reported here. Autoradiographs of whole liver cell nuclei (2) labeled with cobalt- 60, of radioactive dust particles (3), and of sections of tritium-labeled tissues (4) have been studied in the electron microscope.

A UTOMATIC ANALYZERS based on continuous-flow methods are gain-ing increased use in analytical chemistry and particularly in clinical chemistry. In the latter field, one instrument, the AutoAnalyzer, * has been widely accepted for routine use. These instruments are valuable when many different samples of similar composition must be ana-lyzed for specific constituents because they operate on a “continu-ous ” rather than a “batch ” basis and can analyze many samples in sequence. Certain propei-ties of continuous-flow systems are inherently dif-ferent from those familiar to the average analyst. Lack of attention to these pi-opem-ties can lead to serious loss of precision and accuracy. Particularly in the field of clinical chemistry, in which it is common practice to make only one determination per specimen per constitu-ent, mishandling of an automatic instrument can provide apparently good data which are, in fact, significantly in error.

THIAMINE Thiamine pyrophosphate is obligatory for the opening step of the reactions that feed into the citric acid cycle and is necessary in an analogous way in the metabolism of a-keto glutanic acid which occurs somewhat later in the cycle. Since, in the former case, the entrance of pynuvic acid into the citric acid cycle depends upon an adequate supply of thiamine pyro-phosphate, an elevation of pyruvic acid in the blood is observed in thiamine deficiency. Be-cause of this relationship, blood pyruvate levels have been studied in every conceivable fashion in an attempt to develop a test for thi-amine deficiency.

The results support the concept that proliferating osteogenic and dentinogenic cells may undergo two alternative types of cytodifferentiation: fibrogenic and resorptive. With {{the knowledge that the}} form and func-tion of biological systems can be related to their growth mechanisms, hard tissue biolo-gists have escalated study of the physiology and morphology of dentinogenesis and osteo-genesis. Thus, the literature on the subject includes the nature and sequence of cyto-dynamic events involved, the regulation of these events, and their application to dental and bone diseases. Light microscopy has provided impetus to this research in the <b>application</b> <b>of</b> autoradio-graphic <b>technics</b> employing thymidine- 3 H for analyzing cell division cycles in teethl 13 and bone. 4 5 As a result of these studies, it is now generally established that the key to the dynamic events occurring during osteo-genesis and dentinogenesis is the population of proliferating mesenchymal cells in bone and teeth, which gives rise to the specialized cells concerned with the formation and maintenance of the organic matrixes of these tissues. These studies have also revealed the kinetic parameters related to the proliferat-ing osteogenic and dentinogenic cells.

40|$|In the {{preceding}} report (1), {{it was shown}} that precipitating antibodies to streptolysin O concentrate were quite common in human sara, using the agar <b>technic</b> <b>of</b> Oudin (2). Although some sara showed several bands with this antigen, strong evidence was presented that the streptolysin O system was the most frequent in these tests. With rabbit anfisera to the streptolysin concentrate, up to four antigens could be found. The identity of the non-streptolysin bands could not be readily determined. Although the concentrates used {{were found to be}} contaminated with streptococcal desoxyribonuclease (3), and proteinase precursor (4), it was shown that the extra bands in the rabbit sara were apparently not due to these systems using the Oudin methods. The preparations were found to be essentially free of some of the other well characterized antigens or toxins produced by these organisms.
