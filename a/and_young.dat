5|$|A {{systematic}} review in 2012 found and analysed four randomized controlled trials of ketogenic diet in children <b>and</b> <b>young</b> people with epilepsy, {{as well as}} six prospective and five retrospective studies. The trials were done among children <b>and</b> <b>young</b> people for whom drugs failed to control their seizures, and {{only one of the}} trials compared a group assigned to ketogenic diet with a group not assigned to one. The other trials compared types of diets or ways of introducing them to make them more tolerable. Nearly 40% of the children <b>and</b> <b>young</b> people had half or fewer seizures with the diet compared with the group not assigned to the diet. Only about 10% were still on the diet after a few years. Adverse effects such as hunger and loss of energy in that trial were common, with about 30% experiencing constipation.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the Republican convention, the Lincoln {{campaign}} began cultivating {{a nationwide}} teen <b>and</b> <b>young</b> adult organization, the Wide Awakes, which {{it used to}} generate popular support for Lincoln throughout the country to spearhead large voter registration drives, knowing that new voters <b>and</b> <b>young</b> voters tend to embrace new <b>and</b> <b>young</b> parties. As Lincoln's ideas of abolishing slavery grew, so did his supporters. People of the Northern states knew the Southern states would vote against Lincoln because of his ideas of anti-slavery and took action to rally supporters for Lincoln.|$|E

40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{research}} is the perception of restaurant service held by senior citizens and how it differs from those of younger customers. It examines (a) the relationship between customer satisfaction and service quality among elderly consumers, (b) differences in level of satisfaction between older <b>and</b> <b>younger</b> customers, (c) differences in perception-of-service quality between older <b>and</b> <b>younger</b> customers, <b>and</b> (d) differences in perception-of-service quality between elderly male and female customers. Statistically significant differences in levels of satisfaction were discovered between older <b>and</b> <b>younger</b> customers, but no significant relationship was found between level of customer satisfaction and perceived service quality. There were significant differences in perceptions of service quality between older <b>and</b> <b>younger</b> customers, <b>and</b> between male and female older customers. This study provides useful knowledge for restaurant managers about the differences between senior <b>and</b> <b>younger</b> customers. It could be helpful towards developing and designing future restaurant marketing strategies targeting senior customers...|$|R

5|$|An {{alternative}} approach to designing smaller waveguide filters {{was provided by}} the use of non-propagating evanescent modes. Jaynes and Edson proposed evanescent mode waveguide filters in the late 1950s. Methods for designing these filters were created by Craven <b>and</b> <b>Young</b> in 1966. Since then, evanescent mode waveguide filters have seen successful use where waveguide size or weight are important considerations.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{that are}} {{important}} to the marsh rice rat's diet include insects, fiddler crabs, and snails, but the species is known to eat many other animals, including fish, clams, and juvenile Graptemys and Chrysemys turtles. They scavenge on carcasses of muskrats, deermice, and sparrows, and {{may be the most important}} predator on eggs <b>and</b> <b>young</b> of the marsh wren. Rice rats also eat eggs <b>and</b> <b>young</b> of the seaside sparrow (Ammodramus maritimus) and are aggressive towards the sparrow, apparently leading it to avoid nesting in Juncus in a seaside salt marsh in Florida. On islands in North Carolina, rice rats consume eggs of Forster's tern (Sterna forsteri). They have been observed preying on alligator eggs in Georgia.|$|E
