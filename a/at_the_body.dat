5|$|A bodyline {{delivery}} was {{one where}} the cricket ball was bowled <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> of the batsman, {{in the hope that}} when he defended himself with his bat, a resulting deflection could be caught by one of several fielders standing close by. This was considered by critics to be intimidatory and physically threatening, {{to the point of being}} unfair in a game that was supposed to uphold gentlemanly traditions.|$|E

5|$|Bodyline was {{a tactic}} devised for and {{primarily}} {{used in the}} Ashes series between England and Australia in 1932—33. The tactic involved bowling at leg stump or just outside it, pitching the ball short so that it reared <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> of a batsman stood in an orthodox batting position. A ring of fielders ranged on the leg side would catch any defensive deflections from the bat. The batsman's options were to evade the ball through ducking or moving aside, allow the ball to strike their body or play the ball with his bat. The latter course carried additional risks. Defensive shots brought few runs and could carry far enough to be caught by the fielders on the leg side; pull and hook shots could be caught {{on the edge of}} the field where two men were usually placed for such a shot.|$|E
5|$|Bradman's {{relentless}} use of {{his pace}} attack and fieldsmen also raised eyebrows. At the time, Lindwall and Miller were groundbreaking fast bowlers, with high pace {{and the ability to}} deliver menacing short-pitched bowling at the upper body of the English batsmen. Prior to the Second World War, pace bowlers were generally much slower and did not often bowl <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>body.</b> England had yet to develop bowlers such as Lindwall and Miller, and as a result, Australia were able to pepper the upper body of the opposition without fear of retaliation. At times, the public found Lindwall and Miller's short-pitched bowling to be excessive and booed the Australians. On the fielding front, Barnes was deployed as close to the bat as possible at either forward short-leg or point, with one foot on the pitch. This had an intimidatory effect on the batsmen and led many to question whether it was {{in the spirit of the}} game.|$|E
5|$|Lindwall and Miller were {{groundbreaking}} fast bowlers, {{with high}} pace {{and the ability}} to deliver menacing short-pitched bowling at the upper body of the batsmen. Prior to World War II, pace bowlers were generally much slower and rarely bowled <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>body.</b> England were yet to develop similar bowlers, and as a result, Australia were able to pepper the upper body of the opposition without fear of retaliation. At one stage, the Australian short-pitched barrage prompted the English selectors to drop leading batsman Hutton, something that provoked great controversy. Lindwall and Johnston dominated the home batsmen and took 27 wickets apiece, at averages of 19.62 and 23.33 respectively, while the injury-prone Miller took 13 at 23.15. For England, the batsman emerging with most credit was Compton, who scored 562 runs at 62.44. Washbrook (356 runs at 50.85) was the only other player to average beyond 45.|$|E

5|$|Schnauzers have a {{specific}} groom cut that is standard among the Schnauzer breed. Schnauzers require regular grooming, either by stripping (mostly seen in show dogs), or by clipping (a short-cut usually reserved for family pets). Stripping removes the loose, dead coat; it may be done by hand, called finger stripping, or plucking, or with a stripping knife; either way, it is a laborious process. Many Miniature Schnauzers who are family pets have regular grooming appointments to have their hair clipped; clipping, using a mechanical clippers (or shaver), produces a soft, silky, skin-close trim. Whether stripped or clipped, the coat is close <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>body,</b> and falls into a fringe-like foundation on its undercarriage, called furnishings, which can be left to grow, but must be combed regularly. All Schnauzers, whether they are Miniatures, Standards, or Giants, often sport a beard, created by allowing the hair around their noses to grow out. Left unclipped or unstripped, the body hair will grow two to four inches, and will often tangle into mats and curls.|$|E
5|$|There {{was a scene}} were I {{was lying}} on the ground, {{appearing}} to be dead, in a Lodger-esque pose and we had a camera with a big weather balloon filled with helium hooked up to it… the first one we did, we started the film, I was laying on the ground and the ropes that were holding the balloon snapped, the camera just took off into the atmosphere… the camera landed two hundred miles away in a farmer's field somewhere. He finds it and takes it to the police, thinking that it's a surveillance camera for marijuana, they develop the film and think that it's some sort of snuff film of a murder, give it to the FBI and have pathologists looking <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> saying, 'yeah, he's rotting,' (I had corn starch on me, right) 'he's been decomposing for 3 weeks.'

5|$|Infamous is an action-adventure game set {{in an open}} world {{environment}} and played from a third-person perspective where the player controls Cole and primarily interacts {{with the world of}} Empire City through Cole's newly gained electricity-based powers; these are used for movement, offense and defense in combat, and either for better or worse in dealing with the citizens of Empire City. In order for Cole to use his powers, he must have stored electrical power, represented by a node meter on the player's heads up display (HUD). The player can recharge Cole by draining electricity from powered sources or from living beings; recharging also restores Cole's health, which is indicated by blood splattering onto the screen. The more damage that Cole takes, the more blood that covers the screen. When Cole's health is at a critical level, the screen will turn black and white, and if Cole takes a little bit more damage while the screen is black and white, a heartbeat will be heard and will get slower and slower as Cole takes more damage, until it is beating dangerously slow. At this point, further damage to Cole will kill him. If the player stays out of battle long enough, Cole's health will regenerate over time. The game features seventeen different electrical powers, ranging from simple bolts that do not consume Cole's energy to wide-field lightning storms that drain most of Cole's energy. The player can use such powers, giving the player options in certain situations. For example, the player may fire at a generator near foes to cause it to explode and cripple his opponents, then restrain them or fire <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> to kill the enemy.|$|E

25|$|Using {{these large}} polyhedra, the crystal {{structure}} of Sc0.83–xB10.0–yC0.17+ySi0.083–z {{can be described}} as shown in figure 25. Owing to the crystal symmetry, the tetrahedral coordination between these superstructure units is again a key factor. The supertetrahedron T(1) lies <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> center and at the edge center of the unit cell. The superoctahedra O(1) locate <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> center (0.25, 0.25, 0.25) of the quarter of the unit cell. They coordinate tetrahedrally around T(1) forming a giant tetrahedron. The supertetrahedra T(2) are located at the symmetry-related positions (0.25, 0.25, 0.75); they also form a giant tetrahedron surrounding T(1). Edges of both giant tetrahedra orthogonally cross each other at their centers; at those edge centers, each B10 polyhedron bridges all the super-structure clusters T(1), T(2) and O(1). The superoctahedron built of B10 polyhedra is located at each cubic face center.|$|E

25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} famous image of the Tet Offensive, a photo that was taken by Eddie Adams, was the {{photograph}} that depicted a Vietnamese man being executed by the Southern Vietnamese General, General Nguyen Ngoc Loan. The photo shows the moment of death for the young man. Adams won a prize for his iconic photo, which {{was said to be}} more influential than the video that was released of the same execution. The impact that the photos had on the American public was astounding. Support for the war plummeted, and though two hundred thousand troops were requested {{at the beginning of the}} Offensive, the request was denied. Adams had another photo published that, while not making as big as an impact as his other photo, was certainly gruesome. The image depicted a soldier, who appears to be a child, dead and lying on the side of the road, with a group of civilians looking down <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>body.</b> It was published on May 5, 1968.|$|E

500|$|In {{the wake}} of England's tactics of {{sustained}} fast short pitched bowling <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> of the Australian batsman, Australian vice-captain Vic Richardson urged that Nash {{be brought into the}} Test team to [...] "give the Poms back some of their own medicine." [...] Another Australian cricketer, Jack Fingleton, later wrote that the Australian selectors erred in not playing Nash, believing he was to be the best exponent in Australia of intimidatory fast bowling. However, the Australian Board of Control for International Cricket, which had been protesting to the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) about the Bodyline tactics of Jardine, believed that the inclusion of Nash would only aggravate an already tense situation, and Australian captain Bill Woodfull thought Bodyline bowling to be unsportsmanlike and refused to use the tactic.|$|E
500|$|The {{scene of}} the crime was visited by Father Michael Lewis of the Stella Maris Church, who was {{accompanied}} by Williamson's sister Gradryn Williams; she was convinced not to look <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> by Williamson's friends. Crowds assembled outside the apartment block, made up of individuals who were laughing and celebrating Williamson's death. Some of the assembled people shouted out statements such as [...] "This is long overdue", [...] "Battyman he get killed", [...] "Let's get them one at a time", [...] "That's what you get for sin", and [...] "Batty man fi dead!" [...] ("Faggots should die!"). Others sang [...] "Boom Bye Bye", a line from a dancehall song by Buju Banton that discusses shooting and burning gay men. Rebecca Schleifer, a Human Rights Watch (HRW) researcher, had a meeting with Williamson planned for that day, and arrived at his home to find the assembled crowd; she noted that [...] "It was like a parade. They were basically partying".|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} to his bowling performance, Nash was picked for the deciding Fifth Test of the 1936–1937 Ashes series at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, with the sides locked at 2–2 in the series. His selection invoked complaints from the touring English side, where {{it was reported that}} a [...] "feeling bordering on panic" [...] had arisen at the thought of facing Nash during the Test. England captain Gubby Allen pressed for Nash's banishment from the Australian team, organising a private lunch with Bradman, then Australian captain. Bradman refused to omit Nash, believing [...] "his presence in the team would be a psychological threat to England whether he bowled bouncers or underarm grubbers". Allen then approached the Australian Board of Control. It has been suggested that the Board of Control wanted to accede to Allen's demand and veto Nash's selection but were forced to relent when the selectors threatened to resign if Nash was not included. Finally, Allen informed the umpires that if Nash was to bowl one ball aimed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>body,</b> he would immediately bring his batsmen off the ground.|$|E
