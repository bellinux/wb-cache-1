When the nature of the task solved by the department is highly uncertain, the need for a constant flow of information increases among both the employees and the physicians from other departments solving tasks at the emergency department (Tushman and Nadler 1977).

40|$|Social Hymenoptera {{have become}} key organisms for tests of sex-ratio theory. We assess {{the role of}} {{resources}} for explaining sex-ratio variation in a highly male-biased population of the ant Formica exsecta. Key predictions {{of two of the}} three leading hypotheses invoking an effect of resource availability on sex ratios in social insects are not upheld. One prediction of the multifaceted parental-investment hypothesis is that colonies with greater brood production will rear a greater proportion of their diploid offspring as reproductive females (gynes), rather than workers, This study shows the positive correlation between female-biased sex ratio and the production of brood by female-producing colonies was not the outcome of a trade-off in the production of workers vs. gynes. The main prediction of the constant-female hypothesis is that investment in gynes should be constant. We found extreme variation among colonies in the number of gynes produced. By contrast, all the predictions of the queen-replenishment hypothesis were supported. The queen-replenishment hypothesis predicts that colonies produce gynes only when queen number is so low that colony production of brood is reduced, or colony survival threatened. We found that, as predicted by this hypothesis, female-producing colonies had fewer queens and produced a lower biomass of brood than male-producing colonies. In contrast, male-producing colonies had lower production per queen, and {{were more likely to be}} limited by external resources. This suggests that queen number limits production in female-producing colonies.

40|$|Elasticity is {{the unique}} {{cost-effective}} proposition of the cloud. It promises rapid <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> {{in response to}} varying workloads so that the application can meet its QoS objectives with minimal operational expenses. It is a crucial attribute that all commercial cloud providers frequently claim to possess in their offerings. However, existing literature has not yet provided any meaningful and systematic guidance to evaluate the elasticity of the cloud platform from the consumer’s viewpoint. The lack of an elasticity benchmarking framework {{makes it difficult for}} the consumer to diagnose and avoid elasticity issues, validate various claims of elasticity and compare the desirability of competing elastic cloud platforms. As such, this thesis proposes a novel consumer-centric elasticity benchmarking framework ElasticMark that reflects the elasticity of the cloud platform as a single figure of merit. It takes the consumer’s perspective on running the benchmark by incorporating her application and workload profiles and then encapsulating the consumer’s business objectives into the elasticity metric based on observations accessible via the cloud APIs. The core framework is comprised of a penalty based elasticity measurement model, a standard workload suite with time-varying workload patterns and a set of guidelines for instantiating an executable benchmark. The measurement model derives the elasticity metric based on financial penalty rates resulting from over-provisioning (unutilized resources) and under-provisioning (inadequate resources) when the cloud-hosted application is exposed to a suite of fluctuating workloads. ElasticMark also includes a novel workload model in order to assist the consumer to generate representative prototypes of her application-specific fine-scale bursty workloads, thus facilitates custom elasticity benchmarking. Furthermore, this framework recommends a set of rigorous techniques to ensure repeatable and valid benchmarking results in presence of the performance unpredictability of the cloud environment. The framework has been validated against a widely-used commercial cloud service {{to make sure that the}} elasticity metric is a good reflection of the low-level adaptability characteristics and observed phenomena. It has also been proven effective in comparing and contrasting the elasticity of multiple cloud platforms as well as pinpointing anomalies in their adaptive behaviors...|$|E
40|$|Maternal {{effects can}} {{potentially}} affect ecological and evolutionary processes, im-proving {{the adaptation of}} offspring to variable environments. In birds, mothers can buffer offspring from the impacts of environmental heterogeneity by <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources,</b> such as hormones, that are transmitted to the developing offspring via the egg. Exposure to steroids during early development {{has been shown to}} affect a vari-ety of traits, leading to important fitness consequences. Although several experimental studies have shown how nestlings benefit from increased yolk androgens through increased growth and survival, high levels of yolk androgens also involve costs. Accelerated growth induced by yolk androgens may suppress immune responses because of the trade-off between body mass gain and immune function. Manipulation of the androgen environment of an embryo may al-so induce a wide range of life-history trade-offs. Most previous studies have focused on the effects of yolk androgens on early life stages. However, these maternal hor-mones can have long-term consequences on adult phenotype and fitness. In order to draw more accurate conclusions about the effect of yolk androgens as modulators of life-history trade-offs, one should consider that their consequences may vary depending on additional factors, such as embryo sex, developmental phase, type of androgen, dose and environmental context. Data for this thesis were obtained during the 2009 - 2014 breeding seasons in a nest-box population located in central Spain (Soto del Real, Madrid). We manipulated androgen levels in spotless starling eggs (Sturnus unicolor) and analyzed the balance of benefits and costs in early development, as well as their long term effects on adult phenotype and repro-ductive output. We found that the two main androgens found in avian yolks, testosterone (T) and androstenedione (A 4), exert different effects on different traits of the developing nestling. However, their effects are not additive. Yolk androgens show complex dose-response effects during early development, including both linear and non-linear responses for different nestling traits, supporting the idea that the balance of cost and benefits is strongly determined by hormone levels (i. e. higher androgens levels are not always beneficial. In addition, these cost of androgen levels, often emerge as sex-specific immunosuppression, as high hormone levels negative impact some components of the innate and adaptive axes of the immune system (e. g. lyso-zyme activity of the plasma and cell-mediated immunoresponsiveness) in male nest-lings but not in females. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract This study {{concentrates}} on clarifying {{the background of}} downsizing as a strategy, measuring the profitability effects of downsizing and finding out the signal value of downsizing announcements in the capital markets. The research focuses on deriving the effects of downsizing among Finnish large cap companies between 2005 and 2010 : what are the effects, what are the main drivers behind the effects and do future profitability development correlate with initial market reaction. The sample of 197 downsizing events consists of stock exchange releases regarding new downsizing actions from Helsinki stock exchange OMX 25 companies. The effects on profitability are measured by market adjusted ROA, ROE, EBIT margin and sales productivity through seven year event window: three years before and {{three years after the}} downsizing announcement year. The signal effect in the capital markets is studied with event study methodology through 41 days event window: 20 days before and 20 days after the announcement. Events are categorized in subsamples and cross–sectional analysis is used to derive the effects of downsizing and the main drivers behind the effects. This study shows evidence that downsizing does not {{have a significant impact on}} profitability on an aggregate level. Market adjusted return on assets and return on equity improve roughly 1 % whereas EBIT margin decreases by the same amount among downsizers during three years after the announcement. Low- and high-profitability subsamples seem to be the most economically and statistically significant factor affecting post-announcement financials; low-profitability subsample clearly outperforms high-profitability subsample in post-announcement financial development. The abnormal return patterns related to the downsizing announcement correlate with post-announcement financial development on subsample level. On aggregate level, the compounded abnormal returns related to the announcements are slightly positive but statistically insignificant. The positive abnormal returns are driven by reactive downsizing strategies, downsizing made during recession and downsizing made by companies with low profitability. The key indications of the research are as follows: 1. Downsizing does not have a significant impact on profitability and signal value for the capital markets is insignificant on an aggregate level 2. Same factors seem to drive both: post-announcement financials and the effect on capital markets 3. Market absorbs the positive or negative information related to the future financial performance correctly and efficiently on subsample level 4.

VMware DRS offers an additional <b>resource</b> abstraction <b>of</b> a <b>resource</b> pool (RP) as a logical container representing an aggregate resource allocation for a collection of VMs. In spite of the abundant research on translating application performance goals to resource requirements, the implementation of VM ver-tical scaling techniques in commercial products remains limited.

In this paper, we present AppRM, a tool that automatically sets resource controls for both virtual machines and resource pools to meet application SLOs. AppRM contains a hierarchy of virtual application managers and resource pool managers. At the application level, AppRM translates performance objectives into the appropriate resource control settings for the individual VMs running that application. At the resource pool level, AppRM ensures that all important applications within the resource pool can meet their performance targets by adjusting controls at the resource pool level. Experimental results under a variety of dynamically changing workloads composed by multi-tiered applications demonstrate the effectiveness of AppRM. In all cases, AppRM is able to deliver application performance satisfaction without manual intervention. I...|$|R

Apart from lowering costs, in particular fast and non-standard conversion of customer requirements to new products develops to a dominating company target. Due to this rising individualizing of products manufacturing plants have to produce a more diversified product spectrum. Additionally these product spectra change more frequently, due to decreasing product life cycles. This increased product variance and frequency of change cause an increase in safety stock amounts, complex <b>adjustments</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> and an intermittent flow of material.

The common product and production planning process is extended by planning processes, which consider variance induced by market and product. The general approach of this work is to limit influences of variance on isolated processes within the value chain. Generic proposals to design product and production modules are developed.

Learning from the successful experience of carrying out continuing education in developed countries in Europe and America, the researchers came out with corresponding countermeasures for the next step in developing continuing education of high-tech parks in China...|$|R
3000|$|It {{should also}} be noticed that some {{resources}} adjustment may have {{no impact on the}} system metrics of the VMs. In fact, it can depend on resources and the underlying usage model. For example, for a given load, if we consume 60 % of the CPU (100 % available with no restriction), when a restriction of 70 % is imposed, we will consume 60 % / 70 % = 85 % of the available CPU. The number of CPU seconds will remain the same though. For this purpose, we have considered in the resource adjustment algorithm the following condition: If (|BeforeAdj−AfterAdj|<ε) (line 11), which means that the collected data are the same before and after <b>adjustments.</b> The effect <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> <b>adjustment</b> in this case is equals to 0, as given in Algorithm 1 (eff [...]...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In an intermittent-connectivity network, there rarely {{exists a}} {{connected}} path between a source node and its destination. These networks arise frequently when each node has a limited transmission range, {{such as a}} communication network between separated villages or a surveillance network with a large geographical span. One method of addressing the low connectivity of the network uses redundancy. A node generates and stores data; upon reaching the communication range of another node, it replicates the data to it. Multiple copies of the packet decrease the time to offload the data to the destination, but increase the energy and storage used in the system. In this paper, we quantify the resource-delay trade-off and the throughput capacity for intermittent-connectivity networks with Quality of Service restrictions such as limited communication bandwidth. Many routing protocols have been proposed for these intermittent-connectivity networks. Using the Shared Wireless Infostation Model as an example strategy, we mathematically represent the intermittent-connectivity network and adjust the model to include a Quality of Service constraint. By completely defining a mathematical model, we allow network designers control over system performance through the <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> allocated <b>resources</b> such as communication bandwidth, fraction of time a node spends in sleep mode, or required reliability of packet offloading. Index Terms—Markov processes, stochastic processes, wireless sensor networks. Ç...|$|R

40|$|Life-history and {{physiology}} of post-diapause and directly developing offspring in Daphnia {{were compared to}} determine differences in life-history pattern between offspring origins, identify the basic traits effecting pattern distinction, assess the consequencies of differing life-history for relative fitness, and qualify this seasonal phenomenon. Although the size of ex-ephippial hatchlings {{was positively correlated with}} maternal size, ephippia produced by differently sized females of D. magna yielded neonates which body size and it’s variation were similar to those for the first-clutch parthenogenetic neonates produced under high food conditions. Otherwise, post-diapause neonates of D. pulex were larger than first-clutch parthenogenetic neonates and varied in size close to that for neonates from the later clutches. Ex-ephippial offspring showed elevated metabolic activity. Under rich food, they grew faster during juvenile development and were larger at maturation than parthenogenetic females. Post-diapause offspring of D. magna showed higher juvenile growth rates also at limited food availability. Female origins during early maturity differed in resource allocation strategy. A greater allocation to progeny in offspring exiting diapause, however, resulted in increased progeny numbers and higher relative fitness only under rich food environments. Whereas, parthenogenetic females of D. magna exhibited a trend for higher fitness across limited food concentrations. For D. pulex, variability of fitness across differing nutritional environments was lower in directly developing females than that for ex-ephippial offspring. Higher metabolic activity in combination with small initial size resulted in lower resistance to starvation of post-diapause offspring of D. magna. Descendants of female origins in this species showed similar fitness. We conclude that although some traits of ex-ephippial offspring in comparison to parthenogenetic ones may differ across Daphnia species, the life-history strategy of post-diapause females in Daphnia is the same. Ex-ephippial females are adapted to predictable optimal conditions, whereas parthenogenetic females are adapted to unpredictably varying environment. Daphnia have evolved two alternative seasonal phenotypes matching environmental conditions in which they occur, and perform in accordance with predictions of seasonal polyphenism. Due to higher metabolic activity, which must lead to increased resource acquisition and probably is associated to larger allocation to progeny, post-diapause females are superior to directly developing offspring under high food conditions, which are expected during early season, but inferior under limiting food environments, which frequently occur later in the season. In seasonal climate, the <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> <b>resource</b> acquisition with respect to resource availability may be a general evolutionary trend for multivoltine organisms resulting in a seasonal polyphenism...|$|R
