5|$|A Tag Team {{match for}} the NWA World Tag Team Championship between the champions, Team Canada (Bobby Roode and Eric Young), and the 3Live Kru (B.G. James and Konnan) (3LK) followed. The match went back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two teams with each taking {{advantage}} of the pace multiple times. The 3LK won the match and the championship by pinfall after Konnan lifted Roode up in the air, sitdown, and forced Roode's face into the mat.|$|E
5|$|Each {{level in}} the game is {{intended}} to have a unique theme, in either fiction or game mechanic. In one level, the player is confronted with two factions each with their own assassination target, and may use the level's reoccurring dust storms for cover. In another, time distortion is introduced as the player traverses an abandoned mansion in ruins. The player is given a device that lets them glimpse three years into the past, where the mansion is still occupied and guards roam, and can shift back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two points in time.|$|E

5|$|Nuaym's stratagem worked. After consulting, the Confederate leaders sent Ikrimah to the Qurayza, {{signalling}} {{a united}} invasion of Medina. The Qurayza, however, demanded hostages as {{a guarantee that}} the Confederacy would not desert them. The Confederacy, considering that the Qurayza might give the hostage to Muhammad, refused. Messages were repeatedly sent back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> parties, but each held to its position stubbornly.|$|E
5|$|Some of the charged {{particles}} do {{get into the}} magnetosphere. These spiral around field lines, bouncing back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> poles several times per second. In addition, positive ions slowly drift westward and negative ions drift eastward, giving rise to a ring current. This current reduces the magnetic field at the Earth's surface. Particles that penetrate the ionosphere and collide with the atoms there give rise to {{the lights of the}} aurorae and also emit X-rays.|$|E
5|$|The figure {{eventually}} {{turns to}} {{its right to}} look at the hand. By this time, the leaves outside are still. The figure turns {{to look at the}} camera, now steady, again briefly, then back to its hand. After a series of jump cuts in which they turn rapidly back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two positions, the figure looks directly at the camera and points to it.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the past}} 50 years, Sarnia's voters have been moderate, {{and the party}} {{affiliation}} of its Members of Parliament, both provincial and federal, has swung back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> largely <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Liberal <b>and</b> Progressive Conservative parties (a New Democrat was elected in their 1990 provincial wave).|$|R
50|$|The use of reenactments {{and real}} footage {{sometimes}} {{results in the}} skewing of how close hunt and prey teams really get to each other. This is commonly seen when the camera switches back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>between</b> views. <b>The</b> reenactments tend to show teams much closer to each other than corresponding player mounted cameras.|$|R
5|$|Although Du Bois {{generally}} endorsed socialist principles, {{his politics}} were strictly pragmatic: in 1929, Du Bois endorsed Democrat Jimmy Walker {{for mayor of}} New York, rather than the socialist Norman Thomas, believing that Walker could do more immediate good for blacks, even though Thomas' platform was more consistent with Du Bois's views. Throughout the 1920s, Du Bois and the NAACP shifted support back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Republican Party and the Democratic Party, induced by promises from the candidates to fight lynchings, improve working conditions, or support voting rights in the South; invariably, the candidates failed to deliver on their promises.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of Part One, Ko Kitamura, son of the owner of Kitamura Sports, lives in the same {{neighborhood}} as the batting center run by the Tsukishima family. Due to their proximity and the relationship between their businesses, the Kitamura and Tsukishima families have been close for many years, and their children go back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two homes. Because Ko and Wakaba are the same age and always together, Aoba is jealous of all the time Ko spends with her older sister. Aoba is a natural pitcher with excellent form, and Ko secretly trains to become as good as she is, even while publicly showing little interest in baseball. Then Wakaba dies in a swimming accident at a summer camp during fifth grade.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} four years, neither Henry nor the barons were able to restore {{stability}} in England, and power swung back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> different factions. One of the priorities for the new regime was to settle the long-running dispute with France and, {{at the end of}} 1259, Henry and Eleanor left for Paris to negotiate the final details of a peace treaty with King Louis, escorted by Simon de Montfort and much of the baronial government. Under the treaty, Henry gave up any claim to his family's lands in the north of France, but was confirmed as the legitimate ruler of Gascony and various neighbouring territories in the south, giving homage and recognising Louis as his feudal lord for these possessions.|$|E
25|$|The next {{match was}} a Stinkface match <b>between</b> <b>The</b> Kat and Terri. After back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> action <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two women, The Kat gained the {{advantage}} after she performed a powerslam on Terri and then threw Terri into the turnbuckle and delivered a Stinkface on {{her for the}} win.|$|R
5|$|The next {{match was}} a {{standard}} {{match for the}} WWE Cruiserweight Championship, in which Paul London defended the title against Chavo Guerrero.

5|$|The {{majority}} of these emissions {{are thought to be}} produced by a mechanism called Cyclotron Maser Instability, which develops close to the auroral regions, when electrons bounce back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> poles. The electrons involved in the generation of radio waves are probably those carrying currents from the poles of the planet to the magnetodisk. The intensity of Jovian radio emissions usually varies smoothly with time; however, Jupiter periodically emits short and powerful bursts (S bursts), which can outshine all other components. The total emitted power of the DAM component is about 100GW, while the power of all other HOM/KOM components is about 10GW. In comparison, the total power of Earth's radio emissions is about 0.1GW.|$|E
5|$|This complex {{scenario}} {{leads to}} the generation of many variants of HIV in a single infected patient {{in the course of}} one day. This variability is compounded when a single cell is simultaneously infected by two or more different strains of HIV. When simultaneous infection occurs, the genome of progeny virions may be composed of RNA strands from two different strains. This hybrid virion then infects a new cell where it undergoes replication. As this happens, the reverse transcriptase, by jumping back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two different RNA templates, will generate a newly synthesized retroviral DNA sequence that is a recombinant between the two parental genomes. This recombination is most obvious when it occurs between subtypes.|$|E
5|$|By 1854, {{when it was}} incorporated, Crescent City had a {{population}} of 800 but no road leading inland. The Crescent City and Yreka Plank and Turnpike Company was incorporated at a meeting on June 10, and a survey was completed in October, but work stopped with the Panic of 1855. The corporation was revived in December 1856 as the Crescent City Plank Road and Turnpike Company, began construction of a plank road in 1857, and opened the road in May 1858. This road, shown on USGS topographic maps as Wimer Road, led northeast from Crescent City to the Smith River, {{where there was a}} toll booth, and then took a generally northerly route to near the state line, where it turned east, crossing back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> states, to Oregon Mountain. There it turned northeast, following the Illinois River and branches past O'Brien and Waldo to north of Kerby. The final stretch ran easterly to Jacksonville via Wilderville, along the present US 199, Fish Hatchery Road, and OR 238.|$|E

5|$|The third {{match was}} between Rey Mysterio and Chavo Guerrero for the WWE Cruiserweight Championship. Guerrero gained the early advantage, as he applied various {{submission}} holds to Mysterio's knee, including a single leg Boston crab and an Argentine leglock. After a back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> match <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two, Mysterio pinned Guerrero with a sunset flip {{to retain the}} title.|$|R
5|$|Davis {{was born}} and raised in Longview, Texas. He {{attended}} Navarro Junior College and was selected by the Texas Rangers in the fifth round of the 2006 MLB draft. Davis ascended quickly through the Rangers' minor league system, getting named their Minor League Player of the Year in 2007. He was called up in the middle of 2008 and had a strong start to his major league career. He was the Rangers' starting first baseman for 92 games in 2009 and hit 21 home runs, but a low batting average and a tendency to strike out left the Rangers dissatisfied with him. Because of this, the Rangers sent Davis back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> minors and the majors over the next two years and left him off their playoff roster in 2010. On July 30, 2011, they traded him to the Baltimore Orioles with Tommy Hunter for Koji Uehara.|$|E
5|$|Day of the Tentacle Remastered {{retains its}} {{two-dimensional}} cartoon-style art, redrawn at higher resolution for modern computers. The high resolution character art was updated {{by a team}} led by Yujin Keim with consultation of Ahern and Chan. Keim's team used many of the original sketches of characters and assets from the two and emulated their style with improvements for modern graphics systems. Matt Hanson worked on recreating the background assets in high resolution. As with the Grim Fandango remaster, the player can switch back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> original graphics and the high-resolution version. The game includes a more streamlined interaction menu, a command wheel akin to the approach used in Broken Age, but the player can opt to switch back to the original interface. The game's soundtrack has been redone within MIDI adapted to work with the iMUSE system. There is an option to listen to commentary from the original creators, including Schafer, Grossman, Chan, McConnell, Ahern, and Bajakian. The remaster contains the fully playable version of the original Maniac Mansion, though no enhancements have been made to that game-within-a-game.|$|E
5|$|During the {{courtroom}} sections, the player defends their client and cross-examines the witnesses. They can move back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> statements in each testimony; {{if they find}} a contradiction between a statement and the evidence, they can point out the contradiction by presenting a relevant piece of evidence or character profile. The player can also choose to question a statement, which sometimes leads {{to changes in the}} testimony. A life bar, representing the judge's patience, is shown in the upper right corner of the screen. If the player presents incorrect evidence or profiles, the bar will decrease; if it reaches zero, the player loses and their client is declared guilty. The bar will also decrease if the player makes mistakes while trying to break psyche-locks; however, the player can not lose while trying to break psyche-locks. 50% of the life bar gets restored when the player manages to break a psyche-lock, and it gets fully restored when the player completes an episode.|$|E
50|$|Koch Hajo, {{the eastern}} kingdom, soon {{came under attack}} from the Mughal, and the region went back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> for <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Mughal <b>and</b> the Ahoms, finally {{settling}} with the Ahoms. Koch Bihar, the western kingdom, first befriended the Mughals and then the British, and the rulers maintained the princely state {{till the end of}} the British rule.|$|R
50|$|The third {{match was}} between Rey Mysterio and Chavo Guerrero for the WWE Cruiserweight Championship. Guerrero gained the early advantage, as he applied various {{submission}} holds to Mysterio's knee, including a single leg Boston crab and an Argentine leglock.

50|$|In 2008, the Fox TV show Americas Most Wanted {{mentioned}} the genre while depicting {{the case of}} a criminal wanted for murder and trafficking, who may be traveling back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>between</b> Mexico <b>and</b> <b>the</b> United States.|$|R
5|$|In the {{courtroom}} trials, the player aims {{to prove their}} clients' innocence. In order to do so, they cross-examine witnesses; during these cross-examinations, the player aims to find lies and inconsistencies in the witnesses' testimonies. They are {{able to go back}} <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> different statements in the testimony, and can press the witness for more details on a statement. When the player finds an inconsistency, they can present a piece of evidence that contradicts the statement. In the Nintendo DS version, the player can choose to press and present by using vocal commands, and in the Wii version, players have the option to present evidence by swinging the Wii Remote. At certain points, the player has to answer questions from the judge, the witnesses, or the prosecutor through a multiple-choice answer selection, or by presenting evidence that supports Phoenix's claims. On the screen, a number of exclamation marks are shown; if the player presents an incorrect piece of evidence, one of the exclamation marks disappear. If all disappear, the client is found guilty and the player must restart. When the player solves a case, they unlock a new one to play.|$|E
5|$|Jourdan's {{orders were}} to take the army into Germany and secure {{strategic}} positions, particularly on the roads through Stockach and Schaffhausen, at the western-most border of Lake Constance. Similarly, as commander of the Army of Helvetia, AndrÃ© MassÃ©na would acquire strategic positions in Switzerland, in particular the St. Gotthard Pass, the passes above Feldkirch, particularly Maienfeld (St. Luciensteig), and hold the central plateau in and around ZÃ¼rich and Winterthur. These positions would prevent the Allies of the Second Coalition from moving troops back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> northern Italian and German theaters, and insure French access to these strategic passes. Ultimately, this positioning would allow the French to control all western roads leading to and from Vienna. Finally, to complete Vienna's isolation, the army of Mayence would sweep through the north, blocking further access to and from Vienna {{from any of the}} northern Provinces, or from Britain.|$|E
5|$|The Hajj is {{associated}} with the life of Islamic prophet Muhammad from the 7th century, but the ritual of pilgrimage to Mecca is considered by Muslims to stretch back thousands of years to the time of Abraham. During Hajj, pilgrims join processions {{of hundreds of thousands of}} people, who simultaneously converge on Mecca for the week of the Hajj, and perform a series of rituals: each person walks counter-clockwise seven times around the Kaaba (the cube-shaped building and the direction of prayer for the Muslims), runs back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> hills of Safa and Marwah, drinks from the Zamzam Well, goes to the plains of Mount Arafat to stand in vigil, spends a night in the plain of Muzdalifa, and performs symbolic stoning of the devil by throwing stones at three pillars. The pilgrims then shave their heads, perform a ritual of animal sacrifice, and celebrate the three-day global festival of Eid al-Adha.|$|E
50|$|Alliance {{continued}} {{to serve on}} the Lisbon, Gibraltar, and Mediterranean station, traveling back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>between</b> Britain <b>and</b> <b>the</b> station.

Back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> action <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two teams {{towards the end of}} the match, where Albert {{delivered}} a Baldo Bomb on Snow, while Test delivered an Elbow drop from the top rope onto Blackman into a pinfall for the win.|$|R
500|$|Before {{the event}} went live on pay-per-view, Val Venis {{defeated}} Matt Hardy in a match taped for Sunday Night Heat. The first match that aired was between Shelton Benjamin and Ric Flair. After back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> action <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two, Flair attempted to use brass knuckles on Benjamin but Benjamin splashed Flair from behind. Benjamin then performed a [...] diving clothesline on Flair for the win.|$|R
