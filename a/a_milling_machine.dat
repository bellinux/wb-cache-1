25|$|<b>A</b> <b>milling</b> <b>machine</b> is {{a machine}} tool {{used for the}} shaping of metal and other solid materials. In {{contrast}} to drilling, where the drill is moved exclusively along its axis, the milling operation uses movement of the rotating cutter sideways as well as 'in and out'. Simeon North is generally credited for inventing and building the earliest, though primitive, milling machine to replace filing operations by about 1816 or even earlier.|$|E
25|$|Leonid Ivanov {{was born}} on 8 August 1909 in Kashira. After graduating from seven years of railway school, Ivanov took adult {{education}} courses {{while working as a}} laborer at the Kashira tram park. In the summer of 1930 he began working at the Krasny Proletary (Red Proletarian) Machine Tool Factory in Moscow as <b>a</b> <b>milling</b> <b>machine</b> operator. He took night school courses at the STANKIN Machine Tool Institute.|$|E
25|$|Single-pass bore {{finishing}} is {{not usually}} done in <b>a</b> <b>milling</b> <b>machine</b> for several reasons. Firstly, most milling machines have only one spindle, so changing the tool more than four to six times can increase cycle times significantly. Secondly, most workpieces that require this process are made on horizontal machining centers (HMC), which reduces float-ability due to gravity. Thirdly, the lubrication may not be sufficient, {{which can lead to}} material build-up between diamonds, diminishing the tool's effectiveness. Finally, if any chips remain from previous operations they can ruin the tool.|$|E

25|$|The {{tools are}} usually mounted in a {{dedicated}} bore finishing machine, however {{they can also}} be mounted in <b>a</b> <b>milling</b> <b>machine.</b> In either case the tool, workpiece, or both are rotated and the tool is plunged into the bore and removed. The part is then transferred to the next station or a larger tool is mounted and a larger bore machined, and the process repeated until the desired bore geometry is reached. The number of tools required to achieve the desired bore size is dependent on the workpiece material, the amount of stock to be removed and geometrical requirements, with four to six tool pieces being common. Each tool is progressively larger than the last, but in diminishing increments; as the stock removal is reduced, so is the tool's diamond grit size.|$|E

2500|$|The use of <b>a</b> <b>milling</b> <b>machine</b> adds {{costs that}} are {{factored}} into the manufacturing process. [...] Each time {{the machine is}} used coolant is also used, which must be periodically added {{in order to prevent}} breaking bits. [...] A milling bit must also be changed as needed in order to prevent damage to the material. [...] Time is the biggest factor for costs. [...] Complex parts can require hours to complete, while very simple parts take only minutes. [...] This in turn varies the production time as well, as each part will require different amounts of time.|$|E
2500|$|Between 1800 and 1820, new {{industrial}} {{tools that}} rapidly increased {{the quality and}} efficiency of manufacturing emerged. Simeon North suggested using division of labor {{to increase the speed}} with which a complete pistol could be manufactured which {{led to the development of}} <b>a</b> <b>milling</b> <b>machine</b> in 1798. In 1819, Thomas Blanchard created a lathe that could reliably cut irregular shapes, like those needed for arms manufacture. By 1822, Captain John H. Hall had developed a system using machine tools, division of labor, and an unskilled workforce to produce a breech-loading rifle—a process that came to be known as [...] "Armory practice" [...] in the U.S. and the American system of manufacturing in England.|$|E
2500|$|Milling is {{the complex}} shaping of metal or other {{materials}} by removing material {{to form the}} final shape. It is generally done on <b>a</b> <b>milling</b> <b>machine,</b> a power-driven machine that in its basic form consists of a milling cutter that rotates about the spindle axis (like a drill), and a worktable that can move in multiple directions (usually two dimensions [...] relative to the workpiece). The spindle usually moves in the z axis. [...] It is possible to raise the table (where the workpiece rests). [...] Milling machines may be operated manually or under computer numerical control (CNC), and can perform {{a vast number of}} complex operations, such as slot cutting, planing, drilling and threading, rabbeting, routing, etc. Two common types of mills are the horizontal mill and vertical mill.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{handheld}} power routers {{were invented}} in 1915 and were Jet Motor Hand Routers, called Onsruters. The name derives {{from a combination}} of the inventor's last name [...] "Onsrud" [...] and the term [...] "router". The Onsruter married a router plane with an endmill to create the first handheld power router. The idea for the Onsruter started when a rail road company decided they wanted to power the front light on a Steam Locomotive using exhaust steam from the engine. Oscar Onsrud and his son Rudy came up with, and submitted, a design for a jet motor (air turbine) to generate the power for the light, however, they failed to win the contract. A few months later Rudy was talking with a friend about his frustrations making the groove {{in the bottom of a}} cane bottom chair using a router plane. A spark went off in Rudy's head that he could re-purpose the jet motor, which he had spent so much time developing, to run on compressed air and spin a modified endmill and make the routed groove easily. The modified endmills would have to spin at 30,000 RPM, instead of the 3,000 RPM of <b>a</b> <b>milling</b> <b>machine,</b> in order to cut wood and not burn it. These bits also needed a steeper rake and clearance angle to evacuate the chips than needed on a traditional endmill. These new bits became known as router bits or router cutters (UK).|$|E
