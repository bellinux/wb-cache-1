5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in September 1939, works to complete the electrification of the LNER lines were slowed or halted. The line from Finchley Central to Edgware closed for reconstruction on 11 September 1939. Northern line services were extended from East Finchley to High Barnet on 14 April 1940, and started serving the deep level platforms at Highgate on 19 January 1941, though not <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> station buildings had been completed. The surface platforms at Highgate continued to be served by LNER steam trains.|$|E
5|$|Punk {{then used}} {{the group to}} attack Randy Orton, blaming him for prematurely ending Punk's first World Heavyweight Championship reign in 2008. Punk and The Nexus cost Orton his match with The Miz for the WWE Championship at the Royal Rumble in January 2011. Orton, in turn, responded by taking out <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> Nexus members by punting them in the head, leaving Punk alone as the sole {{surviving}} member of the group. This led to a WrestleMania XXVII match and a Last Man Standing match at Extreme Rules, both of which Punk lost.|$|E
5|$|Like other {{buildings}} in the new World Trade Center complex, One World Trade Center includes sustainable architecture features. Much of the building's structure and interior is built from recycled materials, including gypsum boards and ceiling tiles; around 80percent of the tower's waste products are recycled. Although the roof area of any tower is limited, the building implements a rainwater collection and recycling scheme for its cooling systems. The building's PureCell phosphoric acid fuel cells generate 4.8megawatts (MW) of power, and its waste steam generates electricity. The New York Power Authority selected UTC Power to provide the tower's fuel cell system, {{which was one of}} the largest fuel cell installations in the world once completed. The tower also makes use of off-site hydroelectric and wind power. The windows are made of an ultra-clear glass, which allows maximum sunlight to pass through; the interior lighting is equipped with dimmers that automatically dim the lights on sunny days, reducing energy costs. Like <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> facilities at the World Trade Center site, One World Trade Center is heated by steam, with limited oil or natural gas utilities on-site. One World Trade Center is expected to receive a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold Certification, making it one of the most environmentally sustainable skyscrapers in the world.|$|E

5|$|Season 6 {{focuses on}} Rachel Berry, who returns to McKinley after her {{television}} pilot fails. She decides to reconstitute the glee club with all-new McKinley students and with Kurt's help. Will Schuester is now coaching rival club Vocal Adrenaline, while Blaine is coaching the Dalton Academy Warblers. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> main cast {{members from the}} fifth season have returned to guest star status in this final season when they appear; Amber Riley as Mercedes rejoins the main cast, and Dot-Marie Jones as Coach Beiste joins the main cast for the first time. The cast members deal with gay marriage, gender identity, transitioning and other social issues. The newly reconstituted club wins the Nationals competition, Sue is fired as principal and Will is hired to be the principal of a McKinley High repurposed as a magnet arts school, with Sam as the new director of New Directions. The finale jumps five years into the future: Rachel has married Jesse St. James (Jonathan Groff), wins a Tony Award, and is a surrogate mother for Kurt and Blaine (who are themselves Broadway stars). Artie has directed Tina in a film, Mercedes is a highly successful recording artist, and Sue has just been re-elected Vice President of the United States. The McKinley auditorium is renamed after Finn.|$|E
25|$|With the {{collapse}} of the Soviet Union in 1991, five Central Asian countries gained independence — Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan. In <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> states, former Communist Party officials retained power as local strongmen.|$|E

25|$|In 1636 <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> England colonies went to {{war with}} the Pequot of southeastern Connecticut, {{practically}} wiping them out. In 1646 the Long Parliament gave the missionary John Eliot a commission and funds to preach to the Wampanoags. He succeeded in converting a large number. The colonial government placed the converted Indians (known as Praying Indians) in a ring of villages around Boston as a defensive strategy. The oldest such village, Natick, was built in 1651.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, Chase {{starred in}} the role of Samara Morgan in the feature film, The Ring. Chase was awarded the 2003 Best Villain award at the MTV Movie Awards for her performance, beating out Mike Myers, Colin Farrell, Willem Dafoe and Daniel Day-Lewis. In the sequel to The Ring, The Ring Two (2005), Chase was {{credited}} for her role as Samara Morgan because of the use of archive footage from the first Ring, but Kelly Stables performed <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> footage.|$|E
25|$|The {{left wing}} won {{control of the}} New York Joint Board, the body that coordinated the {{activities}} of <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> York City ILGWU locals {{in all aspects of}} the industry, that year. When it called a general strike on July 1, 1926 Dubinsky was given a nominal role in the strike, reflecting his power base in the cutters' union, but was largely sidelined. That strike was a disastrous failure, leading to the rout of leftist leadership from the Joint Board and ultimately from the industry, other than the independent International Fur Workers Union.|$|E

25|$|The {{competition}} will be further reorganised in 2016 {{with a permanent}} sixth team from South Africa and new entries based in Argentina and Japan. At that time, the {{competition will}} split into Australasian and African groups (with the latter including the Argentine and Japanese teams), each in turn being divided into two conferences. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> Zealand teams will form one conference.

25|$|By 1686, King James II {{had become}} {{concerned}} about the increasingly independent ways of the colonies, including their self-governing charters, their open flouting of the Navigation Acts, and their growing military power. He therefore established the Dominion of New England, an administrative union comprising <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> England colonies. In 1688, the former Dutch colonies of New York, East New Jersey, and West New Jersey {{were added to the}} Dominion. The union was imposed from the outside and contrary to the rooted democratic tradition of the region, and it was highly unpopular among the colonists.|$|E

25|$|Direct3D 10.1 is an {{incremental}} update of Direct3D 10.0 which shipped with, and required, Windows Vista Service Pack 1. This release mainly sets {{a few more}} image quality standards for graphics vendors, while giving developers more control over image quality. It also adds support for cube map arrays, separate blend modes per-MRT, coverage mask export from a pixel shader, ability to run pixel shader per sample, access to multi-sampled depth buffers and requires that the video card supports Shader Model 4.1 or higher and 32-bit floating-point operations. Direct3D 10.1 still fully supports Direct3D 10 hardware, {{but in order to}} utilize <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> features, updated hardware is required.|$|E
25|$|Under the new system, {{the pound}} was {{retained}} but {{was divided into}} 100 new pence, denoted by the symbol p. New coinage was issued alongside the old coins. The 5p and 10p coins were introduced in April 1968 and were the same size, composition, and value as the shilling and two shillings coins in circulation with them. In October 1969 the 50p coin was introduced, with the 10s note withdrawn on 20 November 1970. This {{reduced the number of}} new coins that had to be introduced on Decimal Day and meant that the public was already familiar with three of the six new coins. Small booklets were made available containing some or <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> denominations.|$|E

25|$|From late 1941 onward, Professor Farquharson (as well as von Karman, who did {{his work}} at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California) {{continued}} to work on the new bridge design. By 1943, he was working in a specially-designed wind tunnel laboratory built on the University of Washington campus in Seattle. The facility was large enough to house a scale model of the completed bridge as long as , plus section models for further testing. After Farquharson confirmed that Gertie collapsed due to its excessive flexibility and the aerodynamic forces {{as a result of the}} flexibility in her span, testing was then done on designs drawn by Smith. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> designs would feature a deep open stiffening truss instead of a solid plate girder.|$|E
25|$|The leading U.S. cable TV sports {{broadcaster}} ESPN is {{headquartered in}} Bristol, Connecticut. New England has several regional cable networks, including New England Cable News (NECN) and the New England Sports Network (NESN).

Its studios are located in Newton, Massachusetts, outside of Boston, and it maintains bureaus in Manchester, New Hampshire; Hartford, Connecticut; Worcester, Massachusetts; Portland, Maine; and Burlington, Vermont. In Connecticut, Litchfield, Fairfield, and New Haven counties it also broadcasts New York based news programs—this {{is due in part}} to the immense influence New York has on this region's economy and culture, and also to give Connecticut broadcasters the ability to compete with overlapping media coverage from New York-area broadcasters.|$|E
25|$|Since the Portuguese {{wanted to}} keep the line of {{demarcation}} of Alcaçovas running east and west along a latitude south of Cape Bojador, a compromise was worked out and incorporated in the Treaty of Tordesillas, dated on 7 June 1494, in which the globe was split into two hemispheres dividing Spanish and Portuguese claims. These actions gave Spain exclusive rights to establish colonies in <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> World from north to south (except Brazil), as well as the easternmost parts of Asia. The treaty of Tordesillas was confirmed by Pope Julius II in the bull Ea quae pro bono pacis on 24 January 1506. Spain's expansion and colonization was driven by economic influences, a yearning to improve national prestige, and a desire to spread Catholicism into the New World.|$|E
