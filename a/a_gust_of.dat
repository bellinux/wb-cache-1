5|$|Erin {{produced}} moderate winds across Newfoundland, {{including a}} maximum sustained wind report of 53mph (85km/h) with <b>a</b> <b>gust</b> <b>of</b> 67mph (108km/h) at Cape Race. The storm also produced moderate amounts of precipitation, peaking at 5.1inches (131mm) at Sagona Island. Along the coast, {{the passage of}} the storm led to wave heights of up to 30feet (9.3m), while offshore a buoy recorded a wave height of 47feet (14.2m). No damage was reported in Canada.|$|E
5|$|Intense rainbands {{spread across}} the state's eastern coastline; Hillsboro Inlet Light near Fort Lauderdale {{recorded}} sustained winds of 91mph (147km/h), and St. Augustine Light recorded <b>a</b> <b>gust</b> <b>of</b> 87mph (141km/h). Further inland, Jacksonville reported sustained winds of 72mph (116km/h) with gusts to 82mph (133km/h). In Jacksonville, Hurricane King left widespread power outages due to the winds knocking over trees and power lines. Street flooding was reported, and around 30families required evacuation due to the storm.|$|E
5|$|Most {{species have}} 12 ovules and 36 seeds, {{although}} some {{species such as}} N. bulbocodium have more, up {{to a maximum of}} 60. Seeds take five to six weeks to mature. The seeds of sections Jonquilla and Bulbocodium are wedge-shaped and matte black, while those of other sections are ovate and glossy black. <b>A</b> <b>gust</b> <b>of</b> wind or contact with a passing animal is sufficient to disperse the mature seeds.|$|E

5|$|The {{interaction}} between Hattie and the ridge of high pressure to its north produced sustained winds of 20mph (35km/h) across most of Florida, with <b>a</b> <b>gust</b> <b>of</b> 72mph (116km/h) reported at Hillsboro Inlet Light; the winds caused some beach erosion in the state. The U.S. Weather Bureau issued a small craft warning {{for the west}} and east Florida coastlines, as well as northward to Brunswick, Georgia.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Karen {{produced}} {{light to}} moderate winds across Atlantic Canada, peaking at 47mph (76km/h) with <b>a</b> <b>gust</b> <b>of</b> 64mph (103km/h) in Cape George in Antigonish County, Nova Scotia, {{along with a}} 26mph (42km/h) report in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. Later, in Newfoundland and Nova Scotia, the storm system that absorbed Hurricane Noel produced strong winds that downed several trees and power lines which resulted in power outages.|$|E

5|$|Although Richard tracked {{north of}} Honduras, strong winds along the {{coastline}} downed trees and power lines. Mudslides stranded up to 15,000 people across 40 different towns. The island of Roatán received <b>a</b> <b>gust</b> <b>of</b> 58mph (93km/h). Farther {{north and west}} in Belize, the Belize Zoo and Tropical Education Center—popular attractions for tourists—were heavily damaged. About 80% of the grapefruit and nearly 25% of the orange crop were lost there. Two deaths were observed: one man was killed when his boat capsized in rough seas, while a second man was mauled to death by a jaguar that escaped after a tree mangled its cage. The damage cost topped $80 million.|$|E
5|$|On the Eastern Shore of Maryland, Hurricane Isabel {{produced}} a storm surge peaking at 8feet (2.4m) on the Chesapeake Bay in Hoopers Island and 6.5feet (2m) on the Atlantic coast in Ocean City. The {{track of the}} hurricane to the west funneled into the bay and was so strong it negated the normal tide cycle in the bay. Tolchester Beach recorded a record-breaking high tide of 7.91feet (2.4m) above mean low water. Rainfall in the Maryland portion of the Delmarva Peninsula reached 3.2inches (81mm) in Steeles Neck. The large circulation of the hurricane produced strong winds across the area, including maximum sustained winds of 52mph (84km/h) and <b>a</b> <b>gust</b> <b>of</b> 66mph (106km/h) in Cambridge.|$|E
5|$|Quickly {{accelerating}} northwards, Helene made landfall on Newfoundland late on September29. Rainfall {{peaked at}} 3.05in (77.5mm) in northern {{parts of the}} island, while rainfall amounts were generally minimal across the Avalon Peninsula. A weather station in Naval Station Argentia reported maximum sustained winds of 60mph (100km/h) and <b>a</b> <b>gust</b> <b>of</b> 82mph (132km/h). The winds severed communications in southwestern Newfoundland and cut communications in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador from the mainland. Bell Island was {{cut off from the}} rest of Newfoundland due to rough seas generated by Helene, which resulted in the destruction of piers and lack of boat service. Damage caused by the hurricane on the island were estimated to be in excess of C$100,000.|$|E

5|$|Swaying {{behaviour}} is practised by highly cryptic {{animals such as}} {{the leafy}} sea dragon and the stick insect Extatosoma tiaratum. These animals resemble vegetation with their coloration, strikingly disruptive body outlines with leaflike appendages, {{and the ability to}} sway effectively like the plants that they mimic. E. tiaratum actively sways back and forth or side to side when disturbed or when there is <b>a</b> <b>gust</b> <b>of</b> wind, with a frequency distribution like foliage rustling in the wind. This behaviour may represent motion crypsis, preventing detection by predators, or motion masquerade, promoting misclassification (as something other than prey), or a combination of the two, and has accordingly also been described as a form of motion camouflage.|$|E
5|$|This cyclone brought {{widespread}} rain to Tamil Nadu as it formed {{and to the}} Andaman and Nicobar Islands as it moved over the Bay of Bengal. After its landfall it brought severe rains to West Bengal, Assam and East Pakistan. The highest recorded rainfall in India was at Shillong where 220mm (8.6inches) fell on October 24. <b>A</b> <b>gust</b> <b>of</b> 105km/h (65mph) was recorded in Calcutta as the storm passed by to the east, where it caused {{the failure of the}} power supply.|$|E
5|$|Around noon, as {{a result}} of poor {{coordination}} and signaling, the Swedish line unexpectedly turned toward the allied fleet. When the flagship Kronan came about in the maneuver it suddenly heeled over and began to take in water. According to master gunner Anders Gyllenspak, the sails were not reefed and the ship leaned over so hard that water flooded in through the lower gunports. As the ship was leaning over, <b>a</b> <b>gust</b> <b>of</b> wind pushed the ship on her side, bringing her masts and sails down in line with the surface of the sea. Shortly afterwards, the gunpowder store exploded and ripped the forward section of the starboard side apart. Kronan quickly lost buoyancy and sank, taking most of her 850-man crew with her.|$|E

5|$|As Typhoon Tingting {{approached}} the Mariana Islands, three Chinese women drowned in rough seas {{produced by the}} storm in Saipan. On June28, Tingting produced strong winds throughout the region. Sustained winds on Guam reached 82km/h (51mph) with gusts to 106km/h (66mph); a pressure of 994.6hPa (mbar) was also recorded on the island. Although located closer {{to the center of}} Tingting, Rota reported lower winds than Guam; the highest sustained wind reached 70km/h (44mph) with gusts of 93km/h (58mph). Due to the lack of sufficient observations on Tinian, the highest sustained winds recorded were suspected to be lower than what they really were. Winds of 56km/h (35mph) were recorded several times with gusts to 84km/h (52mph). Sustained winds on Saipan were recorded up to 100km/h (62mph) with gusts to 124km/h (77mph); a pressure of 984.9hPa (mbar) was also recorded. The highest winds during Typhoon Tingting throughout the Mariana Islands were measured on Pagan Island where 106km/h (66mph) sustained winds were recorded along with <b>a</b> <b>gust</b> <b>of</b> 212km/h (132mph).|$|E
5|$|During the storm's passage, {{there were}} 61daily {{rainfall}} records broken by Nabi's precipitation across Japan. The rains from Nabi caused significant slope failures and large accumulations of driftwood. The amount of sediment {{displaced by the}} rains was estimated at 4,456m3/km2, over four times the yearly average. A total of 630m3 (2,066ft3) of driftwood was recorded. However, the rainfall also helped to end water restrictions in Kagawa and Tokushima prefectures. In addition to the heavy rainfall, Nabi produced gusty winds on the Japan mainland, peaking at 115km/h (72mph) in Muroto. A station on Tobishima in the Sea of Japan recorded <b>a</b> <b>gust</b> <b>of</b> 119km/h (74mph). The typhoon spawned a F1 tornado in Miyazaki, which damaged several buildings. In Wajima, Ishikawa, Nabi produced a Foehn wind, causing temperatures to rise quickly.|$|E
5|$|Erika {{produced}} light rainfall across southern Texas, peaking at 3.83inches (97mm) in Sabinal, {{though most}} locations reported {{less than two}} inches (50mm) of precipitation. In addition, weather radar estimated isolated accumulations of 4 to 6inches (100 to 150mm) of precipitation in Kenedy and Brooks Counties. Sustained winds from Erika in south Texas peaked at 39mph (62km/h) in Brownsville, where <b>a</b> <b>gust</b> <b>of</b> 47mph (75km/h) was also recorded. Strong waves were reported northwards to Corpus Christi. The storm caused minor flooding and beach erosion along South Padre Island. Strong wind gusts of up to 60mph (95km/h) caused isolated, minor wind damage in south Texas, including in South Padre Island, where the winds damaged {{the roof of a}} business. The winds also uprooted a large tree and caused limb damage to several small- to medium-sized trees in Brownsville. In Texas, damage totaled to $10,000 (2003USD, $ USD).|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Erin {{developed}} from a tropical wave on September 1, and strengthened to a 60mph (95km/h) tropical storm {{as it moved}} to the west-northwest. After weakening due to wind shear, the remnants re-organized into a tropical depression the next day, and Erin strengthened into a hurricane on September 9 while moving northwestward. The hurricane quickly intensified and reached peak winds of 120mph (195km/h) later on September 9. A trough turned Erin to the northeast, and after passing just east of Cape Race, Newfoundland it became extratropical on September 15. The extratropical remnant continued northeastward and lost its identity near Greenland on September 17. Hurricane Erin brushed Newfoundland, producing a sustained wind of 53mph (85km/h) with <b>a</b> <b>gust</b> <b>of</b> 67mph (108km/h) at Cape Race. Along the coast, {{the passage of the}} storm led to wave heights of up to 30ft (9.3m).|$|E
5|$|In Nova Scotia, Able {{produced}} hurricane-force winds, {{the only}} land along its path to receive such winds; <b>a</b> <b>gust</b> <b>of</b> 99mph (160km/h) {{was reported in}} Halifax. The hurricane also dropped heavy rainfall, including over 4.92inches (125mm) in Annapolis Valley. Initially there were three fishing boats missing throughout the region, although two later returned to harbor. By August22, the third was still missing over the Grand Banks, which prompted a rescue team {{to search for the}} boat. Many other boats crashed against the coast, and two children died when their raft capsized. Two bridges and several roadways were washed out or flooded, and in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, floodwaters left roadways impassable. On land, Able produced heavy damage estimated at over $1million (CAD), half of which in Annapolis Valley, and split between crops, communications, and fishing industries.|$|E
5|$|On Grand Bahama Island, Wilma {{produced}} sustained {{winds of}} 155km/h (95mph) and <b>a</b> <b>gust</b> <b>of</b> 178km/h (111mph). The hurricane also produced a storm surge of over 3.7m (12ft), reportedly {{as high as}} 6.1m (20ft) along the southwestern portion of the island. The surge, which moved about 305m (1,000ft) inland, caused large-scale flooding that washed away or destroyed about 800homes. Damage was estimated at $100million (2005USD) on the western portion of the island. Excluding the southwestern region of Grand Bahama, {{the majority of the}} island reported minor wind damage, and the eastern end of the island reported little, or no, damage. Over 7,000people on the island were directly affected by the hurricane, many of whom had not fully recovered from hurricanes Frances and Jeanne during the previous year.|$|E
