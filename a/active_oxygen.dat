40|$|AbstractHuman {{thioredoxin}} is a polypeptide with thiol groups, possessing reducing activity, {{which is}} proved {{to have the}} ability to reduce <b>active</b> <b>oxygens.</b> This study evaluated the effect of human thioredoxin on the ischemia-reperfusion lung injury and the roles of human thioredoxin on <b>active</b> <b>oxygens</b> by chemiluminescence examination. The left hilum of the lung of Japanese white rabbits was occluded for 110 minutes and then reperfused for 90 minutes. Ten, 30, 60, and 90 minutes after reperfusion the right hilum was occluded for 5 minutes and the pulmonary functions of the left lung were examined. The animals were divided into four groups, three ischemia groups and a sham group (without occlusion; n = 6). The ischemia groups received human thioredoxin, 60 mg/kg (n = 10), N-acetylcysteine, 150 mg/kg (n = 7), or saline solution (control, n = 10) during reperfusion. Three rabbits in the human thioredoxin group and the control group were used to measure <b>active</b> <b>oxygens</b> with a cypridina luciferin analog. An additional group of reperfused lungs (n = 3) that were given superoxide dismutase after 110 minutes of ischemia was established to identify chemiluminescence examination. Compared with the sham group, reperfusion after 110 minutes of ischemia produced a significant lung injury in the control group. Among the ischemia groups, the human thioredoxin group showed significantly higher arterial oxygen tension at 30, 60, and 90 minutes after reperfusion than the control group, although there was no significant difference between the N-acetylcysteine and control groups. Histologically, intraalveolar exudation, interstitial thickening, and cellular infiltration were seen in the control group, whereas in the thioredoxin group alveolar structure was well preserved. In the measurement of <b>active</b> <b>oxygens</b> the chemiluminescence in the human thioredoxin group was less than that in the control group and as little as that in the group administered superoxide dismutase.

40|$|The {{water-water}} {{cycle in}} chloroplasts is the photoreduction of dioxygen to water in photosystem I (PS I) by the electrons generated in photosystem II (PS II) from water. In the water-water cycle, {{the rate of}} photoreduction of dioxygen in PS I is several orders of magnitude {{lower than those of}} the disproportionation of superoxide catalysed by superoxide dismutase, the reduction of hydrogen peroxide to water catalysed by ascorbate peroxidase, and the reduction of the resulting oxidized forms of ascorbate by reduced ferredoxin or catalysed by either dehydroascorbate reductase or monodehydroascorbate reductase. The water-water cycle therefore effectively shortens the lifetimes of photoproduced superoxide and hydrogen peroxide to suppress the production of hydroxyl radicals, their interactions with the target molecules in chloroplasts, and resulting photoinhibition.
