Because of a dispute with an <b>alpine</b> <b>farmer,</b> there was no skiing on the Wendelstein from 1995 to 1997.|$|E
50|$|The Vorarlberg Greens {{were the}} first to ever win {{mandates}} in an Austrian state assembly election. Already in 1984 they were able to win 13% of the votes in the Vorarlberg state assembly elections, which for that time was an absolute sensation. The charismatic <b>alpine</b> <b>farmer</b> Kaspanaze Simma from Bregenzerwald was the leading candidate, it was mainly due to his efforts why the party was so instantly successful. Because of their strength, the Greens were allowed to form their own parliamentary fraction (Klub), which caused some logistical problems as the newly constructed Landtag building in 1981 only provided space for the traditional three parties (ÖVP, SPÖ, FPÖ), not four. Since the traditional organic farming sector is important in the western Austrian regions, the Greens were able to gain support.|$|E

5000|$|Volksmusik (German: literally, [...] "people's music" [...] or as a Germanic connotative translation, [...] "folk's music") is {{the common}} {{umbrella}} designation {{of a number of}} related styles of traditional folk music from the Alpine regions of Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Slovenia and South Tyrol (Italy). It tends to be dialect-heavy and invokes local and regional lifestyles and traditions, particularly those of the <b>Alpine</b> <b>farmers</b> and peasants.|$|R

5000|$|She was the {{daughter}} of the Faschauner family of <b>Alpine</b> <b>farmers</b> from Maltaberg in the Duchy of Carinthia. A few weeks after her marriage with Jakob Kary in February 1770, her husband died after experiencing acute pain to his upper body. An autopsy revealed that his death was caused by arsenic poisoning. Tried for murder and sorcery before the Gmünd county court, Eva pleaded guilty after about three years of torture. Condemned as a murderer and sentenced to death by decapitation on 20 March 1773, her clemency petition was denied by the superior court in Vienna and she was beheaded.|$|R
50|$|St. Bartholomew's (St. Bartholomä) is a Roman Catholic pilgrimage {{church in}} the Berchtesgadener Land {{district}} of Bavaria in Germany. It is named after Saint Bartholomew the Apostle (Bartholomäus in German), patron of <b>alpine</b> <b>farmers</b> and dairymen. The church {{is located at the}} western shore of the Königssee lake, on the Hirschau peninsula. It can only be reached by ship or after a long hike across the surrounding mountains. A first chapel at the lake was built in 1134 by the Provosts of Berchtesgaden. In 1697 it was rebuilt in a Baroque style with a floor plan modelled on Salzburg Cathedral, two onion domes and a red domed roof. The church features stucco work by the Salzburg artist Joseph Schmidt and a three-apse choir. The altars in the apses are consecrated to Saint Bartholomew, Saint Catherine, and Saint James respectively.|$|R
50|$|The bark {{of common}} alder has {{traditionally}} been used as an astringent, a cathartic, a hemostatic, a febrifuge, a tonic and a restorative (a substance able to restore normal health). A decoction of the bark {{has been used to}} treat swelling, inflammation and rheumatism, as an emetic, and to treat pharyngitis and sore throat. Ground up bark has been used as an ingredient in toothpaste, and the inner bark can be boiled in vinegar to provide a skin wash for treating dermatitis, lice and scabies. The leaves have been used to reduce breast discomfort in nursing mothers and folk remedies advocate the use of the leaves against various forms of cancer. <b>Alpine</b> <b>farmers</b> are said to use the leaves to alleviate rheumatism by placing a heated bag full of leaves on the affected areas. Alder leaves are consumed by cows, sheep, goats and horses though pigs refuse to eat them. According to some people, consumption of alder leaves causes blackening of the tongue and is harmful to horses.|$|R
40|$|Alpine grasslands are an {{important}} source of fodder for the cattle of <b>Alpine</b> <b>farmers.</b> Only during the short summer season can these pastures be used for grazing. With the anticipated climate change, it is likely that plant production – and thus the fodder basis for the cattle – will be influenced. Investigating the dependence of biomass production on topoclimatic factors will allow us to better understand how anticipated climate change may influence this traditional Alpine farming system. Because small-scale topoclimatological variations of the main meteorological variables: temperature, humidity, precipitation, shortwave incoming radiation and wind speed are not easily derived from available long-term climate stations in mountainous terrain, it was our goal to investigate the topoclimatic variations over the pastures belonging to the Alp Weissenstein research station north of the Albula Pass in the eastern Swiss Alps. We present a basic assessment of current topoclimatic conditions as a site characterization for ongoing ecological climate change studies. To be able to link short-term studies with long-term climate records, we related agrometeorological measurements with those of surrounding long-term sites run by MeteoSwiss, both on valley bottoms (Davos, Samedan), and on mountain tops (Weissfluhjoch, Piz Corvatsch). We found that the Davos climate station north of the study area is most closely correlated with the local climate of Alp Weissenstein, although a much closer site (Samedan) exists {{on the other side of}} the Albula Pass. Mountain top stations, however, did not provide a convincing approximation for the climate at Alp Weissenstein. Direct comparisons of near-surface measurements from a set of 11 small weather stations distributed over the domain where cattle and sheep are grazed indicate that nocturnal minimum air temperature and minimum vapor pressure deficit are mostly governed by the altitudinal gradient, whereas daily maxima – including also wind speed – are more strongly depending on vegetation cover and less on the altitude...|$|R
40|$|Farming in the Austrian Alps {{is small}} in scale and {{involves}} {{a high degree}} of manual labor. In the face of structural changes in agriculture, alpine farms are finding it increasingly difficult to remain economically viable. Organic farming presents a promising alternative for <b>alpine</b> <b>farmers</b> because it receives considerable financial support under the Common Agricultural Policy of the European Union. Recent years have seen {{an increase in the number}} of organic farms in Austria in general, and in alpine areas in particular. Using data from an empirical study carried out in the alpine area of Sölktäler, Austria, this paper examines the issues of how closely the regulations and principles of organic farming match farmers' perspectives on sustainable agriculture and whether or not organic farming is capable of building social-ecological resilience for local farms. Qualitative interviews and a series of workshops were used to learn about farmers' "desired system state" with regard to their region, disturbances to this system, and their perspectives on organic farming. The desired system in Sölktäler as formulated by the farmers depicts a vivid farming community that manages a diverse traditional agricultural landscape and performs a number of ecological services. The desired system and the principles of organic farming have several aspects in common, and many management practices and features of the social system support social-ecological resilience. The vulnerability of farms increases, however, when farmers must deal with structural changes in agriculture, the erosion of traditional ecological knowledge, and societal transformation. In conclusion, organic farming is a tool that can be used to build social-ecological resilience for Sölktäler farms, because it secures economic funding for the area and makes it possible to sustain environmentally benign practices. What remains is the question of whether the farming community is capable of reorganizing the social system under the pressures of modernization so that the desired system state can be reached...|$|R
