5|$|Heinrich Prinz zu Sayn-Wittgenstein (14 August 1916– 21 January 1944) was a German night {{fighter pilot}} and flying ace during World War II. An ace is a {{military}} aviator credited with shooting down five or more enemy aircraft in aerial combat. At {{the time of his}} death, Sayn-Wittgenstein was the highest-scoring night fighter pilot in the Luftwaffe <b>and</b> <b>still</b> <b>the</b> third highest by the end of World War II, with 83 aerial victories to his credit.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} the Jaffna kingdom is obscure <b>and</b> <b>still</b> <b>the</b> subject of {{controversy}} among historians. Among mainstream historians, such as K. M. de Silva, S. Pathmanathan and Karthigesu Indrapala, the widely accepted {{view is that the}} Kingdom of the Aryacakravarti dynasty in Jaffna began in 1215 with the invasion of a previously unknown chieftain called Magha, who claimed to be from Kalinga in modern India. He deposed the ruling Parakrama Pandyan II, a foreigner from the Pandyan Dynasty who was ruling the Kingdom of Polonnaruwa at the time {{with the help of his}} soldiers and mercenaries from the Kalinga, modern Kerala and Damila (Tamil Nadu) regions in India.|$|E
5|$|Baseball, {{widely known}} as America's pastime, is well {{established}} in several other countries as well. The history of baseball in Canada has remained closely linked {{with that of the}} sport in the United States. As early as 1877, a professional league, the International Association, featured teams from both countries. While baseball is widely played in Canada and many minor league teams have been based in the country, the American major leagues did not include a Canadian club until 1969, when the Montreal Expos joined the National League as an expansion team. In 1977, the expansion Toronto Blue Jays joined the American League. The Blue Jays won the World Series in 1992 and 1993, the first <b>and</b> <b>still</b> <b>the</b> only club from outside the United States to do so. After the 2004 season, Major League Baseball relocated the Expos to Washington, D.C., where the team is now known as the Nationals.|$|E

25|$|In the Romanesque period {{free-standing}} statues, typically {{about half}} life-size, of the enthroned Madonna and Child were an original Western development, since monumental sculpture was forbidden by Orthodoxy.

25|$|While the Champenois {{and their}} French clients {{preferred}} their Champagne to be pale <b>and</b> <b>still,</b> <b>the</b> British were developing {{a taste for}} the unique bubbly wine. The sparkling version of Champagne continued to grow in popularity, especially among the wealthy and royal. Following the death of Louis XIV of France in 1715, the court of Philippe II, Duke of Orléans made the sparkling version of Champagne a favorite among the French nobility. More Champenois wine makers attempted to make their wines sparkle deliberately, but didn't know enough about how to control the process or how to make wine bottles strong enough to withstand the pressure.|$|E

25|$|Immediately {{after the}} {{surrender}} of Japan, 54 ships of the Third Fleet returned to the United States, with Halsey's four-star flag flying from the USS South Dakota, for the annual Navy Day Celebrations in San Francisco on October 27, 1945. He hauled down his flag in November of that year and was assigned special duty {{in the office of}} the Secretary of the Navy. On December 11, 1945, he took the oath as Fleet Admiral, becoming the fourth <b>and</b> <b>still</b> <b>the</b> most recent naval officer awarded that rank. Fleet Admiral Halsey made a goodwill flying trip, passing by Central and South America, covering nearly 28,000 miles and 11 nations. He retired from active service in March 1947 but, as a Fleet Admiral, he was not taken off active duty status.|$|E
25|$|He {{joined the}} groundstaff at Huddersfield Town after leaving school in 1950, and made 250 first-team {{appearances}} for them from 1953 to 1965, before playing for Bradford (Park Avenue) from 1965 to 1967, playing as a centre half. He also played for England under 23s. He {{played in the}} extraordinary match against Charlton Athletic on 21 December 1957. Charlton played most of the match with ten men after Derek Ufton was injured, and Huddersfield were leading 5–1 with just 27 minutes remaining. At that point, Johnny Summers began an extraordinary passage of play in which he scored five goals and assisted with two others to allow Charlton to win 7–6. Huddersfield become the first, <b>and</b> <b>still</b> <b>the</b> only, team to score six goals in an English Football League match – or indeed any other professional football match – and still be on the losing side.|$|E

25|$|Brabham was a Royal Australian Air Force flight {{mechanic}} {{and ran a}} small engineering workshop before he started racing midget cars in 1948. His successes with midgets in Australian and New Zealand road racing events led to his going to Britain to further his racing career. There he {{became part of the}} Cooper Car Company's racing team, building as well as racing cars. He contributed to the design of the mid-engined cars that Cooper introduced to Formula One and the Indianapolis 500, and won the Formula One world championship in 1959 and 1960. In 1962 he established his own Brabham marque with fellow Australian Ron Tauranac, which in the 1960s became the largest manufacturer of customer racing cars in the world. In the 1966 Formula One season Brabham became the first – <b>and</b> <b>still</b> <b>the</b> only – man to win the Formula One world championship driving one of his own cars. He was the last surviving World Champion of the 1950s.|$|E
25|$|Simpson's {{appearances}} {{during the}} 1965–66 Ashes series were intermittent. He missed the First Test {{due to a}} broken wrist, which ended in a draw {{under the leadership of}} Booth. He returned for the Second Test at Melbourne, scoring a half-century in both innings of a drawn match. Chickenpox forced him to miss the Third Test, which Australia lost by an innings. It {{was the first time that}} Australia had lost by an innings since 1956, and the selectors responded by dropping four players including Booth. On his return for the Fourth Test at Adelaide Simpson made 225, making 244 runs in 255 minutes with Lawry, the highest opening stand by Australia against England <b>and</b> <b>still</b> <b>the</b> highest against England in Australia. Australia claimed a decisive innings victory to level the series and a draw in the Fifth Test allowed Australia to retain the Ashes. Simpson topped the batting averages with 355 runs at 88.75 average.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} years of the Pan American (Pan Am) games, the players came from the AAU teams. The players for the 1955 team were drawn {{primarily}} from Hanes Hosiery Mills, Wayland College Flying Queens, the Dons, and Dowells Dolls. These four teams played each other in a tournament to help select the players for the Pan Am team. Hanes Hosiery came in first ahead of Wayland Baptist. This result would not be surprising, as these were the two dominant teams of the era. Hanes Hosiery won the AAU national championship in 1951, 1952, and 1953, beating Wayland two of those three years, and Wayland would go on to win the national championship the net four years 1954–1957. Not surprisingly, the twelve player Pan American team was dominated by these two teams, with six Wayland Baptist players and three from Hanes Hosiery. While Wayland provided the largest number of players, Hanes provided the captain, Lurlyne Greer Mealhouse, who would score over 18 points per game, more than twice the second highest scorer, <b>and</b> <b>still</b> <b>the</b> third highest scoring average in Pan American history. Greer was considered to be the best AAU player of her era.|$|E
