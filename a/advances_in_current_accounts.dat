40|$|Abstract We {{extend the}} {{literature}} on sharp reductions <b>in</b> <b>current</b> <b>account</b> deficits by taking into account not only short-term determinants, but also the deviation of net foreign assets from their long-run equilibrium level. First, we analyse the long-term relationship between net foreign assets {{and a set of}} explanatory variables and construct a measure of imbalances. Next, we model <b>current</b> <b>account</b> reversals by incorporating this new measure and compare the predictive power of this model with the baseline specification that does not account for long-term imbalances. Our new model has a superior performance in and out-of-sample, especially when we control for the sign of imbalances. We also find that low net foreign assets do not necessarily lead to sharp reductions <b>in</b> <b>current</b> <b>account</b> deficits; it is rather the situation when they are below their equilibrium level that triggers reversals. Finally, we document that our new measure of net foreign asset imbalances is important only for developing countries, whereas standard models perform well for industrial economies.

40|$|International {{adjustment}} and rebalancing of global demand: {{where do we}} stand? Despite {{the appearance of a}} moderate adjustment, the partial narrowing of global imbalances since the global financial crisis masks considerable changes {{in the way in which}} these imbalances are financed and in underlying imbalances in domestic demand. Capital flows from and to the private sector, which in large part financed <b>current</b> <b>account</b> imbalances before the crisis, have plummeted. This reversal is similar in scope to that experienced by emerging economies during the crises of the past decade. However, the collapse in private flows did not lead to a sharp adjustment <b>in</b> <b>current</b> <b>accounts,</b> as private flows were replaced by flows from and to the public sector. The partial decrease <b>in</b> <b>current</b> <b>account</b> imbalances was accompanied by a significant drop in the domestic demand of countries with a <b>current</b> <b>account</b> deficit. So far, the adjustment has been asymmetric, with a smaller increase in demand in surplus economies, which has contributed to subdued global growth. The increase in domestic demand in the surplus economies is itself mostly due to the growth differential between these economies (notably China) and deficit economies, and little to the internal rebalancing of their growth models...|$|R

40|$|Should {{monetary}} policy be preoccupied with large <b>current</b> <b>account</b> imbalances and extremely volatile exchange rates? Using a standard open economy model of pricing-to-market with incomplete asset markets and nominal rigidities, {{we show that}} the answer is yes. In our framework, supply shocks trigger important movements in demand via changes in wealth, which lead to large changes <b>in</b> <b>current</b> <b>accounts</b> and currency values, in line with the data. These substantial wealth effects also work to bring about significant departures from complete risk sharing and thus, combined with nominal rigidities, create a second distortion that pushes the economy away from the first-best allocation. We show that under cooperation, the optimal {{monetary policy}} largely corrects the distortions due to incomplete risk sharing, by reducing the shocks' wealth effects, and thus the movements <b>in</b> <b>current</b> <b>account</b> balances and exchange rates. In addition, we show that a simple Taylor rule that also responds to movements in the exchange rate comes close to replicating the optimal policy. Overall, our model suggests that a large <b>current</b> <b>account</b> deficit combined with an appreciating currency is a sign of excessive demand (relative to first best) and that monetary policy should be more restrictive as a result...|$|R
