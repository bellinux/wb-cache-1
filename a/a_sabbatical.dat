5|$|During <b>a</b> <b>sabbatical</b> year at Princeton University in 1960, Christy {{began an}} {{investigation}} of Cepheid variables and the smaller RR Lyrae variables, classes of luminous variable stars. At {{the time it was}} a mystery as to why they varied. He used the knowledge of the hydrodynamics of implosion gained at Los Alamos during the war to explain this phenomenon. This earned him the Royal Astronomical Society's Eddington Medal for contributions to theoretical astrophysics in 1967.|$|E
5|$|Thereafter, Reubens {{decided to}} take <b>a</b> <b>sabbatical</b> from Pee-wee. In July 1991, Reubens was arrested for indecent {{exposure}} in an adult theater in Sarasota, Florida. The arrest set off a chain reaction of national media attention that changed the general public's view of Reubens and Pee-wee. The arrest postponed Reubens' involvement in major projects until 1999 when he appeared in several big-budget projects including Mystery Men and Blow and started giving interviews as himself rather than as Pee-wee.|$|E

5|$|Pee-wee's Playhouse aired from September 13, 1986, until November 10, 1990. Reubens had {{originally}} {{agreed to do}} two more seasons after the third, and when CBS asked Reubens {{about the possibility of}} a sixth season he declined, wanting to take <b>a</b> <b>sabbatical.</b> Reubens had been suffering from burnout from playing Pee-wee full-time and had been warning that Pee-wee was temporary and that he had other ideas he would like to work on. The parties agreed to end the show after five seasons, which included 45 episodes and a Christmas Special. Playhouse garnered 15 Emmy Awards, all of them in the Creative Arts Emmy Award category.|$|E
5|$|Prost went on <b>a</b> <b>sabbatical</b> year in 1992, {{which was}} {{dominated}} by Nigel Mansell in a Williams-Renault. Prost performed pre-season testing for Ligier early in 1992 and later turned down an offer to drive for the team. After hearing that Prost would be his teammate again in 1993, Mansell left Williams to race in the CART series. The Frenchman had a clause in his contract which prevented rival Ayrton Senna from joining the team that year. Prost {{was part of a}} new-look driver line-up at Williams, with test driver Damon Hill coming in to replace Riccardo Patrese, who had left to join Benetton.|$|E

In his later years, Wright lived in Le Rouret, France, and spent time on a yacht he owned in the Virgin Islands. He found sailing therapeutic, relieving him from {{the pressures of the}} music business. He was also a keen collector of Persian rugs.|$|E
5|$|Arrington {{completed}} much of {{the research}} for Great Basin Kingdom in the LDS Church library archives. Aware of the LDS Church Archives's hostility to academic research at the time, Arrington took John A. Widtsoe's advice and started his research with published materials and theses, working up to unpublished materials. Arrington was able to circumvent A. William Lund's policy of personally approving all notes taken in the archives: Arrington took his notes on a typewriter using carbon copy paper, enabling him to leave a copy with Lund and take his own copy home. In order to rewrite his dissertation into Great Basin Kingdom, Arrington took <b>a</b> <b>sabbatical</b> 1956–1957 and was granted a fellowship at the Huntington Library in San Marino, California.|$|E

5|$|When he returned, The Rock won his then record-breaking seventh WWF/WWE Championship (which {{had been}} renamed the WWE Undisputed Championship after the WWF was renamed to WWE in May 2002) at Vengeance on July 21, {{defeating}} Kurt Angle and The Undertaker in a triple threat match. The Rock successfully defended the title at Global Warning in Australia against Triple H and Brock Lesnar by pinning Triple H, who saved The Rock when Lesnar attacked {{him after the}} match. At SummerSlam on August 25, after interference from Lesnar's manager Paul Heyman {{and the use of}} a steel chair, The Rock lost the WWE Championship to Lesnar along with the record for the youngest WWE Champion, which he had set in 1998. Following the loss against Lesnar, The Rock publicly declared that whether or not the crowd booed him he would always be the People's Champion, criticizing the fans in the arena and again taking <b>a</b> <b>sabbatical</b> from wrestling in order to focus on his film career.|$|E
5|$|Wright's {{position}} in the band was tenuous to begin with, as he did not choose a definitive instrument, playing piano if a pub had one, otherwise settling on the trombone or rhythm guitar. He moved in with Waters and Mason to a house in Stanhope Gardens, Highgate, and they began serious rehearsals to become a professional group. Although Mason and Waters were competent students, Wright found architecture of little interest and after only a year of study moved to the London College of Music. He took a break from studies and travelled to Greece for <b>a</b> <b>sabbatical.</b> Their landlord, Mike Leonard, purchased a Farfisa organ and briefly replaced Wright in the band. However, the organ ultimately became Wright's main instrument. Through a friend, he arranged the fledgling group's first recording session in a West Hampstead studio, just before Christmas 1964. Guitarists Bob Klose and Syd Barrett joined the band, which became Pink Floyd.|$|E
5|$|During the 1980s {{and early}} 1990s, Prost formed a fierce rivalry mainly with Ayrton Senna, but also Nelson Piquet and Nigel Mansell. In 1986, {{at the last}} race of the season, he beat Mansell and Piquet of Williams to the title after Mansell retired late on in the race, and Piquet was pulled in for a late precautionary pit stop. Senna joined Prost at McLaren in 1988 and the two {{had a series of}} {{controversial}} clashes, including a collision at the 1989 Japanese Grand Prix that gave Prost his third Drivers' Championship. A year later at the same venue they collided again, but this time Prost, driving for Ferrari, lost out. Before the end of a winless 1991 season Prost was fired by Ferrari for his public criticism of the team. After <b>a</b> <b>sabbatical</b> in 1992, Prost joined the Williams team, prompting reigning Drivers' Champion Mansell to leave for CART. With a competitive car, Prost won the 1993 championship and retired from Formula One driving {{at the end of the}} year.|$|E

5|$|Feynman {{spent several}} weeks in Rio de Janeiro in July 1949, {{and brought back}} a woman called Clotilde from Copacabana who lived with him in Ithaca for a time. As well as the cold weather, {{there was also the}} Cold War. The Soviet Union detonated its first atomic bomb in 1949, {{generating}} anti-communist hysteria. Fuchs was arrested as a Soviet spy in 1950, and the FBI questioned Bethe about Feynman's loyalty. Physicist David Bohm was arrested on December 4, 1950, and emigrated to Brazil in October 1951. A girlfriend told Feynman that he should consider moving to South America. He had <b>a</b> <b>sabbatical</b> coming for 1951–52, and elected to spend it in Brazil, where he gave courses at the Centro Brasileiro de Pesquisas Físicas. In Brazil, Feynman was particularly impressed with the Samba music, and learned to play a metal percussion instrument, the frigideira. He was an enthusiastic amateur player of bongo drums and often played them in the pit orchestra in musicals. He spent time in Rio with his good friend Bohm, but Bohm could not convince Feynman to take up investigating Bohm's ideas on physics.|$|E
5|$|One of SSI's first grants {{funded the}} {{development}} of the mass driver, a device first proposed by O'Neill in 1974. Mass drivers are based on the coilgun design, adapted to accelerate a non-magnetic object. One application O'Neill proposed for mass drivers was to throw baseball-sized chunks of ore mined {{from the surface of the}} Moon into space. Once in space, the ore could be used as raw material for building space colonies and solar power satellites. He took <b>a</b> <b>sabbatical</b> from Princeton to work on mass drivers at MIT. There he served as the Hunsaker Visiting Professor of Aerospace during the 1976–77 academic year. At MIT, he, Henry H. Kolm, and a group of student volunteers built their first mass driver prototype. The eight-foot (2.5m) long prototype could apply 33g (320m/s2) of acceleration to an object inserted into it. With financial assistance from SSI, later prototypes improved this to 1,800g (18,000m/s2), enough acceleration that a mass driver only 520 feet (160m) long could launch material off the surface of the Moon.|$|E

Also introduced in the pilot, is the legendary former surgeon, Dr. Ellis Grey (Kate Burton), Meredith's Alzheimer's-stricken mother, who appeared on the show until her death in season three. In the first season, Olivia Harper (Sarah Utterback), a nurse who appeared on the show occasionally until getting laid off in the merger with Mercy West, engages in sexual activity with O'Malley, giving him syphilis. Serving as an assistant and secretary to the Chief of Surgery, former nurse Patricia (Robin Pearson Rose), has appeared on the show since its debut. Tyler Christian (Moe Irvin), a hospital nurse, makes occasional appearances throughout the series. Within the second season, Bailey becomes pregnant by her husband, Tucker Jones (Cress Williams), who makes frequent appearances on Grey's Anatomy, until their divorce in season five.
