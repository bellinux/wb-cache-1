25|$|Another {{friend of}} Ives was the English socialist poet Edward Carpenter. Carpenter thought that {{homosexuality}} was an innate and natural human characteristic {{and that it}} should not be regarded as a sin or a criminal offence. In the 1890s, Carpenter began a concerted effort to campaign against discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation, possibly in response to the recent death of Symonds, whom he viewed as his campaigning inspiration. His 1908 book on the subject, The Intermediate Sex, would become a foundational text of the LGBT movements of the 20th century. Scottish anarchist John Henry Mackay also wrote in defense of same-sex love and <b>androgyny.</b>|$|E
25|$|Given the definition, {{once the}} child is aware of their gender they will start to behave in gender roles that their {{same-sex}} models would normally adopt. Therefore, these individual responses become internalized and function according to the appropriate gender-role standards. The responses that individuals receive from their social group will mold their identity – becoming more feminine or masculine – and thus affect the way they view the world. Other facets of the process can also result in atypical development. Albeit, whether a child develops shared traits, cross-gender identities, or <b>androgyny,</b> their decision begins with the identification of a gender and the models he or she chooses to emulate. The behaviors they adopt will ultimately shape their knowledge and identity for {{who they are and}} how they should behave.|$|E
25|$|The Castro's age {{as a gay}} mecca began {{during the}} late 1960s with the Summer of Love in the {{neighboring}} Haight-Ashbury district in 1967. The two neighborhoods are separated by a large mountain, topped by Buena Vista Park. The hippie and free love movements had fostered communal living and free society ideas including housing of large groups of people in hippie communes. <b>Androgyny</b> became popular with men even in full beards as gay hippie men began {{to move into the}} area. The 1967 gathering brought tens of thousands of middle-class youth from all over the United States to the Haight which saw its own exodus when well-organized individuals and collectives started to see the Castro as an oasis from the massive influx. Many of the hippies had no way to support themselves or places to shelter. The Haight became drug ridden and violent, chasing off the gay population, who looked for a more stable area to live.|$|E

500|$|Tron: Legacy is {{imbued with}} several {{references}} to religious themes, particularly those relating to Christianity and Buddhism. Olivia Wilde's character, Quorra, was {{informed by the}} historical Catholic figure Joan of Arc. Wilde sought inspiration from her six months before production of the film commenced. She, alongside Kosinski, collaborated with the writers on editing the characters so she would contain the characteristics of Joan of Arc. Wilde assessed {{the characteristics of the}} figure: [...] "She's this unlikely warrior, very strong but compassionate, and completely led by selflessness. Also, she thinks she's in touch with some higher power and has one foot in another world. All of these were elements of Quorra." [...] Since she epitomizes the concept of <b>androgyny,</b> producers conceived Quorra from an androgynous perspective, notably giving her a short haircut.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{have also}} {{commented on the}} broad {{influence}} of the book, with writers such as Budrys citing it as an influence upon their own writing. More generally it has been asserted that the work has been widely influential in the science fiction field, with The Paris Review claiming that [...] "No single work did more to upend the genre's conventions than The Left Hand of Darkness". Donna White, in her study of the critical literature on Le Guin, argued that Left Hand {{was one of the}} seminal works of science fiction, as important as Frankenstein, by Mary Shelley, which is often described as the very first science fiction novel. Suzanne Reid wrote that at the time the novel was written, Le Guin's ideas of <b>androgyny</b> were unique not only to science fiction, but to literature in general.|$|E
500|$|The basic {{anthropomorphic}} form varies. Child gods {{are depicted}} nude, as are some adult gods when their procreative powers are emphasized. Certain male deities are given heavy bellies and breasts, signifying either <b>androgyny</b> or prosperity and abundance. Whereas most male gods have red skin and most goddesses are yellow—the same colors used to depict Egyptian men and women—some are given unusual, symbolic skin colors. Thus the blue skin and paunchy {{figure of the}} god Hapi alludes to the Nile flood he represents and the nourishing fertility it brought. A few deities, such as Osiris, Ptah, and Min, have a [...] "mummiform" [...] appearance, with their limbs tightly swathed in cloth. Although these gods resemble mummies, the earliest examples predate the cloth-wrapped style of mummification, and this form may instead hark back to the earliest, limbless depictions of deities.|$|E
500|$|Beyond friendship, Leonardo {{kept his}} private life secret. His {{sexuality}} {{has been the subject}} of satire, analysis, and speculation. This trend began in the mid-16th century and was revived in the 19th and 20th centuries, most notably by Sigmund Freud. Leonardo's most intimate relationships were perhaps with his pupils Salai and Melzi. Melzi, writing to inform Leonardo's brothers of his death, described Leonardo's feelings for his pupils as both loving and passionate. It has been claimed since the 16th century that these relationships were of a sexual or erotic nature. Court records of 1476, when he was aged twenty-four, show that Leonardo and three other young men were charged with sodomy in an incident involving a well-known male prostitute. The charges were dismissed for lack of evidence, and there is speculation that since one of the accused, Lionardo de Tornabuoni, was related to Lorenzo de' Medici, the family exerted its influence to secure the dismissal. Since that date much has been written about his presumed homosexuality and its role in his art, particularly in the <b>androgyny</b> and eroticism manifested in John the Baptist and Bacchus and more explicitly in a number of erotic drawings.|$|E
500|$|Olek {{first used}} {{crocheting}} {{as part of}} her art in 2003 after moving to the United States. She [...] "wowed critics" [...] at the Williamsburg Arts and Historical Society Surrealist Fashion Show that year. In 2004, Olek created [...] "a large tentlike piece made of crocheted strips of cloth, hair, cassette tape and stuffed animals" [...] work for a four-person show. The New York Times said this work gave the show at 5BE Gallery in Chelsea, Manhattan, [...] "a tour-de-force center to work around." [...] Her crocheted sculpture [...] "Spill" [...] (2005), featured in the Washington Post, included 1,300 skinny white balloons cascading in an [...] "intestinal shape".

In September and October of that year, Olek crocheted the windows of a burned-out, abandoned building near her artist residency in Utica, New York. During this period, her costumes for theatre and dance performances drew critical praise, although a dance performance relating to one of her sculptures was criticized.|$|E
500|$|Public {{reception}} of Gaga's music, fashion sense, and persona is polarized.

When Gaga met briefly with politician Barack Obama at a Human Rights Campaign fundraiser, he found the interaction [...] "intimidating" [...] as she was dressed in 16-inch heels, making her the tallest woman in the room. When interviewed by Barbara Walters for her annual ABC News special 10 Most Fascinating People in 2009, Gaga dismissed the claim that she is intersex as an urban legend. Responding to a question on this issue, she expressed her fondness for <b>androgyny.</b> In a 2010 Sunday Times article, Camille Paglia criticized Gaga as [...] "more an identity thief than an erotic taboo breaker, a mainstream manufactured product who claims to be singing for the freaks, the rebellious and the dispossessed when she is none of those".|$|E
500|$|Returning to San Francisco, Sylvester {{was offered}} the {{opportunity}} to record a demo album by Rolling Stone editor Jann Wenner. Financed by A Records, the album featured a cover of Bonnie Bramlett and Leon Russell's song [...] "Superstar," [...] which had been a recent hit single for The Carpenters; nevertheless, A felt that the work was not commercially viable and declined to release the album. For the album, Sylvester and his manager Dennis Lopez had assembled a group of heterosexual white males—Bobby Blood on trumpet, Chris Mostert on saxophone, James Q. Smith on guitar, Travis Fullerton on drums, and Kerry Hatch on bass—whom he named The Hot Band. After A's initial rejection, the band provided two songs for Lights Out San Francisco, an album compiled by San Francisco's KSAN radio and released on the Blue Thumb label. Gaining a number of local gigs, they were eventually asked to open for English glam rock star David Bowie at the Winterland Ballroom; the gig did not sell particularly well, and Bowie later commented that San Francisco did not need him, because [...] "They've got Sylvester," [...] referring to their shared preference for <b>androgyny.</b>|$|E
500|$|The novel {{follows the}} story of Genly Ai, a native of Terra, who {{is sent to the}} planet of Gethen as an envoy of the Ekumen, a loose {{confederation}} of planets. Ai's mission is to persuade the nations of Gethen to join the Ekumen, but he is stymied by his lack of understanding of Gethenian culture. Individuals on Gethen are [...] "ambisexual", with no fixed sex. This fact has a strong influence on the culture of the planet, and creates a barrier of understanding for Ai. Left Hand was among the first books published in the feminist science fiction genre and is the most famous examination of <b>androgyny</b> in science fiction. A major theme of the novel is the effect of sex and gender on culture and society, explored in particular through the relationship between Ai and Estraven, a Gethenian politician who trusts and helps him. [...] Within that context the novel also explores the interaction between the unfolding loyalties of its main characters, the loneliness and rootlessness of Ai, and the contrast between the religions of Gethen's two major nations. The theme of gender also touched off a feminist debate when it was first published, over depictions of the ambisexual Gethenians.|$|E
500|$|A {{writer of}} Rolling Stone {{compared}} the black-and-white {{look of the}} video with Madonna's [...] "Vogue", 1920s German Expressionist cinema and Ingmar Bergman's The Seventh Seal. He further noted influences from Liza Minnelli, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers' [...] "Don't Come Around Here No More", and Sandro Botticelli's The Birth of Venus. A writer of The Independent wrote, [...] "Showing Gaga {{in a number of}} guises (as a Beatnik performance artist, her face smeared with clown make-up, sporting David Bowie-esque <b>androgyny</b> while wearing a bra made of black, leather gloves and as various winged creatures), the high energy accompaniment to her new track is a hotch-potch of imagery that seems to highlight the pop princess' ever changing appearance." [...] Chris Rovzar of Vanity Fair described the video as a moving photo shoot for Interview magazine [...] "except with more sanity". Rovzar concluded that it also featured [...] "the standard Gaga nonsense" [...] and praised Gaga's smile during several scenes of the video as a highlight. James Montgomery of MTV News saw the video as Gaga [...] "pulling the curtain back on her creative process, showing the viewer how she's willing to do anything to please the public." [...] Melinda Newman of Hitfix felt Gaga [...] "continues her one-woman performance art with the very theatrical video" [...] and interpreted it as showing that [...] "there is nothing Lady Gaga won’t do to get your attention".|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Bedtime Story" [...] has {{received}} generally positive reviews from critics ever since its release. It was exhibited and permanently kept in different art galleries and museums, including the Museum of Modern Art {{as well the}} School of Visual Arts in New York City. O'Brien praised the video, calling it [...] "one of 's most experimental" [...] music videos and a [...] "Dali-esque epic", causing it to enter [...] "the portals of high art". MTV News' James Montgomery, while writing {{an article on the}} pop culture references of Britney Spears' [...] "Hold It Against Me" [...] music video (2011), claimed that [...] "Bedtime Story" [...] was an ultra artistic video, influencing Spears' one. Corinna Herr wrote in the book Madonna's Drowned Worlds that [...] "Visual references to surreal paintings seem to be a key to Madonna's world of images" [...] and listed [...] "Bedtime Story" [...] as one of these videos. In the same book, author Santiago Fouz-Hernández added that videos like Bedtime Story" [...] included alchemical and hermeticist traditions, in particular the concepts of <b>androgyny</b> and masquerade. Herr also wrote regarding the video's new age influences and concept of an idealised world, one [...] "which she is not necessarily a part, but to which she nevertheless seems to be attracted". Rettenmund commented that the video was rife with mystical and Sufi traditions, and described it as a [...] "singular creation in Madonna's oeuvre".|$|E
500|$|Feminist writer Susan Bordo gave a {{negative}} {{review of the}} video, saying that the leering and pathetic men in the cubicles and Madonna's escape with the boy is [...] "cynically and mechanically tacked on [...] a way of claiming trendy status for what is just cheesecake– or, perhaps, pornography". MTV also had some reservations initially before airing the video, which was later resolved after a meeting with Warner Officials. However socio-critic Mary Harron in her book McRock: Pop as Commodity said that the underlying message in the video is that though Madonna sells sexuality, she is free. There is no overt representation of anything besides friendship with the boy. Their escape together avoids Madonna the sexual overtones {{that would have been}} stronger if she would have escaped with an adult male. This, according to author Richard Dienst, seems to suggest a repudiation of the adult labor of the stage in favor of childhood, <b>androgyny,</b> authenticity and nomadic play. The video is also acclaimed for reviving and re-creating the hard glamor of the studio-era of Hollywood stars and also for representing women as the dominant sex. Author Donn Welton pointed out that the usual power relationship between the [...] "voyeuristic male gaze and object" [...] is destabilized by the portrayal of the male patrons of the peep show as leering and pathetic. At the same time, the portrayal of Madonna as [...] "porno queen object" [...] is deconstructed by the escape {{at the end of the}} video. Maura Johnston from Rolling Stone found influences of the work of Italian film director Federico Fellini and American musical theater chroeographer Bob Fosse. Johnston added, [...] "'Open Your Heart' was gorgeous, from the paintings of art deco artist Tamara de Lempicka on the club exterior, to the colorfully cold cast of characters." [...] She noticed that at one point in the video, Madonna titled her head to re-create the Herb Ritts shot album cover for True Blue.|$|E
500|$|The {{central theme}} of the show was unity versus violence. It was divided into five acts with {{different}} themes: French Baroque–Marie Antoinette Revival, Military–Army, Circus–Cabaret, Acoustic and Scottish-Tribal segments. It began with [...] "The Beast Within", an ominous recitation from the Book of Revelation by Madonna and the screens displaying Madonna's X-STaTIC PRo=CeSS installations. Once the introduction had finished, Madonna appeared onstage on a rising platform in a golden corset (for some European shows she wore a lilac one), striking yoga poses to perform [...] "Vogue". It {{was followed by the}} energetically performed [...] "Nobody Knows Me" [...] on a conveyor belt with some of the words to the song appearing on the screens, then [...] "Frozen", during which a video of a naked male and a naked female wrestling, caressing and intertwining in water, their faces and genitals darkened by shadows so as to preserve their <b>androgyny,</b> were displayed on the backdrops. This video was directed by Chris Cunningham, who directed Madonna's original music video to the song. The military segment started with the sound of a helicopter in the background as Madonna's backup dancers, dressed as soldiers, crawled on their bellies as though in the middle of battle, then hugged each other as if saying goodbye. Madonna appeared onstage, on top of a structure made up of TV sets, wearing camouflage pants, an olive army jacket and black beret. She started performing [...] "American Life" [...] as war footage of death and destruction flashed on screens behind her (at the end of the song, it showed a George W. Bush look-alike lovingly resting his head on the shoulder of a Saddam Hussein look-alike, as though the pair were waiting for a marriage license [...] ). During the performance Madonna ran down a lengthy V-shaped catwalk that descended from the ceiling and allowed her to reach the middle of the stadium. She also twirled army rifles during a march-like [...] "Express Yourself" [...] before strapping on a guitar for rock versions of [...] "Burning Up" [...] and [...] "Material Girl". During the latter's performances, the backdrops displayed mathematical equations along with DNA helixes rushing through the screens. A remix interlude of [...] "Hollywood" [...] featured a breakdancer, a firedancer, a bellydancer, a tapdancer and a skateboarder. The screens displayed animations of tarot cards.|$|E
