They issued a live EP, Scatter's Liver: Pub Dogs Live on the Wireless {{in the next}} year on Shock Records, which had been recorded at radio station Triple J's studios in Melbourne on 22 October 1990. In August 1991 Wilson provided lead vocals for Robin Casinader's (ex-the Wreckery) debut solo album, <b>All</b> <b>This</b> <b>Will</b> Be Yours.|$|E
25|$|A {{whiteboard}} grid {{is used to}} plan episodes a {{few weeks}} in advance, based on release schedules, events like E3, interviews, and other segments. They try to time reviews so they occur before or in the week the game is released, however, being a television show with a longer production period than most online content, {{this is not always}} possible. One challenge is having publishers provide games early enough to be reviewed and filmed in time. Often they receive debug code which can only be played on debug consoles, and developers are usually still working out kinks, so will provide a list of bugs for the team to take into account. Good Game also have to be wary of embargo dates as reviews can't be broadcast before then. Even if the embargo ends a few hours after a Good game episode, the review must be held back for a week. Sometimes, Good Game can only get a copy of the game after it is released, and Bajo points out that while this is sometimes due to random factors it can also be a sign that the game is bad. They try to avoid having too many of the same type of game in each week, and try to include games on all consoles. They hope that <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>will</b> ensure there is something for everyone.|$|E
500|$|Scientology spokeswoman, Karin Pouw, stated of the Wikipedia Arbitration decision, [...] "Do Scientologists {{care what}} has been posted on Wikipedia? Of course. Some {{of it has been}} very hateful and erroneous." [...] Pouw commented, [...] "We hope <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>will</b> result in more {{accurate}} and useful articles on Wikipedia." [...] She characterized the Arbitration Committee decision as [...] "a routine internal action by Wikipedia to clean up its editing process". Pouw emphasized, [...] "More importantly is the fact that Wikipedia finally banned those who were engaged in unobjective and biased editing for the purposes of antagonism as opposed to providing accurate information." [...] Pouw commented to ABC News, [...] "People have conflicts on Wikipedia all the time, and it's obvious why [...] anybody can post." [...] Bloomberg Businessweek reported on Pouw's statements, [...] " [...] says her organization regularly monitors the Internet for wrong information about its belief system and members. After this ruling, Pouw says there remain 'gross inaccuracies' on the Scientology article on Wikipedia that she hopes will eventually be corrected. But for the time being, her group's ability to do that have been weakened." [...] In a statement to CNN, Pouw asserted [...] "she is unaware of any coordinated effort to alter Wikipedia".|$|E
