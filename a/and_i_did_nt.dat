40|$|Two {{distinct}} {{types of}} colony-stimulating factor (CSF) {{have recently been}} described in human tissues and cultured cell lines. Antisera to purified type <b>I</b> <b>and</b> II CSF were prepared in rabbits. Anti-CSF I antibody inhibits CSF I, but {{has no effect on}} CSF II. It cross-inhibits CSF I from several other human sources, but does not inhibit CSF from mouse lung or mouse L cells. Anti-CSF II antibody inhibits the activity of CSF II, but has no effect on CSF I. A radioimmunoassay for CSF I has been established. Competitive binding assay further demonstrated the immunological differences between CSF <b>I</b> <b>and</b> II. When CSF II is used to stimulate human marrow cells fractionated by sedimentation velocity, two populations of CFU-C are separated, one sedimenting at 8 mm/h and forming colonies by day 7, and a second sedimenting at 6. 8 mm/h and forming colonies by day 13. In contrast, CSF <b>I</b> <b>does</b> <b>nt</b> stimulate colony growth by day 7 but does do so by day 13 in cells sedimenting between 7. 2 - 8. 5 mm/h. These results indicate that CSF <b>I</b> <b>and</b> II are distinct in their biochemical, immunological, and functional properties...|$|R
