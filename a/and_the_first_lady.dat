5|$|The White House Chief of Staff, Donald Regan, grew {{frustrated}} with this regimen, which created friction between him <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>Lady.</b> This escalated with {{the revelation of}} the Iran–Contra affair, an administration scandal, in which the First Lady felt Regan was damaging the president. She thought he should resign, and expressed this to her husband, {{although he did not}} share her view. Regan wanted President Reagan to address the Iran-Contra matter in early 1987 by means of a press conference, though Reagan refused to allow her husband to overexert himself due to a recent prostate surgery and astrological warnings. Regan became so angry with Reagan that he hung up on her during a 1987 telephone conversation. According to the recollections of ABC News correspondent Sam Donaldson, when the President heard of this treatment, he demanded—and eventually received—Regan's resignation. Vice President George H. W. Bush is also reported to have suggested to Reagan to have Regan fired.|$|E

Luggage piled on the girl and her mother as the crash occurred; Rika Matsuda said her mother, unable to free herself, asked her to leave. Cho died in the fire. After escaping from the aircraft, Rika discovered a surviving flight attendant, Lee Yong Ho (이용호). They stayed together until Gutierrez discovered them. Rika Matsuda, treated at Guam Memorial Hospital in Tamuning, was released on August 7, 1997.

500|$|On November 19, 1998, Independent Counsel Starr {{testified before}} the House Judiciary Committee in {{connection}} with the Impeachment of Bill Clinton over charges related to the Lewinsky scandal.

Second, we have found no evidence that information contained in the files of former officials was used for an improper purpose." [...] (Starr also chose this occasion to clear President Clinton in the Travelgate matter, and to say that he had not committed impeachable wrongdoing in the Whitewater matter; Democrats on the committee immediately criticized Starr for withholding all these findings until after the 1998 Congressional elections.) ...|$|E

500|$|In 1983 Reagan's Secretary of the Interior James G. Watt {{cancelled}} The Beach Boys annual Independence Day {{performance in}} Washington, D.C, opting instead for crooner Wayne Newton and a U.S. Army band. The Beach Boys {{had played a}} free concert on the National Mall every July 4 since 1980 until Watt declared that rock music attracted [...] "the wrong element" [...] and that the administration was [...] "not going to encourage drug abuse and alcoholism as was done in past years." [...] Watt's social conservativism made him the target of public outcry and denouncements from both the President <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>Lady</b> who declared themselves Beach Boys fans. Days after Watt's announcement, Reagan presented the Secretary with a plaster boot {{with a hole in}} it to indicate that Watt had [...] "shot himself in the foot." [...] Watt soon reversed his order and invited the Beach Boys back, but the band had quickly booked another 4 July concert in Atlantic City. The Beach Boys returned to a crowd of 750,000 on the National Mall in 1984 and performed at Reagan's second inaugural ball the following year.|$|E
500|$|President Wilson {{experienced}} a mild stroke in September 1919. On October 2, {{he was struck}} by a much more severe stroke that left him partially paralyzed and almost certainly incapacitated. Wilson's closest adviser, Joseph Tumulty, did not believe Marshall would be a suitable acting president and took precautions to prevent him from assuming presidential powers and duties. Wilson's wife Edith strongly disliked Marshall because of what she called his [...] "uncouthed" [...] disposition, and also opposed his assumption of presidential powers and duties. [...] Tumulty <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>Lady</b> believed that an official communication from Wilson's staff on his condition would allow Marshall to trigger the constitutional mechanism allowing him to become acting president, and made sure no such communication occurred. After Marshall demanded to know Wilson's status so that he could prepare for the possibility of becoming president, they had a reporter from the Baltimore Sun brief Marshall and inform him that Wilson was near death. Marshall later said that [...] "it was the first great shock of my life", but without an official communication on Wilson's condition, he didn't believe he could constitutionally assume presidential powers and duties.|$|E
500|$|McKinley {{had been}} given nutritive enemas; on September 11, he took some broth by mouth. [...] When it seemed to do him good, the {{following}} morning they allowed him toast, coffee, and chicken broth. [...] His subsequent pain was diagnosed as indigestion; he was given purgatives and most doctors left after their evening consultation. [...] In the early morning of September 13, McKinley suffered a collapse. [...] Urgent word to return to Buffalo was sent to Vice President Roosevelt, [...] from the nearest telegraph or telephone in the Adirondack wilderness; a park ranger was sent to find him. [...] Specialists were summoned; although at first some doctors hoped that McKinley might survive with a weakened heart, by afternoon they knew the case was hopeless. As yet unknown to the doctors, gangrene was growing {{on the walls of}} his stomach and toxins were passing into his blood. [...] McKinley drifted {{in and out of consciousness}} all day; when awake he was the model patient. [...] By evening, McKinley too knew he was dying, [...] "It is useless, gentlemen. I think we ought to have prayer." [...] His friends and family were admitted, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>Lady</b> sobbed over him, [...] "I want to go, too. [...] I want to go, too." [...] Her husband replied, [...] "We are all going, we are all going. [...] God's will be done, not ours" [...] and with final strength put an arm around her. [...] He may also have sung part of his favorite hymn, [...] "Nearer, My God, to Thee", although other accounts have her singing it softly to him. [...] Ida McKinley was led away, her place briefly taken by Senator Hanna. [...] Morgan recounts their final encounter, [...] "Sometime that terrible evening, Mark Hanna had approached the bedside, tears standing in his eyes, his hands and head shaking in disbelief that thirty years of friendship could end thus." [...] When a tentative, formal greeting gained no coherent response, Hanna [...] "cried out over the years of friendship, 'William, William, don't you know me?'" ...|$|E
