5|$|In {{the case}} of '4 Minutes', Tim had a vision from the {{beginning}} of how things should go, especially sonically... When I opened up the session of '4 Minutes', there was so much going on that I knew right away that the hard part would be {{to make sure that the}} vocals would cut through and were right in the pocket. Beginning with working on the vocals was the only way to achieve this. <b>After</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> formed all the other parts around the vocals. The other challenge was to make sure that everything in the track sounded clear and that you could hear every instrument, every syllable, every breath. Also, I do almost always work linear in time on a track. It's easier, because when you're done, you're done. So I keep working on section after section, until I get to the end of the track and then I know the whole mix is pretty close.|$|E
5|$|Israel entered one artistic gymnast {{into the}} Olympic competition. Two-time Olympian Alexander Shatilov {{qualified}} and claimed his Olympic {{spot in the}} men's apparatus and all-around events via the Olympic Test Event in Rio de Janeiro by participation. Shatilov participated in both the London and Beijing Olympics. He did not advance following the qualification round in the floor and horizontal bar events due to not achieving eighth place or higher in either. Shatilov's loss in the qualification rounds makes Rio his worst Olympic finish ever. In regards to the loss, he said “things didn’t go as I planned, but that happens in sport and there’s nothing I can do about it. You {{need to know how}} to cope with disappointments and life continues. I trained hard and wanted to have a good competition, but you can’t turn the clock back. I started my floor drill well, but a small mistake cost me and I knew I had no chance <b>after</b> <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> never imagined a scenario like this.” He performed poorly in both the floor and bar routines, scoring 13.5 points in the floor routine, and 14.066 points in the bar routine. The floor exercise was riddled with errors and ended with a landing where it appeared as if he was trying to break a fall.|$|E
25|$|Our plan {{this morning}} was for O'Neill and I to go for runs, and had we been {{successful}} I would have closed. But O'Neill got out. <b>After</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{toyed with the idea}} of closing and giving England five minutes batting before lunch, but decided against it. If we had had Davidson to bowl today it would have made a big difference to the whole outlook.|$|E

25|$|The {{one that}} {{finished}} my career was when I got hit in my eye by John Maguire from Queensland...He got one to really rear up, and I {{got back to}} hook and it went between the visor and the top part of the helmet and smashed in my eye. That finished me. <b>After</b> <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> didn't want to be there. I thought of other things I wanted to do in life. Even though I continued playing on in Shield {{for two or three}} years, I just didn't want to be there.|$|E
25|$|In 1963, I {{worked in}} a Jewish school in Dublin, {{teaching}} French with an Irish accent to kids, primarily Lithuanians. The parents there gave me a trip to Israel as a present. I had no money, so I went and {{worked in a}} kibbutz – plucking chickens, picking oranges. My parents were very nervous; here I was {{going out to the}} Middle East by myself. I wrote to them regularly, telling them about the kibbutz. My father and mother sent my letters to a newspaper, which published them. So I thought, It's not so hard to be a writer. Just write a letter home. <b>After</b> <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> started writing other travel articles.|$|E
500|$|For his part, Rodgers {{recalled}} {{that he had}} first seen Madonna perform at a small club in New York in 1983. In an interview with Time magazine, Rodgers explained: [...] "I went to the club to see another woman sing, but when I got there Madonna was onstage. I loved her stage presence and then we met right <b>after</b> <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> kept thinking to myself, 'Damn, is she a star', but she wasn't at that time. I always {{wanted to work with}} her and Like a Virgin seemed like a perfect opportunity." ...|$|E
5000|$|Corman {{says that}} Ireland only {{appeared}} in the film on the condition he could direct it. [...] "Personally, I'm not very pleased with his work," [...] said Corman later. [...] "It was <b>after</b> <b>that</b> film <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{decided to become a}} director." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was shortly <b>after</b> <b>that,</b> when <b>I</b> went to Boston, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{wrote the}} 'Hymn to Coniston.' I suppose {{we must all}} be fools once or twice, or {{we should not be}} human." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No good. I don't {{want any}} of your off-colour stuff from the Drones' smoking-room. I need {{something}} clean. Something {{that will be a}} help to them in their <b>after</b> lives. Not <b>that</b> <b>I</b> care a damn about their <b>after</b> lives, except <b>that</b> <b>I</b> hope they'll all choke." ...|$|R
500|$|One {{month later}} he {{enrolled}} in a differential equations course ("mostly full of seniors") as well. When Einar Hille temporarily replaced the regular instructor, Gleason found Hille's style [...] "unbelievably different... He had a view of mathematics that was just vastly different... That {{was a very important}} experience for me. So <b>after</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> took a lot of courses from Hille" [...] including, in his sophomore year, graduate-level real analysis. [...] "Starting with that course with Hille, I began to have some sense of what mathematics is about." ...|$|E
500|$|Sigurður was {{assisted}} by his family, though {{not without some}} occasional embarrassment. His daughter Þorgerður recalls that she was once sent to a slaughterhouse to collect a specimen but arrived just as the workers were taking a lunch break: [...] "Someone asked, 'What's in the basket?' I had to say, 'I'm collecting a frozen goat penis.' <b>After</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> said, 'I will never collect for you again.'" [...] According to Sigurður, [...] "Collecting penises is like collecting anything. You can never stop, you can never catch up, you can always get a new one, a better one." ...|$|E
500|$|... "We were noodling {{around and}} 'Crazy for You' was {{something}} that Jon was singing over that section of the song. It was really descriptive of {{the scene in the}} film. [...] <b>After</b> <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> was out on vacation out in the desert and [...] called and said Phil Ramone was in love with the song and wanted to cut it on Madonna. [...] 'Borderline' was out at that time and I said, 'Excuse me? This is for Madonna? Really? Can she sing a song like this?' Jon and I were surprised at the choice of artist at the time, {{if you want to know}} the truth." ...|$|E

60|$|TARLETON. I {{never get}} tired. I never go on {{long enough for}} that. But when it becomes so grand, so inspiring <b>that</b> <b>I</b> feel <b>that</b> {{everything}} must be an anti-climax <b>after</b> <b>that,</b> then <b>I</b> run away.|$|R
500|$|... "Warner Bros. Records is a {{hierarchy}} of old men and it's a chauvinist environment {{to be working in}} because I'm treated like this sexy little girl. I had to prove them wrong, which meant not only proving myself to my fans but to my record company as well. That is something that happens when you're a girl. It wouldn't happen to Prince or Michael Jackson. I had to do everything on my own and it was hard trying to convince people that I was worth a record deal. <b>After</b> <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> had the same problem trying to convince the record company that I had more to offer than a one-shot singer. I had to win this fight." ...|$|E
500|$|Lochte {{was taught}} to swim {{at the age of}} five by both of his parents. He was often kicked out of his father's {{swimming}} classes for misbehaving, which often included pulling other children's legs, blowing bubbles, and hiding {{at the other end of}} the pool. Lochte only began taking swimming seriously when he was in junior high school. His father said, [...] "I would send him to go shower when he was messing around. He spent more time in the showers than he did in the pool." [...] At 14 years old, his loss at the Junior Olympics changed his attitude. He later commented: [...] "I suddenly said, 'I'm sick of losing'. <b>After</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> trained hard and I never lost there again." ...|$|E
500|$|Feng {{also participated}} in the women's team {{competition}} with Li Jiawei and Wang Yuegu. They were beaten 0–3 by Japan in the semifinals, but took the bronze medal by edging out South Korea 3–0. Feng defeated Kim Kyung Ah 11–9, 11–8, 4–11, 13–11, Li also successfully fended off Seok Ha Jung 11–5, 11–8, 6–11, 11–8. Li and Wang then succeeded in the doubles game against Seok and Dang Ye Seo 11–9, 11–6, 6–11, 11–5. This {{marked the first time}} Singapore had won more than one medal at an Olympic Games. Feng commented: [...] "Against Japan, we gave ourselves too much pressure and lost the psychological battle. <b>After</b> <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> told myself that I must prepare myself well mentally and it's only when I do what I'm capable of that I can win." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, both of {{them came}} once, and Flockley came <b>after</b> <b>that,</b> but <b>I</b> refused to see them. Mr. Flockley wished to bring me to see this game, but <b>I</b> sent word <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was going with papa." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, <b>I</b> found <b>after</b> all <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{could get}} across the rocks quite easily, so it seemed a pity not to keep my bag,' {{answered}} Gudu.|$|R
6000|$|... "You need {{hardly be}} told <b>after</b> this <b>that</b> <b>I</b> leave here in another week. I cannot {{fabricate}} a decent excuse to go sooner, or I would." ...|$|R
500|$|Henson {{received}} help editing {{the film}} from executive producer George Lucas. According to Henson, [...] "When {{we hit the}} editing, I did the first cut, and then George was heavily involved on bringing it to the final cut. <b>After</b> <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> took it over again and did {{the next few months}} of post-production and audio." [...] Henson went on to explain, [...] "When you edit a film with somebody else you have to compromise. I always want to go one way, and George goes another way, but we each took turns trading off, giving and taking. George tends to be very action-oriented and he cuts dialogue quite tight; I tend to cut looser, and go for more lyrical pauses, which can slow the story. So, I loosen up his tightness, and he tightens my looseness." ...|$|E
500|$|After Orr {{signed with}} Chicago, the Black Hawks gave him {{permission}} {{to play for}} Team Canada in the 1976 Canada Cup tournament. Orr did not play in the 1972 Summit Series against the Soviet Union, and he wanted badly to play for Canada. Orr {{had been unable to}} play in the Summit Series due to knee surgery, although he did participate as a non-player. Orr's participation in the Canada Cup was considered ill-conceived and Eagleson later thought {{it may have been the}} 'last straw' that killed his career. Orr himself said that he knew before the tournament that [...] "I knew I didn't have much longer. That series didn't do it. I thought I could get the next season in, but not much <b>after</b> <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> knew, looking at that team, I wouldn't have to do as much. I wouldn't have traded it for anything." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Man, {{there will}} be a time for Down. Matter of fact we had a meeting this past week, and I know Jimmy's gotta go do an Eyehategod tour in February. But <b>after</b> <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> think we're looking to do some shows {{starting}} in March. Maybe local around here, maybe even some Mardi Gras gigs. But yeah, last week we sat around and they played me some new stuff they're working on, and it sounds good. Sounds like it's got a lot of promise, and really they just need me in the fuckin' practice room. So all {{this is going to happen}} this year. It has to happen. I know there's a responsibility here. Down has a fanbase and they are very very very loyal. So I don't want to let those people down. They deserve some new music, we have it. We've demoed other songs, there's songs that haven't even been released that people have never heard, so there's always Down there. For all you people out there, don't you stress. We got the Down coming." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes; <b>I</b> {{quite believe}} <b>that.</b> We must each {{think of the}} other's comfort. <b>After</b> all, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> take it is the great thing in married life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{are plenty}} of wild {{enterprises}} afoot," [...] he admitted, [...] "but I don't know, <b>after</b> all, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wish you particularly to be mixed up in them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{dialogue}} {{seems to}} have been darned sparkling but I don't remember it. It must have been <b>after</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> stopped one. I don't seem quite to have caught up with myself since I got hit." ...|$|R
500|$|On July 29, 1966, Dylan crashed his Triumph {{motorcycle}} {{near his}} home in Woodstock, New York, suffering cracked vertebrae and a mild concussion. The concerts he was scheduled to perform had to be cancelled. Biographer Clinton Heylin wrote in 1990 on the significance of the crash: [...] "A quarter of a century on, Dylan's motorcycle accident is still viewed as the pivot of his career. As a sudden, abrupt moment when his wheel really did explode. The great irony is that 1967—the year after the accident—remains his most prolific year as a songwriter." [...] In a 1969 Rolling Stone interview with Jann Wenner, Dylan said, [...] "I had a dreadful motorcycle accident which put me away for a while, and I still didn't sense the importance of that accident till at least a year <b>after</b> <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> realized that it was a real accident. I mean I thought that I was just gonna get up and go back to doing what I was doing before ... but I couldn't do it anymore." ...|$|E
500|$|Stan Love, Wilson's {{cousin and}} band manager, fired Landy in December 1976 when Landy doubled his fee. Landy remembered 15 Big Ones as [...] "the only major success" [...] the Beach Boys had in recent years; [...] "Brian and I did that together. Right <b>after</b> <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> {{had to leave}} the situation. ... I was {{interested}} in making Brian a whole human being; they [...] were interested in getting another album done in time for 1977." [...] In 1977, Wilson was asked if Landy had too much control; he said, [...] "I thought so, but there was nothing I could do about it and I eventually gave in to it.... control of my life legally through the commitment of my wife.... He definitely helped me. It cost over a hundred thousand dollars – he charged {{a hell of a lot}} per month." [...] Wilson then reported that Landy was replaced with a new doctor, Steve Schwartz. After several sessions with Wilson, Schwartz died in a camping accident, falling off a mountain to his death.|$|E
500|$|After {{returning}} to New York, the New York Dolls played to capacity crowds at venues such as Max's Kansas City and the Mercer Arts Center in what Sylvain called a determined effort to [...] "fake it {{until they could}} make it": [...] "We had to make ourselves feel famous before we could actually become famous. We acted like we were already rock stars. Arthur even called his bass 'Excalibur' after King Arthur. It was crazy." [...] Their performance at the Mercer Arts Center was attended by journalist and Mercury Records publicity director Bud Scoppa, and Paul Nelson, an A executive for the label. Scoppa initially viewed them as an amusing but inferior version of the Rolling Stones: [...] "I split after the first set. Paul stuck around for the second set, though, and after show he called me and said, 'You should have stayed. I think they're really special.' Then, <b>after</b> <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> {{fell in love with}} them anyway." [...] In March 1973, the group signed a two-album deal with a US $25,000 advance from Mercury. According to Sylvain, some of the members' parents had to sign for them because they were not old enough to sign themselves.|$|E
