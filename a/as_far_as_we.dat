5|$|<b>As</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> know, the {{earliest}} cantatas of Johann Sebastian Bach were performed in Mühlhausen from 1706 to 1708. He was employed as an organist there, but he occasionally composed cantatas, mostly for special occasions. The cantatas were based mainly on biblical texts and hymns, such as Aus der Tiefen rufe ich, Herr, zu dir, BWV 131 (a psalm setting), and the Easter chorale cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden, BWV 4.|$|E

25|$|Archimedes' cattle problem; its {{solution}} (absent {{from the}} manuscript) requires solving an indeterminate quadratic equation (which reduces {{to what would}} later be misnamed Pell's equation). <b>As</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> know, such equations were first successfully treated by the Indian school. It is not known whether Archimedes himself had a method of solution.|$|E

25|$|Marlovians {{argue that}} if Frizer, Poley and Skeres could lie about what happened, they {{could just as easily}} have been lying about the {{identity}} of the corpse itself. In other words, that although they claimed it was Marlowe's—and <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> know they were the only ones there in a position to identify him—it was in fact someone else's body that the jury was called upon to examine.|$|E
25|$|Based {{on these}} data sources, {{scientists}} {{think that the}} most abundant chemical elements in the martian crust, besides silicon and oxygen, are iron, magnesium, aluminum, calcium, and potassium. These elements are major components of the minerals comprising igneous rocks. The elements titanium, chromium, manganese, sulfur, phosphorus, sodium, and chlorine are less abundant but are still important components of many accessory minerals in rocks and of secondary minerals (weathering products) in the dust and soils (the regolith). Hydrogen is present as water (H2O) ice and in hydrated minerals. Carbon occurs as carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere and sometimes as dry ice at the poles. An unknown amount of carbon is also stored in carbonates. Molecular nitrogen (N2) makes up 2.7 percent of the atmosphere. <b>As</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> know, organic compounds are absent except for a trace of methane detected in the atmosphere.|$|E
25|$|T-Cell-B-Cell {{discordance}} – A normal {{immune response}} {{is assumed to}} involve B and T cell responses to the same antigen, even if we know that B cells and T cells recognise very different things: conformations {{on the surface of}} a molecule for B cells and pre-processed peptide fragments of proteins for T cells. However, there is nothing <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> know that requires this. All that is required is that a B cell recognising antigen X endocytoses and processes a protein Y (normally =X) and presents it to a T cell. Roosnek and Lanzavecchia showed that B cells recognising IgGFc could get help from any T cell responding to an antigen co-endocytosed with IgG by the B cell as part of an immune complex. In coeliac disease it seems likely that B cells recognising tissue transglutamine are helped by T cells recognising gliadin.|$|E

500|$|In November 2015, guitarist James Valentine {{spoke about}} the band's {{strategy}} moving onto their sixth studio album, saying the group wanted [...] "to make a more traditional record next ... like the way we made Songs About Jane, just sitting {{in a room with}} our instruments and slugging it out. It’s been fun to experiment on the last couple of records with the more electronic sounds, but maybe we’ve gone <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> can with that for now." ...|$|E
500|$|Kolb {{expressed}} {{his desire to}} be the starting quarterback for the Eagles during the 2010 offseason: [...] "Obviously {{my goal is to}} be the starter and to start for 16 games and to lead this team <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> can go. Personally, I don't have a lot of personal goals right now, they're more team-oriented, besides me getting on the field and proving I can take over this thing." [...] Kolb gained many comparisons to the situation Aaron Rodgers endured backing up Brett Favre during his first three seasons. Kolb and Rodgers reached out to one another to share their similar plights.|$|E
500|$|Aside from this, Adams {{generally}} stayed quiet. He did {{not publicly}} criticize Jefferson's actions as president, believing that [...] "instead of opposing Systematically any Administration, running down their Characters and opposing all their Measures right or wrong, We ought to Support every Administration <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>We</b> can in Justice." [...] He did, however, privately attack the president over his Embargo Act, {{despite the fact}} that it was voted for by his son John Quincy, a U.S. senator. Another incident began in relation to Mercy Otis Warren in 1806. Warren, an old friend, had attacked Adams in a pamphlet for his [...] "partiality for monarchy" [...] and [...] "pride of talents and much ambition." [...] A tempestuous correspondence ensued. In time, the friendship healed.|$|E

5000|$|Gibson {{described}} Khan’s vocal {{contribution to}} the score:“He’s a valuable asset to our soundtrack. His dulcet tones add emotion and drama, {{and we have a}} very narrow palette <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> orchestra. <b>We</b> don’t have an orchestra so he is fulfilling a lot of the functions that would usually be supplied by the use of a full orchestra. Just all in one man; he’s a one-man band.” ...|$|R
500|$|Alan Baker broadly agrees, stating, [...] "There is no {{evidence}} that this was common practice among gladiators. <b>As</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> know, the only time this phrase was used was at an event staged by Claudius." [...] Plass notes that [...] "it is hard to see why or how the phrase came to be used on this occasion if it was not a regular formula. On the other hand, if it was something that Claudius might expect to hear it would more naturally serve in its role as a feed line for his repartee portraying his invincible gaucherie." [...] He comments on the distancing effect of the Latin source and the first person of the Greek source and notes that the interpretation and response by the fighters [...] "seems to be a maneuver within rules governing clemency in the arena".|$|E
500|$|Joe Lynch of Billboard {{described}} the song as [...] "an immediately familiar track with an epic, arresting chorus." [...] Lewis Corner of Digital Spy wrote the track [...] "nips at its heels", giving emphasis to [...] "the space Madonna's voice {{is given to}} shine—something we'd like to hear more often". Lauren Murphy of The Irish Times described it as an [...] "old-school pop" [...] song and picked it as a standout track, whilst John Marrs of Gay Times claimed that [...] "the mid-tempo track underpinned by a dirty bass bears {{little resemblance to the}} sparse, pedestrian demo," [...] also noting that [...] "when the melody is lush as this, she could be singing a recipe from Mary Berry's cookbook <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> care." [...] Amy Pettifer of The Quietus saw it as [...] "Shakira's 'Whenever, Wherever' as seen through the murky lens of a lost generation." ...|$|E
500|$|Nansen's plan {{required}} a small, strong and manoeuvrable ship, powered by sail and an engine, {{capable of carrying}} fuel and provisions for twelve men for five years. The vessel would follow Jeannette's route to the New Siberian Islands, and in the approximate position of Jeannette's sinking, when ice conditions were right [...] "we shall plough our way in amongst the ice <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> can." [...] The ship would then drift with the ice towards the pole and eventually reach the sea between Greenland and Spitsbergen. Should the ship founder, a possibility which Nansen thought very unlikely, the party would camp on a floe and allow itself to be carried towards safety. Nansen observed: [...] "If the Jeannette Expedition had had sufficient provisions, and had remained on the ice-floe on which the relics were found, the result would doubtless have been {{very different from what}} it was." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{roads were}} muddy and frozen {{and we had}} to bounce along in the ruts, riding on the verges between the posts that were spaced every 20 metres <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> Pavia. <b>We</b> rode the first 32km in 56 minutes, the 53km from Milan to Voghera in 1h 50. There were attacks after attack and {{it was more like a}} course des primes than a long-distance race...|$|R
5000|$|Forster and Foster {{came under}} fire from {{organized}} labor for having allegedly selected judges for the workers compensation program who were inclined to favor business over employees. The pair denied the charge. Governor Foster said: “All I've ever asked the department to do [...] - [...] <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> anybody <b>we</b> appointed [...] - [...] was just to get good, fair judges, not biased on either side.” ...|$|R

Indeed it was too much to believe, but the Major laughed our doubts to scorn.|$|R
500|$|Following {{the initial}} {{announcement}} of its revival, {{the race was}} subject to criticism in light of Azerbaijan's human rights record as the race was established with the financial support of the Azerbaijani government. On 7 June 2016, the organisation Sport for Rights called for Bernie Ecclestone to speak out about the human rights situation in the country, having written {{an open letter to}} him to which Ecclestone had not replied. Sport for Rights {{made it clear that they}} did not call for a cancellation of the race, but instead urged the sport to use the race to promote these issues in public. Ecclestone replied a week later, saying that Formula One had [...] "a clear conscience" [...] on human rights and added: [...] "I tell you what we ought to do. <b>As</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> are concerned, not have any races where there is corruption in the country. Can you tell me where we are going to be racing?" ...|$|E
500|$|The game's {{most common}} {{criticism}} is the {{heavy emphasis on}} sailing, especially later in the game when Link must trek around the ocean to collect Triforce pieces. GameSpot wrote that while the main quest [...] "starts out in a very brisk manner", by {{the last third of}} the game, the [...] "focus on sailing ... is pretty tedious". Edge wrote that the sailing was [...] "convincingly organic", but even with the warp feature, [...] "there remains an awful lot of relatively dull seafaring activity". Others complained about having to use the Wind Waker so frequently to change wind direction. IGN wrote that using the device became [...] "a tedious nuisance", and that the inability to skip the accompanying animation was [...] "more bothersome still". Some reviewers enjoyed the sailing; two Electronic Gaming Monthly reviewers appreciated the combat, exploration, and side quests available at sea. Another common criticism was the game's comparatively low level of difficulty. IGN wrote that once the player added enough hearts to Link's health meter, [...] "he becomes nearly invincible, which is a true shortcoming <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> concerned".|$|E
500|$|... "All You Need Is Love" [...] was {{originally}} {{released in the}} UK as a limited edition one-side promotional 12" [...] on 9 March 1987.

[...] The re-release included the tracks [...] "Ivum Naya (Ibo Version)" [...] (a version of [...] "All You Need Is Love" [...] with Chike on lead vocals), and [...] "Rap, Rhyme and Scratch Yourself" [...] (an instrumental version of the song, [...] "a stripped down beatbox track for anybody to feel free {{to do what they}} want with" [...] according to King Boy D).

5000|$|As {{explained}} by Alex Kortt, [...] "the reason {{for doing the}} two EPs was to do with giving people a good snapshot of where we’re at musically. Not only that, but to really make sure that before we do an album we know exactly the direction we want to take. I mean <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> where <b>we</b> were at mentally we probably just weren’t at the stage where {{we wanted to do}} an album just yet." ...|$|R
500|$|The first {{war ended}} in 1851, but would resume in 1864. During this interlude, Ernest fervently opposed the {{marriage}} of his nephew Albert Edward, Prince of Wales ('Bertie') to Princess Alexandra of Denmark, a daughter of the future Christian IX of Denmark (and therefore {{an enemy of the}} German states). He believed that such a match flew in the face of German interests. Albert replied angrily [...] "What has {{that got to do with}} you?... Vicky has racked her brains to help us to find someone, but in vain...We have no [...] choice". Albert agreed there were going to be problems with the match, but as he could find no alternative bride, he wrote to Ernest that keeping the affair a private matter (and outside the realm of government) was [...] "the only way to prevent a break with Prussia and the only way to keep the game in our own hands, impose the conditions that we think necessary, and <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> can, take off its political edge". Albert also warned his son of Ernest's endeavors to interfere with the match, commenting, [...] "Your uncle...will try his hand at this work. Your best defence will be not to enter on the subject, should he broach it".|$|E
500|$|Orr {{was also}} {{involved}} in the 1991 lawsuit of retired NHL players against the NHL over its control of the players' pension fund. Eagleson was involved there too, arranging for the players {{to give up a}} seat on the trusteeship of the pension fund in 1969 to gain the acceptance of the NHLPA with the NHL owners. Orr and ex-Bruin Dave Forbes discussed the lawsuit with the sports newspaper The National. Orr: [...] "Our money is being used to pay pensions for current players". The NHL's response was to file a notice of libel and slander against Orr and Forbes. Carl Brewer defended Orr in a letter to then-NHL president John Ziegler: [...] "It is regrettable that the NHL and the member clubs would resort to such treatment of one of our game's icons, Bobby Orr. And isn't it interesting that baseball players who started their pension plan in 1947, as did the NHL, have assets in their plan of some US$500 million while we, <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> can understand, have US$31.9 million." [...] The pension lawsuit was finally won by the players in 1994 after two courts ruled against the NHL. The NHL had appealed the case to the Supreme Court of Canada which decided not to hear the case.|$|E
500|$|Spotnitz's {{favorite}} magician was Ricky Jay, and so, for the episode, Jay {{was brought}} in to play the part of The Amazing Maleeni. Initially, however, the episode hit a snag. The production crew discovered that Jay's production agency had not been informed and that he would be unable to guest star in the episode. The staff's back-up magician, David Blaine, was unavailable for shooting as well. Series creator Chris Carter, however, later stated that the show would not take no for an answer: [...] "We got on the phone with him. He agreed to come to our offices to talk about the script and ended up doing some card tricks for us that reduced Frank and I to being six-year-olds again." [...] Jay eventually agreed to do the part, but requested that he only do the tricks he was accustomed to doing. Thus, many of Jay's trademark tricks were included in the episode's script. Gilligan, in retrospect, later noted, [...] "There was no choice other than Ricky Jay <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> were concerned. He was not looking forward to the idea of playing a magician because I think he felt that magicians were never portrayed very realistically in movies or television shows." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is {{reasonable}} enough," [...] Cuthbert agreed. [...] "I expect the gates {{will be open}} {{in a day or}} two, and I shall go to England at once and try {{to get to the bottom}} of this matter. I should think the Prussians will let Englishmen pass out at once. Would you mind going with me <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> Calais? <b>We</b> can get the document sworn to in legal form and you can then come back here." ...|$|R
