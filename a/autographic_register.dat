50|$|Although the <b>Autographic</b> <b>Register</b> {{has been}} largely {{replaced}} by newer technology it remains in use as of 2015.|$|E
50|$|An <b>Autographic</b> <b>Register</b> is a {{business}} machine invented in 1883 by James C. Shoup. The device consisted two separate rolls of paper interleaved with carbon paper. Usually {{one or both of}} the rolls would be preprinted with form information. To operate the machine the user would write, for example, a sales receipt and the machine automatically produced a copy. The crank on the machine ejected the records and moved a blank form into view. The original receipt produced would go to the user and the copy was filed. Shoup founded the <b>Autographic</b> <b>Register</b> Company in Hoboken, NJ to manufacture his invention.|$|E
5000|$|This {{paper type}} was {{developed}} for use with <b>autographic</b> <b>registers</b> around 1910, was later adopted by tabulating machines beginning in the 1920s, and its use grew {{with the introduction of}} commercial computers in the 1950s. IBM cards, preprinted, optionally numbered and pre-punched, were available as continuous form cards and were used for checks and other documents. [...] Continuous form paper became widely used and well known to the general public in the 1980s due to the development of microcomputers and inexpensive dot-matrix consumer printers.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Autographic</b> <b>Register</b> was {{an advance}} over use of {{separate}} forms and carbon paper as it guaranteed that the copy {{was made and}} kept the forms in relative alignment. A number of advancements were soon made, {{including the use of}} sprocket-fed paper, invented by Theodore Schirmer. This helped avoid slippage and misalignment of forms, allowing more copies to be produced simultaneously. In 1912 Schirmer founded the Standard Register Company in Dayton, Ohio.|$|E
5000|$|Taylor Communications {{was founded}} as Standard Register Co. in Dayton, Ohio in 1912. Brothers John and William Sherman, along with local Dayton {{inventor}} Theodore Shirmer, founded {{the company to}} sell the pinfeed <b>autographic</b> <b>register,</b> a device invented by Shirmer. The device enabled multiple copies of printed forms to be fed through the machine using a hand-cranked wooden cylinder. Over the next century, Standard Register rose to prominence {{as one of the}} largest printed communications companies in the United States.|$|E
