40|$|Our {{previous}} studies {{as well as}} analysis of literature data revealed that pharmaceuticals with aliphatic <b>amine</b> <b>function</b> exert an extraordinary high toxicity in algae, {{which is similar to}} that exhibited by specifically acting herbicides. However, the clear identification of the underlying mode of action is still pending because the time and endpoint pattern pointed to baseline toxicity despite the high toxic ratio (ratio between predicted baseline toxicity EC 50 and experimental EC 50), which serves as a measure for specificity of effect. On this basis we hypothesize that the high toxicity of amines in algae is not due to a highly specific mode of toxic action but due to speciation effects of the <b>amine</b> <b>function.</b> The pH-dependent toxicity of 5 basic pharmaceuticals can be explained by an ion-trapping mechanism. We hypothesize that only the neutral species can permeate the membrane. Since algae are capable of biological homeostasis, the fraction of charged species can be different in the cytoplasm and in the external medium depending on the pH in the cytoplasm and the acidity of the base. If the high toxicity of basic pharmaceuticals in algae is a speciation effect, then the internal effect concentrations in the cytoplasm and at the target membranes should be similar with varying external pH values. The developed model shows that the specific toxicity of basic pharmaceuticals with <b>amine</b> <b>function</b> in algae is a toxicokinetic effect, not a toxicodynamic effect related to a specific mode of toxic action.

The biological profile of polyamines 4 - 7 revealed that increasing the number of <b>amine</b> <b>functions</b> and the chain length separating these nitrogen atoms led to a significant improvement in potency at nAChRs. Moreover, the role of the number and type of <b>amine</b> <b>functions</b> in the interaction with nAChRs was further investigated through the synthesis of compounds 9 and 10. Tetraamines 8 and 11, bearing a rather rigid spacer between the nitrogen atoms instead of the very flexible polymethylene chain, displayed a profile similar to that of 1 at nAChRs, whereas a significant decrease in potency was observed at mAChRs. Tetraamine 12, bearing a 2 -methoxyphenethyl group, was less potent than 1, whereas tetraamine 13, carrying a diphenylethyl moiety, was more potent than 1, confirming that an increase in size of the hydrophobic group on the terminal nitrogen atoms increases significantly the binding affinity for nAChRs. Tetraamines 14 - 17 were significantly more potent than prototype 2 at both frog rectus and Torpedo nAChRs, confirming that an increase in the distance between the <b>amine</b> <b>functions</b> results in a parallel increase in the affinity for nAChRs.
