5|$|Antivirals {{may reduce}} <b>asymptomatic</b> {{shedding}}; <b>asymptomatic</b> genital HSV-2 viral shedding {{is believed to}} occur on 20% of days per year in patients not undergoing antiviral treatment, versus 10% of days while on antiviral therapy.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 33% {{of people}} with {{influenza}} are <b>asymptomatic.</b>|$|E
5|$|Many people {{infected}} with HSV-2 display no physical symptoms—individuals with no symptoms {{are described as}} <b>asymptomatic</b> or as having subclinical herpes.|$|E
5|$|Primary HIV infection: May {{be either}} <b>asymptomatic</b> or {{associated}} with acute retroviral syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Two {{different}} concepts {{have been}} used for decompression modelling. The first assumes that dissolved gas is eliminated while in the dissolved phase, and that bubbles are not formed during <b>asymptomatic</b> decompression. The second, which is supported by experimental observation, assumes that bubbles are formed during most <b>asymptomatic</b> decompressions, and that gas elimination must consider both dissolved and bubble phases.|$|E
5|$|A fungal {{infection}} explains the symptoms observed in AD patients. The slow progression of AD fits with the chronic nature of some systemic {{fungal infection}}s, {{which can be}} <b>asymptomatic</b> and thus, unnoticed and untreated.|$|E
5|$|Another {{disorder}} {{is that of}} thyroid dysgenesis which can result in various presentations {{of one or more}} misplaced accessory thyroid glands. These can be <b>asymptomatic.</b>|$|E
5|$|Chagas {{disease is}} a growing problem in Europe, because the {{majority}} of cases with chronic infection are <b>asymptomatic</b> and because of migration from Latin America.|$|E
5|$|LEMS {{is often}} {{associated}} with lung cancer (50–70%), specifically small-cell carcinoma, making LEMS a paraneoplastic syndrome. Of the people with small-cell lung cancer, 1–3% have LEMS. In most of these cases, LEMS is the first symptom of the lung cancer, and it is otherwise <b>asymptomatic.</b>|$|E
5|$|Stage I: HIV {{infection}} is <b>asymptomatic</b> with a CD4+ T cell count (also known as CD4 count) greater than 500 per microlitre (µl or cubic mm) of blood. May include generalized lymph node enlargement.|$|E
5|$|Urinary tract {{infections are}} the most {{frequent}} bacterial infection in women. They occur most frequently {{between the ages of}} 16 and 35years, with 10% of women getting an infection yearly and more than 40–60% having an infection {{at some point in their}} lives. Recurrences are common, with nearly half of people getting a second infection within a year. Urinary tract infections occur four times more frequently in females than males. Pyelonephritis occurs between 20–30 times less frequently. They {{are the most}} common cause of hospital acquired infections accounting for approximately 40%. Rates of <b>asymptomatic</b> bacteria in the urine increase with age from two to seven percent in women of child bearing age to as high as 50% in elderly women in care homes. Rates of <b>asymptomatic</b> bacteria in the urine among men over 75 are between 7-10%. <b>Asymptomatic</b> bacteria in the urine occurs in 2% to 10% of pregnancies.|$|E
5|$|About 90% {{of those}} {{infected}} with M. tuberculosis have <b>asymptomatic,</b> latent TB infections (sometimes called LTBI), {{with only a}} 10% lifetime chance that the latent infection will progress to overt, active tuberculous disease. In those with HIV, {{the risk of developing}} active TB increases to nearly 10% a year. If effective treatment is not given, the death rate for active TB cases is up to 66%.|$|E
5|$|Adrenal {{tumors are}} {{commonly}} found as incidentalomas, unexpected <b>asymptomatic</b> tumors found during medical imaging. They {{are seen in}} around 3.4% of CT scans, {{and in most cases}} they are benign adenomas. Adrenal carcinomas are very rare, with an incidence of 1 case per million per year.|$|E
5|$|Although an RST cannot {{distinguish}} GAS infection from <b>asymptomatic</b> carriage of the organism, most authorities recommend antibiotic {{treatment in}} the event of a positive RST result from a person with a sore throat. US guidelines recommend following up a negative result with a microbial culture, whereas European guidelines suggest relying on the negative RST.|$|E
5|$|By contrast, ovarian cancer, {{the leading}} cause of {{reproductive}} organ cancer deaths, and the fifth commonest cause of cancer deaths in women in the United States, lacks an effective screening programme, and is predominantly a disease of women in industrialised countries. Because it is largely <b>asymptomatic</b> in its earliest stages, more than 50% of women have stage III or higher cancer (spread beyond the ovaries) by the time they are diagnosed, with a consequent poor prognosis.|$|E
5|$|Chronic {{prostatitis}} in {{the forms}} of chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome and chronic bacterial prostatitis (not acute bacterial prostatitis or <b>asymptomatic</b> inflammatory prostatitis) may cause recurrent urinary tract infections in males. Risk of infections increases as males age. While bacteria is commonly present in the urine of older males this {{does not appear to}} affect the risk of urinary tract infections.|$|E
5|$|Definitive {{criteria}} include histopathologic {{evidence of}} endometritis, thickened filled Fallopian tubes, or laparoscopic findings. Gram stain/smear becomes definitive {{in the identification}} of rare, atypical and possibly more serious organisms. Two thirds of patients with laparoscopic evidence of previous PID were not aware they had PID, but even <b>asymptomatic</b> PID can cause serious harm.|$|E
5|$|Enlargement of the spleen {{may occur}} in AML, {{but it is}} {{typically}} mild and <b>asymptomatic.</b> Lymph node swelling is rare in AML, in contrast to acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The skin is involved about 10% {{of the time in}} the form of leukemia cutis. Rarely, Sweet's syndrome, a paraneoplastic inflammation of the skin, can occur with AML.|$|E
5|$|Human {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) is {{the most}} commonly transmitted sexually transmitted infection, affecting both men and women. While most infections are <b>asymptomatic</b> and are cleared by the immune system, some types of the virus cause genital warts, and other types, if untreated, cause various forms of cancer, including cervical cancer, and penile cancer. Genital warts and cervical cancer {{are the two most}} common problems resulting from HPV.|$|E
5|$|If the {{dissolved}} {{inert gases}} {{come out of}} solution within the tissues {{of the body and}} form bubbles, they may cause the condition known as decompression sickness, or DCS, also known as divers' disease, the bends or caisson disease. However, not all bubbles result in symptoms, and doppler bubble detection shows that venous bubbles are present in a significant number of <b>asymptomatic</b> divers after relatively mild hyperbaric exposures.|$|E
5|$|Others {{argue that}} there is no {{available}} evidence that demonstrates that any of these organisms are capable of causing aphthous stomatitis by themselves. Some people with aphthous stomatitis may show herpes virus within the epithelium of the mucosa, but without any productive infection. In some persons, attacks of ulceration occur {{at the same time as}} <b>asymptomatic</b> viral shedding and elevated viral titres. However, antiviral medication has no effect on aphthous stomatitis.|$|E
5|$|People who are <b>asymptomatic</b> (for instance, those {{diagnosed}} through {{family screening}} or {{only as a}} result of abnormal test results) are generally treated, as the copper accumulation may cause long-term damage in the future. It is unclear whether these people are best treated with penicillamine or zinc acetate.|$|E
5|$|Study of the H. pylori genome is {{centered}} on attempts to understand pathogenesis, the ability of this organism to cause disease. About 29% of the loci have acolonization defectwhen mutated. Two of sequenced strains have an around 40-kb-long Cag pathogenicity island (a common gene sequence believed responsible for pathogenesis) that contains over 40 genes. This pathogenicity island is usually absent from H. pylori strains isolated from humans who are carriers of H. pylori but remain <b>asymptomatic.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{findings}} on renal biopsy correlate with {{the severity of}} symptoms: those with <b>asymptomatic</b> hematuria may only have focal mesangial proliferation while those with proteinuria may have marked cellular proliferation or even crescent formation. The number of crescentic glomeruli is an important prognostic factor in determining whether the patient will develop chronic renal disease.|$|E
5|$|The {{infectious}} disease hepatitis C {{is caused by}} the hepatitis C virus (HCV), which affects the liver and is transmitted by blood-to-blood contact, or by exposure to another person's infected blood. The infection is often <b>asymptomatic,</b> but chronic infection can cause inflammation of the liver (chronic hepatitis). This condition can progress to scarring of the liver (fibrosis), and advanced scarring (cirrhosis). In some cases, those with cirrhosis go on to develop liver failure or liver cancer.|$|E
5|$|Helicobacter pylori, {{previously}} Campylobacter pylori, is a gram-negative, microaerophilic bacterium found {{usually in}} the stomach. It was identified in 1982 by Australian scientists Barry Marshall and Robin Warren, who {{found that it was}} present in a person with chronic gastritis and gastric ulcers, conditions not previously believed to have a microbial cause. It is also linked to the development of duodenal ulcers and stomach cancer. However, over 80% of individuals infected with the bacterium are <b>asymptomatic,</b> and it may {{play an important role in}} the natural stomach ecology.|$|E
5|$|In 1965 Hugh LeMessurier and Brian Andrew Hills {{published}} their paper, A thermodynamic approach {{arising from}} a study on Torres Strait diving techniques, which suggested that decompression following schedules based on conventional models results in <b>asymptomatic</b> bubble formation which must then be re-dissolved at the decompression stops {{before it can be}} eliminated. This is slower than allowing the gas to be eliminated while it is still in solution, and indicates the importance of minimising bubble phase gas for efficient decompression.|$|E
5|$|In benign infections {{found in}} some wild and captive African elephants, these viruses can affect either the skin or the {{pulmonary}} system. In the former case, it produces small pinkish nodules {{on the head and}} trunk in juveniles, which appear for a few weeks and then regress, suggesting an intermittently reactivated localized infection that mostly remains dormant. In the second case, it has been found in small white pulmonary nodules on necropsy of many <b>asymptomatic</b> adults. These are both characteristic of EEHV2, EEHV3 and EEHV6.|$|E
5|$|Normally the plantar fascia {{has three}} {{fascicle}}s {{with the central}} fascicle thickest at 4mm, the lateral fascicle at 2mm and the medial at less than a millimeter in thickness. In theory, the likeliness of fasciitis increases with increasing thickness of plantar fascia at the calcaneal insertion, with thickness of more than 4.5mm being somewhat useful on ultrasound and 4mm on MRI. Findings on imaging such as plantar aponeurosis thickening, however, may be absent in symptomatic individuals or present in <b>asymptomatic</b> individuals thereby limiting the utility of such observations.|$|E
5|$|Repetitive diving {{occurs when}} two dives are {{separated}} by a short surface interval, during which the diver has not completely outgassed from the first dive. The gas loading from the first dive must then {{be taken into account}} when determining no stop times and decompression requirements for the second dive. Multiple decompressions per day over multiple days can increase the risk of decompression sickness because of the buildup of <b>asymptomatic</b> bubbles, which reduce the rate of off-gassing and are not accounted for in most decompression algorithms.|$|E
5|$|Roughly {{one-third of}} the world's {{population}} has been infected with M. tuberculosis, with new infections occurring in about 1% of the population each year. However, most infections with M. tuberculosis do not cause TB disease, and 90–95% of infections remain <b>asymptomatic.</b> In 2012, an estimated 8.6 million chronic cases were active. In 2010, 8.8 million new cases of TB were diagnosed, and 1.20–1.45 million deaths occurred, most of these occurring in developing countries. Of these 1.45 million deaths, about 0.35million occur in those also infected with HIV.|$|E
5|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} {{take time to}} develop, {{and as many as}} half of cases are <b>asymptomatic</b> at the initial presentation. The more severe the injury, the more quickly symptoms become apparent. In severe cases, symptoms may occur as quickly as three or fourhours after the trauma. Hypoxemia (low oxygen concentration in the arterial blood) typically becomes progressively worse over 24–48hours after injury. In general, pulmonary contusion tends to worsen slowly over a few days, but it may also cause rapid deterioration or death if untreated.|$|E
5|$|Spinal cord {{injuries}} {{are most often}} caused by physical trauma. Forces involved can be hyperflexion (forward movement of the head); hyperextension (backward movement); lateral stress (sideways movement); rotation (twisting of the head); compression (force along the axis of the spine downward from the head or upward from the pelvis); or distraction (pulling apart of the vertebrae). Traumatic SCI can result in contusion, compression, or stretch injury. It is a major risk of many types of vertebral fracture. Pre-existing <b>asymptomatic</b> congenital anomalies can cause major neurological deficits, such as hemiparesis, to result from otherwise minor trauma.|$|E
5|$|The {{practice}} of decompression by divers comprises {{the planning and}} monitoring of the profile indicated by the algorithms or tables of the chosen decompression model, to allow <b>asymptomatic</b> and harmless release of excess inert gases dissolved in the tissues {{as a result of}} breathing at ambient pressures greater than surface atmospheric pressure, the equipment available and appropriate to the circumstances of the dive, and the procedures authorized for the equipment and profile to be used. There is a large range of options in all of these aspects.|$|E
5|$|Urine {{catecholamine}} level can be elevated in pre-clinical neuroblastoma. Screening <b>asymptomatic</b> infants {{at three}} weeks, six months, {{and one year}} has been performed in Japan, Canada, Austria and Germany since the 1980s. Japan began screening six-month-olds for neuroblastoma via analysis of the levels of homovanillic acid and vanilmandelic acid in 1984. Screening was halted in 2004 after studies in Canada and Germany showed no reduction in deaths due to neuroblastoma, but rather caused an increase in diagnoses that would have disappeared without treatment, subjecting those infants to unnecessary surgery and chemotherapy.|$|E
25|$|The term <b>asymptomatic</b> {{means that}} the person has no symptoms. The term <b>asymptomatic</b> should not be equated with absence of disease. Most {{diseases}} have no symptoms early in the disease process. A pain free or <b>asymptomatic</b> tooth can still be infected for many years before pain symptoms develop.|$|E
