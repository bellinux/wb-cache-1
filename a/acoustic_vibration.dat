40|$|This paper {{explores the}} use of low-frequency-low-amplitude <b>acoustic</b> <b>vibration</b> on biofilm formation. Biofilm growth {{is thought to be}} governed by a diverse range of {{environmental}} stresses and much effort has gone into researching the effects of environmental factors including; nutrient availability, pH and temperature on the growth of biofilms. Many biofilm-forming organisms have evolved to thrive in mechanically challenging environments, for example soil, yet the effects of the physical environment on biofilm formation has been largely ignored. Exposure of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to vibration at 100, 800 and 1600 Hz for 48 hours, resulted in a significant increase in biofilm formation compared to the control, with the greatest growth seen at 800 Hz vibration. The results also show that this increase in biofilm formation is accompanied with an increase in P. aeruginosa cell number. <b>Acoustic</b> <b>vibration</b> was also found to regulate the spatial distribution of biofilm formation in a frequency-dependent manner. Exposure of Staphylococcus aureus to <b>acoustic</b> <b>vibration</b> also resulted in enhanced biofilm formation with the greatest level of biofilm being formed following 48 hours exposure at 1600 Hz. These results show that <b>acoustic</b> <b>vibration</b> can be used to control biofilm formation and therefore presents a novel and potentially cost effective means to manipulate the development and yield of biofilms in a range of important industrial and medical processes...|$|E
40|$|Cells {{are known}} to {{interact}} and respond to external mechanical cues and recent work has 9 shown that application of mechanical stimulation, delivered via <b>acoustic</b> <b>vibration,</b> can be 10 used to control complex cell behaviours. Fibroblast cells {{are known to}} respond to physical 11 cues generated in the extracellular matrix and {{it is thought that}} such cues are important 12 regulators of the wound healing process. Many conditions are associated with poor wound 13 healing, so there is need for treatments/interventions, which can help accelerate the wound 14 healing process. The primary aim of this research was to investigate the effects of mechanical 15 stimulation upon the migratory and morphological properties of two different fibroblast cells 16 namely; human lung fibroblast cells (LL 24) and subcutaneous areolar/adipose mouse 17 fibroblast cells (L 929). Using a speaker-based system, the effects of mechanical stimulation 18 (0 - 1600 Hz for 5 minutes) on the mean cell migration distance (μm) and actin organisation 19 was investigated. The results show that 100 Hz <b>acoustic</b> <b>vibration</b> enhanced cell migration for 20 both cell lines whereas <b>acoustic</b> <b>vibration</b> above 100 Hz <b>acoustic</b> <b>vibration</b> was found to 21 decrease cell migration in a frequency dependent manner.

Overall lamellipodia was the most prominent actin structure 24 displayed by the lung cell (LL 24), whereas filopodia was the most prominent actin feature 25 displayed by the fibroblast derived from subcutaneous areolar/adipose tissue. Mechanical 26 stimulation at all the frequencies used here was found not to affect cell viability.

40|$|International audienceWe {{investigate}} the acousto-plasmonic dynamics of metallic nano-objects {{by means of}} resonant Raman scattering and time-resolved femtosecond transient absorption. We observe an unexpectedly strong <b>acoustic</b> <b>vibration</b> band in the Raman scattering of silver nanocolumns, usually not found in isolated nano-objects. The frequency and the polarization of this unexpected Raman band allow us to assign it to breathing-like <b>acoustic</b> <b>vibration</b> modes. On the basis of full electromagnetic near-field calculations coupled to the elasticity theory, we introduce a new concept of “acousto-plasmonic hot spots” which arise here because of the indented shape of the nanocolumns. These hot spots combine both highly localized surface plasmons and strong shape deformation by the acoustic vibrations at specific sites of the nano-objects.
