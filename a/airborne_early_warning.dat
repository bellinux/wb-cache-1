5|$|Although most U.S. {{aircraft}} losses {{continued to}} be inflicted by anti-aircraft fire, U.S. Air Force F-105s and Navy A-4 Skyhawks increasingly encountered SAMs and MiGs.

40|$|For <b>airborne</b> {{surveillance}} and <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> radars 360 ° coverage is a desirable feature. Future military airborne radars will have omnidirectional coverage combined with ground moving target indication (GMTI) capability, for instance by using STAP (space-time adaptive processing) for detection of slow moving targets.

40|$|The survey makes five main recommendations, as follows: 1. Develop a {{globally}} comprehensive <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> system, {{rooted in}} existing <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> systems and capacities A global <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> system will require long-term sustained action by diverse players, strong political commitment to engender public action {{and to make}} <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> a core task of national policy and disaster risk reduction strategy, strong international support and coordination, with clear roles and responsibilities and wide participation of NGO, private sector and regional organisations. 2. Build national people-centred <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> systems Country-based <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> systems are needed {{for the protection of}} citizens and also provide the building blocks of the global <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> system. The recommendation includes calls for a national multi-party roundtable on <b>early</b> <b>warning,</b> a national plan based on a survey of capabilities, a warning dissemination strategy, community-based approaches, public education and mock exercises. 3. Fill the main gaps in global <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> capacities The recommendation highlights gaps and opportunities that deserve immediate concerted action, including for tropical cyclones, floods and tsunamis for the most ill-protected populations, agreements and networking for drought, food security and wildland fire, a global survey and mobile monitoring facility for volcanoes and a major <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> project in each least-developed country. 4. Strengthen the scientific and data foundations for <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> The scientific and technical recommendation seeks action on a long-term global data plan, upgraded telecommunications, an agreement on basin-wide data exchange for floods, a pan-African project to fill major data gaps, improved hazard and vulnerability mapping, an <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> science and technology agenda and an internet portal for natural hazards, risks and warnings. 5. Develop the institutional foundations for a global <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> system This recommendation addresses the needs for underpinning mechanisms of international and regional governance, coordination and support, starting with a call for the UN system to affirm the goal of a global <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> system and including requests for various UN and international agencies in technical, humanitarian and development fields to undertake specific governance and support roles.

5|$|On taking office, Reagan {{was faced}} with the same {{decision}} as Carter before: whether {{to continue with the}} B-1 for the short term, or to wait {{for the development of the}} ATB, a much more advanced aircraft. Studies suggested that the existing B-52 fleet with ALCM would remain a credible threat until 1985. It was predicted that 75% of the B-52 force would survive to attack its targets. After this, the introduction of the SA-10 missile, the MiG-31 interceptor and the first Soviet <b>Airborne</b> <b>Early</b> <b>Warning</b> and Control (AWACS) systems would make the B-52 increasingly vulnerable. During 1981, funds were allocated to a new study for a bomber for the 1990s time-frame which led to developing the Long-Range Combat Aircraft (LRCA) project. The LRCA evaluated the B-1, F-111, and ATB as possible solutions; an emphasis was placed on multi-role capabilities, as opposed to purely strategic operations.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to review the {{literature}} on the recognition of the <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> signs of schizophrenia.

40|$|Community-based <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> systems involve {{community}} driven {{collection and}} analysis of information that enable warning messages to help a community to react to a hazard and reduce the resulting loss or harm. Most <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> systems are designed at the national or global level. Local communities’ capacity to predict weather conditions using indigenous knowledge has been demonstrated in studies focusing on climate change and agriculture in some African countries. This review was motivated by successes made in non-disease specific community-based <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> systems {{with a view to}} identify opportunities for developing similar systems for malaria. This article reviewed the existing community-based <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> systems documented in literature. The types of disasters that are addressed by these systems and the methodologies utilised {{in the development of the}} systems were identified. The review showed that most of the documented community-based <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> systems focus on natural disasters such as floods, drought, and landslides.

5|$|A {{helmet-mounted sight}} (HMS) {{developed}} by Luoyang Electro-Optics Technology Development Centre of AVIC {{was developed in}} parallel with the JF-17; it was first tested on Prototype 04 in 2006. It was dubbed as EO HMS, (Electro-Optical Helmet Mounted Sight) and was first revealed {{to the public in}} 2008 at the 7th Zhuhai Airshow, where a partial mock-up was on display. The HMS tracks the pilot's head and eye movements to guide missiles towards the pilot's visual target. An externally carried day/night laser designator targeting pod may be integrated with the avionics to guide laser-guided bombs (LGBs). An extra hardpoint may be added under the starboard air intake, opposite the cannon, for such pods. To reduce the numbers of targeting pods required, the aircraft's tactical data link can transmit target data to other aircraft not equipped with targeting pods.
