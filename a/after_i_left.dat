500|$|But Shankly soon regretted his {{decision}} {{and tried to}} continue his involvement with the club, mainly by turning up for team training at Melwood. He said he still wanted the involvement as the club had become his life. He soon stopped going to Melwood because he felt there was some resentment and people were asking {{what he was doing}} there. He felt unwanted, but [...] "I never resented the club <b>after</b> <b>I</b> <b>left,</b> as some stupid person wrote in the paper." [...] He still attended matches, but sat in the stand away from the directors and staff. He was especially annoyed that Liverpool did not invite him to attend away matches as the club's guest. When, finally, he was invited to travel with them to the away leg of the 1976 UEFA Cup Final in Bruges, he was accommodated in a separate hotel and said he found that insulting. Shankly contrasted Liverpool's attitude with what he encountered at other clubs, including Liverpool's great rivals Everton and Manchester United, where he was received warmly. He recalled Manchester United manager Tommy Docherty's reply to a Liverpool director: [...] "Aye, Bill's welcome here". About Everton, once his greatest rivals, he wrote: [...] "I have been received more warmly by Everton than I have by Liverpool. It is a scandal that I must write these words about the club I helped to build".|$|E
500|$|Beginning in late 2002, Gore {{began to}} {{publicly}} criticize the Bush administration. In a September 23, 2002, speech given before the Commonwealth Club of California, Gore criticized President George W. Bush and Congress for {{the rush to}} war prior to the outbreak of hostilities in Iraq. He compared this decision to the Persian Gulf War (which Gore had voted for) stating, [...] "Back in 1991, I {{was one of a}} handful of Democrats in the United States Senate to vote in favor of the resolution endorsing the Persian Gulf War [...] But look at the differences between the resolution that was voted on in 1991 and the one this administration is proposing that the Congress vote on in 2002. The circumstances are really completely different. To review a few of them briefly: in 1991, Iraq had crossed an international border, invaded a neighboring sovereign nation and annexed its territory. Now by contrast in 2002, there has been no such invasion." [...] In a speech given in 2004, during the presidential election, Gore accused George W. Bush of betraying the country by using the 9/11 attacks as a justification for the invasion of Iraq. The next year, Gore gave a speech which covered many topics, including what he called [...] "religious zealots" [...] who claim special knowledge of God's will in American politics. Gore stated: [...] "They even claim that those of us who disagree with their point of view are waging war against people of faith." [...] After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Gore chartered two planes to evacuate 270 people from New Orleans and criticized the Bush administration's response to the hurricane. In 2006, Gore criticized Bush's use of domestic wiretaps without a warrant. One month later, in a speech given at the Jeddah Economic Forum, Gore criticized the treatment of Arabs in the U.S. after 9/11 stating, [...] "Unfortunately there have been terrible abuses and it's wrong [...] I do want you to know that it does not represent the desires or wishes or feelings of the majority of the citizens of my country." [...] Gore's 2007 book, The Assault on Reason, is an analysis of what Gore refers to as the [...] "emptying out of the marketplace of ideas" [...] in civic discourse during the Bush administration. He attributes this phenomenon to the influence of television and argues that it endangers American democracy. By contrast, Gore argues, the Internet can revitalize and ultimately [...] "redeem the integrity of representative democracy." [...] In 2008, Gore argued against the ban of same-sex marriage on his Current TV website, stating, [...] "I think that gay men and women ought to have the same rights as heterosexual men and women to make contracts, have hospital visiting rights, and join together in marriage." [...] In a 2009 interview with CNN, Gore commented on former Vice President Dick Cheney's criticism of the Obama administration. Referring to his own previous criticism of the Bush administrations, Gore stated: [...] "I waited two years <b>after</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> office to make statements that were critical, and then of the policy [...] You know, you talk about somebody that shouldn't be talking about making the country less safe, invading a country that did not attack us and posed no serious threat to us at all." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1987 Mueller {{had this}} to say about the shuttle, [...] "It was clear to us at that time that we needed to have a joint program between the Air Force and NASA, and that that program ought to be aimed at {{providing}} low cost space transportation for all of our needs. It's just in my view unfortunate that we made the compromise, <b>after</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> NASA, in terms of a partially reusable vehicle, and all that that implies in terms of not only the cost of the throw-away parts but also the cost of the ground troops that have to process it and put it together and fly it every time. That combination—and ground support is a not insignificant part of a Shuttle cost—was a set of decisions that doomed low cost space transportation for that generation of vehicles." ...|$|E

A heroin conviction when I was loaded up by Detectives Peter and Tomich at the Lido bar. I have a further [...] "use" [...] charge in which Detectives Peter George and Jungblut were involved. In both the latter offences significant sums of money were paid to the police to effect the outcome...While operating as a prostitute I made regular payments {{to members of the}} Vice Squad over ten years. I have been involved in a number of transactions which I referred to in my statement which have involved substantial payment to members of the Drug Squad and other detectives relating to drug matters.

2500|$|The opera {{historian}} Harold Rosenthal {{wrote of}} the Moody-Manners company: [...] "With the Carl Rosa company, it was the principal training ground for British artists {{in the years before}} World War I." [...] Manners held strong views about the training given by British music academies to young singers. In his view students were not equipped for a professional career because they were trained in the principal operatic roles rather than in the chorus parts, which almost all singers new to the profession would need to sing before being promoted to leading roles. He instanced his own early career: [...] "I studied both at the Royal Academy, Dublin, and the Royal Academy, London, and then in Italy, and when I came back to London, all I could get was an engagement in comic opera where I sang for eighteen months before I could become a principal. It was not till over six years <b>after</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> my studies that I found anything I had learnt at the academies of any value to me." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Emery's judgement, {{claims that}} the Reagan administration's later [...] "tilt" [...] in favor of Iraq during the Iran–Iraq War was merely a {{continuation}} of Carter-era policies cannot be supported by available evidence: [...] "The policy that emerged was characterized {{by a desire to}} preserve all options, while trying to avoid actions that would undermine the Carter Doctrine or establish an opening for the Soviet Union. The impetus for America to adjust its policy of neutrality, and take a definitive position on which side to back, came in 1982, when the Iranian military threatened to overrun Iraq." [...] Indeed, [...] "the State Department's transition team advised the incoming government" [...] to avoid threatening Iran militarily or assisting the Iranian opposition, as doing so would [...] "make an eventual rapprochement with Iran more difficult." [...] In Carter's own account, [...] "I despised Saddam Hussein, because he attacked Iran when my hostages were being held. It was President Reagan who established diplomatic relations with Saddam Hussein <b>after</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> office." [...] Gibson averred: [...] "If Washington had any foreknowledge of the invasion, logic would suggest that the timing would be postponed until after the hostages were successfully released." [...] Regardless of whether the U.S. provided any express [...] "green light" [...] to Saddam, Iranians continue to view the failure of the United Nations Security Council to condemn Iraq's invasion—or to recognize Iraq as the aggressor until after Iraq's Invasion of Kuwait nearly a decade later—as a form of tacit complicity in Iraq's aggression against Iran—not just {{on the part of the}} U.S., but the entire world.|$|E
