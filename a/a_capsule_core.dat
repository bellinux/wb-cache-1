40|$|In this study, we {{fabricated}} self-healing solid capsules using cement powder, an inorganic-based {{material that}} is {{the same as that of}} cement composites. Self-healing solid capsules can be divided into two stages(capsule core preparation and capsule wall coating). First, the capsule core mixes the core material and the coagulant to form a core material dough having a proper quality, and then puts into <b>a</b> <b>capsule</b> <b>core</b> manufacturing machine. the next, it was produced through the pore chamber under the pressure of the capsule core making machine. Second, The capsule wall is formed by placing the prepared capsule core into the chamber of the capsule wall coating apparatus and then applying the wall material while the chamber is rotating. The prepared capsules were mixed with cement composites to evaluate fluidity and strength. That is, we evaluated the basic performance changes of cement composite materials with capsules. We will use the results of this paper as the base data to consider the optimal amount of capsule at the level that satisfies the performance required when mixing capsules...|$|E
40|$|The {{complete}} {{structures of}} LPS core types 1 and 2 from Klebsiella pneumoniae {{have been described}} by other authors. They are characterized {{by a lack of}} phosphoryl residues, but they contain galacturonic acid (GalA) residues, which contribute to the necessary negative charges. The presence of a capsule was determined in core-LPS non-polar mutants from strains 52145 (O 1 : K 2), DL 1 (O 1 : K 1) and C 3 (O 8 : K 66). O-antigen ligase (waaL) mutants produced <b>a</b> <b>capsule.</b> <b>Core</b> mutants containing the GalA residues were capsulated, while those lacking the residues were non capsulated. Since the proteins involved in the transfer of GalA (WabG) and glucosamine residues (WabH) are known, the chemical basis of the capsular-K 2 –cell-surface association was studied. Phenol/water extracts from K. pneumoniae 52145 DwabH waaL and 52145 DwaaL mutants, but not those from from K. pneumoniae 52145 DwabG waaL mutant, contained both LPS and capsular polysaccharide, even after hydrophobic chromatography. The two polysaccharides were dissociated by gel-filtration chromatography, eluting with detergent and metal-ion chelators. From these results, it is concluded that the K 2 capsular polysaccharide is associated by an ionic interaction to the LPS through the negative charge provided by the carboxyl groups of the GalA residues...|$|E
40|$|Background: Human {{glabrous skin}} has very rich nerve {{supply in the}} form of {{specialized}} nerve endings like Meissner&# 146;s corpuscles, Pacinian corpuscles, Krause end bulbs etc for carrying sensory information to brain. Aim of study: To study the structure, pattern of innervations and nerve terminations of human Meissner&# 146;s corpuscle. Methods: Skin samples from sixty human beings (age range 2 to 72 years) were taken, sections prepared and stained with a cytological (Haematoxylin &# 150; Eosin and Vongieson&# 146;s stains) and a neural stain (Silver Impregnation). Results: With cytological stain, Meissner&# 146;s corpuscles were seen in dermal papillae of glabrous skin, each consisting of a cellular structure having <b>a</b> peripheral <b>capsule</b> and central <b>core</b> of transversely arranged cells. With neural stain, each corpuscle was seen to be oval, globular or cylindrical structure, having <b>a</b> <b>capsule</b> surrounding the <b>core</b> of spirally arranged nerve fibers, sandwiched by Schwann cells. In between nerve fibers of the core were seen small bundles of collagen fibers. 2 - 6 nerve fibers innervated each Mc from the sub corial plexus of nerves and formed various patterns of nerve endings like networks, end bulbs and varicosities inside the Meissner&# 146;s corpuscle. Conclusion: Meissner&# 146;s corpuscle is a complex structure composed of capsule - consisting of spindle shaped capsular cells interspersed in collagen fibers, surrounding a core of helically arranged nerve fibers, Schwann cells and collagen fibers.

40|$|Small drug {{molecules}} {{are widely}} developed {{and used in}} the pharmaceutical industry. In the past few years, loading and delivering such molecules using polymer shell colloidosomes has attracted interest. Traditional polymer capsules fail to encapsulate low molecular weight materials for long times, since they are inherently porous and permeable for small molecules. In this paper, we report a method for encapsulating an anticancer drug with small molecule weight, for cell viability tests. The silver coated colloidosomes are prepared by making <b>an</b> aqueous <b>core</b> <b>capsule</b> with <b>a</b> polymer shell and then adding AgNO 3, surfactant and L-ascorbic acid to form a second shell. The capsules are impermeable and can be triggered using ultrasound. We propose to use the capsules as drug carriers. The silver demonstrates a low cytotoxicity for up to ten capsules/cell. After triggering the silver shells by ultrasound, the released doxorubicin, the broken silver fragments, and the doxorubicin loading on the capsule surface all kill cells. The results demonstrate a non-permeable silver shell microcapsule with ultrasound sensitivity for potential medical applications...|$|R
