5|$|As {{the major}} {{defining}} characteristic of the eukaryotic cell, the nucleus' evolutionary origin {{has been the subject}} of much speculation. Four major hypotheses have been proposed to explain the existence of the nucleus, <b>although</b> <b>none</b> have yet earned widespread support.|$|E

5|$|Rubidium is {{approximately}} as abundant as zinc and more abundant than copper. It occurs naturally in the minerals leucite, pollucite, carnallite, zinnwaldite, and lepidolite, <b>although</b> <b>none</b> of these contain only rubidium {{and no other}} alkali metals. Caesium is more abundant than some commonly known elements, such as antimony, cadmium, tin, and tungsten, but is much less abundant than rubidium.|$|E

5|$|The United States Air Force {{monitored}} airborne contamination through nasal swabs of onsite personnel. Of the 9,837 nasal swabs taken, 335 samples had detectable {{levels of}} alpha particle activity, <b>although</b> <b>none</b> was above acceptable levels. Urinalysis was also performed {{but none of}} the 756 samples displayed any detectable level of plutonium.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{arthropod}} parasites {{have been recorded}} on this duck, including chewing mites of the families Philopteridae and Menoponidae, feather mites and skin mites. Internal helminth parasites include roundworms, tapeworms and flukes. In a survey in Florida, all 30 ducks tested carried at least two helminth species, <b>although</b> <b>none</b> had blood parasites. Only one duck had no mites or lice.|$|E
5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>none</b> {{were ever}} built, several {{derivatives}} of Black Arrow were also proposed, as ways of increasing its payload capacity. One proposal added eight Raven solid rocket motors from the Skylark programme {{to the first}} stage as booster rockets. Another suggestion was to mount the entire rocket atop a Blue Streak missile, while a third proposal involved replacing the Gamma engines with the more powerful Larch.|$|E
50|$|A 13th century castle {{was built}} in Bechyně, <b>although</b> almost <b>none</b> of that {{original}} structure remains today. A reconstruction in the late 16th century and subsequent renovation in the 1670s resulted in the structure that stands there today.|$|R

5|$|Gene {{expression}} in prokaryotes {{is influenced by}} an RNA-based system similar in some respects to RNAi. Here, RNA-encoding genes control mRNA abundance or translation by producing a complementary RNA that anneals to an mRNA. However these regulatory RNAs are not {{generally considered to be}} analogous to miRNAs because the dicer enzyme is not involved. It has been suggested that CRISPR interference systems in prokaryotes are analogous to eukaryotic RNA interference systems, <b>although</b> <b>none</b> of the protein components are orthologous.|$|E
5|$|NASA had no {{official}} policy prohibiting women, but {{the requirement that}} astronauts had to be military test pilots effectively excluded them. NASA dropped this requirement in 1965, but did not select any women as astronauts until 1978, when six women were selected, <b>although</b> <b>none</b> as pilots. After Tereshkova, no women of any nationality would fly in space again until August 1982, when the Soviet Union launched pilot-cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya. During the late 1970s, Glenn reportedly supported Space Shuttle Mission Specialist Judith Resnik in her career.|$|E
5|$|Nintendo has {{released}} few technical details regarding the Wii system, but some key facts have leaked through the press. <b>Although</b> <b>none</b> of these reports has been officially confirmed, they generally {{indicate that the}} console is an extension (or advancement) of the Nintendo GameCube architecture. Specifically, the analyses report that the Wii is roughly 1.5 to 2times as powerful as its predecessor. Based on specifications, the Wii {{has been called the}} least powerful of the major home consoles of its generation.|$|E

5|$|Sampson won the {{election}} {{by a majority of}} over 32,000 votes, although every other Republican candidate lost by small margins. In the lieutenant governor's race, Democrat James Breathitt, Jr. defeated Sampson's running mate, E. E. Nelson, by 159 votes out of more than 700,000 cast. It was estimated that the Jockey Club spent half a million dollars to defeat Beckham and the large majority for Sampson versus the close defeat of all other Republican candidates suggested some type of fraud, <b>although</b> <b>none</b> was ever proven.|$|E
5|$|Senufo {{languages}} have {{a typical}} Niger–Congo noun class (or gender) system. Suffixes on nouns mark membership {{of one of}} the five noun genders. Pronouns, adjectives and copulas reflect the noun gender of the nominal they refer to. <b>Although</b> <b>none</b> of the sources on Nafaanra provides any details, it can be inferred from a brief word list given by Jordan that the Nafaanra noun class system resembles that of other Senufo languages.|$|E
5|$|Under {{fire and}} with the wind too calm for sailing, Barlow ran out oars to try and pull his brig away from the French batteries. The {{diminutive}} size of his vessel made it a difficult target and he was soon {{able to take advantage}} of a fresh breeze to withdraw from the crossfire. A single shot struck the brig, smashing into one of the 4-pounder cannon on deck and breaking it into three pieces, <b>although</b> <b>none</b> of the crew were wounded by the strike.|$|E

5|$|When diving, {{this bird}} pulls its {{head back and}} then arches it forward into the water, with the body {{following}} and a slight springing. The legs only start moving when they are underwater. When swimming {{on the surface of}} the water, the body of this grebe is relatively high, <b>although</b> <b>none</b> of the underparts are seen. The neck is held straight up in a relaxed manner, with the bill being held forward and parallel to the water. Each of the feet perform strong alternating strokes.|$|E
5|$|While the N-terminal nucleotide-binding {{pocket of}} Hsp90 is most widely studied and thus targeted, {{recent studies have}} {{suggested}} that a second ATP-binding site is located in the Hsp90 C-terminus. Targeting of this region has resulted in specific reduced Hsp90-hormone interactions and has been shown to influence Hsp90 nucleotide binding. <b>Although</b> <b>none</b> of the C-terminal Hsp90 inhibitors have yet to enter the clinic, the use of both N- and C-terminal Hsp90 inhibitors in combination represents an exciting new strategy for chemotherapy.|$|E
5|$|At the time, Queensland {{were the}} least {{successful}} team in the Sheffield Shield, and Harvey moved north to Brisbane the following season {{to try to get}} more opportunities to play Sheffield Shield cricket. Harvey joined the Toombul grade club, and made his first-class debut for Queensland against Victoria late in the season, <b>although</b> <b>none</b> of his brothers played for Victoria in this match; Merv had already retired, Neil was representing Australia, and Ray had been dropped. In his only match for the summer, he scored 1 and 13 and took two catches in each innings as an opener. He was dropped after the match.|$|E

50|$|The Toy is {{the only}} member of the Brotherhood of Dada left alive, unless you count Number <b>None,</b> <b>although</b> Number <b>None</b> can, by definition, be anyone or {{anything}} and is more of a concept than an actual person. She was late (as always) to the rally where her teammates were killed. Her origin and powers are unknown, but she has a distinctive look: the lower half of her face is locked behind something similar to Hannibal Lecter's mask, only combined with a Mister Potato Head. A set of plastic lips have been affixed to the mask, and a set of toothbrushes have been grafted on as ears. She wears a shirt that says Play with Me under a vest with pronounced shoulderpads.|$|R
5|$|Barbados sent a {{delegation}} {{to compete at}} the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China. The island nation made its tenth appearance as an independent nation upon its arrival in Beijing. Eight athletes across three sports and ten events represented Barbados, marking the smallest delegation in its history up to the Beijing Games. Its runners and swimmers advanced past the first rounds in their events in four of their nine events, <b>although</b> <b>none</b> advanced to their events' final rounds or medaled. The nation's flagbearer during the Beijing Games was swimmer Bradley Ally.|$|E
5|$|Calment {{was born}} in Arles, Bouches-du-Rhone, Southern France on 21 February 1875. Her father, Nicolas Calment (28 January 1838 – 22 January 1931), was a shipbuilder, and her mother, Marguerite Gilles (20 February 1838 – 18 September 1924), was {{from a family of}} millers. She had an older brother, François (25 April 1865 – 1 December 1962). Some of her close family members also lived an above-average lifespan, <b>although</b> <b>none</b> lived {{anywhere}} near as long as Jeanne: her older brother François lived to the age of 97, her father to six days shy of 93, and her mother to 86.|$|E
5|$|Gustav Theodore Holst (born Gustavus Theodore von Holst; 21 September 1874– 25 May 1934) was an English composer, {{arranger}} and teacher. Best {{known for}} his orchestral suite The Planets, he composed {{a large number of}} other works across a range of genres, <b>although</b> <b>none</b> achieved comparable success. His distinctive compositional style was the product of many influences, Richard Wagner and Richard Strauss being most crucial early in his development. The subsequent inspiration of the English folksong revival of the early 20th century, and the example of such rising modern composers as Maurice Ravel, led Holst to develop and refine an individual style.|$|E
