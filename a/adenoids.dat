5|$|For {{infants and}} young children, orotracheal {{intubation}} {{is easier than}} the nasotracheal route. Nasotracheal intubation carries a risk of dislodgement of <b>adenoids</b> and nasal bleeding. Despite the greater difficulty, nasotracheal intubation route is preferable to orotracheal intubation in children undergoing intensive care and requiring prolonged intubation because this route allows a more secure fixation of the tube. As with adults, {{there are a number}} of devices specially designed for assistance with difficult tracheal intubation in children. Confirmation of proper position of the tracheal tube is accomplished as with adult patients.|$|E
5|$|More serious {{complications}} include laryngospasm, perforation of the trachea or esophagus, pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents {{or other}} foreign bodies, fracture or dislocation of the cervical spine, temporomandibular joint or arytenoid cartilages, decreased oxygen content, elevated arterial carbon dioxide, and vocal cord weakness. In {{addition to these}} complications, tracheal intubation via the nasal route carries a risk of dislodgement of <b>adenoids</b> and potentially severe nasal bleeding. Newer technologies such as flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy have fared better in reducing the incidence {{of some of these}} complications, though the most frequent cause of intubation trauma remains a lack of skill {{on the part of the}} laryngoscopist.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Adenoid</b> basal {{carcinoma}} of the cervix is a rare condition mostly occurring among postmenopausal women. Although it can be confused with <b>adenoid</b> cystic {{carcinoma of}} the cervix, <b>adenoid</b> basal carcinoma has several clinicopathologic features that will allow distinction from <b>adenoid</b> cystic carcinoma. Case presentation This {{is the case of}} a twenty-year old African-American female who initially presented with a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion on Pap smear, with a subsequent cervical LEEP specimen revealing <b>adenoid</b> basal carcinoma. The lesion showed the characteristic histologic features of <b>adenoid</b> basal carcinoma and was positive for the immunohistochemical marker EMA and negative for collagen IV, further defining the tumor while helping to rule out the possibility of <b>adenoid</b> cystic carcinoma. As far as the authors are aware, this is the youngest reported case of <b>adenoid</b> basal carcinoma to date. Conclusion This case shows that <b>adenoid</b> basal carcinoma can deviate markedly from its typical postmenopausal demographics to affect women as young as 20 years of age. In addition, <b>adenoid</b> basal carcinoma has several identifiable features that will differentiate it from <b>adenoid</b> cystic carcinoma including histologic and cellular morphologies, as well as immunohistochemistry. Treatment for most patients involves hysterectomy, LEEP, or a conization procedure which provides a favorable prognosis because of this lesion's low potential for recurrence and metastasis. </p...|$|R

Flexible fiberoptic nasolaryngoscopey was the gold standard method for evaluation of <b>adenoid</b> and nasopharyngeal obstruction. The aim of this study was evaluation results and agreement of flexible flexible fiberoptic nasolaryngoscopey, <b>Adenoid</b> lateral x-ray and intraoperative observation diagnosis of <b>adenoid</b> hypertrophy and its intensity. In a cross-sectional and descriptive-analytical study, 50 pediatric patients who had suffered from nasal obstruction and mouth breathing were selected in this study to undergo adenoidectomy. The size of <b>adenoid</b> measured by flexible fiberoptic nasolaryngoscopey, lateral neck radiography and intraoperative observation of <b>adenoid</b> size. Results of three studied methods in diagnosis of <b>adenoid</b> hypertrophy and its severity were compared. Twenty two of patients were boy and 28 of them were girl.

25|$|Tonsillectomy is a {{surgical}} procedure {{in which each}} tonsil is removed from a recess {{in the side of}} the pharynx called the tonsillar fossa. The procedure is performed in response to repeated occurrence of acute tonsillitis, sleep surgery for obstructive sleep apnea, nasal airway obstruction, diphtheria carrier state, snoring, or peritonsillar abscess. For children, the <b>adenoids</b> (also known as a pharyngeal tonsil or nasopharyngeal tonsil) are usually removed, a procedure called adenoidectomy (or tonsilloadenoidectomy or adenotonsillectomy when combined). Adenoidectomy is uncommon in adults in whom the <b>adenoids</b> are usually vestigial.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Adenoid</b> cystic {{carcinoma}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} common types of salivary gland cancers. The poor long-term prognosis for patients with <b>adenoid</b> cystic carcinoma is mainly due to local recurrence and distant metastasis. Disintegrin and metalloprotease 10 (ADAM 10) is a transmembrane protein associated with metastasis in a number of diverse of cancers. The aim of this study was to analyze the relationship between ADAM 10 and the invasive and metastatic potentials as well as the proliferation capability of <b>adenoid</b> cystic carcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo. Methods Immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis were applied to detect ADAM 10 expression levels in metastatic cancer tissues, corresponding primary <b>adenoid</b> cystic carcinoma tissues, <b>adenoid</b> cystic carcinoma cell lines with high metastatic potential, and <b>adenoid</b> cystic carcinoma cell lines with low metastatic potential. RNA interference was used to knockdown ADAM 10 expression in <b>adenoid</b> cystic carcinoma cell lines with high metastatic potential. Furthermore, the invasive and metastatic potentials as well as the proliferation capability of the treated cells were observed in vitro and in vivo. Results It was observed that ADAM 10 was expressed at a significantly higher level in metastatic cancer tissues and in <b>adenoid</b> cystic carcinoma cell lines with high metastatic potential than in corresponding primary <b>adenoid</b> cystic carcinomas and <b>adenoid</b> cystic carcinoma cell lines with low metastatic potential. Additionally, silencing of ADAM 10 resulted in inhibition of cell growth and invasion in vitro as well as inhibition of cancer metastasis in an experimental murine model of lung metastases in vivo. Conclusions These studies suggested that ADAM 10 plays an important role in regulating proliferation and metastasis of <b>adenoid</b> cystic carcinoma cells. ADAM 10 is potentially an important therapeutic target for the prevention of tumor metastases in <b>adenoid</b> cystic carcinoma. </p...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: <b>Adenoid</b> cystic {{carcinoma}} is a salivary gland-derived malignant tumor, {{but rarely}} it can originate from the breast, too. The salivary gland-derived form shows {{a very aggressive}} clinical outcome, while <b>adenoid</b> cystic carcinoma of the breast has mostly a very good prognosis. Aim: The aim of the authors was to compare the miRNA-expression profile of breast- and salivary gland-derived cases. Method: The miRNA-profiles of two salivary gland derived and two breast-derived <b>adenoid</b> cystic carcinoma tissues {{as well as one}} normal breast and one salivary gland tissues were analysed using the Affymetrix(R) Gene Chip. Results: The expression of some miRNAs differed in the tumor tissues compared to their controls: the let- 7 b was overexpressed in salivary gland-derived <b>adenoid</b> cystic carcinoma, while decreased in breast-derived <b>adenoid</b> cystic carcinoma. In addition, the miR- 24 was decreased in salivary gland-derived but overexpressed in breast-derived <b>adenoid</b> cystic carcinomas. The miR- 181 a- 2 * was only detected in salivary gland-derived <b>adenoid</b> cystic carcinomas. Conclusions: Through post-transcriptional regulation of the genes, the diverse expression of some miRNAs may partially explain the diverse clinical outcome of salivary gland-derived and breast-derived <b>adenoid</b> cystic carcinomas.

40|$|<b>Adenoid</b> {{hypertrophy}} is {{a process}} in which <b>adenoid</b> size becomes enlarged and causes clinical symptoms, especially nasal obstruction. <b>Adenoid</b> hypertrophy can be due to physiological, inflammatory, or malignancy processes. <b>Adenoid</b> inflammatory process can be assessed using a flexible fiberoptic nasoendoscopy with narrow band imaging (NBI). Intranasal corticosteroid is one of the choices to treat <b>adenoid</b> hypertrophy in children; however, more experiments are needed to use it in adults. This study was performed in the period of November 2012 to January 2013 at the outpatient clinic of the Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Department of Dr. Hasan Sadikin General Hospital Bandung, using pre- and post-test open-labeled quasiexperimental design. Sample was selected through consecutive sampling, involving 11 subjects. Diagnosis was based on research subject’s anamnesis, ear nose and throat (ENT) physical examination, NBI-equipped fiberoptic nasoendocopy examination, and <b>adenoid</b> mucosal biopsy. Subjects were given intranasal corticosteroid therapy for four weeks. NBI-equipped fiberoptic nasoendocopy examination and biopsy examination were performed after therapy. Data were analyzed using Wilcoxon test, showing significant improvement of the <b>adenoid</b> inflammation after intranasal corticosteroids therapy (p< 0. 05).

Grading the <b>adenoid</b> by rigid nasal {{endoscope}} in patients with otitis media with effusion may justify adenoidectomy in otitis media with effusion in the future. METHODS: A prospective study was carried out at GMS Memorial Academy of ENT and head neck studies from 15 th December 2005 -April 2007. Study group comprised of 32 children with otitis media with effusion and control group of 28 children with clinically normal ear and nose. Rigid nasal endoscope was used for grading of <b>adenoid</b> in study and control group. The severity of otitis media with effusion was assessed by preoperative air-bone gap and thickness of the fluid aspirated from middle ear during ventilation tube insertion. RESULTS: In the study group 13 out of 32 had grade 4 <b>adenoid</b> hypertrophy. This grade 4 <b>adenoid</b> hypertrophy was found to be statistically significant in children with otitis media with effusion (P < 0. 0002).
