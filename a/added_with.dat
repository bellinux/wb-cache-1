5|$|Analog {{computers}} {{work directly}} with physical quantities, so their addition mechanisms {{depend on the}} form of the addends. A mechanical adder might represent two addends as the positions of sliding blocks, in which case they can be <b>added</b> <b>with</b> an averaging lever. If the addends are the rotation speeds of two shafts, they can be <b>added</b> <b>with</b> a differential. A hydraulic adder can add the pressures in two chambers by exploiting Newton's second law to balance forces on an assembly of pistons. The most common situation for a general-purpose analog computer is to add two voltages (referenced to ground); this can be accomplished roughly with a resistor network, but a better design exploits an operational amplifier.|$|E
5|$|Debian offers CD images {{specifically}} {{built for}} GNOME (the default desktop), KDE Software Compilation, Xfce and LXDE. MATE is officially supported, while Cinnamon support was <b>added</b> <b>with</b> Debian 8.0 Jessie. Less common window managers such as Enlightenment, Openbox, Fluxbox, IceWM, Window Maker {{and others are}} available.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, several 14-pounder and 9-pounder {{anti-aircraft}} guns were <b>added,</b> <b>with</b> the older 9-pounder guns being removed to keep displacement down. In 1930, she was modified {{to carry a}} reconnaissance seaplane.|$|E
50|$|This same {{reorganization}} can {{be applied}} to the sum-addressed decoder. Each bit in the non-predecoded formulation above can be viewed as a local two-bit <b>add.</b> <b>With</b> predecoding, each predecode group is a local three, four, or even five-bit <b>add,</b> <b>with</b> the predecode groups overlapping by one bit.|$|R

5|$|The gardens {{were well}} {{established}} by 1633, and by 1667 several walled gardens and courts had been <b>added</b> <b>with</b> established orchards. They {{were accompanied by}} stone gate lodges, which were removed in the 18th century.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} coaster's major refurbishment, a new, {{original}} storyline was <b>added</b> <b>with</b> {{a completely}} redesigned queue experience that places guests inside a perilous scientific experiment led by General Thaddeus Ross. The entrance features a statue of Hulk holding one of the ride's vehicles over his head, and arching tracks passing over him. These arching coaster tracks came from the original Hulk Roller Coaster. The televisions now show CGI animations of test subjects being exposed to gamma radiation and being transformed into Hulk-like creatures. As of April 2015, riders must pass through metal detectors and security personnel and must rid themselves of all loose items from their pockets.|$|E
5|$|Between 1990 and 2011, when Apocalypse {{was known}} as Iron Wolf, there was no theme for the roller coaster. After its {{relocation}} to Six Flags America, to match the new name of the coaster, an {{end of the world}} apocalypse theme was <b>added</b> <b>with</b> fire, crashed planes and zombies located in the queue line and along the layout of the roller coaster. As guests go further in the queue line to the end at the station, it mimics an end of the world apocalypse scenario. The skull from Skull Mountain also serves as a backdrop to the ride.|$|E

5|$|Eddy changed {{printers}} for {{the second}} edition, which was also poorly proofread, and for the third edition in 1881 switched again, this time to John Wilson & Sons, University Press, Cambridge, MA. John Wilson and his successor, William Dana Orcutt, continued to print the book until after Eddy's death. To the 6th edition in 1883, Eddy <b>added</b> <b>with</b> a Key to the Scriptures (later retitled with Key to the Scriptures), a 20-page glossary containing her definitions of biblical terms. The book sold 15,000 copies between 1875 and 1885.|$|E
5|$|England resumed on {{the fourth}} morning with only three wickets in hand and still 159 runs in arrears. Johnston quickly removed the last three wickets to seal an Australian victory by an innings and 149 runs. Only ten runs were <b>added,</b> <b>with</b> Hollies being removed for a golden duck, skying a ball to Morris, {{immediately}} after Yardley was the ninth man to fall. Johnston ended with 4/40 from 27.3 overs while Lindwall took 3/50 from 25 overs. This result sealed the series 4–0 in favour of Australia. The match {{was followed by a}} series of congratulatory speeches.|$|E
5|$|In 1964 Chaplin {{established}} his official filmography {{with the publication}} of his book, My Autobiography. The filmography consisted of 80 motion pictures released since 1914. Further detail was added to it in David Robinson's 1985 biography, Chaplin: His Life and Art, which included Chaplin's last film, A Countess from Hong Kong (1967), as the 81st entry. In 2010 the 82nd film was <b>added</b> <b>with</b> the discovery of A Thief Catcher, an early Keystone film hitherto thought lost.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, {{data mining}} tools like a {{decision}} tree and neural net were <b>added</b> <b>with</b> version 5 {{as well as}} Linux support, which was later withdrawn in JMP 9. Later in 2005, JMP 6 was introduced. JMP began integrating with SAS in version 7.0 in 2007 and has strengthened this integration ever since. Users can write SAS code in JMP, connect to SAS servers, and retrieve and use data from SAS. Support for bubble plots was added in version 7. JMP 7 also improved data visualization and diagnostics.|$|E
5|$|In May 2012, a new {{designers}} {{edition of}} Ogre was funded on Kickstarter.com. The original goal was $20,000 {{and the final}} funding was a total of $923,680. As the funding grew, more and more options and upgrades were <b>added,</b> <b>with</b> the final game weighing over 25 pounds (11kg). It began shipping to its Kickstarter supporters in October 2013, {{and is expected to}} arrive at retail stores on December 6, 2013.|$|E
5|$|In {{approximately}} 1200 a north aisle was <b>added,</b> <b>with</b> its width being {{determined by}} the projection of the north transept chapel, with the west and east walls taken down at the time. The different thickness of the walls in the present church suggests that the wall {{for the length of}} the first three bays of the arcade was taken down and rebuilt in the 13th century. The church underwent a restoration in 1839, with £370 being spent, and in 1875 at a cost of £2,377.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, {{the other}} claimants to the Duchy {{began to see}} that Sforza would be a greater threat than the Ambrosian Republic. Louis of Savoy invaded in spring of 1449, and Sforza sent Colleoni (who had earlier defected) to defeat him at Borgomanero, leading to an uneasy peace. Sforza also faced treachery within his own ranks, <b>added</b> <b>with</b> the fact that he rashly {{accepted}} the defection of his great enemies the Piccinino brothers, who, upon gaining access to Monza, promptly returned it to Milan.|$|E
5|$|On December 11, 2014, {{in honor}} of the Angry Birds' 5th birthday, an episode with 30 user-{{inspired}} levels was added. On June 23, 2015, Flock Favorites was <b>added</b> <b>with</b> 15 levels inspired by previous episodes. On December 11, 2015, {{in honor of}} Angry Birds 6th birthday, new 15 levels were added to Birdday Party. On December 10, 2016, in honor of Angry Birds' seventh birthday 15 more levels were added to Birdday Party.|$|E
5|$|Tactical Realism: a {{variation}} of the standard competitive multiplayer modes, <b>added</b> <b>with</b> the release of the Operation Skull Rain DLC. The game mode features a heavier emphasis on realism and teamwork, removing most of the heads-up display (HUD) elements, the ability to mark opponents, and the ability to see teammates' contours through walls, while also featuring the addition of a realistic ammo management system.|$|E
50|$|In a {{standing}} wave the nodes are {{a series of}} locations at equally spaced intervals where the wave amplitude (motion) is zero (see animation above). At these points the two waves <b>add</b> <b>with</b> opposite phase and cancel each other out. They occur at intervals of half a wavelength (λ/2). Midway between each pair of nodes are locations where the amplitude is maximum. These are called the antinodes. At these points the two waves <b>add</b> <b>with</b> the same phase and reinforce each other.|$|R

5|$|The Spotted Saddle Horse {{developed}} from small gaited pinto ponies of Spanish ancestry. These were crossed with larger American breeds {{such as the}} Morgan and Standardbred, developed after the American Revolution, to increase size while retaining coloration and the desired gait. After the American Civil War, additional gaited blood was <b>added,</b> <b>with</b> contributing breeds including the Tennessee Walking Horse, Missouri Fox Trotter, Paso Fino and Peruvian Paso. Mustangs from the American West were also incorporated. Originally developed in central Tennessee, and selectively bred for pinto coloration, they were used for general pleasure and trail riding.|$|E
5|$|There {{were many}} more systems <b>added</b> <b>with</b> the time, like the Atlis II in the French {{aircraft}}, and, in 1994–95, some GR1s had laser-designator systems fitted. Missiles like AS-30 {{and even the}} anti-ship Sea Eagle were added. Some IAF aircraft had the Agave radar system, purpusely for maritime strike. India later developed the DARIN system in its Jaguar fleet, with a modern 1553 databus.|$|E
5|$|Although its {{equations}} {{of motion}} can be linearized, a bike is a nonlinear system. The variable(s) to be solved for cannot be written as a linear sum of independent components, i.e. its behavior is not expressible as a sum of the behaviors of its descriptors. Generally, nonlinear systems are difficult to solve and are much less understandable than linear systems. In the idealized case, in which friction and any flexing is ignored, a bike is a conservative system. Damping, however, can still be demonstrated: under the right circumstances, side-to-side oscillations will decrease with time. Energy <b>added</b> <b>with</b> a sideways jolt to a bike running straight and upright (demonstrating self-stability) is converted into increased forward speed, not lost, as the oscillations die out.|$|E
