5|$|Peel {{made two}} further {{first-class}} appearances in 1897 after his suspension by Yorkshire. He played in two end-of-season festival games at Hastings, {{first for the}} North against the South and then for the Players against the Gentlemen, but did little with bat or ball. In all first-class games that year he took 72 wickets at 19.51 and scored 566 runs at 22.64. His only other appearances in first-class cricket came in 1899, when he played for A. J. Webbe's XI against Oxford University <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> England XI against the touring Australians. He ended his first-class career with 12,191 first-class runs {{at an average of}} 19.44 and 1,775 wickets at 16.20.|$|E

Padilla received 57 shallow slashes from a dagger which did not put his life in danger, but he could have died from blood loss. Padilla blamed Flores for the stabbing <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> earlier attack {{in which he was}} allegedly beaten by men who warned him against criticizing the church leader. A church spokesman denied that the church or Flores had any involvement in the attack and suggested that Padilla may have orchestrated the attack {{in a desperate attempt to}} authenticate his previous charges against the church.|$|E

5|$|After {{maintaining}} {{peak strength}} for about 18hours, Kenneth began a sharp weakening trend due to unfavorable north-northeasterly wind shear; this {{was caused by}} the anticyclone over Hurricane Jova, which eroded the eyewall of Hurricane Kenneth. While weakening, the hurricane turned to a southwest drift, due to a weakness in steering currents. By September 20, its deepest convection was confined to the southern half of the hurricane, and later in the day Kenneth weakened to tropical storm status. Reduced moisture in the atmosphere weakened the system further, and by September 21 its circulation was exposed to the east-northeast of the convection. Kenneth began a steady west-northwest track due to a weak ridge to its north. Operationally the storm was predicted to continue weakening and dissipate within four days. However, deep convection re-developed near the center as the outflow became better defined, and Kenneth remained a moderate tropical storm for several days. On September 24, the motion became nearly stationary as steering currents again weakened. Vertical shear sharply declined, allowing the convection to become more symmetrical <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> eye feature to develop. On September 25, Kenneth again attained hurricane status while located about 1085miles (1745km) east-southeast of the Big Island of Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|In 1876, various {{independent}} delegates {{gathered in}} Indianapolis to nominate a presidential ticket to campaign on those issues. For president, they chose Peter Cooper, an 85-year-old industrialist and philanthropist from New York, with Samuel Fenton Cary, a former congressman from Ohio, {{as his running}} mate. The Greenback ticket fared poorly in the election that November, attracting just 81,740 votes—less than 1% of the total. As bad economic times continued, however, the party gained momentum. Labor unrest the following year, culminating in the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, added to many laborers' alienation from the two major parties. Local movements, like California's Workingmen's Party, began to agitate for laws to improve the condition of laborers (<b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> end to Chinese immigration). By 1878, the third-party movement had become strong enough to elect 22 independents to the federal House of Representatives, most tied {{in some way to}} the Greenback movement. As the 1880 presidential election approached, members of the Greenback Party (or Greenback-Labor Party, as it was sometimes known) had reason to believe that they could improve on the results of 1876.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the IMD {{expected}} Chapala would intensify {{further into}} a super cyclonic storm, and the JTWC anticipated it would strengthen to {{the equivalent of}} a Category5-equivalent on the Saffir-Simpson scale. However, the storm began an eyewall replacement cycle on 30October, causing the inner eyewall to degrade <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> outer eyewall to form; this resulted in a slight drop in intensity. In addition, drier air began affecting the storm, causing the thunderstorms around the eye to diminish. However, Chapala maintained much of its intensity due to strong outflow in all directions, especially to the northeast due to a tropical upper tropospheric trough over India, despite increased wind shear. On 31October, the outer eyewall became established, reaching a diameter of , although the thunderstorms around the eye continued to weaken. On 1November, Chapala passed just north of the island of Socotra, marking the area's first hurricane-force impact since 1922.|$|E

5|$|The Paul {{family moved}} to Lake Jackson, Texas, in 1968, where he was raised and where his father began a medical {{practice}} <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> extent of time was the only obstetrician in Brazoria County. When he was 13, his father {{was elected to the}} United States House of Representatives. That same year, Paul attended the 1976 Republican National Convention, where his father headed Ronald Reagan's Texas delegation. The younger Paul often spent summer vacations interning in his father's congressional office. In his teenage years, Paul studied the Austrian economists that his father respected, as well as the writings of Objectivist philosopher Ayn Rand. Paul went to Brazoswood High School and was on the swimming team and played defensive back on the football team. Paul attended Baylor University from fall 1981to summer 1984 and was enrolled in the honors program. During the time he spent at Baylor, he was involved in the swim team and the Young Conservatives of Texas and {{was a member of a}} secret organization known as The NoZe Brotherhood. Paul also regularly contributed to The Baylor Lariat student newspaper. Paul dropped out of Baylor without completing his Bachelor's degree in either biology or English, when he was accepted into his father's alma mater, the Duke University School of Medicine. At the time, Duke did not require an undergraduate degree for admission to its graduate school. He earned an M.D. degree in 1988 and completed his residency in 1993.|$|E
