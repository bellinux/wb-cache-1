5|$|When the 1990 Budget {{came before}} Congress {{in the summer}} of 1989, it settled on a figure between the Administration's request and the House <b>Armed</b> <b>Services</b> Committee's recommendation.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, a few on Capitol Hill were {{determined}} to overhaul United States Special Operations Forces. They included Senators Sam Nunn (D-GA) and William Cohen (R-ME), both members of the <b>Armed</b> <b>Services</b> Committee, and Representative Dan Daniel (D-VA), {{the chairman of the}} United States House <b>Armed</b> <b>Services</b> Subcommittee on Readiness. Congressman Daniel had become convinced that the U.S. military establishment was not interested in special operations, that the country's capability in this area was second rate, and that SOF operational command and control was an endemic problem. Senators Nunn and Cohen also felt strongly that the Department of Defense was not preparing adequately for future threats. Senator Cohen agreed that the U.S. needed a clearer organizational focus and chain of command for special operations to deal with low-intensity conflicts.|$|E
5|$|In {{line with}} the Warner brothers' early {{opposition}} to Nazism, Warner Bros. produced more pictures about the war than any other studio, covering every branch of the <b>armed</b> <b>services.</b> In addition, the studio produced patriotic musicals such as This is the Army and Yankee Doodle Dandy.|$|E

5|$|The armed forces' third arm, the Liberian National Coast Guard, was {{established}} in 1959. Throughout the Tubman period the coastguard {{was little more than}} a few sometimes unserviceable patrol craft manned by ill-trained personnel, though its training improved in the 1980s to the point where it was considered the best trained of the <b>armed</b> <b>services.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{immediate}} postwar {{fate of the}} Navy was the scrapping and mothballing {{of ships}} on a large scale; by 1948 only 267 ships were active in the Navy.

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the new Congress in 1977, Mathias was in line for several potential committee promotions to ranking member. However, Mathias' outspoken criticism of the party in the previous election cycle aroused enmity amongst his colleagues. On the Judiciary Committee, Mathias had the most seniority of any other member except Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, who already held another ranking membership on the <b>Armed</b> <b>Services</b> Committee. Only one ranking membership was allowed per senator, so Thurmond resigned his ranking membership on the <b>Armed</b> <b>Services</b> Committee to circumvent Mathias serving as ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. Mathias was also prevented from assuming leadership positions on the Government Operations Committee following a power struggle, and on the Judiciary Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights. On the latter subcommittee, Mathias had more seniority than any other member. However, party leaders were uneasy with the idea of allowing Mathias to team up with liberal Democrat and subcommittee chairman Birch Bayh, and voted instead for William L. Scott as ranking member.|$|E
5|$|Between December, 1941 and June, 1945 U.S. railroads carried almost 44 million <b>armed</b> <b>services</b> personnel. As {{there were}} not enough cars and coaches {{available}} to meet the massive need for troop transit created by World War II, in late 1943 the U.S. Office of Defense Transportation contracted with the Pullman Company to build 2,400 troop sleepers, and with American Car and Foundry (ACF) to build 440 troop kitchen cars.|$|E

5|$|Black Americans {{were not}} {{permitted}} to fly for the U.S. <b>armed</b> <b>services</b> prior to 1940. The Air Corps at that time, which {{had never had a}} single black member, was part of an army that possessed exactly two black Regular line officers at the beginning of World War II: Brigadier Generals Benjamin O. Davis, Sr. and Benjamin O. Davis, Jr. The first Civilian Pilot Training Program (CPTP) students completed their instruction in May 1940.|$|E
5|$|During 1947 Katsura {{caught the}} eye of American {{serviceman}} Vernon Greenleaf (no relation to the pool and carom billiards champion Ralph Greenleaf), a master sergeant in the U.S. Army's Quartermaster Corps {{who had been in the}} <b>armed</b> <b>services</b> for 22 years. Katsura and Greenleaf first met in a Tokyo service club where she was giving billiard exhibitions. Greenleaf began taking lessons from Katsura and was quickly smitten with her. They were married on November 30, 1950, but never had any children.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, Keating was {{stationed}} in the U.S., sometimes at Banana Creek in Florida, and flew Hellcats to <b>armed</b> <b>services</b> swimming meets. He narrowly escaped serious injury one night at Naval Air Station Vero Beach when he neglected to lower the landing gear on his Hellcat and wrecked the plane in an unexpected belly landing. Due to additional training on new intercept methods and the vagaries of squadron transfers, the war ended before he would be deployed to any combat theater.|$|E

5|$|During the 1948 Revolt of the Admirals, {{a number}} of naval {{officers}} publicly disagreed with the administration's policy over cuts to naval aviation and amphibious warfare capability, resulting in the relief of the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Louis Denfeld, and his replacement by Admiral Forrest Sherman. In testimony before the House <b>Armed</b> <b>Services</b> Committee investigation into the affair in October 1949, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Omar Bradley, doubted that there would ever be another large scale amphibious operation.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} decades of the 20th century, the Australian Government {{established}} the <b>armed</b> <b>services</b> as separate organisations. Each service had an independent chain of command. In 1976, the government made a strategic change and established the ADF to place the services under a single headquarters. Over time, the degree of integration has increased and tri-service headquarters, logistics and training institutions have supplanted many single-service establishments.|$|E
5|$|Flanders's {{voting record}} in the Senate was more {{conservative}} than his senior colleague, George Aiken, and reflected Flanders's business orientation.

5|$|In 1965, the {{independence}} of the New Zealand Army from the other <b>armed</b> <b>services</b> was ended, and the New Zealand Defence Force, combining the army, navy and airforce, was established. Thornton was the second Chief of Defence Staff, succeeding Vice Admiral Sir Peter Phipps, and went on to complete a six-year term in this capacity, after which he retired from the army in the rank of lieutenant general. He had been made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the 1967 Queen's Birthday Honours.|$|E
5|$|In {{accordance}} with the family's tradition, Scott {{and his younger brother}} Archie were predestined for careers in the <b>armed</b> <b>services.</b> Scott spent four years at a local day school before being sent to Stubbington House School in Hampshire, a cramming establishment that prepared candidates for the entrance examinations to the naval training ship HMS Britannia at Dartmouth. Having passed these exams Scott began his naval career in 1881, as a 13-year-old cadet.|$|E
