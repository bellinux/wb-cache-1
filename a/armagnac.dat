5|$|As {{early as}} the late 1380s and early 1390s, Isabeau {{demonstrated}} that she possessed diplomatic influence when the Florentine delegation requested her political intervention in the Gian Galeazzo Visconti affair. Orléans and the Duke of Burgundy were in the pro-Visconti faction while the anti-Visconti faction included Isabeau, her brother, Louis VII, Duke of Bavaria, and John III, Count of <b>Armagnac.</b> At that time Isabeau lacked the political power to effect change. Some years later, however, at the 1396 wedding of her seven-year-old daughter, Isabella, to Richard II of England (an event at which Charles attacked a herald for wearing Galeazzo's livery), Isabeau successfully negotiated an alliance between France and Florence with Florentine ambassador Buonaccorso Pitti.|$|E
5|$|In December 1415 Dauphin Louis died {{suddenly}} at age 18 of illness, leaving Isabeau's political status unclear. Her 17-year-old fourth-born son, John of Touraine, now the Dauphin, {{had been raised}} since childhood in the household of Duke William II of Bavaria in Hainaut. Married to Countess Jacqueline of Hainaut, Dauphin John was a Burgundian sympathizer. William of Bavaria refused {{to send him to}} Paris during a period of upheaval as Burgundians plundered the city and Parisians revolted against another wave of tax increases initiated by Count Bernard VII of Armagnac; in a period of lucidity, Charles had raised the Count to be the Constable of France. Isabeau attempted to intervene by arranging a meeting with Jacqueline in 1416, but <b>Armagnac</b> refused to allow Isabeau to reconcile with the House of Burgundy, while William II continued to prevent the young Dauphin from entering Paris.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Armagnacs</b> {{were under}} the control of the Dauphin Louis XI and entered Alsace in 1444, forcing cities and villages to {{surrender}} to their control.

5000|$|The story takes {{action at}} the time of the Hundred Year War in France during the rule of Charles VII. It is also the war between the <b>Armagnacs</b> and the Burgundians. There is the ambitious John the Fearless Duke of Burgundy against the {{supporters}} of the future King Charles VII the <b>Armagnacs,</b> an embittered compat without mercy. In these troublesome times during the Parisian riots in Paris 1413 Catherine Legoix, daughter of a goldsmith living on the Pont-au-Change with her family, tries in vain to save a young Knight, the sixteen year old Michel de Montsalvy (in the service of the <b>Armagnacs)</b> condemned to be hanged, for calling Duke John the Fearless a traitor and spitting into his face.|$|R
5|$|The Enterprise {{heads to}} Torona IV to open {{negotiations}} with the Jarada, an insect-like race that is unusually strict in matters of protocol. After practicing the complex greeting the Jarada require to open negotiations, Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) decides to relax with a Dixon Hill story in the holodeck. Playing Detective Hill in the holoprogram, Picard takes up the case of Jessica Bradley (Carolyn Allport), who believes Cyrus Redblock (Lawrence Tierney) is trying to kill her. Picard decides to continue the program later and leaves the holodeck to affirm their estimated arrival at Torona IV. He invites Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) and visiting historian Dr. Whalen (David Selburg) {{to join him in}} the holodeck. While Crusher is still preparing, Picard and Whalen are ready to enter the holodeck when Lt. Cdr. Data (Brent Spiner) arrives, having overheard Picard's invitation. Entering the holodeck, the three discover Jessica has been murdered in Picard's absence. As Picard explains that he saw Jessica at his office the day before, Lt. McNary (Gary <b>Armagnac)</b> brings Picard into the police station for questioning as a suspect in her murder. Meanwhile, the Enterprise is scanned from a distance by the Jaradan, causing a power surge in the holodeck external controls. Dr. Crusher later enters the holodeck, first experiencing a momentary glitch with the holodeck doors, and joins her friends at the police station.|$|E

In 1418, the future Charles VII passed through Azay-le-Rideau as he fled from Burgundian occupied Paris to the loyal <b>Armagnac</b> stronghold of Bourges. Angered by the insults of the Burgundian troops occupying the town, the dauphin ordered his own army to storm the castle. The 350 soldiers inside were all executed and the castle itself burnt to the ground. For centuries, this fate was commemorated in the town's name of Azay-le-Brûlé (literally Azay the Burnt), which remained in use until the 18th century.|$|E

Two days later Lord Clifden raced in a sweepstakes of £10 each with £100 added. He got off to a bad start, losing several lengths to the rest of the field as Volturno went into the lead. Lord Clifden closed up on the field as they turned into the straight. At the one-furlong pole Fordham asked him for an effort and stride by stride he caught Bohemia, who was then leading, and just overtook him at the line to win by a head. Queen Bertha finished third, three lengths behind the front two.|$|E

50|$|The {{assassination}} {{took place}} during the Hundred Years War. Two rival factions, the <b>Armagnacs</b> and the Burgundians, vied for power within the regency council headed by the queen Isabeau of Bavaria. The duke of Orléans and leader of the <b>Armagnacs,</b> Louis I of Orléans, is said to have gained an advantage by becoming the queen's lover, with the subsequent allegation that Charles VII was the duke of Orléans' illegitimate son. John the Fearless, sensing that he was losing power, had Louis of Orléans assassinated in Paris in 1407. This event led to a civil war between the <b>Armagnacs</b> and the Burgundians. When the English invaded Normandy, John the Fearless maneuvered to deal with them carefully, because the Low Countries, which belonged to him, were dependent on the supply of English wool for the production of draperies. Therefore, he only sent a few troops to fight them. He profited from the war by taking power in Paris, supported by the academics and artisans. However, since the English crushed the French knights at Agincourt in 1415, putting an end to the civil war was urgent.|$|R
