40|$|The {{influence}} of applied axial loads on the fundamental vibration frequency is strictly {{connected with the}} stability analysis of elastic slender beams. For this reason, the correct evaluation of the fundamental frequency is of primary importance in designing new structures and components, {{as well as in}} monitoring existing ones. At the same time, if an internal axial load arises in a slender element as the consequence of an imposed (static) <b>axial</b> <b>end</b> displacement, then a different dynamic structural response is encountered respect to the case in which a beam end is free to slide, during transverse vibration, and a (constant) axial load is applied externally. This difference is due to the change in the axial boundary condition. Moreover, the presence of an initial curvature of the beam axis may significantly affect the aforesaid response. The experimental study proposed in the present paper investigates the dependence of the fundamental frequency on the axial load in slender beams subjected to imposed <b>axial</b> <b>end</b> displacements. The considered specimens presented different geometrical imperfections (initial curvatures), and were tested in two different constraint conditions (hinged-hinged and hinged-clamped). In addition, the behaviors observed during the experiments were reproduced by numerical simulations offering a valid confirmation for test results and contributing to understand the evolution of the fundamental frequency in the analyzed slender elements subjected to imposed <b>axial</b> <b>end</b> displacement...|$|R
40|$|COPI-coated vesicles form at the Golgi {{apparatus}} {{from two}} cytosolic components, ARF G protein and coatomer, a heptameric complex that can polymerize into a cage to deform the membrane into a bud. Although coatomer shares a common evolutionary origin with COPII and clathrin vesicle coat proteins, the architectural relationship {{among the three}} cages is unclear. Strikingly, the αβ'-COP core of coatomer crystallizes as a triskelion in which three copies of a β'-COP β-propeller domain converge through their <b>axial</b> <b>ends.</b> We infer that the trimer constitutes the vertex of the COPI cage. Our model proposes that the COPI cage is intermediate in design between COPII and clathrin: COPI shares with clathrin an arrangement of three curved α-solenoid legs radiating from a common center, and COPI shares with COPII highly similar vertex interactions involving the <b>axial</b> <b>ends</b> of β-propeller domains. close 696...|$|R

This The {{multi-mode}} fiber {{has been}} widely used in high data traffic applications since the transmitting rate of interface between data storages was larger than the capacity of fiber-optic communication with single mode fiber. The quality of <b>end</b> <b>surface</b> of fiber dominates the data transmitting efficiency. A good cutting <b>end</b> <b>surface</b> of single mode fiber can obtain by the traditional mechanical fiber cleaving methods. But, the multi-mode fiber has much larger core diameter than single mode fiber’s {{and the quality of}} cutting <b>end</b> <b>surfaces</b> which cut by the traditional mechanical fiber cleaving methods was not good enough. In the recent year, the pulse CO 2 laser processing methods were introduced to cleave the fibers. In this research, a glass fiber laser cutting system was developed.

(a) For a cylinder with flat <b>end</b> <b>surfaces,</b> ΔTmin has an average value of 136 K for saturated water, irrespective of the aspect ratio, L/D, where L is the length and D the diameter of the test cylinder.

30|$|The MC of {{the boards}} was not {{measured}} using the moisture meters, setting the density values that were obtained gravimetrically for each board {{from the end}} section of 4  mm in thickness. So {{the performance of the}} moisture meters calibrated by NIR-predicted density could not compared with the one calibrated by the individual measured density. Nonetheless, this study demonstrates that NIR spectroscopy could swiftly predict oven-dry density of the <b>end</b> <b>surface</b> of the Sugi boards. This finding shows that NIR spectra acquired from an <b>end</b> <b>surface</b> of lumber may be useful for density calibration of moisture meter. In this study, the board length was 250  mm, and NIR-predicted density could be considered to represent the density of whole-board. Thus, density calibration using NIR spectroscopy was successful. It should be pointed out, however, that an accuracy of density calibration with NIR spectra acquired from an <b>end</b> <b>surface</b> may decrease with increasing lumber length, due to density variation along the longitudinal direction. For improving density calibration, {{it may be necessary to}} collect NIR spectra from both ends of lumber and average them. There are also a few limitations that should be considered with regard to potential future applications. In a real situation, knots often appear on an <b>end</b> <b>surface</b> of lumber, and NIR spectrum acquired from such a surface probably leads to an error in density calibration. In addressing this issue, hyperspectral NIR imaging [43] or scanning NIR probe [44] can be utilized to map the spatial distribution of NIR spectra on surfaces. Besides, NIR spectroscopy has been shown to be able to identify the presence of knots [45]. By combining these techniques, it may be possible to distinguish a knot region from a clear region in the <b>end</b> <b>surface</b> of lumber and to predict the density of lumber with NIR spectra obtained solely from the clear region. If the above issues are to be resolved, the density calibration system based on NIR technology will be applicable to commercial lumbers.|$|R
