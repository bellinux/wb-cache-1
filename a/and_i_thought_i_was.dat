2500|$|Carey {{attributed}} his subdued {{reaction to}} the perfect bid by saying, [...] "Everybody thought someone had cheated. We'd just fired Roger Dobkowitz, and all the fan groups were upset about it. ... I remember asking, 'Are we ever going to air this?' And nobody could see how we could. So I thought the show {{was never going to}} air. I thought somebody had cheated us, and I thought the whole show was over. I {{thought they were going to}} shut us down, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to be out of a job." [...] Kniess later defended his actions, claiming that he never cheated, and in the end, was awarded his prizes. (His feat can be comparable to the actions of Michael Larson, who appeared on the CBS 1980s game show Press Your Luck, and won $110,237 by memorizing the board sequence.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Shelby Metcalf {{took over}} the A {{basketball}} program in 1963. [...] His impact was immediate, winning the Southwest Conference with a 13-1 conference record for Texas A's first title in 13 years. [...] In his 26 years as head coach at Texas A, he won six Southwest Conference titles, two Southwest Conference tournament titles, and led A to six NCAA Tournament and four NIT appearances. [...] He was fired by former A football player and then-athletic director John David Crow after coaching 19 games of the 1989-1990 season. When asked by the media what happened between the two, Metcalf remarked, [...] "I made a comment that I didn't think John David was all that bright. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> being generous." [...] Metcalf finished his career at A with an overall record of 438306, making him the all-time winningest men's basketball coach in Southwest Conference history.|$|E
2500|$|Merkerson {{made her}} {{television}} debut as Reba the Mail Lady on Pee-wee's Playhouse. [...] "It {{was one of}} those wild things where I went to audition. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> funny and the person I auditioned for didn't, and so I had blown the job and I guess weeks later they got new casting people," [...] Merkerson said on the NPR program Tell Me More. [...] "I didn't know who Pee-wee Herman was, so if, you know, for fans of the show, if they watch like the first episode that I ever did, I think it was a big party and he just kept making me laugh because I had never seen the character before. And the director was angry and he was like how can we get through this scene? And I said I {{have to look at the}} plate. So the entire [...] he's serving hors d'oeuvres, I'm looking at the plate, and we're still good buddies. He still, to this day, knows how to make me laugh like no one else, Paul Reubens". Merkerson has also appeared on The Cosby Show, among other series.|$|E

"Fortunately {{the house}} was dark, and I don't believe there was anybody there who knew me. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{becoming}} sensible and self-controlled and womanly!

6000|$|... "I tried. I {{made the}} woman let me in, and I sat where poor Camilla {{used to talk}} to me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> the better for facing it out. The {{question}} is whether Mrs. Poynsett will dislike it. She {{has a right to}} be consulted." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm dreadful sorry," [...] said Mrs. Spencer. [...] "It's too bad; but it {{certainly}} wasn't my fault, you see, Miss Cuthbert. I did the best I could <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> following your instructions. Nancy is a terrible flighty thing.

6000|$|Lawrence {{gave her}} a good-humored smile {{and then turned to}} Foster. [...] "Lucy's cleverer than I, but I really thought she was rather hard on Walters." [...] He paused for a moment, and then resumed thoughtfully: [...] "You must {{remember}} that my object was to keep out of Daly's way, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> safe as long as I could do so. One would have expected him to play a lone hand." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She thought I {{was trying}} to butt in! Stung again! Like a small boy in love with teacher. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> so wise! Cussed out Mac--blamed Mac--no, damn all the fine words--cussed out Mac for being the village rumhound. Boozing is twice as {{sensible}} as me. See a girl, nice dress--start for Seattle! Two thousand miles away! Of course she bawled me out. She was dead right. Boob! Yahoo! Goat!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... [9] This is in exact {{agreement}} with the author's experience, which he had published twenty-two years before, under the title of Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners,--'I was more loathsome in my own eyes than was a toad, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> so in God's eyes too. Sin and corruption, I said, would as naturally bubble out of my heart as water would out of a fountain. I thought that none but the devil himself could equal me for inward wickedness and pollution of mind.' A sure sign that God, as his heavenly Father, was enlightening his memory by the Holy Spirit.--Ed.|$|E

6000|$|Mr. Camperdown's voice, {{as he put}} to {{her this}} vital question, was severe, and almost {{justified}} the little burst of sobs which came forth {{as a prelude to}} Lizzie's answer. [...] "I did not know what I was doing. I don't know what you expect from me. You had been persecuting me ever since Sir Florian's death about the diamonds, and I didn't know what I was to do. They were my own, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not obliged to tell everybody where I kept them. There are things which nobody tells. If I were to ask you all your secrets, would you tell them? When Sir Walter Scott was asked whether he wrote the novels, he didn't tell." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My son," [...] said Bridgenorth calmly, [...] "in {{the days}} of my non-age, I thought as you do.

Praised be Heaven, the scales are fallen from mine eyes; and after forty years' wandering in the desert of Sinai, I am at length arrived in the Land of Promise--My corrupt human nature has left me--I have cast my slough, and can now with some conscience put my hand to the plough, certain that there is no weakness left in me where-through I may look back.

60|$|By and by {{he rolled}} out and jumped {{up on his}} feet looking wild, and he see me and went for me. He chased me round and round the place with a clasp-knife, calling me the Angel of Death, and saying he would kill me, and then I couldn't come for him no more. I begged, and told him I was only Huck; but he laughed SUCH a screechy laugh, and roared and cussed, and kept on chasing me up. Once when I turned short and dodged under his arm he made a grab and got me by the jacket between my shoulders, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> gone; but I slid out of the jacket quick as lightning, and saved myself. Pretty soon he was all tired out, and dropped down with {{his back against the}} door, and said he would rest a minute and then kill me. He put his knife under him, and said he would sleep and get strong, and then he would see who was who.|$|E
60|$|Jackson. Beg pardon, sir; {{but they}} seemed to avoid seeing your father until they had seen you. It looked mysterious, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> would tell you first.|$|R

[...] "For {{a season}} I might attract as an eccentricity, but your swells would never stand me for longer--no more would any respectable folk, anywhere: we don't get on together.

I do know my work, nobody can deny that of me. My father spent every penny he had, poor gentleman, in buying me an old-established practice: fine house, carriage and pair, white-haired butler--everything correct, except myself. It was of no use. I can hold myself in {{for a month or}} two; then I break out, the old original savage that I am under my frock coat. I feel I must run amuck, stabbing, hacking at the prim, smiling Lies mincing round about me. I can fool a silly woman for half-a-dozen visits; bow and rub my hands, purr round her sympathetically.

When I came to, it was morning, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> dead, for all I could see was that great field of white mounds, like graves, and a splendid sky above. Then I looked for Joe, remembering; but he had put my coat back over me, and lay stiff and still under the snow that covered him like a shroud, all except his face. A bit of my cape had blown over it, and when I took it off and the sun shone on his dead face, I declare to you it {{was so full of}} heavenly peace I felt as if that common man had been glorified by God's light, and rewarded by God's 'Well done.'
