50|$|The <b>Alagoas</b> <b>foliage-gleaner</b> (Philydor novaesi) is a {{passerine}} bird {{which is}} endemic to Brazil.|$|E
50|$|The {{species was}} {{described}} from a specimen that formerly {{had been identified}} as an <b>Alagoas</b> <b>foliage-gleaner.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>Alagoas</b> <b>foliage-gleaner</b> is 18 cm {{long and}} weighs 30-38 g with plain rufous-brown plumage. Sexes are similar. It inhabits {{interior}} upland forest at 400-550 m, {{and has been}} found singly, in pairs or small groups, and often join mixed-species flocks including lesser woodcreeper.|$|E
50|$|There is high {{diversity}} of animal species.The ESEC has 13 species of endangered birds, {{two of which}} are endemic, the <b>Alagoas</b> <b>foliage-gleaner</b> (Philydor novaesi) and the Alagoas antwren (Myrmotherula snowi).Other species are orange-bellied antwren (Terenura sicki), Alagoas tyrannulet (Phylloscartes ceciliae) and the snake Bothrops muriciensis.|$|E
50|$|The black-capped foliage-gleaner (Philydor atricapillus) is {{a species}} of bird in the {{ovenbird}} family Furnariidae. The species is very {{closely related to the}} <b>Alagoas</b> <b>foliage-gleaner</b> and forms a superspecies with it.It is found in eastern Brazil, eastern Paraguay and far northeastern Argentina. They inhabit lowland rainforest and secondary forest from sea-level to 1050 m, and is not migratory.|$|E
40|$|The Atlantic Forest of {{northeast}} Brazil hosts a unique biota which {{is among the}} most threatened in the Neotropics. Near-total conversion of forest habitat to sugar cane monocultures has left the region's endemic forest-dependent avifauna marooned in a few highly-fragmented and degraded forest remnants. Here we summarise the current status of 16 globally threatened species based on surveys conducted over the last 11 years. We found a bleak situation for most of these species and consider that three endemics: Glaucidium mooreorum (Pernambuco Pygmy-owl), Cichlocolaptes mazarbarnetti (Cryptic Treehunter) and Philydor novaesi (<b>Alagoas</b> <b>Foliage-gleaner)</b> are most likely globally extinct. Some positive news can, however, be reported for both Leptodon forbesi (White-collared Kite) and Synallaxis infuscata (Pinto's Spinetail) which may warrant re-evaluation of their respective red list statuses. We outline a road map to prioritise conservation interventions in the region directed at preventing the extinction of this suite of threatened bird species and their companion biota...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The forests {{north of}} the São Francisco River, in northeastern Brazil, conform a centre of {{endemism}} for plants and animals. Currently only 5 % of its original forest cover is left, following 500 years of human colonisation. Avian endemism is high, and during the 1980 s four birds were described from these forests, <b>Alagoas</b> <b>Foliage-gleaner</b> Philydor novaesi, Orange-bellied Antwren Terenura sicki, Alagoas Antwren Myrmotherula snowi and Alagoas Tyrannulet Phylloscartes ceciliae. Their type locality, Murici Ecological Station, in the coastal mountains of Alagoas state, was the only site where the four species were known to occur together, and {{became the focus of}} much attention from conservation organisations. We here report on recent surveys at Reserva Privada do Patrimônio Natural Frei Caneca, in the mountains of Pernambuco state, which found these 4 species and 27 other threatened and endemic birds, and a yet undescribed taxon. We propose that more thorough surveys are needed in the reserve and its vicinity, to locate fragments of suitable forest for these species. These should be regarded within a management plan for the reserve (including research and monitoring), and such work should be expanded to a regional level. An educational programme focusing on the values of these forests and the negative impacts of human activities is needed very much...|$|E
