500|$|The arrest {{occurred}} {{about two}} weeks before the release of Grant's first major studio film, Nine Months, which he was scheduled to promote on several American television shows. The Tonight Show with Jay Leno had him booked for the same week. In the much-watched interview, Grant was noted for not making excuses for the incident after Leno asked him, [...] "What the hell were you thinking?" [...] Grant answered, [...] "I think you know in life what's {{a good thing to do}} and what's a bad thing, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> bad thing. And there you have it." ...|$|E
500|$|Arad later explained, [...] "We {{were working}} on what we called Spider-Man 4 {{and it was the}} same team [...] The problem was we didn't have a story that was strong enough and {{warranted}} ... another movie. And Sam Raimi ... realized we [...] have a good reason to make another one. And between [...] and Tobey and obviously the studio, we all went into it not feeling good about the next story." [...] Tolmach said one reason to restart the series was that the producers felt the core Spider-Man story was that of a boy becoming a man. Screenwriter Steve Kloves did a polish of Sargent's script, saying he had originally declined the opportunity to do so but relented [...] "as a favor" [...] to the filmmakers. [...] "I also really wanted to write for Emma Stone, because I like to write for women and I particularly like Emma," [...] he explained. [...] "So ...I did basically character and dialogue, and that was enjoyable for me. So that was my hand in it. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> little plot work, {{but a lot of the}} plot was done." [...] He did [...] "a little bit" [...] of dialog for Peter Parker / Spider-Man. In April 2012, writer-director Paul Feig said that Webb [...] "invited me on set, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> little bit of writing for that movie, for one of the high school scenes".|$|E

When Moore stopped working on Chroma Key material, he had already recorded two songs. [...] "The big difference with the new [...] is that there are more real instruments," [...] Moore said. [...] "I've hooked up with a bunch of friends that made hand drums and didgeridoos. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> lot of recording with that.

5000|$|When {{asked about}} the title for the record, Lopez also {{said that she would}} wait [...] "until the last minute" [...] to decide. Finally, on April 29, 2014, Lopez {{revealed}} that she was considering two titles for the album, Same Girl and AKA. Speaking of the titles, she said [...] "I feel like I've been given so many monikers, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> lot of different things." [...] The artwork sees Lopez staring into the camera, dressed in a red leather skirt.|$|R
500|$|In December 2014 Stefani {{spoke of}} the song to Spins Brennan Carley, when she {{mentioned}} working with Furler on the record. In the interview, she stated: [...] "I’ve got a good start on the record. Sia <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> session with Pharrell and No Doubt. She's a genius and I love working with her. There's a song on the record called [...] "Start a War" [...] that she wrote that I'm very grateful for. I think the girls are gonna love that one." [...] Popjustice's Brad O'Mance wrote that the announcement Stefani was working with Sia was good news. However, the physical release of [...] "Baby Don't Lie" [...] and [...] "Start a War" [...] never occurred. Furthermore, Universal Music Group's official website had listed a digital release of [...] "Start a War" [...] to take place on November 9, 2015, and had assigned it a UPC code, as it had for the unreleased maxi single for [...] "Baby Don't Lie". In the week of its scheduled release, Stefani's single [...] "Used to Love You" [...] was distributed instead.|$|E
2500|$|After {{placing her}} career on hiatus, Lopez {{released}} her fourth studio album, Rebirth, in February 2005. According to Lopez, Rebirth [...] "came about because I was {{on such a}} roller-coaster ride, that was my career from my first album to my last album, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> bunch of movie projects in between. I finally took some time just for myself, and [...] I came back, {{this was the first}} project I did. I felt like it was a new beginning for me, like I was, in a way, reborn." [...] Tracy Hopkins of NBC's Today Music noted that after [...] "fawning" [...] over Affleck on This Is Me... Then", Lopez [...] "wisely keeps her love life out of the spotlight" [...] on Rebirth and only references her relationship with Anthony on a few tracks. The album produced the single [...] "Get Right", which peaked at number one in the United Kingdom. In May, she starred alongside Jane Fonda in the romantic comedy Monster-in-Law, for which she received a salary of $15million. The film's marketing played up Lopez's [...] "Gigli-and-tabloid tarnished image", and it became a box office success. In August, Lopez starred alongside Robert Redford and Morgan Freeman in An Unfinished Life, a drama film based on the novel of the same name.|$|E
2500|$|Chambers married jeweler Irving Williams in 1976 {{and took}} over his Brooklyn jewelry repair {{business}} upon his death in 1978. Donna Chambers Designs was established in 1981 to create and manufacture 14-karat gold and cultured pearl fine jewelry. [...] Later a line of porcelain cameos featuring African American women were added {{as well as a}} line of antique mother-of-pearl Chinese gambling chips further enhanced with pearls. The poker chips, which form the centerpieces of bracelets, earrings and pendants, date from the Ching Dynasty and typically bear family crests or initials {{on one side and a}} drawing engraved with some aspect of Chinese life on the other. Chambers came across the poker chips by accident. [...] "I'm known as the pearl lady....My work has always been of pearl, whether freshwater or cultured. I use a lot of mother of pearl, abalone, and mabes. I was in Tuscon ... <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> double take," [...] Chambers said, [...] "I saw these mother-of-pearl, beautiful carved pieces...I picked up a few and made two or three pins with them." [...] The positive reaction to the gambling chip jewelry was so strong that they have become her signature jewelry line. Both Lonnie Anderson and Cissy Houston have purchased pearls from Chambers’ line.|$|E

2500|$|On July 30, 2014, dissenters {{released}} a [...] "controversial, vulgar" [...] rant Driscoll had written under the pseudonym [...] "William Wallace II" [...] in 2000, dubbed the [...] "Pussified Nation" [...] rant. The rant contained [...] "blunt and emotional comments critical of feminism, homosexual behavior, and 'sensitive emasculated' men", {{and called for}} [...] "real men" [...] to rise up {{in the spirit of}} Scottish warrior William Wallace as depicted in the film Braveheart. Mars Hill Church had long since deleted their unmoderated [...] "Midrash" [...] discussion board where the forum postings occurred. Driscoll referenced the incident in his 2006 book Confessions of Reformission Rev, where he confirmed and expressed regret that, though he believed his intentions were [...] "good", he had personally written the rant. He wrote in 2006, [...] "I had a good mission, but some of my tactics were born out of anger and burnout, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> lot of harm and damage while attracting a lot of attention." [...] Driscoll responded to the release of the rant {{in a letter to his}} congregation, writing that [...] "the content of my postings to that discussion board does not reflect how I feel or how I would conduct myself today." [...] On September 8, 2014, blogger Libby Anne republished other examples of material written by [...] "William Wallace II" [...] in 2001, and remarked she had “rarely seen an evangelical man assert male superiority and prominence this directly.” ...|$|E

60|$|Rollo <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> {{great deal}} of rough romping. He chased me and I chased him. He nipped my legs, arms, and hands, often so hard that I yelled, while I rolled him and tumbled him and dragged him about, often so strenuously as to make him yelp. In {{the course of the}} play many {{variations}} arose. I would make believe to sit down and cry. All repentance and anxiety, he would wag his tail and lick my face, whereupon I would give him the laugh. He hated to be laughed at, and promptly he would spring for me with good-natured, menacing jaws, and the wild romp would go on. I had scored a point. Then he hit upon a trick. Pursuing him into the woodshed, I would find him in a far corner, pretending to sulk. Now, he dearly loved the play, and never got enough of it. But at first he fooled me. I thought I had somehow hurt his feelings and I came and knelt before him, petting him, and speaking lovingly. Promptly, in a wild outburst, he was up and away, tumbling me over on the floor as he dashed out in a mad skurry around the yard. He had scored a point.|$|E
6000|$|... "Those books {{mark the}} next {{change in my}} life--and the last, before I took the usher's place at the school. My term of {{imprisonment}} was not a long one. Perhaps my youth pleaded for me; perhaps the Bristol magistrates took into consideration the time I had passed in irons on board ship. Anyhow, I was just turned seventeen when I found myself out on the world again. I had no friends to receive me; I {{had no place to}} go to. A sailor's life, after what had happened, was a life I recoiled from in disgust. I stood in the crowd on the bridge at Bristol, wondering what I should do with my freedom now I had got it back. Whether I had altered in the prison, or whether I was feeling the change in character that comes with coming manhood, I don't know; but the old reckless enjoyment of the old vagabond life seemed quite worn out of my nature. An awful sense of loneliness kept me wandering about Bristol, in horror of the quiet country, till after nightfall. I looked at the lights kindling in the parlor windows, with a miserable envy of the happy people inside. A word of advice would have been worth something to me at that time. Well! I got it: a policeman advised me to move on. He was quite right; what else could I do? I looked up at the sky, and there was my old friend of many a night's watch at sea, the north star. 'All points of the compass are alike to me,' I thought to myself; 'I'll go your way.' Not even the star would keep me company that night. It got behind a cloud, and left me alone in the rain and darkness. I groped my way to a cart-shed, fell asleep, and dreamed of old times, when I served my gypsy master and lived with the dogs. God! what I would have given when I woke to have felt Tommy's little cold muzzle in my hand! Why am I dwelling on these things? Why don't I get on to the end? You shouldn't encourage me, sir, by listening, so patiently. After a week more of wandering, without hope to help me, or prospects to look to, I found myself in the streets of Shrewsbury, staring in at the windows of a book-seller's shop. An old man came to the shop door, looked about him, and saw me. 'Do you want a job?' he asked. 'And are you not above doing it cheap?' The prospect of having something to do, and some human creature to speak a word to, tempted me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> day's dirty work in the book-seller's warehouse for a shilling. More work followed at the same rate. In a week I was promoted to sweep out the shop and put up the shutters. In no very long time after, I was trusted to carry the books out; and when quarter-day came, and the shop-man left, I took his place. Wonderful luck! you will say; here I had found my way to a friend at last. I had found my way {{to one of the most}} merciless misers in England; and I had risen in the little world of Shrewsbury by the purely commercial process of underselling all my competitors. The job in the warehouse had been declined at the price by every idle man in the town, and I did it. The regular porter received his weekly pittance under weekly protest. I took two shillings less, and made no complaint. The shop-man gave warning on the ground that he was underfed as well as underpaid. I received half his salary, and lived contentedly on his reversionary scraps. Never were two men so well suited to each other as that book-seller and I. His one object in life was to find somebody who would work for him at starvation wages. My one object in life was to find somebody who would give me an asylum over my head. Without a single sympathy in common--without a vestige of feeling of any sort, hostile or friendly, growing up between us on either side--without wishing each other good-night when we parted on the house stairs, or good-morning when we met at the shop counter, we lived alone in that house, strangers from first to last, for two whole years. A dismal existence for a lad of my age, was it not? You are a clergyman and a scholar--surely you can guess what made the life endurable to me?" ...|$|E
