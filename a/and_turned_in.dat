5|$|The game {{begins in}} the Arizona Territory in 1876 with Jericho {{attempting}} to rob a Darkwatch train that is transporting the captured Lazarus Malkoth to the Darkwatch Citadel, a frequently mentioned and often visited location in the game. His actions inadvertently release Lazarus into the West. In a seeming bit of mercy, Lazarus bites Jericho and gives him {{the curse of the}} vampire, causing him to slowly turn into one. The game continues with the introduction of Darkwatch agent Cassidy Sharp as well as the appearance of Shadow, Jericho's undead horse whom he fed on <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>in</b> a frenzy after being bitten by Lazarus.|$|E

During his freshman year, he ran a forty during spring max testing. Vick threw five touchdown (TD) passes during spring scrimmages and added another in the Maroon-White game.

25|$|Williams almost {{ended his}} tenure with the Pops in 1984. Considered a {{customary}} practice of opinion, some players hissed while sight-reading a new Williams composition in rehearsal; Williams abruptly left the session <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>in</b> his resignation. He initially cited mounting conflicts with his film composing schedule, but later admitted a perceived {{lack of discipline}} in, and respect from, the Pops' ranks, culminating in this latest instance. After entreaties by the management and personal apologies from the musicians, Williams withdrew his resignation and continued as principal conductor for nine more years. In 1995, he was succeeded by Keith Lockhart, the former associate conductor of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra and Cincinnati Pops Orchestra.|$|E
25|$|At Stellenbosch Du Plessis was {{initially}} {{more interested in}} cricket than rugby; he had chosen to go there because of his desire {{to play in the}} university cricket team. In 1971 his prowess at cricket earned him selection to the South African Universities cricket side, and then to the Western Province team during that same year. Playing five first-class cricket matches as a right-arm medium pace bowler, he took 16 wickets at an average of 25.62 runs per wicket, <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>in</b> a best performance of 4 wickets for 71 runs. But when Barry Richards, opening batsman of the South African and of the Natal cricket sides, hit Du Plessis for two sixes in the final over before lunch during a Castle Cup match between Western Province and Natal, he decided that perhaps he should rather concentrate on rugby.|$|E
25|$|Ford's first feature-length {{production}} was Straight Shooting (August 1917), {{which is also}} his earliest complete surviving film as director, and {{one of only two}} survivors from his twenty-five film collaboration with Harry Carey. In making the film Ford and Carey ignored studio orders <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>in</b> five reels instead of two, and it was only through the intervention of Carl Laemmle that the film escaped being cut for its first release, although it was subsequently edited down to two reels for re-release in the late 1920s. Ford's last film of 1917, Bucking Broadway, was long thought to have been lost, but in 2002 the only known surviving print was discovered in the archives of the French National Center for Cinematography and it has since been restored and digitized.|$|E

25|$|The race {{restarted}} {{at the end}} of lap {{three with}} Rosenqvist being forced to defend first place from Lynn after losing fraction in his tyres from driving behind the safety car. Lynn steered to the outside of Rosenqvist going into Lisboa corner <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>in</b> to take over the lead. Félix da Costa overtook Auer for third on the run up to Mandarin Oriental bend, and Auer lost a further place to Marciello at Lisboa turn. Auer then crashed heavily into the barriers at San Francisco bend while defending from Derani, ending his race early. Shortly after Jones hit a bump going off the racing line at Fisherman's Bend and made contact with the wall. Yellow flags were waved in the area but were withdrawn after he was removed from the circuit. Up front Lynn continued to lead Rosenqvist while Félix da Costa was being hounded by Marciello for third. Similarly King was battling Sims for fifth with Coletti, Buller and Ocon running in close formation in a battle for sixth. Mason was handed a drive-through penalty after his team started his engine while stationary in the fast lane of the pit lane. Sims managed to get ahead of King for fifth and began closing up to Derani. Buller overtook Coletti while Sainz passed Korjus for eleventh. On the fifth lap and heading towards Lisboa corner, Marciello moved in front of Félix da Costa for third.|$|E
25|$|While {{both were}} important, Sasun Eff was {{absolutely}} essential. His refusal would damn the Cabinet as a Talib ministry and doom it to failure from the outset. I left my {{cup of tea}} undrunk and rushed {{back to the office}} to tell Mr Philby. He wasn't there, but there was a light in Sir Percy's room. I went in and told him. He bade me go at once to Sasun Eff and charged me to make him change his mind. I set off feeling as if I carried the future of the 'Iraq in my hands, but when I got to Sasun's house to my immense relief I found Mr Philby and Capt Clayton already there. The Naqib had got Sasun's letter and had sent Mr Philby off post haste. I arrived, however, in the nick of time. They had exhausted all their arguments and Sasun still adhered to his decision. I think my immense anxiety must have inspired me for after an hour of concentrated argument he was visibly shaken, {{in spite of the fact}} that his brother Sha'al (whom I also admire and respect) came in and did his best against us. Finally however we persuaded him that Sir Percy had no desire to thrust Talib or anyone else upon Mesopotamia, but that Talib like everyone else must be given his chance. If he proved valuable he would take his part in the foundation of national institutions, if not he was politically a dead man. We got Sasun Eff to consent to think it over and to come and see Sir Percy next day. I had an inner conviction that the game was won—partly, thank heaven, to the relations of trust and confidence which I personally had already established with Sasun—but we none of us could feel sure. You will readily understand that I didn't sleep much that night. I turned <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>in</b> my mind the arguments I had used and wondered if I could not have done better.|$|E

500|$|Johnson's last certain {{victories}} of {{the year}} were achieved on 21 September 1941. Escorting Bristol Blenheims to Gosnay, the top cover wings failed to rendezvous with the bombers. Near Le Touquet at 15:15 and around 20,000 feet, Johnson's section was bounced by 30 Bf 109s. Johnson broke <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>in</b> and behind a Bf 109F. Approaching from a quarter astern and slightly below, Johnson fired closing from 200 to 70 yards. Pilot Officer Smith of Johnson's section observed the pilot bail out. Pursued by several enemy aircraft, Johnson dived to ground level. About 10 miles off Le Touquet, other Bf 109s attacked. Allowing the Germans to close within range, Johnson turned into a steep left-hand turn. It took him onto {{the tail of a}} Bf 109. Johnson fired and broke away at 50 yards. The Bf 109 was hit, stalled and crashed into the sea. Johnson was pursued until 10 miles south of Dover. The two victories made Johnson's total to six destroyed, which now meant he was an official flying ace. In winter 1941, Johnson and 616 Squadron moved to training duties. The odd convoy patrol was flown but it was an idle period for the Squadron which had now concluded its [...] "Tangmere tour".|$|E

Big Boi was introduced to Yelawolf's music through his younger brother and invited him to record after seeing him perform. The track [...] "Follow Us" [...] features Vonnegutt, an act from Big Boi's Purple Ribbon label.

500|$|Fender {{was chosen}} in the MCC team to tour South Africa in 1922–23, but despite support from journalists, {{he was not}} chosen as captain. Frank Mann led the team; [...] his {{appointment}} was criticised in the press, which judged him to lack playing ability and suggested that the selectors favoured those associated with Lord's—Mann was Middlesex captain. Mann appointed Fender [...] his vice-captain on the journey to South Africa, but played every match on the tour to leave Fender with no opportunity to lead the side. England won the Test series 2–1, but Fender had some difficulties playing on the matting pitches used in South Africa, on which the ball bounced <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>in</b> a different fashion from the turf on which cricket was played in England. He began in good batting form, scoring 96 in the first match, and he passed fifty on two other occasions, including an uncharacteristically defensive innings of 60 in the third Test, but his batting faded as the tour progressed. He was generally successful as a bowler, but proved expensive in the Tests. However, his best bowling performance according to his teammates came in the second Test, when he took four for 29 on the first day; all the South Africans {{found it difficult to}} bat against him, and he later described it {{as one of the best}} bowling spells of his career. He played in all five Tests, scoring 128 runs at an average of 14.22 and taking 10 wickets at 41.80, while in all first-class games, he scored 459 runs at 22.95 and took 58 wickets at 19.58.|$|E
