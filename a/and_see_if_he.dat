5|$|Most of {{the boys}} at St. Mary's played {{baseball}} in organized leagues {{at different levels of}} proficiency. Ruth later estimated that he played 200 games a year as he steadily climbed the ladder of success. Although he played all positions {{at one time or another}} (including infield positions generally reserved for right-handers), he gained stardom as a pitcher. According to Brother Matthias, Ruth was standing to one side laughing at the bumbling pitching efforts of fellow students, and Matthias told him to go in <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> could do better. Ruth had become the best pitcher at St. Mary's, and when he was 18 in 1913, he was allowed to leave the premises to play weekend games on teams that were drawn from the community. He was mentioned in several newspaper articles, for both his pitching prowess and ability to hit long home runs.|$|E

500|$|The fugitives reached Catesby's {{family home}} of Ashby St Ledgers at about 6:00pm. [...] Not wanting to {{implicate}} his mother, Catesby {{sent a message}} to Robert, who had just recently arrived there, asking to meet just outside the town. [...] There he told him that Fawkes had been captured. [...] At Dunchurch they collected Everard Digby and his 'hunting party', which included Robert and Thomas's half-brother, John Wintour. [...] He had been invited to join them on 4 November. [...] The next day the group raided Warwick Castle for supplies, something that Robert strongly objected to as it would create [...] "a great uproar" [...] in the country, and later arrived at Huddington Court, where they met Thomas. [...] Early the next morning Huddington's occupants went to confession and took the Sacrament at Mass—in Fraser's opinion, a sign that none of them thought they had long to live. [...] They collected further arms and munitions from Hewell Grange, but trying to recruit more people to their cause they were met with disdain; while the conspirators considered themselves to stand for [...] "God and country", the men of Hewell Grange replied that they were for [...] "King James as well as God and Country". [...] Late that night, pulling a sodden cart full of weapons and armour behind them, they arrived at Holbeche House, near Kingswinford in Staffordshire. [...] Robert was asked if he would go <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> could elicit any help from his father-in-law, John Talbot at his mansion at 'Pepperhill'. [...] He refused, and Thomas went instead, with Stephen Littleton. [...] Talbot was, however, loyal to James, and sent them away, claiming that their visit was [...] "as much as his life was worth". [...] While returning to Holbeche, they received a message that Catesby, Rookwood, John Grant and another man were dead, and the rest apparently fled. [...] Tired and desperate, the plotters had attempted to dry their soaked gunpowder in front of the fire, only for a stray spark to ignite it. [...] While Littleton chose to leave, begging his companion to follow his example, Thomas continued on to Holbeche, where he found the remaining plotters alive, but injured.|$|E

[...] While Monster Slayer raised his leg, Gopher blew into her tunnel four times, and each time it became larger. [...] Then , Monster Slayer entered the tunnel and crawled to where [...] lay above the opening.

[...] , Monster Slayer crept back up the full length of the tunnel, to where Gopher had started it, and climbed out. [...] There, a little old man dressed in tight leggings and a thin shirt wearing a cap with a feather approached him. [...] This was , the Ground Squirrel. [...] "," [...] said Ground Squirrel. [...] "What brings you to this place?" [...] "I am looking at something," [...] said , Monster Slayer. [...] "I wonder what you are looking at," [...] said Ground Squirrel.

[...] "If he no longer breathes I will climb up on his horns and dance and sing. [...] If he is dead, I want some of his blood to decorate my face." [...] "Truly, little brother," [...] answered Monster Slayer, [...] "you shall have it." [...] Ground Squirrel went to , saw that he was dead, and put some of his blood on his face and danced and sang. The face of every ground squirrel bears red streaks to this day. [...] And so it is that there has always been good will between Earth Surface People and the ground squirrels. [...] Gopher came and removed some of 's skin and put it on his own back.
