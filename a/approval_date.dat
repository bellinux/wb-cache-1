25|$|As part of {{immigration}} reform under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA), {{as well as}} further reform enacted in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRAIRA), persons who are eligible and properly apply for permanent residence based on either a recent marriage to a U.S. citizen or as an investor are granted permanent residence only on a conditional basis, for two years. An exception to this rule {{is the case of}} a U.S. citizen legally sponsoring a spouse in which the marriage {{at the time of the}} adjustment of status (I-485) is more than two years old. In this case, the conditional status is waived and a 10-year Permanent Resident Card is issued upon USCIS approval of the case. A permanent resident under the conditional clause may receive an I-551 stamp as well as a Permanent Resident Card. The expiration date of the conditional period is two years from the <b>approval</b> <b>date.</b> The immigrant visa category is CR (conditional resident).|$|E
25|$|In East Germany, {{the head}} of the central {{pharmacy}} control commission, Friedrich Jung, suspected an antivitaminic effect of thalidomide as derivative of glutamic acid. Meanwhile, in West Germany, it took some time before the increase in dysmelia {{at the end of the}} 1950s was connected with thalidomide. In 1958 Karl Beck, a former pediatric doctor in Bayreuth wrote an article in a local newspaper claiming a relationship between nuclear weapons testing and cases of dysmelia in children. Based on this, FDP whip Erich Mende requested an official statement from the federal government. For statistical reasons, the main data series used to research dysmelia cases started by chance at the same time as the <b>approval</b> <b>date</b> for thalidomide. After the Nazi regime with its Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring used mandatory statistical monitoring to commit various crimes, western Germany had been very reluctant to monitor congenital disorders in a similarly strict way. The parliamentary report rejected any relation with radioactivity and the abnormal increase of dysmelia. Also the DFG research project installed after the Mende request was not helpful. The project was led by pathologist Franz Büchner who ran the project to propagate his teratological theory. Büchner saw lack of healthy nutrition and behavior of the mothers as being more important than genetic reasons. Furthermore, it took a while to install a Surgeon General in Germany; the Federal Ministry of Health (Germany) was not founded until 1962, some months after thalidomide was banned from the market. In Germany approximately 2,500 thalidomide babies were born.|$|E

5000|$|In September 2013, Minister Ruiz-Gallardón {{announced}} {{that the government was}} studying a reform of the 2010 abortion law approved by the previous Socialist government, which allowed free abortion up to 14 weeks, and up to 22 weeks in cases of foetal deformities. The bill, in the draft law published in December 2013, allowed abortion only in cases of rape and when there was a serious (but undefined) health risk to the mother. Public outrage was felt from most opposition parties, as well as from many feminist organizations, with the bill being criticised as 'too restrictive' and 'a return to the past'. As the bill received widespread criticism both from within and outside the PP itself, its final <b>approval</b> <b>date</b> was postponed several times. In September 2014, PM Mariano Rajoy {{announced that}} his government was scrapping the reform and would instead opt for minor changes to the current abortion law, mainly the requirement for 16 and 17-year-old women to obtain parental consent to have an abortion, and suggesting the 'lack of consensus' as the main reason behind the decision to scrap the bill. This resulted in Alberto Ruíz-Gallardón announcing his resignation from his ministerial position and from politics the same day, [...] "feeling unable to fulfill the assignment he was tasked", and amid voices pointing to him having been discredited by his own party.|$|E

The channels are: 5298.5, 5330.5, 5357.0, 5366.5, 5371.5, 5398.5, 5403.5 and 5407.0 kHz (these numbers represent the USB dial frequency - CW is 1.5 kHz higher). There is some flexibility as regards Digital modes with 2500 Hz out of the 3 kHz channel width being available, due to current experimentation with narrowband Data up to 300 Hz bandwidth. No split operation. Maximum Power is 100W PEP measured at the TX (not EIRP). The main goal of IARC - the Israel Amateur Radio Club - is to experiment for local short range emergency communication readiness and the long distance activity is a side product of this.

Name changes are classified into six categories: major and minor, structural and pure, diversified and focused, accompanied with a change in ticker symbol and without a change in ticker symbol, “Gold” name addition and deletion, and different reasons for name changes (e. g., merger and acquisition, change of structure, change of strategy, and better image). The thesis uses the standard event study methodology to perform abnormal return and trading volume analyses. In addition, regression analysis is employed to examine which type of a name change has the largest impact on cumulative abnormal returns. Sample stocks exhibit a significant positive abnormal return one-day prior to the approval day and one day after the adoption date. Around the <b>approval</b> <b>date</b> we observe significant abnormal returns for stocks with a structural name change. On the day after the adoption date we document abnormal returns for stocks with major, minor, structural, pure, focused, and ticker symbol name changes. If a merger or acquisition is the reason for a name change, companies tend to experience a significant positive abnormal return one-day before the <b>approval</b> <b>date</b> and on the adoption date. If a change of structure is the reason for a name change, companies exhibit a significant positive abnormal return on the <b>approval</b> <b>date</b> and a significant negative abnormal return on the adoption date. In case of a change of strategy as the reason for a name change, companies show a significant negative abnormal return around the <b>approval</b> <b>date</b> and a significant positive abnormal return around the adoption date...|$|E

40|$|Decisions {{to adopt}} medical devices at the {{hospital}} level have consequences for health technology assessment (HTA) on system level and are therefore important to decision makers. Our aim {{was to investigate the}} characteristics of organizations and individuals that are more inclined to adopt and utilize cardiovascular devices based on a comprehensive analysis of environmental, organizational, individual, and technological factors and to identify corresponding implications for HTA. Seven random intercept hurdle models were estimated using the data obtained from 1249 surveys completed by members of the European Society of Cardiology. The major findings were that better manufacturer support increased the adoption probability of ‘new’ devices (i. e. in terms of CE mark <b>approval</b> <b>dates),</b> and that budget pressure increased the adoption probability of ‘old’ devices. Based on our findings, we suggest investigating the role of manufacturer support in more detail to identify diffusion patterns relevant to HTA on system level, to verify whether it functions as a substitute for medical evidence of new devices, and to receive new insights about its relationship with clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. © 2017 The Authors.
