5|$|At a Nintendo {{press conference}} in Tokyo, Japan on October 5, 2005, the company {{announced}} several games {{that it would be}} releasing in 2006 in Japan. The list included Brain Age 2, with a release date set for December 29, 2005. Nintendo later announced that the game would be released in Europe on June 29, 2007 for â‚¬30, and in Australia on July 5, 2007 for A$49.95. The American version of Brain Age 2 was first revealed in May 2007. The game is targeted to casual gamers, similar to its predecessor; its basic concepts stay the same as in , along with the graphics, menu, and presentation. Brain Age 2 also uses the same Sudoku engine, an addition in the original Brain Age that has been applauded for being one of the best handheld Sudoku games available; Brain Age 2s rendition of Sudoku introduces 100 new puzzles. All of the minigames in the game <b>are</b> <b>new</b> <b>to</b> the series; however, some of them are derived from exercises in Brain Age. One of the challenges in the first game, Head Count, requires that the player count how many people are shown on the screen; after a few seconds, a house falls on top of them, and then several people leave and enter the house. Afterward, the player must write down how many people they think are still in the house. A variation of this game is available in Brain Age 2, called Memory Sprint, which asks the player to observe a specific sprinter in a race as they pass other sprinters and are passed themselves, and then determine which place they finished in after they cross the finish line. The game's voice recognition technology has improved since the last game. The only challenge that uses the feature, Rock, Paper, Scissors, requires that the player speak the correct answer into the microphone as soon as possible.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Falle began {{counselling}} {{women in}} prostitution at Streetlight Support Services. Once she received her diploma from George Brown College, she redeveloped the organization's Choices program, a four-week program that helps women leave prostitution. Between 1997 and 2005, Choices helped 325 {{women out of}} the sex trade. Women entered into the program through {{the criminal justice system}} after being arrested for offences related to prostitution. By 2011, Falle had conselled more than 800 women. Of these women, 97% wrote on their intake surveys that they wanted to exit the sex industry, and 95% wrote that they had been physically abused by either a pimp, a client, or another woman in the sex industry. Falle believed these statistics to be representative of women in prostitution in Canada because the women she counselled did not come to her by choice; they were required to undergo the counselling by court order. In 2010, Falle said that hundreds of the women she had met were controlled by pimps, either as sexual partners or as traffickers. She also said that women in prostitution tend to be moved around a lot because they tend to fetch higher prices when they <b>are</b> <b>new</b> <b>to</b> a region. One of the women she counselled through Streetlight Support Services had been kept in a closet when she was not providing sexual services to men.|$|E
5|$|Some time later, the Eds {{wake up in}} {{a trailer}} home, where three girls are staring down at them. The boys have already been changed out of their dirty clothes and put into clean robes, which the girls inform them each belong {{to one of their}} three {{respective}} dads. Explaining that they <b>are</b> <b>new</b> <b>to</b> the area, the girls introduce themselves as Lee (Janyse Jaud), Marie (Kathleen Barr) and May Kanker (Erin Fitzgerald). The Eds begin to offer their own introductions, but are stopped short by the sisters who are already familiar with the boys' names. As the Kankers head into the kitchen to prepare food for the Eds, Double D anxiously proposes that the three of them leave. However, Eddy stops him, insisting that they stay at least for the free food. Looking around, the boys notice drawings of themselves, each paired with one the Kankers: Ed with May, Double D with Marie, and Eddy with Lee. Although left unsettled by this discovery, they eagerly accept the food that is brought out to them and begin to relax, as the Kankers slip a movie into the VCR and go upstairs to freshen up.|$|E

5|$|The game's story {{revolves}} around creatures known as Tikis, which <b>are</b> <b>new</b> <b>to</b> the series. The {{different types of}} Tikis fill {{the role of the}} antagonists in the story, replacing the Kremlings from Donkey Kong Country. Cranky Kong, who owns shops throughout the island, is the only Kong family member that appears other than Donkey and Diddy. The story begins when a group of evil Tikis known as the Tiki Tak Tribe arrive on Donkey Kong Island after being awoken by a volcanic eruption, and play music to hypnotize the animals on the island into stealing Donkey Kong's bananas. Since Donkey Kong is resistant to the Tikis' music, he works with Diddy Kong to retrieve his hoard of bananas from the Tikis. Throughout the game, the pair travel through eight worlds to recover their stolen bananas: the Jungle, the Beach, the Ruins, the Cave, the Forest, the Cliff, the Factory, and the Volcano. In each world, they must defeat a Tiki Tak Tribe leader: Kalimba, the Maraca Triplets, Gong, Banjo, Panflute, Xylophone, Accordion (who hypnotizes other animals in the jungle to fight the Kongs), and Tiki Tong, the king of the Tiki Tak Tribe. After Tiki Tong is defeated, the Kongs are launched into space where they punch down on the Moon, crushing Tiki Tong's base and sending bananas flying everywhere.|$|E

25|$|MacDonald et al. (1990) has {{described}} four general community types. These are communities dominated by Vestimentiferan tube worms (Lamellibrachia c.f. barhami and Escarpia spp.), mytilid mussels (Seep Mytilid Ia, Ib, and III, and others), vesicomyid clams (Vesicomya cordata and Calyptogena ponderosa), and infaunal lucinid or thyasirid clams (Lucinoma sp. or Thyasira sp.). Bacterial mats are present at all sites visited to date. These faunal groups tend to display distinctive characteristics {{in terms of}} how they aggregate, the size of aggregations, the geological and chemical properties of the habitats in which they occur and, to some degree, the heterotrophic fauna that occur with them. Many of the species found at these cold seep communities in the Gulf of Mexico <b>are</b> <b>new</b> <b>to</b> science and remain undescribed.|$|E
