5|$|By {{the time}} Pandora {{comes out of}} the bathroom, Cook is the only person left at the house. Together they play Twister, which was all Pandora had wanted to do, along with {{learning}} from her friends about human sexuality. Cook offers to have sex with her, and they spend the night together. Effy visits Pandora the next morning, and sees Cook share a kiss with her as he leaves. Feeling hurt, she confronts Pandora, but to no avail, as Pandora is slightly empowered after losing her virginity. Pandora defiantly tells Effy that Cook, due to his promiscuity and impulsive, carnal behavior, belongs to no one. Effy appears to understand, and makes no rebuttal. Suddenly, Thomas appears and runs up to Pandora, and she sobs in his arms as <b>a</b> <b>thoughtful</b> Effy looks on.|$|E
5|$|Vilhelm Moberg, in {{his history}} of the Swedish people, {{provides}} <b>a</b> <b>thoughtful</b> discussion of the atrocities which were committed by {{both sides in the}} struggle over the border provinces, and identified them as the source of propaganda to inflame the peoples' passions to continue the struggle. These lopsided representations were incorporated into history text books on the respective sides. As an example, Moberg compares the history texts he grew up with in Sweden which represented the Swedish soldier as ever pure and honorable to a letter written by Gustavus Adolphus celebrating the 24Scanian parishes he had helped level by fire, with the troops encouraged to rape and murder the population at will, behavior that may well have been mirrored equally on the Danish side. Skåneland was a rather unpleasant place to dwell for an extended period.|$|E
25|$|Pickering {{became a}} regular first team player {{at the end}} of the 1920s as Gillespie's playing career wound down. Jack's ball control was {{excellent}} as was his passing. He played <b>a</b> <b>thoughtful</b> studied game, simple in essence, but he was also a fast runner and began to score splendid goals with hard shots often from around the edge of the six yard box.|$|E

25|$|Phillips died January 14, 1884 in Washington, D.C. and {{is buried}} in Laurel Grove Cemetery in Savannah, Georgia. He {{achieved}} a solid reputation as <b>a</b> <b>thoughtful</b> moderate among the leading national figures of his day. Being a Southern Unionist, he had the opportunity, according {{to at least one}} biographer, to have had a career comparable to the career of U.S. President Andrew Johnson. This was complicated by his religion, and it was made impossible by the unrestrained activities of his wife.|$|E
25|$|Milton's {{family moved}} out west from Hammersmith to Horton during 1636, {{further into the}} English countryside. In November 1638, Milton wrote Lycidas and the work was {{published}} {{in a collection of}} other memorial works for Edward King, who had attended Christ's College with Milton, published that year. While Milton knew King, who had been elected to a fellowship, it is not clear they were close friends. Lycidas is <b>a</b> <b>thoughtful</b> elegy in the pastoral style, and it appeared over the initials J.M.|$|E
25|$|In 1934, Adams {{decided not}} to seek reelection, but rather to {{challenge}} the popular incumbent U.S. Senator John G. Townsend, Jr. for his U.S. Senate seat. <b>A</b> <b>thoughtful</b> moderate Republican, Townsend had supported much of the New Deal legislation, and had demonstrated considerable effectiveness through {{his involvement in the}} establishment of such things as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. By contrast, Adams had a low profile in the House of Representatives and Townsend was able to raise questions about Adams' effectiveness for Delaware. Once again bucking national trends, Delaware had its own local Republican landslide in 1934, led by Townsend. Adams came home and moved to Georgetown, Delaware where he continued the practice of law. He was also the acting Postmaster at Georgetown, from May 6, 1937, until his death.|$|E

25|$|Mursilis {{appears as}} a {{significant}} figure {{in the first two}} novels of Philip Armstrong's series The Chronicles of Tupiluliuma. He is Tupilu's uncle, who took him into his own family when he was orphaned, and is portrayed as <b>a</b> <b>thoughtful,</b> sympathetic man. In The Shadow Prince, he is haunted by guilt at his father's apparent usurpation of the throne and comes to believe that only his own self-sacrifice will abate the gods' anger and end the plague known as the White Death; he is dissuaded from this action by Ra'an, who explains the true circumstances of his father, Suppiluliumas, coming to the throne. He is also revealed to be, unwittingly, the biological father of the Amazon princess, Birrula. In the second book, , he suffers a stroke and is nursed back to health by Kantiya, daughter of the royal physician.|$|E
25|$|Due {{to a lack}} {{of content}} restrictions, some of Japan's {{earliest}} adventure games were also bishoujo games with eroge content. In 1982, Koei released Night Life, the first commercial erotic computer game. It was a graphic adventure, with sexually explicit images. That same year, they released another eroge title, Danchi Tsuma no Yuwaku (Seduction of the Condominium Wife), which was an early adventure game with color graphics, owing to the eight-color palette of the NEC PC-8001 computer, and role-playing video game elements. It became a hit, helping Koei become a major software company. Other now-famous companies such as Enix, Square and Nihon Falcom also produced similar eroge in the early 1980s before they became famous for their mainstream role-playing games. In some of their early eroge, the adult content is meaningfully integrated into <b>a</b> <b>thoughtful</b> and mature storyline, though others often used it as a flimsy excuse for pornography.|$|E
25|$|In {{the heart}} of the modern {{controversy}} lies Secher's evidence, which Charles Tilly analyzed in 1990. Initially, Tilly maintains, Secher completed <b>a</b> <b>thoughtful</b> dissertation-style thesis about the revolutionary experience in his own village, La Chapelle-Basse-Mer, which lies near Nantes. In the published version of his thesis, he incorporated some of Tilly's own arguments: that conflicts within communities generalized into a region-wide confrontation of anti-revolutionary majority based in the countryside with a pro-revolutionary minority that had particular strength in the cities. The split formed with the application of the Civil Constitution of the Clergy and the oath to support it, in 1790–1792. From then, the local conflicts grew more sharply defined, over the choice between juring and non-juring priests. The conscription of March 1793, with the questionable exemption for Republican officials and National Guard members, broadened the anti-revolutionary coalition and brought the young men into action.|$|E

25|$|Hosking's {{search for}} <b>a</b> <b>thoughtful</b> and {{appropriate}} {{design for the}} three rose windows of the chapel, {{may also have been}} influenced partly by the St. Procopius basilica which incorporates a rare example of the use of a naturalistic ten-part rose window. All wild roses have five petals and five sepals or multiples of this number, as do theor fruit. Similarly a lime, orange or lemon which belong to the Roseaceae family will also normally show ten fruit segments, as can be seen if cut in half. The adoption of a botanical rose window introduced an element of classical learning and reason rather than the tendency of gothic towards the more elaborate and supernatural. Its choice would also have suited the horticulturalist and scientist George Loddiges who was on the design team for he saw the 'hand of the Creator' in the beautiful natural designs of botanical species and varieties. His multi-part work, 'The Botanical Cabinet' took a distinctly more religious view of botany than competitor's illustrated works such as Curtis' Botanical Magazine and was noted for its piety. Near to the chapel with its splendid botanical rose windows George Loddiges laid out a special rosarium to bring attention to this rich and diverse plan family. The botanical rose windows would also have suited George Collison for his ancestral town was Beverley in Yorkshire, where he would have been familiar with the widespread use of the White Rose of York as a symbol and have seen it reproduced, taking up the theme of the rose, in the rare ten-part botanical rose windows of Beverley Minster.|$|E

The authors present theories of human needs and the basis for a common core of needs. They discuss theories that explain the importance of understanding human needs in the context of conflict resolution. They clearly distinguish core human needs from interests (strategies) and how focusing on needs is a paradigm shift in the field of conflict resolution.

500|$|In {{the book}} Leaving Springfield, author William J. Savage, Jr. said the episode [...] "reveals a fine edged attack on censors and <b>a</b> <b>thoughtful</b> and subtle {{consideration}} of issues regarding assisted suicide." [...] In the book The Deep End of South Park, Anne Gossage complimented the ambition of episode's themes of censorship and {{the morality of}} assisted suicide, which she called [...] "a great deal of ground to cover in 20 minutes". Gossage also said the episode shared {{many of the same}} characteristics of William Shakespeare's play Hamlet, comparing Stan's contemplation of killing his grandfather to Hamlet's dilemmas after encountering his father's ghost.|$|E
