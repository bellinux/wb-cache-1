40|$|In this paper, an {{adaptive}} evolutionary multiobjective selection method of RBF Networks structure is discussed. The candidates of RBF Network structures are encoded into particles in Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). These particles evolve toward Pareto-optimal front defined by several objective functions with model accuracy and complexity. The problem of unsupervised and supervised learning is discussed with Adaptive Multi-Objective PSO (AMOPSO). This study suggests an approach of RBF Network training through simultaneous optimization of architectures and weights with Adaptive PSO-based multi-objective algorithm. Our {{goal is to}} determine whether Adaptive Multi-objective PSO can train RBF Networks, and the performance <b>is</b> <b>validated</b> <b>on</b> <b>accuracy</b> and complexity. The experiments are conducted on two benchmark datasets obtained from the machine learning repository. The results show that our proposed method provides an effective means for training RBF Networks that is competitive with PSO-based multi-objective algorithm. ...|$|R

40|$|Life is {{extremely}} complex and amazingly diverse; {{it has taken}} billions of years of evolution to attain the level of complexity we observe in nature now and ranges from single-celled prokaryotes to multi-cellular human beings. With availability of molecular sequence data, algorithms inferring homology and gene families have emerged and similarity in gene content between two genes has been the major signal utilized for homology inference. Recently {{there has been a}} significant rise in number of species with fully sequenced genome, which provides an opportunity to investigate and infer homologs with greater accuracy and in a more informed way. Phylogeny analysis explains the relationship between member genes of a gene family in a simple, graphical and plausible way using a tree representation. Bayesian phylogenetic inference is a probabilistic method used to infer gene phylogenies and posteriors of other evolutionary parameters. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, in particular using Metropolis-Hastings sampling scheme, is the most commonly employed algorithm to determine evolutionary history of genes. There are many softwares available that process results from each MCMC run, and explore the parameter posterior but {{there is a need for}} interactive software that can analyse both discrete and real-valued parameters, and which has convergence assessment and burnin estimation diagnostics specifically designed for Bayesian phylogenetic inference. In this thesis, a synteny-aware approach for gene homology inference, called GenFamClust (GFC), is proposed that uses gene content and gene order conservation to infer homology. The feature which distinguishes GFC from earlier homology inference methods is that local synteny has been combined with gene similarity to infer homologs, without inferring homologous regions. GFC <b>was</b> <b>validated</b> for <b>accuracy</b> <b>on</b> a simulated dataset. Gene families were computed by applying clustering algorithms on homologs inferred from GFC, and compared for accuracy, dependence and similarity with gene families inferred from other popular gene family inference methods on a eukaryotic dataset. Gene families in fungi obtained from GFC were evaluated against pillars from Yeast Gene Order Browser. Genome-wide gene families for some eukaryotic species are computed using this approach. Another topic focused in this thesis is the processing of MCMC traces for Bayesian phylogenetics inference. We introduce a new software VMCMC which simplifies post-processing of MCMC traces. VMCMC can be used both as a GUI-based application and as a convenient command-line tool. VMCMC supports interactive exploration, is suitable for automated pipelines and can handle both real-valued and discrete parameters observed in a MCMC trace. We propose and implement joint burnin estimators that are specifically applicable to Bayesian phylogenetics inference. These methods have been compared for similarity with some other popular convergence diagnostics. We show that Bayesian phylogenetic inference and VMCMC can be applied to infer valuable evolutionary information for a biological case – the evolutionary history of FERM domain.
