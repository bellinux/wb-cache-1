5|$|According to Tino's account, {{on the day}} of the election, Selvo was {{attending}} mass for the funeral of the late Doge at the new monastery church of San Nicolò built under Domenico Contarini on Lido, <b>an</b> <b>island</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Venetian Lagoon. The location was ideal for the funeral of a Doge not only because St Mark's Basilica was under construction at the time, but the new church was also spacious enough to hold a fairly large number of people. The location also proved ideal for the election of a new Doge for the very same reasons.|$|E

Alan is infuriated and takes a short walk, but runs back when Alice cries for help. He returns to the cabin just as Alice is being dragged into the lake's waters by a mysterious force. Alan dives into the water after her, blacking out as he submerges.|$|E

5|$|An epigraphic {{reference}} {{ascribed to}} Garulaka Simhaditya, {{the son of}} Varahdas, the king of Dwarka, is inscribed on a copper plate dated to 574AD, found in Palitana. The Greek writer of the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea referred to a place called Baraca, which has been interpreted as present-day Dwarka. A reference made in Ptolemy's Geography identified Barake as <b>an</b> <b>island</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Gulf of Kanthils, which has also been inferred to mean Dwarka.|$|E
5|$|Around 2 pm, the British barges {{carrying}} artillery floated {{down the}} La Chute River, and, contrary to plan, came down a channel between <b>an</b> <b>island</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> La Chute and the shore.

5|$|On May 14, a {{tropical}} cyclone was observed {{just east of}} Samar, <b>an</b> <b>island</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> east-central Philippines.

5|$|A small parrot ulna {{found on}} the Folle Anse archaeological site on Marie-Galante, <b>an</b> <b>island</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Guadeloupe region, was {{assigned}} to the Lesser Antillean macaw by the ornithologists Matthew Williams and David Steadman in 2001. In 2008, the ornithologists Storrs Olson and Edgar Maíz López cast doubt upon this identification, and proposed that the bone instead belonged to the extant imperial amazon (Amazona imperialis). The size and robustness of the bone was similar to ulnae of the imperial amazon, and though it was worn, the authors identified {{what appeared to be a}} notch, which is also present on ulnae of the genus Amazona, but not in the genus Ara. Subfossil remains from the island of Montserrat have also been suggested to belong to the Lesser Antillean macaw. The species was recognized by Birdlife International and the IUCN Red List until 2013, but was not considered valid thereafter.|$|E
5|$|By 20:00 {{that evening}} {{a large number}} of South Koreans were {{retreating}} in disarray through a gap in the line held by the brigade, the majority of them moving through the Australians. The South Korean 6th Division later regrouped in positions behind 27th Brigade, but was now reduced to less than half its original strength. Meanwhile, as the 20th Army veered to the west as part of the Chinese main effort against Seoul, the Chinese 118th Division continued its secondary advance down the Kapyong Valley, closely pursuing the retreating South Koreans. Racing down the northeast running valley, the 354th Regiment reached the Australian positions by about 22:00. Intent on capturing the important crossroads of Route 17 south of Kapyong, and most likely unaware of the location of the Australian blocking position, the Chinese vanguard remained in the low ground, splitting as they approached a long, low north-south running ridge that rose like <b>an</b> <b>island</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mouth of the valley.|$|E
5|$|By {{this stage}} Rome's entire {{position}} on the Rhine and even in Gaul was imperiled. Their civil war over, the Romans mustered a huge task force of eight legions (five dispatched from Italy, two from Spain and one from Britain) to deal with Civilis. Its commander Petillius Cerialis had to fight two difficult battles, at Trier and Xanten, before he could overrun the Batavi's homeland. Tacitus' surviving narrative breaks off as he describes a meeting on <b>an</b> <b>island</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Rhine delta between Civilis and Cerialis to discuss peace terms. We {{do not know the}} outcome of this meeting or Civilis' ultimate fate. But in view of his former friendship with Vespasian, who had already offered him a pardon, {{and the fact that the}} Romans still needed the Batavi levies, it is likely that the terms were lenient by Roman standards.|$|E

The son was called Krishna ("the dark one") due to his colour, or Dvaipayana ("one born on an island") and would later become known as Vyasa – compiler of the Vedas and author of the Puranas and the Mahabharata, fulfilling Parashara's prophecy. After this, Satyavati returned home to help her father.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert {{built the}} Garrick Theatre in 1889. The Gilberts moved to Grim's Dyke in Harrow in 1890, which he {{purchased}} from Robert Heriot, {{to whom the}} artist Frederick Goodall had sold the property in 1880. In 1891, Gilbert was appointed Justice of the Peace for Middlesex. After casting Nancy McIntosh in Utopia, Limited, {{he and his wife}} developed an affection for her, and she eventually gained the status of an unofficially adopted daughter, moving to Grim's Dyke to live with them. She continued living there, even after Gilbert died, until Lady Gilbert's death in 1936. A statue of Charles II, carved by Danish sculptor Caius Gabriel Cibber in 1681, was moved in 1875 from Soho Square to <b>an</b> <b>island</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lake at Grim's Dyke, where it remained when Gilbert purchased the property. On Lady Gilbert's direction, it was restored to Soho Square in 1938.|$|E
