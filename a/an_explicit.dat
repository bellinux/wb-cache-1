5|$|Plantinga's {{free will}} defense begins by asserting that Mackie's {{argument}} failed to establish <b>an</b> <b>explicit</b> logical contradiction between God {{and the existence}} of evil. In other words Plantinga shows that (1-4) are not on their own contradictory, and that any contradiction must originate from an atheologian's implicit unstated assumptions, assumptions representing premises not stated in the argument itself. With <b>an</b> <b>explicit</b> contradiction ruled out, an atheologian must add premises to the argument for it to succeed. Nonetheless, if Plantinga had offered no further argument then an atheologian's intuitive impressions that a contradiction must exist would have remain unanswered. Plantinga sought to resolve this by offering two further points.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposed}} <b>a</b> new <b>explicit</b> nonlinear dimensionality reduction using {{neural networks}} for image retrieval tasks. We first proposed a Quasi-curvature Locally Linear Embedding (QLLE) for training set. QLLE guarantees the linear criterion in neighborhood of each sample. Then, a neural method (NM) is proposed for out-of-sample problem. Combining QLLE and NM, we provide <b>a</b> <b>explicit</b> nonlinear dimensionality reduction approach for efficient image retrieval. The experimental results in three benchmark datasets illustrate that our method can get better performance than other state-of-the-art out-of-sample methods...|$|R
