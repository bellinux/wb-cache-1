40|$|In {{this project}} two {{inventories}} {{by means of}} extensive literature searches have been executed: Inventory 1 {{of all types of}} soil <b>and</b> <b>growing</b> media (if relevant components thereof) to be elaborated considering (i) the soil <b>and</b> <b>growing</b> medium imported as commodities (i. e. not in association with plants intended for planting), (ii) the soil <b>and</b> <b>growing</b> medium attached to plants for planting, and (iii) the soil <b>and</b> <b>growing</b> medium attached as a contaminant to imported goods (ranging from ware potatoes to agricultural machinery). Inventory 2, based on interceptions data and scientific and technical literature, of plant pests, plant diseases and weeds that can be associated with soil <b>and</b> <b>growing</b> medium (if relevant components thereof). Execution of Inventory 1 resulted in a list of 956 soils <b>and</b> <b>growing</b> media. Execution of Inventory 2 resulted in Excel tables for each taxonomic group separately in which the pests and diseases are linked to the soil <b>and</b> <b>growing</b> media. Additional information has been provided for processes applied to produce <b>growing</b> media <b>and</b> the impact on harmful organisms and private certification schemes applied in Europe to control the trade <b>and</b> use of <b>growing</b> media...|$|R

5|$|Marasmius sasicola {{is known}} from the lowland forests of Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan, {{and can be found}} in June. Mushrooms grow in large numbers close together, <b>and</b> <b>grow</b> from dead leaves of Sasa (grass bamboo) which have fallen.|$|E

5|$|The fungi {{have several}} {{unicellular}} species, such as baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe). Some fungi, {{such as the}} pathogenic yeast Candida albicans, can undergo phenotypic switching <b>and</b> <b>grow</b> as single cells in some environments, and filamentous hyphae in others.|$|E
5|$|Zombia is a {{monotypic}} genus of fan palms {{which is}} endemic to Hispaniola. Individuals {{are up to}} 3m (10ft) tall <b>and</b> <b>grow</b> in dry, hilly regions. It is restricted to serpentine soils, {{at least in the}} Dominican Republic.|$|E
5|$|A {{course of}} {{brachytherapy}} {{can be completed}} {{in less time than}} other radiotherapy techniques. This can help reduce the chance for surviving cancer-cells to divide <b>and</b> <b>grow</b> in the intervals between each radiotherapy dose. Patients typically have to make fewer visits to the radiotherapy clinic compared with EBRT, and may receive the treatment as outpatients. This makes treatment accessible and convenient for many patients. These features of brachytherapy mean that most patients are able to tolerate the brachytherapy procedure very well.|$|E
50|$|The shrub is {{evergreen}} <b>and</b> <b>grows</b> from 0.5 to 1.0 m tall. Its branches are dense, slender, and elongated. It {{flowers from}} February to April <b>and</b> <b>grows</b> on low mountains at altitudes ranging from 200 to 650 m.|$|R

5|$|After the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup, John Herdman {{was hired}} as {{head coach of the}} Canadian {{national}} team.

5|$|Biology {{began to}} quickly develop <b>and</b> <b>grow</b> with Anton van Leeuwenhoek's {{dramatic}} {{improvement of the}} microscope. It was then that scholars discovered spermatozoa, bacteria, infusoria and the diversity of microscopic life. Investigations by Jan Swammerdam led to new interest in entomology and helped to develop the basic techniques of microscopic dissection and staining.|$|E
5|$|Both {{bacteria}} and eukaryotes, but not archaea, make spores. Some species of Haloarchaea undergo phenotypic switching <b>and</b> <b>grow</b> as several different cell types, including thick-walled structures that {{are resistant to}} osmotic shock and allow the archaea to survive in water at low salt concentrations, {{but these are not}} reproductive structures and may instead help them reach new habitats.|$|E

5|$|Both monogamous and {{polygamous}} marriage are practiced, {{and the average}} Cameroonian family is large and extended. In the north, women tend to the home, and men herd cattle or work as farmers. In the south, women grow the family's food, and men provide meat <b>and</b> <b>grow</b> cash crops. Like most societies, Cameroonian society is male-dominated, and violence and discrimination against women is common.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{apparent}} simplicity, {{bacteria can}} form complex associations with other organisms. These symbiotic associations {{can be divided}} into parasitism, mutualism and commensalism. Due to their small size, commensal bacteria are ubiquitous <b>and</b> <b>grow</b> on animals and plants exactly as they will grow on any other surface. However, their growth can be increased by warmth and sweat, and large populations of these organisms in humans are the cause of body odour.|$|E
5|$|E. reichenbachii prefer {{full sun}} and require little water. They thrive in dry, well-drained, gravelly, clay, and loam soils, and near rock outcroppings. They are cold and heat tolerant, <b>and</b> <b>grow</b> well under glass. They are drought resistant, but {{susceptible}} to mealybugs and scale insects.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} mouse embryo, cytoplasmic {{polyadenylation}} of maternal RNAs from the egg cell allows the cell to survive <b>and</b> <b>grow</b> even though transcription does not start {{until the middle}} of the 2-cell stage (4-cell stage in human). In the brain, cytoplasmic polyadenylation is active during learning and could play a role in long-term potentiation, which is the strengthening of the signal transmission from a nerve cell to another in response to nerve impulses and is important for learning and memory formation.|$|E
