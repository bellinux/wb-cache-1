40|$|The {{influence}} of <b>organic</b> <b>additives</b> (Sasobit and RH) and {{water on the}} adhesion of the asphalt-aggregate interface was studied according to the surface free energy theory. Two asphalt binders (SK- 70 and SK- 90), and two aggregate types (limestone and basalt) were used in this study. The sessile drop method was employed to test surface free energy components of asphalt, <b>organic</b> <b>additives</b> and aggregates. The adhesion models of the asphalt-aggregate interface in dry and wet conditions were established, and the adhesion work was calculated subsequently. The energy ratios were built to evaluate the effect of <b>organic</b> <b>additives</b> and water on the adhesiveness of the asphalt-aggregate interface. The {{results indicate that the}} addition of <b>organic</b> <b>additives</b> can enhance the adhesion of the asphalt-aggregate interface in dry conditions, because <b>organic</b> <b>additives</b> reduced the surface free energy of asphalt. However, the <b>organic</b> <b>additives</b> have hydrophobic characteristics and are sensitive to water. As a result, the adhesiveness of the asphalt-aggregate interface of the asphalt containing <b>organic</b> <b>additives</b> in wet conditions sharply decreased due to water damage to asphalt and <b>organic</b> <b>additives.</b> Furthermore, the compatibility of asphalt, aggregate with <b>organic</b> <b>additive</b> was noted and discussed...|$|R

The studies focus on the role of small <b>organic</b> <b>additive</b> molecules in the tuning of the morphology of the films and their influence on the photoelectrochemical oxidation of water. The <b>organic</b> <b>additives,</b> namely, coumarin 343 (C 343), γ-glucuronic acid (GA) and sodium dodecyl sulfonate (Sds), possess functional moieties to interact with iron ions in the ED bath electrostatically or through metal–ligand complexation reactions.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} the results of a combined experimental and theoretical study on a clay ceramic used for building applications. The thermal and mechanical properties of the clay ceramic were improved by addition of <b>organic</b> <b>additives.</b> The <b>organic</b> <b>additives</b> consisted of Olive Stone Flour (OSF), with round-shape particles of 55 µm, and Wheat Straw (WS), with 877 µm particles in the form of fibers. It was found that the combustion of OSF and WS resulted in a porosity formation during the firing process. The morphology of these pores corresponded to that of the <b>organic</b> <b>additives.</b> Therefore, the addition of small OSF particles decreased the median pore size of the clay ceramic. It improved the mechanical strength of the clay ceramic by 12 % for an 8 wt% addition of OSF. On the other hand, the WS fibers increased the clay ceramic anisotropy. This resulted in a 41 % improvement of the thermal conductivity using an 8 wt% addition of WS. Finally, a model was developed from these experimental results to predict the thermal conductivity and the mechanical strength of the clay ceramic with other <b>organic</b> <b>additives.</b> They were predicted from the parameters of the <b>organic</b> <b>additives</b> (i. e., true density, swelling degree, particle size distribution, particle shape factor).
