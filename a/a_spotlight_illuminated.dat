50|$|A {{memorial}} {{was unveiled}} at Bakers Creek, near Mackay, Australia, on 11 May 1992, {{consisting of two}} brick columns aligned northwards on which are mounted flag poles and two brass plaques facing eastwards. Between the columns is a large aircraft propeller of a type fitted to Douglas C-47 / DC-3 / Dakota airplanes that was supplied by the Royal Australian Air Force. The plaques describe the crash and list the men known to have perished {{as well as the}} sole survivor. Above the monument is a brass model of a B-17C that was unveiled and saluted by a low-flying 5th AF US Air Force C-130 from Yokota AB, Japan, on 15 June 2003, during 60th Anniversary events marking the crash. A small brass plaque tells about the model. Two brass plaques representing the 46th Troop Carrier Squadron and the 5th Air Force Memorial Foundation are mounted on a plinth in front of the Bakers Creek Memorial: inside <b>a</b> <b>spotlight</b> <b>illuminates</b> the memorial for several hours each night. Annual commemorative ceremonies are held at the memorial, usually in June.|$|R
5000|$|One of his Broadway shows, his two-act Politically Incorrect (1994-95) {{which ran}} for 347 {{performances}} at Broadway's John Golden Theater. Critic John Simon of Time wrote: [...] "His method is hyperbole and reductio ad absurdum, but always informed by bitter reason. His irony is <b>a</b> <b>spotlight</b> <b>illuminating</b> our absurdities; his zingers are scalpels laying bare the sickness under the skin. There is a unifying thrust, a focus, a structure: {{an attack on}} both liberal hypocrisy and conservative apathy, and on the climate of political correctness that {{makes it impossible to}} attack anyone but WASPs.... Mason is a true satirist in the mold of ... Mark Twain ...." [...] It was performed during the same period that Bill Maher's late-night, half-hour political TV talk show Politically Incorrect was on the air. Maher brought a lawsuit against Mason's production, which was dismissed as frivolous. Mason was able to use this show title, and it is one of his most successful road productions. Between these shows, Mason played the lead in a short-lived television interfaith sitcom called Chicken Soup alongside Lynn Redgrave.|$|R
50|$|One of the most-recognized and {{reproduced}} exhibition {{spaces of}} the twentieth century, the Surrealist Gallery was Frederick Kiesler's design masterpiece. Within the long black-painted room, hanging curvilinear wall units displayed all the Surrealist works jutting out toward the viewer on adjustable arms. <b>As</b> originally presented, <b>spotlights</b> <b>illuminated</b> the paintings individually in a random electrically controlled sequence. At times the gallery was plunged into complete darkness accompanied by the ominous sound of an oncoming train.|$|R
2500|$|During the Bulls' run of dominance, {{the player}} {{introductions}} became world-famous. Longtime announcer Tommy Edwards {{was the first}} to use [...] "Sirius", [...] "On The Run" [...] and other songs in game presentation in the NBA. When Edwards moved to Boston for employment with CBS Radio, he was replaced by Ray Clay in 1990, and Clay continued many of the traditional aspects of the Bulls introductions, including the music, The Alan Parsons Project's [...] "Sirius", for all six championship runs. The lights are first dimmed during the visiting team introduction, accompanied by [...] "The Imperial March" [...] from Star Wars composed by John Williams or [...] "On the Run" [...] by Pink Floyd, or [...] "Tick of the Clock" [...] by Chromatics. Virtually all lights in the stadium are then shut off for the Bulls introduction, and <b>a</b> <b>spotlight</b> <b>illuminates</b> each player as he is introduced and runs onto the court; the spotlight is also focused on the Bulls logo prior to the introductions. Since the move to the United Center, lasers and fireworks have been added, and with improvements to the arena's White Way video screen, computer graphics on the stadium monitors have been added. These graphics feature the 3D-animated 'Running of the Bulls' en route to the United Center, along the way smashing a bus featuring the opposing team's logo. Coincidentally, Alan Parsons wrote [...] "Sirius" [...] for his own band and was the sound engineer for [...] "On the Run" [...] from Pink Floyd's album The Dark Side of the Moon.|$|R

40|$|Accretion from a disk onto a collapsed, {{relativistic}} star - {{a neutron}} star or black hole - is the mechanism widely believed {{to be responsible for}} the emission from compact X-ray binaries. Because of the extreme spatial resolution required, it is not yet possible to directly observe the evolution or dynamics of the inner parts of the accretion disk where general relativistic effects are dominant. Here, we use the bright X-ray emission from a superburst {{on the surface of the}} neutron star 4 U 1820 - 30 as <b>a</b> <b>spotlight</b> to <b>illuminate</b> the disk surface. The X-rays cause iron atoms in the disk t o fluoresce, allowing a determination of the ionization state, covering factor and inner radius of the disk over the course of the burst. The time-resolved spectral fitting shows that the inner region of the disk is disrupted by the burst, possibly being heated into a thicker, more tenuous flow, before recovering its previous form in approximately 1000 s. This marks the first instance that the evolution of the inner regions of an accretion disk has been observed in real-time...|$|R
40|$|A {{class of}} {{questions}} in the human environment sciences focuses {{on the relationship between}} individual or household behavior and local geographic context. Central to these questions is the nature of people's geographic mobility as well as the duration of their locational stability at varying spatial and temporal scales. The problem for researchers is that the processes of mobility/stability are temporally and spatially dynamic and therefore difficult to measure. Whereas time and space are continuous, analysts must select levels of aggregation for both length of time in place and spatial scale of place that fit with the problem in question. Previous work has emphasized mobility and suppressed stability as an analytic category. I focus here on stability and show how analyzing individuals' stability requires also analyzing their mobility. Through an empirical example centered on the relationship between entrepreneurship and place, I demonstrate how <b>a</b> <b>spotlight</b> on stability <b>illuminates</b> <b>a</b> resolution to the measurement problem by highlighting the interdependence between the time and space dimensions of stability/mobility...|$|R
50|$|The first 71 of {{this class}} {{initially}} or still homed at Mughalsarai (MGS) shed {{and the second}} was Kanpur (CNB). Some units are retrofitted with Static Converters(STC) instead of Arno Rotary Converters. STCs are more efficient and require less maintenance. Also, STCs have self diagnostics making troubleshooting easier. WAG-7H is a heavy variant of WAG-7. WAG-7H #28739 has thicker under-frames. WAG-7 #27445 has closed-circuit cameras to monitor the pantograph along with <b>a</b> <b>spotlight</b> to <b>illuminate</b> the same at night, green lamps to exchange signals and a single windscreen on either side. New Katni (NKJ) shed has added Overhead Equipment(OHE) monitors. Some WAG-7 units have A.C. cabs, SIV, MPFDCS, MPCS, Single arm pantograph, FDCS, Additional COC, Rear-view mirrors, STS, Daulat Ram's Roof-mounted DBRs, SI, Modified ceilings, Bucket seats, Waist-level headlamps, High-reach pantographs, Vigilance Control Device(VCD), Wireless Multiple Control, Vertical Dynamic Brake Resistor(DBR) and microprocessor control. Some units have their MU cables removed. One unit has SCHUNK pantograph. Some units are assembled at Dahod Workshops. Initially WAG-7 had the body-shell similar to WAG-5 but later on all WAG-7 are/were fitted with crew safe shell like the WAP-4 since this provided more space and relatively safer during the impact on a head on collision. WAG-7H have crew safe shell since beginning. Older WAG-7s have Tiger Face liveries (Red/Dark Blue on white) but newer WAG-7s by CLW have yellow stripe on blue livery. All BHEL built WAG-7s have Tiger Face livery. Now, even some older WAG-7s are repainted with yellow stripe on blue livery. It {{is also the most}} powerful indigenously designed freight-dedicated locomotive in India.|$|R

5000|$|The {{production}} {{begins with}} a news reporter announcing the fall of Tony Blair, before the erstwhile prime minister is carried onstage, funeral-style, by four pallbearers, to melancholic chants of [...] "Tony!". He is then thrown to the ground to the crash of a drum fill, where he begins to sing the opening number, [...] "Tony's Entrance," [...] in which he declares his intention to recount {{the past ten years}} of his career to the audience, while the ex-pallbearers perform an ironic 1990s boy band-style dance. It then returns to Blair's election victory in 1997, in which he waves to adoring crowds and congratulates deputy prime minister John Prescott and chancellor Gordon Brown on their success. An aide then arrives to tell him the people are calling for him, at which point a second aide rushes on with a guitar for him to play. <b>A</b> single <b>spotlight</b> then <b>illuminates</b> Tony for his first monologue, in which he tells of the wonder of these first glorious days in power, and of how he became the 'people's prime minister.' He then kneels to pray, attempting to sneakily ask God for a report on how he's doing so far, before being interrupted by the angelic ghost of Diana, Princess of Wales. A clearly uninterested Diana tells him to become the next princess, the people's prime minister, and then warns him against a future of joining George W. Bush in invading Iraq, before drifting mysteriously away, leaving a completely nonplussed Tony in the spotlight.|$|R
