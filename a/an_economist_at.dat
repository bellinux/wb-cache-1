25|$|Based on {{a formula}} by Gilles Saint-Paul, <b>an</b> <b>economist</b> <b>at</b> Toulouse 1 University, {{the demand for}} unskilled human capital declines at a slower rate than the demand for skilled human capital increases.

25|$|Peter Temin <b>an</b> <b>economist</b> <b>at</b> the Massachusetts Institute of Technology {{explains}} a tariff is an expansionary policy, like a devaluation as it diverts demand from foreign to home producers. He notes that exports were 7 percent of GNP in 1929, they fell by 1.5 percent of 1929 GNP {{in the next}} two years and the fall was offset by the increase in domestic demand from tariff. He concludes that contrary the popular argument, contractionary effect of the tariff was small.|$|E

The decline in exports and increase in imports cut Japan's trade surplus $1.28 billion a decline of 90 percent from the previous year. <b>An</b> <b>economist</b> <b>at</b> the Royal Bank of Scotland said the decline means the Japanese economy most likely declined in the second quarter.

M. A.

25|$|M. V. Lee Badgett, <b>an</b> <b>economist</b> <b>at</b> the University of Massachusetts Amherst, {{presented}} in March 2014 {{in a meeting}} of the World Bank the results of a study about the economical impact of homophobia in India. Only in health expenses, caused by depression, suicide, and HIV treatment, India would have spent additional 23,100 million dollars due to homophobia. On top, there would be costs caused by violence, workplace loss, rejection of the family, and bullying at school, that would result in a lower education level, lower productivity, lower wages, worse health, and a lower life expectancy among the LGBT population. In total, she estimated for 2014 in India a loss of up to 30,800 million dollars, or 1,7 % of the Indian GDP.|$|E

500|$|On October 4, the NBA {{canceled}} {{the remainder of}} the preseason. Stern said the league would lose $200 million by canceling the preseason, and warned that {{the first two weeks of}} the season would be in jeopardy if no deal is reached by October 10. The players proposed that they receive 53% of BRI, while the owners countered with 47%. The two sides then discussed a 50–50 split of BRI, with the owners offering the players 49% of BRI with incentives that would raise the value to 51%. The players countered by asking for 51%, which would increase to 53 percent using those same incentives. It was rejected by the owners. Attempts for the sides to meet on October 7 failed. The union said the NBA demanded a 50–50 revenue split prior to the meeting, while the league refuted making any such demands. After talks on October 9 and 10, the two sides were unable to reach a deal and Stern subsequently {{canceled the}} first two weeks of regular-season games, which were originally scheduled to begin on November 1. [...] BRI remained the main issue, but other differences included luxury tax, player contract length, and the mid-level exception. The owners proposed a $2 tax for every $1 that a team spends above the tax threshold for player salaries. The tax would rise to as high as $4 for every $1 above the limit for teams that are repeat offenders. The previous CBA in comparison called for a $1 tax for every $1 over the limit. The players refused to accept a hard salary cap, which they felt the more punitive luxury taxes would effectively create. Stern said the owners felt a harsher luxury tax would make the league more competitive. Wade countered that a small-market team like the San Antonio Spurs had won multiple championships. Andrew Zimbalist, <b>an</b> <b>economist</b> <b>at</b> Smith College, said that [...] "the statistical correlation between payroll and win percentage is practically nonexistent" [...] in the NBA. ESPN concluded that a team's draft efficiency accounted for 34% of its winning percentage in the past decade, while payroll showed only a 7% correlation. The New York Times noted that a fairer system was needed for the small-market teams, but the league's popularity historically relied on predictably successful teams with multiple superstars.|$|E

2500|$|Hydro-Québec {{would pay}} C$750 million from its cash flow and issue C$4 billion in bonds. CEO Thierry Vandal stated {{the deal would}} allow Hydro-Québec to double its sales to the United States by 2011, but some, like New England Power Generators Association president, Angela O'Connor, worried {{that it could be}} {{standing}} in the way of Canadian competitors from exporting energy to New England. However, these worries were unfounded, responded Jean-Thomas Bernard, chair of Electricity economics at Université Laval, in Quebec City, since non-discrimatory policies set by the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission [...] guaranteed open access to the North American power grid. [...] "Since Hydro-Québec is already a major exporter to the United States, they would do nothing to jeopardize the agreements". Pierre-Marcel Desjardins, <b>an</b> <b>economist</b> <b>at</b> the Université de Moncton, stated that right now the grid is full so Hydro-Québec could slow the development of new transmission lines but it could be more difficult to develop additional transmission for new energy projects. Hydro-Québec's Vandal responds to this criticism by stating his company's intention to invest in extra transmission capacity to New England.|$|E

2500|$|However, {{others have}} criticized Sowell for drawing causal inferences without a {{coherent}} methodology, and for commenting on subjects {{in which he}} has no training or formal background, a criticism Sowell has issued towards others. In 1981, The New York Times noted that two of Sowell's books, Markets and Minorities and Ethnic America, [...] "have just been published, to much praise from fellow conservatives and a lot of criticism, some of it bitter, from fellow blacks and from liberal intellectuals." [...] Bernadette Chachere, <b>an</b> <b>economist</b> <b>at</b> Hampton University, criticized Markets and Minorities for ignoring past economic research on income disparities between races: [...] "To cite one article published in 1973, after controlling for age, region of residence, parents' income, father's occupation and education, place where raised, number of siblings, health, local labor, market conditions, geographic mobility, and seasonal employment, there still remained a 70% difference in the earnings of whites and nonwhites unexplained... the lack of such a [...] review does preclude Sowell's claim to a monopoly on 'rigorous' analysis. Sowell is walking on severely trampled terrain as if it were virgin territory. There is not one footnote to this chapter." ...|$|E
2500|$|With John Whitley at the University of Adelaide, Lott has {{considered}} crime {{rates and the}} possible influence of laws which place abortion decisions with the pregnant person other than boards of physicians. [...] They acknowledge the old 1960s argument that abortion may prevent the birth of [...] "unwanted" [...] children, who would have relatively small investments in human capital and a higher probability of crime. [...] On the other hand, their research suggests that liberalizing abortion rules correlates {{with an increase in}} out-of-wedlock births and single parent families. [...] In turn, they argue that this increase in single parent births implies the opposite effect on investments in human capital (i.e., average investment per child decreases under their argument). [...] Using the correlation between children in poverty and in single parent homes with crime they build an argument that liberalization of abortion laws increased murder rates by around about 0.5 to 7 percent. In {{a review of the literature}} on the relationship between abortion and crime, Theodore Joyce, <b>an</b> <b>economist</b> <b>at</b> Baruch College and the National Bureau of Economic Research, praised Lott and Whitley for gathering additional data on abortion but criticized the methodology that they used.|$|E
2500|$|<b>An</b> <b>economist</b> <b>at</b> Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, British Columbia {{who makes}} ties between {{same-sex}} parenting and childhood instability {{by looking at}} couples from unstable homes and comparing them {{to those who have}} been raised consistently by two heterosexual parents. Allen takes a 2010 study by Michael Rosenfeld - who testified for the plaintiffs, and re-examines it by adding in the outliers. [...] "We re-examine Rosenfeld's (2010) study on the association between child outcomes and same-sex family structure. Using the same data set, we replicate and generalize Rosenfeld's findings and show that the implications of his study are different when using either alternative comparison groups or alternative sample restrictions. Compared with traditional married households, we find that children being raised by same-sex couples are 35 percent less likely to make normal progress through school; this difference is statistically significant at the one percent level," [...] states the brief for Allen's report. Signed onto an amicus brief with both Price and Regnerus urging the Supreme Court to uphold California’s Proposition 8. Allen was the defense's final witness and testified on March 6, 2014 that the state [...] "should be very cautious in making such a fundamental change to such a fundamental institution when there really isn’t any evidence on the child outcomes." [...] Allen argued that although U.S. psychology and sociology organizations have expressed consensus opinions that children of same-sex couples suffer no measurable disadvantages, conflicting results and limited data show that there's no such certainty on the matter. While maintaining he has no bias, he admitted that his religious views lead him to believe that homosexual acts are grounds for being sent to Hell.|$|E
