5|$|A wasp is any insect of {{the order}} Hymenoptera and {{suborder}} Apocrita that is neither <b>a</b> <b>bee</b> nor an ant. The Apocrita have a common evolutionary ancestor and form a clade; wasps as a group do not form a clade, but are paraphyletic with respect to bees and ants.|$|E
5|$|In rural Alberta, Canada, a {{telephone}} lineman is stung by <b>a</b> <b>bee</b> {{as he works}} {{at the top of}} a pole. Five identical boys approach and watch as the lineman adversely reacts to the sting, causing him to fall to the ground and die. The boys look down at his body, then walk off silently.|$|E
5|$|The humorous 2007 {{animated}} film Bee Movie used Jerry Seinfeld's first script and {{was his first}} work for children; he starred as <b>a</b> <b>bee</b> named Barry B. Benson, alongside Renée Zellweger. Critics found its premise awkward and its delivery tame.|$|E
50|$|Historically {{the word}} bee {{has been used}} to {{describe}} a get-together where a specific action is being carried out, such as <b>a</b> husking <b>bee,</b> <b>a</b> quilting <b>bee,</b> or <b>an</b> apple <b>bee.</b> Its etymology is unclear, but the word possibly derives from the Old English word bēn, meaning prayer.|$|R

5|$|The {{life cycle}} of <b>a</b> <b>bee,</b> be it a solitary or social species, {{involves}} the laying of an egg, the development through several moults of a legless larva, a pupation stage during which the insect undergoes complete metamorphosis, followed {{by the emergence of}} a winged adult. Most solitary bees and bumble bees in temperate climates overwinter as adults or pupae and emerge in spring when increasing numbers of flowering plants come into bloom. The males usually emerge first and search for females with which to mate. The sex of <b>a</b> <b>bee</b> is determined by whether or not the egg is fertilised; after mating, a female stores the sperm, and determines which sex is required at the time each individual egg is laid, fertilised eggs producing female offspring and unfertilised eggs, males. Tropical bees may have several generations in a year and no diapause stage.|$|E
5|$|A temulent bee is {{more likely}} to stick out its tongue, or proboscis. Inebriated bees spend more time flying. If <b>a</b> <b>bee</b> is {{sufficiently}} intoxicated, it will just lie on its back and wiggle its legs. Inebriated bees typically have many more flying accidents as well. Some bees that consume ethanol become too inebriated to find their way back to the hive, and will die as a result. Bozic et al. (2006) found that alcohol consumption by honeybees disrupts foraging and social behaviors, and has some similar effects to poisoning with insecticides. Some bees become more aggressive after consuming alcohol.|$|E
5|$|Banjo and Kazooie are {{occasionally}} {{aided by}} their friend Mumbo Jumbo, a shaman who can use magical powers to transform them into several creatures like a termite, a pumpkin, <b>a</b> <b>bee,</b> a walrus, and a crocodile. These transformations {{have their own}} special features and allow the player to access areas that were previously inaccessible. For instance, the walrus can resist the effects of icy-cold water. Mumbo Tokens that are scattered throughout the game allow the transformation process. The game also includes cheats that the player can unlock by finding Gruntilda's spellbook, Cheato.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> {{laying worker}} <b>bee</b> is <b>a</b> worker <b>bee</b> that lays unfertilized eggs {{usually in the}} absence of <b>a</b> queen <b>bee</b> (cf gamergates in ants). Only drones develop from the eggs of laying worker bees (with some exceptions, see thelytoky). A beehive cannot survive with only <b>a</b> laying worker <b>bee.</b>|$|R
5|$|It {{is usually}} easy to {{recognise}} {{that a particular}} insect is <b>a</b> <b>bee.</b> They differ from closely related groups such as wasps by having branched or plume-like setae (bristles), combs on the forelimbs for cleaning their antennae, small anatomical differences in the limb structure and the venation of the hind wings, and in females, by having the seventh dorsal abdominal plate divided into two half-plates.|$|E
5|$|Research, in 2008, by {{scientists}} from Pennsylvania State University found {{high levels of}} the pesticides fluvalinate and coumaphos in samples of wax from hives, as well as lower levels of 70 other pesticides. These chemicals {{have been used to}} try to eradicate varroa mites, <b>a</b> <b>bee</b> pest that itself has been thought to be a cause of CCD. Researchers from Washington State University, under entomology professor Steve Sheppard in 2009, confirmed high levels of pesticide residue in hive wax and found an association between it and significantly reduced bee longevity.|$|E
5|$|The {{life cycle}} of a termite begins with an egg, but is {{different}} from that of <b>a</b> <b>bee</b> or ant in that it goes through a developmental process called incomplete metamorphosis, with egg, nymph and adult stages. Nymphs resemble small adults, and go through a series of moults as they grow. In some species, eggs go through four moulting stages and nymphs go through three. Nymphs first moult into workers, and then some workers go through further moulting and become soldiers or alates; workers become alates only by moulting into alate nymphs.|$|E
5000|$|Historically {{the word}} bee {{has been used}} to {{describe}} a get-together for communal work, like <b>a</b> husking <b>bee,</b> <b>a</b> quilting <b>bee,</b> or <b>an</b> apple <b>bee.</b> According to etymological research recorded in dictionaries, the word probably comes from dialectal been or bean (meaning [...] "help given by neighbors"), which came from Middle English bene (meaning [...] "prayer", [...] "boon" [...] and [...] "extra service by a tenant to his lord").|$|R
50|$|Kakugo {{virus is}} a picorna-like virus most {{commonly}} found in the brains of worker <b>bees.</b> It is <b>a</b> subtype of the Deformed wing virus. The Kakugo (Japanese for 'ready to attack') virus, when resident in <b>a</b> <b>bee's</b> brain, can contribute to aggressive behaviors such as are preeminent during <b>a</b> <b>bee's</b> guard phase in their life cycle. Kakugo is the first virus to {{have been found to}} cause aggressive behavior, although because the virus was only recently discovered to have such effects, research into the matter is limited.|$|R

5|$|After {{returning}} to Washington, D.C., Scully attends a performance hearing, after {{which she is}} transferred. Mulder is devastated to lose his partner. The two are about to share a kiss when Scully is stung by <b>a</b> <b>bee</b> which had lodged itself under her shirt collar, and she quickly loses consciousness. Mulder calls paramedics, but {{the driver of the}} ambulance shoots Mulder and whisks Scully away. Mulder, not severely injured, slips out of hospital with the help of The Lone Gunmen and FBI Assistant Director Walter Skinner. He then meets a former adversary, the Well-Manicured Man, who gives him Scully's location, along with a vaccine against the virus that has infected her. As Mulder leaves, the Well-Manicured Man kills himself in a car bomb, before his betrayal of The Syndicate is discovered.|$|E
5|$|Most {{bees are}} polylectic (generalist) meaning they collect pollen {{from a range}} of {{flowering}} plants, however, some are oligoleges (specialists), in that they only gather pollen from one or a few species or genera of closely related plants. Specialist pollinators also include bee species which gather floral oils instead of pollen, and male orchid bees, which gather aromatic compounds from orchids (one of the few cases where male bees are effective pollinators). Bees are able to sense the presence of desirable flowers through ultraviolet patterning on flowers, floral odors, and even electromagnetic fields. Once landed, <b>a</b> <b>bee</b> then uses nectar quality and pollen taste to determine whether to continue visiting similar flowers.|$|E
5|$|Nine power-ups each supply Mario with {{a special}} costume that grants him {{temporary}} abilities. For example, special mushrooms bestow the player with <b>a</b> <b>Bee,</b> Boo, or Spring Suit. The Bee Suit allows Mario to temporarily hover through the air, climb special walls, and walk on clouds and flowers; the Boo Suit allows him to float through the air, as well as become transparent and move through certain obstacles; and the Spring Suit allows him to jump to high areas that would be otherwise inaccessible, yet lowering his mobility. The recurring Fire Flower allows Mario to throw fireballs at enemies, and the newly introduced Ice Flower allows Mario to create hexagonal tiles of ice to cover any liquid surface he walks on. The Rainbow Star grants Mario invincibility, allowing him to destroy any enemies that he touches, {{as well as being}} able to run faster.|$|E

5|$|The Cooperativa Obrera Mataronense (Mataró Workers' Cooperative) was Gaudí's {{first big}} project, {{on which he}} worked from 1878 to 1882, for Salvador Pagès i Anglada. The project, for the cooperative's head office in Mataró, {{comprised}} a factory, a worker's housing estate, a social centre and a services building, though only the factory and the services building were completed. In the factory roof Gaudí used the catenary arch {{for the first time}}, with a bolt assembly system devised by Philibert de l'Orme. He also used ceramic tile decoration {{for the first time in}} the services building. Gaudí laid out the site taking account of solar orientation, another signature of his works, and included landscaped areas. He even designed the Cooperative's banner, with the figure of <b>a</b> <b>bee,</b> symbol of industriousness.|$|E
5|$|Angelica tasks Chuckie {{to pick a}} {{dandelion}} {{to decorate}} her sculpture. He is unable to obtain it after being chased by <b>a</b> <b>bee</b> and Stu's malfunctioning Mother's Day invention, which is a vacuum-like machine that destroys {{a majority of the}} lawn. After Chuckie breaks her macaroni head, Angelina orders him to stay in the closet along with Tommy, Phil, and Lil. While the babies console Chuckie, he realizes that his dad meets all the requirements of a good mother. They open Chaz's box, finding a spade, a journal of pressed flowers, and a photograph of Chuckie's mother. Meanwhile, Stu's invention continues to vacuum up mud before finally exploding inside the house. Didi is disappointed that Minka did not like the spa, but Minka says she only wanted to spend time with her daughter for Mother's Day. Chuckie gives Chaz the picture of his mother as a Mother's Day present. Chaz decides to talk to Chuckie about his mother, telling him that his mother died of a terminal illness shortly after his birth. He explains that she wrote the diary while she was in the hospital, and reads a poem aloud that she wrote for Chuckie. The mother narrates the poem during a flashback to when she played with Chuckie in the backyard. As they play in the backyard, the episode ends with Chuckie telling his friends that his mother is all around in him in nature.|$|E
5|$|At the Kwik-E-Mart, Apu {{is selling}} items to {{customers}} at outrageous prices, like normal. Apu scribbles out the 1989 expiration date on {{a package of}} ham and then lowers the price instead of throwing it out. Homer buys the meat, eats it, and contracts food poisoning. After recovering, Homer returns to the Kwik-E-Mart to complain, and Apu gives him two five-pound buckets of expired shrimp to placate him. Homer eats the shrimp and becomes ill again. Whilst recovering at home, Homer sees the Channel 6 investigative news program Bite Back with Kent Brockman. Lisa gives him the idea to get the show to investigate the Kwik-E-Mart. Kent gives Homer a giant novelty hat containing a spy camera to expose Apu for selling expired food. Though Homer almost immediately abandons the hat after mistaking the buzzing of the machinery as <b>a</b> <b>bee,</b> the camera catches Apu placing a hot dog that he had dropped on the ground back into the hot dog cooker. Apu is immediately fired by his company (even though he was actually following company policy), and is replaced by actor James Woods, who is doing research for a role in an upcoming film.|$|E

5|$|Social insects, such as termites, ants {{and many}} bees and wasps, {{are the most}} {{familiar}} species of eusocial animal. They live together in large well-organized colonies that may be so tightly integrated and genetically similar that the colonies of some species are sometimes considered superorganisms. It is sometimes argued that the various species of honey bee are the only invertebrates (and indeed {{one of the few}} non-human groups) to have evolved a system of abstract symbolic communication where a behavior is used to represent and convey specific information about something in the environment. In this communication system, called dance language, the angle at which <b>a</b> <b>bee</b> dances represents a direction relative to the sun, and the length of the dance represents the distance to be flown. Though perhaps not as advanced as honey bees, bumblebees also potentially have some social communication behaviors. Bombus terrestris, for example, exhibit a faster learning curve for visiting unfamiliar, yet rewarding flowers, when they can see a conspecific foraging on the same species.|$|E
5|$|When {{a colony}} is dying, for {{whatever}} cause, and other healthy colonies are nearby (as is typical in <b>a</b> <b>bee</b> yard), those healthy colonies often enter the dying colony and rob its provisions {{for their own}} use. If the dying colony's provisions were contaminated (by natural or man-made toxins), the resulting pattern (of healthy colonies becoming sick when in proximity to a dying colony) might suggest to an observer that a contagious disease is involved. However, it is typical in CCD cases that provisions of dying colonies are not being robbed, suggesting that at least this particular mechanism (toxins being spread via robbing, thereby mimicking a disease) {{is not involved in}} CCD. Additional evidence that CCD is an infectious disease came from the following observations: the hives of colonies that had died from CCD could be reused with a healthy colony only if they were first treated with DNA-destroying radiation, and the CCD Working Group report in 2010 indicated that CCD-exhibiting hives tended to occur in proximity to one another within apiaries.|$|E
5|$|While English is a subject-prominent language, at the {{discourse}} level {{it tends to}} use a topic-comment structure, where the known information (topic) precedes the new information (comment). Because of the strict SVO syntax, the topic of a sentence generally {{has to be the}} grammatical subject of the sentence. In cases where the topic is not the grammatical subject of the sentence, frequently the topic is promoted to subject position through syntactic means. One way of doing this is through a passive construction, the girl was stung by the bee. Another way is through a cleft sentence where the main clause is demoted to be a complement clause of a copula sentence with a dummy subject such as it or there, e.g. it was the girl that the bee stung, there was a girl who was stung by <b>a</b> <b>bee.</b> Dummy subjects are also used in constructions where there is no grammatical subject such as with impersonal verbs (e.g., it is raining) or in existential clauses (there are many cars on the street). Through the use of these complex sentence constructions with informationally vacuous subjects, English is able to maintain both a topic-comment sentence structure and a SVO syntax.|$|E
