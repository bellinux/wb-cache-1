[...] Australia is a leading producer of wool which is mostly from Merino sheep but has been eclipsed by China in terms of total weight. [...] New Zealand (2016) is the third-largest producer of wool, and the largest producer of crossbred wool. Breeds such as Lincoln, Romney, Drysdale, and Elliotdale produce coarser fibers, and wool from these sheep is usually used for making carpets.|$|E
40|$|Good sleep {{promotes}} {{physical and}} psychological health. Clothing and bedding provide thermal insulation and can impact on thermal comfort and sleep. However, heat or cold exposure could disrupt sleep and alter sleep stages. Textile fabrics with different fibre characteristics have influences on thermal and moisture resistance. Therefore, this thesis explored {{the influence of the}} fabrics of cotton, polyester and wool on sleep. For study 1, the participants slept in cotton, polyester and wool singlets and shorts at 29 °C. Sleep onset latency (SOL), arousal index and wake after sleep onset were reduced in wool compared to the other fabrics. Study 2 explored the effects of sleeping <b>apparel</b> (cotton vs. <b>wool),</b> bedding (polyester vs. wool) and ambient temperature (Ta) (17 °C vs. 22 °C) on sleep. <b>Wool</b> <b>apparel</b> and lower Ta (17 C) were more conducive to sleep. At 17 C, sleeping in wool promoted an early sleep onset, increased stage 3 sleep but decreased stage 2 sleep compared to cotton apparel, whereas at 22 C sleeping in cotton promoted increase stage 3 sleep than in wool. However, no effects were observed for bedding types. The skin and core body temperature data supported findings in SOL at 17 C, but not findings in stage 3 sleep at 22 C. Concordance in sleep measures was assessed between polysomnography (the standard measurement), Actiwatch 2 and SenseWear armband (portable sleep measurements). The data showed similar validity for sleep detection by both devices, except that the SenseWear armband was dependent on Ta especially at 29 °C. Overall, the thesis findings showed that sleeping in <b>wool</b> <b>apparel</b> promoted sleep at 29 C when in singlets and shorts, and at 17 C when in long sleeves and pants. Sleeping in cotton apparel favoured sleep at 22 C. The findings were discussed with respect to the properties of fabric fibres in terms of air trapping and hygroscopicity.

40|$|The {{commercial}} value of unprocessed wool is determined by its intrinsic quality; an indication of capacity to meet both processor and consumer demands. Wool quality is evaluated through routine assessment of characteristics that include mean fibre diameter, coefficient of variation, staple characteristics, comfort factor, spinning fineness, fibre curvature and clean fleece yield. The association between these characteristics with wool quality stems from their correlation with raw wool processing performance in terms of speed, durability, ultimate use as <b>apparel</b> or carpet <b>wool,</b> and consumer satisfaction with the end-product. An evaluation of these characteristics allows wool quality to be objectively quantified prior to purchase and processing. The primary objective of this review was to define and explore these aforementioned key wool characteristics, focusing on their impact on quality, desirable parameters and methodology behind their quantification. An in-depth review of relevant published literature on these wool characteristics in sheep is presented. ...|$|R
50|$|Division of Animal Genetics and Breeding {{was started}} in 1966 under the name Sheep Genetic Section with a mandate to conduct {{research}} on improvement of indigenous breeds of sheep for wool and meat. It was renamed as Division of Animal Genetics and Breeding in 1975. Animal Genetics and Breeding Division carried out pioneer {{work in the field}} of crossbreeding for improving the production of mutton, carpet wool, <b>apparel</b> <b>wool</b> and pelt. Various crosses like Avikalin, Bharat Merino, Avimaans, Indian Karakul, Awassi X Malpura and Avivastra were developed at this division. Research was also carried out with indigenous goats (Marwari, Sirohi and Kutchi) to evolve milk and meat producing goats. The biochemical polymorphic studies were undertaken to study the inheritance of various blood constituents and to determine the possible association of these biochemical parameters with economic traits. Cytogenetic studies were initiated in 1982. In 1997, Garole, a prolific microsheep of West Bengal was introduced for increasing prolificacy of Malpura sheep. Marker Assisted Selection (MAS) for prolificacy has been practically used in the routine breeding programme. In 2008, Patanwadi inheritance was introduced into prolificacy project to improve the milk yield and mothering ability. Three breed prolific cross was produced in 2009 and strengthening of prolific flock is in progress. Recently study on understanding the genetic basis of immune response variability in sheep has been initiated. Stalwarts like Dr. M V Krishna Rao, Dr. O N Singh, Dr. R M Acharya, Dr. R Nagercenkar, Dr. A L Chaudhary, Dr. R N Singh, Dr. C L Arora, Dr. S D J Bohra, Dr. B U Khan, Dr. V K Singh and Dr. A L Arora had shaped the development and progress of this division.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the impact of}} changes in wool {{promotion}} expenditure and changes in expenditure on the promotion of competing fibres are examined using an equilibrium displacement model. The emphasis is on examining impacts on producer profits net of promotion expenditure and on benefit-cost ratios measuring changes in producer surplus relative to changes in promotion expenditure. It was found, for example, that incremental expenditure on <b>apparel</b> <b>wool</b> promotion on the domestic market is unprofitable but incremental expenditure on promotion of <b>apparel</b> <b>wool</b> on the export market is generally profitable. Further, {{it was found that}} increased promotion of cotton and man-made fibres on the export market, with promotion of <b>apparel</b> <b>wool</b> unchanged, would reduce profits to <b>apparel</b> <b>wool</b> producers. Finally, a case is made for improved data availability in order to allow more comprehensive ex-ante and ex-post evaluations of promotion programs, thereby increasing the intensity of scrutiny of promotion programs to a level more in line with that for investment in rural research and development.

40|$|Analysis of {{secondary}} {{data and information}} gathered from interviews with downstream wool supply chain members suggests that problems exist with the sourcing of raw wool for the apparel textile industry. Specific problems relate to `hard' attributes, such as contaminated fibres and fibre diameter, as well as `soft' attributes, such as origin of the wool {{and the nature of}} wool production systems. These problems may arise due to inadequate communication of quality attributes between chain members. The authors argue that more effective communication in the <b>apparel</b> <b>wool</b> supply chain requires the removal of `functional silos', where supply chain members fail to look outside (upstream and/or downstream) their specific sectoral interests, and the continued dominance of the auction as the primary marketing system. The authors conclude that the <b>apparel</b> <b>wool</b> industry needs to co-operate to compete in dynamic, global markets increasingly dominated by synthetic ®bres, in which vertically co-ordinated supply chains are the norm, auctions non-existent and communication is seen as a strength, rather than a weakness...|$|E
40|$|The global wool {{market has}} {{stabilized}} {{in recent years}} after a significant drop in the 1990 s and showing encouraging signs of increased demand for wool fibers. The international market is expected to benefit from current fashion trends and the high oil prices, which increase the price competitiveness of wool as compared to synthetics. Current fashion trends for worsted suits, soft and light tweeds, coupled with the increasing demand for blends with other synthetic fibers favor a greater demand for wool globally. The future prospect of the world wool market is heavily relied on China, the largest raw-wool importer and finished <b>wool</b> <b>apparel</b> exporter.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to develop and refine new yarn and knit textile combinations using Nuyarn technology for a selected niche market. New Zealand’s Nuyarn is an industryconnected project with Massey University and Levana Textiles. Levana Textiles is a woolen mill based in Levin with over 50 years industry experience. Through the exploration of trend forecasting, iterative design process, market research as well as finding a gap in the market, this result in unique New Zealand products that can demand a premium price. Nuyarn technology is a new and innovative way of spinning yarn. The technology enhances the yarn performance by taking the twist out, and instead it lays the fibres along the same orientation {{as the rest of the}} yarn. Levana Textiles have purchased Nuyarn spinning technology. Through the use of this technology, Levana is producing and introducing innovative and newly improved products into the textile market. This technology is paramount in setting them apart from other textile mills as well as bringing a point of difference in the market. There is a need to achieve smarter performance in blended yarns for circular knitwear <b>apparel.</b> The <b>wool</b> industry endured hard times in previous years due to the rise in demand for synthetic fibres in the 1960 s.

40|$|The United States {{occupies}} a rather unique {{position in the}} world wool trade - besides being one of the world's largest <b>apparel</b> <b>wool</b> producers, she also needs to supplement her requirements by sizeable imports from wool surplus countries. However, wool imports into the U. S. have a strong competitive advantage over domestic wools, not only price-wise but also on account of their uniformity and generally better preparation. For this reason the ability of the wool exporting countries to enlarge very substantially their markets in the U. S. by displacing some domestic wools is largely dependent on the American policy of sheltering and fostering the domestic wool industry. For decades, the traditional means of achieving this has been by levying specific tariff duties of varying height on fine apparel wools which proved to be a potential threat to finer Territory (i. e. domestic) grades. Non-competitive carpet wools, on the other hand, imported mainly from Argentina and Uruguay, have been exempt from duty. More recently, with the aim of stimulating wool production to a level compatible with the strategic raw material needs of the U. S., an incentive subsidy program administered by the U. S. Secretary of Agriculture has been superimposed on the existing tariff structure. It is {{the purpose of this paper}} to discuss the rationale of the new wool program against the background of the traditional American wool policy, and at a later stage, to explore its implications for American <b>apparel</b> <b>wool</b> imports in general and from Australia in particular.

40|$|AbstractAustralia is {{the largest}} {{supplier}} of fine <b>apparel</b> <b>wool</b> in the world, produced from diverse sheep production systems. To date, broad scale analyses of the environmental credentials of Australian wool have not used detailed farm-scale data, resulting in a knowledge gap regarding the performance of this product. This study is the first multiple impact life cycle assessment (LCA) investigation of three wool types, produced in three geographically defined regions of Australia: the high rainfall zone located in New South Wales (NSW HRZ) producing super-fine Merino wool, the Western Australian wheat-sheep zone (WA WSZ) producing fine Merino wool, and the southern pastoral zone (SA SPZ) of central South Australia, producing medium Merino wool. Inventory {{data were collected from}} both case study farms and regional datasets. Life cycle inventory and impact assessment methods were applied to determine resource use (energy and water use, and land occupation) and GHG emissions, including emissions and removal associated with land use (LU) and direct land use change (dLUC). Land occupation was divided into use of arable and non-arable land resources. A comparison of biophysical allocation and system expansion methods for handling co-production of greasy wool and live weight (for meat) was included. Based on the regional analysis results, GHG emissions (excluding LU and dLUC) were 20. 1  ±  3. 1 (WA WSZ, mean ±  2  S. D) to 21. 3  ±  3. 4  kg CO 2 -e/kg wool in the NSW HRZ, with no significant difference between regions or wool type. Accounting for LU and dLUC emissions and removals resulted in either very modest increases in emissions (0. 3 %) or reduced net emissions by 0 – 11 % depending on pasture management and revegetation activities, though a higher degree of uncertainty was observed in these results. Fossil fuel energy demand ranged from 12. 5  ±  4. 1 in the SA SPZ to 22. 5  ±  6. 2  MJ/kg wool (WA WSZ) in response to differences in grazing intensity. Fresh water consumption ranged from 204. 3  ±  59. 1 in the NSW HRZ to 393. 7  ±  123. 8  L/kg wool in the WA WSZ, with differences primarily relating to climate. Stress-weighted water use ranged from 11. 0  ±  3. 0 (SA SPZ) to 74. 6  ±  119. 5  L H 2 O-e/kg wool (NSW HRZ) and followed an opposite trend to water consumption in response to the different levels of water stress across the regions. Non-arable grazing land was found to range from 55 % to almost 100 % of total land occupation. Different methods for handling co-production of greasy wool and live weight changed estimated total GHG emissions by a factor of three, highlighting the sensitivity to this methodological choice and the significance of meat production in the wool supply chain. The results presented improve the understanding of environmental impacts and resource use in these wool production regions as a basis for more detailed full supply chain analysis...|$|E
