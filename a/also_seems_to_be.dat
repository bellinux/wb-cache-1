5|$|Before the 13th century, {{instances}} of Europeans going to China or of Chinese going to Europe are virtually unknown, {{with a few}} exceptions. Euthydemus I, Hellenistic ruler of the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom in Central Asia during the 3rd century BC, led an expedition into the Tarim Basin (modern Xinjiang, China) in search of precious metals. Greek influence as far east as the Tarim Basin at this time <b>also</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> confirmed by {{the discovery of the}} Sampul tapestry, a woolen wall hanging with the painting of a blue-eyed soldier, possibly a Greek, and a prancing centaur, a common Hellenistic motif from Greek mythology. However, it is known that other Indo-European peoples such as the Yuezhi, Saka, and Tocharians inhabited the Tarim Basin before and after it was brought under Han Chinese influence during the reign of Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141–87 BC). Lucas Christopoulos presents an argument that the influence of Hellenistic art in China stretches back to the Qin dynasty (221–206 BC), before the establishment of the Silk Road. Christopoulos contends that Hellenistic influences in Chinese art were undoubtedly introduced by the period of the Three Kingdoms (220–265) and the sudden influx of Greco-Buddhist art from the Kushan Empire in Central Asia. Yet ancient ceramics from sites at Khotan bear clear influence from the Hellenistic Kingdom of Ptolemaic Egypt, with styles non-existent in Kushan art. This has led Christopoulos to assume the presence of peoples not only from the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom but also Greeks, Saka, and Indian people from the Indo-Greek Kingdom based at Taxila (Pakistan).|$|E
25|$|Birth by {{caesarean}} section <b>also</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> associated with worse health outcomes later in life, including overweight or obesity and {{problems in the}} immune system.|$|E
25|$|Meritaten's {{title as}} chief queen {{alongside}} Akhenaten's name in Tutankhamun's tomb indicates she replaced Nefertiti as in that role. This <b>also</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> indicated by her designation as “mistress” {{of the royal}} house in Amarna Letter EA 11.|$|E
50|$|They <b>also</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> playful, {{and make}} Akira clean {{up most of}} their mess. They <b>also</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{extremely}} unskilled, or at least extremely unwilling to do housework, which makes Akira {{the only one to}} do all the cooking and cleaning.|$|R
50|$|There <b>also</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a Paloich Market and Palouge Power Plant.|$|R
5|$|The {{effects of}} miRNA dysregulation of gene {{expression}} <b>also</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> important in neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and autism spectrum disorders.|$|R
25|$|Terrance Zdunich as GraveRobber, a Zydrate peddler who obtains the {{insoluble}} chemical from corpses and has {{connections to}} Amber, both sexually {{and as a}} dealer. He <b>also</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Shilo's first and only friend and explains Zydrate and Mag's debt with GeneCo to her. Mysterious and charismatic, he acts as the narrator of the post-apocalyptic world.|$|E
25|$|There <b>also</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{a marked}} {{tendency}} to confuse different forms {{even when they}} have not become homophonous (like in the generally more distinct plurals), which indicates nominal declension was not only shaped by phonetic mergers, but also by structural factors. As {{a result of the}} untenability of the noun case system after these phonetic changes, Vulgar Latin shifted from a markedly synthetic language to a more analytic one.|$|E
25|$|In his stories, Roger Zelazny {{frequently}} portrayed {{characters from}} myth, {{depicted in the}} modern world. Zelazny included many anachronisms, such as cigarette-smoking (see below) and references to modern drama, in his work. His crisp, minimalistic dialogue <b>also</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> somewhat influenced by the style of wisecracking hardboiled crime authors, such as Raymond Chandler or Dashiell Hammett. The tension between the ancient and the modern, surreal and familiar was what drove most of his work.|$|E
50|$|Some of {{the brain}} {{components}} which have <b>been</b> proposed <b>to</b> play a role are the mitochondria and a sodium ATPase pump. Circadian rhythms and melatonin activity <b>also</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> altered.|$|R

25|$|While {{the main}} intent of DRM {{is to prevent}} {{unauthorized}} copies of a product, there are mathematical models that suggest that DRM schemes can fail {{to do their job}} on multiple levels. Ironically, the biggest failure that can result from DRM is that they have a potential to increase the infringement rate of a product. This goes against the held belief that DRM can always reduce unauthorized distribution. There <b>also</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> evidence that DRM will reduce profits.|$|E
25|$|Topoxte Island had a {{surge in}} {{construction}} activity in the Postclassic suggesting a population influx at this time, in parallel to an equivalent influx into the area of Lake Petén Itzá region {{in response to the}} collapse of Chichen Itza in the north of the Yucatán Peninsula. The ceremonial architecture at Topoxte includes two major periods of construction in the Late Postclassic and closely reflects that at Zacpeten, another Kowoj site, and <b>also</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> linked to activity at Mayapan.|$|E
25|$|The {{final stage}} in {{the life cycle of}} a virus is the release of {{completed}} viruses from the host cell, and this step has also been targeted by antiviral drug developers. Two drugs named zanamivir (Relenza) and oseltamivir (Tamiflu) that have been recently introduced to treat influenza prevent the release of viral particles by blocking a molecule named neuraminidase that is found on the surface of flu viruses, and <b>also</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> constant across a wide range of flu strains.|$|E
50|$|The {{village was}} mined for marble {{and there is}} {{evidence}} of vineyards. The variants of olives currently grown in the area <b>also</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> of Italian varieties grown for the purpose of olive oil.|$|R
50|$|Baron Blitzkrieg - Baron Reiter, {{also known}} as the Chief of Shadows; this <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> his title in the organization. Not only was he the head of Shadowspire but he <b>also</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> allied with the Symbolix Corporation (Damage #1).|$|R
25|$|Since {{a number}} of Jewish {{scholars}} have stated that the deadline {{for the arrival of}} the Jewish Messiah is the Jewish Year 6000 (2240 CE), this would <b>also</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a deadline for beginning the construction of the Third Temple.|$|R
25|$|While on the {{one hand}} this tale tells a tribal family-relations story, and family/tribal history as well, it <b>also</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a parable of a typical weather pattern of a southwesterly wind at first {{bringing}} snow, then rain, and also of the melting of a glacier, namely the Place Glacier near Gates Lake at Birken. Thus, it also tells of a migration of people to the area – or a war, depending on how the details of the legend might be read, with Chinook-Wind taking the part of Helen in a First Nations parallel to the Trojan War.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} of the Content of Virgil’s writing, the {{tradition}} of allegorizing Virgil was not new. Aelius Donatus had already completed an allegorical exposition of passages of the Aeneid which closely resembles Fulgentius’s ideas, indicating that they were probably not unique to Fulgentius. Furthermore, Fulgentius appears to have taken the idea of Virgil as a sage from the earlier writer Macrobius. However, it seems Fulgentius was original in his attempt to systematically interpret the entire Aeneid. He <b>also</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the first to attempt to explain the text in a way at least partly acceptable to Christian readers.|$|E
25|$|Two {{other major}} subfields of {{psycholinguistics}} investigate first language acquisition, {{the process by}} which infants acquire language, and second language acquisition. In addition, it is much more difficult for adults to acquire second languages than it is for infants to learn their first language (bilingual infants are able to learn both of their native languages easily). Thus, sensitive periods may exist during which language can be learned readily. A great deal of research in psycholinguistics focuses on how this ability develops and diminishes over time. It <b>also</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the case that the more languages one knows, the easier it is to learn more.|$|E
30|$|The {{effects of}} {{red blood cell}} transfusions <b>also</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> quite variable. In one trial, {{although}} the effects in the entire population were negligible, transfusions did improve microvascular perfusion in patients with the most severely altered microcirculation at baseline [30].|$|R
50|$|Confabulation is {{distinguished}} from lying as there <b>is</b> no intent <b>to</b> deceive {{and the person}} is unaware the information is false. Although individuals can present blatantly false information, confabulation can <b>also</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> coherent, internally consistent, and relatively normal.|$|R
50|$|Since {{a number}} of Jewish {{scholars}} have stated that the deadline {{for the arrival of}} the Jewish Messiah is the Jewish Year 6000 (2240 CE), this would <b>also</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a deadline for beginning the construction of the Third Temple.|$|R
25|$|The team {{then began}} to compare the {{performance}} and ease-of-use of the helical vs. spiral scanners, with the GEC helical system being mounted in V6000. After extensive tests by George Edwards and O'Kane of GEC they had made no firm conclusions which system was better. Further work on these systems ended as the pressure to install the Mk. VII units, now improving in quantity, became pressing. This <b>also</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the reason that US versions, known as the SCR-520, were largely ignored after having been developed with extreme speed over the winter. Bowen, who had returned from the US by this point, notes the confusion during the rush to install.|$|E
25|$|Goblin Island {{became the}} first in the {{so-called}} Scottish Sequence of six titles, four of which are set largely in Scotland: Goblin Island itself, set on 'Loch Avie', a fictionalised Loch Lomond; Princess in Tatters, set on 'Loch Ruel', which may be Loch Fyne; A Holiday Queen, set at 'Morven' on what appears to be Loch Long; and Schoolgirls and Scouts set at 'Glenleny', which <b>also</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> on Loch Long, but a bit further up the loch. Of the other two in the series, Twins of Castle Charming - perhaps Oxenham's rarest title - is set largely in Switzerland, whereas Finding Her Family has some early scenes set in Ealing and mainly takes place in Saltburn.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the next}} eight months since Cyclops' death, Emma started to train and {{improving}} her time to turn into her diamond form. She <b>also</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> traumatized from the death of Scott and began to actually believe her own lie that Black Bolt {{was the one who}} actually killed him. Emma wasted no time and began to prepare for a war with the Inhumans by making alliances with various teams of X-Men, with the last being Storm's X-Haven. She declares war on the Inhumans when Beast reports that the Terrigen cloud will soon saturate and render earth as completely uninhabitable for mutants, believing that they have no time to attempt negotiation. When Medusa learns the truth about why the X-Men went to war against the Inhumans, she willingly destroys the cloud and ends the possibility of future Inhuman manifestations so that the mutants can survive.|$|E

50|$|In May 2008, in {{the wake}} of British-Russian tension, Sedov was {{instructed}} by Moscow not to dock as planned at Southend-on-Sea. The September 2008 visit to Falmouth, the starting point of FUNCHAL 500 race <b>to</b> Madeira, <b>also</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in jeopardy.|$|R
25|$|It is {{not known}} how or when the trace is placed upon a child, {{though it may be}} assumed that it begins either when the child begins to show magical talent or when they first go through the barrier to Platform 9¾. The Ministry {{seemingly}} ignores the trace during the school year as students at Hogwarts are expected to perform magic and are under the supervision of teachers. This 'blind eye' <b>also</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> extended to places such as Diagon Alley, Platform 9¾, the Hogwarts Express and the village of Hogsmeade (the only settlement in Britain inhabited solely by wizards and other magical beings) which is located close to Hogwarts and which 3rd year students and above can visit on weekends provided they have a signed permission slip from their parent or guardian. The Ministry also seems to {{turn a blind eye to}} the use magic in the muggle-world when the child is under the age of 11 as their powers have generally not been developed enough to cause a problem, with a number of witches and wizards, including Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, Lily Evans and Severus Snape all known to have performed some under-age magic while growing up in the muggle-world that went unpunished.|$|E
500|$|... "Stephen" [...] {{received}} positive {{comments from}} music critics. Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music used [...] "Stephen" [...] {{as an example}} of the songs on Animal that exemplified the singer's vocals, saying it had [...] "beautiful layered a cappella harmonies. Sure, it tumbles into clunky pop straight afterwards, but then, that <b>also</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> what she does: beautiful things are bashed against ugly things, pretty melodies ruined by silly noises, emotional lyrics stuffed with buzzwords." [...] Daniel Brockman of The Boston Phoenix wrote of the album that [...] "in a post–'Birthday Sex' pop landscape, there's plenty of room for dumb if it's done well." [...] He described [...] "Stephen" [...] as [...] "an ode to forcing your sexual advances on your high-school history teacher." [...] Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times listed the song as one of those that exemplified the album's more experimental side, calling it a [...] "country-in-space" [...] rendition.|$|E
500|$|The {{time span}} and {{geographic}} range of Edmontosaurus overlapped with Tyrannosaurus, and an adult specimen of E. annectens {{on display in}} the Denver Museum of Nature and Science shows evidence of a theropod bite in the tail. Counting back from the hip, the thirteenth to seventeenth vertebrae have damaged spines consistent with an attack from the right rear of the animal. One spine has a portion sheared away, and the others are kinked; three have apparent tooth puncture marks. The top of the tail was at least [...] high, and the only theropod species known from the same rock formation that was tall enough to make such an attack is T. rex. The bones are partially healed, but the edmontosaur died before the traces of damage were completely obliterated. The damage also shows signs of bone infection. Kenneth Carpenter, who studied the specimen, noted that there <b>also</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a healed fracture in the left hip which predated the attack because it was more fully healed. He suggested that the edmontosaur was a target because it may have been limping from this earlier injury. Because it survived the attack, Carpenter suggested that it may have outmaneuvered or outrun its attacker, or that the damage to its tail was incurred by the hadrosaurid using it as a weapon against the tyrannosaur.|$|E
50|$|Similar {{shifts from}} the heroic to the villainous side, doubts about {{controlling}} others, urge to self-sacrifice or suddenly shift {{sides to the}} good, all appear in Saturn Queen stories. Rehabilitation, regret, redemption, restorative justice and nurturing/training heroes <b>also</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> explored therein.|$|R
50|$|By the 13th century, the {{wheelbarrow}} proved useful in building construction, mining operations, and agriculture. However, going by surviving documents and illustrations {{the wheelbarrow}} remained a relative rarity until the 15th century. It <b>also</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> limited <b>to</b> England, France, and the Low Countries.|$|R
