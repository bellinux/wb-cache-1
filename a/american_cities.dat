5|$|Even {{with these}} efforts, {{fundraising}} lagged. Grover Cleveland, {{the governor of}} New York, vetoed a bill to provide $50,000 for the statue project in 1884. An attempt the next year to have Congress provide $100,000, sufficient to complete the project, also failed. The New York committee, with only $3,000 in the bank, suspended work on the pedestal. With the project in jeopardy, groups from other <b>American</b> <b>cities,</b> including Boston and Philadelphia, offered to pay {{the full cost of}} erecting the statue in return for relocating it.|$|E
5|$|Hardcore punk was the {{response}} of American youths to the worldwide punk rock explosion of the late 1970s. Hardcore stripped punk rock and New Wave of its sometimes elitist and artsy tendencies, resulting in short, fast, and intense songs that spoke to disaffected youth. Hardcore exploded in the American metropolises of Los Angeles, Washington, DC, New York and Boston and most <b>American</b> <b>cities</b> had their own local scenes {{by the end of}} the 1980s.|$|E

5|$|Many {{bird species}} have {{established}} breeding populations in areas {{to which they}} have been introduced by humans. Some of these introductions have been deliberate; the ring-necked pheasant, for example, has been introduced around the world as a game bird. Others have been accidental, such as the establishment of wild monk parakeets in several North <b>American</b> <b>cities</b> after their escape from captivity. Some species, including cattle egret, yellow-headed caracara and galah, have spread naturally far beyond their original ranges as agricultural practices created suitable new habitat.|$|E

5|$|Starting in {{the early}} 1990s, St. Louis became home to a {{substantial}} Bosnian immigrant community, which became the second-largest in the United States in 1999. The city also began to see an increase in immigrants from Mexico, Vietnam, Ethiopia, and Somalia. Many immigrants reported moving to St. Louis, particularly its south side Bevo Mill neighborhood, due to the low cost of living compared to other <b>American</b> <b>cities.</b> Despite this increase, the foreign-born population of the St. Louis region was roughly one-third of the national average in 2010.|$|E

In 1969, after a sojourn in Liberia, Ben Ammi and about 30 Hebrew Israelites moved to Israel. Over the next 20 years, nearly 600 more members left the United States for Israel. As of 2006, about 2,500 Hebrew Israelites live in Dimona and two other towns in the Negev region of Israel, where they are widely referred to as Black Hebrews. In addition, there are Hebrew Israelite communities in several major <b>American</b> <b>cities,</b> including Chicago, St. Louis, and Washington, D.C.|$|E
5|$|Gay men {{and lesbians}} came {{together}} to work in grassroots political organizations responding to organized resistance in 1977. A coalition of conservatives named Save Our Children staged a campaign to repeal a civil rights ordinance in Dade County, Florida. Save Our Children was successful enough to influence similar repeals in several <b>American</b> <b>cities</b> in 1978. However, the same year a campaign in California called the Briggs Initiative, designed to force the dismissal of homosexual public school employees, was defeated. Reaction {{to the influence of}} Save Our Children and the Briggs Initiative in the gay community was so significant that it has been called the second Stonewall for many activists, marking their initiation into political participation.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, the Environmental Working Group {{studied the}} {{drinking}} water in 35 <b>American</b> <b>cities</b> in the first nationwide study.

Concentrations of Cr(VI) in US municipal drinking water supplies reported by EWG are within likely, natural background levels for the areas tested and not necessarily indicative of industrial pollution, as asserted by EWG. This factor was not taken into consideration in the EWG report.|$|E
