5|$|Champollion married Rosine Blanc (17941871) in 1818 {{after four}} years of engagement, they had one {{daughter}}, Zoraïde Chéronnet-Champollion (182489). Rosine was the daughter of a well-to-do family of Grenoblean glovemakers. At first her father did not <b>approve</b> <b>of</b> the match, since Champollion was a mere assistant professor when they first met, but with his increasing reputation he eventually agreed. Originally Jacques-Joseph did not <b>approve</b> <b>of</b> his brother's marriage either, finding Rosine too dull-witted, and he did not attend the wedding, but later he grew fond of his sister in-law. Although a happy family man, especially adoring his daughter, Champollion was frequently away from his family for months or even years at a time, while traveling to Paris, to Italy, and to Egypt. While in Livorno, Champollion developed an infatuation with an Italian poet, Angelica Palli. She presented an ode to Champollion's work at a celebration in his honor, and the two exchanged letters for a while, but an affair never developed.|$|E

5|$|Dark Magus was {{released}} after Davis' 1975 retirement, upon which his label, Columbia Records, issued several albums of various outtakes. After issuing the live recordings Agharta (1975) and Pangaea (1976), Columbia {{decided that they}} did not <b>approve</b> <b>of</b> the albums, and Dark Magus {{was released}} only in Japan, in 1977 by CBS-Sony. The label's A executive Tatsu Nosaki suggested the album's title, which referred to the Magus from the Zoroastrian religion.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} as {{archbishop}} there was a dispute with the monks of Christ Church Priory in Canterbury, who resented Baldwin's attempts to impose stricter control over them and disputed the legitimacy of Baldwin's election.

His father did not <b>approve</b> <b>of</b> his interest but regardless, Kippenberger enlisted in the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) in late 1915 {{at the age of}} 18. Because only men between the ages of 19 and 45 were required to register for service, he falsified his age to ensure that he would be eligible for duty overseas.|$|E

He had {{originally}} asked to wear the number when he first joined the Canucks, but was not permitted to do so by head coach Pat Quinn, who did not <b>approve</b> <b>of</b> high jersey numbers. After the Canucks traded with the Buffalo Sabres for Alexander Mogilny, reuniting the two Russian players, the jersey number was deemed acceptable because Mogilny had used number 89 since defecting to North America in 1989.|$|E

25|$|Historically, interracial {{marriage}} in the United States was of great public opposition (often a taboo), especially among whites. According to opinion polls, by 1986 only one third <b>of</b> Americans <b>approved</b> <b>of</b> interracial {{marriage in}} general. In 2011, the vast majority <b>of</b> Americans <b>approved</b> <b>of</b> the marriages between different races in general, while just 20 years ago in 1991 less than half approved. It was only in 1994 when more than half <b>of</b> Americans <b>approved</b> <b>of</b> such marriages in general.

Proposals include: limiting {{the use of the}} veto to vital national security issues; requiring agreement from multiple states before exercising the veto; abolishing the veto entirely; and embarking on the transition stipulated in Article 106 of the Charter, which requires the consensus principle to stay in place. Any reform of the veto will be very difficult. Articles 108 and 109 of the United Nations Charter grant the P5 veto over any amendments to the Charter, requiring them to <b>approve</b> <b>of</b> any modifications to the UNSC veto power that they themselves hold.|$|E

He brought his own food to the Berghof, claiming it was biologically dynamic, but Hitler did not <b>approve</b> <b>of</b> this practice, so he discontinued taking meals with the Führer.|$|E

The two were married on 9 July 1735, at St. Werburgh's Church in Derby. The Porter family did not <b>approve</b> <b>of</b> the match, partly because Johnson was 25 and Elizabeth was 21 years his elder. His mother's marriage to Johnson so disgusted her son Jervis that he stopped talking to her. Her other son Joseph later accepted the marriage, and her daughter, Lucy, accepted Johnson from the start.|$|E
