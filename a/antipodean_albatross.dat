5|$|Based on {{the work}} on {{albatross}} genera, Robertson and Nunn went on in 1998 to propose a revised taxonomy with 24 different species, compared to the 14 then accepted. This expanded taxonomy elevated many established subspecies to full species, but was criticised for not using, in every case, peer reviewed information to justify the splits. Since then, further studies have in some instances supported or disproved the splits; a 2004 paper analysing the mitochondrial DNA and microsatellites agreed with {{the conclusion that the}} <b>Antipodean</b> <b>albatross</b> and the Tristan albatross were distinct from the wandering albatross, per Robertson and Nunn, but found that the suggested Gibson's albatross, Diomedea gibsoni, was not distinct from the <b>Antipodean</b> <b>albatross.</b> For the most part, an interim taxonomy of 21 species is accepted by ITIS and many other researchers, though by no means all—in 2004 Penhallurick and Wink called for the number of species to be reduced to 13 (including the lumping of the Amsterdam albatross with the wandering albatross), although this paper was itself controversial. On all sides is the widespread agreement on the need for further research to clarify the issue.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} with the Arctic tundra, the Antarctic tundra lacks a large mammal fauna, mostly due to its physical isolation from the other continents. Sea mammals and sea birds, including seals and penguins, inhabit areas near the shore, and some small mammals, like rabbits and cats, have been introduced by humans {{to some of the}} subantarctic islands. The Antipodes Subantarctic Islands tundra ecoregion includes the Bounty Islands, Auckland Islands, Antipodes Islands, the Campbell Island group, and Macquarie Island. Species endemic to this ecoregion include Nematoceras dienemum and Nematoceras sulcatum, the only subantarctic orchids; the royal penguin; and the <b>Antipodean</b> <b>albatross.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>Antipodean</b> <b>{{albatross}}</b> (Diomedea antipodensis) {{is a large}} seabird in the albatross family. Antipodean albatrosses {{are smaller}} than wandering albatrosses, and breed in predominantly brown plumage, but are otherwise difficult to distinguish from wanderers.|$|E
50|$|At sea <b>Antipodean</b> <b>albatrosses</b> range {{across the}} South Pacific from Australia to {{as far as}} Chile, from the Tropic of Capricorn south. The gibsonii seems to range {{to the east of}} Auckland Island, and the {{nominate}} race ranges to the east to Chile. They breed on the Auckland Islands, Antipodes Islands, and Campbell Island.|$|R
40|$|Cephalopods play an {{important}} ecological role in the Southern Ocean, being the main prey group of numerous top predators. However, their basic ecology and biogeography is still poorly known, particularly in the lightly sampled Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean. We collected and analysed information on cephalopods in that area, using Antipodean and Gibson’s wandering albatrosses (Diomedea antipodensis antipodensis and D. antipodensis gibsoni, respectively) breeding at Antipodes Islands and Auckland Islands, respectively, in the New Zealand subantarctic islands as samplers, as they are known from tracking studies to cover huge areas of the Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean (<b>Antipodean</b> wandering <b>albatrosses</b> mostly forage east of New Zealand, whereas Gibson’s wandering albatrosses forage west of New Zealand). A total of 9111 cephalopod beaks, from 41 cephalopod taxa, were identified from boluses (voluntarily regurgitated items by chicks). The families Histioteuthidae (e. g. Histioteuthis atlantica) and Onychoteuthidae (e. g. Moroteuthis robsoni) {{were the most important}} cephalopods numerically and by reconstructed mass, respectively, in both wandering albatross species. Combining this information with previously gathered data on cephalopods in the Atlantic and Indian sectors of the Southern Ocean, we provide evidence from predators of the circumpolar distribution of numerous key cephalopod species in the Southern Ocean, and provide new information on poorly known cephalopods (i. e. relevance in the diet of wandering albatrosses, sizes consumed, biodiversity in the South Pacific, assemblages according to predator breeding sites) {{in one of the most}} remote ocean areas in the planet...|$|R
50|$|To {{authorities}} who accept the split of the <b>Antipodean</b> <b>albatross</b> from the wandering albatross, Gibson's is a subspecies of the Antipodean. To authorities not accepting the split, Gibson's is a subspecies of the Wandering. It is also sometimes considered a full species, Diomedea gibonsi, and the term wandering albatross is sometimes considered a species complex {{which includes the}} species D. gibonsi.|$|E

50|$|The Amsterdam {{albatross}} or Amsterdam Island albatross, Diomedea amsterdamensis, {{is a huge}} albatross which breeds only on Amsterdam Island in {{the southern}} Indian Ocean. It was only described in 1983, and was thought by some researchers to be a sub-species of the wandering albatross, D. exulans. BirdLife International and the IOC recognize it as a species, James Clements does not, and the SACC has a proposal {{on the table to}} split the species. More recently, mitchondrial DNA comparisons between the Amsterdam albatross, the wandering albatross Diomedea exulans, the <b>Antipodean</b> <b>albatross</b> D. antipodensis and the Tristan albatross D. dabbenena, provide clear genetic evidence that the Amsterdam albatross is a separate species.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are also}} {{large numbers of}} {{breeding}} penguins and other seabirds, including {{almost half of the}} world's species of albatross, especially the world's only breeding colonies of the <b>Antipodean</b> <b>albatross</b> (Diomedea exulans antipodensis), southern royal albatross (Diomedea epomophora epomophora), Campbell albatross (Thalassarche impavida), white-capped albatross (Thalassarche steadi), and Salvin's albatross (Thalassarche salvini). The large colonies of Salvin's albatross on the Bounty Islands build nests of feathers as there is no vegetation to use. There are also isolated populations of land birds that have presumably settled here, having been blown off course by ocean winds. Many of these have since evolved into unique species, including two endemic parakeets on Antipodes Island; the Antipodes parakeet (Cyanoramphus unicolor) and Reischek's parakeet (Cyanoramphus hochstetteri).|$|E
50|$|The <b>Antipodean</b> <b>albatross</b> {{belongs to}} the order Procellariiformes. Like all members of this order, they have naricorns, tubular nasal {{passages}} on their bill. They also have a unique palate with seven to nine bony plates. One of the great albatrosses of the genus Diomedea, it was only distinguished as a subspecies of the wandering albatross in 1992 and recognised by some authorities as a full species in 1998. While not all scientists believe it is a full species, retaining it with the wandering albatross, a 2004 study of the mitochondrial DNA and microsatellites of the wandering albatross species complex supported the split. Among the major experts, BirdLife International has split this species, Jim Clements has not yet, and the SACC has a proposal {{on the table to}} split it.|$|E
5000|$|Similar in {{appearance}} to the wandering albatross, adult birds have {{white on the}} back, extending along the upper surface of the wings near the body. The white plumage {{of the head and}} body has fine grey barring. The upper wing has a black trailing edge, with black flight feathers and with mottled white patches on the black primary coverts. The underwing is white with a dark trailing edge. The tail is white with black edges, except in older males in which it may be completely white. The bill is pale pink. Females are slightly duller and smaller than males. [...] The taxon is generally paler than the nominate subspecies of <b>Antipodean</b> <b>albatross,</b> D. a [...]antipodensis, which breeds mainly in the Antipodes Islands. [...] Adult males have a mean weight of 6.8 kg and females of 5.8 kg.|$|E
50|$|The {{wandering}} albatross, snowy albatross, white-winged albatross or goonie (Diomedea exulans) {{is a large}} seabird {{from the}} family Diomedeidae, which has a circumpolar range in the Southern Ocean. It was the first species of albatross to be described, and was long considered the same species as the Tristan albatross and the <b>Antipodean</b> <b>albatross.</b> A few authors still consider them all subspecies of the same species. The SACC has a proposal {{on the table to}} split this species, and BirdLife International has already split it. Together with the Amsterdam albatross, it forms the wandering albatross species complex. The wandering albatross is one of the two largest members of the genus Diomedea (the great albatrosses), being similar in size to the southern royal albatross. It {{is one of the largest}} birds in the world, and one of the best known and studied species of bird in the world. This is also one of the most far ranging birds. Some individual wandering albatrosses are known to circumnavigate the Southern Ocean three times (covering more than 120,000 km or 75,000 miles) in one year.|$|E
50|$|Antarctic tundra {{occurs on}} Antarctica and on several Antarctic and subantarctic islands, {{including}} South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands and the Kerguelen Islands. Most of Antarctica is too cold and dry to support vegetation, {{and most of}} the continent is covered by ice fields. However, some portions of the continent, particularly the Antarctic Peninsula, have areas of rocky soil that support plant life. The flora presently consists of around 300-400 lichens, 100 mosses, 25 liverworts, and around 700 terrestrial and aquatic algae species, which live on the areas of exposed rock and soil around the shore of the continent. Antarctica's two flowering plant species, the Antarctic hair grass (Deschampsia antarctica) and Antarctic pearlwort (Colobanthus quitensis), are found on the northern and western parts of the Antarctic Peninsula.In contrast with the Arctic tundra, the Antarctic tundra lacks a large mammal fauna, mostly due to its physical isolation from the other continents. Sea mammals and sea birds, including seals and penguins, inhabit areas near the shore, and some small mammals, like rabbits and cats, have been introduced by humans to some of the subantarctic islands. The Antipodes Subantarctic Islands tundra ecoregion includes the Bounty Islands, Auckland Islands, Antipodes Islands, the Campbell Island group, and Macquarie Island. Species endemic to this ecoregion include Nematoceras dienemum and Nematoceras sulcatum, the only subantarctic orchids; the royal penguin; and the <b>Antipodean</b> <b>albatross.</b>|$|E
