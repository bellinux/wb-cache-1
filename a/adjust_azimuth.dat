40|$|The {{different}} {{space of}} joint BTS would potentially create interference which could interfere the performance quality of an operator. Isolation denoted a value from each antenna which had common value of 30 dB. This minimum spacing calculation was used according to space isolation calculation. In case of frequency of 1710 up to 2170 Mhz, it was obtained that the minimum vertical spacing was 0. 15 up to 0. 19 meter, for frequency of 1710 up to 2170 Mhz, it was obtained that the minimum horizontal spacing was 0. 63 up to 0. 82 meter, for slant spacing obtained with isolation value was 71. 436 dB. Spacing installation at BTS PAL 5 Jln Husin Hamsah, RT/RW 005 / 001, Kelurahan Paal Lima, Kecamatan Pontianak Barat was 4. 5 meter for vertical spacing, 2 meter for horizontal spacing, and 71. 436 dB {{which was more}} than 30 dB for slant isolation. Thus, the result obtained in the field showed antenna spacing at BTS PAL 5 Barat had met the standard for antenna isolation. Antenna with isolation value of < 30 dB had to be adjusted toward installed antenna; extent spacing between one antenna to the others; adjust tilt of antenna {{in order to increase}} isolation value of antenna; <b>adjust</b> <b>azimuth</b> angle by getting it away from antenna that had been interfered so that the isolation value of the antenna met the standard. The receiving level of MS also had {{to be taken into account}} to measure the power of receiving signal of each MS from installed antenna, with Walfish-Ikegami method, it was obtained that the value of receiving power decreased upon spacing of 1 km from antenna, so that there should be certain adjustments toward the height of the antenna...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} {{photograph}} dim celestial objects, long exposures {{on the order}} of minutes or hours are required. To perform this process successfully the mount needs rotate to compensate for the earth’s rotation. To achieve this, the mount’s rotational axis must be critically aligned parallel to the earth’s rotational axis. This process is known as polar axis alignment. Two primary questions are answered in this article relative to polar axis alignment. First, “How can I determine my polar alignment error?”, and second, “What is the required tolerance for alignment error for a given imaging session?” Drift Alignment Overview Before we examine the details of polar axis alignment it is beneficial to review the drift alignment method. Drift alignment is a very popular method for polar alignment of equatorial mounts particularly when very high accuracy is needed. The method requires that the scope point at a carefully selected reference star. If the star drifts in declination it indicates misalignment in the mount’s rotational axis. Here is how the procedure works. To measure and <b>adjust</b> the <b>azimuth</b> axis, monitor a star near the intersection of the celestial equator and the meridian.

The GN&C system for V2 provided many innovations and was the most sophisticated military weapon in 1942 using self-contained closed loop guidance. Early V2s leveraged 2 gyroscopes and lateral accelerometer with a simple analog computer to <b>adjust</b> the <b>azimuth</b> for the rocket in flight.

40|$|Abstract: One of {{the most}} popular methods for polar {{alignment}} is the drift alignment method. In this paper the drift method is examined in detail. It is shown that the declination drift can be used to calculate the polar axis alignment error. Alternative methods for measuring declination drift and alignment error are also given. The Drift Alignment Method The drift alignment method is {{based on the fact that}} carefully selected stars tend to drift in declination over time if the mount is not properly aligned. Here is how the procedure works. To measure and <b>adjust</b> the <b>azimuth</b> axis, monitor a star near the intersection of the celestial equator and the meridian (an hour angle of 0 hours). If the star drifts north the mount is pointing too far west. A southern drift indicates the mount is pointing too far east. Likewise, to measure and adjust the altitude axis, monitor a star in the east (an hour angle of – 6 hours) near the celestial equator. If the star drifts north the mount is pointing too high. A southern drift indicates the mount is pointing too low. In each case the rate of drift is indicative of the magnitude of the error and the adjustment required for correction. Note that the drift direction should be reversed in the Southern Hemisphere or if an altitude reference star is selected in the west (an hour angle of...|$|R
30|$|The core was not oriented, and {{absolute}} paleomagnetic declinations therefore {{could not be}} derived directly from the measured ChRMs. To obtain the declinations of the ChRMs, we reconstructed the core orientation via the following process. First, we calculated the dip azimuth of the foliation plane, which was deduced from the AMS in each core segment where {{the continuity of the}} cores was confirmed. We then <b>adjusted</b> the dip <b>azimuth</b> to the north direction. Using this process, we connected core segments between depths of 80 and 50  m. However, significantly different declinations of ChRMs were observed at three depth intervals: 79.78 to 76.59  m, 73.71 to 72.05  m, and 51.48 to 51.17  m (intervals are indicated by the gray bars in Fig.  6 b). We then readjusted the azimuth directions at the three intervals to minimize the differences in the declinations between the three intervals and other depths. Next, the dip azimuth observed in the core was adjusted to the dip azimuth of the bedding plane observed around the core site (strike and dip: N 63 ° W and 12 ° NE), and the tilt was then corrected. Finally, the mean declination of the normal polarity (below 67.05  m) was adjusted to 0 °.|$|R

We hope to aid athletes in receiving drills within their respective sports and increase practice efficiency. In order to achieve this, the machine has one major axis of rotation driven by a motor. This enables it to adjust where the ball is being thrown. Using an Arduino Uno coupled with a Roboteq AX 1500 motor driver, the Automated Precision Passing System is able to throw a ball to a specified point in space by <b>adjusting</b> both the <b>azimuth</b> and ball-throwing motor speed. Our testing shows that our prototype has the ability to position itself in three different orientations as well as adjust the launch motor speed, but we were unable to launch the ball the original distance that we desired.

In order to continue the project and create a functional consumer product there are several improvements that need to be made to the system. The Automated Precision Passing System needs to be more rigid, have more power, and include more throwing positions...|$|R

40|$|The country, Colombia, resides at the {{northwest}} corner of the South America with seismicity and volcanism due to the intersections of the Nazca, South America and Caribbean tectonic plates (Figure 1). The boundaries of the South America plate, on which Colombia lies, borders between 60 to 200 kilometers from its coasts. A dense spot of seismicity known as the Bucaramanga Nest has had many theories to explain its existence. Two tectonic microplates suspected in this region have not been well understood. With many mysteries of the behavior of the tectonic plates beneath Colombia, using new methods may shed light on some of these controversies. ^ We need to generate models of the crust and mantle to examine these plates. To make that model, we can calculate 1 -D joint inversion models that combine receiver functions and surface wave dispersion tomography which will be useful in this application due to their complementary ability to study velocities. A new method to calculate receiver functions by <b>adjusting</b> back <b>azimuth</b> rotations will be used. ^ Not many 3 -D models that can be directly compared to our data so asserting the correctness of the geologic analysis would be difficult. Other studies of Colombia have focused on this region in much different scales and areas without much exactness on their depths and locales. Using our data sets and techniques, we believe our data to have some consistencies with recent and past models of Colombia. Notable features we found in this research that can be comparable to others would be the presence of plates in the upper mantle at appropriate depths. ^ We believed to have seen the major plates beneath the North Andes plate. At about 60 km depth across the North Andes – South America plate boundary, we see a very shallow subduction that continues for a few hundred kilometers. We believe to have seen the deep slabs that are causing the Bucaramanga Nest seismicity that had been studied in Zarifi et Al (2007). The Nazca plate can be below at our western stations. Along the subduction zone of the Caribbean plate beneath the North Andes plate, we saw steep subduction. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of sensing devices {{is one of}} the instrumentation fields that has grown rapidly in the last decade. Corresponding to the swift advance in the {{development of}} microelectronic sensors, optical fibre sensors are widely investigated because of their advantageous properties over the electronics sensors such as their wavelength multiplexing capability and high sensitivity to temperature, pressure, strain, vibration and acoustic emission. Moreover, optical fibre sensors are more attractive than the electronics sensors as they can perform distributed sensing, in terms of covering a reasonably large area using a single piece of fibre. Apart from being a responsive element in the sensing field, optical fibre possesses good assets in generating, distributing, processing and transmitting signals in the future broadband information network. These assets include wide bandwidth, high capacity and low loss that grant mobility and flexibility for wireless access systems. Among these core technologies, the fibre optic signal processing and transmission of optical and radio frequency signals have been the subjects of study in this thesis. Based on the intrinsic properties of single-mode optical fibre, this thesis aims to exploit the fibre characteristics such as thermal sensitivity, birefringence, dispersion and nonlinearity, in the applications of temperature sensing and radio-over-fibre systems. By exploiting the fibre thermal sensitivity, a fully distributed temperature sensing system consisting of an apodised chirped fibre Bragg grating has been implemented. The proposed system has proven to be efficient in characterising grating and providing the information of temperature variation, location and width of the heat source applied in the area under test. To exploit the fibre birefringence, a fibre delay line filter using a single high-birefringence optical fibre structure has been presented. The proposed filter can be reconfigured and programmed by <b>adjusting</b> the input <b>azimuth</b> of launched light, as well as the strength and direction of the applied coupling, to meet the requirements of signal processing for different purposes in microwave photonic and optical filtering applications. To exploit the fibre dispersion and nonlinearity, experimental investigations have been carried out to study their joint effect in high power double-sideband and single-sideband modulated links with the presence of fibre loss. The experimental results have been theoretically verified based on the in-house implementation of the split-step Fourier method applied to the generalised nonlinear Schrödinger equation. Further simulation study on the inter-modulation distortion in two-tone signal transmission has also been presented so as to show the effect of nonlinearity of one channel on the other. In addition to the experimental work, numerical simulations have also been carried out in all the proposed systems, to ensure that all the aspects concerned are comprehensively investigated.
