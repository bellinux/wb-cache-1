5|$|After {{the first}} two shows of season two, Jim Shelley in The Guardian, called The Wire the best show on TV, praising the second season {{for its ability to}} detach from its former {{foundations}} in the first season. Jon Garelick with the Boston Phoenix was of the opinion that the subculture of the docks (second season) was not as absorbing <b>as</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> housing projects (first season), but he went on to praise the writers for creating a realistic world and populating it with an array of interesting characters.|$|E
5|$|Before the Baroque era, {{keyboard}} music generally was {{not written}} for one instrument or another, but rather was written {{to be played}} on any keyboard instrument. For this reason, much of the organ's repertoire through the Renaissance period is the same <b>as</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> harpsichord. Pre-Renaissance keyboard music is found in compiled manuscripts that may include compositions {{from a variety of}} regions. The oldest of these sources is the Robertsbridge Codex, dating from about 1360. The Buxheimer Orgelbuch, which dates from about 1470 and was compiled in Germany, includes intabulations of vocal music by the English composer John Dunstaple. The earliest Italian organ music is found in the Faenza Codex, dating from 1420.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1834, threepence (3d) {{pieces were}} struck for {{circulation}}, bearing the same design as the Maundy 3d. The circulation pieces were initially struck {{for use in}} the West Indies, but beginning in 1845, were coined for use in Britain as well. Many of the 3d pieces presented to impoverished Maundy recipients were spent, and these are rarer than the other values today. Maundy 3ds may sometimes be distinguished from currency 3ds as dies with a more polished field were used for the Maundy pieces. The design of the circulation 3d remained the same <b>as</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Maundy 3d until 1928, when a new design was introduced for the circulating coins. Twopence coins identical to Maundy pieces, intended for colonial use, were struck in 1838, 1843, and 1848.|$|E

The performance increase of the fourth-generation iPad varies between tests, however an increase is nonetheless evident. Furthermore, battery longevity tests {{conducted by}} the same organization suggests that the battery of the fourth-generation iPad is able to last longer than its predecessor. However, the battery of the updated iPad 2 is able to outlast the fourth-generation iPad.|$|E
5|$|Cairano's career covers {{just over}} two decades (circa 1490–1510), a {{relatively}} short period, during which, moreover, the majority of works produced is concentrated in the latter decade. Among these, nearly three-quarters are religious commissions, executed {{mainly because of the}} greater funding available from such sources and the increased likelihood of their conservation over time. Numerous sculptures also stemmed from private commissions, especially funerary tombs, as well as secular cycles such <b>as</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Caesars. In many works, there is an evident, and sometimes overwhelming architectural component that indicates the careful preparations made by Cairano in this field. Cairano was lauded, as for example by the municipality of Chiari where he was explicitly named lapicida architectum et ingeniarum optimum.|$|E
5|$|Cerium has a {{variable}} electronic structure. The {{energy of the}} 4f electron is nearly the same <b>as</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> outer 5d and 6s electrons that are delocalized in the metallic state, and {{only a small amount}} of energy is required to change the relative occupancy of these electronic levels. This gives rise to dual valence states. For example, a volume change of about 10% occurs when cerium is subjected to high pressures or low temperatures. It appears that the valence changes from about 3 to 4 when it is cooled or compressed.|$|E

5|$|Chapter seven {{deals with}} conceptions of {{morality}} and ethics, arguing that whereas High Magic typically envisions a dualistic world view of good versus evil, Wicca adheres to a monistic worldview in which malevolence and benevolence are seen as intrinsic parts of the whole. Disagreeing with Luhrmann's view that morality's place in the occult is to hide the pseudo-scientific nature of magic, Greenwood discusses how magic and witchcraft developed in Europe {{as a part of}} moral discourse. She looks at the internal source of morality in High Magic, explaining concepts such <b>as</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Qliphoth, before examining the internal source of morality in Wicca and Feminist Witchcraft.|$|E
5|$|D'Eyncourt {{probably}} avoided proposing any {{design with}} 16-inch guns {{when he saw}} the political situation. In meetings with Leão, designs of only ten 12-inch guns mounted on the centerline were quickly rejected, even though their broadside was as strong <b>as</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Minas Geraes class, but a design with no less than fourteen 12-inch guns emerged as the frontrunner. Author David Topliss attributes this to political necessity, as he believed the Minister of the Navy could not validate purchasing a seemingly less-powerful dreadnought than the Minas Geraes class: with larger guns ruled out, the only remaining choice was a larger number of guns.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the harsh}} {{conditions}} on the surface, the atmospheric pressure and temperature at about 50km to 65km above {{the surface of the}} planet is nearly the same <b>as</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Earth, making its upper atmosphere the most Earth-like area in the Solar System, even more so than the surface of Mars. Due to the similarity in pressure and temperature and the fact that breathable air (21% oxygen, 78% nitrogen) is a lifting gas on Venus {{in the same way that}} helium is a lifting gas on Earth, the upper atmosphere has been proposed as a location for both exploration and colonization.|$|E

Efforts to match a footprint found near Sharp's house to Beauchamp were similarly unsuccessful. The posse that arrested Beauchamp had taken a bloody handkerchief from the crime scene, but had lost it on the trip back to Frankfort after the arrest. The best evidence presented by the prosecution was the testimony of Sharp's wife Eliza that she heard the killer's voice and that it was distinctly high-pitched. When given the opportunity to hear Beauchamp's voice, she identified it <b>as</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> killer.|$|E

Limantour, who broadly agreed with Estañol, had the support of the Mexican financiers, who feared the downgrading of Mexican international credit and a general economic crisis as a result of ongoing social unrest, as well <b>as</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> large landowners who were willing to come to terms with Madero if it would put an end to the agrarian uprisings.|$|E
