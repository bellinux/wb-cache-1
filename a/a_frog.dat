5|$|The boiling frog is {{a parable}} {{describing}} <b>a</b> <b>frog</b> being slowly boiled alive. The {{premise is that}} if <b>a</b> <b>frog</b> is put suddenly into boiling water, it will jump out, but if the frog is put in tepid water which is then brought to a boil slowly, it will not perceive the danger and will be cooked to death. The story is often used {{as a metaphor for}} the inability or unwillingness of people to react to or be aware of threats that arise gradually.|$|E

5|$|The distant {{vision of}} <b>a</b> <b>frog</b> {{is better than}} its near vision. Calling frogs will quickly become silent when they see an {{intruder}} or even a moving shadow but the closer an object is, the less well it is seen. When <b>a</b> <b>frog</b> shoots out its tongue to catch an insect it is reacting to a small moving object that it cannot see well and must line it up precisely beforehand because it shuts its eyes as the tongue is extended. Whether <b>a</b> <b>frog</b> sees in colour is debatable {{but it has been}} shown that it responds positively to blue light, perhaps because that colour is associated with bodies of water that can provide refuge when the frog feels threatened.|$|E
5|$|The skin of <b>a</b> <b>frog</b> is {{permeable}} to {{oxygen and}} carbon dioxide, {{as well as}} to water. There are blood vessels near the surface of the skin and when <b>a</b> <b>frog</b> is underwater, oxygen diffuses directly into the blood. When not submerged, <b>a</b> <b>frog</b> breathes by a process known as buccal pumping. Its lungs {{are similar to those of}} humans, but the chest muscles are not involved in respiration, and no ribs or diaphragm exist to help move air in and out. Instead, it puffs out its throat and draws air in through the nostrils, which in many species can then be closed by valves. When the floor of the mouth is compressed, air is forced into the lungs. The fully aquatic Bornean flat-headed frog (Barbourula kalimantanensis) is the first frog known to lack lungs entirely.|$|E
5|$|As part of {{advancing}} science, several experiments observing {{the reaction of}} frogs to slowly heated water {{took place in the}} 19th century. In 1869, while doing experiments searching for the location of the soul, German physiologist Friedrich Goltz demonstrated that <b>a</b> <b>frog</b> that has had its brain removed will remain in slowly heated water, but an intact frog attempted to escape the water when it reached 25°C.|$|E

5|$|Later, {{the sage}} Jaratkaru married Manasa, but Chandi ruined Manasa's wedding night. Chandi advised Manasa to wear snake {{ornaments}} and then threw <b>a</b> <b>frog</b> in the bridal chamber which caused the snakes {{to run around}} the chamber. As a consequence, the terrified Jaratkaru ran away from the house. After few days, he returned and Astika, their son, was born.|$|E
5|$|Like other amphibians, {{the life}} cycle of <b>a</b> <b>frog</b> {{normally}} starts in water with an egg that hatches into a limbless larva with gills, commonly known as a tadpole. After further growth, during which it develops limbs and lungs, the tadpole undergoes metamorphosis in which its appearance and internal organs are rearranged. After this it is able to leave the water as a miniature, air-breathing frog.|$|E
5|$|The University of Bristol is {{associated}} with two Ig Nobel Prizes, an award for unusual or trivial achievements in scientific research. Sir Michael Berry shared the award (with Andre Geim, a Nobel Laureate) for using magnets to levitate <b>a</b> <b>frog.</b> Gareth Jones also shared an Ig Nobel prize for scientifically documenting fellatio in fruit bats.|$|E

50|$|In 1856, {{with his}} {{colleague}} Albert von Kölliker (1817-1905), he showed that an electric current was produced from each contraction of <b>a</b> <b>frog's</b> heart.|$|R
5|$|The second {{match was}} between Chavo Guerrero and Jimmy Wang Yang for the WWE Cruiserweight Championship. The match began with Yang and Guerrero locking up, {{followed}} by Yang in control {{through most of}} the match. After Yang missed a moonsault, Guerrero executed a Gory Bomb. Shortly after, Guerrero performed <b>a</b> <b>Frog</b> Splash on Yang. Afterwards, Guerrero pinned Yang to win the match and retain the Cruiserweight Championship.|$|E
5|$|Troy {{ends the}} special {{with a look}} at the {{upcoming}} season of The Simpsons, filled with ridiculous plot twists, such as Homer turning Lisa into <b>a</b> <b>frog</b> using magic powers, the discovery of Bart's two long lost identical brothers (one African American, the other a cowboy), Selma marrying Lenny, Bumblebee Man, and Itchy (in succession), and Homer meeting an alien named Ozmodiar whom only he can see.|$|E
5|$|While some 19th-century {{experiments}} {{suggested that}} the underlying premise is true if the heating is sufficiently gradual, according to contemporary biologists the premise is false: <b>a</b> <b>frog</b> that is gradually heated will jump out. Indeed, thermoregulation by changing location is a fundamentally necessary survival strategy for frogs and other ectotherms.|$|E
50|$|<b>As</b> <b>frogs</b> {{are rarely}} found as {{articulated}} skeletons in the fossil record, {{the discovery of}} this new taxon has provided important insight into anuran evolution.|$|R

50|$|It is the {{intrinsic}} musculoskeletal properties of <b>a</b> <b>frog’s</b> leg, not neurally mediated spinal reflexes, that stabilize its wiping movements at irritants when the leg movement is instigated.|$|R
5|$|Animal remains {{have been}} found in the wreck of the Mary Rose. These include the skeletons of a rat, <b>a</b> <b>frog</b> and a dog. The dog, a mongrel between {{eighteen}} months and two years in age, was found near the hatch to the ship's carpenter's cabin and is thought to have been brought aboard as a ratter. Nine barrels {{have been found}} to contain bones of cattle, indicating that they contained pieces of beef butchered and stored as ship's rations. In addition, the bones of pigs and fish, stored in baskets, have also been found.|$|E
5|$|Frog Fractions is a 2012 browser game {{developed}} by Twinbeard Studios, a company composed primarily of founder Jim Crawford. The game, released on October 25, 2012, {{has been described}} as a spoof of the edutainment game genre. In the game, the player begins by controlling <b>a</b> <b>frog</b> to eat bugs and defend fruit. Later on, the player may spend points on upgrades to improve their frog's abilities. The game does not actually teach the player about fractions; the player's score is given in fractions, but no knowledge of them is necessary to play.|$|E
5|$|Nicky Flippers {{was not a}} part of {{the story}} as it was {{initially}} conceived and prior to his creation, the investigation was going to be led by Chief Grizzly. After producer Sue Bea Montgomery and her husband pointed out similarities between the film and the 1950s television series The Thin Man, the Edwards brothers and Leech decided to introduce the character and his dog into the film as an homage. They considered several different types of animals before settling on making him <b>a</b> <b>frog.</b>|$|E

5|$|The acropolis is also {{distinguished}} {{by a great}} quantity of graffiti inscribed onto the stucco interior walls of its rooms, some of which display a considerable level of artistic skill. The graffiti is believed to date to the last phase of occupation of the acropolis, during the Early Postclassic, and includes local fauna and human figures, {{some of which are}} playing musical instruments. Animals depicted in the graffiti include a deer, a turtle and <b>a</b> <b>frog.</b> Two human figures are depicted playing flutes, while other subjects include pyramid temples, courtly scenes, vulvas and supernatural beings.|$|E
5|$|The anime was {{followed}} by a manga series of the same name published in V Jump starting in 1996. The series follows Mamo and Nu, who are joined by Johnny and Spekkio (in the form of <b>a</b> <b>frog),</b> as they continue their adventure through time. They meet various characters from Chrono Trigger along the way, including Masamune, Lavos, Gaspar, Ozzie, Slash and Flea. In 1998, the chapters of the series were released as a tankōbon.|$|E
5|$|The call or croak of <b>a</b> <b>frog</b> {{is unique}} to its species. Frogs create this sound by passing air through the larynx in the throat. In most calling frogs, the sound is amplified {{by one or more}} vocal sacs, {{membranes}} of skin under the throat or {{on the corner of the}} mouth, that distend during the amplification of the call. Some frog calls are so loud that they can be heard up to a mile away.|$|E
5000|$|The {{title is}} taken from a Hungarian expression, [...] "a béka segge alatt" [...] used to {{describe}} any situation when things can't seem to get any worse: [...] "under <b>a</b> <b>frog's</b> arse, down <b>a</b> coalmine".|$|R
5000|$|A {{reference}} {{is made to}} Lovecraft himself; a worker mentions how a serious [...] "gentleman from Providence" [...] named Mr. Love passed through several weeks earlier, predicting the onslaught and building a lighthouse in the desert. He is described as having [...] "eyes so round like <b>a</b> <b>frog's</b> <b>a</b> lipless mouth," [...] characteristics matching the [...] "Innsmouth Look" [...] of the Deep Ones.|$|R
