3000|$|... ○ Overcoming oversubscription: In the {{traditional}} 3 -tier datacenter network, one <b>access</b> <b>switch</b> only connects to one core switch; therefore, the traffic capacity between servers under different access switches {{depends on the}} link capacity between the access layer and the core layer. Sometimes the available bandwidth between the access layer and the core layer {{is not enough to}} handle traffic spikes, which may lead to unexpected oversubscription. One way to mitigate the oversubscription problem is to use higher link capacity between the access layer and the core layer than that between servers and the access layer. However, oversubscription using the tree-based topology can still exist and result in the blocking server-to-server connectivity problem which can have severe performance impact on data centers due to increasing east-west traffic.|$|E

As shown in Fig.  1, the Spine-Leaf topology has two types of switches: Spine switch and Leaf switch. Spine switches work as aggregation switches in the traditional 3 -tier network architecture. They only connect with Leaf switches and do not connect directly with servers. Every Spine switch connects with all Leaf switches. Leaf <b>switches</b> are <b>access</b> <b>switches.</b> They connect with Spine switches {{and a number of}} servers.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{challenging}} barriers to a successful application of the assistive robots is how to enable users who have special needs to interact with the robot aids in an efficient and comfortable manner, since the conventional control method using a traditional joystick combined with buttons and/or knobs demands fine motor control and good dexterity resulting in cognitive and physical workload. Adopting computer access technology, which has provided an alternative means to allow people who have a wide range of special needs to independently access their computer, can be a practical solution to this issue. In this paper, we reviewed and discussed the potentials and challenges of computer access technologies as an alternative control method for controlling assistive robotic manipulators, focusing on most widely adopted interventions in the clinical settings, including alternative pointing, keyboard-only <b>access,</b> <b>switch</b> scanning interface and speech recognition...|$|E
