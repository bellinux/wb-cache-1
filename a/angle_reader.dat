40|$|The atd {{angle is}} a dermatoglyphic trait formed by drawing lines between the triradii below {{the first and}} last digits and the most {{proximal}} triradius on the hypothenar region of the palm. This trait has been widely used in dermatoglyphic studies, but several researchers have questioned its utility, specifically whether or not it can be measured reliably. The purpose of this research was to examine the measurement reliability of this trait. Finger and palm prints were taken using the carbon paper and tape method from the right and left hands of 100 individuals. Each atd angle was read twice, at different times, by Reader A, using a goniometer and a magnifying glass, and three times by a Reader B, using Adobe Photoshop. Inter-class correlation coefficients were estimated for the intra- and inter-reader measurements of the atd <b>angles.</b> <b>Reader</b> A was able to quantify atd angles on 149 out of 200 prints (74. 5 %), and Reader B on 179 out of 200 prints (89. 5 %). Both readers agreed on whether an angle existed on a print 89. 8 % of the time for the right hand and 78. 0 % for the left. Intra-reader correlations were 0. 97 or greater for both readers. Inter-reader correlations for atd angles measured by both readers ranged from 0. 92 to 0. 96. These results suggest that the atd angle can be measured reliably, and further imply that measurement using a software program may provide an advantage over other methods...|$|R

60|$|But {{the form}} reached in fig. 13 was quickly {{felt to be}} of great value and power. One {{would have thought it}} might have been taken {{straight}} from the Corinthian type; but it is clearly the work of men who were making experiments for themselves. For instance, in the central capital of Fig. XXXI. Vol. II., there is a trial condition of it, with the intermediate leaf set behind those at the <b>angles</b> (the <b>reader</b> had better take a magnifying glass to this woodcut; it will show the character of the capitals better). Two other experimental forms occur in the Casa Cicogna (Vol. II.), and supply one of the evidences which fix the date of that palace. But the form soon was determined as in fig. 13, and then means were sought of recommending it by farther decoration.|$|R
50|$|During World War Hulk, when {{a number}} of Komodo's {{teammates}} broke rank to go and fight the Hulk, Komodo chose to follow orders and stay put. Komodo struck up a relationship with fellow trainee Hardball even going {{as far as to}} show him her true form, which was missing both legs below the knee. Intentionally this time; he had seen it before when she lost control while asleep. This was against Initiative secret identity rules but Hardball reassured his superior officers that no trouble would result, she was 'just a girl'. In this incident, <b>angles</b> prevented the <b>reader</b> from seeing Komodo's legs.|$|R
30|$|Each {{manufacturer}} of sensing equipment (e.g. RFID tags, readers, antenna, etc.) gives {{a range of}} specifications. For example, a <b>reader</b> <b>angle</b> may say “ 65 ° plus or minus a degree.” Although the range may not seem large, it still may lead to false results if improperly calculated. Therefore, it is proper to test the specifications of each newly acquired piece of equipment to verify it is {{in accordance with the}} manufacture’s specification. Each unit varies slightly, and it is important to use what has been verified from the testing to produce proper results in the final system. This section provides the experiments and results used in this research.|$|R
40|$|Localization via Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is {{frequently}} used in different applications nowadays. It {{has the advantage}} that next to its ostensible purpose of identifying objects via their unique IDs it can simultaneously {{be used for the}} localization of these objects. In this work it is shown how Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) measurements at different antennae of a passive UHF RFID label can be combined for localization. The localization is only done based on the RSSI measurements and a Kalman Filter (KF). Because of non-linearities in the measurement function it is necessary to incorporate an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) or an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) where simulations have shown that the UKF performs better than the EKF. Additionally to the selection of the filter there are different possibilities to increase the localization accuracy of the UKF: The advantages of using Reference Tags (RT) or more than one tag per trolley (relative positioning) in combination with an Unscented Kalman Filter are discussed and simulations results show that the localization error can be decreased significantly via these methods. Another possibility to increase the localization accuracy and in addition to achieve a more realistic simulation is the consideration of the <b>angle</b> between <b>reader</b> antenna and tag. Simulation results with the incorporation of different numbers of fixed antennae lead to the conclusion that this is a useful surplus in the localization...|$|R
40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} investigate whether a locus of binocular correspondence extends eccentrically from the vertical horopter. In experiment 1, we investigated whether the backward inclination of the vertical horopter was manifested in the <b>angle</b> at which <b>readers</b> prefer to orient the page. All observers preferred a page inclined backwards to any other orientation. This backward inclination was less than predicted from previous psychophysical reports, however. In experiment 2, we investigated the extent of binocular correspondence, defined by minimal apparent interocular horizontal motion, in the central 24 deg of the binocular field. Our data define a planar surface inclined top-away from the observer as a locus from which psychophysical corresponding points are stimulated. In experiment 3, we measured vertical adjustments required to eliminate apparent vertical motion. Together, the pattern of results from experiments 2 and 3 is most consistent with a planar surface, inclined top-away from the observer. This is consistent with Helmholtz 2 ̆ 7 s account of the backward inclination of the vertical horopter and expands the locus of zero horizontal disparity from a single line in the median plane to eccentric loci extending at least ± 12 deg in the central binocular field...|$|R
40|$|Rapid {{progression}} of joint destruction {{is an indication}} of poor prognosis in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Computed tomography (CT) has the potential to serve as a gold standard for joint imaging since it provides high resolution three-dimensional (3 D) images of bone structure. The authors have developed a method to quantify erosion volume changes on wrist CT scans. In this article they present a description and validation of the methodology using multiple scans of a hand phantom and five human subjects. An anthropomorphic hand phantom was imaged with a clinical CT scanner at three different orientations separated by a 30 -deg <b>angle.</b> A <b>reader</b> used the semiautomated software tool to segment the individual carpal bones of each CT scan. Reproducibility was measured as the root-mean-square standard deviation (RMMSD) and coefficient of variation (CoV) between multiple measurements of the carpal volumes. Longitudinal erosion progression was studied by inserting simulated erosions in a paired second scan. The change in simulated erosion size was calculated by performing 3 D image registration and measuring the volume difference between scans in a region adjacent to the simulated erosion. The RMSSD for the total carpal volumes was 21. 0 mm 3 (CoV= 1. 3 %) for the phantom, and 44. 1 mm 3 (CoV= 3. 0 %) for the in vivo subjects. Using 3 D registration and local volume difference calculations, the RMMSD was 1. 0 − 3. 0 mm 3. The reader time was approximately 5 min per carpal bone. There was excellent agreement between the measured and simulated erosion volumes. The effect of a poorly measured volume for a single erosion is mitigated by the large number of subjects that would comprise a clinical study and that there will be many erosions measured per patient. CT promises to be a quantifiable tool to measure erosion volumes and may serve as a gold standard {{that can be used in}} the validation of other modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging...|$|R
5000|$|Gamble listed {{numerous}} fallacies of {{the book}} as follows:"Thomas Jefferson was not among {{the framers of the}} Constitution (pp. 69-70); Lincoln advised sending freed slaves to Liberia in a speech in 1854, not “during the war” (pp. 16-17); Lincoln was {{not a member of the}} Illinois state legislature in 1857 (p. 18); the commerce clause was not an “amendment,”; Thaddeus Stevens was a Pennsylvania representative, not a senator (p. 140); and Fort Sumter was not a customs house (p. 242)."Additionally: [...] "In chapter 3, DiLorenzo claims that in a letter to Salmon P. Chase, Lincoln “admitted that the original Emancipation proclamation had no legal justification, except as a war measure” (p. 37). His source, however, is the recollections of a conversation (not a letter) that portrait artist Francis B. Carpenter (not Chase) had with Lincoln, and at no point do these recollections sustain DiLorenzo’s summary of them. Moreover, in the reference for this section, DiLorenzo misidentifies the title of his source as Paul <b>Angle’s</b> The American <b>Reader,</b> when in fact the jumbled material comes from Angle’s The Lincoln Reader." [...] He also notes that DiLorenzo claims, for example, [...] "that in the four years between 1860 and 1864, population in the thirteen largest Northern cities rose by 70 percent” (p. 225)." [...] Gamble checks the source and finds it says that total rate of growth took place over 15 years.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Computer and Electronical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2009. On {{the request}} of government's {{transport}} authority, SANRAL, the North-west University was requested to investigate the applicability of using passive ultra-high frequency (UHF) radio-frequency identification (RFID) for vehicle identification. This work focuses on the characterisation of the physical channel of passive UHF RFID {{for the purposes of}} electronic vehicle identification (EVI). A literature study was done on the principles of RFID, radio-wave propagation, fading, elctro-magnetic (EM) modelling, and simulation. An EM modelling package, SuperNEC, was used to resolve static frames of EM environments. An addition to the SuperNEC package was created for analysis of moving vehicles. Models of an RFID reader antenna assembly, tag and discrete vehicle classes were developed, which resulted in five main classes of vehicle models. The orientation <b>angle</b> of the <b>reader</b> antennas, the length of the interrogation zone, and the magnitude of reflected power from metal surfaces were determined from simulations. From the simulations, it was possible to draw profiles of the power received by tags, as well as the energy reflected from metal surfaces on vehicles. Results from simulations were analysed and the optimum reader orientation was found, interrogation zone lengths were found, and bench-marks for reflected energy were found. An alternative placement of tags on bus and truck windscreens was also a result. The initial goal was achieve, namely to address the risk of unknowns in the UHF environment. This work thus serves to support the use of UHF RFID in EVI applications. Master...|$|R
40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{develop and}} {{validate}} {{a new and}} improved software method to rapidly determine femur–tibia <b>angle</b> (FTA). MethodsThree <b>readers,</b> two skilled and one unskilled, without any formal medical training, measured FTA in 142 subjects from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI). The reader reliability was assessed using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC), root mean square standard deviation (RMSSD), and Bland–Altman plots, comparing the existing and new FTA methods. Gender-specific linear regression assessed the relationship of FTA with the hip–knee–ankle angle (HKA). ResultsThe ICC (RMSSD) for intra- and inter-reader reproducibility of the existing FTA method was 0. 96 (0. 77 °) and 0. 92 (1. 38 °), respectively, and for the new technique was 0. 98 (0. 25 °) and 0. 98 (0. 37 °), with similar results for all three readers. Bland–Altman 95 % limits of agreement were greater than ± 2 ° for the existing, and ± 1 ° for the new method. The r-value for the relation of FTA to HKA was 0. 68 and 0. 72 for the existing and new methods, respectively. Varus (HKA ≤ − 2 °) /neutral (− 2 ° < HKA <  2 °) /valgus (HKA ≥  2 °) alignment based on predicted HKA agreed moderately with measured HKA (weighted kappa =  0. 53), and had moderate sensitivity (73 %) and specificity (84 %) for varus malalignment. The new FTA was related to HKA using a linear equation with a slope of 0. 98 and an offset of 4. 0 °. ConclusionsSince it is largely automated and uses unambiguous anatomical landmarks, the new method is highly reproducible and can be made on a standard posteroanterior (PA) knee radiograph by a relatively unskilled reader...|$|R
