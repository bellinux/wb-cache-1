One {{of the most}} important treatments is the control of <b>agitation</b> due to the extreme possibility of injury to the person themselves or caregivers, benzodiazepines should be administered at first sign of this. Physical restraints are not recommended for <b>agitation</b> or delirium as they may contribute to mortality by enforcing isometric muscle contractions that are associated with severe lactic acidosis and hyperthermia. If physical restraints are necessary for severe <b>agitation</b> they must be rapidly replaced with pharmacological sedation. The <b>agitation</b> can cause a large amount of muscle breakdown.

On 7 March, the administration withdrew {{all the cases}} filed against the student leaders and on 14 March, the Anti-Hindi imposition <b>Agitation</b> Council dropped the <b>agitation.</b> Shastri's climbdown angered the pro-Hindi activists in North India. Members of Jan Sangh went about the streets of New Delhi, blackening out English signs with tar. The <b>agitation</b> slowly changed into a general anti-Congress organisation. In the 1967 election, student leader P. Seenivasan contested against Kamaraj in the Virudhunagar constituency.

The <b>agitation</b> was marked by anti-Brahmin sentiments as the protesters believed Brahmins were attempting to impose Hindi and Sanskrit over Tamil. Despite the general anti-Brahminism of the <b>agitation,</b> a few Brahmins like Kanchi Rajagopalachari also participated in the movement.|$|E

5|$|During 1946–50, {{there were}} {{sporadic}} agitations against Hindi by the Dravidar Kazhagam (DK) and Periyar. Whenever the government introduced Hindi as a compulsory language in schools, anti-Hindi protests happened and succeeded in stopping the move. The largest anti-Hindi imposition agitations {{in this period}} occurred in 1948–50. After India obtained independence in 1947, the Congress Government at the Centre urged all states to make Hindi compulsory in schools. The Congress Government of Madras Presidency under Omandur Ramasamy Reddiar complied and made Hindi compulsory from the academic year 1948–49. It also introduced a minimum mark qualification in Hindi {{for the promotion of}} students to higher classes. Periyar once again launched an anti-Hindi imposition <b>agitation.</b> The 1948 <b>agitation</b> was supported by former Congress nationalists like M. P. Sivagnanam and Thiru. Vi. Ka, who recanted their earlier pro-Hindi policies. On 17 July, the DK convened an all party anti-Hindi conference to oppose the compulsory Hindi teaching. As in the <b>agitation</b> of 1938–40, this <b>agitation</b> was also characterized by strikes, black flag demonstrations and anti-Hindi processions. When Rajaji (then the Governor-General of India) visited Madras on 23 August, the DK staged a black flag demonstration protesting against his visit. On 27 August, Periyar and Annadurai were arrested. The Government did not change its position on Hindi and the <b>agitation</b> continued. On 18 December, Periyar and other DK leaders were arrested again. A compromise was reached between the government and agitators. The government stopped the legal action against the agitators and they in turn dropped the <b>agitation</b> on 26 December 1948. Eventually, the government made Hindi teaching optional from the academic year 1950–51. Students {{who did not want to}} learn Hindi were allowed to participate in other school activities during Hindi classes.|$|E
