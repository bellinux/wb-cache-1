5|$|The oribi {{has been}} {{classified}} as Least Concern by the IUCN. The total population (as of 2008) {{is estimated at}} 750,000. However, the subspecies O. o. haggardi is listed as Vulnerable because, as of 2008, the total population is estimated <b>at</b> <b>less</b> than 10,000 mature individuals, and is feared to be declining. Hunting is a relatively minor threat, since the oribi shows some tolerance to hunting. Nevertheless, the steep fall of 92% in oribi populations in Comoé National Park (Côte d'Ivoire) {{has been attributed to}} poaching.

5|$|A second method {{involves}} artificially inseminating {{an elephant}} egg cell with sperm cells from a frozen woolly mammoth carcass. The resulting offspring {{would be an}} elephant–mammoth hybrid, and the process {{would have to be}} repeated so more hybrids could be used in breeding. After several generations of cross-breeding these hybrids, an almost pure woolly mammoth would be produced. The fact that sperm cells of modern mammals are viable for 15 years at most after deep-freezing is a hindrance to this method. In one case, an Asian elephant and an African elephant produced a live calf named Motty, but it died of defects <b>at</b> <b>less</b> than two weeks old.|$|E
5|$|Advances {{during the}} last decades {{has led to the}} recent {{approval}} of several oral drugs. These drugs are expected to gain in popularity and frequency of use at the expense of previously existing therapies. Further oral drugs are still under investigation, the most notable example being laquinimod, which was announced in August 2012 to be the focus of a third phase III trial after mixed results in the previous ones. Similarly, Other studies are aimed to improve efficacy and ease of use of already existing therapies through the use of novel preparations. Such is the case the PEGylated version of interferon-β-1a, that has a longer life than normal interferon and therefore it is being studied if given <b>at</b> <b>less</b> frequent doses has a similar efficacy than the existing product. With the completion of a robust two-year study, it is shown that the PEGylated interferon beta-1a has greater efficacy in decreasing relapse rate and disability progression compared to placebo for MS patients.|$|E

40|$|We have {{investigated}} whether acid-mediated bile acid precipitation, pancreatic enzyme inactivation, and fatty acid partitioning occur in health when intraluminal pH falls below 5. In {{order to assess}} lipolysis and aqueous solubilisation of lipid, we first developed a new technique for inactivating lipase in jejunal aspirate (acid inactivation), {{and showed it to}} be more effective and simpler than the established technique (heat inactivation). We then studied 14 healthy subjects, aspirating jejunal content for three hours after a liquid meal, and pooling according to pH. Eighteen per cent of the total aspirate was collected <b>at</b> pH <b>less</b> than 5 compared with 56 % at pH greater than 6 (p less than 0. 01). Forty eight per cent of the bile acids were precipitated <b>at</b> pH <b>less</b> than 5 compared with 18 % at pH greater than 6 (p less than 0. 01), leading to a reduction in aqueous phase bile acid concentration at low pH (2. 1 mmol/l <b>at</b> pH <b>less</b> than 5 vs 5. 8 mmol/l at pH greater than 6, p less than 0. 01). Lipase activity was reduced at low pH (133 IU/l <b>at</b> pH <b>less</b> than 5 vs 182 IU/l at pH greater than 6, p less than 0. 01), leading to reduced lipolysis at low pH (14 % <b>at</b> pH <b>less</b> than 5 vs 32 % at pH greater than 6, p less than 0. 01). Aqueous phase lipid concentration was reduced at low pH (3. 5 mmol/l <b>at</b> pH <b>less</b> than 5 vs 12. 5 mmol/l at pH greater than 6, p less than 0. 01). This reduction was less dependent on bile acid precipitation than on lipase inactivation and fatty acid partitioning. We conclude that intraluminal acidity influences aqueous solubilisation of bile acids and lipid in health...|$|R
