5|$|Later in June, Fox News did {{a report}} on the {{families}} of the candidates running for President. Jim Gilmore's family was described as being busy with school and employment, limiting them from full-time campaigning. Two of the candidate's sons, Ashton <b>and</b> <b>Jay</b> were examined for the report. Ashton Gilmore worked full-time for his father's campaign headquarters, <b>and</b> <b>Jay</b> Gilmore worked in Washington and was only able to campaign as his schedule allowed. In election polling, unpromising results surfaced for the Gilmore campaign. In a CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll, Gilmore failed to register half a percentage point among Republican voters. A grimmer portrait was painted for the campaign when end of the month finances revealed it was nearly broke with only $61,765 cash on hand from the $391,693 that had been raised overall.|$|E

50|$|Tits are active, noisy, {{and social}} birds. They are {{territorial}} during the breeding season and often join mixed-species feeding flocks during the nonbreeding season.

5|$|The American robin is a known {{reservoir}} (carrier) for West Nile virus. While crows <b>and</b> <b>jays</b> {{are often}} the first noticed deaths in an area with West Nile virus, the American robin is suspected {{to be a key}} host, and holds a larger responsibility for the transmission of the virus to humans. This is because, while crows <b>and</b> <b>jays</b> die quickly from the virus, the American robin survives the virus longer, hence spreading it to more mosquitoes, which then transmit the virus to humans and other species.|$|R

5|$|Carl Linnaeus {{described}} the grey jay as Corvus canadensis in the 12th {{edition of his}} Systema Naturae in 1766. William John Swainson named it Dysornithia brachyrhncha in 1831. French ornithologist Charles Lucien Bonaparte assigned the grey jay to the genus Perisoreus in 1838 in A geographical and comparative list of the birds of Europe and North America, along with the Siberian jay, P. infaustus. The grey jay belongs to the crow <b>and</b> <b>jay</b> family Corvidae. However, it {{and the other members}} of its genus are not closely related to other birds known as jays; they are instead close to the genus Cyanopica, which contains the azure-winged magpie. Its relatives are native to Eurasia, and ancestors of the grey jay are thought to have diverged from their Old World relatives and crossed Beringia into North America.|$|E
