40|$|Executing {{numerical}} {{experiments with}} a barotropic inflow-outflow model with Hachijo Island embodied explicitly, we have re-examined {{the dependence of}} the Kuroshio path variation south of Japan on its velocity, Vmax, and investigated the stability of a straight and <b>a</b> meandering <b>path</b> in the multiple equilibrium regime to a short-term (pulse-like) variation of Vmax. The dependence of path selection on Vmax {{is the same as}} in previous studies: the Kuroshio takes <b>a</b> straight <b>path</b> at low Vmax (regime I), <b>a</b> meandering <b>path</b> at high Vmax (regime II) and two different paths at intermediate Vmax (regime III; multiple equilibrium regime). However, the modeled Hachijo Island causes two differences. First, the Kuroshio takes <b>a</b> detouring <b>path</b> around the island (<b>a</b> quasi-steady C-type <b>path)</b> {{at the lower end of}} regime III. Secondly, <b>a</b> transient C-type <b>path</b> always appears in the course of the transition from a meandering to <b>a</b> straight <b>path</b> when Vmax decreases from regime III (II) to I. It takes one to several years for this transition to be completed, almost consistent with observations. With the short-term increase in Vmax imposed in regime III, <b>a</b> straight <b>path</b> develops into <b>a</b> meandering <b>path</b> when its amplification rate Amp and duration T exceed 1. 75 and 30 days, respectively, or when T ranges from 45 to 75 days wit...|$|R
