5|$|One of {{the more}} {{immediate}} ideas for redevelopment of the base was {{to turn it into}} <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> <b>prison,</b> something which had been done previously at the former Carswell AFB in Texas when the Federal Medical Center, Carswell was opened on its grounds. Many other former Air Force facilities have had prisons opened up on their grounds as well. From the outset, there was some reluctance in the town about turning it into creating a prison culture in Limestone, but this was lessened once the government decided that it did not want to build <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> <b>prison</b> {{on the grounds of the}} former air base.|$|E

5|$|On June 28, 2007, Scrushy {{was sentenced}} to six years and ten months in <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> <b>prison,</b> ordered to pay $267,000 in {{restitution}} to United Way of Alabama, three years probation, and a fine of $150,000. Scrushy {{is also expected to}} personally pay for his time in prison and perform 500 hours of community service. Siegelman was sentenced on the same day to seven years and four months in prison, restitution of $181,325 to the state, three years probation, a $50,000 fine, and 500 hours of community service upon his release. U.S. District Judge Mark Fuller would later rule, however, that Sieglman would not be required to pay the $181,325 in restitution. The restitution was based on debts accumulated by the State of Alabama during a fraudulent warehouse deal, but Siegelman was acquitted on charges related to the deal. Upon sentencing, Scrushy and Siegelman were taken into custody and transported to <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> <b>prison</b> in Atlanta, Georgia, where they briefly shared a cell.|$|E
5|$|By Election Day, November 2, 1920, few had {{any doubts}} that the Republican ticket would win.

Cox received 34percent of the national vote and 127 electoral votes. Campaigning from <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> <b>prison</b> where he was serving a sentence for opposing the war, Socialist Eugene V. Debs received 3percent of the national vote. The Republicans greatly increased their majority in each house of Congress.|$|E
5|$|Historically, two {{paths of}} the native {{indigenous}} peoples ran along parts of White Deer Hole Creek. Settlers arrived by 1770, but fled in 1778 during the American Revolutionary War. They returned and the creek served as the southern boundary of Lycoming County when it was formed on April 13, 1795. A logging railroad ran along the creek from 1901 to 1904 for timber clearcutting, and small-scale lumbering continues. During World War II a Trinitrotoluene (TNT) plant, which became <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> <b>prison</b> in 1952, {{was built in the}} watershed. Most development is in the eastern end of the valley, with two unincorporated villages, a hamlet, and most of the farms (many Amish).|$|E

5|$|After {{the mint}} closed, it {{performed}} {{a variety of}} functions for the Federal government. It was first downgraded to an assay office for the U.S. Treasury {{as it had been}} from 1876 to 1879. Then, in 1932, the assay office closed and the building was converted into <b>a</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>prison,</b> in which capacity it served until 1943. The Coast Guard then took over the building as a nominal storage facility, though in truth the structure was largely abandoned and left to decay until it was transferred to the state of Louisiana in 1965. During the Cold War, when many believed there to be a high risk of nuclear war, the old Mint was considered to be the best fallout shelter in the city.|$|E
5|$|On December 9, 1979, a bus {{carrying}} 18 American Navy sailors {{was forced}} to stop by a delivery truck. Shortly afterwards, four men appeared from within another vehicle and opened fire, killing Emil White and John Ball. Both the EPB and the OVPRR accepted responsibility for the attack, citing it as payback for the unclarified death of Ángel Rodríguez Cristóbal (previously arrested for protesting the Navy's activities in the island of Vieques) in <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> <b>prison</b> in Tallahassee, which had raised controversy because the photographic evidence displayed signs of contusions and contradicted the official account that he had simply committed suicide. On March 13, 1980, the EPB took responsibility for attacking an ROTC vehicle that was moving three soldiers to the UPR.|$|E
