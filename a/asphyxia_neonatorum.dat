40|$|Mortality {{during the}} first two years of life among 1476 Pakistani infants born between September 1984 and March 1987 is {{described}} according to age, causes of death, area of living, season of the year and sex. The mortality rate (deaths under two years/ 1000 live births) projected over the whole population of Pakistan was 127 and under one year 114. During {{the first two years of}} life, the mortality rate was 133 / 1000 in the village, 159 in the periurban slum, 107 in the urban slum and 17 in the upper middle class group. In the latter group all deaths had occurred within 72 hours after birth. The overall major causes of death were acute and prolonged diarrhoea (36 %), <b>asphyxia</b> <b>neonatorum</b> (13 %), respiratory infections (13 %), septicaemia (11 %) and tetanus (9 %). A clear age dependency was noted with 14 % of deaths occurring {{during the first}} 24 hours of life (<b>asphyxia</b> <b>neonatorum</b> in 86 %), and 57 % dying within the first 28 days of life. In the later age groups, infections were mainly responsible for 82 % of total deaths. Early mortality was therefore extremely high in the poorer areas studied and the cause of death was highly age dependent. Any interventions for reducing mortality must therefore be directed towards better antenatal care and safe delivery and postnatally, towards preventing infections, especially during the first six months of life. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|The low APGAR baby {{delivered}} in a clinic presents the midwife with a formidable problem. The problem arises {{from the fact that}} clinics generally are poorly equipped for major resuscitation of the newborn.

Then too, midwives are generally poorly trained for the task o f resuscitating babies suffering from severe <b>asphyxia</b> <b>neonatorum,</b> because they received their training in hospitals with the basic assumption that a medical officer is always in the background ready to take over the management of such problems.

40|$|SUMMARY A {{relationship}} between the season of birth and the occurrence of neurological disorders has already been reported. An attempt {{has been made to}} see if a similar relationship exists in the case of cerebral palsy also. The month of birth of all the 212 children with cerebral palsy attending specialised centres in New Delhi was ascertained. The month of birth was compared with the month-wise normal distribution of live births in Delhi. The difference in monthly trend was found to be statistically highly significant. Does it suggest that cerebral palsy is a seasonal disorder? Our concept of the epidemiology of cerebral palsy has not changed much in the last 122 years. In 1862, Little proposed abnormal parturition and <b>asphyxia</b> <b>neonatorum</b> as a cause of cerebral palsy.

40|$|Background <b>Asphyxia</b> <b>neonatorum</b> {{may result}} in multiorgan {{dysfunction}} including renal involvement. There is no consensus on the determination of acute kidney injury (AKI) in neonates making establishment of the diagnosis and its management becomes difficult. The Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) recommends AKI criteria based on increased serum creatinine level and reduced urine output. Objectives To identify the prevalence of AKI in asphyxiated neonates using the AKIN criteria, to compare the difference of AKI stages, and the glomerular filtration rates (GFR) between moderate and severe asphyxia. Methods This was a cross-sectional analytical study conducted between July 2012 and January 2013. Subjects were all asphyxiated neonates (Apgar score 35 weeks delivered and hospitalized in Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital and Koja District Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia. Glomerular filtration rate was calculated using the components of urine creatinine, serum creatinine, and urine output; while AKI stages were determined according to AKIN criteria. Urinary output was measured via urethral catheterization. Results Of 94 subjects, there were 70 neonates with moderate and 24 neonates with severe asphyxia, with the prevalence of AKI was 63 %. Twenty one out of 24 neonates with severe asphyxia experienced AKI, while neonates with moderate asphyxia who experienced AKI was 38 out of 70 subjects (54 %). Two third of neonates with severe asphyxia who experienced AKI had stage 3 of AKI. More severe AKI stages and lower median GFR were found in neonates with severe compared to moderate asphyxia (P< 0. 001). Conclusion The prevalence of AKI in neonatal asphyxia is high (63 %).

40|$|Background Neonatal {{asphyxia}} is {{the major}} cause of neonatal death {{at a rate of}} approximately 23 %. The incidence of asphyxia is higher in developing countries, due to limited availability of perinatology facilities. Hypoxia due to asphyxia is characterized by low pulse oxygen saturation (Sp 02), which basic health care facilities are unable to monitor. The number ofnucleated red blood cells (nRBCs) in asphyxia increases in order to compensate for the hypoxia. Few studies have reported on nRBCs as they relate to pulse oxygen saturation in neonatal asphyxia. Objective To assess for a correlation between nRBCs and pulse oxygen saturation in neonatal asphyxia. Methods In this cross-sectional study, asphyxia was assessed by way of Apgar scores; pulse oxygen saturation was monitored by pulse oximetry; and nRBCs were determined by blood smears. Statistical analysis used was Spearman's test. Results Subjects were 41 neonates with asphyxia, 15 of whom had 5 th minute Apgar scores S 6. Subjects with Apgar scores S 6 had significantly higher umbilical venous nRBC counts [20. 0 (SD 13. 09) / 100 white blood cell] than subjects with Apgar score > 6 [8. 81 (SD 8. 71) / 100 white blood cell]; (P = 0. 004). Subjects with Apgar S 6 had significantly lower 5 th minute Sp 02 values [76. 46 (SD 6. 17) %] than subjects with Apgar scores > 6 [87. 03 (SD 6. 29) ]; (P < 0. 0001). Spearmans' test revealed a significant correlation between higher nRBC counts and lower pulse oxygen saturation (r = - 0. 804; P< 0. 0001). Conclusion In <b>asphyxia</b> <b>neonatorum</b> there is a correlation between umbilical vein nRBC counts and the 5 th minute Sp 02. As such, we recommend using nRBC examinations to predict pulse oxygen saturation as a means to assess the severity of hypoxia in peripheral areas where pulse oximetry machines may be unavailabl...|$|E

40|$|A {{survey on}} {{perinatal}} {{care in a}} rural area at Ujung Berung district, located 15 — 20 km outside Bandung, West Java was conducted. Three villages with a population of 40, 787 were selected. Health services were provided by one health post and several family planning posts. In this study 1303 pregnant women were followed throughout the 28 weeks of pregnancy until the infant is 28 days of age. Among the 1303 pregnant women 5. 7 % had received tetanus toxoid immunization. Perinatal mortality rate (PMR) was 43. 6 per thousand and incidence of low birth weight was 14. 3 percent. Only 12. 8 % pregnant women were using some kind of contraception before the last pregnancy. The PMR decreased in spite of the low percentage users. The main causes of death during perinatal period vece <b>asphyxia</b> <b>neonatorum</b> and infections. The incidence of tetanus neonatorum during neonatal period was 17 per thousand live births. An evaluation of health service activities showed 47. 5 % of these pregnant women had antenatal care. Care during delivery and early postnatal period was carried out by TBAs. No significant difference was found between the PMR of trained and untrained TBAs. Another aspect of health service activities is referral to the health centre or hospital. A total of 3. 8 percent infants were referred because of neo­natal problems; among these, refusal was 12. 5 % due to the totalistic attitude of the parents in the village. The results showed that coverage of pregnant women and their infants by safe health care services is very low. This may be due to lack of facilities and health personnel, and probably also due to the confidence of village people for traditional health care providers. Thus, education and training as well as supervision of traditional health care providers and their integration into the formal health care structure is of extreme importance.   </div...|$|E
40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} <b>asphyxia</b> <b>neonatorum</b> in a developing African community in the Mdantsane region of Ciskei. It also documents asphyxia as a prominent cause of childhood handicap, examines aspects of its epidemiology and evaluates {{the effectiveness of a}} regimen of phenobarbitone and dexamethasone in limiting subsequent neurological deficit in asphyxiated neonates. Analysis of neonatal deaths at Cecilia Makiwane Hospital over an 18 -month period showed that asphyxia accounted for one third of all neonatal deaths. In particular, asphyxia caused two thirds of deaths in infants over 2 Kg birth weight. From a hospital register of handicapped children, 211 had cerebral palsy. Asphyxia was the cause of cerebral palsy in 33 % of these children. Spastic quadriplegia, the type of cerebral palsy most often resulting from the cerebral damage associated with asphyxial hypoxic-ischaemic insults, was by far the largest diagnostic category (57 %). Asphyxia therefore appears to be the single largest cause of significant handicap in Ciskei. In view of the underdeveloped support services to parents in most developing areas, the problem of asphyxia is of considerable importance. In the study of the epidemiology of asphyxia, details of pregnancy and labour were obtained for 163 asphyxiated term infants and 2758 non- asphyxiated term infants whose mothers had delivered in the hospital. The factors positively associated with asphyxia were: low gravidity and parity, failure to book for antenatal care, the occurrence of antenatal disorders, the occurrence of fetal distress, a prolonged first stage of labour and delivery by caesarean section or vacuum extraction. Maternal age and the actual number of antenatal visits were not associated with asphyxia. The causes of asphyxia assigned by the specialist obstetrician in charge were cephalopelvic disproportion (CPD) (39 %), utero-placental pathologies (22 %), other (8 %), and "unknown" where he could find no abnormality in pregnancy and labour (27 %). From these findings it appears that the steps that need to be taken for prevention include: active recruitment of patients to book for antenatal care, more active detection and management of cephalopelvic disproportion and basic research to elucidate the causes of the "unknown" group whom it is speculated have undetected utero-placental pathology...|$|E

As a result; (1) In 39 cases (47. 6 %), diagnosis was rheumatic heart disease, and 30 cases (36. 6 %) had congenital heart disease. Other 13 cases (15. 9 %) were associated with miscellaneous heart disease. (2) According to functional classifications of the New York Heart Association, 74 cases (90. 2 %) was evaluated as either Class I or II, and other 8 cases (9. 8 %) was either Class III or IV. (3) Five cases (6. 1 %) developed cardiac insufficiencies; one case at home, one case during hospitalization and repeatedly during cesarean section, and three cases during labors. (4) Two women (2. 4 %) resulted in fatal outcome. One case with mitral stenosis, who was poorly managed by a general physician and developed pulmonary edema at home, died immediately after emergent admission and delivery of dead fetus at the 29 th gestational week. One case with patent ductus arteriosus died 5 months after recovery from cardiac arrest due to a massive hemorrhage from placenta previa during cesarean section. (5) As pregnancy complications, nine cases (11. 0 %) had premature deliveries, two cases (2. 4 %) with breech presentations, two cases (2. 4 %) with twin pregnancies, and two cases (2. 4 %) developed severe toxemia of pregnancy.

40|$|The {{history of}} newborn {{resuscitation}} {{in the twentieth}} century presented thus far in the writings of practitioner-historians describes a ‘hands-off’ attitude to newborn care prior to the 1950 s. These practioner-historians tend to recount a positivist narrative with the rapid expansion of newborn care after WWII and the eventual logical uptake of endotracheal intubation and positive pressure resuscitation as the most effective method for treating <b>asphyxia</b> <b>neonatorum.</b> This thesis challenges this positivist narrative my examining the resuscitation of the newborn in Britain and America during the interwar period through to the late 1960 s. It uncovers a much more complex and non-linear narrative for the development of newborn resuscitation during the twentieth century, uncovering some interesting themes which the practitioner-histories have not addressed. These themes include the interactions between neonatal and fetal physiologists and their research with clinicians and clinical practice, and the role of new groups of clinicians, the paediatricians and anaesthetists, in newborn resuscitation during this period. Many of the practitioner-histories ridicule what they deem to be ‘failed’ resuscitation techniques, seeing them as ‘deveiations’ from the eventual widespread adoption of positive pressure methods. My analysis of both the clinical and scientific debates surrounding both the use of positive pressure methods and some of these ‘failed’ techniques provides a more complex and detailed story. Two techniques in particular, intragastric oxygen and hyperbaric oxygen, provide useful case-studies to reflect on the factors which influenced the development of newborn resuscitation during the twentieth-century. One important factor which is analysed in detail is the formation of a network of scientists and clinicians with a shared interest in the neonate, which emerged during the 1950 s. This ‘neonatal network’ has been identified and mapped, and its actions are discussed in detail. The thesis argues that the neonatal network played a fundamental role in directing neonatal research and care during the 1950 s and 1960 s. The case of newborn resuscitation is used to highlight the interactions of the network members. The history of newborn resuscitation is used to reflect on some wider themes of late-twentieth century medicine. It highlights the divided role of the post-war academic clinician, who was responsible for both clinical care and research. It also illustrates common trends such as the move towards super-specialization in medicine, the increasingly technological nature of medical care and the growing authority of science in the clinic. The research has analysed a variety of sources including the archives of the Ministry of Health, Medical Research Council, Scottish Home and Health Department, the Neonatal Society and National Birthday Trust Fund. Oral histories have been used to map the relationships forged between key actors. A variety of published resources, including journal articles, textbooks and conference proceedings, have also been studied to track both the changes in neonatal care and changes in the physiological understanding of the newborn.

30|$|Both Gram-positive and Gram-negative {{bacteria}} are increasingly becoming important both clinically and therapeutically as biological agents of ocular infections throughout the world. Various forms of ocular infections caused by pathogenic bacteria {{have been reported}} by different investigators. They include conjunctivitis, cornea perforation, orbital cellulitis, endophthalmitis, panophthalmitis and dacryocystitis, internal and external hordeolum, keratitis, scleritis, and canaliculitis [1 – 3]. Some of these infections carry poor prognosis as patients {{are at risk of}} losing either their sights or life, or both [2, 4]. This has necessitated the prompt detection of the etiologic agent and the timely institution of appropriate antibiotic treatment for patients with ocular infections. In Nigeria, conjunctivitis {{is one of the most}} common eye problems that affect all age groups. An epidemic of conjunctivitis was reported in Nigeria in 1971 [5]. In neonates, the incidence of conjunctivitis has been reported to be 18 per 1, 000 live births, and predisposing factors have been found to include vaginal delivery, <b>asphyxia</b> <b>neonatorum,</b> and prolonged rupture of the membrane [6]. A previous epidemiological study carried out by Abiose et al. [7] revealed conjunctivitis as among the causes of ophthalmic defects needing urgent medical attention in 10.4 % of the 5, 220 post-primary school Nigerian children screened. The routes of transmission of conjunctivitis have been identified to include air droplets, use of contaminated water for eye wash, hand to eye contact, and endogenous sources [2]. The pathology of conjunctivitis is symptomized by redness of the eye, grittiness, photophobia, and watery discharge. There may also be cornea involvement leading to subepithelial and epithelial keratitis. If untreated, conjunctivitis may degenerate pathologically to sight and life-threatening complications [8, 9]. Therefore, the early identification of etiologic agents and prompt institution of appropriate antibiotic therapy are essential for optimal eye care and restoration of a good eye health. Studies by investigators from other countries indicate that Gram-positive and Gram-negative {{bacteria are}} the most commonly isolated pathogens in patients with conjunctivitis, but variations exist in aetiologies, drug susceptibilities of pathogens, and antibiotic resistance mechanisms. Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, non-coagulase-positive Staphylococci, Bacillus sp., Corynebacterium sp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus viridans have been implicated as aetiologies of conjunctivitis in patients [8, 10, 11]. In Gram-negative-mediated conjunctivitis, pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus sp., Moraxella sp., and Neisseria gonorrhoeae have been isolated from conjunctival samples as etiologic agents [8, 12]. There are also indications that these pathogens elicit dynamism in order to achieve clonal success as agents of conjunctivitis coupled with their increasing propensity to develop resistance against the commonly used antibiotics in the form of eye drops and ointment to treat conjunctivitis. Plasmids, which are extrachromosomal double-stranded DNA materials, have been found to be useful for pathogens’ genetic diversity and prowess as infectious agents. Profiling pathogens for their harbored plasmids has been found to be very useful in epidemiological studies, diagnosis, and elucidation of mechanisms of drug resistance [13]. Plasmids have also been found useful in knowing whether two or more strains of a pathogen evolve from the same microorganism, thereby providing a reliable insight into the genetic relatedness of pathogens in an environment [14, 15].|$|E
40|$|Neonatal {{bleeding}} disorders (NBD) {{are common}} causes of {{morbidity and mortality}} at the neonatal unit, Muhimbili medical centre, Dar Es Salaam. However, no study has yet been done to determine the magnitude or the associated risk factors. Therefore a descriptive cross-sectional and case control study was carried out from January 22 nd to April 25 th, 1998 to determine the prevalence and risk factors associated with NBD. During this period a total of 1628 newborn infants were admitted to the neonatal ward and out of ~ these 589 babies ~ recruited into the study. One hundred seventy five infants (29. 9 %) with bleeding disorders were recruited as cases and 414 (70. 2 %) without evidence of bleeding as controls. Only infants where parental consent was obtained were included into the study. For each infant a thorough history was taken, physical examination done and a full blood picture together with coagulation profile determined. Twin babies were 18 (10. 3 %) of the study cases as compared to 46 (11. 1 %) in the controls. Singleton babies were 157 (89. 7 %) of the cases and 368 (88. 9 %) of the controls. The difference in bleeding status between twin and singleton infants was found not to be statistically significant (X 2 = 0. 09, P = 0. 76). Seventy nine (45. 1 %) of the study cases and 148 (35. 7 %) of the control cases were born with Low Birth Weight (LBW). The difference was statistically significant (X 2 = 4. 58, P = 0. 03). Furthermore 54 (30. 9 %) of the study cases and 95 (22. 9 %) of the controls were born prematurely and the' difference was statistically significant (X 2 = 4. 07, P = 0. 04). One hundred and eight (61. 7 %) of the cases and 199 (48. 1 %) of the controls were asphyxiated and the difference was highly significant (X 2 = 9. 18, P = 0. 002). In 27 (31. 4 %) of the cases and 121 (54. 8 %) of the III controls, the mother was given general anaesthesia during delivery. The difference was highly significant (X 2 = 13. 53, P = 0. 0002). The APGAR score was less than 7 in 86 (49. 1 %) of the cases and 124 (30 %) of the controls. The difference was highly significant (X 2 = 20. 43 p = 0. 00003). Fifty six (32 %) of the study group and 166 (40. 1 %) of the controls cases were delivered by a mode other than Spontaneous Vertex Delivery (SVD) and the difference was also highly significant (X 2 = 30. 97, p = 0. 0000008). The Prothrombin Time (PT) was prolonged in 5 (2. 9 %) of the cases and 13 (3. 4 %) of the controls, but the difference was not statistically significant (X 2 = 0. 56, P = 0. 7). The Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT) was also prolonged in 14 (8. 1 %) of the cases and 33 (8. 8 %) of the controls. However, the difference was also not statistically significant (X 2 = 1. 52, P = 0. 46). The proportion of infants with vitamin-K deficiency (crude prevalence) as judged by abnormal PT and APTT in the study population ranged between 2. 9 % to 8. 8 %, but the majority of them did not have any obvious bleeding clinically. The prevalence ofNBD was found to be 10. 7 % and that vitamin-K deficiency related bleeding was not a significant problem at the neonatal unit. However, large scale studies are needed to confirm this finding. <b>Asphyxia</b> <b>neonatorum,</b> LBW, mode of delivery other than SVD and general anaesthesia were the only risk factors significantly associated with bleeding...|$|E
