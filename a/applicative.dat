5|$|Most Nahuatl {{varieties}} have {{a number}} of ways to alter the valency of a verb. Classical Nahuatl had a passive voice (also sometimes defined as an impersonal voice), but this is not found in most modern varieties. However the <b>applicative</b> and causative voices are found in many modern dialects. Many Nahuatl varieties also allow forming verbal compounds with two or more verbal roots.|$|E
5|$|Mayan {{languages}} {{tend to have}} a rich set of grammatical voices. Proto-Mayan had {{at least}} one passive construction as well as an antipassive rule for downplaying the importance of the agent in relation to the patient. Modern K'iche' has two antipassives: one which ascribes focus to the object and another that emphasizes the verbal action. Other voice-related constructions occurring in Mayan languages are the following: mediopassive, incorporational (incorporating a direct object into the verb), instrumental (promoting the instrument to object position) and referential (a kind of <b>applicative</b> promoting an indirect argument such as a benefactive or recipient to the object position).|$|E
25|$|<b>Applicative</b> order: The rightmost, {{innermost}} redex {{is always}} reduced first. Intuitively {{this means a}} function's arguments are always reduced before the function itself. <b>Applicative</b> order always attempts to apply functions to normal forms, even when this is not possible.|$|E
30|$|Along {{this line}} of thought, Chang (2004) {{analyzes}} Tsou <b>applicatives</b> headed by -(n)eni as high <b>applicatives</b> and those headed by -i as low <b>applicatives.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Applicatives</b> {{may also}} be the only way of expressing such roles, as in the Bantu Chaga {{languages}}, where instrumental, benefactive, malefactive, and locative are formed solely by <b>applicatives.</b> In other languages <b>applicatives</b> coexist with other methods of expressing said roles. In these languages <b>applicatives</b> are often used to bring a normally oblique argument into special focus, or as in Nez Percé, to keep humans as core arguments.|$|R
50|$|<b>Applicatives</b> {{may be used}} in Ainu {{to place}} nouns in the dative, instrumental, comitative, locative, allative, or {{ablative}} roles. Besides freestanding nouns, these roles may be assigned to incorporated nouns, and such use of <b>applicatives</b> is in fact mandatory for incorporating oblique nouns. Like incorporation, <b>applicatives</b> have grown less common in the modern language.|$|R

25|$|<b>Applicative</b> {{order is}} not a {{normalising}} strategy. The usual counterexample is as follows: define Ω = ωω where ω = λx.xx. This entire expression contains only one redex, namely the whole expression; its reduct is again Ω. Since {{this is the only}} available reduction, Ω has no normal form (under any evaluation strategy). Using <b>applicative</b> order, the expression KIΩ = (λx.λy.x) (λx.x)Ω is reduced by first reducing Ω to normal form (since it is the rightmost redex), but since Ω has no normal form, <b>applicative</b> order fails to find a normal form for KIΩ.|$|E
25|$|The {{positive}} tradeoff {{of using}} <b>applicative</b> order {{is that it}} does not cause unnecessary computation, if all arguments are used, because it never substitutes arguments containing redexes and hence never needs to copy them (which would duplicate work). In the above example, in <b>applicative</b> order (λx.xx) ((λx.x)y) reduces first to (λx.xx)y and then to the normal order yy, taking two steps instead of three.|$|E
30|$|A cross-linguistic {{study of}} Chinese dialects further reveals three things: First, {{there is a}} clear path for high <b>applicatives</b> to develop even higher <b>applicatives</b> along {{syntactic}} projections, {{all the way to the}} left periphery. There is also a strong tendency for a Beneficiary to evolve into an Affectee when the applied relationship has shifted from the individual level to the eventual or even propositional level. Secondly, there is a plethora of “concealed” affective construals which border on the syntax of low <b>applicatives,</b> while patterning with high <b>applicatives</b> with respect to their thematic-semantic properties. This hybrid nature is not at all surprising from our view on middle <b>applicatives,</b> since they indeed stand in-between outer affectives and inner benefactives. Finally, the syntax-semantics mapping responsible for shaping the topography of Mandarin affectives/benefactives thus presents a compelling argument for our three-way distinction of <b>applicatives,</b> which in turn provides a cartographic perspective into the theory of argument introduction in general.|$|R
30|$|These locative construals {{therefore}} {{count as}} instances of low <b>applicatives.</b> As a result, we have secured some reliable tests at hand {{to map out}} the topography of <b>applicatives</b> across languages.|$|R
50|$|Circumstantials are conceptually {{similar to}} <b>applicatives,</b> which promote obliques to direct objects. However, <b>applicatives</b> may {{increase}} the valency of an intransitive verb by adding a direct object, while circumstantials cannot.|$|R

25|$|Multiple {{arguments}} against this, by Pylkkänen and by Hole, state otherwise. Pylkkänen's argument, about low applicatives and high applicatives, states {{that on a}} syntax tree level, low applicatives have an <b>applicative</b> morpheme below the verb in a sentence and involve an additional v, or pronoun maker. In looking at the German examples, (40) is deemed ungrammatical due to the possessor-raising and misplacement of the pronoun maker, or lack of a bound variable interpretation. To Pylkkänen, (39) is considered a low <b>applicative</b> sentence, and grammatical.|$|E
25|$|Hole's {{argument}} {{agrees with}} Pylkkänen's, {{stating that the}} dative argument would introduce a new head in between a VP and v, agreeing with Pylkkänen's low <b>applicative</b> theory.|$|E
30|$|Most of the {{previous}} studies on <b>applicatives</b> are concerned with accusative languages, notably Germanic languages like English and Bantu languages like Chichewa and Kichaga. It is less known how applicativization works in ergative languages. As an ergative language (Chang 2011 a), Tsou can illustrate how ergative <b>applicatives</b> are syntactically derived and how they differ from their accusative counterparts, thereby shedding new lights on the theory of <b>applicatives.</b>|$|R
30|$|It is thus {{concluded}} that an LA consistently extracts an IO in Tsou {{and that a}} Tsou LA prohibits the extraction of a DO. This is reminiscent of McGinnis’s non-phasal analysis of low <b>applicatives</b> in Kinyarwanda (see section McGinnis’s phase account of <b>applicatives).</b> It is also noteworthy that this conclusion holds true of double <b>applicatives,</b> where an LA is placed under an IA.

25|$|Lisp {{is usually}} {{evaluated}} eagerly. In Common Lisp, arguments are evaluated in <b>applicative</b> order ('leftmost innermost'), while in Scheme order of arguments is undefined, leaving room for optimization by a compiler.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to I/O, programming language researchers and Haskell library designers have successfully applied monads to topics including parsers and programming language interpreters. The concept of monads {{along with the}} Haskell do-notation for them has also been generalized to form <b>applicative</b> functors and arrows.|$|E
30|$|The {{next step}} is to see how Mandarin affectives should be encoded in {{syntactic}} structures. In the following discussion, I will attempt to show that the so-called high <b>applicatives</b> are not high enough, and there are even higher <b>applicatives</b> merged to the left periphery (or to the CP phase to the same effect). They display a cluster of properties typically associated with the information structure.|$|R

25|$|The verbal {{morphology}} of Hurrian {{is extremely}} complex, {{but it is}} constructed only through the affixation of suffixes (indicated by '-') and clitics (indicated by '='). Hurrian clitics stand for unique words, but are attached to other words {{as though they were}} suffixes. Transitivity and intransitivity are clearly indicated in the morphology; only transitive verbs take endings that agree with the person and number of their subject. The direct object and intransitive subject, when they are not represented by an independent noun, are expressed through the use of clitics, or pronouns (see below). Moreover, suffixes can be added to the verb stem that modify its meaning, including valency-changing morphemes such as -an(n)-- (causative), -ant (<b>applicative)</b> and -ukar (reciprocative). The meanings of many such suffixes have yet to be decoded.|$|E

Our main research hypothesis is that the acquisition of clitic “se” with some types of <b>applicatives</b> takes place in the later stages of the learning process, since it requires exposure to certain linguistic evidence to acquire a certain type of argument structure proper to <b>applicatives.</b> This study is going to be based on how our subjects perform using Grammaticality Judgment Tests (GJTs) ...|$|R
