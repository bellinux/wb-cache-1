25|$|Seventh-day Adventists have {{historically}} preached <b>a</b> <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> inherited weakness, but not <b>a</b> <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> inherited guilt.

According to Augustine and Calvin, humanity inherits not only Adam's depraved nature but also the actual guilt of his transgression, and Adventists look more toward the Wesleyan model.|$|E

25|$|The {{origins of}} the notion of reincarnation are obscure. Discussion of the subject appears in the {{philosophical}} traditions of India.

25|$|The Monsey Church {{was formed}} {{out of a}} split within the Dutch Reformed Church in America. Although earlier events {{also contributed to the}} split, the {{publication}} of the Rev. Conrad Ten Eyck's book Selections on the Atonement in 1818 was the chief cause. In this book, Ten Eyck advocated <b>a</b> <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> unlimited atonementcontrary to the Canons of Dort, one of the doctrinal standards of the Dutch Reformed Church. Asked to defend himself before the Classis of Montgomery meeting at Owasco, New York in 1819, he affirmed that he believed and preached <b>a</b> <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> the unlimited atonement of death of Jesus Christ on the cross. Notwithstanding that admission, Classis Montgomery failed to contradict or discipline Ten Eyck, whereupon the matter was appealed to the higher court of the church, the General Synod.|$|E

25|$|James Corum {{wrote that}} it was a myth that the Luftwaffe had <b>a</b> <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> terror bombing, in which civilians were {{attacked}} to break the will or aid the collapse of an enemy, by the Luftwaffe in Blitzkrieg operations. After the bombing of Guernica in 1937 and the Rotterdam Blitz in 1940, it was commonly assumed that terror bombing was a part of Luftwaffe doctrine. During the interwar period the Luftwaffe leadership rejected the concept of terror bombing in favour of battlefield support and interdiction operations.|$|E
25|$|Malcolm begins {{religious}} conversion as {{a disciple}} of Elijah Muhammad.

Malcolm X preaches <b>a</b> <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> separation from white society. However, a pilgrimage to Mecca softens his beliefs, teaching him that Muslims come from all races, even whites, and he endeavors to break free of the strict dogma of the Nation of Islam, with tragic results. He is assassinated on February 21, 1965, in New York City.|$|E

25|$|While a principle-based {{approach}} might {{claim that}} lying is always morally wrong, the casuist would argue that, {{depending upon the}} details of the case, lying might or might not be illegal or unethical. The casuist might conclude that a person is wrong to lie in legal testimony under oath, but might argue that lying actually is the best moral choice if the lie saves a life. (Thomas Sanchez and others thus theorized <b>a</b> <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> mental reservation, which developed into its own branch of casuistry.) For the casuist, the circumstances of a case are essential for evaluating the proper response.|$|E
25|$|Speke {{had earlier}} proven his mettle by {{trekking}} {{through the mountains}} of Tibet, but Burton regarded him as inferior as he did not speak any Arabic or African languages.

Speke appears to have been kinder and less intrusive to the Africans they encountered, and reportedly fell in love with an African woman on a future expedition.|$|E
