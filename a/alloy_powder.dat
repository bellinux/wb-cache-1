The microstructures of small size powders are extraordinarily undeveloped dendritic eutectic, in which the large majority of the α phase appears nearly spherical, evidently since the cooling rate is higher and the under-cooling is larger. As for the large size powders, since the cooling rate and undercooling are relatively low, lamellar α phase apparently increases in the eutectic microstructures of these powders, and there is even typical lamellar eutectic structure clearly observed in some micro-areas. After remelting tests by DTA, the microstructures of small size powders are transformed, which become composed of large crumby α phase and eutectic (α+β), while those of large size powders change into classical tin-lead structures of primary α phase plus lamellar eutectic (α+β).
