40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{identified}} the integrin alpha 4 beta 7 as a mucosal homing receptor that mediates lymphocyte migration to the intestinal mucosa by binding to MAd-CAM- 1, which is a vascular recognition molecule (<b>adressin)</b> selectively expressed on mucosal endothelium. The expression of the alpha 4 beta 7 mucosal homing receptor was studied in eight cases of malignant lymphomatous polyposis (MLP). This unusual presentation of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of mantle cell type is characterized by multifocal lymphomatous involvement of the gastrointestinal tract. Unlike nodal mantle cell lymphomas, cases of MLP showed expression of alpha 4 beta 7, suggesting that this homing receptor {{plays an important role}} in determining the characteristic mucosal dissemination pattern of ML...|$|E
40|$|Lymphocyte populations, {{adhesion}} molecule and cytokine expression were determined in lymph nodes draining peripheral (popliteal and prescapular) or mucosal (abomasal and jejunal) tissue sites using flow cytometry analysis, immunostaining and cytokine-specific reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Similar proportions of lymphocyte subpopulations {{were present in}} all lymph nodes except for immunoglobulin A+ (IgA+) B cells which were only present in significant numbers in the gastrointestinal lymph nodes. Peripheral lymph nodes contained a significantly higher number of CD 4 + cells expressing L-selectin and beta 1 -integrin than mucosal lymph nodes while the alpha 4 -integrin chain was expressed at similar levels in all lymph nodes. The peripheral node <b>adressin</b> recognized by the MECA 79 monoclonal antibody (mAb) was mainly expressed on peripheral lymph node vessels. RT-PCR analysis showed that interleukin (IL) - 10 and IL- 4 were preferentially induced in the gastrointestinal lymph nodes while IL- 2 and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) were induced in all lymph nodes after polyclonal stimulation. These results indicate that there are substantial differences in the cell populations and microenvironments of lymph nodes draining mucosal and peripheral tissue sites in adult sheep...|$|E
40|$|Colonization with {{commensal}} flora in {{very early}} life may profoundly influence intestinal lymphoid development and bias later immune responses. We defined gut-homing T cell phenotypes {{and the influence}} of flora on intestinal immune development in mice. Intestinal T cells were phenotyped and quantified in conventional (CV), germfree (GF) and conventionalized germfree (GF/CV) neonatal mice by immunohistochemistry. Mucosal <b>adressin</b> cell adhesion molecule 1 (MAdCAM- 1) was expressed by mucosal vessels at birth in CV and GF mice and was more prevalent in CV than GF small intestine, but was distributed similarly and did not change with age. Less MAdCAM- 1 was expressed in the colon; its distribution became restricted after weaning, with no difference between CV and GF mice. CD 3 +β 7 + cells were present in similar numbers in CV and GF intestine at birth. They were CD 62 L– in CV mice and were accompanied by further CD 3 +β 7 +CD 62 L– T cells as development progressed, but in GF and GF/CV intestine they expressed CD 62 L and numbers did not change. IEL numbers increased at weaning in CV mice in both small and large intestine, but showed delayed development in GF intestine. Macrophages were present at high levels from birth in GF intestine, but dendritic cells did not develop until day 16. Thus, fetus-derived T cells seed the intestinal lamina propria before birth via β–MadCAM interactions. Their activation status depends on the microbiological status of the dam, and without a commensal flora they remain naive. We propose that these cells regulate antigen responsiveness of the developing mucosal T cell pool...|$|E
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the contribution of integrin alpha 4 beta 7 to human peripheral blood eosinophil adhesive interactions. Immunofluorescence and flow cytometry demonstrated constitutive expression of alpha 4 beta 7 by eosinophils. Expression of alpha 4 beta 7 or alpha 4 beta 7 was not enhanced by eosinophil activation with platelet-activating factor (PAF). Expression of alpha 4 beta 7 was confirmed by immuno-precipitation of 125 I-labeled lysates analysed by sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS PAGE). Approximately 20 % of unstimulated eosinophils were adherent to L 1 - 2 cells transfected with vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1 (VCAM- 1) cDNA, while very few resting eosinophils adhered to mouse mucosal <b>adressin</b> cell adhesion molecule- 1 (MAdCAM- 1) transfectants. Binding of unstimulated eosinophils to VCAM- 1 transfectant was inhibited by HPI 2 (an antibody that blocks both alpha 4 beta 1 and alpha 4 beta 7 functions), but not Act- 1, and alpha 4 beta 1 monoclonal antibody (mAb). PAF stimulation resulted in increased binding of eosinophils to MAdCAM- 1 transfectants, which was inhibited by both HPI 2 and Act- 1. In contrast, PAF did not enhance binding to VCAM 1 transfectants, although binding of PAE-stimulated eosinophils to VCAM- 1 could be partially inhibited by Act- 1. Stimulation of eosinophils with the beta 7 -activating mAb TS 2 16 resulted in enhanced binding of eosinophils to both VCAM- 1 and MAdCAM- 1 transfectants. The increased binding was largely alpha 4 beta 7 -dependent. Unstimulated eosinophils bound to soluble recombinant human (rh) VCAM- 1 and fibronectin (Fn), coated on 96 -well plates in dose-dependent manner. Binding was inhibited by HPI- 2 and 4 b 4, an anti-beta 1 mAb, but not by Act- 1. TS 2 16 treatment increased adherent cell numbers and this enhanced binding was inhibited by Act- 1. We have therefore confirmed that alpha 4 beta 7 is functionally active on unstimulated eosinophils. In contrast, PAF-induced enhancement of eosinophils binding to VCAM- 1 or MAdCAM- 1 was alpha 4 beta 7 -dependent. In addition treatment with TS 2 16 resulted in a alpha 4 beta 7 -dependent enhancement of eosinophil binding to VCAM- 1, MAdCAM- 1 and Fn. We therefore hypothesize that alpha 4 beta 7 may {{have an important role}} in eosinophil localization in diseases such as asthma and inflammatory bowel disease...|$|E
