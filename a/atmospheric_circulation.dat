5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance formed on August 11 and gradually organized. The next day, an <b>atmospheric</b> <b>circulation</b> developed. Based on this, this system {{was classified as}} Tropical Depression Nine on August 13. The depression quickly intensified into a tropical storm and was named Hilary. The system gradually accelerated to the northwest and reached its peak strength on August 15 with winds of 60mph (95km/h). Tropical Storm Hilary then started a gradual weakening trend. It became a depression on August 16, turned {{a little bit more}} westward, and dissipated on August 17. Hilary never came near land, and as such caused no death or damage.|$|E
5|$|The El Niño–Southern Oscillation {{leads to}} changes in the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>circulation</b> {{patterns}} (also known as teleconnections). Although the exact mechanisms are unknown, the impacts of the changes in <b>atmospheric</b> <b>circulation</b> patterns caused by the El Niño–Southern Oscillation are more clearly observed in the more humid eastern parts of the country (between Uruguay and southern Brazil). During El Niño events, precipitation is more higher than normal while during La Niña events, precipitation is lower than normal in the Pampas. In general, El Niño tends to increase precipitation during late spring and summer, particularly in the north. The impacts of La Niña in the eastern parts of the country (northeast and the Pampas) are observed in winter where precipitation is lower. In Northwest Argentina, El Niño events are associated with a strong reduction in rainfall during summer. In contrast, La Niña events increase precipitation in northwest Argentina. In the central–western parts of Patagonia, spring precipitation tends to be lower during La Niña events and higher during El Niño events. Summer precipitation exhibits an opposite pattern where La Niña years involve wetter summers while El Niño years featuring drier summers. On the Andes in central western Argentina, precipitation is higher during El Niño year.|$|E
30|$|To {{examine whether}} these {{anomalous}} vertical <b>atmospheric</b> <b>circulations</b> were reinforced in high EASMI years, those circulations in 100 °– 180 °E where TCs mainly occur were averaged to analyze differences in vertical meridional <b>atmospheric</b> <b>circulations</b> {{between the two}} groups. Anomalous secondary circulations were formed in which air currents ascended in regions south to 25 °N and descended in 25 °– 40 °N. Because of the anomalous vertical meridional <b>atmospheric</b> <b>circulations</b> reinforced as such in high EASMI years, positive relative humidity anomalies were reinforced at all layers of the troposphere in regions south to 30 °N, while negative relative humidity anomalies were reinforced at all layers of the troposphere in 30 °– 45 °N. These conditions of anomalous vertical meridional <b>atmospheric</b> <b>circulations</b> and relative humidity became favorable environments for more TCs to occur in high EASMI years and have more effects on regions around Korea.|$|R

And the presence of cities cannot change the general state of the sea-land breeze (SLB) circulation and mountain-valley breeze (MVB) circulation but acted to modify these local circulations slightly.

Upon development, observations indicated that the system was quickly developing in favorable conditions, with initial reconnaissance flights finding a loose eye measuring 160km (100mi) in diameter shortly after classification as a tropical depression.

5|$|Solar {{radiation}} is {{absorbed by the}} Earth's land surface, oceans – which cover about 71% of the globe – and atmosphere. Warm air containing evaporated water from the oceans rises, causing <b>atmospheric</b> <b>circulation</b> or convection. When the air reaches a high altitude, where the temperature is low, water vapor condenses into clouds, which rain onto the Earth's surface, completing the water cycle. The latent heat of water condensation amplifies convection, producing atmospheric phenomena such as wind, cyclones and anti-cyclones. Sunlight absorbed by the oceans and land masses keeps the surface at an average temperature of 14°C. By photosynthesis, green plants convert solar energy into chemically stored energy, which produces food, wood and the biomass from which fossil fuels are derived.|$|E

5|$|The <b>atmospheric</b> <b>circulation</b> is {{controlled}} by the two semi–permanent South Atlantic and South Pacific highs, and the Chaco Low. During summer, the interaction between the South Atlantic High and the Chaco Low brings northeasterly and easterly winds that carry moisture to the region, particularly in the northern parts. The movement of moist air into the region during summer results in very high precipitation. Most of the precipitation comes from the east since the Andes block most moisture from the Pacific Ocean. Southern parts of the region are influenced by cold fronts travelling northward. These cold fronts are responsible for producing precipitation during summer. For example, in Tucumán Province, cold fronts are responsible for 70% of the rainfall in that province. Furthermore, the intertropical convergence zone (or doldrums) reaches the region during the summer months, leading to enhanced precipitation. During the winter months, the intertropical convergence zone, the South Pacific, and the South Atlantic highs move northward while the Chaco Low weakens, all of which results in the suppression of rain during the winter. With the Andes blocking most rain bearing clouds from the Pacific Ocean, along with <b>atmospheric</b> <b>circulation</b> patterns unfavourable for rain, this results in a dry season during winter. The Chaco Low attracts air masses from the South Pacific High, creating a dry and cold wind, particularly during winter. At the highest altitudes, westerly winds from the Pacific Ocean can penetrate during the winter months, leading to snowstorms.|$|E

As such, the end of winter is usually characterized by heavy storms with lightning. This is popularly known as the Santa Rosa Storm, around August 30. Based on 111 years of weather observations (1906–2016) from the central observatory, 61 years (55% of the time) have seen stormy weather occurring on days close to August 30, although not all of these have led to heavy precipitation.|$|E

5|$|Water vapor {{generated}} through {{surface evaporation}} is transported by circulatory {{patterns in the}} atmosphere. When atmospheric conditions permit an uplift of warm, humid air, this water condenses and falls to the surface as precipitation. Most of the water is then transported to lower elevations by river systems and usually returned to the oceans or deposited into lakes. This water cycle is a vital mechanism for supporting life on land and is a primary factor in the erosion of surface features over geological periods. Precipitation patterns vary widely, ranging from several meters of water per year to less than a millimeter. <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>circulation,</b> topographic features, and temperature differences determine the average precipitation that falls in each region.|$|E
5|$|In meteorology, {{winds are}} often {{referred}} to according to their strength, and the direction from which the wind is blowing. Short bursts of high speed wind are termed gusts. Strong winds of intermediate duration (around one minute) are termed squalls. Long-duration winds have various names associated with their average strength, such as , gale, storm, and hurricane. Wind occurs {{on a range of}} scales, from thunderstorm flows lasting tens of minutes, to local breezes generated by heating of land surfaces and lasting a few hours, to global winds resulting from the difference in absorption of solar energy between the climate zones on Earth. The two main causes of large-scale <b>atmospheric</b> <b>circulation</b> are the differential heating between the equator and the poles, and the rotation of the planet (Coriolis effect). Within the tropics, thermal low circulations over terrain and high plateaus can drive monsoon circulations. In coastal areas the sea breeze/land breeze cycle can define local winds; in areas that have variable terrain, mountain and valley breezes can dominate local winds.|$|E
5|$|Increased {{precipitation}} {{during the}} Tauca phase was probably {{triggered by the}} southern movement of the ITCZ and the strengthening of the South America monsoon, possibly caused by chilling in the northern hemisphere. Combined with a southern shift of high pressure zones, increased moisture during late glacial times would have flowed from the Amazon. This change, which occurred from 17,400–12,400 years or 18,000–11,000 BP, is recorded in Bolivian Chaco and Brazilian cave records. The Tauca phase may have been triggered by the southern shift of tropical <b>atmospheric</b> <b>circulation.</b> Although another theory posits that vegetation changes and lake development would have decreased the albedo of the Altiplano, resulting in warming and moisture advection of moisture towards the Altiplano, but such positive feedback mechanisms were considered questionable in a 1998 study. Persistent La Niña climatic conditions {{may have contributed to}} the lake's filling. Conversely, a global climatic warming and a northward shift of the monsoon occurred around 14,500 years ago. The ideal conditions for the development of paleolakes in the Altiplano do not appear to exist during maximum glaciation or warm interglacial periods.|$|E

On 5 February, the low–level <b>atmospheric</b> <b>circulation</b> center of Jasmine became exposed due {{to the presence of}} strong vertical wind shear. However, the cyclone was able to maintain its intensity due to the existence of an area of moisture over Australia. Throughout the rest of the day, the wind shear subdued, and the system began to organize as convective banding wrapped around the center. As a result, Cyclone Jasmine intensified into the equivalent of a Category2 on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale, with winds of 95km/h (60mph), sustained for 10minutes. The next day, Cyclone Jasmine began to track to the east-southeast in response to a strengthening subtropical ridge. The cyclone continued to steadily intensify as convection continued to wrap tightly around the center of Jasmine. At the same time, the storm moved out of the BOM's area of responsibility and into the area of responsibility of the Fiji Meteorological Service's (FMS) tropical cyclone warning center at Nadi, Fiji (RSMC Nadi).|$|E

On August16, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) started monitoring the disturbance for possible development. Initially, little development was expected due to its close proximity to land and Typhoon Ellis. The disturbance was poorly organized and the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>circulation</b> was exposed from the deep convection despite being located near an anticyclone, which tends to favor tropical cyclogenesis. On August20, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started tracking the disturbance. Later that day, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) also started monitoring the storm, assigning it with the local name Norming. After emerging into the South China Sea, the storm began to intensify. Later on the morning of August20, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) for the disturbance.

30|$|Some {{previous}} studies have classified regions depending {{on the characteristics of}} the long-term trend or IAV but they have not considered the regionality of seasonal transitions of precipitation. It can be assumed that variation of the SWM or the NEM has considerable effect on precipitation trends. For example, on the southwestern coast of southern India, summer monsoon rainfall is strongly related to the strength of SWM flow during the summer monsoon season, whereas the NEM flow makes only a small contribution to precipitation during the post-monsoon or winter season. In contrast, the NEM flow contributes considerably to the post-monsoon or winter precipitation around southeastern India. Therefore, it can be assumed that precipitation seasonality in each region of India is largely dependent on large-scale <b>atmospheric</b> <b>circulations</b> such as the SWM or the NEM. If this assumption were true, the regional long-term trends or IAVs defined by seasonal characteristics could be considered reasonable reflections of the tendencies of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>circulations.</b>|$|R

In this study, {{the relationship between the}} snow cover over East Europe and West Siberia (SC ES) and the number of haze days in December in central North China was analyzed. This relationship significantly strengthened after the mid- 1990 s, which is attributed to the effective connections between the SCES and the Eurasian <b>atmospheric</b> <b>circulations.</b> During 1998 – 2016, the SCES significantly influenced the soil moisture and land surface radiation, and then, the combined underlying drivers of enhanced soil moisture and radiative cooling moved the East Asia jet stream northward and induced anomalous, anti-cyclonic circulation over central North China. Modulated by such <b>atmospheric</b> <b>circulations,</b> the local lower boundary layer, the decreased surface wind and the more humid air were conducive to the worsening dispersion conditions and frequent haze occurrences. In contrast, from 1979 to 1997, the linkage between the SCES and soil moisture was negligible. Furthermore, the correlated radiative cooling was distributed narrowly and far from the key area of snow cover. The associated <b>atmospheric</b> <b>circulations</b> with the SCES were not significantly linked with the ventilation conditions over central North China.

5|$|Wind {{is caused}} by {{differences}} in the atmospheric pressure. When a difference in atmospheric pressure exists, air moves from the higher to the lower pressure area, resulting in winds of various speeds. On a rotating planet, air will also be deflected by the Coriolis effect, except exactly on the equator. Globally, the two major driving factors of large-scale wind patterns (the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>circulation)</b> are the differential heating between the equator and the poles (difference in absorption of solar energy leading to buoyancy forces) and {{the rotation of the}} planet. Outside the tropics and aloft from frictional effects of the surface, the large-scale winds tend to approach geostrophic balance. Near the Earth's surface, friction causes the wind to be slower than it would be otherwise. Surface friction also causes winds to blow more inward into low-pressure areas.|$|E
