5|$|A {{southern}} O-Bahn proposal {{attracted the}} most attention and {{has been the subject}} of various studies and Parliamentary Committees as to its viability since 1996. The rail route through Adelaide's far south is off-centre, without the large catchment area of a more central transport route. An O-Bahn running direct through the region would be able to take advantage of <b>an</b> <b>already</b> large population and the continuing growth in the area.|$|E
5|$|Hundreds of {{thousands}} of people lost their homes, but many took {{this as an opportunity to}} rebuild stronger houses.

5|$|It is {{said that}} Emperor Akbar (r. 15561605) who was enamored by Parveen's beauty had taken her to his palace in Agra to be his courtesan. But Parveen, who {{wanted to get out}} of the situation, {{composed}} a gazal or a couplet which stated her status as <b>an</b> <b>already</b> used woman not fit for an emperor, which enabled her to get release from Akbar's court and return to Orchha.|$|E

5|$|The ensuing {{economic}} and political crisis was arguably the worst since the country's independence. By the end of 2002, the economy had contracted by 20% since 1998. Over {{the course of two}} years, output fell by more than 15%, the Argentine peso lost three-quarters of its value, and registered unemployment exceeded 25%. Income poverty in Argentina grew from <b>an</b> <b>already</b> high 35.4% in October 2001 to a peak of 54.3% in October 2002.|$|E
5|$|The lyrics' {{reference}} {{to an extreme}} length of time is accentuated by the stretching out of <b>an</b> <b>already</b> slow 6/8 metre into 9/8, and, during the verses, by the appending of a measure-long instrumental tag after each two bars of vocal melody. Partly {{as a result of}} the absence of resolution in the home key, the descending bassline in the verses – a 4-3-2-1 sequence of notes mirroring the IV-iii-ii-I chord pattern – establishes an almost subliminal tonic.|$|E

5|$|An {{enhanced}} remaster titled Wild Guns: Reloaded {{was released}} for the PlayStation 4 in December 2016. The game {{was developed by}} the original team and features classic characters and stages but also enhancements such as more playable characters, enemies, stages, and local 4-player support. The game was made available for download on the PlayStation Store, and physical copies were available from Amazon, Play-Asia, and Video Games Plus. Critics praised the game for being a quality remaster of <b>an</b> <b>already</b> classic game. Natsume released Reloaded on Microsoft Windows in July 2017, marking the company's first ever release on the personal computer.|$|E
5|$|Anbe Vaa {{marked the}} first time AVM Productions had written a script to suit an actor's image and acting style; prior to this they had chosen actors to fit <b>an</b> <b>already</b> {{completed}} script. AVM Productions' founder A. V. Meiyappan's son M. Saravanan, one of the film's producers, recalled in 2013 that, as a fan of M. G. Ramachandran, it was his wish to see him act under the AVM banner. For several days he hesitated to tell his father about this choice, but when he did, he showed support. While Tirulokchandar was writing the script, Meiyappan suggested approaching Ramachandran for the lead role. Tirulokchandar found this intriguing, as the script's genre was dissimilar to what Ramachandran was noted for: action-adventure or social and family dramas which portrayed him as a champion for the downtrodden.|$|E
5|$|Ernst's rule, {{and that}} of his four Wittelsbach successors, {{strengthened}} the position of his family in Imperial politics. The victory of the Catholic party further consolidated the Counter-Reformation in the northwest territories of the Holy Roman Empire, especially in the bishoprics of Münster, Paderborn, Osnabrück and Minden, which were bordered by Protestant territories. Once Ernst's brother or such allies as the Duke of Parma regained control, Jesuits efficiently identified any recalcitrant Protestants and converted them to Catholicism. The Counter-Reformation was thoroughly applied in the lower Rhineland, with the goal that every Protestant, whether Lutheran or Calvinist, would be brought to the Catholic fold. For their efforts, the Spanish acquired important bridgeheads on the Rhine River, securing a land route to the rebellious northern provinces, which helped to extend <b>an</b> <b>already</b> long war of secession well into the next century.|$|E

5|$|Even {{before the}} {{extensive}} clearing of the Wheatbelt in the 1930s, B.cuneata {{must have had}} a highly fragmented distribution, since the deep yellow sand favoured by the species occurs only in patches, and makes up only 10 to 15% of the area. Around 93% of the land has now been cleared of native vegetation, with the remaining 7% occurring in remnants of various sizes. Thus land clearing must have further fragmented <b>an</b> <b>already</b> fragmented population, as well as greatly reduced the number of individual plants.|$|E
5|$|Following his death, {{his body}} was {{transferred}} to Constantinople and buried in the Church of the Holy Apostles there. His body survived the plundering of the city during the Fourth Crusade in 1204. Constantine was succeeded by his three sons born of Fausta, Constantine II, Constantius II and Constans. A number of relatives were killed by followers of Constantius, notably Constantine's nephews Dalmatius (who held the rank of Caesar) and Hannibalianus, presumably to eliminate possible contenders to <b>an</b> <b>already</b> complicated succession. He also had two daughters, Constantina and Helena, wife of Emperor Julian.|$|E
5|$|His father, disapproving of Darling's {{fondness for}} sport, sent {{him away from}} his cricket and Australian rules {{football}} teams to spend twelve months at Roseworthy Agricultural School. Later, Darling worked in a bank for a time and before his father appointed him manager of one of a wheat farm. Working on the farm added size and strength to <b>an</b> <b>already</b> stocky and athletic frame. He was selected for the South Australian team at age 19, but his father would not allow him time off the farm to play.|$|E

5|$|If a reborn {{is created}} from a kit {{as opposed to}} whole {{manufactured}} doll, it may be called newborning. Manufacturers have reacted to the growing trend of artists transforming dolls by hiring reborn artists to become doll sculptors and design doll molds and kits. When newborning from a kit, the first several steps of the process are completed by reborn sculpt artists and doll manufacturers. The kits come with <b>an</b> <b>already</b> disassembled baby and select supplies. Other supplies not provided in the kit can be purchased separately. The Secrist doll company started making Reborn Doll Kits in 2005. In 2009, they began producing supplies, tools, and tutorial videos specifically for reborning or newborning. JC Toys began selling kits in December 2007 Other suppliers offer product lines that give reborners a choice of body parts and skin tones to make a customized doll.|$|E
5|$|In 2010 fingolimod, a sphingosine-1-phosphate {{receptor}} modulator, {{became the}} first oral drug approved by the FDA, being followed in 2012 by teriflunomide, a drug that inhibits the synthesis of pyrimidine and disrupts the interaction of T cells with antigen presenting cell. Fingolimod and teriflunomide are taken through a daily single dose. In 2013 one further oral drug, dimethyl fumarate -or BG12- (which is an improved version of fumaric acid, <b>an</b> <b>already</b> existing drug), {{was approved by the}} FDA. Dimethyl fumarate is taken twice daily.|$|E
5|$|It is an {{amalgamation}} {{of design}} features from other revolvers {{made during the}} time period. The revolver has a design flaw in that the cylinder freewheels when not engaged, so during movement (such as in combat) it may rotate to <b>an</b> <b>already</b> fired chamber. Five distinct phases of production have different markings depending on the time and individual Type 26 produced. The 9mm Japanese revolver ammunition used is unique to the weapon. The Type 26 has a double-action only mechanism and is therefore difficult to aim accurately. The Type 26 {{was replaced by the}} Nambu pistol {{in the first half of}} the 20th century.|$|E
