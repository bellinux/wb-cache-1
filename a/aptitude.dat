5|$|As for Casler's third {{possible}} explanation for nominative determinism, genetics, researchers Voracek, Rieder, Stieger, and Swami found some evidence for it in 2015. They reported that today's Smiths still tend to have the physical capabilities of their ancestors who were smiths. People called Smith reported above-average <b>aptitude</b> for strength-related activities. A similar <b>aptitude</b> for dexterity-related activities among people with the surname Tailor, or equivalent spellings thereof, was found, {{but it was not}} statistically significant. In the researchers' view a genetic-social hypothesis appears more viable than the hypothesis of implicit egotism effects.|$|E

5|$|Arthur Dingle {{was born}} on 16 October 1891 at Hetton-le-Hole, County Durham, the eldest son of Beatrice (née Robson) and Reverend Arthur Trehane Dingle, Rector of Egglescliffe. He had a brother, Hugh John Dingle. Arthur {{attended}} Bow School, Durham and then Durham School, where he was head of school, and displayed an <b>aptitude</b> for cricket, gymnastics, rowing and rugby.

5|$|At age seven de Candolle {{contracted}} of {{a severe}} case of hydrocephalus, which significantly affected his childhood.

In 1794, he began his scientific studies at the Collège Calvin, where he studied under Jean Pierre Étienne Vaucher, who later inspired de Candolle to make botanical science the chief pursuit of his life.|$|E

50|$|However, Carlson and Behn {{did manage}} to report a {{significant}} breakthrough {{in the realm of}} sterics and migratory <b>aptitudes</b> as they relate to the TDR. As it might be expected based on electronic reasoning, the more highly substituted carbon should migrate preferentially to a less substituted carbon. However, this is not always seen and often accounts of migratory <b>aptitudes</b> show fickle preferences. Thus, the authors assert that such <b>aptitudes</b> are of little importance. Stericlly, thanks chiefly to improved spectroscopic methods, they were able to confirm that having the amine group equatorial to the alkane ring corresponded to drastically different product yields.|$|R

Though Fisher {{was not as}} hard working as Henry, he showed <b>aptitude</b> for science, mathematics, languages, art and music, inherited in part from his father's abilities. Encouraging their son's love of music, Fisher's parents gave him piano lessons; he also learned to play the guitar. It was during this period that Fisher developed an interest in amateur radio, constructing rudimentary spark transmitters and receivers.|$|E

50|$|According to Kealey and Protheroe (1996), {{the three}} most {{important}} ingredients to successful work overseas include the <b>aptitudes</b> and motivations of the expatriate and his immediate family, the <b>aptitudes</b> and motivation of the local counterparts and the overall organization of the project (p. 144). Therefore, while training is important, only a piece of one of the three aspects, expatriate’s personal <b>aptitudes,</b> can be altered by training. In addition, there needs to be recognition that training is meant to enhance abilities that are already there. Leaders need to come into training courses with abilities of their own and be open to alteration and growth from the training program.|$|R

When Mack was wounded early in the campaign, he was unable to take full charge of the army. Consequently, command further devolved to Lieutenant Field Marshal Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg, an able cavalry officer but inexperienced in the command of such a large army.|$|E

5|$|As a student, Kincaid showed {{exceptional}} <b>aptitude</b> for {{the natural}} sciences and achieved national attention for his scientific achievements. In 1897, while still an undergraduate, he accompanied David Starr Jordan to the Pribilof Islands {{as part of a}} study of seals undertaken by the American Fur Seal Commission. Back in Washington, Kincaid's interests focused more on insect life, and a report that year in the Boston Evening Transcript noted that he had discovered 41 new species of bees, including 22 of the genus Osmia. Theodore Dru Alison Cockerell, at the time one of America's leading entomologists, directed a portion of the sizable Kincaid bee collection to the Smithsonian Institution.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – Relative {{to other}} countries, {{the number of}} {{students}} in the US studying engineering is low. The numbers of women studying electrical and mechanical engineering have been persistently low relative to other engineering majors. For several years we have been measuring the electrical and mechanical <b>aptitudes</b> of electrical and mechanical engineers as part of a project to better understand hands-on ability. We have also examined connections between these <b>aptitudes</b> and academic performance indicators, spatial visualization ability, prior experiences, and engineering attitude. In fall 2010 we administered the same questionnaires and instruments to a group of non-engineering majors. The results provide some insight into the role that three factors [...] <b>aptitudes,</b> experiences, and attitude [...] play in...|$|R

5|$|Brudenell {{was a fine}} rider and, {{inspired}} by the decisive role of cavalry {{at the battle of}} Waterloo, his wish was to purchase a commission in a fashionable regiment and serve as an army officer. His father, however, mindful of preserving the family pedigree from risk of battle, would not allow this. Instead in November 1815 he was sent up to Christ Church, Oxford; as an aristocrat he was automatically granted admission without examination. He left in his third year—aristocrats with no academic bent were released after only two years—but despite showing some <b>aptitude,</b> he did not take a degree.|$|E
5|$|Conscience is an <b>aptitude,</b> faculty, intuition or {{judgment}} that assists in distinguishing right from wrong. Moral judgment may derive from values or norms (principles and rules). In psychological terms conscience {{is often described}} as leading to feelings of remorse when a human commits actions that go against his/her moral values and to feelings of rectitude or integrity when actions conform to such norms. The extent to which conscience informs moral judgment before an action and whether such moral judgments are or should be based in reason has occasioned debate through much of the history of Western philosophy.|$|E
