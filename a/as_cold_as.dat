25|$|Global {{temperature}} fell so {{low that}} the equator was <b>as</b> <b>cold</b> <b>as</b> modern-day Antarctica. This low temperature was maintained by the high albedo of the ice sheets, which reflected most incoming solar energy into space. A lack of heat-retaining clouds, caused by water vapor freezing out of the atmosphere, amplified this effect.|$|E

25|$|Upcountry Maui (Makawao, Pukalani, and Kula) at the 1,700- to 4,500-foot levels, {{provides}} mild heat (70s and low 80s) {{during the}} day and cool evenings.

25|$|The {{climate in}} {{sheltered}} parts of fjord areas (particularly the Altafjorden) is usually {{considered the most}} hospitable: winters are not <b>as</b> <b>cold</b> <b>as</b> in the interior, and summer warmth is comparable. Even if winter temperatures are milder in coastal areas, the coast is more exposed to winter storms, which often complicate or shut down road and air communications.|$|E
25|$|The {{first decade}} of the {{settlement}} on the Derwent River was a difficult one. Its geographic isolation, even from the other Australian settlement at Sydney, soon became apparent, and led to an air of despondency. The settlers initially struggled {{to come to terms with}} the environment of the new location, finding the summers hot and unbearable, and the winters nearly <b>as</b> <b>cold</b> <b>as</b> England.|$|E

25|$|Many {{possible}} triggering mechanisms {{could account}} for the beginning of a snowball Earth, such as the eruption of a supervolcano, a reduction in the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases such as methane and/or carbon dioxide, changes in Solar energy output, or perturbations of Earth's orbit. Regardless of the trigger, initial cooling results in an increase in the area of Earth's surface covered by ice and snow, and the additional ice and snow reflects more Solar energy back to space, further cooling Earth and further increasing the area of Earth's surface covered by ice and snow. This positive feedback loop could eventually produce a frozen equator <b>as</b> <b>cold</b> <b>as</b> modern Antarctica.|$|E
25|$|Relatively speaking, Bucks County {{experiences}} warm/hot {{and humid}} summers with chilly/cold and somewhat snowy winters. Episodes of high humidity (dew point >= 70°F) occur every year during {{or close to}} the summer months, very occasionally reaching extreme (dew point >= 75°F) levels. When high-to-extreme humidity combines with air temperatures in the mid-upper 90's, dangerous heat index values of >= 105°F can sometimes result. Winter minimum air temperatures occasionally fall into the single-digits to slightly below-0°F. When the coldest temperatures combine with higher winds, wind chill values can sometimes plummet below-0°F to <b>as</b> <b>cold</b> <b>as</b> -20°F. Spring and fall are comparatively tranquil. The climate cools as one moves from the lower elevation, dense suburban areas in southern Bucks, to the higher elevation, rural areas of northern Bucks. Precipitation is fairly well-distributed throughout the year. The average seasonal snowfall, which can potentially occur from as early as October to as late as April, is around 2 feet in extreme southern Bucks, and around 3 feet in the highest elevations of far northern Bucks. The fall foliage season typically peaks in mid-October in northern Bucks, mid-late October in central Bucks, and late-October / early-November in southern Bucks. These dates correlate with the typical date of first freeze. Peak spring foliage usually occurs {{during the month of}} April, which correlates with the typical date of last freeze.|$|E

Kiprusoff became the first goaltender in NHL history to record a shutout at an outdoor game, and his play remained strong following the Heritage Classic, as he shut the Blues out in back-to-back games on February 27 and March 1. He then became the first goaltender in 25 years to stop two penalty shots in one game to lead the Flames to a 4–3 win over the Blue Jackets on March 4 as the Flames moved into fifth place in the West. Two nights later, Iginla scored his 30th goal of the season on a penalty shot against Pekka Rinne of the Nashville Predators. In doing so, he became the 10th player in NHL history to score at least 30 goals in ten consecutive seasons.|$|E

500|$|Although {{there were}} no factors {{inhibiting}} the development of Celia, the storm unexpectedly weakened again later on June23. The storm's eye rapidly dissipated and the central dense overcast became asymmetric. Forecaster Todd Kimberlain at the NHC referred to the unexplained shifts in strength as [...] "puzzling." [...] However, as suddenly as the weakening took place, strengthening ensued. Very strong convection formed over {{the center of the}} storm, with some cloud tops being <b>as</b> <b>cold</b> <b>as</b> , but no eye had reformed by the morning of June24. Throughout the day, Celia became increasingly organized, with the eye fully reforming and the structure becoming more symmetrical. Rapid intensification soon followed as the storm reached Category4 status, becoming {{one of only a handful}} of tropical cyclones to do so during the month of June in the eastern Pacific. That evening, the storm further intensified into a Category5 hurricane, the second storm to reach this strength during June in the Eastern Pacific basin on record. Hurricane Celia attained its peak intensity around 0000UTC, with sustained winds of 160mph (260km/h) and a barometric pressure estimated at 921mbar (hPa; 27.2inHg). The storm also displayed a well-defined eye estimated to be [...] in diameter.|$|E
500|$|The {{shape of}} a {{snowflake}} is determined primarily by the temperature and humidity at which it is formed. The most common snow particles are visibly irregular. Freezing air down to [...] promotes planar crystals (thin and flat). In colder air down to , the crystals form as needles, hollow columns, prisms or needles. In air <b>as</b> <b>cold</b> <b>as</b> , shapes become plate-like again, often with branched or dendritic features. At temperatures below , the crystals becomes plate-like or columnar, depending {{on the degree of}} saturation. As Nakaya discovered, shape is also a function of whether the prevalent moisture is above or below saturation. Forms below the saturation line trend more towards solid and compact. Crystals formed in supersaturated air trend more towards lacy, delicate and ornate. Many more complex growth patterns also form such as side-planes, bullet-rosettes and also planar types depending on the conditions and ice nuclei. If a crystal has started forming in a column growth regime, at around , and then falls into the warmer plate-like regime, then plate or dendritic crystals sprout {{at the end of the}} column, producing so called [...] "capped columns".|$|E
