Epididymal and subcutaneous adipose tissues were harvested from 32 -wk old obese Otsuka Long Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) and lean Long Evans Tokushima Otsuka (LETO) rats. Cultured rat aortic endothelial cells were treated for 24  h with media conditioned with LETO subcutaneous <b>adipocytes</b> (LSA), OLETF subcutaneous <b>adipocytes</b> (OSA), LETO epididymal <b>adipocytes</b> (LEA), and OLETF epididymal <b>adipocytes</b> (OEA). The amount of key adipokines secreted by ATs was measured in the supernatant fluid with ELISA and mRNA levels of a number of pro- and anti-atherogenic genes were assessed in treated endothelial cells via quantitative real-time PCR. Compared to <b>adipocytes</b> from other depots, secretion of leptin and TNFα was highest and vaspin secretion was lowest from OEA. However, endothelial cells treated with OEA conditioned media exhibited lower expression of several pro-atherogenic genes.

40|$|International audienceIt is well {{established}} now that adult humans possess active brown adipose tissue (BAT) which represents a potential pharmacological target to combat obesity and associated diseases. Moreover thermogenic brown-like <b>adipocytes</b> ("brite adipocytes") appear also in mouse white adipose tissue (WAT) upon β 3 -adrenergic stimulation. We had previously shown that human multipotent adipose-derived stem cells (hMADS) are able to differentiate into cells which exhibit the key properties of human white <b>adipocytes,</b> and then to convert into functional brown <b>adipocytes</b> upon PPARγ activation. In light of a wealth of data indicating that thermogenic <b>adipocytes</b> from BAT and WAT have a distinct cellular origin, we have characterized {{at the molecular level}} UCP 1 positive hMADS <b>adipocytes</b> from both sexes as brite <b>adipocytes.</b> Conversion of white to brown hMADS <b>adipocytes</b> is dependent on PPARγ activation with rosiglitazone as the most potent agonist and is inhibited by a PPARγ antagonist.

So far no primary or clonal precursor cells of human brown <b>adipocytes</b> have been obtained that {{can be used as a}} tool to develop therapeutic drugs and to gain further insights into the molecular mechanisms of brown adipogenesis in humans.

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of {{type 2 diabetes}} and insulin resistance has risen dramatically over the last decades. Excess energy intake resulting in obesity and dysregulation of white adipose tissue (WAT) are important factors contributing {{to the development of}} these metabolic diseases. The objective of this thesis was to investigate the role of adipocyte-expressed Fas (CD 95) in the development of obesity-induced insulin resistance. In addition, insulin sensitivity of large and small <b>adipocytes</b> of obese white adipose tissue was investigated and compared. Activation of the Fas signalling pathway in cultured 3 T 3 -L 1 <b>adipocytes</b> leads to increased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL- 6 and KC (murine analogue of IL- 8). Moreover, Fas activation in 3 T 3 -L 1 <b>adipocytes</b> has negative effects on insulin sensitivity as shown by reduced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. In vivo, Fas expression is increased in isolated <b>adipocytes</b> of insulin resistant mice and in adipose tissue of obese and diabetic patients. Adipocyte-specific Fas-knockout (AFasKO) mice were partly protected from HFD-induced deterioration of glucose homeostasis, and their levels of pro-inflammatory factors in WAT were reduced. Moreover, AFasKO mice did not develop hepatic steatosis and maintained hepatic insulin sensitivity. Thus, Fas activation in <b>adipocytes</b> contributes to adipose tissue inflammation, hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance induced by obesity. Hypertrophic <b>adipocytes,</b> a consequence of obesity, are known to secrete higher amounts of pro-inflammatory factors compared to small <b>adipocytes.</b> Thus, we hypothesized that large <b>adipocytes</b> may be more insulin resistant. Interestingly, we found that insulin sensitivity did not differ between small and large <b>adipocytes</b> isolated from the epididymal fat pad of obese mice. However, large <b>adipocytes</b> secreted higher amounts of free fatty acids (FFA) compared to small <b>adipocytes</b> under basal conditions. In conclusion, “dysregulated” <b>adipocytes</b> in obese white adipose tissue {{contribute to the development of}} local and/or systemic insulin resistance. Large, lipid loaded <b>adipocytes</b> secrete higher amount of FFA, which might negatively affect insulin sensitivity. Moreover, the Fas (CD 95) pathway is up-regulated in obesity and seems to contribute to local and systemic insulin resistance via changes in the secretion pattern of cytokines...|$|R

Dexamethasone (1 mu M) significantly stimulated the proliferation of brown preadipocytes and reduced that of white preadipocytes. During differentiation, dexamethasone (at 0. 1, 1, and 10 mu M) stimulated the expression of UCP 1, CIDEA, and PPARGC 1 A in a concentration-dependent manner and enhanced by fourfold to sixfold the OCR of brown <b>adipocytes.</b> Isoprenaline (100 nM) significantly increased (P < 0. 05) expression of UCP 1 and OCR of brown <b>adipocytes.</b> These effects were significantly reduced (P < 0. 05) by dexamethasone.

In subcutaneous preadipocyte-derived <b>adipocytes</b> from non-obese and obese patients, metformin alone increased glucose uptake to 2. 7 +/- 0. 2 (p > 0. 001) and 2. 1 +/- 0. 1 fold (p > 0. 001) respectively. Metformin increased glucose uptake in visceral preadipocyte-derived <b>adipocytes</b> from non-obese (1. 7 +/- 0. 1 fold vs. basal, p > 0. 001) and obese (2. 0 +/- 0. 2 fold vs. basal, p > 0. 001) patients.
