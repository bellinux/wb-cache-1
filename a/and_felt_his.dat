5|$|Within {{weeks of}} the {{election}} Barber was moved from the FCO to the Treasury to take over as Chancellor from Iain Macleod, who died suddenly on 20 July. Though they had never enjoyed an easy relationship, Douglas-Home recognised his colleague's stature, <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> loss politically as well as personally. Some commentators have maintained that Macleod's death and replacement by the less substantial figure of Barber fatally undermined the economic success of the Heath government.|$|E
5|$|As {{introduced}} in Soulcalibur II, Necrid is a warrior who fought and defeated a former wielder of the cursed sword Soul Edge, and was {{pulled into the}} dimension where the sword's spirit, Inferno, inhabited. Instead of battling Inferno, he fled, and became trapped in the dimension for years. Warped physically and mentally by the dimension as a result, he escaped during the closing events of Soulcalibur, but quickly found that, without the dimension's energies, he experienced intense pain and would eventually die. Attacking travelers he perceived as enemies, he happened upon a fragment of Soul Edge <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> pain dampened. Pursuing other fragments of the sword, he encountered Talim, who was also seeking them, and helped defeat the resurrected Inferno. His memories and sanity restored by the battle, Necrid closed {{the entrance to the}} void, trapping himself within.|$|E
5|$|Founding {{member and}} lead singer Peter Gabriel {{decided to leave}} Genesis in late 1974, midway through the tour for the album The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway. The other members hoped he would reconsider, as {{they were still in}} debt <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> {{departure}} could destroy the band's future, but ultimately accepted that he would leave. The remaining members felt they still wanted to collaborate musically, and show journalists and critics they were primarily a song writing team that could still produce good music. Keyboardist Tony Banks had been close to Gabriel personally, and did not want the band to split up on top of seeing less of one of his best friends. He had written a number of songs for a possible solo project before deciding they should be used on the new Genesis album.|$|E

5|$|Sutil {{was given}} a 20-second time penalty by the {{stewards}} as he was deemed to gain an advantage by taking the outside line at turn seven on the first lap. This demoted him from eighth to tenth, and promoted Hülkenberg from ninth to eighth and Massa from tenth to ninth. Following a protest from Force India, Hülkenberg was issued a 20-second time penalty after the stewards deemed him to have gained an advantage by corner cutting. This ruling meant Hülkenberg was demoted to tenth while Massa moved up to eighth and Sutil inherited ninth. Force India withdrew an appeal of Sutil's penalty following the decision, and Williams technical director Sam Michael said that his team had accepted the stewards' judgement. The stewards elected not to penalise Senna after examining a video of his collision with the stationary Kobayashi. Kobayashi admitted {{that he was at}} fault for his retirement and Senna believed the marshals were late reacting to Kobayashi's accident <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> own accident was unavoidable.|$|E
5|$|Saturday afternoon's {{qualifying}} session {{lasted for}} an hour. Each driver {{was limited to}} twelve laps, with the starting order decided by the drivers' fastest laps. During this session the 107% rule was in effect, requiring each driver to remain within 107% of the fastest lap time {{to qualify for the}} race. The session was held in dry weather conditions. Montoya clinched his second consecutive pole position and his third of the season with a time of 1:22.216. Although he was happy with the feel of his car, he did not feel confident that he could take pole position. Montoya was joined on the front row by Barrichello who recorded a lap 0.312 seconds slower and also went off into a gravel trap during qualifying. Michael Schumacher qualified third and admitted to making a mistake on his third run which prevented him from setting a quicker time. Ralf Schumacher had balance issues which meant his car alternated between understeer and oversteer en route to fourth position. He also managed three clear runs before his fourth was disrupted by a yellow flag. Trulli qualified fifth and was delighted with his car and tyres. Coulthard qualified in sixth position <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> car's balance was good although felt it difficult to push hard and achieve ideal grip. Häkkinen took seventh and ran wide at the exit of Curva di Lesmo on his final timed run and crashed heavily into a barrier which resulted in a large amount of damage to the front and left side of his car. Häkkinen was unhurt but the crash caused qualifying to be suspended for thirteen minutes.|$|E
25|$|Toole's highly cultured {{mother was}} a {{controlling}} woman, especially with her son. His father was less involved and sometimes complained of his lack of influence in their child's upbringing. Despite this, {{he and his father}} bonded through a mutual interest in baseball and cars. Toole's mother chose the friends he could associate with, <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> cousins on his father's side were too common for him to be around. Toole received high marks in elementary school and, from a young age, expressed a desire to excel academically. He skipped ahead a grade, from first to second, after taking an IQ test at the age of six.|$|E

25|$|Moore {{was born}} on February 13, 1922, in Bardstown, Kentucky, the eldest of four {{children}} born to Harold, Sr. and Mary (Crume) Moore. His father was an insurance agent whose territory covered western Kentucky {{and his mother was}} a homemaker. Because he was interested in obtaining an appointment to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> chances were better if he was located in a larger city, he left Kentucky at the age of seventeen before finishing high school and got a job in Washington, D.C. working in the U.S. Senate book warehouse. Moore finished high school at night while working days and graduated from St. Joseph Preparatory School in Bardstown with the class of 1940. Moore attended George Washington University at night for two years, working at his warehouse job while waiting on an appointment to West Point. During his time at George Washington University he was initiated into the Kappa Sigma Fraternity. After President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed legislation authorizing each senator and representative additional appointments to the military and naval academies, Moore was offered an appointment to the United States Naval Academy by Representative Ed Creal (4th District, Kentucky) but Moore had no desire to go to the Naval Academy. Moore asked Creal if he could find another congressman that would trade his Military Academy appointment for Creal's Naval Academy appointment would he be agreeable to that arrangement. Creal agreed, and Moore soon found Representative Eugene Cox of Georgia's 2nd Congressional District, with an open appointment to West Point. Cox was impressed with Moore's tenacity and he left Cox's office with the West Point appointment.|$|E
25|$|Kvyat was {{the fastest}} driver not to advance {{into the final}} {{qualifying}} session; his fastest time of one minute and 26.070 seconds was {{one and a half}} seconds off Hamilton's pace in the second session. However, he received a ten-place grid penalty for changing his engine overnight, his sixth of the season. As a result, Räikkonen moved into eleventh. Räikkonen struggled with car grip and locked his front tyres, abandoning his first timed lap because cars leaving the pit lane hindered his visibility entering the Rettifilo chicane, and after preparing for his second attempt, he locked his right-front wheel and ran into the run-off area. Jean-Éric Vergne started from 12th with Hülkenberg unable to match his teammate's pace in 13th because he was delayed by slower traffic while preparing his for his lap at Parabolica <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> car was loose. Sutil had problems driving but gradually improved his car's balance as he circulated the track and improved on his final lap to secure 14th, ahead of teammate Esteban Gutiérrez who made a slight error on his final lap. Maldonado failed to advance beyond the first qualifying session, with teammate Grosjean managing five laps after missing the opening 13 minutes while his team repaired a fluid leak discovered before qualifying. Kobayashi slipstreamed teammate Marcus Ericsson to move ahead of Jules Bianchi for 18th, with Bianchi not improving as he slid sideways through the Ascari chicane and other drivers set faster lap times on the medium compound tyres. His teammate Max Chilton qualified 20th and Ericsson completed the field in 22nd; the latter was hindered {{due to a lack of}} decent running on the medium compound tyres following an engine problem in the third practice session.|$|E

500|$|Graham praised {{his opponents}} – [...] "There {{is no need}} to take {{anything}} away from Liverpool because they were terrific," [...] <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> team could have been more clinical. He described Arsenal's performance as [...] "below par" [...] and was upbeat about the season ahead: [...] "This might have done us the world of good. We will be all right by next week – don't worry about that." ...|$|E
500|$|Describing {{the real}} Seymour Skinner, Keeler remarked, [...] "It {{would have been}} easy to make him a really horrible, nasty, dislikeable guy, but we didn't do that. We made him just not quite right, not quite Skinner, and a little bit off." [...] Bill Oakley said the idea behind the {{character}} was that he [...] "just lacked pizzazz". The producers selected Martin Sheen to voice the character because they admired his performance in Apocalypse Now <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> voice would be appropriate for a Vietnam veteran.|$|E
500|$|Arsenal captain Patrick Vieira {{revealed}} {{his intention to}} stay at the club, despite interest from Chelsea, who had been acquired by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich in the summer. Manager Arsène Wenger used his press conference to look ahead to the new season <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> team's chances were as good, if not better than Chelsea's: [...] "I can understand that we look a little bit poor and out of shape but what is important is what happens on the pitch and you will see that we look good. To write us off just because we haven't spent £100million is a bit easy." ...|$|E

500|$|Chelsea’s victory {{meant they}} won the trophy for the sixth time. Mourinho was delighted to have won the League Cup <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> team {{deserved}} to win on balance of play. He credited his opponents, with a sly dig: [...] "A special word for them – they played very good. They have a great coach, great players – but football is about winning and the cup goes to us." [...] He was disappointed by the fracas and pointed out it {{was born out of}} Arsenal's frustration, though stressed [...] "We cannot kill a player because something happened." [...] Mourinho took time out to praise Arsenal’s medical staff for attending to Terry after his concussion and absolved Diaby from any fault.|$|E
500|$|Liverpool's {{performance}} {{was greeted with}} applause from both sets of supporters as Phil Thompson led his team up to the Royal Box to receive the Charity Shield. Paisley was delighted with the manner of his team's win and quipped, [...] "I am just sorry we didn't get two points for it!" [...] He praised the Wembley surface and said of McDermott's first goal [...] " [...] captured what {{we are looking for}} – the run, the control and the finish were perfect." [...] Arsenal manager Terry Neill described the match as a [...] "great advertisement for football" [...] <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> side contributed greatly in periods. Of his opponents, he said: [...] "Liverpool are a smashing side and I don't expect to meet anyone better this season." [...] Indeed, Liverpool went on to retain the First Division title, withstanding pressure from Manchester United and ending their league campaign on 60 points. Arsenal finished three places behind in fourth, and reached the finals of the FA Cup and UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, only to end the season empty-handed.|$|E
500|$|Andretti {{appeared}} in victory lane {{and later on}} the podium to celebrate his first victory {{of the season in}} front of the crowd; the win earned him $100,000. He was delighted to take the victory: [...] "Just an awesome day, a perfect day for Team Motorola, they did an awesome job,", and, [...] "This is a big one, I'll tell you that. After the first lap, I thought the race was over for us. But it was a hard fought race". Tagliani, who finished in second place, stated it was a [...] "good day" [...] for his team and hoped he could continue his recent successes. Third-place finisher Fernández said it was a [...] "great day" [...] for himself and his team but was disappointed as he felt he could have won the race because of a problem at his final pit stop. However, he felt if his team kept building their momentum, and he believed he could challenge for more strong finishes and race victories. Zanardi was pleased with his fourth-place finish, saying it was more fun than at the previous round (the Grand Prix of Cleveland) <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> engineers were helping him to build a competitive car despite his poor qualifying performances.|$|E

500|$|The {{stewards}} elected not to {{take any}} action over the incident between Prost and Heidfeld on the race's 44th lap. Heidfeld believed {{the origins of the}} accident came from both Andretti cars being released under the minimum pit stop time, saying he drove onto the pit lane alongside Félix da Costa and ceded the position to the Andretti driver. He additionally stated that Bird was also involved and remained ahead of him. Prost was resolute that the contact was avoidable had he been given enough space by Heidfeld. He was confident the stewards would agree with his point of view. [...] "I was on the kerb and he did not leave me any room at all when I was at his side", he said. Evans thought after he was hit by Rosenqvist, he could not finish the race <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> Jaguar would not survive such a collision in a similar scenario. Nevertheless, he was delighted with his first points-scoring finish in the series, saying: [...] "Those first points are always the hardest. We know we've not got the best package but we're making great progress and everyone should be really proud." [...] Jaguar team principal James Barclay said the incident was the moment when [...] "our hearts sunk". He felt there was no possibility of finishing the race but praised the strength of the Jaguar's monocoque.|$|E
500|$|Alan Stanley Blair of Airlock Alpha {{gave the}} episode a mixed review. He {{felt it was}} {{refreshing}} to have a story about aliens that weren't invading and opined that [...] "the brutal scenes at the abattoir and the whale-like moans of agony from the beast tug on a few heartstrings." [...] However, he criticised the realisation of the alien describing it as [...] "basically a giant, moaning turd {{sitting in the middle}} of a warehouse" [...] and [...] "a large lump of putty with eyes". He felt that the episode gave Rhys [...] "a chance to step into the spotlight for a change and prove he has what it takes to carry a story" [...] <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> reaction to the existence of aliens to be [...] "perhaps the most realistic that the genre has produced". Despite this, he felt that Rhys finding out about Torchwood put an end to the [...] "fun" [...] of Gwen [...] "keeping secrets and concealing her double life" [...] and expressed disappointment that Jack didn't wipe his memory at the end of the episode. Travis Fickett of IGN rated the episode 7.6 on a one to ten scale and felt it provided a [...] "messy, odd and somewhat unsettling twist on alien encounters" [...] but felt the episode had several weak points. He felt it was hard not to see Rhys as [...] "a buffoon" [...] and questioned why Torchwood would use a civilian during a sting operation. He also felt that it pushed [...] "beyond the limits of its capacity to create convincing special effects" [...] and the creature itself looked like [...] "a hand puppet". Andrew Mickel of Den of Geek felt that Rhys has always been the [...] "Welsh heart of the show" [...] and praised his role in the episode for being [...] "actually rather entertaining, approaching everything with invigorating gusto." [...] However he also criticised the denouement of the episode for being [...] "daftly mawkish" [...] and opined that [...] "it’s always impossible to care about CGI characters".|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to Japanese musicians, several Irish artists contributed to Creid, including uilleann piper Davy Spillane—formerly of Moving Hearts and Riverdance—and Máire Breatnach, {{who had previously}} played fiddle on another Square album, Final Fantasy IV Celtic Moon. Mitsuda also asked guitarist Tomohiko Kira and singer Yoko Ueno to appear to the album after an acquaintance introduced him to them. [...] Hidenobu [...] "KALTA" [...] Ootsuki worked on the album as an arranger <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> work was made easier by his familiarity with Mitsuda's music—Creid was his second arrangement project with Mitsuda, after , which he had worked on three years before. According to Ootsuki, Mitsuda and he were complementary in style, which resulted in an album leaving {{a lot of space}} and freedom for the listeners' imagination. He felt that, since Chrono Trigger, Mitsuda's musical style had changed to use less [...] "strong" [...] notes and include more sophistication; upon hearing the Xenogears tracks he [...] "literally" [...] "couldn't wait" [...] to arrange them. Mitsuda has described their collaborative style as that he would first create the [...] "basic backbone" [...] of the song and form the idea of how he wanted the song [...] "to turn out", then take the result to Ootsuki for them to arrange together. The end result would then be changed in the process of recording, as [...] "what sounds good on a synth module doesn't always sound good on live instruments", and occasionally the recording artists would [...] "ad-lib" [...] parts that would make it into the final product. Mitsuda generally also chose the specific percussion instruments to be used while recording, rather than beforehand; he feels that [...] "as long as the final product turns out to be like what I want it to be, the process doesn't really matter too much". As working with the other artists gave him a sense of celebration, Mitsuda named the [...] "imaginary band" [...] of performers Millennial Fair and credited them as such in the album.|$|E
