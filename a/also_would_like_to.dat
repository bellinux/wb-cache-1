50|$|In {{addition}} {{to the ability to}} describe concepts formally, one <b>also</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> employ the description of a set of concepts to ask questions about the concepts and instances described. The most common decision problems are basic database-query-like questions like instance checking (is a particular instance (member of an A-box) a member of a given concept) and relation checking (does a relation/role hold between two instances, in other words does a have property b), and the more global-database-questions like subsumption (is a concept a subset of another concept), and concept consistency (is there no contradiction among the definitions or chain of definitions). The more operators one includes in a logic and the more complicated the T-box (having cycles, allowing non-atomic concepts to include each other), usually the higher the computational complexity is for each of these problems (see Navigator on Description Logic Complexity for examples).|$|E

Rohan has two double agents working within the Ducos operation. Jacques-Pierre Dumais {{is one of the}} double agents working for the Duke, who works in Grantville as a garbage collector while secretly examining 20th century knowledge that are discarded by the American residents.

Sharda has brought up her sons {{with a lot}} of love and affection and both have the same good nature, {{character}} and habits - so much so that they both {{fall in love with the}} same young woman, Chinar, who is the daughter of Sukhdev, and Laxmi. Raja loves Chinar and shows his love in his own style, but Chinar misunderstands this, for she has given her heart to Rahul. Chinar hopes that Raja, who is the elder of the two, gets married soon, so that her and Rahul's marriage takes place. Misunderstandings galore, as Sharda and Raja think the proposal is for Raja, while Rahul, Sukhdev, Laxmi, and Chinar know the truth. When the truth comes out in the open, it does cause considerable friction between the brothers. Taking advantage of this are Thakur Bhanu Pratap and Mama, who <b>also</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> marry Chinar. Then Sharda tells her sons to unite and fight against the man who killed her husband. Will her sons give up their differences to avenge their father's death, or will they each go their own way and avenge it in their own style, knowing fully well that only one can marry Chinar ...|$|E
50|$|In Section 205 of the Public Safety Spectrum and Wireless Innovation Act of the 112th United States Congress, it is {{required}} to have {{a review of the}} use of the spectrum after {{a certain period of time}} of the deployment. After no more than 5 years of the implementation of the wireless network plan, the Commission must conduct a survey and submit a report regarding the public safety spectrum. This includes how the spectrum is being used, recommendations on whether more spectrum is needed and determine if there is opportunity for some of the spectrum to be returned for other commercial purposes. The report intends to make sure that there is the right amount of spectrum and ensure it is being used for the correct purposes, as there is only a limited amount of spectrum overall. From the Administration of Barack Obama, they <b>also</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> test the value of underutilized spectrum to be able to open new avenues of use. Since spectrum space is limited, looking at other spectrum could allow other licensees to move elsewhere, perhaps freeing up more for wireless. Utilizing other spectrum would allow development of advanced technologies. The Secretary of Commerce, National Science Foundation (NSF), Department of Defense, Department of Justice, NASA and other organizations have been designated to create a plan to explore these innovative spectrum-sharing technologies.|$|E
50|$|The movie then picks {{back up in}} St. Louis, Missouri, 18 years later, and it {{is shown}} that Kayla Harris (Brandy Norwood), now 19 years old, has won a contest to meet famous superstar Olivia King. Kayla at this time does not know that Olivia is her mother, but she grew up being {{a huge fan of}} Olivia King and is {{extremely}} excited to meet her idol, completely ignorant to the truth. After enjoying the concert, Kayla then gets the second part of her prize which includes having dinner with Olivia King. At dinner, Kayla lets Olivia know that she <b>also</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be a singer and invites Olivia to a small performance she would be doing. When Kayla gets home from dinner, her father asks her how it went and he is shocked to hear that the star Kayla got to meet was Olivia King, though he knows the truth he does not press the issue further as he sees his daughter is still in the dark. Next, Kayla is shown getting ready to perform, and she begins to worry that Olivia will not show up but sure enough Olivia shows up as Kayla starts to sing. Kayla is ecstatic that her idol has shown up but after the show Olivia pulls her aside and reveals to Kayla who she really is. Kayla is stunned, upset, and quickly leaves. Kayla is shaken, argues with her father, and refuses to speak to Olivia even when she offers to help her with her career. Kayla's best friend advises her to accept Olivia's help with her music career as it is the least she owes her.|$|E
