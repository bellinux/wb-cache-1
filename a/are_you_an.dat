60|$|FITZSIMMONS. You are not Harry Jones. And {{not only}} <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> impostor, {{but you are}} a thief.|$|E
6000|$|You quite misapprehend my parents. They are {{the most}} simple-mannered people alive, and quite unambitious. They {{are two of the}} few {{remaining}} Evangelical school. Tessy, <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> Evangelical?" ...|$|E
6000|$|BUILDER. Don't {{put your}} oar in! I've had {{wonderful}} patience so far. [He puts his boot through a drawing] Art! This is what comes of it! <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> artist? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> man," [...] Hector shouted back, [...] "to set {{on others}} to fight when you dare not fight yourself? Whoever <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> coward!" ...|$|R

5000|$|Communicator: [...] "To {{recognize}} one's own sin {{is to have}} no sin. So, <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> sinner?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Have you not friends {{enough at}} home to care for you, sir?" [...] he said, his face getting purple. [...] "Are you Jack Carvel's son, or <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> impostor?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All are agreeable," [...] {{said the}} trooper, {{following}} the group {{they had left}} with his eyes; [...] "though the speediest interments give the cleanest fields. Of which <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> admirer?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Princess," [...] he exclaimed, [...] "you seem indeed {{very wise}} and very powerful. But {{how can you}} help me to do the things of which you speak? <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> enchantress?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We have no {{time for}} tomfoolery," [...] said the Secretary, {{breaking}} in savagely. [...] "We {{have come to know}} what all this means. Who <b>are</b> <b>you?</b> What <b>are</b> <b>you?</b> Why did you get us all here? Do you know who and what we <b>are?</b> Are <b>you</b> <b>a</b> half-witted man playing the conspirator, or <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> clever man playing the fool? Answer me, I tell you." ...|$|R
60|$|LADY BRITOMART [violently] Don't dare call me Biddy. Charles Lomax: <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> fool. Adolphus Cusins: <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> Jesuit. Stephen: <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> prig. Barbara: <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> lunatic. Andrew: <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> vulgar tradesman. Now you {{all know}} my opinion; and my {{conscience}} is clear, at all events [she sits down again with a vehemence that almost wrecks the chair].|$|R
5000|$|This {{confusion}} is also {{mentioned in the}} French movie La Cité de la peur. In the Disney's Toontown Online event [...] "April Toons Week," [...] characters switch playgrounds and everything is silly. Pluto switches places with Minnie Mouse, and he speaks. A brief gag in an episode of House of Mouse also acknowledges this — Hades asks Goofy, [...] "Are <b>you</b> <b>a</b> man, <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> dog, <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> man-dog[...] [...] what are you?". Goofy simply replies [...] "I'm just Goofy." ...|$|R
60|$|SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. What {{an appalling}} {{philosophy}} that sounds! To attempt to classify you, Mrs. Cheveley, {{would be an}} impertinence. But may I ask, at heart, <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> optimist or a pessimist? Those {{seem to be the}} only two fashionable religions left to us nowadays.|$|E
6000|$|... "What! <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> enthusiast, Miss Thurwell?" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "Well, well, I {{was worse}} myself once in my younger days, before my {{profession}} made a slave of me. Surely, {{that is a}} genuine 'Velasquez,' Mr. Brown. Upon my word! Fancy coming across such a treasure here!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why not?" [...] she murmured, {{dropping}} her eyes. [...] "I {{am tired of}} my life. What you owed me then you owe me now. Why should it be too late? I am not an old woman yet, nor <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> old man, and I am weary of being alone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Basil," [...] said Rupert at last, {{in a weak}} voice, [...] "I {{always thought}} <b>you</b> <b>were</b> my brother. But <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> man? I mean--are <b>you</b> only <b>a</b> man?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You {{say that}} you are not Ughtred of Tyrnaus," [...] she exclaimed. [...] "Then who <b>are</b> <b>you?</b> <b>An</b> impostor! Yes! You are in the royal chamber, and even now the people call for you. You are a tool of Domiloff's. Good! The people shall know that they are being deceived!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! this is practical--this is real!" [...] he cried: [...] "I {{should never}} dream that. Besides, {{there is that}} {{peculiar}} voice of hers, so animating and piquant, as well as soft: it cheers my withered heart; it puts life into it.--What, Janet! <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> independent woman? A rich woman?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{when you}} can catch me," [...] said the Dwarf; [...] "but that's not to-day, nor yet to-morrow. What are you doing here? <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> ambassador, maybe come to propose a match for me? I'm not proud, I'll hear you. They say there's a rather well-looking wench in your parts, the Princess Jaqueline--" ...|$|E
60|$|Pand. What <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> talking, when I came? Was Hector armed, {{and gone}} ere ye came? Hector was {{stirring}} early.|$|R
6000|$|Bless me, White-Jacket, <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> great gun yourself, {{that you}} so recoil, to the {{extremity}} of your breechings, at that discharge? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, youngster, <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> good sailor?" [...] {{the captain}} asked; as the Antelope, with all sail set, ran down Southampton water.|$|R
6000|$|Havill, {{who had not}} drunk {{enough to}} affect his reasoning, held up his glass to the light and said, 'I never can quite make out what you are, or what your age is. Are you sixteen, one-and-twenty, or twenty-seven? And <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> Englishman, Frenchman, Indian, American, or what? You seem not to have taken your degrees in these parts.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Sarceda? I don't know. A {{minute ago}} {{he was on his}} back on the causeway. The fellow pulled me down and rolled behind me. Let me be I say. I am not Sarceda, and if I were, is this a time to settle private quarrels? I am your comrade, Bernal Diaz. Holy Mother! who <b>are</b> <b>you?</b> <b>An</b> Aztec who speaks Castilian?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is a plain {{case against}} the spring-gun," [...] said the Warden; [...] "and, as {{you tell me you}} are a stranger, I trust you will not suppose that our {{peaceful}} English woods and parks are the haunt of banditti. We must try to give you a better idea of us. May I ask, <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> American, and recently come among us?" ...|$|E
60|$|P. C. MAN. [Eyeing him] I {{should keep}} quiet if I <b>was</b> <b>you.</b> <b>As</b> <b>you</b> know, sir [To MR MARCH] there's a law {{nowadays}} against soo-tenors.|$|R

6000|$|... "You lazy loafer!" [...] she cried, [...] "must I work my arms off {{washing and}} toiling for the ugly likes of <b>you?</b> Are <b>you</b> <b>a</b> man or <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> kitchen hound?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... --Wait awhile, Mr Dedalus said threateningly. You're {{like the}} rest of them, <b>are</b> <b>you?</b> <b>An</b> insolent pack of little bitches since your poor mother died. But wait awhile. You'll all get a short shrift and a long day from me. Low blackguardism! I'm {{going to get rid of}} you. Wouldn't care if I was {{stretched}} out stiff. He's dead. The man upstairs is dead.|$|E
6000|$|... "Is Sir Howard Horne your cousin?" [...] asked March. [...] "I'm {{going to}} Torwood Park {{to see him}} myself; only about his public work, of course, and the {{wonderful}} stand he is making for his principles. I think this Budget is the greatest thing in English history.

6000|$|... "Let {{me look at}} you," [...] she cried. [...] "Let me be sure. Is {{this just}} some ghastly change, or <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> imposter? My heart is growing chilled.

6000|$|... "With the {{greatest}} pleasure, madam," [...] he answered, bowing. [...] "May I {{be permitted to}} ask, <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> relation of the Count's?" ...|$|R
