5|$|A surviving, {{but very}} {{deteriorated}} 35mm nitrate {{print of the}} film was known to exist in 1988. It was described as being {{in various states of}} decomposition throughout the entire reel, including severe shrinkage <b>and</b> <b>brittle</b> or torn perforations. This print is 925 feet long and was held by John E. Allen, Inc. though it is not specifically known if it transferred to the Library of Congress in 1997.|$|E

60|$|The doctor, who was universally {{considered}} one of the best-tempered creatures on earth, made this demand in such a dreadful tone of anger, that Giles <b>and</b> <b>Brittles,</b> who were considerably muddled by ale and excitement, stared at each other in a state of stupefaction.|$|R
5|$|Chromium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Cr and atomic number 24. It {{is the first}} element in group 6. It is a steely-grey, lustrous, hard <b>and</b> <b>brittle</b> metal which takes a high polish, resists tarnishing, and has a high melting point. The name of the element {{is derived from the}} Greek word χρῶμα, chrōma, meaning color, because many chromium compounds are intensely colored.|$|E
5|$|Shrewsbury is {{well known}} in culinary circles for being the namesake of a classic English dessert. Shrewsbury cakes (or biscuits) are {{typically}} crisp <b>and</b> <b>brittle</b> creations that may incorporate fruit. They can be small in size for serving several at a time, or large for serving as a dessert in their own right. Traditionally Shrewsbury cakes have a distinct hint of lemon.|$|E
5|$|Beryllium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Be and atomic number 4. It {{is a relatively}} rare element in the universe, usually occurring {{as a product of}} the spallation of larger atomic nuclei that have collided with cosmic rays. Within the cores of stars beryllium is depleted as it is fused and creates larger elements. It is a divalent element which occurs naturally only in combination with other elements in minerals. Notable gemstones which contain beryllium include beryl (aquamarine, emerald) and chrysoberyl. As a free element it is a steel-gray, strong, lightweight <b>and</b> <b>brittle</b> alkaline earth metal.|$|E

5|$|Germanium is a shiny grey-white solid. It has a {{density of}} 5.323 g/cm3 and is hard <b>and</b> <b>brittle.</b> It is mostly unreactive at room {{temperature}} but is slowly attacked by hot concentrated sulfuric or nitric acid. Germanium also reacts with molten caustic soda to yield sodium germanate Na2GeO3 and hydrogen gas. It melts at 938°C. Germanium is a semiconductor with an electrical conductivity of around 2 × 10−2S•cm−1 and a band gap of 0.67eV. Liquid germanium is a metallic conductor, with an electrical conductivity {{similar to that of}} liquid mercury.|$|E
5|$|In the autumn, {{the leaves}} die {{back and the}} outer scales of the bulb become dry <b>and</b> <b>brittle,</b> so the crop is then {{normally}} harvested. If left in the soil over winter, the growing point {{in the middle of}} the bulb begins to develop in the spring. New leaves appear and a long, stout, hollow stem expands, topped by a bract protecting a developing inflorescence. The inflorescence takes the form of a globular umbel of white flowers with parts in sixes. The seeds are glossy black and triangular in cross section.|$|E
5|$|Other fauna, such as hydrozoa, bryozoa <b>and</b> <b>brittle</b> stars, often dwell {{among the}} {{branches}} of gorgonian and coral colonies. The pygmy seahorse not only makes certain species of gorgonians its home, but closely resembles its host and is thus well camouflaged. Some organisms have an obligate relationship with their host species. The mollusc Simnialena marferula is only found on the sea whip Leptogorgia virgulata, is coloured like it and has sequestered its defensive chemicals, and the nudibranch Tritonia wellsi is another obligate symbiont, its feathery gills resembling the tentacles of the polyps.|$|E

5|$|Plutonium, {{like most}} metals, has a bright silvery {{appearance}} at first, much like nickel, but it oxidizes {{very quickly to}} a dull gray, although yellow and olive green are also reported. At room temperature plutonium is in its α (alpha) form. This, the most common structural form of the element (allotrope), is about as hard <b>and</b> <b>brittle</b> as gray cast iron unless it is alloyed with other metals to make it soft and ductile. Unlike most metals, {{it is not a}} good conductor of heat or electricity. It has a low melting point (640°C) and an unusually high boiling point (3,228°C).|$|E
5|$|Zirconium is a lustrous, greyish-white, soft, ductile and {{malleable}} metal that is solid at room temperature, {{though it is}} hard <b>and</b> <b>brittle</b> at lesser purities. In powder form, zirconium is highly flammable, but the solid form is much less prone to ignition. Zirconium is highly resistant to corrosion by alkalis, acids, salt water and other agents. However, it will dissolve in hydrochloric and sulfuric acid, especially when fluorine is present. Alloys with zinc are magnetic at less than 35K.|$|E
5|$|About 190 {{species of}} {{flowering}} {{plants in the}} park have been registered, {{most of which are}} part of the natural composition of the Siberian taiga. Marsh Labrador tea is the most common, the park being one of only three locations in Norway where it occurs. The most common berry plant is lingonberry; common bilberry and bog bilberry are also common, but do not carry good yields of berries. In August there is normally a good yield of cloudberry, and occasionally there can be found Arctic raspberry. There is a limited number of marine plants. The steep cliffs at Revsaksskaret allow mountainous plants to thrive, such as Alpine chickweed, white bluegrass <b>and</b> <b>brittle</b> bladder-fern. These were common throughout the area after the last glacial period, but have vanished with forestation. Other mountainous plants common in the region are not found in Pasvik because of low oxygen levels in the lower soil levels.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{a variety}} of sports teams including:archery, badminton, cricket, soccer (football), tennis and bowls. Wistaston Sports and Leisure Association run the Eric Swan Sports Ground <b>and</b> <b>Brittles</b> Pavilion. The ground is located off Church Lane behind the primary school. The {{association}} was set up in 1997. It is an independent 'not for profit' organisation set up to encourage sport and leisure activities in Wistaston.|$|R

5|$|Aposematism is {{a widely}} used {{function}} of bioluminescence, providing a warning that the creature concerned is unpalatable. It is suggested that many firefly larvae glow to repel predators; millipedes glow for the same purpose. Some marine organisms are believed to emit light for a similar reason. These include scale worms, jellyfish <b>and</b> <b>brittle</b> stars but {{further research is needed}} to fully establish the function of the luminescence. Such a mechanism would be of particular advantage to soft-bodied cnidarians if they were able to deter predation in this way. The limpet Latia neritoides is the only known freshwater gastropod that emits light. It produces greenish luminescent mucus which may have an anti-predator function. The marine snail Hinea brasiliana uses flashes of light, probably to deter predators. The blue-green light is emitted through the translucent shell, which functions as an efficient diffuser of light.|$|E
5|$|Etty {{had used}} {{experimental}} techniques to make The Sirens and Ulysses, using a strong glue as a paint stabiliser which caused the paint to dry hard <b>and</b> <b>brittle,</b> and to flake off once dry, a problem {{made worse by}} the painting's large size causing it to flex whenever it was moved. From the moment it was complete it began to deteriorate. After it was exhibited at the 1857 Art Treasures Exhibition it was considered in too poor a condition for public display, and it was placed in long-term storage in {{the archives of the}} Royal Manchester Institution and its successor, the Manchester Art Gallery. In the mid 20th century {{there were a number of}} unsuccessful attempts to repair The Sirens and Ulysses, but an attempt to clean the painting unintentionally damaged the paint further.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the caps}} {{are covered by}} a peridium—an outer {{covering}} layer of tissue. After the fruit body matures and begins to dry out, {{the lower part of}} the peridium starts to rip, usually starting from small longitudinal slits near where the peridium attaches to the top of the stem. However, the pattern of tearing is variable; in some instances, the slits may appear higher up on the peridium, in others, the peridium rips more irregularly. The peridium may also rip in such a way that it appears as if there is a ring at the top of the stem. The torn peridium exposes the internal gleba. The gleba is divided into wavy plates or lamellae, some of which are fused together to form irregular chambers. The gleba is a drab brown to blackish-brown color, and it becomes tough <b>and</b> <b>brittle</b> as it dries out. The flesh is firm when young, white, and will stain light to bright yellow when it is bruised.|$|E
50|$|Other {{issues are}} {{hydrogen}} embrittlement, a {{process by which}} some metals (including iron <b>and</b> titanium) become <b>brittle</b> <b>and</b> fracture following exposure to hydrogen. The resulting leaks makes storing cryogenic propellants in zero gravity conditions difficult.|$|R

5|$|Lactarius vietus (commonly {{known as}} the grey milkcap) is a species of fungus in the family Russulaceae, first {{described}} by Elias Magnus Fries. It produces moderately sized <b>and</b> <b>brittle</b> mushrooms, which grow {{on the forest floor}} or on rotting wood. The flattened-convex cap can vary in shape, sometimes forming the shape of a wide funnel. It is typically grey, but the colour varies. The species has crowded, light-coloured gills, which produce white milk. The spore print is typically whitish, but also varies considerably. The mushrooms typically have a strong, acrid taste and have been described as inedible, but other authors have described them as consumable after boiling. L.vietus feeds by forming an ectomycorrhizal relationship with surrounding trees, and it favours birch. It grows in autumn months and is fairly common in Europe, North America and eastern Asia.|$|E
5|$|The fruitbodies (ascocarps) of Geopyxis carbonaris are cup shaped, 1–2cm wide, {{and have}} fringed whitish margins. The inner spore-bearing {{surface of the}} cup, the hymenium, is brick red and smooth, while the {{exterior}} surface is a dull yellow, and may be either smooth or have blister-like spots (pustules). The stipe is small (1–1.5mm long and 1–2mm wide), whitish in color, and expands abruptly into the cup. The brownish flesh of the fungus is thin <b>and</b> <b>brittle.</b> It {{does not have any}} distinctive taste, but has an unpleasant smell when crushed in water. The edibility of the fungus is not known, but the fruitbodies are insubstantial and unlikely to be harvested for eating.|$|E
5|$|The onion {{plant has}} {{a fan of}} hollow, bluish-green leaves and its bulb {{at the base of}} the plant begins to swell when a certain day-length is reached. The bulbs are {{composed}} of shortened, compressed, underground stems surrounded by fleshy modified scale (leaves) that envelop a central bud at the tip of the stem. In the autumn (or in spring, in the case of overwintering onions), the foliage dies down and the outer layers of the bulb become dry <b>and</b> <b>brittle.</b> The crop is harvested and dried and the onions are ready for use or storage. The crop is prone to attack by a number of pests and diseases, particularly the onion fly, the onion eelworm, and various fungi cause rotting. Some varieties of A. cepa, such as shallots and potato onions, produce multiple bulbs.|$|E
50|$|Routes with high-flow seeps {{also tend}} to become easier as the season {{progresses}} due {{to the increase in}} volume of ice. Low-flow seeps, however (e.g. French Reality, Banff; Moonlight/Snowline, Kananaskis), often form early in the season (September-November) when the flow is good from latent summer heat, and then slow down or even stop with the deepening winter frost; subsequent ablation (and destruction by climbing) of the ice often makes for thinner <b>and</b> <b>brittler</b> ice with time.|$|R
