5|$|After his death, Edwin {{came to be}} venerated as a saint by some, {{although}} his cult was eventually overshadowed by the ultimately more successful cult of Oswald, {{who was killed in}} 642. They met their deaths in battle against similar foes, the pagan Mercians and the British, thus allowing both of them to be perceived as martyrs; however, Bede's treatment of Oswald clearly demonstrates that he regarded him as an unambiguously saintly figure, <b>a</b> <b>status</b> that he did not accord to Edwin.|$|E

The city's history dates back to at least the 11thcentury (CE), and by the 14thcentury, it was a thriving centre of commerce. Like several of the other monuments in the city, Coventry's city walls were erected {{towards the end of}} the 14th and the beginning of the 15thcenturies, though city walls served little defensive purpose by that time and were largely <b>a</b> <b>status</b> symbol.|$|E

5|$|Groves and Parsons {{drafted a}} {{proposed}} organization and charter for the AFSWP, which they sent to Eisenhower and Nimitz for approval in July 1947. Groves {{did not get}} everything that he asked for; he wanted <b>a</b> <b>status</b> {{equal to that of}} a deputy to the Chief of Staff and Chief of Naval Operations, but the most that Eisenhower and Nimitz would allow was <b>a</b> <b>status</b> equal to that of the heads of a technical service, although Groves still reported directly to them. They also characterized his role as a staff post rather than a command, although Groves was already exercising the functions of a commander at Sandia. After the National Security Act of 1947 created an independent Air Force, Groves reported to the Chief of Staff of the Air Force as well, and was given a second deputy chief from the Air Force, Major General Roscoe C. Wilson, who had worked on the Silverplate project during the war.|$|E

At the same time, more research into dragonflies needs to be done, consideration should be given to pollution control and the public should be educated about the importance of biodiversity.|$|E

5|$|Until the 1950s, {{screening}} of anti-malarial drugs {{was carried out}} on avian malaria. Avian malaria species differ from those that infect humans. The discovery in 1948 of Plasmodium berghei in wild rodents in the Congo and later other rodent species that could infect laboratory rats transformed drug development. The short hepatic phase and life cycle of these parasites made them useful as animal models, <b>a</b> <b>status</b> they still retain.
