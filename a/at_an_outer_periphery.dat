40|$|Abstract—In {{oligonucleotide}} microarray experiments, {{noise is}} a challenging problem, as biologists now are studying their organisms not in isolation {{but in the}} context of a natural en-vironment. In low photomultiplier tube (PMT) voltage images, weak gene signals and their interactions with the background fluorescence noise are most problematic. In addition, nonspecific sequences bind to array spots intermittently causing inaccurate measurements. Conventional techniques cannot precisely separate the foreground and the background signals. In this paper, we pro-pose analytically based estimation technique. We assume a priori spot-shape information using <b>a</b> circular <b>outer</b> <b>periphery</b> with <b>an</b> elliptical center hole. We assume Gaussian statistics for modeling both the foreground and background signals. The mean of the foreground signal quantifies the weak gene signal corresponding to the spot, and the variance gives the measure of the undesired binding that causes fluctuation in the measurement. We propose a foreground-signal and shape-estimation algorithm using the Gibbs sampling method. We compare our developed algorithm with the existing Mann–Whitney (MW) - and expectation maxi-mization (EM) /iterated conditional modes (ICM) -based methods. Our method outperforms the existing methods with consider-ably smaller mean-square error (MSE) for all signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) in computer-generated images and gives better qualitative results in low-SNR real-data images. Our method is computationally relatively slow because of its inherent sampling operation and hence only applicable to very noisy-spot images. In a realistic example using our method, we show that the gene-signal fluctuations on the estimated foreground are better observed for the input noisy images with relatively higher undesired bindings.

40|$|It is {{demonstrated}} that an AT-cut quartz crystal driven in the thickness-shear-wave mode and typically {{used as a}} sensor to monitor the viscoelastic shear-wave properties of a fluid also produce longitudinal pressure waves. Unlike the shear wave, these waves are capable of long-range propagation through the fluid and of reflection at its boundaries, notably <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>outer</b> fluid–air interface. They introduce a component into the measured electrical impedance and resonance frequency shift of the crystal, which reflects the setting up of cyclic pressure-wave resonances in the fluid. This {{has important implications for}} the practical employment of these crystal as sensors. Under appropriate conditions, as demonstrated for water and n-octane, it is possible to determine the propagating properties of sound waves in a fluid simultaneously with the viscoelastic shear-wave properties.

However, since the properties of the solar wind vary with heliocentric distance and since properties of planetary shocks depend on plasma beta, interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) spiral angle and Mach number, the amount of heating, acceleration efficiencies, etc. significantly change with heliocentric distance.
