50|$|The Loft Bed Ladder - The contestants, to {{complete}} the loft bed, must build a ladder out of ABS plumbing pipes. Deen got pipes, but not T joints to make the rungs; some were provided to him so he would not fail. After Andrew lashes out at everyone (Simon in particular) for not reading the instructions to the adhesive when assembling the ladder. Matt fails as he had purchased PVC adhesive instead of ABS adhesive (which {{would mean that the}} adhesion was, at best, only temporary). Cory fails as his <b>adhesive</b> <b>sets</b> before he assembles the whole ladder. Deen also fails when he admitted that he had never closed the adhesive can lid the whole time he was using it, which allowed the <b>adhesive</b> to <b>set.</b> Angela and Simon also fail, though Simon learns an important lesson on reading the instructions.|$|R

New {{generation}} fly ashes are a {{produced during}} coal combustion in fluidized bed furnaces with simultaneous sulphur removal from the gas. This process is held at temperature of about 850 degrees of Celsius. The generated ashes basically {{differ in their}} physicochemical properties from traditional silica ashes. Fluidal ashes produced during lignite combustion consist of active puzzolana {{in the form of}} dehydrated clayey minerals and active components activating the process of hydration of, e. g. CaO, anhydrite II and CaCO 3 ashes. The paper presents the results of laboratory analyses of the influence of ashes coming from the combustion of lignite on technological properties of fresh and <b>set</b> <b>sealing</b> slurries based on drilling cement.

40|$|The {{strengthened}} {{effectiveness and}} the performance capacity of repaired Reinforced Concrete (RC) structures with Carbon Fibre Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) sheets {{is dependent on the}} properties of the adhesive interface layer. Adhesive material requires a specific setting time to achieve the maximum design capacity. Adhesive producer provides technical data which demonstrates the increase with time of the capacity, up to the maximum. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the effect of the <b>adhesive</b> <b>setting</b> time on the modal parameters as an indication of the effectiveness of CFRP on repaired RC beams. Firstly, datum modal parameters were determined on the undamaged beam and subsequently the parameters were obtained when damaged was induced on the RC beam by application of load until the appearance of the first crack. Finally, the RC beam is repaired with externally bonded CFRP sheets, and modal parameters are once again applied after 0. 5, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 11, 15 and 18. days. The comparison is made with the data based on half day results in order to monitor the change in the modal parameters corresponding to the <b>adhesive</b> <b>setting</b> time. The modal parameters where used as indicators for the effectiveness of CFRP are affected by the adhesive time as shown in this study. Results are compared with the adhesive technical data provided by the adhesive producer...|$|R

Part of the price of the set went to the government via the Postmaster-General's Department (PMG), with money also going to the broadcaster. Apart from extremely limited advertising, this was the broadcasters' only source of income. From the outset problems with the system came to the fore. Many young people built their own sets, which could receive all the stations. The <b>sealed</b> <b>set</b> system was devised by broadcasting pioneer Ernest Fisk of AWA - Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia).|$|R

25|$|A typical {{connector}} {{is installed}} by preparing the fiber end and inserting {{it into the}} rear of the connector body. Quick-set adhesive is usually used to hold the fiber securely, and a strain relief is secured to the rear. Once the <b>adhesive</b> <b>sets,</b> the fiber's end is polished to a mirror finish. Various polish profiles are used, {{depending on the type of}} fiber and the application. For single-mode fiber, fiber ends are typically polished with a slight curvature that makes the mated connectors touch only at their cores. This is called a physical contact (PC) polish. The curved surface may be polished at an angle, to make an angled physical contact (APC) connection. Such connections have higher loss than PC connections, but greatly reduced back reflection, because light that reflects from the angled surface leaks out of the fiber core. The resulting signal strength loss is called gap loss. APC fiber ends have low back reflection even when disconnected.|$|R
