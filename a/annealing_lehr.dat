5000|$|Historically, sulfur-containing {{compounds}} {{were the}} first materials used to dealkalize glass containers. Dealkalization proceeds through the interdiffusion/ion-exchange of Na+ out of the glass and H+/H3O+ into the glass, along with the subsequent reaction of the sulfate species with available sodium at the surface to form sodium sulfate (Na2SO4). The latter is left behind as water-soluble crystalline deposits, or bloom, on the glass surface that must be rinsed away prior to filling. On manufacturing lines, {{one way in which}} this process was done was by flooding the <b>annealing</b> <b>lehr</b> with sulfur dioxide (SO2) or sulfur trioxide (SO3) gasesâ€”especially in the presence of water, which enhances the reaction. However, this practice fell into disfavor due to environmental and health concerns regarding SOx-type gases. [...] An alternative method for sulfate treatment is with solid ammonium sulfate salt or aqueous solutions thereof. These materials are introduced inside the container after forming and decompose into gases in the <b>annealing</b> <b>lehr,</b> where the resulting sulfur-containing gas mixture carries out the dealkalization reaction. This method is purportedly safer than flooding the <b>annealing</b> <b>lehr</b> since the unreacted components in the gas mixture will tend not to escape to the atmosphere, but rather react with each other and recreate the original salt in the container that can later be rinsed away.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a knowledge-based simulation sys-tem {{for a glass}} annealing process. The long ovens, known as lehrs, in which annealing takes place are not well understood by their operators. In fact, only a few experts can predict {{the effects of a}} change in the lehr controls. Attempts to sim-ulate the behavior of the lehr using conventional methods have not been successful due to the size and complexity of the lehr. Our knowledge-based approach is capable of both simulating the glass temperature curve in an <b>annealing</b> <b>lehr</b> and planning the necessary lehr control settings to achieve a desired curve. It consists of two cooperating expert systems, one rule-based and the other frame-based. The system also includes a high-bandwidth graphics display which allows op-erators to interactively test control-setting changes and ask for the control settings which meet desired specifications. A description of the domain, a history of the development, and details of the design are all presented, along with lessons learned from the experience...|$|E

50|$|The {{elaborate}} patterns {{found on}} figured (or 'Cathedral') rolled-plate glass are produced {{in a similar}} fashion to the rolled plate glass process except that the plate is cast between two rollers, one of which carries a pattern. On occasion, both rollers can carry a pattern. The pattern is impressed upon the sheet by a printing roller which is brought down upon the glass as it leaves the main rolls while still soft. This glass shows a pattern in high relief. The glass is then <b>annealed</b> in a <b>lehr.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Annealing {{of glass}} {{is a process}} of slowly cooling hot glass objects after they have been formed, to relieve {{residual}} internal stresses introduced during manufacture. Especially for smaller, simpler objects, annealing may be incidental to the process of manufacture, but in larger or more complex products it commonly demands a special process of annealing in a temperature-controlled kiln known as a <b>lehr.</b> <b>Annealing</b> of glass is critical to its durability. Glass that has not been properly annealed retains thermal stresses caused by quenching, which indefinitely decrease the strength and reliability of the product. Inadequately annealed glass is likely to crack or shatter when subjected to relatively small temperature changes or to mechanical shock or stress. It even may fail spontaneously.|$|R
40|$|In {{partnership}} with Ford/Visteon, Sandia National Laboratories {{began work on}} design and implementation of improved end-to-end control for float glass production, under DOE Office of Industrial Technology sponsorship. The first task undertaken was to provide an intelligent control for the <b>annealing</b> <b>lehr,</b> both for optimum usage of sensors and for the ability to report digitally {{the state of the}} lehr to an end-to-end control system. The heat transfer simulation of the lehr enclosure for that purpose is described here. This includes a closed-form solution for the infinitely wide glass ribbon, which allow robust computations of the thermal profile and inverses of this function for controls use. This also allows useful initial temperature estimates for the case with counterflow in the lehr ducts, which should greatly simplify and speed the convergence of more detailed models in which the glass participates in the radiative exchanges. This is supplemented by software to compute radiative viewfactors of lehr elements for use in finite-width versions of the simulation. A brief discussion of how stresses could be computed from such a thermal solution is given, but not implemented in software...|$|E
40|$|An {{integrated}} {{system for the}} fusion of product and process sensors and controls for production of flat glass was envisioned, having as its objective the maximization of throughput and product quality subject to emission limits, furnace refractory wear, and other constraints. Although the project was prematurely terminated, stopping the work short of its goal, the tasks that were completed show {{the value of the}} approach and objectives. Though the demonstration was to have been done on a flat glass production line, the approach is applicable to control of production in the other sectors of the glass industry. Furthermore, the system architecture is also applicable in other industries utilizing processes in which product uniformity is determined by ability to control feed composition, mixing, heating and cooling, chemical reactions, and physical processes such as distillation, crystallization, drying, etc. The first phase of the project, with Visteon Automotive Systems as industrial partner, was focused on simulation and control of the glass <b>annealing</b> <b>lehr.</b> That work produced the analysis and computer code that provide the foundation for model-based control of annealing lehrs during steady state operation and through color and thickness changes. In {{the second phase of the}} work, with PPG Industries as the industrial partner, the emphasis was on control of temperature and combustion stoichiometry in the melting furnace, to provide a wider operating window, improve product yield, and increase energy efficiency. A program of experiments with the furnace, CFD modeling and simulation, flow measurements, and sensor fusion was undertaken to provide the experimental and theoretical basis for an integrated, model-based control system utilizing the new infrastructure installed at the demonstration site for the purpose. In spite of the fact that the project was terminated during the first year of the second phase of the work, the results of these first steps toward implementation of model-based control were sufficient to demonstrate the value of the approach to improving the productivity of glass manufacture...|$|E
