5|$|In 1943, Ramsey was {{approached}} by Robert Oppenheimer and Robert Bacher, who asked him to join the Manhattan Project. Ramsey agreed to do so, but {{the intervention of the}} Project director, Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves Jr., was necessary in order to prise him away from the Secretary of War's office. A compromise was agreed to, whereby Ramsey remained on the payroll of the Secretary of War, and was merely seconded to the Manhattan Project. In October 1943, Group E-7 of the Ordnance Division was created at the Los Alamos Laboratory with Ramsey as group leader, with the task of integrating the design <b>and</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> the nuclear weapons being built by the laboratory.|$|E
5|$|The Airbus A320neo family {{aircraft}} {{ordered in}} 2011 {{were to be}} delivered starting 2015. However, due to a delay in the production <b>and</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> these aircraft, IndiGo dry-leased a total of 22 used aircraft {{to cope with the}} demand. On 15 October 2014, IndiGo expressed its intention to order a further 250 A320neo aircraft worth US$25.7 billion at list prices. On 15 August 2015, IndiGo confirmed the order for 250 A320neo aircraft for $26.5 billion. The order also provides IndiGo the flexibility to convert some A320neos to A321neos that can seat more passengers and fly on longer routes. The order of 250 jets was Airbus' single largest order by number of aircraft. Indigo received the first A320neo in March 2016.|$|E
5|$|The United States Air Force, focused toward {{nuclear weapons}} <b>and</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> such munitions against static {{strategic}} targets had spent little effort in expanding its tactical capabilities {{since the end}} of the World War II. Operation Shed Light sought to rectify this by bringing together improved tactics and technology. The programs were subsequently centered on improved communication and navigation aids for all-weather and night flying, sensor equipment for seeing through clouds, foliage, and darkness, improved equipment and methods for target marking and battlefield illumination, and aircraft and tactics to utilize these developments. In the end, few of the programs would yield applicable results and most of the aircraft developed under its umbrella would largely fall into obscurity. The most applicable developments were those that could be mainstreamed such as the work done on navigation and communication and sensor equipment.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} {{team had}} access to Codemasters' full audio library, which was composed of sound assets dating from the first Colin McRae Rally (1998) up to Grid 2 (2013). On a case-by-case basis, they decided whether to reuse existing sounds or update them. The result {{was a combination of}} audio from various games; suspensions sounds were taken from Dirt 3, wind, gearbox and mechanical samples from Colin McRae Rally 2005, garage sounds from , and music from Colin McRae Rally 04. One aspect of the audio that was kept intact was the original pacenotes read by professional co-driver Nicky Grist. The team did not want to disrupt the timing <b>and</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> critical track information so they opted to use the original recordings in this case. Support for custom soundtracks was added so that players could listen to their own music in-game.|$|E

In response, the USAID's Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance provided US$50,000 for the purchase <b>and</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> relief supplies and fuel for emergency vehicles. About J$4million (US$46,800) was donated by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries to the Greenhouse Growers Association for the repair of greenhouses. In conjunction with the Food and Agriculture Organization, an estimated J$12million (US$140,400) was made available to initiate the planting of about 50,000 crop seedlings. The Veterinary Division provided financial assistance to livestock farmers and dispatched animal technicians with prophylactic medication and vitamins to avert foot rot disease in small ruminants, including goats and sheep. The cost of the medications was estimated at J$2million (US$23,400). The Banana Board's Catastrophe Fund, which at the time comprised J$50million (US$585,000), delivered both monetary support and human resources to local banana and plantain farmers.|$|E
