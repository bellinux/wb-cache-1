5|$|Mereka Bilang, Saya Monyet! (released internationally <b>as</b> <b>They</b> <b>Say</b> I'm a Monkey!) is a 2008 Indonesian film {{directed}} by Djenar Maesa Ayu. Starring Titi Rajo Bintang, Henidar Amroe, and Ray Sahetapi, {{it tells the}} life story of Adjeng, who was sexually abused as a child by her mother's boyfriend. Filmed over 18days {{after several years of}} development, the film adapted two of Ayu's short stories from her debut anthology of the same name. Owing to its low budget of Rp620 million, its cast and crew were mostly amateurs and students, although several established actors appeared at reduced rates.|$|E

Jeanne replied: [...] "Pardon me if, reading that, I want to laugh, because you want to relieve me of a fear that I've never had. I've never thought that, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>say,</b> you eat little children". When Jeanne did come to court, Catherine {{pressured}} her hard, playing on Jeanne's hopes for her beloved son. Jeanne finally agreed to the marriage between her son and Margaret, so long as Henry could remain a Huguenot. When Jeanne arrived in Paris to buy clothes for the wedding, she was taken ill and died on 9 June 1572, aged forty-three. Huguenot writers later accused Catherine of murdering her with poisoned gloves. The wedding took place on 18 August 1572 at Notre-Dame, Paris. Frieda dismisses this accusation based on the fact Catherine had nothing to gain from her death, once the marriage contract had been signed, although Frieda considered Catherine responsible for Philibert le Vayer, who was Duke of Anjou's favourite.|$|E
500|$|In the 1963–64 U.S. Championship, Fischer {{achieved}} {{his second}} perfect score, this time against the top-ranked chess {{players in the}} country: [...] "This tournament became, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>say,</b> the stuff of legend. The fact that Fischer won his sixth U.S. title was no surprise. The way he did it was spectacular." [...] "One by one Fischer mowed down the opposition as he cut an 11–0 swathe through the field, to demonstrate convincingly to the opposition that he was now {{in a class by}} himself." [...] This result brought Fischer heightened fame, including a profile in Life magazine. Sports Illustrated diagrammed each of the 11 games in its article, [...] "The Amazing Victory Streak of Bobby Fischer". Such extensive chess coverage was groundbreaking for the top American sports' magazine. His 11–0 win in the 1963–64 Championship is the only perfect score {{in the history of the}} tournament, and one of about ten perfect scores in high-level chess tournaments ever. David Hooper and Kenneth Whyld called it [...] "the most remarkable achievement of this kind". Fischer recalls: [...] "Motivated by my lopsided result (11–0!), Dr. [...] Kmoch congratulated [...] Evans (the runner up) on 'winning' the tournament...and then he congratulated me on 'winning the exhibition'." ...|$|E

[...] David Bowie, who performed at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert and recorded the song [...] "Under Pressure" [...] with Queen, praised Mercury's performance style, saying: [...] "Of all the more theatrical rock performers, Freddie took it further than the rest... he took it over the edge. And of course, I always admired a man who wears tights. I only saw him in concert once and <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>say,</b> he was definitely a man who could hold an audience {{in the palm of his}} hand." [...] Queen guitarist Brian May wrote that Mercury could make [...] "the last person at the back of the furthest stand in a stadium feel that he was connected". Mercury's main prop on stage was a broken microphone stand, which after accidentally snapping off the heavy base during an early performance, he realised could be used in endless ways.|$|E

500|$|... 2008: In early March, Favre {{announces that}} he is {{retiring}} from the Green Bay Packers. At a news conference he said [...] "I know I can play, but I don't think I want to. It's been a great career for me, but it's over. <b>As</b> <b>they</b> <b>say,</b> all good things must come to an end. I look forward to whatever the future may hold for me." [...] Later in the month Favre has second thoughts and wants to return. According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Favre backed out of a meeting with Packers management two days before re-entry talks were to begin. In April, Sam Farmer from the Los Angeles Times reported that Favre's agent Bus Cook was making inquiries to other teams about Favre. Favre responded by saying [...] "I {{have no idea where}} that came from, but it certainly didn't come from me. I'm happy about my decision and I haven't once said 'I wonder if I made the wrong decision.' I know it's the right one. It's kind of funny. Even when I'm retired, they won't let me stay retired." [...] Also in April, the Packers placed Favre on the Reserve-Retired list and planned to have Favre's number retired during the season opener against the Minnesota Vikings. In June, Favre said he told head coach Mike McCarthy he wanted {{to come back to the}} team. He said [...] "When he picked up the phone again after he dropped it, he said, 'Oh, God, Brett. You're putting us in a tight spot. He said, 'Brett, playing here is not an option.' Those were his exact, exact words." [...] In July, Favre sent a letter requesting his release from the Packers. A couple months earlier Favre contacted Mike McCarthy about coming out of retirement and was [...] "rebuffed" [...] according to a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel report. Then a report came in from ESPN that said that Favre had wanted to come out of retirement but the Packers were reluctant to take him back. The Packers refused to give Favre an unconditional release. A few days later, Favre had an interview with Greta Van Susteren of Fox News where he accused general manager Ted Thompson of forcing him to make a decision on his return to the team too quickly. Two days after the interview, the Packers filed tampering charges with the NFL front office charging that the Minnesota Vikings had inappropriate contact with Favre. The Packers then offered Favre a retirement package of $25 million marketing agreement to remain retired. This offer was rejected and Favre was subsequently traded to the New York Jets.|$|E
