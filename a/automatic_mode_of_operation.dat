5000|$|Type 97A {{carbines}} {{became available}} in Canada in 2008, {{were classified as}} Non-Restricted by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), and sold to general public. In January 2009, a shipment of Type 97 firearms {{was approved by the}} RCMP for retail sale, but later confiscated and seized by Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) officers. [...] Around the same time a second shipment of Type 97A restricted firearms was also stopped by CBSA. On March 22, 2010 about 35 civilian owners of the Type 97A carbine originally imported by Lever Arms of BC (the only version ever available for sale) were sent notice by the RCMP indicating that the status of their firearm had been changed to 12.2 prohibited (fully automatic), and owners without such a firearm license had 30 days to turn in their Type 97A firearm to either individual or business that has such a license, or to police for destruction. [...] Canadian Type-97 owners initiated a reference hearing, to establish legality of re-classification of the Type-97 semi-automatic weapon to prohibited status. In early 2012 the challenge was lost, and the judge ruled that Type-97 firearms indeed are prohibited devices. While the exact details of the modification are kept secret, RCMP firearm technicians, allegedly, demonstrated to an expert on the defense side, that the Type-97 firearm can be readily and easily converted to fully <b>automatic</b> <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> in short time and with commonly available tools. As a result, Type-97 firearms were confiscated from the owners, and are no longer legal for civilian ownership in Canada (even for people with the so-called 12.2 fully automatic firearm license).On April 28, 2013, Norinco's new EMEI T97NSR was classified as a non-restricted firearm by the RCMP with FRT Number 142760, and became legal for dealers to import for those with non-restricted possession and acquisition licenses. It is legal in Canada for hunting, varmint control, target practice and competitive shooting. It went into retail stores on September 17, 2013 and costs about $1,000 CAD.|$|E

50|$|The {{signal box}} has two <b>automatic</b> <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> {{which means that}} if there is a lack of staff the railway can still function. The signal box frame has 35 levers, all of which are fully interlocked. The {{interlocking}} works with the track circuits and point detection. Which levers are locked is decided by the signal box computer which receives points positions, Track circuit data and lever information to decide if it is possible to set a route that will not cause a train to be sent in the wrong direction or be sent on a route where another train is set to cross the track in front of it. The points are worked by 12 V Windscreen wiper motors which have been adjusted so that they stop in one of two positions. They are controlled by the signal box computer which is in turn controlled by the levers. The direction that the points are set to is detected by two microswitches located under the points.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT A {{master control}} for an {{adiabatic}} bomb calorimeter introduces two <b>automatic</b> <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation,</b> but {{little is known}} about the variances of data derived by each mode. Nine samples were assayed in duplicate using each <b>mode</b> on each <b>of</b> 5 days. The resulting data were subjected to analyses of variance to compare the two modes and to estimate components of variance among and within days. The mode had no effect on the gross energy estimates. When sunflower oil and tallow were assayed, the within-day standard deviation was approximately three times greater with the rapid mode than with the reference <b>mode.</b> None <b>of</b> the other 7 samples showed significant differences between modes. Such day-to-day differences as were observed were not consistent over the materials assayed and cannot be attributed to calorimeter operation nor to environmental changes. For most gross energy measurements of feedingstuffs and excreta, the rapid mode appears to produce satisfactory data of high reproducibility. The rapid mode permits a greater throughput of samples than conventional adiabatic calorimetry equipment or than the reference mode; up to 35 samples per 7. 5 hr day are assayed in this laboratory.

50|$|The CPLEE had {{a mass of}} 2.7 kg, a stowed {{volume of}} 2540 cubic cm, and used 3.0 W power {{normally}} and 6.0 W at night when the survival heater was on. The {{main part of the}} instrumentation consisted of two electrostatic analyzers. One of these (analyzer A) pointed toward local lunar vertical, and the other (analyzer B) to a point 60 deg from vertical toward lunar west. Both detectors had fields of view of 4 x 20 degrees; for analyzer A the long axis of the field of view was oriented N-S, and for analyzer B, E-W. As a first approximation, both detectors could be considered to point in the ecliptic plane. Each analyzer consisted of a set of direction-defining slits, deflection plates, five small-aperture (1 mm nominal) C-shaped channel electron multipliers, one large-aperture (8 mm nominal) helical channel electron multiplier and 6 accumulators. For a given voltage applied to the deflection plates, the five small-aperture multipliers were arranged to count particles of one polarity with differing energies, while the large-aperture multiplier simultaneously made a wide-band measurement of particles of the opposite polarity. During each 19.2-s interval in the <b>automatic</b> <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> experiment <b>operation,</b> deflection voltages <b>of</b> zero (twice, for background and calibration) and plus and minus 35, 350, and 3500 were applied to the deflection plates for 2.4 s at each voltage. Each analyzer would make measurements for 1.2 s and transmit while the other analyzer was operating. The little-used manual mode permitted the continuous application of a single deflection voltage, thus increasing temporal resolution for particles in a limited portion of the spectrum. Useful data obtained during each 19.2-s interval (<b>automatic</b> <b>mode)</b> where, for each analyzer, 1.2-s accumulated counts of electrons and ions in 18 energy windows between 40 eV and 20 keV. The windows utilizing all 6 detectors at 35 V are centered roughly at 40, 50, 65, 70, 95, and 200 eV, the windows at 350 V are 10x and at 3500 V are 100x these values. A dust cover with a 63Ni radioactive source on the underside over each aperture for calibration protected the instrument.|$|R

The aim {{of this paper is}} to present the development of vehicle lighting system using LED application. In the system, high power LEDs type is chosen as automobile headlight model and controller circuit using microcontroller is considered. The LEDs are driven using buck converter circuit with appropriate Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signal whereby the PWM signals are generated by microcontroller. The system is divided into 2 modes of operation, manual and automatic. The <b>automatic</b> <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> will be operating when the LDR senses the level of light brightness whereby the level of brightness is preportion to duty cycle of PWM. Meanwhile, for the manual mode of operation, 3 switches which are SW 2 with 20 % duty cycle, SW 3 with 40 % duty cycle and SW 3 with 80 % duty cycle are developed. The result shows that the maximum brightness of LED is about 127. 6 Lumen at 80 % of duty cycle for manual operation mode. Besides, by varying the duty cycle of PWM signal for both modes of operation manual and automatic, LED brightness can be controlled...|$|E
40|$|Traditional {{military}} rifles generally fire full-sized ammunition, such as 7. 62 Ã 51 mm (NATO standard) and 7. 62 Ã 54 R mm (Warsaw Pact standard), 1 {{and were}} in common military use until the wide-spread introduction of military assault rifles. 2 The latter are chambered for inter-mediate calibre ammunition, and are less cumbersome and more suited to closer-range combat. Traditional military rifles, including those with selective fire capabil-ity (often referred to as âbattle riflesâ), have however been retained for some specialized military uses, especially where greater power and accuracy is required. The functioning of modern military rifles {{can be divided into}} three broad categories: manually operated, semi-automatic, and auto-matic. 3 With bolt-action rifles (the most com-mon type of manually operated rifle) the bolt is used to chamber a live cartridge and, after firing, to extract and eject a spent cartridge. Self-loading (semi-automatic and automatic) rifles make use of the propellant gases or re-coil generated by firing to âcycle â the action (moving parts) âextracting and ejecting a spent cartridge and, on the boltâs return, feed-ing a live cartridge from the magazine into the chamber. In the <b>automatic</b> <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> the weapon continues to cycle and fire as long as the trigger stays depressed and cartridges remain in the magazine. States developed bolt-action rifles {{in the latter half of}} the 19 th century, when military (notably colonial) doctrine favoured engaging enemy forces at long ranges. Modern self-loading rifles (developed in the early 20 th century) retained similar calibres, barrel lengths, and effective ranges to their bolt-action predeces-sors. Following the Second World War a change in doctrine prompted most militaries to adopt assault rifles for shorter engagement distance...|$|E
