40|$|Aims Based on a {{new policy}} for {{managing}} work-related diseases, the Belgian government has launched, starting March 1 st 2005, an evidence-based program to promote an early return to work and to prevent chronic low back pain (LBP). Target workers belong {{to the health care}} sector and must be off work due to LBP for at least 4 weeks and maximum 3 months. Considering the challenge in applying an innovative program on such a large scale, its implementation was carefully monitored by a task force created within the Fund for Occupational Diseases (FOD) and various process and impact evaluations carried out to identify barriers to its possible extension to other categories of workers. Methods The program can be defined as a “return to work” (RTW) program and involves a multidisciplinary back rehabilitation program available through more than 40 rehabilitation centres across the country, and an ergonomics intervention in the health care institutions to be carried out by the OH prevention service. Financial incentives are allowed to both the patient and the employer to stimulate participation. For every worker included in the project, data are systematically retrieved both by the rehabilitation centre and the prevention service using standardized forms. Questions arising from the various stakeholders (workers, trade unions, employers, general practitioners, OH physicians) about the program are systematically recorded by the task force. In addition, a phone survey has been conducted among the first 83 participants (out of 91 accepted applications) to know the managing path followed by each worker, and to identify {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the designed program. Results One year after its official launch, the program was found to have reached 5. 1 % to 14. 6 % of the target population depending on the estimation basis chosen. Only 18. 5 % of the participants had seen or read the information leaflet edited by the FOD in the two national languages (in 20. 000 exemplars). The main <b>access</b> <b>criterion</b> (>= 4 weeks sick leave), even supported by a solid scientific evidence, has been considered too severe by many stakeholders; the possibility to access the program during a relapse of a pain episode was not properly understood. Arising from wrong beliefs about back pain and its treatment, some patients but also their treating physicians were not keen to participate to such an active program. Entering the program also implied a visit by the OH physician during the sick leave, a new procedure still rarely used in the enterprises. Some employers worried about the program becoming a stimulus for extending the sick leave period instead of shortening it, but the collected data did not support this assumption. Potential concurrence between health professionals had also a negative influence in some areas. Regarding its content, the program was consistently applied in its medical component, well formalized within the Belgian health care system, but much less in its ergonomics component that was highly dependent on each institution own dynamic for prevention. As regard the program impact at short term, 98 % of the participants did return to work and for 79 % of them well before the end of the rehabilitation treatment in the centre; subjective improvements were recorded in 85 % to 91 % of the workers depending on the variable considered. Discussion and conclusions Informing about 90. 000 workers in hundreds of health care institutions was a challenge and would have needed an ambitious media campaign. The project being completely innovative in the Belgian context, it implies deep changes in the traditional interactions between different health professionals and it requests altering very common beliefs about back pain. Such beliefs or behaviours cannot be changed in a few months! More fundamentally this project shows that there is long way to go before implementing with success at a national scale, interventions originally developed and tested in well controlled conditions and in a selected number of settings: return to work research has yet to evolve from establishing efficacy to proving effectiveness.

Methods The Finnish criteria tool, a cutpoint measure indicating access to SMC, was developed {{on the basis of the}} Western Canada Waiting List Criteria Tool. The Finnish criteria were widely discussed at national level and finally confirmed by a national child psychiatric consensus meeting. The testing data included 949 new cases, aged 5 - 18 years, from SMC, family guidance clinics, primary health care and child protection. Results The Finnish Child Psychiatric Criteria Tool covers the entire case-mix of child psychiatric disorders. Danger to self or others and psychotic symptoms have been combined into a threshold item. This alone suffices to indicate access to SMC.

40|$|As Caddy noted, "access to and {{allocation}} of fish resources {{remains one of}} the most difficult and controversial aspects of fisheries management in Canada and abroad" (Dooley, 2004). It is generally agreed that access and allocation issues associated with harvesting rights remains a divisive and contentious issues for participants in the province's fishing industry. This is particularly true for Aboriginal groups in the province who have been challenged to capitalize on economic development opportunities associated with the fishery. The Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) has the challenging responsibility of responding to the demands of a range of provincial and territorial jurisdictions while at the same time considering the access/allocation needs of Aboriginal groups throughout the country. Various mechanisms have been introduced over the past decade to assist DFO with these access decisions. The Independent Panel on <b>Access</b> <b>Criteria</b> (IP AC) introduced in 2001 was one of these initiatives. IP AC was tasked with finding a solution to the decision making process involving access and the associated ranking or weighting, and defining <b>access</b> <b>criteria.</b> !PAC was successful in identifying various <b>access</b> principles and <b>criteria</b> but it did not fully address some of the outstanding problems related to access. It is important to note that the IP AC suggested that the issue of Aboriginal participation and access to the fishery required special consideration in the Panel's deliberations, due to the constitutional position of Aboriginal peoples. The Aboriginal Fisheries Strategy (AFS) was the other initiative designed to respond to the needs of the Aboriginal people in the country. Introduced in 1992, the AFS was intended to help DFO manage the fishery in a manner consistent with the Sparrow decision. It was intended to serve as a bridging arrangement in fisheries management during the negotiation of comprehensive land claims and self-government agreements. It applies where DFO manages the fishery and where land claim settlements have not already put in place a fisheries management framework. This paper attempts to illustrate how various Aboriginal groups have been marginalized over decades as it relates to the fishery and presents a series of court decisions to illustrate this point. The paper also offers a comparison of the <b>access</b> and allocation <b>criteria</b> associated with the proposed Federal Fisheries Act and those currently in place under the AFS. A significant part of the paper addresses the historical perspective of how Aboriginal groups have been treated by the Federal Government, the Courts, and by society in general. These historical references are essential to fully appreciate the plight of the Aboriginal people and their frustrations in experiencing their rightful place in the country and their right to achieve a reasonable livelihood from the fishery. The paper will also highlight some of the experiences of other Aboriginal peoples in other parts of Canada, in order to provide a clearer picture of how Aboriginal rights have evolved in Canada...|$|R
