40|$|Abstract: Efficiency of an {{automotive}} {{disc brake}} system {{is affected by}} several factors such as lateral run out (LRO), caliper housing stiffness, lining compressibility, seal/groove design, brake fluid, and pad material. A minor deviation {{in any of these}} factors may lead to problems like brake noise, vibration and off-brake caliper drag in the brake system. This paper presents an experimental study of the effect <b>of</b> LRO on <b>calliper</b> drag by measuring drag with respect to LRO for different types <b>of</b> <b>callipers</b> at varied speeds. This study is important because in automotive industry, different methods are used for testing different types of calipers with different LRO values. Results indicate that the effect of increasing LRO on off-brake caliper drag is caliper dependent...|$|R

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} comparing 3 methods of measuring the skin <b>area</b> <b>of</b> a clipped patch on sheep to determine the most appropriate technique {{in terms of its}} precision, repeatability and ease of measurement. The methods were: 1) using callipers to take 3 measurements of both dimensions, 2) tracing the patch outline onto plastic, and 3) photographing the patch with an object <b>of</b> known <b>area.</b> Two clipped patches on the mid-side of 20 weaner sheep at each of 2 geographic locations were measured 2 - 3 times by each of the 3 methods. Linear relationships, and high correlations (0. 83 - 0. 89), between the patch area estimates by each of the methods indicate consistency between the methods in discriminating relative differences in patch size. The mean patch area was larger (P< 0. 01) when measured using callipers (21. 0 ± 3. 2 cm 2) than when estimated by the tracing technique (18. 5 ± 2. 7) or photography (18. 7 ± 2. 7), although the overall coefficients of variation (CV) were similar (14. 7 - 15. 1 %). The between-patch variance was also larger with callipers than tracing or photography, having between-patch CVs of 14. 3, 13. 6 and 13. 9 %, respectively. However, the within-patch CVs <b>of</b> <b>callipers</b> and photography were lower (4. 7 and 5. 0 %) than that for tracing (5. 9 %). All methods were associated with a high degree <b>of</b> repeatability. <b>Callipers</b> provided the highest level of repeatability (t= 0. 90), followed by photography (0. 88) with tracing the least repeatable (0. 84) ...|$|R

40|$|A noisy {{disc brake}} vibrates in a wavelike manner with a {{diametral}} mode of vibration. The mode shape exhibits antinodes with angular spacing {{of a specific}} size related to the noise frequency and mode order. The sizes of the antinodes vary slightly with brake pressure which causes a slight change in noise frequency. If the angular spacing <b>of</b> the <b>callipers</b> is arranged such that an integer of antinodes between the callipers is not possible then the disc is inhibited from vibrating in a given mode and noise at that frequency is prevented. The paper demonstrates that at particular angular settings <b>of</b> the <b>callipers</b> certain frequencies exist yet as the angular settings are changed the disc mode order and related frequency changes. It is shown that the frequencies {{can be related to}} the angular spacing between the callipers and the free mode angular spacing of the disc waveform antinodes. An analysis of the geometry allowed the brake noise frequency to be predicted for a certain angular setting <b>of</b> the <b>callipers</b> and specific angular settings to be predicted when the brake would be quiet. It is shown that this analysis was successfully applied in practice on the test rig and on the problematic vehicle.

60|$|In a week I {{obtained}} no {{less than}} twenty-four species of birds, which I had {{not found in the}} east of the island, and in a fortnight this number increased to forty species, almost all of which are peculiar to the Javanese fauna.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} set of downhole measurements {{was collected}} in the AND- 1 B drillhole {{as part of the}} on-ice scientific programme defined for the McMurdo Ice Shelf (MIS) Project. Geophysical logs were recorded over two operation phases and consisted <b>of</b> <b>calliper,</b> temperature, fluid conductivity, induction resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, natural gamma activity, acoustic televiewer, borehole deviation, and dipmeter. In addition, two standard vertical seismic profiles (VSP) and one walk-away VSP were obtained. Radioactive logs (porosity and density) were not run because of unstable borehole conditions. Although the total depth of the hole is 1285 metres below seafloor (mbsf), the depth range for in situ measurements was limited by the length of the wireline (1018 mbsf) and by the nullification of some geophysical logs due to the presence of steel casing. A depth correction was derived to account for systematic discrepancies in depth between downhole measurements and cores; consequently, log responses can be directly compared to core properties. The resulting data are amenable to studies of cyclicity and climate, heat flux and fluid flow, and structure and stress.

40|$|In {{electromechanical}} brakes, central controllers require {{accurate information}} about the clamp force between brake pad and disc {{as a function of}} pad displacement. This function is usually denoted as characteristic curve of the caliper. In a typical electromechanical braking system, clamp force measurements vary with actuator displacements in a hysteretic manner. Due to ageing, temperature and other environmental variations, the hysteretic characteristic curve <b>of</b> <b>calliper</b> varies with time. Therefore, automatic caliper calibration in real time is vital for high-performance braking action and vehicle safety. Due to memory and processing power limitations, the calibration technique should be memory efficient and of low computational complexity. This chapter investigates the hysteresis as a nonlinear effect in the electromechanical brakes, and describes a technique to parametrically model this effect. This technique is a simple and memory-efficient real-time calibration method in which a Maxwell-slip model is fitted to the data samples around each hysteresis cycle. Experimental results from the data recorded in various temperatures show that this technique results in clamp force measurements with less than 0. 7 % error over the range of clamp force variations. It is also shown that by using these measurements, the characteristic curve can be accurately calibrated in real time...|$|R
