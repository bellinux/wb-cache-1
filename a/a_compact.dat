50|$|A further {{phenomenon}} that has undergone investigation {{in relation to}} high temperature wear prevention and lubrication, is that of <b>a</b> <b>compacted</b> oxide layer glaze formation.

The required high temperatures arise from metallic surfaces sliding against each other (or a metallic surface against a ceramic surface).
