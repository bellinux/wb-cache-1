40|$|The {{marketing}} literature {{provides a}} solid understanding of auctions regarding final sales prices and {{many aspects of}} the processes that unfold to result in those outcomes. This research complements those perspectives by first presenting a new bidder behavior model that shows the role of emergent network ties among bidders on the auction outcome. Dyadic ties are identified as the bid and counter-bid patterns of interactions between bidders that unfold throughout the duration of an auction. These structures are modeled using network analyses, which enables: (1) a richer understanding of detailed <b>auction</b> <b>processes,</b> both within <b>auctions</b> and across auctions of multiple lots, (2) a mapping of the processes to the forecast of prices and the trajectory toward final sales prices, (3) the clear and early identification of key bidders who are influential to the bidding action and who impact final auction sales prices, and (4) the results clearly show that the network exchange patterns are significant and contribute to an understanding of <b>auction</b> <b>processes</b> and outcomes above and beyond simple economic predictors such as the number of bids or bidders or the bidders’ economic status. We conclude by providing some managerial implications for online auction houses and bidders...|$|R

In 2004, Google used the Dutch Auction system for its Initial Public Offering. Traditional U.S. investment banks have shown resistance to the idea of using an <b>auction</b> <b>process</b> to engage in public securities offerings. The auction method allows for equal access to the allocation of shares and eliminates the favorable treatment accorded important clients by the underwriters in conventional IPOs. In the face of this resistance, the Dutch Auction is still a little used method in U.S. public offerings, although there have been hundreds of auction IPOs in other countries.|$|E

The auction was delayed by several hours due to objections raised by Greenberg and Ryan's group questioning the qualification of the Cuban-Crane bid, which was due no later than 8:00 pm on August 3. The auction, which was due to begin at 9:00 am on August 4, did not have its first opening bid determined until 2:50 pm. After {{no more than three}} bids by each party, Cuban withdrew from the bidding, and Greenberg and Ryan were declared the winners shortly after midnight.

40|$|In this dissertation, {{the effect}} of the {{maturity}} composition of marketable public debt on the term structure of interest rates is explored. The research has shown that this effect is relatively small. Unlike previous research, the yield changes around the quantity shocks were analyzed in relation to those shocks. Our results show that yields respond significantly to the auctioning of new bonds. The announcements of auctions do not have any impact on yields. A two factor affine yield model is used to explain the relationship between quantity shocks in public debt and the term structure of interest rates. The parameters are estimated using Generalized Method of Moments. While the relationship between quantities and yields is weak, yields can be related to the event of the <b>auctioning</b> <b>process.</b> A factor analysis shows that the quantity shocks are related to the slope and curvature of the term structure. ...|$|R

As {{a departure from the}} traditional methods used by applied economists and game-theorists, a novel approach is taken in this study to tackle the problem by formulating the <b>auctioning</b> <b>process</b> as a constrained nonlinear program and applying standard optimization techniques to solve it. Aside from proposing respective closed-form formulae for computing the optimal bid levels and the auctioneer's maximum expected revenue, we also show that the bid decrements should be increasing if there are two or more bidders in the Dutch auction. Additionally, the auctioneer's maximum expected revenue increases with the number of bidders as well as the number of bid levels. Finally, managerial implications of the key findings as well as limitations of this research work are discussed.
