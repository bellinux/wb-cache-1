5|$|On 15 September 1914 Rowell and {{his classmates}} were {{commissioned}} as first lieutenants in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF). At the time, Rowell's class {{had not yet}} completed its military training. The AIF's commander, Major General William Throsby Bridges, decided that regimental duty would rectify that deficiency, so he allotted the Duntroon cadets as regimental officers of the AIF, rather than as staff officers. The cost of this decision was high; of the 134 commissioned in time to serve at the front, 42 were killed and 38 wounded. Cadets were posted to units being formed in their home states, so Rowell was posted to the 10th Infantry Battalion. When he discovered that the 3rd Light Horse Regiment was {{to be commanded by}} his cousin, Lieutenant Colonel F. M. Rowell, Sydney obtained permission to swap places with another member of his Duntroon class Lieutenant Eric Wilkes Talbot Smith. It was <b>a</b> <b>fateful</b> decision; Smith was fatally wounded on Anzac Day.|$|E
5|$|As Boyce's {{interest}} in philanthropy grew, {{he turned to}} his childhood experiences in the outdoors as a resource, but could not find a way to channel his charitable ideas and dreams until <b>a</b> <b>fateful</b> stop to England while en route to what became the failed photographic expedition to Africa. Events in London on the way to and from this expedition would lead to the founding of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA), one of many civic and professional organizations formed during the Progressive Era to fill the void of citizens who had become distended from their rural roots. Many youth organizations such as the Woodcraft Indians and Sons of Daniel Boone formed in America in the early 1900s focusing on outdoor character-building activities. The writings and adventures of Theodore Roosevelt contributed to these movements, with their outdoor, nature, and pioneer themes. By the time of his 1922 expedition to Africa, Boyce was so well respected in Scouting that French Boy Scouts in Algeria saluted him and offered to escort him along a trail when they found out he was the founder of BSA and LSA in America.|$|E
5|$|Australia won {{the opening}} {{game of the}} rubber in an {{unexpectedly}} close match in Brisbane by 96 runs, Hassett making 55 and 17. South Africa struck back and gained their first Test victory over Australia for 41 years, taking the Second Test at Melbourne by 82 runs. Australia recovered momentum by convincingly winning the Third Test by an innings, but Hassett's form had been mediocre in all three encounters, totalling 76 runs in five innings. In the Fourth Test at Adelaide, he played his only significant innings for the series, scoring 163 and sharing a 275-run stand with Colin McDonald. With Australia heading for a victory that would give them the series, Ray Lindwall and Miller suffered injuries and were unable to bowl in the second innings. This compelled Hassett to delay his second innings declaration: South Africa then forced a draw by batting out 73 (eight-ball) overs against the depleted bowling attack with four wickets in hand. In anticipation of the forthcoming tour of England, Australian selectors made <b>a</b> <b>fateful</b> decision to rest Lindwall and Miller for the last Test when Hassett won the toss and elected to bat. He scored 40 runs {{in a total of}} 520 that gave Australia apparent command of the match. However, South Africa again fought back; after scoring 435, the tourists bowled Australia out for 209, Hassett making 30. They then won the match by chasing a target of 297 runs in their second innings. Hassett bowled the final over and the tourists’ Roy McLean took three fours from the first five balls to reach their target and square the series. Hassett ended the Tests with 309 runs at 38.63 and the entire season with 779 runs at 38.95, a substantially lower return compared to previous Australian summers.|$|E

25|$|As soon as wartime {{restrictions}} on producing passenger locomotives were eased in February 1945, the PRR placed {{an order for}} 50 production examples. This was <b>a</b> <b>fateful</b> step, since the problems encountered with the prototypes had not been ironed out nor had they been tested with the intensity required {{to be sure of}} production reliability. The production locomotives differed in detail in their streamlined casings, and in the suspension in an attempt to increase adhesion.|$|E
25|$|In 1056, a Mon Theravada Buddhist monk named Shin Arahan made <b>a</b> <b>fateful</b> {{visit to}} Pagan, and {{converted}} its king Anawrahta to Theravada Buddhism {{from his native}} Ari Buddhism.

25|$|In 1932, two Sophia University (Jochi Daigaku) students, {{who were}} Catholic refused visit to Yasukuni Shrine {{on the grounds}} that it was {{contrary}} to their religious convictions. In 1936, the Society for the Propagation of the Faith (Propaganda Fide) of the Roman Curia issued the Instruction Pluries Instanterque, and approved visits to Yasukuni Shrine as an expression of patriotic motive. This response of the Catholic Church helped the university avoid <b>a</b> <b>fateful</b> crisis, but it meant its bowing down to the military power and control by Emperor system.|$|E
25|$|Kirti Sri Rajasinha died in {{the midst}} of these events in January 1796, and was succeeded by his brother Sri Rajadhi Rajasinha. The new king {{rejected}} the terms of Migastenne's treaty, depriving the kingdom of the opportunity to regain the lands it had lost a generation earlier. It proved to be <b>a</b> <b>fateful</b> decision; the British immediately set about organising their new acquisitions, establishing systems of government, education, and justice. With the appointment of Frederick North (1798–1805) as the first British governor of Ceylon, any hope of the Kandyans regaining their eastern territories essentially disappeared.|$|E

25|$|Torrio headed an {{essentially}} Italian {{organized crime group}} {{that was the biggest}} in the city, with Capone as his right-hand man. He was wary of being drawn into gang wars and tried to negotiate agreements over territory between rival crime groups. The smaller North Side Gang led by Dean O'Banion (also known as Dion O'Banion) was of mixed ethnicity, and it came under pressure from the Genna brothers who were allied with Torrio. O'Banion found that Torrio was unhelpful with the encroachment of the Gennas into the North Side, despite his pretensions to be a settler of disputes. In <b>a</b> <b>fateful</b> step, Torrio either arranged for or acquiesced to the murder of O'Banion at his flower shop in October 1924. This placed Hymie Weiss {{at the head of the}} gang, backed by Vincent Drucci and Bugs Moran. Weiss had been a close friend of O'Banion, and the North Siders made it a priority to get revenge on his killers.|$|E

[...] It soon became apparent, however, that recreating the band's studio recordings with a three-piece line-up wasn't going to be possible and so, McGuinn and Hillman, in <b>a</b> <b>fateful</b> decision for their future career direction, hired Gram Parsons as a keyboard player, although he quickly moved to guitar. [...] Although Parsons and Kelley were both considered full members of the Byrds, they actually received a salary from McGuinn and Hillman, and did not sign with Columbia Records when the Byrds' recording contract was renewed on February 29, 1968.|$|E

500|$|Inspiration for {{the plot}} of [...] "Trapped in the Sky" [...] was derived from creator-producer Gerry Anderson's {{memories}} of his National Service. While stationed at RAF Manston in Kent from 1947 to 1949, the young Anderson had witnessed a Battle of Britain-themed air show coming to <b>a</b> <b>fateful</b> end: a Mosquito fighter {{had gone out of}} control and crashed to the ground, resulting in 20 fatalities. A few months after the Mosquito disaster, he saw a Spitfire with a damaged undercarriage make a successful emergency landing at the airbase. During the pre-production of Thunderbirds, Anderson used his recollections of the events as the foundation of the bomb plot surrounding the Fireflash airliner. Anderson dictated the script to his wife, Sylvia, for typing at their villa in Portugal; it was completed in four sessions during the spring of 1964. As an in-joke, the character of Lieutenant Meddings is named after Bob Bell, the AP Films art director, and Derek Meddings, the director of special effects.|$|E

500|$|On July 8 Cornwallis {{received}} {{orders from}} Clinton directing the troops {{he was planning}} to embark for a potential operation against Philadelphia. [...] Upon his arrival at Suffolk he received further dispatches from Clinton, including some that predated others he had already received. [...] Cornwallis decided to proceed with the embarkation of troops for Philadelphia. [...] By July 20, some of these troops had boarded their transports when fresh orders arrived countermanding those for the Philadelphia expedition. [...] He was now ordered to, if possible, recall any embarked troops, and instead do nothing beyond establishing a fortified naval station. [...] He was [...] "at full liberty to detain all the Troops now in Chesapeake" [...] for the purpose. [...] It proved <b>a</b> <b>fateful</b> decision on Clinton's part, since the need to build and protect the new anchorage robbed Cornwallis of any freedom of manoeuvre. [...] This was doubly unfortunate for as Cornwallis pointed out to his superior, the open bays and rivers of the Chesapeake, meant that any base there would [...] "always be exposed to sudden French attack." [...] Nevertheless, Cornwallis, after analysing Portsmouth and several other options, dutifully chose Yorktown and Gloucester Point (across the York River from Yorktown) as the best of the choices for the station. [...] On August 2, he disembarked his army at Yorktown, and began fortifying the area.|$|E

Later, on the road, Bent, Jørgen and some allies open fire on two cars with Nazi flags; however, they are dismayed to discover they have killed a father and wounded a child. An enraged Bent goes to Ketty's hotel room, only to discover that she has flown to Stockholm, fearing Hoffmann's retaliation. Now, Bent and Jørgen plan to kill Hoffmann, and they disguise themselves as policemen. However, they are arrested in a general round-up of the German-allied Danish police, who are killing policemen by firing squad. Jørgen decides to jump over a fence and is shot, allowing Bent to escape. Time passes, and Jørgen is at a safe house. A squad of German officers arrives. He kills some of them with a sub-machine gun and grenades but ultimately is killed. Meanwhile, Bent, in his home, commits suicide with a pill when he sees the Gestapo arriving. Later, Hoffmann gives Ketty the reward for helping apprehend Bent and a letter from him found in his room, in which he expresses his feelings and his doubt of her betrayal. The film ends with notes about Bent and Jørgen's legacy.|$|E
