The {{synthesis}} {{mathematical model}} procedure of coherent demodulation of synchronous mutually nonorthogonal digital signals with minimum <b>frequency-shift</b> <b>keying</b> {{is the basic}} and purpose of this article. Synthesis method of mathematical model coherent demodulation of synchronous mutually nonorthogonal digital signals with minimum <b>frequency-shift</b> <b>keying.</b> Coherent demodulations of powerful signal interference with minimum <b>frequency-shift</b> <b>keying</b> and useful digital signal with minimum <b>frequency-shift</b> <b>keying</b> in a channel with additive white noise are showed. In absence of signal interference this procedure degenerates in classic coherent demodulation of digital signal with minimum <b>frequency-shift</b> <b>keying.</b> When the power of signal interference is much greater power of the useful digital signal with a minimum <b>frequency-shift</b> <b>keying</b> the interference protection receiving in the channel with additive white noise there is such when a signal interference missing. Conclusions. This mathematical model procedure {{can be used in}} modem compensators for realization of the repeated use of frequency resource and in development of perspective protection from signal interference of radio contact facilities. ? ?????? ??????????? ?????? ?????????????? ?????? ??????????????? ????????? ??????????? ??????????? ?????????? ??????? ??????????????? ?? ? ???. ??? ?????????? ?????? ?????? ????????? ??????????? ? ????????? ???????????? ??????????? ??????????? ?? ? ???. ??? ???????????? ?????????? ?????????? ???????? ?????? ??? ?????????? ????????? ????????? ?? ? ??? ?????????????????? ?????? ?????????? ???????????? ? ?????????????????? ?????? ? ?????? ? ?????????? ????? ??????????? ????? ??? ??????. ?????? ?????????????? ?????? ????? ???? ???????????? ??? ?????????? ???????? ?????????????, ?????????????? ????????? ????????????? ?????????? ???????, ? ????? ??? ?????????? ????????????? ???????????????? ??????? ??????????...|$|R

The 1s and 0s from the serial port are converted to audio tones using <b>audio</b> <b>frequency-shift</b> <b>keying</b> (AFSK). A '0' bit is represented as four cycles of a 1200 Hz sine wave, and a '1' bit as eight cycles of 2400 Hz. This gives a data rate of 300 baud. Each frame starts with one start bit (a '0') followed by eight data bits (least significant bit first) followed by two stop bits ('1's). So each frame is 11 bits, for a data rate of [...] bytes per second.|$|E

This is a collaborative project of School of Aerospace, Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering and the School of Physics within the University of Sydney. Expected for launch in 2013, i-INSPIRE will carry a photonics-based spectrograph, an imaging camera, and a miniaturized radiation detector. As the first pico-satellite to be fully constructed by an Australian university and to be launched into space, i-INSPIRE project will be a conceptual prototype for future more complex small satellite mission like the upcoming QB 50. This thesis presents the i-INSPIRE pico-satellite subsystems design and final test by means of high altitude balloon launch. The current work and research {{is based on the}} concept of the TubeSat. The proposed satellite provides a robust bus to fulfil the scientific tasks. One onboard computer based on MSP 430 microcontroller is specifically design for the mission. The AFSK (<b>Audio</b> <b>Frequency-Shift</b> <b>Keying)</b> based UHF (Ultra-High Frequency) communication implementation, cooperating with ground station, will accumulate experience and pave the way for future project. The main scientific aim of i-INSPIRE is the operation of a novel photonic spectrograph in space. Moreover, the unique radiation environment of space also enables us to probe the radiation environment in Low Earth orbit by one miniaturized Geiger counter. An imaging camera is added to undertake earth observation. During the test phase, subsystems and developed housekeeping software were first tested under laboratory conditions. The i-INSPIRE satellite was then launched with a high altitude balloon to verify its practical performance under simulated harsh space environment like low temperature.

An analysis {{based on information}} theory provides the optimal values of the modulation index {{when there is a}} bandwidth constraint.
