5|$|Amino acids <b>are</b> <b>made</b> into {{proteins}} {{by being}} joined {{together in a}} chain of peptide bonds. Each different protein has a unique sequence of amino acid residues: this is its primary structure. Just as {{the letters of the}} alphabet can be combined to form an almost endless variety of words, amino acids can be linked in varying sequences to form a huge variety of proteins. Proteins <b>are</b> <b>made</b> from amino acids that have been activated by attachment to a transfer RNA molecule through an ester bond. This aminoacyl-tRNA precursor is produced in an ATP-dependent reaction carried out by an aminoacyl tRNA synthetase. This aminoacyl-tRNA is then a substrate for the ribosome, which joins the amino acid onto the elongating protein chain, using the sequence information in a messenger RNA.|$|E

Archaea were originally described as extremophiles living in extreme environments, such as hot springs, but {{have since been}} found in all types of habitats. Only now are scientists beginning to realize how common archaea are in the environment, with Crenarchaeota being {{the most common form}} of life in the ocean, dominating ecosystems below 150 m in depth. These organisms are also common in soil and play a vital role in ammonia oxidation.|$|E
