25|$|For decades, the Rosenbergs' sons Michael and Robert Meeropol {{and many}} other {{defenders}} maintained that Julius and Ethel were innocent of spying on their country and victims of Cold War paranoia. After {{the fall of the}} Soviet Union, much information concerning them was declassified, including <b>a</b> <b>trove</b> <b>of</b> decoded Soviet cables, code-named VENONA, which detailed Julius's role as a courier and recruiter for the Soviets and Ethel's role as an accessory. Their sons' current position is that Julius was legally guilty of the conspiracy charge, though not of atomic spying, while Ethel was only generally aware of his activities. The children believe that their father did not deserve the death penalty and that their mother was wrongly convicted. They continue to campaign for Ethel to be posthumously and legally exonerated.|$|E

500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} May 19, 1976 on the South Fork of Long Island with {{the scene in}} which Alvy and Annie boil live lobsters; filming continued periodically {{for the next ten}} months, and deviated frequently from the screenplay. There was nothing written about Alvy's childhood home lying under a roller coaster, but when Allen was scouting locations in Brooklyn with Willis and art director Mel Bourne, he [...] "saw this roller-coaster, and... saw the house under it.

[...] Similarly, there is the incident where Alvy scatters <b>a</b> <b>trove</b> <b>of</b> cocaine with an accidental sneeze: although not in the script, the joke emerged from a rehearsal happenstance and stayed in the movie. In audience testing, this laugh was so sustained that a much longer pause had to be added so that the following dialogue was not lost.|$|E

The tests yielded <b>a</b> <b>trove</b> <b>of</b> valuable data never before known and showed that the poor lift of the 1900 and 1901 gliders was entirely due to an incorrect Smeaton value, and that Lilienthal's published data were fairly accurate for the tests he had done.|$|E
