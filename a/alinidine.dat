During a one-week period of hospitalisation, exercise tests were done on four successive days after administration of placebo, 20, 40 and 60 mg <b>alinidine,</b> in a randomized double-blind sequence.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Although early {{intravenous}} beta-blocker therapy during acute {{myocardial infarction}} (AMI) reduces the incidence of fatal arrhythmias in patients not treated with thrombolytic agents, its antiarrhythmic effect in thrombolysed patients remains controversial. We investigated prospectively the arrhythmia incidence in 244 patients with AMI receiving alteplase and a double-blind randomized adjunctive therapy with intravenous atenolol, <b>alinidine,</b> or placebo. Moreover, the characteristics and prognostic significance of early arrhythmias and their relation with infarct size and coronary patency were evaluated. METHODS AND RESULTS: All patients underwent 24 -hour Holter monitoring on day 1 and were clinically followed {{in the hospital for}} 10 to 14 days. Coronary angiography was performed on day 10 to 14. Atenolol and <b>alinidine</b> significantly decreased the basic heart rate without causing more sinus arrest or higher-degree atrioventricular block. The prevalence of atrial fibrillation in <b>alinidine</b> patients was lower than in the atenolol patients (P =. 007) but not lower than in placebo patients (P =. 11). There was no effect of either agent on the incidence and frequency distribution of ventricular or supraventricular premature beats or on the incidence and characteristics of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, accelerated idioventricular rhythm, sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), or ventricular fibrillation (VF). On day 1, seven VF episodes were recorded in six patients (2. 5 %) and five VT episodes in five patients (2 %). VF always started at 2. 5 hours (average of 6 hours). Five of the seven VF and three of the five VT episodes started with an R-on-T. However, for all VT, the morphology of the first beat was {{the same as that of}} the following beats, suggesting that the sustained arrhythmia was not induced by an extrasystole. After day 1 and before hospital discharge, VF and VT developed in one and six patients, respectively. Three of the seven patients who developed VF during the first 2 weeks underwent coronary angiography; all three had an occluded infarct-related artery. In contrast, only one of nine patients with early or late VT had an occluded vessel. Patients with VT and VF on day 1 had a significantly larger enzymatic infarct size than those without the arrhythmia (P =. 02), and a similar trend was noted for VT or VF after day 1 (P =. 19). However, none of the patients with VT or VF on day 1 developed a life-threatening arrhythmia later during the hospital stay. Also, none of the seven patients with VT or VF after day 1 had experienced a major rhythm disturbance during the first 24 hours. CONCLUSIONS: (1) Our data do not support the hypothesis that beta-blockers or bradycardiac agents might reduce the incidence of major arrhythmias when used in conjunction with thrombolytic therapy. (2) The pathogeneses of VT and VF early during AMI are clearly distinct. (3) VT or VF during the first 2 weeks is a marker for a larger infarct.

40|$|IF : 4, 868) International audienceThe {{spontaneous}} activity of cardiac tissue originates in specialized pacemaker {{cells in the}} sino-atrial node that generate autonomous rhythmic electrical impulses. A number of regions in the brain are also able to generate spontaneous rhythmic activity to control and regulate important physiological functions. The generation of pacemaker potentials relies on a complex interplay between different types of currents carried by cation channels. Among these currents, the hyperpolarization-activated current (termed I(f), cardiac pacemaker "funny" current, and I(h) in neurons) is the major component contributing to the initiation of cardiac and neuronal excitability and to the modulation of this excitability by neurotransmitters and hormones. I(f) is an inward current activated by hyperpolarization of the membrane potential and by intracellular cyclic nucleotides such as cAMP. The identification {{at the end of}} the 1990 s of a family of mammalian genes that encode for four Hyperpolarization-activated Cyclic Nucleotide-gated channels, HCN 1 - 4, has made analysis of the location of these channels and the study of their biophysical properties an obtainable goal. As a result, specific agents have been developed for their ability to selectively reduce heart rate by lowering cardiac pacemaker activity where f-channels are their main natural target. These drugs include <b>alinidine,</b> zatebradine, cilobradine, ZD- 7288 and ivabradine. Recent data indicate that pharmacological tools such as W 7 and genistein, which have been used to identify some intracellular pathways involved in ionic channel modulation, also have the ability to inhibit I(f) directly. This opens new perspectives for the future development of other specific rhythm-lowering agents...|$|E

Intracellular potentials also were recorded from the sino-atrial (SA) node, atrium, bundle of His, preterminal Purkinje fibres and papillary muscles. The effects {{of a range of}} concentrations of three new antiarrhythmic drugs, melperone, cibenzoline and <b>alinidine</b> were compared, the lower concentrations studied corresponding to clinical levels. At low concentrations the effects of melperone, inducing bradycardia and lengthening ERP, could be attributed to prolongation of action potential duration (APD) in the sinus node and atrial and ventricular tissues. The slope of slow diastolic depolarization was not altered, nor was there any change in A-H or H-P conduction time, or in maximum rate of depolarization (MRD). At higher concentrations melperone had a substantial class 1 action, but there was no negative inotropic effect, or other evidence of restriction of slow inward current. Cibenzoline was primarily a class 1 agent but also lengthened APD to some extent in the SA node and in atrial and ventricular muscle, but not in Purkinje fibres. APD thus became more uniform along the ventricular conducting pathway. Cibenzoline also depressed contractions and increased A-H conduction time, implying restriction of slow inward current. The bradycardia could thus be attributed to a slowing of both depolarization and repolarization in the SA node, without any change in slope of the slow diastolic depolarization.

40|$|Background and purpose: ATP-sensitive {{potassium}} channels (K(ATP) channels) in beta {{cells are}} a major target for insulinotropic drugs. Here, we studied the effects of selected stimulatory and inhibitory pharmacological agents in islets lacking K(ATP) channels. Experimental approach: We compared insulin secretion (IS) and cytosolic calcium ([Ca(2 +) ](c)) changes in islets isolated from control mice and mice lacking sulphonylurea receptor 1 (SUR 1), and thus K(ATP) channels in their beta cells (Sur 1 KO). Key results: While similarly increasing [Ca(2 +) ](c) and IS in controls, agents binding to site A (tolbutamide) or site B (meglitinide) of SUR 1 were ineffective in Sur 1 KO islets. Of two non-selective blockers of potassium channels, quinine was inactive, whereas tetraethylammonium was more active in Sur 1 KO compared with control islets. Phentolamine, efaroxan and <b>alinidine,</b> three imidazolines binding to K(IR) 6. 2 (pore of K(ATP) channels), stimulated control islets, but only phentolamine retained weaker stimulatory effects on [Ca(2 +) ](c) and IS in Sur 1 KO islets. Neither K(ATP) channel opener (diazoxide, pinacidil) inhibited Sur 1 KO islets. Calcium channel blockers (nimodipine, verapamil) or diphenylhydantoin decreased [Ca(2 +) ](c) and IS in both types of islets, verapamil and diphenylhydantoin being more efficient in Sur 1 KO islets. Activation of alpha(2) -adrenoceptors or dopamine receptors strongly inhibited IS while partially (clonidine > dopamine) lowering [Ca(2 +) ](c) (control > Sur 1 KO islets). Conclusions and implications: Those drugs retaining effects on IS in islets lacking K(ATP) channels, also affected [Ca(2 +) ](c), indicating actions on other ionic channels. The greater effects of some inhibitors in Sur 1 KO than in control islets might be relevant to medical treatment of congenital hyperinsulinism caused by inactivating mutations of K(ATP) channels...|$|E

Up to {{a concentration of}} 100 5 M efaroxan had no insulinotropic effect {{in the presence of}} a basal glucose concentration, but enhanced the effect of a stimulatory concentration of glucose or nonglucidic nutrients (ketoisocaproate plus glutamine).

Likewise, at 0. 1 to 10 5 M RX 871024 [2 -(imidazolin- 2 -yl) - 1 -phenylindole] showed a purely enhancing effect, but at 100 5 M it elicited a strong KCl-like secretory response in the presence of basal glucose. At 0. 1 and 1 5 M RX 871024 did not significantly depolarize the -cell membrane. However, at a purely enhancing drug concentration (10 5 M RX 871024 or 100 5 M efaroxan) KATP channel activity was strongly reduced, the membrane was depolarized, and the cytosolic Ca 2 + concentration was elevated in the presence of basal glucose. Insulin secretion by sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) 1 knockout (KO) islets, which have no functional KATP channels, was not increased by efaroxan (100 or 500 5 M) or by 10 5 M RX 871024 but was increased by 100 5 M RX 871024. The imidazolines phentolamine and <b>alinidine</b> (100 5 M) were also ineffective on SUR 1 KO islets. It is concluded that a significant KATP channel block is compatible with a purely enhancing effect of the imidazolines on nutrient-induced insulin secretion.
