25|$|Like {{his contemporaries}} William Shakespeare uses thou {{both in the}} intimate, French style sense, and also to {{emphasize}} differences of rank, but he {{is by no means}} consistent in using the word, and friends and lovers sometimes call each other ye or you <b>as</b> <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> call each other thou, sometimes in ways that can be analysed for meaning, but often apparently at random.|$|E
25|$|Oakey accepts that Martin Rushent's adept {{sequencing}} {{and programming}} skills brought a professional {{edge to the}} band's sound, and added many new elements and techniques. Oakey, Burden, Wright and Callis set about writing new material, bringing in Sulley and Catherall from Sheffield <b>as</b> <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> were available. The aim was another album for the Human League within a year. Virgin were at this point lukewarm but keen that the band released another single as soon as possible.|$|E

A poll on The Sydney Morning Heralds website revealed that 60% of the public agreed with Roebuck's call for Ponting to stand down. However, neither poll is necessarily reflective of opinion in Australia with anyone in the world can vote <b>as</b> <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> please, and the sample is not random. However, a poll on the Wide World of Sports website revealed 41,000 of the 50,000 respondents did not want Ponting removed.|$|E

25|$|The most revolutionary {{aspect of}} Planck's {{treatment}} of the black body is that it inherently relies on an integer number of oscillators in thermal equilibrium with the electromagnetic field. These oscillators give their entire energy to the electromagnetic field, creating a quantum of light, <b>as</b> <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> are excited by the electromagnetic field, absorbing a quantum of light and beginning to oscillate at the corresponding frequency. Planck had intentionally created an atomic theory of the black body, but had unintentionally generated an atomic theory of light, where the black body never generates quanta of light at a given frequency with an energy less than hν. However, once realizing that he had quantized the electromagnetic field, he denounced particles of light as a limitation of his approximation, not a property of reality.|$|E
500|$|Each {{prime time}} {{broadcast}} hour {{consists of three}} bouts: the [...] "Challenger" [...] bout, the [...] "Line Jumper" [...] bout, and the [...] "Winner's Defense" [...] bout. Questions start at one point each, with the value increasing by one every 100 seconds. At any time, either contestant may choose to [...] "double" [...] instead of answering; doing so doubles that question's value and forces the opponent to act. A doubled opponent may either answer or [...] "double back," [...] quadrupling the point value and forcing the original contestant to answer. If a doubled or doubled-back contestant answers incorrectly or fails to act within five seconds, the points are awarded to his/her opponent. Contestants may double <b>as</b> <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> wish during a bout.|$|E
500|$|During the 15th century, the {{traditional}} {{superiority of the}} common law courts was challenged by ecclesiastical courts and the equitable jurisdiction of the Lord Chancellor, exercised through the Court of Chancery. These courts were more attractive to the common lawyers because of their informality and the simple method used to arrest defendants. The bills of complaint and subpoena used by the Chancery made court procedure far faster, and from 1460 to 1540 there was a steep {{decline in the number}} of cases in the common law courts, coinciding with a sharp increase in cases in the newer courts. This loss of business was quickly recognised by the King's Bench, which was urged by Fairfax J in 1501 to develop new remedies so that [...] "subpoenas would not be used <b>as</b> <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> are at present".

The Honeywell corporation adapted to the regularity of the events taking moves to minimize the disruptions they caused.

50|$|In {{his recent}} work Marković investigates the {{possibilities}} and challenges {{as well as}} the limits of visual representation in general, but is primarily concerned with the role of the close-up. Marković draws attention to the politics of representation involved in the production of visibility and invisibility of the human face.

Moreover, <b>as</b> <b>often</b> <b>as</b> not, <b>they</b> are produced in/by public space, where the “ideal face” may be used for fulfilling ideological, propaganda or market purposes.|$|R

2500|$|Mutual masturbation, the act {{by which}} {{two or more}} {{partners}} stimulate themselves {{in the presence of}} each other, allows a couple to reveal the [...] "map to [...] pleasure centers". By watching a partner masturbate, one finds out the methods they use to please him- or herself, allowing each partner to learn exactly how the other enjoys being touched. Intercourse, by itself, is often inconvenient or impractical at times to provide sufficient sexual release for many people. Mutual masturbation allows couples to enjoy each other and obtain sexual release <b>as</b> <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> need but without the inconveniences and risks associated with sex.|$|E

2500|$|Salvatore Giuliano (Sicilian: Turiddu or Sarvaturi Giulianu) (16 November 1922 [...] 5 July 1950) was a Sicilian bandit, {{who rose}} to {{prominence}} in the disorder which followed the Allied invasion of Sicily in 1943. In September of that year, Giuliano became an outlaw after shooting and killing a police officer who tried to arrest him for black-market food smuggling when 70% of Sicily's food supply {{was provided by the}} black market. He maintained a band of subordinates for most of his career. He was a flamboyant, high-profile criminal, attacking the police at least <b>as</b> <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> sought him. In addition, he was a local power-broker in Sicilian politics between 1945 and 1948, including his role as a nominal colonel for the Movement for the Independence of Sicily. He and his band were held legally responsible for the Portella della Ginestra massacre, though there is some doubt about their role in the numerous deaths which occurred.|$|E
2500|$|Dutch dialects and {{regional}} languages are not spoken <b>as</b> <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> used to be. Although {{this is much}} less the case in Belgium (Flanders) than in the Netherlands. Recent research by Geert Driessen shows {{that the use of}} dialects {{and regional}} languages among both Dutch adults and youth is in heavy decline. In 1995, 27 percent of the Dutch adult population spoke a dialect or regional language on a regular basis, while in 2011 this was no more than 11 percent. In 1995, 12 percent of the primary school aged children spoke a dialect or regional language, while in 2011 this had declined to 4 percent. Of the officially recognized regional languages Limburgish is spoken most (in 2011 among adults 54%, among children 31%) and Dutch Low Saxon least (adults 15%, children 1%). The decline of the West Frisian language in Friesland occupies a middle position (adults 44%, children 22%). Dialects are most often spoken in rural areas, however, a lot of cities have a distinct city dialect. For example, the city of Ghent has very distinct [...] "g", [...] "e" [...] and [...] "r" [...] sounds, differing a lot from the surrounding villages. The Brussels dialect combines Brabantian with words adopted from Walloon and French.|$|E

It must not be supposed that the [...] "Regulae" [...] form a rule, though {{it would be possible to}} go a good way towards constituting one out of them.

The girls would ask her, with the greatest gravity, for a little music, and she would sing her three songs and play her two little pieces <b>as</b> <b>often</b> <b>as</b> ever <b>they</b> asked, and with an always increasing pleasure to herself.
