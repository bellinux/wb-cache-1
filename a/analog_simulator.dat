Upon designer’s choice, the resulted macromodels can be used to implement and optimize a whole modulator in the SIMULINK object-oriented environment or the code-based analog VHDL process. Using the proposed methodology, fast simulations of a sixth-order CT Sigma-Delta modulator have been performed. I...|$|R
