25|$|In April, {{the ship}} began {{intensive}} {{training in the}} waters off Florida to prepare to cover a Project Mercury spaceshot. TheSullivans joined LakeChamplain at Naval Station Mayport, Florida, and took station. On 5 May 1961, Commander Alan Shepard's Mercury space capsule, Freedom 7, passed overhead <b>and</b> <b>splashed</b> down near LakeChamplain and was speedily rescued by helicopters from the carrier. TheSullivans then made a midshipman cruise in June, visiting New York and Halifax, Nova Scotia.|$|E
25|$|Various acts {{of civil}} disobedience since 1980 by the peace group Plowshares have shown how nuclear weapons {{facilities}} can be penetrated, and the group's actions represent extraordinary breaches of security at nuclear weapons plants in the United States. On July 28, 2012, three members of Plowshares cut through fences at the Y-12 National Security Complex in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, which manufactures US nuclear weapons and stockpiles highly enriched uranium. The group spray-painted protest messages, hung banners, <b>and</b> <b>splashed</b> blood.|$|E
25|$|Following Iwo Jima, John Rodgers resumed duty {{with the}} fast carrier task force raiding Japan while {{awaiting}} {{the invasion of}} Okinawa, last and greatest amphibious operation of the Pacific war. John Rodgers operated with the carriers as they continued to bomb both Japan and Okinawa. She began screening operations as the first assault wave hit the beach on 1 April. She stood by protecting the carriers <b>and</b> <b>splashed</b> two kamikazes as they dived toward the flattops. She remained in the area supporting operations until Okinawa was finally secure on 21 June.|$|E

25|$|In {{the fall}} of 1944, as the war {{advanced}} steadily across the Pacific and culminated in the climactic Battle of Leyte Gulf, {{one of the greatest}} naval engagements of all time, Hyperion had her first taste of battle. Departing Espiritu Santo 22 September, Hyperion picked up stores at Tulagi and joined TG78.8's reinforcement group which supported Admiral Daniel Barbey's Northern Attack Force TF78. She sailed into Leyte Gulf in a 33-ship convoy 29 October 1944, only three days after the conclusion of that great battle. During the next two weeks, Hyperion went to general quarters 87times, fought off 37Japanese air attacks, <b>and</b> <b>splashed</b> 2enemy planes.|$|E
25|$|Lyrical {{abstraction}} shares similarities {{with color}} field painting and abstract expressionism {{especially in the}} freewheeling usage of paint — texture and surface. Direct drawing, calligraphic use of line, the effects of brushed, splattered, stained, squeegeed, poured, <b>and</b> <b>splashed</b> paint superficially resemble the effects seen in abstract expressionism and color field painting. However the styles are markedly different. Setting it apart from abstract expressionism and action painting of the 1940s and 1950s is the approach to composition and drama. As seen in action painting there is an emphasis on brushstrokes, high compositional drama, dynamic compositional tension. While in lyrical abstraction {{there is a sense}} of compositional randomness, all over composition, low key and relaxed compositional drama and an emphasis on process, repetition, and an all over sensibility.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{the second}} and third planes were setting up for their attack. Tatum drove one of them off with gunfire, but the other pilot {{continued}} on toward the ship until a hail of gunfire caused him to lose control of his aircraft. He banked sharply to the right, passed by Tatums port side, <b>and</b> <b>splashed</b> about 100yards astern. Within seconds, his cautious comrade renewed his attack. He dove on the fast transport, barely missing the port wing of her bridge, and Tatums antiaircraft fire followed him up as he climbed, did a wing-over, and prepared to come in again. His third and final attack carried him across the ship's fantail and into the water about 50feet from her starboard quarter.|$|E

25|$|About 1:30 PM on 8 August 1809, the 600 dragoons of General of Brigade Auguste-Jean-Gabriel de Caulaincourt's brigade {{burst out}} of cover, trotted {{down to the river}} bank, <b>and</b> <b>splashed</b> into the river. They rapidly navigated the deep part of the ford and soon reached the {{shallows}} on the south bank. The 1st Extremadura Hussar Regiment and an infantry battalion from the bridge defenders tried to oppose the French cavalry. Caulaincourt's troopers set upon the Spanish hussars and soon routed them. The victorious French horsemen regrouped and charged the infantry. With its adversaries galloping toward it, the battalion tried to form square, but was unable to close the rear face before the dragoons charged through the gap. As the square broke up, many Spanish foot soldiers were hewn down or surrendered.|$|E

[...] The breed has a reputation for intelligence, courage and a good disposition. Registered Morgans {{come in a variety of}} colors although they are most commonly bay, black, and chestnut. Less common colors include gray, roan, dun, silver dapple, and cream dilutions such as palomino, [...] buckskin, cremello and perlino. In addition, three pinto color patterns are also recognized: sabino, frame overo, <b>and</b> <b>splashed</b> white. The tobiano pattern has not been noted in Morgans.|$|E

500|$|On 3 January 1927, {{following}} a venture out to Gunnamatta Bay, Gibbs was piloting a launch {{back into the}} Grays Point area of Port Hacking when a scream rang out. Gibbs looked up and noticed 15-year-old Mervyn Allum struggling in the water about [...] from the shore. Subsequent reports indicate that the other bathers first thought that Allum, who {{was known to be}} a good swimmer, was drowning. Gibbs, however, quickly realised that the youth's leg had been grabbed by a shark. Gibbs immediately dived into the water and swam towards the scene to render Allum assistance, as the latter struggled to fend off the shark. By now the water was red with blood. As Gibbs grabbed for Allum, the teenager was pulled under water. Gibbs had to strike at the shark with his legs and fists and grasp its dorsal fin before the shark would release its grip. While Gibbs' friend, Donald Campbell, rowed a boat towards the pair, Gibbs maintained a hold on the now unconscious Allum, trod water, <b>and</b> <b>splashed</b> to discourage further attacks. The shark continued to circle below during this time, at one point brushing past Gibbs' feet. As Campbell drew near, he and Gibbs managed to lift Allum aboard before Gibbs pulled himself clear of the water. Gibbs later reported that the flesh had been stripped from the ankle to the thigh on one of Allum's legs, and there was evidence of teeth and bite marks to Allum's hands and stomach; Allum was pronounced dead on arrival at hospital.|$|E
