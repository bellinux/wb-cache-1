2500|$|Navy Pier, {{located just}} east of Streeterville, is [...] long and houses retail stores, restaurants, museums, {{exhibition}} halls and auditoriums. In the summer of 2016, Navy Pier will have constructed their new DW60 Ferris wheel. Dutch Wheels, a world renowned company that manufactures ferris wheels, was selected to design the new wheel. It will feature 42 navy blue gondolas that can hold up to eight adults <b>and</b> <b>two</b> <b>kids.</b> It will also have entertainment systems inside the gondolas {{as well as a}} climate controlled environment. The DW60 will stand at approximately 196ft (60 m), which is 46ft taller than the previous wheel. The new DW60 will be the first in the United States and will be the sixth tallest in the U.S. [...] Chicago was the first city in the world to ever erect a ferris wheel.|$|E
2500|$|As {{had been}} the case with his {{teammate}} Ron Rightnowar, there was some bitterness toward Givens by the major-leaguers because of his role as a replacement player. [...] "I've spent 11½ years in the minor leagues, I have a mortgage <b>and</b> <b>two</b> <b>kids</b> to feed", he told the Sporting News in 1995. [...] "I had to pay my bills, and I couldn't see quitting not after what I've been through." [...] However, Givens also said given the chance to do it again, he would not have been a replacement player. [...] "Now that I'm here and I see how everything works, I regret what I did", Givens said in July 1995. [...] "I was really undecided and didn't want to do it, then I said I would. [...] One thing about this team, there's a bunch of really good guys here. [...] Maybe they're not all going to be our best friends off the field, but when we're on the field they're going to support us like we support them." [...] In a different interview, Givens went one step further, dismissing the talent level of some of his fellow replacement players. [...] "At the time, it's what I had to do", he told the Seattle Times in July 1995. [...] "I told everyone on the team that. [...] Of course, I regretted the decision. But I {{had to take care of}} my family. [...] Those games were a joke. [...] The talent level was horrible. [...] To put myself in the same shoes with guys off the street made me sick. [...] It wasn't really baseball." ...|$|E

Maybe I didn't have {{something}} to tell him when he blew into Hampton last Friday! But he said he couldn't help it--he loved me." [...] Lise sat up, seemingly finding relief in the relation of her wrongs, dabbing her eyes with a cheap lace handkerchief. [...] "Well, while he'd been away--this thing came. I didn't know what was the matter at first, and when I found out I was scared to death, I was ready to kill myself. When I told him he was scared too, and then he said he'd fix it. Say, I was a goat to think he'd marry me!" [...] Lise laughed hysterically.|$|E

She's a kind old woman, and I'm not frightened at her. And we live very well: {{we have plenty of}} nice things. I can have nuts if I like. And I'm not obliged to work now. I used to have to work, and I didn't like it; but I liked feeding the mules, and I should like to see poor Giannetta, the little mule, again. We've only got a goat <b>and</b> <b>two</b> <b>kids,</b> and I used to talk to the goat a good deal, because there was nobody else but Monna Lisa. But now I've got something else--can you guess what it is?" ...|$|E
