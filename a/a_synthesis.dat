5|$|Alejo Carpentier's, Reasons of State (El recurso del método, 1974), is <b>a</b> <b>synthesis</b> {{of several}} {{historical}} figures from Latin American, most prominently Gerardo Machado, dictator of Cuba.

5|$|Durkheim had an {{important}} impact {{on the development of}} Anthropology and Sociology, influencing thinkers from his school of sociology, such as Marcel Mauss, but also later thinkers, such as Maurice Halbwachs, Talcott Parsons, Alfred Radcliffe-Brown, and Claude Levi-Strauss. More recently, Durkheim has influenced sociologists such as Steven Lukes, Robert Bellah, and Pierre Bourdieu. His description of collective consciousness also deeply influenced the Turkish nationalism of Ziya Gökalp, the founding father of Turkish sociology. Randall Collins has developed a theory of what he calls interaction ritual chains, which is <b>a</b> <b>synthesis</b> of Durkheim's work on religion with Erving Goffman's micro-sociology. Goffman himself was also deeply influenced by Durkheim in his development of the interaction order.|$|E

50|$|The {{asymmetric}} {{addition of}} alkynylzinc compounds to aldehydes {{is an example}} of <b>a</b> Nef <b>synthesis,</b> <b>a</b> chemical reaction whereby a chiral propargyl alcohol is prepared from a terminal alkyne and an aldehyde. This alkynylation reaction is enantioselective and involves an alkynylzinc reagent rather than the sodium acetylide used by John Ulric Nef in his 1899 report of the synthetic approach. Propargyl alcohols are versatile precursors for the chirally-selective synthesis of natural products and pharmaceutical agents, making this asymmetric addition reaction of alkynylzinc compounds useful. For example, Erick Carreira used this approach in <b>a</b> total <b>synthesis</b> of the marine natural product leucascandrolide A, a bioactive metabolite of the calcareous sponge Leucascandra caveolata with cytotoxic and antifungal properties isolated in 1996 (<b>an</b> earlier partial <b>synthesis</b> was reported by Crimmins and <b>a</b> total <b>synthesis</b> was reported by James Leighton).|$|R
5|$|Early Medieval architecture's secular {{buildings}} were simple constructions mainly using timber with thatch for roofing. Ecclesiastical architecture ranged from <b>a</b> <b>synthesis</b> of Hiberno—Saxon monasticism, to Early Christian basilica and architecture characterised by pilaster-strips, blank arcading, baluster shafts and triangular headed openings. After the Norman conquest in 1066 various Castles in England were created so law lords could uphold their authority {{and in the}} north to protect from invasion. Some of the best-known medieval castles are the Tower of London, Warwick Castle, Durham Castle and Windsor Castle.|$|E
5|$|From 1915 Gaudí devoted himself almost {{exclusively}} to his magnum opus, the Sagrada Família, <b>a</b> <b>synthesis</b> of his architectural evolution. After completion of the crypt and the apse, still in Gothic style, {{the rest of the}} church is conceived in an organic style, imitating natural shapes with their abundance of ruled surfaces. He intended the interior to resemble a forest, with inclined columns like branching trees, helicoidal in form, creating a simple but sturdy structure. Gaudí applied all of his previous experimental findings in this project, from works such as the Park Güell and the crypt of the Colònia Güell, creating a church that is at once structurally perfect, harmonious and aesthetically satisfying.|$|E
5|$|Greatly {{expanding}} his {{familiarity with}} historical and social subjects, Kogălniceanu also {{began work on}} his first volumes: a pioneering study on the Romani people and the French-language Histoire de la Valachie, de la Moldavie et des Valaques transdanubiens ("A History of Wallachia, Moldavia, and of Transdanubian Vlachs", the first volume in <b>a</b> <b>synthesis</b> of Romanian history), {{both of which were}} first published in 1837 inside the German Confederation.

5|$|Historian Sandra Mass {{considers}} the Rommel myth a hero cult, <b>a</b> <b>synthesis</b> {{of old and}} new hero cults and traditions culled primarily from Germany's largely imaginary colonial past, in particular the proletarian hero cult originally represented by Carl Peters and the bourgeois one represented by Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck. Rommel, as portrayed by this hero cult, was both chivalrous and ruthless, young and old, harsh and gentle, strong and righteous. Calder, Duffy and Ricci opine that Rommel's military brilliance provoked a masochistic tendency to romanticise a worthy opponent, that because he was skilled at his profession, he must have been an anti-Nazi hero.|$|E

5|$|Smetana's {{visit to}} Liszt at Weimar {{in the summer}} of 1857, where he heard the latter's Faust Symphony and Die Ideale, caused a {{material}} reorientation of Smetana's orchestral music. These works gave Smetana answers to many compositional problems relating to the structure of orchestral music, and suggested a means for expressing literary subjects by <b>a</b> <b>synthesis</b> between music and text, rather than by simple musical illustration. These insights enabled Smetana to write the three Gothenburg symphonic poems, (RichardIII, Wallenstein's Camp and Hakon Jarl), works that transformed Smetana from a composer primarily of salon pieces to a modern neo-Romantic, capable of handling large-scale forces and demonstrating the latest musical concepts.|$|E
