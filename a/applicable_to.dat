5|$|The Due Process Clause prohibits {{state and}} local {{government}} officials from depriving persons of life, liberty, or property without legislative authorization.

5|$|The best {{interests}} of society require that causes of action should not be deferred an unreasonable time. This remark is peculiarly <b>applicable</b> <b>to</b> land titles.

Labor is paralysed where the enjoyment of its fruits is uncertain; and litigation without limit produces ruinous consequences to individuals.|$|E

5|$|The patrons {{ensured that}} cricket was financed in the 18th century but their interest, equally <b>applicable</b> <b>to</b> horse racing and prizefighting, {{was based on}} the {{opportunities}} that cricket provided for gambling.

The early newspapers recognised this and were more interested in publishing the odds than the match scores. Reports would say who won the wager rather than who won the match.|$|E
5|$|This {{can be used}} {{to derive}} the {{correlation}} of the quantum polarisations of the two photons. Their prediction was confirmed experimentally by Chien-Shiung Wu and I. Shaknov in 1950. This was the first experimental confirmation of a pair of entangled photons as <b>applicable</b> <b>to</b> the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox. The result was subsequently explained by Richard Dalitz and Frank Duarte. Apparently following Dirac's doctrine, Ward was never bothered by issues of interpretation in quantum mechanics.|$|E
