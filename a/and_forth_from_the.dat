5|$|During {{the siege}} of Echinus by Philip V of Macedon in 211BC, the besiegers built {{underground}} tunnels to protect the soldiers and sappers as they went back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> camp to the siege works. These included two siege towers connected by a makeshift wickerwork curtain wall mounted with stone-shooting ballistae, and sheds to protect {{the approach of the}} battering ram. Despite the early reputation of Macedon as a leader in siege technology, Alexandria in Ptolemaic Egypt became the center for technological improvements to the catapult by the 3rdcenturyBC, as evidenced by the writings of Philo of Alexandria.|$|E
5|$|On June 12, 2012, Greg Skrepenak was {{released}} from a halfway house. He had been transferred from federal prison in Beckley, West Virginia to the halfway house in early April. Since then, he moved back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> halfway house to his parent's home in Dallas, Pennsylvania, with his parents and his children. He has been released from {{the custody of the}} U.S. Bureau of Prisons and is serving three years probation. Since his release, he has worked as a legal researcher for a Kingston law firm.|$|E
5|$|Alipate {{practice}}d {{with both}} the Los Angeles Raiders and the New York Jets in 1993, but he {{failed to make the}} active rosters for either team. In 1994, Alipate was again among the Jets' final cuts {{before the start of the}} regular season, but he was offered a spot on the team's practice squad. The Jets frequently moved Alipate back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> practice squad and the active roster throughout the season. On November 14, Alipate recovered a botched punt in a 17–10 loss to the Green Bay Packers. Alipate also forced a fumble in a November 27 game against the Miami Dolphins. He finished the season with eight games played for the Jets. When active, Alipate was used mostly on special teams. He was signed to the Green Bay Packers' practice squad in January 1995. He re-signed with the Packers on February 21 and was waived on June 12, 1995.|$|E

5|$|The first {{champions of}} French {{football}} were Standard Athletic Club, who defeated The White Rovers 2–0 in Courbevoie on 6 May 1894. The initial championship match {{was held on}} 29 April but finished 2–2, so the match was replayed. Standard {{went on to win}} the French championship four more times over the next seven years before RC Roubaix took control of the league becoming the first French club to win three straight titles beginning in 1902. Following Roubaix's success, the ownership of the amateur league title began rotating back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> north of France to the south of France with Marseille eventually winning the last amateur title in 1929.|$|E
5|$|Peet {{decided to}} follow closely the dramatic, dark, and {{sinister}} tone of Kipling's book, {{which is about the}} struggles between animals and man. However, the film's writers decided to make the story more straightforward, as the novel is very episodic, with Mowgli going back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> jungle to the Man-Village, and Peet felt that Mowgli returning to the Man-Village should be the ending for the film. Following suggestions, Peet also created two original characters: The human girl for which Mowgli falls in love, as the animators considered that falling in love would be the best excuse for Mowgli to leave the jungle; and Louie, king of the monkeys. Louie was a less comical character, enslaving Mowgli trying to get the boy to teach him to make fire. The orangutan would also show a plot point borrowed from The Second Jungle Book, gold and jewels under his ruins— after Mowgli got to the man village, a poacher would drag the boy back to the ruins in search for the treasure. Disney was not pleased with how the story was turning out, as he felt it was too dark for family viewing and insisted on script changes. Peet refused, and after a long argument, Peet left the Disney studio in January 1964.|$|E
5|$|The {{residents}} initially {{arrive at}} the hospital each morning and argue over who will care for a certain patient that arrives each day. A hospital superior {{is in charge of}} assigning cases, often translating to tense feelings between the residents and their superiors. Episodes migrate back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> doctors interacting with their patients, and with their co-workers. Once assigned a case, each doctor diagnoses the patient, {{with the help of his}} or her attending physician, which usually leads to surgery. The surgeons tend to form personal connections with their patients, with a patient often conveying a message to his or her doctor, which unintentionally relates to the doctor's private life. The show displays the growth of relationships between the doctors, either friendly or sexual, often stemming to a clash between their personal and professional lives. Emotional scenes are often accompanied by an indie rock background song, something that has become a hallmark of the series. At the conclusion of each episode, one of the characters delivers another voice-over, typically contrasting or following up on their initial one.|$|E
60|$|And {{just then}} the sound of voices reached them, <b>and</b> looking <b>forth</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{verandah}} they saw Huish and the captain drawing near.|$|R

25|$|Blake {{maintained}} a nomadic existence {{for nearly all}} {{the remainder of his}} long life. With the exception of the wartime era, he traveled back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> mainland to Hawaii every year until the mid 1950s. While in Hawaii, he usually lived in a beach shack or aboard a boat; on the mainland he often lived out of his car. He typically supported himself by working as a lifeguard, an occupation he pursued into his early sixties.|$|E
500|$|Due to the {{increasing}} demand for the group with gruelling schedules including spending over thirteen weeks in America filming the first series of their show and their subsequent television specials, the members often felt that the travelling back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> UK and the US was [...] "perhaps more tiring than what we were actually going out to America to do". Paul Cattermole once commented that {{the speed of the}} schedule sometimes caused a [...] "kind of dreamscape in your head", as the group often felt [...] "jetlagged and tired". On top of the filming schedules, the group often performed at high-profile pop music festivals such as Party in the Park where they performed for 100,000 fans. The intensity of the schedule would be a constant battle for the group and was going to continue to take its toll for all the years S Club 7 were together. In spite of this, the group always remained in solidarity that they were all good friends, [...] "cared for each other a lot" [...] and supported each other through difficult times in the group.|$|E
2500|$|After seeing Crane's {{performance}} on The Dick Van Dyke Show, Donna Reed {{offered him a}} guest shot on her program. [...] After the success of that episode his character, Dr. David Kelsey, was incorporated into the story line and Crane became a regular cast member, beginning with the [...] "Friends and Neighbors" [...] episode. [...] Crane continued to work full-time at KNX during his stint on The Donna Reed Show, running back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> KNX studio at Columbia Square to Columbia Studios. [...] He left the show in December 1964.|$|E

60|$|It was {{certainly}} {{a fact that the}} large lamp which illuminated the staircase now burned dim and duskily; so that several figures which passed hastily down <b>the</b> stairs <b>and</b> went <b>forth</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> porch appeared rather like shadows than persons of fleshly substance.|$|R
6000|$|Up there sprang a tall, white {{flame of}} fire, waving like a tongue of light; <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> heap jumped the most beautiful, strong, funny, black cat that ever was seen! ...|$|E

5000|$|So, {{at a later}} time, {{while still}} young, a black-haired young man endowed with the blessings of youth {{in the first stage}} of life—and while my parents, unwilling, were crying with tears {{streaming}} down their faces—I shaved off my hair & beard, put on the ochre robe <b>and</b> went <b>forth</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> home life into homelessness.

6000|$|... 'Well, {{if she is}} as {{beautiful}} as that, I will have her for my Queen,' said the King, and he commanded the youth {{to go home and}} fetch her without a moment's delay, and to lose no time in coming back.

60|$|Having {{completed}} the search in the bungalows, the boys, {{followed by the}} others, went outside.

60|$|That {{he was not}} {{discovered}} was a miracle, for mounted warriors {{were constantly}} riding back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> camp into the forest; but the long day wore on and still he continued his seemingly fruitless quest, until, near sunset, he came opposite a mighty gate in the city's western wall.|$|E
60|$|Then fell a great silence, {{as if all}} waited some word of doom. A {{multitude}} of eyes timidly stole back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Emperor to me and from me to the Emperor. And I had wit to keep the silence and to stand there, arms folded, haughty and remote.|$|E
