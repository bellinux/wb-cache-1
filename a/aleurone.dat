The seeds may be flat, oblong, angular, , ellipsoid or globose (spherical), or compressed with a well developed epidermis. The exterior may be smooth or roughened, with a wing or raphe (ridge), aril or one to two tails, rarely hairy, but may be dull or shiny {{and the lack of}} a black integument distinguishes them from related taxa such as Allioideae that were previously included in this family, and striate (parallel longitudinally ridged) in the Steptopoideae. The hilum (scar) is generally inconspicuous. The bitegmic (separate testa and tegmen) seed coat itself may be thin, suberose (like cork), or crustaceous (hard or brittle). The endosperm is abundant, cartilaginous (fleshy) or horny and contains oils and <b>aleurone</b> but not starch (non-farinaceous). Its cells are polyploid (triploid or pentaploid, depending on the embryo sac type). The embryo is small (usually less than one quarter of seed volume), axile (radially sectioned), linear (longer than broad) or rarely rudimentary (tiny relative to endosperm) depending on placentation type, and straight, bent, curved or curled at the upper end.|$|E
25|$|Most of the niacin in mature {{cereal grains}} is present as niacytin, which is niacin {{bound up in}} a complex with {{hemicellulose}} which is nutritionally unavailable. In mature corn this may be up to 90% of the total niacin content. The preparation method of nixtamalization using the whole dried corn kernel made this niacin nutritionally available and reduced the chance of developing pellagra. Niacytin is concentrated in the <b>aleurone</b> and germ layers which are removed by milling. The milling and degerming of corn {{in the preparation of}} cornmeal became feasible with the development of the Beall degerminator which was originally patented in 1901 and was used to separate the grit from the germ in corn processing. However this process of degermination reduces the niacin content of the cornmeal.|$|E
25|$|The {{milling of cereals}} {{results in}} {{considerable}} loss (up to 60%) of vitamin B2, so white flour is enriched in some countries such as US by addition of the vitamin. The enrichment of bread and ready-to-eat breakfast cereals contributes significantly to the dietary supply of vitamin B2. Polished rice is not usually enriched, because the vitamin’s yellow color would make the rice visually unacceptable to the major rice-consumption populations. However, most of the flavin content of whole brown rice is retained if the rice is steamed (parboiled) prior to milling. This process drives the flavins in the germ and <b>aleurone</b> layers into the endosperm. Free riboflavin is naturally present in foods along with protein-bound FMN and FAD. Bovine milk contains mainly free riboflavin, with a minor contribution from FMN and FAD. In whole milk, 14% of the flavins are bound noncovalently to specific proteins. in Bovine Milk: its concentration, distribution, and binding linkage, J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol., 37, 15, 1991 Egg white and egg yolk contain specialized riboflavin-binding proteins, which are required for storage of free riboflavin in the egg {{for use by the}} developing embryo.|$|E
2500|$|... 'Betzes', an old German two-row barley, was {{introduced}} into North America from Kraków, Poland, by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). The Montana and Idaho agricultural experiment stations released Betzes in 1957. It is a midshort, medium strength-strawed, midseason-maturing barley. It has a midsize-to-large kernels with yellow <b>aleurones.</b> Betzes {{is susceptible to}} loose and covered smuts, rusts, and scald.|$|R
40|$|The {{physiological}} and molecular bases for contrasting [alpha]-amylase phenotypes {{were examined in}} germinating seeds of two barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) cultivars, Morex and Steptoe. Morex is a high-quality malting barley that develops high [alpha]-amylase activity soon after germination. Steptoe is a feed barley that develops only low [alpha]-amylase activity levels during this period. The expression of all high- and low-isoelectric point (pl) [alpha]-amylase isozymes is reduced in Steptoe. The amount of [alpha]-amylase mRNA per gram of seedling tissue is correspondingly lower in Steptoe. Southern blot analysis revealed that the cultivars have the same copy number and organization for most high- and low-pl genes. Steptoe seedlings or embryoless half-seeds produce little [alpha]-amylase in response to exogenous applications of gibberellic acid (GA 3) compared with Morex. However, when isolated <b>aleurones</b> of both cultivars are treated with GA 3, they produce similar amounts of high- and low-pl [alpha]-amylase RNAs. This suggests that {{a factor in the}} starchy endosperm is responsible for lowered [alpha]-amylase response in Steptoe. The factor is probably not abscisic acid (ABA), since the two cultivars have similar concentrations of ABA during germination...|$|R
5000|$|Corn silk {{can control}} the types of pollen that an ear of corn will accept through {{expression}} of certain forms of the Gametophyte Factor 1 gene. Many races of popcorn, of the everta type, will greatly slow the development of pollen tubes from any pollen that does not carry a similar form of Ga1-S or Ga1-M, thereby preventing the ingression of genes (natural or engineered) from other types of corn. The popcorn remains free to donate its genes via its own pollen to other types of corn. The effectiveness of this restriction can be measured by planting the popcorn beside purple dent corn; the xenia effect would cause the formation of purple <b>aleurones</b> if kernels permitted themselves to be fertilized by pollen from outside the group. [...] Organic farmers are pursuing the transfer {{of some of these}} mechanisms into non-popcorn strains for purposes of preventing inadvertent pollination by GMO corn, which under U.S. regulations can cause their product to be rejected as organic corn, and for which they have no recourse against GMO growers.|$|R
2500|$|... 'Pinnacle', {{a variety}} {{released}} by the North Dakota Agricultural Experiment Station in 2006, has high yield, low protein, long rachilla hairs, smooth awns, white <b>aleurone,</b> medium-late maturity, medium height, and strong straw strength.|$|E
2500|$|... 'Beacon', a six-rowed {{malting barley}} with rough awns, short {{rachilla}} hairs and colorless <b>aleurone,</b> {{it was released}} in 1973, {{and was the first}} North Dakota State University (NDSU)barley that had resistance to loose smut.|$|E
2500|$|... 'Sioux', a {{selection}} from Tregal released by NDSU, was a six-row, medium-early variety with white <b>aleurone,</b> rough awns, and long rachilla hairs. It was high-yielding with plump kernels. Its disease reaction {{was similar to}} 'Tregal'.|$|E
40|$|The C 1, B and R genes {{regulating}} the maize anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway encode tissue-specific regulatory proteins with similarities to transcriptional activators. The C 1 and R regulatory genes are usually responsible for pigmentation of seed tissues, and the B-Peru allele of B, {{but not the}} B-I allele, can substitute for R function in the seed. In this study, members of the B family of regulatory genes were delivered to intact maize tissues by high velocity microprojectiles. In colorless r <b>aleurones</b> or embryos, {{the introduction of the}} B-Peru genomic clone or the expressed cDNAs of B-Peru or B-I resulted in anthocyanin-producing cells. Luciferase produced from the Bronze 1 anthocyanin structural gene promoter was induced 100 -fold when co-introduced with the expressed B-Peru or B-I cDNAs. This quantitative transactivation assay demonstrates that the proteins encoded by these two B alleles are equally able to transactivate the Bronze 1 promoter. Analogous results were obtained using embryogenic callus cells. These observations suggest that one major contribution towards tissue-specific anthocyanin synthesis controlled by the various alleles of the B and R genes is the differential expression of functionally similar proteins...|$|R
40|$|Plant cystatins are inhibitors of cysteine-proteases of the papain C 1 A and legumain C 13 families. Cystatin {{data from}} {{multiple}} plant species {{have suggested that}} these inhibitors act as defense proteins against pests and pathogens and as regulators of protein turnover. In this study, we characterize the entire cystatin gene family from barley (Hordeum vulgare), which contain 13 nonredundant genes, and identify and characterize their target enzymes, the barley cathepsin L-like proteases. Cystatins and proteases were expressed and purified from Escherichia coli cultures. Each cystatin {{was found to have}} different inhibitory capability against barley cysteine-proteases in in vitro inhibitory assays using specific substrates. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction revealed that inhibitors and enzymes present a wide variation in their messenger RNA expression patterns. Their transcripts were mainly detected in developing and germinating seeds, and some of them were also expressed in leaves and roots. Subcellular localization of cystatins and cathepsin L-like proteases fused to green fluorescent protein demonstrated the presence of both protein families throughout the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi complex. Proteases and cystatins not only colocalized but also interacted in vivo in the plant cell, as revealed by bimolecular fluorescence complementation. The functional relationship between cystatins and cathepsin L-like proteases was inferred from their common implication as counterparts of mobilization of storage proteins upon barley seed germination. The opposite pattern of transcription expression in gibberellin-treated <b>aleurones</b> presented by inhibitors and enzymes allowed proteases to specifically degrade B, C, and D hordeins stored in the endosperm of barley seeds...|$|R
40|$|The current {{model of}} {{gibberellin}} (GA) signal transduction {{is based on}} a derepressible system and a number of candidate negative regulators have been identified in Arabidopsis. We previously have reported the identification of the Arabidopsis gene SHORT INTERNODES (SHI) that causes suppression of GA responses when constitutively activated. In this paper, we show by using reporter gene analysis that the SHI gene is expressed in young organs, e. g. shoot apices and root tips. The model predicts a suppressor of GA responses to be active in these tissues to prevent premature growth or development. To study the effect of SHI on GA signaling, we used a functional assay that measures effects of signaling components on a well-defined GA response; the up-regulation of α-amylase in barley (Hordeum vulgare) <b>aleurones</b> in response to GA treatment. We found that SHI was able to specifically block the activity of a high-isoelectric point α-amylase promoter following GA 3 treatment, which further supports that SHI is a suppressor of GA responses. We have identified two putative loss-of-function insertion alleles of SHI and lines homozygous for either of the new alleles show no phenotypic deviations from wild type. Because SHI belongs to a gene family consisting of nine members, we suggest that SHI and the SHI-related genes are functionally redundant. We also show that a functional ERECTA allele is able to partly suppress the dwarfing effect of the shi gain-of-function mutation, suggesting that the erecta mutation harbored by the Landsberg erecta ecotype is an enhancer of the shi dwarf phenotype...|$|R
2500|$|Within the seed, there {{usually is}} a store of {{nutrients}} for the seedling that will grow from the embryo. [...] The {{form of the}} stored nutrition varies depending {{on the kind of}} plant. In angiosperms, the stored food begins as a tissue called the endosperm, which is derived from the mother plant and the pollen via double fertilization. It is usually triploid, and is rich in oil or starch, and protein. In gymnosperms, such as conifers, the food storage tissue (also called endosperm) is part of the female gametophyte, a haploid tissue. The endosperm is surrounded by the <b>aleurone</b> layer (peripheral endosperm), filled with proteinaceous <b>aleurone</b> grains.|$|E

2500|$|Gibberellins, or GAs, {{include a}} large range of {{chemicals}} that are produced naturally within plants and by fungi. They were first discovered when Japanese researchers, including Eiichi Kurosawa, noticed a chemical {{produced by a}} fungus called Gibberella fujikuroi that produced abnormal growth in rice plants. Gibberellins are important in seed germination, affecting enzyme production that mobilizes food production used for growth of new cells. [...] This is done by modulating chromosomal transcription. [...] In grain (rice, wheat, corn, etc.) seeds, a layer of cells called the <b>aleurone</b> layer wraps around the endosperm tissue. Absorption of water by the seed causes production of GA. [...] The GA is transported to the <b>aleurone</b> layer, which responds by producing enzymes that break down stored food reserves within the endosperm, which are utilized by the growing seedling. GAs produce bolting of rosette-forming plants, increasing internodal length. They promote flowering, cellular division, and in seeds growth after germination. Gibberellins also reverse the inhibition of shoot growth and dormancy induced by ABA.|$|E

6000|$|It is a {{far more}} {{remarkable}} problem how the members of this family, and Pinguicula, and, as Dr. Hooker has recently shown, Nepenthes, could all have acquired the power of secreting a fluid which dissolves or digests animal matter. The six genera of the Droseraceae very probably inherited this power from a common progenitor, but this cannot apply to [page 362] Pinguicula or Nepenthes, for these plants are not at all closely related to the Droceraceae. But the difficulty is not nearly so great as it at first appears. Firstly, the juices of many plants contain an acid, and, apparently, any acid serves for digestion. Secondly, as Dr. Hooker has remarked in relation to the present subject in his address at Belfast (1874), and as Sachs repeatedly insists,* the embryos of some plants secrete a fluid which dissolves albuminous substances out of the endosperm; although the endosperm is not actually united with, only in contact with, the embryo. All plants, moreover, have the power of dissolving albuminous or proteid substances, such as protoplasm, chlorophyll, gluten, <b>aleurone,</b> and of carrying them from one part to other parts of their tissues. This must be effected by a solvent, probably consisting of a ferment together with an acid. Now, in the case of plants which are able to absorb already soluble matter from captured insects, though not capable of true digestion, the solvent just referred to, which must be occasionally present in the glands, would be apt to exude from the glands together with the viscid secretion, inasmuch as endosmose is accompanied by exosmose. If such exudation did ever occur, the solvent would act on the animal matter contained within the captured insects, and this would be an act of true digestion. As it cannot be doubted that this process would be of high service to plants ...|$|E
5000|$|The <b>aleurone</b> layer {{surrounds}} the endosperm tissue of grass seeds and is morphologically and biochemically distinct from it. Starchy endosperm cells are large, irregularly shaped cells and contain starch grains while <b>aleurone</b> cells are cuboidal {{in shape and}} contain <b>aleurone</b> grains. In most cultivated cereals (wheat species, rye, oats, rice and maize) the <b>aleurone</b> is single-layered, whereas barley has a multicellular <b>aleurone</b> layer. Thick primary cell walls enclose and protect the <b>aleurone</b> cells.|$|E
50|$|The <b>aleurone</b> {{layer is}} {{important}} for both the developing seed and the mature plant. The <b>aleurone</b> tissue accumulates large quantities of oils and lipids that are useful during seed development. It is also a site of mineral storage and in some species, functions in seed dormancy. The <b>aleurone</b> may also express several pathogen-protective proteins including PR-4. <b>Aleurone</b> also serves as the most dietarily beneficial fraction in many brans. In addition, the <b>aleurone</b> tissue contains many protein-storing vacuoles known as protein bodies. In cereals with starchy endosperm, the <b>aleurone</b> contains about 30% of the kernel's proteins. In multicolored corn, anthocyanin pigments in the <b>aleurone</b> layer give the kernels a dark, bluish-black color.|$|E
50|$|<b>Aleurone</b> {{proteins}} {{can have}} two different morphological features, homogenous and heterogeneous. The homogenous <b>aleurone</b> consists of similar protein bodies (e.g. Phaseolus vulgaris) while the heterogeneous <b>aleurone</b> consists of granules of different shapes {{and types of}} proteins covered with a membrane (e.g. Ricinus communis).|$|E
50|$|Mutants of the dek1 gene {{block the}} {{formation}} of <b>aleurone</b> and cause the cells to develop as starchy endosperm cells instead of <b>aleurone</b> cells. This causes the seed to lack an <b>aleurone</b> layer. This mutation {{is caused by the}} insertion of a Mu transposon into the dek1 gene, causing it to function incorrectly. However, this transposon may sometimes remove itself from the gene, restoring the function of dek1. Experiments in this area have helped demonstrate that the cues that determine <b>aleurone</b> positioning are still present in the later stages of development, and the <b>aleurone</b> cells still respond to these cues.|$|E
50|$|In addition, several hormones {{influence}} {{the development of}} the <b>aleurone</b> layer, including auxin, cytokinin, abscisic acid (ABA), and gibberellin (GA). Auxin and cytokinin {{play a role in the}} earlier stages of <b>aleurone</b> development. The maturation of <b>aleurone</b> is promoted by ABA while germination is promoted by GA.|$|E
50|$|<b>Aleurone</b> (from Greek aleuron, flour) is {{a protein}} found in protein {{granules}} of maturing seeds and tubers. The term also describes {{one of the}} two major cell types of the endosperm, the <b>aleurone</b> layer. The <b>aleurone</b> layer is the outermost layer of the endosperm, followed by the inner starchy endosperm. This layer of cells is sometimes referred to as the peripheral endosperm. It lies between the pericarp and the hyaline layer of the endosperm. Unlike the cells of the starchy endosperm, <b>aleurone</b> cells remain alive at maturity.|$|E
5000|$|The {{development}} of the <b>aleurone</b> layer involves several periclinal, and anticlinal cell divisions and several steps of genetic regulation. The dek1 gene and crinkly4 (cr4) kinase both function as positive regulators of <b>aleurone</b> cell fate. The normal dek1 gene is {{needed in order to}} receive and respond to positional cues that determine the fate of <b>aleurone</b> cells during development.|$|E
50|$|The <b>aleurone</b> layer {{performs}} {{a variety of}} functions to help maintain proper development of the seed. One {{example of this is}} maintaining a low pH in the apoplast. In cereals, the <b>aleurone</b> layer releases organic and phosphoric acids {{in order to keep the}} pH of the endosperm between a pH of 3.5 and 4. In barley, the <b>aleurone</b> layer also releases nitrite into the starchy endosperm and apoplast under anaerobic conditions. In addition, although the function is unclear, a certain class of hemoglobins (Hb)is present in the outer layer of living cells including the <b>aleurone</b> tissue in barley and rice seeds.|$|E
50|$|The first {{reported}} GA-binding protein (GBP) activity {{was discovered in}} wheat seed <b>aleurone</b> homogenates by using the GA-dependent induction of aleuron hydrolytic enzymes. Alpha-amylase induction in <b>aleurone</b> protoplasts is dependent on GA levels, but induction can still occur if GA does not pass through the plasma membrane. The existence of GA perception outside the cell and a plasma membrane GA receptor in <b>aleurone</b> cells can be concluded from these observations. Trimeric G proteins are involved in GA signaling, which supports the previous theory for plasma membrane GA receptors. Four different GBPs have been discovered in the plasma membrane of aleuron cells. Cereal <b>aleurone</b> cells could be unique in GA perception because they {{are some of the}} few plant cells that cannot synthesize bioactive GA.|$|E

50|$|The <b>aleurone</b> is {{the outer}} layer of {{endosperm}} cells, {{present in all}} small grains and retained in many dicots with transient endosperm.

5000|$|Similar to the dek1 {{mutation}}, genes with a {{mutation in}} the cr4 gene also cause a switch in {{the fate of}} <b>aleurone</b> cells.

Plants with a mutated cr4 gene are shorter than normal and produce crinkled leaves.|$|E
50|$|During seed germination, {{the plant}} embryo {{produces}} the hormone gibberellin which triggers the <b>aleurone</b> cells to release α-amylase for the hydrolysis of starch, proteases, and storage proteins into the endosperm. Evidence that G-proteins {{play a role}} in the gibberellin signaling events has been obtained. The breakdown of the starchy endosperm supplies sugars to drive the growth of roots and the acrospire. This release of amylase is considered to be the most important and sole function of the <b>aleurone</b> layer. This effect is inhibited by the plant hormone abscisic acid, which keeps the seed dormant. After completing this function, the <b>aleurone</b> cells in the developing seed undergo apoptosis.|$|E
