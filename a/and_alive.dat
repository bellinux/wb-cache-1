5|$|Certain species form {{communities}} called microatolls, {{which are}} colonies whose top {{is dead and}} mostly above the water line, but whose perimeter is mostly submerged <b>and</b> <b>alive.</b> Average tide level limits their height. By analyzing the various growth morphologies, microatolls offer a low resolution record of sea level change. Fossilized microatolls can also be dated using Radiocarbon dating. Such methods can help to reconstruct Holocene sea levels.|$|E
5|$|An ugly reef is this of the Dhu Heartach; no {{pleasant}} {{assemblage of}} shelves, and pools, and creeks, about which a child might {{play for a}} whole summer without weariness, like the Bell Rock or the Skerryvore, but one oval nodule of black-trap, sparsely bedabbled with an inconspicuous fucus, <b>and</b> <b>alive</b> in every crevice with a dingy insect between a slater and a bug. No other life was there but of sea-birds, and of the sea itself, that here ran like a mill-race, and growled about the outer reef for ever, and ever and again, in the calmest weather, roared and spouted on the rock itself.|$|E

5|$|Early {{pressings}} of {{the sleeve}} {{were presented in}} a six-panel gatefold cover, with one side displaying the landscape in the daytime, whilst the other shows the same image at night, playing {{with the idea that}} during the day, the countryside is glorious and the city is dull and grey, whereas at nighttime the countryside is dark and the city is illuminated <b>and</b> <b>alive.</b> To prioritize the design, no text was included on the sleeve apart from a promotional sticker shaped like a red balloon featuring the band's name and album title. Later copies of the album came in a standard plastic case with a protective cardboard sleeve.|$|E
5|$|The gods then {{do battle}} with the invaders: Odin is {{swallowed}} whole <b>and</b> <b>alive</b> fighting the wolf Fenrir, causing his wife Frigg her second great sorrow (the first being {{the death of her}} son, the god Baldr). Odin's son Víðarr avenges his father by rending Fenrir's jaws apart and stabbing it in the heart with his spear, thus killing the wolf. The serpent Jörmungandr opens its gaping maw, yawning widely in the air, and is met in combat by Thor. Thor, also a son of Odin and described here as protector of the earth, furiously fights the serpent, defeating it, but Thor is only able to take nine steps afterward before collapsing. The god Freyr fights Surtr and loses. After this, people flee their homes, and the sun becomes black while the earth sinks into the sea, the stars vanish, steam rises, and flames touch the heavens.|$|E

25|$|While each playwright {{will take}} {{his or her}} own approach, Kenneth Cavander, the playwright who {{undertook}} and completed this task for Timon of Athens felt that the trick was to leave what is immediate <b>and</b> <b>alive</b> to our ears in the original untouched and only elsewhere to unpack whatever might hinder the free flow of the story {{in a way that is}} clear, not over-reverent, and above all, actable, so that the result is clear and compelling to a contemporary audience while preserving the spirit of the original.|$|E
25|$|In January 2011, Skillet {{confirmed}} {{that they would}} be touring with Stone Sour and Theory of a Deadman on the Avalanche Tour.

25|$|Other computer-generated {{imagery in}} the film {{includes}} the ant coming out of Dae-su's arm (according to the making-of on the DVD the whole arm was CGI) and the ants crawling over him afterwards. The octopus being eaten alive was not computer-generated; four were used during the making of this scene. Actor Choi Min-sik, a Buddhist, said a prayer for each one. The eating of squirming octopuses (called san-nakji (산낙지) in Korean) as a delicacy exists in East Asia, although it is usually killed and cut, not eaten whole <b>and</b> <b>alive.</b> Usually, it is the nerve activity in the octopus' tentacles makes the pieces still squirming posthumously on the plate when served. When asked in DVD commentary if he felt sorry for Choi, director Park Chan-wook stated he felt more sorry for the octopus.|$|E
500|$|I {{began to}} see an {{attractive}} ensemble—sailors, whalers, girls {{who worked in the}} mills up the river, clambakes on near-by islands, an amusement park on the seaboard, things people could do in crowds, people who were strong <b>and</b> <b>alive</b> and lusty, people who had always been depicted on the stage as thin-lipped puritans—a libel I was anxious to refute... as for the two leading characters, Julie with her courage and inner strength and outward simplicity seemed more indigenous to Maine than to Budapest. [...] Liliom is, of course, an international character, indigenous to nowhere.|$|E
