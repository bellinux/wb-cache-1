5|$|The Moon has an {{exceptionally}} low albedo, {{giving it a}} reflectance that is slightly brighter than that of worn asphalt. Despite this, it is the brightest object in the sky after the Sun. This {{is partly due to}} the brightness enhancement of the opposition effect; at quarter phase, the Moon is only one-tenth <b>as</b> <b>bright,</b> rather than half <b>as</b> <b>bright,</b> as at full moon.|$|E
5|$|Namaka is only 1.5% <b>as</b> <b>bright</b> as {{its parent}} dwarf planet Haumea {{and is about}} 0.05% its mass. If {{it turns out to}} have a similar albedo, it would be about 170km in diameter. Photometric {{observations}} indicate that its surface is made of water ice.|$|E
5|$|Styx was {{discovered}} by {{a team led by}} astronomer Mark R. Showalter, using fourteen sets of images taken between 26 June and 9 July 2012 by the Wide Field Camera 3 fitted to the Hubble Space Telescope. The discovery was announced on 11 July 2012. Styx is about half <b>as</b> <b>bright</b> as the dimmest previously known object in the system, Kerberos, and about one hundred thousandth <b>as</b> <b>bright</b> as Pluto. It was designated S/2012 (134340) 1, and informally referred to as P5.|$|E
50|$|The Comic is a 1969 Pathécolor comedy film co-written, co-produced, and {{directed}} by Carl Reiner. It stars Dick Van Dyke <b>as</b> Billy <b>Bright</b> (which was the original title of the film), Michele Lee <b>as</b> <b>Bright's</b> love interest, and Reiner himself and Mickey Rooney <b>as</b> <b>Bright's</b> friends and work colleagues. Reiner wrote the screenplay with Aaron Ruben; it {{was inspired by the}} end of silent film era, and, in part, by the life of silent film superstar Buster Keaton.|$|R

5|$|First {{observed}} in September 2006, the supernova SN 2006gy, which {{occurred in a}} galaxy called NGC 1260 (240 million light-years away), is the largest and, until confirmation of luminosity of SN 2005ap in October 2007, the most luminous supernova ever observed. The explosion was at least 100 times more luminous than any previously observed supernova, with the progenitor star being estimated 150 times more massive than the Sun. Although this had some characteristics of a Type Ia supernova, Hydrogen {{was found in the}} spectrum. It is thought that SN 2006gy is a likely candidate for a pair-instability supernova. SN 2005ap, which was discovered by Robert Quimby who also discovered SN 2006gy, was about twice <b>as</b> <b>bright</b> as SN 2006gy and about 300 times <b>as</b> <b>bright</b> as a normal type II supernova.|$|E
5|$|Arthur William Radford {{was born}} on 27 February 1896 in Chicago, to John Arthur Radford, a Canadian-born {{electrical}} engineer, and Agnes Eliza Radford (née Knight). The eldest of four children, he was described <b>as</b> <b>bright</b> and energetic in his youth. When Arthur {{was six years old}} the family moved to Riverside, Illinois, where his father {{took a job as a}} managing engineer with Commonwealth Edison Company. John Radford managed the first steam turbine engines in the United States, at the Fisk Street Generating Station.|$|E
5|$|As of 2006, {{the star}} {{with the highest}} known {{absolute}} magnitude is LBV 1806-20, with a magnitude of −14.2. This star is at least 5,000,000 times more luminous than the Sun. The least luminous stars that are currently known {{are located in the}} NGC 6397 cluster. The faintest red dwarfs in the cluster were magnitude 26, while a 28th magnitude white dwarf was also discovered. These faint stars are so dim that their light is <b>as</b> <b>bright</b> as a birthday candle on the Moon when viewed from the Earth.|$|E

50|$|By {{the time}} he was 45, Childs was living in Baltimore, Maryland, and he had {{developed}} cirrhosis and nephritis (known <b>as</b> <b>Bright's</b> disease at the time). He died in Baltimore on November 8, 1912. He was buried there at Loudon Park Cemetery.|$|R
5000|$|Modern day LCD {{displays}} implement FSC {{by using}} several colors of LED backlight, by cycling the backlights, and gain several advantages such <b>as</b> <b>brighter</b> colors, darker blacks, and lower cost. [...] These displays {{are used in}} LCD Camera viewfinders and other industrial applications.|$|R
5|$|Chhinnamasta is {{described}} as being as red as the hibiscus flower or <b>as</b> <b>bright</b> as a million suns. She is usually depicted as red or orange in complexion and sometimes as black. She is depicted mostly nude; however, she is so posed that her genitals are generally hidden or a multi-hooded cobra or jewellery around the waist covers them. She is depicted as being young and slim. She {{is described}} as a sixteen-year-old girl with full breasts, adorned with lotuses or having a single blue lotus near her heart. Sometimes, she is partially or fully clothed.|$|E
5|$|Despite its {{relative}} brightness (it {{is about a}} fifth <b>as</b> <b>bright</b> as Pluto), Makemake was not discovered until after many much fainter Kuiper belt objects. Most searches for minor planets are conducted relatively close to the ecliptic (the region of the sky that the Sun, Moon and planets appear to lie in, as seen from Earth), due to the greater likelihood of finding objects there. It probably escaped detection during the earlier surveys due to {{its relative}}ly high orbital inclination, {{and the fact that}} it was at its farthest distance from the ecliptic at the time of its discovery, in the northern constellation of Coma Berenices.|$|E
5|$|GK Persei, {{also known}} as Nova Persei 1901, is a bright nova that {{appeared}} halfway between Algol and Delta Persei. Discovered on 21 February 1901 by Scottish amateur astronomer Thomas David Anderson, it peaked at magnitude 0.2almost <b>as</b> <b>bright</b> as Capella and Vega. It faded to magnitude 13 around 30 years after its peak brightness. Xi Persei, traditionally known as Menkhib, a blue giant of spectral type O7III, {{is one of the}} hottest bright stars in the sky, with a surface temperature of 37,500 K. It {{is one of the more}} massive stars, being between 26 and 32 solar masses, and is 330,000 times as luminous as our Sun.|$|E
5|$|In December 1927 Keable {{contracted}} a worsened kidney infection, became septic and delirious, and, on 22 December, died at home.

5|$|Supernova SN 1054 {{was another}} widely {{observed}} event, with Arab, Chinese, and Japanese astronomers recording the star's appearance in 1054 CE. It {{may also have}} been recorded by the Anasazi as a petroglyph. This explosion appeared in the constellation of Taurus, where it produced the Crab Nebula remnant. At its peak, the luminosity of SN 1054 may have been four times <b>as</b> <b>bright</b> as Venus, and it remained visible in daylight for 23 days and was visible in the night sky for 653 days.|$|E
5|$|The launch, which {{occurred}} in pre-dawn darkness, {{was the first}} American night launch since Apollo 17, and was watched by several thousand spectators. The unusual launching time was due to tracking requirements for the primary payload, INSAT-1B; the program would not have another night launch until STS-61-B in 1985. The crew had attempted to prepare for it by training in darkened simulators so as to keep their night vision, but in practice {{it was discovered that}} the light of the solid-fuel rocket boosters made the immediate area around the launchpad virtually <b>as</b> <b>bright</b> as a day launch.|$|E
5|$|The {{second to}} fifth {{scenes of the}} Hachisuka scroll are set in the evening of Kankō 5, 9th month, 15th day (October 16, 1008). On that day, the prime {{minister}} and baby's grandfather, Fujiwara no Michinaga, celebrates the birth. In the second text scene of the emaki, Murasaki Shikibu describes how everybody including servants, minor officials and high nobility was joyful and happy. Tables with rice balls (mochi) were placed in the garden, the full moon shone beautifully and torches made the scene <b>as</b> <b>bright</b> as in daylight. There is one illustration following this scene.|$|E

5|$|Theoretical {{models of}} the Sun's {{development}} suggest that 3.8 to 2.5 billion years ago, during the Archean eon, the Sun was only about 75% <b>as</b> <b>bright</b> as it is today. Such a weak star {{would not have been}} able to sustain liquid water on Earth's surface, and thus life should not have been able to develop. However, the geological record demonstrates that Earth has remained at a fairly constant temperature throughout its history, and that the young Earth was somewhat warmer than it is today. One theory among scientists is that the atmosphere of the young Earth contained much larger quantities of greenhouse gases (such as carbon dioxide, methane) than are present today, which trapped enough heat to compensate for the smaller amount of solar energy reaching it.|$|E
5|$|Wolf 359 has {{a stellar}} {{classification}} of M6.5, although various sources list a spectral class of M5.5, M6 or M8. An M-type star {{is known as}} a red dwarf: it is called red because the energy emission of the star reaches a peak in the red and infrared parts of the spectrum. Wolf 359 has a very low luminosity, emitting about 0.1% of the Sun's energy. If it were moved to the location of the Sun, it would appear ten times <b>as</b> <b>bright</b> as the full Moon.|$|E
5|$|IQ tests {{generally}} are reliable enough {{that most people}} ages ten and older have similar IQ scores throughout life. Still, some individuals score very differently when taking the same test at different times or when taking more than one kind of IQ test at the same age. For example, many children in the famous longitudinal Genetic Studies of Genius begun in 1921 by Lewis Terman showed declines in IQ as they grew up. Terman recruited school pupils based on referrals from teachers, and gave them his Stanford–Binet IQ test. Children with an IQ above 140 by that test {{were included in the}} study. There were 643 children in the main study group. When the students who could be contacted again (503 students) were retested at high school age, they were found to have dropped 9 IQ points on average in Stanford–Binet IQ. More than two dozen children dropped by 15 IQ points and six by 25 points or more. Yet parents of those children thought that the children were still <b>as</b> <b>bright</b> as ever, or even brighter.|$|E
50|$|Faber {{had never}} enjoyed good health. He had {{suffered}} from illness for years, developing what was eventually diagnosed <b>as</b> <b>Bright's</b> Disease, {{which was to}} prove fatal. In spite of his weak health, much work was crowded into those years. He published a number of theological works, and edited the Oratorian Lives of the Saints.|$|R
50|$|Scales {{was never}} in good health after leaving the {{governorship}} in 1888. His condition was diagnosed <b>as</b> <b>Bright's</b> disease, causing his brain to become so affected that during {{the last months of}} his life, he was only conscious for short intervals. He died in Greensboro and was buried there at the Green Hill Cemetery.|$|R
50|$|In 2009, he was {{recruited}} {{to work on}} WildCats for Wildstorm Comics, inking over Tim Seeley.

5|$|Some {{variation}} {{is seen in}} the 12 subspecies of house sparrows, which are divided into two groups, the Oriental P. d. indicus group, and the Palaearctic P. d. domesticus group. Birds of the P. d. domesticus group have grey cheeks, while P. d. indicus group birds have white cheeks, as well <b>as</b> <b>bright</b> colouration on the crown, a smaller bill, and a longer black bib. The subspecies P. d. tingitanus differs little from the nominate subspecies, except in the worn breeding plumage of the male, in which the head is speckled with black and underparts are paler. P. d. balearoibericus is slightly paler than the nominate, but darker than P. d. bibilicus. P. d. bibilicus is paler than most subspecies, but has the grey cheeks of P. d. domesticus group birds. The similar P. d. persicus is paler and smaller, and P. d. niloticus is nearly identical but smaller. Of the less widespread P. d. indicus group subspecies, P. d. hyrcanus is larger than P. d. indicus, P. d. hufufae is paler, P. d. bactrianus is larger and paler, and P. d. parkini is larger and darker with more black on the breast than any other subspecies.|$|E
5|$|The female {{may begin}} feeding by biting off the male's head (as {{they do with}} regular prey), and if mating has begun, the male's {{movements}} may become even more vigorous in its delivery of sperm. Early researchers thought that because copulatory movement is controlled by a ganglion in the abdomen, not the head, removal of the male's head was a reproductive strategy by females to enhance fertilization while obtaining sustenance. Later, this behavior {{appeared to be an}} artifact of intrusive laboratory observation. Whether the behavior is natural in the field or also the result of distractions caused by the human observer remains controversial. Mantises are highly visual organisms and notice any disturbance in the laboratory or field, such <b>as</b> <b>bright</b> lights or moving scientists. Chinese mantises that had been fed ad libitum (so that they were not hungry) actually displayed elaborate courtship behavior when left undisturbed. The male engages the female in a courtship dance, to change her interest from feeding to mating. Under such circumstances, the female has been known to respond with a defensive deimatic display by flashing the colored eyespots on the inside of her front legs.|$|E
5|$|The {{software}} also {{calculated the}} fireball's instantaneous apparent magnitude at the ground. The computation started {{and ended with}} heights of approximately 250km, long {{before and after the}} cameras of the European Fireball Network could observe it. Its apparent magnitude started at a value of +5.7 and it became brighter quite quickly. The program gave an apparent magnitude of −5.7 when it was seen by one camera and −6.3 at perigee. The fireball subsequently dimmed, with an apparent magnitude of −5.4 when it was last seen by the cameras and a final calculated value of +6.0 at a height of 257km. These values are not entirely certain, because the program worked with the simplified assumption that the luminous efficacy of the fireball did not change along the track. The starting apparent magnitude is not far from the naked eye visibility limits. For example, faint stars of the magnitude +6 can be observed only in dark rural areas approximately 150km away from large cities. This magnitude corresponds to the apparent magnitude of Uranus. At its brightest, it was several times <b>as</b> <b>bright</b> as the maximum brightness of Venus.|$|E

25|$|When {{judging the}} {{relative}} luminance (brightness) {{of different colors}} in well-lit situations, humans tend to perceive light within the green parts of the spectrum <b>as</b> <b>brighter</b> than red or blue light of equal power. The luminosity function that describes the perceived brightnesses of different wavelengths is thus roughly analogous to the spectral sensitivity of M cones.|$|R
50|$|Hugh Sanders, {{who served}} <b>as</b> <b>Bright's</b> {{assistant}} {{director for the}} West Texas choral program, subsequently succeeded him as its director; Sanders ultimately gained great acclaim as choral director at Baylor University.
