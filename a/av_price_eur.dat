30|$|Based on {{the results}} shown in Table  7, it is {{confirmed}} that the proposed method considers the amount, the location and the effective use of the line by the generators in its allocation process. For example, the generator at bus 2 uses the line 1 - 2 less, compared to the generator at bus 1, due to the power flow direction of the line  1 - 2. These properties hold for the proposed method, irrespective of the pricing method applied, that is ZCF, absolute value (AV) and classic MW-mile pricing. For example, under the proposed method, the network costs of the generators using the ZCF pricing are 475.74 $/h, 444.73 $/h and 384.53 $/h, while these values change slightly to 485.86  $/h, 399.09  $/h and 420.04  $/h, if the <b>AV</b> <b>pricing</b> is used. In case of the Z-bus method, however, the results change significantly, when different pricing schemes are used. The network costs allocated to the generators are 885.29  $/h, 574.75  $/h and 344.31  $/h, by the ZCF pricing, where these values become 668.43  $/h, 412.85  $/h and 337.77  $/h, by the <b>AV</b> <b>pricing</b> method. Discrepancies arise because significant counter-flows exist under the Z-bus method.|$|R

5|$|Prized for its {{meat and}} fins, the {{porbeagle}} {{has long been}} under heavy fishing pressure. The meat is sold fresh, frozen, or dried and salted, and ranks among the most valuable of any shark: in 1997 and 1998 it had a wholesale <b>price</b> of <b>EUR</b> 5–7/kg, four {{times that of the}} blue shark (Prionace glauca). Most of the demand comes from Europe, though the United States and Japan also import this species. The fins are shipped to East Asia for use in shark fin soup. The remainder of the shark may also be utilized, for production of leather, liver oil, and fishmeal. International trade in the porbeagle appears to be significant, but remains unquantified as shark products tend not to be reported to the species level, and many consist of a mix of various species. This shark is caught most readily on longlines, but is also susceptible to gillnets, driftnets, trawls, and handlines. It is valuable enough to be generally retained when caught as bycatch; if storage space cannot be spared it may be finned and the carcass discarded.|$|R
