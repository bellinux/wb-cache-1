5|$|A general {{principle}} concerning dental abscesses is ubi pus, ibi evacua ("{{where there is}} pus, drain it"), which applies to any case {{where there is a}} collection of pus in the tissues (such as a periodontal <b>abscess,</b> pericoronal <b>abscess,</b> or apical <b>abscess).</b> The pus within the <b>abscess</b> is under pressure, and the surrounding tissues are deformed and stretched to accommodate the swelling. This leads to a sensation of throbbing (often in time with the pulse) and constant pain. Pus may be evacuated via the tooth by drilling into the pulp chamber (an endodontic access cavity). Such a treatment is sometimes termed open drainage. Drainage can also be performed via the tooth socket, once the causative tooth is extracted. If neither of those measures succeeds, or they are impossible, incision and drainage may be required, in which a small incision is made in the soft tissues directly over the <b>abscess</b> at the most dependent point. A surgical instrument such as a pair of tweezers is gently inserted into the incision and opened, while the <b>abscess</b> is massaged to encourage the pus to drain out. Usually, the reduction in pain when the pus drains is immediate and marked as the built up pressure is relieved. If the pus drains into the mouth, there is usually a bad or offensive taste.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: It is {{difficult}} to differentiate the cause of brain <b>abscesses</b> {{with the use of}} CT and MR imaging. We did a comparative evaluation of pyogenic, tubercular, and fungal brain <b>abscesses</b> by using conventional, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and proton MR spectroscopy (PMRS) with an aim to define the unique features that may differentiate among the pyogenic, tubercular, and fungal brain <b>abscesses.</b> MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis on 110 patients with surgically proved brain <b>abscesses.</b> Imaging studies included T 2, T 1, postcontrast T 1, DWI, and PMRS. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of the wall and cavity of the <b>abscesses</b> were quantified. The morphologic, physiologic, and metabolite features of pyogenic (n 91), tubercular (n 11), and fungal (n 8) <b>abscesses</b> were compared. RESULTS: The pyogenic <b>abscesses</b> had smooth (55 / 91) and lobulated (36 / 91) walls, whereas the tubercular <b>abscesses</b> had smooth (4 / 11), lobulated (6 / 11), or crenated walls (1 / 11) with no intracavitary projections. The fungal <b>abscesses</b> showed irregular walls (lobulated 4 / 8, crenated 4 / 8) with intracav-itary projections (8 / 8).

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the distribution of CD 8 + and CD 20 + lymphocytes in chronic periapical inflammatory lesions. A total of 90 periapical inflammatory lesions (chronic <b>abscesses,</b> <b>abscessed</b> cysts, and inflammatory cysts) were evaluated. The biotin-streptavidin immunohistochemical technique was used to identify cytotoxic/suppressor T-lymphocytes (CD 8) and B-lymphocytes (CD 20). Age ranged from 10 to 67 years. Patients between 26 and 45 years old (54. 4 %), females (52. 2 %), and white patients (74. 4 %) were more frequently affected. CD 8 + cell distribution was as follows: 1) fibrous capsule: diffuse in 58. 8 % of chronic <b>abscesses</b> and absent in 64. 1 % of <b>abscessed</b> cysts and in 70. 6 % of inflammatory cysts; 2) infiltration zone: diffuse in 100 % of <b>abscessed</b> cysts and in 82. 4 % of inflammatory cysts; 3) sub-epithelial zone: absent in 53. 0 % of inflammatory cysts and diffuse in 56. 4 % of <b>abscessed</b> cysts; 4) suppurative zone: diffuse in 100 % of chronic <b>abscesses</b> and in 97. 5 % of <b>abscessed</b> cysts. CD 20 + cell distribution was as follows: 1) fibrous capsule: absent in 100 % of inflammatory cysts, in 94. 8 % of <b>abscessed</b> cysts, and in 88. 3 % of chronic abscesses; 2) infiltration zone: diffuse in 100 % of <b>abscessed</b> cysts and in 53 % of inflammatory cysts; 3) sub-epithelial zone: absent in 58. 8 % of inflammatory cysts and focal in 46. 2 % of <b>abscessed</b> cysts; 4) suppurative zone: diffuse in 100 % of <b>abscessed</b> cysts and in 100 % of chronic <b>abscesses.</b> The distribution of the lymphocytic infiltrate in the lesions was usually diffuse for both types of lymphocytes...|$|R
30|$|Fungal <b>abscesses</b> {{are mostly}} {{multifocal}} (i.e. up to 90  %), smaller than pyogenic <b>abscesses</b> (< 2  cm), {{and do not}} show rim enhancement on contrast-enhanced CT images. Due to their small size, lack of contrast enhancement and miliary pattern, fungal <b>abscesses</b> {{can be difficult to}} detect on CT images. Therefore, CT cannot reliably rule out fungal <b>abscesses,</b> as enlargement of the spleen remains the only imaging finding at times.|$|R
5|$|Pulpitis is {{classified}} as reversible when the pain is mild to moderate and lasts {{for a short time}} after a stimulus (for instance, cold or sweet); or irreversible when the pain is severe, spontaneous, and lasts a long time after a stimulus. Left untreated, pulpitis may become irreversible, then progress to pulp necrosis (death of the pulp) and apical periodontitis. Abscesses usually cause throbbing pain. The apical <b>abscess</b> usually occurs after pulp necrosis, the pericoronal <b>abscess</b> is usually associated with acute pericoronitis of a lower wisdom tooth, and periodontal abscesses usually represent a complication of chronic periodontitis (gum disease). Much less commonly, non-dental conditions can cause toothache, such as maxillary sinusitis, which can cause pain in the upper back teeth, or angina pectoris, which can cause pain in the lower teeth.|$|E

5|$|Occlusal trauma {{results from}} {{excessive}} biting forces exerted on teeth, which overloads the periodontal ligament, causing periodontal pain and a reversible increase in tooth mobility. Occlusal trauma may occur with bruxism, the parafunctional (abnormal) clenching and grinding of teeth during sleep or while awake. Over time, {{there may be}} attrition (tooth wear), which may also cause dentin hypersensitivity, and possibly formation of a periodontal <b>abscess,</b> as the occlusal trauma causes adaptive changes in the alveolar bone.|$|E

5|$|Apical {{periodontitis}} is acute {{or chronic}} inflammation around {{the apex of}} a tooth caused by an immune response to bacteria within an infected pulp. It does not occur because of pulp necrosis, meaning that a tooth that tests as if it's alive (vital) may cause apical periodontitis, and a pulp which has become non-vital due to a sterile, non-infectious processes (such as trauma) may not cause any apical periodontitis. Bacterial cytotoxins reach the region around {{the roots of the}} tooth via the apical foramina and lateral canals, causing vasodilation, sensitization of nerves, osteolysis (bone resorption) and potentially <b>abscess</b> or cyst formation.|$|E
5|$|Appropriate {{antibiotics}} {{decrease the}} average 3–5 day duration of symptoms by about one day, and also reduce contagiousness.

40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} {{computerized}} tomographic (CT) findings of hepatic fascioliasis (HF) vs. melioidosis-caused liver (ML) <b>abscesses.</b> Material and Method: CT images of 15 patients with hepatic fascioliasis (HF) and 16 patients with melioidosis-caused liver (ML) <b>abscesses</b> were retrospectively reviewed. The authors evaluated and compared HF and ML <b>abscesses</b> (by χ 2 and Fisher exact tests) vis-a-vis their location of liver involvement, size, shape, number, margins, enhancement patterns, subcapsular lesions, internal architecture, dilatation of intrahepatic bile duct and combination with splenic <b>abscesses.</b> Results: Fourteen HF patients had only liver <b>abscesses</b> and 1 had combined liver and splenic <b>abscesses.</b> Four ML patients had liver <b>abscesses</b> alone while 12 had combined liver and splenic <b>abscesses</b> (p = 0. 000). Eight of the 15 HF (53. 3 %) and 2 of the 16 ML (12. 5 %) patients had subcapsular lesions (p = 0. 019). The liver <b>abscesses</b> were round or oval with linear tracts in 8 of the 15 HF (53. 3 %) {{and none of}} the ML patients (p = 0. 001). Between the respective HF and ML patients, {{there was a significant difference}} in those with round shaped in ML (p = 0. 008), multiple and conglomerately distributed in HF (p = 0. 050), multiple and discretely distributed in ML (p = 0. 001) no (or minimal) peripheral contrast enhancement in HF (p = 0. 011) and moderate or mark peripheral enhancement in ML (p = 0. 011).

Over 3 % of the injected dose (ID) of liposomes was present in the <b>abscesses</b> 24 h after liposome administration in contrast to 0. 1 % in normal skin sections. The percentage ID present in the liver, spleen and kidneys was 17 %, 4 % and 2 % per organ respectively. Five days after liposome injection, 2 % ID could still be recovered from the <b>abscesses.</b> Using colloidal gold-labelled PEG-liposomes, it was shown that there was a 4 -fold greater density of liposome clusters in the subcutaneous tissue surrounding the capsule than in the core of the <b>abscesses.</b> The clusters within the <b>abscesses</b> were distributed evenly. We conclude that PEG-liposomes localise to a significant degree at the infection focus in our mouse model and may provide a new approach to the antimicrobial treatment of intra-abdominal <b>abscesses...</b>|$|R

5|$|From the history, {{indicators}} of pulpal, periodontal, {{a combination of}} both, or non-dental causes can be observed. Periodontal pain is frequently localized to a particular tooth, which is made much worse by biting on the tooth, sudden in onset, and associated with bleeding and pain when brushing. More than one factor {{may be involved in}} the toothache. For example, a pulpal <b>abscess</b> (which is typically severe, spontaneous and localized) can cause periapical periodontitis (which results in pain on biting). Cracked tooth syndrome may also cause a combination of symptoms. Lateral periodontitis (which is usually without any thermal sensitivity and sensitive to biting) can cause pulpitis and the tooth becomes sensitive to cold.|$|E
