30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  11, {{comparing}} with the unfiltered curves, the 50 -Hz low-pass filter <b>acceleration</b> <b>curves</b> of frame’s center are little different with bottom’s center <b>acceleration</b> <b>curves</b> {{and both the}} curves (50 -Hz low-pass filter) have obviously three peaks (due to three Maglev train marshalings). So, although the frame’s center acceleration value is much bigger than bottom’s center <b>acceleration</b> value (unfiltered <b>curves</b> and time–history), it {{is caused by the}} frame local vertical vibration and the vibration is high frequency (more than 50  Hz). The different low-frequency vibration is little caused by the overall vertical vibration (less than 50  Hz). Due to the China’s <High-Speed Railway Design Standard>, the bridge’s limited value of vertical acceleration at ballast less track is 0.5  g considering the 20 -Hz low-pass filter. The limited filter value references the European Standard. Because the vibration of frame and bottom belongs to two different frequency domains, using the filter limited value (20 -Hz low-pass filter) to filter the vertical <b>acceleration</b> <b>curves</b> based on the China’s <High-Speed Railway Design Standard> is slightly unsuitable.|$|R

The larger grinding wheel is used for rough machining to increase grinding efficiency and the smaller is used for finish machining to form the cam profile accurately. Based on the analysis of motion law of grinding carriage and headstock, the speed and <b>acceleration</b> <b>curves</b> are reconstructed by three different methods to optimize kinematic characteristics of cam non-circular grinding.

50|$|A simple rule {{of thumb}} for short {{duration}} shocks (much less than {{about a quarter of}} a cycle, which means much less than about 30 ms) is DRI = 3.96·ΔV, where ΔV is the total impulse delivered by the shock in units of meters per second. ΔV is simply the integral under the shock <b>acceleration</b> <b>curve,</b> equivalent to the “liftoff” velocity of the object undergoing shock loading. For a constant impulse, the DRI decreases as the duration of the pulse increases beyond about 30 ms.|$|E
50|$|A further {{safeguard}} is the Environmental Sensing Device (ESD). It determines through {{environmental sensors}} whether the weapon is operating under expected parameters. For example, on an ICBM, a nuclear warhead would first {{be exposed to}} a strong acceleration, and then a period of free fall. The ESD determines the external parameters such as <b>acceleration</b> <b>curve,</b> temperature and pressure and only activates the weapon when these external effects occur in the correct order and fall within specific parameters. So, should unauthorized personnel succeed in stealing a weapon, they could not activate {{it as long as}} a functional launch mechanism was not also stolen along with it. Of course, without the PAL codes they would still not succeed.|$|E

Under two conditions of point loads and moving loads, the maximum displacement along the tunnel arch bottom are {{at the end of the}} tunnel and the minimum displacement are at the middle. In these two conditions, the distributions of the displacements are agreement. The vertical acceleration of lining arch bottom has much difference with the loading frequencies changed. In point load conditions, the maximum <b>acceleration</b> <b>curve</b> of 3 Hz, 8 Hz take on inverted V shaped and the maximum <b>acceleration</b> <b>curve</b> of 5 Hz, 10 Hz, 15 Hz and 20 Hz take on a V shape; in moving loads case, the maximum <b>acceleration</b> <b>curve</b> of 5 Hz is inverted V shaped; the maximum <b>acceleration</b> <b>curve</b> of 20 Hz is V shaped; the maximum <b>acceleration</b> <b>curve</b> of 8 Hz is lower left upper right; and the maximum the <b>acceleration</b> <b>curve</b> of 10 Hz and 15 Hz are upper left lower right...|$|E

40|$|Large {{high-resolution}} displays combine high {{pixel density}} with ample physical dimensions. The {{combination of these}} factors creates a multiscale workspace where interactive targeting of on-screen objects requires both high speed for distant targets and high accuracy for small targets. Modern operating systems support implicit dynamic control-display gain adjustment (i. e., a pointer <b>acceleration</b> <b>curve)</b> that helps to maintain both speed and accuracy. However, large high-resolution displays require {{a broader range of}} control-display gains than a single <b>acceleration</b> <b>curve</b> can usably enable. Some interaction techniques attempt to solve the problem by utilizing multiple explicit modes of interaction, where different modes provide different levels of pointer precision. Here, we investigate the alternative hypothesis of using a single mode of interaction for continuous pointing that enables both (1) standard implicit granularity control via an <b>acceleration</b> <b>curve</b> and (2) explicit switching between multiple acceleration curves in an efficient and dynamic way. We evaluate a sample solution that augments standard touchpad accelerated pointer manipulation with multitouch capability, where the choice of <b>acceleration</b> <b>curve</b> dynamically changes depending on the number of fingers in contact with the touchpad. Specifically, users can dynamically switch among three different acceleration curves by using one, two, or three fingers on the touchpad...|$|E

40|$|Traumatic {{and mild}} {{traumatic}} brain injuries are incurred {{as a result}} of the complex motions of the head after an impact. These motions can be quantified in terms of linear and rotational accelerations which cause the injurious levels of brain deformation. Currently, it is unclear what aspects of the linear and rotational <b>acceleration</b> loading <b>curves</b> influence injurious brain deformation. This research uses the University College Dublin Brain Trauma Model to analyse the loading curve shapes from a series of centric and non-centric impacts to a Hybrid III headform fitted with different hockey helmets. The results found that peak resultant linear acceleration did not always correlate with brain deformation measures. The results also indicated that, due to the complex nature of the interaction between loading curve characteristic and tissue parameters, there was no commonality in curve shape which produced large magnitudes of brain deformation. However, the discriminant function did show that angular <b>acceleration</b> loading <b>curve</b> characteristics would predict brain deformation more reliably than linear <b>acceleration</b> loading <b>curves...</b>|$|R
