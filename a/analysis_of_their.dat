Archaeal cells have unique properties separating {{them from the}} other two domains of life, Bacteria and Eukaryota. The Archaea are further divided into multiple recognized phyla.

5|$|Born in Sydney, New South Wales to {{a middle-class}} family of English descent, Childe studied Classics at the University of Sydney {{before moving to}} England to study Classical {{archaeology}} at the University of Oxford. Here, he embraced the socialist movement and campaigned against the First World War, viewing it as a conflict waged by competing imperialists {{to the detriment of}} Europe's working class. Returning to Australia in 1917, he was prevented from working in academia because of his socialist activism, instead working for the Australian Labor Party as the private secretary of politician John Storey. Growing critical of Labor, he authored an <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> policies and joined the far-left Industrial Workers of the World. Emigrating to London in 1921, he became librarian of the Royal Anthropological Institute and continued his research into European prehistory through various journeys across the continent, publishing his findings in academic papers and books. In doing so he introduced the continental European concept of an archaeological culture to the British archaeological community.|$|E

5|$|Optical properties, {{including}} the PL efficiency, {{can be modified}} by encapsulating organic dyes (carotene, lycopene, etc.) inside the tubes. Efficient energy transfer occurs between the encapsulated dye and nanotube — light is efficiently absorbed by the dye and without significant loss is transferred to the SWCNT. Thus potentially, optical properties of a carbon nanotube can be controlled by encapsulating certain molecule inside it. Besides, encapsulation allows isolation and characterization of organic molecules which are unstable under ambient conditions. For example, Raman spectra are extremely difficult to measure from dyes because of their strong PL (efficiency close to 100%). However, encapsulation of dye molecules inside SWCNTs completely quenches dye PL, thus allowing measurement and <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> Raman spectra.|$|E

In the 1980s, cladistic methodology was applied to dinosaur phylogeny for the first time by Jacques Gauthier and others, showing unequivocally that birds were a derived group of theropod dinosaurs. Early analyses suggested that dromaeosaurid theropods like Deinonychus were particularly closely related to birds, a result that has been corroborated many times since.|$|E
