On 5 August 2007, Nani made his competitive debut for United, coming on as a substitute in the Community Shield against Chelsea. He marked his debut with a trophy after they won 3–0 on penalties, following a 1–1 draw during normal time.

Several days later, Yugoslav authorities returned the bodies of all but three of the fallen militants following mediation by the International Committee of the Red Cross. The militants were given heroes' funerals in a rebel-held <b>area,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> ceremony attended by thousands of ethnic Albanians, including other KLA fighters.

Near a volcano, Bond is attacked by helicopters, which he defeats, confirming his suspicions that the enemy's base is nearby. A Soviet spacecraft is then captured in orbit by another unidentified craft, heightening tensions between Russia and the United States. The mysterious spaceship lands in an extensive base hidden inside the volcano. It soon {{turns out that the}} true mastermind behind this is SPECTRE, whose mysterious leader is revealed to be Ernst Stavro Blofeld, who has been hired by the People's Republic of China to start a Soviet-American war. Blofeld summons Osato for not having killed Bond, who immediately blames his assistant, Helga Brandt. Blofeld then gives Osato a last chance, but as Brandt leaves, he activates a mechanism that drops her into a pool filled of piranhas. Brandt is forced to pay for her failure with her life by being devoured alive, and Blofeld instructs Osato to kill Bond.|$|E
5|$|After {{the defeat}} in Tampere, the Red Guards began a slow retreat eastwards. As the German army seized Helsinki, the White Army shifted the {{military}} focus to Viipuri; 18,500 Whites raided against 15,000 Red defending troopers. General Mannerheim's Vyborg plan {{was affected by}} the battle for Tampere, the civilian industrial town. He aimed to avoid a new bloody city combat, in Viipuri - the old border ground military fortress. The Jäger detachments tried to destroy and bind the Red force outside Viipuri, and conquer the lamed town <b>area</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> mild battle. The Whites were able to cut the Reds' connection to Petrograd and weaken the troops, in the fierce combats, in the Karelian Isthmus on 20–26 April, but the decisive blow remained in besieged Viipuri. The final attack to the city began on late 27 April with a heavy, concentrated Jäger artillery barrage. The Reds' tough defence in the street combat collapsed gradually and eventually the Whites conquered Patterinmäki - the symbolic Last Stand-hill of the Finnish Red 1918 Uprising - {{in the center of}} Viipuri, on early hours of 29 April 1918. In total 400 Whites and 500–600 Reds died and 12,000–15,000 were imprisoned.|$|E
5|$|An unusually severe Mediterranean {{tropical}} cyclone developed on 23September 1969 southeast of Malta, producing severe flooding. Steep pressure and temperature gradients above the Atlas mountain range were evident on 19September, {{a result of}} cool sea air attempting to penetrate inland; south of the mountains, a lee depression—a low-pressure <b>area</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> mountainous region—developed. Under the influence of mountainous terrain, the low initially meandered northeastward. Following the entry of cool sea air, however, it recurved to the southeast before transitioning into a Saharan depression associated with a distinct cold front by 22September. Along the front's path, desert air moved northward while cold air drifted in the opposite direction, and in northern Libya, warm arid air clashed with the cooler levant of the Mediterranean. The organization of the disturbance improved slightly further before emerging into the Mediterranean Sea on 23September, upon which the system experienced immediate cyclogenesis, rapidly intensifying while southeast of Malta as a cold-core cut-off low, and acquiring tropical characteristics. In western Africa, meanwhile, several disturbances converged toward Mauritania and Algeria, while the medicane recurved southwestward back toward the coast, losing its closed circulation and later dissipating.|$|E

He returned to action to score {{from the edge of}} the penalty <b>area</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 3–1 away victory against Swansea City on 30 March 2002; this goal secured Luton's promotion to the Second Division at the first attempt. Holmes' 2001–02 season was ended with 10 appearances and one goal after suffering a knee ligament injury during Luton's 4–0 victory at Hull City on 6 April 2002. He suffered a groin strain during the 2–1 home defeat to Cambridge United in the Football League Trophy on 10 December 2002. He made his return to Luton's first team in a 3–2 away defeat to Mansfield Town on 4 March 2003 after coming on as a 74th-minute substitute. He then scored in the following match against Huddersfield Town, being assisted by an Ian Hillier cross in the 71st-minute to help Luton to a 3–0 victory on 8 March 2003. He finished 2002–03 with 23 appearances and two goals, but missed Luton's final match of the season after picking up a hamstring injury during a 1–1 draw with Stockport County on 26 April 2003.|$|E
5|$|In February 1858, Ives {{returned}} to the <b>area</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> paddle steamer named Explorer. He was leading an expedition up the Colorado from the south, and he wanted Irataba to guide them. The Mohave gave permission to navigate the river, and Cairook, Irataba, and a 16-year-old Mohave boy named Nahvahroopa joined them. Möllhausen again accompanied the expedition, and {{was impressed with the}} Mohave guides, later noting Irataba's enthusiastic handshake and lamenting that their only form of communication was sign language. He also noted that Irataba and the Mohave readily began wearing European clothes given to them by members of the expedition, and showed great interest in smoking tobacco. Aside from the friendship shown to him by Irataba and Cairook, Ives noted that the Mohave appeared less friendly than on earlier occasions, a change that he attributed to their contact with Mormons, who were in conflict with the US and had succeeded in converting some Mohave.|$|E

5|$|The Great Northern and Strand Railway (GN) first {{proposed}} a {{station in the}} Strand <b>area</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> private bill presented to Parliament in November 1898. The station {{was to be the}} southern terminus of an underground railway line planned to run from Wood Green station (now Alexandra Palace) via Finsbury Park and King's Cross and was originally to be located at the corner of Stanhope Street and Holles Street, north of the Strand. When the two streets were scheduled for demolition as part of the London County Council's plans for the construction of Kingsway and Aldwych, the GN moved the location to the junction of the two new roads. Royal Assent to the bill was given and the Great Northern and Strand Railway Act 1899 was enacted on 1 August. In September 1901, the GN was taken over by the Brompton and Piccadilly Circus Railway (B), which planned to build an underground line from South Kensington to Piccadilly Circus via Knightsbridge. Both were under the control of Charles Yerkes through his Metropolitan District Electric Traction Company and, in June 1902, were transferred to Yerkes' new holding company, the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL). Neither of the railways had carried out any construction, but the UERL obtained permission for new tunnels between Piccadilly Circus and Holborn to connect the two routes. The companies were formally merged as the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (GNP) following parliamentary approval in November 1902. Prior to confirmation of the merger, the GN had sought permission to extend its line southwards from the future junction of Kingsway and Aldwych, under Norfolk Street to a new interchange under the Metropolitan District Railway's station at Temple. The extension was rejected following objections from the Duke of Norfolk under whose land {{the last part of the}} proposed tunnels would have run.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{commander}} on Bougainville, Lieutenant General Harukichi Hyakutake, initially {{believed that}} the landing at Empress Augusta Bay was a diversion, and would {{be followed by a}} direct assault on the south of the island. However, he conducted several small and unsuccessful attacks against the beachhead in early November after being ordered to do so by the Eighth Area Army using units from his 17thArmy and forces dispatched directly from Rabaul. The United States forces subsequently expanded their beachhead, and defeated the Japanese forces in the <b>area</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> series of battles in November and December. While most of the Japanese units involved in these engagements were destroyed, the total number of casualties inflicted on the 17thArmy was not crippling; the Americans captured 25 prisoners and a small amount of equipment and estimated that over 2,458 Japanese had been killed.|$|E
