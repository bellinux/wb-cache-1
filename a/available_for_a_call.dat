40|$|Interruptions are {{a central}} aspect of working life. The {{prevalence}} of remote coworkers {{and the use}} of mobile technology mean that interruptions are more prevalent, and workers have to learn to manage availability. To understand general issues in availability management, we carried out a naturalistic study of how interruptions are handled in face-to-face situations. We found that availability management requires negotiation, that it is also highly dependent on awareness about the availability of others, and that it demands cognitive effort to shift attention to the interruption. On the basis of these observations we developed a technology The Negotiator that embodies three main design requirements (a) support for negotiation (b) contextual information about when a recipient is <b>available</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>call</b> (c) lightweightness to reduce attentional overhead. We carried out an experimental study of interruption management using this technology. The interface satisfied the original design requirements: people were able to use it effectively to negotiate times to talk while successfully carrying out an intellectually demanding activity. Contrary to our expectations, however, people preferred take responsibility for returning calls rather than delegating these, and they preferred to schedule calls as soon as possible, rather than deferring these. We suggest tha...|$|E

50|$|Clos {{networks}} have three stages: the ingress stage, middle stage, and the egress stage. Each stage {{is made up}} of a number of crossbar switches (see diagram below), often just called crossbars. Each <b>call</b> entering <b>an</b> ingress crossbar switch can be routed through any of the available middle stage crossbar switches, to the relevant egress crossbar switch. A middle stage crossbar is <b>available</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> particular new <b>call</b> if both the link connecting the ingress switch to the middle stage switch, and the link connecting the middle stage switch to the egress switch, are free.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — We {{analyze the}} {{performance}} of a wireless system that allows opportunistic spectrum sharing. The system consists of a set of primary users sharing a set of channels over a coverage area. The resources allocated to the primary users are shared opportunistically with a set of secondary users. The secondary users are capable of detecting channels that are unused by the primary users and then making use of the idle channels. If no channel is <b>available</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> secondary <b>call,</b> the <b>call</b> waits in <b>a</b> buffer until either a channel becomes available or a maximum waiting time is reached. We compute the blocking probabilities, mean reconnection probability, channel utilization, and total carried traffic in the system. Our results suggest that opportunistic spectrum sharing can significantly improve the efficiency of a wireless system, without negatively impacting the performance seen by the primary users. I...|$|R

Due to a common theoretical background for such problems, generic concepts can be re-used to easier the development of algorithms. As a consequence, these problems can be implemented with only minimal effort, i. e. programmers {{do not have to}} be aware of low-level code, customized data structures and algorithms being <b>available</b> <b>for</b> free. <b>A</b> toolkit, <b>called</b> iZi, has been devised and applied to several problems such as itemset mining, constraint mining in relational databases and query rewriting in data integration systems.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of future wireless mobile multimedia networks {{is to provide}} services efficiently to the mobile users in all environments. In wireless mobile Communication the channel allocation and bandwidth sharing are the major factors and quality of service is the important issue to decide the system performance. In this work a Hybrid Channel Allocation(HCA) strategy for channel allocation and a novel bandwidth sharing technique applied to Hybrid Channel Allocation strategy for Quality of Service(QoS) provisioning are implemented. The proposed HCA strategy considers new calls in Fixed Channel Allocation (FCA) method and handoff calls in Dynamic Channel Allocation (DCA) method. In the bandwidth sharing of mobile multimedia <b>calls,</b> <b>a</b> multimedia <b>call</b> is considered as a combination of three classes namely voice of CBR, Voice with low rate video of CBR and Voice with high rate video of VBR. Priority of the above classes and a new bandwidth sharing method is implemented. When the required bandwidth is not <b>available</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> handoff (HO) <b>call,</b> it rejects <b>a</b> low Priority class and postpones bandwidth sharing to the class, that may cause delay, {{but it is not}} <b>a</b> major problem <b>for</b> the Quality of Service (QoS). Our method decreases the handoff call dropping probability (CDP) when compared with Without Control method (WCM). It also improves the communication quality of handoff calls in mobile multimedia networks...|$|R
30|$|Centralized DCA schemes {{theoretically}} provide near optimal performance. However, using {{a centralized}} approach {{to determine the}} best <b>available</b> channel <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new <b>call</b> without causing any channel interference is a combinatorial optimization problem, which is computationally intractable. Therefore, most existing centralized DCA schemes are heuristic. For instance, Lima et al. presented a genetic algorithm (GA)-based DCA method [10]; Kim et al. proposed a DCA method that is based on the GA and minimizes inter-cell interference [11]; Misra et al. developed a learning automata-based channel reservation scheme to find the optimal number of reserved channels in a system [12]; Zhao et al. proposed a DCA method that is based on a noisy chaotic neural network [13]; Krishna et al. presented a dynamic channel allocation scheme with efficient channel reservation for handoff calls [14]. In all of the above approaches, the DCA is centrally implemented in the mobile switching center (MSC) or in a cell with a central controller, which collects information about all of the cells in the CMS. The shortcomings of such centralized schemes are as follows; (i) the MSC is increasingly likely to fail owing to <b>an</b> overload of <b>call</b> requests as the size of the CMS grows with the {{growth in the number of}} mobile users [15, 16], and (ii) determining the best available channel is time consuming even when heuristic methods are used, and <b>a</b> new <b>call</b> may be blocked as a result of just one unsuccessful assignment. These drawbacks suggest that distributed DCA schemes may be better for large CMS, because they assign and reassign channels at the base station of a cell [17, 18]. Owing to the simplicity of the assignment algorithm at each base station, distributed DCA schemes are more attractive <b>for</b> implementation in <b>a</b> CMS. However, most current distributed DCA schemes impose only CCC. All current methods that deal with the CCC, ACC, and CSC simultaneously are centralized DCA schemes.|$|R
