5|$|To {{achieve an}} {{adequate}} width and height of bone, various bone grafting techniques have been developed. The {{most frequently used}} is called guided bone graft augmentation where a defect is filled with either natural (harvested or <b>autograft)</b> bone or allograft (donor bone or synthetic bone substitute), covered with a semi-permeable membrane and allowed to heal. During the healing phase, natural bone replaces the graft forming a new bony base for the implant.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the tissue}} {{used in an}} <b>autograft</b> is the patient's own, the risk of {{rejection}} is minimal.|$|E
25|$|The use {{of adult}} stem cells in {{research}} and therapy is not as controversial {{as the use of}} embryonic stem cells, because the production of {{adult stem cells}} does not require the destruction of an embryo. Additionally, in instances where adult stem cells are obtained from the intended recipient (an <b>autograft),</b> the risk of rejection is essentially non-existent. Consequently, more US government funding is being provided for adult stem cell research.|$|E
50|$|Damaged bone can be {{replaced}} with bone {{from other parts of}} the body (<b>autografts),</b> from cadavers (allograft), or with various ceramics or metallic alloys. The use of <b>autografts</b> limits how much bone is available.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} factors that help a surgeon decide {{whether he should}} choose a nerve-autograft or an allograft. The {{differences}} between <b>autografts</b> and allografts are discussed above.The use of nerve <b>autografts</b> has some disadvantages. One is that the surgeon always creates a defect on the ‘donorplace’, from where the nerve is taken.Another disadvantage {{is that when the}} defect is large, the amount of available <b>autografts</b> may be insufficient.|$|R
40|$|Cultured human {{keratinocyte}} <b>autografts</b> were transplanted to burn {{wounds that}} had been completely excised down to muscle fascia such that all cutaneous elements {{were removed from the}} wounds. Healing <b>autografts</b> were biopsied from days 6 – 153 in five patients, and the “neo-dermis” beneath the <b>autografts</b> was examined by immunofluorescent staining using antibody probes to connective tissue molecules, by histochemical staining for elastin fibers, and by electron microscopy. We found that the neo-dermis contained most of the major connective tissue elements early in the post-transplantation period. However, regardless of the time examined, there was a paucity of elastin fibers and poor organization of linkin (microthread-like fibers) in the neo-dermis beneath <b>autografts.</b> The perturbations of these connective tissue components in the neo-dermis {{may play a role in}} the poor recoil and elastic properties of burn wounds treated with <b>autografts...</b>|$|R
25|$|Variations on {{the nerve}} <b>autograft</b> include the {{allograft}} and the xenograft. In allografts, the tissue for the graft {{is taken from}} another person, the donor, and implanted in the recipient. Xenografts involve taking donor tissue from another species. Allografts and xenografts have the same disadvantages as autografts, but in addition, tissue rejection from immune responses {{must also be taken}} into account. Often immunosuppression is required with these grafts. Disease transmission also becomes a factor when introducing tissue from another person or animal. Overall, allografts and xenografts do not match the quality of outcomes seen with autografts, but they are necessary when {{there is a lack of}} autologous nerve tissue.|$|E
25|$|Currently, {{autologous}} nerve grafting, or a nerve <b>autograft,</b> {{is known}} as the gold standard for clinical treatments used to repair large lesion gaps in the peripheral nervous system. It is important that nerves are not repaired under tension, which could otherwise happen if cut ends are reapproximated across a gap. Nerve segments are taken from another part of the body (the donor site) and inserted into the lesion to provide endoneurial tubes for axonal regeneration across the gap. However, this is not a perfect treatment; often the final outcome is only limited function recovery. Also, partial deinnervation is frequently experienced at the donor site, and multiple surgeries are required to harvest the tissue and implant it.|$|E
25|$|Biomaterials can {{be derived}} either from nature or {{synthesized}} in the laboratory {{using a variety of}} chemical approaches utilizing metallic components, polymers, ceramics or composite materials. They are often used and/or adapted for a medical application, and thus comprises whole or part of a living structure or biomedical device which performs, augments, or replaces a natural function. Such functions may be relatively passive, like being used for a heart valve, or may be bioactive with a more interactive functionality such as hydroxy-apatite coated hip implants. Biomaterials are also used every day in dental applications, surgery, and drug delivery. For example, a construct with impregnated pharmaceutical products can be placed into the body, which permits the prolonged release of a drug {{over an extended period of}} time. A biomaterial may also be an <b>autograft,</b> allograft or xenograft used as a transplant material.|$|E
40|$|We {{present results}} of a phase 3 {{randomized}} trial of <b>autografting</b> in chronic lymphocytic leukemia versus observation for responding patients after first- or second-line treatment. The primary objective was to demonstrate that <b>autografting</b> improves the 5 -year event-free survival (EFS) from 30 % to 50 %. There were 223 enrolled patients, 72 % men and 28 % women, 83 % after first and 17 % after second-line treatment. Binet stages were progressive A 13 %, B 67 %, C 20 %; at randomization, 59 % were in complete remission, and 41 % in less than complete remission. Patients were randomized between <b>autografting</b> (n = 112) and observation (n = 111). Median EFS was 24. 4 months (range, 16. 7 - 32 months) in the observation group and 51. 2 months (39. 8 - 62. 5 months) in the <b>autografting</b> group; the 5 -year EFS was 24 % and 42 %, respectively (P <. 001). Accordingly, the 5 -year relapse incidence was 76 % versus 54 % (P <. 001). Median time to relapse requiring therapy or death was 40 months (25 - 56 months) in the observation arm and 65 months (59 - 71 months) after <b>autografting</b> (P =. 002). Cox modeling confirmed that <b>autografting</b> significantly improved EFS (hazard ratio 0. 44, 95 % confidence interval 0. 30 - 0. 65; P <. 001). At 5 years, the probability of OS was 85. 5 % and 84. 3 % for <b>autografting</b> and observation, respectively (P =. 77). In chronic lymphocytic leukemia, consolidating <b>autografting</b> {{reduces the risk of}} progression by more than 50 % but has no effect on overall survival. </p...|$|R

25|$|A nerve {{guidance}} conduit (also {{referred to}} as an artificial nerve conduit or artificial nerve graft, {{as opposed to an}} <b>autograft)</b> is an artificial means of guiding axonal regrowth to facilitate nerve regeneration and is one of several clinical treatments for nerve injuries. When direct suturing of the two stumps of a severed nerve cannot be accomplished without tension, the standard clinical treatment for peripheral nerve injuries is autologous nerve grafting. Due to the limited availability of donor tissue and functional recovery in autologous nerve grafting, neural tissue engineering research has focused on the development of bioartificial nerve guidance conduits as an alternative treatment, especially for large defects. Similar techniques are also being explored for nerve repair in the spinal cord but nerve regeneration in the central nervous system poses a greater challenge because its axons do not regenerate appreciably in their native environment.|$|E

40|$|Haematological {{recovery}} after autologous {{bone marrow}} transplantation (BMT) for acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is often delayed and available laboratory assays cannot accurately predict speed of engraftment. By using the long-term bone marrow culture (LTBMC) method, we attempted to define the haemopoietic defect underlying this slow engraftment, and assessed the usefulness of LTBMC in predicting engraftment. Cryopreserved bone marrow (BM) harvested from three different groups (AML <b>autografts,</b> n = 18; <b>autografts</b> for non-leukaemic diseases, n = 23; normal donors, n = 10) were cultured and their growth was compared and correlated {{with the speed of}} engraftment. In the AML <b>autografts,</b> non-adherent and adherent progenitor production was significantly reduced compared with normal BM during the whole culture period (P < 0. 01). None of the LTBMC parameters was found to correlate with engraftment after autologous BMT. The nonleukaemic <b>autografts</b> showed progenitor production intermediate between normal and AML <b>autografts.</b> Their progenitor content {{at the end of the}} culture period (reflecting the stem cell pool) was not statistically different from normal BM. In this group, most of the progenitor cell contents during LTBMC correlated with neutrophil (r(s) = - 0. 618 to - 0. 879, P < 0. 01) and platelet (r(s) = - 0. 479 to - 0. 707, P < 0. 02) recovery. The conclusion drawn from these results is that AML <b>autografts</b> are defective in their ability to sustain in vitro haemopoiesis, but this in vitro defect does not correlate with the slow haemopoietic recovery after autologous BMT. In contrast, LTBMC of <b>autografts</b> for non-leukaemic diseases, whose defect affects the stem cell pool to a lesser extent than BM in AML correlates with the speed of engraftment...|$|R
40|$|Cultured Schwann {{cells in}} tendon <b>autografts</b> for nerve repair improve the early phase of nerve {{regeneration}} in rat sciatic nerves as {{judged by the}} rate of axonal outgrowth. We tested the long-term effects on functional recovery using measurements of muscle force, the number of axons and myelination, using morphometry. In addition, we recorded wet weight of the gastrocnemius muscle. Schwann cell cultures were prepared from predegenerated nerves. Ten and 15 mm defects in rat sciatic nerves were bridged using bilateral tendon <b>autografts</b> with Schwann cell-seeded tendon <b>autografts</b> on one side, and untreated tendon <b>autografts</b> on the other. Animals were evaluated at six and 12 weeks, respectively. At six weeks, myelination, as judged by G-ratio (ratio of axonal diameter to diameter of nerve fibres), was significantly increased in tendon <b>autografts</b> pretreated with Schwann cells in 10 mm defects. No such difference {{was seen in the}} 15 mmdefects. We found no difference in functional recovery, other morphometric variables, or muscle weight between the two grafts. We conclude that early effects on nerve regeneration using transplantation of cultured Schwann cells in rat sciatic nerves are temporary. Other strategies are necessary to obtain lasting effects on functional recovery...|$|R
2500|$|Autografts are the {{transplant}} of tissue {{to the same}} person. Sometimes this is done with surplus tissue, tissue that can regenerate, or tissues more desperately needed elsewhere (examples include skin grafts, vein extraction for CABG, etc.). Sometimes an <b>autograft</b> is done to remove the tissue and then treat it or the person before returning it (examples include stem cell <b>autograft</b> and storing blood in advance of surgery). [...] In a rotationplasty, a distal joint is used to replace a more proximal one; typically a foot or ankle joint is used to replace a knee joint. [...] The person's foot is severed and reversed, the knee removed, and the tibia joined with the femur.|$|E

40|$|The {{difference}} in {{the timing of the}} regeneration process of skeletal muscle between SJL/J and BALB/c mice was investigated using grafts of whole skeletal muscle (both <b>autografts</b> and allografts). Histological, autoradiographic and immunohistochemical techniques were used in the investigation. Infiltration of leucocytes into <b>autografts,</b> numbers of desmin-positive myogenic cells and myotube formation were all more advanced in the SJL/J compared with BALB/c mice. Furthermore, autoradiographic evidence showed that myoblasts in the SJL/J <b>autografts</b> were synthesising DNA 12 h earlier than myoblasts in BALB/c <b>autografts.</b> In allografts, where SJL/J host mice received BALB/c grafts, and vice versa, leucocyte infiltration and myotube formation occurred earlier in the BALB/c muscles grafted into SJL/J hosts, than in the reverse situation with BALB/c hosts. The results show that, at least for whole muscle grafts, it is the host environment which determines the speed and outcome of the regenerative process...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: We studied 22 dogs {{to examine}} the effect of basic {{fibroblast}} growth factor (bFGF) alone, in comparison with omental or muscular wrapping on airway healing in a tracheal autotransplantation model. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Basic fibroblast growth factor {{is one of the most}} potent promoters of angiogenesis and has an ability to enhance blood supply to the ischemic airway. Topical administration of a fibrin glue enriched with 5 microg/cm 2 bFGF, determined as a proportion of surface area of the tracheal grafts, improved revascularization of orthotopic canine tracheal <b>autografts</b> in a previous study. METHODS: All animals received orthotopic tracheal transplantation using 6 -ring <b>autografts</b> that occupied a distal part of the thoracic trachea. Twenty-two animals were classified randomly into the following four groups: no treatment (Group G 1, n = 4), muscular wrapping (Group G 2, n = 4), omental wrapping (Group G 3, n = 4), and topical administration of fibrin glue enriched with 5 microg/cm 2 bFGF (Group G 4, n = 10). <b>Autografts</b> were harvested 60 days after transplantation and assessed by the percent patency and histology. RESULTS: Devascularized tracheal <b>autografts</b> could not maintain their structural integrity without other treatments (Group G 1). In contrast, more than half of all <b>autografts</b> receiving treatments remained viable, as demonstrated by gross and histologic findings (Groups G 2, G 3, and G 4). Treatments with bFGF and omentum showed significantly better graft viability than no treatment. However, there was no statistical difference in the viability of tracheal <b>autografts</b> among the three treatment groups. In terms of the time performance ratio, bFGF was the best treatment for the devascularized <b>autografts.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Topical administration of bFGF was superior to the omental or muscular wrapping in terms of the time performance ratio. Clinical trials will be necessary to determine whether these findings are applicable to humans...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyzed}} {{data from}} 263 patients with {{acute myelocytic leukemia}} (AML) <b>autografted</b> in first remission (CR) {{during the period from}} January, 1982 to January, 1987 at one of 34 centers in the European Bone Marrow Transplant Group. The median age of patients was 30 years (range, 1 to 65). The median interval between achieving CR and <b>autografting</b> was 5 months (range, 1 to 23). Of the 263 patients, 131 patients received cytoreductive regimens that included total body irradiation (TBI); the remainder received various combinations of cytotoxic drugs. Sixtynine patients received autologous marrow purged in vitro with mafosfamide, and 194 received unpurged marrow. The median follow-up was 28 months (range, 12 to 97). For patients with standard risk AML in CR 1 <b>autografted</b> after TBI (n = 107), the leukemia-free survival (LFS) was higher. and the probability of relapse was lower in recipients of purged than of unpurged marrow (63 % versus 34 %, P =. 05 and 23 % versus 55 %. relative risk 0. 34, P =. 005. respectively). The superior results of purging were most obvious in patients <b>autografted</b> within 6 months of achieving CR (probability of relapse, 20 % versus 61 %, P =. 01). Patients with longer intervals between CR and <b>autografting</b> had higher LFS and lower probability of relapse than those <b>autografted</b> early in CR (intervals greater than 9 months, 7 to 9 months, 4 to 7 months, and ≤ 3 months: LFS = 56 %, 40 %, 35 %, 27 %, P =. 007, probability of relapse = 25 %, 56 %, 59 %, 67 %, P =. 005; respectively).

Bare sclera technique was used to treat 21 primary pterygia;mitomycin C was used to treat 20 (16 primary, 4 recurrent) pterygia; 18 (17 primary, 1 recurrent) pterygia were treated by conjuntival flap reconstruction;and 18 (9 primary, 9 recurrent) pterygia were treated by conjunctival <b>autografting</b> technique. All patients who underwent surgery were followed up for between 6 months and 2 years. Results: Eight recurrences (38. 09 %) were observed in the bare sclera group whereas there were 5 (25 %) recurrences in the mitomycin C group. In the conjunctival flap reconstruction group, 6 (33. 33 %) recurrences were detected. In the conjunctival <b>autografting</b> group, 3 recurrences were observed.
