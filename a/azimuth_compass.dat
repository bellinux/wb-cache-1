5000|$|Quite commonly, <b>azimuths</b> or <b>compass</b> {{bearings}} are {{stated in}} {{a system in which}} either north or south can be the zero, and the angle may be measured clockwise or anticlockwise from the zero.

The reference direction, stated first, is always north or south, and the turning direction, stated last, is east or west. The directions are chosen so that the angle, stated between them, is positive, between zero and 90 degrees.

50|$|An <b>azimuth</b> <b>compass</b> is a {{magnetic}} compass where the circumference of the card is divided into 360 degrees.It has two sights, diametrically opposite each other, through which the sun, planet or star is viewed. The sun is typically observed when the sun's center is about one solar diameter above the horizon.Typically the compass will have a stop {{in the side of}} the box, which the observer pushes when the sun is lined up in the sights. This fixes the compass card, from which the magnetic azimuth or amplitude can be read.|$|E

50|$|An <b>azimuth</b> <b>compass</b> (or {{azimuthal}} compass) is a nautical {{instrument used}} to measure the magnetic azimuth, the angle of the arc on the horizon between the direction of the sun or some other celestial object and the magnetic north. This can be compared to the true azimuth obtained by astronomical observation to determine the magnetic declination, the amount by which the reading of a ship's compass must be adjusted to obtain an accurate reading. Azimuth compasses were important in the period before development of the reliable chronometers needed to determine a vessel's exact position from astronomical observations.|$|E
50|$|Cook {{commanded}} HMS Resolution on this voyage, while Tobias Furneaux commanded its companion ship, HMS Adventure. Resolution {{began her}} career as the 462 ton North Sea collier Marquis of Granby, launched at Whitby in 1770, purchased by the Royal Navy in 1771 for £4,151, and converted to naval specifications for a cost of £6,565. She was 111 ft long and 35 ft abeam. She was originally registered as HMS Drake, but fearing this would upset the Spanish, she was renamed Resolution, on 25 December 1771. She was fitted out at Deptford with the most advanced navigational aids of the day, including an <b>azimuth</b> <b>compass</b> made by Henry Gregory, ice anchors and the latest apparatus for distilling fresh water from sea water. Twelve light 6-pounder guns and twelve swivel guns were carried. At his own expense Cook had brass door-hinges installed in the great cabin.|$|E
50|$|For example, an FM {{radio station}} which advertises {{that it has}} 100,000 watts of power {{actually}} has 100,000 watts ERP, and not an actual 100,000-watt transmitter. The transmitter power output (TPO) of such a station typically may be 10,000 to 20,000 watts, with a gain factor of 5 to 10 (5× to 10×, or 7 to 10 dB). In most antenna designs, gain is realized primarily by concentrating power toward the horizontal plane and suppressing it at upward and downward angles, {{through the use of}} phased arrays of antenna elements. The distribution of power versus elevation angle is known as the vertical pattern. When an antenna is also directional horizontally, gain and ERP will vary with <b>azimuth</b> (<b>compass</b> direction). Rather than the average power over all directions, it is the apparent power {{in the direction of the}} antenna's main lobe that is quoted as a station's ERP (this statement is just another way of stating the definition of ERP). This is particularly applicable to the huge ERPs reported for shortwave broadcasting stations, which use very narrow beam widths to get their signals across continents and oceans.|$|E

She was fitted out at Deptford with the most advanced navigational aids of the day, including an <b>azimuth</b> <b>compass</b> made by Henry Gregory, ice anchors, and the latest apparatus for distilling fresh water from sea water. Her armament consisted of 12 6-pounder guns and 12 swivel guns. At his own expense Cook had brass door-hinges installed in the great cabin. It was originally planned that the naturalist Joseph Banks and an appropriate entourage would sail with Cook, so a heightened waist, an additional upper deck and a raised poop deck were built to suit Banks.

However, in sea trials the ship {{was found to be}} top-heavy, and under Admiralty instructions the offending structures were removed in a second refit at Sheerness, at a further cost of £882.3.0d.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} by which homing pigeons navigate from an unfamiliar place is now relatively well understood. Pigeons determine their location with respect to home using a ‘map’, thought {{to be based on}} olfactory cues (Papi, 1991), or other cues of unknown origin (Wiltschko, 1996) and are then able to take up the correct home direction by referring to a sun <b>azimuth</b> <b>compass.</b> This is widely known as the map-and-compass mechanism of true navigation (Kramer, 1953). Because the sun <b>azimuth</b> <b>compass</b> is time-compensated, homing pigeons can be ‘clock-shifted’. If their day/night cycle is artificially shifted, when they are released from an unfamiliar site they misread the sun compass and fly in the wrong direction (Schmidt-Koening, 1958, 1960, 1961). The degree to which the bird flies in the wrong direction is predictable, and for a 6 h shift this varies from 70 ° to 140 ° depending on the time of day and year...|$|E
