5|$|The {{status of}} the period 7 {{congener}} of the noble gases, oganesson (Og), is not known—it {{may or may not}} be <b>a</b> <b>noble</b> gas. It was originally predicted to be <b>a</b> <b>noble</b> gas but may instead be a fairly reactive solid with an anomalously low first ionisation potential, due to relativistic effects. On the other hand, if relativistic effects peak in period 7 at element 112, copernicium (as is thought to be the case), oganesson may turn out to be <b>a</b> <b>noble</b> gas after all, albeit more reactive than either xenon or radon. Regardless, oganesson is predicted to be a nonmetal, and probably the only one in period 7.|$|E
5|$|Helium {{is almost}} always placed above neon (which is in the p-block) in the {{periodic}} table as <b>a</b> <b>noble</b> gas, although it is occasionally placed above beryllium due to their similar electron configuration.|$|E

Proposition 1st.--Gothic or Romanesque {{construction}} is nobler than Greek construction.[20] That is to say, building an arch, vault, or dome, is <b>a</b> <b>nobler</b> and more ingenious work than laying a flat stone or beam over {{the space to}} be covered. It is, for instance, <b>a</b> <b>nobler</b> and more ingenious thing to build an arched bridge over a stream, than to lay two pine-trunks across from bank to bank; and, in like manner, it is <b>a</b> <b>nobler</b> and more ingenious thing to build an arch over a window, door, or room, than to lay a single flat stone over the same space.|$|R

5|$|Capacitive discharge: {{this is a}} nonthermal plasma {{generated}} by the application of RF power (e.g., 13.56MHz) to one powered electrode, with a grounded electrode held at a small separation distance {{on the order of}} 1cm. Such discharges are commonly stabilized using <b>a</b> <b>noble</b> gas such as helium or argon.|$|E
5|$|Due to its location, the Church of St Peter {{is often}} {{described}} as a cemetery church. However, scholar Bistra Nikolova considers it improbable that an ordinary village cemetery church would have an inscription by a Bulgarian tsar. In her opinion, {{it is more likely that}} the church was constructed by <b>a</b> <b>noble</b> person related to the court of the Second Bulgarian Empire.|$|E
5|$|Edmund {{cannot be}} placed within any ruling dynasty. Numismatic {{evidence}} suggests he succeeded Æthelweard. According to the historian Susan Ridyard, Abbo of Fleury's statement that Edmund was 'ex antiquorum Saxonum nobili prosapia oriundus' {{can be taken}} to mean that he was descended from <b>a</b> <b>noble</b> and ancient race.|$|E

5|$|Emilia Plater {{was born}} in Vilnius into <b>a</b> <b>noble</b> Polish–Lithuanian Plater family. Her family, of the Plater coat of arms, traced its roots to Westphalia, but was {{thoroughly}} Polonized. Much of the family relocated to Livonia during the 15th century and later to Lithuania, of which Vilnius is the capital. She is described as either Polish, Polish-Lithuanian or Lithuanian.|$|E
5|$|Franklin {{opposed the}} {{creation}} of the Society because he viewed it, with its hereditary membership, as <b>a</b> <b>noble</b> order unwelcome in the newly independent Republic, contrary to the ideals of Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus, for whom the Society was named; his reference to the two kinds of birds is interpreted as a satirical comparison between the Society of the Cincinnati and Cincinnatus.|$|E
5|$|In 1797 he {{was listed}} among the staff {{officers}} and aide-de-camp of the Cisalpine Army, probably as aide-de-camp of General Giuseppe Lahoz Ortiz. In 1799, in Mantua he {{passed in the}} Austrian service, taking on garrison duties in Passau until, in 1803, the city {{was given to the}} Kingdom of Bavaria. In 1804, in Wien, he married Wilhelmina Franziska von Koskull, daughter of <b>a</b> <b>noble</b> Curlandian family.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the compounds where <b>a</b> <b>noble</b> gas atom {{is involved in a}} covalent bond, noble gases also form non-covalent compounds. The clathrates, first described in 1949, consist of <b>a</b> <b>noble</b> gas atom trapped within cavities of crystal lattices of certain organic and inorganic substances. The essential condition for their formation is that the guest (noble gas) atoms must be of appropriate size to fit in the cavities of the host crystal lattice. For instance, argon, krypton, and xenon form clathrates with hydroquinone, but helium and neon do not because they are too small or insufficiently polarizable to be retained. Neon, argon, krypton, and xenon also form clathrate hydrates, where the noble gas is trapped in ice.|$|E
5|$|In the 13th century, a new fiscal {{system was}} {{introduced}} and the hundreds were gradually included into larger administrative units called len, with a castle {{serving as the}} administrative center. This new administrative development {{was a result of}} the increased power of the aristocracy. In each len, <b>a</b> <b>noble</b> man was put in charge, with the title lensmand.|$|E
5|$|Romualdo Braschi-Onesti, cardinal-nephew of Pius VI (1775–1799), was the {{penultimate}} cardinal-nephew. Despite Pius VI's lineage to <b>a</b> <b>noble</b> Cesena family, {{his only}} sister {{had married a}} man from the poor Onesti family. Therefore, he commissioned a genealogist to discover (and inflate) some trace of nobility in the Onesti lineage, an endeavor which yielded only a circuitous connection to Saint Romualdo.|$|E

5|$|The later {{counts of}} Anjou, {{including}} the Plantagenets, descended from Geoffrey II, Count of Gâtinais, {{and his wife}} Ermengarde of Anjou. In 1060 the couple inherited the title via cognatic kinship from an Angevin family that was descended from <b>a</b> <b>noble</b> named Ingelger, whose recorded history dates from 870.|$|E
5|$|A Literary Polish {{language}} breakthrough {{came under}} the influence of the Reformation with the writings of Mikołaj Rej. In his Brief Discourse, a satire published in 1543, he defends a serf from a priest and <b>a</b> <b>noble,</b> but in his later works he often celebrates the joys of the peaceful but privileged life of a country gentleman. Rej, whose legacy is his unbashful promotion of the Polish language, left a great variety of literary pieces. Łukasz Górnicki, an author and translator, perfected the Polish prose of the period. His contemporary and friend Jan Kochanowski became one of the greatest Polish poets of all time.|$|E
5|$|A {{few years}} later, in 1835 his native {{province}} of Rio Grande do Sul was engulfed in a secessionist rebellion, the Ragamuffin War. The conflict lasted for almost ten years, and the Count was leading military engagements {{for most of}} that time. He played a decisive role in saving the provincial capital from the Ragamuffin rebels, allowing forces loyal to the legitimate government to secure a key foothold. In 1852, he led a Brazilian division during the Platine War in an invasion of the Argentine Confederation that overthrew its dictator. He was awarded <b>a</b> <b>noble</b> title, eventually raised from baron to viscount and finally to count.|$|E

5|$|A {{native of}} Chiprovtsi {{and one of}} Bulgaria's most educated people of the 17th century, Parchevich was among {{the leaders of the}} Bulgarian Roman Catholics. His {{numerous}} diplomatic visits to the royal courts of Europe were mostly in an attempt to garner support for an anti-Ottoman uprising in Bulgaria, which he did not live to witness. Nevertheless, his efforts in defending Christianity earned him <b>a</b> <b>noble</b> title from the Austrian emperors, and he took up several important positions within the Roman Catholic ecclesiastical hierarchy.|$|E
5|$|According to Eusebius of Caesarea, Pamphilus of Caesarea {{was born}} into a rich family in Beirut {{in the latter half of}} the 3rd century and {{attended}} its law school. Pamphilus later became the presbyter of Caesarea Maritima and the founder of its extensive Christian library. He is celebrated as a martyr by both the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church. Eusebius also tells of martyred brothers Aphian and Aedesius, born to <b>a</b> <b>noble</b> Lycian family. They converted to Christianity while studying law in Beirut and were persecuted and executed for their beliefs.|$|E
5|$|Argon is a {{chemical}} element with symbolAr and atomic number18. It is in group 18 of {{the periodic table}} and is <b>a</b> <b>noble</b> gas. Argon is the third-most abundant gas in the Earth's atmosphere, at 0.934% (9340 ppmv). It {{is more than twice}} as abundant as water vapor (which averages about 4000 ppmv, but varies greatly), 23 times as abundant as carbon dioxide (400 ppmv), and more than 500 times as abundant as neon (18 ppmv). Argon is the most abundant noble gas in Earth's crust, comprising 0.00015% of the crust.|$|E
