40|$|Studies with an wnnUinn {{formulation}} of ICI 35 868 (2, 6 -diisopropylphenol) {{indicate that this}} new formulation has <b>anaesthetic</b> <b>properties</b> in rats and mice, and haemodynamic effects in the mini-pig which are «jmil«r {{to those of the}} previously available Cremophor formulation. Administration of the emulsion formulation to dogs produced no untoward effect, whereas the Cremophor formulation produced a mwrVf< 1 increase in plasma histamine concentration. In the mini-pig, no adverse response was produced by the repeated administration of the wniilmrm {{formulation of}} ICI 35 868, whereas the Cremophor formulation produced anaphylactoid responses when a second injection was given 1 week after an uneventful first exposure to this formulation. Behavioural responses in the rat suggest that the emulsion formulation may produce less discomfort on i. v. injection. The compound, 2, 6 -diisopropylphenol (ICI 35 868) emerged from a series of alkylphenols which were found to have <b>anaesthetic</b> <b>properties</b> in animals (James and Glen, 1980). Initial investigations of the pharmacological properties of ICI 35 868 were un-dertaken using a formulation containing the surfac-tant Cremophor EL (Glen, 1980). Using this formu-lation, the <b>anaesthetic</b> <b>properties</b> of ICI 35 868 were demonstrated in patients (Kay and Roily, 1977; Rogers et al., 1980) and further clinical work has confirmed very largely the pharmacological profile predicted from the animal studies. One unexpected feature noted in these early studies, and subsequent-ly (Briggs et al., 1981; Major et al., 1981), was a signifirant frequency of pain on injection. In an attempt to decrease the frequency of this side-effect, and because of circumstantial evidence of an associa-tion between Cremophor-containing agents and anaphylactoid reactions in patients (Clarke et al., 1975; Dye and Watkins, 1980; Huttel, Schou Ole-son and Stoffersen, 1980), an emulsion formulation of ICI 35868 has been developed.

Few, however, have been subjected to clinical trial and even fewer have achieved lasting success in clinical practice. Some of the reasons for this state of affairs are that compounds possessing a high systemic toxicity, or causing a local irritation at the site of injection, or which following continued use can be associated with the development of allergy, are immediately rejected.

40|$|<b>Anaesthetic</b> <b>properties</b> of a {{range of}} {{chemical}} compounds were tested on mature commercial scallops (Pecten fumatus) as a means of reducing stress and subsequent unplanned spawning caused by routine handling and assessment of breeding condition. Of 14 compounds tested, only chloral hydrate, magnesium chloride and magnesium sulphate successfully induced anaesthesia within 1 h. Magnesium sulphate induced high post-anaesthesia mortality and was not investigated further. Doses of 4 g chloral hydrate/ 1 (0. 024 M) or 30 g magnesium chloride/ 1 (0. 31 M) were selected as most suitable on the basis of time to, and recovery from, anaesthesia. Neither anaesthetic caused mortality nor increased spawning activity and magnesium chloride actually reduced the incidence of unplanned spawning. With the use of chloral hydrate, time to anaesthesia was found to decrease significantly with increasing water temperature in the range 12 - 24 °C, but to be independent of temperature in the case of magnesium chloride. © 1995...|$|R
40|$|ArticleThe {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] (Diprivan; Stuart) a new, very short-acting intravenous anaesthetic agent, was tested in its aqueous emulsion formulation.

Both heart rate and diastolic blood pressure were more stable in the propofol group, and recovery times were significantly shorter. Patients were remarkably clear-headed after propofol. When the quality of anaesthesia was independently assessed by an anaesthesist and a surgeon, propofol was rated good or satisfactory in all subjects, and thiopentone in 80 %. Anaphylactoid reactions associated with the previous Cremophor EL formulation were not encountered, and pain on injection was experienced in 10 % of propofol subjects as against 5 % who received thiopentone.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{barbiturates}} on the GABA·receptor complex and the A_ 1 adenosine receptor were studied. At the GABA-receptor complex the barbiturates inhibited the binding of [^ 35 S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate [^ 35 S]TBPT) and enhanced the binding of [^ 3 H]diazepam. Kinetic and saturation experiments showed that both effects were allosteric. Whereas all barbiturates caused complete inhibition of [^ 35 S]TBPT binding, they showed {{varying degrees of}} maximal enhancement of [^ 3 H]diazepam binding; (±) methohexital was idenafied as the most efficacious compound for this enhancement.

The comparison of the effects on [^ 3 H]diazepam and [^ 3 H]PIA binding showed that excitatory barbiturates interact preferentially with the A_ 1 adenosine receptor, and sedative/anaesthetic barbiturates with the GABA-receptor complex.

40|$|Research {{into local}} {{anaesthetic}} mechanisms {{over the past}} few years has focused on two main issues. First, attention has focused on development of compounds with fewer side effects, better sensory/motor separation and longer duration of action; this has resulted in the introduction of ropivacaine and levobupivacaine into clinical practice. These agents have a lesser cardiotoxic effect than older compounds, and ropivacaine may in addition offer better sensory/motor separation. Several other compounds, including tonicaine and sameridine, are under investigation. In addition, the local <b>anaesthetic</b> <b>properties</b> of amitryptiline are being studied, and liposome encapsulation of local anaesthetics appears able to confer new pharmacokinetic properties on common drugs. Second, the molecular basis for several local anaesthetic actions that are not mediated by sodium channels has become a topic of interest. The mechanisms that underlie anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic actions are at present being unravelled.

Its <b>anaesthetic</b> <b>properties</b> were noted early in 1847 by Marie-Jean-Pierre Flourens (1794–1867). The use of chloroform in anesthesia is linked to James Young Simpson, who, in a wide-ranging study of organic compounds, found chloroform's efficacy on 4 November 1847. Its use spread quickly and gained royal approval in 1853 when John Snow gave it to Queen Victoria during the birth of Prince Leopold. Unfortunately, though free of ether's flammability and consequent explosion hazard, chloroform is not as safe pharmacologically, especially when administered by an untrained practitioner (medical students, nurses, and occasionally members of the public were often pressed into giving anesthetics at this time). This led to many deaths from the use of chloroform that (with hindsight) might have been preventable. The first fatality directly attributed to chloroform anesthesia was recorded on 28 January 1848 after the death of Hannah Greener.|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} the <b>anaesthetic</b> <b>properties</b> and tolerance of articaine versus lidocaine at equal vasoconstrictor concentration. Study Design: A total of 96 {{male and female}} patients who underwent surgical treatment of the lower third molar participated. Patients {{were randomly assigned to}} articaine hydrochloride with epinephrine 1 : 100, 000 and lidocaine hydrochloride with epinephrine 1 : 100, 000. The variables analysed were latency period, duration of anaesthetic effect, tolerance and adverse reactions. Results: Both the latency period and the duration of anaesthetic effect were greater for articaine, although the differences were not statistically significant. Latency: mean difference of 2. 70 ± 2. 12 minutes (95 %CI of - 1. 51 minutes - 6. 92 minutes). Duration: mean difference of - 33 minutes 5 seconds ± 31 minutes (95 % CI - 1 hour 35 minutes - 29 minutes). There were 4 adverse events that did not require the patients to be withdrawn from the study.
