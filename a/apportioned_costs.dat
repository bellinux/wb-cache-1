40|$|OBJECTIVE. This study {{examines}} changes in hospitals' cost allocation patterns between inpatient and outpatient departments {{in response to}} the implementation of the prospective payment system. DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SETTINGS. The analysis was carried out using data for 3, 961 hospitals obtained from the Medicare Cost Reports and from the American Hospital Association for the years 1984 through 1988. STUDY DESIGN. A total operating cost function was estimated on the two outputs of discharges and outpatient visits. The estimation results were instrumental in disaggregating costs into inpatient and outpatient components. This was done cross-sectionally for each of the five years. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS. Comparison of this cost breakdown with that of hospital revenue provides evidence of distinct patterns in which nonteaching, rural, and small hospitals increasingly allocated greater costs to outpatient departments than did large, urban, and teaching hospitals. CONCLUSIONS. The results suggest that small rural hospitals turned to the outpatient side in the face of tough economic challenges over the period of study. Because differences in cost allocation patterns occur by particular hospital category, analyses that rely on accounting cost or revenue data in order to identify cost differences among those same categories may come to erroneous conclusions. In particular, because teaching hospitals <b>apportion</b> <b>costs</b> more heavily on the inpatient side, cost allocation differences cause upward bias in the PPS medical education adjustment...|$|R

Their purpose is to show how these methods work in actual use, and the executive report serves as practical introduction to cooperative game theory. The authors have investigated an actual water cost allocation case in the Skane region of southern Sweden. The 18 municipalities of the area were combined into six groups. Costs of a water development project there were first allocated by two naive methods [...] proportional to population and proportional to use. Then five techniques of cost allocation derived from cooperative game theory were tried [...] separable costs/remaining benefits, Shapley value, nucleolus, weak nucleolus, and proportional nucleolus. The rationale behind each of these methods is explained, and {{the superiority of the}} proportional nucleolus in this particular case is demonstrated. The authors note that as a practical matter, however, there are cases when a single numerical criterion such as <b>apportioning</b> <b>costs</b> by population or by use may be preferable to the more complicated game-theory methods.

40|$|Some {{results are}} {{presented}} from a study to determine the costs and performance of the antiparasite elements of the malaria disease control programme in Thailand. Issues examined in the paper are the concept of cost-effectiveness and its relevance in evaluating health care processes, procedures for measuring the performance of malaria surveillance and monitoring processes and procedures for measuring costs. Some data on the costs {{and the performance of}} operational services and control activities in two malaria zones are presented and the paper closes by considering how health economics research can be stimulated and supported in developing countries. It is argued that the cost-effectiveness of malaria surveillance and monitoring processes (and probably many other health care processes) can not be measured retrospectively. In the case of malaria control the effectiveness of each operational services can not be compared because services provided are interactive and complementary rather than alternatives. In addition the targets set and levels of effectiveness achieved may not be the same for these complementary processes. Procedures developed for measuring the performance and costs of malaria operational services and activities are described. Five types of measurement are used to evaluate the performance of the operational services and activities; effectiveness (%); time (days); performance (%); and efficiency (cost/unit). Actual expenditure on malaria operational services and activities is not known since all expenditure of government departments in Thailand is recorded under nine budget headings. Budget expenditure at division, region and zone levels must therefore be apportioned to assess the costs of operational services and activities. Since a variety of criteria may legitimately be used to <b>apportion</b> <b>costs</b> at each level, a network technique was developed which allows examination of the effect of all possible combinations of criteria. By this means the maximum, minimum and most appropriate costs are determined. Examples of the costs and performance of surveillance operational services and activities in two zones are presented. Data illustrates the outcomes from the procedures developed and indicates how malaria disease control managers might interpret and use the information obtained. The paper closes with some observations on how health economics research in developing countries could be better stimulated and supported through staff development programmes and through supervised 'on the job' training. ...|$|R

40|$|Digital {{printing}} technologies {{introduced in}} 1994 opened new possibilities for printing high quality low quantity four color documents. Documents could be manufactured faster {{and at a}} more affordable cost than ever before. Along {{with the introduction of}} digital presses such as the Xeikon DCP- 1 and Indigo E-Print 1000 came the expectation that this new printing technology would grow at a highly accelerated rate. To the disappointment of many companies that invested in this technology, growth has been much slower than anticipated. Lack of market growth is attributed to an uninformed client base, one unable to understand how this technology can service its needs. When clients require only 50 to 1000 copies of a document, the issue of profitability exists. Digital presses are certainly more efficient with run lengths that are shorter since there are no films or plates. They require minimal make ready such as mounting plates and running the press until optimal inking of the substrate. Unlike conventional printing workflow, proofs are generated on the digital press when required. The inefficiencies in digital printing reside in the prepress function since the workflow is the same as traditional prepress {{with the exception of the}} proofing process. This is due to the high <b>apportioned</b> <b>cost</b> of prepress in relation to the short run length when compared to traditional printing. The purpose of this paper was to develop and show how an operational model predicts the profitability of prepress operations when digital printing with a Xeikon engine. Experience indicates that digital printing can be worthwhile despite the cost of prepress. The initial model assumed that all documents introduced into the work flow were press ready. Due to the variety of difficulties encountered in prepress production, a more accurate model could only be created after recording and analyzing relevant prepress data. The revised model provided better insight into prepress efficiency and profitability of digital printing using a Xeikon engine with some interesting results. Prepress operations including printing is responsible for about 25 % of the selling cost well under the typical 40 % goal set by industry standard. Since the average impressions run was over 550, additional time required to insure jobs submitted are press ready that even doubled the prepress time has little impact on the final cost of a job. This is due to the efficiency of the tools used to prepare jobs. The average length of time to prepare a job is 20 minutes, therefore, the use of 40 minutes would typically add less than seven dollars to the manufacturing cost of production. When prepress requires corrections the cost of prepress increases by less than half a percent, therefore, prepress is efficient since the cost of typical additional labor do not dramatically effect profitability...|$|R

40|$|Roof {{greening}} {{in cities}} provides {{a range of}} environmental, economic, and social benefits. However, the lack of motivation among property owners in high-rise buildings poses an intractable obstacle to its wide implementation in compact cities. Cooperation amongst stakeholders, from individual-building to city-block scales, could facilitate adoption of green roofing, with implications for urban sustainability. This study {{is an attempt to}} evaluate the net gain from roof greening in terms of <b>apportioned</b> collective <b>costs</b> and benefits to a group of property owners. With government tax exemption to encourage green-roof installation, a fair allocation scheme, based on the Shapley value, is adopted to distribute the net gain in a partnership structure. A case study in Hong Kong serves to illustrate the application of the method to allocate theoretically the sharable gain of roof greening translated into monetary terms. The results verify the importance of individual owners in different coalition configurations in moulding the benefit profile. The crux of the financial incentive scheme is the enhanced rewards to optimized cooperation, and the pump-priming triggering of cooperation and action. The benefits of green roofs could be maximized by their widespread and contiguous, rather than piecemeal, installation. Green roofs could reduce both capital and recurrent public expenditures in stormwater management, healthcare, and green-space provision, the savings from which would be more than enough to fund the tax-exemption scheme. The findings yield convincing justifications for government financial incentives to promote public - private partnerships and cooperative coalitions of stakeholders in roof greening in compact urban areas. © 2011 Pion Ltd and its Licensors. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

We applied those costs {{to the number of}} asthma cases and exacerbations caused by regional pollution in 2007 and to hypothetical scenarios of a 20 % reduction in regional pollution in combination with a 20 % reduction or increase in the proportion of the total population living within 75 m of a major roadway.; Cost of air pollution-related asthma in Los Angeles County in 2007 was $ 441 million for O 3 and $ 202 million for NO 2 in 2010 dollars. Cost of routine care (care in absence of exacerbation) accounted for 18 % of the combined NRP and O 3 cost and 39 % of the combined NRP and NO 2 cost; these costs were not recognized in previous analyses. NRP-attributable asthma accounted for 43 % (O 3) to 51 % (NO 2) of the total annual cost of exacerbations and routine care associated with pollution. Hypothetical scenarios showed that costs from increased NRP exposure might offset savings from reduced regional pollution.; Our model disaggregates the costs of regional pollution and NRP exposure and illustrates how they might vary under alternative exposure scenarios. The cost of air pollution is a substantial burden on families and an economic loss for society...|$|R
