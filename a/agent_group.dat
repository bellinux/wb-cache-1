500|$|When the Norwegian Campaign {{ended and}} the German {{occupation}} of Norway was a reality, Tronstad became involved in resistance work, largely based around the Norwegian Institute of Technology. He {{was associated with the}} radio <b>agent</b> <b>group</b> Skylark B, which had regular contact with London from January 1941. Among other things, he sent reports on the interest shown by German authorities in the heavy water plant at Vemork. One source of this information was Tronstad's old companion, Jomar Brun, still in charge of the plant, who also helped people to flee the country by sea, via the Møre coast. After exposure of the group in September 1941, Tronstad himself had to flee the country. Another resistance member, who had already been jailed, managed to warn Tronstad, who [...] travelled from Trondheim to Oslo by train. The following day, the Gestapo visited his house to arrest him. After a few days in hiding, Tronstad was driven by car to Østfold, and then travelled on foot to Töcksfors via Ørje. From there he continued by plane to England, rejecting an offer of a civilian job in Sweden.|$|E
500|$|To provide weather {{reports and}} damage {{assessments}} from Kaafjord, agents {{on the ground}} were needed, but the last radio group in the area had exfiltrated in May 1944. The first attempt at re-establishing a presence near Tirpitz occurred in August 1944, when a Norwegian Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) agent was despatched to the nearby village of Alta. The agent infiltrated with a radio transmitter codenamed [...] "Sinding" [...] from neutral Sweden, but only managed to begin transmissions to the United Kingdom on 22 September, {{too late for the}} preparation stage for the operation. In a second attempt at establishing an <b>agent</b> <b>group</b> in the area, the Norwegian SIS agents Knut Moe and Anton Arild were dropped by parachute into the wilderness between Kaafjord and Alta on 8 September by an American Operation Carpetbagger Liberator. During the drop the agents became separated from most of their equipment, {{with the exception of the}} radio transmitter. Without weapons and equipment, the agents were forced to relocate to the village of Bossekop, where Moe's mother lived. The radio transmitter operated by the SIS team, codenamed [...] "Aslaug", was operational by 13 September, sending weather reports to the United Kingdom every other hour. As well as reporting on the weather, Moe and Arild radioed assessments of the damage Tirpitz had suffered in the air attacks prior to Operation Paravane. Local contacts helped the agents in spying on Tirpitz before and after the 15 September attack. By the time of the attack, Moe and Arild had established an observation post overlooking Tirpitzs anchorage in Kaafjord.|$|E

40|$|Security is {{becoming}} a major concern in multiagent systems, since an agent's incorrect or inappropriate behaviour may cause non-desired effects, such as money and data loss. Some multiagent platforms (MAP) are now providing baseline security features, such as authentication, authorization, integrity and confidentiality. However, they fail to support other features related to the sociability skills of agents such as <b>agent</b> <b>groups.</b> What is more, none of the listed MAPs provide a mechanism for preserving {{the privacy of the}} users (regarding their identities) that run their agents on such MAPs. In this paper, we present the security infrastructure (SI) of the Magentix MAP, which supports <b>agent</b> <b>groups</b> and preserves user identity privacy. The SI is based on identities that are assigned to all the different entities found in Magentix (users, <b>agents</b> and <b>agent</b> <b>groups).</b> We also provide an evaluation of the SI describing an example application built on top of Magentix and a performance evaluation of it.

40|$|Purpose To {{determine}} {{the safety of}} continued administration of antithrombotic agents during transperineal (TP) prostate biopsy. Patients and Methods A total of 811 men who underwent transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) -guided TP biopsy from January 2008 to June 2012 at our two institutions were retrospectively analyzed. Among these 811 men, 672 received no antithrombotic <b>agents</b> (<b>group</b> I), 103 received and continued administration of antithrombotic <b>agents</b> (<b>group</b> II), and 36 interrupted administration of antithrombotic <b>agents</b> (<b>group</b> III). Overall complications were graded and hemorrhagic complications were compared (group I with group II) using propensity score matching (PSM) analysis. Results An overall complication rate of 4. 6 % was recorded. Hemorrhagic complications occurred in 1. 8 % and they were virtually identical in all the three groups, and no severe hemorrhagic complications occurred. One patient in group III required intensive care unit admission for cerebral infarction. PSM analysis revealed no statistical difference between groups I and II {{with regard to the}} incidence of gross hematuria, perineal hematoma, and rectal bleeding. Multiple regression analysis revealed that hemorrhagic complications were associated with lower body mass index (< 21 kg/m 2, P= 0. 0058), but not with administration of antithrombotic agents. Conclusions Continued administration of antithrombotic agents does not increase the risk of hemorrhagic complications; these agents are well tolerated during TP biopsy...|$|R

5000|$|Other agents {{recruited}} by residencies are gradually organised into agent {{groups of three}} to five men each. Usually, agents working in one particular field of espionage are put together in one group. Sometimes a group consists of agents who for various reasons are known to each other.

The <b>agent</b> <b>group</b> is in contact with the undercover residency for a period of time, then gradually the system of contact with the residency comes to an end and orders begin to be received directly from Moscow.

Sherlock interrupts and surprises John {{to let him know}} that he is not dead; however, this backfires as Watson is angry with Sherlock. Morstan likes Sherlock and agrees to talk to Watson, whom she marries, but in the following episode, she shoots Sherlock non-fatally and it is revealed she was an assassin in the past with the initials A.G.R.A.. Sherlock admits that he had deduced some degree of her secret due to her past only extending back a few years, and muses that Watson would have only married a woman who appealed to his subconscious 'need' for danger. She and Watson are reconciled and they are expecting a daughter as of the last episode of the series. In a subsequent special, Mary is shown to be less guarded about her past, using her skills from her former profession to assist Sherlock and vex Mycroft. Her past is expanded upon in the first episode of the fourth season, The Six Thatchers. Mary was once part of an international secret <b>agent</b> <b>group,</b> called A.G.R.A., an acronym of the names of the members: Alex, Gabriel, Rosamund (Mary's real name) and Ajay. During a rescue mission in the British Embassy in Tbilisi, A.G.R.A. is betrayed by Vivian Norbury, secretary to Lady Elizabeth Smallwood, resulting in the deaths of half the team, the ones surviving being Mary and Ajay. Ajay, having been tipped off by his captors, attempted to kill Mary on the belief that she betrayed the team. Ajay is killed in the confrontation.

The objective {{of this study was to}} develop a method for retrospective reconstruction of the occupational exposure to internal radiation from uranium and associated chemical exposures. METHODS: A plant- and period-specific job exposure matrix (JEM) was designed. Job <b>groups</b> and exposure <b>agents</b> <b>groups</b> including uranium compounds and other chemical agents known as being carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic were defined by an expert committee. Exposure was evaluated by active and retired workers included in the evaluator committee. A quantitative assignment of quantity and frequency of handling (both coded from 0 to 3) was performed for each <b>agent</b> <b>groups</b> using a method derived from the Delphi technique. RESULTS: In all, 23 experts and 353 evaluators participated to the JEM elaboration. A final JEM involved 232 "job-periods" presenting throughout the plant period 1960 - 2006 and 22 exposure <b>agents</b> <b>groups</b> in use at the plant. Six of them involved uranium compounds classified by their blood-transferability and toxicity characteristics. A first validation of the JEM by experts in radiological protection and industrial hygiene showed an acceptable internal consistency.
