5|$|As {{part of the}} {{original}} proposal of <b>a</b> <b>belt</b> route through Salt Lake City, the southeastern quadrant received the designation of I-415. To maintain continuity in the belt route, the 415 number was replaced in favor of the I-215 designation covering the entire route in 1969.|$|E

Standing 1.9m (6ft), the figure wears a V-shaped jacket, a V-shaped tunic fastened in place with <b>a</b> <b>belt,</b> loose-fitting and many-folded trousers held by garters, and a diadem or band over his coiffed, bobbed hair.

5|$|With the {{discovery}} {{during the latter}} half of the 20th century of more objects within the Solar System and large objects around other stars, disputes arose over what should constitute a planet. There were particular disagreements over whether an object should be considered a planet if it was part of a distinct population such as <b>a</b> <b>belt,</b> or if it was large enough to generate energy by the thermonuclear fusion of deuterium.|$|E
5|$|At its fullest extent (but {{excluding}} the scattered disc), including its outlying regions, the Kuiper belt stretches from roughly 30 to 55 AU. The {{main body of}} the belt is generally accepted to extend from the 2:3 mean-motion resonance (see below) at 39.5 AU to the 1:2 resonance at roughly 48 AU. The Kuiper belt is quite thick, with the main concentration extending as much as ten degrees outside the ecliptic plane and a more diffuse distribution of objects extending several times farther. Overall it more resembles a torus or doughnut than <b>a</b> <b>belt.</b> Its mean position is inclined to the ecliptic by 1.86 degrees.|$|E
5|$|Debra's origins {{were from}} an area of {{convection}} over the western Bahamas and Florida related to an upper-tropospheric cold-core low and a tropical wave on July15. Whilst {{under the influence of}} a subtropical ridge–or <b>a</b> <b>belt</b> of high pressure–it slowly meandered southwestward and arrived into the Gulf of Mexico on July20. A weak surface circulation was observed near 1900EST (0100UTC on July21) which was affected by an inverted trough as they turned westward. The system's circulation remained indistinct until July23 as winds of 22–30knots consorted with squalls adjacent to the coasts of Louisiana and Texas.|$|E

5|$|He {{was dressed}} in a strange way. A šajkača was pulled to the front of his head and almost {{completely}} covered his forehead. His eyebrows were hardly visible. Under its weight, the ears seemed to have collapsed. He wore a kind of long, black coat, covered in mud and held in place by a string. He used another piece of string for <b>a</b> <b>belt,</b> and from it hung a pot for boiling water, a tea strainer, a canteen, and other useful things. He walked slightly bent forward, followed everywhere by the noise of the things clashing at his waist.|$|E
5|$|Her {{green eyes}} {{were meant to}} symbolize nature and also served as another {{contrast}} to Tifa's brown eyes. Nomura did not change much of Aerith's design for Advent Children, but her design was updated in Kingdom Hearts with the removal of her bolero jacket, which made her attire appear more as Amano had originally drawn her. Other changes included the addition of bracelets and <b>a</b> <b>belt.</b> Nomura modified her dress in Before Crisis, adding white and green colors, and this version was also {{used as the basis}} for her design in Kingdom Hearts II.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, in a {{paper in}} Astrophysics: A Topical Symposium, Gerard Kuiper speculated on a similar disc having formed early in the Solar System's evolution, {{but he did not}} think that such <b>a</b> <b>belt</b> still existed today. Kuiper was {{operating}} on the assumption, common in his time, that Pluto was the size of Earth and had therefore scattered these bodies out toward the Oort cloud or out of the Solar System. Were Kuiper's hypothesis correct, there would not be a Kuiper belt today.|$|E

5000|$|An earasaid, or arasaid is a draped garment worn in Scotland {{as part of}} {{traditional}} female highland dress. It is <b>a</b> <b>belted</b> plaid (literally, <b>a</b> <b>belted</b> blanket). Unlike belted plaids for men, it is worn at ankle length. Traditionally, it might be plain, striped [...] or tartan; it might be brightly-coloured or made of lachdan (dun or undyed) wool. Modern highland dress makes earasaids from the same heraldic tartan cloth used for kilts.|$|R

Pursuing him is the hunt organizer Emil Fouchon (Lance Henriksen), his lieutenant Pik Van Cleef (Arnold Vosloo), a businessman named Mr. Lopaki who has paid $500,000 for the opportunity to hunt a human, and mercenaries including Stephan (Sven-Ole Thorsen) and Peterson (Jules Sylvester).

The arch is flanked with blind roundels above the impost line, with rustication below. The bay's tympanum is undecorated. The arch impost line continues as <b>a</b> <b>belt</b> course between the pavilions and forms the sills for recessed wood-framed, fixed-sashed, nine-light windows on the building's second level. The windows are divided by Doric pilasters.|$|E

5|$|The {{immediate}} Allied {{objective was}} Verrières Ridge, <b>a</b> <b>belt</b> of high ground which dominates the route from Caen to Falaise. The ridge was invested by battle-hardened German veterans, {{who had fallen}} back from Caen and entrenched to form a strong defensive position. Over the course of six days, substantial Canadian and British forces made repeated attempts to capture the ridge. Strict German adherence to defensive doctrine, as well as strong and effective counterattacks by Panzer formations, resulted in heavy Allied casualties for little strategic gain.|$|E
5|$|The land walls {{run through}} the heart of modern Istanbul, with <b>a</b> <b>belt</b> of parkland {{flanking}} their course. They are pierced at intervals by modern roads leading westwards out of the city. Many sections were restored during the 1980s, with financial support from UNESCO, but the restoration program has been criticized for destroying historical evidence, focusing on superficial restoration, the use of inappropriate materials and poor quality of work. This became apparent in the 1999 earthquakes, when the restored sections collapsed while the original structure underneath remained intact. The threat posed by urban pollution, and the lack of a comprehensive restoration effort, prompted the World Monuments Fund to include them on its 2008 Watch List of the 100 Most Endangered Sites in the world.|$|E
5|$|The {{littoral}} zone of Soconusco lies {{to the south}} of the Sierra Madre de Chiapas, and consists of a narrow coastal plain and the foothills of the Sierra Madre.

The major pre-Columbian population centres of the highlands were located in the largest highland valleys, such as the Valley of Guatemala and the Quetzaltenango Valley. In the southern highlands, <b>a</b> <b>belt</b> of volcanic cones runs parallel to the Pacific coast. The highlands extend northwards into Verapaz, and gradually descend to the east.|$|E
