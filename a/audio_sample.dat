500|$|The {{usage of}} an <b>audio</b> <b>sample</b> from Space Shuttle Challenger {{disaster}} {{at the beginning}} of the song was criticized by the families of the lost crew, NASA, and some media. Beyoncé released a statement saying that the song was intended to help people who have lost loved people in their lives and that the sample was included as a tribute to the Challenger crew.

John Simon, who was credited with production assistance on the song, created the bassline by playing a Moog synthesizer with help from Robert Moog himself. James Bennighof, author of The Words and Music of Paul Simon, finds that [...] "textural elements are variously supported by a churning groove, percussive, and distorted electronic sounds" [...] that complement the song's subject matter, suicide suburban youth. [...] "Overs" [...] explores a more jazz-oriented style, with a larger selection of chords and looser form than the group's previous styles.|$|E

500|$|After {{writing the}} line, Pierson {{worried that the}} phrase was too complex for the warden. To explain its origin, he created a backstory that was {{included}} in the stage directions. Pierson explained that in order to advance in the Florida prison system, officers had to take criminology and penology courses at the state university, showing how the warden might know such words. Strother Martin later clarified that he felt the line was the kind that his character would very likely have heard or read from some [...] "pointy-headed intellectuals" [...] who had begun to infiltrate his character's world under the general rubric of a new, enlightened approach to incarceration. Some authors believe that the quotation was a metaphor for the ongoing Vietnam War conflict which was taking place during the filming, and others have applied it towards corporations and even teenagers. The quotation was listed at number 11 on the American Film Institute's list of the 100 most memorable movie lines. An <b>audio</b> <b>sample</b> of the line is included in the Guns N' Roses songs [...] "Civil War" [...] and [...] "Madagascar." ...|$|E
500|$|Reyes {{said that}} the album was written solely for [...] "fun {{and the love of}} music, no expectations." [...] Their lyrics were {{inspired}} by personal experience. Nolan and Lazzara had a concept where some of the lyrics could be read [...] "like a play where one line is the boy and the next line is the girl ... Sometimes when you read the lyrics it's a little boring and it's more interesting this way". About half their song titles, according to Nolan, came from [...] "sitting around late at night watching TV". The title of [...] "Cute Without the 'E' (Cut from the Team)" [...] came when a friend of the band said that someone he knew was [...] "cut from the team". [...] "Great Romances of the 20th Century" [...] includes an <b>audio</b> <b>sample</b> from the film, Beautiful Girls (1996). Lazzara said [...] "The Blue Channel" [...] and [...] "Head Club" [...] were songs that the band used [...] "to get enough songs to fill a record so we could go on tour". The album's sound would later be described as emo. Around this time, Taking Back Sunday was influenced by emo bands the Get Up Kids and the Promise Ring.|$|E
500|$|The {{marketing}} campaign for Indestructible began in late 2007, with {{a strategy of}} releasing content for fans early and often. Promotion began with distributing stickers at live events. Reprise Records also partnered with Hot Topic retailers, who thereafter put an Indestructible album teaser on all Disturbed merchandise, and eventually began selling a limited edition 7" [...] vinyl record with two songs from the album on it. In March 2008, Disturbed performed a concert in Kuwait for United States military stationed there. The concert was streamed live on MySpace, and {{more than three million}} people viewed it. In February 2008, an <b>audio</b> <b>sample</b> was posted on Disturbed's MySpace profile to promote Indestructible. The sample, titled [...] "Perfect Insanity", is actually a song written early in the band's career that never previously appeared on an album, but was expected to appear on the album. The track was later made available for download, in its entirety, on Disturbed's website for promotional purposes. Another sample, titled [...] "Inside the Fire", appeared on Rock on the Range's MySpace profile in March 2008. The track was anticipated to be the first single released from the album, with a music video directed by Nathan Cox. On March 24, 2008 [...] "Inside the Fire" [...] debuted on more than sixty radio stations. It was released for digital download the next day. On May 2, 2008 the music video for [...] "Inside the Fire" [...] debuted on Disturbed's website.|$|E

500|$|Music {{writers have}} also {{characterized}} the album's contents as {{a commentary on}} hip-hop's evolution. As Princeton University professor Imani Perry writes, Illmatic “embodies the entire story of hip-hop, bearing all of its features and gifts. Nas has the raw lyrics of old schoolers, the expert deejaying and artful lyricism of the 1980s, the slice of hood life, and the mythic... The history of hip-hop up to 1994 is embodied in Illmatic.” In the song, [...] "Represent", Nas alludes to the Juice Crew's conflict with Boogie Down Productions, which arose as a dispute over the purported origins of hip hop. Princeton University professor Eddie S. Glaude Jr. claims that this [...] "situates Queensbridge and himself within the formative history of hip-hop culture." [...] The opening skit, 'The Genesis,' also contains an <b>audio</b> <b>sample</b> of the 1983 film, Wild Style, which showcased the work of early hip-hop pioneers such as Grand Master Flash, Fab Five Freddy, and the Rock Steady Crew. After the music of Wild Style is unwittingly rejected {{by one of his}} peers, Nas admonishes his friend about the importance of their musical roots. Kenny Waste suggests that embedded deep within this track [...] "is a complex and subtle exposition on the themes of Illmatic.” Similarly, Professor Adilifu Nama of California State University Northridge writes, “’he use of Wild Style...goes beyond a simple tactic to imbue Illmatic with an aura of old-school authenticity. The sonic vignette comments on the collective memory of the hip hop community and its real, remembered, and even imagined beginning, as well as the pitfalls of assimilation, the importance of history, and the passing of hip-hop's 'age of innocence'.” ...|$|E
