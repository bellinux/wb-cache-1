5|$|From about 10,000 BCE, Paleo-Indians {{and later}} Archaic-Indians lived as {{communities}} of hunter-gatherers {{in the area}} that covers the modern day southern United States. Approximately 800 CE to 1600 CE, the Mississippi River Delta was populated by tribes of the Mississippian culture, a mound-building Native <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> had developed in the late Woodland Indian period. The Tipton Phase people were a local expression of the Mississippian culture. They inhabited the region of modern-day Tipton County during the time of first contact with Europeans, at the arrival of the de Soto Expedition. By the end of the Mississippian period the land was claimed and populated by the Chickasaw tribe. The exact origins of the Chickasaw are uncertain. Several prehistoric Indian settlements were located in the vicinity of what would later become Randolph.|$|E

The refusal of the Taliban to comply resulted in the United States taking military action to achieve the president's demands, the action given the name Operation Enduring Freedom.|$|E
50|$|Historians {{have more}} {{recently}} considered archeological reconstructions and the oral {{history of the}} various Native <b>American</b> <b>peoples</b> <b>that</b> recount the expedition.

50|$|Turkey Tayac {{started using}} a new name as he {{organized}} a movement for Native <b>American</b> <b>peoples</b> <b>that</b> privileged self-ascriptive forms of identification. In one of their projects in the 1960s, the Piscataway issued identification cards to Native Americans, rather than have tribes apply to and rely on state and federal bureaucracies to issue them on their behalf.|$|R

25|$|The {{events of}} Tet in early 1968 {{as a whole}} were also {{remarkable}} in shifting public opinion regarding the war. U.S. military officials had previously reported that counter-insurgency in South Vietnam was being prosecuted successfully. While the Tet Offensive provided the U.S. and allied militaries with a great victory in that the Vietcong was finally brought into open battle and destroyed as a fighting force, the American media, including respected figures such as Walter Cronkite, interpreted such events as {{the attack on the}} American embassy in Saigon as an indicator of U.S. military weakness. The military victories on the battlefields of Tet were obscured by shocking images of violence on television screens, long casualty lists, and a new perception among the <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> the military had been untruthful to them about the success of earlier military operations, and ultimately, the ability to achieve a meaningful military solution in Vietnam.|$|E
500|$|Following Thatcher's eulogy, Mulroney {{delivered}} his, ending with: [...] "In {{the presence}} of his beloved and indispensable Nancy, his children, his family, his friends {{and all of the}} <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> he so deeply revered, I say au revoir today to a gifted leader and historic president and a gracious human being." ...|$|E
500|$|Ryan {{said that}} he was [...] "proud" [...] of the {{agreement}} because [...] "it reduces the deficit – without raising taxes". Some conservative Republicans objected to his budget proposal. Republican Raul Labrador criticized the [...] "terrible plan," [...] saying that [...] "it makes promises to the <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> are false. Today the Democrats realized they were right all along, that we would never hold the line on the sequester." [...] Other conservatives were more positive: [...] "It achieves most of the things {{we would like to see}} when we have divided government," [...] said Rep. Steve Womack (R-Ark.).|$|E

2500|$|In 2010, Gere {{stated that}} the war in Iraq wasn't {{supported}} by the <b>American</b> <b>people</b> and <b>that</b> the George W. Bush administration [...] "bullied" [...] Americans into the decision. He called George W. Bush a very [...] "poor president".|$|R
500|$|The episode's {{name is a}} play of {{the title}} of the NBC sitcom, I Dream of Jeannie. The scene in which Stewie and Brian destroy the record is nearly {{identical}} to a scene in the movie Office Space in which the characters destroy a printer, including use of the same song. Peter makes Jesus admit that he is the messiah by threatening to urinate over albums of Christian artist Amy Grant. Peter attempts to top Jesus' story about his crucifixion during a dinner conversation with a story about how he and his friends [...] "got wrecked on Southern Comfort" [...] before going to see The Chronicles of Riddick. George W. Bush explains to the <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> going to war was correct because he answers to Jesus Christ, then Peter and Jesus interrupt him to disagree with him, similar to a scene in Woody Allen's Annie Hall. Jesus is invited to the Tonight Show, hosted by Jay Leno.|$|E

25|$|Commentators such as Glenn Greenwald have praised Church for his prescient warning {{regarding}} this turning {{around by the}} NSA to monitor the <b>American</b> <b>people,</b> arguing <b>that</b> the NSA undertook such a turning {{in the years after}} the September 11 Attacks.|$|R

2500|$|The {{exercises}} of Cold War {{civil defense}} are seen by historian Guy Oakes in 1994, as having less practical use than psychological use: {{to keep the}} danger of nuclear war high on the public mind, while also attempting to assure the <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> something {{could be done to}} defend against nuclear attack. However, according to contemporary Cold War civil defense pamphlets, like Civil Defence ...|$|E
2500|$|On March 27, 1986, {{while giving}} , Kerry {{mentioned}} {{he was in}} Cambodia on a swift boat around Christmas, 1968, during the Vietnam War.

2500|$|In 2013, Sessions sent {{a letter}} to National Endowment for the Humanities enquiring why the {{foundation}} funded projects that he deemed frivolous. He also criticized the foundation for distributing books related to Islam to hundreds of U.S. libraries, saying [...] "Using taxpayer dollars to fund education program grant questions that are very indefinite or in an effort to seemingly use Federal funds on behalf of just one religion, does not on its face appear to be the appropriate means to establish confidence in the <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> NEH expenditures are wise." ...|$|E
2500|$|Among {{the first}} to criticize the Court's {{decision}} that Ledbetter's complaint was time-barred was Marcia Greenberger, president of the National Women's Law Center, that saw in the ruling a [...] "setback for women and a setback for civil rights" [...] and called Ginsburg's opinion a [...] "clarion call to the <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> this slim majority of the court is headed in the wrong direction." [...] Debra L. Ness, president of the National Partnership for Women & Families, also condemned the decision, saying, “If employers can keep the discrimination hidden {{for a period of}} time, they can continue to discriminate without being held accountable.” On the other side, the majority's findings were applauded by the US Chamber of Commerce, that called it a [...] "fair decision" [...] that [...] "eliminates a potential wind-fall against employers by employees trying to dredge up stale pay claims." ...|$|E
2500|$|Later, on December 7, 2005, Lieberman said, [...] "It is {{time for}} Democrats who {{distrust}} President Bush to acknowledge {{that he will be}} Commander-in-Chief for three more critical years, and that in matters of war we undermine Presidential credibility at our nation’s peril. It {{is time for}} Republicans in the White House and Congress who distrust Democrats to acknowledge that greater Democratic involvement and support in the war in Iraq is critical to rebuilding the support of the <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> is essential to our success in that war. It is time for Americans and we their leaders to start working together again on the war on terrorism. To encourage that new American partnership, I propose that the President and the leadership of Congress establish a bipartisan Victory in Iraq Working Group, composed of members of both parties in Congress and high ranking national security officials of the Bush Administration." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{important}} question had been which leader, Roosevelt or Dewey, should be {{chosen for the}} critical days of peacemaking and reconstruction following the war’s conclusion. A majority of the <b>American</b> <b>people</b> concluded <b>that</b> they should not change from one party, and particularly from one leader. They also felt that in view of ever-increasing domestic disagreements it was not safe {{to do so in}} “wartime”.|$|R

60|$|Suppose we loved--you and I; {{suppose we}} loosed all {{the reins of}} our love. What would happen? You {{remember}} Gorki, the Russian patriot, {{when he came to}} New York, aflame with passion for the Russian revolution. His purpose in visiting the land of liberty was to raise funds for that revolution. And because his marriage to the woman he loved was not of the essentially legal sort worshiped by the shopkeepers, and because the newspapers made a sensation of it, his whole mission was brought to failure. He was laughed and derided out of the esteem of the <b>American</b> <b>people.</b> <b>That</b> is what would happen to me. I should be slandered and laughed at. My power would be gone.|$|E
6000|$|Judge Douglas {{ought to}} {{remember}}, {{when he is}} endeavoring to force this policy upon the <b>American</b> <b>people,</b> <b>that</b> while he is put up in that way, a good many are not. He ought to remember that there was once in this country {{a man by the}} name of Thomas Jefferson, supposed to be a Democrat,--a man whose principles and policy are not very prevalent amongst Democrats to-day, it is true; but that man did not take exactly this view of the insignificance of the element of slavery which our friend judge Douglas does. In contemplation of this thing, we all know he was led to exclaim, [...] "I tremble for my country when I remember that God is just!" [...] We know how he looked upon it when he thus expressed himself. There was danger to this country,--danger of the avenging justice of God, in that little unimportant popular sovereignty question of judge Douglas. He supposed there was a question of God's eternal justice wrapped up in the enslaving of any race of men, or any man, and that those who did so braved the arm of Jehovah; that when a nation thus dared the Almighty, every friend of that nation had cause to dread his wrath. Choose ye between Jefferson and Douglas as to what is the true view of this element among us.|$|E
6000|$|What are we {{to infer}} {{concerning}} the home habits of a nation of men who so resignedly allow their bodies to be poisoned and maltreated in traveling over such an extent of territory as is covered by our railroad lines? Does it not show that foul air and improper food are too much matters of course to excite attention? As a writer in [...] "The Nation" [...] has lately remarked, it is simply and only because the American nation like to have unventilated cars, and to be fed on pie and coffee at stopping-places, that nothing better is known to our travelers; {{if there were any}} marked dislike of such a state of things {{on the part of the}} people, it would not exist. We have wealth enough, and enterprise enough, and ingenuity enough, in our American nation, to compass with wonderful rapidity any end that really seems to us desirable. An army was improvised when an army was wanted,--and an army more perfectly equipped, more bountifully fed, than so great a body of men ever was before. Hospitals, Sanitary Commissions, and Christian Commissions all arose out of the simple conviction of the <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> they must arise. If the American people were equally convinced that foul air was a poison,--that to have cold feet and hot heads was to invite an attack of illness,--that maple-sugar, popcorn, peppermint candy, pie, doughnuts, and peanuts are not diet for reasonable beings,--they would have railroad accommodations very different from those now in existence.|$|E
