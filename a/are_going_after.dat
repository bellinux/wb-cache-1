500|$|Koppelman was {{an early}} student of Aesthetic Realism, the {{philosophy}} founded in 1941 by Eli Siegel, {{which is based on}} the principle, [...] "All beauty is a making one of opposites, and the making one of opposites is what we <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>after</b> in ourselves". This principle informed Koppelman's art, teaching, and his work as an Aesthetic Realism consultant. About the importance of this principle to art and life, Koppelman stated, [...] "When Eli Siegel showed that what makes a work of art beautiful [...] the oneness of opposites [...] is the same as what every individual wants, {{it was one of the}} mightiest and kindest achievements of man's mind".|$|E
500|$|As {{part of the}} {{alternate}} reality game which accompanied the release of Year Zero, three tracks from the album were intentionally [...] "leaked" [...] prior to their official release {{at a number of}} Nine Inch Nails concerts on USB flash drives. The high-quality audio files quickly circulated the internet, and owners of websites hosting the files soon received cease and desist orders from the Recording Industry Association of America, {{despite the fact that the}} viral campaign, and the use of USB drives, was sanctioned by Nine Inch Nails' record label. The source that broke the story was quoted as saying, [...] "These fucking idiots <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>after</b> a campaign that the label signed off on." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the US Grierson had met {{pioneering}} documentary filmmaker Robert Flaherty. Grierson respected Flaherty immensely for {{his contributions}} to documentary form and his attempts to use the camera to bring alive the lives of everyday people and everyday events. [...] Less commendable in Grierson's view was Flaherty's focus on exotic and faraway cultures. ("In the profounder kind of way", wrote Grierson of Flaherty, [...] "we live and prosper each of us by denouncing the other"). In Grierson's view, the focus of film {{should be on the}} everyday drama of ordinary people. As Grierson wrote in his diaries: [...] "Beware {{the ends of the earth}} and the exotic: the drama is on your doorstep wherever the slums; are, wherever there is malnutrition, wherever there is exploitation and cruelty." [...] "'You keep your savages in the far place Bob; we <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>after</b> the savages of Birmingham,' I think I said to him pretty early on. And we did.") ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{conflicting}} {{claims about}} whether or not the image could have copyright established, Korda's children have sought to control commercial use of the image from defamation. Korda's daughter Diana Diaz pursued a 2003 lawsuit in France against a Paris-based press rights group Reporters Without Borders, for using the Che photograph in a poster campaign decrying Cuba as [...] "the world's largest jail", aimed at dissuading French tourists from vacationing in Cuba after the jailing of 29 dissident journalists. In suing the group for 1.14 million euros, Diaz's lawyer, Randy Yaloz remarked that [...] "we <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>after</b> everyone who betrays the moral rights of my client". Moral rights are a separate component of copyright law that are not recognized in the U.S., but are recognized in some other countries, notably in France where Diaz filed the lawsuit. Moral rights aim to protect the integrity of a work from defamation, distortion, slander, or offensive mutilation, even if the originator no longer owns the copyright. However, Reporters Without Borders stopped using the image before any legal judgment was rendered.|$|E
