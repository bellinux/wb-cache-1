Of the period between 1924 and 1945, Stellan Bojerud suggests one should distinguish between National Socialism, Nazism, and right-wing extremism. He argues that Nazism differs from National Socialism in its leadership cult and absence of anti-capitalism and anti-clericalism, which are more pronounced National Socialism, which lies more to the left of Nazism. In Germany, National Socialism evolved into Nazism. Right wing extremism has an equally strong explicit racism as the <b>actual</b> <b>principal</b> enemy.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an affine two-factor dynamic term {{structure}} model for pricing Treasury nominal and inflation-indexed bonds in the closed-form. The latter are formally {{referred to as}} TIPS. Two state variables that drive the dynamics of bond prices are nominal short rate and inflation. We estimate the model using 1997 - 2009 monthly prices of nominal Treasury notes and TIPS. The focus of the paper is on explicit modeling and computation of the embedded option value in TIPS that arises from the deflation protection of the <b>principal</b> <b>paid</b> at maturity. We show that deflation option value has been positive during two periods in our sample: “deflation scare” period in 2003 - 2004 and recently, in 2008 - 2009. We also show that time variation in the option value can predict future inflation rates and inflation volatility even {{in the presence of}} other popular macro variables used for inflation forecasts...|$|R

These data were then correlated with the locations of major craters in the study areas, thus subdividing the data set into blocks obviously associated with craters and those in intercrater areas. A block was arbitrarily defined to be associated with a crater when its location was within 1. 1 crater radii of the crater's center. Since this study was commissioned for the ultimate purpose of determining hazards to landing spacecraft, such a definition was deemed appropriate in defining block-related hazards associated with craters. Size distributions of smaller fragments as determined from Surveyor photography were obtained as measurements from graphical data. Basic comparisons were performed through use of cumulative frequency distributions identical to those applied to studies of crater-count data...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (D. Ed.) [...] University of Melbourne, Dept. of Education Policy and Management, 2003 Teacher {{perceptions}} of the leadership of their principal were explored in seven independent girls' schools in Melbourne, Australia. Teacher ratings of principal leadership and principal self-ratings were gathered using Bass and Avolio's Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ 5 x Revised). The ratings were compared to teacher characteristics including gender, age, years of teaching, years at the school, work locus of control, school division, and school. There were differences between teacher and principal self-ratings and notably {{more so than in}} previous research. It was found that the principals were rated as being high in three of the five transformational behaviours, idealized attributes, idealized behaviours and inspirational motivation, but lower in intellectual stimulation, individualized consideration and the transactional behaviour of contingent reward. Teachers also rated their <b>actual.</b> <b>principal</b> lower in all three outcomes (extra effort, effectiveness and satisfaction). This differed from principal self-ratings in that principals believed themselves to be high in all five transformational leadership behaviours, contingent reward and all three outcomes. There were significant differences in teacher perception of principal leadership associated with teacher characteristics of age, years of teaching, tenure at the school, school division, gender, and work locus of control. Variation in teacher work locus of control, gender and division were particularly notable, although, overall, variance in perception of principal leadership explained by teacher characteristics was low, accounting for approximately 8 % of variance on most leadership behaviours. However when school was included with teacher characteristics, up to 25 % of the variance in teacher perception of principal leadership was accounted for, suggesting that the work context principals find themselves in can have a large impact on {{perceptions of}} their leadership. Teachers were also asked to rate their ideal principal. Compared to ratings of their <b>actual</b> <b>principal,</b> teachers rated their ideal principal higher in intellectual stimulation, individualized consideration, contingent reward and all three leadership outcomes, and at similar levels for management by exception active and passive, and non-leadership. Teacher division, gender, and work locus of control were all significant in variance in perception of ideal principal leadership. Secondary teachers recorded significantly higher idealized attributes in their ideal principal than did primary teachers. Female teachers recorded significantly higher idealized attributes, inspirational motivation and the outcome of extra effort as compared with male teachers in their ideal principal. A teacher with a higher work locus of control rated their ideal principal as using more non-leadership and rated the outcomes of ideal leadership as lower than did a teacher with a low work locus of control. The complexity of responses is noteworthy, more so because this is the first instance of the MLQ being used to record perceptions of ideal leadership.

40|$|Growth of {{monetary}} assets and debts is commonly {{described by the}} formula of compound interest which for the case of continuous compounding is the exponential growth law. Its differential form is dc/dt = i c where dc/dt describes the rate {{of monetary}} growth, i the compounded interest rate and c the <b>actual</b> <b>principal.</b> Exponential growth of this type is fixed to be neither resource-limited nor self-limiting which {{is in contrast to}} real economic growth (such as the GDP) which may have exponential, but also subexponential, linear, saturation, and even decline phases. As a result assets and debts commonly outgrow their economic fundament giving rise to the financial equivalent of Malthusian catastrophes after a certain interval of time. We here introduce an alternative for exponential compounding and propose to replace dc/dt = i c by dc/dt = i c^p where the exponent p (called reaction order in chemistry) is a quantity which will be termed monetary growth order. The monetary growth order p is seen as a tuning handle which enables to adjust gross monetary growth to real economic growth. It is suggested that the central banks take a serious look to this control instrument which allows tuning in crisis situations and immediate return to the exponential norm if needed.

40|$|It is {{currently}} {{believed that the}} trabecular structure in bone {{is the result of}} a dynamic remodeling process controlled by mechanical loads. We propose a regulatory mechanism based on the hypothesis that osteocytes located within the bone sense mechanical signals and that these cells mediate osteoclasts and osteoblasts in their vicinity to adapt bone mass. A computer-simulation model based on these assumptions was used to investigate if the adaptation of bone, in the sense of Wolff's law, and remodeling phenomena, as observed in reality, can be explained by such a local control process. The model produced structures resembling actual trabecular architectures. The architecture transformed after the external loads were changed, aligning the trabeculae with the <b>actual</b> <b>principal</b> stress orientation, in accordance with Wolff's trajectorial hypothesis. As in reality, the relative apparent density of the structure depended on the magnitude of the applied stresses. Osteocyte density influenced the remodeling rate, which also is consistent with experimental findings. Furthermore, the results indicated that the domain of influence of the osteocytes affects the refinement of the structure as represented by separation and thickness of the struts. We concluded that the trabecular adaptation to mechanical load, as described by Wolff, can be explained by a relatively simple regulatory model. The model is useful for investigating the effects of physiological parameters on the development, maintenance, and adaptation of bone. [Journal Article; In English; United States...|$|R
