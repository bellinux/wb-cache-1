5|$|The Foundation's next advert {{invited the}} general public {{to vote for the}} worst artist, either by going to the {{exhibition}} and using their critical faculties or by letting their inherent prejudices come to the fore. The final advert summarised the whole campaign, <b>asked</b> <b>some</b> questions back to the people that had written to them, and explained that the winner of the K Foundation award would be announced in a TV advert during the live Turner Prize coverage on Channel 4 television.|$|E

25|$|The {{relationship}} between Marlene and Naomi Olive worsened after {{the move to}} the United States, and their arguments began to erupt into domestic violence. Over time, Marlene Olive also developed resentment toward her father for siding with her mother in disputes and suspected him of informing police about her friends' drug activities. She shoplifted, stole her parents' credit cards, used and overdosed on drugs, ran away from home, and received stolen goods from burglaries committed by a boyfriend. She talked to several friends about wanting to kill her parents and <b>asked</b> <b>some</b> of them to help, but the friends either did not take her seriously or decided not to get involved. At one point, she attempted to poison her mother herself by mixing large doses of prescription drugs into her mother's food, but the drugs made the food taste bitter, and Naomi refused to eat it.|$|E

25|$|Swanson was {{angered by}} the response, as she felt those very studios had {{produced}} questionable films themselves, and were jealous at not having the chance to produce Rain. After another threatening telegram, she decided to first appeal to the MPAA, and then the newspapers. She only heard back from Marcus Loew, who promised to appeal on her behalf, and since he owned a chain of theatres this eased some of her concerns. Figuring the silence meant the matter had been dropped, Swanson began filming on Sadie Thompson which already had $250,000 invested in it. Before casting began, the young Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. wanted to audition {{for the role of}} Handsome O'Hara. However, Swanson felt he was too young and not right for the role. Lionel Barrymore had been first picked to play Davidson but was thought to be too ill at the time, though he eventually won the role. Barrymore wore the same outfit for an entire week, aggravating Swanson. She <b>asked</b> <b>some</b> of the crew to tell him to change and wash, which he did. Aside from this, Swanson was happy with his performance. Walsh had not appeared {{in front of a camera}} in eight years, and feared he would not be able to direct and act at the same time. However, two days into filming, his fears had disappeared.|$|E
500|$|In the 1970s, Wright {{listened to}} some {{contemporary}} progressive rock bands, and particularly liked early Peter Gabriel-fronted Genesis. He later <b>asked</b> <b>some</b> {{of the musicians}} in Gabriel's solo touring band to play on Broken China. Wright enjoyed playing the organ, and considered the style he used in Pink Floyd to be unique. He played solos {{in the early part}} of Floyd's career, frequently using Egyptian scales, such as on [...] "Matilda Mother" [...] or [...] "Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun". His jazz background led to him being interested in free form music, with adherence to tempo being less important. Later, he was more interested in complementing each piece with organ, electric piano or synthesizer as a backing instrument, while still featuring occasional solos.|$|E
500|$|The {{defensive}} segment {{within the}} battle system {{was inspired by}} the Mario & Luigi series, as well as bullet hell shooters such as the Touhou Project series. When working on the battle system, Fox set out to create a mechanic that he would personally enjoy. He wanted Undertale to have a battle system as equally engaging as Super Mario RPG (1996) and [...] (2003). Fox did not want grinding to be necessary at any point in the game, instead leaving it optional to players. He also did not wish to introduce fetch quests, as they involve backtracking, which he dislikes. In terms of the game's difficulty, Fox ensured that it was easy and enjoyable. He <b>asked</b> <b>some</b> friends who are inexperienced with bullet hell shooters to test the game, and found {{that they were able to}} complete it. He felt that the game's difficulty is optimal, particularly considering the complications involved in adding another difficulty setting.|$|E

500|$|Franks {{said that}} after her stint in 2008, many people {{recognised}} her {{in the street and}} asked if she would return. Scenes showing Phil and Rainie taking the drug crack cocaine in 2010 prompted over 200 complaints from viewers who felt the scenes were inappropriate. The BBC responded by saying [...] "EastEnders in no way—and at no point—glamorises or condones the use of drugs, and furthermore we took great care to avoid any demonstration on how to prepare or take drugs. [...] We took care to signal the nature of the episode's content to viewers in advance through programme publicity and billings, and the BBC Action Line was trailed following the episode for anyone affected by the issue. In addition to this, our website includes links to organisations who can offer help and advice on this issue. [...] We worked closely with drug and alcohol charities, including Addaction and DrugScope, throughout the editorial process to ensure that we handled the storyline accurately and sensitively." [...] The Daily Mail <b>asked</b> <b>some</b> viewers about the scenes, including one who said, [...] "I was shocked at the content of the episode. The graphic detail of the drug use with Phil and his friend was terrible and in view of the time that the episode was aired, entirely inappropriate. Viewers do not need to see this kind of storyline. Please, BBC, no more of these horrid storylines." [...] Other viewers said, [...] "They look like they're having a good time. They're in danger of making it look appealing." [...] Finally, [...] "It was a bit much. I've found EastEnders distressing over the last month." [...] The Daily Record described the scenes as 'disturbing'.|$|E

Amongst them was the mayor Trendafil Toshev Kerelov and his son, Petar Trandafilov Kerelov. They had reached an {{agreement}} that if the village were disarmed, the Pomaks would leave Batak for good. But instead, the Bulgarians were caught captive – once the arms were confiscated, all of them were beheaded, burnt alive or impaled.|$|E

2500|$|Peter Bowles {{had been}} <b>asked</b> <b>some</b> years earlier to play Jerry Leadbetter, {{the husband of}} Keith's Margo, in The Good Life. Owing to prior commitments, Bowles turned down the role, but had he played Jerry, it is {{unlikely}} {{he would have been}} offered the part of Richard; as Bowles later said, [...] "there's no way I could have played Penelope Keith's screen husband in two separate sitcoms". However, in 1987 Bowles replaced Geoffrey Palmer as Keith's onscreen husband in the ITV sitcom Executive Stress.|$|E
2500|$|Dodd recalls in {{his memoirs}} that he once placed a call to Blanche at Earl's request in which Blanche [...] "spoke very kindly about Earl and said {{she knew he was}} sick and {{fighting}} for both his physical and political life. She said [...] she had <b>asked</b> <b>some</b> of their old friends in New Orleans and elsewhere to send Earl some campaign money, and she sort of apologized {{for not being able to}} help personally. Before Earl took over the phone, she thanked me for helping him and for being the only one of his old lieutenants to come to his aid." ...|$|E

If they'd had another singer they'd never have got further than Salford {{shopping}} centre." [...] Morrissey's counsel, Ian Mill QC, conceded that his client's attitude [...] "betrayed a degree of arrogance". Morrissey appealed against the verdict; Marr did not. The appeal was heard by the Court of Appeal (Civil Division) in November 1998 and dismissed. Inspired by Joyce's success, Rourke sought legal advice on his own options. No further action {{appears to have been}} taken since that time. Rourke was declared bankrupt in 1999.|$|E

2500|$|Truth, Lies, Eviction was a live show used on Day 36. [...] Big Brother {{felt that}} some housemates were lying or holding back on things about themselves, {{therefore}} flying Under the Radar. [...] On Day 35, each housemate {{went into the}} diary room and was <b>asked</b> <b>some</b> questions. [...] A lie-risk detector, said to be 90% accurate, {{was used to determine}} from the frequency of their voice {{whether or not they were}} lying. [...] They weren't informed that a lie detector was used, or what the information would be used for until during Truth, Lies, Eviction was broadcast. [...] The show also featured Michael's eviction, and the Daily Show was broadcast as part of Truth, Lies, Eviction.|$|E
2500|$|Marimekko {{was founded}} in 1951 by Viljo and Armi Ratia, after the Viljo's oil-cloth factory project failed and was {{converted}} to a garment plant. Armi <b>asked</b> <b>some</b> artist friends to apply their graphic designs to textiles. [...] To show how the fabric could be used, the company then designed and sold a line of simple dresses using their fabric. [...] When Finland's leading industrial designer Timo Sarpaneva invited the company to present a fashion show (albeit canceled at short notice) at the 1957 Triennale in Milan, this was an early recognition of fashion as an industrial art and of Marimekko's {{key role in the}} process. The garments were eventually showcased in the nearby Rinascente upscale department store by display manager Giorgio Armani.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the time}} when Bukhari saw the earlier works and {{conveyed}} them, he found them, in their presentation, combining between what would be considered sahih (correct) and hasan (good) and {{that many of them}} included daʻīf (weak) hadith. This aroused his interest in compiling hadith whose authenticity was beyond doubt. What further strengthened his resolve was something his teacher, hadith scholar Ishaq ibn Ibrahim al-Hanthalee – better known as Ishaq Ibn Rahwayh – had told him. [...] "We were with Ishaq Ibn Rahwayh who said, ‘If only you would compile a book of only authentic narrations of the Prophet.’ This suggestion remained in my heart so I began compiling the Sahih." [...] Bukhari also said, [...] "I saw the Prophet in a dream {{and it was as if}} I was standing in front of him. In my hand was a fan with which I was protecting him. I <b>asked</b> <b>some</b> dream interpreters, who said to me, ‘You will protect him from lies.’ This is what compelled me to produce the Sahih." ...|$|E

The men <b>asked</b> <b>some</b> of the German soldiers with whom they were acquainted to go to the ghetto to see what happened. These soldiers did go, but could not gain admission to the ghetto itself. From a distance, they could still see [...] "many horrible things". [...] They reported these facts to the Jews of the work detachments, who asked them to be released early from work to see to their families. At 14:00 hours this request was granted, at least for a few of the men, and they returned to the ghetto. [...] They found the streets scattered with things, which they were directed to collect and carry to the guardhouse. They also found a small bundle {{which turned out to be}} a living child, a baby aged about four weeks. A Latvian guard took the child away.
