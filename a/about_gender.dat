5|$|In {{addition}} to her acting career, Chopra is noted for her philanthropic work.

She promotes various causes such as environment, health and education, and women's rights and is particularly vocal <b>about</b> <b>gender</b> equality and feminism. Chopra's off-screen life is the subject of substantial media coverage. As a recording artist, she has released three singles. She is also the founder of the production company Purple Pebble Pictures, which released the acclaimed Marathi comedy-drama Ventilator (2016).|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the freedom offered by the genres, gay {{characters}} often remain contrived and stereotypical, and most SF stories take for granted the continuation of heteronormative institutions. Alternative sexualities have usually been approached allegorically, or by including LGBT characters {{in such a way}} as to not contradict mainstream society's assumptions <b>about</b> <b>gender</b> roles. Works that feature gay characters are more likely to be written by women writers, and to be viewed as being aimed at other women or girls; big-name male writers are less likely to explore gay themes.|$|E

5|$|Males {{are also}} {{affected}} by societal expectations, such as notions about masculinity and sexual prowess. Men from some traditional backgrounds may feel performance pressure {{that emphasizes the}} ability to have erections and sexual intercourse. Men who have strong sexual desire but who {{are not able to}} perform sexually may be at increased risk for depression, particularly when they believe strongly in traditional masculine gender norms with sexual function as core to the male identity. Men who strongly believe in these traditional roles may feel sexually inadequate, unmanly, insecure, and less satisfied with life. Since sexual dysfunction has this negative impact on self-esteem, treatment of erectile dysfunction can have a psychological benefit even though it does not help with physical sensation. SCI may necessitate reappraisal and rejection of assumptions <b>about</b> <b>gender</b> norms and sexual function in order to adjust healthily to the disability: those who are able to change the way they think <b>about</b> <b>gender</b> roles may have better life satisfaction and outcomes with rehabilitation. Counseling is helpful in this reassessment process.|$|E
5|$|Medieval England was {{a patriarchal}} {{society and the}} lives of women were heavily {{influenced}} by contemporary beliefs <b>about</b> <b>gender</b> and authority. However, the position of women varied considerably according to various factors, including their social class; whether they were unmarried, married, widowed or remarried; and in which part of the country they lived. Significant gender inequities persisted throughout the period, as women typically had more limited life-choices, access to employment and trade, and legal rights than men.|$|E

25|$|As an artist, Hermansson's works express ideas <b>about</b> <b>gender,</b> class, and sexuality.

She works mostly with ceramics, and has had exhibitions at Stockholm's NAU Gallery and Gustavsberg's arthall. Hermansson is one of six members of the feminist art collective Den nya kvinnogruppen (The New Women's Group) which was created in early 2013 in reaction to the dominance by male artists of the Swedish art scene.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of colonialism and Christianity, rigid ideals <b>about</b> <b>gender</b> perceptions were imposed on the African mind. Thereafter, the woman’s role {{has come to be}} limited to sexual and commercial labour; satisfying the sexual needs of men, working in the fields, carrying loads, tending babies and preparing food. The disempowering colonial ‘ideology of domesticity’ as espoused by the practice of ‘housewification’ provided the springboard for women’s educational imbalance in parts of Africa. As such, the overall human development in Nigeria is being hindered by this unevenness in educational accessibility across gender categories.|$|E
25|$|Scientific {{claims about}} {{hardwired}} sex differences interact with people’s minds {{as they are}} communicated {{to the public in}} popular books and articles. ‘Brain facts’ have become increasingly popular and persuasive on public attitudes due to the increased fascination with neuroscience.

Haslam and colleagues found that emphasis on the biological causes of sex differences in intelligence suggests inevitability and fixedness, creating essentialist beliefs <b>about</b> <b>gender</b> that deepen social divides.|$|E

25|$|There {{are serious}} and {{controversial}} issues about {{differences in the}} situation of women with different races and ethnicities in Brazil. As a whole, black and Amerindian women enjoy considerably less quality of life than white women, with this being {{a reflection of the}} general characteristics of the social and economic gap that has separated social classes in Brazil for centuries, thus not indicating any specific problem <b>about</b> <b>gender</b> and women's rights. Black women's life expectancy in 2004 was 69.52 years, while white women could expect to live 73.80 on average. However, there is, at least apparently, no legal or institutional circumstance that generates those ethnic differences, but lower standards of life have always been related to a much larger percentage of mulatto, black and Amerindian people in Brazil, as in many other countries. In the last years, there is a tendency of soft decrease in Brazil's racial inequality.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{one reason}} some people {{preferred}} transsexual to transgender {{is that the}} medical community in the 1950s through the 1980s encouraged {{a distinction between the}} terms that would only allow the former access to medical treatment. Other self-identified transsexual people state that those who do not seek sex reassignment surgery (SRS) are fundamentally different from those who do, and that the two have different concerns, but this view is controversial, and others argue that merely having some medical procedures does not have such far-reaching consequences as to put those who have them and those who have not (e.g. because they cannot afford them) into such distinctive categories. Another reason for objecting to the term transsexual is the concern that it implies something to do with sexuality, when it is actually <b>about</b> <b>gender</b> identity. For example, Christine Jorgensen, the first person widely known to have sex reassignment surgery (in this case, male-to-female), rejected transsexual and instead identified herself in newsprint as trans-gender, on this basis.|$|E
25|$|Medieval England was {{a patriarchal}} {{society and the}} lives of women were heavily {{influenced}} by contemporary beliefs <b>about</b> <b>gender</b> and authority. However, the position of women varied according to factors including their social class; whether they were unmarried, married, widowed or remarried; and in which part of the country they lived. Significant gender inequities persisted throughout the period, as women typically had more limited life-choices, access to employment and trade, and legal rights than men. After the Norman invasion, the position of women in society changed. The rights and roles of women became more sharply defined, in part {{as a result of the}} development of the feudal system and the expansion of the English legal system; some women benefited from this, while others lost out. The rights of widows were formally laid down in law by the end of the twelfth century, clarifying the right of free women to own property, but this did not necessarily prevent women from being forcibly remarried against their wishes. The growth of governmental institutions under a succession of bishops reduced the role of queens and their households in formal government. Married or widowed noblewomen remained significant cultural and religious patrons and played an important part in political and military events, even if chroniclers were uncertain if this was appropriate behaviour. As in earlier centuries, most women worked in agriculture, but here roles became more clearly gendered, with ploughing and managing the fields defined as men's work, for example, and dairy production becoming dominated by women.|$|E
