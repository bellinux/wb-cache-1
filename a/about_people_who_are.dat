25|$|In the United States, attitudes <b>about</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> {{homosexual}} {{may vary}} {{on the basis}} of partisan identification. Republicans are far more likely than Democrats to have negative attitudes <b>about</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> gay and lesbian, according to surveys conducted by the National Election Studies from 2000 through 2004. This disparity is shown in the graph on the right, which is from a book published in 2008 by Joseph Fried. The tendency of Republicans to view gay and lesbian people negatively could be based on homophobia, religious beliefs, or conservatism with respect to the traditional family.|$|E
25|$|Biphobia is aversion toward {{bisexuality}} {{and toward}} bisexual {{people as a}} social group or as individuals. It can {{take the form of}} denial that bisexuality is a genuine sexual orientation, or of negative stereotypes <b>about</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> bisexual (such as the beliefs that they are promiscuous or dishonest). People of any sexual orientation can experience or perpetuate biphobia, and it is a source of social discrimination against bisexual people.|$|E

500|$|While Jones is {{credited}} with writing the screenplay, the shooting script was actually a collaborative effort that featured contributions from Henson, George Lucas, Laura Phillips, and Elaine May. Jones himself {{has said that the}} finished film differs greatly from his original vision. According to Jones, [...] "I didn't feel that it was very much mine. I always felt it fell between two stories, Jim wanted it to be one thing and I wanted it to be about something else." [...] Jones has said his version of the script was [...] "about the world, and <b>about</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> more interested in manipulating the world than actually baring themselves at all." [...] In Jones' original script, Jareth merely seems [...] "all powerful to begin with" [...] and is actually using the Labyrinth to [...] "keep people from getting to his heart." ...|$|E
2500|$|Valleywag was a Gawker Media blog with {{gossip and}} news about Silicon Valley personalities. It was {{initially}} launched {{under the direction}} of editor Nick Douglas in February 2006. After Douglas was fired, the blog was taken over by Owen Thomas. Thomas himself left in May 2009, to be replaced by Ryan Tate. It was the first to break some stories, such as the leaking of a Gene Simmons sex tape. However, it has been criticized for broadcasting unsubstantiated and damaging gossip <b>about</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> not in the public eye, such as a college intern who falsely called in sick to work and had it publicized across the Internet by Valleywag. [...] The blog ceased operating in February 2011, and the URL began directing to a Gawker page with a selection of technology industry-themed stories.|$|E
2500|$|In {{part because}} of public {{misunderstanding}} surrounding gothic aesthetics, people in the goth subculture sometimes suffer prejudice, discrimination, and intolerance. As {{is the case with}} members of various other subcultures and alternative lifestyles, outsiders sometimes marginalize goths, either by intention or by accident. Actress Christina Hendricks talked of being bullied as a goth in school and how difficult it was for her to deal with societal pressure: [...] "Kids can be pretty judgmental <b>about</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> different. But instead of breaking down and conforming, I stood firm. That is also probably why I was unhappy. My mother was mortified and kept telling me how horrible and ugly I looked. Strangers would walk by with a look of shock on their face, so I never felt pretty. I just always felt awkward". Prejudice moves people into circles of bonding where they share these similar experiences and are accepted. Young goths have to define themselves and learn beauty is an aspect of cultural relativism.|$|E

2500|$|Among {{international}} film critics, {{the film has}} experienced a similar re-evaluation. Every ten years since 1952, the British Film Institute's film magazine Sight & Sound has asked the world's leading film critics to compile {{a list of the}} 10 best films of all time. Not until 1982 did Vertigo enter the list, and then in 7th place. By 1992 it had advanced to 4th place, by 2002 to 2nd. Vertigo was voted in first place in Sight & Sounds 2012 poll of the greatest films of all time, both in the crime genre and in general, displacing Orson Welles' Citizen Kane from the position it had occupied since 1962. Commenting upon the 2012 results, the magazine's editor Nick James said that Vertigo was [...] "the ultimate critics' film. It is a dream-like film <b>about</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> not sure who they are but who are busy reconstructing themselves and each other to fit a kind of cinema ideal of the ideal soul-mate." [...] In recent years, critics have noted that the casting of James Stewart as a character who becomes disturbed and obsessive ultimately enhances the film's unconventionality and effectiveness as suspense, since Stewart had previously been known as an actor of warmhearted roles.|$|E

It isn't enough that a man should be very noble at heart and do grand things, or save your life every now and then, or be masterful and use his giant will to make you in love with him. I don't see why they can't let one have, now and then, the kind of husbands they get for themselves. For my part, I should like always to give my heart to a normal, sensible, well-bred, conscientious, agreeable man who could offer me a pleasant home--I wouldn't mind the suburbs; and I could work with him and work for him till I dropped--the kind of man that the real world seems to be so full of.
