2500|$|Early manual switchboards {{required}} the operator to operate listening keys and ringing keys, {{but by the}} late 1910s and 1920s, advances in switchboard technology led to features which allowed the call to be automatically answered immediately as the operator inserted the <b>answering</b> <b>cord,</b> and ringing would automatically begin {{as soon as the}} operator inserted the ringing cord into the called party’s jack. [...] The operator would be disconnected from the circuit, allowing her to handle another call, while the caller heard an audible ringback signal, so that that operator would not have to periodically report that she was continuing to ring the line.|$|E
2500|$|When {{a calling}} party lifted the receiver, the local loop current lit a signal lamp near the jack. The {{operator}} responded by inserting the rear cord (<b>answering</b> <b>cord)</b> into the subscriber's jack and switched her headset into the circuit to ask, [...] "Number, please?" [...] For a local call, the operator inserted the front cord {{of the pair}} (ringing cord) into the called party's local jack and started the ringing cycle. For a long distance call, she plugged into a trunk circuit to connect to another operator in another bank of boards or at a remote central office. In 1918, the average time to complete the connection for a long-distance call was 15 minutes.|$|E

40|$|In modern neuroscience, {{significant}} progress in developing structural scaffolds integrated with the brain {{is provided by the}} increasing use of nanomaterials. We show that a multiwalled carbon nanotube self-standing framework, consisting of a three-dimensional (3 D) mesh of interconnected, conductive, pure carbon nanotubes, can guide the formation of neural webs in vitro where the spontaneous regrowth of neurite bundles is molded into a dense random net. This morphology of the fiber regrowth shaped by the 3 D structure supports the successful reconnection of segregated spinal cord segments. We further observed in vivo the adaptability of these 3 D devices in a healthy physiological environment. Our study shows that 3 D artificial scaffolds may drive local rewiring in vitro and hold great potential for the development of future in vivo interfaces. Neural implants in past decades have offered themselves as a promising tool in finding <b>answers</b> for spinal <b>cord</b> injury and yet no practical treatment is available. Glial barrier and functional deficits are major challenges needed to overcome. Here, we have used a unique scaffold fabricated from 3 D multiwalled carbon nanotube fibers (CNF) as a neural implant. We investigated long term in vivo effects of this material implanted in L 1 hemisection lesione. Functional locomotor recovery measured by BBB rating scale and ladder rung test demonstrated improvement starting from 24 h post-injury over a course of 8 weeks. Footprint analysis revealed early onset of plantar placement in CNF-implanted animals. Tissue reaction to the implant quantified as GFAP and Iba 1 -positive area was limited and invasion of neural processes within the implanted scaffold suggests use of carbon nanofibers as a safe and neuron-friendly scaffold...|$|R
