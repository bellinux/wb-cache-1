500|$|Most {{vaccines}} {{are given}} in three doses over a course of months. A protective response to the vaccine is defined as an anti-HBs antibody concentration of [...] at least 10mIU/ml in the recipient's serum.

This drops to around 90% at 40years of age [...] and to around 75 percent in those over 60years. The protection afforded by vaccination is long lasting even after antibody levels fall below 10mIU/ml.
