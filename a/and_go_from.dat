5|$|The brigade {{remained}} in Germany {{in support of}} V Corps for almost 25 years, seeing no deployments. It underwent a shuffling of units as several of its battalions were reassigned elsewhere {{following the end of}} the Cold War in 1990, and it gained new battalions from units deactivating elsewhere. Though three of the brigade's subordinate battalions deployed to support Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm, the brigade headquarters itself {{remained in}} Germany {{along with the rest of}} V Corps. The operations were conducted by VII Corps and XVIII Airborne Corps, which had significant engineer assets of their own. Throughout the early 1990s, the brigade would continue to see units come <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>from</b> its command as they were transferred from the restructuring 18th Engineer Brigade and the deactivating 7th Engineer Brigade.|$|E
5|$|A host treated his {{retainers}} {{very well}} and showered them with luxury gifts {{if he wanted to}} boast his wealth and status. One retainer even received a sword scabbard decorated with jade and pearls, while others were given items like shoes decorated with pearls. However, not all retainers shared the same status, as those showered with gifts often provided highly skilled work or greater services; retainers who were not as skilled were given lesser gifts and seated in less honorable positions when meeting the host. Regardless of status, any retainer was allowed to come <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>from</b> his host's residence as he or she pleased, unlike a slave who was the property of his master and permanently attached to the estate. There was no official government policy {{on how to deal with}} retainers, but when they broke laws they were arrested, and when their master broke the law, sometimes the retainers were detained alongside him.|$|E
5|$|The farmer, or {{specifically}} the small landowner-cultivator, was ranked just below scholars and {{officials in the}} social hierarchy. Other agricultural cultivators were of a lower status, such as tenants, wage laborers, and in rare cases slaves. Artisans and craftsmen had a legal and socioeconomic status between that of owner-cultivator farmers and common merchants. State-registered merchants, who were forced by law to wear white-colored clothes and pay high commercial taxes, were considered by the gentry as social parasites with a contemptible status. These were often petty shopkeepers of urban marketplaces; merchants such as industrialists and itinerant traders working between a network of cities could avoid registering as merchants and were often wealthier and {{more powerful than the}} vast majority of government officials. Wealthy landowners, such as nobles and officials, often provided lodging for retainers who provided valuable work or duties, sometimes including fighting bandits or riding into battle. Unlike slaves, retainers could come <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>from</b> their master's home as they pleased. Medical physicians, pig breeders, and butchers had a fairly high social status, while occultist diviners, runners, and messengers had low status.|$|E

25|$|Twenty20 match {{format is}} a form of limited overs cricket in that it {{involves}} two teams, each with a single innings, the key feature being that each team bats for a maximum of 20 overs. In terms of visual format, the batting team members do not arrive from and depart to traditional dressing rooms, but come <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>from</b> a bench (typically a row of chairs) visible in the playing arena, analogous to association football's technical area or a baseball dugout.|$|E

[...] The lantern is a bit less than seven meters tall and, “…is equal to the height of the dome it surmounts,”. The lantern metaphorically expresses the themes of death and resurrection. The lantern is where the soul could escape <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>from</b> “…death to the afterlife.”.|$|E

2500|$|In a Baraita, the Sages {{interpreted}} {{the words of}} [...] "they shall run to and fro to seek {{the word of the}} Lord, and shall not find it," [...] to mean that a woman would someday take a loaf of terumah bread <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>from</b> synagogue to academy to find out whether it was clean or unclean, but none would understand the law well enough to say. But Rabbi Simeon ben Yohai answered, Heaven forbid that the Torah could ever be forgotten in Israel, for [...] says, [...] "for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed." [...] Rather, the Gemara taught, one could interpret [...] "they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the Lord, and shall not find it," [...] to mean that they would not find a clear statement of the law or a clear Mishnah on point in any place.|$|E
2500|$|The {{settlement}} of Stirling had {{a population of}} 48,440, in 2012. The City is reputed to be the third fastest growing area of Scotland in terms of population. According to the 2001 census, 52.7% {{of the population was}} female compared to 47.2% male. Stirling had both a smaller proportion of under 16s, at 16.7% compared to the Scottish average of 19.2%, and a smaller proportion of those of pensionable age – 17.8% – compared to the Scottish average of 18.6%. The highest proportion of the population, at 24.3%, was concentrated in the 16–29 age group. Stirling also had a higher proportion of non-Scottish born residents at 16.5%, compared to the Scottish average of 12.8%.

2500|$|The {{music in}} Orchid {{combines}} elements influenced by progressive rock and acoustics pieces of folk {{music to the}} black metal scream and the death metal growl, as well having clean vocals. It also contains influences from jazz and melodic passages played by a piano and acoustic guitars. Opeth sounded much different than the casual black or death metal bands {{at that time and}} it's the closest album that the band came to the black genre. Critics described the sound of the album as it being [...] "unique". Jim Raggi wrote [...] "If you're wanting the more deathy and song oriented Opeth, skip down to My Arms, Your Hearse <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>from</b> there. If you're looking for a unique journey of music built alternately around dual guitar harmonies knocking into sequences when the two guitars and the bass are all playing different parts, stop-start transitions at times and smooth here-to-theres at others, here you go." [...] Matt Smith stated that [...] "with Orchid, the band introduced its blend of intricate, down-tempo acoustic guitar and piano lines and swinging, Celtic-sounding, distorted rhythms." ...|$|E
