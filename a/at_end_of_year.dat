40|$|A solar {{hydrogen}} hybrid {{system has been}} developed to convert, store and use energy from renewable energy sources. The theoretical model has been implemented in a dynamic model-based software environment and applied to real data. A photovoltaic sub-system drives a residential load and, if a surplus of energy is available, an electrolyzer to produce hydrogen which is stored in a cluster of nitrogen-cooled tanks filled with activated carbons; when needed, hydrogen is used in a fuel cell to supply power to the load. Hydrogen storage is achieved through physisorption at low temperature and low pressures. Physisorptionstorage provides safer operations along with good gravimetric and volumetric capacities at costs comparable to or smaller than compression or liquefaction storage. Results show that the system has stand-alone capabilities with a surplus production of hydrogen <b>at</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>year.</b> Tanks are reasonable in size and weight for stationary applications,and surplus can contribute to recharge batteries or fill tanks for non-stationary uses...|$|E

The data obtained shows high concentration of iron (Fe) elements in all the sampled location. The study area also shows a low pH value which suggested it has acidic properties. Several factors may cause the acidity in the soil sample such as high precipitation rate at Kuala Krai. The concentration of the other elements such as sodium (Na) only present in low concentration. The moisture content of the sample also investigated. The geology of the area need to be study in much more details. There are also abundance of quartzite, a metamorphic rock at the Kuala Krai.

40|$|For those {{combined}} {{heat and}} power plants {{that was built}} before the Swedish green electricity certificate system was implemented, the certificates will disappear <b>at</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>year</b> 2012. The first {{combined heat and power}} plant built in Falun (KVV 1) needs to be upgraded in order to be granted renewed license for green certificates. The main objective of this work is to provide the basis for choosing an upgraded system layout. A number of different upgrade alternatives have been investigated. The study is based on calculations and simulations in the program Solvo together with district heat load data managed in MS Excel. The different alternatives for upgrading the power plant have also been evaluated economically and compared to a case where no upgrade is carried out. The most interesting alternatives have shown to be the systems that include reheat cycles and the use of two condensers. Another interesting alternative includes building a new plant beside the old one. The results show {{that it is possible to}} invest in the range of 330 – 700 Mkr for these alternatives. If the interest rate amounts to 6 %, the price for electricity is increased to 550 kr/MWh, electricity certificates to 300 kr/MWh and the payback time set to 20 years, the investment may amount to more than one billion SEK and still obtain a lower annual electricity production cost compared to the case where no upgrade is carried out.

40|$|Background: A fair, meaningful, {{and timely}} {{evaluation}} {{of the performance of}} faculty is one of the cornerstones of administrative and academic success in any residency program. The faculty’s teaching performance is an essential factor, influencing the quality of the educational experience for residents. The evaluation of faculty’s teaching performance by residents has found to be valid and reliable in literature. It provides an opportunity for feedback to faculty members with the intent of reflective improvement and also acts a basis for identification of areas for faculty development, prioritizing resource allocation, and assisting in the promotion and tenure process. Residents hesitate in evaluating faculty if the process is not anonymous from the fear of impact it may have on their own evaluation by faculty. Methods: An online form was developed using validated questions relevant to our program. A link was sent to residents using, survey software {{at the end of each}} rotation through email. The filled and uploaded forms could not be edited. The residency director had access to all forms but individual forms the name of resident who had filled the form could not be seen. At the end of year all forms for each faculty member were pooled and the mean score for each attribute was sent to faculty individually. Results: All residents participated in the process and <b>at</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>year</b> feedback could be given to faculty. Conclusions: This system provided an effective means for residents to evaluate faculty fairly without any fear of repercussions and helped the program improve on its weaknesses...|$|E
40|$|The Chinese {{stock exchanges}} are an {{integral}} part of Chinese and global economy having a combined market capitalization of 3697 billion USD <b>at</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>year</b> 2012. Due to their size and economic impact it is important that they maintain growth and stability. Writers have maintained that voluntary corporate disclosure can help to achieve growth and stability thus the aim of this research is to examine recent Chinese listed companies’ voluntary disclosure practice. The purpose of this study is to investigate voluntary disclosure level of top 50 listed Chinese companies on Shanghai Stock Exchange during 2008 - 2012 period. This study primarily utilizes a quantitative approach. The author constructs a Voluntary Disclosure Index (VDI) based on legislative/regulatory consideration, investor demand, investor sophistication and previous studies. This VDI score is then used to measure companies’ voluntary disclosure level. The results of this study indicate that the overall voluntary disclosure level did not increase during 2008 - 2012, rather it dropped. Some interesting findings about disclosure level and individual disclosure item scores in certain disclosure categories stood out; for example, nearly all companies detached their CSR report or sustainability report from their annual reports in 2010, resulted a sharp decline in voluntary disclosure level in certain related disclosure category. Further there was little employment information disclosed particularly of note are the areas of minority and gender, and little forward looking corporate focused financial information as opposed to general economic expectations was disclosed. By using more recent data and considering the changes in China’s corporate disclosure regulation system in recent years, this study addresses certain gaps from previous Chinese studies. This study also explores some regulatory loopholes in China’s disclosure regulation system and certain insufficiencies in investors’ education, thus this study can be of value to policy makers. Overall it is hoped that this study can lead to greater engagement between Chinese corporations and investors particularly in the area of voluntary disclosure...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to collect and analyse current data related to repair and {{maintenance}} costs of tractors and combines. Specific objectives of this study were: (a) to collect current repair cost data for tractors and combines; (b) to compare these data with yearly repair cost estimates derived from ASAE repair cost formulas; (c) to estimate expected tractor life; (d) to estimate expected combine life; (e) to study the factors affecting repair costs of tractors and combines; (f) to develop appropriate new repair cost equations for tractors and combines;Two questionnaire surveys were conducted by the author to collect current repair cost data for tractors and combines from a sample of Iowa farmers who owned these machines in 1984 and 1985. Factors affecting repair and maintenance costs of tractors and combines included make and model, age, annual use, and farm size. The results showed that there were no effects of tractor and combine make on repair and maintenance costs. The relationships between repair costs and age were highly significant. Also, the greatest single factor affecting hourly tractor and combine repair costs was the annual use;Testing the validity of the ASAE formulas for predicting repair costs indicated that these formulas, except for one equation, do not accurately predict yearly repair and maintenance costs for Central Iowa tractors and combines. The data show that the average tractor life estimated by the farmers was 8355 hours, and it was 3575 hours for combines. Using the STEPWISE regression procedure to fit the best model for predicting yearly repair costs for tractors and combines leads to the following two equations: For wheel tractor: Y =. 072 TAH +. 0096 P +. 66 H + 78. For self-propelled combine: Y = 241. 70 N +. 016 P + 2. 27 H + 1. 07 A - 1894. 9.
