5|$|Whitehall's powers over Southern Rhodesia {{under the}} 1923 {{constitution}} were, on paper, considerable; the British Crown was theoretically able to cancel any passed bill within a year, or alter the constitution however it wished. These reserved powers {{were intended to}} protect the indigenous black Africans from discriminatory legislation and to safeguard British commercial interests in the colony, but as Claire Palley comments in her constitutional history of the country, {{it would have been}} extremely difficult for Whitehall to enforce such actions, and attempting to do so would have probably caused <b>a</b> <b>crisis.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> event, they were never exercised. A generally co-operative relationship developed between Whitehall and the colonial government and civil service in Salisbury, and dispute was rare.|$|E

This firm was created through the acquisition of Westland Helicopters by Finmeccanica in 2000. In January 1986 the proposed sale of Westland to the American Sikorsky Aircraft group led to the Westland affair, <b>a</b> <b>crisis</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Thatcher government, the resignation of Michael Heseltine as Secretary of State for Defence and the resignation two weeks later of the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, Leon Brittan, after his admission of leaking of a governmental law officer's letter which harshly criticised Mr Heseltine.|$|E

5|$|Philip's offer {{coincided with}} <b>a</b> <b>crisis</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Levant. In 1187 Jerusalem {{surrendered}} to Saladin {{and calls for}} a new crusade swept Europe. Richard was enthusiastic and announced his intention to join the crusade, and Henry and Philip Augustus announced their similar intent {{at the start of}} 1188. Taxes began to be raised and plans made for supplies and transport. Richard was keen to start his crusade, but was forced to wait for Henry to make his arrangements. In the meantime, Richard set about crushing some of his enemies in Aquitaine in 1188, before once again attacking the Count of Toulouse. Richard's campaign undermined the truce between Henry and Philip and both sides again mobilised large forces in anticipation of war. This time Henry rejected Philip's offers of a short-term truce in the hope of convincing the French king to agree to a long-term peace deal, but Philip refused to consider Henry's proposals. A furious Richard, however, believed that Henry was stalling for time and delaying the departure of the crusade.|$|E

Al-Radi remained the nominal party leader, but his position as secretary was changed to that of first secretary, with three assistant secretaries appointed who were all close to Abdallah.|$|E

The validity of the excommunication has always been denied by the SSPX, who argue that the consecrations were necessary due to <b>a</b> <b>crisis</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Catholic Church. The excommunications, including that of Williamson, were lifted on 21 January 2009, but the suspension of the bishops from the exercise of ministry within the Catholic Church remained in force.|$|E

25|$|The {{collapse}} of the communist regimes in Eastern Europe in 1989 and {{the fall of the}} Soviet Union in 1991 caused <b>a</b> <b>crisis</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Cuban economy. The Soviets were Cuba's chief trading partner, and had effectively sheltered Cuba's sugar industry with large subsidies for 30 years. The lack of economic diversification during this period, and the sudden loss of key markets sent the country into a deep economic depression known in Cuba as the Special Period. The crisis precipitated the communist regime to find new avenues of income.|$|E
25|$|After 1968, when Bolte turned 60, {{his appeal}} to younger urban voters declined, {{and he showed}} little sympathy with new {{issues such as the}} {{environment}} and civil liberties.

The government recruited large numbers of American schoolteachers to deal with the shortage. At the same time the Labor Party began to revive under a new leader, Clyde Holding.|$|E
25|$|The United States Department of Defense in a 2011 report {{stated that}} the primary mission of the PRC {{military}} is a possible military conflict with Taiwan, including also possible US military assistance.

However, also other priorities are becoming increasingly prominent and possible due to increasing military resources.

They returned to San Blas with the Princess Royal and the Argonaut, with their captains and crews as prisoners, as well as the Fair American. The captured North West America, renamed Santa Gertrudis la Magna, returned to San Blas separately. The Fair American was released in early 1790 without much notice.

The departure of these companies to Barrio Alto and the construction of shopping centers all around the city created <b>a</b> <b>crisis</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city center. To reinvent the area, the main shopping streets were turned into pedestrian walkways, such as the Paseo Ahumada, and the government instituted tax benefits for the construction of residential buildings, which attracted young adults.|$|E
