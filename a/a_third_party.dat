5|$|An agency {{relationship}} is between three parties - a principal, who authorises an agent {{to make a}} contract on his behalf with <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>party.</b> In agency situations an agent can make a contract with <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>party</b> that is binding on the principal, even though he was not privy to the original contract. The right of an agent to make this sort of agreement is found in statute, such as the Consumer Credit Act 1974 which allows a dealer for a financial company to set up credit agreements as a representative of that company.|$|E

The leaked episode did not contain the new arrangement of the theme tune by Murray Gold. The leak was ultimately traced to <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>party</b> company in Canada which had a legitimate preview copy. The employee responsible was fired by the company and the BBC considered further legal action.|$|E
5|$|Production of Star Trek began {{three years}} before release under Tom Lesinski at Paramount Digital Entertainment. Lesinkski had a {{background}} in video game production, having previously worked at companies such as Crystal Dynamics, Ion Storm and Kuju Entertainment. He {{made the decision to}} produce a game in-house, rather than licensing it out to <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>party</b> as had previously been the case under the previous ten-year Activision contract. As a result, the game was the first ever to be produced and released by Paramount Studios directly.|$|E

5|$|Two years later, Byrne v. Alas (1888), {{the court}} {{distinguished}} its holding by reversing a quiet title judgment against {{a group of}} Mission Indians. Byrne, in distinguishing Doaksum, held that the fact of <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>party</b> validating title to certain lands was conclusive {{of the fact that}} those lands were not in the public domain, and thus, that the aboriginal title was not extinguished.|$|E

40|$|This article {{considers}} {{the problem of}} admitting evidence of <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>party’s</b> guilt. Part II addresses several different approaches {{for dealing with the}} problem of admitting evidence of <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>party’s</b> guilt and will argue that under these approaches or tests, two factors are critical to the admission of such evidence: (1) the nexus or connection between the <b>third</b> <b>party</b> and his commission of the charged crime, as demonstrated by the proffered evidence, and (2) the weight of that evidence or the strength of that connection. Part III argues that under the prevailing approach in several courts, the burden of proof has been unconstitutionally placed on the wrong party—the defendant. This article argues that the burden is properly placed upon the state to oppose the introduction of evidence of <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>party’s</b> guilt. This conclusion is based on the following factors: (1) these defenses are not affirmative defenses, (2) these defenses go to a critical element of the government’s case, to wit, the identity of the perpetrator, which the government constitutionally has the burden of proving, and (3) it is unconstitutional to burden the defendant with this obligation...|$|R
5|$|After Southern Democrats {{walked out}} of the 1860 Democratic National Convention, the party's {{northern}} and southern factions held rival conventions in Baltimore that nominated Douglas and Breckinridge, respectively, for president. <b>A</b> <b>third</b> <b>party,</b> the Constitutional Union Party, nominated John Bell. These three men split the Southern vote, while more anti-slavery Republican candidate Abraham Lincoln won all but three electoral votes in the North, allowing him to win the election. Breckinridge carried most of the Southern states. Taking his seat in the Senate, Breckinridge urged compromise to preserve the Union. Unionists were in control of the state legislature, and gained more support when Confederate forces moved into Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|Alliance members {{gathered}} that December in Ocala, Florida, and formulated a platform, {{later called}} the Ocala Demands, {{that called for}} looser money, government control of the railroads, a graduated income tax, and the direct election of senators. Weaver endorsed the message in the Tribune and corresponded with the group's leader, LeonidasL. Polk. Weaver attended the group's convention in Cincinnati in May 1891, where he and Polk argued against forming <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>party.</b> Another delegate, IgnatiusL. Donnelly, argued forcefully for {{a break from the}} two major parties, and his argument carried the day, although Weaver and Polk kept many of Donnelly's more radical proposals out of the convention's statement of principles.|$|E
5|$|Bars and {{restaurants}} are considered strictly liable for their patrons' behavior, and liquor licenses can be suspended or revoked if a customer engages in illegal activity (e.g. fighting, public urination) after drinking. New Jersey law recognizes both dram shop liability and social host liability, wherein the server of alcohol to visibly intoxicated persons or minors is liable {{if that person}} then causes death or injury to <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>party</b> in an alcohol-related automobile collision or other accident. In order to mitigate liability, the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) grants licensed establishments the right to exclude any patron for any reason, but warns business against violating civil rights laws.|$|E

5|$|In response, Tyler, already {{ejected from}} the Whig party, quickly began to {{organize}} <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>party</b> in hopes of inducing the Democrats to embrace a pro-expansionist platform. By running as a third-party candidate, Tyler threatened to siphon off pro-annexation Democratic voters; Democratic party disunity would mean the election of Henry Clay, a staunchly anti-Texas Whig. Pro-annexation delegates among southern Democrats, with assistance {{from a number of}} northern delegates, blocked anti-expansion candidate Martin Van Buren at the convention, which instead nominated the pro-expansion champion of Manifest Destiny, James K. Polk of Tennessee. Polk unified his party under the banner of Texas and Oregon acquisition.|$|E

These policies {{must be in the}} amount of no less than CAD$1 million for vehicles with a capacity of fewer than 10 passengers, and no less than CAD$5 million for vehicles with a capacity of 10 or more. This also applies to parents driving others' children to school related extracurricular activities.|$|E
5|$|Registration {{takes place}} through <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>party,</b> a domain name registrar.

The registrar registers the domain {{on behalf of}} the holder, and the holder then holds the right to the domain name until it is terminated, unless a dispute resolution dictates otherwise. Norid charges registrars 60 Norwegian krone (NOK) per registration and change of holder, as well as NOK60 in an annual fee per domain. Registrars must meet criteria regarding technical and administrative resources, must pay an annual fee of NOK5,000 and a deposit of minimum NOK10,000, depending on activity level. Registrars must also undertake a minimum activity of either administrating or registering forty domains per year.|$|E

5|$|Roosevelt {{had been}} {{surprised}} by {{the outcome of the}} Republican convention, having expected to oppose a conservative isolationist. The polls showed Willkie behind by only six points, and the president expected this to be a more difficult race than he had faced in his defeats of Hoover and Landon. Roosevelt felt that Willkie's nomination would remove the war issue from the campaign. Roosevelt was nominated by the Democratic convention in Chicago in July, though he stated that because of the world crisis, he would not actively campaign, leaving that to surrogates. The fact that both major-party presidential candidates favored intervention frustrated isolationists, who considered wooing Charles Lindbergh as <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>party</b> candidate.|$|E
5|$|Several local {{businesses}} considered contributing {{money to the}} mountain's purchase. Such funding would be considered surplus, {{and would not be}} subject to referendum. Owners of businesses on Main Street expressed concern at the June1 town board meeting that the cost of parking would increase if the property was purchased by <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>party.</b> One board member estimated that without paying rent, the town would recoup the cost of the property within 12 years. Ulster County Area Transit expressed a desire to route its buses through the property, creating a connection to the Mohonk Preserve. A nonprofit organization, the Joppenbergh Mountain Preservation Association, was created in June 2011 to raise funding to purchase the mountain, the parking lot, and Willow Kiln Park.|$|E
