50|$|Top {{fermentation}} or high fermentation is a brewing {{method for}} beer whereby the yeast floats {{on top of}} the wort. The yeast is Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Top fermentation is done at an <b>ambiant</b> <b>temperature</b> of 15-25 °C, {{depending on the type of}} beer.|$|E
50|$|Top {{fermentation}} is {{a process}} that is difficult to control, because unwanted bacteria might contaminate the brew due to the high <b>ambiant</b> <b>temperature.</b> The final result of a brew might vary quite drmamtically. After the first fermentation the beer is tasted and for certain beers fermented again. This second fermentation can be done in an open tub or in the bottle. In the latter case the beer is bottled with added extra sugar and yeast.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{temperature}} and food shortage on {{the occurrence of}} torpor have been studied in a medium-weight shrew, Crocidura russula (9 - 13 g). When fed ad libitum. the shrews cannot be forced into torpor by a sudden decrease of the <b>ambiant</b> <b>temperature</b> (from 22 °C to 3 °C). At 22 °C, a progressive restriction of the daily food ration, to below 3 g of mealworms, induces torpors of increasing duration, a reduction of the daily activity and a reduction of the body weight. The minimal daily food ration required for survivals is 1 to 1, 5 G. At low <b>ambiant</b> <b>temperature</b> (e. g. 5 °C), torpor can be induced at higher food levels (4 - 5 g) ...|$|E
40|$|Some {{aspects of}} torpor {{have been studied}} among captive Suncus etruscus by {{recording}} the nest temperature. Torpors show a circadian pattern and occur spontaneously or can be induced by food shortage. Body temperature can be controlled during torpor, remaining relatively high at low <b>ambiant</b> <b>temperatures.</b> At 20 ° C, spontaneous torpors seem to be less deep than induced tropors, but both show similar patterns at 5 - 8 ° C. Spontaneous torpors begin between 01 °° and 06 °°, whereas the onset of diet induced torpors seems to depend also on food exhausting. The rates of activity (A) and of torpor (T) show under constant conditions a daily variability. Increase of T is linked with a decrease of A and the relationship could agree with A(%) = Ao(1 -T/ 100), where Ao is daily rate of activity when T = 0. Occurence of torpor among other Soricidae, possible occurence among free living Suncus etruscus and energy saving are discusse...|$|R
40|$|The thermal {{behavior}} of tree trunks is currently only partially understood despite its {{great importance to}} forest productivity and climatic effects. From a remote sensing viewpoint, {{a better understanding of}} the relationship between the thermal regime of a tree and its thermal and microwave signal is necessary. The present study addresses two main questions: (1) How do tree trunk temperatures vary, spatially and temporally, in relation to different environmental factors. (2) How can observed thermal infrared radiations from the trunks describe these variations, and with which level of precision. In this study, measurements of internal temperatures (made with thermocouples), and of surface temperatures (made with thermographic images) of tree trunks under winter and summer conditions allowed us to describe the thermal {{behavior of}} trees. Results show that the radiant energy absorption can raise the surface and internal temperatures very rapidly and by several degrees above the <b>ambiant</b> air <b>temperature.</b> The temperature distribution tends to be highly asymmetric, with differences as large as 20 ÀC between the hottest and coldest areas of the trunk...|$|R
40|$|OLT 35 K {{steel is}} part of the non-allied steel category, used for the {{achievement}} of tubes that work at high temperature. Specimen has been taken from this tube type, placed in a steam boiler, from which strip drive test-bars were manufactured. Afterwards, they were tried on driving, at <b>ambiant</b> and high <b>temperature,</b> close to the ones used in operation, so as to determine the mechanical features of the material, after a certain period of use. Conclusions made, concerning the influence of temperature on how the OLT 35 K steel deals with high temperature, can be taken from the results and, in this way, you can estimate the remaining life-length of both that material and implicitly that of the source equipment...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDuring a 9 -month period (corresponding to {{a sexual}} cycle), the adult male tench, Tinca tinca, {{was kept in}} fish farm ponds {{receiving}} heated water from a power plant. In 1974, the males were submitted to three different temperature regimes : group I : ambiant temperature; group II : <b>ambiant</b> <b>temperature</b> + 3 °C; group III : <b>ambiant</b> <b>temperature</b> + 6 °C. The experiment was repeated in 1975, but only using groups I and Ill. The reproductive cycle and thermal treatment were studied from a quantitative analysis of spermatogenesis, {{the duration of the}} spawning cycle and radioimmunoassay (RIA) measurement of gonadotropin (GTH) in plasma and pituitary, using a carp RIA system turned out to be sensitive enough to assay tench GTH, which was expressed in a c-GTH equivalent. Spermatogenesis in the tench was a discontinuous process, starting in the spring and finishing in the summer. It began earlier in heated water in which the spawning period was also considerably longer (3 months in group III against 1 month in group I). At the beginning of spermatogenesis, pituitary and plasma GTH was low, but rose rapidly when spermatogenesis was initiated (appearance of type B spermatogonial cysts and meiosis). The highest GTH levels in the blood were recorded during the spawning period, with important fluctuations probably due to discharges from the pituitary...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{effects of}} {{temperature}} both on supersonic jet noise with water injection (used for noise reduction) {{and on the}} efficiency of the method are investigated. The location of injection varies from 1. 5 D to 15 D while the other parameters remain fixed to their optimum values. One notices better overall noise level reductions by injecting close to the nozzle exit. Moreover spectra analysis emphasizes that attenuation in high and low frequencies depends on the location of injection. Finally, the jet temperature doesn't greatly affect the efficiency of this method as the measured attenuation is similar to that encountered with supersonic jets with <b>ambiant</b> <b>temperature...</b>|$|E
40|$|Amorphous {{phases of}} Al-Pt and Ni-Zr have been {{synthesized}} by solid state reaction (SSR) of composite metal multilayers produced by cold rolling. The resulting material was investigated {{by means of}} X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy (SEM and TEM), magnetization measurements, differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetry. The amorphization reaction was observed to occur already during the mechanical deformation near <b>ambiant</b> <b>temperature</b> and to depend strongly {{on the nature of}} the annealing atmosphere and on the homogeneity of the as-prepared materials. The presence of dissolved gases and thickness in homogeneities are suggested to contribute to the observed accelerated amorphisation kinetics as compared to similar composites prepared by other techniques...|$|E
40|$|At the Fraunhofer-Institute for Solar Energy Systems, the {{spectral}} {{distribution of the}} solar radiation has been measured since 1981. This paper discusses a new measurement stand for determining {{the influence of the}} solar spectral distribution, the irradiance level and temperature on the performances of PV devices. Construction, calibration method and measurement examples are given for a filter spectrometer, used in long-term maesurements. Besides the 100 spectral channels the data aquisition system has 15 additional channels which offer the possibility of monitoring theoutput of other devices during the same measurement cycle: the global irradiance, the irradiance in {{the spectral}} range above 805 nm, the <b>ambiant</b> <b>temperature,</b> as well as the short circuit current, the current and voltage from at MPP and the temperature of three solarcells or modules. Experimental results these additional channels are also presented...|$|E

40|$|A {{prestressed}} TT beam {{had been}} designed considering the ultimate limit state of bending, and considering a temperature distribution given by a graph which was valid for a section with a similar shape. When tested in a furnace, it proved to have a fire resistance of only 79 minutes instead of the 2 hours foreseen by the calculation. An investigation was made, {{with the help of}} numerical modelling, to explain the reasons of the failure and to design a new specimen. Some modifications were introduced to increase the resistance to bending forces, to shear forces and to the slip of the tendons. A modified specimen behaved satisfactory in a second test. The formula proposed in Eurocode 2 for the shear resistance of reinforced concrete elements at <b>ambiant</b> <b>temperature</b> has been adapted for the elevated temperature situation and its application allowed to accurately predict the failure mode observed in the fiist test...|$|E

In continuation of this line of investigation, we have synthesized compound (I); it will be subjected to further pharmacological investigations, especially tests of its anticancer activity. The product (II) was prepared from 5 -benzyl- 6 -methylpyridazin- 3 (2 H) -one (I) in situ by the solid-liquid PTC conditions without solvent[3]. To pyridazin (I) (1. 2 g, 6 mmol) was added (2. 75 g, 9 mmol) of potassium carbonate, (0. 3 g, 1 mmol) of TBAB and (1 g, 6 mmol) of 2 -ethyl bromoacetate.

40|$|Problem statement: Photovoltaic {{solar cell}} {{generate}} electric by receiving sun light or solar irradiance. But solar cell received heat from solar irradiance {{as well and}} this will reduced {{the efficiency of the}} solar cell. The heat trap at the solar photovoltaic panel become waste energy. Approach: The solution for this was by adding a cooling system to the photovoltaic panel. The {{purpose of this study was}} to cool the solar cell in order to increase its electrical efficiency and also to produce heat energy in the form of hot air. Hot air can be used for drying applications. A single pass PVT with rectangle tunnel absorber has been developed. The rectangle tunnel acted as an absorber and was located at the back side of a standard photovoltaic panel. The dimension of the photovoltaic panel was 120 × 53 cm. The size of the rectangle tunnel was 27 units of tunnel bar with the size of 1. 2 × 2. 5 × 120 cm (width×tall×length) and 12 units with 1. 2 × 2. 5 × 105. 3 cm (width×tall×length). The rectangle tunnel was connected in parallel. The PVT collector has been tested using a solar simulator. Results: Electrical efficiency increased when the solar cell was cool by air flow. Solar photovoltaic thermal collector with rectangle tunnel absorber has better electrical and thermal efficiency compared to solar collector without rectangle tunnel absorber. Photovoltaic, thermal and combined photovoltaic thermal efficiency of 10. 02, 54. 70 and 64. 72 % at solar irradiance of 817. 4 W m - 2, mass flow rate of 0. 0287 kg sec - 1 at <b>ambiant</b> <b>temperature</b> of 25 °C respectively has been obtained.

40|$|International audienceSmectite clays {{are widely}} {{found on the}} Earth surface. They possess a {{connected}} mesoporous space in the micrometer range, and nanopores inside the mineral grains. The grains are stacks of individual 1 nm-thick clay particles (the layers) {{with the ability to}} swell by incorporating H 2 O molecules (or other molecules such as CO 2) in-between the layers, depending on the <b>ambiant</b> <b>temperature</b> and on the relative humidity (RH) present in the mesoporous space surrounding the grain. Imposing a gradient of RH along a temperature- controlled dry sample of smectite clay, we investigate the diffusive transport of water molecules in vapor phase through the material. As water molecules diffuse through the mesoporous space, (i) some of them intercalate into the nanopores, (ii) causing the grains to swell and the separation of clay grains into particles of smaller thickness. From (ii) results a change in the geometry of the mesoporous space, with a decrease in the mesoporous volume available for vapor diffusion. These two effects (i and ii) render the transport process potentially anomalous. We monitor it using space- and time-resolved X-ray diffraction at a synchrotron source. Indeed, water absorption into the nano-layered grains changes the interlayer repetition distance (d-spacing) of the stacks, which is seen in the diffraction data. A separate calibration experiment allows mapping this monotonous evolution of d {{as a function of the}} RH. By measuring d in space and time in the transport experiments we thus record the time evolution of RH profiles along the direction of the initial RH gradient. To model the data we consider a 1 D effective diffusion process described by a fractional time diffusion equation with a diffusion coefficient that depends on the RH. It is possible to rescale all RH profiles onto a single master curve as a function of (x/t) γ/ 2, where γ is the exponent characteristic of the fractional derivative. We observe that when the clay sample is prepared with sodium cations intercalated in the nanopores, vapor transport is normal (γ= 2), while if the interlayer cation is lithium the transport is strongly subdiffusive. This is explained by the different dynamics of cation intercalation in these two clays. In both cases we also obtain the dependence of the effective diffusion coefficient on relative humidity...|$|E
