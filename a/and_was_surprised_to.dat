5|$|Unidentified police sources {{alleged that}} Condit had {{admitted}} to {{an affair with}} Levy during an interview with law enforcement officers on July 7, 2001. Condit described her to police as a vegetarian who avoided drinking and smoking. He thought that Levy was going to return to Washington, D.C. after her graduation <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> {{find out that the}} lease on her apartment had ended. Investigators searched Condit's apartment on July 10. They questioned flight attendant Anne Marie Smith, who claimed that Condit told her she did not need to speak to the Federal Bureau of Investigation about his personal life. Federal officials began investigating Condit for possible obstruction of justice, as Smith was also involved in an affair with him. (She was not acquainted with Levy.) Upset by leaks to the media, Condit refused to submit to a polygraph test by the D.C. police; his attorney asserted that Condit passed a test administered by a privately hired examiner on July 13. He avoided answering direct questions during a televised interview on August 23, with news anchor Connie Chung on the ABC News program Primetime Thursday. Intensive coverage continued until news of the September 11 attacks superseded the media's coverage of the Levy case.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{the close}} {{resemblance}} {{of his voice}} to the legendary singer Mukesh (Mukesh Chand Mathur), Babla began his career recording covers of Mukesh songs for T-Series. Then one day, in 1990, seminal Indian film composer R.D. Burman was passing through Khar, Mumbai, {{when he heard the}} song ‘Sajan re jhoothmut bolo’ blaring from an audio cassette shop. Burman commented on how well Mukesh had sung the song, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> learn it was not Mukesh, but the voice of Babla coming from the shop. He was so impressed he contacted Babla and asked to meet him the very next day. Then Pancham Da took Babla under his wing, and he became a regular singer in Pancham Da’s live shows. Unfortunately, Puncham Da’s failing health delayed his film music debut.|$|E

McDonnell marched through dense rata forest to reach Te Ngutu o Te Manu, which he had last visited in May <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> find a new palisade in front of the village. He split his force into two sections to storm the palisade from the front and circle it from the left to enter near the rear. The raid was a modest success, with his troops capturing weapons and ammunition and burning part of the village, most of whose inhabitants were out hunting for food. McDonnell's troops were forced to retreat under heavy fire as Māori returned, regrouped in the bush and pursued them to the Waingongoro River.

The émigré infantry under General Gelb and cavalry led by Louis Antoine, Duke of Enghien rushed in pursuit. On this day the Royalists were mauled and Gelb was killed while Enghien's coat was riddled with bullet holes. The Duke of Bourbon narrowly escaped death. When he cut his way into the 19th Line Infantry, a Republican officer recognized him and saluted with his sword rather than running him through. On 9 December, Saint-Cyr advanced on Berstheim again <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> find that the Royalists had retired. This move was part of Wurmser's deliberate withdrawal to the Moder.|$|E

500|$|Halfway {{through the}} casting process, Cardiac Arrest actress Helen Baxendale became available. BAFTA Scotland award-nominated Baxendale {{was seen as}} a coup, though she was {{hesitant}} to audition as she believed that she could not do comedy. Harries persuaded her that she was more than qualified, citing her comedic performance in Cardiac Arrest. She was cast as Rachel on the basis of her chemistry at the audition with Nesbitt. Fay Ripley assumed that she would be reading for the role of Rachel, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> be auditioning for Jenny. Many of the actresses seen for the part were [...] "finger-wagging" [...] and [...] "predictable", an approach Ripley did not take. Raised in Surrey, Ripley had to adopt a Manchester accent for the part. She [...] "managed to bodge together a sort of Manchester accent" [...] for the audition, assuming that she would not get the part. When she was cast, she worked on improving the accent by spending time talking to local people.|$|E

On the eve of battle, Kaldalis met privately with Artanis on Saalok. Artanis doubted that the reclamation was worth the casualties <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> learn Kaldalis had volunteered to join the Akhundelar. Kaldalis declared the hierarch's vision of protoss unity gave him hope, and that it was a future he was willing to die for. Kaldalis deployed to the surface of Aiur with two other zealots, and two high templar. Their task was to defend a probe warping in a pylon, thereby establish a foothold. The group was attacked by zerg from atop a hill, and from burrows around them. Eventually, only Kaldalis remained to face the enemy. However, enough time had been bought for the pylon to materialize, and Kaldalis was reinforced by zealots warping in.|$|E
500|$|At the age {{of sixteen}} months, Randles enjoyed {{pressing}} keys on the piano and attempting to [...] "pick out a melody".

Due to her age, she needed to hit each key with the side of the hand. He discovered that she could play the basic melody for both the Blue Bells of Scotland and Charley over the water. Her father decided to start teaching her some other simple tunes and the musical notes. Before she could talk, she had the ability to recognise notes and press the piano keys which related to them. Her father went on to teach Randles the melody to the Welsh folk song, Ar hyd y nos. Randles also attempted to play the chords so her father ended up teaching her the full piece.|$|E

Stax was unable to regain the rights to its recordings and severed its Atlantic relationship. Atlantic also held the rights to all unreleased Otis Redding masters.
