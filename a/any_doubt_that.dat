5|$|A {{series of}} superb club cricket {{performances}} removed <b>any</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> Wills would play for Victoria {{in the next}} intercolonial against New South Wales, scheduled for March 1872 on the MCG. Before the game, representatives from both colonies met and entered into a bilateral agreement designed to call Wills. When he opened the bowling, Wills became the first cricketer to be called for throwing in a top-class Australian match. He was called two more times in two overs, and did not bowl again. He was again no-balled when a Victorian side under his captaincy lost to a combined XIII from New South Wales, Tasmania and South Australia late in 1872.|$|E
5|$|Fitzgibbons {{argues that}} it was not {{impossible}} for Cromwell's body to have been substituted before his posthumous execution. One proposition is that Sergeant Norfolke, who exhumed the bodies from the abbey, found the tombs of Cromwell and Ireton empty, prompting the government to sanction an exhumation of two other graves. This has been put forward because Bradshaw's body arrived at the Red Lion Inn at Holborn a day after Cromwell and Ireton, prompting rumour that he was the only real body to be hanged at Tyburn. An alternative theory is that Cromwell's friends bribed the guards attending Cromwell's body, “privately interring him in a small paddock near Holborn”, so that when the sledges dragged the bodies to the gallows, Cromwell's body was already buried. The faces on the three bodies, although heavily shrouded, were clearly visible; and since no witnesses expressed <b>any</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> the bodies were those of Cromwell and Ireton, there is no evidence supporting this theory.|$|E

25|$|Arrúe {{remained}} a rather forgotten figure until {{a compilation of}} his works was released in 2008 and triggered some follow up both in media and in historiography. According to the recently published works his contribution to the Basque cause is highly controversial. It remains beyond <b>any</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> he opposed independent Basque political ambitions, defended integrity of Spain and has always considered the Basques part of the Spanish political nation; different views pertain to his intentions and to his impact on Basque culture and Basque national development.|$|E
25|$|The {{erroneous}} {{belief that}} Mary Magdalene was an adulteress, {{the wife of}} Jesus, and a repentant prostitute {{can be traced back}} {{at least as far as}} the fourth century. Because of that opinion's acceptance in an influential homily of Pope Gregory the Great in about 591 the historical error became the generally accepted view in Western Christianity. In his homily, the Pope mistakenly identified Magdalene not only with the anonymous sinner with the perfume in Luke's gospel, but also confused her with Mary of Bethany, the sister of Martha and Lazarus. Karen King concludes that the discoveries of new texts by biblical scholars, combined with their sharpened critical insight, have now proved beyond <b>any</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> the disreputable portrait of Mary Magdalene is entirely inaccurate.|$|E

The previously Conservative-held constituency went to Heffer on a large swing in the 1964 general election, as did {{a number of other}} Liverpool seats. There was never <b>any</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> Heffer would ally with the left in the Parliamentary Labour Party, and he campaigned in 1965 for early moves to nationalise the docks, where he knew from his experience on Liverpool Trades Council that dockers were employed on highly disadvantageous terms that effectively prevented trade unions forming. Also in 1965 Heffer protested outside the United States embassy against the use of napalm and gas in the Vietnam war, and in Parliament against the diplomatic support given by the government. By 1970 he was rated {{as one of the most}} effective of the large 1964 intake of Labour MPs: in David Butler's The British General Election of 1970 (page 4), he was identified as a leading figure in the Tribune Group, which had been established in 1964.|$|E

25|$|Now {{differences}} between the contemporary squid and octopus samples became very clear. In the octopus, broad bands of fibers passed across {{the plane of the}} tissue and were separated by equally broad bands arranged in a perpendicular direction. In the squid there were narrower but also relatively broad bundles arranged in the plane of the section, separated by thin partitions of perpendicular fibers. It seemed I had found a means to identify the mystery sample after all. I could distinguish between octopus and squid, and between them and mammals, which display a lacy network of connective tissue fibers. After 75 years, the moment of truth was at hand. Viewing section after section of the St. Augustine samples, we decided at once, and beyond <b>any</b> <b>doubt,</b> <b>that</b> the sample was not whale blubber. Further, the connective tissue pattern was that of broad bands in the plane of the section with equally broad bands arranged perpendicularly, a structure similar to, if not identical with, that in my octopus sample. The evidence appears unmistakable that the St. Augustine sea monster was in fact an octopus, but the implications are fantastic. Even though the sea presents us from time to time with strange and astonishing phenomena, the idea of a gigantic octopus, with arms 75 to 100 feet in length and about 18 inches in diameter at the base—a total spread of some 200 feet—is difficult to comprehend.|$|E

The South Sydney Rabbitohs reportedly offered Hunt up to $500,000 a season, but despite these offers, on 29 June, he signed with the Broncos for a further three years.

[...] Although there had been increases in production throughout {{the first three years}} of the war, the minister's efforts truly bore fruit in 1943, in which Canada had the fourth-highest industrial production among the Allies, trailing only the US, USSR, and Britain. By 1944, Canada had produced over 600ships for the war effort, 1,100aircraft, and over half a million cars and trucks, of which 31,000 were armoured. According to Roberts, Howe's actions swung Canada's economy from agriculture-based to industrial, a change which would prove permanent.

500|$|From {{early in}} his England career, D'Oliveira and his {{supporters}} saw the MCC tour of South Africa in 1968–69 as potentially being a key moment in his career. Guy Fraser-Sampson suggests: [...] "Nobody could be in <b>any</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> the possibility of D'Oliveira being chosen {{as a member of}} the England touring party would raise massive political complications". When D'Oliveira visited South Africa to work as a [...] coach in 1966, the subject was raised continually. People speculated whether D'Oliveira would be selected and, if so, whether the South African government would allow him to play. Some of his supporters worried that his acceptance of a place on a tour to South Africa might be interpreted as approval of the political situation there, but D'Oliveira was determined to play, aware of what it would mean to the non-white people of South Africa. In 1967, Griffith flew to South Africa to discuss the forthcoming tour and to seek a solution to any potential problems—the MCC wanted the tour to go ahead without any political trouble. Little came of the meetings; Oborne suggests that both sides simply [...] "agreed to hope that the whole issue went away".|$|E

500|$|Morton {{ranked as}} one of the strongest members of the {{so-called}} [...] "stalwart" [...] faction of the Republican party: those members most deeply committed to protecting and preserving Republican governments in the South. [...] Not surprisingly, during the winter of 1876–77, Morton was among the most aggressive supporters of Hayes's right to the presidency in a close election. When Morton was placed on the Electoral Commission, the group that determined the outcome of the election, there was never <b>any</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> his vote would be cast for Hayes. After Hayes's supporters made overtures to southern Democrats, offering assurances that the president-elect would take no active role in propping up Republican governors in Louisiana and South Carolina, there were fears that Morton might cause difficulties. In one speech Morton {{made it clear that the}} Democrats must make guarantees of fair play and equal rights for southern blacks, before he would support Hayes's program. The guarantees were given, or at least promises were made. To the general surprise of many, Hayes's policy withdrew military support from the Republican governments in those two states, and Morton proved to be one of the president's strongest defenders, urging that his fellow Republicans show patience and give the so-called [...] "New Departure" [...] time to prove itself.|$|E

She also praised Matt Smith's performance and Arthur Darvill's Rory, who was [...] "quickly becoming one of the funniest companions of the new Doctor Who", though she commented that Amy's transformation into a doll was [...] "kind of glossed over within the story itself" [...] and [...] "there was never <b>any</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> it would be reversed". Overall, the episode was given a 7 out of 10 rating. Sam McPherson, writing for Zap2it, called [...] "Night Terrors" [...] the [...] "worst episode of series 6 so far" [...] that was an [...] "incoherent mess of an episode that was utterly unenjoyable" [...] and gave it an overall grade of a C+. He criticised the idea to follow up a story arc-heavy episode with a standalone one, as he felt it [...] "served as a speed bump for the forward momentum started in [...] "A Good Man Goes to War" [...] and continued through [...] "Let's Kill Hitler". He thought that its [...] "biggest flaw" [...] was that George was sidelined in favour of Alex, which missed an opportunity to make it a story [...] "about little boys overcoming fear and fighting off the monsters in their closets".
