5|$|To provide {{realistic}} bodies while {{preventing the}} corpses from moving, {{after a lengthy}} casting process the crew chose extras who could lie <b>as</b> <b>still</b> <b>as</b> possible. For the bath house owner Tsuyako Yamashita, this was not possible owing {{to the need to}} see her alive first, and a search for a body double was unfruitful. Ultimately, the crew used digital effects to transplant a still image of the actor during the character's funeral scene, allowing for a realistic effect.|$|E
25|$|My {{father was}} very slow {{to get into}} the cornfield. He was so indignant at the ruffians that he was unwilling to retreat before them. My little {{children}} were in the field three hours. They seemed to know that if they cried the noise would betray their parents whereabouts, and so they kept <b>as</b> <b>still</b> <b>as</b> mice. The baby was very hungry & I gave her an ear of raw green corn which she ate ravenously.|$|E
25|$|While all wasp stings are unpleasant, {{the sting}} of R. romandi is known for being very painful. Additionally, because R. romandi is a paper wasp, it {{has the ability to}} {{repeatedly}} sting without dying. R. romandi is most aggressive if they are swarming, if their nests are disturbed or if the wasps feel their nest is threatened. If wasps feel threatened, they may swarm out of the nest, and pursue the aggressor. If you ever get swarmed by wasps, it is recommended that you remain <b>as</b> <b>still</b> <b>as</b> possible and move away slowly. Sudden movements will be regarded as aggressive acts and will result in more stings.|$|E
6000|$|KATHERINE {{makes an}} abrupt and painful movement, then remains <b>as</b> [...] <b>still</b> <b>as</b> before, {{leaning against the}} corner of the window-seat.|$|R
6000|$|... 'But mamma cares just <b>as</b> much <b>still</b> <b>as</b> Primrose does,' said Mysie. 'We {{must get}} some {{for her own}} self {{as well as for}} the church.' ...|$|R
6000|$|When Colter's husky voice ceased Ellen whispered through lips <b>as</b> {{cold and}} <b>still</b> <b>as</b> ice, [...] "Let me go ... leave me--heah--alone!" ...|$|R
60|$|Soon Jess was painfully excited, {{though she}} sat <b>as</b> <b>still</b> <b>as</b> salt.|$|E
60|$|But even in {{that bright}} {{moonlight}} the further corners of the great garden were full of mysterious shadows. I peered into {{them as well as}} I could--and my eyes are pretty good naturally, and are well trained. There was not the least movement. The air was <b>as</b> <b>still</b> <b>as</b> death, the foliage <b>as</b> <b>still</b> <b>as</b> though wrought in stone.|$|E
60|$|Mirah {{spoke with}} low-toned fervor, and sat <b>as</b> <b>still</b> <b>as</b> a picture all the while.|$|E
5000|$|Corporal John Miller - <b>still</b> <b>as</b> cynical as ever, but {{has more}} {{faith in his}} companions now.|$|R
60|$|For {{a minute}} or so he {{remained}} <b>as</b> <b>still</b> and limp <b>as</b> an empty jacket on its peg, and then a gust of irritation stirred him.|$|R
60|$|The others {{remained}} <b>as</b> {{silent and}} <b>still</b> <b>as</b> possible, {{so as not}} to disturb him; for all had great confidence in the extraordinary brains of the Scarecrow.|$|R
60|$|And {{his grave}} {{face as he}} worked in silence was <b>as</b> <b>still</b> <b>as</b> the stones of the post-tertiary period.|$|E
60|$|Dartrey sat <b>as</b> <b>still</b> <b>as</b> a man upon whom some {{narcotic}} influence rested, and {{his words}} sounded almost unnatural.|$|E
60|$|It was {{something}} different from that, truly, as she sat <b>as</b> <b>still</b> <b>as</b> a crouched tigress, with her kindling eyes.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of the 21st Century, Oulton Park is <b>still</b> <b>as</b> popular <b>as</b> ever and <b>still</b> <b>as</b> {{demanding}} as it ever has been on drivers and riders, but, in common with so many circuits, it no longer hosts major international events. Gone are the glory days when all the major Formula One teams (including Scuderia Ferrari) came to Cheshire, now the major events on the circuit’s calendar are the twice-yearly visit of the British Superbike Championship and the annual visit of the British Touring Car Championship. This is no fault of the circuit management – it is just the way the sport has gone. But Oulton Park is still the great challenge it always was.|$|R
50|$|Duccini died {{of natural}} causes in Las Vegas, aged 95, on January 16, 2014. Since Duccini's death, only the {{following}} actors who appeared in the film — Jerry Maren, a member of the trio lollipop guild and Caren Marsh Doll (uncredited)— have been confirmed <b>as</b> <b>still</b> alive <b>as</b> of June 2017.|$|R
60|$|They {{stood in}} utter {{solitude}} awhile {{in the evening}} gloom. The air was <b>as</b> <b>still</b> and cold <b>as</b> some grey unfathomable untraversed sea. Above them uncountable clouds drifted slowly across space.|$|R
60|$|He sat <b>as</b> <b>still</b> <b>as</b> marble. There was no change, {{no emotion}} in his face. Yet her heart sank within her.|$|E
60|$|Tim did not move. The school-room was <b>as</b> <b>still</b> <b>as</b> the grave. Not a {{sound was}} to be heard, except {{occasionally}} a long-drawn breath.|$|E
60|$|Then {{suddenly}} the roaring and bellowing ceased, and all was <b>as</b> <b>still</b> <b>as</b> death, though the darkness was as thick and black as ever.|$|E
50|$|It {{was listed}} as 'EN' (endangered), in the Red Data Book of Primorye. It was {{originally}} (incorrectly) listed as 'Iris mandshurica', but in 1988, it was listed <b>as</b> Iris vorobievii, <b>still</b> <b>as</b> endangered.|$|R
6000|$|Silent flows {{the parent}} stream, [...] And if rocks do lie below, [...] Smothers with her waves the din, [...] As {{it were a}} {{youthful}} sin, [...] Just <b>as</b> <b>still,</b> and just <b>as</b> slow.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{the fort}} {{he kept his}} eyes {{fastened}} on was <b>as</b> <b>still</b> and silent <b>as</b> himself. The garrison gave no sign of life. They did not even answer the desultory fire directed at the loopholes.|$|R
60|$|The {{tall trees}} {{stood in the}} {{sunlight}} <b>As</b> <b>still</b> <b>as</b> still could be, But the deep grass sighed and rustled And bowed and beckoned me.|$|E
60|$|Both men {{bent over}} {{him to see}} if he would move. When he lay <b>as</b> <b>still</b> <b>as</b> if dead {{they looked at each other}} with satisfaction.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, she doesn't talk, she's {{perfectly}} still, {{and so is}} Miss Chancellor. They're <b>as</b> <b>still</b> <b>as</b> two watchers--they don't speak. But you {{can hear}} the silence vibrate." ...|$|E
50|$|In recent years, he {{has been}} {{attending}} skeptic meetings across Europe <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>still</b> playing {{a leading role in}} the Hungarian movement at large.|$|R
50|$|Multichannel {{television}} sound, {{better known}} <b>as</b> MTS (often <b>still</b> <b>as</b> BTSC, for the Broadcast Television Systems Committee that created it), is {{the method of}} encoding three additional channels of audio into an analog NTSC-format audio carrier.|$|R
60|$|He danced again. The two men watched him. Draconmeyer's {{face was}} <b>as</b> <b>still</b> and {{colourless}} <b>as</b> ever. In Selingman's {{there was a}} shade of something almost like repulsion. He poured himself out a glass of champagne.|$|R
60|$|The girl put {{her finger}} to her lips to impress silence, and the man nodded; they sat <b>as</b> <b>still</b> <b>as</b> mice whilst the two {{children}} went on talking.|$|E
60|$|All sore {{astonished}} stood Lord Scroope, He stood <b>as</b> <b>still</b> <b>as</b> rock of stane; He scarcely {{dared to}} trew his eyes, When thro the water they had gane.|$|E

6000|$|... "But {{suppose it}} were so, we are <b>still</b> <b>as</b> far as ever from {{unravelling}} {{the mystery of}} his death. Indeed, it becomes not simpler but stranger." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Still</b> <b>as</b> far as ever {{from feeling}} {{reconciled}} to the marriage, Mountjoy read this letter {{with a feeling}} of resentment which disinclined him to answer it.|$|R
