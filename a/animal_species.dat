5|$|There {{are eight}} species of rotavirus, {{referred}} to as A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H. Humans are primarily infected by species A, B and C, most commonly by species A. A–E species cause disease in other <b>animals,</b> <b>species</b> E and H in pigs, and D, F and G in birds.|$|R
5|$|The ancient Egyptians mummified many <b>animal</b> <b>species,</b> from {{cats and}} gazelles to crocodiles, baboons, and birds. Typically, many <b>animal</b> <b>species</b> were {{consumed}} as meat after death, {{but it is}} highly unlikely that dogs would have been eaten. Radiographs of exhumed dogs in the ancient world have revealed that the mummification process involved wrapping the embalmed bones together with bandages and placing them within a wooden statue of Anubis, the jackal-headed deity associated with mummification and the afterlife in ancient Egyptian religion.|$|E

50|$|The gift {{enabled her to}} talk to the Thornberrys' pet {{chimpanzee}} Darwin. Together, {{the pair}} frequently venture through the wilderness, befriending many <b>species</b> of wild <b>animals</b> along the way or realizing moral truths and lessons through either their experiences or a particular <b>animal</b> <b>species's</b> lifestyle, or simply assisting the creatures, by which they become acquainted, in their difficulties.|$|R
5|$|A {{colder climate}} {{introduced}} cold-limited <b>animal</b> <b>species</b> which appeared at lower altitudes, and glaciers formed on the San Bernardino Mountains. A probable southward {{shift of the}} storm belts led to windier weather. According to data obtained from tufa in Lake Cahuilla, a wet period ended 9,000 years before present, and between 6,200 and 3,000-2,000 years before present extended droughts occurred.|$|E
5|$|An {{invasive}} species is a plant, fungus, or <b>animal</b> <b>species</b> {{that is not}} native to a specific location (an introduced species), and which {{has a tendency to}} spread to a degree believed to cause damage to the environment, human economy or human health.|$|E
5|$|<b>Animal</b> <b>species</b> in {{the park}} with special {{conservation}} status are the northern spotted owl, California mountain kingsnake, tailed frog, Del Norte salamander, northern goshawk, olive-sided flycatcher, little willow flycatcher, Siskiyou gazelle beetle, and Pacific fisher.

50|$|Paridera is a Spanish {{word that}} in sheep {{husbandry}} {{refers to the}} lambing season. It also refers to buildings intended {{for the care of}} ewes and goats. In Spain, there are such buildings from the 17th through 19th centuries that have been converted into houses or hotels. Other abandoned Parideras in some areas are protected by law as refuge for <b>animals</b> <b>species.</b>|$|R

5|$|French Guianan cuisine or Guianan cuisine is a {{blend of}} the {{different}} cultures that have settled in French Guiana. Creole and Chinese restaurants are common in major cities such as Cayenne, Kourou and Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni. Many indigenous <b>animal</b> <b>species</b> such as caiman and tapir are used in spiced stews.|$|E
5|$|Guinea pigs also {{practice}} alloparental care, {{in which}} a female may adopt the pup or pups of another. This might take place if the original parents die or are for some reason separated from them. This behavior is common, and is seen in many other <b>animal</b> <b>species</b> such as the elephant.|$|E
5|$|Killer {{whales are}} highly social; some populations are {{composed}} of matrilineal family groups (pods) which are the most stable of any <b>animal</b> <b>species.</b> Their sophisticated hunting techniques and vocal behaviours, which are often specific to a particular group and passed across generations, {{have been described as}} manifestations of animal culture.|$|E
50|$|Members of the Non-Selective Cation Channel-2 (NSCC2) Family (TC#1.A.15) {{have been}} sequenced from various yeast, fungal and <b>animals</b> <b>species</b> {{including}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Drosophila melanogaster and Homo sapiens. These proteins are the Sec62 proteins, {{believed to be}} associated with the Sec61 and Sec63 constituents of the general protein secretory systems of yeast microsomes. They are also the non-selective (NS) cation channels of the mammalian cytoplasmic membrane.|$|R
50|$|Certifications {{exist for}} dog, cat, parrot, and horse {{behavior}} consultants, but clients can hire behavior consultants {{to work with}} any species. It is generally recommended that potential clients hire a consultant with experience in their <b>animal’s</b> <b>species.</b> Experience is necessary because applied behavior analysis requires knowledge of typical behaviors in the species, how to observe and interpret body language, {{and the best way}} to reinforce desired behaviors.|$|R

5|$|Like other catarrhine primates, Saadanius was {{probably}} a tree-dweller (arboreal). During the time it would have lived, the Red Sea had not yet formed, and new plant and <b>animal</b> <b>species</b> would have been arriving from nearby Eurasia as it converged with the Afro-Arabian landmass.|$|E
5|$|Plant species often {{hybridize}} {{more readily}} than <b>animal</b> <b>species,</b> and the resulting hybrids are fertile more often. Many plant species {{are the result of}} hybridization, combined with polyploidy, which duplicates the chromosomes. Chromosome duplication allows orderly meiosis and so viable seed can be produced.|$|E

50|$|Haematopinus is a genus {{of insects}} in the {{suborder}} Anoplura, the sucking lice. It {{is the only}} genus in the family Haematopinidae, known commonly as the ungulate lice. All known species are of importance in veterinary medicine.

50|$|The Florida Keys have {{distinctive}} {{plant and}} <b>animals</b> <b>species,</b> some found {{nowhere else in}} the United States, as the Keys define the northern extent of their ranges. The climate also allows many imported plants to thrive. Nearly any houseplant known to commerce, and most landscape plants of the South, can thrive in the Keys climate. Some exotic species which arrived as landscape plants now invade and threaten natural areas.|$|R
50|$|In ethology, {{territory}} is the sociographical area that an animal {{of a particular}} species consistently defends against conspecifics (or, occasionally, <b>animals</b> of other <b>species).</b> <b>Animals</b> that defend territories in this way {{are referred to as}} territorial.|$|R
