The outbreak, at the time, was the deadliest {{in the era of}} modern NEXRAD doppler radar, which was fully implemented in 1997. The event was the second deadliest in February since 1950 behind the February 1971 Mississippi Valley tornado outbreak, which killed 123, the deadliest outbreak in both Tennessee and Kentucky since the 1974 Super Outbreak, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> the time the deadliest tornado outbreak in the US overall since the 1985 United States–Canada tornado outbreak which killed 90 people. This record would not be surpassed until the 2011 Super Outbreak which killed 324 people. Damage from tornadoes was estimated at over $500 million (2008 USD).|$|E
5|$|After his father's death, Braose {{continued}} to serve Edward. He contributed both money and personal military service in Edward's wars in Wales, Scotland, and France. He saw service in Gascony in 1294. In 1297 he {{took part in}} a military campaign in Flanders. As a reward for his service in Flanders, he received the wardship of John de Mowbray, who Braose eventually married to his daughter Aline. From 1298 to 1306 he was involved in the Scottish wars, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> the Battle of Falkirk on 22 July 1298. Besides the military service, he served the king in 1301 by signing a letter from the leading barons of England to Pope Boniface VIII in which the barons decried papal interference in the royal rights of England.|$|E

5|$|An online {{petition}} {{was formed}} {{in response to the}} concerns raised about the planned mosque, calling on the Prime Minister to prevent the building of the mosque; the petition closed with over 250,000 signatures <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> the time the most signed petition on the site. Her Majesty's Government responded that the local planning authorities are responsible for general control of development in their areas and are required to take into consideration the views of interested persons and particularly local communities. In regard to this specific proposal, the government was informed by the Newham London Borough Council that there is neither a current planning permission or application for a mosque, nor is one expected in the near future. In September 2012, a planning application was submitted to Newham Council and is under consideration by them.|$|E
5|$|Between 1939 and 1945, {{there were}} many plans to assassinate Hitler, some of which {{proceeded}} to significant degrees. The most well known, the 20 July plot, came from within Germany <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> least partly driven by the increasing prospect of a German defeat in the war. In July 1944, in the 20 July plot, part of Operation Valkyrie, Claus von Stauffenberg planted a bomb in one of Hitler's headquarters, the Wolf's Lair at Rastenburg. Hitler narrowly survived because staff officer Heinz Brandt moved the briefcase containing the bomb behind a leg of the heavy conference table, which deflected much of the blast. Later, Hitler ordered savage reprisals resulting in the execution of more than 4,900people.|$|E
5|$|Between its {{beginning}} and the Beijing Olympics, the United States Virgin Islands have participated in fifteen Olympics games, including five Winter Olympics. Of the ten Summer Olympic games, the Virgin Islands have sent a delegation for every game since the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City excluding the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. The first women in the team participated at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montréal, and the delegation has included women ever since, peaking at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. The size of its summer Olympic team was largest between 1972 (16 athletes) and 1992 (25 athletes), <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> its all-time largest in the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles when 29 athletes competed for the country.

He was interviewed eight times over the first two days, and with a lawyer present four times on the third.

5|$|Coal {{measures}} {{occur on}} the western and the eastern fringes of the Peak District, and evidence of past workings can be found from Glossop down to The Roaches, and from Stocksbridge to Baslow. The Coal measures on the eastern fringes of the Peak District form the South Yorkshire Coalfield while the Coal measures on the western fringes form the Lancashire Coalfield. Mining started in medieval times <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> its most productive in the 18th and early 19th centuries, in some cases continuing into the early 20th century. The earliest mining took place at and close to outcrops and miners eventually followed the seams deeper underground as the beds dipped beneath hillsides. At Goyt's Moss and Axe Edge, deep seams were worked and steam engines raised the coal and dewatered the mines. Coal from the eastern mines was used in lead smelting, and coal from the western mines for lime burning.|$|E
5|$|Deddington Castle {{was built}} by Bishop Odo of Bayeux {{in the village of}} Deddington, shortly after the Norman conquest of England in 1066. Deddington was then one of the largest {{settlements}} in the county of Oxfordshire, and the site of the castle had been previously occupied by the Anglo-Saxons, who may have used the location to administer one of their landed estates. Odo was the half-brother of William the Conqueror, who granted the bishop vast lands in England after the invasion, spread across 22 different counties. Deddington was one of the richest of Odo's new manors <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> the centre of his Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire estates. The castle was probably built to act as the caput, or administrative centre, of his lands in the region, and may have also been intended to quarter a large military force {{in the event of an}} Anglo-Saxon revolt.|$|E

5|$|Deptford Dockyard was {{established}} in 1513 by Henry VIII as the first Royal Dockyard, building vessels for the Royal Navy, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> one time known as the King's Yard. It was shut down from 1830 to 1844 before being closed as a dockyard in 1869, and is currently known as Convoys Wharf. From 1871 until the First World War it was the City of London Corporation's Foreign Cattle Market. In 1912 The Times reported that over 4 million head of live cattle, and sheep, had been landed.|$|E

5|$|He faced {{a similar}} {{challenge}} with the impoverished bishopric of Argyll in the 1240s. He {{was given the}} job of restoring {{the viability of the}} diocese and installing a new bishop; this involved forming a close relationship with King Alexander II of Scotland. Clement was with the king during his campaign in Argyll in 1249 <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> his side when he died during this campaign. In 1250 Clement had been able to install a new bishop in Argyll and had become one of the Guardians appointed to govern Scotland during the minority of King Alexander III. By 1250 he had established {{a reputation as one of}} the most active Dominican reformers in Britain. Clement helped to elevate Edmund of Abingdon and Queen Margaret to sainthood. After his death, he received veneration as a saint himself, although he was never formally canonised.|$|E

5|$|In 1157, Shaizar was {{destroyed}} by an earthquake, killing almost all of Usama's relatives. They were there for the circumcision of the son of his cousin Muhammad, who had recently succeeded Sultan as emir. The only survivor was Muhammad's wife. Usama had remained in Damascus, and after the destruction of his homeland he remained there in semi-retirement. He went on pilgrimage to Mecca in 1160, then went on campaign against the crusaders with Nur ad-Din in 1162, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> the Battle of Harim in 1164. That year, Usama left Nur ad-Din's service and went north {{to the court of}} Kara Arslan, the Artuqid emir of Hisn Kayfa.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, Hess {{enrolled}} in the University of Munich, where he studied geopolitics under Karl Haushofer, a proponent {{of the concept of}} Lebensraum ("living space"), which later became one of the pillars of Nazi Party (National Socialist German Workers Party; NSDAP) ideology. Hess joined the NSDAP on 1 July 1920, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> Hitler's side on 8 November 1923 for the Beer Hall Putsch, a failed Nazi attempt to seize control of the government of Bavaria. Whilst serving time in jail for this attempted coup, Hess helped Hitler write his book, Mein Kampf, which became a foundation of the political platform of the NSDAP.|$|E
5|$|In 1938, Royal Oak {{returned}} to the Home Fleet and was made flagship of the Second Battle Squadron based in Portsmouth. On 24 November 1938, she returned {{the body of the}} British-born Queen Maud of Norway, who had died in London, to a state funeral in Oslo, accompanied by her husband King Haakon VII. Paying off in December 1938, Royal Oak was recommissioned the following June, and in the late summer of 1939 embarked on a short training cruise in the English Channel in preparation for another 30-month tour of the Mediterranean, for which her crew were issued tropical uniforms. As hostilities loomed, the battleship was instead dispatched north to Scapa Flow, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> anchor there when war was declared on 3 September.|$|E

5|$|In {{his later}} years, {{independent}} Vermont continued to experience rapid population growth, and Allen sold {{a great deal}} of his land, but also reinvested much the proceeds in more land.
