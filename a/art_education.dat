40|$|The {{purpose of}} this qualitative, multi-site case {{study was to examine}} how the {{introduction}} of California’s Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) contributed to a change in <b>arts</b> <b>education</b> at the district level at two Los Angeles County school districts that included <b>arts</b> <b>education</b> in their Local Control and Accountability Plans (LCAP). In addition, this study sought to understand the factors that contributed to the inclusion of <b>arts</b> <b>education</b> in the districts’ LCAP as well as understanding how <b>arts</b> <b>education</b> teachers experienced changes to their work. 	The findings of this study are based on document analysis, 150 <b>arts</b> <b>education</b> teacher questionnaire responses, and interviews with six district-level decision-makers and 24 <b>arts</b> <b>education</b> teachers. This study found that <b>arts</b> <b>education</b> teachers at both research sites, California Redwood School District and Golden Poppy School District, believed that LCFF implementation had positively impact <b>arts</b> <b>education</b> at the district level and that their respective districts had increased their support of <b>arts</b> <b>education</b> as a result of LCFF. <b>Arts</b> <b>education</b> teachers largely credited district leadership and LCFF for increased support in the form of additional <b>arts</b> <b>education</b> teachers and funding available for supplies and resources. However, the school-level findings varied greatly between the two sites. <b>Arts</b> <b>education</b> teachers at California Redwood perceived less of an impact on <b>arts</b> <b>education</b> programs at the school-level when compared to the district-level, whereas Golden Poppy <b>arts</b> <b>education</b> teachers maintained a positive perception of LCFF. In particular, <b>arts</b> <b>education</b> teachers within California Redwood expressed strong skepticism about the level of support for <b>arts</b> <b>education</b> among school site instructional leaders, whereas Golden Poppy teachers did not share this sentiment. The findings suggest a need to improve communication between district-level personnel and <b>arts</b> <b>education</b> teachers so that each district can clearly communicate LCFF goals to all stakeholders within each district and positively impact <b>arts</b> <b>education</b> access for their students...|$|R

5|$|Scottish art in {{the nineteenth}} century is the body of visual art made in Scotland, by Scots, or about {{scottish}} subjects. This period saw the increasing professionalisation and organisation of art in Scotland. Major institutions founded in this period included the Institution for the Encouragement of the Fine Arts in Scotland, the Royal Scottish Academy of Art, the National Gallery of Scotland, the Scottish National Portrait Gallery and the Glasgow Institute. <b>Art</b> <b>education</b> in Edinburgh focused on the Trustees Drawing Academy of Edinburgh.

5|$|In 1920, {{while still}} {{attending}} high school, Cooper took three art courses at Montana Agricultural College in Bozeman. His interest in art was inspired years earlier by the Western paintings of Charles Marion Russell and Frederic Remington. Cooper especially admired and studied Russell's Lewis and Clark Meeting Indians at Ross' Hole (1910), which still {{hangs in the}} state capitol building in Helena. In 1922, Cooper enrolled in Grinnell College in Iowa to continue his <b>art</b> <b>education.</b> Cooper did well academically in most of his courses, but was not accepted to the school's drama club. His drawings and watercolors were exhibited throughout the dormitory, and he was named art editor for the college yearbook. During the summers of 1922 and 1923, Cooper worked at Yellowstone National Park as a tour guide driving the yellow open-top buses. Despite a promising first eighteen months at Grinnell, he left college suddenly in February 1924, spent a month in Chicago looking for work as an artist, {{and then returned to}} Helena, where he sold editorial cartoons to the Independent, a local newspaper.|$|E
5|$|The Indianapolis Museum of Art {{was founded}} as the Art Association of Indianapolis, an open-membership {{group led by}} the suffragist May Wright Sewall. Formed in 1883, the {{organization}} aimed {{to inform the public}} about visual art and provide <b>art</b> <b>education.</b> The Art Association's first exhibition, which opened November 7, 1883, contained 453 artworks from 137 artists. The death of wealthy Indianapolis resident John Herron in 1895 left a substantial bequest with the stipulation that the money be used for a gallery and a school with his name. The John Herron Art Institute opened in 1902 at the corner of 16th and Pennsylvania street. Emphasis on the Arts and Crafts movement grew throughout {{the early years of the}} school, with a focus on applied art. William Henry Fox was hired in 1905 as the Art Institute's first director. From 1905 to 1910, Fox managed both the museum and the school while constructing two new buildings on the 16th street site.|$|E
5|$|The Master Institute of United Arts {{came into}} being in 1920 as the Master School of United Arts.

Horch's wife, Nettie Horch, was a friend of Frances Grant who directed the Master School for the Roeriches. Nettie and Louis were patrons of the arts and ardent believers in <b>art</b> <b>education</b> as an indirect means of promoting harmony among the peoples of the world. They were attracted to the spiritual quest in which the Roeriches were engaged and participated in sessions during which Helena Roerich would receive instructions from Master Morya (or other esoteric beings) and Nicholas Roerich would record them on scrolls of paper that were later transcribed into a series of texts, the Leaves of Morya's Garden. Their teachings became the core of a spiritual and cultural movement known as Roerichism.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{examples of}} Scottish landscape painting {{are in the}} tradition of Scottish house decoration for burgesses, lairds and lords, that arose after the Reformation in the sixteenth century, partly {{as a response to the}} loss of religious patronage. Most were of heraldry, classical myths and allegory, but there were a number of painted landscape scenes. These included the landscapes of four seasons in the Skelmorlie Aisle (1638) in the memorial chapel of the Montgomery family in Largs undertaken by James Stalker (fl. 1632–38). They indicate an awareness of contemporaneous Dutch landscape painting. The Flemish artist Alexander Keirincx (1600–52) was active in England and Scotland where he undertook commissions for Charles I, mainly of royal castles in Northern England and Scotland. These included one showing Seton House (1636–37) in its landscape, which is often said to be the earliest surviving painted landscape created in Scotland. The theme of house decoration with landscapes was taken up in the eighteenth century by James Norie (1684–1757), who worked beside the architect William Adam (1689–1748). Norie, with his sons James (1711–36) and Robert (d. 1766), painted the houses of the peerage with capriccios or pastiches of Italian and Dutch landscapes, bringing to Scotland the influence of French artists such as Claude Lorrain and Nicolas Poussin. The Nories were also important figures in professionalisation of Scottish art and the development of <b>art</b> <b>education.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{shift in}} attitudes to a romantic {{view of the}} Highlands {{at the end of}} the 18th century had a major impact on Scottish art. Romantic depictions can be seen in the work of 18th-century artists {{including}} Jacob More, and Alexander Runciman. and the next generation of artists, including the portraits of Henry Raeburn (1756–1823), and the landscapes of Alexander Nasmyth (1758–1840) and John Knox (1778–1845). The Royal Scottish Academy of Art was created in 1826, allowing professional painters to more easily exhibit and sell their works. Andrew Geddes (1783–1844) and David Wilkie (1785–1841) were among the most successful portrait painters. The tradition of highland landscape painting was continued by figures such as Horatio McCulloch (1806–67), Joseph Farquharson (1846–1935) and William McTaggart (1835–1910). Aberdeen born William Dyce (1806–64), emerged as one of the most significant figures in <b>art</b> <b>education</b> in the United Kingdom. The Glasgow School, which developed in the late 19th century, and flourished in the early 20th century, produced a distinctive blend of influences including the Celtic Revival the Arts and Crafts Movement, and Japonisme, which found favour throughout the modern art world of continental Europe and helped define the Art Nouveau style. Among the most prominent members were the loose collective of The Four: acclaimed architect Charles Rennie Mackintosh, his wife the painter and glass artist Margaret MacDonald, her sister the artist Frances, and her husband, the artist and teacher Herbert MacNair.|$|E
