25|$|By 1958, Nilsson was {{intrigued}} by emerging forms of popular music, especially rhythm and blues artists like Ray Charles. He had made early attempts at performing while he {{was working at the}} Paramount, forming a vocal duo with his friend Jerry Smith and singing close harmonies {{in the style of the}} Everly Brothers. The manager at a favorite hangout gave Nilsson a plastic ukulele, which he learned to play, and he later learned to play the guitar and piano. In the 2006 documentary Who Is Harry Nilsson (<b>And</b> <b>Why</b> <b>Is</b> Everybody Talkin' About Him)?, Nilsson recalled that when he could not remember lyrics or parts of the melodies to popular songs, he created his own, which led to writing original songs.|$|E

500|$|The critics {{gave the}} work a {{generally}} kinder reception in London, where The Times called Puccini [...] "a master {{in the art}} of poignant expression", and praised the [...] "wonderful skill and sustained power" [...] of the music. In The Musical Times, Puccini's score was admired for its sincerity and [...] "strength of utterance." [...] After the 1903 Paris opening, the composer Paul Dukas thought the work lacked cohesion and style, while Gabriel Fauré was offended by [...] "disconcerting vulgarities". In the 1950s, the young musicologist Joseph Kerman described Tosca as a [...] "shabby little shocker."; in response the conductor Thomas Beecham remarked that anything Kerman says about Puccini [...] "can safely be ignored". Writing half a century after the premiere, the veteran critic Ernest Newman, while acknowledging the [...] "enormously difficult business of boiling [...] play down for operatic purposes", thought that the subtleties of Sardou's original plot are handled [...] "very lamely", so that [...] "much of what happens, <b>and</b> <b>why,</b> <b>is</b> unintelligible to the spectator". Overall, however, Newman delivered a more positive judgement: [...] " [...] operas are to some extent a mere bundle of tricks, but no one else has performed the same tricks nearly as well". Opera scholar Julian Budden remarks on Puccini's [...] "inept handling of the political element", but still hails the work as [...] "a triumph of pure theatre". Music critic Charles Osborne ascribes Toscas immense popularity with audiences to the taut effectiveness of its melodramatic plot, the opportunities given to its three leading characters to shine vocally and dramatically, and the presence of two great arias in [...] "Vissi d'arte" [...] and [...] "E lucevan le stelle". The work remains popular today: according to Operabase, it ranks as fifth in the world with 540 performances given in the five seasons 2009/10 to 2013/14.|$|E

2500|$|One of Crosby's songwriting {{contributions}} to the album, [...] "What's Happening?!?!", began his penchant for writing abstract songs asking irresoluble questions, a trend that has continued throughout his career with Crosby, Stills & Nash and as a solo artist. During a 1966 interview, Crosby admitted {{that it was a}} strange song, noting [...] "It asks questions of what's going on here and who does it all belong to <b>and</b> <b>why</b> <b>is</b> it all going on. I just ask the questions because I really don't know the answers." [...] Like [...] "Eight Miles High", the song exhibits the strong influence of Indian classical music with its droning guitar and melody. [...] "What's Happening?!?!"

2500|$|The {{escarpment}} {{seen from}} below {{looks like a}} range of mountains. The Limpopo, Mpumalanga and Lesotho Drakensberg have hard erosion-resistant upper surfaces and therefore have a very rugged appearance, combining steep-sided blocks and pinnacles (giving rise to the Zulu name [...] "Barrier of up-pointed spears"). Who first gave these mountains their Afrikaans or Dutch name Drakensberg, <b>and</b> <b>why,</b> <b>is</b> unknown.). The KwaZulu-Natal – Free State Drakensberg are composed of softer rocks and therefore have a more rounded, softer appearance from below. The top of the escarpment is generally almost table-top flat and smooth, even in Lesotho. The [...] "Lesotho Mountains" [...] are formed away from the Drakensberg escarpment by erosion gulleys which turn into deep valleys which contain tributaries of the Orange River.

According to Misgav, the Iron Dome does not only shoot down missiles, it also [...] "shoots {{down some of the}} capacity of Israelis for free thought, [...] it reduces their motivation to ask themselves how and why the present 'round of escalation' has started, who escalated it? Who does it serve? <b>And</b> <b>why</b> <b>is</b> it that suddenly rockets are falling from the sky?" [...] Misgav further writes that the Iron Dome will not return peace to the residents of southern Israel nor the residents of the Gaza Strip who he claims live [...] "under siege".|$|E

2500|$|Gwen Ihnat of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode {{positive}} review, {{giving it a}} B-. While she liked the episode, she left some reservations: [...] "Ultimately, depending on what you want from your Once, “Dreamcatcher” {{was a bit of}} a let down.

(How, for instance, did Emma learn that she could capture memories in dreamcatchers? [...] <b>And</b> <b>why</b> <b>is</b> that the craft she chose now that she doesn’t need to sleep?) Maybe all those assumptions and conclusions will be eventually explained in one of those “ohhhhh, I get it now” summations a couple of episodes down the road, but maybe not. Once’s writers and creators have a tendency to play fast and loose with their storylines, knowing their audience will just kind of accept it and move on. Thus, these kinds of leaps aren’t really out of the question for them. (You can’t blame them, really. We’re already watching a show about fairy tales, for crying out loud.) But I didn’t really get “Dreamcatcher.” I’m not sure that I’m supposed to yet, and down the road I might change my mind and say, “you know, that was the episode I need to go back and watch now that I know what I know.” But for now, it just left me a little cold.

2500|$|Natural {{languages}} such as English have {{words for}} several Boolean operations, in particular conjunction (and), disjunction (or), negation (not), and implication (implies). But not {{is synonymous with}} and not. When used to combine situational assertions such as [...] "the block is on the table" [...] and [...] "cats drink milk," [...] which naively are either true or false, the meanings of these logical connectives often have the meaning of their logical counterparts. However, with descriptions of behavior such as [...] "Jim walked through the door", one starts to notice differences such as failure of commutativity, for example the conjunction of [...] "Jim opened the door" [...] with [...] "Jim walked through the door" [...] in that order is not equivalent to their conjunction in the other order, since and usually means and then in such cases. Questions can be similar: the order [...] "Is the sky blue, <b>and</b> <b>why</b> <b>is</b> the sky blue?" [...] makes more sense than the reverse order. Conjunctive commands about behavior are like behavioral assertions, as in get dressed and go to school. Disjunctive commands such love me or leave me or fish or cut bait tend to be asymmetric via the implication that one alternative is less preferable. Conjoined nouns such as tea and milk generally describe aggregation as with set union while tea or milk is a choice. However context can reverse these senses, as in your choices are coffee and tea which usually means the same as your choices are coffee or tea (alternatives). Double negation as in [...] "I don't not like milk" [...] rarely means literally [...] "I do like milk" [...] but rather conveys some sort of hedging, as though to imply {{that there is a}} third possibility. [...] "Not not P" [...] can be loosely interpreted as [...] "surely P", and although P necessarily implies [...] "not not P" [...] the converse is suspect in English, much as with intuitionistic logic. In view of the highly idiosyncratic usage of conjunctions in natural languages, Boolean algebra cannot be considered a reliable framework for interpreting them.|$|E
