Parker was not {{impressed}} with Cara's musical audition, until after her recording sessions with the film's music composer Michael Gore. Gene Anthony Ray, who plays Leroy Johnson, was also a Performing Arts student but had been expelled from the school for disruptive behavior.

5|$|The {{identities of}} several of the men were {{obscured}} in some fashion, either in shadow or, in one instance, behind a large potted palm tree. Also interviewed were psychiatrist Charles Socarides, who strongly advocated the position that homosexuality is a mental disorder, and fellow psychiatrist Irving Bieber, who shared Socarides' opinion of homosexuality as pathology. Interspersed with these interview segments was footage, described as being in the cinéma vérité style, of the inside of a gay bar along with shots of hustlers working <b>a</b> <b>street</b> <b>corner</b> and a teenager being arrested in a public sex sting.|$|E
5|$|Patricia Jones {{never made}} it to her house that evening, {{according}} to her husband. Walter Jones filed a missing persons report with police the next day and began calling people he thought might have seen his wife. He got a lead when he spoke to friends of Patricia's who carpooled to work with her. The friends told Jones that Patricia had reported receiving a phone call that day from an unnamed woman who wanted to meet with her. She had asked the carpool driver to drop her off at <b>a</b> <b>street</b> <b>corner</b> in Independence, which he had done. The occupants of the carpool had seen a woman waiting for Jones in another car at the shop but did not recognize her. They nevertheless provided a description of the unknown woman to Jones.|$|E

25|$|Doherty {{remained}} in custody at the Metropolitan Correctional Center {{and attempted to}} claim political asylum, and on 15 June 1988 the Attorney General Edwin Meese overturned an earlier ruling by the Federal Board of Immigration Appeals that Doherty could be deported to the Republic of Ireland, and ordered his deportation to Northern Ireland. In February 1989 new Attorney General Dick Thornburgh chose not to support the decision made by his predecessor, and asked lawyers for Doherty and the Immigration and Naturalization Service to submit arguments {{for a review of}} the decision and Doherty's claim for asylum. By this time Doherty's case was a cause célèbre with his sympathisers including over 130 Congressmen and a son of then President of the United States George H. W. Bush, and in 1990 <b>a</b> <b>street</b> <b>corner</b> near the Metropolitan Correctional Center was named after him.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of 27 September 1972, the MRF shot dead Catholic {{civilian}} Daniel Rooney and wounded his friend Brendan Brennan. They were shot from a passing car while standing on <b>a</b> <b>street</b> <b>corner</b> at St James's Crescent, in the Falls district. The British Army told journalists {{that the two men}} fired at an undercover patrol and that the patrol returned fire. It further claimed that the two men were IRA members. The IRA, the men's families, and residents of the area denied this, and Rooney's name has never appeared on a republican roll of honour. An inquest was held in December 1973. The court was told that forensic tests on the men's hands and clothing found no firearms residue. The six soldiers involved repeated the British Army's claim, but they did not appear at the inquest. Their statements were read by a police officer and they were referred to by initials. In 2013, former MRF member 'Simon Cursey' again claimed that they were returning fire, but said that only one of the men was armed.|$|E

25|$|In {{response}} to extensive police appeals, two eyewitnesses came forward on 6 January {{to say they}} had seen the girl at a bus station {{in the company of}} a middle-aged man. One of these individuals was able to identify this man as a former lodger of the Tinsleys. A neighbor of the Tinsley family also informed the police that she had seen this former lodger of the theirs standing alone, loitering on <b>a</b> <b>street</b> <b>corner</b> close to Mona's school, staring in the direction of the entrance to the premises on the afternoon of her abduction. Later that day, a bus conductor named Charles Reville confirmed to police that the previous day, a young girl matching Mona's description had indeed boarded his 4:45 p.m. bus from Newark to Retford {{in the company of a}} middle-aged man, and the pair had alighted his bus at Grove Street, Retford. Reville ominously added that this man had purchased a return ticket for himself, but only a single ticket for the girl. Reville's claims were independently substantiated by a passenger on the bus named Stanley Betts, who also claimed to have seen a middle-aged man travelling between Newark and Retford with a girl matching Mona's description.|$|E
25|$|An alcohol-free Springfield Saint Patrick's Day parade is {{interrupted}} by a brawl between the Nationalist Irish and the Unionist Northern Irish in which Homer participates. A group of hungry children steal Marge's picnic basket. She is saved by Patrick Farrelly, who gives the children a cabbage and returns the basket. Marge offers him a cupcake in gratitude, and Patrick immediately offers her a job at his bakery after eating it. Homer is taken to jail, because of {{his involvement in the}} riot. Due to his history of crime, Homer's bail is set incredibly high, and he is forced to get a bail bondsman named Lucky Jim to help him. Lucky Jim agrees to secure Homer's release from prison, as long as Homer does not skip his bail. Otherwise, he {{will have to deal with}} Wolf the Bounty Hunter, who quickly inspires Homer to become a bounty hunter himself. Homer's first mission involves pretending to sell condos on <b>a</b> <b>street</b> <b>corner</b> to criminals. Snake approaches Homer, who tries to take Snake down. Homer corners Snake in an alleyway, where Snake pulls out a pistol and fires a shot straight to Homer's head. Miraculously, Ned Flanders places a sheet of bulletproof glass in front of Homer, which deflects the shot. Ned attempts to convince Snake to come in quietly, unknowingly allowing Homer to sneak up behind Snake and capture him by asphyxiating him with a plastic bag. Homer convinces Ned to join him as a bounty hunting duo.|$|E

500|$|James {{grew up in}} Genoa, a small {{community}} in between Canton, Ohio and Massillon, Ohio. [...] The oldest of five children, one of his younger brothers included Don James, a Hall of Fame coach for Kent State and the University of Washington. He attended grammar school there through the eighth grade, but the town {{did not have a}} high school and students could choose to attend either Massillon Washington High School or the rival Canton McKinley High School. James at first decided to attend Canton, but Bud Houghton, an assistant coach of Massillon's football team, saw him playing in an informal scrimmage on <b>a</b> <b>street</b> <b>corner</b> and convinced him to come to Massillon. He played football there for three years under head coach Paul Brown. Playing as a back, James was part of a Massillon team that went undefeated in 1940. He scored a touchdown in a 28–0 victory over Toledo's Waite High School, the biggest game of the year; Massillon came into the matchup having won 30 games in a row, while Waite had won 18 straight.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, at the trials, Lisa {{is given}} an Olympic mascot pin. Lisa {{puts it on}} her shirt and decides it [...] "looks lonely" [...] and buys another, but her {{interest}} in them quickly spirals out of control. The Simpsons arrive in Vancouver, where Agnes insists that Homer be cut from the team. Marge insists she can compensate for his weak throws, but she injures her right shoulder while sweeping to secure a win in the semifinals. She is told that she will never curl again and that the American team must forfeit the gold-medal match to Sweden. Lisa's pin collection grows, and when she runs out of money, she trades her pearl necklace to a vendor {{in exchange for a}} pin from the 1924 Winter Olympics in Chamonix, France. Bart discovers Lisa busking on <b>a</b> <b>street</b> <b>corner,</b> having relinquished her dress in favour of wearing her pins at all times, and offers to help her kick her pin-collecting addiction.

500|$|Residents of the company-owned {{houses were}} given the option to buy the {{structures}} at bargain prices, provided they move them out of town. For many, it took a great chunk of their life savings to relocate elsewhere, taking their homes in caravans along the highways and leaving behind empty foundations. Most Elcor residents purchased lots in the surrounding communities, trying to beat land speculators. In the few months after it became official that Elcor's fate was sealed, land prices skyrocketed. Lots that had originally been priced at $75 were now being sold {{for as much as}} $500. Most of the remaining families moved a mile west to Gilbert, although other homes were replanted in nearby McKinley. The last vestiges of the old mining community were gone by 1956. Every building was torn down or removed. All that remained for some years after were old foundations, sidewalks, rusting stoves, pipes, bottles and yard shrubbery, formerly visible from the old section of Minnesota State Highway 135 between Gilbert and Biwabik. A rusted fire hydrant adorned what was once <b>a</b> <b>street</b> <b>corner,</b> and a porcelain toilet bowl remained bolted to a concrete floor. An abandoned rail line for the Duluth, Missabe and Iron Range Railway went through {{what was left of the}} town site. Mine shafts were boarded up with old timbers. After everyone had left, the company dumped heaps of iron ore on the roads leading into Elcor, and in the process a ghost town was made out of what was once a thriving community.|$|E
