5|$|A pisco sour is an {{alcoholic}} cocktail of Peruvian origin that {{is typical of}} the cuisines from Chile and Peru, considered also a South American classic. The drink's name comes from pisco, which is its base liquor, and the cocktail term sour, in reference to sour citrus juice and sweetener components. The Peruvian pisco sour uses Peruvian pisco as the base liquor and adds freshly squeezed lime juice, syrup, ice, egg white, and <b>Angostura</b> bitters. The Chilean version is similar, but uses Chilean pisco and pica lime, and excludes the bitters and egg white. Other variants of the cocktail include those created with fruits like pineapple or plants such as coca leaves.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{preparation}} of pisco-based mixed beverages possibly {{dates back to the}} 1700s, historians and drink experts agree that the cocktail as it is known today was invented in the early 1920s in Lima, the capital of Peru, by the American bartender Victor Vaughen Morris. Morris left the United States in 1903 to work in Cerro de Pasco, a city in central Peru. In 1916, he opened Morris' Bar in Lima, and his saloon quickly became a popular spot for the Peruvian upper class and English-speaking foreigners. The pisco sour underwent several changes until Mario Bruiget, a Peruvian bartender working at Morris' Bar, created the modern Peruvian recipe of the cocktail {{in the latter part of}} the 1920s by adding <b>Angostura</b> bitters and egg whites to the mix.|$|E

In 1824, German physician Dr. Johann Gottlieb Benjamin Siegert compounded a cure for sea sickness and stomach maladies, among other medicinal uses.

40|$|In this paper, I {{examine the}} case of <b>Angosturas,</b> a {{large-scale}} gold mining project by the Canadian-based company GreyStar in the sensitive high wetland páramo of Santurbán in the northeast of the Colombian Andes. <b>Angosturas</b> is the closest large-scale gold mining project to the phase of extraction in the country, and constitutes a referent for other ongoing cases. In 2011, the Ministry of the Environment, Housing, and Territorial Development (hereafter: Ministry of the Environment) denied the environmental license to the company to start extraction operations. Despite this government’s recent ruling, GreyStar (which renamed itself ‘Eco Oro’ after the 2011 decision) and other mining companies have continued their quest to gain permission to begin extraction in the area. I explore why these continued attempts to change government policy regarding extraction licensing is possible within the existing juridical framework. In particular, I ask how Sustainable Development allows for the classification of large-scale mining as a public utility activity.

40|$|In the Strait of Magellan {{and in the}} {{adjacent}} Pacific and Atlantic Ocean shelf tintinnids were studied during three oceanographic cruises (November 1989, March–April 1991, and April 1995).

As a general rule, abundances were higher at the surface and in the Atlantic sector. A total of 47 tintinnid species were found. There was not a single species, which could be identified as indicator of a specific water mass. For each cruise, cluster analysis applied on a species/samples matrix identified station sets characterized by a specific tintinnid association. <b>Angosturas</b> entrance was characterized by agglutinated lorica tintinnids, typical of the Atlantic waters, while the Pacific sector by hyaline species.
