6000|$|When Aqua fortis dissolves Silver and not Gold, and Aqua regia dissolves Gold and not Silver, may {{it not be}} {{said that}} Aqua fortis is subtil enough to {{penetrate}} Gold as well as Silver, but wants the attractive Force to give it Entrance; and that Aqua regia is subtil enough to penetrate Silver as well as Gold, but wants the attractive Force to give it Entrance? For Aqua regia is nothing else than Aqua fortis mix'd with some Spirit of Salt, or with Sal-armoniac; and even common Salt dissolved in Aqua fortis, enables the Menstruum to dissolve Gold, though the Salt be a gross Body. When therefore Spirit of Salt precipitates Silver out of Aqua fortis, is it not done by attracting and mixing with the Aqua fortis, and not attracting, or perhaps repelling Silver? And when Water precipitates Antimony out of the Sublimate of Antimony and Sal-armoniac, or out of Butter of Antimony, is it not done by its dissolving, mixing with, and weakening the Sal-armoniac or Spirit of Salt, <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>not</b> attracting, or perhaps repelling the Antimony? And is it not for want of an attractive virtue between the Parts of Water and Oil, of Quick-silver and Antimony, of Lead and Iron, that these Substances do not mix; and by a weak Attraction, that Quick-silver and Copper mix difficultly; and from a strong one, that Quick-silver and Tin, Antimony and Iron, Water and Salts, mix readily? And in general, is it not from the same Principle that Heat congregates homogeneal Bodies, and separates heterogeneal ones? ...|$|E
60|$|Miriam brought Basil Dashwood once {{to see her}} portrait, and Basil, who commended it in general, {{directed}} his criticism mainly to two points--its not yet being finished <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>not</b> having gone into that year's Academy. The young actor audibly panted; he felt the short breath of Miriam's rapidity, the quick beat of her success, and, looking at everything now {{from the standpoint of}} that speculation, could scarcely contain his impatience at the painter's clumsy slowness. He thought the latter's second attempt much better than his first, but somehow it ought by that time to be shining {{in the eye of the}} public. He put it to their friend with an air of acuteness--he had those felicities--that in every great crisis there is nothing like striking while the iron is hot. He even betrayed the conviction that by putting on a spurt Nick might wind up the job and still get the Academy people to take him in. Basil knew some of them; he all but offered to speak to them--the case was so exceptional; he had no doubt he could get something done. Against the appropriation of the work by Peter Sherringham he explicitly and loudly protested, in spite of the homeliest recommendations of silence from Miriam; and it was indeed easy to guess how such an arrangement would interfere with his own conception of the eventual right place for the two portraits--the vestibule of the theatre, where every one going in and out would see them suspended face to face and surrounded by photographs, artistically disposed, of the young actress in a variety of characters. Dashwood showed superiority in his jump to the contention that so exhibited the pictures would really help to draw. Considering the virtue he attributed to Miriam the idea was exempt from narrow prejudice.|$|E

Andrew Means of Melody Maker commented that [...] "Its not melody <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>not</b> harmony, <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>not</b> really rhythm... it is ambiguity. It is the spaced out slipstream, the rushing, gurgling torrent of weightless sound that first turns the circle of mental pictures, associations and impressions picked out from space, time and earth... The listener is as much a traveller as the musician." [...] Sounds Martin Hayman meanwhile described the music as [...] "the bass and drums batter on with unflagging pace, synthesisers swirl and whistle around the thunderous block riffs whose endless repetition generates that numbed hypnosis, tuneless and menacing voices incant largely incomprehensible lyrics. This is not to knock Hawkwind: the sound they are getting is thicker, fuller, more convincing than ever before.
