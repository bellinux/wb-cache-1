Boogaloo sets up a rumble between his gang and the Stompers. Vinnie later meets up with Roz and the girl Crazy dates, Eva; Crazy has {{meanwhile}} beaten all the mobsters. The four head out to a party, where Vinnie tells the Stompers {{that they are going}} to fight with the Chaplains, to which the gang responds negatively. Much of the gang and their girls head out to a rock and roll show. Vinnie is horrified at the idea of Crazy and himself having to fight the Chaplains alone. One of the Stompers named Sal and his girl have a run-in with Boogaloo while driving, <b>and</b> <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> in a car crash. Vinnie finally persuades the Stompers to rumble with the Chaplains.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Gary Cole's return was highly praised, {{as well as}} the scene in which Sarah imitates the face Chuck makes when the Intersect has a [...] "flash". HitFix Senior Editor Alan Sepinwall wrote, [...] "Cole's return was as much fun as I hoped it would be - in some ways, even better than his first appearance in season two's 'Chuck vs. the Delorean,' where I liked Sarah and Jack's interaction but thought the actual con job was a bit thin. 'Chuck vs. the Wedding Planner' had its own flaw in the section where Sarah and Chuck are illegally using government resources to catch the con woman <b>and</b> <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> getting more government 'help' than they bargained for... But once Jack turned up in Burbank to help his daughter and her schnook of a fiance be heroes and get back in the good graces of General Beckman, 'Wedding Planner' was really very strong, both as a comedy piece (loved Yvonne Strahovski's accent as she impersonated Daphne) and another story about Sarah's colorful but ultimately sad past." ...|$|E

However, {{he wrote that}} despite the story being [...] "a good one", he is [...] "a little tired of discovering Harry {{at home with his}} horrible aunt and uncle", the formulaic beginning of all seven books. King has also joked that [...] "Rowling's never met an adverb she did not like!" [...] He does however predict that Harry Potter [...] "will indeed stand time's test <b>and</b> <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> on a shelf where only the best are kept; I think Harry will take his place with Alice, Huck, Frodo, and Dorothy and this is one series not just for the decade, but for the ages". Sameer Rahim of The Daily Telegraph disagreed, saying [...] "It depresses me to see 16 and 17 year-olds reading the series when they could be reading the great novels of childhood such as Oliver Twist or A House for Mr Biswas. What that says about the adults who are fanatical fans I’m not sure – but I suspect in years to come people will make a link between our plump, comfortable, infantilising society and the popularity of Potter." ...|$|E

It just got so overloaded; it was nuts. So he was smart enough to peel it all back, and he held voices back to the bridge, me at the top end, Carl in the middle and Brian on the bottom. At that point, Brian's right move was to get subtler. He had a very tender track here. 'God Only Knows' is a very small masterpiece with a major heartbeat, and he was right to peel everybody back <b>and</b> <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> with the three parts.
