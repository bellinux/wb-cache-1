Slavery was a very important topic at the time, because that first state constitution only permitted current practices using slave labor in the salines (salt evaporation factories) through 1825. A proslavery faction had hoped to eliminate the first constitution's anti-slavery clause and transform Illinois into a slave state like Missouri. Coles’ bold call for an end to slavery stiffened their resolve and led to a rancorous legislative effort which began with the Shaw-Hansen Affair (concerning whether to seat a pro-slavery candidate backed by voters who came from Missouri, or his anti-slavery opponent). Governor Edward Coles led the opposition to a bill approving a referendum to hold another constitutional convention, recognizing it as a dishonest attempt to more clearly legalize slavery in the state. After the bill passed, Coles committed his total pay as governor ($4000) to defeat the referendum, and led a committee of anti-slavery citizens, religious leaders, and legislators (who committed another $1000). The aristocratic, awkward Virginian and his allies then dispelled a plethora of false economic arguments spread by slavery proponents, while {{in the aftermath of the}} Panic of 1819 keeping secret their printing help from much-reviled Philadelphians (Nicholas Biddle and Roberts Vaux).

To create more urban development, and <b>to</b> <b>aid</b> <b>agriculture,</b> many products need to be processed, refined, or constructed.

For the wide range of products that have been created and refined in this anthropological age, there is a plethora of substances that are harvested. Many of these materials are non-renewable (e.g. fossil fuel, metal ores, etc.) and the harvest of these results in relatively permanent anthropization. For resources that are depended on in high quantity, this can also mean temporary depletion or damage to the source of the resource (e.g. depletion or pollution of fresh water reserves, improper or inefficient silviculture, etc.). Even sustainable or renewable industrial anthropization still affects the environment.

40|$|The paper makes {{a review}} of the {{agricultural}} risks management systems in Europe (EU 27) with a special focus on agricultural insurances. The different types of agricultural insurance systems existing in Europe and key figures in each country are discussed. The relationship between Government involvement and insurance development is highlighted. Usually, private companies insure only hail and fire, but as the government involvement in insurance increases, more comprehensive coverage is provided by the insurance system, becoming possible the insuring of agricultural systemic risks. Ex-post <b>aid</b> <b>to</b> disasters in <b>agriculture</b> is given on an ad-hoc basis or through compensation schemes or calamity funds, which can be partially financed by the agricultural sector on a voluntary or compulsory basis. Payments ad-hoc and from calamity funds in most European countries are summarised and their levels are compared. The existing insurance level is generally insufficient to smooth significant income reduction in bad years. Risk management tools available in the MS could be developed further. However, given the heterogeneous situation, the interest of a harmonised EU-wide system of agricultural insurances is debatable. Other alternatives could be considered, such as facilitating/subsidizing the composition of yield/income databases at a detailed level (farm); promoting public reinsurance; clarifying/homogenizing the legal framework; partially subsidizing national systems which are within the framework.
