5|$|Unlike most {{livestock}} farming in England at this time, the duck breeders and duck rearers of Aylesbury formed two separate groups. Stock ducks—i.e., ducks kept for breeding—were kept on {{farms in the}} countryside of the Aylesbury Vale, away from the polluted air and water of the town. This kept the ducks healthy, and meant <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>number</b> of fertile eggs.|$|E

5|$|Most {{men have}} a normal sperm count, but a high {{proportion}} of sperm are abnormal; they are less motile and do not survive as well. The reason for these abnormalities is not known, but research points to dysfunction of the seminal vesicles and prostate, which concentrate substances that are toxic to sperm. Cytokines, immune proteins which promote an inflammatory response, are present at higher concentrations in semen of men with SCI, as is platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase; both are harmful to sperm. Another immune-related response to SCI is the presence of <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>number</b> of white blood cells in the semen.|$|E
5|$|Wild {{populations of}} Caprellamutica show <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>number</b> of females than males. This {{may be related}} to the fact that females are aggressively defended by males from {{competing}} males, resulting in high male mortality. The larger sizes and greater visibility of males also make them more vulnerable targets for predators that rely on eyesight like fish. C.mutica are r-strategists. They reproduce all throughout the year, with peak seasons in the summer (March to July).|$|E

5|$|In January and February 2015, 1450 {{malnourished}} or sick {{sea lion}} pups {{have been found}} {{on the coast of}} California, and estimations give <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>number</b> of dead pups. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has pointed the cause to unprecedentedly warm PDO in the North American west coast {{as a result of a}} failed attempt at El Niño, which has reduced the abundance of anchovies, sardines and mackerel, principal components of the sea lion diet just in the pups nursery season. Pups are leaving the rookeries in search of food long before they are capable of hunting fish. The outcome is pups really malnourished washed out on the shores. These conditions lead some of these pups to death if not rescued in time.|$|E

It returned later in the night with 3.59m. The episode of The X Factor broadcast between the two episodes received <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>number</b> of viewers, attracting 8.08m. The second set of episodes, broadcast the week after, saw a small rise in viewers with 3.42m for the first episode, and 3.70m for the second. In the third week, it got 3.30m for the first episode and 3.06m for the second. Week four brought in 3.17m for the first episode and 3.63m for the second. 3.29m people tuned in for week five's first episode and 3.25m for the second episode. Week six produced 3.39m for the first episode and 3.23m for the second. The final set of shows produced 3.23m and 2.84m viewers for the first and second episodes, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Since moulds {{have been}} {{expensive}} to manufacture, they were usually only used in mass production {{where thousands of}} parts were being produced. Typical moulds are constructed from hardened steel, pre-hardened steel, aluminium, and/or beryllium-copper alloy. The choice of material to build a mould from is primarily one of economics; in general, steel moulds cost more to construct, but their longer lifespan will offset the higher initial cost over <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>number</b> of parts made before wearing out. Pre-hardened steel moulds are less wear-resistant and are used for lower volume requirements or larger components; their typical steel hardness is 38–45 on the Rockwell-C scale. Hardened steel moulds are heat treated after machining; these are by far superior in terms of wear resistance and lifespan. Typical hardness ranges between 50 and 60 Rockwell-C (HRC). Aluminium moulds can cost substantially less, and when designed and machined with modern computerised equipment can be economical for moulding tens or even {{hundreds of thousands of}} parts. Beryllium copper is used in areas of the mould that require fast heat removal or areas that see the most shear heat generated. The moulds can be manufactured either by CNC machining or by using electrical discharge machining processes.|$|E

5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of dengue is typically made clinically, {{on the basis}} of reported symptoms and physical examination; this applies especially in endemic areas. However, early disease can be difficult to differentiate from other viral infections. A probable diagnosis is based on the findings of fever plus two of the following: nausea and vomiting, rash, generalized pains, low white blood cell count, positive tourniquet test, or any warning sign (see table) in someone who lives in an endemic area. Warning signs typically occur before the onset of severe dengue. The tourniquet test, which is particularly useful in settings where no laboratory investigations are readily available, involves the application of a blood pressure cuff at between the diastolic and systolic pressure for five minutes, followed by the counting of any petechial hemorrhages; <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>number</b> makes a {{diagnosis of}} dengue more likely with the cut off being more than 10 to 20 per 1inch2 (6.25cm2).|$|E
