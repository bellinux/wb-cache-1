5|$|Albatrosses, {{along with}} all Procellariiformes, must excrete the salts they ingest in {{drinking}} sea water and eating marine invertebrates. All birds have an enlarged nasal gland {{at the base of}} the bill, above their eyes. This gland is inactive in species that do not require it, but in the Procellariiformes it acts as a salt gland. Scientists <b>are</b> <b>uncertain</b> as to its exact processes, but do know in general terms that it removes salt by secreting a 5% saline solution that drips out of their nose or is forcibly ejected.|$|E

5|$|Although {{assault by}} the heavily armed sloop HMS Dart proved successful, the fireships {{achieved}} little {{and various other}} British craft involved in the operation {{had little effect on}} the eventual outcome.

Although all three frigates were refloated and returned to service, the operation had cost the French heavy casualties. The British force suffered minimal losses, although the exact totals <b>are</b> <b>uncertain.</b> Many of the British officers involved were highly praised and rewarded with promotions and prize money.|$|E

5|$|From about 10,000 BCE, Paleo-Indians {{and later}} Archaic-Indians lived as {{communities}} of hunter-gatherers {{in the area}} that covers the modern day southern United States. Approximately 800 CE to 1600 CE, the Mississippi River Delta was populated by tribes of the Mississippian culture, a mound-building Native American people that had developed in the late Woodland Indian period. The Tipton Phase people were a local expression of the Mississippian culture. They inhabited the region of modern-day Tipton County during the time of first contact with Europeans, at the arrival of the de Soto Expedition. By the end of the Mississippian period the land was claimed and populated by the Chickasaw tribe.
