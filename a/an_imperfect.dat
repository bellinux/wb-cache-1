5|$|Applying the {{categorical}} imperative, duties arise because {{failure to}} fulfil them would either {{result in a}} contradiction in conception or in a contradiction in the will. The former are classified as perfect duties, the latter as imperfect. A perfect duty always holds true—there is a perfect duty to tell the truth, so we must never lie. <b>An</b> <b>imperfect</b> duty allows flexibility—beneficence is <b>an</b> <b>imperfect</b> duty {{because we are not}} obliged to be completely beneficent at all times, but may choose the times and places in which we are. Kant believed that perfect duties are more important than imperfect duties: if a conflict between duties arises, the perfect duty must be followed.|$|E

5|$|The {{life cycle}} of Urnula craterium allows for both <b>an</b> <b>imperfect</b> (making asexual spores, or conidia) or perfect (making sexual spores) form; as has often {{happened}} in fungal taxonomy, the imperfect form was given a different name, because {{the relationship between the}} perfect and imperfect forms of the same species was not then known. The imperfect stage of Urnula craterium is the plant pathogenic species Conoplea globosa, known to cause a canker disease (Strumella canker) of oak and several other hardwoods.|$|E
5|$|The {{song was}} {{released}} as the album's third single to contemporary hit/Top 40, rhythmic contemporary, and urban contemporary {{radio stations in}} the United States on November 1, 2009. Carey revealed that she intended to re-release Memoirs of <b>an</b> <b>Imperfect</b> Angel as a remix album in early 2010, titled Angels Advocate, consisting of remixes of the standard songs with new featured artists, including Mary J. Blige, Snoop Dogg, Trey Songz, R. Kelly, T-Pain, Gucci Mane, and OJ da Juiceman.|$|E
5|$|During {{this period}} Gaudí was {{inspired}} above all by mediaeval Gothic art, {{but wanted to}} improve on its structural solutions. Neo-gothic {{was one of the}} most successful historicist styles at that time, above all as a result of the theoretical studies of Viollet-le-Duc. Gaudí studied examples in Catalonia, the Balearic Islands and Roussillon in depth, as well as Leonese and Castillian buildings during his stays in León and Burgos, and became convinced that it was <b>an</b> <b>imperfect</b> style, leaving major structural issues only partly resolved. In his works he eliminated the need of buttresses through the use of ruled surfaces, and abolished crenellations and excessive openwork.|$|E

5|$|Leotia lubrica is {{the type}} species of the genus Leotia. It has been {{hypothesised}} that the species has {{a close relationship with}} L.atrovirens; mycologist Geoffrey Kibby suggested that greenish color of L.atrovirens may be due to infection by <b>an</b> <b>imperfect</b> fungus on L.lubrica, while David Arora proposed that the two species may intergrade. In 2004, results of phylogenetic analysis suggested that L.lubrica, L.atrovirens and L.viscosa, while morphologically well-defined, were not monophyletic. L.lubrica specimens could be split into at least two different groups, one of which also contained specimens of L.viscosa. These groups could be differentiated morphologically by the colour of the stalk when dried. The most basal was shown to be L.atrovirens.|$|E
5|$|Sarcoscypha dudleyi, {{commonly}} known as the crimson cup or the scarlet cup, is a species of fungus in the Sarcoscyphaceae family of the Pezizales order. In addition to its main distribution in the central to eastern United States, the fungus has also been recorded once in Bulgaria. It has been frequently confused with Sarcoscypha coccinea, but can be distinguished from this and other related species in Sarcoscypha by differences in microscopic characteristics, such as the presence and number of oil droplets in the spores. The species Molliardiomyces dudleyi is <b>an</b> <b>imperfect</b> form of the fungus that lacks a sexually reproductive stage in its life cycle.|$|E
5|$|Because of the tour's cancellation, various {{media outlets}} {{circulated}} speculation that Carey had become pregnant, and had abandoned her {{plans for a}} tour as a result. Many reports were made claiming that Carey had been visiting a famed gynecologist's office in Los Angeles. Carey did not address those rumours until two years later on October 28, 2010, which was the same day she announced her new pregnancy; she admitted that she had indeed been pregnant during that time period in late 2008, and suffered a miscarriage. For that reason, she cancelled the tour, and lost the child only two months later. Carey later opted to record a new album, that would be released {{during the summer of}} 2009. During the later stages of the project, Carey released the title, Memoirs of <b>an</b> <b>Imperfect</b> Angel, that would serve as the singer's twelfth studio album.|$|E

40|$|Experimental {{investigations}} {{were carried}} out on the nonlinear dynamic response of <b>a</b> clamped-clamped geometrically <b>imperfect</b> magneto-rheological elastomer (MRE) sandwich beam with a concentrated mass at the centre when loaded with a point excitation. Experiments have been conducted for: (i) <b>a</b> geometrically <b>imperfect</b> aluminium beam; (ii) <b>a</b> geometrically <b>imperfect</b> MRE sandwich beam {{in the absence of}} a magnetic field; (iii) <b>a</b> geometrically <b>imperfect</b> MRE sandwich beam in the presence of a magnetic field; (iv) a MRE sandwich beam with different geometric imperfection amplitudes. An electrodynamic shaker excited each system and the corresponding displacement of the concentrated mass was measured; an array of magnets has been used to investigate the effects of changing magnetic field strength on the nonlinear dynamic response of the geometrically imperfect MRE sandwich beam. It has been shown that the geometrically imperfect aluminium beam displays initial softening behaviour followed by strong hardening-type nonlinearity; with a MRE layer the motion characteristics of the geometrically imperfect sandwich beam no longer exhibits initial softening behaviour however, the MRE layer in the absence and presence of an external magnetic field all exhibit strong hardening-type nonlinearities-a significant qualitative change was observed in the nonlinear dynamical behaviour of the system...|$|R

5|$|The large orbit {{was shaped}} like <b>an</b> <b>imperfect</b> ellipse (with the longest axis {{from front to}} back), and faced {{to the side and}} {{slightly}} forward. The infratemporal fenestra (opening) behind the eye was narrow and sloped backwards, and the supratemporal fenestra on the top back of the skull was very reduced in size, due to the thickening of the frontoparietal. The basicranium (back part) of the skull was shortened and distanced from the regions below the orbits and around the palate. The occiput sloped backwards and down, and the occipital condyle was deflected in the same direction. The lacrimal bone formed the lower front margin of the orbit, and its surface had rows of node-like ornamentation. The prefrontal and palpebral bones were fused and formed a thick ridge above the orbit. The relatively large jugal bone formed the lower margin of the orbit, extending far forwards and down towards the jaw joint. It was ornamented with ridges and nodes in a radiating arrangement.|$|E

5|$|The taxonomical {{history of}} this fungus has been {{complicated}} by the fact that its life cycle allows for both <b>an</b> <b>imperfect</b> (making asexual spores, or conidia) or perfect (making sexual spores) form; at various times authors have assigned names to one or the other form, but these names have often been at odds with the accepted rules of fungal nomenclature. It was originally described in 1781 by the Dutch scientist Nikolaus Joseph von Jacquin as Lichen sarcoides. Christian Hendrik Persoon called it Peziza sarcoides in 1801. Elias Magnus Fries, in his 1822 publication Systema Mycologicum, described the imperfect state of the fungus under the name Tremella sarcoides. The genus name Coryne was first used in 1851 by Bonorden, who proposed Coryne sarcoides for the imperfect state; in 1865 the Tulasne brothers (Charles and Louis René) used Coryne to refer to both the perfect and imperfect forms. It was designated the type species for the genus in a 1931 publication by Clements and Shear.|$|E
