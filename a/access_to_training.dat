It {{occupied}} converted naval premises until a clubhouse was built, which was opened in June 2005 by the Princess Royal. £7.85 million of funding for the project was donated by charities, individuals and local councils; the National Lottery donated £3 million in 2003, and the South West Regional Development Agency added £3.34 million. The academy's aims are to promote the sport of sailing {{at all levels of}} competence and ability, through courses, training and events, and to contribute to the economic regeneration of the area. Since opening it has created a demand in service and marine industries worth around £10 million. WPNSA continues to promote sailing to local schools, offering benefits such as free boat hoist and storage. Use of the facilities and <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>training</b> is open to anyone in return for an annual membership fee. On 6 July 2005, London was chosen to host the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games, and the WPNSA was chosen to host the sailing events.|$|E

So esteemed and prolific was he in this area, that he earned the epithet “Kunisada, the Portraitist of Actors (yakusha-e no Kunisada).” The Tempō Reforms of 1842, which had banned depictions of geisha, oiran courtesans and kabuki actors, began to be gradually repealed from the late 1840s, which left Kunisada free {{to return to his}} favourite medium.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} survey of {{approaches}} for providing broadband Internet <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>trains.</b> We examine some of the barriers that hinder the use of broadband Internet on trains and then discuss some of the opportunities for broadband deployment <b>to</b> <b>trains.</b> This survey considers {{some of the basic}} concepts for providing broadband Internet access and then reviews associated network architectures. The review of network architectures shows that we can subdivide networks for providing broadband Internet <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>trains</b> into the train-based network, the access network—for connecting the <b>train</b> <b>to</b> the service provider(s) —and the aggregation network—for collecting user packets generated in the access network for transmission to the Internet. Furthermore, our review shows that the current trend is <b>to</b> provide Internet <b>access</b> <b>to</b> passengers on <b>trains</b> using IEEE 802. 11; however, a clear method for how <b>to</b> connect <b>trains</b> <b>to</b> the global Internet has yet to emerge. A summary of implementation efforts in Europe and North America serves to highlight some of the schemes that have been used thus far <b>to</b> connect <b>trains</b> <b>to</b> the Internet. We conclude by discussing some of the models developed, from a technical perspective, to test the viability of deploying Internet <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>trains.</b> i...|$|R

25|$|Nebraska {{football}} has {{a formal}} walk-on program which attracts many students {{from throughout the}} state—often from rural areas—that the Cornhuskers did not offer athletic scholarships to. The program accepted its first walk-on player in the early 1960s, and Tom Osborne began an official walk-on program in 1973 after the NCAA {{reduced the number of}} scholarships the university could offer. The size of the program means that Nebraska's rosters are unusually large; it had 141 players on the team that won the national championship at the 1996 Fiesta Bowl, while opponent Florida had 94. About 40% of the players that traveled to away games under Osborne were walk-ons. He credited them with contributing to his teams' success, by providing manpower for additional scout teams to prepare against for future opponents. Unlike those at some other schools, Nebraska's walk-ons have the same <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>training</b> facilities and academic counseling as those with scholarships. While many walk-ons never play in a game during their athletic careers, six walk-ons have become All-American players and 29 have played in the NFL. Twelve have been named Academic All-Americans.|$|E
2500|$|Kunisada {{emerged as}} a book {{illustrator}} in 1807 with the series [...] "Twelve Hours of the Courtesans" [...] (Keisei jūnitoki). Kuchi-e book illustrations were essential {{to the success of}} the then popular sharebon and kibyōshi books, and this soon became a lucrative market for Kunisada due to his talent and ambition. His position within the Utagawa studio afforded him <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>training</b> from the finest masters, and connections to publishers, actors, theatres and poet’s associations. This, in turn, led to many commissions. By the early 1810s, he had opened his own studio, and demand for his illustrations had outstripped that for his master’s. His great success was also reputedly linked to his [...] "convivial and balanced demeanor, and [...] he delivered his commissions on time.” ...|$|E
