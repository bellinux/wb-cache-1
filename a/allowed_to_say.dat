5|$|After toying {{around with}} her brother Alex's guitar, Winehouse bought her own when she was 14 and began writing music a year later. Soon after, she began working for a living, including, at one time, as an {{entertainment}} journalist for the World Entertainment News Network, in addition to singing with local group the Bolsha Band. In July 2000, she became the featured female vocalist with the National Youth Jazz Orchestra; her influences were to include Sarah Vaughan and Dinah Washington, the latter whom she was already listening to at home. Amy's best friend, soul singer Tyler James, sent her demo tape to an A person. Winehouse signed to Simon Fuller's 19 Management in 2002 and was paid £250 a week against future earnings. While being developed by the management company, she was kept as a recording industry secret although she was a regular jazz standards singer at the Cobden Club. Her future A representative at Island, Darcus Beese, heard of her by accident when the manager of The Lewinson Brothers showed him some productions of his clients, which featured Winehouse as key vocalist. When he asked who the singer was, the manager {{told him he was}} not <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> Having decided that he wanted to sign her, it took several months of asking around for Beese to eventually discover who the singer was. However, Winehouse had already recorded a number of songs and signed a publishing deal with EMI by this time. Incidentally, she formed a working relationship with producer Salaam Remi through these record publishers.|$|E

Saunière, however, had been soliciting and accepting money via the post to say thousands of Masses, charging one franc per Mass. Some clients would send payment for hundreds of Masses, which he never actually performed.|$|E

The early development of Holy Wood coincided with Manson's three-month seclusion {{at his home}} in the Hollywood Hills, during which he considered how to respond to the controversy. Manson said the maelstrom made him re-evaluate his career: [...] "There was a bit of trepidation, [...] deciding: 'Is it worth it? Are people understanding what I'm trying to say? Am I even gonna be <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it?' Because I definitely had every single door shut in my face... there were {{not a lot of people}} who stood behind me." [...] He told Alternative Press that he felt his safety was threatened to the point that he [...] "could be shot Mark David Chapman-style." [...] He began work on the album as a counterattack.|$|E

500|$|Vocabulary is also {{restricted}} by class. [...] Freshmen may not {{say the word}} Pisshead, a nickname for sophomores. [...] Juniors are known as [...] "Serge Butts", so neither freshmen nor sophomores can say any form of either word (accordingly, words such as [...] "button" [...] must be replaced with roundabout euphemisms, such as [...] "circular fastener"). Juniors are also the first class to be <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> [...] "Whoop!" [...] Seniors, known as [...] "Zips" [...] for the black and gold braid on their garrison caps, which resembles a zipper, have reserved the word elephant and all forms of the words [...] "death," [...] "dying," [...] "shoot," [...] or [...] "reload" [...] {{in reference to the}} traditions surrounding Elephant Walk. However, saying the phrases [...] "pass away," [...] "decease," [...] "fire," [...] "load again," [...] etc., are all acceptable substitutes.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with The Northern Echo, Star Stories actor Kevin Bishop discussed the legal issues involved with making the series: [...] "We're not <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> anything about anyone that isn't true. It can be quite tricky. Sometimes we've had to change lines even when the filming is all finished. We {{go back to the}} recording studio and put one line over another line. ... The only reason I reckon we've not been sued is because actually we've not said anything that technically we can't." [...] He said the series was [...] "well looked after" [...] by attorneys. In a 2009 interview with The Independent, Bishop recounted an experience when he gave a copy of the program to television producers in the United States: [...] "I gave some American producers the Star Stories DVD and those that could be bothered to watch it saw the Tom Cruise one. One guy went 'you can't do that it's Tom Cruise man? [...] 'yeah but you can't do that on TV' [...] 'what you’re talking about Scientology, are you fucking nuts?? [...] has Tom Cruise seen this?!" ...|$|E

No doubt, they'll try this stunt again." [...] Likewise, Jean Marbella of The Baltimore Sun said, [...] "It's not even that the terrorists have won, it's that wannabe terrorists have won." [...] Margaret Wente of The Globe and Mail said the censorship of [...] "201" [...] could be [...] "the lowest point {{in the history of}} American TV", and that it represented a gravitation toward fear in a post-September 11 attacks world. Los Angeles Times columnist Patrick Goldstein said there were [...] "no easy answers" [...] and that he was not surprised Comedy Central took the threat seriously, but added, [...] "in a democracy, artists and political satirists should be <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> what they believe, even if it offends some of its audience". Roger Catlin of the Hartford Courant suggested Comedy Central actually drew more attention to the Muhammad controversy, not less, by censoring the episode.

He's so famous that you're <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{anything}} you want about him.' Well, I disagree with that." [...] In July 2015, O'Brien, who was now working for Bloomberg View, wrote a column titled [...] "Dear Mr. Trump: I'm Worth $10 Billion, Too," [...] in which he exaggerated {{the value of his}} belongings {{in the same way as}} Trump.|$|E

2500|$|On the way Israel is {{perceived}} in the Netherlands: [...] "The crisis of Dutch socialism can be sized {{up in its}} attitudes toward both Islam and Israel. It holds Israel to exceptionally high moral standards. The Israelis, however, will always do well, because they themselves set high standards for their actions. The standards for judging the Palestinians, however, are very low. Most outsiders remain silent on all the problems in their territories. That helps the Palestinians become even more corrupt than they already are. Those {{who live in the}} territories are not <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> anything about this because they risk being murdered by their own people." ...|$|E

2500|$|By 1982, ENG {{technology}} {{had become}} sufficiently reliable for Bernard Hesketh {{to use an}} Ikegami camera to cover the Falklands War, coverage for which he won the [...] "Royal Television Society Cameraman of the Year" [...] award and a BAFTA nomination – {{the first time that}} BBC News had relied upon an electronic camera, rather than film, in a conflict zone. BBC News won the BAFTA for its actuality coverage, however the event has become remembered in television terms for Brian Hanrahan's reporting where he coined the phrase [...] "I'm not <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> how many planes joined the raid, but I counted them all out and I counted them all back" [...] to circumvent restrictions, and which has become cited as an example of good reporting under pressure.|$|E

He lived in Gobardanga for some time as guardian of the zemindar’s sons. When Keshub Chunder Sen established the Bharat Ashram in 1872, he moved in along with his family. He presided over the first day meeting of the All-India National Conference in Kolkata in 1883.|$|E

I'm not sure I'm <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that, but he reacted in an entirely understandable way to what was not the most riveting of parliamentary occasions." [...] After the remarks were repeated in several publications, Huhne made a public apology to the Speaker in the House of Commons on 8 November in which he withdrew his prior comments. [...] "It was wrong of me to draw the Chair into a matter of political dispute. I hope you will accept I intended no personal offence and fully withdraw my comments." ...|$|E

2500|$|The P.L.C. Speech Day of 1929 clearly {{illustrated}} {{the degree of}} support for McQueen among parents and students. It is said that when the official party came on stage, there was no applause until McQueen appeared. Vicars, the chairman for the occasion, referred to McQueen once {{towards the end of}} the ceremony but was drowned out by cheering and clapping [...] "during which Council were a peculiar greenish hue about the face, especially Gillespie and Vicars." [...] Further, after the National Anthem was sung and the officials were about to leave the stage, Rev. William Duffy, Minister at Wollongong and a parent of a P.L.C student, stood up and asked the chairman to be seated. He said that McQueen had been wronged and what was more, he was not even <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> good-bye. Council subsequently rushed out quickly and locked themselves in the dining room. In the Assembly Hall all was confusion with everyone cheering, stamping their feet and shouting. The stamping continued for so long that the Hall became full of dust, making it hard to see. Eventually, Mr. Duffy was able to quieten the gathering and McQueen was able to speak. He thanked those who had helped him and added: ...|$|E
