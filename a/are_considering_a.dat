5|$|Beavers, rodents {{weighing}} up to , have sometimes caused problems along Fanno Creek. In 2014 and 2015, a growing population of beavers gnawed down trees and dammed the creek in Greenway Park in Beaverton.

Park officials <b>are</b> <b>considering</b> <b>a</b> variety of options, including re-routing the trails, building a boardwalk over the water, or removing the beaver dams.|$|E

25|$|Of {{particular}} concern in nuclear waste management are two long-lived fission products, Tc-99 (half-life 220,000 years) and I-129 (half-life 15.7 million years), which dominate spent fuel radioactivity {{after a few}} thousand years. The most troublesome transuranic elements in spent fuel are Np-237 (half-life two million years) and Pu-239 (half-life 24,000 years). Nuclear waste requires sophisticated treatment and management to successfully isolate it from interacting with the biosphere. This usually necessitates treatment, followed by a long-term management strategy involving storage, disposal or transformation of the waste into a non-toxic form. Governments around the world <b>are</b> <b>considering</b> <b>a</b> range of waste management and disposal options, though there has been limited progress toward long-term waste management solutions.|$|E
