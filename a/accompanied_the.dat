5|$|As during Napoleon's Egyptian Campaign, when a Commission of Sciences and Arts had <b>accompanied</b> <b>the</b> {{military}} campaign, a Morea scientific expedition (Expédition scientifique de Morée.) <b>accompanied</b> <b>the</b> troops. Seventeen learned men representing different specialties (natural {{history and}} antiquities – archaeology, architecture and sculpture) made the voyage. Their work was of major importance in increasing {{knowledge about the}} country. As an example, the topographic maps they produced were excellent. More significantly, the measurements, drawings, profiles, plans and proposals for the theoretical restoration of Peloponnesian monuments, of Attica and of the Cyclades were, following James Stuart and Nicholas Revett's Antiquities of Athens, a new attempt to systematically and exhaustively catalogue ancient Greek ruins. The Morea expedition and its publications offered a near-complete description of the regions visited. They formed a scientific, aesthetic and human inventory that remained {{one of the best}} means, short of visiting them in person, {{to get to know the}} regions.|$|E

However, development of solar technologies stagnated in the early 20thcentury {{in the face of}} the increasing availability, economy, and utility of coal and petroleum.|$|E
