The Luxury model includes front three-point seat belts with emergency <b>locking</b> <b>retractor</b> (ELR).|$|R
50|$|A two air bag {{supplementary}} {{restraint system}} (SRS) with 2-way occupant protection was standard. The air bags would adjust deployment force depending on crash severity. Features included SecuriLock with smart key and engine immobilizer, security approach lamps, four-wheel {{anti-lock braking system}} (ABS), side-intrusion door beams, post-crash fuel pump shut-off and three-point safety belts for all rows of seating with tension and <b>locking</b> <b>retractors.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Japanese {{vehicles}} had rear lap belts only on {{the lower}} trim levels and 3-point outboard position lap and shoulder belts with a center rear position lap belt on all vehicles with the 2.0-liter engine. Seat belt pre-tensioners with Emergency <b>Locking</b> <b>Retractors</b> (called E.L.R.) were standard equipment in Japanese vehicles with the VZ trim package and all vehicles equipped with the turbocharged engine.|$|R
50|$|The third safety {{advancement}} was {{the introduction}} of dual front lap-and-shoulder safety belts with emergency <b>locking</b> <b>retractors</b> for outboard occupants in 1975 for the 1976 model year. These replaced the outdated and inadequate lap belts previously used. A center lap safety belt with slack adjustment was provided for the center occupant. Ford and Dodge would follow one model year later adding lap-and-shoulder safety belts to their pickups.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: These mid-locks are {{manually}} {{attached to}} the upper container, and then <b>automatically</b> <b>lock</b> to the lower container when stacked.|$|R

5000|$|... 1990 - The 80 series {{station wagon}} was introduced, {{replacing}} the 60 series. All 80s sold in North America and Europe {{now have a}} full-time four-wheel drive system. In Japan, Africa, and Australia, a part-time system was still available. 80s produced between 1990 and 1991 had an open centre differential which was lockable in 4HI and <b>automatically</b> <b>locked</b> in 4LO. From 1992 onward, vehicles with anti-lock brakes had a viscous coupling that sent a maximum of 30% torque to the non-slipping axle. The differential was lockable in 4HI and <b>automatically</b> <b>locked</b> in 4LO.|$|R
50|$|The manual, {{as well as}} most menus of the PS3 version fail {{to mention}} the ability to <b>automatically</b> <b>lock</b> on the nearest enemy overall (without any {{distinction}} between the various enemy types or their priority) by holding the X button.This is different from holding the Circle button, which <b>automatically</b> <b>locks</b> on the nearest threat (enemies with adequate reach and weaponry to harm the player). Despite the omission, this feature is available on the PS3. It was however mentioned more explicitly in the documentation and menus of the Xbox 360 version.|$|R
5000|$|Gunner Mode: By {{holding down}} the A button, the {{characters}} assume Gunner Mode. The pilot's attacks become weaker {{and the plane}} moves slower, while the gunner <b>automatically</b> <b>locks</b> on and fires at enemies with increased firepower.|$|R
50|$|Call a Bike is a bike hire system run by Deutsche Bahn (DB) {{in several}} German cities. Developed in 1998 and in {{operation}} since 2000, Call a Bike uses {{a system of}} authentication codes to <b>automatically</b> <b>lock</b> and unlock bikes.|$|R

50|$|Being an ex-SEAL, John Mayor {{is able to}} use {{all sorts}} of {{firearms}} and so, the player can move while armed and <b>automatically</b> <b>lock</b> on to enemies by depressing the aim button. There is an option for the player to switch manually between targets.|$|R
5000|$|While the {{questions}} normally {{had no time}} limit, a contestant who had already locked in his/her answers could [...] "press" [...] the opponent and impose a seven-second time limit, after which answers would be <b>automatically</b> <b>locked</b> in. Each contestant was given two presses per duel.|$|R
2500|$|If an {{algorithm}} detects what Google calls [...] "abnormal usage {{that may}} indicate that your account has been compromised", the account can be <b>automatically</b> <b>locked</b> down for between one minute and 24 hours, {{depending on the type}} of activity detected. Listed reasons for a lock-down include: ...|$|R
50|$|A speed sensing door-lock <b>automatically</b> <b>locks</b> {{any of the}} {{unlocked}} doors {{when the}} car moves above 15 km/h and automatically unlocks them when the gear lever switched to P (park). Both front and rear wipers are speed-sensing, and wipe automatically when the car is moving at speed.|$|R
50|$|Brakes - Dollies have {{mechanical}} brakes which <b>automatically</b> <b>lock</b> the dolly wheels {{when the}} towbar {{is in the}} parked (vertical) orientation, and automatically release the dolly wheels when the towbar is in the towing (horizontal) orientation. No explicit manual locking/unlocking action by the operator is needed.|$|R
5000|$|If an {{algorithm}} detects what Google calls [...] "abnormal usage {{that may}} indicate that your account has been compromised", the account can be <b>automatically</b> <b>locked</b> down for between one minute and 24 hours, {{depending on the type}} of activity detected. Listed reasons for a lock-down include: ...|$|R
50|$|A vehicle-sensitive lock {{is based}} on a {{pendulum}} swung away from its plumb position by rapid deceleration or rollover of the vehicle. In the absence of rapid deceleration or rollover, the reel is unlocked and the belt strap may be pulled from the reel against the spring tension of the reel. The vehicle occupant can move around with relative freedom while the spring tension of the reel keeps the belt taut against the occupant. When the pendulum swings away from its normal plumb position due to sudden deceleration or rollover, a pawl is engaged, the reel locks and the strap restrains the belted occupant in position. Dual-sensing <b>locking</b> <b>retractors</b> use both vehicle G-loading and webbing payout rate to initiate the locking mechanism.|$|R
50|$|RB-04E: Further {{development}} of the D version to suit the new AJ37 Viggen strike aircraft. The missile had a shorter wingspan and improved guidance system and new monopulse radar seeker, which allowed sea-skimming approaches. This version was highly resistant to ECM and would <b>automatically</b> <b>lock</b> on especially powerful jamming signals.|$|R
50|$|Self-belay {{devices are}} {{designed}} to allow solo climbing where the climber wears the belay device, or secures it to a fixed object on the ground. These devices <b>automatically</b> <b>lock</b> without any intervention when the rope passing through reaches a sufficient velocity (during a fall), but allow rope to move relatively freely whilst climbing.|$|R
50|$|This game {{allows one}} to eight players to control {{separate}} tanks (either as teammates or as opponents). The player(s) can play either {{in the heart of}} downtown Tokyo or at the city's bayside dock. However, the players have twenty seconds to make all the decisions before the game <b>automatically</b> <b>locks</b> them in.|$|R
5000|$|Items {{that were}} {{optional}} on the Accord, such as cruise control, air conditioning with automatic fan speed control and thermostatically monitored temperature, power windows with driver's one touch express down, and power steering were standard on the Vigor. A trip computer that displayed mileage, driving time, and fuel economy that Honda called in sales brochure literature as [...] "Electronic Navigator" [...] was also standard on the Vigor. All Vigors were also equipped with ELR (Emergency <b>Locking</b> <b>Retractor)</b> seatbelts. One of the optional {{items on the}} Vigor was an Electro Gyrocator, the world's first automatic in-car navigation system. Other items included digital instrumentation, four-wheel Anti-lock brakes, a choice of stereo systems from Alpine Electronics, Clarion, and Pioneer, alloy wheels (13-inch), and adjustable thigh support on the front passenger seat.|$|R
5000|$|The Legend offered many Honda [...] "firsts", such as {{a driver}} side airbag, vehicle speed {{sensitive}} power assist rack and pinon steering, anti-lock brakes, seat belt pre-tensioners with Emergency <b>Locking</b> <b>Retractors</b> (called E.L.R.), a choice of 100% wool or cloth moquette upholstery, and [...] "TCS" [...] Traction control, the first car to use traction control on a front wheel drive vehicle. Attention was given {{to make sure the}} Legend was quiet, so Honda used computer simulation using NASTRAN, a stress analysis program created by NASA, helping the car achieve a drag coefficient of 0.32 and an interior noise level of 63 dB (measured while the vehicle was travelling at 100 km/h using a manual transmission in 5th gear), and by using triple seals around the tops of door openings.|$|R
50|$|The {{aiming system}} is {{designed}} differently, instead of pressing buttons to lock against cover, it will <b>automatically</b> <b>lock</b> the player to cover {{when he or she}} goes near cover. Aim assist, as observed in Resistance: Fall of Man, is also present in Retribution. Retribution features new characters and weapons, as well as a non-replenishing life bar.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} {{maintain}} the security of the home many home automation systems integrate features such as remote keyless entry systems which will allow seniors to view who is at the door and then remotely open the door. Home networks can also be programmed to <b>automatically</b> <b>lock</b> doors and shut blinds in {{order to maintain}} privacy.|$|R
50|$|Phoenix Freeze is {{a product}} for laptops and netbooks running Microsoft Windows that {{combines}} with a Bluetooth-enabled smartphone to provide a proximity <b>locking</b> system, which <b>automatically</b> <b>locks</b> a laptop whenever a person walks away from it with a Bluetooth-enabled smartphone. When the smartphone returns within a certain proximity of the laptop that is pre-defined, it automatically unlocks the laptop.|$|R
5000|$|The {{purpose of}} <b>locking</b> <b>retractors</b> {{is to provide}} the seated {{occupant}} the convenience of some free movement of the upper torso within the compartment, while providing a method of limiting this movement {{in the event of}} a crash. Most modern seat belts are stowed on spring-loaded reels called [...] "retractors" [...] equipped with inertial locking mechanisms that stop the belt from extending off the reel during severe deceleration. There are two main types of inertial seat belt lock. A webbing-sensitive lock is based on a centrifugal clutch activated by rapid acceleration of the strap (webbing) from the reel. The belt can be pulled from the reel only slowly and gradually, as when the occupant extends the belt to fasten it. A sudden rapid pull of the belt—as in a sudden braking or collision event—causes the reel to lock, restraining the occupant in position.|$|R
5|$|The 2012 Volt {{standard}} {{features include}} a remote keyless access with passive locking allowing {{the car to}} <b>automatically</b> <b>lock</b> and unlock with the key fob in close proximity of vehicle; OnStar turn-by-turn navigation for three years, and available in-dash navigation system; and Chevrolet MyLink including Bluetooth streaming audio for music and select phones. The 2012 Volt has seven option packages while the 2011 model had only three.|$|R
25|$|For audio communications, {{there is}} a common {{agreement}} about the BFO oscillator shift of 1.7kHz. A voice signal is sensitive to about 50Hz shift, with up to 100Hz still bearable. Some receivers use a carrier recovery system, which attempts to <b>automatically</b> <b>lock</b> on to the exact IF frequency. The carrier recovery doesn't solve the frequency shift. It gives better S/N ratio on the detector output.|$|R
50|$|Fire control: Features a Ratep JSC 5P-10E Puma {{fire control}} system, {{consisting}} of a phased array and target tracking radar along with laser and TV devices. The system, fitted above the bridge deck, features in-flight course correction updates via data links, has a maximum detection range of 60 km, operates autonomously and is capable of <b>automatically</b> <b>locking</b> on to four targets and tracking them.|$|R
50|$|The {{basis for}} the myth was a feature of BlackBerry phones: If the battery level was too low, the phone <b>automatically</b> <b>locked</b> down phone {{features}} and shut down the phone radio for all calls except to emergency services. People discovered that if they dialed 999 then immediately hung up, it would override the shutdown {{for a number of}} minutes so that phone calls could be made.|$|R
50|$|The phone can <b>automatically</b> <b>lock</b> after a set time, {{starting}} from five seconds of no activity. In {{addition to the}} auto-lock, users can lock with a 'keyguard', which prevents unauthorised use of the phone. The code it uses is the standard security code. If the user gets this code wrong three time, the phone is 'locked out', whereby no-one can gain access for ten minutes.|$|R
50|$|When opened, the {{top portion}} slides upwards, {{revealing}} the standard keys (including numeric, star, and pound keys). These keys are covered {{when the phone}} is closed, but the remaining keys, including the side keys, can be used normally once the keypad is unlocked; such keys are <b>automatically</b> <b>locked</b> shortly after the device is closed to prevent accidental activation when in a purse or pocket.|$|R
50|$|The 2012 Volt {{standard}} {{features include}} a remote keyless access with passive locking allowing {{the car to}} <b>automatically</b> <b>lock</b> and unlock with the key fob in close proximity of vehicle; OnStar turn-by-turn navigation for three years, and available in-dash navigation system; and Chevrolet MyLink including Bluetooth streaming audio for music and select phones. The 2012 Volt has seven option packages while the 2011 model had only three.|$|R
5000|$|The gate {{should be}} fitted with hinges that are self closing, {{and are able}} to do so from a {{stationary}} position without any manual force applied. Once closed, the gate should <b>automatically</b> <b>lock</b> and should not be able to be opened again with force unless the latch is manually opened. The gap between the gate panel and the latching panel should be less than 10mm.|$|R
