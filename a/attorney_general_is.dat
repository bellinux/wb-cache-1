25|$|The <b>Attorney</b> <b>General</b> <b>is</b> a non-cabinet {{minister}} {{who leads the}} Attorney General's Office. The rule that no Attorney General may be a cabinet minister is a political convention rather than a law, and {{for a short time}} the Attorney General did sit in cabinet, starting with Lord Birkenhead in 1915 and ending with Douglas Hogg in 1928. There is nothing that prohibits Attorneys-General from attending meetings of the cabinet, and on occasion they have been asked to attend meetings to advise the government on the best course of action legally. Despite this it is considered preferable to exclude Attorneys General from cabinet meetings so as to draw a distinct line between them and the political decisions on which they are giving legal advice. As a government minister, the <b>Attorney</b> <b>General</b> <b>is</b> directly answerable to Parliament.|$|E
