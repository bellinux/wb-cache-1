40|$|For many years, {{mid-infrared}} (2 - 5 µm) semiconductor lasers {{operating at}} or near room temperature have been sought for use in LADAR, gas sensing, and spectroscopy. Smaller bandgap materials necessary for this range {{are more susceptible to}} non-radiative Auger recombination. Further, as laser structures become more complicated, like quantum cascade intersubband and interband lasers, Shockley-Read-Hall losses increase. The simplest structure is Type-I multiple quantum well (MQW), but few QW III-V heterojunction material systems capable of 2 - 5 µm emission have a Type-I offset. One such system with InAsSb wells and AlInAsSb barriers has been unable to exceed 175 K under CW operation partially due to poor carrier confinement associated with small valence band offsets. This paper describes the growth and performance of AlInAsSb/InAsSb lasers using a 0. 3 mole fraction of Al in the Group III elements. Increased Al content enhances the valence and conduction band offsets, but the AlInAsSb alloy exhibits a miscibility gap above 0. 06 Al mole fraction, so a digital <b>alloy</b> <b>technique</b> was used to grow high quality 0. 3 - 2 µm thick quaternary films. As Al mole fraction in the barriers was increased from 0. 20 to 0. 30 an 80 -fold increase in photoluminescence (PL) was observed. The corresponding lasers were grown and tested demonstrating lasing at 3. 9 µm and 50 K. Theoretical studies suggest that adding Ga to the barriers, forming an AlGaInAsSb quinary alloy, results in band structures more favorable towards minimizing Auger effects and realizing Type I offset behavior over a wider range of alloy compositions. PL structures were grown and tested, again using a digital <b>alloy</b> <b>technique</b> for the quinary alloy. Preliminary results show promise...|$|R
