5|$|By {{the turn}} of the 18th century, Felling {{consisted}} of little more than the large Brandling estate and a small scattering of tiny farming villages. However, Ralph Brandling, the incumbent of the Brandling estate at that time, had come to realise the value of the rich coal deposits on his estate and began drift mining around 1670. He initially found the large coal seams under his estate difficult to extract due to their depth, and indeed it was imported coal from Newcastle-upon-Tyne which saw the development of more extensive industries in salt, glass and chemicals which began to attract workers to the area. At around 1750, a large copper-works was opened at the banks of the River Tyne; the first such works to be developed on the river. Encouraged by these developments, Ralph Brandling's son, Charles Brandling, firstly commissioned more extensive mining of near-surface coal on his estate and then, encouraged by the discovery of several strata below his estate, began boring operations in 1758 to allow ultimately for deeper coal extraction. The result was the opening of Felling Colliery in 1779, working on the High Main stratum at a depth of 125 fathoms. <b>A</b> <b>brown</b> <b>paper</b> mill was also opened in 1798.|$|E

25|$|Genetic drift is a {{cause of}} allelic {{frequency}} change within populations of a species. Alleles are different variations of specific genes. They determine things like hair color, skin tone, eye color and blood type; in other words, all the genetic traits that vary between individuals. Genetic drift does not introduce new alleles to a population, but it can reduce variation within a population by removing an allele from the gene pool. Genetic drift is caused by random sampling of alleles. A truly random sample is a sample in which no outside forces affect what is selected. It is like pulling marbles {{of the same size}} and weight but of different colors from <b>a</b> <b>brown</b> <b>paper</b> bag. In any offspring, the alleles present are samples of the previous generations alleles, and chance plays a role in whether an individual survives to reproduce and to pass a sample of their generation onward to the next. The allelic frequency of a population is the ratio of the copies of one specific allele that share the same form compared to the number of all forms of the allele present in the population.|$|E

500|$|NEMS had a {{staff of}} twenty-five {{at the time of}} its move from Liverpool to London in 1964. NEMS booked the Beatles' concerts, and it also {{presented}} groups as an opening act. It accrued money as promoter, booking agent, and manager for all concerts. The Beatles were constantly in demand by concert promoters, and Epstein took advantage of the situation to avoid paying some taxes by accepting [...] "hidden" [...] fees on the night of a performance, which he always kept in <b>a</b> <b>brown</b> <b>paper</b> bag.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} the artwork was finalized, Duane Allman was still alive and the title had not been finalized. As a result, the album lacks a title on the cover, which was an unusual {{approach}} for bands at the time. Powell later said, [...] "When we showed it to someone at the label, he said, 'They are so hot right now, we could sell it in <b>a</b> <b>brown</b> <b>paper</b> bag'". Atlantic initially intended to title the album The Kind We Grow in Dixie, but the band refused. The title was the label of the postcard series Powell had seen in Athens. Trucks suggested they name the album Eat a Peach for Peace, after a quote from Duane Allman. When the writer Ellen Mandel asked Allman {{what he was doing}} to help the revolution, he replied: ...|$|E
500|$|On 9 June 1928, Harry Bull {{died and}} the rectory again became vacant. In the {{following}} year, on 2 October, the Reverend Guy Eric Smith and his wife moved into the house. Soon after moving in, Smith's wife, while cleaning out a cupboard, came across <b>a</b> <b>brown</b> <b>paper</b> package containing the skull of a young woman. Shortly after, the family reported a variety of incidents including the sounds of servant bells ringing despite their being disconnected, lights appearing in windows and unexplained footsteps. In addition, Smith's wife believed she saw a horse-drawn carriage at night. The Smiths contacted the Daily Mirror asking {{to be put in}} touch with the Society for Psychical Research (SPR). On 10 June 1929 the newspaper sent a reporter, who promptly wrote {{the first in a series}} of articles detailing the mysteries of Borley. The paper also arranged for Harry Price, a paranormal researcher, to make his first visit to the house. He arrived on 12 June and immediately phenomena of a new kind appeared, such as the throwing of stones, a vase and other objects. [...] "Spirit messages" [...] were tapped out from the frame of a mirror. As soon as Price left, these ceased. Smith's wife later maintained that she already suspected Price, an expert conjurer, of falsifying the phenomena.|$|E

2500|$|New South Wales {{selection}} bias is a perceived bias by selectors of the Australian cricket teams towards players from New South Wales. It was exemplified in a quote by former South Australian captain David Hookes who said that, [...] "when they give out the baggy blue cap in New South Wales, {{they give you}} a baggy green one in <b>a</b> <b>brown</b> <b>paper</b> bag as well to save making two presentations". This is an example of confirmation bias and Hookes' comment came at a time when, especially during the 1980s, there was a public perception that strong performances by non-NSW players were often ignored by the Australian selectors in favour of seemingly under-performing NSW players who were selected for the Test and/or One-Day team. The claims persist {{in spite of the fact}} that no New South Welshman has occupied a position on the National Selection Panel since John Benaud in 1994.|$|E

2500|$|There {{have been}} many claimants to the poem's authorship, {{including}} attributions to traditional and Native American origins. Dear Abby author Abigail Van Buren researched the poem's history and concluded in 1998 that Mary Elizabeth Frye, who was living in Baltimore at the time, had written the poem in 1932. According to Van Buren's research, Frye had never written any poetry, but the plight of a German Jewish woman, Margaret Schwarzkopf, who was staying with her and her husband, had inspired the poem. Margaret Schwarzkopf was concerned about her mother, who was ill in Germany, {{but she had been}} warned not to return home because of increasing unrest. When her mother died, the heartbroken young woman told Frye that she never had the chance to [...] "stand by my mother's grave and shed a tear". Frye, according to Van Buren's research, found herself composing a piece of verse on <b>a</b> <b>brown</b> <b>paper</b> shopping bag. Later she said that the words [...] "just came to her" [...] and expressed what she felt about life and death.|$|E
2500|$|Bill Vander Zalm {{became the}} new Socred leader when Smith threw his support to him rather than see McCarthy win, {{and led the}} party to victory in the {{election}} later that year. Vander Zalm was later involved in {{a conflict of interest}} scandal following the sale of Fantasy Gardens, a Christian and Dutch culture theme park built by the Premier, to Tan Yu, a Filipino Chinese gambling kingpin. There were also concerns over Yu's application to the government for a bank licence, and lurid stories from flamboyant realtor Faye Leung of a party in the [...] "Howard Hughes Suite" [...] on the top two floors of the Bayshore Inn, where Tan Yu had been staying, with reports of a bag of money in <b>a</b> <b>brown</b> <b>paper</b> bag passed from Yu to Vander Zalm during the goings-on. These scandals forced Vander Zalm's resignation, and Rita Johnston became premier of the province. Johnston presided over the end of Social Credit power, calling an election which led to the reducing of the party's caucus to only two seats, and the revival of the long-defunct British Columbia Liberal Party as Opposition to the victorious NDP under former Vancouver mayor Mike Harcourt.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first edition}} of The Ladder {{appeared}} in October 1956, edited by Phyllis Lyon, who co-founded the Daughters of Bilitis in 1955 with Del Martin, both of whom had journalism experience. Many of its contributors used pseudonyms or initials. Lyon edited The Ladder as [...] "Ann Ferguson" [...] {{for the first few}} months, but dropped the name as a way of encouraging their readers not to hide. The first issues of the magazine averaged 20 pages with each issue increasing in length from 12 pages to 30 pages {{by the end of the}} first volume. A volunteer staff produced each issue on a typewriter, copied by a mimeograph, and hand stapled. It [...] included book reviews, news, poetry, short stories, a running bibliography of lesbian literature, letters from readers, and updates from DOB meetings. In 1959 it took a rare political stance against San Francisco mayoral candidate Russel Wolden who criticized incumbent mayor George Christopher's making the city a haven for [...] "sex deviants." [...] The Ladder was issued in <b>a</b> <b>brown</b> <b>paper</b> covering for the duration of its existence. [...] There were 175 copies of the first issue, and members of the DOB mailed them to every woman they knew who might be interested, including woman professionals in the San Francisco telephone book, and [...] others throughout the United States. It soon became available in newsstands in major cities and by subscription, obtained by word of mouth.|$|E

2500|$|On the October 16, 2008 {{episode of}} Impact!, Hoyt and Rave were {{attacked}} by Kurt Angle, and were hospitalized. As Hemme attempted to leave the building {{and go to the}} hospital, The Beautiful People (Angelina Love and Velvet Sky) and Cute Kip confronted and insulted her, which led to the trio attacking her and placing <b>a</b> <b>brown</b> <b>paper</b> bag over her head. Hemme transitioned into a [...] face by defeating Sky on the October 23, 2008 episode of Impact!. She feuded with the Beautiful People, which resulted in two consecutive tag team matches with ODB and Sojourner Bolt as per partners, respectively. After showcasing improved wrestling skills, Hemme was then placed into a more active in-ring role, being pushed to challenge Awesome Kong for the TNA Women's Knockout Championship at Final Resolution, after defeating Raisha Saeed on the November 27 episode of TNA Impact!. Hemme then teamed with A.J. Styles in a mixed tag team match against Kong and Scott Steiner, where Hemme pinned Kong. At Final Resolution, Hemme was attacked by Saeed and Rhaka Khan and won the match by disqualification, and thus Kong retained the title. Hemme was subsequently granted a rematch at Genesis. A week later, Hemme teamed with ODB against Khan and Saeed in a winning effort. On January 2009, Hemme sustained a neck injury while training in the ring with Styles for her match, and was deemed unable to compete at Genesis.|$|E
