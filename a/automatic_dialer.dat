50|$|An <b>automatic</b> <b>dialer</b> (auto dialer, auto-dialer, autodialler) is an {{electronic}} device or software that automatically dials telephone numbers. Once the call has been answered, the autodialer either plays a recorded message or connects {{the call to}} a live person.|$|E
50|$|Consumers may add {{landline}} or cellular {{numbers to}} the registry, but FCC regulations prohibit telemarketers from calling {{a cellular phone}} number with an <b>automatic</b> <b>dialer</b> under almost all circumstances. In 2005, a rumor began circulating via e-mail that cell phone providers were planning on making their number directories available to telemarketers. The FTC responded by clarifying that cell phones cannot be called by telemarketers. Similarly, fax numbers {{do not need to}} be included in the registry due to existing federal laws and regulations that prohibit the sending of unsolicited faxes.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the basic single-line model, the Western Electric 2500-series included many related variations and special purpose models with additional features. This included sets with a headset jack, 2-line sets, keysets (2560), call directors, panel phones (2750), industrial phones (2520), <b>automatic</b> <b>dialers</b> (2660).|$|R

50|$|The Western Electric model 1500 {{telephone}} {{adapted the}} 500 design for touch-tone dialing with a push-button pad for the digits 0 through 9. It was produced from 1963 to 1968. In {{addition to the}} basic single-line model 1500D, the 1500-series included many related variations and special purpose models with additional features.

40|$|NASA {{has applied}} its {{communications}} equipment expertise to {{development of a}} communications console that provides, in a compact package only slightly larger than an electric typewriter, all the emergency medical services communications functions needed for a regional hospital. A prototype unit, built by Johnson Space Center, has been installed in the Odessa (Texas) Medical Center Hospital. The hospital is the medical control center for the 17 -county Permian Basin Emergency Medical System in west Texas. The console project originated {{in response to a}} request to NASA from the Texas governor's office, which sought a better way of providing emergency medical care in rural areas. Because ambulance travel time is frequently long in remote areas of west Texas, it is important that treatment begin {{at the scene of the}} emergency rather than at the hospital emergency room. A radio and telephone system linking ambulance emergency technicians and hospital staff makes this possible. But earlier equipment was complex, requiring specialized operators. A highly reliable system was needed to minimize breakdowns and provide controls of utmost simplicity, so that the system could be operated by physicians and nurses rather than by communications specialists. The resulting console has both radio and telephone sections. With the radio equipment, hospital personnel can communicate with ambulance drivers and paramedics, receive incoming electrocardiagrams, consult with other hospitals, page hospital staff and set up a radio-to-telephone "patch. " The telephone portion of the system includes a hotline from the Permian Basin Emergency Medical Service's resource control center, an <b>automatic</b> <b>dialer</b> for contacting special care facilities in the Permian Basin network, a hospital intercom terminal and a means of relaying cardioscope displays and other data between hospitals. The integrated system also provides links with local disaster and civil defense organizations and with emergency "Dial 911 " control points...|$|E
40|$|The Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 {{protects the}} privacy {{interests}} of residential telephone subscribers by placing restrictions on unsolicited, automated telephone {{calls to the}} home and facilitates interstate commerce by restricting certain uses of facsimile machines and <b>automatic</b> <b>dialers.</b> Since the statute is silent regarding federal district court jurisdiction over private TCPA claims, federal courts scramble in search for existing law to support their conclusions that the TCPA divests federal district courts of jurisdiction over private TCPA claims. In addition to the reasoning offered by the circuit courts, this Notes discusses the jurisdiction issue and adds an important reason for choosing state courts as the only venues available for private TCPA claims: state courts provide a cheap and easy enforcement of the Act...|$|R
500|$|Several {{critics have}} commented on Frink's inventions. Patrick Goss of MSN's Tech & Gadgets wrote that [...] "When {{it comes to}} gizmos, Frink is the king", and listed the Death Ray {{as one of the}} {{greatest}} gadgets featured in The Simpsons. Although he added that it [...] "was not one of [...] most successful," [...] since it never received the funding it needed from Grampa. On the same list, Goss also featured Frink's <b>automatic</b> phone <b>dialer,</b> intra bovine ice-cream maker (an invention that is inserted into a cow and uses the four stomachs to mix the various ingredients), and hamburger earmuffs. In a profile about Frink, the publication UGO Networks wrote: [...] "Where would the town be without your Jerry Lewis/Julius Kelp-inspired voice and antics? A lot safer most likely. Professor John Frink's inventions range from distracting to disruptive. Who can forget his hamburger earmuffs? Or his teleportation device, responsible for switching Bart Simpson's head with that of a housefly?" [...] Howard Waldrop and Lawrence Person of Locus listed the scene in The Simpsons Movie that features Frink's drilling machine invention as one of the highlights of the film.|$|R
