5|$|Thus the FG01 did not promise much {{in terms}} of performance. It was angular and bulky, with poor {{aerodynamic}} performance negatively affecting grip and handling; it had a plump nose, initially no <b>airbox,</b> and was overweight and under-powered, using a small Ford-Cosworth ED V8 customer engine largely financed by Ford do Brasil, which developed an estimated 100bhp less than the most powerful engine in the field, the Renault V10 supplied to the Benetton and Williams teams. It was also the only car to have a manual gearbox in the 1995 F1 season. The car was liveried in a distinctive yellow-and-blue colour scheme accompanied by fluorescent green wheel-rims, illustrating the team's Brazilian influence in its first year. The precise hue of each colour was chosen {{as a tribute to}} Ayrton Senna, who had been killed at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix; the cars were liveried in identical shades to those used on the Brazilian's helmet design.|$|E
5|$|Vettel {{led away}} at the restart, but his Ferrari {{teammate}} Räikkönen was forced to pull into the pit lane on lap 22 with fire coming from his <b>airbox</b> and subsequently retired, handing second place to Rosberg. Over {{the next couple of}} laps, Vettel was able to pull away from Rosberg on the softer tyre compound. Marcus Ericsson was handed a drive-through penalty for having his team work on his car less than 15 seconds before the restart. By lap 31, the gap between Vettel and Rosberg started to come down again, while Hamilton moved ahead of Sainz into fifth as the latter made a pit stop. Two laps later, Verstappen was in as well, but a slow pit stop lost him time. On lap 35, Rosberg took the lead as Vettel made a pit stop, who also lost time due to a mistake during his stop. He emerged back on track in fourth place. Hamilton now started to pull back time on the leaders, while debutant Palmer held off the two Toro Rosso drivers in a struggle for ninth place.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{some of the}} {{existing}} teams, Forti was able to test its chassis extensively {{prior to the start}} of the season. However, Diniz proved to be around seven seconds per lap off the pace of the leading runners in group testing at the Estoril circuit in March, indicating that the team was likely to be mired at the back of the field. Diniz finished 10th in the season-opening Brazilian GP, but was seven laps down on winner Michael Schumacher. In Argentina, this situation became worse, as, although both drivers finished, they were both nine laps down on winner Damon Hill at the end of the race (with Diniz ahead) and neither were classified, as they had failed to complete 90% of the race distance. The drivers' similar fastest laps during the race were over ten seconds slower than Schumacher's fastest race lap, and almost five seconds slower than the next slowest runner's fastest lap (Domenico Schiattarella in the Simtek). Imola was similarly poor, as both drivers finished seven laps down (with Diniz again ahead) and again failed to reach the 90% threshold for classification. Forti was already the butt of paddock jokes, and were far slower than the other (and financially poorer) backmarkers: Pacific, Simtek, and Minardi. However, the budget enabled improvements to be made to the car. During the season, its weight was reduced by a significant 60 kilograms (approximately 10% of the F1 minimum weight limit of 595kg), and a semi-automatic gearbox, an <b>airbox</b> and redesigns of the front wing, sidepods and monocoque were introduced. The personnel count also doubled during the course of the season. This resulted in a gradual improvement in pace throughout the year, and there were no more non-classified finishes.|$|E

25|$|On August 3, 2013, Polaris {{announced}} three all-new Indian-branded motorcycles {{based on}} the traditional styling of the Indian marque, along with the Thunder Stroke 111 V-twin engine. The motor has a triple-cam design with a chain-driven center cam turning front and rear cams via gears, permitting parallel placement of the pushrods to give a similar appearance to older Indian designs. It is air cooled, with large traditional fins and an <b>airbox</b> in the cast aluminum frame. All Indians using the Thunder Stroke 111 engine share this aluminum frame design, though the wheelbase and front end rake vary depending on model. The integrated transmission is also gear-driven.|$|E
25|$|For {{the second}} year in a row, Räikkönen had to retire from the first race of the season in Australia, after a fire broke out in his <b>airbox.</b> Räikkönen {{finished}} in the second place at the Bahrain Grand Prix while his teammate Sebastian Vettel did not start the race after his car broke down on formation lap. Räikkönen outpaced teammate Sebastian Vettel in qualifying at the Chinese Grand Prix to take 3rd on the grid, however a first lap collision with Vettel saw him damaging his front wing and he dropped down the order, he then showed good pace to move up the field and eventually finished fifth. He managed to finish the Russian Grand Prix in third place after a huge start collision, which left his teammate Vettel out of the race. This was also the 700th podium in Ferrari's Formula One history. Räikkönen finished behind Max Verstappen in second place to take his third podium of the season in the Spanish Grand Prix finishing ahead of his teammate Vettel who was third.|$|E
500|$|At {{the age of}} 25, Pryce {{graduated}} to Formula One, the highest category of circuit racing defined by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), motorsport's world governing body, joining the newly formed Token Racing team. The team was created by Tony Vlassopulos and Ken Grob after the original Token team closed down in 1973 {{due to a lack}} of financial backing which had led to the end of the previous Rondel Racing outfit. Pryce was given the seat thanks to his backing from Titan Properties, and what David Tremayne described as [...] "evident promise". Pryce made his début for the team at the BRDC International Trophy, a non-championship Formula One event held at Silverstone, but lack of an <b>airbox</b> and an engine cover, along with his shortage of experience in the car, made him the slowest driver of the 16 competitors during qualifying: 26 seconds slower than James Hunt's Hesketh in pole position. The Welshman retired 15 laps into the race with a gear linkage problem. Pryce's World Championship début came at the 1974 Belgian Grand Prix, where he qualified in 20th place, 3 seconds slower than the fastest time set by Clay Regazzoni. Once again, he failed to finish, completing 66 laps before retiring after a collision with Jody Scheckter's Tyrrell.|$|E
5000|$|The {{design was}} {{influenced}} by the $50 Sailboat Race, the Moth class, Gavin Atkins's Mouse Boat group, Jim Michalak boat designs, the Phil Bolger [...] "Brick" [...] design, {{and a number of other}} box boats. It is effectively a [...] "sailing box" [...] with 16" [...] sides. Puddle Duck Racers generally are built with two <b>airboxes,</b> either placed along the sides of the boat or at the bow and stern. If placed on the sides, they also provide for seating for the crew. The <b>airboxes</b> provide floatation if the boat capsizes, and can be used for storage.|$|R

2500|$|Also in {{response}} to the terrorist attacks, many of the teams and drivers had special US tributes on their cars and helmets. Jordan's Jarno Trulli added to the standard American flag theme with the words, [...] "Peace no war." [...] The Jordan cars had American flags prominently displayed on the <b>airboxes</b> (see photo).|$|R
500|$|Fernando Alonso ran a {{new power}} unit in his McLaren over the weekend, {{one that he}} had already used once during {{practice}} for the previous race in Russia, having taken the grid penalty for it there. Teammate Jenson Button hoped for Alonso to [...] "annihilate" [...] him, adding: [...] "It's unusual to say that, but in our situation it's about getting it on the car." [...] McLaren also introduced new aerodynamic parts to their cars for the Grand Prix. Both Sebastian Vettel and Kimi Räikkönen of Ferrari needed to exchange their power units. Having already used the allowed four units for the season, both drivers received ten-place grid penalties. Manor Marussia's Will Stevens was placed back twenty grid spots {{for a change of}} his engine, turbocharger and MGU-H unit. Renault used eleven of their twelve remaining token for changes to their power unit. However, both customer teams, Red Bull and Toro Rosso chose not to run with the update, saying its performance advantage was not worth taking the grid penalties. Both Red Bull and McLaren used new front wings, emulating a concept introduced by Mercedes supposed to create more downforce by directing the airflow towards the outside of the front tyres. Similar changes were made by Ferrari to their SF15-T. In preparation for the effects of the high altitude in Mexico, Mercedes added two [...] "ears" [...] {{at the top of the}} <b>airbox</b> in order to improve cooling to the Energy Recovery System of their power unit.|$|E
2500|$|Engine changes {{consisted}} of {{an increase in}} stroke by 2mm, enlarging displacement to [...] The compression ratio was boosted from 11:1 to 12.5:1 and the cylinder head was made more compact and was given lighter titanium valves, saving [...] and [...] on each intake and exhaust valve, respectively. The valves were driven by a chain with a new hydraulic tensioner. The pistons were made lighter by [...] and used ion-coated rings and shot peened connecting rods. The crankcase breather system had reed valves added to control pressure waves in the intake <b>airbox,</b> a way of avoiding power loss.|$|E
2500|$|... 1994 {{also saw}} the {{reintroduction}} of refuelling during {{the race for the}} first time since [...] After Senna's fatal crash at Imola, several rule changes were introduced to slow the cars. In Spain, front wing endplates and rear diffusers were reduced in size. For the following race in Canada, the effectiveness of the <b>airbox</b> was reduced by means of holes cut into the engine cover, resulting in less power. From Germany onwards, a rule was introduced which is still in place as of : a 10mm wooden plank was affixed to the underside of every car to reduce ground effect advantages, whilst also forcing an increase in ride height. Wear was permitted on the plank up to 1mm by the end of the race. After winning in Belgium, Michael Schumacher would be disqualified after the plank on his Benetton was deemed to have excessive wear.|$|E
5000|$|The larger bore may extend {{right through}} the {{complete}} exhaust system, using larger diameter piping and low back pressure mufflers, and through the intake system, with larger diameter <b>airboxes</b> and high-flow, high-efficiency air filters. Muffler modifications will change {{the sound of the}} automobile's engine, usually making it louder; for some tuners this is in itself a desirable effect.|$|R
25|$|By {{this time}} the {{innovations}} introduced by the Lotus 49 and 72 had changed car design. Fully stressed engine and variable flexibility suspension was now the norm, most cars had wedge shaped bodywork and <b>airboxes</b> towered over driver's heads. The main innovation of this era came in 1975, when the Ferrari 312T appeared, its transverse gearbox allowing better weight distribution.|$|R
5000|$|... 1976 : <b>Airboxes</b> {{on the top}} of {{cars are}} banned, and the cooling of engines through similar means is heavily limited. [...] "Safety structures" [...] around {{dashboard}} and pedals implemented. After Niki Lauda's near-fatal accident at a nearly inaccessible point at the treacherous 14.2 mi (22.8 km) Nürburgring in West Germany, the circuit was taken off the 1977 calendar after having been on the calendar for all but 4 seasons of Formula One up to 1976.|$|R
2500|$|The {{redesigned}} {{carbon fiber}} and kevlar bodywork of the Mk III {{was developed by}} aircraft designer John Roncz, who assisted Bob Riley in using early computational fluid dynamics programs to refine the aerodynamics of the new car. [...] Final aerodynamic testing was performed at a Lockheed windtunnel. [...] The nose of the final Mk III was {{very similar to the}} original design model from 1993, featuring a nose which sloped downward towards a splitter extended {{from the front of the}} car. [...] In the center, a wide intake allowed air into the radiator mounted flat under the nose. [...] The air exited the radiator from two openings on top of the nose and in front of the cockpit. [...] Between these exit vents, teams had the option of installing extra headlights for night races. [...] A circular duct was placed on either side of the radiator intake to allow air to the front brakes for cooling. [...] Behind the front wheels the bodywork was now relatively square and flat, with full sidepods running the full width of the car. [...] A rules-mandated full width roll hoop was positioned behind cockpit. [...] Positioned under the roll hoop was an arched intake for the engine <b>airbox.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The 2004-2011 Police Interceptor {{is rated}} for [...] mostly {{due to the}} {{addition}} of a new better flowing air intake system. This system includes a new <b>airbox</b> that is similar to the Mercury Marauder <b>airbox</b> (raised <b>airbox</b> lid, deeper bottom), with an integrated 80 mm mass airflow (MAF) sensor {{that is part of the}} <b>airbox</b> lid (but can be serviced individually). This allows for much more precise flow calibration and reduces the chances of air leakage. The P71 zip tube (the flexible rubber hose between the throttle body and MAF outlet) is also used to reduce NVH (noise, vibration, and harshness) as well as transfer air from the <b>airbox</b> to the throttle body with minimal flow resistance. From 2005 on, the throttle body is no longer manually operated via cable but an electronic Drive-By-Wire (DBW) set up.|$|E
25|$|The new {{regulations}} introduced during the Monaco weekend to modify amongst other things the <b>airboxes</b> {{of the cars}} were now in effect and were visibly shown as teams had to cut holes in the engine covers. Another temporary chicane was installed prior to the flat-out left-right kink leading to the start-finish straight to slow the cars down. Benetton introduced a revised rear wing assembly and Ferrari had new side pods for their cars. Andrea de Cesaris was back in action, now with Sauber, and celebrated his 200th Grand Prix start.|$|R
5000|$|PD Racer hulls are {{numbered}} after photographic proof is given that that hull {{has been completed}} rather than assigned by the plan number a builder is given. To register a hull and receive a hull number, the basic hull (four sides, and two <b>airboxes</b> attached to a plywood bottom) must be assembled (called [...] "going 3D" [...] by the builders). Since many people may order plans and never build the boat, photographic evidence gives a more accurate estimate of boat numbers. In late 2013, there were over 850 PD Racers registered in North America. Internationally, registered boats {{can be found in}} countries such as Australia, England, Germany and Argentina.|$|R
5000|$|... 1971 917K: The 917K {{was further}} {{developed}} for the 1971 season, and the car had vertical fins and 2 <b>airboxes</b> on the tail section for better aerodynamics and cooling. The fins retained the airflow over the rear part of the bodywork, allowing the deck height to be reduced for a given level of downforce. As a result, the 'finned' 1971 917Ks were faster than the 1970 versions. This version proved as successful as the preceding 1970 version. TA version of this model won Le Mans in 1971; {{but it had a}} specially-built (lighter) magnesium tube-frame chassis (whereas all the other 917Ks had an aluminum tube-frame chassis).|$|R
50|$|The <b>airbox</b> {{allows the}} use of one air filter instead of many. Developments arising from {{concerns}} about environmental effects during the late 1970s allow the <b>airbox</b> to collect pump gases from the crankcase and the tank air vent and re-feed them to the engine.|$|E
5000|$|A new <b>airbox</b> and filter {{assembly}} had bright chrome end caps and filter servicing was easier. The frame side covers were all new {{as well to}} blend in with the lines of the <b>airbox</b> end caps. The chain guard was chromed steel instead of black plastic.|$|E

Superficially, IndyCar machines closely resemble those of other open-wheeled formula racing cars, with front and rear wings and prominent <b>airboxes.</b> Originally, the cars were unique, being designed specifically for oval racing; for example, the oil and cooling systems were asymmetrical to account for the pull of liquids to {{the right side of the}} cars.

2500|$|While {{significant}} changes {{could not be}} made to cars in 1994, the FIA required all Formula One cars' <b>airboxes</b> to be perforated to reduce their [...] "ram-air" [...] effect, to reduce power. For the same reason special racing fuels, previously an exotic mixture of benzenes and toluenes, were banned and only those with similar characteristics to everyday unleaded petrol would be permitted. To reduce downforce, and therefore the cornering speed of the cars, a wooden [...] "plank" [...] was to be fitted beneath the central portion of the chassis, forcing a large section of the floor further away from the track. If the plank was worn over a certain tolerance (approximately 10mm), the car would be deemed illegal. This wooden plank remains under F1 cars today.|$|R

50|$|Secondly, {{designers}} exploit {{a property}} of air cavities known as Helmholtz resonance. Flow through the <b>airbox</b> is optimal at its resonance frequency, which depends on <b>airbox</b> volume and the inlet area {{and length of}} the snorkel.

25|$|Named to honour the company's twenty-fifth anniversary, in 1988, the 25th Anniversary Countach, {{although}} mechanically {{very similar}} to the 5000QV, sported considerable restyling. Notably, restyling, enlargement and extension of the rear 'air-box' intake-ducts was among other refinements undertaken (extending them to a more gradual incline further in-keeping with aerodynamic-streamlining), while the secondary pair of debossed ducts, originally situated further behind them, were brought forward and relocated directly on top, encompassing refashioned fins now running longitudinally rather than transversely, this allowed the <b>airboxes,</b> located behind the radiators to be rotated from a transverse to a longitudinal position, allowing better airflow from the radiators out through the secondary fins. Additionally, further reconstruction of an already modified engine-bay cover, from a concept consisting of dual-raised sections and tri-ducting, to one that embodies a centre-raised section incorporating dual-ducting become another feature. Various redevelopments to the rear-end were made; most notably the introduction of a rear bumper extending outwardly from the lower-portion.|$|R
5000|$|There {{was also}} a {{specialised}} E60 AMG model built in very limited numbers from 1994 to 1995 which had the 6.0L V8 engine. The vehicle had a 381bhp and can reach 0-60 mph within 5.3 seconds. The vehicle was equipped with the [...] "Limited" [...] sports interior, 17" [...] EVO-II alloys together with uprated AMG sports suspension and AMG twin outlet exhaust system. Otherwise, the brakes and body remained the same. The E500 and E60 AMG both came with the flared front and rear wheel arches with larger front bumpers and front foglights. The [...] "957" [...] AMG Technology Package in the VIN number of the vehicle almost guarantees the vehicle is an original E60 as left the factory. Very many E500's have been converted to E60's by changing the engine out for the 6.0L V8. Another giveaway is the AMG engine stamps saying [...] "M 119 E 60" [...] together with [...] "AMG" [...] written along the <b>airboxes</b> instead of [...] "Mercedes-Benz".|$|R
5|$|Once the 1976 Formula One World Championship season {{got under}} way Pryce {{instantly}} added a second podium finish to his tally, at the first round in Brazil. This came {{at the expense of}} continuing team mate Jarier, who was caught out by oil on the track from James Hunt's McLaren. Both Shadows enjoyed reasonable competitiveness during the next two races at Kyalami and Long Beach. Changes in car regulations, meaning that teams had to lower their <b>airboxes</b> and mount the cars' rear wings further forward, along with revised Goodyear tyres, meant the Shadow DN5B lost much of its competitiveness; Pryce still achieved a second points scoring finish of the season in Britain. The new Shadow DN8 was not introduced until the twelfth round at Zandvoort, where Pryce qualified the new car in third, and finished the race only one place lower in fourth: it was the last points scoring finish of his career. The Welshman finished his last full season 12th in the Drivers' Championship with 10 points, 59 points behind World Champion James Hunt.|$|R
