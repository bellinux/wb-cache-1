40|$|AbstractThis paper devoted for the {{implementation}} of a learning algorithm, utilized Artificial Neural Network (ANN), to predict the passive joint <b>angular</b> <b>positioning</b> for 3 R under-actuated serial robot. Under-actuated system has less number of actuators than the degrees of freedom; therefore, the estimating or modelling of its behaviour is difficult with many uncertainties. Thus, to overcome the disadvantages of several methods reported in literatures. A specific ANN model has been designed and trained to learn a desired set of joint <b>angular</b> <b>positions</b> for the passive joint from a given set of input torques and <b>angular</b> <b>positions</b> for the active joints over a certain period of time. ANN proposes from being free model technique. Consequently, data from sensors fixed on each joints were collected experimentally and provided for the developed ANN model. The learning algorithm can directly determine the position of its passive joint, and can, therefore, completely eliminate the need for any system modelling. Hence, this method could be generalized for the prediction of under-actuated systems behaviour. Results show a successful implementation of the learning algorithm in predicting the behaviour for 3 R underactuated robot...|$|R

METHODS: Proprioception was assessed by joint position sense (JPS), measured with an isokinetic dynamometer Biodex System 3, in twenty one females on experimental group, before 15 minutes cryotherapy (T 0) and immediately after (T 1). A control group (n= 20) performed also the JPS, but without cryotherapy influence. In both tested instance, two <b>angular</b> <b>positions</b> were evaluated (15 º and 45 º of knee flexion).

If a line is {{produced}} from {{the upper end of the}} long pier straight with the pier to a distance of 350 feet, and a line is drawn from a point in the channel opposite this point to the head of the pier, Colonel Nason says they will form an angle of twenty degrees. But the angle if measured at the pier is seven degrees; that is, we would have to move the pier seven degrees to make it exactly straight with the current. Would that make the navigation better or worse? The witnesses of the plaintiff seem to think it was only necessary to say that the pier formed an angle with the current and that settled the matter. Our more careful and accurate witnesses say that, though they had been accustomed to seeing the piers placed straight with the current, yet they could see that here the current had been made straight by us in having made this slight angle; that the water now runs just right, that it is straight and cannot be improved. They think that if the pier was changed the eddy would be divided and the navigation improved.|$|E
