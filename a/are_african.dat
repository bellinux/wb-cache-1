African Americans are the majority ethnic group in the northwestern Yazoo Delta, and the southwestern and the central parts of the state.

This group evolved from the Black separatist Nation of Islam (1930–1975). The majority of its members <b>are</b> <b>African</b> Americans. This has been a 23-year process of religious reorientation and organizational decentralization, in the course of which the group was known by other names, such as the American Muslim Mission, W.Deen Mohammed guided its members to the practice of mainstream Islam such as salat or fasting, and teaching the basic creed of Islam the shahadah.|$|E

The change coincided with what would have been the adolescence, or peak years of potential criminality, of those who had not been born as a result of Roe v. Wade and similar cases.
