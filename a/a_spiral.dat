5|$|<b>A</b> <b>spiral</b> {{galaxy is}} {{organized}} into a flat, rotating disk, usually with a prominent bulge or {{bar at the}} center, and trailing bright arms that spiral outward. The arms are dusty regions of star formation within which massive young stars produce a blue tint. Spiral galaxies are typically surrounded by a halo of older stars. Both the Milky Way {{and one of our}} nearest galaxy neighbors, the Andromeda Galaxy, are spiral galaxies.|$|E
5|$|Active {{elliptical}} galaxies of a form {{similar to}} M87 {{are believed to}} form {{as a result of}} one or more mergers between smaller galaxies. There is now little dust remaining to form the diffuse nebulae where new stars were created, so the stellar population is dominated by old, population II stars that contain relatively low abundances of elements other than hydrogen and helium. M87's elliptical shape is maintained by random orbital motions of its member stars, in contrast to the more orderly rotational motions found in <b>a</b> <b>spiral</b> galaxy such as the Milky Way.|$|E
5|$|All {{but one of}} the trams had a SV36-bogie from Strømmens Værksted. The two bogies, {{each with}} two axles, were {{attached}} to the steel crossbeam. The aluminium body was attached to the crossbeam with leaf springs. The bogie frames were fastened to the axle box via a revolute joint and <b>a</b> <b>spiral</b> spring. Each bogie had two motors, each controlling one axle. In 1941, no. 187 was equipped with a SV41-bogie from Strømmen; it had a different spring system that allowed the tram to remain at the same height independent of the weight.|$|E
50|$|NGC 2841 is <b>a</b> giant <b>spiral</b> galaxy with {{properties}} {{similar to}} those of the Andromeda Galaxy. It is <b>a</b> prototypical flocculent <b>spiral</b> galaxy, <b>a</b> type of <b>spiral</b> galaxy whose arms are patchy and discontinuous.|$|R

5|$|Antlia is a faint constellation; its {{brightest}} star is Alpha Antliae, an orange giant {{that is a}} suspected variable star, ranging between apparent magnitudes 4.22 and 4.29. S Antliae is an eclipsing binary star system, changing in brightness as one star passes {{in front of the}} other. Sharing a common envelope, the stars are so close they will one day merge to form a single star. Two star systems with known exoplanets, HD 93083 and WASP-66, lie within Antlia, as do NGC 2997, <b>a</b> <b>spiral</b> galaxy, and the Antlia Dwarf Galaxy.|$|E

50|$|NGC 4444 is <b>an</b> {{intermediate}} <b>spiral</b> {{galaxy in}} the constellation Centaurus. The morphological classification places it midway on the continuum between <b>a</b> barred <b>spiral</b> (SB) and <b>an</b> unbarred <b>spiral</b> (SA), with <b>an</b> inner region that lies between a ring-like (r) and <b>a</b> purely <b>spiral</b> form (s), and medium- (b) to loosely wound (c) outer spiral arms. This makes it a hybrid ringed, barred spiral galaxy. It has an angular size of 2.4 &times; 1.6 arcminutes and the estimated mass M is given log M = 9.76, yielding 5.8 billion solar masses.|$|R
5|$|Cartilaginous fish (sharks and rays) {{have a more}} {{advanced}} immune system.

These organs house typical immune cells (granulocytes, lymphocytes and plasma cells). They also possess an identifiable thymus and a well-developed spleen (their most important immune organ) where various lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages develop and are stored.|$|E
