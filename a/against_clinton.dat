5|$|In America, {{neoconservative}} {{aspirations to}} use the United States' military power to further destroy evildoers are thrown off track by the election of George H. W. Bush to the presidency, followed by the election in 1992 of Bill Clinton which left them totally out of power. The neoconservatives, along with their conservative Christian allies, attempt to demonize Clinton throughout his presidency with various real and fabricated stories of corruption and immorality. To their disappointment, the American people do not turn <b>against</b> <b>Clinton.</b> Meanwhile, Islamist attempts at revolution end in massive bloodshed, leaving the Islamists without popular support. Zawahiri and bin Laden flee to the relative safety of Afghanistan and declare a new strategy. To fight Western-inspired moral decay, they must deal a blow to its source: the United States.|$|E

25|$|In the Electoral College vote on December 19, seven electors {{voted against}} their pledged candidates: two against Trump and five <b>against</b> <b>Clinton.</b> A further three electors {{attempted}} to vote <b>against</b> <b>Clinton</b> but were replaced or forced to vote again. Ultimately, Trump received 304 electoral votes and Clinton garnered 227, while Colin Powell won three, and John Kasich, Ron Paul, Bernie Sanders, and Faith Spotted Eagle each received one. Trump {{is the fifth}} person in U.S. history to become president while losing the nationwide popular vote. He is the first president without any prior experience in public service or the military, {{as well as the}} wealthiest and the oldest at inauguration, while Clinton was the first woman to be the presidential nominee of a major American party.|$|E
25|$|Byrd {{initially}} {{said that}} the impeachment proceedings <b>against</b> <b>Clinton</b> should be taken seriously.

Even though he voted against both articles of impeachment, he was the sole Democrat to vote to censure Clinton.|$|E
25|$|As {{with many}} {{controversial}} figures, Kenneth Starr {{has been the}} subject of political satire. The book, And the Horse He Rode In On, by James Carville, attempts to portray Starr's time as special prosecutor in a comedic, negative light. At the end of his tenure at Baylor, many have called Starr a hypocrite for playing a role in covering up the Baylor Football sex scandal, considering how harshly he stood <b>against</b> <b>Clinton</b> in regards to Clinton's scandal.|$|E

25|$|Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman John Kerry {{stated that}} he {{expected}} Clinton to face some tough questions, but {{thought she was going}} to do a good job at (being Secretary of State). Christopher Hitchens of Vanity Fair called her nomination a ludicrous embarrassment on the edition of November 18, 2008 of Hardball due to the Clintons' overseas connections, her actions during the 2008 Democratic Presidential Primary. Senator John Cornyn (R-Texas) voted against a unanimous voice approval, citing ethical concerns. He sought not to block the nomination through a filibuster, but to voice his opposition to her policies. Senator David Vitter (R-Louisiana) also voted <b>against</b> <b>Clinton</b> in Committee citing her husband's foreign donations for his non-profit entities.|$|E
25|$|The 2016 {{elections}} {{took place}} on November 8. Obama was term-limited in 2016 due to the 22nd Amendment, though Obama's approval ratings may have impacted his party's ability to win the race. In June 2016, with the Democratic primaries nearly complete, Obama endorsed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as his successor. However, according to Glenn Thrush of Politico, Obama had long supported Clinton as his preferred successor, and Obama dissuaded Vice President Biden from running <b>against</b> <b>Clinton.</b> Obama spoke in favor of Clinton at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, and he continued to campaign for Clinton and other Democrats {{in the months leading}} up to Election Day. However, in the general election, Clinton was defeated by Republican nominee Donald Trump, who prominently questioned Obama's place of birth during Obama's first term. Republicans also retained control of the House and Senate. During the eight years of Obama's presidency, the Democratic Party experienced a net loss of 1,041 governorships and state and federal legislative seats. Ronald Brownstein of The Atlantic noted that these losses were similar to those of other post-World War II two-term presidents.|$|E
500|$|After the 1998 elections, the House impeached Clinton, alleging {{perjury and}} {{obstruction}} of justice related to the Lewinsky scandal. Clinton was only the second U.S. president to be impeached, after Andrew Johnson. Impeachment proceedings were based on allegations that Clinton had illegally lied about and covered up his relationship with 22-year-old White House (and later Department of Defense) employee Monica Lewinsky. After the Starr Report was submitted to the House providing what it termed [...] "substantial and credible information that President Clinton Committed Acts that May Constitute Grounds for an Impeachment", the House began impeachment hearings <b>against</b> <b>Clinton</b> before the mid-term elections. To hold impeachment proceedings, the Republican leadership called a lame-duck session in December 1998.|$|E

500|$|Clinton {{was elected}} Governor of Arkansas in 1978, having {{defeated}} the Republican candidate Lynn Lowe, a farmer from Texarkana. At age 32, {{he became the}} youngest governor in the country. Due to his youthful appearance, Clinton was often called the [...] "Boy Governor". He worked on educational reform and directed the maintenance of Arkansas's roads, with wife Hillary leading a successful committee on urban health care reform. However, his term included an unpopular motor vehicle tax and citizens' anger over the escape of Cuban refugees (from the Mariel boatlift) detained in Fort Chaffee in 1980. Monroe Schwarzlose of Kingsland in Cleveland County, polled 31percent of the vote <b>against</b> <b>Clinton</b> in the Democratic gubernatorial primary of 1980. Some suggested Schwarzlose's unexpected voter turnout foreshadowed Clinton's defeat by Republican challenger Frank D. White {{in the general election}} that year. As Clinton once joked, he was the youngest ex-governor in the nation's history.|$|E
500|$|In 1994, Paula Jones {{initiated}} {{a sexual harassment}} lawsuit <b>against</b> <b>Clinton,</b> claiming that he made unwanted advances towards her in 1991; Clinton denied the allegations. In April 1998, the case was initially dismissed by Judge Susan Webber Wright {{on the grounds that}} it lacked legal merit. Jones appealed Webber Wright's ruling, and her suit gained traction following Clinton's admission to having an affair with Monica Lewinsky in August 1998. In 1998, lawyers for Paula Jones released court documents that alleged a pattern of sexual harassment by Clinton when he was Governor of Arkansas. Robert S. Bennett, Clinton's main lawyer for the case, called the filing [...] "a pack of lies" [...] and [...] "an organized campaign to smear the President of the United States" [...] funded by Clinton's political enemies. Clinton later agreed to an out-of-court settlement and paid Jones $850,000. Bennett said that the president made the settlement only so he could end the lawsuit for good and move on with his life. During the deposition for the Jones lawsuit, which was held at the White House, Clinton denied having sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky – a denial that became the basis for an impeachment charge of perjury.|$|E

2500|$|For alleged {{misconduct}} {{during his}} governorship Paula Jones brought {{a sexual harassment}} lawsuit <b>against</b> <b>Clinton</b> while he was president. Clinton argued that as a sitting president, {{he should not be}} vulnerable to a civil suit of this nature. The case landed in the U.S. Supreme Court. The Supreme Court held that [...] "Deferral of this litigation until petitioner's Presidency ends is not constitutionally required." ...|$|E
2500|$|Morella {{came under}} greater {{pressure}} after her party {{took control of}} the House in 1994 Congressional elections. Although she signed the Contract with America developed by Newt Gingrich, she had a mixed record supporting the subsequent Republican majority in Congress. She did not openly challenge the new House leadership until 1997 when she voted [...] "present" [...] for Speaker of the House instead of for the incumbent, Newt Gingrich. In 1998, she was one of four Republicans, along with Amo Houghton and Peter T. King of New York and Chris Shays of Connecticut, to oppose all four articles of impeachment <b>against</b> <b>Clinton</b> during the Lewinsky scandal.|$|E
2500|$|Regardless, Paul's {{claims have}} not found traction. An audit by the Federal Elections Commission found that neither Senator Clinton nor her Senate {{campaign}} had accepted any illegal funds {{in connection with the}} Hollywood fundraiser, though the campaign was asked to pay $35,000 in fines for having under-reported the cost of the party. Paul's suit against the FEC was thrown out; his attempt to bring ethics charges <b>against</b> <b>Clinton</b> was rejected, and his fraud charges against Senator Clinton were tossed out in April 2006. [...] Paul continued to press civil charges against Senator Clinton and former President Clinton for [...] "looting" [...] his business, but the courts refused to allow him to sue Senator Clinton, with the appellate court specifying that her behavior had been “perfectly legal”, and allowing her to recoup her legal fees from Paul.|$|E

2500|$|Bill Clinton's {{impeachment}} and the {{sex scandal}} {{that led up}} to it cast a shadow on the campaign, particularly on his vice president's run to replace him. Republicans strongly denounced the Clinton scandals, particularly Bush, who made his repeated promise to restore [...] "honor and dignity" [...] to the White House a centerpiece of his campaign. Gore studiously avoided the Clinton scandals, as did Lieberman, even though Lieberman had been the first Democratic senator to denounce Clinton's misbehavior. In fact, some media observers theorized that Gore actually chose Lieberman in an attempt to separate himself from Clinton's past misdeeds, and help blunt the GOP's attempts to link him to his boss. Others pointed to the passionate kiss Gore gave his wife during the Democratic Convention, as a signal that despite the allegations <b>against</b> <b>Clinton,</b> Gore himself was a faithful husband. Gore avoided appearing with Clinton, who was shunted to low visibility appearances in areas where he was popular. Experts have argued that this could have cost Gore votes from some of Clinton's core supporters.|$|E
2500|$|Use <b>against</b> <b>Clinton</b> of the [...] "bitch" [...] epithet flourished {{during the}} campaign, {{especially}} on the Internet but via conventional media as well. [...] Hundreds of YouTube videos carried the word, with such titles as [...] "Hillary Clinton: The Bitch is Back" [...] and [...] "Hillary Clinton: Crazy Bitch", and a Facebook groups with the theme proliferated, including one named [...] "Life's a Bitch, Why Vote for One?" [...] that had more than 1,500 members. [...] Broadcaster Glenn Beck used the term in describing her. In a November 2007 public appearance, John McCain was asked {{by one of his}} supporters, [...] "How do we beat the bitch?" [...] (McCain responded by saying, [...] "May I give the translation?" [...] and then went on to say he respected Clinton but could defeat her.) [...] A February 2008 Saturday Night Live monologue by Tina Fey led a backlash-through-embracing movement, when she said [...] "I think what bothers me the most is when people say that Hillary is a bitch. Let me say something about that. Yeah, she is. And so am I.... You know what? Bitches get stuff done.... Get on board. Bitch is the new black!" [...] A new Facebook group [...] "Bitch is the new Black" [...] gained three times the membership of all the anti-Clinton groups named after the word.|$|E
2500|$|After Obama's upset win in Iowa, it {{appeared}} to many political observers that he would ride a wave of momentum through the New Hampshire primaries and then onward to win the Democratic nomination. Eulogies were published on the Clinton campaign, as Obama surged to a roughly 10-point lead in the New Hampshire polls. However, the race turned quickly {{in the days before}} the primary, and the polls were slow to register a reversal toward Clinton. At the Saint Anselm College New Hampshire debate on [...] January 5, 2008, Edwards sided with Obama <b>against</b> <b>Clinton.</b> In one noted exchange, Edwards said that Clinton could not bring about change, while he and Obama could: [...] "Any time you speak out powerfully for change, the forces for status quo attack." [...] Clinton passionately retorted, [...] "Making change is not about what you believe; it's not about a speech you make. It's about working hard. I'm not just running on a promise for change. I'm running on 35 years of change. What we need is somebody who can deliver change. We don't need to be raising false hopes." [...] It came to be seen as the defining statement for her candidacy. The morning before the primary, Clinton became [...] "visibly emotional" [...] in response to a friendly question from a voter. Video of the moment was replayed on cable news television throughout the day, accompanied by pundit commentary that ranged from sympathetic to callous in tone. Voters rallied to Clinton's defense, and she won a surprising three-percent victory over Obama in the popular vote. They tied in the delegate count. Richardson withdrew from the race on January 10.|$|E
25|$|Paul {{alleged that}} Clinton was {{deceitful}} in this, and retained public interest law firm, and frequent Clinton opponent, Judicial Watch to represent {{him in a}} series of civil and criminal lawsuits <b>against</b> the <b>Clintons,</b> the Clinton campaign, and ultimately the Federal Election Commission (which he charged was negligent in failing to convict Mrs. Clinton). These charges were delayed, as courts held that Paul could not bring charges <b>against</b> the <b>Clintons</b> as he fought extradition from Brazil (to which he had fled in 2001 to escape Stan-Lee-Media-related criminal charges, see below), but proceeded once he was returned to the States.|$|R
