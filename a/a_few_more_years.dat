5|$|While doing {{research}} for his decorations, he read in an American magazine the article Comics in your Life. Fascinated, Vandersteen searched {{for more information}} on the subject. He rediscovered Hergé with The Adventures of Tintin in Le Petit Vingtième, but also the realistic work of Hal Foster in Prince Valiant. But it took <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>years</b> before this fascination translated into steady publication of his own comics. Meanwhile, his first published drawings appeared in Entre Nous, the internal magazine of L'Innovation.|$|E
5|$|Mary {{was summoned}} {{to the court of}} her {{grandfather}} Maximilian in 1514. On 22 July 1515, Mary and Louis were married in St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna. At the same time, Louis' sister Anne was betrothed to an as yet unspecified brother of Mary, with Emperor Maximilian acting as proxy. Due to their age, it was decided that the newly married couple would not live together for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>years.</b> Anne eventually married Mary's brother Ferdinand and came to Vienna, where the double sisters-in-law were educated together until 1516. That year, Mary's father-in-law died, making Louis and Mary king and queen of Hungary and Bohemia. Mary moved to Innsbruck, where she was educated until 1521. Maximilian encouraged her interest in hunting, while childhood lessons prompted an interest in music. This passion would later be demonstrated during her tenure as governor of the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|Howard Browne, who {{had been}} on a leave of absence from Ziff-Davis to write fiction, took over as editor and began by {{throwing}} away 300,000 words of inventory that Palmer had acquired before he left. Browne had ambitions of moving Amazing upmarket, and his argument was strengthened by Street & Smith, one of the longest established and most respected publishers, who shut down all of their pulp magazines in the summer of 1949. The pulps were dying, {{largely as a result of}} the success of pocketbooks, and Street & Smith decided to concentrate on their slick magazines. Some pulps struggled on for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>years,</b> but Browne was able to persuade Ziff and Davis that the future was in the slicks, and they raised his fiction budget from one cent to a ceiling of five cents per word. Browne managed to get promises of new stories from many well-known authors, including Isaac Asimov and Theodore Sturgeon. He produced a dummy issue in April 1950, and planned to launch the new incarnation of Amazing in April 1951, the 25th anniversary of the first issue. However, the economic impact of the Korean War, which broke out in June 1950, led to budget cuts. The plans were cancelled, and Ziff-Davis never revived the idea.|$|E

5|$|Starting in 1895, Enrico Dandolo was {{extensively}} modernized, {{receiving an}} entirely new armament and new engines, {{as well as a}} second military mast. Caio Duilio received a much more limited refit in 1900, primarily receiving a large number of secondary guns. The Navy decided against rebuilding her along the same lines as Enrico Dandolo due to the prohibitive cost of the project. In 1902, Caio Diulio was removed from front-line service and thereafter employed as a training ship. Enrico Dandolo followed her in 1905 for service as a gunnery training vessel. In 1909, Caio Duilio was stricken from the naval register, disarmed, and converted into a floating oil tank. Her ultimate fate is unknown. Enrico Dandolo continued on in service for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>years,</b> first becoming a guard ship at Tobruk, Libya in 1913. After Italy entered World War I in May 1915, she was transferred to Brindisi and later Venice, where she continued guard ship duties. She was stricken in January 1920 and broken up for scrap.|$|E

5000|$|A hopeful pessimist, Greeman posited {{the odds}} on human society {{surviving}} capitalism's economic and ecological crises until 2100 as a nominal {{one in a}} hundred.

Mathematically, the leap to Ecotopia is Bet We Can’t Refuse.’ Following Pascal and Marx he asked: ‘What have we left to lose but <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> desperate <b>years</b> of struggling to survive in an increasingly violent, unhealthy, unequal, disintegrating society?’ Not much, with a beautiful green world to win (and heal)!’ ...|$|R

50|$|The bodhisattvas who {{accompany}} him are usually Avalokitesvara on the Buddha's right, and Mahasthamaprapta on his left. Avalokitesvara {{can be identified}} by his headdress which holds a small image of the Buddha Amitābha, {{and the fact that}} he often carries a small water flask. Sometimes he holds a heart-shaped, or pippala-leaf shaped object (which art historians still can't positively identify). Mahasthamaprapta is slightly more difficult to identify, but this is the usual pairing with Avalokitesvara (who will, in <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hundred <b>more</b> <b>years,</b> change gender and morph into the Goddess or Bodhisattva of Mercy, Guanyin).|$|R

25|$|Whether the {{problems}} were soluble has been contentious ever since. What is undeniable is that the PRR very soon did not care; the much easier solution of the diesel locomotive was taken within months of the production locomotives being delivered, and within 2 years all principal passenger trains were diesel-hauled.
