40|$|Tifgreen {{bermudagrass}} (328) {{has been}} used for greens in the Southwest for 40 years. Decreased mowing heights desired for tournament events can result in loss of turf quality and performance. A series of mowing and rolling events were devised and executed on a Tifgreen turf mowed at 5 / 32 ", in order to minimize the potential negative affects of a reduced mowing height of 1 / 8 ". All treatments were executed prior to mowing the turf at the new reduced height of 1 / 8 ". Significant treatment effects resulted from combinations of mowing and rolling for ball speed distance, when averaged over three evaluation dates. When averaged over all three evaluation dates, the single mow/no <b>roll</b> treatment [1 <b>x</b> mow/ 0 roll] had the least ball roll distance (BRD) values. Mowing/rolling combinations which resulted in either three or four operations on Day 1 (1 x mow/ 2 <b>x</b> <b>roll,</b> 2 <b>x</b> mow/ 2 <b>x</b> <b>roll</b> and 2 <b>x</b> mow/ 1 <b>x</b> <b>roll)</b> had slightly greater BRD values than the operations which included two operations (2 x mow/ 0 <b>x</b> <b>roll</b> and 1 <b>x</b> mow/ 1 <b>x</b> <b>roll).</b> BRD values decreased from Day 1, Day 2 and Day 4 from 81. 2 ", 80. 3 " to 73. 4 ", respectively when average over all treatments. Single mowing at 5 / 32 ", followed by either a double or single rolling event prior to mowing to the new height of 1 / 8 " on Day 1, resulted in the longest BRD values for Days 1 and 2.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel theory and method {{to calculate the}} canonical labelings of digraphs whose definition is entirely different from the traditional definition of Nauty. It indicates the mutual relationships that exist between the canonical labeling of a digraph and the canonical labeling of its complement graph. It systematically examines the link between computing the canonical labeling of a digraph and the k-neighborhood and k-mix-neighborhood subdigraphs. To facilitate the presentation, it introduces several concepts including mix diffusion outdegree sequence and entire mix diffusion outdegree sequences. For each node in a digraph G, it assigns an attribute m_NearestNode to enhance the accuracy of calculating canonical labeling. The four theorems proved here demonstrate how to determine the first nodes added into M <b>a</b> <b>x</b> Q (G). Further, the other two theorems stated below deal with identifying the second nodes added into M <b>a</b> <b>x</b> Q (G). When computing C m <b>a</b> <b>x</b> (G), if M <b>a</b> <b>x</b> Q (G) already contains the first i vertices u 1, u 2, ⋯, u i, Diffusion Theorem provides a guideline on how to choose the subsequent node of M <b>a</b> <b>x</b> Q (G). Besides, the Mix Diffusion Theorem shows that {{the selection of the}} (i + 1) th vertex of M <b>a</b> <b>x</b> Q (G) for computing C m <b>a</b> <b>x</b> (G) is from the open mix-neighborhood subdigraph N + + (Q) of the nodes set Q = { u 1, u 2, ⋯, u i }. It also offers two theorems to calculate the C m <b>a</b> <b>x</b> (G) of the disconnected digraphs. The four algorithms implemented in it illustrate how to calculate M <b>a</b> <b>x</b> Q (G) of a digraph. Through software testing, the correctness of our algorithms is preliminarily verified. Our method can be utilized to mine the frequent subdigraph. We also guess that if there exists a vertex v ∈ S + (G) satisfying conditions C m <b>a</b> <b>x</b> (G − v) ⩽ C m <b>a</b> <b>x</b> (G − w) for each w ∈ S + (G) ∧ w ≠ v, then u 1 = v for M <b>a</b> <b>x</b> Q (G) ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{cells in}} the {{preimplantation}} mammalian embryo undergo several rounds of fast cell division. Whether the known DNA repair pathways are active during these early stages of development where cell division is of primary importance, has not been fully established. Because of {{the important role of}} phosphorylated H 2 <b>A.</b> <b>X</b> (gammaH 2 <b>A.</b> <b>X)</b> in the DNA damage response as well as its putative role in assembly of embryonic chromatin, we analysed its distribution in the preimplantation mouse embryo. We found that H 2 <b>A.</b> <b>X</b> is highly phosphorylated throughout preimplantation development {{in the absence of any}} induced DNA damage. Moreover, gammaH 2 <b>A.</b> <b>X</b> levels vary significantly throughout the cell cycle. Interestingly, after the 4 -cell stage, we detected high levels of H 2 <b>A.</b> <b>X</b> phosphorylation in mitosis, where telomeres appeared focally enriched with gammaH 2 <b>A.</b> <b>X.</b> In contrast, 53 BP 1, which is known to be recruited to DNA damage sites, is undetectable at mitotic chromosomes at these stages and its localisation changes upon blastocyst formation from mainly nuclear to cytoplasmic. We also show that 53 BP 1 and gammaH 2 <b>A.</b> <b>X</b> rarely colocalise, suggesting that the high levels of phosphorylation of H 2 <b>A.</b> <b>X</b> in the embryo might not be directly linked to the DNA damage response in the embryo. Our data suggest that phosphorylation of H 2 <b>A.</b> <b>X</b> is <b>an</b> important event in the fast dividing cells of the early embryo in the absence of any induced DNA damage.

40|$|ATP is {{required}} for physiological nucleosome alignment in chromatin reconstituted from high-speed nuclear supernatants of Xenopus laevis oocytes. Here we show that during in vitro nucleosome assembly the histone variant H 2 <b>A.</b> <b>X</b> becomes phosphorylated upon transfer onto DNA, a process which is also observed in vivo. Histone H 2 <b>A.</b> <b>X</b> phosphorylation increases in the early phase of the assembly reaction, reaching a steady state after approximately 16 min and is maintained with a half-life of the phosphate groups of approximately 2 h. After 6 h, the overall phosphorylation state of H 2 <b>A.</b> <b>X</b> is reduced, indicating that the phosphorylation-dephosphorylation ratio decreases considerably over time. Addition of alkaline phosphatase leads to a persistently lowered state of H 2 <b>A.</b> <b>X</b> phosphorylation, in contrast to other nuclear phosphoproteins which undergo rapid rephosphorylation. This suggests that H 2 <b>A.</b> <b>X</b> phosphorylation is <b>a</b> unique step in the histone-to-DNA transfer process.
