5000|$|Lattice delay {{networks}} {{are an important}} subgroup of lattice networks. They are all-pass filters, {{so they have a}} flat amplitude response, but a phase response which varies linearly (or almost linearly) with frequency. All lattice circuits, regardless of their complexity, are based on the schematic shown below, which contains two series impedances, Za, and two shunt impedances, Zb. Although there is duplication of impedances in this arrangement, it offers great flexibility to the circuit designer so that, in addition to its use as delay network (as featured here) it can be configured to be a phase corrector, [...] a dispersive network, an <b>amplitude</b> <b>equalizer,</b> or a low pass (or bandpass) filter, according to the choice of components for the lattice elements [...] It is shown in Lattice networks that when a lattice is configured as a delay network, it has a characteristic impedance which is resistive (= Ro), its impedances Za and Zb are dual impedances, i.e. Za&middot;Zb = Ro2 [...] (or Za/Ro = Ro/Zb) and Za and Zb consist of inductors and capacitors. Such a lattice is a constant resistance network and an all-pass filter, and it has a phase response determined by the properties of Za. This makes it ideal as a delay device because it can be included in a cascade of other filter sections without affecting the overall amplitude response, nor will it create mismatch problems, but it will increase the phase slope (i.e. the delay) of the overall assembly.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} method {{of design and}} {{optimization}} of stable IIR digital filters with non-standard amplitude characteristics using continuous ant colony optimization algorithm ACOR is presented. In proposed method (named ACO-IIRFD) dynamical changes of parameters in designed filters are introduced. Due to these dynamical changes of filter parameters, design of IIR digital filters with small deviations between designed filter characteristics and assumed characteristics is possible. Three IIR digital filters with amplitude characteristics: linearly-falling, linearly-growing, and non-linearly-growing, which can have application in <b>amplitude</b> <b>equalizers,</b> are designed using proposed method. ...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [88]) This thesis proposes {{methods to}} design and synthesize audio equalizers with a practical equalizer order. In order to prevent the equalizers from boosting the signals in some frequency regions, we clip the peak portions of the <b>equalizer’s</b> <b>amplitude</b> response and re-synthesize the equalizer based on the artificial spectrum. In this research, four different techniques are used to synthesize the equalizer, but only two of them — the REMEZ equalizer and the FSF (Frequency Sampling Filtering) equalizer — have acceptable performance. The REMEZ equalizer is an FIR equalizer with linear phase, while the FSF equalizer is a structure of the HR filter bank. Both the REMEZ and the FSF equalizers can reduce the reverberation effect with a smaller equalizer order. A useful criterion — howling margin - is {{used to evaluate the}} equalizer’s performance and to calculate the optimum threshold for clipping the amplitude response of the original equalizer. In a real-time experiment, the REMEZ equalize, which is implemented on the Analog Device SHARC DSP board, is shown to have additional howling margin {{and to be able to}} reduce the reverberation effect in an auditorium.

40|$|Medical implant sensor {{that is used}} {{to monitor}} the human {{physiology}} signals is helpful {{to improve the quality of}} life and prevent severe result from the chronic diseases. In order to achieve this, the wireless implant communication link that delivers the monitored signal to a multiple antennas external device is an essential portion. However, the existing conventional narrow band Medical Implant Communications System (MICS) has low data rate because of the bandlimited channel is allocated. To improve the data rate in the radio frequency communication, ultra-wide band technology has been proposed. However, the ultra-wide band technology is relatively new and requires living human to be the test subject in order to validate the technology performance. In this condition, the test on the new technology can rise ethical challenge. As a solution, we improve the data rate in the conventional narrow band MICS. The improvement of data rate on the narrow band implies the information bandwidth is larger than the allocated channel bandwidth, and therefore the high frequency components of the information can loss. In this case, the signal suffers the intersymbol-interference (ISI). Instead of that, the multiple antennas external device can receive the signal from other transmitting implant sensor which has the same operating frequency. As a result, the signal is further hampered by co-channel interference (CCI). To recover the signal from the ISI and CCI, multiple-input multiple output (MIMO) blind equalization that has source separation ability can be exploited. Cross-Correlation Constant Modulus Algorithm (CC-CMA) is the conventional MIMO blind equalization algorithm that can suppress ISI and CCI and able to perform source separation. However, CC-CMA has only been analyzed and simulated in the modulation of Phase Shift Keying (PSK). The performance of CC-CMA in multi-modulus modulation scheme such as 4 -Pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM) and 16 -Quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), which has higher data rate than PSK, has not been analyzed. Therefore, our work is to analysis and optimize CC-CMA on the multi-modulus modulation scheme. From our analysis, we found that the cost function of CC-CMA is biased cost function. Instead of that, from our simulation, CC-CMA introduces an unexpected shrinking effect whereby the <b>amplitudes</b> of the <b>equalizer</b> outputs have been reduced, especially in multi-modulus modulation scheme. This shrinking effect is not severe in PSK because the decision of a PSK symbol is based on phase, but not amplitude. Unfortunately, this is severe in multi-modulus modulation scheme. To overcome this shrinking effect in multi-modulus modulation scheme, we propose Cross-Independent Constant Modulus Algorithm (CI-CMA). Based on the convergence analysis, we identify the new optimum dispersion value and mixing parameter in CI-CMA. From the simulation results, we confirm that CI-CMA is able to perform equalization and source separation in the multi-modulus modulation scheme. In order to improve the steady state performance of CI-CMA, we perform the steady state mean square error (MSE) analysis of CI-CMA using the energy preservation theorem that was developed by Mai and Sayed in 2001, and our result is more accurate than the previous work. From our analysis, only the reduction in adaptation step size can reduce the steady state MSE, but it is well known that the MSE is indeed a tradeoff with the speed of convergence. Therefore without sacrificing convergence speed, our last effort is to propose hybrid algorithms. The hybrid algorithms are done by combining a new adaptive constant modulus algorithm (ACMA), a decision directed algorithm and a cross-correlation function. From the simulation results, we found that the hybrid algorithms can show low steady state error and thereby improve the reliability of the communication link. The main achievement of this thesis is the discovery of new dispersion value through the convergence analysis...|$|R
30|$|Channel {{equalization}} in {{filter bank}} based multicarrier (FBMC) modulation is addressed. We utilize an efficient oversampled filter bank concept with 2 x-oversampled subcarrier signals {{that can be}} equalized independently of each other. Due to Nyquist pulse shaping, consecutive symbol waveforms overlap in time, which calls for special means for equalization. Two alternative linear low-complexity subcarrier equalizer structures are developed together with straightforward channel estimation-based methods to calculate the equalizer coefficients using pointwise equalization within each subband (in a frequency-sampled manner). A novel structure, consisting of a linear-phase FIR <b>amplitude</b> <b>equalizer</b> and an allpass filter as phase equalizer, is found to provide enhanced robustness to timing estimation errors. This allows the receiver to be operated without time synchronization before the filter bank. The coded error-rate performance of FBMC with the studied equalization scheme is compared to a cyclic prefix OFDM reference in wireless mobile channel conditions, taking into account issues like spectral regrowth with practical nonlinear transmitters and sensitivity to frequency offsets. It is further emphasized that FBMC provides flexible means for high-quality frequency selective filtering in the receiver to suppress strong interfering spectral components within or close to the used frequency band.|$|E
40|$|This book {{discusses}} the trade-offs involved in designing direct RF digitization receivers for the radio frequency and {{digital signal processing}} domains.  A system-level framework is developed, quantifying the relevant impairments of the signal processing chain, through a comprehensive system-level analysis.   Special focus is given to noise analysis (thermal noise, quantization noise, saturation noise, signal-dependent noise), broadband non-linear distortion analysis, including {{the impact of the}} sampling strategy (low-pass, band-pass), analysis of time-interleaved ADC channel mismatches, sampling clock purity and digital channel selection. The system-level framework described is applied to the design of a cable multi-channel RF direct digitization receiver. An optimum RF signal conditioning, and some algorithms (automatic gain control loop, RF front-end amplitude equalization control loop) are used to relax the requirements of a 2. 7 GHz 11 -bit ADC. A two-chip implementation is presented, using BiCMOS and 65 nm CMOS processes, together with the block and system-level measurement results. Readers will benefit from the techniques presented, which are highly competitive, both in terms of cost and RF performance, while drastically reducing power consumption.  ·         Provides system-level analysis of direct RF sampling & digitization receivers, from the antenna to the digital channel selection; ·         Includes analysis of broadband non-linearity, applicable for low-pass and band-pass sampling strategies; Describes system-level design of an application-optimized signal conditioner, including a single-inductance multi-slope programmable RF <b>amplitude</b> <b>equalizer,</b> together with its control algorithm and a mixed-signal AGC loop combining RMS and peak detection. ...|$|E
