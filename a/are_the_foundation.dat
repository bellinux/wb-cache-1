Inspired by Jean-Jacques Rousseau's depictions of the ideal family and the republican Swiss canton, she draws a picture of idyllic family life in a small country village. [...] One scholar describes her plan this way: [...] "vast estates would be divided into small farms, cottagers {{would be allowed to}} make enclosures from the commons and, instead of alms being given to the poor, they would be given the means to independence and self-advancement." [...] Individuals would learn and practice virtue in the home, virtue that would not only make them self-sufficient, but also prompt them to feel responsible for the citizens of their society.|$|E
