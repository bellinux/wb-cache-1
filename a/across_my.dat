500|$|At {{this stage}} Darwin had an acute {{interest}} in island biogeography, and {{his description of}} St Helena as [...] "a little centre of creation" [...] in his geological diary reflects Charles Lyell's speculation in Volume 2 of Principles of Geology that the island would have acted as a [...] "focus of creative force". He later recalled believing in the permanence of species, but [...] "as far as I can remember, vague doubts occasionally flitted <b>across</b> <b>my</b> mind". When organising his Ornithological Notes between mid June and August, Darwin expanded on his initial notes on the Galapagos mockingbird Mimus thenca: ...|$|E
500|$|... "The general discontent I {{felt with}} woman's portion as wife, housekeeper, physician, and spiritual guide, the chaotic {{conditions}} into which everything fell without her constant supervision, and the wearied, anxious {{look of the}} majority of women, impressed me with a strong feeling that some active measures should be taken to remedy the wrongs of society in general, and of women in particular. My experience at the World Anti-slavery Convention, all I had read of the legal status of women, and the oppression I saw everywhere, together swept <b>across</b> <b>my</b> soul, intensified now by many personal experiences. It seemed as if all the elements had conspired to impel me to some onward step. I could not see what to do or where to begin—my only thought was a public meeting for protest and discussion." ...|$|E

500|$|The next month, Hunter {{participated in}} the third GOP debate, {{featured}} on CNN. During the forum, he discussed his experience {{as chairman of the}} Armed Services Committee and voiced his support for the War in Iraq and the training of Iraqi battalions for security there. Hunter speculated that Iran was helping to arm the insurgency in Iraq. When asked what he would do as president if he discovered Iran was developing a nuclear weapon, Hunter stated that he [...] "would authorize the use of tactical nuclear weapons [...] if {{there was no other way}} to preempt..." [...] After discussing foreign policy, Hunter turned his attention to the issue of immigration. He again mentioned the importance of a border wall and evoked the audience's memory about the fence he helped build in his congressional district, joking [...] "if they (illegal immigrants) get <b>across</b> <b>my</b> fence , we sign them up for the Olympics immediately." [...] At the end of the debate, Hunter took the opportunity to criticize the three frontrunners: John McCain, Rudy Giuliani, and Mitt Romney. He complained that Democratic Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts exerted too much influence on the three men, describing them as the [...] "Kennedy Wing of the Republican Party." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{inspiration}} for Tron occurred in 1976 when Steven Lisberger, then an animator of drawings {{with his own}} studio, looked at a sample reel from a computer firm called MAGI and saw Pong for the first time.

According to Lisberger, [...] "I realized that there were these techniques that would be very suitable for bringing video games and computer visuals to the screen.

2500|$|In 1913, Pound was {{contacted}} by the widow of the recently deceased Orientalist Ernest Fenollosa, who while in Japan had collected word-by-word translations and notes for 150 classical Chinese poems that fit in closely with this program. Chinese grammar offers different expressive possibilities from English grammar, a point that Pound subsequently made much of. For example, in Chinese, {{the first line of}} Li Po's (called [...] "Rihaku" [...] by Fenollosa's Japanese informants) poem [...] is a spare, direct juxtaposition of 5 characters that appear in Fenollosa's notes as mistress [...] hair [...] first [...] cover [...] browIn his resulting 1915 Cathay, Pound rendered this in simple English as While my hair was still cut straight <b>across</b> <b>my</b> forehead ...|$|E

2500|$|Chase J. Nielsen, {{one of the}} U.S. airmen {{who flew}} in the Doolittle raid {{following}} the attack on Pearl Harbor, was subjected to waterboarding by his Japanese captors. At their trial for war crimes following the war, he testified [...] "Well, I was put on my back {{on the floor with}} my arms and legs stretched out, one guard holding each limb. The towel was wrapped around my face and put <b>across</b> <b>my</b> face and water poured on. They poured water on this towel until I was almost unconscious from strangulation, then they would let up until I'd get my breath, then they'd start over again... I felt more or less like I was drowning, just gasping between life and death." [...] In 2007, Senator John McCain claimed that the United States military hanged Japanese soldiers for waterboarding American prisoners of war during World War II. A minimal sentence for Japanese soldiers convicted of waterboarding American soldiers was 15 years.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{critics have}} noted that Jill Murphy's The Worst Witch series (first {{published}} in 1974 by Allison & Busby), {{is set in a}} school for girls, [...] "Miss Cackle's Academy for Witches", reminiscent of Hogwarts. The story concerns an awkward pupil at a boarding-school for witches, who faces a scheming rival student. Her professors include a kindly and elderly headmistress and a bullying, raven-haired potions teacher. Murphy has commented on her frustration at constant comparisons between her work and Harry Potter: [...] "It's irritating … everyone asks the same question and I even get children writing to ask me whether I mind about the Hogwarts school of witchcraft and pointing out similarities. Even worse are reviewers who come <b>across</b> <b>my</b> books, or see the TV series, and, without taking the trouble to find out that it's now over quarter of a century since I wrote my first book, make pointed remarks about 'clever timing' – or say things like 'the Worst Witch stories are not a million miles from J K Rowling's books'. The implications are really quite insulting!" ...|$|E
