The former was Bradley's choice, but Taylor was a skilled political organizer and was able to create a strong political machine amongst the county delegations. He seemed the favorite to win the nomination.|$|E

A year later, he moved to Saint Petersburg and started working as a translator at the Finance Ministry's Foreign commerce department. Here, in the Russian capital, he became friends with the Maykov family and tutored both Apollon Maykov and Valerian Maykov in the Latin language and in Russian literature. He {{became a member of}} the elitist literary circle based in the Maykovs' house and attended by writers like Ivan Turgenev, Fyodor Dostoyevsky and Dmitry Grigorovich. The Maykovs' almanac Snowdrop featured many of Goncharov's poems, but he soon stopped dabbling in poetry altogether.

500|$|Entertainment Weekly {{contributor}} Abby West praised Angela Kinsey's performance, {{noting that}} she [...] "brought wonderful contradictions to her prickly office priss". West also enjoyed the love triangle for being [...] "so skillfully kept as the subplot it should be. It {{is as much}} due to the light touches of the three actors as to the writers... It's refreshing that Jim and Karen have mostly been so mature and honest, but that's <b>a</b> <b>sure</b> <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> the relationship will devolve, because the setup for the success for most long-term TV romances requires miscommunication and no confrontation."

At the same time, it seems inconceivable that anyone would sit down and plan something so dreadful." [...] Carole Kass of the Richmond Times-Dispatch felt that since [...] "Madonna is the idol of teen-agers. If they imitate her hair and her makeup, these 'wanna-bes' {{who want to be}} like Madonna and dress like Madonna may be cute. But, as a popular personality, Madonna has a responsibility to her fans. And shoplifting is something not to promote. Nor is smoking." [...] Dan Dinicola of The Schenectady Gazette felt that [...] "Who's That Girl is not simply an awful film, it is positively unbearable. It's a movie without a head or a brain, a picture of such crass stupidity that it can't even make you angry. Instead it numbs you to death with its moronic platitudes, its pretensions to comedy. [...] It's a vanity project which is so amateurly produced and conceived that it makes you want to cringe in shame. [...] Madonna {{is no more than a}} novelty item." [...] Johanna Steinmetz of the Chicago Tribune complimented Dunne's acting and said: [...] "Fortunately the film has Griffin Dunne. Dunne, working in a domain once ruled by Cary Grant, manages to be stuffy, naive and vulnerable but never undignified as Loudon Trott, the New York lawyer." [...] Jean Rosenbluth of Rolling Stone was harsh about the film, saying [...] "The question posed by the film's title was Who's that girl? The answer provided by the box-office receipts was, alas, 'The same one who appeared in Shanghai Surprise and bored us to death'." ...|$|E
2500|$|As Ornea himself {{recalled}} {{later in}} life, his {{confrontation with the}} biography and work of Dobrogeanu-Gherea inaugurated his progressive break with Marxism. He credited his extensive research {{into the history of}} socialism with a [...] "purification" [...] of his convictions, leading him to conclude that Leninism and the October Revolution were indefensible. As a consequence, he grew interested in Reformism, Austromarxism and the non-Leninist Orthodox Marxism of Karl Kautsky, and, according to his colleague Ion Ianoși, had sympathy for the Right Opposition of Nikolai Bukharin (whom he reportedly viewed as a precursor of reformist Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev). In the end, Ornea {{came to the conclusion that}} the Eastern Bloc regimes could not be transformed by democratic reforms, and renounced all forms of Marxism. This change reflected gradually on his work. Rizescu and literary critic Daniel Cristea-Enache both noted that, progressively, Ornea replaced the Marxist system of reference with the classical liberalism of Eugen Lovinescu and Ștefan Zeletin. Answering on this issue, Ornea himself stated: [...] "when reediting one of my works of synthesis on the various currents of thought , I only had to perform very few modifications, <b>a</b> <b>sure</b> <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> my research method and the thought (vision) guiding me was not at all played out." [...] Despite such ideological choices, Ianoși contends that Ornea was being secretly used by Romanian Communist Party leaders with literary or scientific ambitions, who would employ him as a ghostwriter, signing with their name works on which he had largely contributed his skills and his specialized knowledge.|$|E

5000|$|The {{magic number}} {{approach}} offers better guarantees that the format will be identified correctly, and can often determine more precise {{information about the}} file. Since reasonably reliable [...] "magic number" [...] tests can be fairly complex, and each file must effectively be tested against every possibility in the magic database, this approach is relatively inefficient, especially for displaying large lists of files (in contrast, file name and metadata-based methods need check only one piece of data, and match it against a sorted index). Also, data must be read from the file itself, increasing latency as opposed to metadata stored in the directory. Where file types don't lend themselves to recognition in this way, the system must fall back to metadata. It is, however, {{the best way for}} a program to check if the file it has been told to process is of the correct format: while the file's name or metadata may be altered independently of its content, failing a well-designed magic number test is <b>a</b> pretty <b>sure</b> <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> the file is either corrupt or of the wrong type.

40|$|When I {{began my}} {{scientific}} exploration of human sexual strategies in 1981, I sensed {{that the work}} would be controversial. Mix the ingredients of sex, evolution, and sex differences, and emotions start to run high. Humans don’t seem especially well designed for dispassionate intellectual discourse about any of these topics when they are considered alone, much less when they are combined. When people universally feel so strongly about a topic, however, and when scientific findings are greeted with fear and loathing, it’s <b>a</b> pretty <b>sure</b> <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> one is on to something important. During my undergraduate and graduate training in psychology, from 1971 to 1981, {{there was no such}} thing as evolutionary psychology, no one studied human mating strategies, and sex differences were believed to be trivial or nonexistent. The dominant theories of the field emphasized social learning, socialization, and arbitrary social roles—all precursors of social constructionism. If there was a nature to humans, according to mainstream assumptions, it was that humans had no fundamental nature. People were plastic, formless, passive receptacles whose adult form was achieved solely by input that occurred during development—input from media, parents, teachers, peers, and the dominant interests of those in power. Aggression, I was told, was learned and therefore could be unlearned. Whether participants in psychological studies were male or female was not even reported in many published articles, until the American Psychological Association added a rule sometime in the 1970 s to require it. Even those reporting the sex composition of their participants rarely analyzed their data to see whether men and women might differ. Those few differences that were so obvious that they could not be swept under the rug—differences in physical aggression and in spatial rotation ability—were attributed to socialization and to arbitrary “gender schemas ” that could be eliminated and replaced with alternative gender-free schemas.

6000|$|A {{period of}} nine years followed, {{in which the}} {{circumstances}} of Burke's life are enveloped in nearly complete obscurity. He seems to have kept his terms in the regular way at the Temple, and from the mastery of legal principles and methods which he afterwards showed in some important transactions, we might infer that he did more to qualify himself for practice than merely dine {{in the hall of}} his inn. For law, alike as a profession and an instrument of mental discipline, he had always the profound respect that it so amply deserves, though he saw that it was not without drawbacks of its own. The law, he said, in his fine description of George Grenville, in words that all who think about schemes of education ought to ponder, [...] "is, in my opinion, one of the first and noblest of human sciences; a science which does more to quicken and invigorate the understanding than all the other kinds of learning put together; but it is not apt, except in persons very happily born, to open and to liberalise the mind exactly in the same proportion."[1] Burke was never called to the bar, and the circumstance that, about the time when he ought to have been looking for his first guinea, he published a couple of books which had as little as possible to do with either law or equity, is <b>a</b> tolerably <b>sure</b> <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> he had followed the same desultory courses at the Temple as he had followed at Trinity College. We have only to tell over again a very old story. The vague attractions of literature prevailed over the duty of taking up a serious profession. His father, who had set his heart on having a son in the rank of a barrister, was first suspicious, then extremely indignant, and at last he withdrew his son's allowance, or else reduced it so low that the recipient could not possibly live upon it. This catastrophe took place some time in 1755,--a year of note in the history of literature, as the date of the publication of Johnson's Dictionary. It was upon literature, the most seductive, the most deceiving, the most dangerous of professions, that Burke, like so many hundreds of smaller men before and since, now threw himself for a livelihood.|$|R
