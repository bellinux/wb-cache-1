40|$|Abstract. We {{propose a}} simple {{model in which}} an agent observes not only the choices made by others, but also some {{information}} about the process that led them to those choices. We consider two cases: In the first, an agent observes whether another agent has compared the alternatives before making his choice. In the second, an agent observes the time invested in deliberation before the other agent makes his choice. It is shown {{that the existence of}} these non‐standard “neuro ” observations systematically biases the equilibrium distribution of choices.

40|$|Surprisingly often {{decoherence}} is due {{to classical}} fluctuations of ambient fields and may thus be {{described in terms of}} random unitary (RU) dynamics. However, there are decoherence channels where such a representation cannot exist. Based on a simple and intuitive geometric measure for the distance of an extremal channel to the convex set of RU channels we are able to characterize the set of true quantum phase-damping channels. Remarkably, using the Caley-Menger determinant, our measure may be assessed directly from the matrix representation of the channel. We find that the channel of maximum quantumness is closely related to a symmetric, informationally-complete positive operator-valued measure (SIC-POVM) on the environment.

40|$|Purpose: Lymphedema affects 20 - 30 % {{of women}} {{following}} breast cancer treatment. However, even when women are informed, {{they do not}} necessarily adhere to recommended lymphedema self-management regimens. Utilizing the Cognitive-Social Health Information Processing framework, we assessed the cognitive and emotional factors influencing adherence to lymphedema risk management. Methods: Women with breast cancer who had undergone breast and lymph node surgery were recruited through the Fox Chase Cancer Center breast clinic. Participants (N = 103) completed measures of lymphedema-related perceived risk, beliefs and expectancies, distress, self-regulatory ability to manage distress, knowledge, and adherence to risk management behaviors. They then received the American Cancer Society publication "Lymphedema: What Every Woman with Breast Cancer Should Know. " Cognitive and affective variables were reassessed at 6 and 12 months post-baseline. Results: Maximum likelihood multilevel model analyses indicated that overall adherence increased over time, with significant differences between baseline and 6 - and 12 -month assessments. Adherence to wearing gloves was significantly lower than that for all other behaviors except electric razor use. Distress significantly decreased, and knowledge significantly increased, over time. Greater knowledge, higher self-efficacy to enact behaviors, lower distress, and higher self-regulatory ability to manage distress were associated with increased adherence. Conclusions: Women who understand lymphedema risk management and feel confident in managing this risk {{are more likely to}} adhere to recommended strategies. These factors should be rigorously assessed as part of routine care to ensure that women have the self-efficacy to seek treatment and the self-regulatory skills to manage distress, which may undermine attempts to seek medical <b>assistance.</b> 9 <b>page(s...</b>|$|R

An informational Web site was redesigned with regard to a set of complexity metrics, which measure quantitative aspects of Web site design, with the goal of increasing the site’s usability. An experiment was then performed to test the usability of the redesigned site against the original site. Usability was judged not only by traditional metrics such as task performance time and the number of errors, but also by more Web-specific measures such as the number of links clicked. Results show that the redesigned site is perceived as more useable than the current site and allows users to perform information retrieval tasks better. The research also illustrates how complexity metrics might be used early in the design phase to create a more usable Web site, and how the addition of more “Web specific ” metrics might contribute to better measurement of overall site usability...|$|R
40|$|The frog {{model is}} a growing system of random walks where a {{particle}} is added whenever a new site is visited. A longstanding open question is how often the root is visited on the infinite d-ary tree. We prove the model undergoes a phase transition, finding it recurrent for d= 2 and transient for d≥ 5. Simulations suggest strong recurrence for d= 2, weak recurrence for d= 3, and transience for d≥ 4. Additionally, we prove a 0 - 1 law for all d-ary trees, and we exhibit a graph on which a 0 - 1 law does not hold. To prove recurrence when d= 2, we construct a recursive distributional equation {{for the number of}} visits to the root in a smaller process and show the unique solution must be infinity a. s.

40|$|We extend quantum rate {{distortion}} theory by considering auxiliary resources {{that might be}} available to a sender and receiver performing lossy quantum data compression. The first setting we consider is that of quantum {{rate distortion}} coding {{with the help of}} a classical side channel. Our result here is that the regularized entanglement of formation characterizes the quantum rate distortion function, extending earlier work of Devetak and Berger. We also combine this bound with the entanglement-assisted bound from our prior work to obtain the best known bounds on the quantum rate distortion function for an isotropic qubit source. The second setting we consider is that of quantum rate distortion coding with quantum side information (QSI) available to the receiver. In order to prove results in this setting, we first state and prove a quantum reverse Shannon theorem with QSI (for tensor-power states), which extends the known tensor-power quantum reverse Shannon theorem. The achievability part of this theorem relies on the quantum state redistribution protocol, while the converse relies on the fact that the protocol can cause only a negligible disturbance to the joint state of the reference and the receiver's QSI. This quantum reverse Shannon theorem with QSI naturally leads to quantum rate-distortion theorems with QSI, with or without entanglement <b>assistance.</b> Comment: 18 <b>pages,</b> 4 figures, IEEE format; v 3 : accepted into IEEE Transactions on Information Theory with minor change...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} k-pair {{communication}} problem for quantum information in networks of quantum channels. We consider the asymptotic rates of high fidelity quantum communication between specific sender-receiver pairs. Four scenarios of classical communication assistance (none, forward, backward, and two-way) are considered. (i) We obtain outer and inner bounds of the achievable rate {{regions in the}} most general directed networks. (ii) For two particular networks (including the butterfly network) routing is proved optimal, and the free assisting classical communication can at best be used to modify the directions of quantum channels in the network. Consequently, the achievable rate regions are given by counting edge avoiding paths, and precise achievable rate regions in all four assisting scenarios can be obtained. (iii) Optimality of routing can also be proved in classes of networks. The first class consists of directed unassisted networks in which (1) the receivers are information sinks, (2) the maximum distance from senders to receivers is small, and (3) {{a certain type of}} 4 -cycles are absent, but without further constraints (such as on the number of communicating and intermediate parties). The second class consists of arbitrary backward-assisted networks with 2 sender-receiver pairs.

5000|$|Series 3 found Cutter {{continuing}} to investigate anomalies {{and attempted to}} find ways of predicting them with the help of Stephen's replacement on the team, Captain Becker (Ben Mansfield). Meanwhile, Lester had to deal with an old rival Christine Johnson (Belinda Stewart-Wilson), an unscrupulous government official who hoped to obtain the power of the anomalies and the Future Predators for military uses. With the <b>assistance</b> of Sarah <b>Page</b> (Laila Rouass), a professor employed at the British Museum, Cutter begins to piece together a map of all anomalies, based on folklore, and begins using them to make predictions about where anomalies will occur next. Helen tries to invade the ARC with an army of cleaner clones (including a clone of Cutter), with the intention of killing the real Cutter to stop his research causing the downfall of life on Earth. Cutter takes an artefact from Helen, and is shot and killed by her in the process, with his [...] "prediction map" [...] being completely destroyed. Connor obtains the artefact and discovers that it was in fact a map similar to the one devised by Cutter to predict anomalies. However, they are not able to get it to work, but they do manage to create a device to lock anomalies and prevent creatures coming through. Danny Quinn (Jason Flemyng), a former police detective who became involved after discovering his brother had been killed by a creature from the future, becomes the team leader following Cutter's death, while Jenny departs after having nearly died, and realising that Cutter's talk of Claudia Brown was in fact all true after seeing his photo of her. Connor and Abby's relationship grows, despite her brother Jack moving into her flat and going through an anomaly to the future. Helen returns near the season's end, with a device that opens anomalies at will, revealing that she will go back to eradicate the human race by killing the first hominids, in a second attempt to stop the future the team had seen coming to pass. She kills Christine and travels back to the future, followed by Danny, Connor and Abby. While Abby and an injured Connor are forced to remain in the late Cretaceous, Danny catches up with Helen in the prehistoric past and Helen is killed by a raptor that had followed Danny into the Pliocene. The anomaly closes on him, leaving him trapped in the Pliocene and Abby and Connor trapped in the Cretaceous.|$|R
40|$|Fundamental to {{contemporary}} approaches to disaster risk reduction is {{a focus on}} community resilience. Resilience is a process, and therefore {{one of the challenges}} of its study is the identification of its components. One approach was developed by Norris, Stevens, Pfefferbaum, Wyche and Pfefferbaum (2008), who identified four networked resources (objects, conditions, characteristics and energies that are of value) critical for resilience: economic development, information and communication, social capital and community competence. Norris et al. (2008) also suggest that there are three adaptive capacities critical for post-event functioning, proposing that there will be improved resilience if resources are sufficiently robust (strong and with a low risk of deterioration), redundant (easily substitutable with other resources in the event of deterioration), and rapid (mobilised and used quickly) to buffer or counteract the effects of the stressor. While Norris et al. ’s work (2008) dealt primarily with 'mainstream' aspects of community and societal life, {{it is also important to}} explore how virtual relationships and connectedness, particularly via social media, influence how community resilience is developed and enacted after an emergency. The importance of examining the link between social media and community resilience is framed in terms of the growing tendency for people to turn to social media during disasters and use it as a tool for sourcing assistance, sharing information, communicating with friends and family, and forming online emergent groups in order to assist with the response and recovery. Social media platforms increase the potential for people to interrelate throughout the response and recovery. As with any new technology, there has been reluctance in multiple sectors to embrace the usage of social media during emergencies, and while both positive and negative anecdotal evidence is available, the research base and collection of empirical case studies in this area is small. Using thematic and content analysis, the characteristics of an online emergent group that formed after a bushfire disaster in Australia in 2013 are examined. The group of spontaneous volunteers formed as a Facebook page, Tassie Fires - We Can Help (TFWCH). Using Norris et al. ’s framework (2008), this thesis explores how social media facilitated the four resources in Norris et al. ’s model, thereby potentially contributing to increased community resilience. This analysis of community perspectives and processes that emerged in a bushfire event is used to examine the utility of the Norris et al. model, specifically in the context of social media, as a framework for conceptualising community resilience. Three sets of data were analysed. To form a basic understanding of the users and the usage of the page, a number of Facebook metrics sourced through social media analysts Locowise were examined, including user sex, location, age, and usage statistics such as page engagement. Using qualitative data analysis software package NVivo, 2, 443 of the page Administrator’s posts over the first year of the page’s life were also examined in order to explore the characteristics and functions of TFWCH. Six overarching themes, 173 key themes and 935 subordinate themes were established. Three different questionnaires were administered to users of the page, targeting individuals who had assisted, organisations who had assisted, and bushfire-affected individuals who had sought <b>assistance</b> through the <b>page</b> (N= 678). The questionnaires included a number of qualitative and quantitative items, such as exploring which sources of media were most important to users of the page, and which volunteering behaviours respondents completed. Qualitative items included in the questionnaires were analysed thematically. Evidence is provided that a community-driven online emergent group can facilitate a number of the elements proposed by Norris et al. (2008) to generate resilience, including information exchange, communication, resource provision, social support, citizen participation, collaboration and collective efficacy. There is evidence that digitally driven emergent groups can provide these resources in a robust, rapid and redundant way, potentially more so than offline spontaneous volunteers or formal responders, thereby further contributing to resilience. It emerged in this analysis that when analysed in the social media context, the model can be complemented by the inclusion of additional factors. It became clear that the leadership or Administration of an online emergent group is a key component of its success. Therefore it is proposed that skilful leadership, including meticulous information curation, is a resource that belongs centrally in Norris et al. ’s model (2008). The data also pointed to a need to develop the resilience model to complement social support provision with psychological first aid, the provision of which became a key focus for the online emergent group. The findings have implications for the field of emergency management. Due to its functionality as a communications platform, information exchange and method to engage with the community, it is recommended that social media is embraced and harnessed, and that virtual operations support teams should be formed for surge support in times of crisis. It is also recommended that online emergent groups should be legitimated and supported, as they have the potential to contribute significantly to community resilience...|$|R
