40|$|The {{present study}} is a mixed method {{longitudinal}} design, containing three objectives. Object one {{was to develop a}} team-specific survey instrumentin order to measure emotion, concentration and performance during a game. Object two was to examine the dynamics of emotion, concentration <b>and</b> performance in <b>successful</b> <b>and</b> less <b>successful</b> games. Object three was to study the relationship between emotion, concentration <b>and</b> performance in <b>successful</b> <b>and</b> less <b>successful</b> games. The participants (n= 15, age= 22. 8) in the study consisted of 15 women, all players in the same elite handball team. Qualitative data was obtained by two workshops in order to construct the instrument. Quantitative data was collected after games, using the team specific instrument. The study includes data over a six game period containing four <b>successful</b> games <b>and</b> two less <b>successful</b> games. Results showed a significant difference between <b>successful</b> <b>and</b> less <b>successful</b> games regarding all three variables measured. Both positive and negative relationships were found. The results also showed different relationships regarding <b>successful</b> <b>and</b> less <b>successful</b> games. Several practical team-specific applications were suggested, such as working with emotional regulation to enhance performance. Investigating if athletes are more prone to be influenced emotionally by their performance when performing poorlyis one of several suggestions proposed for future directions. ...|$|R

The data were collected from 20 <b>successful</b> <b>and</b> 20 less <b>successful</b> learners of first grade students of SMA Laboratorium Unsyiah. In this research, the questionnaire was used to identify the language learning strategies used by those learners. To analyze the questionnaire, the researcher used SPSS ver 18 and to find the difference between language learning strategies used by <b>successful</b> <b>and</b> less <b>successful</b> learners, t test for independent sample was used. From the analysis, {{there was a significant difference}} between language learning strategies used by <b>successful</b> <b>and</b> less <b>successful</b> learners. Less successful learners also obtained lower score than successful learners in their questionnaire scores. Successful learners got 2161 <b>and</b> less <b>successful</b> learners got 1914. Furthermore, the successful learners used more all of the six categories of language learning strategies (memory, cognitive, compensation, metacognitive, affective, and social) than less successful learners. Less successful learners did not use all of the language learning strategies (memory, cognitive, compensation, metacognitive, affective, and social) very often and this resulted them to become less effective in language learning. In addition, it was because the less successful learners only focused on one strategy...|$|R
