40|$|The {{effect of}} {{intravenous}} {{vasoactive intestinal polypeptide}} (VIP) on normal transport mechanisms in the human jejunum in vivo was examined with the triple-lumen, steady-state perfusion technique. By using special test solutions that revealed different aspects of jejunal transport, {{we were able to}} evaluate the effect of VIP on specific transport processes, such as <b>active</b> bicarbonate <b>absorption,</b> <b>active</b> chloride secretion, and passive absorption or secretion of sodium chloride. At an infusion rate of 200 pmol/kg per h, VIP inhibited <b>active</b> bicarbonate <b>absorption</b> by approximately 42 %, stimulated active chloride secretion to a slight extent, and slightly reduced passive sodium chloride absorption. A larger dose of VIP, 400 pmol/kg per h, had essentially the same effect on <b>active</b> bicarbonate <b>absorption</b> and <b>active</b> chloride secretion, but it markedly depressed passive sodium chloride absorption and also inhibited passive secretion induced by mannitol. VIP reduced the lumen-to-plasma unidirectional sodium and chloride flux rates, while the plasma-to-lumen flux rates were decreased to a lesser extent or remained unchanged. The potential difference became more lumen-negative with VIP, but the sodium diffusion and glucose-stimulated potential were not affected. We conclude that the major effect of VIP in the human jejunum is to decrease the normal absorption of water and electrolytes [...] not only <b>active</b> bicarbonate-mediated <b>absorption,</b> but also the passive absorption in response to osmotic forces generated by active or facilitated absorptive processes.

50|$|The <b>active</b> <b>absorption</b> {{of calcium}} from the gut is {{regulated}} by the calcitriol (or 1,25 dihydroxycholecalciferol, or 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3) concentration in the blood. Calcitriol is a cholesterol derivative. Under the influence of ultraviolet light on the skin, cholesterol is converted to previtamin D3 which spontaneously isomerizes to vitamin D3 (or cholecaliferol). Under the influence of parathyroid hormone, the kidneys convert cholecalciferol into the active hormone, 1,25 dihydroxycholecalciferol, which acts on the epithelial cells (enterocytes) lining the small intestine to increase the rate of absorption of calcium from the intestinal contents. Low parathyroid hormone levels in the blood (which occur under physiological conditions when the plasma ionized calcium levels are high) inhibit the conversion of cholecalciferol into calcitriol, which in turn inhibits calcium absorption from the gut. The opposite happens when the plasma ionized calcium levels are low: parathyroid hormone is secreted into the blood and the kidneys convert more cholecalciferol into the active calcitriol, increasing calcium absorption from the gut. Since about 15 mmol of calcium is excreted into the intestine via the bile per day, {{the total amount of}} calcium that reaches the duodenum and jejunum each day is about 40 mmol (25 mmol from the diet plus 15 mmol from the bile), of which, on average, 20 mmol is absorbed (back) into the blood. The net result is that about 5 mmol more calcium is absorbed from the gut than is excreted into it via the bile. If there is no active bone building (as in childhood), or increased need for calcium during pregnancy and lactation, the 5 mmol calcium that is absorbed from the gut makes up for urinary losses that are only partially regulated. Most excretion of excess calcium is via the bile and feces, because the plasma calcitriol levels (which ultimately depend on the plasma calcium levels) regulate how much of the biliary calcium is reabsorbed from the intestinal contents. Urinary excretion of calcium is relatively modest (about 5 mmol/day) in comparison to what can be excreted via the feces (15 mmol/day).|$|E

40|$|Under {{commercial}} conditions, weaning of piglets {{is associated}} with social, environmental and dietary stress. Consequently, small-intestinal barrier and absorptive functions deteriorate {{within a short time}} after weaning. Most studies that have assessed small-intestinal permeability in pigs after weaning used either Ussing chambers or orally administered marker probes. Paracellular barrier function and <b>active</b> <b>absorption</b> decrease when pigs are weaned at 3 weeks of age or earlier. However, when weaned at 4 weeks of age or later, the barrier function is less affected, and <b>active</b> <b>absorption</b> is not affected or is increased. Weaning stress is a critical factor in relation to the compromised paracellular barrier function after weaning. Adequate feed intake levels after weaning prevent the loss of the intestinal barrier function. Transcellular transport of macromolecules and passive transcellular absorption decrease after weaning. This may reflect a natural intestinal maturation process that is enhanced by the weaning process and prevents the pig from an antigen overload. It seems that passive and <b>active</b> <b>absorption</b> after weaning adapt accurately to the new environment when pigs are weaned after 3 weeks of age. However, when weaned at 3 weeks of age or earlier, the decrease in <b>active</b> <b>absorption</b> indicates that pigs are unable to sufficiently adapt to the new environment.
