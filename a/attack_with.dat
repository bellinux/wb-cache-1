5|$|Amir's brigade was {{now down}} to one {{battalion}}, which was to <b>attack</b> <b>with</b> Nir's brigade of 50 tanks. To Amir's surprise, a reserve armored battalion of 25 tanks commanded by Colonel Eliashiv Shemshi arrived in the area, en route to Keren's brigade. Short of forces, Amir, with Adan's approval, commandeered Shemshi's battalion, and ordered him to provide covering fire for Nir's assault on the Firdan bridge.|$|E
5|$|Gibraltar {{was part}} of a 17-ship squadron, keeping four French ships-of-the-line in Fort Royal, Martinique, when on 29April 1781 a 20-ship fleet and a {{merchant}} convoy under Contre-amiral François deGrasse arrived from Brest. Out of sight of the British, deGrasse put a man ashore to swap information with Fort Royal's garrison, and agree on a plan of <b>attack</b> <b>with</b> the blockaded ships.|$|E

He moved to Bradford City after he failed to break into the Everton side but after two injury-ravaged seasons with Bradford he moved to Shrewsbury Town, following a short loan spell. He spent three seasons with Shrewsbury, then joined Accrington Stanley in July 2009 after a loan period the previous season.|$|E

5|$|Lucullus had {{initially}} {{decided to make}} a running charge with his infantry, a Roman military tactic that minimized the amount of time an enemy could utilize its archers and sling infantry prior to close combat engagement. However, he decided against this at the last moment when he realized that the Armenian cataphracts posed the greatest threat to his men, ordering instead a diversionary <b>attack</b> <b>with</b> his Gallic and Thracian cavalry against the cataphracts.|$|E
5|$|On 20 August 636, {{the final}} day of the battle, Khalid put into action a simple but bold plan of <b>attack.</b> <b>With</b> his massed cavalry force he {{intended}} to drive the Byzantine cavalry entirely off the battlefield so that the infantry, which formed the bulk of the imperial army, would be left without cavalry support and thus would be exposed when attacked from the flanks and rear.|$|E
5|$|The RPF advance caused {{panic in}} France, which had long {{supported}} the Habyarimana regime. Several hundred French troops were immediately dispatched to Rwanda, along with arms and ammunition, {{to bolster the}} FAR forces. The arrival of these French troops in Kigali significantly changed the military situation on the ground. The RPF now found themselves under <b>attack,</b> <b>with</b> French shells bombarding them as they advanced southwards.|$|E

5|$|After 7.Nc3 Black has the zwischenzug 7...Qh4+ 8.g3 Bxc3+ 9.bxc3 Qe7 so {{that the}} {{diagonal}} a8–h1 is weakened before Black develops the Bc8 to the b7-square. The queen on the e7-square is well placed to pressure the e4-pawn. However, as most of Black's pieces are on the queenside, continuing with pawn pushes like f7–f5 is probably too weakening, as Alekhine demonstrated in his game against Seitz in 1925. So Black does best to <b>attack</b> <b>with</b> pieces, possibly with the setup b6/Nc5/Bb7/0-0-0. In that case Tseitlin considers that with a knight on c5 the move d7–d6 should be avoided if Black has {{to respond to the}} capture Bxc5 by dxc5, because the white pawns in e4 and f4 would have too much leeway.|$|E
5|$|After {{going to}} the ground, Jackson managed to slip out of the choke. Jackson began to <b>attack</b> <b>with</b> ground and pound, dealing strikes to Silva's body while Silva {{answered}} with the same from the bottom. Jackson began to land punches to Silva's face, and the latter attempted a Juji-gatame, a variation of an armbar. Silva could not pull off the hold, and Jackson moved into side control shortly after. From here, Jackson threw punches to Silva's head and followed by landing two knees, again to the head (which were legal under Pride rules).|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} reinforcements, Reshef {{focused on}} clearing the Tirtur Road. He left {{a battalion of}} around 30 tanks between the junction and {{the western part of}} the Chinese Farm, and prepared to <b>attack</b> <b>with</b> two armored battalions provided by Sharon. He concentrated on the section of the Tirtur Road defended by an Egyptian battalion forming the left flank of the 16th Infantry Brigade. One of Reshef's battalions attacked from the north-east, the other from the west. The Egyptian battalion managed to halt the advance, aided by fire from tanks and anti-tank weapons on the slopes of Missouri, a hill north-west of the Chinese Farm, causing Reshef to break off his attack.|$|E

5|$|As Bode was {{in action}} at Poling, Alfons Orthofer's unit {{attacked}} Ford. There were only six Lewis machine guns manned at Ford and the Ju 87s {{were able to}} <b>attack</b> <b>with</b> complete confidence. Bombs rained down on huts, hangars, building and amongst aircraft drawn up together for maintenance. Early on bombs struck the field's oil tanks and storage compounds causing an enormous blaze which contributed to the crippling damage on the airfield. Gosport also came under attack soon after. Siegel's Ju 87s, with no air opposition, swooped onto their targets causing large-scale damage.|$|E
5|$|British Lt. Col. Robert Abercromby {{decided to}} push his {{advantage}} after scattering Irvine's troops. He pushed north and captured St. Thomas Episcopal Church, located on a hillock. Howe arrived a short while later, and ascended {{to the top of}} the church's bell tower in an attempt to view the American positions. Deciding the American defenses were too strong to <b>attack</b> <b>with</b> his present force, he opted to shell their defenses with artillery fire; however, his guns did not have the range to hit Washington's defenses. His forces camped on Chestnut Hill that night, and planned a new way of attack for the following day.|$|E
5|$|By 20 March, Jordan had {{identified}} {{parts of the}} Israeli 7th Armored Brigade, 60th Armored Brigade, 35th Paratroop Brigade, 80th Infantry Brigade, a combat engineer battalion and five artillery battalions between Allenby and Damia bridges. The Jordanians assumed the Israelis were planning an <b>attack</b> <b>with</b> a drive on Amman, and the army took up positions near the bridges, with the 60th Armored Brigade joining the 1st Infantry Division. Jordan also added most of its armored car, antitank and artillery units to the 1st Infantry Division. The total firepower was 105 Patton tanks and 88 artillery pieces. The infantry divisions were deployed near the bridges, each with a tank company. The artillery was mostly deployed on the higher Jordan Valley ridges overlooking Karameh for topological advantage.|$|E

5|$|Chelsea midfielder Nemanja Matić was {{suspended}} for the final, due to a two-match ban he received for pushing over Burnley's Ashley Barnes in a league match on 21 February 2015. Another central midfielder for the club, John Obi Mikel, missed the match through a knee injury. Due to Matić's absence, Kurt Zouma – usually a central defender – moved into defensive midfield, with Gary Cahill introduced into Zouma's previous position. Chelsea made four other changes from their draw with Burnley: Petr Čech started in goal in place of Thibaut Courtois, César Azpilicueta at left-back instead of Filipe Luís, and Ramires and Willian came into the midfield {{at the expense of}} Juan Cuadrado and Oscar. Chelsea set up with a three-man <b>attack,</b> <b>with</b> Eden Hazard and Willian wide of Diego Costa.|$|E
5|$|Clements {{began his}} {{campaign}} for re-election in 1956 by defeating Joe Bates, the candidate favored by Chandler, in the Democratic senatorial primary. On April 30, 1956, Kentucky senator Alben Barkley died suddenly of a heart <b>attack.</b> <b>With</b> the Democratic primary already over, the Democratic State Central Committee was charged with selecting a candidate to run for Barkley's seat. They chose Wetherby, Clements' former lieutenant governor. Journalist John Ed Pearce later recorded that Clements had favored Chandler's choice, Joseph Leary, as a candidate rather than Wetherby. Clements didn't think Leary {{had a very good}} chance of winning, but he felt Leary's selection would keep Chandler from throwing his support to the Republican candidates.|$|E
5|$|Combat {{takes place}} in real-time. Located {{at the bottom of}} the screen is a power bar, a gauge that determines the amount of damage done to an enemy when attacking. Swinging a weapon causes the gauge to empty and then quickly recharge, {{allowing}} that character to attack at full strength. The party wields eight different types of weaponry: sword, spear, bow, axe, boomerang, glove, whip, and javelin. All weapons can be upgraded eight times, and repeated use of a weapon increases its skill level to a maximum of eight, unlocking a new special <b>attack</b> <b>with</b> each level. Weapons are upgraded with Weapon Orbs, which are found in dungeons or earned by defeating certain bosses. The player takes each Orb to a blacksmith, located in most towns, who uses it to reforge one weapon.|$|E

5|$|Constant {{shelling}} had {{blocked the}} Ravebeek stream, creating an impassable swamp directly between {{the boundary of}} the 3rd Canadian and the 4th Canadian Divisions, necessitating a two-prong attack. The 3rd Canadian Division was assigned the wider advance on the left, which included the sharply rising ground of the Bellevue spur. In the more restricted ground south of the Ravebeek stream, the 4th Canadian Division would occupy advanced positions in no man's land {{before the start of}} the offensive and take Decline Copse, which straddled the Ypres–Roulers railway. Currie planned the <b>attack</b> <b>with</b> extensive depth in resources. The remaining units of the 8th, 9th and 10th Canadian Infantry Brigades were placed in support, while the 7th, 11th and 12th Canadian Infantry Brigades were held in divisional and corps reserve. The 1st and 2nd Canadian Divisions were in army reserve.|$|E
5|$|Ever {{since the}} victory against an Egyptian army at the Battle of Tel-el-Kebir, the {{standard}} British tactic against an entrenched position was an approach march {{at night in}} close order to maintain cohesion, followed by deployment into open order within {{a few hundred yards}} of the objective and a frontal <b>attack</b> <b>with</b> the bayonet at first light. Methuen planned to bombard the Boer positions with artillery from 16:50 to 18:30 on 10 December. Following the barrage, the newly arrived Highland Brigade under Major General Wauchope was to make a night march that would position them to launch a frontal attack on the Boers at dawn the following day. Wauchope had argued for a flanking attack along the Modder River, but had been unable to convince his superior.|$|E
5|$|Howell was out {{on patrol}} on 15 June 1918 when German and Austrian forces {{initiated}} the Battle of the Piave River by striking Allied lines on the opposite bank. After landing back at base at 11:40, {{he was the first}} to bring news of the <b>attack.</b> <b>With</b> the aircraft refuelled and loaded with bombs, he—in company with the rest of the squadron—then led his flight on a total of four sorties against the enemy insurgents. No.45 Squadron succeeded in destroying with its bombs a pontoon bridge, a boat, and a trench filled with soldiers, before inflicting at least a hundred casualties with machine gun fire. Heavy rain washed other bridges away and by 18 June the stranded Austrian forces on the Allied bank of the river were routed by a counterattack.|$|E
