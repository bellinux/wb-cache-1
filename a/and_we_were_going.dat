500|$|Davis toured relentlessly for {{two years}} while tolerating intense {{physical}} pain and difficulty walking, caused by joint pain from sickle-cell anaemia, badly damaged ankles after a 1972 car wreck, and osteoporosis in his left hip, which had been operated on a decade earlier. He had also developed nodules on his larynx that often left him short of breath, especially when playing the trumpet. To numb the pain, he became increasingly dependent on self-medicating with painkillers, cocaine, and morphine, which combined with his alcohol and recreational drug use led to mood swings; he would by turns feel vulnerable and hostile. By the end of 1974, a disappointing showing in Down Beat magazine's readers poll reinforced to Davis that his reputation had diminished. Unfazed by detractors and personal troubles, he kept his touring schedule intense. [...] "He was like the general looking at the fort {{and they had a}} moat <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to get in that fort", Henderson later said. [...] "That was the attitude of the band. We didn't give a shit what the critics said. People are gonna like what they like, but if you don't like it, respect it. Respect that I {{have the right to do}} what I do. Because with or without you, we're going to do it anyway." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The End of All Things" [...] {{was written}} by co-executive {{producer}} David Fury, while being directed by [...] veteran, Jeff Hunt. It was Hunt's third series credit (his other two being [...] "The Man from the Other Side" [...] and [...] "The Box"). Leading up to the episode's broadcast, executive producer Jeff Pinkner remarked {{in a conference call}} with journalists that it was a [...] "game-changer" [...] because [...] "our characters learn a lot more and the audience is going to learn a lot more about the über-plot of the season’s bad guy, David Robert Jones." [...] Referring to the Observer September, Pinker added that the episode would also peel [...] "back some layers about what his agenda has been and use that as an opportunity to revisit the things on the show we’ve seen before." [...] Fellow executive producer J.H. Wyman elaborated [...] "We always said you would find out about the Observers this season <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to investigate them a lot more. We’re excited about it all. That’s a highlight– the Observers are a highlight. For us to constantly break what you know and reset and have people go, 'Wow, I didn’t see that coming!' That’s why we {{get up in the morning}} is to take people along for the ride. We’re excited about what’s coming up, too." ...|$|E

500|$|Cannon first {{played for}} the LSU varsity {{football}} team as a sophomore in 1957 under coach Paul Dietzel. He played in the halfback position and shared the backfield with Jim Taylor, who was selected as an All-American that year. He also played defensive back and was the team's primary punter. He quickly emerged as a star, scoring twice in early season victories over Alabama and Texas Tech. The Alabama game was the most prolific rushing game of Cannon's college career; he amassed 140 yards with eight carries. Against the Red Raiders, Cannon had five punts for a 40-yard average, completed two of four passes for 31 yards, caught a 59-yard pass for a touchdown, carried thirteen times for 36 yards, and returned a kickoff for a touchdown. Cannon recalled that Texas Tech's focus was solely on Taylor. [...] "They were just wearing Jimmy out", he said. [...] "Of course, they weren't looking for me. They just beat the devil out of Jimmy. With them focusing on Jimmy, I had a great game." [...] Over half a century later, former Red Raiders standout Jack Henry recalled of Cannon:"We kicked off. And that damn Billy Cannon. Jim Henderson and I were running down in our lanes and got down there, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to hit him high and low. We were going to knock {{the hell out of}} him... We hit ourselves. Ran into each other. He made a 100-yard touchdown. You don't forget that." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although not a {{tropical}} cyclone, the storm brought back memories of Cyclone Aila, which killed 155 {{people in the}} same area in May 2009. One eyewitness described the storm: [...] "It was all dark. I thought {{it was the end of}} the world <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to die." [...] Locals received no warning of the impending storm, and were mostly sleeping when the storm hit, increasing the casualties. Out-dated equipment with limited capabilities was blamed for the lack of warnings.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{supporting}} {{personnel who}} signed on early included Rock Scully, who {{heard of the}} band from Kesey and signed on as manager after meeting them at the Big Beat Acid Test; Stewart Brand, [...] "with his side show of taped music and slides of Indian life, a multimedia presentation" [...] at the Big Beat and then, expanded, at the Trips Festival; and Owsley Stanley, the [...] "Acid King" [...] whose LSD supplied the tests and who, in early 1966, became the band's financial backer, renting them {{a house on the}} fringes of Watts and buying them sound equipment. [...] "We were living solely off of Owsley's good graces at that time. ... trip was he wanted to design equipment for us, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to have to be in sort of a lab situation for him to do it," [...] said Garcia.|$|E
2500|$|Funspot {{was named}} [...] "World's Largest Arcade" [...] by Guinness World Records in 2008. The American Classic Arcade Museum alone {{has more than}} 300 pre-1988 video games and pinball machines. In 2009, the outdoor minigolf course was almost torn out, and a {{restaurant}} put in its place, but it was saved due to its historical value. Bob Lawton said, [...] "When we opened it in 1964, {{we were the only}} ones in the Lakes Region that had minigolf, but then several opened up. Last year, we decided we wouldn't close it <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to keep it. It's historic; the buildings are fantastic." [...] There is currently an empty lot next to the outdoor minigolf course where Funspot has been talking to hotel chains such as Best Western, Hilton, and Marriott, about the possibility of building a hotel.|$|E

2500|$|In December 2012, Heems {{announced}} {{to a crowd}} at the On3 Festival in Munich that Das Racist had broken up. In response, Kool A.D. tweeted that {{he had left the}} band two months prior but had been keeping his departure under wraps. The breakup came after they had signed a record deal and were to release a [...] "proper album", followed by a tour. Dapwell told Spin, “We had a plan to break up around May. We had just signed this record deal <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to put out one proper album and then go on a farewell tour, release a proper breaking up statement that could have been really funny, maybe a weird, stupid video.

[...] And I went to President Clinton myself and then Attorney General Janet Reno, and I said we need one thing. If {{we are going to}} bail Mexico out, let us make them sign an {{extradition}} treaty of fugitives, murders, criminals and get our kids back from Mexico. Right? Did not happen. What a perfect time for us to say we are going to save your entire country, we are going to lend you billions of dollars and shore up your economy, but you know what, since that meeting with President Clinton we now have on record over 3,000 murders and fugitives down there and {{we do not know how}} many kids".|$|E
2500|$|In 1966 Hunter {{moved to}} London, where he joined The Scenery with guitarist Miller Anderson, drummer Dave Dufort and {{keyboard}} player Dante Smith. There Hunter met Mick Ronson, then guitarist of bands the Voice and The Rats, at the Flamingo Club in London. According to Anderson, [...] "Mick {{was coming down}} the stairs ... <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> up and I said, `Mick, this is my friend, Ian [...] Patterson.'" [...] The Scenery, now with John Vernon Smith on drums, recorded tracks with Bill Farley at Regent Sound that were licensed for international release without their knowledge. Hunter and Anderson recall writing and recording [...] "To Make a Man Cry," [...] but not the B-side, [...] "Thread of Time." [...] John Vernon Smith appears on the picture sleeve, but Johnny Banks, of The Merseybeats, played on the record. Johnny Gustafson was {{also included in the}} session work. The songs were released on the Impact label, and it is unclear whether they originated from France or Belgium.|$|E

2500|$|By 2000, DeVille had cured his two-decades-long {{addiction}} to heroin. He relocated to Cerrillos Hills, New Mexico, where he produced and played on an album, Blue Love Monkey, with Rick Nafey, {{a friend from}} his youth in Connecticut who had played in DeVille's first band, Billy & the Kids, as well as The Royal Pythons. In New Mexico, DeVille's wife Lisa committed suicide by hanging; DeVille discovered her body. He said:I got {{in a car accident}} because I got crazy. I think I was somewhat taunting death because somebody who I loved very much died. And I found them. That's what that lyric in that song means ("she hurts me still since I cut her down" [...] ). I cut her down. Next thing you know the police show up, I was in tears... I was in love with another woman <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> through some hard times, and I got in the car and I wanted to go off the cliff. I was in the mountains in New Mexico...
