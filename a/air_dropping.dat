5|$|The {{techniques}} and technologies to deliver supplies by air {{were in their}} infancy. There were few aircraft available, and these were {{of a variety of}} different types, complicating maintenance. Air operations in New Guinea were restricted by the weather. Transport aircraft were vulnerable in the air, and required fighter escorts. They were also subject to destruction on the ground by Japanese air raids. The loss of the airstrip at Kokoda led to the adoption of <b>air</b> <b>dropping.</b> Due to a shortage of parachutes, supplies often had to be dropped without them, and loss due to breakages and unrecoverable goods was high.|$|E
5|$|Having {{decided on}} a {{location}} and date, there still remained the matter {{of what would be}} tested. John Challens, whose weapons electronics group at Aldermaston had to produce the bomb assembly, wanted to know the configuration of Green Granite. Cook ruled that it would use a Red Beard Tom, and would fit inside a Blue Danube casing for <b>air</b> <b>dropping.</b> The design was frozen in April 1956. There were two versions of Orange Herald, large and small. They had similar cores, but the large version contained more explosive. Both designs were frozen in July. The Green Bamboo design was also nominally frozen, but tinkering with it continued. On 3 September, John Corner suggested that Green Granite could be made smaller by moving the Tom and Dick closer together. This design became known as Short Granite.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the number}} of pack animals and {{carriers}} was limited, the requirements for stores and supplies of all types, including rations, ammunition, ordnance, signals equipment and medical supplies, were submitted to 7th Division headquarters, which allocated movement priorities. One of Richardson's first actions was to obtain more saddlery for the pack horses. He also acquired five more American jeeps to augment the five that had been working the jeep track. The original five {{were found to be}} in poor condition, and needed overhaul. While the 25th Infantry Brigade was conducting operations in the Imita Ridge area, the carry was short, {{and despite the fact that}} there were no suitable <b>air</b> <b>dropping</b> zones, the supply situation was good. As the Australians began advancing toward Kokoda again in October, the supply line became steadily longer, and the demand for carriers more acute.|$|E

5|$|The first air {{transport}} {{mission to the}} Kokoda front was flown on 26 July, when a DC-3 from the 21st Troop Carrier Squadron landed 15 troops of the 39th Infantry Battalion and some stores. A C-53 followed that afternoon with another 15 men and some stores. The flight time to Kokoda was about 20 minutes. An air supply run the following day by a C-53 and a DC-2 found the airstrip barricaded. The barricades were removed, but the aircraft were recalled by a radio message that the Kokoda Drome could not be held. The loss of the airstrip meant a switch to <b>air</b> <b>dropping</b> supplies. An aircraft was sent that afternoon, but was recalled. On 28 July, a DC-5, a DC-3 and a DC-2 dropped supplies near Kokoda. Three transports dropped supplies near Kagi on 29 July, and one on 30 July. No more missions were flown until 6 August.|$|E
25|$|The {{squadron}} {{spent the}} final {{months of the}} war conducting mine laying operations, including Balikpapan Harbour. After Japan surrendered in August 1945, its focus shifted to humanitarian efforts, <b>air</b> <b>dropping</b> supplies to Allied personnel in prisoner-of-war camps, and repatriating newly liberated POWs back to Australia. These operations occupied the squadron {{until the end of}} 1945; it was withdrawn back to Australia after that and officially ceased to exist on 15 February 1946. Casualties during the war amounted to 102 personnel killed.|$|E
25|$|In August 2004, Seglem {{bought the}} entire company from the partners. After the reorganization, {{the company made}} a small profit {{in the last quarter}} of 2004. However, for the whole 2004, the company lost NOK17.6 million. In September, Coast Air started flying the Stord–Oslo route again, using the ATR planes, {{following}} the termination by Golden Air. On 19 November, Coast Air also started a route between Stord, Haugesund and Sandefjord once per week. In 2005, the company also introduced a flight between Haugesund and Molde Airport, Årø. In February 2006, the company started flying twice a day from Sandefjord to Stockholm using the Jetstream aircraft. With increased traffic and the new PSO contracts, Coast Air received a third ATR 42 aircraft in April. Restructurization led to Coast <b>Air</b> <b>dropping</b> ground services, and from 1 May 2007, SAS Ground Services handled Coast Air's planes at Haugesund. The company also introduced in-flight breakfast on all ATR 42-flights. In addition, it started with two daily round trips from Haugesund to Copenhagen Airport in Denmark. The airline also introduced a business lounge for passengers traveling in Super Economy class. In November, another route was opened with two weekly round services from Stord to Gdańsk in Poland.|$|E

25|$|In January 1966, FAN {{decided to}} leave the assault on Phou Khout to American air power. While U.S. air strikes struck the communists there, eight battalions of Neutralists fanned out onto the Plain of Jars on 30 January. In the event, air support was sporadic, and with the {{exception}} of BP 2, FAN was unsuccessful. On 12 February 1966, a communist attack overran Lima Site 27; on the 16th, they also attacked Lima Site 36, suffering heavy losses to napalm and to the fire of AC-47 gunships. Nevertheless, by 19 February, they were successful. An immediate counterattack was planned, but put on hold. On the night of 12 March, Lima Site 48 fell. On 14 March, FAN once again attacked Phou Khout, with about 30 sorties of U.S. <b>air</b> <b>dropping</b> napalm to clear the way. The communists were pushed back onto Phou Khout's northern slopes, where they were supported by fire from nearby Hill 1157. FAN suffered 10 dead, 31 wounded. At 0400 hours 20 March, troops from the Pathet Lao 2nd and 701st Battalions drove FAN from the ridgeline; they also closed in on Muang Soui. By 30 March 1966, FAN Bataillon Infanterie 8 (Infantry Battalion 8) had had enough; they walked off the battlefield and insisted on being returned to Vang Vieng.|$|E
500|$|But {{there are}} other {{explanations}} for the missing rations. The inexperienced New Guinea Force staff assumed that the supplies they despatched would arrive, but this {{was far from the}} case with <b>air</b> <b>dropping,</b> the techniques for which had yet to be properly developed. Kienzle picked what he thought were good drop zones, but the air crews sometimes found them restricted or dangerous. The aircraft had to fly low over the drop zone, at about , and slow, at about [...] They had to take the wind into account, as it might cause parachuted packages to miss the drop zone. The load would be placed in the doorway, and three or four men would push it out when the pilot gave the signal. The pilot would fly level or with the nose slightly down, so that cargo would not hit the tail of the aircraft. The pilot would retract the landing gear if it was down, and climb to gain altitude. Multiple passes over the drop zone might be required. Heavy loads were not practical for <b>air</b> <b>dropping</b> missions, since the aircraft had to arrive low and slow over the drop zone, but higher speed was required for greater weight. Nor could an overloaded aircraft climb or dive quickly. The 21st and 22nd Troop Carrier Squadrons were still based in Queensland and not at Port Moresby, so the aircrew were there on short rotations. Their learning process was therefore fitful and slow. Men from various Army and RAAF units assisted the aircrew in the task of pushing stores out of the aircraft.|$|E
500|$|Techniques for <b>air</b> <b>dropping</b> {{had yet to}} be developed. Following {{the loss}} of the {{airstrip}} at Kokoda, the AAF concluded {{that the only way to}} get supplies to A Company, 39th Infantry Battalion in the Kokoda area was to adopt a suggestion from the Army to put them in fighter drop tanks. The tanks were slit, along the bottom, and they were filled with supplies. The first attempt on 11 August was called off due to bad weather, but four fighters dropped a total of [...] on 12 August. By then it was too late; the area was in Japanese hands. A forward supply dump was [...] established at Myola, in a dry lake bed that Kienzle found on 3 August. The lake bed was flat and treeless, making it a good candidate for a supply drop zone. Several days of good weather after 9 August allowed the transport aircraft to concentrate on dropping at Myola.|$|E

50|$|This {{method was}} {{developed}} by the US Military {{with the assistance of the}} 109th Quartermaster Company (<b>Air</b> <b>Drop)</b> in 1964. In May 1965, a detachment of the 109th was formed as the 383rd Quartermaster (Aerial Supply) Detachment and sent to Vietnam. In 1966 the 109th was sent to Vietnam and took operational control of the 383rd. Both units provided <b>Air</b> <b>Drop</b> and LAPES support during the Siege of Khe Sanh in the Vietnam War. LAPES was used to provide a method of supplying heavy loads into Khe Sanh which could not effectively be supplied by <b>air</b> <b>drop.</b> This practice was perfected at Mactan Air Base in Cebu, Philippines.|$|R
500|$|... {{and wooden}} boxes rotted or were eaten by insects. Parachutes for <b>air</b> <b>dropping</b> were in short supply. [...] Orders for parachutes {{were placed in}} Australia, the United States and India. A request for 5,000 cargo parachutes with {{containers}} was made to Washington on 21 July. On 22 September {{it was decided to}} send 1,000 without containers by air, while the rest went by sea. Due to the shortage of parachutes, most supplies had to be [...] "free-dropped"—dropped without parachutes—so the rate of breakage was high. As the contents of the packaging usually burst, they were encased in two or more sacks, the outer being much larger than the inner, so it could contain the contents when the inner burst, and prevent them from scattering. Three layers was found necessary. Items such as sacks and blankets were preferred as packaging, as these were useful to the troops. About 12,000 blankets were used in the five weeks up to 12 October. The earlier adoption of blankets as packaging would not only have saved supplies from breakage, but would have also increased the volume of supplies delivered over the track, as thousands of blankets were sent by carrier. Without a well-organised recovery effort, less that 50 percent of what was dropped was recovered, and perhaps 70 per cent of what was recovered was found to be in a usable condition.|$|E
2500|$|When fuel is vaporized, it cools the {{surrounding}} air due to the refrigeration effect as the fuel absorbs heat when it changes state from a liquid to a gas. This may result in the <b>air</b> <b>dropping</b> below freezing, causing water vapor contained {{in the air to}} first change state from a gas to a liquid, which then becomes ice. [...] This ice forms on the throttle plate, which is located [...] "down stream" [...] of the fuel nozzle. [...] The ice also forms on the inner walls of the carburetor, sometimes {{to such a degree that}} it blocks airflow to the engine.|$|E
2500|$|One of Pius XII's main {{diplomatic}} priorities was {{to prevent}} the bombing of Rome; so sensitive was the pontiff that he protested even the British <b>air</b> <b>dropping</b> of pamphlets over Rome, claiming that the few landing within the city-state violated the Vatican's neutrality. Before the American entry into the war, there was little impetus for such a bombing, as the British saw little strategic value in it. After the American entry, the US opposed such a bombing, fearful of offending Catholic members of its military forces, while the British then supported it. Pius XII similarly advocated for the declaration of Rome as an [...] "open city", but this occurred only on August 14, 1943, after Rome had already been bombed twice. Although the Italians consulted the Vatican on {{the wording of the}} open city declaration, the impetus for the change {{had little to do with}} the Vatican.|$|E

2500|$|The most {{well-known}} winter {{effect of the}} Great Lakes on regional weather is the lake effect in snowfall, which is sometimes very localized. Even late in winter, the lakes often have no icepack in the middle. The prevailing winds from the west pick up the air and moisture from the lake surface, which is slightly warmer {{in relation to the}} cold surface winds above. As the slightly warmer, moist air passes over the colder land surface, the moisture often produces concentrated, heavy snowfall that sets up in bands or [...] "streamers". This is similar to the effect of warmer <b>air</b> <b>dropping</b> snow as it passes over mountain ranges. During freezing weather with high winds, the [...] "snow belts" [...] receive regular snow fall from this localized weather pattern, especially along the eastern shores of the lakes. Snow belts are found in Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York, United States; and Ontario, Canada.|$|E
2500|$|While the {{discovery}} of Myola alleviated {{one of the problems}} associated with resupply, it did not solve them all. Air drops requested during the second battle at Kokoda were delayed by weather – which frequently interfered with air operations over the range. At the start of the campaign, effective <b>air</b> <b>dropping</b> techniques had not been developed. Belated drops to Kokoda were made by fighters {{because of the lack of}} transports. [...] Belly tanks were filled with supplies but this could not be widely used. [...] Parachutes were not initially available and, after a quantity were delivered in mid-September, remained in short supply and were reserved for essential equipment. [...] Most supplies were [...] "free dropped". Packaging was primitive by modern standards. [...] Supplies were wrapped in blankets or tied in sacks. [...] There was, however, a conscious choice to utilise packing, such as blankets, that were required by the troops and might otherwise have been supplied separately. The rate of breakage and loss was high – on average, 50 percent and up to 90 percent. [...] Lieutenant Fayle, Allen's aide-de-camp, commented that: [...] "The whole fact of the matter, and NGF seemed unable to understand all through the campaign, was that recoveries were never 100 per cent of the supplies dropped and wastage was at times terrific." ...|$|E
