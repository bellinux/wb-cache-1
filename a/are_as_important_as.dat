5|$|The 10-minute {{murder scene}} which forms the film's climax is scored with almost {{the whole of}} the Act II duet between Otello and Iago from Giuseppe Verdi's Otello. This is an {{atypical}} scoring for a film, since Verdi's piece is not an aria, but a dramatic dialogue in which the words <b>are</b> <b>as</b> <b>important</b> <b>as</b> the music. Thus the astute spectator will be presented with two dramatic narratives to follow; Allen is not respecting traditional conventions of cinematic accompaniment, since the score's events do not match the story unfolding onscreen.|$|E

25|$|Standards of play {{can vary}} from semi-professional to {{occasional}} recreational level.

25|$|A Carnatic {{composition}} {{really has}} two elements, one being the musical element, the other being what is conveyed in the composition. It is {{probably because of}} this fact that most Carnatic music compositions are composed for singing. In addition to the rich musical experience, each composition brings out the knowledge and personality of the composer, and hence the words <b>are</b> <b>as</b> <b>important</b> <b>as</b> the musical element itself. This poses a special challenge for the musicians because rendering this music does not involve just playing or singing the correct musical notes; the musicians are expected {{to understand what was}} conveyed by the composer in various languages, and sing musical phrases that act to create the effect that was intended by the composer in his/her composition.|$|E

2500|$|Recognition of Fondane's overall {{contribution}} was however rare, {{as noted in}} 1989 by Martin Stanton: [...] " [...] surely the most underestimated intellectual of the 1930s".

[...] Cioran, who in 1986 dedicated {{a portion of his}} Exercises in Admiration collection to his deceased friend, mentioned that Baudelaire et l'expérience du gouffre, made memorable by its study of boredom as a literary subject, had since found numerous readers. Cioran kept a fond memory of his friend, and recalled not being able to pass on Rue Rollin without experiencing [...] "terrible pain". Awareness of Fondane's philosophy was nevertheless judged unsatisfactory by scholar Moshe Idel. Speaking in 2007, he suggested that Fondane the philosopher remained less familiar to Jewish studies academics in Israel than his various counterparts in Germanic Europe.|$|E

[...] After graduating from Yale in 1967, Yeston attended Clare College at Cambridge University in England. [...] There he belonged to the Footlights dramatics organization and wrote several classical pieces and a musical version of Alice in Wonderland. [...] Alice was eventually produced at the Long Wharf Theatre in Connecticut in 1971. [...] At Cambridge, he focused his musical goals, moving from classical composition to theatre songwriting. [...] Upon earning his master's degree at Cambridge in 1972, Yeston returned to the United States to accept a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship, which included a teaching position at Lincoln University in Pennsylvania, the country's oldest traditionally black college. [...] At Lincoln, Yeston taught music, art, philosophy, religion, and western civilization, and introduced a course {{in the history of}} black music.|$|E
60|$|There is, thus, no {{possible}} {{improvement in the}} arts of production which does not in one or another mode exercise an antagonistic influence {{to the law of}} diminishing return to agricultural labor. Nor is it only industrial improvements which have this effect. Improvements in government, and almost every kind of moral and social advancement, operate in the same manner. We may say the same of improvements in education. The intelligence of the workman is a most important element in the productiveness of labor. The carefulness, economy, and general trustworthiness of laborers <b>are</b> <b>as</b> <b>important</b> <b>as</b> their intelligence. Friendly relations and a community of interest and feeling between laborers and employers are eminently so. In the rich and idle classes, increased mental energy, more solid instruction, and stronger feelings of conscience, public spirit, or philanthropy, would qualify them to originate and promote the most valuable improvements, both in the economical resources of their country and in its institutions and customs.|$|E
60|$|It will be universally {{admitted}} that instincts <b>are</b> <b>as</b> <b>important</b> <b>as</b> corporeal {{structure for the}} welfare of each species, under its present conditions of life. Under changed conditions of life, it is at least possible that slight modifications of instinct might be profitable to a species; and if it can be shown that instincts do vary ever so little, then I can see no difficulty in natural selection preserving and continually accumulating variations of instinct to any extent that may be profitable. It is thus, as I believe, that all the most complex and wonderful instincts have originated. As modifications of corporeal structure arise from, and are increased by, use or habit, and are diminished or lost by disuse, so I do not doubt it has been with instincts. But I believe that the effects of habit are of quite subordinate importance to the effects of the natural selection of what may be called accidental variations of instincts;--that is of variations produced by the same unknown causes which produce slight deviations of bodily structure.|$|E
