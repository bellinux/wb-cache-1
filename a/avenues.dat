The alternative to the bypass is going through the city via Ljubljanska, Zagrebačka and Slavonska <b>avenues.</b> Despite being a shorter and a more direct route, those <b>avenues</b> are much more congested than the bypass at rush hours and they contain at-grade intersections and traffic lights at some of their junctions.|$|E
