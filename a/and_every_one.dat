5|$|Ross {{fell ill}} again in September 1863. From September 27 through March 1864, he {{suffered}} recurring attacks of fever and chills every three days, symptomatic of tertian malaria. Despite his illness, Ross {{never missed a}} day of duty, and in early 1864 {{he was promoted to}} brigadier general, becoming the ninth-youngest general officer of the Confederate Army. Following his promotion, unit morale improved, <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>one</b> of his men re-enlisted.|$|E
5|$|While Shakespeare's {{daffodil}} is {{the wild}} or true English daffodil (N. pseudonarcissus), many other species were introduced, {{some of which}} escaped and naturalised, particularly N. biflorus (a hybrid) in Devon and the west of England. Gerard, in his extensive discussion of daffodils, both wild and cultivated ("bastard daffodils") described twenty four species in London gardens (1597), ("we have them all <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>one</b> of them in our London gardens, in great abundance", p.114).|$|E

25|$|Donald Macalastair of Druim-a-ghinnir on the Isle of Arran told a {{story of}} the fairies journeying to Ireland. The ragwort was their {{transport}} <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>one</b> of them picked a plant, sat astride and arrived in Ireland in an instant.|$|E
25|$|The {{same year}} E. Jay Quinby hand {{published}} a document exposing {{the ownership of}} National City Lines (General Motors, Firestone Tire, and Phillips Petroleum). He addressed the publication to The Mayors; The City Manager; The City Transit Engineer; The members of The Committee on Mass-Transportation and The Tax-Payers and The Riding Citizens of Your Community. In it he wrote This is an urgent warning to each <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>one</b> of {{you that there is}} a careful, deliberately planned campaign to swindle you out of your most important and valuable public utilities–your Electric Railway System.|$|E

25|$|Menéndez {{placed his}} main {{reliance}} on the fort, <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>one</b> {{of the people he}} had landed now labored to throw up the earthworks and defenses, while he superintended the disembarkation of artillery and ammunition, supplies and tools. During the work some of Ribault's vessels appeared—they might have made a dash and captured the Spanish commander, but they merely reconnoitred, and retired to report. The work on defenses continued apace, and Menéndez, unable to compete with the French on the sea, sent off his larger vessels, retaining only some light craft.|$|E
25|$|Following Super Bowl XXXII, {{which was}} played at Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego, Super Bowl XXXIII would mark {{the last time}} {{back-to-back}} Super Bowls were played outdoors until Super Bowls XLIII, which was held at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, and XLIV, which was played at Pro Player Stadium, now known as Hard Rock Stadium. This started a streak of 11 straight Super Bowls in which every game with the NFC as the home team was played outdoors <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>one</b> with the AFC as the home team was played indoors (incidentally, these games were followed by three Super Bowls played indoors, as Cowboys Stadium, Lucas Oil Stadium, and the Superdome were chosen as the sites of Super Bowls XLV-XLVII; Super Bowls XLV and XLVI were played in stadiums with retractable roofs that were closed {{prior to the start}} of the game).|$|E
25|$|On {{the evening}} of 4 March 1804, John Cavenah set fire to his hut at Castle Hill at 8:00 as the signal for the {{rebellion}} to begin. While this fire was not seen by the convicts at Green Hills, today's Windsor, on the Hawkesbury River, Cunningham activated the plan to gather weapons, ammunition, food and recruits from local supporters and the government farm at Castle Hill. With Cunningham leading, about 200 to 300 rebels broke into the Government Farm's buildings, taking firearms, ammunition, and other weapons. The constables and overseers were overpowered and the rebels then went from farm to farm {{on their way to}} Constitution Hill at Parramatta, seizing more weapons and supplies including rum and spirits, and recruiting others to join their cause. Their move had been informed from the intelligence gathered a year previous when 12 convicts de-camped from Castle Hill scouring the surrounding districts seeking out friends and sympathisers. On capture each <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>one</b> had the same story – they were heading to China by crossing over the Blue Mountains.|$|E

500|$|Iowa {{completed}} her presidential escort mission on 16 December by returning the President to the United States. Roosevelt addressed {{the crew of}} Iowa prior to leaving by stating, [...] "...from all I have seen and all I have heard, the Iowa is a 'happy ship,' and having served with the Navy for many years, I know—and you know—what that means." [...] He also touched on the progress made at the conference before concluding his address with [...] "...good luck, and remember that I am with you in spirit, each <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>one</b> of you." ...|$|E
500|$|Davis {{narrowly}} won the Democratic primary election, defeating Elwood Caudill Jr., {{a deputy}} clerk in the Rowan County property valuation administrator's office, by 23 votes and {{advancing to the}} general election against Republican John Cox. Davis won the election, with Cox subsequently alleging that nepotism was to blame for his loss. After winning the race, Davis told The Morehead News, [...] "My words can never express the appreciation but I promise to each <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>one</b> that I will be the very best working clerk that I can be {{and will be a}} good steward of their tax dollars and follow the statutes of this office to the letter." ...|$|E
500|$|During the Verizon Ladies First Tour {{which also}} {{featured}} Alicia Keys, Missy Elliott and Tamia, Beyoncé performed [...] "Me, Myself and I" [...] in New York City {{to an audience}} of over 20,000. Before singing, she told the audience {{that she was going to}} sing about [...] "a relationship horror story". She pulled a pair of red panties out of her purse, saying that these were not hers but belonged to her cheating boyfriend's mistress. During the performance, Beyoncé held out the microphone for the audience's response, which was [...] "is all I got in the end". She shouted that she wanted to hear everybody from front to back, and continued singing, then told the audience that she wrote the song for [...] "each <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>one</b> of y'all!".|$|E

500|$|In 1973–74, Orr led the Bruins {{to another}} first-place {{finish in the}} regular season. His point total rebounded to 122 with 32 goals and 90 assists. [...] The Bruins {{made it to the}} Stanley Cup final, but lost this time to the Philadelphia Flyers. Flyers' coach Fred Shero commented: [...] "They had Orr and he can do an awful lot. But we've got 17 good hockey players <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>one</b> of them put out. It was 17 against one." [...] That season, Orr set the record (since surpassed) for the most points in a game by a defenceman, scoring 3 goals and 4 assists in a November 15, 1973 game against the New York Rangers. One goal, a shot from the blue line, broke Rangers' defenceman Rod Seiling's stick.|$|E
500|$|Now {{my great}} plan, which was {{conceived}} of old, ... {{is to let}} nothing be wilfully left unexamined. Nothing is to be holy ground consecrated to Stationary Faith, whether positive or negative. All fallow land is to be ploughed up and a regular system of rotation followed. ... Never hide anything, be it weed or no, nor seem to wish it hidden. ... Again I assert the Right of Trespass on any plot of Holy Ground which any man has set apart. ... Now I am convinced that no one but a Christian can actually purge his land of these holy spots. ... I do not say that no Christians have enclosed places of this sort. Many have a great deal, <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>one</b> has some. But there are extensive and important tracts in {{the territory of the}} Scoffer, the Pantheist, the Quietist, Formalist, Dogmatist, Sensualist, and the rest, which are openly and solemnly Tabooed. ..." ...|$|E
500|$|... {{offers a}} {{different}} theory: The Acra {{was still standing}} in 139BCE when AntiochusVII Sidetes demanded it back from Simon, along with Jaffa and Gezer, two Hellenized cities Simon had captured. Simon was willing to discuss the two cities but {{made no mention of}} the Acra. It was at this point that he must have sealed its fate, as a way to deny the Seleucids any future claim or hold on Jerusalem. Thus, when AntiochusVII subdued the city during Hyrcanus I's reign, each <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>one</b> of his demands were met—except the one demanding the stationing of a Seleucid garrison in the city. Hyrcanus may have been able to reject, and Antiochus to drop, this demand because there was nowhere to billet the garrison, as the Acra would no longer have been standing. This explanation places the razing of the Acra somewhere in the 130sBCE.|$|E

500|$|Rhimes {{entitled}} the episode [...] "Losing My Religion" [...] {{because she felt}} [...] "that {{is what happens to}} each intern in this episode. Each intern lets go of the things they've held onto all season. George lets go of loving Meredith. Cristina lets go of her well-checked emotions. Izzie is forced to let go of her idealism. And that leads to her letting go of medicine. Alex lets go of his rage against Izzie. And Meredith... well, Meredith just lets go." [...] The costumes were designed by Mimi Melgaard; Rhimes noted that everyone was dressed in dark funeral colors to the prom, except Stevens who was dressed in pink. Stevens' dress was an Amsale creation. Monologues done by the five main characters were used in this episode. Rhimes commented: [...] "this was something we'd never done and I wasn't sure would work. But you place those pages {{into the hands of the}} actors and each <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>one</b> of them layered their characters' souls right into the dialogue." [...] The episode's theme was the prom; Rhimes said she wanted to do it since the beginning of the season.|$|E
500|$|World Painted Blood {{marked the}} first time that the band wrote {{material}} in the studio rather than entering the studio fully prepared with lyrics. The fact that they were not prepared made guitarist Kerry King skeptical. King related: [...] "I was kind of thinking, 'Man, this could be the first record in a long time that's got a little bit of filler,'" [...] he acknowledges. [...] "But I think every song came out great. I was concerned some would sound similar, <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>one</b> is completely different. It's cool how it worked out." [...] The majority of the lyrics and music were written by guitarist Jeff Hanneman. Kerry King stated: [...] "I like when Jeff writes as much as he did for this record. When you have one guy doing most of the writing you only get one perspective. A lot of Jeff's stuff has a very punky vibe this time; the stuff I write sounds thrashy but with a hint of punk, and when Jeff writes the stuff is more punk with a hint of thrash. It works together well." [...] Unlike 2006's Christ Illusion, the band was [...] "under-ready" [...] with their lyrics and music.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Indie Journal, Joseph said that when writing music he prefers {{to concentrate on the}} melody first, stating, [...] "Basically, I write from a two-person standpoint. [...] First, I let the song take hold and I put down the idea as a raw emotional statement. Then I let it breathe and come back, approaching from more of an objective point of view. This allows me to rediscover the true meaning I intended in the beginning, shedding new light on how I can best represent that to the listener." [...] This same concept is explained again in a taped interview with the Government Television Network with Joseph explaining that a lot of times he may only come up with part of a melody. [...] Then he would let it rest and come back to it and see if it feels right. [...] Then he would start [...] "building around it", [...] like putting a car together - start with a frame and then start building things around it. Musically, he tries to connect a common bridge between such exhilarating feelings as performing at the Acropolis, to the emotions each <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>one</b> feels every day. [...] "In the end, a good melody will always stand the test of time", says Joseph.|$|E
