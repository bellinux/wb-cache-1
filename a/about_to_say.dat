25|$|Turón, {{one of the}} locales of anticlerical violence, a coal-mining town in the Asturias Province, was a hub of anti-government and anticlerical agitation. The De La Salle Brothers, who ran {{a school}} there, angered the leftists who ran Turón, because of their {{exercise}} of religion and their flouting of the constitutional prohibition on religious instruction. On October 5, 1934, the agents of the local rebel government invaded the order's residence on the pretext that they had concealed weapons. A Passionist priest, Father Inocencio, now Saint Innocencio of Mary Immaculate, who had arrived the evening of October 4 was <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> Mass for the brothers. He and the brothers were taken and held without trial and summarily shot {{in the middle of}} the night in the cemetery.|$|E
25|$|In a magician's {{house on}} another island, Lucy {{attempts}} {{to perform a}} spell {{that would make her}} tragically beautiful, despite being warned of negative consequences. Just as she is <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> the words, however, she sees an image of Aslan snarling at her, frightening her from reading the spell (in the 2010 film, she reads the spell and turns into a version of Susan and finds her brothers have not heard of Lucy or Narnia). Aslan also reprimands her for using another spell to see what her friends say about her. She encounters a story-spell that she feels is the best story ever that disappears after she reads it, and Aslan reassures her that she will be able to read it again.|$|E
25|$|After Sigismund III {{was elected}} in 1587, Elizabeth's {{intelligence}} service gave notice that an ambassador was in transit and that the deputation was one of amity. On 23 July 1587, the Privy Council instructed the Lord Mayor of London to arrange housing for the diplomat, preferably with a merchant prominent in the Baltic trade. To ensure Elizabeth would not find fault with the preparations, the Lord Mayor was to report the arrangements made. Two days later a Polish envoy, Paweł Działyński, arrived at the palace in Greenwich. Brought to the reception hall, he found Elizabeth sitting on the throne under the canopy of state with all her nobles in attendance. The ambassador presented his credentials, and kissed the Queen's hand extended to him―a gesture of royal favour. Działyński then strode to {{the centre of the}} chamber without any forewarning of what he was <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> and, instead of the oration of a legate that everyone anticipated, he couched in respectful words to flatter the monarch being addressed and spoke as a herald. In Latin, he hectored, admonished and criticized the queen, and declared an ultimatum of capitulation to terms or hostile action.|$|E

500|$|In {{the same}} interview, Gates said: [...] "I agree {{with people like}} Richard Dawkins that mankind felt the need for {{creation}} myths. Before we really began to understand disease and the weather and things like that, we sought false explanations for them. Now science has filled {{in some of the}} realm– not all– that religion used to fill. But the mystery and the beauty of the world is overwhelmingly amazing, and there's no scientific explanation of how it came <b>about.</b> <b>To</b> <b>say</b> that it was generated by random numbers, that does seem, you know, sort of an uncharitable view [...] I think it makes sense to believe in God, but exactly what decision in your life you make differently because of it, I don't know." ...|$|E
500|$|Campling {{and other}} critics have commented {{that one of the}} main {{features}} of the show is the ability of the locals to laugh at themselves and their eccentricities. Campling wrote of the Skipton show: [...] "The ability to laugh at itself is one of this country's finest attributes, but the Skipton mob were only too happy to celebrate their insularity." [...] Elisabeth Mahoney of The Guardian, who reviewed the Dartford episode, said: [...] "Going to a place and insulting it takes guts and careful strategies. Steel made use {{of the fact that he}} is from nearby Swanley, both to signal that he knows the area but also that – whatever he was <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about Dartford – it was better than his hometown." [...] Another journalist, reviewing the Penzance episode in the North Devon Journal commented: [...] "Why do we like programmes that laugh at us? Because, I hope, we laugh at ourselves. We're not ignorant of our stereotypes. West Cornwall? Aaarrrrr!" ...|$|E
500|$|The Duke and Duchess {{settled in}} France. In May 1939, the Duke was {{commissioned}} by NBC to give a radio broadcast (his first since abdicating) {{during a visit to}} the battlefields of Verdun. In it he appealed for peace, saying [...] "I am deeply conscious of the presence of the great company of the dead, and I am convinced that could they make their voices heard they would be with me in what I am <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> I speak simply as a soldier of the Last War whose most earnest prayer it is that such cruel and destructive madness shall never again overtake mankind. There is no land whose people want war." [...] The broadcast was heard across the world and by millions in America. It was widely seen as supporting appeasement, and the BBC refused to broadcast it. It was broadcast outside the United States on shortwave radio and was reported in full by British broadsheet newspapers.|$|E

2500|$|In Dublin in 1952 Erwin Schrödinger gave {{a lecture}} in which {{at one point}} he jocularly warned his {{audience}} that what he was <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> might [...] "seem lunatic".

This is the earliest known reference to the Many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.|$|E

He reiterated that it was useless to 'become censorious <b>about</b> , <b>to</b> <b>say</b> there is no God'.

[...] During the drop there was an audible crack indicating that his neck was broken. After Saddam was suspended for a few minutes, the doctor present listened with a stethoscope for a heartbeat.

2500|$|In Elizabeth's early life, she {{periodically}} blacked out.

The pilgrims said they would accept him if he would prove himself by telling them their names and indicating how much money they had.
