60|$|LADY WINDERMERE. [Moving slowly {{away from}} <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with startled eyes.] I have not the courage.|$|R

6000|$|... 'In quiet!' {{repeated}} brother Charles mildly, <b>and</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> {{with more}} of pity than reproach. 'To pursue HIS way in quiet!' ...|$|R
