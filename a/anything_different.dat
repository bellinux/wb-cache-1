5|$|Neither of the album's singles were {{particularly}} successful on the US Billboard charts, although the album's title song enjoyed some {{success on the}} adult contemporary format, where it peaked at number twenty-three. Critical response to the album was generally mixed, with critics praising Strip Mes polished production, but stating that Bedingfield failed to deliver <b>anything</b> <b>different</b> or outstanding. The album debuted at number 103 on US Billboard 200 with 10,000 copies sold, a significant drop compared to her previous album, which debuted at number three, and sold five times as many copies.|$|E
25|$|In the Cohen et al. study, the MOT task {{involved}} viewing eight black moving discs presented {{against a}} changing background {{that consisted of}} randomly colored checkerboard masks. Four of these discs were picked out and participants were instructed to track these four discs. The RSVP task involved viewing a stream of letters and digits presented against a series of changing checkerboards, and {{counting the number of}} times a digit was presented. In both experiments, the critical trial involved a natural scene suddenly replacing the second last checkerboard, and participants were immediately afterwards asked whether they had noticed <b>anything</b> <b>different,</b> as well as presented with six questions to determine whether they had categorized the scene. The dual-task condition simply involved participants performing the MOT task mentioned above and a scene-classification task simultaneously. The authors varied the difficulty of the task (i.e. how demanding the task was) by increasing or decreasing the speed of the moving discs.|$|E
500|$|The {{history of}} the name Allāh in English was {{probably}} influenced by the study of comparative religion in the 19th century; for example, Thomas Carlyle (1840) sometimes used the term Allah but without any implication that Allah was <b>anything</b> <b>different</b> from God. However, in his biography of Muḥammad (1934), Tor Andræ always used the term Allah, though he allows that this [...] "conception of God" [...] seems to imply that it {{is different from that}} of the Jewish and Christian theologies.|$|E

After growing frustrated with the lack of answers regarding his health condition, Burnley decided to abandon searching for a diagnosis and focus on the album. Recorded and produced at a personal studio of Burnley's, Dark Before Dawn is the first album with the front man credited as the producer.

[...] He {{became the first}} Rangers pitcher to win 16 games since Kevin Millwood in 2006. [...] It was his seventh win in a row, eighth {{straight}} road victory (a new Texas record), and 12th road win overall in 2009 (another new club record, and tops in the AL). [...] "I'm not doing <b>anything</b> <b>different</b> on the road than I am at home", said Feldman, who had allowed only one run in the last 26.1 innings. [...] "The preparation is the same.

[...] Outfielder Marlon Byrd said: [...] "When you have your ace on the mound, you expect to win. You {{get a couple of}} runs early, and you feel you have a 'W' in hand.

2500|$|Like Hitler, Featherston {{wrote a book}} {{expressing his}} {{political}} and racial views called Over Open Sights, an analog to Mein Kampf. The {{title of the book}} is a reference to Featherston’s career as an artillery sergeant. [...] Featherston started writing this book back during the defeat of the Confederate States of America in the Great War of 1914–1917. His embitterment over his lack of promotion, coupled with his resentment in the general atmosphere of defeat and his view that the CSA’s blacks had [...] "stabbed the country in the back," [...] is spoken clearly in the novel. [...] It was published just prior to the Second Great War. [...] While most Confederates bought the book, many characters remarked there wasn't <b>anything</b> <b>different</b> than what they had heard already from Featherston's radio broadcasts.|$|E
2500|$|Ravel was a {{stringent}} {{critic of}} his own work. During Boléros composition, he said to Joaquín Nin that the work had [...] "no form, properly speaking, no development, no or almost no modulation".

Before its first performance, I issued a warning to the effect that what I had written was a piece lasting seventeen minutes and consisting wholly of [...] "orchestral tissue without music" [...] — of one very long, gradual crescendo. There are no contrasts, and practically no invention except the plan and the manner of execution.|$|E

Why shouldn't I be known to be doing it? You know, why shouldn't I get the credit for something that I'm actually doing?' So I just basically did it, and I didn't tell anybody, whereas the process before was, I would tell people that I was getting ready to do it, then we would gear up to do it, and then people would get involved, and the credit would go wherever. So I just didn't tell a single soul I was doing it, I just did it in my own studio, and it was great." ...|$|E
