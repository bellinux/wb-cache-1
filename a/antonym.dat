25|$|Proletarian internationalism saw {{itself as}} a {{deterrent}} against war, because people with a common interest {{are less likely to}} take up arms against one another, instead focusing on fighting the ruling class. According to Marxist theory, the <b>antonym</b> of proletarian internationalism is bourgeois nationalism. Some Marxists, together with others on the left, view nationalism, racism (including anti-Semitism) and religion as divide and conquer tactics used by the ruling classes to prevent the working class from uniting against them. Left-wing movements therefore have often taken up anti-imperialist positions. Anarchism has developed a critique of nationalism that focuses on nationalism's role in justifying and consolidating state power and domination. Through its unifying goal, nationalism strives for centralization, both in specific territories and in a ruling elite of individuals, while it prepares a population for capitalist exploitation. Within anarchism, this subject has been treated extensively by Rudolf Rocker in Nationalism and Culture and by the works of Fredy Perlman, such as Against His-Story, Against Leviathan and The Continuing Appeal of Nationalism.|$|E
500|$|In {{an attempt}} to refocus the debate, Ezra Levant, a {{conservative}} political activist and former publisher of the Western Standard, examines the ethical aspects of importing oil from countries where political oppression and human rights violations are prevalent, and argues that oil sands production from Canada should be considered the only true ethical alternative to OPEC oil exports. His inspiration for the concept of 'ethical oil' came from the neologism 'conflict diamond', and its <b>antonym</b> 'conflict-free diamond'. Levant decided {{to write the book}} to change some minds, after realizing at the 2009 Ottawa International Writers Festival in Ottawa that he was the [...] "token Alberta whipping boy" [...] during a panel on the oil sands, and ineffective at convincing the audience of the merits of the oil sands. Ezra Levant stated that he wrote the book from a liberal point of view, in order to appeal to those who reject the traditional conservative point of view.|$|E

40|$|Abstrack This study {{deals with}} the {{linguistic}} field. Researchers focus on semantic research issues that are relationships between forms and meanings that involve synonyms and polysemics, relations between two meanings involving hyponim and <b>antonyms,</b> and relations between two forms involving homonyms. The method used in this research is descriptive method with qualitative research form. Sources of data {{in this study are}} native speakers Ketapang dialect Malay language obtained through observation and recording field directly. The data in the study are related to synonyms, <b>antonyms,</b> polysemics, hyponimes, and homonyms. The technique used in this research is direct technique that is simak method, skill method and documentary study. The data collection tools used in this research are questionnaires, picture lists, and folklore. Based on the results of existing data analysis, it can be concluded that in Ketapang dialect Malay language there are 157 words containing semantic relation, 52 synonyms consist of 13 complete and total synonyms, 21 complete but not total synonyms, 10 synonyms incomplete but total, 8 synonyms Complete and not total. 65 <b>antonyms</b> consisting of 30 twin <b>antonyms,</b> 13 polar <b>antonyms,</b> 11 relational <b>antonyms,</b> 5 hierarchial <b>antonyms,</b> and 6 compound <b>antonyms.</b> 13 polysemics, 13 hyponimes, and 14 hyponimes...|$|R

Unlike the concept of synonymity, which dates back to Aristotle, the concept of antonymy is of recent origin [...] the Webster 2 ̆ 7 s New Dictionary of Synonyms dates the first {{use of the term}} to 1867. Since the term was coined, people have accepted the concept and have felt quite capable of recognizing or generating <b>antonyms.</b> However, little thought has been given to opposites which resemble antonymy but are clearly not <b>antonyms.</b> These words, called pseudoantonyms, appear to be <b>antonyms</b> at first glance but closer inspection shows that they are not...|$|R
40|$|Distrust should {{automatically}} activate a "thinking the opposite". Thus, {{according to}} Schul, Mayo and Burnstein (2004), subjects detect <b>antonyms</b> of adjectives faster {{when confronted with}} untrustworthy rather than trustworthy faces. We conducted four experiments within their paradigm to test whether the response latency of detecting <b>antonyms</b> remains stable. We introduced the following changes: the paradigm was applied with and without an induction phase, faces were culturally adapted, the stimuli were presented according more to priming rules, and the canonicity of <b>antonyms</b> was controlled. Results show that the response latency of detecting <b>antonyms</b> is difficult to predict. Even if faces are culturally adapted and priming rules are applied more strictly, response latency depends on whether the induction phase is applied and on the canonicity of <b>antonyms</b> {{rather than on the}} trustworthiness of faces. In general, this paradigm seems not to be appropriate to test thinking the opposite under distrust...|$|R

2500|$|... is a Medieval Latin term {{literally}} meaning [...] "popular" [...] or [...] "of the people". In Medieval Western Europe non-native Latin was [...] {{the language}} of science, church and administration, hence theodiscus {{was used as an}} <b>antonym</b> of Latin, to refer to the [...] "native language spoken by the general populace". The term was subsequently used in the Frankish Empire to denote the native Germanic vernaculars. As such, it was no longer used as <b>antonym</b> of Latin, but of walhisk, a language descendent from Latin, but nevertheless the speech of the general populace as well. In doing so theodiscus effectively obtained the meaning of [...] "Germanic", or more specifically one of its local varieties – resulting in the English exonym , the German endonym , and the Dutch exonym , all of which are all cognates of theodiscus.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{immediately}} useful derivational affixes for the beginner is the prefix mal-, which derives antonyms: peza (heavy), malpeza (light); supren (upwards), malsupren (downwards); ami (tolove), malami (tohate); lumo (light), mallumo (darkness). However, except in jokes, this prefix is not used when an <b>antonym</b> exists in the basic vocabulary: suda (south), not [...] "malnorda" [...] from 'north'; manki (tolack, intr.), not [...] "malesti" [...] from 'tobe'.|$|E
40|$|This {{article is}} a window into {{conceptual}} space through <b>antonyms,</b> negated <b>antonyms</b> and <b>antonyms</b> modified by degree modifiers. It investigates native speakers’ understanding of negation in combination with BOUNDED antonymic adjectival meanings and also {{in relation to their}} interpretations of the approximating degree modifier, ‘almost’ in Swedish. The results of the investigation are compared with a similar study by Paradis and Willners (2006), which includes ‘not’ with UNBOUNDED SCALE meanings and in relation to ‘fairly’. We propose that ‘not’ is a degree modifier and like all other degree modifiers it operates on the configurational construals in SPACE. In combination with BOUNDED <b>antonyms</b> ‘not’ operates on the boundary and bisects a spatial structure. The combinations of ‘not’ and BOUNDED meanings are interpreted as synonyms of their <b>antonyms.</b> ‘Almost closed’ differs significantly from ‘closed’ but is not significantly different from ‘not open’. In contrast, in combination with UNBOUNDED <b>antonyms,</b> ‘not’ modifies the UNBOUNDED SCALE structure and evokes a range on the scale in SPACE {{in the same way as}} ‘fairly’ does. While the results for the UNBOUNDED meanings are very robust across all test items, the BOUNDED meanings are much more volatile and adaptive to alternative scalar interpretations...|$|R

Altruism or selflessness is the opposite of selfishness. The word was coined by the French philosopher Auguste Comte in French, as altruisme, for an <b>antonym</b> of egoism.
