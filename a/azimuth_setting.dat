40|$|The {{middle to}} late Miocene Monterey Formation of coastal California {{is a source}} and {{reservoir}} {{for the majority of}} hydrocarbons found in the Santa Barbara - Ventura Basin. The reservoir is unique in that conduits for hydrocarbon migration are primarily systems of interconnected fractures, faults and breccias. Fracture related data was collected from wave-cut terraces and dip-slope, beach cliff exposures along Gaviota Beach, approximately 30 miles west of Santa Barbara, off of highway 101 in Santa Barbara County, California. Five systematic sets were identified with mean orientations of 13 ° ± 8 ° <b>azimuth</b> (<b>set</b> 1), 38 ° ± 7. 5 ° (set IV), 78 ° ± 5 ° (set V), 115 ° ± 5 ° (set II) and 174 ° ± 7. 5 ° <b>azimuth</b> (<b>set</b> III). Sets I, II and IV are most abundant in the area and their angular relationships correlate well with offshore core data from the Holly Platform. Outcrop data from this local matches well with data collected by previous researchers at Arroy Burro Beach suggesting that the observed geometries are a large scale, regional phenomenon and likely predictable. Fracture characteristics vary between lithologic packages or cycles; in that neighboring cycles may exhibit differing fracture set geometries. This fracture partitioning appears to occur at various scales from centimeters to meter scales. Data suggest that cycle boundaries act as mechanical boundaries enabling each cycle to behave separate from one another on a 1 - 1. 5 meter scale. There likely exists a mechanical package on a scale of tens of meters controlling the propagation of large pervasive fractures which cut through numerous cycle boundaries before propagation is halted. This larger scale mechanical boundary may overprint the 1 - 1. 5 meter mechanical packages previously described. The effects of weathering or subaerial processes on fractures, in fine-grained siliceous sediments, is generally restricted to the enhancement or widening of the fracture aperture. Data were collected along a stratigraphic horizon between minimally exposed wave-cut terraces and laterally equivalent, fully exposed dip-slopes. Generally the average aperture increased by 0. 02 ± 0. 002 mm/m from middle terrace to dip-slope exposure. The rate at which this occurs through time requires further study...|$|R

By restricting emitted energy to a sub-circular arc and narrow vertical coverage the design makes efficient use of relatively low power transmitter equipment.

In Interferometric Wide Swath (IW) mode, three subswaths imaged {{in the novel}} Terrain Observation by Progressive Scans (TOPS) SAR mode result in a total swath width of 250 km. Sentinel- 1 has become the European {{workhorse}} for large area mapping and interferometric monitoring at medium resolution. The interferometric processing of TOPS data requires however special consideration of the signal properties, resulting from the ScanSAR-type burst imaging and the antenna beam steering in azimuth. The high Doppler rate in <b>azimuth</b> <b>sets</b> very stringent coregistration requirements, making the use of Enhanced Spectral Diversity (ESD) necessary to obtain the required fine azimuth coregistration accuracy. Other unique aspects of processing IW data, such as azimuth spectral filtering, image resampling and data deramping and reramping, are reviewed giving a recipe-like description that enables the user community to use Sentinel- 1 IW mode repeat-pass SAR data. Interferometric results from Sentinel- 1 A are provided, demonstrating the mapping capacity of the S- 1 system and its interferometric suitability for geophysical applications. An interferometric evaluation of a coherent interferometric pair over Salar de Uyuni, Bolivia is provided, where several aspects related to coregistration, deramping and synchronization are analysed. Additionally, a spatial and temporal evaluation of the along-track shifts, which {{are directly related to}} the orbital/instrument timing error, measured from the SAR data is shown that justifies the necessity to refine the azimuth shifts with ESD.

However, the seismic interference resulting from one or more ‘other’ sources needs to be well understood and the appropriate processing strategies {{need to be developed}} for the method to fulfil its promise. In this paper, a modified inversion approach is presented for the effective separation of sources in marine simultaneous shooting acquisition. The method aims to distribute all energy in the simultaneous shot records by reconstructing the individual shot records at their respective locations. The method is applied to a wide <b>azimuth</b> data <b>set</b> acquired in the Gulf of Mexico where two sources out of four in total were fired simultaneously.

On the nose the aerial was a double arrowhead shape with a pair of azimuth aerials protruding above and below the leading edge of each wing between the cannon and the wingtip. A pair of elevation aerials were located above and below the wing surfaces near the RAF roundel on the starboard side. The indicator display consisted of two cathode ray tubes.

Operators like Rawnsley were left to do a fair amount of guesswork. No scales or calibration markings were put on early sets. The position and heading of the enemy in the azimuth plane, its height, and its range had to be guessed.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss the {{possibility}} of locating a neutron source in space using a scanning-based method, relative to the three-dimensional location of the detector. The scanning system comprises an organic liquid scintillator detector, a tungsten collimator and adjustable equatorial mount. The detector output is connected to a bespoke fast digitiser (Hybrid Instruments Ltd., UK) which streams digital samples to a personal computer. A neutron source has been attached to a vertical wall and the data have been collected in two stages. In the first case, the scanning system was placed a couple of metres {{away from the wall}} and, in the second case it moved few centimetres from the previous location, parallel to the wall. In each case data were collected from a grid of measurement points (<b>set</b> of <b>azimuth</b> angles for <b>set</b> of elevation angles) which covered the source on the wall. The discrimination of fast neutrons and gamma rays, detected by organic liquid scintillator detector, is carried out on the basis of pulse gradient analysis. Images are then produced in terms of the angular distribution of events for total counts, gamma rays and neutrons for both cases. The three-dimensional location of the neutron source can be obtained by considering the relative separation of the centres of the corresponding images of angular distribution of events.

40|$|LANDSAT {{images are}} most useful for {{geological}} lineament extraction, especially for large-scale lineaments. However, {{because of the}} nature of the LANDSAT orbit, there are almost no lineaments in the same direction as the sun angle. In this report, a new technique which can generate virtual LANDSAT images with any sun directions is described. In order to eliminate shadows from the original LANDSAT image, a shadow-free land cover classification was first applied. Shadow areas were classified into four categories using spectral features. Pixel values in each categories of the original image were scaled to the values of corresponding categories in no-shadow areas, by coinciding the mean and standard deviation of each spectral bands. Next, a three-dimensional model of the object area was constructed from the National Land Information Data Base. Assuming a specific sun elevation and azimuth, the shadowed areas can be calculated from this model. A cosine correction was made using the angle between the sun light axis and the plane direction. In addition, reflective intensities were calculated according to a three dimensional reflective model. An artificially shadowed LANDSAT image with specific sun angle was thus obtained. For lineament extraction, a sun azimuth was selected perpendicular to the real sun <b>azimuth.</b> A complete <b>set</b> of lineaments was obtained by combining the two results extracted from these two images. Furthermore, the influence of sun elevation on lineament enhancements is also discussed. In conclusion, a technique to generate a virtual LANDSAT image with illumination at any sun angle was established. with the aid of this virtual image, lineament extraction becomes more complete...|$|R

However, building megalithic graves fell into disuse post- 1000 AD for yet unknown reasons. The state of Tamil Nadu, southern India, hosts {{a large number}} of such megalithic sites and one monument, in particular, erected in the small panchayat town of Pallikonda, demands special attention. The site harbors a large, non-sepulchral stone arrangement comprising a large capstone balanced on three boulders. The entire structure lies {{at the foot of the}} large Pallikonda hill and overlooks the fertile basin of the Palar river. The capstone is oriented in the north-south axis, with a double projection that points towards north-west. Spatial analysis of the site reveals several unique features of the megalith. The structure is positioned strategically, so that a straight line drawn from the tip of the hill and passing through the north-west projection of the cap stone points towards the confluence of rivers Palar and Koundanyanadi, and on further extrapolation, to the summer solstice sunset. It is positioned at a point separating the arable from the non-arable lands. The capstone of the structure is dotted with cupules, some of which form distinct sightlines. Most of the sightlines match with the Iron age rising and <b>setting</b> <b>azimuths</b> of the stars Vega, Capella, Cassiopeia and Deneb.

40|$|Because of {{its high}} seismic hazard the urban area of Oliveri has been subject of a study on seismic microzonation at first level (OPCM 3907 / 2010). The urban area {{develops}} on a large coastal plain made of Late Pleistocene and Holocene mixed fluvial/marine sediments, that mainly consist of silty sands and gravels. The eastern part of this plain {{is dominated by the}} alluvial deposits of the Elicona torrent. The coastal and alluvial sediments overlap a complexly deformed substrate made of Hercynian metamorphites (Aspromonte unit), the Capo d’Orlando Flysch, the Antisicilide Argille Scagliose and Pleistocene clays and calcarenites. This area is affected by high uplift rates as recently estimated in the adjacent Furnari zone. In order to define a preliminary subsurface model for the first level of microzonation, we performed 23 HVSR measurements, homogeneously distributed in the area with a minimum spacing of 250 m, integrating a few available well-log data. All the significant peaks of the H/V spectra in the frequency range 0. 6 - 10 Hz have been identified. Their attribution to resonance phenomena of buried structures has been validated in agreement with SESAME criteria, sample standard deviation of the spectral coefficients and independence from the <b>azimuth.</b> A <b>set</b> of 23 vectors, containing Cartesian coordinates, central frequency and amplitude for each peak was used to identify a subsets which can be reasonably attributed to a continuous phenomenon with respect to the position, using a clustering technique. The outlier peaks were attributed to minor topographic sources or to features of the source noise and therefore they were not considered. Two clusters related to sets of points that cover a significant fraction of the investigated area were used to construct two different frequency maps by kriging interpolation. From the HVSR curves of the two clusters 1 D models of S-wave velocity have been obtained. The HVSR data inversion has been constrained by stratigraphic data of a near borehole and by the related vertical seismic profile. To map the depth of the seismic bedrock, from the complete set of modelparameters we extracted only the depths of two seismic interfaces. The depth of an interface was set equal to zero where the peak related to the resonance frequency of the covering layer is absent and lithologies, mechanically compatible with seismic bedrock, outcrop. The reconstructed outline of the top of the seismic bedrock allow us to highlight its deepening below the mouth of the Elicona Torrent, thus suggesting the possible presence of a buried paleo-valley...|$|R
40|$|Geometric and {{mechanical}} characterisation of rock discontinuities {{is an essential}} constituent in deriving a reliable assessment of overall properties of crystalline rock mass. The knowledge about the occurrence, size, geometry pattern and intensity of joints/fractures is necessary to predict the performance of fractured rock as a fractured reservoir, or an underground transport and storage facility. This study has a main focus on the characterisation and description of discontinuities {{and their impact on}} mechanical and hydraulic behavior of discontinuous crystalline rock mass. The study is divided into two main topics: (i) determining joint geometry from seismic attributes induced during pressurization of a geothermal reservoir, (ii) stochastic fracture modeling and probabilistic predictions of stability for underground excavations. The orientation of the major joint sets within the Hot Dry Rock geothermal reservoir at Soultz-sous-Forêts in France is inferred from studying the spatial variation of the seismic estimates of shear displacement and stress drop during water injection into the reservoir. The variation pattern of the seismic source attributes obtained from variogram function proves to correlate with fracture dip angle along vertical plane and with fracture <b>set</b> <b>azimuth</b> in horizontal plane. The study shows that using water injection-induced seismicity offers a potential to make inferences about the possible fluid flow paths in the reservoir far from the injection well. The stochastic fracture models are designed for making predictions of the CLAB 2 rock cavern's stability located on the southeast coast of Sweden and aimed to serve as interim storage facility for spent nuclear fuel. The generated fracture networks incorporate fracture size, orientations, intensity, spatial variation pattern and fracture termination mode. The properties of the networks are represented by the best-match probability functions. The predictions of the occurrence and stability status of keyblocks are made. The predictions are presented as probability density functions and the appropriateness of the distributional parameters for further tunnel support design is discussed. Also, the sensitivity of the block predictions to uncertainty in estimating the properties of the stochastic fracture network is investigated by statistic factorial designs. The study not only demonstrates the advantages of the probabilistic predictions over the deterministic approaches but also their interpretational complexity...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} we present {{and discuss the}} results of ambient seismic noise {{analyses}} computed at four sites where seismic stations, managed by the INGV (Italian Institute for Geophysics and Vulcanology) and the DPC (Italian Department of Civil Protection), are installed inside buildings. The experiments were performed considering different types of installation: sensor located {{at the bottom of}} a school, directly installed on rock (case 1); sensor located {{at the bottom of a}} medieval fortress, built on an isolate hill, directly installed on rock (case 2); sensor installed on the foundations of a medieval fortress, built on an isolate hill (case 3); sensor installed on the foundations of a school, built on alluvial deposits (case 4). Since recent works proposed the use of spectral ratio techniques to study the dynamic characterization of buildings, ambient seismic-noise measurements were performed for each site close to the stations (at the base of the structures), at the top of the structures and outside the buildings. In order to check the source of vibrations both horizontal to vertical spectral ratio (HVNR) and standard spectral ratio (SSR) techniques were applied. For all stations the results from ambient seismic noise were compared to those obtained from earthquakes (HVSR). In order to detect preferential directions of amplification, for each site average HVNRs and HVSRs were computed considering one <b>azimuth</b> for each <b>set</b> of 5 °. We obtain different results for different types of installation: in cases 1 and 2, where the sensors are directly installed on rock, the vibrations of the structure do not affect the noise measures performed close to the stations, which show flat HVNR in the whole frequency range: in both cases the eigenfrequency of the building is given by the HVNR calculated from the measures performed at the top of the structure. In cases 3 and 4, where the sensors are installed on the foundations of the considered structures, both the amplification peaks between 5 and 9 Hz (case 3) and between 5. 5 and 7 Hz (case 4) include the contribution of the free oscillations of the buildings. In particular, in case 4, HVNRs performed outside building highlight possible soil–structure resonance effects in case of an earthquake...|$|R
30|$|The morphologies {{of these}} GaN-based nanorod LED samples were {{carefully}} studied by {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM, Nova Nano SEM 430). For TDPL measurements, samples were stuck on a copper stage cold finger in a helium closed circuit cryostat with vacuum silicone. The temperature was changed from 8 to 300  K. A 405 -nm laser was used for excitation. The excitation-power density was about 100  W/cm 2, where the carrier density in the active region was estimated as 2 [*]×[*] 1018 /cm 3. The luminescence signal was coupled into a grating spectrometer. Then the dispersed luminescence was detected by a photomultiplier tubes (PMT). To compare the PL intensities of different size nanorod LEDs, a integrating sphere was used to avoid the effect of spatial emission distribution, where the incident direction was perpendicular {{to the surface of}} the samples. The TRPL measurements were performed by LifeSpec-Red Picosecond Lifetime Spectrometer. A pulsed 372 -nm laser was used as excitation source with a pulse duration of 69  ps. The laser excitation-power density was approximately 100  W/cm 2 too. The radiation patterns of nanorod arrays were measured by ARPL. The samples were excited by a 405 -nm laser with a vertical incident direction. The samples and laser spot were fixed at the rotation center of a rotary stage. The luminescence from MQWs went through a small aperture diaphragm, and then was focused into a fiber optic spectrometer. The fiber optic spectrometer was set 15  cm away from the laser spots on samples. During the measurements, the incident direction of laser was fixed, and the probed direction was changed from − 90 ° to 90 °, which corresponded to the zenith angle of the far-field pattern. The <b>azimuth</b> angles were <b>set</b> as zero according to the reference edge of the samples. At last, the full 3 D-FDTD simulation was performed to illustrate the electric field distribution of a single nanorod and nanorod arrays. Perfect matched layer (PML) boundary condition was adopted. The simulation area of nanorod array was 5 [*]×[*] 5  μm 2. The detector layer for far field was placed above the upper surface 300  nm. The detector layer for near field was positioned 20  nm spacing from the c-axis of nanorod. It is generally thought that spacing less than λ/ 2 π is in the near field range. The far-field results were obtained by applying the Fourier transform (FT) to the near field results [27]. A single dipole source (λ[*]=[*] 400 ~ 470  nm) polarized in the in-plane direction was positioned at the center of MQWs layer, which was similar to the SpE in MQWs. The refractive indices of GaN layers, InGaN QWs layers and air were set to be 2.52, 2.58, and 1.0, respectively. The absorption coefficient of GaN and InGaN QWs were chosen to be 10 and 5000  cm− 1.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityThis {{report is}} {{primarily}} concerned with {{a detailed description of}} an automatic haze recorder. An introductory haze discussion is included to facilitate the overall evaluation of the program. Although there is a wealth of experimental data for ground-to-ground haze measurements. there exist only fragmentary data for the air-to-ground case. The data of Waldram, and Carman and Carruthers comprise the known extent of published aerial haze studies which are statistically based on a series of programmed flight-test measurements. Even in these cases the number of flights was small. It is therefore essential to the formation of a statistical model of the atmosphere that extensive flight measurements be made over various conditions and up to altitudes of 40000 ft. The automatic haze recorder consists basically of an airborne telephotometer and its associated equipment: the telephotometer itself, an indexing mount~ a recording assembly, and a control assembly and starting box. Each of these items is described in detail. The base of the telephotometer consists of a device which rotates a right prism about an axis normal and concentric to one of its faces. The telephotometer is mounted on the floor of an aircraft in such a manner that this prism assembly extends below the bottom skin of the aircraft, and that the axis of the prism rotation is maintained parallel {{to the surface of the}} earth. The upwelling light from a 15 ° cone entering the prism is reflected along its axis of rotation and, by means of a fixed right prism into the photometric system. In this manner the rotating prism scans a path 15 ° wide, which stretches beneath the aircraft from horizon to horizon. In the photometric system the upwelling light is projected through an appropriate filter onto a photomultiplier tube. The output of this tube is read directly as the vertical deflection of an oscilloscope which is mounted in the recording assembly. The horizontal deflection of this scope is made proportional to the scanning angle by a gear-driven potentiometer. In this manner the scope makes a trace of upwelling intensity vs angle for a given set of conditions. Each scope trace, together with other pertinent data, is photographed by the recording assembly. The indexing mount rotates the telephotometer, and thus the scanning plane, about the vertical axis. The control assembly, once started, automatically cycles the overall system in the following manner. A blue record, then a green record, then a red record are separately photographed at the indexing mount <b>setting</b> (<b>azimuth)</b> of 0 °. Then the mount turns the instrument to an azimuth of 45 ° and the above three records are made again. This sequence is repeated at settings of 90 °, 135 °, 180 °, 135 °, 90 °, and 45 °. The head is then returned to 0 °, and the assembly is again ready for another cycle. The lapsed time of the complete cycle is somewhat less than 1 / 3 of a minute. The instrument has been constructed and successfully laboratory-tested. It has had only a single, preliminary flight test, but on this the performance equaled or exceeded the design expectations. Proposals for future flight-test programs are discussed...|$|R
