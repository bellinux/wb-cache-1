5|$|Cagney's seventh film, The Public Enemy, {{became one}} of the most {{influential}} gangster movies of the period. Notable for a famous scene in which Cagney pushes <b>a</b> <b>grapefruit</b> against Mae Clarke's face, the film thrust him into the spotlight. He {{became one of}} Hollywood's biggest stars and one of Warner Bros.' biggest contracts. In 1938, he received his first Academy Award for Best Actor nomination, for Angels with Dirty Faces, for his subtle portrayal of the tough guy/man-child Rocky Sullivan. In 1942, Cagney won the Oscar for his energetic portrayal of George M. Cohan in Yankee Doodle Dandy. He was nominated a third time in 1955 for Love Me or Leave Me. Cagney retired from acting and dancing in 1961 to spend time on his farm with his family. He came out of retirement 20 years later for a part in the movie Ragtime (1981), mainly to aid his recovery from a stroke.|$|E

Pelé led Bauru Athletic Club juniors (coached by Waldemar de Brito) to two São Paulo state youth championships. In his mid-teens, he played for an indoor football team called Radium. Indoor football had just become popular in Bauru when Pelé began playing it. He was part of the first Futebol de Salão (indoor football) competition in the region.

25|$|To give an example, two chess players {{might be}} engaged in a bitter {{struggle}} at the board, but they share all sorts of Background presuppositions: that they will take turns to move, {{that no one else}} will intervene, that they are both playing to the same rules, that the fire alarm won't go off, that the board won't suddenly disintegrate, that their opponent won't magically turn into <b>a</b> <b>grapefruit,</b> and so on indefinitely. As most of these possibilities won't have occurred to either player, Searle thinks the Background must be unconscious, though elements of it can be called to consciousness (if the fire alarm does go off, say).|$|E

500|$|Many critics {{view the}} scene in which Cagney pushes <b>a</b> <b>grapefruit</b> into Mae Clarke's face {{as one of the}} most famous moments in movie history. The scene itself was a late addition, and who thought of the idea is a matter of debate. Producer Darryl Zanuck claimed he thought of it in a script conference, {{director}} William Wellman claimed that the idea came to him when he saw the grapefruit on the table during the shoot, and writers Glasmon and Bright claimed it was based on the real life of gangster Hymie Weiss, who threw an omelette into his girlfriend's face. Cagney himself usually cited the writers' version, but the fruit's victim, Clarke, agreed that it was Wellman's idea, saying, [...] "I'm sorry I ever agreed to do the grapefruit bit. I never dreamed it would be shown in the movie. Director Bill Wellman thought of the idea suddenly. It wasn't even written into the script.".|$|E
500|$|William Wellman's The Public Enemy (1931), {{released}} by Warner Brothers, features another career-defining performance, this time James Cagney as Tom Powers. The film {{is similar to}} the template set in Little Caesar in that it follows Powers from his rise to his eventual fall in the world of crime. The film was partially based on the real life of Chicago gangster Dion O'Banion. Cagney's character is contrasted with his puritanical brother who wants him to go straight; their mother {{is at the center of}} the conflict. Tom Powers is egotistical, amoral, heartless, ruthless, and extremely violent. The best-remembered scene in the picture is referred to as the [...] "grapefruit scene": when Cagney's girlfriend (Mae Clarke) angers him during breakfast, he shoves half <b>a</b> <b>grapefruit</b> in her face. Instead of scenes from the film, its trailer contained a voiceover warning of the picture's intensity and showed a gun being fired directly at the camera.|$|E
500|$|William Wellman's The Public Enemy (1931) was {{released}} by Warner Brothers the following year and features another career defining performance, this time by James Cagney. It was adapted from the unpublished novelette Beer and Blood written by John Bright, and adapted for the screen by Kubec Glasmon and Bright. Enemy takes place from 1909 until 1920. The film {{is similar to the}} template set in Caesar in that it follows Tom Powers (Cagney) from his rise to his eventual fall in the world of crime. Cagney's character contrasts his puritanical brother who wants him to go straight and their mother, who {{is at the center of}} the conflict between her two sons. Tom Powers is egotistical, amoral, heartless, and extremely violent. The most famous scene in the picture is referred to as the [...] "grapefruit scene"; when Cagney is eating breakfast, his girlfriend angers him, so he cruelly shoves half of <b>a</b> <b>grapefruit</b> in her face. The scene became so famous that for the rest of his life when Cagney dined at a restaurant, other patrons would send his table <b>a</b> <b>grapefruit.</b> Cagney was even more violent towards women in his 1933 gangster film Picture Snatcher, where he knocks out an amorous woman he is not interested in and violently throws her into the back seat of his car. Enemy was based in part on the Irish gangster Dean O'Banion, and a scene in which Cagney kills a horse that caused the death of a friend was inspired by a similar real life event where O'Banion underling Louis [...] "Two Guns" [...] Alterie and others shot a horse. The film's trailer featured no scenes from the movie; it merely contained a warning of the picture's intensity and showcased a gun being fired at the camera. Zanuck also produced Enemy, and was heavily involved in the film's production. He aimed for a movie where the characters were not just immoral, but free of morals, and devoid of conscience. When he showed the film to MGM's Irving Thalberg, Thalberg remarked [...] "that's not a motion picture. It's beyond a motion picture." [...] While Wingate conceded that the film [...] "was a story that needed to be told", other states were less convinced. Maryland and Ohio cut the grapefruit scene. All states cut a scene where Powers sleeps with a gang den mother while drunk, then slaps her when he wakes up and realizes she took advantage of him.|$|E
