5|$|Before 1928 {{the only}} flag that had {{official}} {{status in the}} Union of South Africa was the United Kingdom's Union Jack as South Africa {{was part of the}} British Empire. The South Africa Red Ensign was used as an unofficial flag. In 1925, discussion rose <b>about</b> <b>creating</b> <b>a</b> new flag for South Africa as many descendants of Boers found the Union Jack unacceptable after the Boer War. In 1926 the Balfour Declaration granted South Africa legislative autonomy, opening the possibility of a new flag. British settlers wanted the Union Jack in the new flag as part of the British Empire while the Afrikaners did not. A compromise was reached whereby the new flag would consist of the Prince's Flag as this was the first flag raised on South Africa and a badge of the Union Jack in the centre with the flags of the Orange Free State and the South African Republic. The Union Jack was mirrored in the new flag with the hoist on the right so that it did not take precedence over the others.|$|E

Most of the filming for Halloween III took place on location in the small coastal town of Loleta in Humboldt County, California.

Integrated circuits, the current method of creating computer chips, will fade from the limelight, while some new more advanced technology will pick up the slack. It is this new technology that will get us to the massive levels of computation needed to create an artificial brain.|$|E
25|$|Beginning with Life on Earth in 1979, Attenborough set <b>about</b> <b>creating</b> <b>a</b> body of {{work which}} became a {{benchmark}} of quality in wildlife film-making and influenced a generation of documentary film-makers. The series also established many {{of the hallmarks of}} the BBC's natural history output. By treating his subject seriously and researching the latest discoveries, Attenborough and his production team gained the trust of scientists, who responded by allowing him to feature their subjects in his programmes. In Rwanda, for example, Attenborough and his crew were granted privileged access to film Dian Fossey's research group of mountain gorillas. Innovation was another factor in Life on Earths success: new film-making techniques were devised to get the shots Attenborough wanted, with a focus on events and animals that were hitherto unfilmed. Computerised airline schedules, which had only recently been introduced, enabled the series to be elaborately devised so that Attenborough visited several locations around the globe in each episode, sometimes even changing continents mid-sentence. Although appearing as the on-screen presenter, he consciously restricted his time on camera to give his subjects top billing.|$|E

Giger and Jean Giraud for set and character design, Dan O'Bannon and Douglas Trumbull for special effects, and Salvador Dalí, Orson Welles, Gloria Swanson, David Carradine, and others for the cast. He began writing a vast script, so important that the movie was thought to potentially last 14 hours. The project, nevertheless, was nipped in the bud for financial reasons, leaving Jodorowsky's unfinished handwritten script in a notebook that was partially published as a facsimile in 2012 as part of the 100 Notes – 100 Thoughts catalog of the 13th documenta exhibition. Frank Pavich directed a documentary about this unrealized project entitled Jodorowsky's Dune, which premiered at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival in May 2013, and was released theatrically in March 2014.|$|E

Entering his crypt, Mazzarin is initially uninterested in helping them.

In Llancarfan, the Smiths build Connacht a Tain; a small magical device containing a pocket universe of limitless capacity, capable of sweeping an infinite number of enemies inside it.
