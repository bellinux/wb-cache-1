2500|$|One element {{which is}} crucial {{to the success of the}} GRR model is the notion related to 'instructional scaffolding', which is {{grounded}} in Vygotsky's concept of the [...] "zone of proximal development" [...] (ZPD). [...] This is described as the distance between the actual developmental level of a learner as determined by their independent problem solving abilities and the level of potential development through problem-solving under <b>adult</b> <b>guidance</b> or in collaboration with more capable peers. That is, the distance between what the children can do without assistance and what they can accomplish with the assistance of more capable peers. The zone of proximal development can be applied as an umbrella over the entire GRR model. Students are given support in the form of scaffolding and differentiate instruction throughout all four phases of the process. Teachers may offer more challenging material to high-achieving students, and assist lower-achieving students in needs-based groups. Teachers will support students as needed throughout all four steps finally allowing for the eventual independence of each student. The GRR model [...] "...assumes that [...] will need some guidance in reaching that stage of independence and that it is precisely the teacher's role to provide such guidance".|$|E

40|$|In {{the face}} of {{demographic}} ageing European healthcare providers and policy makers are recognising an increasing prevalence of frail, community-dwelling older adults, prone to adverse healthcare outcomes. Prefrailty, before onset of functional decline, is suggested to be reversible but interventions targeting this risk syndrome are limited. No consensus on the definition, diagnosis or management of pre-frailty exists. The PERsonalised ICT Supported Service for Independent Living and Active Ageing (PERSSILAA) project (2013 - 2016 under Framework Programme 7, grant # 610359) developed a comprehensive Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) supported platform to screen, assess, manage and monitor pre-frail community-dwelling older adults {{in order to address}} pre-frailty and promote active and healthy ageing. PERSSILAA, a multi-domain ICT service, targets three pre-frailty: nutrition, cognition and physical function. The project produced 42 recommendations across clinical (screening, monitoring and managing of pre-frail older adults) technical (ICT-based innovations) and societal (health literacy in older <b>adults,</b> <b>guidance</b> to healthcare professional, patients, caregivers and policy makers) areas. This paper describes the 25 healthcare related recommendations of PERSSILAA, exploring how they could be used in the development of future European guidelines on the screening and prevention of frailty...|$|R

Formally {{established}} in 1922, over the decades Woodcraft Rangers has modified Seton’s original emphasis on outdoor life to incorporate activities that {{meet the needs of}} an increasingly urban population, but the goal of changing behavior and encouraging positive outcomes through interaction and education remains central to its mission today. Currently, Woodcraft Rangers reaches out to over 18,000 at-risk children and youth annually through enriching after-school and camping programs. The organization’s programs are responsive to social trends and designed to help children mature into healthy, productive adults through positive experiences and age-appropriate challenges. By providing structured activities, a safe environment, and <b>adult</b> <b>guidance</b> after school, Woodcraft Rangers offers a positive alternative to the boredom and negative peer pressures that can lead to juvenile delinquency. As it has since Seton's time, the group’s American Camp Association-accredited summer camp programs at Blue Sky Meadow focus on outdoor living skills and nature activities. Campers are encouraged to explore and test their strengths and build character in a safe and supportive environment. After participating in nature hikes, archery, scavenger hunts, map & compass adventures, arts & crafts, survival skills games and star-gazing, campers return home with {{a better understanding of the}} outdoor world and greater confidence in their abilities.
