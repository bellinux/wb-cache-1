40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to investigate the right of the South African Government to tax the income earned by a foreign company when rendering services in South Africa to a South African <b>associated</b> <b>enterprise</b> on a recurrent basis, together with the right to tax the amounts paid to the employees of the permanent establishment for services rendered in South Africa. At the same time the research investigated whether the services rendered by a foreign company to an <b>associated</b> <b>enterprise</b> in South Africa on a recurrent basis would constitute a permanent establishment, as this is essential before South Africa may tax either the foreign company or the employees of the permanent establishment (where such employees are not resident in South Africa). The research was conducted by means of a critical analysis of documentary data and data from a limited number of interviews with academics and the authors of textbooks and articles. In order to limit the scope of the research, a number of assumptions were made. Conflicting viewpoints underlying certain of these assumptions were discussed. Some of the important conclusions reached are that the provisions of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties should be taken into account when interpreting South African legislation (including Double Tax Agreements), and that the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Commentary may be relied upon when interpreting OECD based Double Tax Agreements in South Africa. No conclusion was reached on whether to apply an ambulatory or a static basis of interpreting the OECD Commentary, however. The final conclusion of the research is that the services rendered in South Africa on a recurrent basis would be geographically and commercially coherent and consequently meet the "location test'. It is clear that as the services are rendered regularly and recurrently, they would be regarded as having the necessary permanence and would meet the 'duration test'. The place of business would therefore be regarded as being fixed (having the necessary degree of permanence). As the services would be rendered at the place of business of the South African entity, they would be regarded as being rendered 'through' the place of business and the foreign entity would be regarded as having a permanent establishment in South Africa (as defined in Article 5 (1) of the OECD Model Tax Convention}. The South African Government would therefore be entitled to tax the income attributable to the permanent establishment and the income earned by the non resident employees, who rendered services in South Africa for the permanent establishment. Once the entitlement to tax exists, South African legislative rules determine how South Africa proceeds to tax the income...|$|E
40|$|Today’s {{need for}} more complex, more capable systems in a short {{timeframe}} is leading more organizations towards the integration of existing systems, Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) products, and new systems into network-centric, knowledge-based Systems of Systems (SoSs). With this development approach, system development processes to define the new architecture, identify sources to either supply or develop the required components, and eventually integrate and test these high level components are evolving and are being referred to as SoS Engineering (SoSE). Recent reports indicate that SoSE activities are considerably different from the more traditional systems engineering (SE) activities and various researchers are working to describe these differences in SoSE process models.

40|$|Transfer {{pricing and}} customs {{valuation}} rules, are both ultimately aimed at ensuring a transaction with an <b>associated</b> <b>enterprise</b> or related party is conducted at arm?s length. The {{literature on the}} intersection of these rules has identified, on the one hand, the potential for double taxation and, on the other hand, exploitation {{of the differences in}} these regimes by taxpayers. After identifying the obstacles to harmonisation of customs valuation and transfer pricing rules and the opportunities for applying these rules in a harmonised way (in order to manage the risks associate with these rules), this mini-dissertation critically analyses the South African income tax and customs legislation and evaluates it by way of a case study based on the author?s recent experience. This analysis and case study illustrates that in general transfer pricing documentation cannot be used to show that the transaction value of the imported goods is arm?s length and that the prospects for harmonisation of transfer pricing and customs valuation rules in South Africa are poor. The means of managing the transfer pricing and customs valuation risks identified in the existing literature and the case study are further analysed to identify whether they are feasible in South Africa. It is established that importers should incorporate information relevant to customs authorities in their transfer pricing documentation and use provisional declarations where future transfer pricing adjustments are expected. The importer should also evaluate its transfer prices continually in order to avoid year-end transfer pricing adjustments. Mini Dissertation (LLM) [...] University of Pretoria, 2017.

40|$|It {{has been}} argued that {{ecosystem}} services can be used as the foundation to provide economic opportunities to empower the disadvantaged. The Ecosystem Services Framework (ESF) approach for poverty alleviation, which balances resource conservation and human resource use, has received much attention in the literature. However, few projects have successfully achieved both conservation and economic objectives. This is partly due to there being a hiatus between theory and practice, due to the absence of tools that help make the transition between conceptual frameworks and theory, to practical integration of ecosystem services into decision making. To address this hiatus, an existing conceptual framework for analyzing the robustness of social-ecological systems was translated into a practical toolkit to help understand the complexity of social-ecological systems (SES). The toolkit can be used by a diversity of stakeholders as a decision making aid for assessing ecosystem services supply and demand and <b>associated</b> <b>enterprise</b> opportunities. The toolkit is participatory and combines both a generic "top-down" scientific approach with a case-specific "bottom-up" approach. It promotes a shared understanding of the utilization of ecosystem services, which is the foundation of identifying resilient enterprises. The toolkit comprises four steps: (i) ecosystem services supply and demand assessment; (ii) roles identification; (iii) enterprise opportunity identification; and (vi) enterprise risk assessment, and was tested at two estuary study sites. Implementation of the toolkit requires the populating of preprogrammed Excel worksheets through the holding of workshops that are attended by stakeholders associated with the ecosystems. It was concluded that for an enterprise to be resilient, it must be resilient at an external SES level,which the toolkit addresses, and at an internal business functioning level, e. g., social dynamics among personnel, skills, and literacy levels. Although the toolkit does not address the internal resilience level of an enterprise, it proved helpful at indicating which enterprises show potential resilience given current SES conditions...|$|E
40|$|Ranching is a {{challenging}} and sometimes risky business, with cattle production (and <b>associated</b> <b>enterprise</b> income) largely being dependent on seasonal weather patterns and corresponding forage production. To help reduce this risk, the USDA–Agricultural Research Service performed a multistate study of seasonal weather effects on cattle production across the Northern Great Plains (Wyoming, North Dakota, and Montana). Cool, wet springs and longer, cooler growing seasons increased cattle production across the Northern Great Plains. Knowledge of these seasonal weather influences on cattle production {{is important for}} management decision making, but practical application of this knowledge remains problematic. Increased enterprise flexibility to deal with variable forage production {{can be achieved by}} using seasonal weather forecasts, as well as reducing base cow-calf herd numbers to less than 100 % of typical ranch carrying capacity. Yearlings or seasonal contract grazing can then be used to increase grazing to use additional forage in good years. Recently launched USDA Regional Climate Hubs will deliver science-based knowledge, practical information, management and conservation strategies, and decision tools to ranchers that will help them adapt to weather variability and changing climatic conditions.

40|$|Transfer pricing {{continues}} to be, and will remain, {{the most important}} international tax issue facing MNEs. ' The term 'transfer pricing' is used to describe arrangements involving the transfer of goods or services, at an artificial price, in order to transfer income or expenses from one enterprise to an <b>associated</b> <b>enterprise</b> in a different tax jurisdiction. This results in the income derived at for each enterprise being disproportionate to their relative economic contributions, and thus impacting the relevant tax jurisdictions' fair share of tax. Tax authorities are therefore focusing their attention on transfer pricing rules and practices to ensure the correct attribution of income and expenses of related-party transactions. Another key issue, closely related to transfer pricing, is that of double taxation. Multinational enterprises, engaging in cross-border transactions, {{are at risk of}} having a single source of income taxed in two jurisdictions {{as a result of an}} incorrect application of transfer pricing rules. The purpose of this research is to evaluate South Africa's approach to transfer pricing, as well as compare it to the approaches as adopted by selected countries, namely Australia, the United Kingdom and Canada, with the aim of identifying the areas that South Africa could learn from practices in foreign jurisdictions. Specific issues dealt with include acceptable transfer pricing methods for determining an arm's length price, documentation requirements and non-compliance penalties, the use of Advance Pricing Agreements ("APA"), and the effects of e-commerce in applying the arm's length principle. The first issue relates to the criteria for the selection of the most suitable method in ensuring an arm's length outcome. Because the South African market is considered to be lacking in comparables, compliance with the arm's length principle will be determined by evaluation of the facts and circumstances of each case. The second issue looks at the transfer pricing policy documentation required to be prepared, the benefits of preparing such documentation, and the imposition of penalties on taxpayers failing to do so. The lack of statutory documentation requirements and specific penalty provisions in the South African legislation is also addressed. The third issue evaluates the use of APAs in resolving transfer pricing disputes. This technique is adopted by Australia, the United Kingdom and Canada, and therefore an assessment is made, taking into account both advantages and disadvantages of the technique, to determine whether it would be beneficial to South Africa to be able to agree in advance to transfer pricing methods to be applied to transactions with connected parties, thus reducing the potential for expensive and time consuming disputes with the South African Revenue Service ("SARS"). The fourth and final issue explores the challenges facing tax jurisdictions as a result of an increase in electronic trade. The relevance of the arm's length principle is assessed and recommendations for South Africa are made...|$|E

40|$|Enterprises when {{transacting}} {{with each}} other, are not {{subjected to the}} same market forces as independent enterprises. From a Swedish perspective the applicable rule to transactions between <b>associated</b> <b>enterprises</b> is chap. 14 para. 19. Both the Swedish arm’s length rule and its international equivalence are abstract rules of law as they merely provides the legal ramification if <b>associated</b> <b>enterprises</b> interact {{in a manner that}} independent enterprises would not. The international equivalence to the Swedish arm’s length rule is not a separate rule of law per se it is the gateway by which the Swedish rule is made applicable in international situations, {{through the use of a}} double tax agreement, with the fundamental principle that a double tax agreement can only limit, never expand a countries right to tax. The OECD Guidelines governing the general aspects of transfer pricing states that the fundamental meaning of the Guidelines is to find ways of establishing a price used between <b>associated</b> <b>enterprises</b> that are similar to what independent enterprise would conclude. The first step towards finding such a price is though the comparability analyses were all the relevant characteristics of the transferred goods is analysed. The chapter in the Guidelines that governs business restructurings is meant to be applied alongside the general aspects of transfer pricing. The Guidelines proposed way of finding an appropriate price for the transaction of a branch of production with respect to profit potential is with special consideration to risks. The profit potential is irrevocably linked with the risks transferred since it is a presumption that with increased risk there is a potential for higher profits. Although the risks are the most important aspect there are other things to look at such as other options realistically available and benefits from concluding a business restructuring. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "For decades, the Department of Defense (DOD) has not been successful in repeated attempts to modernize its timeworn business systems and operations. In 1995, we first designated DOD's business systems modernization as "high risk," {{and we continue to}} designate it as such today. As our research on successful public and private sector organizations has shown, attempting a large-scale systems modernization program in a large organization such as DOD without, among other things, a well-defined enterprise architecture and the associated investment management controls for implementing it often results in systems that are duplicative, stovepiped, non-integrated, and unnecessarily costly to manage, maintain, and operate. In May 2001, we made recommendations to the Secretary of Defense that provided the means for effectively developing and implementing an enterprise architecture and limiting systems investments until the department had a well-defined architecture and a corporate approach to investment control and decision making. In July 2001, the department initiated a business management modernization program to, among other things, develop a business enterprise architecture and establish the investment controls needed to effectively implement it. This effort was begun as part of the Secretary of Defense's broad initiative to "transform the way the department works and what it works on. " Between 2001 and 2005, we reported that the department's business management modernization program was not being effectively managed, concluding in 2005 that {{hundreds of millions of dollars}} had been spent on an architecture and investment management structures that had limited use. To assist DOD in addressing these modernization management challenges, Congress included provisions in the Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005 (the Act) that were consistent with our recommendations for developing a business enterprise architecture and <b>associated</b> <b>enterprise</b> transition plan, and establishing and implementing effective information technology (IT) business system investment management structures and processes. More specifically, the Act required the department to, among other things, (1) develop a business enterprise architecture, (2) develop a transition plan to implement the architecture, (3) include systems information in its annual budget submission, (4) establish a system investment approval and accountability structure, (5) establish an investment review process, and (6) approve and certify system modernizations costing in excess of $ 1 million. The Act further requires that the Secretary of Defense submit an annual report to congressional defense committees on its compliance with certain requirements of the Act not later than March 15 of each year from 2005 through 2009. Additionally, the Act directs us to submit to congressional defense committees [...] within 60 days of DOD's report submission [...] an assessment of DOD's actions taken to comply with these requirements. The objectives of our review were to (1) assess the actions by DOD to comply with the requirements of Section 2222 of Title 10, U. S. Code and (2) determine the extent to which DOD has addressed our prior recommendations. To accomplish this, we used our November 2005 report as a baseline of comparison, focusing on the steps the department has taken to address the areas of noncompliance that we cited in that report. ...|$|E
40|$|Topic: The {{study is}} linked to the concept of a group of companies. A group {{is at the same time}} a legal and {{economical}} phenomenon. An international group of companies consists of companies and permanent establishments located in different states. The study covers not only subsidiaries to be consolidated to the group financial statement, but also associated enterprises where the group’s ownership can be below 50 % and which will not, therefore, be consolidated. Such associated enterprises which do not belong to the group under accounting and company laws can have a firm connection to the group. Regarding taxation, attention will be paid to the conditions and terms concluded inside the group. Adjustments can also become a factor in relation associated enterprises which are not consolidated if the conditions and terms concluded deviate from what would have been agreed on at the open market. The main goal of the thesis is to find out how international regulation created within the OECD and EU harmonises the taxation of interest payments between associated enterprises. The study consists of the levels of tax treaty law, European Community law and domestic tax law. From these three levels, the focus is on European Community law or in a wider context on the European Union. The main research methods are legal dogmatic and comparative law. The comparative part of the study focuses on the tax systems of the United States of America, Germany, Estonia and Finland. The macro level comparison covers not only domestic international laws, tax treaties, case law and other official documents, but also customary methods of interpretation, ways of transposing international agreements into the national legal order and carrying out international law obligations in the respective countries. These countries have been chosen from the Finnish point-of-view. The United States was a significant capital exporting country before the current economical recession. The U. S. tax treaty policy and domestic international tax laws have had a great impact on other countries’ tax systems. Economically, Germany is the most powerful country in the EU. Relatively speaking, most of the preliminary references referred to the European Court of Justice dealing with direct income tax law are made by German courts. Estonia is interesting from the Finnish perspective due to geographical reasons and tax competition. The study also covers the Swedish tax system quite deeply. Sweden was not included in the macro level comparison because group taxation systems are similar in Finland and Sweden. The two countries also joined the EU at the same time. Micro level comparison, which examines specific legal institutions, was carried out with Belgium, Denmark, France, India, Mexico and the Netherlands as examples. Structure The study has ten chapters. Chapter 1 describes the goals, methodology, limitations and sources of the thesis. Chapter 2 presents principles and goals which affect interpretation of tax law. The principles of legality and equality may be legally enforced, whereas ability to pay, neutrality and fairness are goals for the improvement of the society’s social feature. Chapter 2 first discusses the sources of international taxation from international law and treaties before and moving on to international tax law and its interpretation. European tax law is studied from a critical perspective. The impact of acquis communautaire on national tax systems has been compared to a jack-in-the-box which lowers the predictability of tax assessment. Chapter 3 deals with the history of direct tax harmonisation and the current possibilities to cross-border loss-relief. The European Commission’s initiatives for group taxation - Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base and Home State Taxation - are discussed. Thin capitalisation and transfer pricing problems would be eliminated if these initiatives were adopted. Companies taking part into unitary taxation would be fiscally consolidated at a group level. Corporate tax harmonisation could go further than this in theory. An EU tax would eliminate the current constitutional problems. The EU tax would create a direct tax link between the EU and its citizens. The EU’s political accountability would be improved if the European Parliament’s involvement in the adoption of tax laws was increased. Chapter 4 presents group financing from a taxation point-of-view. Debt financing may provide tax benefits in cross-border situations. Interest payments are usually deductible expenses, whereas dividend paid to a foreign parent company may usually not be deducted out of company profits. The differential tax treatment of debt and equity may imply tax-planning opportunities for group financing. Groups of companies may strive to allocate group financing companies into low-tax jurisdictions where the general tax rate is low, and extend intercompany loans into high-tax jurisdictions where the benefit of a tax deduction is high. Equity investments also provide tax-planning opportunities. The international tax treaty network and the Parent-Subsidiary Directive eliminate taxation at source from intra-group dividends as well. Chapter 5 examines the concept of an <b>associated</b> <b>enterprise.</b> The concept of an <b>associated</b> <b>enterprise</b> is defined differently in the OECD Model Tax Convention and the Interest and Royalties Directive. International accounting standards and domestic accounting and tax laws also define the concept using their own criteria. A company belonging to a group of companies may, in practice, be an associated company under accounting laws but fall outside the scope of the Interest and Royalties Directive. Chapters 6 - 9 deal with the concept of interest, taxation principles, interest deductions and transfer pricing issues dealing with interest and financing. Interest is commonly considered to be return on debt capital. The concept of interest has not been defined in the Finnish Income Tax Act or Business Income Tax Act. The Act on Taxation of Income of a Person Subject to Limited Tax Liability contains a definition of interest which is applied between associated companies located in different EU member states. Interest, according to the Act, means any income from debt-claims whether or not secured by mortgage and whether or not carrying a right to participate in the debtor’s profits. The legal concept of interest is generally equal to the economic concept of interest. Return on zero-coupon bonds and perpetual loans are considered to be interest. The amount of interest is determined by percentage of interest, time and debt. Debt is characterized by the debtor-creditor relationship and the absence of participation rights. Finnish tax law does not explicitly rule how to draw a line between debt and equity. The classification of hybrid instruments under civil law is generally a starting-point. The classification is also based on case law. The economic substance of an instrument can be considered. There are no published cases where hybrid equity would have been reclassified as debt for tax purposes. Debt has been reclassified as equity only in a few cases. According to the Commentary to the OECD Model Tax Convention, interest generally means remuneration on money lent, being remuneration coming within the category of “income form movable capital”. Article 11 OECD states that interest means income from debt-claims of every kind, whether or not secured by mortgage and whether or not carrying a right to participate in the debtor’s profits and income from government securities and income from bonds or debentures, in particular. There is an interconnection between interest and dividends in the Articles of the OECD Model Tax Convention. Interest on participating bonds should normally not be considered as a dividend; also, interest on convertible bonds should not be considered as a dividend before the bonds are actually converted as shares. It may be difficult to make a distinction between interest and dividend in situations of thin capitalisation. If the repayment of loan largely depends on the success of an enterprise, interest paid on such loans may be taxed as a dividend. The Contracting States may widen Article 11 OECD as to include any income which is taxed as interest under their domestic laws. The OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines require that the arm’s principle shall be followed in group financing. The arm’s length principle requires that associated enterprises shall apply market based interest rate and other financing terms to their internal debts and receivables. The OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines do not, however, indicate how an arm’s length interest rate should be determined. The comparable uncontrolled price method is usually the preferred method for determining an arm’s length interest rate. It can be challenging to find loan agreements which would be sufficiently close comparables as to type, quality and quantity with an intercompany loan. The cost plus method has also been suggested as a suitable method for evaluating a current interest rate. With regard to comparables, an internal uncontrolled comparable would be preferred. External comparables will nevertheless be used in many cases. Group interest rates can be compared with market interest rates or a simulated credit rating can be carried out. Chapter 10 concludes the thesis and discusses future scenarios on interest deductions in Finland. Finland does not have statutory thin capitalisation rules. The Finnish approach is liberal toward thin capitalisation. The tax authorities evaluate a company’s financing structure as a whole. Attention will be paid to the company’s debt to equity ratio and whether interest is paid in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement. Debt push-down structures have been widely used. Highly-leveraged financing structures have been subject to tax audits. It is fairly common to declare that debt to equity ratio 15 : 1 is accepted in Finland. This debt to equity ratio was accepted by the Supreme Administrative Court in KHO 1999 : 19. A clear rule should not be drawn only from one judgment. Published case-law of the Supreme Administrative Court dealing with thin capitalisation is limited. Many of the cases have been decided on the basis of a double taxation treaty. A qualified non-discrimination article following Article 24 (4) of OECD Model Tax Convention has prevented a denial of deductibility of interest. The EC Treaty Freedoms also require equal treatment of domestic and cross-border situations. Landmark cases dealing with thin capitalisation are cases C- 324 / 00 Lankhorst-Hohorst, C- 524 / 04 Thin Cap Group Litigation and C- 105 / 07 N. V. Lammers. The ECJ has found that the discriminatory application of thin capitalisation provisions involving a fixed debt to equity ratio constitutes a disproportionate restriction of the freedom of establishment. Domestic anti-abuse measures which categorically prevent taxpayers from exercising their right to free movement are not allowed unless domestic legislation has a “specific purpose of preventing wholly artificial arrangements”. Interest deductions in Finland de lege ferenda The Finnish Ministry of Finance published a study in April 2009 dealing with interest deductions in corporate income taxation. The study covers the current legal status in Finland, development in various European countries and the impact of European Community law and double taxation treaties on interest deductions. The aim is to discover whether deductibility of interest payments should be limited in Finland and, if so, what kind of measures should be taken. Organisations representing Finnish industry and Trade, the Tax Administration, the Finnish Bank and tax law professors were requested to answer whether limitations on interest deductions should be introduced in Finland and, if so, what the limitations should be. The deadline was in June 2009. Due to the economic recession, it is likely that restrictions on interest deductions, if they are considered necessary, will not be introduced in the near future. The Finnish corporate tax system should be reviewed as a whole before deciding whether limitations on interest deductions should be introduced. The liberal approach toward interest deductions and thin capitalisation provide companies with a competitive advantage. If the companies’ right to make interest deductions is limited, it should also be considered whether the general corporate tax rate of 26 % should be lowered. The future of the Finnish group contribution system, where a profit-making group company may transfer taxable profit to a loss-making group company, should be reviewed in the same context. The Ministry of Finance has already indicated that Finland may transfer to a fiscal consolidation system. Taking into account the current economic situation, there is a risk that tighter interest deduction rules may create unnecessary obstacles for corporate financing. On the other hand, the protection of the Finnish corporate tax base may call for limitations on interest deductions. Statutory interest deduction rules would provide legal certainty for both the taxpayer and the tax administration. The U. S. interest-stripping rules, the German Zinsschranke and Swedish limitations on related parties’ interest deductions serve as examples for possible limitations on interest deductions. In addition, the Belgian notional interest deduction and the Dutch initiatives on defiscalisation of interest income and deductions in group taxation and a mandatory interest-box should also be considered as well. Introducing a tax incentive would stimulate investments, whereas limitations on interest deductions would probably diminish Finland’s attractiveness from an investor point-of-view. Mitkä ovat kansainvälisten konsernien verosuunnittelumahdollisuudet sisäisissä siirroissa? Kansainvälisen konsernin verotuksen tasoon voidaan vaikuttaa valitsemalla sisäisiin siirtoihin lievästi verotettava tulotyyppi. Verosopimusten mukaiset korkotulon nollaverokannat voivat alentaa konsernin efektiivistä veroastetta. Verosuunnittelu voi johtaa tilanteeseen, jossa käytetyn tulotyypin muoto ei vastaa tulon taloudellista luonnetta. Sekamuotoisen hybridi-instrumentin tuotto saatetaan luonnehtia verotuksessa uudelleen koron sijasta osingoksi. Teoksessa perehdytään koron vähennysoikeuteen elinkeinoverotuksessa. Verosopimusoikeus ja eurooppaoikeus edellyttävät, että rajat ylittävien korkojen on pääsääntöisesti oltava samoin edellytyksin vähennyskelpoisia kuin kotimaisten korkojen. Kirjassa käsitellään myös rajanvetoa koron ja luovutusvoiton, liiketulon, muun tulon sekä rojaltin tulotyyppien välillä. Lähiyhtiön käsitettä tarkastellaan moniulotteisesti vero-oikeuden, kirjanpidon ja yhtiöoikeuden näkökulmasta. Viime vuosina useat valtiot ovat siirtyneet alikapitalisointisäännöksistä korkovähennysrajoituksiin. Kirja ottaa kantaa koron vähennysoikeuden rajoittamiseen Suomen elinkeinoverotuksessa. Etujärjestöt ja julkishallinto ovat antaneet valtiovarainministeriölle lausuntoja, joissa on sekä vastustettu että puollettu koron vähennysoikeuden rajoittamista. Lisäksi tarkastellaan markkinaehtoisen koron määrittämistä siirtohinnoittelussa. Denna avhandling gäller beskattning av interna räntebetalningar mellan närstående bolag belägna i olika stater. Avhandlingen är en rättsdogmatisk studie med komparativt inslag från USA, Tyskland, Estland och Finland. Även Sverige har behandlats relativt ingående. Andra länder har behandlats i anslutning till särskilda rättsfrågor. Rättsfall från cirka 10 länder har behandlats. Avhandlingen redogör för skillnaden mellan hard law och soft law. Flera metoder, såsom skattepolitik och planering, har tillämpats vid sidan av den rättsdogmatiska och komparativa metoden. Avhandlingen har lånat inslag från andra vetenskapsområden, som t. ex. bokföringen, IFRS, bolagsrätten, finansieringen, nationalekonomin och historia forskningen. Se Kristiina Äimä: Sisäiset korot lähiyhtiöiden kansainvälisessä verotuksessa. WSOY. Helsingfors 2009. Avhandlingen innehåller en engelsk resumé om 17 sidor. Temat behandlas ur ett internationellt skatterättsligt perspektiv. Begreppet närstående bolag är centralt för temat. Närstående bolag definieras på ett annorlunda sätt inom bokföring, bolagsrätt och skatterätt. Likaså är definitionerna av ränta olika i skatterätten och andra vetenskaper. Räntebegreppet undersöks ur skatteavtalsrättens, EG-skatterättens och nationella rättens perspektiv. Särskild vikt läggs vid avdragsrätten för räntebetalningar och fastställandet av en marknadsmässig ränta. Inom multinationella företagsgrupper förekommer det lån och förskott på betalningar på samma sätt som mellan oberoende bolag. Ett skuldförhållande kan utgöras av en kortfristig skuld, såsom kundfordring eller leverantörsskuld. Därtill kan kapital lånas ut långfristigt i kapitalplaceringssyfte. Likaså kan kapital lånas ut för att ställa arbetande kapital till ett närstående bolags förfogande. Beviljandet av ett närståendelån kan vara i strid med aktieägarnas likställighetsprincip. Detta har beaktats i bolagsrätten. I verksamhetsberättelsen till bokslutet skall separat uppges penninglån, säkerheter och ansvarsförbindelser till personer som står bolaget nära samt de huvudsakliga villkoren för dessa. Avhandlingen tangerar finansieringen av multinationella företagsgrupper ur beskattningens synvinkel. Det påstås allmänt att företagsfinansieringen påverkas av det faktum att investeringar som har finansierats med främmande kapital beskattas i de flesta stater lindigare än kapitalplaceringar. Enligt huvudregeln får en investerare göra avdrag för räntebetalningar medan utdelningar på kapitalplaceringar vanligtvis inte är avdragsgilla i beskattningen. De belgiska reglerna gällande fiktivt ränteavdrag på eget kapital avviker däremot från huvudregeln. OECD-medlemsländernas dubbelskattningsavtal och nationella lagstiftning befriar vanligtvis ränteinkomster från beskattning i betalarens källstat. Källskattefriheten leder till skatteeffektiva kapitalöverföringar inom multinationella företagsgrupper. Internationell skatteplanering drar nytta även av ränteavdragen. Skatteeffektiviteten kan vara icke önskvärd från en statsfiskal synpunkt. Inom EU finns det ytterligare reglering gällande interna räntebetalningar. Enligt EG:s ränte- och royaltydirektiv beskattas interna räntebetalningarna endast i mottagarens hemviststat. För övrigt har EG-domstolen tolkat EU:s grundfriheter i sin rättspraxis så att en medlemsstat skall bevilja avdragsrätten under samma förutsättningar i gränsöverskridande situationer som i inhemska situationer. En nationell bestämmelse som inskränker etableringsfriheten kan ändå vara motiverad när den särskilt avser fiktiva upplägg som iscensätts för att kringgå lagstiftningen. Kravet på lika skattebehandling har lett till att många medlemsstater har övergått från traditionell underkapitaliseringsreglering till ränteavdragsbegränsningar. De nya avdragsbegränsningarna kan vara bundna till en procentenhet av EBIT (eng. Earnings before Interest and Taxes) eller motsvarande siffra eller låntagarens nominella finansiering av affärsförmögenhet. Ett koncernbolag som hör till en europeisk företagsgrupp beskattas som om bolaget vore fristående. Detta förorsakar mångfaldig beskattning. Europeiska kommissionens initiativ att harmonisera koncernbeskattningen skulle eliminera förlustutjämnings-, underkapitaliserings- och interprissättningsproblemen inom europeiska företagsgrupper. Den senaste utvecklingen i Sverige har följts noggrant i Finland. Bland annat förekomsten av räntesnurror i företagsskatteplaneringen och Regeringsrättens dom i Industrivärlden-målet har diskuterats. Dessutom har de nya svenska ränteavdragsbegränsningarna som skall förhindra skatteplanering inom företagsgrupper väckt intresse. För tillfället utreder finansministeriet om avdragsrätten för räntebetalningar borde begränsas inom finsk näringsbeskattning. Ifall avdragsrätten begränsas används sannolikt de svenska begränsningarna som förebild för den finska nya regleringen. Avhandlingen behandlar fördelar och nackdelar som kunde uppkomma om begränsningar introducerades...|$|E
