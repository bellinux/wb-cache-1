5|$|EFS {{has mostly}} a repressive role of EFS on {{processes}} {{associated with the}} <b>activation</b> <b>of</b> mature T-cells, including IL-2 pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and IL-2-dependent clonal expansion of T cells. Upon T-cell receptor (TCR) stimulation, EFS dephosphorylation and release of the SRC family kinase FYN and phospholipase C-γ normally lead to self-limitation of the immune response. Consistent with this mechanism, EFS overexpression in T cell-derived cell lines decreased IL-2 concentration in supernatants in response to TCR stimulation, while T cells derived from mice lacking EFS gene showed increased IL-2 production. A dual role of EFS in mature T cells function has been proposed because both overexpression and siRNA knockdown of this protein in cell models resulted in decreased transcriptional <b>activation</b> <b>of</b> IL-2 dependent promoters following TCR stimulation.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the signaling pathways described above, hippocampal LTP may be altered {{by a variety of}} modulators. For example, the steroid hormone estradiol may enhance LTP by driving CREB phosphorylation and subsequent dendritic spine growth. Additionally, β-adrenergic receptor agonists such as norepinephrine may alter the protein synthesis-dependent late phase of LTP. Nitric oxide synthase activity may also result in the subsequent <b>activation</b> <b>of</b> guanylyl cyclase and PKG. Similarly, <b>activation</b> <b>of</b> dopamine receptors may enhance LTP through the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway.|$|E
5|$|In recent years, {{evidence}} has emerged showing that lipid signaling {{is a vital}} part of the cell signaling. Lipid signaling may occur via <b>activation</b> <b>of</b> G protein-coupled or nuclear receptors, and members of several different lipid categories have been identified as signaling molecules and cellular messengers. These include sphingosine-1-phosphate, a sphingolipid derived from ceramide that is a potent messenger molecule involved in regulating calcium mobilization, cell growth, and apoptosis; diacylglycerol (DAG) and the phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIPs), involved in calcium-mediated <b>activation</b> <b>of</b> protein kinase C; the prostaglandins, which are one type of fatty-acid derived eicosanoid involved in inflammation and immunity; the steroid hormones such as estrogen, testosterone and cortisol, which modulate a host of functions such as reproduction, metabolism and blood pressure; and the oxysterols such as 25-hydroxy-cholesterol that are liver X receptor agonists. Phosphatidylserine lipids are known to be involved in signaling for the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells or pieces of cells. They accomplish this by being exposed to the extracellular face of the cell membrane after the inactivation of flippases which place them exclusively on the cytosolic side and the <b>activation</b> <b>of</b> scramblases, which scramble the orientation of the phospholipids. After this occurs, other cells recognize the phosphatidylserines and phagocytosize the cells or cell fragments exposing them.|$|E

Inflammation can potentially reduce transmission of information between neurons in at least three ways. The soluble factors released might stop neurotransmission by intact neurons.

40|$|Several studies {{indicate}} that the cerebellum might {{play a role in}} experiencing and/or controlling emphatic emotions, but it remains to be determined whether there is a distinction between positive and negative emotions, and, if so, which specific parts of the cerebellum are involved in these types of emotions. Here, we visualized <b>activations</b> <b>of</b> the cerebellum and extracerebellar regions using high-field fMRI, while we asked participants to observe and imitate images with pictures of human faces expressing different emotional states or with moving geometric shapes as control. The state of the emotions could be positive (happiness and surprise), negative (anger and disgust), or neutral. The positive emotional faces only evoked mild <b>activations</b> <b>of</b> crus 2 in the cerebellum, whereas the negative emotional faces evoked prominent activations in lobules VI and VIIa in its hemispheres and lobules VIII and IX in the vermis. The cerebellar activations associated with negative emotions occurred concomitantly with <b>activations</b> <b>of</b> mirror neuron domains such as the insula and amygdala. These data suggest that the potential role of the cerebellum in control of emotions may be particularly relevant for goal-directed behavior that is required for observing and reacting to another person’s (negative) expressions...|$|R
