In the course of the militarisation pushed by Soviet authorities, direct and indirect military expenditures rose and <b>already</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> around 11% of the national budget in 1952. Together with reparation payments, this totalled over 20% of the budget. The economic policies of the SED favoured the development of heavy industry {{at the expense of the}} production of food and consumer goods, all of which resulted in a severe crisis in supplying the public with goods. Electricity was turned off in factories and public buildings at the onset of darkness every evening (during peak period).|$|E

25|$|Historians {{have long}} debated {{how and why}} many Bosnians {{converted}} to Islam. There is no simple answer to this question, and the underlying reasons are complex and numerous. One important {{fact is that the}} Ottomans did not, as a rule, actively seek to convert their Christian subjects to Islam (the many generations it took for Bosnia to become predominantly Muslim and the retaining of Slavic customs among converts testify to this). The Ottoman Empire at the time was centered on militaristic expansion independent of religion, and the primary split was not between Muslims and nonbelievers but between the military-administrative class (the Ottomans) and various classes of serfs (known as rayah), neither of which was exclusive to any particular faith. Though the state eventually acquired a more Islamic focus, by this time, Muslims <b>already</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> a large majority of Bosnia's population.|$|E
500|$|Upon his arrival, Goddard warned {{his client}} that a citizen's intervention, should it arise, {{was likely to}} succeed. It was, {{according}} to Goddard, his duty to advise her to withdraw her divorce petition. Simpson refused, but they both telephoned the King to inform {{him that she was}} willing to give him up so that he could remain king. It was, however, too late; the King had <b>already</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> his mind to go, even if he could not marry Simpson. Indeed, as the belief that the abdication was inevitable gathered strength, Goddard stated that: [...] " [...] client was ready to do anything to ease the situation but {{the other end of the}} wicket [...] was determined".|$|E
500|$|Knox disembarked in Dieppe, France, and {{continued}} to Geneva, where John Calvin had established his authority. When Knox arrived Calvin was in a difficult position. He had recently prosecuted {{the execution of the}} scholar Michael Servetus for heresy. Knox asked Calvin four difficult political questions: whether a minor could rule by divine right, whether a female could rule and transfer sovereignty to her husband, whether people should obey ungodly or idolatrous rulers, and what party godly persons should follow if they resisted an idolatrous ruler. Calvin gave cautious replies and referred him to the Swiss reformer Heinrich Bullinger in Zürich. Bullinger's responses were equally cautious; but Knox had <b>already</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> his mind. On 20 July 1554, he published a pamphlet attacking Mary Tudor and the bishops who had brought her to the throne. He also attacked the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V, calling him [...] "no less enemy to Christ than was Nero".|$|E

500|$|November {{began with}} a home match against Manchester United. Going into the match, both clubs were level on points and goal difference, {{at the top of}} the league. In the 45th minute, Gallas {{inadvertently}} scored an own goal to give United the lead, before Fábregas equalised early in the second half. Cristiano Ronaldo scored what was thought to be the winning goal, eight minutes from the end, but Arsenal equalised for the second time in the match via Gallas. The draw pleased Wenger, who after the game noted his team were [...] "...still charge of the title race because we are top with a game in hand". A win against Reading at the Madjeski Stadium on 12 November 2007 brought about Arsenal's 1,000th Premier League goal, scored by Adebayor. Reading striker Dave Kitson afterwards praised Arsenal's performance and asserted they were [...] "the best team on the planet": [...] "The thing that amazes you most is they are not just passing to each other – they are passing so that person can run on to the ball and then his mind is <b>already</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> what he is going to do next.

I was all for the Burmese and all against their oppressors, the British." [...] The narrator perceives that the conqueror is not in control, but it is rather {{the will of the}} people that governs his actions.

2500|$|In 1998, {{in order}} to {{establish}} the male DNA line, a panel of researchers conducted a Y-DNA study of living descendants of Jefferson's uncle, Field, and of a descendant of Sally's son, Eston Hemings. The results, published in the journal Nature, showed a Y-DNA match with the male Jefferson line. In 2000, the Thomas Jefferson Foundation (TJF) assembled a team of historians whose report concluded that, together with the DNA and historic evidence, there was a high probability that Jefferson was the father of Eston and likely of all Hemings' children. W. M. Wallenborn, who worked on the Monticello report, disagreed, claiming the committee had <b>already</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> their minds before evaluating the evidence, was a [...] "rush to judgement," [...] and that the claims of Jefferson's paternity were unsubstantiated and politically driven.|$|E
2500|$|According to a legal {{analysis}} by former Supreme Court President Vilma Morales, Zelaya automatically ceased being President of Honduras {{with the publication}} of decree PCM-020-2009 and thus no coup d'état existed. However, PCM-027-2009 was never processed by the Honduran courts. This new decree published in La Gaceta 26 June 2009 explained further the purpose, form and objectives of the opinion poll, to be carried out by the National Institute of Statistics. But the courts had <b>already</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> their minds about every attempt {{that had to do with}} this issue. Zelaya's lawyers were also denied the possibility to participate in the process. PCM-027-2009 was sheltered in article 5 of the [...] "Law of Citizen Participation" [...] and articles 2 and 5 of the Honduran Constitution. Zelaya defined his actions as a non-binding opinion poll, but his political opponents presented his actions as a binding referendum oriented at reforming articles in the Honduran Constitution concerning forms of government and re-election.|$|E

60|$|They spent a very {{pleasant}} evening at the farmhouse. Mr. Mitford owned a considerable extent of land, and was doing very well. He reared cattle and horses, which he sent down for sale to Wellington. The house was large and comfortable, and bore signs of the prosperity of its owner. The girls were delighted at the place. They had been left in care of relatives at home when their father and mother came out six years before to settle in New Zealand, and everything was as new to them as to Wilfrid.

60|$|Louis Lambert {{was driven}} {{from his home}} {{the day after that}} on which the house of his friend Winklemann was destroyed. His house was a stout one of two storeys, and, owing to its position, was less exposed to the current of the flood than many other dwellings. Confident of its {{strength}} and the security of its position, its owner had carried all his goods and furniture to the upper storey, but on returning, after assisting his friend, he found the water in it so high that he feared it might be set afloat--as some of the houses had <b>already</b> been--and finally <b>made</b> <b>up</b> his mind to remove.

60|$|As the new {{trustees}} employed {{on behalf}} of Madame Jaquêtanàpe and Mr. Figgs were well aware that they had much more to expect from the generosity of Tudor's friends than from any legal seizure of his property, they did not interfere in the disposal of the chairs and tables. But not on that account did Gertrude conceive herself entitled to make any use on her own behalf of such money as might come into her hands. The bills should be paid, and then every farthing that could be collected should be given towards lessening the deficiency. Six thousand pounds had <b>already</b> been <b>made</b> <b>up</b> by the joint efforts of Norman and Captain Cuttwater. Undy Scott's acknowledgement for the other four thousand had been offered, but the new trustees declined to accept it as of any value whatsoever.

60|$|It {{was while}} the Royal Commission on Boomfood was {{preparing}} its report that Herakleophorbia really began {{to demonstrate its}} capacity for leakage. And the earliness of this second outbreak was the more unfortunate, {{from the point of}} view of Cossar at any rate, since the draft report still in existence shows that the Commission had, under the tutelage of that most able member, Doctor Stephen Winkles (F.R.S. M.D. F.R.C.P. D. Sc. J.P. D.L. etc.), <b>already</b> quite <b>made</b> <b>up</b> its mind that accidental leakages were impossible, and was prepared to recommend that to entrust the preparation of Boomfood to a qualified committee (Winkles chiefly), with an entire control over its sale, was quite enough to satisfy all reasonable objections to its free diffusion. This committee was to have an absolute monopoly. And it is, no doubt, to be considered as a part of the irony of life that the first and most alarming of this second series of leakages occurred within fifty yards of a little cottage at Keston occupied during the summer months by Doctor Winkles.|$|R

Adderley Park-built Travellers were offered in a new range of colours from the paint range that BL had introduced for 1970, including vibrant shades such as Limeflower (lime green) and Aqua (turquoise). From 1971 Minors were fitted with a steering-column mounted ignition key and a steering lock rather than the facia-mounted ignition switch used up to that point.|$|R
