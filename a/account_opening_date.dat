40|$|This paper {{examines}} interannual {{variability in}} the <b>opening</b> <b>date</b> for the Prudhoe Bay shipping season (1953 - 2005), considers how variations in antecedent sea-ice and atmospheric conditions influence the <b>opening</b> <b>date,</b> and then develops a forecasting technique to predict whether the <b>opening</b> <b>date</b> will be early, normal, or late. Analysis of antecedent sea ice and atmospheric conditions indicates that there are {{significant differences in the}} Bering Sea ice cover as early as February in years preceding early versus late <b>opening</b> <b>dates.</b> In particular, prior to early opening years, the sea-ice cover in the southern Bering Sea is reduced in February, and as the season progresses, sea-ice concentrations in the central and northern Bering Sea remain lower in years preceding early <b>opening</b> <b>dates.</b> Analysis of accumulated freezing degree days (FDDs) also suggests that temperatures are warmer over a broad area, ranging from the Bering Sea through the Chukchi Sea and the Beaufort Sea, in winter and spring months preceding early <b>opening</b> <b>dates.</b> Although the warmer temperatures may be related to reductions in sea ice in the Bering Sea, our results suggest that 500 hPa flow patterns and sea level pressure (SLP) patterns play are a larger role in controlling accumulations of FDD in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas. Finally, an ordinal regression model is presented to forecast whether the <b>opening</b> <b>date</b> will be early, normal, or late. On the basis of April sea-ice concentrations and accumulated FDD, the model correctly forecasts the <b>opening</b> <b>date</b> class in 32 of the 53 years...|$|R

40|$|The <b>account</b> <b>opening</b> {{process is}} {{recognised}} {{as the most}} critical service if banks want to retain and build long term relationships with clients. An unsatisfactory customer experience during this process can influence the customer’s perception of the organisations overall service. Organisations are under increased pressure to deliver products in an efficient and effective manner with a reduction in cost. Having a competitive advantage in the <b>account</b> <b>opening</b> process will attract customers and create future sales opportunities. Future sales opportunities lead to growth and growth leads to increased profits. The research provides an insight on the current <b>account</b> <b>opening</b> process and challenges encountered within the process. The objective of the research is to examine literature and improve the <b>account</b> <b>opening</b> process at MNM bank. The existing <b>account</b> <b>opening</b> process takes 7. 5 days before the customer can transact on their account, which results in customers seeking an account at a competitor bank...|$|R

40|$|In {{the late}} 1950 s, the Pacific Coast Dungeness crab fishery had {{problems}} with timing {{the opening of the}} commercial crabbing season. There were different <b>opening</b> <b>dates</b> in the region, and areas that opened their crab seasons early put pressure on later-opening areas by shipping their crabs to those areas before the local season started. There was also a problem with early crabs not fully recovered from molting, and consequently not filled out. These issues were discussed at the 1959 Pacific Fishery Management Council without a resolution being reached. This 1960 paper summarizes Oregon's experiences with season <b>opening</b> <b>dates</b> and crab quality and suggests that a later <b>opening</b> <b>date</b> would be more beneficial...|$|R
