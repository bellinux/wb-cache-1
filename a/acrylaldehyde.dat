40|$|This {{work was}} {{dedicated}} to the development and evaluation of new chiral catalysts for asymmetric C-C and C-H bond forming reactions. In this context ESI-MS {{was used as a}} powerful tool for reactivity- and selectivity-studies. In the first part an ESI-MS screening method is described, which allows the determination of the selectivity of a chiral catalyst in the palladium catalyzed asymmetric allylic alkylation by testing its racemic form. It was shown that, by reacting a racemic mixture of the with a scalemic mixture of quasi-enantiomeric mass-labeled substrates, the selectivity of the chiral catalyst can be calculated from the ratio of the formed mass-labeled reaction intermediates. The value of this new method was demonstrated when different new aryl-PHOX-type ligands, which are not easily accessible in enantiopure form, were synthesized and evaluated in the allylic alkylation reaction. In this way a more selective member of this class was found compared to the previously reported phenyl-PHOX ligand. Since PHOX ligands are suitable ligands in the iridium-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of C-C and C-N double bonds, the new PHOX ligands were then tested as well in the iridium-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of different unsaturated compounds. Although low activities and selectivities were found in most cases, one ligand showed some promising results in the hydrogenation of allylic alcohols and imines. Furthermore air- and moisture-stable secondary phosphine oxide (SPO) containing bidentate ligands were tested in the palladium-catalyzed asymmetric allylic alkylation reaction. SPO,N-ligands bearing a PHOX type backbone were inactive in this transformation as they tend to form inactive palladium-bis-ligand complexes stabilized by hydrogen-bonding between the two ligands. SPO,P ligands however, were able to promote the desired reaction in a highly selective fashion although only low activities were found. During this work as well a new organo-catalyst, based on the structure of 2, 3 -dihydrobenzo[1, 4]oxazine, was developed which allows for the asymmetric transfer-hydrogenation of alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehydes. Especially in the reduction of beta, beta-diaryl <b>acrylaldehydes</b> very good activities and high enantioselectivities were achieved. It was shown that for this particular substrate this catalyst outperformed the previously described ones. Thus it proved to be a useful extension to the limited known catalysts for this reaction and especially for this interesting class of products, which can act as precursors for many natural products or drugs. Another organo-catalyzed reaction which was studied in this work was the conjugate addition reaction catalyzed by a tripeptidic organo-catalyst. As in the literature two different mechanistically pathways were hypothesized, via an enamine- or via an enol-intermediate, ESI-MS studies were carried out to clarify the actual mechanism for this transformation. All reaction intermediates which are postulated for the enamine-pathway could be found in both the forward- and the back-reaction. Furthermore the enantioselectivity of enamine-attack onto a nitroolefin was determined by an ESI-MS screening and it was shown that this enantioselectivity equals the selectivity of the preparative reaction. All of these findings strongly support the suggestion of an enamine-catalysis mechanism to be true in this reaction. The last part of this work aimed for the asymmetric alpha-allylation of carbonyl compounds by a tandem-catalysis approach. An intensive screening of both the organo-catalyst and the palladium-ligand led to reaction conditions which allowed for the selective mono-allylation of ketones in high yields. The formation of a quaternary center by alpha-allylation of alpha-branched aldehydes was also achieved. However, only low enantiomeric excesses were obtained in this transformation for the different catalyst systems tested. ...|$|R

40|$|Degradation and {{enantioselective}} bioaccumulation of diniconazole in earthworms (Eiseniafetida) in {{artificial soil}} was investigated using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method under laboratory condition. Three exposure concentrations (1 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg and 25 mg/kg) of diniconazole in soil (dry weight) to earthworms were used. The uptake kinetics fitted the first-order kinetics well. The bioaccumulation factors (BAF) of R, S isomers were 6. 6046 and 8. 5115 in 25 mg/kg dose exposure, 2. 6409 and 2. 9835 in 10 mg/kg dose exposure, 1. 7784 and 2. 0437 in 1 mg/kg dose exposure, respectively. Bioaccumulation of diniconazole in earthworm tissues was enantioselective with a preferential accumulation of S-diniconazole and the enantiomer fractions were about 0. 45 - 0. 50 {{in all three}} level dose exposures.

The maximal concentrations observed in blood, heart, liver, and kidney were 3. 18, 11. 35, 12. 32, 15. 03 mu g/g for S-diniconazole, and 1. 13, 3. 70, 6. 00, 2. 60 mu g/g for R-diniconazole. The elimination of enantiomers all met the one-compartment model in blood, heart, liver, and kidney well. The elimination half-lives (T- 1 / 2) of S-diniconazole were 2. 87, 3. 85, 5. 29, and 4. 42 h in blood, heart, liver, and kidney, respectively; the T- 1 / 2 of R-diniconazole were 2. 44, 3. 42, 146. 23, and 74. 02 h in blood, heart, liver, and kidney, respectively.

40|$|The {{advantages}} of the maize Adh system for low level mutagenesis studies are discussed. They include high mutation rate {{and the availability of}} both a strong selection system for null mutants and a sensitive method for detection of variants. The null selection involves treatment of pollen with allyl alcohol which is converted by the Adh enzyme to the toxic <b>acrylaldehyde.</b> Adh variants can be detected by alteration in affinity for phytic acid as well as thermal stability and electrophoretic mobility. There are three factors which should be considered in selecting a genetic system for low frequency mutagenesis studies. A selective system for mutants is almost an absolute requirement when one is dealing with very low mutation rates. Secondly, it is desirable to study a sensitive gene which mutates at a higher than average rate. Thirdly, it would be advantageous if the gene specifies a protein in which changes in primary structure are readily detectable, changes in addition to those which lead to an alteration in such properties as enzymatic activity, net charge, and stability. The Adh (alcohol dehydrogenase) gene in maize fulfills all of these requirements and is ideally suited for studies on low frequency mutagenesis. Adh is on the long arm of chromosome 1, about 1 1 / 2 map units from lw. The ADH enzyme is a dimer (1). Both subunits of the dimer are enzymatically active and a dimer composed of one active and one inactive subunit has only one-half the specific activity of a dimer with two active subunits (2). In heterozygotes for alleles that specify active and inactive enzymes, the total enzymatic activity of the heterodimers is equal to that of the active homodimers although there are twice as many heterodimers as active homodimers. The dimer can be dissociated by freezing {{in the presence of a}} reducing agent and high salt, and can be readily re-associated with recovery of almost full activity (3) ...|$|E
