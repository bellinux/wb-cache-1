5|$|Loring's {{grandfather}} was a respected teacher in Portland, Maine known as Master Loring, a descendant {{of one of the}} earliest settlers of Hingham, Massachusetts. Charles himself was a fifth great grandson of Hingham immigrant Deacon Thomas Loring. His mother was Sarah Wiley, a relative of Parson Wiley, a noted clergyman. His father Captain Horace Loring, a seaman who once visited the West Indies, took the young Loring on voyages <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> home as Cuba to prepare him for a life as a sea captain. But Loring disliked the ocean and the isolation and moved to Chicago in 1856 where he worked as a wheat speculator for B. P. Hutchinson and became a successful grain trader.|$|E

5|$|On December 19, 2012, {{evidence}} was presented that suggest {{a system of}} five planets orbiting Tau Ceti. The planets' estimated minimum masses are between two and six times the mass of Earth and their orbital periods range from 14 to 640 days. One of them, tentatively named Tau Ceti e, appears to orbit about half <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> Tau Ceti as Earth does from the Sun. With Tau Ceti's luminosity of 52% that of the Sun and {{a distance from the}} star of 0.552 AU, the planet would receive 1.71 times as much stellar radiation as Earth does, slightly less than Venus with 1.91 times Earth's. Nevertheless, some research places it within the star's habitable zone. The Planetary Habitability Laboratory has estimated that Tau Ceti f, which would receive 28.5% as much starlight as Earth, would be narrowly within the habitable zone of the star as well.|$|E
5|$|The {{chestnut}} sparrow {{is found}} in East Africa in mostly lower country from Darfur through Kordofan, South Sudan, Somalia, Uganda, and Kenya to north-central Tanzania. Its range also extends northeast into the southwest and Great Rift Valley of Ethiopia. Like the golden sparrows, it is sometimes nomadic when not breeding. Vagrants have been recorded <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> their breeding range as Dar es Salaam. It is found mostly in dry savanna and in fields and villages, but unlike its relations the golden sparrows, it is sometimes found in swamps of papyrus (certain Cyperus spp.). Its population has not been quantified, but {{it appears to be}} common across a very large range and it is assessed by the IUCN Red List as Least Concern for global extinction.|$|E
5|$|This {{beautiful}} species, {{which is}} sufficiently characterised to {{distinguish it from}} every other individual of the class, is copiously produced in Dutch Guiana, about 300 paces from the sea, and nearly <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> the left {{bank of the river}} of Surinam. It was communicated to me by the elder Vaillant, who discovered it in 1755 on some raised ground which was never overflowed by the highest tides, and is formed of a very fine white sand, covered with a thin stratum of earth. The prodigious quantity of individuals of this species which grow at the same time, the very different periods of their expansion, the brilliancy and the varied shades of their colours, present a prospect truly picturesque. The fungus was later placed in a new genus, Dictyophora, in 1809 by Nicaise Auguste Desvaux; it was then known for many years as Dictyophora indusiata. Christian Gottfried Daniel Nees von Esenbeck placed the species in Hymenophallus in 1817, as H.indusiatus. Both genera were eventually returned to synonyms of Phallus and the species is now known again by its original name.|$|E

5|$|Bonaparte {{believed}} that, {{by establishing}} a permanent presence in Egypt (nominally part of the neutral Ottoman Empire), the French would obtain a staging point for future operations against British India, possibly {{in conjunction with the}} Tipu Sultan of Seringapatam, that might successfully drive the British out of the war. The campaign would sever the chain of communication that connected Britain with India, {{an essential part of the}} British Empire whose trade generated the wealth that Britain required to prosecute the war successfully. The French Directory agreed with Bonaparte's plans, although a major factor in their decision was a desire to see the politically ambitious Bonaparte and the fiercely loyal veterans of his Italian campaigns travel <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> France as possible. During the spring of 1798, Bonaparte assembled more than 35,000 soldiers in Mediterranean France and Italy and developed a powerful fleet at Toulon. He also formed the Commission des Sciences et des Arts, a body of scientists and engineers intended to establish a French colony in Egypt. Napoleon kept the destination of the expedition top secret—most of the army's officers did not know of its target, and Bonaparte did not publicly reveal his goal until the first stage of the expedition was complete.|$|E

25|$|A {{conclusion}} {{from the}} above is that the buckling load of a column may be increased by changing its material to one with a higher modulus of elasticity (E), or changing {{the design of the}} column's cross section so as to increase the its moment of inertia.

25|$|Some {{observers}} {{predict that}} the English variant of Yeshivish may develop further {{to the point that}} it could become one of the historical Judeo-hybrid languages like Yiddish, Ladino or Judeo-Arabic. The Judeo-hybrid languages were spoken dialects which mixed elements of the local vernacular, Hebrew, Aramaic and Jewish religious idioms. As Yiddish was to Middle High German, Yeshivish may be to Standard American English. However, the integration of modern-day Jews with non-Jews may keep their speech from diverging <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> the standard language as it did in the past.|$|E
