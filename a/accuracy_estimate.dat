Conflicts are defined as base data with di#erent class labels that produced the same predictions {{by a set of}} base classifiers. Based on conflicts, we propose conflict-based <b>accuracy</b> <b>estimate</b> to determine the overall accuracy of a stacked classifier and conflict-based accuracy improvement estimate to determine the overall accuracy improvement over base classifiers. We discuss some popular metrics for comparing and evaluating a set of classifiers: coverage, correlated error, diversity and specialty, and show that these metrics do not accurately estimate the overall accuracy of a stacked classifier system. From experimental results, we demonstrate that conflict-based <b>accuracy</b> <b>estimate</b> is an e#ective measure to predict overall performance and compare different stacked systems, and conflict-based accuracy improvement estimate is a good measure to project the overall accuracy improvement [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Meta-learning {{involves}} {{the construction of}} a classifier that predicts the performance of another classifier. Previously proposed approaches do this by making a single prediction (such as the expected accuracy) for a complete data set. We suggest modifying this framework so that the meta-classifier predicts for each data point in the data set whether a particular base-classifier will classify it correctly or not. While this information can be converted into a standard meta-learning output such as an overall <b>accuracy</b> <b>estimate</b> for the complete data set, the approach has the added advantage of providing more fine-grained information which promises to be useful in Multiple Classifier Selection and Semi-Supervised Learning. This paper describes the new framework and reports the results of an initial evaluation on a medium-sized database of classification data sets. ...|$|E

However, improved stability of C 2 -NEB makes it suitable for more complex cases, where C 1 -NEB misses the TS because the MEP and NEB directions near the saddle point are different. Generally, C 2 -NEB not only finds the TS, but also guarantees, by construction, that the climbing images approach it from the opposite sides along the MEP.

40|$|An often {{neglected}} {{source of}} uncertainty on estimated cover percentage {{is caused by}} local view angle effects, where parts of bare soil patches are not visible due to vegetation blocking the sensor line-of-sight. When estimating the fractional cover of pixels far offnadir or at slopes pointing away from the sensor, plant cover can be overestimated by more than 50 %, seriously decreasing the accuracy. This problem is inherent when using wide field of view (FOV) sensors, or satellite sensors tilted off-nadir. In the following, results of a study using airborne HyMap hyperspectral data with a wide FOV of ± 32 ° are presented. Ground cover fractions for bare soil, green (PV) and dry (NPV) vegetation were derived using an iterative multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA) approach.

Within each meta-analysis, we ranked studies by publication date. We applied random-effects cumulative meta-analysis to follow how summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity evolved over time. Time trends were assessed by fitting a weighted linear regression model of the summary <b>accuracy</b> <b>estimate</b> against rank of publication.

40|$|The Eclipse coronagraphic {{telescope}} {{will allow for}} high contrast imaging near a target star to facilitate planet finding. One key element will be its high accuracy, high authority deformable mirror (DM) that controls the wave front error (WFE) down to an acceptable level.

40|$|Regression {{by means}} of {{projections}} to latent structures (PLS, also known as partial least squares) is a useful alternative to the linear multiple regression model fitted by least squares if {{at least one of}} the following conditions applies:- the x-variables, often known as predictors, are correlated;- the number of x-variables is relatively high compared with the number of observations;- the y-variable(s), often known as response(s), are correlated. Thus the PLS method is popular in industries that collect correlated predictor data, for example, multivariate calibration in analytical chemistry; spectroscopy in chemometrics; and quantitative structure activity relationships in drug design. The PLS method extracts orthogonal linear combinations of predictors, known as factors, from the predictor data which explain variance in both the predictors and response(s). In general, a PLS analysis consists of the stages: 1. Extract a given number of factors (more than is likely to be required) from data. 2.
