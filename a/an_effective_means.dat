5|$|A recent {{development}} {{is the use of}} the RDS system of car radios. The ambulance is fitted with a short range FM transmitter, set to RDS code 31, which interrupts the radio of all cars within range, {{in the manner of a}} traffic broadcast, but in such a way that the user of the receiving radio is unable to opt out of the message (as with traffic broadcasts). This feature is built into every RDS radio for use in national emergency broadcast systems, but short range units on emergency vehicles can prove <b>an</b> <b>effective</b> <b>means</b> of alerting traffic to their presence. It is, however, unlikely that this system could replace audible warnings, as it is unable to alert pedestrians, those not using a compatible radio or even have it turned off.|$|E
5|$|NASA astronauts train {{underwater}} {{to simulate}} the weightlessness and occasionally need to fly afterwards at cabin altitudes not exceeding 10,000 feet (3,000 meters). Training dives use 46% Nitrox and can exceed six hours at a maximum depth of 40ffw (12mfw) for a maximum equivalent air depth (EAD) of 24fsw (7 msw). NASA guidelines for EADs of 20–50fsw (6–15msw) with maximum dive durations of 100–400 minutes allow either air or oxygen to be breathed in the preflight surface intervals. Oxygen breathing during surface intervals reduces the time to fly {{by a factor of}} seven to nine times compared with air. A study by another military organization, the Special Operations Command also indicated that preflight oxygen might be <b>an</b> <b>effective</b> <b>means</b> for reducing DCS risk.|$|E
5|$|While East Timor's {{decision}} {{to form a}} military has been criticised by some commentators, the East Timorese government has consistently believed that the force is necessary for political and security reasons. Critics of the F-FDTL's establishment argue that as East Timor does not face any external threats the government's limited resources would be better spent on strengthening the PNTL. While East Timor's political leadership recognises that the country does not currently face an external threat, they {{believe that it is}} necessary to maintain a military capacity to deter future aggression. The establishment of the F-FDTL was also seen as <b>an</b> <b>effective</b> <b>means</b> of integrating FALINTIL into an independent East Timor.|$|E

5|$|While not {{uncommon}} in predominantly Catholic cultures, Christian metal is rooted in evangelical Protestantism, beginning {{as a means of}} evangelism among the non-Christian metal scene. Over the years the focus changed because of the increased secularization of Christianity in the West during the 1990s. Moberg (2008) notes that the current scene seems to have very little interest in evangelism, especially in Northern Europe. Instead, it is argued that the current Christian metal music scene ultimately provides its core members with important resources for the shaping of an alternative and complementary form of religious expression and practice and an alternative Christian identity. Thus, Moberg states that Christian metal serves four main purposes: an alternative form of religious expression and identity; as a legitimate form of religious expression; as <b>an</b> <b>effective</b> <b>means</b> of evangelism and fighting and standing up for the Christian faith; as a positive alternative to non-Christian metal.|$|E

In apoptotic responses to infection, the contents of an infected cell (including the pathogen) are contained and engulfed by phagocytosis. Some pathogens, such as human cytomegalovirus, express caspase inhibitors that arrest the apoptotic machinery of the host cell. The caspase-independence of necroptosis allows the cell to bypass caspase activation, decreasing the time during which the pathogen can inhabit the cell.|$|E
