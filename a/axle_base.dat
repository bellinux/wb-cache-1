They are replaced when they reach a diameter of 860mm. The cars are coupled 900mm above the rails by a semi-automatic coupling that was designed specifically for the ICE1. It couples two brake pipes, two electric trainlines, cables and two fibre optic cables. The passage between two cars is 1.1m wide and 2.05m high. Unlike on the InterCityExperimental, they are not positive locked on the outside.|$|E
50|$|From 1933 onwards, 650 Dresden class wagons were built, {{still in}} {{rivetted}} form, with an <b>axle</b> <b>base</b> increased from 7,000 mm to 7,700 mm. These demonstrated excellent running qualities and were therefore permitted {{to be used}} at speeds up to 90 km/h (secondary letter s). However it was problematic that the wagons did not fit on most weighbridges due to their long <b>axle</b> <b>base.</b> Even the wagons built from 1935 with a 7,000 mm <b>axle</b> <b>base,</b> were {{in spite of their}} long overhang, authorised for 90 km/h running.|$|E

50|$|Common to the {{different}} delivery batches were driving wheel diameters of 1,130 mm and <b>axle</b> <b>bases</b> of 2,200 mm. The length of the locomotive and {{the height of the}} centre of the boiler above the rails were also identical on all models. The locomotives of the last two batches had a steam dome, whilst the older ones just had a Regleraufsatz.|$|R
50|$|During the 1950s the International Union of Railways {{developed}} a standard design for covered goods wagons. This has 8 ventilation hatches {{and is therefore}} suitable for the transportation of cattle. Since then, European railways have procured covered wagons which at least match the main dimensions of this standard, but otherwise have minor variations. For example, there are wagons with different <b>axle</b> <b>bases</b> or a different number of ventilation hatches. The body is of a mainly wood and steel compound construction. Refrigerated vans were also developed, based on the long, twin-axled types (Gbs and Hbfs).|$|R

50|$|In 1964, Kirkstall Forge {{bought the}} Regent <b>Axle</b> company <b>based</b> in Burnley {{to expand its}} gear {{machining}} capabilities. In 1974, Kirkstall Forge Engineering was bought by GKN. It is now closed.|$|R
50|$|The engine, gearbox, {{suspension}} and rear <b>axle</b> were <b>based</b> on the KC mechanicals.In addition, 4-wheel drive was added via a 2-speed transfer case.Water propulsion was by a PTO driven propeller.Brakes were hydraulic.|$|R
25|$|In 1927, {{class leader}} N 110 was {{equipped}} with a two-cylinder Franklin booster engine which drove the trailing truck <b>axle.</b> <b>Based</b> {{on the success of}} this device, VR built all but two of the much larger X class 2-8-2s with booster engines. VR also modified the design of the Delta trailing truck on the second (1930-31 built) batch of N class locomotives to enable easy retrofitting of booster engines. Despite this, no further boosters were ever fitted, and in 1945, N 110's booster was removed and fitted to one of the two non-booster equipped X class locomotives.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of ordinary two-axle flat beds built since the 1950s were those with folding sides and short swivelling stanchions of UIC type 1 with, {{at least in}} Germany, an <b>axle</b> <b>base</b> of only 8 metres.|$|E
5000|$|After these {{experiences}} {{a completely new}} goods wagon was developed and built from 1934. It was produced only with a hand brake, and had a 7,000 mm <b>axle</b> <b>base</b> and overall length over buffers of 10,800 mm. It had, like the Gl Dresden with a 7,700 mm <b>axle</b> <b>base,</b> a trapezoidal strut frame and very good riding qualities {{as a result of}} its short overhang. Because its size was between that of the Gl and G wagons, it was grouped into the newly formed Oppeln class. To distinguish it from the later, shorter, type (see above) it is often referred to as the [...] "long Oppeln".|$|E
50|$|In {{the middle}} of the 1930s, several types {{appeared}} with a longer <b>axle</b> <b>base</b> that enable faster running. Some of these wagons were equipped with steam heating pipes (secondary letter h) in order to enable their inclusion in passenger trains.|$|E
50|$|Public {{response}} to the car was lukewarm due to a rigid <b>axle</b> <b>based</b> front suspension and a perpendicular body style which was by now perceived as old fashioned. In its class the car faced heavy competition, mainly from Opel, DKW and Adler: commercially the Ford Köln, with 11,121 cars produced between 1933 and 1936, was not a great success. Adler produced 24,013 of their similarly sized Trumpf Juniors {{in less than two}} years between 1934 and 1935. Ford Köln volumes were also disappointing when compared with the 153,117 produced by Ford of Britain of the equivalent model.|$|R
50|$|The main {{notation}}s are the Whyte notation (based on {{counting the}} wheels), the AAR wheel arrangement notation (based on counting either the axles or the bogies), and the UIC classification of locomotive <b>axle</b> arrangements (<b>based</b> on counting either the axles or the bogies).|$|R
5000|$|The Mercedes-Benz W22 {{was widely}} admired for its {{advanced}} high performance engine, for its sophisticated independent suspension {{and for the}} stylish elegance of the bodies. Its handling characteristics were infinitely superior to those of high powered cars from competitor manufacturers who were still using rigid <b>axle</b> <b>based</b> suspension configurations. However, this led to calls for still more raw speed, and in 1934 the Typ 380/W22 {{was replaced by the}} Typ 500K/W29 a slightly larger car with a significantly larger engine and, where a [...] "Kompressor" [...] was specified, [...] of power. [...] After less than two years, production of the Typ 380 ceased, with 154 built. Just seven were lightweight, open, two-seat sporting roadsters bodied by Mercedes-Benz’s own Sindelfingen coachworks.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotive}} had a two-cylinder {{compound engine}} with a Walschaerts valve gear and Lindner starting system (Anfahrvorrichtung). The engine drove the first coupled axle. The front twin-axled bogie had an <b>axle</b> <b>base</b> of 2,150 mm and side play of 39 mm.|$|E
5000|$|Despite all {{attempts}} at standardisation the 'special goods wagon' group became ever larger. Many standard components like the undercarriage with a 4,500mm <b>axle</b> <b>base,</b> were used here. There was {{a range of}} wagons for special purposes, that were often designed to facilitate loading and unloading: ...|$|E
50|$|Another engine {{built in}} 1889 by the Sächsischen Maschinenfabrik with running number 1418 {{differed}} from the other H VII T stock in {{that it had a}} longer <b>axle</b> <b>base</b> (2,500 mm), larger coupled wheels and a higher top speed of 45 km/h. It also had a lower overall weight.|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotive}} {{design was}} proposed {{as the base}} {{for a number of}} design variants: a single unit dual voltage freight variant E20, and dual unit dual voltage freight variant 2ES20, as well as single voltage DC and AC machines. Additional variants with a design derived from the EP20 are freight and passenger 4 <b>axle</b> Bo'Bo' <b>based</b> machines.|$|R
5|$|The chassis of the C5 {{consists}} of two identical metal pressings which are joined at top and bottom with a closing plate at the rear. It lacks a separate suspension system, instead relying on the chassis structure having enough torsional flex. Its motor was produced in Italy by Polymotor, {{a subsidiary of the}} Dutch company Philips. Although it was later famously said that the C5 was powered by a washing machine motor, the motor was in fact developed from a design produced to drive a truck cooling fan. Lotus provided the gearbox and a rear <b>axle</b> <b>based</b> on a design for car steering columns. The C5's electronics were produced by MetaLab, a Sinclair spin-off. The wheels were assembled from tyres made in Taiwan and wheels from Italy. Oldham Batteries provided a lead-acid battery developed for Sinclair that could manage more than the 300 charge-discharge cycles that had originally been specified.|$|R
5000|$|The {{manufacturer}} now offered {{two versions}} of the Kadett, designated the [...] "Kadett KJ38 and the [...] "Kadett K38" [...] the latter also being sold as the [...] "Kadett Spezial". Mechanically and in terms of published performance there was little to differentiate the two, but the [...] "Spezial" [...] had a chrome stripe below the window line, and extra external body trim in other areas such as on the front grill. The interior of the [...] "Spezial" [...] was also better equipped. To the extent that the 300 Mark saving for buyers of the car reflected reduced production costs, the major difference was that the more basic [...] "KJ38" [...] lost the synchromous springing with which the car had been launched, and which continued to be fitted on the [...] "Spezial". The base car instead reverted to traditional rigid <b>axle</b> <b>based</b> suspension similar to that fitted on the old Opel P4.|$|R
50|$|The {{suspension}} comprised nine-layered {{leaf springs}} with {{a length of}} 1,650 mm and {{a cross section of}} 120 mm x 16 mm. The springs were attached to their supports by means of rectangular suspension rings. The vehicles had an <b>axle</b> <b>base</b> of 7,000 mm. The external sole bars had a strut frame as additional bracing.|$|E
50|$|This four-wheeled, {{flat wagon}} with 8,000 mm <b>axle</b> <b>base,</b> 12,988 mm loading length, 20 ton maximum load and no hand brake was built from 1927. It {{differed}} from the Verbandsbauart version based on technical drawing A11 in {{a large number of}} design details. Including the welded wagons, a total of about 700 were built up to 1938.|$|E
50|$|These lidded wagons were longer (length over buffers with/without hand brake: 9,100mm / 9,800 mm) and had {{a greater}} <b>axle</b> <b>base</b> (4,000 mm) than their forebears {{designed}} {{on the basis of}} technical drawing A7. The side walls were now divided into two panels by a vertical brace either side of the door. With the renaming of the recently formed town of Barmen-Elberfeld to Wuppertal in 1930 the designation of this class also changed.|$|E
40|$|Accelerated Life Test (ALT) {{has been}} applied in the {{manufacturing}} for many years due to rapid changing technologies, more complex products, speedier product development, and more demanding customer requirements. These reasons have pushed the manufacturers to acquire reliability information faster. ALT allows reducing {{the time needed to}} show the reliability of the product. The {{purpose of this study is}} to design accelerated life testing which involved determination of normal test time, acceleration factor, acceleration test time, and finally experimental setup. This case study provides the basis for ALT designs for the tractor front <b>axle</b> <b>based</b> on customer usage and field failure analysis, which were conducted to estimate the current reliability, especially on the B 10 life during the operational stage of the product. The accelerated life test conducted has guaranteed the B 10 life of 4, 000 hours with 90 % confidence level for lesser time needed for testing to show the reliability of the front axle assembly...|$|R
40|$|Keywords-drive axle housing; shell element; solid element; {{finite element}} analysis; stress Abstract. The {{finite element model}} of drive axle housing was built by using the solid element and the shell element respectively. Vertical bend {{strength}} and stiffness under 2. 5 times of fully load of the drive axle housing were calculated by finite element method. By comparing {{the results of the}} vertical bend strength and stiffness of both models, we could know that both of the two models can be used to analyze the whole stress situation of drive axle housing. Because there were fewer elements of drive <b>axle</b> housing model <b>based</b> on shell element, the amount of final calculation was less. It is more feasible to analyze the whole stress situation of drive axle housing by establishing drive <b>axle</b> housing <b>based</b> on shell element...|$|R
5000|$|At {{the front}} the {{suspension}} was redesigned, now incorporating MacPherson struts. The result was more compact, lighter, and probably cheaper to assemble than the uneven wishbone arrangements {{on the previous}} model, and the car's handling benefitted. Unfortunately Opel approached the Rekord's suspension upgrade [...] "one end at a time", however. At the back the Rekord E retained from the previous model a beam axle tamed with four trailing connector arms, a Panhard rod like system and an anti-roll bar, in combination with coil springs and shock absorbers. Commentators felt that by now the rigid-rear <b>axle</b> <b>based</b> rear suspension fell short of mainstream west European standards {{in terms of the}} handling characteristics that it provided. However, customers wishing for more control over the back axle during fast bumpy rides could specify a [...] "sports package" [...] in the Opel Rekord E: the package included replacement of the standard oil-filled shock absorbers {{at the back of the}} car by gas-filled shocks. There will no doubt have been a trade-off in terms of a firmer ride in exchange for reduced wallow.|$|R
5000|$|From 1937 the <b>axle</b> <b>base</b> was {{increased}} to 6,000 mm {{in order to}} give it better riding qualities; as a result the top speed could be set at 90 km/h (secondary letter s). These exclusively welded wagons were grouped into the Oppeln class. The [...] "short Oppeln" [...] was the most numerous Austauschbauart with 28,000 units being built. In contrast to the [...] "long Oppeln", (see below), it had a triangular strut frame.|$|E
5000|$|For {{the open}} wagons, by contrast, {{not only was}} a higher maximum load demanded, but also a greater loading volume. As a result, in 1937/38 the Omm wagon was {{designed}} from scratch with a maximum load of 24.5 tons and a loading length of 8.72 m (as opposed to 7.72 m on Om wagons). Construction began in 1939. Notable external features are the <b>axle</b> <b>base</b> of 6 m and the three-dimensional strut frame that tapers downwards to a point. A total of 73,850 of these wagons appeared in three variants: ...|$|E

40|$|Train {{loads and}} travel speeds have {{increased}} over time, requiring more efficient non-destructive inspection methods. Railway axles are critical elements; despite being designed to {{last more than}} 20 years several cases of premature failure have been recorded. Train axles are inspected regularly, but the limits associated to the traditional inspection technologies create a growing interest towards new solutions. Here a novel non-destructive inspection method of in-service <b>axles</b> <b>based</b> on non-contact data collection is presented. The propagation of surface waves, generated by a thermo-elastic laser source, is investigated using a finite element method based on dynamic explicit integration. Coupled thermo-mechanical simulations allow visualization of the ultrasonic field guiding {{the definition of the}} optimal NDT setup. The geometry of the axle and of the elements mounted on it is accurately reproduced; moreover the press fit effect caused by the wheel and the bearing rings is implemented. The current NDT techniques for railway axles require removing wheels and other components from the axle. The presented scheme uses non-contact ultrasonic generation and detection allowing non-contact in-service inspection of railway axles at trackside station. The numerical results are promising and encourage us to test the new approach experimentally...|$|R
