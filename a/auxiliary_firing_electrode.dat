50|$|The {{history of}} the Hong Kong Fire Service began in the Government Gazette dated May 9, 1868. Charles May became the first Superintendent of the Fire Brigade. At the time, the Fire Department {{was part of the}} Hong Kong Police Force in 1846. It had a total {{strength}} of 62 with a supplement of 100 Chinese volunteers.The fire department expanded to 140 members during the 1920s. During the Japanese Occupation during the World War II, the Service disbanded. The two fire engines were exported to Tokyo {{to become part of the}} Imperial Palace Fire Unit. It was only returned after the War. Unlike Canada, UK and some countries, Hong Kong's ambulance service is tied directly with the Fire Department. At that time all emergency ambulance service was provided by the Fire Service while non-emergency was handled by the Medical Corps.

50|$|The <b>Auxiliary</b> <b>Fire</b> Service (AFS) {{was first}} formed in 1938 in Great Britain {{as part of}} the Civil Defence Service.

The <b>Auxiliary</b> <b>Fire</b> Service and the local brigades were superseded in August 1941 by the National Fire Service. After the war the AFS was reformed alongside the Civil Defence Corps, forming part of the UK's planned emergency response to a nuclear attack. It was disbanded in the UK in 1968.|$|R
