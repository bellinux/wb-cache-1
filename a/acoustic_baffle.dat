As expected, the inlet baffles caused a reduction in facility performance. About half of the performance loss was recovered by addition the flow splitters to the downstream baffles.

40|$|A multi-driver {{loudspeaker}} system is discussed. Methods of dividing the input frequency spectrum between loudspeaker drivers are presented. It is proposed that an optimal crossover {{is one in}} which the acoustic recombination of the signal in the listening area is a perfect replica of the input signal. Loudspeaker pressure response is discussed when two loudspeaker drivers are separated by a finite distance on a common <b>acoustic</b> <b>baffle.</b> The pressure response of the {{loudspeaker system}} is shown to depend not only on the crossover transfer functions but also the loudspeaker transfer functions. It is shown that by using two non-coincident drivers to reproduce the audio spectrum, an angle-off-axis dependent time delay is introduced. Constant voltage filters and their relation to real driver frequency responses are discussed. Cascaded Butterworth and Butterworth filters are related to real driver parameters with the cascaded Butterworth shown to cause the two drivers to interact over the smallest bandwidth. Three loudspeakers were designed demonstrating that the loudspeaker transfer function could be designed into the overall crossover transfer function by careful driver selection and enclosure tuning. Low distortion driver/enclosures were demonstrated of this type. Three separate active crossovers were constructed to enable the tests of the three loudspeaker systems. A crossover was designed using standard Butterworth two pole sections that could be switched to a number of different combinations for all three proposed systems. Overall system response tests were performed that verified theory with respect to a symmetrical radiation in the vertical plane. Off axis response abberations at high frequencies were shown to exist due to the angle-off-axis time delay...|$|E
40|$|The {{different}} {{technologies of}} passive cooling concepts {{have to rely}} on a good thermal coupling between a building’s thermal mass and indoor air. In many cases, the ceiling is the only surface remaining for a good coupling. Further research is necessary to investigate discrepancies between existing correlations. Therefore, the overall aim of the work described in this thesis is the investigation of heat transfer at a heated ceiling in an experimental chamber. <b>Acoustic</b> <b>baffles</b> obstruct the surface of the ceiling and impede heat transfer. However, there is nearly no published data about the effect of such baffles on heat transfer. Available results from simulations should be verified with an experimental investigation. Consequently, one of the primary aims of this work was to experimentally determine the influence of such <b>acoustic</b> <b>baffles.</b> A suitable experimental chamber has been built at Biberach University of Applied Sciences. The thesis describes the experimental chamber, the experimental programme as well as results from five different test series. With a value of ± 0. 1 W/(m² K) for larger temperature differences, uncertainty in resulting convective heat transfer coefficients for natural convection is comparable to that of results from an existing recent experimental work often recommended for use. Additionally, total heat transfer (by convection and radiation) results are presented. Results are given for natural, forced and mixed convection conditions at an unobstructed heated ceiling. Furthermore, results for <b>acoustic</b> <b>baffles</b> in both an unventilated and a ventilated chamber are shown. Natural convection results show a very good agreement with existing correlations. Under mixed convection conditions, convective heat transfer at an unobstructed ceiling decreases to the limiting case described by natural convection.

40|$|Refraction of the {{acoustic}} beam from a sodar, or {{translation of the}} beam due to the wind (known as wind drift), both affect the scattering angle and hence the Doppler shift of the return signal. Wind drift {{has been the subject}} of a number of previous studies, which have shown that errors increase with wind speed, giving about 6 [*]% error in the estimated wind speed when the actual wind speed is 7 [*]ms− 1. Since previous studies have not treated the general case of finite angular beam width, a new analytic treatment is given here for monostatic sodars. Surprisingly, it is found that the Doppler error contributed by the transmitted beam is exactly compensated by the Doppler error contributed by the received beam, if the two beam widths are the same. If the transmitter beam width is not equal to the receiver beam width, then either over-estimation or under-estimation of wind speed results, depending on which beam is wider. This has implications for bi-static sodars, in which it is not possible to match beam widths. Contrary to this new theory, examples of field comparisons with mast instrumentation show a non-linear relationship between wind speeds measured by a sodar and wind speeds measured by mast-mounted instruments. It is proposed that this is due to the <b>acoustic</b> <b>baffle</b> clipping the received beam and changing its width, since the received beam must return at lower elevations from scattering downwind. This is shown to be feasible for a Metek sodar. The sign and magnitude of the observed non-linear dependence of estimated wind speed on actual wind speed are consistent with this proposed mechanism...|$|E

Mardas boasted that he could build a much better studio, with a 72-track tape machine, instead of the 4-track at Abbey Road—which was being updated at the time to an 8-track—so he was given the job of designing the new Apple Studio in the basement of Apple headquarters on Savile Row.

40|$|As New York' subway has {{adapted to}} changes in population, routing, and technology, {{numerous}} platforms have been abandoned - left as vestigial spaces within functioning stations. Despite their disuse, these spaces have enormous latent potential. This project couples two circulatory infrastructures in the city, public libraries and public transit, to reclaim three such platforms as sites for a new institution [...] the Open Library. This institution seeks to extend {{the historical development of}} the library with a greater focus on access, knowledge production, and user-agency while also acknowledging the mobility inherent in the modern city and providing opportunities for interaction and circulation among people and artifacts. Located on abandoned platforms at Columbus Circle, Canal Street, and Brooklyn Bridge Stations, these libraries are designed such that the space of the library functions as a diagram of the institution. Each is an open, linear space formed between walls which function as reinvented stacks.

40|$|Shear-coaxial {{injector}} {{elements are}} often used in liquid-propellant-rocket thrust chambers, where combustion instabilities remain a significant problem. A conventional solution to the combustion instability problem relies on passive control techniques that use empirically-tested hardware such as <b>acoustic</b> <b>baffles</b> and tuned cavities. In addition to adding weight and decreasing engine performance, these devices are designd using trial-and-error empirical science, which does not provide the capability to predict the overall system stability characteristics in advance. In this thesis, two novel control strategies {{that are based on}} propellant fluid dynamics were investigated for mitigating acoustic instability involving shear-coaxial injector elements. The new control strategies would use a set of controlled injectors allowing local adjustment of propellant flow patterns for each operating condition, of which the instability could become a problem. One strategy relies on reducing the oxidizer-fuel density gradient by blending heavier methane to the main fuel hydrogen. Another strategy utilizes modifying the equivalence ratio to affect the acoustic impedance through the mixing and reaction rate changes. To provide the scientific basis, unit-physics experiments were conducted to explore the potential effectiveness of these strategies. Two different model combustors, simulating a single-element injector test and a double-element injector test, were designed and tested for flame-acoustic interaction. For these experiments, the Reynolds number of the central oxygen jet was kept between 4700 and 5500 making the injector flames sufficiently turbulent. A compression driver, mounted {{on one side of the}} combustor wall, provided controlled acoustic excitation to the injector flames, simulating the initial phase of flame-acoustic interaction. Acoustic excitation was applied either as a band-limited white noise forcing between 100 Hz and 5000 Hz or as a single-frequency, fixed-amplitude forcing at 1150 Hz which represented a frequency least amplified by any resonance. Effects of each control strategy on flame-acoustic interaction were assessed in terms of modifying the acoustic resonance characteristics subject to white-noise excitation and changes in flame brush thickness under single-frequency excitation. In the methane blending experiments, the methane mole fraction was varied between 0 % and 63 %. Under white noise excitation, up to 16 % shift in a resonant frequency was observed but the acoustic pressure spectrum remained qualitatively similar. For the fixed frequency forcing, the spatial extent of flame-acoustic interaction was substantially reduced. In the other experiments, the equivalence ratio of the control injector was varied between 0 and infinity, causing up to 40 % shift in a resonant frequency as well as changes in the acoustic pressure spectrum. These results open up the possibility of employing flow-based control to prevent combustion instabilities in liquid-fueled rockets...|$|R

The classic RCA Type 77-DX microphone has several externally adjustable positions of the internal baffle, allowing the selection of several response patterns ranging from [...] "figure-eight" [...] to [...] "unidirectional". Such older ribbon microphones, some of which still provide high quality sound reproduction, were once valued for this reason, but a good low-frequency response could be obtained only when the ribbon was suspended very loosely, which made them relatively fragile. Modern ribbon materials, including new nanomaterials have now been introduced that eliminate those concerns, and even improve the effective dynamic range of ribbon microphones at low frequencies. Protective wind screens can reduce the danger of damaging a vintage ribbon, and also reduce plosive artifacts in the recording. Properly designed wind screens produce negligible treble attenuation. In common with other classes of dynamic microphone, ribbon microphones don't require phantom power; in fact, this voltage can damage some older ribbon microphones. Some new modern ribbon microphone designs incorporate a preamplifier and, therefore, do require phantom power, and circuits of modern passive ribbon microphones, i.e., those without the aforementioned preamplifier, are specifically designed to resist damage to the ribbon and transformer by phantom power. Also there are new ribbon materials available that are immune to wind blasts and phantom power.|$|R
