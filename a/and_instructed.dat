5|$|Deane Malott, {{who became}} {{president}} of Cornell in 1951, was much less sympathetic, <b>and</b> <b>instructed</b> Morrison to curtail all activities beyond his academic field.

5|$|Applewhite and Nettles {{sometimes}} made sudden, {{drastic changes}} to the group. On one occasion in Texas, they told their followers of a forthcoming visitation from extraterrestrials <b>and</b> <b>instructed</b> them to wait outside all night, at which point they informed them that this had been merely a test. Lalich sees this as {{a way that they}} increased their students' devotion, ensuring that their commitment became irrespective of what they saw. Members became desperate for Applewhite's approval, which he used to control them.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of the premiere, Italy had {{experienced}} political and social unrest for several years. The start of the Holy Year in December 1899 attracted the religious to the city, but also brought threats from anarchists and other anticlericals. Police received warnings of an anarchist bombing of the theatre, <b>and</b> <b>instructed</b> Mugnone (who had survived a theatre bombing in Barcelona), that in an emergency he was to strike up the royal march. The unrest caused the premiere to be postponed by one day, to 14January.|$|E

5|$|In 1954, Luang Pu Sodh made an {{announcement}} {{that he would}} die soon, <b>and</b> <b>instructed</b> his students to continue their duties without him, especially to propagate Dhammakaya meditation. Two years later, {{he was diagnosed with}} hypertension. Luang Pu Sodh died in 1959. His body was not cremated, but embalmed, so that after his death people would still come and support Wat Paknam. In Wat Phra Dhammakaya a memorial hall was built in honor of Luang Pu Sodh, and in Wat Paknam, a charity foundation was started in his name.|$|E

5|$|In January 1531, Campeggio was {{dismissed}} as cardinal protector, {{although it did}} not become public knowledge until May. At first {{it was unclear whether}} Henry VIII intended to appoint a successor, with Giovanni Domenico de Cupis emerging as an active candidate in March 1532. The king favoured Alessandro Farnese (future Pope Paul III), <b>and</b> <b>instructed</b> his ambassadors on 21 March to offer it to Farnese, and then de Cupis or Giovanni del Monte (future Pope Julius III) in the event that Farnese declined or was not approved.|$|E
5|$|In May, before Cascade {{had become}} fully operational, Rommel {{defeated}} the British Army in Libya. Auchinleck rallied his forces at El Alamein and asked Clarke to draft plans for delaying the Axis advance, giving the Allies time to withdraw. Operation Sentinel {{was designed to}} convince Rommel, using camouflage, fakery and radio deception, that substantial British armour sat {{between him and the}} retreating Eighth Army. In spite of his success at El Alamein Auchinleck was replaced by Harold Alexander on , Clarke's third commander in under two years. Bernard Montgomery was handed control of the Eighth Army <b>and</b> <b>instructed</b> to push Rommel back. Montgomery knew Clarke, having taught him infantry tactics at the Staff College in 1931, <b>and</b> <b>instructed</b> him to prepare deception plans for the Second Battle of El Alamein. The plan involved major camouflage activity, Operation Bertram, radio deception, Operation Canwell and a disinformation campaign, Operation Treatment. On 9 September Clarke was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE). The citation recognised his efforts in setting up A-Force, but referred to its less clandestine MI9 escape and evasion work.|$|E
5|$|In pre-Islamic Arabia, a time {{known as}} jahiliyyah, the Kaaba became {{surrounded}} by pagan idols. In 630 CE, Muhammad led his followers from Medina to Mecca, cleansed the Kaaba by destroying all the pagan idols, and then reconsecrated {{the building to}} Allah. In 632 CE, Muhammad performed his only and last pilgrimage {{with a large number}} of followers, <b>and</b> <b>instructed</b> them on the rites of Hajj. It was from this point that Hajj became one of the five pillars of Islam.|$|E

A fort on the Lippe called Castra Aliso was besieged, but the attackers dispersed on sight of Roman reinforcements. The Germans destroyed the nearby mound and altar dedicated to his father Drusus, but he had them both restored and celebrated funerary games with his legions {{in honor of his}} father. New barriers and earthworks were put in place, securing the area between Fort Aliso and the Rhine.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the first}} raids of the Viking era may have taken place near Dorchester around 790.

5|$|The Royalist expeditionary navy {{that would}} raid San Lorenzo {{comprised}} eleven ships of varying sizes, {{two hundred and}} fifty soldiers and fifty sailors. They moved into the Paraná through its tributary, the Paraná Guazú River, slowed down by headwinds. The Second Triumvirate promoted José de San Martín to colonel <b>and</b> <b>instructed</b> him to follow them with the Regiment of Mounted Grenadiers and stop the raids. San Martín was influenced by Napoleonic warfare and trained the regiment with the most recent military techniques used in the Napoleonic Wars.|$|E

The Undertaker defeated Kamala, who was managed by Wippleman, at SummerSlam 1992. A rematch was held at Survivor Series 1992, and The Undertaker beat Kamala in a coffin match. Wippleman vowed revenge, and he introduced Gonzalez at Royal Rumble 1993 <b>and</b> <b>instructed</b> him to attack The Undertaker.

5|$|The band's {{previous}} album, 1989's Mother's Milk {{would become}} the band's second album to enter in the Billboard 200, peaking at number 52 {{and at the time}} the biggest of their career. Although the record was mildly successful, production was weighed down by producer Michael Beinhorn. He convinced Frusciante to play with an overall heavier tone, <b>and</b> <b>instructed</b> Kiedis to write lyrics that would be more radio viable, thus causing the band to feel restricted creatively.|$|E
