5|$|A third {{method is}} for {{authorities}} simply to talk down {{the value of}} their currency by hinting at future action to discourage speculators from betting on a future rise, though sometimes this has little discernible effect. Finally, a central bank can effect a devaluation by lowering its base rate of interest; however this sometimes has limited effect, <b>and,</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> end of World War II, most central banks have set their base rate according to the needs of their domestic economy.|$|E
5|$|An {{investigation}} {{conducted by}} the office of the Prosecutors General of the Soviet Union (1990–1991) and the Russian Federation (1991–2004) confirmed Soviet responsibility for the massacres but refused to classify this action as a war crime or an act of genocide. The investigation was closed {{on the grounds that the}} perpetrators of the atrocity were already dead, <b>and</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> Russian government would not classify the dead as victims of the Great Purge, formal posthumous rehabilitation was deemed inapplicable.|$|E

5|$|Each of {{the wings}} {{consists}} of a thin membrane supported by a system of veins. The membrane is formed by two layers of integument closely apposed, while the veins are formed where the two layers remain separate; sometimes the lower cuticle is thicker and more heavily sclerotized under a vein. Within each of the major veins there is a nerve and a trachea, <b>and,</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> cavities of the veins are connected with the hemocoel, hemolymph can flow into the wings.|$|E

5|$|Like other minks, {{individual}} sea minks {{may have}} maintained home ranges, <b>and,</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> males were larger and required more food, males {{would have had}} larger territorial claims.

More cautiously, he called on Russia's government to introduce reforms in Russian-controlled Congress Poland.
