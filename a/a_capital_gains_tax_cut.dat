40|$|<b>A</b> <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> is {{once again}} on the {{legislative}} agenda. Proponents of a tax cut claim that {{it will lead to}} increased saving and investment, increased entre-preneurial activity, and consequently higher government revenues. Unlike in debates earlier this decade, current advo-cates of <b>a</b> <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> seem not to be pushing the idea that increased capital gains realizations alone are suffi-cient to cause revenues to rise in re-sponse to a lower tax rate. Current oppo-nents of a tax cut, on the other hand, maintain that a lower capital gains tax rate will have few positive incentive ef-fects, will induce an inefficient allocation of investment, and will lower taxes paid by the well-to-do. The equity argument of opponents, therefore, does rest on the assumption that capital gains realizations are not sufficiently sensitive to the capital gains tax rate to cause revenues to rise in response to a lower tax rate.

For all parameter values, the tax cut increases the mature firms ’ desired capital stock, holding interest rates constant.

40|$|The {{call for}} an {{across-the-board}} cut in {{the capital gains tax}} rate has won growing bipartisan support. Advocates claim that a tax cut would spur new investment, reward productive enterprise, serve as a simple proxy for inflation indexing, 1 and generate additional tax revenue from the consequent increases in asset turnover and productivity. Opponents contend <b>a</b> <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> would disproportionately benefit the wealthiest taxpayers, that productive investment is relatively insensitive to capital gains tax rates, 2 and that any boost to asset turnover would be merely temporary. However, such debate ignores the fact that a large and growing share of capital gains tax revenues, perhaps as large as two-thirds of such receipts, are generated in the real estate sector, a sector that has little discernible impact on productive investment or employment. Moreover, the recent stock market rise has enlarged the number of taxpayers who now stand to gain from <b>a</b> <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> [...] even as it further weakens the rationale that a cut is required to stimulate economic growth. If the goal of the tax cut is to stimulate productive investment, then reductions should be targeted to those sectors most likely to generate them. A cut allowed the real estate sector not only would not stimulate new, productive investment, but would exacerbate existing economic distortions created by the tax.

40|$|The recent {{enactment}} of <b>a</b> <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> resulted, according to Hudson and Feder, from {{the absence of}} a true appreciation or consideration of the real beneficiaries of such a cut, probable actual effects, the distinction between productive and nonproductive sources of capital gains (two-thirds of capital gains accrue to real estate, which is a fixed, nonproductive asset), and distortions in our current income accounting system (which shield most taxation). The across-the-board cut, which treats real estate appreciation and true capital gains as estate income from the same, is a giveaway to real estate and will steer capital and entrepreneurial resources to a search for unearned income. ...|$|E
40|$|Tax {{changes are}} often {{announced}} before their implementation {{and are not}} permanent, but rather only temporary. Accordingly, R&D firms will optimally adjust their investment decisions to fit tax schedule changes. This study analyzes how changes in various tax rates relevant to corporate activities affect growth and welfare, considering their methods of implementation. For this purpose, we consider adjustment costs involved in the investment process and allow firms to make a forward looking investment decision in a R&D-based endogenous growth model. Calibrating the model with U. S. data, we find that a dividend tax cut reduces the level of welfare irrespective of implementation method. On the other hand, <b>a</b> <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> and {{a rise in the}} R&D tax credit rate enhance the level of welfare irrespective of implementation.

40|$|Recent {{proposals}} {{have been made}} to enact either a temporary or a permanent capital gains tax cut. The former would probably gain revenue in the first 2 years but lose that revenue and more, most likely within the following 3 years. H. R. 3090, passed by the House, would lower the top tax rate from 20 % to 18 % for assets held at least a year. The Senate Finance Committee version of H. R. 3090, does not reduce capital gains taxes. <b>A</b> <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> appears the least likely of any permanent tax cut to stimulate the economy in the short run; a temporary capital gains tax cut is unlikely to provide any stimulus.

40|$|This brief {{assesses the}} effect of <b>a</b> <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> on firms' {{decisions}} to undertake new investment projects and the possible effect of such projects on economic growth and employment. The authors' analysis takes into account such factors as projects' degree of uncertainty, investors' degree of risk aversion, whether capital gains losses are deductible against capital gains income, whether {{the market value of}} an investment project is affected by the imposition of capital gains taxes, and whether the project is financed by internal or external means. They find that there is little theoretical or empirical basis for the view that lowering the capital gains tax rate would have a substantial effect on economic growth or level of economic activity. They estimate that the current proposal to lower the highest capital gains tax rate from 28. 0 percent to 19. 8 percent would have a long-term effect on the level of output no greater than the impact of roughly two months of normal economic growth, and it would take years to realize even this small benefit. Indexing the rate to inflation would have a somewhat larger, but still small, effect. The authors conclude that capital gains taxes have a negligible influence on investment decisions and dispute the claim that a lower capital gains tax rate would have large beneficial effects on output, growth, or entrepreneurial activity in the US economy...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} different forms of taxation on economic growth in a model with endogenous technical progress and finitely-lived agents.

Therefore, tax reforms aimed to be revenue neutral and growth enhancing should envisage to lower direct taxes while increasing indirect taxes. If there is a bubble in the economy, i. e. a situation where prices of assets differ from their fundamental market values, growth rates are lower since investments are diverted away from productive investments in <b>capital.</b> <b>A</b> <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> <b>tax,</b> though, limits {{the size of the}} bubble and, hence, affects growth rates positively in an economy with an asset bubble.
