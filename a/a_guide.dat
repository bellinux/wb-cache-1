40|$|This study {{describes}} a range sensitivity of a canard controlled missile. An investigation was conducted into {{the relative importance}} of aerodynamic parameters on <b>a</b> <b>guided</b> missile. Also this study was analyzed by quantifying their effects on the missile range. To analyze the range sensitivity of <b>a</b> <b>guided</b> missile, <b>a</b> trajectory analysis program of <b>a</b> <b>guided</b> missile was developed. The range sensitivity analysis was conducted on a thrust, weight, drag and lift. The result of the range sensitivity analysis shows that the design parameters with the greatest effect on the missile range are thrust, drag, weight, and lift, in descending order of importance. The thrust on range extension is quite obvious to extend a range of <b>a</b> <b>guided</b> missile. In particular, the drag exhibited greater range sensitivity than lift at <b>a</b> <b>guided</b> flight. The result also shows that missile range could be maximized by applyin...|$|R
40|$|<b>A</b> <b>guiding</b> {{catheter}} {{was used}} in seven patients who underwent balloon dilation of nine renal arteries. The advantages of using <b>a</b> <b>guiding</b> catheter for renal angioplasty are analogous to the benefits obtained with <b>a</b> coronary angioplasty <b>guiding</b> catheter used in coronary angioplasty. The guiding catheter provides back-up support to cross lesions and allows selective contrast visualization of the lesion before, during, and after dilation. It is also possible, when using <b>a</b> <b>guiding</b> catheter, to measure pressure gradients across lesions without having to recross the lesion which may help to ensure that adequate dilation of the stenosis has been accomplished...|$|R
