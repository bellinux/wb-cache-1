25|$|The High Lamas used {{several ways}} in which they can {{increase}} the chances of finding a person they claim to be the reincarnation. High Lamas often visit Lhamo La-tso, a lake in central Tibet, <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> <b>for</b> a sign from the lake itself. This may be either a claimed 'vision' or some 'indication' of the direction in which to search, and this was how Tenzin Gyatso was determined to be the next Dalai Lama.|$|E
25|$|Adult {{tarantula}} hawks are nectarivorous. The {{consumption of}} fermented fruit sometimes intoxicates {{them to the}} point that flight becomes difficult. While the wasps tend to be most active in daytime summer months, they tend to avoid high temperatures. The male tarantula hawk does not hunt; instead, it feeds off the flowers of milkweeds, western soapberry trees, or mesquite trees (females feed on these same plants, as well). Male tarantula hawks have been observed practicing a behavior called hill-topping, in which they sit atop tall plants <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> <b>for</b> passing females ready to reproduce. Females are not very aggressive, in that they are hesitant to sting, but the sting is extraordinarily painful.|$|E

25|$|The fire service, {{known as}} the Barun Yantra Karyalaya, opened its first station in Kathmandu in 1937 with a single vehicle. An iron tower was erected to monitor the city <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> <b>for</b> fire. As a precautionary measure, firemen {{were sent to the}} areas which were {{designated}} as accident-prone areas. In 1944, the fire service was extended to the neighboring cities of Lalitpur and Bhaktapur. In 1966, a fire service was established in Kathmandu airport. In 1975, a West German government donation added seven fire engines to Kathmandu's fire service. The fire service in the city is also overlooked by an international non-governmental organization, the Firefighters Volunteer Association of Nepal (FAN), which was established in 2000 with the purpose of raising public awareness about fire and improving safety.|$|E
25|$|Primarily aquatic, {{they eat}} {{a wide variety}} of prey, almost {{anything}} they can manage to overpower, including fish, birds, a variety of mammals, and other reptiles. Particularly large anacondas may consume large prey such as tapirs, deer, capybaras, caimans, and even jaguars, but such large meals are not regularly consumed. The green anaconda's eyes and nose are located {{on the top of the}} head, allowing the snake to breathe <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> <b>for</b> prey while the vast majority of the body is hidden underwater. Many local stories and legends report the anaconda as a man-eater, but little evidence supports any such activity. They employ constriction to subdue their prey. Cannibalism among green anacondas is also known, most recorded cases involving a larger female consuming a smaller male. While the exact reason for this is not understood, scientists cite several possibilities, including the dramatic sexual dimorphism in the species, and the possibility that a female anaconda requires additional food intake after breeding to sustain the long period of gestation. The nearby male simply provides the opportunistic female a ready source of nutrition.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after the}} main march to Mount Hope began, on 1 January 1916, {{the failure of}} a Primus stove led to three men (Cope, Jack and Gaze) {{returning}} to Cape Evans, where they joined Stevens. The scientist had remained at the base to take weather measurements <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> <b>for</b> the ship. The remaining six sledged south, with Spencer-Smith failing rapidly and Mackintosh complaining of a painful knee. [...] They battled on, laying the depots, using only minimum provisions themselves although, at Joyce's insistence, keeping the dogs well-fed: [...] "The dogs are our only hope; our lives depend on them." [...] As they neared Mount Hope, Spencer-Smith collapsed, unable to proceed. The others left him alone in a small tent and travelled the remaining few miles to lay the final depot at Mount Hope on 26 January 1916. [...] Ernest Wild left a letter for his brother Frank who he assumed was by then travelling across from the Weddell Sea with Shackleton.|$|E

2500|$|In 1948 much of Berlin {{was still}} ruined after World War II, {{and the city}} was divided into four {{occupation}} zones, controlled by the USSR, France, the UK and the United States.

[...] An American officer suggested a concert in the Gendarmenmarkt (in the Soviet zone at the time), and the French zone commander supported the suggestion. [...] The musicians were to be provided by the USSR, and the Alexandrov Ensemble was chosen. A temporary stage was set up in the square, with flowers all along the front.
