Shots from Cumberland, Congress, and Union troops ashore had riddled her smokestack, reducing her already low speed. Two of her guns were disabled and several armor plates had been loosened. Two of her crew were killed, and more were wounded. One of the wounded was Captain Buchanan, whose left thigh was pierced by a rifle shot.|$|E
5|$|After {{the recent}} Polish Campaign, the German Army staff {{analysis}} had been rigorous in its analysis of that battle. The Army's General Staff had assessed {{the problems of}} leadership, tactics, command and control to improve effectiveness. It appears that Schumacher's fighter units did not {{do the same and}} were too busy congratulating themselves on their success. There is little evidence that the Luftwaffe took <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Army's approach in Poland, following their own victory at Heligoland Bight. The historian for the Luftwaffes General Staff noted it was only exploited for propaganda, despite the operational problems and warnings the battle had flagged for attacker and defender.|$|E
5|$|Most {{importantly}} the operas themselves {{are now beginning}} to be revived and recorded, although despite the efforts of such champions as Dame Joan Sutherland, who took part in performances of, and recorded, Les Huguenots, they have yet to achieve <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> huge popular following they attracted during their creator's lifetime. Recordings are now available of all the operas from Il crociato onwards, for many of the earlier Italian operas, and for other pieces including his songs and the incidental music for Struensee.|$|E

5|$|This led to {{proposals}} {{for a new}} radar dedicated solely to the early warning role, determining only which MAR or SCD would ultimately {{have to deal with}} the threat. Used primarily in the first minutes of the attack, and not responsible for the engagements, the system could be considered disposable and did not need <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> sophistication or hardening of the MAR. This led to the Perimeter Acquisition Radar (PAR), which would operate cheaper electronics at VHF frequencies.|$|E
25|$|Production of such {{materials}} at industrial scale {{had to be}} solved for nuclear power generation and weapons production to be accomplished. Up to 1940, {{the total amount of}} uranium metal produced in the USA was not more than a few grams, and even this was of doubtful purity; of metallic beryllium not more than a few kilograms; and concentrated deuterium oxide (heavy water) not more than a few kilograms. Finally, carbon had never been produced in quantity with <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> purity required of a moderator.|$|E

25|$|In {{many places}} {{throughout}} the Hebrew Scriptures – particularly the Book of Hosea – Israel is figured as Yahweh's wife or bride. Malachi's discussion of divorce {{may also be}} understood to conform to this metaphor. Malachi {{could very well be}} urging his audience not to break faith with Yahweh (the God of Israel) by adopting new gods or idols. It is quite likely that, since the people of Judah were questioning Yahweh's love and justice (1:2, 2:17), they might be tempted to adopt foreign gods. William LaSor suggests that, because the restoration to the land of Judah had not resulted in <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> prophesied splendor of the messianic age which had been prophesied, the people were becoming quite disillusioned with their religion.|$|E
25|$|The Union-Garratt did {{not enjoy}} {{the success of the}} {{standard}} Garratt. It was soon evident that mechanical stokers could function perfectly across the connection between a Garratt's boiler and engine unit, making the rationale for the Union-Garratt obsolete. The Union-Garratts' extended boiler frames and the position of the bunker and hind water tank upon those frames meant that they suffered from many of the problems which beset the Mallet design; the SAR U and GH classes had much heavier axle-loadings than Garratts of comparable size, weight and power, and the movement of water at the extreme ends of the long main frames generated high wear on the hind pivot between the boiler and engine unit. The Union-Garratt, like the Golwe and Modified Fairlie, was not perpetuated on <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> scale of the Garratt, and no known examples survive.|$|E
25|$|In a {{surprise}} move, the lame duck zoning commission reversed course in late November 1974 and approved the proposed revised zoning {{rules for the}} Georgetown waterfront. The Washington Post reported that the rezoning process would have to begin again under the home-rule zoning commission, and there was little chance that the new commission {{would be able to}} approve <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> proposed regulations. The existing zoning commission acted, the newspaper suggested, because it would suffer no political retaliation (having gone out of business), its actions could give the home-rule zoning commission political cover to retain the rules, and because its members believed there had been enough delay and consideration of the rules. Development, the old commission felt, had to proceed now or it never would. The GCA immediately sued to have the new zoning regulations overturned, and the D.C. Superior Court blocked all development in the area while the suit was pending.|$|E

25|$|The Prairie provinces, due {{to their}} western cowboy and agrarian nature, are the true heartland of Canadian country music. While the Prairies never {{developed}} a traditional music culture <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Maritimes, the folk music of the Prairies often reflected the cultural origins of the settlers, who were a mix of Scottish, Ukrainian, German and others. For these reasons polkas and Western music were always popular in the region, and {{with the introduction of}} the radio, mainstream country music flourished. As the culture of the region is western and frontier in nature, the specific genre of country and western is more popular today in the Prairies than in any other part of the country. No other area of the country embraces all aspects of the culture, from two-step dancing, to the cowboy dress, to rodeos, to the music itself, like the Prairies do. The Atlantic Provinces, on the other hand, produce far more traditional musicians, but they are not usually specifically country in nature, usually bordering more on the folk or Celtic genres.|$|E
25|$|Although {{credit cards}} reached very high {{adoption}} {{levels in the}} US, Canada and the UK during the latter 20th century, many cultures were more cash-oriented or developed alternative forms of cashless payments, such as Carte bleue or the Eurocard (Germany, France, Switzerland, and others). In these places, adoption of credit cards was initially much slower. Due to strict regulations regarding bank overdrafts, some countries, France in particular, were much quicker to develop and adopt chip-based credit cards which are seen as major anti-fraud credit devices. Debit cards and online banking (using either ATMs or PCs) are used more widely than credit cards in some countries. It took until the 1990s to reach <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> percentage market penetration levels achieved in the US, Canada, and UK. In some countries, acceptance still remains low {{as the use of}} a credit card system depends on the banking system of each country; while in others, a country sometimes had to develop its own credit card network, e.g. UK's Barclaycard and Australia's Bankcard. Japan remains a very cash-oriented society, with credit card adoption being limited mainly to the largest of merchants; although stored value cards (such as telephone cards) are used as alternative currencies, the trend is toward RFID-based systems inside cards, cellphones, and other objects.|$|E
500|$|In {{the days}} {{immediately}} after World War I, Piłsudski attempted {{to build a}} government in a shattered country. Much of former Russian Poland had been destroyed in the war, and systematic looting by the Germans had reduced the region's wealth by at least 10%. A British diplomat who visited Warsaw in January 1919 reported: [...] "I have nowhere seen <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> evidences of extreme poverty and wretchedness that meet one's eye at almost every turn".|$|E

500|$|Religion was the {{one area}} of public life in which women could {{participate}} freely; according to Christopher Carey, it was the [...] "only area of Greek life {{in which a woman}} could approach <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> influence of a man". Women's religious activities, including responsibility for mourning at funerals and involvement in female and mixed-sex cult activity, were an indispensable part of Athenian society. [...] Both Athenian and non-Athenian women participated in public religious activities. [...] The state-controlled Eleusinian mysteries, for instance, were open to all Greek speaking people, men and women, free and unfree alike.|$|E
500|$|Baird and Jackie later {{met their}} half-sister, Victoria/Ingrid, {{when they were}} present at the {{ceremony}} to place a Blue Heritage plaque on Mimi's house to commemorate the fact that Lennon had lived there.

It was his first in the County Championship since 2012, and was followed on 22 May with a second hundred, against Durham at Taunton. This century came 618 days after the last time he scored a hundred at his home ground. He passed 1,000 runs for the season on 25 September against Yorkshire, in the final game of the year's County Championship.|$|E
500|$|The {{first task}} facing the Americans was the {{adoption}} of an entirely new set of signals, radio codes, and cipher methods. Although the Americans had studied the general British code while crossing the Atlantic, it was some time before they could use it with <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> proficiency of other ships in the Grand Fleet. To help in the transition, signalmen and radio operators from the Royal Navy were posted to the American battleships to aid their U.S. Navy counterparts. Though learning an entirely new system of signals was, as Admiral Rodman put it, [...] "almost the same as if in reading we had substituted {{a new set of}} letters," [...] within three days of their arrival, the ships of Battleship Division Nine were able to take part in fleet maneuvers in the North Sea with no apparent difficulty.|$|E
500|$|In 1746, a {{group of}} {{publishers}} approached Johnson with an idea about creating an authoritative dictionary of the English language. A contract with William Strahan and associates, worth 1,500 guineas, was signed {{on the morning of}} 18 June 1746. Johnson claimed that he could finish the project in three years. In comparison, the Académie Française had forty scholars spending forty years to complete their dictionary, which prompted Johnson to claim, [...] "This is the proportion. Let me see; forty times forty is sixteen hundred. As three to sixteen hundred, so is the proportion of an Englishman to a Frenchman." [...] Although he did not succeed in completing the work in three years, he did manage to finish it in eight. Some criticised the dictionary, including Thomas Babington Macaulay, who described Johnson as [...] "a wretched etymologist," [...] but according to Bate, the Dictionary [...] "easily ranks {{as one of the greatest}} single achievements of scholarship, and probably the greatest ever performed by one individual who laboured under <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> disadvantages in a comparable length of time." ...|$|E
