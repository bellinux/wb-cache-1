5000|$|Rodger's {{method is}} a {{procedure}} for examining research data post hoc following an 'omnibus' analysis, that is after carrying out <b>an</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>variance</b> (ANOVA). Rodger's method utilizes a decision-based error rate, {{arguing that it}} is not the probability (...) of rejecting [...] in error that should be controlled, rather it is the average rate of rejecting true null contrasts that should be controlled. Meaning we should control the expected rate (...) of true null contrast rejection.|$|E

50|$|A {{regression}} analyses {{the relationship between}} dependent variables (response) and independent variables (factors, predictors). The linear regression provided in Cornerstone is the main tool of statistical analysis and uses quantitative and qualitative predictors. An evaluation of qualitative predictors is often done by <b>an</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>variance</b> instead of a regression. The term “linear” relates {{to the power of}} the regression coefficients not the predictors. We describe the order of a regression model as the highest power of a predictor. Cornerstone is capable to fit models of arbitrary order.|$|E
50|$|This {{technique}} {{was developed by}} Ronald Fisher in 1935 and is used most commonly after a null hypothesis in <b>an</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>variance</b> (ANOVA) test is rejected (assuming normality and homogeneity of variances). A significant ANOVA test only reveals that not all the means compared in the test are equal. Fisher's LSD is basically a set of individual t-tests, differentiated only in the calculation of the standard deviation. In each t-test, a pooled standard deviation is computed from only the two groups being compared, while the Fisher's LSD test computes the pooled standard deviation from all groups - thus increasing power. Fisher's LSD does not correct for multiple comparisons.|$|E
50|$|Relative to a {{factorial}} design, under <b>an</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>variance,</b> a {{main effect}} test will test the hypotheses expected such as H0, the null hypothesis. Running a hypothesis for {{a main effect}} will test whether {{there is evidence of}} an effect of different treatments. However a main effect test is nonspecific and will not allow for a localization of specific mean pairwise comparisons (simple effects). A main effect test will merely look at whether overall there is something about a particular factor that is making a difference. In other words a test examining differences amongst the levels of a single factor (averaging over the other factor and/or factors). Main effects are essentially the overall effect of a factor.|$|E
