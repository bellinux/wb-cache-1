Let us start with observing an expert at work. Her domain of expertise is a welldefined part of the world. She may be a physician examining a patient, {{she may be a}} banker questioning an <b>applicant</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>loan,</b> or she may be a pilot monitoring the aircraft. A simple view of the tasks of the expert is the triangle in Figure 1. First of all she observes her part of the world to establish the state of it. What is the state of the world? What can I learn from that? Which intervention? Figure 1 : The task-triangle of an expert. Based on her interpretation {{of the state of the}} world, the expert decides on an action. For any action the expert has some expectations. Sometimes they come true and sometimes they do not; but in any case she will learn from the results of the actions. This may help her when inter [...] ...|$|E

Paper discusses several versions of the multilevel scorecards which includes random-intercept, random-coefficients and group-level variables. The primary benefit of the multilevel scorecard compared to a conventional scoring model is a higher accuracy of the model predictions. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{introduces a}} new type of credit scoring model which assesses credit worthiness of <b>applicants</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>loan</b> by forecasting their probability of default. The multilevel scorecard is an improved alternative to the conventional scoring techniques which are regularly applied in retail banking such as discriminant analysis, decision trees and logistic regression scorecards. In addition, this thesis proposes a new way of data clustering <b>for</b> <b>a</b> multilevel structure which is more intuitive and relevant for efficient credit worthiness assessment. The motivation for the topic and the core idea of this research project are closely related to the main advantages of improved credit scoring and its application to the decisionmaking process in retail banking. The main advantages are accuracy gain and cost-saving. Improving credit scoring techniques helps to increase operating efficiency by increasing predictive quality and reducing misclassification errors. From the cost-saving prospective, it also leads to profit growth and gives a higher return on capital. In credit scoring the main goal is to define factors which influence riskiness of individuals who apply <b>for</b> <b>a</b> bank <b>loan.</b> Accordingly, the thesis develops two types of multilevel structures which allow including random-effects at the higher-level of the hierarchy. The first structure nests <b>applicants</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>loan</b> within second-level groups, microenvironments. Each microenvironment determines the living area of a borrower with a particular combination of socio-economic and demographic conditions. Microenvironment-specific effects impact the riskiness of borrowers additionally to the observed personal characteristics. The second type of multilevel structure extends the first. It cross-classifies individuals with different classifications according to similarities in particular characteristics of their occupational activities, living area condition and infrastructure of shopping facilities in their residence areas...|$|R
