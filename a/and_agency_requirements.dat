The work reported here is based on the development of a multi-agent application, an audio video entertainment broadcasting (AVEB) system. This has resulted in determining advantages and limitations of using the FIPA standards to build complex Multi-agent Software Systems. The development and testing of the AVEB application are part of an EU project called FACTS (acts AC 317). A main result of using FIPA has been the identification of the usefulness and power of its protocols. The reason for the importance of the protocols in developing multi-agent systems (MAS) is it provides a degree of expressing cooperation within MAS architecture. As the protocols stand currently they are not sufficient to capture a complete explicit model of the cooperative requirements in multi-agent systems. However, they provide a basis from which to start. We examine this feature of FIPA further in order to evaluate its role as a bridge between the mental <b>agency</b> <b>and</b> social <b>agency</b> <b>requirements</b> in the development of cooperation in mult-agent systems...|$|R
40|$|Is it {{possible}} for service organizations formed from protest movements to maintain their radical commitments, even when they partner with state agencies? Engaging with the social movements, civic engagement, and nonprofit sector literatures, I focus on the American prostitutes’ rights movement and the emergence from it of the California Prevention and Education Project (CAL-PEP) and the St James Infirmary (SJI) in the San Francisco Bay Area. As flagship nonprofit health service organizations, the SJI and CAL-PEP illustrate how a social movement’s radical impulses and claims-making capacities are both maintained and restricted when they are institutionalized into service provision organizations that seek to work with state agencies {{in an era of}} neoliberal politics. Based on participant-observational, interview-based and archival research, I contend that CAL-PEP and the SJI express their radical impulses within their organizations by maintaining prostitution as a legitimate occupational choice and involving sex workers in service provision and management. Granting agreements encouraging local, community-based health service provision and an emphasis on professional, credentialed service provision permit this expression of their radical impulses, even as charitable nonprofit tax status <b>and</b> granting <b>agency</b> <b>requirements</b> for data collection constrain their capacities to advocate for sex workers' rights beyond their organizations...|$|R

This paper represents the Proceedings of a session held at SciDataCon 2016 (Denver, 12 – 13 September 2016). It explores the way a range of disciplines, namely materials science, crystallography, astronomy, earth sciences, humanities and linguistics, get organized at the international level to address those challenges. The disciplinary culture with respect to data sharing, science drivers, organization, lessons learnt and the elements of the data infrastructure which are or could be shared with others are briefly described.

40|$|The thesis {{engages with}} recent debates {{surrounding}} {{the relationship between}} culture, ideology and politics in Venice under Italian Fascism. It aims to establish if the Fascist project for the 'nationalization of the masses' through culture was successfully promoted in Venice, or whether local economic interests were afforded a higher priority by the town authorities. It argues that local elites were not primarily concerned with the endorsement of Fascist ideology through cultural politics but considered exhibitions, plays, concerts and festivals to be the route to boosting economic growth {{through the development of}} the tourist industry. The thesis examines {{the ways in which the}} Venetian municipality was able to work with the Fascist regime, co-operating with national political directives provided these did not contradict the primary objective of restructuring and reviving the Venetian economy. Cultural policies in Venice were thus less a vehicle for Fascist ideology than a pragmatic means of injecting new life into the flagging post-war economy through the development of new forms of 'cultural tourism'. Festivals, exhibitions and traditional events were placed at the service not of the Fascist programme of mass cultural mobilisation, but of local business and political elites whose interests ultimately depended upon the revitalization of commercial tourism and the economic and social rejuvenation of the Veneto region. The familiar image of a 'totalitarian' state penetrating deep into all aspects of society is in need of serious qualification and a more realistic interpretation of Fascism in Venice must take account of the complex and sometimes ambiguous relationship between the national interest, as constructed by ideologically-driven Fascist organs <b>and</b> <b>agencies,</b> <b>and</b> the <b>requirements</b> of institutions and elites at the local level...|$|R

The agencies also rely on professional norms to safeguard against duplication, such as the peer review process used by scientific journals to limit the publication of unnecessarily duplicative research. Indeed, <b>agency</b> officials <b>and</b> stakeholders could not provide recent examples of duplication within or between the two <b>agencies,</b> <b>and</b> GAO's review of 20 randomly selected research projects did not identify duplicative projects. Nevertheless, GAO identified a few shortcomings that somewhat limit the utility of certain agency safeguards. First, information in CRIS about ARS projects was typically at least 6 months out-of-date when uploaded, which undermines CRIS's utility as a safeguard. ARS officials said that the agency now expects staff to provide ARS project information on a quarterly basis, but ARS has not issued guidance about this expectation. Second, NIFA directs staff to conduct a CRIS duplication check for projects that accounted for about two-thirds of the funding it awarded for competitive grants; as a result, about one-third of its competitive grants are not subject to this safeguard against duplication. NIFA recently convened a task force to study, among other issues, whether the directive to check CRIS should be extended to all competitive grants. ...|$|R

40|$|It is {{now widely}} {{recognized}} that the traditional published article is insufficient to permit verification of computational results. The emergence of powerful computational hardware combined with vast data collection and storage capabilities presents many novel opportunities for researchers. Unfortunately the standards for communication of published computational findings have evolved in ways that make verification and validation next to impossible and impede the ability of others to build on past research [1 - 3]. A movement toward reproducible research – dissemination that includes sufficient experimental details such that results can be replicated by others in the field, i. e. the code and the data – has developed in many disciplines and research areas to address this shortcoming in research [9].

40|$|Purpose of review: The {{evaluation}} of new treatments in brain cancer should address outcomes such as functional status, symptoms, cognition and health-related {{quality of life}} (HRQOL), yet these are infrequently evaluated. This review focuses on instruments for measuring HRQOL in brain tumour patients and the recent developments in the field. Recent findings: HRQOL is now well accepted as a trial endpoint by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency. Efforts to standardize HRQOL use in clinical trials are ongoing. Existing disease-specific instruments for brain tumour patients (e. g. EORTC BN- 20, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Brain) appear to meet US Food and Drug Administration <b>and</b> European Medicines <b>Agency</b> <b>requirements</b> sufficiently. The EORTC BN- 20 has recently completed the final validation process. The psychometric properties of single-item linear analogue scale assessments for patients with newly diagnosed high-grade gliomas were investigated. Nevertheless, only a few brain tumour trial results published {{over the last year}} reported on patients' HRQOL data or symptoms. The prognostic significance of HRQOL is debated as to whether it may have additional value over other well known prognostic factors. Summary: With an increase in treatment options for brain tumours and also the risk of long-term neurotoxicity, more detailed reporting of patients' HRQOL and symptoms is essential. The use of HRQOL evaluations in brain tumour trials should be strongly encouraged by the clinical and academic community. © 2008 Wolters Kluwer Health Lippincott Williams & Wilkins...|$|R

Expressing concerns about USPTO's plans for the future, Congress directed USPTO to develop a 5 -year plan. In February 2001, USPTO issued its first 5 -year plan, called the USPTO Business Plan. Because the Director of USPTO {{did not believe that}} the Business Plan went far enough, in June 2002, USPTO produced another 5 -year plan, called the 21 st Century Strategic Plan. GAO found that patent activity grew substantially from 1990 through 2001. The numbers of patent applications filed and patents granted nearly doubled; the inventory of patent applications nearly tripled; patent pendency increased from slightly over 18 months to nearly 25 months, and the number of patent examiners increased by about 80 percent. Furthermore, in fiscal year 2001, both fee collections <b>and</b> <b>agency</b> funding <b>requirements</b> exceeded $ 1 billion {{for the first time in}} the agency's history. Although both 5 -year plans cover the same period, the assumptions and projected results of the Business Plan are different in several ways from the Strategic Plan.
