25|$|The {{composition}} of the opposing armies explains {{a lot about the}} outcome of the ensuing conflict. The Tibetan soldiers were almost all rapidly impressed peasants, who lacked organisation, discipline, training and motivation. Only a handful of their most devoted units, comprising monks armed usually with swords and jingals, proved to be effective, but they were in such small numbers as to be unable to reverse the tide of battle. This problem was exacerbated by their generals, who seemed in <b>awe</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British and refused to make any aggressive moves against the small and often dispersed column. They also failed conspicuously to properly defend their natural barriers, frequently offering battle in relatively open ground, where Maxim guns and rifle volleys caused great numbers of casualties.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the poor}} reviews given by European {{observers}} to the European-trained Divisions, the Muslim Divisions of the National Revolutionary Army, trained in China (not by westerners) {{and led by}} Ma Clique Muslim generals, frightened the European observers with their appearance and fighting skills in battle. Europeans like Sven Hedin and Georg Vasel were in <b>awe</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> appearance Chinese Muslim NRA divisions made and their ferocious combat abilities. They were trained in harsh, brutal conditions. The 36th Division (National Revolutionary Army), trained entirely in China without any European help, was composed of Chinese Muslims and fought and severely mauled an invading Soviet Russian army during the Soviet Invasion of Xinjiang. The division was lacking in technology and manpower, but badly damanged the superior Russian force.|$|E

25|$|Another {{important}} {{group were}} the Icaiche Maya, who dominated {{the jungles of}} the lower center of the peninsula. In the 1860s under their leader Marcus Canul, they had battled against the Mexicans, the Cruzob, and had also raided British Honduras. Marcus Canul and the Icaiche Maya defeated a detachment of British troops in December 21, 1866 the battle {{is known as the}} Battle of San Pedro Yalbac. In 1867 the British mounted a retaliatory raid, including in their weaponry incendiary rockets that set the houses of Icaiche on fire from a good distance away, to the <b>awe</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> local residents. The Maya briefly took Corozal town in 1870 and their last major attack was in September 1, 1872 when Canul was mortally wounded. The new Icaiche leaders promised respect and friendship with the British. They soon made an agreement with the Mexican central government {{similar to that of the}} Ixcanha. Years after the Belize Estate and Produce Company (BEC) began a series of campaigns to forcibly remove Maya from the Yalbac area.|$|E
25|$|In {{accordance}} with {{his role as}} founder of the Levites, Levi {{is referred to as}} being particularly pious. The Blessing of Moses, which some textual scholars attribute to a period just before the deuteronomist, speaks about Levi via an allegorical comparison to Moses himself, which hagaddah take to support the characterisation of Levi (and his progeny) as being by far the greatest of his brothers in respect to piety. The apocryphal Prayer of Asenath, which textual scholars believe dates from some time after the first century AD (scholarship in regards to the dating is currently quite contentious, with dates ranging from near the first century, to the fourth or fifth centuries), describes Levi as a prophet and saint, able to forecast the future, understand heavenly writings (astrology? weather trends?), and someone who admonishes the people to be forgiving, as well as in awe of God. The Book of Malachi argues that the Levites were chosen by Yahweh to be the priests, because Levi as minister of God, was specified only the true religious regulations, was reverent, revered Yahweh, was in <b>awe</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> God's name, upheld peace, was a model of good morality, and turned many people from sin.|$|E

500|$|Among {{the scripts}} {{submitted}} by freelance or aspiring writers was one by Trent Christopher Ganino. Ganino's speculative script, {{submitted to the}} office of pre-production associate Eric A. Stillwell in April 1989, was titled [...] "Yesterday's Enterprise". The story involved the Enterprise-D's response to a crisis in the Golecian sector and an encounter with Enterprise-C, which had been destroyed 18years earlier. The crew of the Enterprise-C is in <b>awe</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> newer ship's technology, and Picard is confronted with whether to reveal to his guests their ultimate fate. An Enterprise-C ensign accidentally discovers the fate of his vessel and panics, requiring Worf and Riker to capture him after he attempts to escape.

The ensign goes back to his ship, which returns to the past and its certain destruction.|$|E
500|$|Sholay was {{the first}} Indian film to have a {{stereophonic}} soundtrack {{and to use the}} 70mm widescreen format. However, since actual 70mm cameras were expensive at the time, the film was shot on traditional 35mm film and the 4:3 picture was subsequently converted to a 2.2:1 frame. Regarding the process, Sippy said, [...] "A 70mm [...] format takes the <b>awe</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> big screen and magnifies it even more to make the picture even bigger, but since I also wanted a spread of sound we used six-track stereophonic sound and combined it with the big screen. It was definitely a differentiator." [...] The use of 70mm was emphasised by film posters on which the name of the film was stylised to match the CinemaScope logo. Film posters also sought to differentiate the film from those which had come before; one of them added the tagline: [...] "The greatest star cast ever assembled– the greatest story ever told".|$|E
500|$|General George Washington, {{commander}} in chief of the Continental Army, came to Philadelphia to brief Congress on military affairs.

[...] Washington was impressed by the young man's enthusiasm and was inclined to think well of a fellow Mason; Lafayette was simply in <b>awe</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> commanding general. General Washington took the Frenchman to view his military camp; when Washington expressed embarrassment at its state and that of the troops, Lafayette responded, [...] "I am here to learn, not to teach." [...] He became a member of Washington's staff, although confusion existed regarding his status. Congress regarded his commission as honorary, while he considered himself a full-fledged commander who would be given control of a division when Washington deemed him prepared. Washington told Lafayette that a division would not be possible as he was of foreign birth, but that he would be happy to hold him in confidence as [...] "friend and father".|$|E

500|$|In Game 5 of the series, Pittsburgh faced {{elimination}} in Detroit, {{where they}} had not yet won in the series. Down 3–2 with 35seconds remaining in regulation, Talbot scored for the Penguins, who had removed goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury to gain an extra skater. The goal tied the game at three, forcing it into sudden-death overtime. In the third overtime period, Sykora scored at the 109:21 mark of the game to give the Penguins the victory and force Game 6. Sykora's goal was assisted by Malkin, who had struggled in the series, and Gonchar, who was returning for his first shift in 50 minutes due to an injury. In the fifth-longest Stanley Cup game in history, goaltender Fleury stopped 55 shots, with 24 in overtime. Ryan Malone played in Game 6, despite being hit {{in the face with}} the puck in Game 5.

Some of the sets were designed {{so that they could}} be submerged, while others were built on sound stages with fishtanks used as windows. At Fox Baja Studios, the cast worked with sharks that were either animatronic or computer generated. As the shark used in Jaws was 25 feet long, Harlin decided to increase their animatronic shark to 26 feet. Jackson recalled, [...] "When they first brought it into the lab we were all in <b>awe</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> size of this machine [...] It was a real monster. I would walk up to it slowly and touch it and they said it felt like a real shark. The gills moved and it had {{a mind of its own}} sometimes."

500|$|The move {{paid off}} as Phil Esposito scored for Canada after just 30 seconds of play, {{knocking}} a puck {{out of the}} air behind the Soviets' goaltender Vladislav Tretiak. But even after a few minutes, Sinden felt the Soviets were coming on and having no difficulty getting through Canada's defence. Henderson scored after six minutes to give Canada a two-goal lead on a face-off win by Clarke, the only advantage that Team Canada had, in Sinden's estimation. To Canadian spectators and the media, the second goal gave the appearance that the pre-series predictions of a rout had been proven correct. But the Soviets got over any <b>awe</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> NHLers and scored two goals to tie the score {{before the end of the}} first period. Yevgeni Zimin scored on a pass from behind the net, and Vladimir Petrov scored a short-handed goal on a Soviet two-on-one break, with Petrov potting the rebound. According to Sinden, the Canadian players had lost their poise, [...] "running all over the ice" [...] to establish their hitting game, while the Soviets used an unexpected tactic, that of the long pass, to break a man out of their defensive zone. The Canadian defence was also dropping to the ice to block shots, while the Soviets only skated around the defence to get a good shot. Although Tretiak had given up the two Canada goals on the first two shots, he recovered later in the period to make a couple of critical saves off Esposito at point-blank range.
