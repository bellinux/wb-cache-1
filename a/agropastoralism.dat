50|$|According to the {{research}} conducted by J. Maruyama, {{there are two main}} things that have been changed due to the 1997 resettlement program. First, although the residents’ access to social and economic welfare program improved, their access to natural resources declined significantly. Consequently, people were forced to shift their principal means of livelihood from hunting and gathering to wage labor and <b>agropastoralism.</b> Second, San families ceased to form the camps that had functioned as a production-consumption unit. Furthermore, the residential mobility decreased; they were no longer allowed to move anywhere they liked, as was the custom.|$|E
50|$|The most {{important}} livelihoods are livestock farming and some arable farming (<b>agropastoralism).</b> 75-85% {{of the population}} - especially the Issa are cattle breeders, mainly sheep and cattle, in less productive areas camels and goats. Even households which do not have camel herds, at least keep a camel as a beast of burden. In the dry season, sheep and dairy-producing animals remain near the villages, while camels, cattle and goats are kept in other pastoral areas. The cattle breeders mainly feed on the milk and ghee produced therefrom, they also sell cattle and mainly buy sorghum and sugar.|$|E
50|$|Sometime in {{the late}} 18th century, the Fulɓe in Fouta Djallonke {{developed}} a type of biointensive agriculture, probably out of necessity, since the conquered indigenous women were taken into the households of their Islamic overlords whose livestock became their responsibility. Combining animal husbandry and sedentary agriculture into an efficient system of <b>agropastoralism</b> required {{a new way of}} organizing daily life. Livestock, which included horses and cattle, ate more and produced more waste than what the indigenous farmers were accustomed. Since the livestock had to be protected from wildlife at night, they were brought into the family compound, referred to by the French as a tapade, and locally as cuntuuje (sing. suntuure) in the Pular language.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of Issa, now live as agropastoralists. They cultivate sorghum and maize {{in the south}} of the zone, in the hilly area {{at the foot of the}} highlands, and mainly keep cattle. A total of 15-25% of the inhabitants of the Sitti zone are agropastoralists. This way of life has already entered the Dembel since about 1965. In other areas, cattle breeders started to cultivate agriculture, especially in the early 1990s. They were able to reduce their cattle herds and adapt themselves to the recurring droughts. The transition to <b>Agropastoralism</b> was also promoted by the Ethiopian government. In addition, the Somali wanted to catch up with Oromo peasants from the highlands, who increasingly went to the lowland to cultivate the Somalis land claimed there.|$|E

By analysing a rural municipality where <b>agropastoralism</b> and mining co-exist, we explore the impacts of artisanal mining activities on community-based pasture management and territorial resilience. Our key findings show that mining income is capitalised {{in the form of}} livestock, and that the mechanisms for animal herding by agropastoralists who are not involved in mining activities and who live on the periphery and have little access to formal decision-making processes are at risk of further marginalisation. Furthermore, the lack of mechanisms for collecting and analysing data {{on the state of the}} natural resources necessary for <b>agropastoralism,</b> such as water and pastures, poses a risk to community-based pasture management. Finally, interactions within the system and between the system and external components are a transversal issue for the maintenance of community-based management. Thus, the co-existence of high income–generating activities and traditional activities such as <b>agropastoralism</b> does not limit community-based management and can even be a lever for a dynamic process that helps to support the creation of management rules...|$|E

Sward biomass for optimal energy intake by cattle was derived using intake-digestibility constraint curves and realised livestock productivity from the systems compared. Cattle and sheep, and goats primarily consumed herbaceous and woody plants, respectively. Enteropogon macrostachyus and Panicum maximum, E. macrostachyus and Blepharis integrifolia, and Combretum exalatum and Duosperma kilimandscharica accounted for 33. 5 % and 9. 9 %, 16. 6 % and 10. 3 %, and 11. 7 % and 10. 7 % of cattle, sheep and goats' total energy intake, respectively. Cattle optimised energy intake at 370 - 610 gm− 2 of sward biomass and 55. 5 - 64. 3 % organic matter digestibility. Panicum maximum yielded the highest optimal sward biomass. The energy expenditure of the animals was generally lower under <b>agropastoralism</b> across seasons. During the dry season, more animals (33 - 50 %) lost weight under ranching. <b>Agropastoralism</b> was an efficient system as animals were moved across quality grazing microenvironments that minimised feeding costs and enhanced energy intake. Therefore, mobile grazing strategies, plant diversity and complementary trophic interactions stabilise energy extraction patterns and enhance livestock productivity under <b>agropastoralism.</b> However, human activities that affect plant diversity and mobility will undermine sustainable livestock production in such environments...|$|E

40|$|Enset is an {{essential}} plant for the Ethiopian Sidama system of <b>agropastoralism.</b> Sidama <b>agropastoralism</b> and the folk taxonomy of enset is presented here in ethnographic context. One of several societies of Ethiopia’s enset complex, the highland Sidama {{are among the most}} wholly reliant on enset and maintain more enset varieties in their gardens than other groups. Sidama agro-pastoral systems revolve around human-enset-cattle interaction: Sidama eat low-protein parts of enset; cattle eat high-protein parts of enset; Sidama get protein from dairy; Sidama fertilize enset with cattle manure. In the Sidama language, enset offers an example of Hunn’s generic elevation within the framework of Berlinian perceptual-taxonomic theory. Weesho (enset) may serve both as a folk generic taxon and a life-form taxon depending on the frame of reference. Such expansion allows for an intermediate taxa translating to “male” or “female” ensets, followed by generic and specific taxa for kinds or “breeds” of enset.

40|$|Farming and herding were {{introduced}} to Europe from the Near East and Anatolia; there are, however, considerable arguments about the mechanisms of this transition. Were it people who moved and outplaced the indigenous hunter- gatherer groups or admixed with them? Or was it just material and information that moved-the Neolithic Package-consisting of domesticated plants and animals and the knowledge of its use? The latter process is {{commonly referred to as}} cultural diffusion and the former as demic diffusion. Despite continuous and partly combined efforts by archaeologists, anthropologists, linguists, paleontologists and geneticists a final resolution of the debate has not yet been reached. In the present contribution we interpret results from the Global Land Use and technological Evolution Simulator (GLUES), a mathematical model for regional sociocultural development embedded in the western Eurasian geoenvironmental context during the Holocene. We demonstrate that the model is able to realistically hindcast the expansion speed and the inhomogeneous space-time evolution of the transition to <b>agropastoralism</b> in Europe. GLUES, in contrast to models that do not resolve endogenous sociocultural dynamics, also describes and explains how and why the Neolithic advanced in stages. In the model analysis, we uncouple the mechanisms of migration and information exchange. We find that (1) an indigenous form of <b>agropastoralism</b> could well have arisen in certain Mediterranean landscapes, but not in Northern and Central Europe, where it depended on imported technology and material, (2) both demic diffusion by migration or cultural diffusion by trade may explain the western European transition equally well, (3) [ [...] . ]Comment: Accepted Author Manuscript version accepted for publication in Journal of Archaeological Science.

30|$|The {{situation}} of pastoral settlements in 2010 to 2011 in the Ferlo area could {{be characterized by}} the specialization in livestock activities and not in crops: the comprehensive survey reports that only 28 % were agropastoralists. This is a peculiar situation compared with other pastoral areas of West Africa (Grégoire and Raynaut 1997), where <b>agropastoralism</b> is more developed. The colonial policy of installing pastoral boreholes beginning in the 1950 s was favourable for livestock activities in Ferlo and, until now, has reinforced this pastoral specialization (Thébaud 1990). The small size of families in the settlements, with a majority (60 %) of settlements having {{only one or two}} households and 90 % having a maximum of four households, is another remarkable finding. This is consistent with the general socioeconomic evolution in rural areas of West Africa, with the growing individualization of households replacing more complex family structures (Becker 1990; Chia et al. 2006), and with increased population density that has consequences on fragmentation of herds and of settlements.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Currently, {{there is}} {{considerable}} controversy over {{the degree to which}} traditional societies degrade the environment. In Africa and the Himalayas, especially, more and more scholars are arguing that degradation has been greatly overstated. In contrast, most scholars still believe that massive degradation including deforestation has occurred in the Mediterranean and Near East. I examine the pollen evidence for Near Eastern deforestation, using a data set from 13 sites. The pollen diagrams show an increase in arboreal pollen in the early Holocene, as woody cover returns with the re-establishment of modern climate; but arboreal pollen does not show any tendency to decline subsequently, as <b>agropastoralism</b> and other human impacts increase. That is, there is no clear pollen evidence for deforestation in the Near East. This does not mean that deforestation did not occur, but it does mean that the matter needs re-examination. I suggest some possible reasons for the discrepancy between the pollen record and the widespread belief that extensive deforestation has occurred...|$|E

As a livestock rearer engages in crop production, there is a decreasing rate of subsitution between livestock and crop. This situation derives from the fact that crop production is more intensive than llivestock production which depends principally on grazing natural pastures.

40|$|MASTER OF SCIENCE IN RANGE MANAGEMENT (ECONOMICS OPTION), 2004 The East African {{governments have}} {{initiated}} land reform programmes {{with the objective}} of creating individualisation of land rights where rules of access, use and transfer are reformulated in order to adapt to rising population densities, land scarcity and agricultural commercialisation. This study assessed the effects of land tenure on land use and food security in Loitokitok Division, Kajiado District, Kenya. Purposive sampling was carried out by grouping locations within Loitokitok Division into two: those practising transhumance and the ones practising <b>agropastoralism.</b> Transhumance refers to seasonal movement with livestock for pastures and water while leaving the bulk of the households in permanent settlements. <b>Agropastoralism</b> refers to mixed farming in permanent settlements but sometimes includes transhumance. One location was randomly selected from each of the groupings and systematic sampling was carried out. Samples of 35 transhumant and agropastoral households respectively were then selected for the administration of a questionnaire. Also, village elders, chiefs and extension officers were interviewed, and more data were collected from annual reports and previous research studies. Data were analysed using both descriptives and regressions. Stratification of households showed that land tenure had influence on pastoral household size, herd size, milk yield, income from milk, total income, employment and remittance. In addition, agropastoral households were more food secure with a food poverty incidence of 0. 2 while that of transhumant households was 0. 6. The linear regression model showed that household size, diversification, total income, gender and land tenure had influence on both transhumant and agropastoral household food security at 5 per cent level of significance. Based on the results of this study, it is recommended that the government and other stakeholders create awareness on issues of land tenure by gradually introducing the concept of individualisation of land rights in pastoral areas. Also, for improved income in these areas, there is need to increase the livelihood sources through micro industries such as milk processing plants, and hides and skins. This will provide job <opportunities and ready markets for their products. Further, family planning programmes should be provided to ensure household dependency ratio is reduced.

These trends have adversely affected livestock production and the productive capacity of the Mara ecosystem. Diminishing grazing area occasioned by expanding cropping patterns has negatively impacted on vegetation resources and the biodiversity of the ecosystem.

40|$|In {{the many}} {{transitions}} from foraging to <b>agropastoralism</b> it is debated whether the primary drivers are innovations in technology or increases of population.

Although my model is based on ecological -Neomalthusian- principles, the coevolutionary positive feedback relationship between technology and population results in a seemingly Boserupian response: innovation is greatest when population pressure is highest. This outcome is not only visible in the theory-driven reduced model, but is also present in a corresponding "real world" simulator which was tested against archaeological data, demonstrating the relevance and validity of the coevolutionary model.

40|$|This paper synthesizes {{research}} findings on contemporary mountain pastoralism in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, {{based on a}} longer review characterizing mountain <b>agropastoralism</b> in Central Asia. We focus here on the principal issues that have been emphasized {{over the past two}} decades in policy, programs, and projects regarding pastoralism in Central Asia's mountains.

The paper proposes that new research should critically assess these orthodoxies through more empirical and long-term field research. This will yield practical applications to improve conditions for Central Asian mountain pastoralists and their environment. Pursuing measures for addressing pasture degradation will require determinations of whether, where, how, and why degradation and desertification are occurring.

We find evidence that entheseal changes increased at Tombos from the New Kingdom Period to the postcolonial Third Intermediate/Napatan Periods; however, accidental trauma does not significantly increase between the two periods. With regard to the elevated entheseal changes, we suggest that Nubians may have been engaged in quarrying, <b>agropastoralism,</b> and construction efforts. Furthermore, there is evidence to suggest that this population was biologically resilient, which may have limited accidental/occupational traumatic injury.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that tropical soils (mainly Oxisols) have excellent physical characteristics such as high infiltration rates, high permeability of water, good and stable soil structure and that consequently, they can support mechanized agriculture. However in the Eastern Plains (Llanos Orientales) of Colombia, when Oxisols are subjected to tillage using disc harrow, soil physical conditions deteriorate rapidly. We report here that change in land use with deep-rooted tropical pastures can enhance soil quality by improving the size and stability of soil aggregates when compared with soils under monocropping. In addition, rates of water infiltration improved by 5 - 10 -fold while rainfall acceptance capacity improved by 3 - 5 -fold. We suggest that intensive and sustainable use of these Oxisols, could only be possible if an arable or productive layer (i. e. a layer with improved soil physical, chemical and biological properties) is constructed and maintained.

Less research has been devoted to the emergence of the IVC, which shows continuous cultural precursors since at least the seventh millennium BC. To understand the decline, we believe it is necessary to investigate the rise of the IVC, i. e., the establishment of agriculture and livestock, dense populations and technological developments 7000 - 3000 BC. Although much archaeologically typed information is available, our capability to investigate the system is hindered by poorly resolved chronology, and by a lack of field work in the intermediate areas between the Indus valley and Mesopotamia. We thus employ a complementary numerical simulation to develop a consistent picture of technology, <b>agropastoralism</b> and population developments in the IVC domain. Results from this Global Land Use and technological Evolution Simulator show that there is (1) fair agreement between the simulated timing of the agricultural transition and radiocarbon dates from early agricultural sites, but the transition is simulated first in India then Pakistan; (2) an independent agropas- toralism developing on the Indian subcontinent; and (3) a positive relationship between archeological artifact richness and simulated population density which remains to be quantified...|$|E
40|$|The {{transition}} from {{hunting and gathering}} to plant and animal domestication {{was one of the}} most important cultural and technological revolutions in human history. According to archeologists and paleoanthropologists, this transition triggered major demographic expansions. However, few genetic studies have found traces of Neolithic expansions in the current repartition of genetic polymorphism, pointing rather toward Paleolithic expansions. Here, we used microsatellite autosomal data to investigate the past demographic history of 87 African and Eurasian human populations with contrasted lifestyles (nomadic hunter-gatherers, semi-nomadic herders and sedentary farmers). Likely due to the combination of a higher mutation rate and the possibility to analyze several loci as independent replicates of the coalescent process, the analysis of microsatellite data allowed us to infer more recent expansions than previous genetic studies, potentially resulting from the Neolithic transition. Despite the variability in their location and environment, we found consistent expansions for all sedentary farmers, while we inferred constant population sizes for all hunter-gatherers and most herders that could result from constraints linked to a nomadic or semi-nomadic lifestyle and/or competition for land between herders and farmers. As an exception, we inferred expansions for Central Asian herders. This might be linked with the arid environment of this area that may have been more favorable to nomadic herders than to sedentary farmers. Alternatively, current Central Asian herders may descent from populations who have first experienced a {{transition from}} hunter-gathering to sedentary <b>agropastoralism,</b> and then a second transition to nomadic herding.
