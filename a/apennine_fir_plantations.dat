40|$|Allelopathy of Chinese fir [Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.) Hook. ] {{has been}} {{considered}} an important cause of productivity decline in successive rotations in Chinese <b>fir</b> <b>plantations.</b> Growth of Chinese fir germinants was measured to understand the allelopathic potential of its leaves and roots, {{as well as its}} rhizosphere soil, from different plantation ages. Results show that aqueous extracts from Chinese fir leaves and roots and rhizo-sphere soil significantly inhibited the growth of germinants. Leaf aqueous extracts showed the strongest inhibi-tory effects indicating that allelochemicals were produced by the leaf and released into the soil through the roots. Leaf and the root aqueous extracts, as well as the rhizosphere soil, from older Chinese <b>fir</b> <b>plantations</b> exhibited stronger allelopathic potential. Tissue aqueous extract from a 27 -year-old Chinese fir showed stronger inhibitory effects on the growth of germinants compared with that from a 3 -year-old one. More cyclic dipep-tides were found in the leaf aqueous extract; and even more were found in the tissue aqueous extract and in the rhizosphere soil from older plantations. This suggests that more cyclic dipeptides are produced by leaves and released into the soil through the root exudation as Chinese <b>fir</b> <b>plantations</b> increase in age...|$|R

40|$|In {{the context}} of land use change, the {{dynamics}} of the water extractable organic carbon (WEOC) pool and CO 2 production were studied in soil from a native oak-beech forest and a Douglas <b>fir</b> <b>plantation</b> during a 98 -day incubation at a range of temperatures from 8 °C to 28 °C. The soil organic carbon, water contents and mineralisation rates of soil samples from the 0 – 5 cm layer were higher in the native forest than in the Douglas <b>fir</b> <b>plantation.</b> During incubation, a temperature-dependent shift in the δ 13 C of respired CO 2 was observed, suggesting that different carbon compounds were mineralised at different temperatures. The initial size of the WEOC pool was not affected by forest type. The WEOC pool size of samples from the native forest did not change consistently over time whereas it decreased significantly in samples from the Douglas plantation, irrespective of soil temperature. No clear changes in the δ 13 C values of the WEOC were observed, irrespective of soil origin. The fate of the WEOC, independent of soil organic carbon content or mineralisation rates, appeared to relate to forest types.

Methods We used reference land unit to collect soil samples in natural secondary forests and Chinese <b>fir</b> (Cunninghamia lanceolata) <b>plantations</b> and analyzed liable organic carbon in the depth of 0 – 60 cm. Important findings The contents of soil total organic carbon (TOC), easily-oxidized carbon (EOC), water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) and light fraction organic matter (LFOM) in the soil of natural secondary forests were higher than those in Chinese <b>fir</b> <b>plantations.</b> The variations in amplitude for these four parameters were 19. 0 %– 32. 6 %, 0. 8 %– 30. 3 %, 3. 8 %– 54. 1 % and 6. 3 %– 38. 6 %, respectively. There were significant differences in the depth of 0 – 10 cm and 10 – 20 cm (p < 0. 05) (WSOC was only significantly different in the depth of 0 – 10 cm). The ratios of WSOC and EOC to TOC content in Chinese <b>fir</b> <b>plantations</b> were higher than those in natural secondary forests. WSOC, EOC and LFOM were significantly related to TOC in the two forest stands, and the correlation coefficients of EOC and LFOM to TOC in natural secondary forests were higher than those in Chinese <b>fir</b> <b>plantations.</b> TOC, WSOC, EOC and LFOM were all significantly related to soil nutrients (total N, hydrolysis N and available K, Ca and Mg) ...|$|R

30|$|Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.) Hook.) is an {{evergreen}} conifer {{species and}} is one of the most important commercial species in China. Not only is it a valuable timber species useful for construction and furniture manufacturing (Huang 2013; Zhang et al. 2013), but it is also commonly used for pulp and biomass energy production (Nie et al. 1998; Li et al. 2013). Chinese fir has been widely planted throughout subtropical China (Yu 1997; Wu 1984), and according to the results of the 8 th National Forest Inventory, the planting area of Chinese fir is about 11.0 million ha, accounted for 15.8 % of all plantations in the country (SFA 2014). In addition to its importance as a source of fibre, Chinese <b>fir</b> <b>plantations</b> also play an important role in water and soil conservation, and in climate regulation through their function as carbon sinks (Tian et al. 2002; Wang et al. 2009). Considering their large area of cultivation, and high potential for atmospheric CO 2 fixation (Yao et al. 2015), Chinese <b>fir</b> <b>plantations</b> represent a key component of China’s greenhouse gas mitigation strategy.|$|R
40|$|Runoff and {{evapotranspiration}} are two key {{variables of}} water budget in forest ecosystems. Modeling runoff and evapotranspiration dynamics {{play a vital}} role in assessing the hydrology cycle and function of forest ecosystems. Based on the hydrological and meteorological data collected over 20 years from January of 1988 to December of 2007 at Huitong National Forest Ecosystem Research Station, we used back propagation neural network (BPNN) and genetic neural network (GNN) models to simulate runoff and evapotranspiration of Chinese <b>fir</b> <b>plantations</b> for two watersheds located in Huitong county of Hunan Province, China. The purpose of this study was to accurately simulate runoff and evapotranspiration dynamics using both BPNN and GNN models. The model simulations of the runoff and evapotranspiration indicated that the GNN model concurrently possesses efficiency, effectiveness, and robustness. Moreover, the simulated results of GNN and BPNN model were compared with a multivariate statistics (M-slat) model. We found that the GNN model performed better than M-slat and BPNN models for modeling both runoff and evapotranspiration of Chinese <b>fir</b> <b>plantations</b> in China. (c) 2011 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Sustained forest {{management}} of Cunninghamia lanceolata (Chinese <b>fir)</b> <b>plantations</b> in subtropical China is restricted by the limited availability of quantitative data. This study combines inventory data and tree-ring analysis of Chinese fir from natural and plantation forests that {{were subjected to}} controlled burning or brush clearing site preparations. Inter-annual variation of Chinese fir tree-ring widths were measured for the controlled burning, brush clearing and natural forest sites. The mean annual diametric growth of Chinese fir was 0. 56 cm·year− 1 for the natural forest, 0. 80 cm·year− 1 for the brush clearing site and 1. 10 cm·year− 1 for the controlled burning site. The time needed to reach the minimum cutting/logging diameter of 15 cm was 14 years in the controlled burning site, 19 years in the brush clearing site and > 40 years in the natural forest. The biological rotation ages for the burning, cutting and natural forest sites were 15, 26 and > 100 years, respectively. The total aboveground biomasses for the burning and clearing sites were 269. 8 t·ha− 1 and 252 t·ha− 1, respectively.

40|$|Stand density {{regulation}} {{is an important}} measure of plantation forest management, and phosphorus (P) is often the limiting factor of tree productivity, especially in the subtropics and tropics. However, the stand density influence on ecosystem P cycling is unclear in Chinese <b>fir</b> (Cunninghamia lanceolata) <b>plantations</b> of subtropical China. We collected rhizosphere and bulk soils, leaves and twigs with different ages and roots with different orders to measure P and nitrogen (N) variables in Chinese <b>fir</b> <b>plantations</b> with low density (LDCF) and high density (HDCF) at Fujian and Hunan provinces of subtropical China. Rhizosphere soil labile P, slow P, occluded P and extractable P were higher in LDCF than HDCF at two sites. Meanwhile, P and N concentrations of 1 -year-old leaves and twigs were higher in LDCF than HDCF and leaf N/P ratio generally increased with increasing leaf age at two sites. Rhizosphere vs. bulk soil labile P and occluded P were greater in LDCF than HDCF at Fujian. Nitrogen resorption efficiencies (NRE) of leaves and twigs were higher in LDCF than HDCF at Fujian, while their P resorption efficiencies (PRE) were not different between two densities at two sites. The average NRE of leaves (41. 7 %) and twigs (65. 6 %) were lower than the corresponding PRE (67. 8 % and 78. 0 %, respectively).

30|$|There is {{considerable}} uncertainty surrounding the possible {{effects of climate}} change on the long-term health and productivity of Chinese <b>fir</b> <b>plantations</b> throughout China. Deviations from historical temperature and precipitation regimes can influence a wide range of ecological processes associated with forest productivity including decomposition of dead organic matter and nutrient mineralisation rates (Gholz et al. 2000), photosynthetic rates and length of growing season (Boisvenue and Running 2006), and water stress and drought-related mortality (Allen et al. 2010). Moreover, relatively little is known about how climate change may influence the long-term growth and development of Chinese <b>fir</b> <b>plantations</b> in different parts of its range. In general, Chinese fir is adapted to warm and relatively moist climate regimes although it is also considered to be tolerant of periods of moisture stress (Wei et al. 1991). Past studies on the relationship between the growth of Chinese fir and climate factors have primarily focused on the analysis of suitable climate envelopes throughout its distribution (Wei et al. 1991; Guan 1989; Shi 1994; Wu and Hong 1984; Zhang 1995). While such studies are useful, they do not provide adequate information to inform managers how current plantations may respond to shifting climate regimes. Such information is essential to support the development of sustainable and resilient plantation management systems.|$|R
30|$|The process-based, stand-level model FORECAST Climate {{was applied}} to examine the {{potential}} impacts of alternative climate change scenarios on the long-term growth and development of Chinese <b>fir</b> <b>plantations</b> in Fujian province. Climate change is projected to have a modest positive impact on plantation productivity due to a gradual lengthening of the growing season and an associated increase in nutrient cycling rates. While the model predicted an increase in dry-season water stress under climate change, it did not project an increase in drought-related mortality. Moreover, the model predicted that the increases in atmospheric CO 2 concentrations associated with climate change would lead to increases in WUE thereby reducing the development of water stress. However, additional research should be conducted to examine the potential sensitivity of Chinese fir forests in this region to {{significant changes in the}} interannual variability in precipitation patterns associated with climate change. It is also {{important to note that the}} predicted increases in Chinese <b>fir</b> <b>plantations</b> associated with climate change may not be realised if changes in climate regime also lead to increased mortality from biotic and abiotic disturbance agents. The work presented here demonstrates the value of employing a process-based model with relatively minor calibration requirements to evaluate the potential impacts of climate change on key ecosystem processes and long-term productivity.|$|R

40|$|International audienceAbstract Key messageWe {{tested the}} life span of fine roots of Chinese fir trees and {{understory}} plants in two stands in subtropical China. Fine roots from understory plants were much more ephemeral than those from trees. The life span of fine roots of understory plants and Chinese fir was shorter in the younger than in the older stand, although most of the factors affecting fine-root life spans were similar between trees and understory plants. ContextUnderstory fine root can contribute significantly to total fine root biomass and belowground carbon. AimsThe contribution of understory vegetation to belowground carbon and nutrient cycling is often neglected in forest stands. Potential differences in fine-root life span between understory and trees remain poorly known. This study aimed to document fine-root life spans in trees and understory plants in two Chinese <b>fir</b> <b>plantations</b> with different ages. MethodsWe measured fine-root (≤ 2  mm in diameter) life span for trees and understory vegetation in 16 - and 88 -year-old Chinese <b>fir</b> <b>plantations</b> in southern China during 4  years with minirhizotron. Factors controlling fine-root life spans were identified with Cox proportional hazards regression. ResultsFine roots were more ephemeral in understory plants than in trees in the two plantations. Fine-root life spans for both trees and understory plants were longer in the older than in the younger plantation. Root diameter at appearance, rooting depth, and season of emergence had a significant effect on fine-root life span. ConclusionThese results highlight the importance of taking into account understory fine-root life span estimates when assessing the dynamics of fine-root recycling in Chinese fir forests...|$|R
30|$|It also is {{important}} to note that FORECAST Climate does not account for the potential impacts of climate change on the activity of other disturbance agents. There is evidence that both biotic (insects and pathogens) and abiotic (fire and wind) disturbance are influenced by climate change (van Mantgem and Stephenson 2007; Mutch and Parsons 1998). O’Grady et al. (2013) pointed out that trees suffering from soil-water deficits are more susceptible to biotic disturbance agents due to significant changes in the energy and carbon balance of the plants. Thus, the predicted increases in Chinese <b>fir</b> <b>plantations</b> associated with climate change may not be realised if changes in climate regime lead to increased mortality from biotic and abiotic disturbance agents.|$|R
