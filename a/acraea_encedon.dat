40|$|Inherited {{bacteria}} that kill male hosts {{early in their}} development are known from five insect orders.

In Tanzanian A. encedon however, two phylogenetically distinct strains of male-killingWolbachia were found within the same population. If this pattern of male-killer polymorphism is found to be general across infected species, it suggests that new male-killing infections arise frequently on an evolutionary time scale.

Moreover, the association between Wolbachia susceptibility and colour pattern was analyzed statistically. Two hypotheses were tested: first, morph ratio dynamics is a consequence of random extinction-colonization cycles, caused by Wolbachia spread, and second, particular colour forms are less susceptible to Wolbachia infection than others, implying the existence of colour form-specific resistance alleles. Overall, obtained data are consistent with the first hypothesis but not with the second, however, further research is needed before any firm conclusions can be made on the reality, scale and nature of the presumed association between polymorphism and male-killing in A. encedon...|$|E
40|$|The {{inherited}} bacterium Wolbachia spreads {{through the}} manipulation of host reproduction, and has been suggested {{to be an important}} factor in arthropod evolution, from host speciation to the evolution of sexdetermination systems. Past work has shown that members of this group may produce cytoplasmic incompatibility, feminize genetically male hosts, and induce host parthenogenesis. Here, we report an expansion of the range of reproductive manipulations produced by members of this clade, recording Wolbachia strains that kill male hosts during embryogenesis in two host species, the ladybird Adalia bipunctata, and the butter£y <b>Acraea</b> <b>encedon.</b> Both male-killing bacteria belong to the B group of Wolbachia. However, phylogenetic analyses were unable to resolve whether the bacteria in the two species are monophyletic, or represent independent origins of male-killing among the B-group Wolbachia. We also found signi¢cant divergence within the wsp gene of Wolbachia strains found in di¡erent A. bipunctata individuals, suggesting this host species contains two Wolbachia strains, diverged in wsp sequence but monophyletic. Our observations reinforce the notion that Wolbachia may be an important agent driving arthropod evolution, and corroborates previous suggestions that male-killing behaviour is easily evolved by invertebrate symbionts...|$|E

The tropical butterfly <b>Acraea</b> <b>encedon</b> is known to be infected with a male-killing bacterium of the genus Wolbachia, which has led to severe sex ratio distortion in some populations where more than 95 % of wild females are infected with the malekiller. Thus, the aggregation of female A. encedon at resource-free landmarks has been interpreted as “female lekking” behaviour, a sex role-reversed form of lekking normally seen in males of many animals. For this paper, sites in Uganda where female-leks have previously been reported (in 1998) were revisited and surveyed for both sex ratio and bacterial prevalence, for 3 years (2005 – 2007). The hypothesis of sex role-reversal in A. encedon was evaluated in light of the field data obtained. The study concluded that the response of host populations to the gradual spread of the male-killer toward fixation occurs initially at the behavioural level, as sex role-reversal, and finally at the demographic level, by succumbing to extinction...|$|E
40|$|Sex-role-reversed mating {{systems in}} which females compete {{for males and}} males may be choosy are usually {{associated}} with males investing more than females in o¡spring. We report that sex-role reversal may also be caused by sel¢sh genetic elements which distort the sex ratio towards females. Some popula-tions of the butter£ies <b>Acraea</b> <b>encedon</b> and Acraea encedana are extremely female biased because over 90 % of females are infected with a Wolbachia bacterium that is maternally inherited and kills male embryos. Many females in these populations are virgins suggesting that their reproductive success may be limited by access to males. These females form lekking swarms at landmarks in which females exhibit behaviours which we interpret as functioning to solicit matings from males. The hypothesis that female A. encedon swarm in order to mate {{is supported by the}} ¢nding that, in release^recapture experiments, mated females tend to leave the swarm while unmated females remained. This behaviour is a sex-role-reversed form of a common mating system in insects in which males form lekking swarms at landmarks and compete for females. Female lekking swarms are absent from less female-biased populations and here the butter£ies are instead associated with resources {{in the form of the}} larval food plant.

40|$|Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) {{sequences}} {{are widely}} used as neutral genetic markers in insects. However, patterns of mtDNA variability are confounded by the spread of maternally transmitted parasites, which are genetically linked to the mitochondria. We have investigated these effects in the butterflies <b>Acraea</b> <b>encedon</b> (which is host to two strains of male-killing Wolbachia bacteria) and A. encedana (which is host to one strain). Within a population, the mitochondria are in linkage disequilibrium with the different male-killers. Furthermore, {{there has been a}} recent selective sweep of the mtDNA, which has led to the loss of mitochondrial variation within populations and erased any geographical structure. We also found that one of the male-killers, together with the associated mtDNA, has introgressed from A. encedana into A. encedon within the last 16, 000 years. Interestingly, because butterflies are female heterogametic, this will presumably have also led to the introgression of genes on the W sex chromosome. Finally, in A. encedon the mitochondria in uninfected females are unaltered by the spread of the male-killer and have diverse, geographically structured mtDNA. This means we can reject the hypothesis that the male-killer is at a stable equilibrium maintained by imperfect transmission of the bacterium. Instead, some other form of balancing selection may be maintaining uninfected females in the population and preventing the species from going extinct due to a shortage of males...|$|E
40|$|In lekking species, intense {{directional}} {{selection is}} applied to aspects of the male genotype by female choice. Under conventional quantitative genetics theory, the expectation is that this {{will lead to a}} rapid loss in additive genetic variance for the trait in question. However, despite female choice, male variation is maintained and hence it pays females to continue choosing. This has been termed the 'paradox of the lek'. Here we present a theoretical analysis of a putative sex-role-reversed lek in the butterfly <b>Acraea</b> <b>encedon.</b> Sex-role reversal appears to have come about because of infection with a male-killing Wolbachia. The bacterium is highly prevalent in some populations, such that there is a dearth of males. Receptive females form dense aggregations, and {{it has been suggested that}} males preferentially select females uninfected with the bacterium. As with more conventional systems, this presents a theoretical problem exactly analogous to the lek paradox, namely what maintains female variation and hence why do males continue to choose? We model the evolution of a male choice gene that allows discrimination between infected and uninfected females, and show that the stable maintenance of both female variation and male choice is likely, so long as males make mistakes when discriminating between females. Furthermore, our model allows the maintenance, in a panmictic population, of a male killer that is perfectly transmitted. This is the first model to allow this result, and may explain the long-term persistence of a male killer in Hypolimnas bolina...|$|E

Within the same geographic zone, the three species show female-biased sex ratios as a consequence of infection by maternally-inherited, male-killing bacteria. The co-occurrence of biased sex ratios and aposematic polymorphism within these three sympatric, mimetic butterfly species has led to the speculation that invasion by the male-killing bacteria and the subsequent female-biased sex ratios are the underlying reason for the maintenance of colour polymorphism in these species, following its establishment by periods of allopatry and monomorphism and hybridisation. In this paper, we present a novel hypothesis that describes a mechanism by which such causal link might have taken place; in our view, positive frequency-dependent selection fav-ouring the most common colour form in the species is disrupted {{as a consequence of the}} recurrent extinction-recolonisation cycles undergone at the level of the species populations following the spread of the male-killer. Likewise, extinctions and recolonisations taking place in the other mimics randomly change the direction of selection on each species, potentially leading to multiple selective pressures favouring different colour patterns in the mimicry complex. Thus, selection for monomorphism within each species as well as between the mimetic species will be continuously randomised by the enhanced metapopulation dynamics and the state of polymorphism will be maintained consequently...|$|E
40|$|A {{detailed}} {{assessment of the}} evolution and phylogenetic utility of two genes, ftsZ and wsp, was used to investigate the origin of male-killing Wolbachia, previously isolated from the ladybird Adalia bipunctata and the butterfly <b>Acraea</b> <b>encedon.</b> The analysis included almost all available sequences of B-group Wolbachia and two outgroup taxa and showed that (1) the two gene regions differ in phylogenetic utility, (2) sequence variation is here correlated with phylogenetic information content, (3) both genes show significant rate heterogeneity between lineages, (4) increased substitution rates are associated with homoplasy in the data, (5) wsp sequences of some taxa appear {{to be subject to}} positive selection, and (6) {{only a limited number of}} clades can be inferred with confidence due to either lack of phylogenetic information or the presence of homoplasy. With respect to the evolution of male-killing, the two genes nevertheless seemed to provide unbiased information. However, they consistently produce contradictory results. Current data therefore do not permit clarification of the origin of this behavior. In addition, A. bipunctata was found to be a host to two recently diverged strains of male-killing Wolbachia that showed increased substitution rates for both genes. Moreover, the wsp gene, which codes for an outer membrane protein, was found to be subject to positive selection in these taxa. These findings were postulated to be the product of high selection pressures due to antagonistic host-symbiont interactions in this ladybird species. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that the results of a detailed phylogenetic analysis, including characterization of the limitations of such an approach, can serve as a valuable basis for an understanding of the evolution of Wolbachia bacteria. Moreover, particular features of gene evolution, such as elevated substitution rates or the presence of positive selection, may provide information about the dynamics of Wolbachia-host associations...|$|E
