5|$|Many {{authors have}} {{described}} the prey items taken under natural circumstances. Although fish and frogs are their most common prey, they eat almost any small vertebrate. Campbell and Lamar (2004) provided an exhaustive list of species that have reportedly been preyed upon by A. piscivorus, including cicadas, caterpillars, land snails (Euglandina rosea), catfish (Ictalurus furcatus), pike (Esox ssp.), sunfishes (Lepomis ssp.), bass (Micropterus ssp.), sirens (Siren spp.), eastern newts (Notophthalmus viridescens), brook salamanders (Eurycea spp.), Ouachita dusky salamanders (Desmognathus brimleyorum), spadefoot toads (Scaphiopus), eastern narrowmouth toads (Gastrophryne carolinensis), northern cricket frogs (Acris crepitans), West Indian treefrogs (Osteopilus septentrionalis), treefrogs (Hyla spp.), true frogs (Rana spp.), green anoles (Anolis carolinensis), skinks (Eumeces spp.), eastern glass lizards (Ophisaurus ventralis), ground skinks (Scincella lateralis), mudsnakes (Farancia abacura), hog-nosed snakes (Heterodon platirhinos), kingsnakes (Lampropeltis spp.), watersnakes (Nerodia spp.), crayfish snakes (Regina spp.), brown snakes (Storeria dekayi), gartersnakes and ribbonsnakes (Thamnophis spp.), other cottonmouths (A. piscivorus), rattlesnakes (Crotalus spp.), common snapping turtles (Chelydra serpentina), mud turtles (Kinosternon spp.), common musk turtles (Sternotherus odoratus), Florida cooters (Pseudemys floridana), sliders (Trachemys scripta), eastern box turtles (Terrapene carolina), Florida softshell turtles (Apalone ferox), baby American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis), wood thrushes (Hylocichla mustelina), chickadees (Parus spp.), cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis), unidentified passerines, small ducks, juvenile anhingas (<b>Anhinga</b> <b>anhinga),</b> common egrets (Ardea alba), egrets, glossy ibises and their eggs (Plegadis falcinellus), tricolor herons (Egretta tricolor), herons and their eggs, pied-billed grebes (Podilymbus podiceps), short-tailed shrews (Blarina brevicauda), least shrews (Cryptotis parva), southeastern shrews (Sorex longirostris), eastern moles (Scalopus aquaticus), muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus), rice rats (Oryzomys palustris), hispid pocket mice (Perognathus hispidus), black rats (Rattus rattus), squirrels (Sciurus spp.), rabbits (Sylvilagus spp.) and bats.|$|E
5|$|New World {{vultures}} are not {{closely related}} to Old World vultures, but superficially resemble them because of convergent evolution. Like the Old World vultures, they are scavengers. Unlike Old World vultures, which find carcasses by sight, New World vultures have {{a good sense of}} smell with which they locate carcasses. The turkey vulture has a red head. The black vulture has a grey head. Although not a water bird, a flock of black vultures at the Myakka River State Park, southeast of Sarasota, has been seen bathing {{at the edge of the}} lake and then drying out their wings in the same way as cormorants like the Florida <b>anhinga.</b> This habit may help free them of parasites.|$|E
5|$|The {{wide variety}} of birds in Basse Casamance was noted by early explorers. While Basse Casamance National Park and Kalissaye Avifaunal Reserve have not been open for years due to the Casamance Conflict, Carabane {{has been found to}} be very conducive to ornithological observation. A study in 1998 {{discovered}} the following species on the island: African darter (<b>Anhinga</b> rufa), Goliath heron (Ardea goliath), palm-nut vulture (Gypohierax angolensis), black-tailed godwit (Limosa limosa), whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus), Eurasian curlew (Numenius arquata), Caspian tern (Sterna caspia), blue-spotted wood-dove (Turtur afer), red-eyed dove (Streptopelia semitorquata), white-rumped swift (Apus caffer), woodland kingfisher (Halcyon senegalensis), grey-backed camaroptera (Camaroptera brachyura), red-bellied paradise-flycatcher (Terpsiphone rufiventer), pied crow (Corvus albus), black-rumped waxbill (Estrilda troglodytres) and yellow-fronted canary (Serinus mozambicus).|$|E
50|$|Most of {{the male}} <b>anhinga's</b> body is a glossy black green with the wings, base of wings, and tail being a glossy black blue. The tip of the tail has white feathers. The {{back of the head}} and the neck have {{elongated}} feathers that have been described as gray or light purple-white. The upper back of the body and wings is spotted or streaked with white.|$|R

5|$|Several walking {{trails in}} the park vary in hiking {{difficulty}} on Pine Island, where visitors can cross hardwood hammocks, pinelands, and freshwater sloughs. Starting at the Royal Palm Visitor Center, the <b>Anhinga</b> Trail is a half-mile self-guided tour through a sawgrass marsh where visitors can see alligators, marsh and wading birds, turtles, and bromeliads. Its proximity to Homestead and its accessibility make {{it one of the}} most visited sites {{in the park}}. The nearby Gumbo Limbo Trail is also self-guided, at half a mile long. It loops through a canopy of hardwood hammocks that include gumbo limbo, royal palms (Roystonea), strangler figs (Ficus aurea), and a variety of epiphytes. Twenty eight miles (45km) of trails start near the Long Pine Key campgrounds and wind through Long Pine Key, well-suited for offroad cycling through the pine rocklands in the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Wilderness Area. Two boardwalks allow visitors to walk through a cypress forest at Pa-Hay-O-Kee, which also features a two-story overlook, and another at Mahogany Hammock (referring to Swietenia mahagoni) that takes hikers through a dense forest in the middle of a freshwater marl prairie. Closer to Flamingo, more rugged trails take visitors through mangrove swamps, along Florida Bay. Christian Point Trail, Snake Bight Trail, Rowdy Bend Trail and Coastal Prairie Trail allow viewing of shorebirds and wading birds among the mangroves. Portions of the trails may be impassable depending on the time of year, because of mosquitoes and water levels. Ranger-led tours take place in the busier season only.|$|E
500|$|Cypress {{trees are}} {{conifers}} that are adapted {{to live in}} standing fresh water. They grow in compact structures called cypress domes and in long strands over limestone. Water levels may fluctuate dramatically around cypress domes and strands, so cypresses develop [...] "knees" [...] that protrude from the water at high levels to provide oxygen for the root systems. Dwarf cypress trees grow in drier areas with poorer soil. Epiphytes, such as bromeliads, Spanish moss (Tillandsia usneoides), orchids and ferns grow on the branches and trunks of cypress trees. Everglades National Park features twenty-five species of orchids. Tall cypress trees provide excellent nesting areas for birds including wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo), ibis, herons, egrets, anhingas (<b>Anhinga</b> <b>anhinga),</b> and belted kingfisher (Megaceryle alcyon). Mammals in cypress regions include white-tailed deer, squirrels, raccoons, opossums, skunks, swamp rabbits, river otters (Lontra canadensis), and bobcats, as well as small rodents.|$|E
500|$|Stowe recounts several sailing trips {{she takes}} on the St. Johns and Julington Creek and the animals she sees during her excursion, appreciating the alligators, [...] "water-turkeys" [...] (<b>Anhinga</b> <b>anhinga),</b> and [...] "fish-hawks", or ospreys (Pandion haliaetus). Long an animal lover, she took her dogs, cats, and birds with her {{as part of the}} [...] "earthquake" [...] of the annual {{relocation}} from Hartford to Mandarin. She extended this care to other animals as well. In Naples, Italy, she once got out of a carriage to walk as it was being pulled up a steep hill by two beleaguered horses that were being whipped by the driver, and asked her companions and guide to do the same. Not only did she write the first travel guide to Florida, but Stowe also became the first defender of wild animals. She pays particular attention in Palmetto Leaves to hunters who shoot at anything they see. Not taking offense at hunting for the sake of eating, Stowe laments killing for its own sake: [...] "it must be something that enjoys and can suffer; something that loves life, and must lose it". In 1877 she followed her book with a pamphlet that urged the cessation of the slaughter of Florida's wading birds, whose feathers were selling at the price of gold and used in women's hats.|$|E
500|$|The open {{waters are}} {{inhabited}} by fishes, molluscs and crustaceans living on sea grasses or who prey on each other. The shallowness {{of the lagoon}} makes it suitable habitat for diving birds such as <b>anhinga,</b> cormorants and diving ducks. The bay also provides habitat for juvenile sea animals that have left {{the shelter of the}} mangrove belts. [...] Manatees frequent the quiet waters of the bay. The bay has a year-round population of double-crested cormorants. Winter residents include northern gannets, American white pelicans and common loons. The bay also has a resident population of common bottlenose dolphins.|$|E

2500|$|Medial (inter-word or inter-stem) double {{consonant}} clusters are common. Nasal + stop clusters, both homorganic (formed with phonemes {{from the}} same place of articulation) and non-homorganic, are frequent, as are nasal + nasal clusters. Stop + nasal clusters are rare, but they do occur. Liquids (laterals or rhotics) can be combined with stops or nasals, though (stop or nasal) + liquid are not found. Geminate clusters (in which the same consonant is repeated twice) are found only in reduplicated words such as garaggarag, [...] "darter (<b>Anhinga</b> novaehollandiae)." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2005-2007, {{the area}} {{encompassing}} the old Okovango Landing, {{as well as}} the children's play area was renovated.

There are columns topped with flowering plants, benches for seating, and a large patio area surrounding the fountain. Seven live oaks and other native trees - red maples, magnolias, and forest pansies - have been planted in the area around the garden to provide shade.|$|E
2500|$|Pelican Island National Wildlife Refuge holds {{hundreds}} of species of animals including birds, fish, plants, and mammals. [...] The wetlands of Pelican Island {{are a major}} ecological system supporting the huge biological diversity. [...] Fifteen federally listed threatened and endangered species live in Pelican Island NWR and around Indian River Lagoon. [...] Of the endangered species, West Indian manatees and sea turtles occupy parts of the lagoon. [...] Around the lagoon in the refuge are two wood stork refuges. [...] These birds along with other wading birds that nest on the island thrive on the tremendous fish population. [...] Pelican Island is home to many nesting birds including brown pelicans, great egrets, snowy egrets, reddish egrets, great blue heron, little blue heron, tricolored heron, black-crowned night heron, American white ibis, glossy ibis, double-crested cormorant, <b>anhinga,</b> and American oystercatcher.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} swamp forests {{have almost}} entirely been removed as the plain {{has been converted}} to rice paddies, other agriculture, and urban areas like Bangkok. Much of the wildlife that once inhabited these plains has disappeared, including {{a large number of}} fish in the river systems, birds such as vultures, the Oriental darter (<b>Anhinga</b> melanogaster), white-eyed river martin (Pseudochelidon sirintarae), the sarus crane (Grus antigone) and animals such as tigers, Asian elephants, Javan rhinoceroses, and the much-hunted Schomburgk's deer. Today we can only guess at the original habitat and wildlife by comparing it with neighbouring countries. It is believed that the area [...] would have consisted of freshwater swamps inland and salty mangroves on the coast and the river estuaries. The swamp would have been covered in Phragmites marsh grasses. Today there is a small area of this remaining in Khao Sam Roi Yot National Park, a relic of the original landscape.|$|E
50|$|The African darter is {{a member}} of the darter family, Anhingidae, and is closely related to American (<b>Anhinga</b> <b>anhinga),</b> Oriental (<b>Anhinga</b> melanogaster), and Australasian (<b>Anhinga</b> novaehollandiae) darters.|$|E
50|$|The Oriental darter is {{a member}} of the darter family, Anhingidae, and is closely related to American (<b>Anhinga</b> <b>anhinga),</b> African (<b>Anhinga</b> rufa, with vulsini of Madagascar as a subspecies), and Australasian (<b>Anhinga</b> novaehollandiae) darters. These were for {{sometime}} treated as subspecies of <b>Anhinga</b> melanogaster. The Oriental darter differs in appearance from American darters most recognisably by its white lateral neck stripe.|$|E
50|$|<b>Anhinga</b> {{species are}} found {{all over the}} world in warm shallow waters. The American <b>anhinga</b> has been {{subdivided}} into two subspecies, A. a. <b>anhinga</b> and A. a. leucogaster, based on their location. A. a. <b>anhinga</b> can be found mainly east of the Andes in South America and also the islands of Trinidad and Tobago.

5000|$|The <b>anhinga</b> ( [...] ; <b>Anhinga</b> <b>anhinga),</b> {{sometimes}} called snakebird, darter, American darter, or water turkey, is a water bird of the warmer {{parts of the}} Americas. The word <b>anhinga</b> comes from the Brazilian Tupi language and means devil bird or snake bird. When swimming {{the origin of the}} name snakebird is apparent: only the colored neck appears above water so the bird looks like a snake ready to strike. They do not have external nares (nostrils) and breathe solely through their epiglottis.|$|E
5000|$|The area {{includes}} the 2000 ha Guanabara Ecological Station, created on 15 February 2006, which protects {{one of the}} last sections of midsize contiguous mangrove habitats in the state.

50|$|John Gould {{described}} the Australasian darter as Plotus novaehollandiae in 1847. Closely related to American (<b>Anhinga</b> <b>anhinga),</b> African (<b>Anhinga</b> rufa), and Oriental (<b>Anhinga</b> melanogaster) darters, the Australasian darter has been classed as a subspecies of the African or African plus Oriental darters. All four {{have also been}} classed as a single species. Examination of the leg bones indicates the three Old World species are {{more closely related to}} each other with the American species more divergent.

5000|$|<b>Anhinga</b> {{is derived}} from the Tupi ajÃ­Åa (also {{transcribed}} Ã¡yinga or ayingÃ¡), which in local mythology refers to a malevolent demonic forest spirit; it is often translated as [...] "devil bird". The name changed to <b>anhingÃ¡</b> or anhangÃ¡ as it was transferred to the Tupi-Portuguese LÃ­ngua Geral. However, in its first documented use as an English term in 1818, it referred to an Old World darter. Ever since, it has also been used for the modern genus <b>Anhinga</b> as a whole.|$|E
