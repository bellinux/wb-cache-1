During the first week of November, the first ship docked at the newly built Valdez quays. It was not a tanker but a ship bringing more construction material. In December, the first signal was sent from the Valdez operations center—where two new control computers had been installed—to Pump Station 2 on the North Slope.|$|E

By 135, however, he had returned to Italy for good.

In 136, shortly after, Marcus assumed the toga virilis symbolizing his passage into manhood, Hadrian arranged for his engagement to one of Commodus' daughters, Ceionia Fabia. Marcus was made prefect of the city during the feriae Latinae soon after (he was probably appointed by Commodus). Although the office held no real administrative significance—the full-time prefect remained in office during the festival—it remained a prestigious office for young aristocrats and members of the imperial family.

In 1920 he married Celia Inez Peckham, who became the mother of his three children, Raymond Ben, Robert Peckham and Celia Lee. Around the same time he began work as a fire prevention engineer (an inspector) for the Hartford Fire Insurance Company. He was particularly good <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> and was highly commended by his employers. His job required him to travel to production facilities throughout New England to be inspected. One anecdote describes him arriving at a chemical plant in which he was denied access by the director because he would not allow anyone to see the production procedure which was a trade secret. Having been told what the plant produced, Whorf wrote a chemical formula on a piece of paper, saying to the director: [...] "I think this is what you're doing".

500|$|Conkling succeeded to {{leadership}} of the conservative wing of New York's Republicans by 1868 as Morgan concentrated more time and effort on national politics, including serving {{as chairman of the}} Republican National Committee. [...] The Conkling machine was solidly behind General Ulysses S. Grant's candidacy for president, and Arthur raised funds for Grant's election in 1868. The opposing Democratic machine in New York City, known as Tammany Hall, worked for Grant's opponent, former New York Governor Horatio Seymour; while Grant was victorious in the national vote, Seymour narrowly carried the state of New York. Arthur began to devote more of his time to politics and less to law, and in 1869 he became counsel to the New York City tax commission, appointed when Republicans controlled the state legislature. He remained <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> until 1870 at a salary of $10,000 a year. Arthur resigned after Democrats controlled by William M. Tweed of Tammany Hall won a legislative majority, which meant they could name their own appointee.

30|$|We {{observe that}} some of these errors can be {{corrected}} with <b>the</b> help of <b>job</b> posting data since <b>the</b> main <b>jobs</b> posted by an employer often relate to its industry.

When we look <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>jobs</b> posted by <b>the</b> employer named “First Transit,” the titles of <b>the</b> <b>jobs</b> posted include “Shuttle Driver,” “Bus Operator,” “Automotive Technician”. By looking at these job titles, we can see that they belong to the Transportation domain. Also, the word “Transit” in the employer name is a good indicator that the employer industry is Transportation. Employers named “Fresenius Medical Care,” “Community Health Systems, Inc.” contain keywords “medical”, “health” and belong to the Health Care industry.|$|R

500|$|The Republican Party was {{dominant}} in New England in Coolidge's time, {{and he followed}} Hammond's and Field's example by becoming active in local politics. In 1896, Coolidge campaigned for Republican presidential candidate William McKinley, {{and the next year}} he was selected {{to be a member of}} the Republican City Committee. In 1898, he won election to the City Council of Northampton, placing second in a ward where the top three candidates were elected. The position offered no salary, but provided Coolidge invaluable political experience. In 1899, he declined renomination, running instead for City Solicitor, a position elected by the City Council. He was elected for a one-year term in 1900, and reelected in 1901. This position gave Coolidge more experience as a lawyer and paid a salary of $600. In 1902, the city council selected a Democrat for city solicitor, and Coolidge returned to private practice. Soon thereafter, however, the clerk of courts for the county died, and Coolidge was chosen to replace him. The position paid well, but it barred him from practicing law, so he remained <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> for only one year. In 1904, Coolidge suffered his sole defeat at the ballot box, losing an election to the Northampton school board.
