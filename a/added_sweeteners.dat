5000|$|In modern times, some brewers have <b>added</b> <b>sweeteners</b> such as Aspartame {{to their}} gueuzes to sweeten them, {{trying to make}} the beer more {{appealing}} to a wider audience. The original, unsweetened version {{is often referred to as}} [...] "Oude Gueuze" [...] ("Old Gueuze") and has become more popular in the early 2000s. Tim Webb, a British writer on Belgian and other beers, comments on the correct use of the term [...] "'Oude gueuze' or 'oude geuze', now legally defined and referring to a drink made by blending two or more 100% lambic beer." [...] Traditionally, gueuze is served in champagne bottles, which hold either 375 ml or 750 ml. Traditionally, gueuze, and the lambics from which it is made, has been produced in the area known as Pajottenland and in Brussels. However, some non-Pajottenland/Brussels lambic brewers have sprung up and one or two also produce gueuze - see table below.

40|$|Regular, non-diet, {{soft drinks}} are {{responsible}} for {{one third of the}} excessive amount of <b>added</b> <b>sweeteners</b> in the diets of children and adolescents (5).

Furthermore, BMI and the frequency of obesity were found to increase for each additional serving of sugar sweetened drink consumed by children (10 to 12 years) (6). The increased level of sweetener in regular soft drinks increases children's caloric intake and is a contributory factor in the development of pediatric and adolescent obesity. Obesity is caused by a variety of factors, and the role of beverage consumption on caloric intake has not been emphasized.

40|$|As in {{the case}} of {{probiotic}} functional foods in recent years, demand has increased notably for light or diet foods with <b>added</b> <b>sweeteners.</b> However, {{little is known about the}} effect of different sweeteners on the microorganisms present. Thus, the objective of the current study was to establish the ideal sucrose concentration and equivalent concentrations of different sweeteners and to determine, by microbiological analyses, the influence of these compounds on the viability of the starter and probiotic cultures used in the production of strawberry-flavored Petit Suisse cheese during its shelf life. The ideal sucrose concentration was determined using the just-about-right (JAR) scale, and the equivalent concentrations of the sweeteners were subsequently determined by the magnitude estimation method. Microbiological analyses were also carried out to check the viability of the cultures during the product's shelf life. The results showed that the compounds Neotame (NutraSweet, Chicago, IL) and stevia presented, respectively, the greatest and least sweetening power of the sweeteners tested. None of the sweeteners used in this study exerted a negative effect on the viability of the starter or probiotic cultures, and thus we were able to obtain a probiotic, functional food with reduced calorie content. © 2013 American Dairy Science Association...|$|E

40|$|We {{show that}} {{sweetening}} of food products by natural fermentation {{can be achieved}} by a combined metabolic engineering and transcriptome analysis approach. A Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris strain was constructed in which glucose metabolism was completely disrupted by deletion of the genes coding for glucokinase (glk), EIIman/glc (ptnABCD), and the newly discovered glucose-PTS EIIcel (ptcBAC). After introducing the lactose metabolic genes, the deletion strain could solely ferment the galactose moiety of lactose, while the glucose moiety accumulated extracellularly. Additionally, less lactose remained in the medium after fermentation. The resulting strain can be used for in situ production of glucose, circumventing the need to <b>add</b> <b>sweeteners</b> as additional ingredients to dairy products. Moreover, the enhanced removal of lactose achieved by this strain could be very useful in the manufacture of products for lactose intolerant individuals. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Intake {{of large}} amounts of <b>added</b> <b>sweeteners</b> has been {{associated}} with the pathogenesis of cardiometabolic risk. Several studies have shown that fructose increases the cardiovascular risk by modulating endothelial dysfunction and promoting atherosclerosis. Recently, a potential role for fructose in cardiovascular thrombosis has been suggested but with controversial results. Tissue factor (TF) plays a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular thrombosis by triggering the formation of intracoronary thrombi following endothelial injury. This study investigates the effects of fructose, in a concentration range usually observed in the plasma of patients with increased cardiovascular risk, on TF in human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVECs). Cells were stimulated with increasing concentrations of fructose (0. 25, 1 and 2. 5 mM) and then processed to evaluate TF-mRNA levels by real-time PCR as well as TF expression/activity by FACS analysis and procoagulant activity. Finally, a potential molecular pathway involved in modulating this phenomenon was investigated. We demonstrate that fructose induces transcription of mRNA for TF. In addition, we show that this monosaccharide promotes surface expression of TF that is functionally active. Fructose effects on TF appear modulated by the oxygen free radicals through activation of the transcription factor NF-κB since superoxide dismutase and NF-κB inhibitors suppressed TF expression. Data of the present study, although in vitro, indicate that fructose, besides promoting atherosclerosis, induces a prothrombotic phenotype in HUVECs, thus indicating one the mechanism(s) by which this sweetener might increase cardiometabolic risk...|$|E
40|$|The safety {{assessment}} of any food additive requires {{a knowledge of}} the pharmacology and toxicology of the additive and information regarding exposure. Population exposure is generally difficult to determine for a new compound and cannot be accurately established before its introduction. For this reason it is important to ensure that estimates of exposure be conservative. Usually this means consciously overestimating rather than underestimating intake exposure. Elsewhere in this volume there is extensive discussion of the metabolism and toxicology of aspartame and its degradation products phenylalanine, aspartic acid, methanol, and diketopiperazine. These extensive studies demonstrate that high doses of aspartame are well tolerated. However, it is important to estimate the probable range of aspartame intake that might be anticipated. We have used two approaches to estimate exposure to aspartame or its metabolites. The simplest involved the assumption that aspartame would replace the apparent per capita sugar intake. The per capita caloric sweetener intake was calculated, on the basis of disappearance, to be 156 g/day (1). Using a sweetener ratio of 180 : 1, this yields a daily estimated aspartame intake of 867 mg/day. Actual intake would be somewhat lower, since it is recognized that disappearance data overestimate consumption and not all of the sweetener applications can be replaced by aspartame. The second approach used to project aspartame intake involved developing a menu containing generous amounts of added sugars and assuming the substitution of aspartame for the <b>added</b> <b>sweeteners.</b> This menu is shown in Table 1.

40|$|BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES High {{intake of}} <b>added</b> <b>sweeteners</b> is {{considered}} to have a causal role in the pathogenesis of cardiometabolic disorders. Especially, high-fructose intake is regarded as potentially harmful to cardiometabolic health. It may cause not only weight gain but also low-grade inflammation, which represents an independent risk factor for developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. In particular, fructose has been suggested to induce plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 (PAI- 1) expression in the liver and to increase circulating inflammatory cytokines. We therefore aimed to investigate, whether high-fructose diet {{has an impact on}} PAI- 1, monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1 (MCP- 1), e-selectin and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations in healthy humans. SUBJECTS/METHODS We studied 20 participants (12 males and 8 females) of the TUebingen FRuctose Or Glucose study. This is an exploratory, parallel, prospective, randomized, single-blinded, outpatient, hypercaloric, intervention study. The participants had a mean age of 30. 9 ± 2. 1 years and a mean body mass index of 26. 0 ± 0. 5 kg/m(2) and they received 150 g of either fructose or glucose per day for 4 weeks. Results:There were neither significant changes of PAI- 1, MCP- 1, e-selectin and CRP after fructose (n= 10) and glucose (n= 10) intervention nor treatment effects (all P> 0. 2). Moreover, we did not observe longitudinal associations of the inflammatory parameters with triglycerides, liver fat, visceral fat and body weight in the fructose group.
