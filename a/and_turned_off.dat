5|$|Vettel {{began to}} pull away {{from the rest of the}} field. Trulli made a pit stop for a {{replacement}} nose cone at the start of the second lap after another car made contact with the rear end of his car and his front wing was removed. Webber battled Hülkenberg for eighth position but was unable to overtake the latter. Trulli made a second pit stop on the fifth lap to allow his mechanics to rectify a problem with his car's gearbox <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> his engine to allow for repairs to occur. Vettel set a fastest lap of the race on lap five, a 1:43.055, and was three seconds ahead of Hamilton, who in turn was being caught by Alonso. It was reported by Red Bull on the following lap that eighth-placed Webber had no mechanical issues. Webber made an early pit stop on lap seven for the medium compound tyres but his crew had a minor problem fitting his left-front wheel which meant he was stationary for 7.9 seconds, and rejoined in 18th position. Rosberg made a similar stop on the next lap but he overshot his pit stall and rejoined in 19th place.|$|E
25|$|The two RUC {{officers}} were travelling without escort in Buchanan's personal unmarked car: a red Vauxhall Cavalier with {{the registration number}} KIB 1204 which was not armoured-plated and didn't have bullet-proof glass. Buchanan had used this same car on all of his previous visits to Dundalk and other locations in the Republic of Ireland. Both {{officers were}} unarmed, as it was illegal to transport weapons into the Republic of Ireland, {{and they were in}} plain clothes. Buchanan drove away from the Dundalk Garda station after the meeting had ended at about 3.15 p.m. <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> the main Dublin-Belfast road onto the Edenappa Road which is a minor rural road which passes through the village of Jonesborough. Buchanan was known by the British Army to regularly take this route when going to or from Dundalk Garda station.|$|E
500|$|Timoshenko {{was rushed}} to Kings County Hospital Center once medical {{personnel}} arrived at the scene. Each of the two bullets that struck Timoshenko cut across his spinal cord, just beneath his brain, which left him unable to breathe on his own or to move his muscles. [...] According to doctors, he had no oxygen for 15 to 20 minutes after he was shot because of his initial paralysis. The loss of oxygen left him in a coma since the shooting, so he was placed on life support machines {{that allowed him to}} breathe. Tests conducted on July 14 determined that he had no brain activity (matching the definition of legal death in the state of New York); as a result, the doctors pronounced him dead at 4:14 p.m. <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> the artificial respirator. He was 23 {{years old at the time}} of his death.|$|E

500|$|OV-10 pilot Clark (Nail 38 Bravo) was {{closest to}} the team's {{position}} and would be rescued first. Clark was relayed instructions {{to get in the}} water and float downstream where Norris and his team would intercept him. The rescuer's initial plan was to swim upriver and meet Clark, but Norris tested the current and decided it was too strong. They would have to insert along the riverbank, a much more hazardous route. Anderson, Norris, and five Vietnamese commandos set up an overwatch position near the Mieu Giang River, which ran near the positions of both downed airmen. Anderson ordered Norris to take his team no more than [...] forward and wait for the survivors to come to them, but after departing, Norris ignored the order <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> his radio. Traveling twice that distance upriver, he avoided frequent North Vietnamese patrols, truck, and columns of tanks.|$|E
500|$|The light cruiser Nürnberg {{had been}} {{trailing}} the German squadron and spotted the plume of smoke from Glasgow at 20:35, and then saw Monmouth with a 10-degree list to port shortly afterwards. As Nürnberg closed the range, Monmouths list increased so {{that none of}} the guns on her port side could be used. The German cruiser closed to within [...] and illuminated her flag with its spotlight in the hopes that she would strike her colours and surrender. There was no response from the British ship and Nürnberg opened fire at 21:20, aiming high, but there was still no response. The German ship then fired a torpedo which missed <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> its searchlight. Monmouth then increased speed and turned towards Nürnberg, which caused her to open fire again. Monmouth capsized at 21:58, taking her entire crew of 735 men with her as the seas were too rough to attempt any rescue effort.|$|E
500|$|... 21st-place {{qualifier}} Casey Mears had his car lose {{power on}} his second warm-up lap after exiting the fourth turn and stopped in turn two; he was allowed one attempt to record a timed lap as a result. Dario Franchitti and Moreno qualified in the 22nd and 23rd positions, while Castroneves took 24th. Carpentier, who qualified in 25th, was observed speeding after he exited pit road and was limited to one lap time. On his run, he went up onto the track's dirty side in turn two and removed his foot from the accelerator pedal. Fernández qualified {{at the back of}} the grid in 26th position <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> his engine on the backstretch while {{on his second}} warm-up lap and stopped at the bottom of turn three. After qualifying,Tagliani said: [...] "The car is very fast, the team was very quick earlier this year at Michigan and we're looking good right now. We didn't expect to qualify that fast actually, but the car was free and it was great. I think we have a good shot to stay up front with that time." ...|$|E

500|$|The G2's {{exterior}} {{consists of}} a polycarbonate shell—unlike its predecessor, which used a glass-based construction. The rear cover is adorned with a subtle pattern resembling carbon fiber. The G2's volume and power keys are located directly below the camera on {{the rear of the}} device. The power button contains an LED lamp, which {{can be used as a}} notification light. The positioning of the buttons on the rear deviates from the majority of smartphones, where they are located on the bezel (side edge) of the phone. LG argued that buttons located on the bezel were harder to reach on larger smartphones, and made it more likely for users to drop their phone when adjusting the volume during a call. As such, the G2's buttons are instead located where the index finger would normally lie when the phone is held. Alongside the power button, the G2 is also [...] powered on by double-tapping on the screen, <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> by double-tapping on the status bar or a blank area on the home screen, a feature branded as [...] "KnockOn". When the phone is off, the volume keys can also be used to launch directly into the camera or QuickMemo applications by holding them down.|$|E

Prior to the extension, {{it was known}} as the Loyola-UPT Line <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> of Loyola Avenue to run along Canal Street to the river, and on weekends on the Riverfront line tracks to the French Market. The line no longer operates down Canal Street to the river, nor offers weekend service on the Riverfront line. The extension of the line to Elysian Fields Avenue {{was known as the}} French Quarter Rail Expansion and entailed building [...] of track with six sheltered stops, and with track laid in the street next to the neutral ground, like the track for the original 2013 portion of the line. Preparation for construction began in December 2014, and a groundbreaking ceremony was held January 28, 2015 to begin actual construction.|$|E
