5|$|Maya warriors entered {{battle against}} the Spanish with flint-tipped spears, bows <b>and</b> <b>arrows</b> and stones. They wore padded cotton armour to protect themselves.

5|$|The years 904–906 saw {{the use of}} {{incendiary}} projectiles called 'flying fires' (fei-huo). Needham (1986) {{argues that}} gunpowder was first used in warfare in China in 919 as a fuse for the ignition of another incendiary, Greek fire. Initially, gunpowder mixtures were utilised through traditional engines and throwing mechanisms; containers and grenades were thrown by mangonels and trebuchets, and explosive rockets <b>and</b> <b>arrows</b> were developed, along with gunpowder flamethrowers.|$|E
5|$|European {{visitors}} in 1667 reported the Sihanaka lived in fortified villages, which they very effectively defended with bows <b>and</b> <b>arrows.</b> They {{were the only}} ethnic group encountered by the European party that had built a bridge. Homes were made of plant material; the Sihanaka believed building homes in brick or clay would invite the displeasure of the ancestors. Gendered roles factored into house construction and maintenance: men applied carpentry to build {{the frame of the}} house and roof, as well as the windows and doors and their frames, while women wove zozoro reed mats that would serve as walls, flooring and roofing.|$|E
40|$|This thesis reexamines the {{adoption}} of the bow <b>and</b> <b>arrow</b> in the Eastern Woodlands. Archaeologists have usually relied on {{the size and shape of}} projectile points to help them determine when the bow <b>and</b> <b>arrow</b> was adopted, since the other parts of this complex system (e. g., the wooden bows <b>and</b> <b>arrow</b> shafts) do not survive well in the Eastern Woodlands. The current belief is that the bow <b>and</b> <b>arrow</b> was introduced during the Late Woodland period (AD 500) in the Eastern Woodlands. This is based on the wide spread use of small stone projectile points and on their continued use up to European contact. However, this small point technology was actually established during the Late Archaic period (2000 BC). A wide range of evidence is presented in this thesis that shows that the bow <b>and</b> <b>arrow</b> may have been adopted during the Late Archaic period and was well established during the Middle Woodland period (AD 100) in several Eastern Woodland states.

5|$|For millennia, archery {{has played}} a pivotal role in Chinese history. Because the {{cultures}} associated with Chinese society spanned a wide geography and time range, the techniques and equipment associated with Chinese archery are diverse. Historical sources and archaeological evidence suggest that a variety of bow designs existed throughout Chinese history. For much of the 20th century, only one Chinese traditional bow and arrow making workshop was active. However, {{in the beginning of the}} 21st century, there has been revival in interest among craftsmen looking to construct bows <b>and</b> <b>arrows</b> in the traditional Chinese style.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{have lived}} {{in what is now}} Pennsylvania since at least 10,000BC. The first {{settlers}} were Paleo-Indian nomadic hunters known from their stone tools. The hunter-gatherers of the Archaic period, which lasted locally from 7000to 1000BC, used a greater variety of more sophisticated stone artifacts. The Woodland period marked the gradual transition to semi-permanent villages and horticulture, between 1000BC and 1500AD. Archeological evidence found in the state from this time includes a range of pottery types and styles, burial mounds, pipes, bows <b>and</b> <b>arrows,</b> and ornaments.|$|E

5|$|Maya armies {{were highly}} disciplined, and warriors participated in regular {{training}} exercises and drills; every able-bodied adult male {{was available for}} military service. Maya states did not maintain standing armies; warriors were mustered by local officials who reported back to appointed warleaders. There were also units of full-time mercenaries who followed permanent leaders. Most warriors were not full-time, however, and were primarily farmers; {{the needs of their}} crops usually came before warfare. Maya warfare was not so much aimed at destruction of the enemy as the seizure of captives and plunder. Maya warriors entered battle against the Spanish with flint-tipped spears, bows <b>and</b> <b>arrows</b> and stones. They wore padded cotton armour to protect themselves. The Spanish described the weapons of war of the Petén Maya as bows <b>and</b> <b>arrows,</b> fire-sharpened poles, flint-headed spears and two-handed swords crafted from strong wood with the blade fashioned from inset obsidian, similar to the Aztec macuahuitl. Maya warriors wore body armour in the form of quilted cotton that had been soaked in salt water to toughen it; the resulting armour compared favourably to the steel armour worn by the Spanish. Warriors bore wooden or animal hide shields decorated with feathers and animal skins. The Maya had historically employed ambush and raiding as their preferred tactic, and its employment against the Spanish proved troublesome for the Europeans. In response to the use of cavalry, the highland Maya took to digging pits on the roads, lining them with fire-hardened stakes and camouflaging them with grass and weeds, a tactic that according to the Kaqchikel killed many horses.|$|E

This infuriates the Bunnokee medicine man, whose feather headdress business has declined as a result.

Using technology that is more advanced than the Bunnokee's bow <b>and</b> <b>arrows,</b> Popol defeats the rabbits' initial attacks, but they retaliate by abducting Virginia and threatening to torture her. Popol then rescues her, and together they escape, coming upon a river in which they discover gold.|$|E
