40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{the present}} {{research}} was to prepare new <b>acid</b> <b>dyes</b> based on naphthalimides. In this respect a series of monoazo <b>acid</b> <b>dyes</b> have been obtained using 4 -amino-N-methyl (alternatively N-butyl) - 1, 8 -naphthalimide, aniline and p-nitroaniline as diazo components. 2 -Naphthol- 6 -sulfonic acid (Schaeffer’s acid) and 1 -naphthol- 8 -amino- 3, 6 -disulfonic acid (H-acid) were used as coupling components. The spectrophotometric properties of the synthesized dyes were investigated in various solvents and compared with analogues azobenzene dyes. It is found, when <b>acid</b> <b>dyes</b> are applied in various solvents and different pH, additional bathochromically shifted bands of different intensity appear in the electronic spectra. This effect {{is caused by the}} occurrence of the equilibrium of azo and hydrazone forms in the <b>dyes.</b> The synthesized <b>acid</b> <b>dyes</b> were applied on wool fabrics in order to consider their dyeing properties, fastnesses and the obtainable color gamut.

50|$|Usually a red dye in dilute {{acetic acid}} is applied first to overstain all components. Then a {{polyacid}} {{is applied to}} remove the red dye from collagen and some other components by displacement. A second <b>acid</b> <b>dye</b> (blue or green) in dilute acetic acid is applied which, in turn, displaces the polyacid, resulting in collagen stained in a contrasting colour to the initial dye used. If erythrocytes are to be stained, a small molecular weight yellow or orange dye is applied before staining with the red dye. It is usually applied from a saturated solution in 80% ethanol and often in conjunction with picric acid (itself a dye) and a polyacid. The methods exploit minor differences in tissue reaction to dyes, density, accessibility and so on.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{adsorption}} of <b>acid</b> <b>dye</b> (Acid Orange 10), on {{a highly}} mesoporous activated carbon obtained from cotton boll pod by steam activation method {{was investigated in}} terms of size of dye molecule, pore size and surface charge of the activated carbon.

The sterically small sized <b>acid</b> <b>dye</b> adsorption capacities of cotton boll pod (rind) carbon (ACBPC) and commercial activated carbon (CAC) {{were found to be}} 182. 48 mg and 197. 63 mg per g of the adsorbent respectively. The amounts of <b>acid</b> <b>dye,</b> which is large in one or two dimensions of molecular structures, adsorbed on the mesoporous ACBPC was much more comparable than that on micro-porous CAC.

40|$|The exact {{mechanism}} by which the ordinary <b>acid</b> and basic <b>dyes</b> stain bacterial protoplasm {{is yet to be}} explained. The leading theories have been staining (1) by chemical union with the protoplasm, (2) by nonspecific physical adsorption onto surfaces, (3) by adsorption onto specific chemical sites, and (4) by solution in protoplasmic constituents. If staining reactions as a whole are considered, each of these theories will explain some particular case of staining. This paper is restricted in its scope to the staining of bacterial protoplasm by common basic and <b>acid</b> <b>dyes.</b> Perhaps the most widely accepted theory of bacterial staining was presented by Stearn and Stearn (1929, 1930), who showed that <b>acid</b> <b>dyes</b> stain bacterial cells best under acid conditions and basic dyes stain best under basic conditions. This was explained by the amphoteric nature of proteins; thus, <b>acid</b> <b>dyes</b> could react with amino groups, and basic dyes could react with carboxyl groups, de-pending on the particular state of ionization of the protein.
