5|$|Lin Yutang's Chinese-English Dictionary of Modern Usage (1972) {{incorporated}} {{a number of}} innovative features, {{one of which was}} a simplified version of GR. Lin eliminated most of the spelling rules requiring substitution of vowels, <b>as</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> from his spelling Guoryuu Romatzyh, in which the regular -r is used for T2 and a doubled vowel for T3.|$|E

5|$|A {{peculiar}} {{feature of}} Muslim castles in the Iberian Peninsula {{was the use}} of detached towers, called Albarrana towers, around the perimeter <b>as</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> at the Alcazaba of Badajoz. Probably developed in the 12thcentury, the towers provided flanking fire. They were connected to the castle by removable wooden bridges, so if the towers were captured the rest of the castle was not accessible.|$|E
5|$|According to De ponderibus et mensuris, {{a famous}} 13th century text {{that exists in}} {{numerous}} variations and is often ascribed to Dino di Garbo, the system of weights used in Salerno {{was different from the}} systems used in Padua and Bologna. <b>As</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> from the table, it was also different from the Roman weight system used by Galenus and Dioscorides and from all modern apothecaries' systems: The ounce was divided into 9drachms, rather than 8drachms.|$|E
5|$|An early {{structural}} {{application of}} the Pythagorean tiling appears {{in the works of}} Leonardo da Vinci, who considered it among several other potential patterns for floor joists. This tiling has also long been used decoratively, for floor tiles or other similar patterns, <b>as</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> for instance in Jacob Ochtervelt's painting Street Musicians at the Doorway of a House (1665). It has been suggested that seeing a similar tiling in the palace of Polycrates may have provided Pythagoras with the original inspiration for his theorem.|$|E
30|$|From the {{viewpoint}} of computational time, <b>as</b> <b>can</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> from Figure 4, K-cluster-valued CS runs faster than conventional CS when cluster number K is small (e.g., K = 2, 5 and 10). It {{may be due to}} the fast convergence of K-cluster-valued CoSaMP caused by more accurate recovery result at each iteration.|$|R

5|$|From the 11th century, newly {{incorporated}} {{features were}} either {{based on the}} traditional dravida plan of the Badami Chalukyas, as found in the Virupaksha and Mallikarjuna Temples at Pattadakal, or were further elaborations of this articulation. The new features produced a closer juxtaposition of architectural components, visible as a more crowded decoration, <b>as</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> in the Mallikarjuna Temple at Sudi in the Gadag district and the Amrtesvara Temple at Annigeri in the Dharwad district.|$|E
5|$|Just {{like the}} many uses of plasma, {{there are several}} means for its generation, however, one {{principle}} is common to all of them: there must be energy input to produce and sustain it. For this case, plasma is generated when an electric current is applied across a dielectric gas or fluid (an electrically non-conducting material) <b>as</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> in the adjacent image, which shows a discharge tube as a simple example (DC used for simplicity).|$|E

5|$|Much {{uncertainty}} remains, especially {{regarding the}} size of limitanei regiments, <b>as</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> by the wide ranges of the size estimates. It is also possible, if not likely, that unit strengths changed {{over the course of}} the 4th century. For example, it appears that Valentinian I split about 150 comitatus units with his brother and co-emperor Valens. The resulting units may have been just half the strength of the parent units (unless a major recruitment drive was held to bring them all up to original strength).|$|E
5|$|Neoclassicism or {{increasingly}} Nordic Classicism {{continued to}} thrive {{at the beginning}} of the century until about 1930 <b>as</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> in Kay Fisker's Hornbækhus apartment buildings (1923) and Hack Kampmann's police headquarters (1924). Its development was no isolated phenomenon, drawing on existing classical traditions in the Nordic countries, and from new ideas being pursued in German-speaking cultures. It can thus be characterised as a combination of direct and indirect influences from vernacular architecture (Nordic, Italian and German) and Neoclassicism.|$|E

5|$|There {{is also a}} great {{difference}} between English and Scottish historiography on King Edward. G. W. S. Barrow, in his biography on Robert the Bruce, accused Edward of ruthlessly exploiting the leaderless state of Scotland to obtain a feudal superiority over the kingdom. This view of Edward is reflected in the popular perception of the King, <b>as</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> in the 1995 movie Bravehearts portrayal of the King as a hard-hearted tyrant.|$|E
5|$|Although ecplised by Scots Baronial and Gothic forms, Neo-classicism {{continued}} to be a major style into the nineteenth century. William Henry Playfair (1790–1857) was the designer of many of Edinburgh's neoclassical landmarks in the New Town. Two of his finest works are the National Gallery of Scotland and the Royal Scottish Academy, which are situated in the centre of Edinburgh. However, the figure most associated with the classical style was Alexander 'Greek' Thomson (1817–75). Working mainly in Glasgow, he turned away from the Gothic style toward that of the ancient Greeks and Egyptians, <b>as</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> in the temple and columns that were part of the Caledonia Road Church (1856).|$|E
5|$|Early on, manning {{a castle}} was a feudal duty of vassals to their magnates, and magnates to their kings, however this was later {{replaced}} with paid forces. A garrison was usually commanded by a constable whose peace-time role {{would have been}} looking after the castle in the owner's absence. Under him would have been knights who by benefit of their military training would have acted {{as a type of}} officer class. Below them were archers and bowmen, whose role was to prevent the enemy reaching the walls <b>as</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> by the positioning of arrowslits.|$|E

5|$|Other artists {{influenced}} by modernism included James McIntosh Patrick (1907–98) and Edward Baird (1904–49). Both trained in Glasgow, but {{spent most of}} their careers in and around their respective native cities of Dundee and Montrose. Both were {{influenced by}} surrealism and the work of Bruegel. They focused on landscape, <b>as</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> in McIntosh Patrick's Traquair House (1938) and more overtly Baird's The Birth of Venus (1934). Before his success in painting, McIntosh Patrick gained a reputation as an etcher. Leading figures in the field in the inter-war period included William Wilson (1905–72) and Ian Fleming (1906–94).|$|E
5|$|Reptiles {{evolved from}} amphibious {{ancestors}} which left the aquatic lifestyle and became terrestrial. To prevent loss of moisture reptilian skin lost the softness and moisture of amphibian skin {{and developing a}} thick stratum corneum with multiple layers of lipids which served as an impermeable barrier as well as provided protection from the ultraviolet. Over time, reptilian skin cells became highly keratinised, horny, sturdy and desiccated. The surfaces of the dermis and epidermis of all reptilian scales form a single contiguous sheet, <b>as</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> when the snake sheds its skin as a whole.|$|E
