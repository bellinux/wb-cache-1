This study aimed to learn senescent profile {{and its relation to}} cell viability, proliferation and cell size in various passages, which were done in α-MEM- 10 % PRP medium, until senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-Gal) positive cells were found. Stem cells were isolated from umbilical cord tissue by multiple harvest explant method, cultured in α-MEM- 10 % PRP until P- 17 and stained using SA-β-Gal staining. Viability, Population Doubling Time (PDT), percentage SA-β-Gal (+) and cell size <b>at</b> <b>30</b> % confluent and at senescent staining were analyzed. Passages with SA-β-Gal (+) and (-) were compared in term of viability, PDT and cell size <b>at</b> <b>30</b> % confluent. Further, cell size at senescent staining between SA-β-Gal (+) and (-) groups were compared. Viability and PDT showed no significant difference between SA-β-Gal (+) and (-) groups, while cell size <b>at</b> <b>30</b> % <b>confluence</b> showed significant increase in SA-β-Gal (+) compared to (-) groups. Further, cell size in senescent staining showed significantly smaller cell size in SA-β-Gal (-) compared to SA-β-Gal (+) cells. Moreover, this study showed that even in SA-β-Gal (+) group, viability was greater than 91 %, PDT was less than 2. 1 days and cell size was less than 2602 µm 2. In conclusion, umbilical cord derived MSCs that were cultured in α-MEM- 10 % PRP began to undergo aging at P- 10. Morphological criteria of UC-MSC aging were cell size greater than 2602 µm 2 with a change in morphology toward a rounded shape...|$|R

Results significantly favoured CEA over CAS in terms of death or any stroke <b>at</b> <b>30</b> days after procedure; the risk of death, any stroke, or myocardial infarction <b>at</b> <b>30</b> days; ipsilateral ischaemic stroke <b>at</b> <b>30</b> days; any stroke <b>at</b> <b>30</b> days; death or stroke at 6 months; and the risk of procedural failure.

40|$|Surface glycoconjugates {{of cells}} from the basal layer of {{the skin of the}} newborn rat bind the isolectin I-B 4 from Griffonia simplicifolia (GS I-B 4) (α-D-galactosyl specificity). Surface glycoconjugates of the {{differentiated}} {{cells from the}} spinous and lower granular layers bind Ulex europeus agglutinin I (UEA) (α-L-fucosyl specificity). The change from GS I-B 4 binding to UEA binding was studied in rat keratinocytes that were cultured as a monolayer in low-calcium medium until confluence, and then induced to stratify and terminally differentiate by raising the calcium concentration of the medium. The cells in the monolayer had basal cell morphology and exhibited surface binding of GS I-B 4. However, <b>at</b> <b>confluence,</b> <b>30</b> - 40 % of these cells also showed surface binding of UEA. There was an increase with time in the number of cells which bound both GS I-B 4 and UBA. Raising the calcium concentration of the medium resulted in an increase in UEA binding. Cells of the upper layers of the stratifying cultures showed intense UEA binding but did not show any CS I-B 4 binding. Double staining of frozen sections of newborn rat skin with fluorescein-conjugated GS I-B 4 and rhodamine-conjugated UEA revealed that the surfaces of cells from the lower spinous layer bound both lectins. Thirty percent of the major glycoprotein fraction, that was isolated from the membranes of the epidermal cells of the newborn rat and was bound to an affinity column of UEA-Sepharose 4 B, was also bound to an affinity column of GS I-B 4 -Sepharose 4 B. These results indicate that (1) surface glycoconjugates of rat keratinocytes differentiating in culture exhibit a change from GS I-B 4 binding to UEA binding; (2) the change in the cell surface glycoconjugates that results in the appearance of UEA binding, a feature of differentiated cells, occurs independently of stratification; and (3) the change from GS 1 B 4 binding to UEA binding probably involves an “intermediate” glycoconjugate that binds both GS I-B 4 and UEA and is found on the surface of cells from the lower spinous layer of the epidermis of the newborn rat...|$|R

This enzyme induced <b>at</b> <b>30</b> ℃ hydrolyzed colorimetric substrate, α-ONPG <b>at</b> <b>30</b> ℃ and 37 ℃. On the other hand, lactose induced α-galactosidase at both temperatures. These findings suggested that the temperature sensitivity of melibiose metabolism was not due to the induction and/or function of α-galactosidase.
