5|$|In 1889, Adams {{broke the}} world record run for {{successive}} straight rail points in a match with champion player Jacob Schaefer, Sr., in which Adams scored 4,962 counts in a row, which was 2,400 points more than any prior competition high run, albeit with his fingers rather than with a cue. Adams stated in <b>an</b> <b>interview</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> later years that his personal high run was 6,900 consecutive straight rail counts.|$|E
25|$|In the 2009–10 season, Biedriņš {{appeared}} in only 33 games, starting 29, and {{was limited to}} 23.1 minutes per game, his lowest since his second season in the league (2005–2006). Injuries played a big role, as he was derailed with back and groin ailments that made him miss {{weeks at a time}} before he finally had groin surgery on March 10, ending his season. Biedriņš' free-throw percentage had dropped from 62% in 2007–2008 to 55.1% in 2008–2009; in 2009–2010, he shot an appalling four-for-25 (16%). His other numbers dropped precipitously as well – five points, 7.8 rebounds and 1.3 blocks per game after career-highs in all these stats in 2008–2009. Additionally, Warriors' coach Don Nelson repeatedly criticized Biedriņš for his lack of intensity and aggressiveness in his time on the floor. Biedriņš capped of the off season by criticizing the team during <b>an</b> <b>interview</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> native Latvia.|$|E
2500|$|Because the British Army {{sponsored}} {{his university}} education, Blunt {{was obliged to}} serve a minimum of {{four years in the}} armed forces. He stated on <b>an</b> <b>interview</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> Back to Bedlam sessions that he chose to join the military as his father was [...] "pushing for it, so that [...] could obtain a secure work placement and income". Blunt trained at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. While still in the army, he worked on demos during his time off. A backing vocalist and songwriting collaborator suggested he contact Elton John's manager Todd Interland, with whom she used to share a house. Interland told HitQuarters that he listened to Blunt's demo while driving home and after hearing the track [...] "Goodbye My Lover", pulled over and called the mobile number written on the CD to set up a meeting.|$|E

2500|$|Marcos wanted Aquino to {{stay out}} of politics, however Aquino {{asserted}} his willingness to suffer the consequences declaring, [...] "the Filipino is worth dying for." [...] He wished to express an earnest plea for Marcos to step down, for a peaceful regime change and a return to democratic institutions. Anticipating the worst, at <b>an</b> <b>interview</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> suite at the Taipei Grand Hotel, he revealed that he would be wearing a bullet-proof vest, but he also said that [...] "it's only good for the body, but in the head there's nothing else we can do." [...] Sensing his own doom, he told the journalists accompanying him on the flight, [...] "You have to be very ready with your hand camera because this action can become very fast. In a matter of a three or four minutes it could be all over, you know, and [...] I {{may not be able to}} talk to you again after this." [...] His last televised interview, with journalist Jim Laurie, took place on the flight just prior to his assassination.|$|E
6000|$|He {{was lying}} in a sunny room one {{afternoon}} when two gentlemen were shown in.

6000|$|Mr. Wesley had {{requested}} <b>an</b> <b>interview</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> study, {{especially as the}} Jacobite goblin routed loudly [...] "over our heads constantly, {{when we came to}} the prayers for King George and the prince". In his study the agency pushed Mr. Wesley about, bumping him against the corner of his desk, and against his door. He would ask for a conversation, but heard only [...] "two or three feeble squeaks, a little louder than the chirping of a bird, but not like the noise of rats, which I have often heard".|$|E

5000|$|Jarmusch {{has been}} {{characterized}} as a minimalist filmmaker whose idiosyncratic films are unhurried.

60|$|The {{following}} forenoon the liveryman at the Junction {{brought to}} Millville a passenger {{who had arrived}} by the morning train--a quiet, boyish-looking man with a shock of brick-red hair and a thin, freckled face. He was driven directly to the Merrick farm, where Uncle John received him cordially, but with surprise, and at once favored the new arrival with <b>a</b> long <b>interview</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> private room.|$|R
6000|$|There Sir Edward {{called on}} him, and in <b>an</b> <b>interview</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> sitting-room {{at the office}} asked him to a quiet dinner, {{together}} with the solicitor; but this was hardly a success, for Mr. Burford, being {{at home with the}} family, did all the talking, and Frank could not but feel in the presence of his master, and had not a word to say for himself, especially as George and Freda looked critical, and as if 'That stick' was in their minds, if not on their lips. The only time when he approached a thaw was when in the hot summer evening Lady Kenton made him her companion in a twilight stroll on the terraces, when he looked at the roses with delight, and volunteered a question about the best sorts, saying that the garden at Northmoor had been much neglected, and he wanted to have it in good order, 'that is'--blushing and correcting himself--'if we can live there.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Not till 21st December did Mr. Wesley hear anything, {{then came}} thumpings on his bedroom wall. Unable to {{discover}} the cause, he procured a stout mastiff, which soon became demoralised by his experiences. On {{the morning of the}} 24th, about seven o'clock, Emily led Mrs. Wesley into the nursery, where she heard knocks on and under the bedstead; these sounds replied when she knocked. Something [...] "like a badger, with no head," [...] says Emily; Mrs. Wesley only says, [...] "like a badger," [...] ran from under the bed. On the night of the 25th there was an appalling vacarme. Mr. and Mrs. Wesley went on a tour of inspection, but only found the mastiff whining in terror. [...] "We still heard it rattle and thunder in every room above or behind us, locked as well as open, except my study, where as yet it never came." [...] On the night of the 26th Mr. Wesley seems to have heard of a phenomenon already familiar to Emily--"something like the quick winding up of a jack, {{at the corner of the}} room by my bed head". This was always followed by knocks, [...] "hollow and loud, such as none of us could ever imitate". Mr. Wesley went into the nursery, Hetty, Kezzy and Patty were asleep. The knocks were loud, beneath and in the room, so Mr. Wesley went below to the kitchen, struck with his stick against the rafters, and was answered [...] "as often and as loud as I knocked". The peculiar knock which was his own, 1-23456-7, was not successfully echoed at that time. Mr. Wesley then returned to the nursery, which was as tapageuse as ever. The children, three, were trembling in their sleep. Mr. Wesley invited the agency to <b>an</b> <b>interview</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> study, was answered by one knock outside, [...] "all the rest were within," [...] and then came silence. Investigations outside produced no result, but the latch of the door would rise and fall, and the door itself was pushed violently back against investigators.|$|E

[...] I'm a Mormon Campaign's principal purpose, Allen said, is to “dispel the myths and misperceptions’’ about Mormons, a critical task for a religion that considers proselytizing an ecclesiastical mandate. “Our motivator was, how do we help these young missionaries who are donating two years of their time and paying their own way and working their guts out overcome some of the obstacles, so they can share their message more openly?’’ said Allen in <b>an</b> <b>interview</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> Temple Square office last week.|$|E
