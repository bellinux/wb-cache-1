In case of high risk side effects, e. g. therapies with interfering <b>anti-cancer</b> <b>molecule</b> cocktails, direct monitoring of the patient’s drugs metabolism is essential as the metabolic pathways efficacy is highly variable on a patient-bypatient basis. Currently, there are no fully mature point-of-care bio-sensing systems for drugs metabolism monitoring directly in blood. The aim of the paper is to investigate solutions to develop point-of-care systems for drugs monitoring in personalized therapy.

To further improve their viral oncolysis, experimental strategies are now combining OVs with different cytotoxic compounds. In the current study, we investigated {{the capacity of}} triptolide - a natural <b>anti-cancer</b> <b>molecule</b> - to enhance vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) oncolysis in OV-resistant cancer cells. Triptolide treatment increased VSV replication in the human prostate cancer cell line PC 3 and in other VSV-resistant cells in a dose and time-dependent manner in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, TPL inhibited the innate antiviral response by blocking the type I interferon (IFN) signaling, downstream of IRF 3 activation. Furthermore, triptolide enhanced VSVinduced apoptosis in a dose dependent fashion in VSV-resistant cells, as measured by annexin-V, cleaved caspase- 3 and B-cell lymphoma 2 staining. In vivo, using the TSA and PC 3 mouse xenograft models, combination treatment with VSV and triptolide delayed tumor growth and prolonged survival of tumorbearing animals by enhancing viral replication.

Accordingly, we investigated the efficacy of an innovative new multi-functional targeted <b>anti-cancer</b> <b>molecule,</b> SM 7 L, using models of the lethal brain tumor Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Designed using predictive computer modeling, SM 7 L incorporates the therapeutic activity of the promising anti-tumor cytokine MDA- 7 /IL- 24, an enhanced secretory domain, and diagnostic domain for non-invasive tracking. In vitro assays revealed the diagnostic domain of SM 7 L produced robust photon emission, while the therapeutic domain showed marked anti-tumor efficacy and significant modulation of p 38 MAPK and ERK pathways. In vivo, the unique multi-functional nature of SM 7 L allowed simultaneous real-time monitoring of both SM 7 L delivery and anti-tumor efficacy. Utilizing engineered stem cells as novel delivery vehicles for SM 7 L therapy (SC-SM 7 L), we demonstrate that SC-SM 7 L significantly improved pharmacokinetics and attenuated progression of established peripheral and intracranial human GBM xenografts. Furthermore, SC-SM 7 L anti-tumor efficacy was augmented in vitro and in vivo by concurrent activation of caspase-mediated apoptosis induced by adjuvant SC-mediated S-TRAIL delivery.

Furthermore, it is now apparent that cells dynamically regulate the structure of their heparan sulfate “coat” to differentially regulate extracellular signals. In the present study, the importance of sequence information contained within tumor cell-surface heparan sulfate was investigated.

40|$|The most {{exciting}} promise of cell micro-bioreactors is their expected ability to reproduce {{specific aspects of}} physiological environments in vitro, singularly or in combination, and to perform advanced biological studies to unravel novel interaction mechanisms; but this challenge is formidable. Moreover, the use of microfluidics {{is limited by the}} difficulty to adapt standard tissue culture protocols to miniaturised biochips and by the need of bulky external equipment such as liquid pumping systems. Here, we introduce an original microfluidic gradient generator for culturing cells in closed microchambers, based on: (1) automatic cell valving, (2) hydrostatic-pressure pumping, and (3) on-chip liquid reservoirs. The biochip is designed to be fully compatible with standard biological procedures and to operate with no external control units or cumbersome ancillary components. Remarkably, the use of integrated liquid reservoirs prevents air bubble formation and associated channel clogging. We detail the rationale behind the fluidic design, simulate and measure the chip fluid-dynamics by finite element simulations and microflow velocimetry, respectively. We finally exploit our chip to study the kinetics of an <b>anti-cancer</b> <b>molecule,</b> the catechin-dextran conjugate, on HeLa cells, demonstrating a very fast action.

MethodsThe cytotoxicity of the methanolic extract of G.  applanatum was tested on MDA-MB- 231  cells, HEp- 2  cells and Vero cells by microculture tetrazolium (MTT) assay. The anti-cancer properties of G.  applanatum were characterized using gas chromatography coupled with gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GCMS) analysis. ResultsThe methanolic extract of G.  applanatum elicited dose-dependent cell death on both MDA-MB- 231 and HEp- 2  cells after 24  h of treatment, with an IC 50 value of 84. 6  μg/ml and 43. 2  μg/ml, respectively. Normal vero cells {{were able to}} significantly withstand the treatment. Furthermore, seven molecules were identified from G.  applanatum by GCMS analysis, and five of them were present in considerable amounts, namely, γ-terpinene (30. 3 %), d-limonene (23. 6 %), cis- 2 -methyl- 4 -pentylthiane-s,s-dioxide (15. 3 %), β-cymene (12. 7 %) and α-terpinolene (8. 1 %). ConclusionIn this study, surprisingly, G.  applanatum exhibited toxicity particularly towards tumour cells (MDA-MB- 231 and HEp- 2) compared to normal vero cells. This tumour-specific chemo-sensitivity of G.  applanatum is unclear, and the mechanism of cancer cell death induced by G.  applanatum should be studied in detail. In addition, the observed anti-cancer activity of G.  applanatum {{might be due to}} the synergistic effects of the identified properties. This would pave the way for isolation and characterization of the potential <b>anti-cancer</b> <b>molecule</b> from Oman's G.  applanatum...|$|E

At {{each step of the}} purification process the different fractions that were isolated were tested for specific anti-proliferative activity by assays measuring the inhibition of [3 H]thymidine incorporation, and trypan blue drug exclusion. The ethyl acetate fraction that contained the bioactivity was further purified and resolved by HPLC on a preparative column. The purity of each of the fractions and their bioactivity were checked. Fraction 3 demonstrated a single spot on TLC and showed maximum anti-proliferative activity. This fraction was further purified and the structure was defined as 7 ′-hydroxy- 3 ′, 4 ′, 5, 9, 9 ′-pentamethoxy- 3, 4 -methylene dioxy lignan using NMR and mass spectrometry analysis. The pure compound and the crude ethyl acetate fraction which showed anti-proliferative activities were examined for ability to target specific markers of apoptosis like bcl 2, c-myc and caspases and for effects on telomerase. Four specific cancer cell lines HEp 2, EL- 1 monocytes, HeLa and MCP 7 were used in this study. The results indicate that 7 ′-hydroxy- 3 ′, 4 ′, 5, 9, 9 ′-pentamethoxy- 3, 4 -methylene dioxy lignan was capable of inhibiting telomerase activity and also could inhibit bcl 2 and activate caspase 3 and caspase 8 whose significance in the induction of apoptosis is well known.

40|$|The {{involvement}} of microRNAs in human pathologies is a firmly established fact.

40|$|Abstract: Epidemiological {{studies have}} linked dietary {{consumption}} of plant polyphenols with lower incidence of various cancers. In particular, flavonoids (present in onion, tomato and other plant sources) induce apoptosis and cytotoxicity in cancer cells. These {{can therefore be}} used as lead compounds for the synthesis of novel anticancer drugs with greater bioavailability. In the present study, we examined the chemical basis of cytotoxicity of flavonoids by studying the structure–activity relationship of myricetin (MN), fisetin (FN), quercetin (QN), kaempferol (KL) and galangin (GN). Using single cell alkaline gel electrophoresis (comet assay), we established the relative efficiency of cellular DNA breakage as MN> FN> QN> KL> GN. Also, we determined that the cellular DNA breakage {{was the result of}} mobilization of chromatin-bound copper ions and the generation of reactive oxygen species. The relative DNA binding affinity order was further confirmed using molecular docking and thermodynamic studies through the interaction of flavonoids with calf thymus DNA. Our results suggest that novel <b>anti-cancer</b> <b>molecules</b> should have ortho-dihydroxy groups in B-ring and hydroxyl groups at positions 3 and 5 in the A-ring system.

Uptake of vincristine and fatty acids was higher while their efflux was lower in KB- 3 - 1 cells compared with KB-ChR- 8 - 5 cells, suggesting that drug resistant cells have an effective efflux pump. GLA, DGLA, AA, EPA and DHA enhanced the uptake and decreased efflux in both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cells and augmented the susceptibility of tumor cells especially, of drug-resistant cells to the cytotoxic action of vincristine. These results suggest that certain polyunsaturated fatty acids have tumoricidal action and are capable of enhancing the cytotoxic action of anti-cancer drugs specifically, on drug-resistant cells by enhancing drug uptake and reducing its efflux.

The highest number of regenerated shoots per ex-plant (35 ± 3. 25) and the maximum average shoot length (5. 0 ± 0. 25 cm) were recorded on MS medium supplemented with BA (5. 0 μM). The shoots were further proliferated in half and full strength MS liquid medium supplemented with the same concentration BA. It was interesting to note that shoots cultured on MS half strength liquid medium fortified with 4 gL- 1 FW (fresh weight) shoot inoculum mass derived from 5 week old nodal explants of W. somnifera showed highest accumulation of biomass and withaferin A content in 5 weeks. Withaferin A was produced in relatively high amounts (1. 30 % and 1. 10 % DW) in shoots cultured in half and full strength MS liquid media respectively as compared to natural field grown plants (0. 85 % DW).

40|$|Terpenoids are a {{large and}} diverse group of {{secondary}} metabolites which natively play essential biochemical roles, and have been adopted {{for a wide range}} of uses by humans. These molecules are of interest scientifically due to their often complex structures, as well as commercially, with market value exceeding $ 50 billion annually. Many of these compounds are derived from natural sources, such as plants, which are prone to long life cycles, low productivity, as well as climate and market variability. As such, production in heterologous microbial systems through metabolic engineering stands as an attractive alternative to truly natural production and allows for increased control over biosynthetic pathways enabling improved yields, titer, and productivity. The <b>anti-cancer</b> <b>molecule</b> Taxol (Paclitaxel) stands as one of the most medically and economically important terpenoids. However, despite decades of extensive study, its biosynthesis remains poorly understood. In this work we report on investigations into the reconstruction of the early Taxol bioysnthetic pathway. Early successes toward pathway reconstitution within E. coli and S. cerevisiae led to the identification of an early bottleneck, identified to arise from unpredictable behavior of the first oxygenation enzyme, taxadiene- 5 o-hydroxylase (CYP 725 A 4), which produces a range of undesired products. We present chemical and biological evidence of an unreported epoxidase activity of taxadiene- 5 a-hydroxylase that puts into question the previously proposed radical-rebound mechanism. We demonstrate that the poor selectivity of taxadiene- 5 o-hydroxylase arises from the non-selective degradation of an epoxide intermediate produced via a selective oxidation step, rather than from promiscuous oxidation, as previously proposed. We support these conclusions by demonstrating variable enzyme behavior in differing hosts and conditions, similarity of products and product ratios generated from chemical epoxidation and by taxadiene- 5 a-hydroxylase, and differing enzymatic activity on alternative taxadiene isomers. We next systematically investigate three methodologies, terpene cyclase engineering, P 450 engineering, and hydrolase-enzyme screening to overcome this early pathway selectivity bottleneck. We demonstrate that engineering of taxadiene synthase, upstream of the promiscuous oxidation step, acts as a practical methodology for selectivity improvement. Through mutagenesis we achieve a 2. 4 -fold improvement in yield and selectivity for an alternative cyclization product, taxa- 4 (20) - 11 (12) -diene; and for the Taxol precursor taxadien- 5 a-ol, when co-expressed with CYP 725 A 4. This work lays the foundation for the elucidation, engineering, and improved production of Taxol and early Taxol precursors. In addition to bottlenecks in the downstream production of terpenoids such as Taxol, upstream flux derived from the microbial methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway also imposes limitations on culture productivity and titer. Thus, efforts were also focused on developing alternative biosynthetic routes to terpenoids. This led to the investigation of a novel route, which relies on phosphorylation of the bulk chemical feedstock isopentenol, to generate isopentenyl disphosphate (IPP), the building block of all terpenoids. Following proofs-of-concept experiments demonstrating pathway functionality, we turned our attention to methodologies to improve flux through this pathway. As few high-throughput methodologies for the quantification of terpenoid production have been previously described, this led to the development of a genetically-encoded terpenoid-responsive biosensor. Furthermore, we develop theoretical framework and proof-of concepts for the application of evolution-based approaches to the optimization of the pathway. by Steven McBride Edgar. Thesis: Ph.

Furthermore, through the screening of established small <b>anti-cancer</b> <b>molecules</b> in the EGFR mutant NSCLC HCC 827 cell line and a corresponding mesenchymal derivative cell line, Wilson et al. found that dasatinib, an Abl/Src inhibitor, was a potential candidate for treatment of erlotinib resistance associated with EMT (Wilson et al., 2014).

The candidate agent Salinomycin can lead to the loss of expression of breast cancer stem cell genes in patients (Gupta et al., 2009). However, recent research shows that non-cancer stem cells have the potential to dedifferentiate into cancer stem cells (Chaffer et al., 2011). A major limitation to the use of agents with CSC-specific toxicity is the possibility for the non-stem cells to convert into cancer stem cells. However, further research may identify new strategies to overcome these conflicts, such as finding new agents targeting both cancer stem cells and non-stem cells, or drugs specifically point to non-cancer stem cells and cancer stem cells respectively (Gupta et al., 2009).|$|R
40|$|Background: G-quadruplex DNA {{structures}} are hypothesized {{to be involved}} in the regulation of gene expression and telomere homeostasis. The development of small molecules that modulate the stability of G-quadruplex structures has a potential therapeutic interest in cancer treatment and prevention of aging. Methods: Molecular absorption and circular dichroism spectra were used to monitor thermal denaturation, acid base titration and mole ratio experiments. The resulting data were analyzed by multivariate data analysis methods. Surface plasmon resonance was also used to probe the kinetics and affinity of the DNA-drug interactions. Results: We investigated the interaction between a G-quadruplex-forming sequence in the human c-kit proto-oncogene and the water soluble porphyrin TMPyP 4. The role of cytosine and adenine residues at the loops of G-quadruplex was studied by substitution of these residues by thymidines. Conclusions: Here, we show the existence of two binding modes between TMPyP 4 and the considered G-quadruplex. The stronger binding mode (formation constant around 107) involves end-stacking, while the weaker binding mode (formation constant around 106) is probably due to external loop binding. Evidence for the release of TMPyP 4 upon protonation of bases at the loops has been observed. General significance: The results may be used for the design of porphyrin-based <b>anti-cancer</b> <b>molecules</b> with a higher affinity to G-quadruplex structures which may have anticancer properties. © 2012 Elsevier B.

40|$|Antiproliferative {{activity}} of methanolic extracts from two green algae, Enteromorpha intestinalis and Rizoclonium riparium on HeLa cells Subhabrata Paul and Rita Kundu* Background: Natural compounds can be alternative sources for finding new lead <b>anti-cancer</b> <b>molecules.</b> Marine algae {{have been a}} traditional source for bioactive compounds. Enteromorpha intestinalis and Rhizoclonium riparium are two well distributed saline/brackish water algae from Sundarbans. There’s no previous report of these two for their anti-proliferative activities. Methods: Cytotoxicity of the algal methanolic extracts (AMEs) on HeLa cells were assayed by 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 - diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) reduction assay. Morphological examinations were done by Haematoxylin, Hoechst 33258 and Acridine orange staining. DNA fragmentation was checked. Gene expressions of Cysteine aspartate protease (Caspase) 3, Tumor protein (TP) 53, Bcl- 2 associated protein X (Bax) were studied by Reverse transcription- polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) keeping Glyceraldehyde 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as internal control. Protein expressions were studied for Caspase 3, phospho-p 53, Bax, Microtubule associated proteins- 1 / light chain B (MAP 1 /LC 3 B) by western blot. Results: The AMEs {{were found to be}} cytotoxic with Inhibitory concentration 50 (IC 50) values 309. 048 ± 3. 083 μg/ml and 506. 081 ± 3. 714 μg/ml for E. intestinalis and R. riparium extracts respectively. Treated cells became round with blebbings with condensed nuclei. Acidic lysosomal vacuoles formation occurred in treated cells. Expression of apoptotic genes in both mRNA and protein level was lowered. Expression of LC 3 B-II suggested occurrence of autophagy in treated cells. Conclusions: These two algae can be potent candidates for isolating new lead anticancer molecules. So they need further characterization at both molecular and structural levels...|$|R
40|$|Food-grade dairy propionibacteria are {{nutraceutical}} producers. They release short chain {{fatty acids}} (SCFAs), folic acid and cobalamin, which {{play a role}} in intestinal physiology. SCFAs induce apoptosis via the mitochondrial death pathway. We investigated the potential of dairy propionibacteria-fermented products to synergize with drugs used in gastric and colorectal cancer. Fermented milk contained high and viable populations of propionibacteria. This product, as well as its cell-free supernatant, were tested in vitro on gastric HGT- 1 and colic HT- 29 cells with respect to apoptosis and synergy with known <b>anti-cancer</b> <b>molecules,</b> camptothecin and the human cytokine TRAIL (TNF Related Apoptosis Inducing Ligand). Viability was monitored and apoptosis quantified by Hoescht staining, ROS production, mitochondrial membrane potential perturbation and caspases activity assay. A transcriptomic study on genome-wide microarray was performed in collaboration with the company Miltenyi. Fermented milk induced cell death in both gastric and colon cancer cells. Characterization of cells revealed cell cycle arrest, drop in intracellular ATP, depolarization of mitochondria, translocation of key apoptosis proteins, processing of caspases and fragmentation of the nucleus. Interestingly, the fermented milk was shown to potentiate the cytotoxic effect of molecules used in cancer chemotherapy, camptothecin and TRAIL. The observed synergistic pro-apoptotic effect between TRAIL and propionibacterial SCFAs depended on death receptors and on caspases, was more lethal on cancer cells than on normal human intestinal epithelial cells (HIEC), and was inhibited by Bcl- 2 expression. Transcriptomics revealed that propionibacterial metabolites boosted TRAIL-induced modulation of gene expression in human colon cancer cells. These results open new perspectives in the field of colon cancer cells prevention and/or treatment. The synergy with pro-apoptotic chemotherapy molecules suggests that such a fermented product, or the propionibacterium alone, may be proposed as a food supplement to enhance the effects of anticancer treatments...|$|R

40|$|Bilitranslocase (BTL) is a organic anion {{transporter}} {{expressed in}} liver {{and in several}} extra-hepatic tissues. This membrane protein transports different substrates as pyrrolic molecules, nucleotides, flavonoids. Anthocyanins, {{one of the most}} represented flavonoids class are known to have antioxidant activity. They act as anti-inflammatory, <b>anti-cancer</b> and anti-proliferative <b>molecules</b> by interfering with different intracellular pathways. Some chronic colon diseases results in an increase in the pro-inflammatory machinery that are associated with a 5 -fold increased risk of developing colon cancer.

Since EMT-induced motility and invasion {{play a critical}} role in cancer metastasis, EMT-related molecules are emerging as novel targets of anti-cancer therapies. Traf 2 - and Nck-interacting kinase (TNIK) has recently been considered as a first-in-class <b>anti-cancer</b> target <b>molecule</b> to regulate Wnt signaling pathway, but pharmacologic inhibition of its EMT activity has not yet been studied. Here, using 5 -(4 -methylbenzamido) - 2 -(phenylamino) thiazole- 4 -carboxamide (KY- 05009) with TNIK-inhibitory activity, its efficacy to inhibit EMT in cancer cells was validated. The molecular docking/binding study revealed the binding of KY- 05009 in the hinge region of TNIK, and the inhibitory activity of KY- 05009 against TNIK was confirmed by an ATP competition assay (Ki, 100 nM). In A 549 cells, KY- 05009 significantly and strongly inhibited the TGF-b-activated EMT through the attenuation of Smad and non-Smad signaling pathways, including the Wnt, NF-kB, FAK-Src-paxillin-related focal adhesion, and MAP kinases (ERK and JNK) signaling pathways.

40|$|The {{twentieth century}} was a {{landmark}} {{period in the}} history of cancer therapies; a time in which conventional cancer treatments such as surgery resection, radiotherapy and chemotherapy made tremendous advances and gave birth to strategies focused on greater selective targeting. Rational drug design allied to rational drug delivery, being led by novel small <b>molecule</b> <b>anti-cancer</b> compounds and monoclonal antibodies. Such approaches prolonged survival time, often without the horrific side effects of previous therapies, but rarely prevented ultimate disease relapse. Selective targeting of membrane transporters and receptors using prodrugs, polymer-cancer drug conjugates and antibody-toxin combinations has contributed to redefine the roadmap of cancer cell targeting. Current pharmacotherapies are still far from consistently delivering cures or sustained remissions. This chapter describes some of the historical events that brought about current cancer targeting strategies...|$|R
40|$|The {{discovery}} of oncogenes and signal transduction pathways important for mitogenesis has triggered {{the development of}} target-specific small <b>molecule</b> <b>anti-cancer</b> compounds. As exemplified by imatinib (Gleevec), a specific inhibitor of the Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) -associated Bcr-Abl kinase, these agents promise impressive activity in clinical trials, {{with low levels of}} clinical toxicity. However, such therapy is susceptible to the emergence of drug resistance due to amino acid substitutions in the target protein. Defining the spectrum of such mutations is important for patient monitoring and the design of next-generation inhibitors. Using imatinib and BCR/ABL as a paradigm for a drug-target pair, we recently reported a retroviral vector-based screening strategy to identify the spectrum of resistance-conferring mutations. Here we provide a detailed methodology for the screen, which can be generally applied to any drug-target pair...|$|R
40|$|Hyperthermia {{therapy is}} a medical {{treatment}} based on the exposition of body tissue to slightly higher temperatures than physiological (i. e., between 41 and 46 °C) to damage and kill cancer cells or {{to make them more}} susceptible to the effects of radiation and anti-cancer drugs. Among several methods suitable for heating tumor areas, magnetic hyperthermia involves the introduction of magnetic micro/nanoparticles into the tumor tissue, followed by the application of an external magnetic field at fixed frequency and amplitude. A very interesting approach for magnetic hyperthermia is the use of biocompatible thermo-responsive magnetic gels made by the incorporation of the magnetic particles into cross-linked polymer gels. Mainly because of the hysteresis loss from the magnetic particles subjected to a magnetic field, the temperature of the system goes up and, once the temperature crosses the lower critical solution temperature, thermo-responsive gels undergo large volume changes and may deliver <b>anti-cancer</b> drug <b>molecules</b> that have been previously entrapped in their networks. This tutorial review describes the main properties and formulations of magnetic gel composites conceived for magnetic hyperthermia therapy.
