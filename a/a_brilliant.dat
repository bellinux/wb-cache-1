5|$|A {{feature-length film}} that {{indirectly}} parodies Star Trek is Galaxy Quest. This film {{is based on}} the premise that aliens monitoring the broadcast of an Earth-based TV series called Galaxy Quest, modeled heavily on Star Trek, believe that what they are seeing is real. Many Star Trek actors have been quoted saying that Galaxy Quest was <b>a</b> <b>brilliant</b> parody.|$|E

Du Bois also received grants from the U.S. government to prepare reports about African-American workforce and culture. His students considered him to be <b>a</b> <b>brilliant,</b> but aloof and strict, teacher.|$|E

Krypton is used in some photographic flashes for high speed photography. Krypton gas is also combined with other gases to make luminous signs that glow with a bright greenish-yellow light.|$|E

5|$|Before the Dawn is beautifully done, a grand {{genealogy}} {{of modern}} humanity, rooted in fact but spiced with an appropriate measure of speculation and hypothesis. Even for a reader {{to whom the}} material is already familiar – one who, for example, has been following Nicholas Wade’s reports in the New York Times – it is well worth the trouble of reading this book for its narrative value, for the elegant way Wade has {{put it all together}} as a single compelling story. This is <b>a</b> <b>brilliant</b> book, by one of our best science journalists.|$|E
5|$|David Cameron (Conservative {{leader and}} Prime Minister) said:... {{he was an}} {{extraordinary}} man: a great writer, <b>a</b> <b>brilliant</b> speaker, extraordinary in Parliament, and a great life of public and political and parliamentary service. I mean, I disagreed with most of what he said. But he was always engaging and interesting, and you were never bored when reading or listening to him, and the country a great campaigner, a great writer, and someone who I'm sure whose words will be followed keenly for many, many years to come.|$|E

5|$|Later in 1883, Steinitz took {{second place}} in the {{extremely}} strong London 1883 chess tournament behind Zukertort, who made <b>a</b> <b>brilliant</b> start, faded at the end but finished 3 points ahead. Steinitz finished 2½ points ahead of the third-placed competitor, Blackburne. Zukertort's victory again led some commentators to suggest that Zukertort should be regarded as the world chess champion, while others said the issue could only be resolved by a match between Steinitz and Zukertort.|$|E
5|$|Norman {{was born}} in New Haven, Connecticut {{as the son of}} {{industrialist}} Amberson Osborn. Amberson, <b>a</b> <b>brilliant</b> student in the fields of science, became an alcoholic after losing control of his company, and was physically abusive toward his family. Norman quickly came to despise his father, resolving to be a better breadwinner while developing early homicidal tendencies as a means of relieving the stress of his father's abuse.|$|E
5|$|Scandium is a {{soft metal}} with a silvery appearance. It {{develops}} a slightly yellowish or pinkish cast when oxidized by air. It {{is susceptible to}} weathering and dissolves slowly in most dilute acids. It does not react with a 1:1 mixture of nitric acid (HNO3) and 48% hydrofluoric acid (HF), possibly due {{to the formation of}} an impermeable passive layer. Scandium turnings ignite in air with <b>a</b> <b>brilliant</b> yellow flame to form scandium(III) oxide.|$|E

50|$|<b>As</b> <b>brilliant</b> as it sounds, the Poulenc Concerto for Two Pianos {{demands of}} its piano soloists more skills of {{ensemble}} than of technique. Although the pianos intersperse conversational interludes, conventional cadenzas are absent. Throughout the concerto, the pianists play nearly continuously, sometimes unaccompanied by the orchestra. Poulenc creates a dramatic yet charming {{dialogue between the}} two keyboards and the supporting orchestra ensemble. Unusually, his orchestration foregrounds the woodwinds, brass and percussion, relegating the strings to an unfamiliar secondary role.|$|R
5|$|Special prizes may {{be awarded}} for {{solutions}} of outstanding elegance or involving good generalisations of a problem. This last happened in 1995 (Nikolay Nikolov, Bulgaria) and 2005 (Iurie Boreico), but was more frequent {{up to the}} early 1980s. The special prize in 2005 was awarded to Iurie Boreico, a student from Moldova, {{who came up with}} <b>a</b> <b>brilliant</b> solution to question 3, which was an inequality involving three variables.|$|E
5|$|The {{psychoanalyst}} Richard Sterba {{wrote in}} 1982 that Reich had been <b>a</b> <b>brilliant</b> clinician and {{teacher in the}} 1920s; even the older analysts had wanted to attend his technical seminars in Vienna. But according to Sharaf, they came to consider Reich as paranoid and belligerent. Psychologist Luis Cordon wrote that Reich's slide from respectability concluded with the consensus {{inside and outside the}} psychoanalytic community that he was at best a crackpot and perhaps seriously ill.|$|E
5|$|Wadham College, {{founded in}} 1610, was the {{undergraduate}} college of Sir Christopher Wren. Wren {{was part of}} <b>a</b> <b>brilliant</b> group of experimental scientists at Oxford in the 1650s, the Oxford Philosophical Club, which included Robert Boyle and Robert Hooke. This group held regular meetings at Wadham {{under the guidance of}} the College's Warden, John Wilkins, and the group formed the nucleus which went on to found the Royal Society.|$|E
