40|$|Pure and multiwall carbon {{nanotube}} (MWCNT) - doped titanium dioxide (TiO 2) films, synthesised from two sol–gel routes (alcoholic and aqueous) and deposited by dipcoating on glass, {{have been developed}} as conductive, photocatalytic and superhydrophilic materials. While already crystallised in anatase structure at low temperature when synthesised in water, samples prepared in alcohol are amorphous. Their crystallisation in air has been studied at increasing temperatures. Effective incorporation of functionalised MWCNTs is confirmed in both aqueous and alcoholic samples with a closer interaction with TiO 2 particles {{in the case of}} aqueous synthesis. In alcoholic samples, 400 C seems to be an optimised calcination temperature since 300 C does not allow crystallisation into anatase and 500 C removes MWCNTs through burning. The purpose of MWCNT doping is to obtain coatings that exhibit easy-toclean or self-cleaning properties. This can be achieved through an optimised combination of electrical conductivity (for <b>antistatic</b> <b>property),</b> photoactivity and superhydrophilicity. These three properties require the crystallisation of TiO 2 into anatase. MWCNT doping dramatically increases both conductivity and photocatalytic activity, especially in alcoholic samples for the former and in aqueous samples for the latter.

40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. Thesis (M. S.) : Bilkent University, Department of Chemistry, İhsan Doğramacı Bilkent University, 2018. Includes bibliographical references. Static {{electricity}} {{is a common}} phenomenon that can causes million-dollar loses in industries such as polymer, air and space, and drug manufacture due to the detrimental effects of electrostatic discharge of the accumulated charges on surfaces. Doping of the materials, i. e. polymers, with antistatic agents can reduce or prevent these problems. So far, the antistatic additives used were chosen to make the final material/composite conductive to dissipate the surface charges, by either directly doping with conductive materials (e. g. metals or carbon powder), or by doping with additives (e. g. ions) to increase surface humidity. The doped materials usually lose their inherent properties such as the mechanical properties {{because of the high}} concentrations of the additive. To provide a more universal solution to this problem and avoid the changes in the material properties after doping, the mechanism of static charge formation, which has been on debate for many years, should be clarified. Recent studies of our group and others have shown that the main mechanism behind the charge formation on electrified (polymer) materials is the bond-breakages on the surfaces of the materials, which lead to mechanoanion, mechanocation, mechanoradical active ends. The former two accounts for the charge on the surfaces and, as we have shown, the latter group (mechanoradicals) stabilizes the charged species. Previously, in our group, it was shown that by removing the mechanoradicals with radical scavenger antioxidants one can destabilize the charges – doping with antioxidants makes materials antistatic. However, the scavenger antioxidants we had used in this example to show the antistatic behavior were far from being practical in use for general polymers -that are produces in millions of tons per year- because of their individual prices. Lignin is the world’s second most abundant polymer. It has antioxidant properties, so it is a good candidate as an antistatic agent for common polymers. In this study we assess the lignin’s antistatic action by doping it into common polymers - elastomers (silicon rubber) and thermoplastics (PE, PP, PVC), and comparing the accumulated net charge on the doped and undoped polymers upon contact electrification. It was shown that the increase in lignin concentration and decrease in particle size of the lignin enhances the <b>antistatic</b> <b>property</b> in the polymers, due to an increase in radical scavenging OH groups, as verified by 31 P-NMR analysis. We certify that the <b>antistatic</b> <b>property</b> is because of the radical scavenging action and not by increase in the surface conductivity. By doping polymers with cheap and abundant lignin, we provide a more universal, environment-friendly method for preventing electrostatic charge accumulation on common polymers, which are produced in millions of tons per year. by Tutku Bedük.

Effects of hydrolysis temperature and time, calcination temperature and time, pH value and nano-SnO 2 coating amount on the resistivity of SW powders were studied, and the optimum experimental conditions were obtained. The microstructure and surface properties of wollastonite, precipitate and SW were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS), specific surface area analyzer (BET), thermogravimetry (TG), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier translation infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) respectively.

40|$|In this work, {{materials}} {{have been produced}} by sol-gel route. This synthesis way {{has been used for}} immobilization on a support of a function focused on green chemistry. The different functions are related with different applications that allow to illustrate the versatility and the flexibility of this sol-gel process. The two applications are: - Photocatalysis: Synthesis of material with photocatalytic property or with an additional property - Cyclocarbonation: Synthesis of an immobilized catalyst for polyurethane production through a green process The first application concerns the use of a photocatalyst that allows to degrade volatile organic compounds (VOC). The main photocatalyst is TiO 2. It has been studied as a powder or as a film deposited on a support. A comparison of these two shapes has shown that an identical photocatalyst can have different performances depending on the final shape. A catalyst must be considered in its totality and with its environment rather than as a chemical composition only. To increase the photocatalyst performances, modifications have been added as the Zn doping to increase the photocatalytic activity and the superhydrophilicity. These new photocatalysts have been compared with pure ZnO and bilayer films composed of TiO 2 and of ZnO. Different photocatalytic tests have been performed and depending on the test the best photocatalyst was different. Then, to increase the economic interest, some dopant have been used. In addition of the improvement of the photocatalytic activity and superhydrophilicity, theses dopants add a new property such as electrical conductivity and anticorrosion. First, metallic silver has been incorporated to add <b>antistatic</b> <b>property</b> and to increase the photocatalytic activity. The photocatalytic property has been improved, superhydrophilicity has been kept but no <b>antistatic</b> <b>property</b> was observed. Multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) have been tested with TiO 2 to increase the electrical conductivity. This doping is efficient because MWCNTs increase the conductivity, the photocatalytic activity and maintain the superhydrophilicity. In addition, anticorrosive property has been observed on stainless steel in a preliminary study with the MWCNTs incorporation. The second study is focused on the heterogeneous cyclocarbonation catalyst synthesis to produce, in fine, polyurethane. The catalyst was immobilized on different matrices that are inert from catalytic point of view but that have a potential activator effect. First, with the preselected catalyst, different supports have been investigated. The comparison between the supports has highlighted the activator effect and the texture influence (accessibility of the active sites) on cyclocarbonation yields. Then, with the optimal matrix, different catalysts from a same family have been grafted to choose the best catalyst. Therefore, it has been possible to define the best catalyst and the best support.

40|$|A polyol {{containing}} long sulfonated side chain, {{designated as}} PESS, {{was used to}} prepare aqueous polyurethane (PU) dispersions through the prepolymer mixing process in this study.

Structures and properties of the WPUs were examined by FTIR, GPC, particle sizer, viscometer, TGA, DMA, DSC, tensile tester and surface resistance meter. When the content of total hydrophilic groups (i. e. sodium sulfonate group of PESS and quaternary ammonium carboxylate group of neutralized dimethylol propionic acid, DMPA) remains unchanged, the WPU dispersion with higher PESS content possesses higher average particle diameter and film decomposition temperature due to its higher average molecular weight (Mw). The WPU with higher PESS content possesses higher dispersion viscosity and film ionic conductivity due to the higher dissociation degree or electrostatic interaction of sodium sulfonate groups than quaternary ammonium carboxylate groups. PESS enhances the <b>antistatic</b> <b>property</b> of the WPU films, which can be used in electronic, wrapping, and coating industries. Moreover, the WPU film with higher PESS content exhibits lower modulus but higher elongation at break due to the lower hard segment content.

40|$|In this study, silver {{nanoparticles}} were synthesized on {{cotton fabric}} modified with 3 -aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APTMS) using sodium citrate as a reducing/stabilizing agent by microwave-assisted process. The {{presence of a}} highly oriented amino-terminated self-assembled monolayer and formation of APTMS was demonstrated by an X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. The silver-coated cotton fabrics were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX). UV protection, <b>antistatic,</b> and hydrophobic <b>properties</b> were also evaluated. The results show that silver-coated fabric modified with APTMS possesses excellent antistatic, UV protection with ultraviolet protection factor (UPF) of 396. 5 and superhydrophobic properties with contact angle of 153. 2 °. APTMS pretreatment improves the adhesive strength between silver coatings and cotton fabric. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R
