5|$|Going {{higher in}} elevation, the {{coniferous}} forests become purer stands of red fir, western white pine, Jeffrey pine, lodgepole pine, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>occasional</b> foxtail pine. Fewer wildlife species {{tend to be}} found in these habitats, because of their higher elevation and lower complexity. Species likely {{to be found in}}clude golden-mantled ground squirrel, chickaree, fisher, Steller's jay, hermit thrush, and northern goshawk. Reptiles are not common, but include rubber boa, western fence lizard, and northern alligator lizard.|$|E
5|$|Potter's own three-door oven, her hearthrug, her indoor plants, her {{coronation}} teapot, and {{her water}} pump are minutely detailed with more color {{than in other}} productions. The large format of the original edition, the captions accompanying the full page color illustrations, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>occasional</b> lack of coordination between picture and text all display Potter's delight in the pictures, sometimes {{at the expense of}} the text.|$|E
5|$|This bird feeds at night, eating various {{invertebrates}} {{and small}} vertebrates. While in mangroves, it commonly feeds on crabs. Otherwise, it will generally feed on molluscs, arthropods, frogs, seeds, berries, palm fruits, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>occasional</b> water snake. Maize, rice, and bananas are also viable food {{items for the}} grey-necked wood rail. It is also known to feed on the feces of giant otters at latrines.|$|E

5|$|Boletus subluridellus is {{classified}} in the section Luridi of the genus Boletus. Section Luridi is characterized by boletes that immediately turn blue with cutting or bruising, narrow pores that are usually red, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>occasional</b> presence of toxins in the fruit bodies. According to the scheme proposed by Smith and Thiers, {{the form of the}} dermatocystidia (cystidia on the cap cuticle) is important to species delimitation in section Luridi. In a 1993 study, however, Roland Treu found no major consistent microscopic differences between B.subluridellus, B.rufocinnamomeus, and B.roseobadius.|$|E
5|$|Crush {{contains}} ten {{levels in}} each of the four locations, all based on an event in Danny's past. The levels represent Danny's mind: a dark city landscape with many tall buildings <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>occasional</b> street lamp, a hotel resting aside a seaside location, a dark and mysterious funfair, and a haunted childhood bedroom. Levels are mostly composed of platforms formed by blocks. The player's goal in each level is to collect marbles, which give the player points based on their color. The exit from the level is opened once a predetermined number of points have been collected. Danny can crawl into narrow areas and jump a small height.|$|E
5|$|Earlier in 2017 Puw {{completed}} his first chamber opera Y Tŵr {{based on the}} play by the Welsh playwright, Gwenlyn Parry and to libretto by Gwyneth Glyn. The opera in three acts explores the relationship and emotions between two characters during three specific periods in their lives, during youth, middle age and finally, old age. The composer's use of atonal musical language, octatonic scales <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>occasional</b> tonal passage are directly linked with the various emotions of the characters and the unfolding of the drama.|$|E

5|$|The {{placement}} of P.auricoma within Parasola is somewhat controversial. It {{has often been}} classified in the section Auricomi, a grouping of species characterized {{by the absence of}} a veil, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>occasional</b> presence of caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem), pileocystidia (cystidia on the cap surface), or dark setae-like elements. Several molecular phylogenetics studies have confirmed its inclusion in the Parasola clade, but its relationship to other members of the group have not been fully resolved due to limited sampling. A recent analysis suggests that in the phylogenetic tree of Parasola, P.auricoma and P.conopilus form a tritomy with the crown Parasola species.|$|E
5|$|The tawny {{nurse shark}} {{may be one of}} the few fishes specializing in preying on octopus. Other known food items include corals, sea urchins, {{crustaceans}} (e.g. crabs and lobsters), squid, small fishes (e.g. surgeonfish, queenfish, and rabbitfish), <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>occasional</b> sea snake. Hunting {{tawny nurse shark}}s swim slowly just above the sea floor, poking their heads into depressions and holes. When a prey item is found, the shark forcefully expands its large, muscular pharynx, creating a powerful negative pressure that sucks the prey into its mouth.|$|E
5|$|When {{the reigning}} king Monivong died on 23 April 1941, the Governor-General of French Indochina, Jean Decoux chose Sihanouk to succeed him. Sihanouk's {{appointment}} as king was formalised {{the following day}} by the Cambodian crown council, and his coronation ceremony took place on 3May 1941. During the Japanese occupation of Cambodia, he dedicated {{most of his time}} to sports, filming, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>occasional</b> tour to the countryside. In March 1945 the Japanese military, which had occupied Cambodia since August 1941, dissolved the nominal French colonial administration. Under pressure from the Japanese, Sihanouk proclaimed Cambodia's independence and assumed the position of prime minister while serving as king at the same time.|$|E

5|$|People visiting {{or living}} in Rome or the cities {{throughout}} the Empire {{would have seen}} art {{in a range of}} styles and media on a daily basis. Public or official art—including sculpture, monuments such as victory columns or triumphal arches, and the iconography on coins—is often analysed for its historical significance or as an expression of imperial ideology. At Imperial public baths, a person of humble means could view wall paintings, mosaics, statues, and interior decoration often of high quality. In the private sphere, objects made for religious dedications, funerary commemoration, domestic use, and commerce can show varying degrees of aesthetic quality and artistic skill. A wealthy person might advertise his appreciation of culture through painting, sculpture, and decorative arts at his home—though some efforts strike modern viewers and some ancient connoisseurs as strenuous rather than tasteful. Greek art had a profound influence on the Roman tradition, and some of the most famous examples of Greek statues are known only from Roman Imperial versions <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>occasional</b> description in a Greek or Latin literary source.|$|E
