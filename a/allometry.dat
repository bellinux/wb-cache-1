5|$|Larger bodied {{specimens}} of Dimetrodon have larger sails {{relative to their}} size, an example of positive <b>allometry.</b> Positive <b>allometry</b> may benefit thermoregulation because it means that, as individuals get larger, surface area increases faster than mass. Larger-bodied animals generate {{a great deal of}} heat through metabolism, and the amount of heat that must be dissipated from the body surface is significantly greater than what must be dissipated by smaller-bodied animals. Effective heat dissipation can be predicted across many different animals with a single relationship between mass and surface area. However, a 2010 study of <b>allometry</b> in Dimetrodon found a different relationship between its sail and body mass: the actual scaling exponent of the sail was much larger than the exponent expected in an animal adapted to heat dissipation. The researchers concluded that the sail of Dimetrodon grew at a much faster rate than was necessary for thermoregulation, and suggested that sexual selection was the primary reason for its evolution.|$|E

Like other Mesozoic temnospondyls, adult metoposaurids were adapted to a semiaquatic lifestyle. Their bones are not highly developed for movement on land. The cross-sectional thickness of limb bones in adult metoposaurids shows that they could not withstand the stress of terrestrial locomotion. Juvenile individuals have bones that are thick enough to withstand this stress, and could probably move about on land. To maintain a terrestrial lifestyle, a temnospondyl's limb bones would have to thicken with positive <b>allometry,</b> meaning that they would grow at a greater rate {{than the rest of the}} body. This is not the case in metoposaurids, meaning that as their bodies grew larger they became less adapted toward a terrestrial lifestyle.|$|E

To this end, we conducted a detailed comparative analysis of the <b>allometries</b> of nine characters for ten species belonging to all six currently recognized subgenera and showing different life-styles. Eight of the nine traits under consideration show a clear increase in relative size from hypogaeic to intermediate to epigaeic life-style. These results strongly suggest that shifts in ecological niche are linked with adaptations in these traits. The degree of overall differentiation among species is more pronounced in larger than in smaller workers.

Moreover, such <b>allometries</b> have significant implications for how individuals influence {{population and community}} dynamics. Here, we examined how body size variation in Komodo dragons (Varanus komodoensis) influenced ecological <b>allometries</b> in their: (1) prey size preference, (2) daily movement rates, (3) home range area, and (4) subsequent niche use across ontogeny. With increased body mass, Komodo dragons increased prey size with a dramatic switch from small (≤ 10 kg) to large prey (≥ 50 kg) in lizards heavier than 20 kg. Rates of foraging movement were described by a non-linear concave down response with lizard increasinghourly movement rates up until ∼ 20 kg body mass before decreasing daily movement suggesting reduced foraging effort in larger lizards. In contrast, home range area exhibited a sigmoid response with increased body mass. Intrapopulation ecological niche use and overlap were also strongly structured by body size. Thus, ontogenetic <b>allometries</b> suggest Komodo dragon’s transition from a highly active foraging modeexploiting small prey through to a less active sit and wait feeding strategy focused on killing large ungulates. Further, our results suggest that as body size increases across ontogeny, the Komodo dragon exhibited marked ontogenetic niche shifts that enabled it to function as an entire vertebrate predator guild by exploiting prey across multiple trophic levels...|$|R

After reviewing the previous theoretical approaches {{devoted to the}} understanding of shell form and its morphogenesis, we present a free-form vector model which can simulate apertural shape changes and nonlinear <b>allometries.</b> Shell morphology is generated by iteratively adding a growth increment onto the last computed aperture. The first growth increment defines so-called growth vectors which are assumed to be constant in direction (relative to the last computed aperture position) during a simulation of a shell (ontogeny). These growth vectors are uniformly scaled at each time step according to various growth rate curves that are used to simulate the mantle growth over time. From the model, we derive morphometric variables that illustrate the ontogenetic trajectories in time-size-shape space. We investigate the effects of changing the growth curves types, growth rate parameters and growth vector maps on the direction, speed and patterns of ontogenetic <b>allometries.</b> Because this model focuses the issue on time, it highlights a plausible effect of growth rate on shell shape and illustrates some fundamental geometrical properties of the logarithmic spiral, in particular the close relationship between the size and the geometry of growth increments. This model could be used to develop a mathematically data-driven approach where experimentally obtained growth curves could be used as inputs in the model.

The biomechanical parameters (second moments of area (Ix, Iy, Imax, Imin)) were calculated from the external contours of the symphysis.

We found that the reproductive traits of most dinosaurs conformed to similar-sized or scaled-up extant reptiles or birds. The reproductive traits of theropods, which are considered more bird-like, were indeed consistent with birds, while the traits of sauropodomorphs conformed better to reptiles. Reproductive traits of hadrosaurs corresponded to both reptiles and birds.

Russell and Zhao (1996) believed [...] "the small brain size of psittacosaurs implies a very restrictive behavioural repertoire relative to that of modern mammals of similar body size".

40|$|To {{what extent}} within-species (static) <b>allometries</b> {{constitute}} a constraint on evolution {{is the subject}} of a long-standing debate in evolutionary biology. A prerequisite for the constraint hypothesis is that static <b>allometries</b> are hard to change.

Here, we present results from an experiment in which we selected independently on the slope and the elevation of the allometric relationship between caudal-fin size and body size in male guppies (Poecilia reticulata). After three episodes of selection, the allometric elevation (i. e. intercept at constant slope) had diverged markedly between the lines selected to increase or decrease it, and showed a realized heritability of 50 %. In contrast, the allometric slope remained unaffected by selection. These results suggest that the allometric elevation is more evolvable than the allometric slope, this latter representing a potential constraint on adaptive trait evolution.

He {{thought it was an}} [...] "amphibian", i.e. an animal capable of both swimming in the sea and walking on land. Generally, in his mind Megalosaurus resembled a gigantic lizard, but Buckland already understood from the form of the thighbone head that the legs were not so much sprawling as held rather upright. In the original description of 1824, Buckland repeated Cuvier's size estimate that Megalosaurus would have been forty feet long with the weight of a seven foot tall elephant. However, this had been based on the remains present at Oxford. Buckland had also been hurried into naming his new reptile by a visit he had made to the fossil collection of Mantell, who during the lecture announced to have acquired a fossil thighbone of enormous magnitude, twice as long as that just described. Today, this is known to have belonged to Iguanodon, or at least some iguanodontid, but at the time both men assumed this bone belonged to Megalosaurus also. Even taking into account the effects of <b>allometry,</b> heavier animals having relatively stouter bones, Buckland was forced in the printed version of his lecture to estimate the maximum length of Megalosaurus at sixty to seventy feet. The existence of Megalosaurus posed some problems for christian orthodoxy, which typically held that suffering and death had only come into the world through Original Sin, which seemed irreconcilable with the presence of a gigantic devouring reptile during a pre-Adamitic phase of history. Buckland rejected the usual solution, that such carnivores would originally have been peaceful vegetarians, as infantile and claimed in one of the Bridgewater Treatises that Megalosaurus had played a beneficial rôle in creation by ending the lives of old and ill animals, [...] "to diminish the aggregate amount of animal suffering".|$|E
2500|$|The {{metabolism}} of {{an animal}} is estimated by determining rates of carbon dioxide production (VCO2) and oxygen consumption (VO2) of individual animals, either in a closed or an open-circuit respirometry system.

[...] SMR is measured while the animal is at rest (but not asleep) under specific laboratory (temperature, hydration) and subject-specific conditions (e.g., size or <b>allometry),</b> age, reproduction status, post-absorptive to avoid thermic effect of food). VO2max is typically determined during aerobic exercise at or near physiological limits. In contrast, field metabolic rate (FMR) refers to the metabolic rate of an unrestrained, active animal in nature. [...] Whole-animal metabolic rates refer to these measures without correction for body mass.

2500|$|One of {{the most}} well known {{mechanisms}} of task allocation is worker polymorphism, where workers within a colony have morphological differences. This difference in size {{is determined by the}} amount of food workers are fed as larvae, and is set once workers emerge from their pupae. Workers may vary just in size (monomorphism) or size and bodily proportions (<b>allometry).</b> [...] An excellent example of the monomorphism is in bumblebees (Bombus spp.). Bumblebee workers display a large amount of body size variation which is normally distributed. The largest workers may be ten times the mass of the smallest workers. Worker size is correlated with several tasks: larger workers tend to forage, while smaller workers tend to perform brood care and nest thermoregulation. Size also affects task efficiency. Larger workers are better at learning, have better vision, carry more weight, and fly at a greater range of temperatures. However, smaller workers are more resistant to starvation. [...] In other eusocial insects as well, worker size can determine what polymorphic role they become. [...] For instance, larger workers in Myrmecocystus mexicanus (a North America species of honeypot ant) tend to become repletes, or workers so engorged with food that they become immobile and act a living food storage {{for the rest of the}} colonies.|$|E

We sought to attribute variation in tree architecture to current environments, wood density and phylogeny, and thereby elucidate {{the relative importance of}} biogeographic idiosyncrasies versus current factors in underpinning architectural differences. Location: Africa and Australia. Methods: We compiled canopy diameters and stem diameters from 4867 trees of 97 species and heights and stem diameters from 10, 786 trees of 155 species from a range of African and Australian savanna ecosystems and climates. Using Bayesian methods we first estimated continental-scale savanna tree <b>allometries,</b> ignoring species differences. We then examined continental differences in species-specific <b>allometries</b> accounting for trait covariation using a phylogeny of our study species. Environmental variables and wood density data were included as covariates, allowing us to assess the potential underpinning of regional differences in tree <b>allometries</b> by differences in current environments and traits. Results: Substantial allometric differences exist between Australian and African savanna trees. Australian trees are on average 6 m taller at 20 cm diameter, with a 53 % smaller canopy area than African trees. However, this extreme continental-scale variation is driven by the architecture of only a few taxa in this study - Vachellia and Senegalia versus Eucalyptus and Corymbia - rather than systematic differences between species, wood density and environment. These same genera often dominate the woody strata of South African and Australian savannas, respectively. Main conclusions: Stark {{differences in the}} architecture of African and Australian savanna tree taxa are not a product of environmental differences and are not consistent across species.

2500|$|However, recent {{analysis}} of the tiny holes in fossil leg bones of dinosaurs provides a gauge for blood flow rate and hence metabolic rate. The holes are called nutrient foramina, and the nutrient artery is the major blood vessel passing through to {{the interior of the}} bone, where it branches into tiny vessels of the Haversian canal system. [...] This system is responsible for replacing old bone with new bone, thereby repairing microbreaks that occur naturally during locomotion. [...] Without this repair, microbreaks would build up, leading to stress fractures and ultimately catastrophic bone failure. The size of the nutrient foramen provides an index of blood flow through it, according to the Hagen-Poiseuille equation. [...] The size is also related to the body size of animal, of course, so this effect is removed by {{analysis of}} <b>allometry.</b> [...] Blood flow index of the nutrient foramen of the femurs in living mammals increases in direct proportion to the animals' maximum metabolic rates, as measured during maximum sustained locomotion. [...] Mammalian blood flow index is about 10 times greater than in ectothermic reptiles. [...] Ten species of fossil dinosaurs from five taxonomic groups reveal indices even higher than in mammals, when body size is accounted for, indicating that they were highly active, aerobic animals.

We test this hypothesis by examining the patterns of scaling in Drosophila melanogaster subjected to variation in three environmental regulators of size: nutrition, temperature and rearing density. Our data indicate that different environmental regulators of size do indeed generate different patterns of scaling. Consequently, flies that are ostensibly the same size may have very different body proportions.

It may therefore be difficult to infer selective pressures that shape scaling relationships in a wild population without first elucidating the environmental and genetic factors that generate size variation among members of the population...|$|R
