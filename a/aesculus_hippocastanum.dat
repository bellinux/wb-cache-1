40|$|The Italian and Balkan peninsulas {{have been}} places {{traditionally}} highlighted as Pleistocene glacial refuges. The Iberian Peninsula, however, {{has been a}} focus of controversy between geobotanists and palaeobotanists {{as a result of}} its exclusion from this category on different occasions. In the current paper, we synthesise geological, molecular, palaeobotanical and geobotanical data that show the importance of the Iberian Peninsula in the Western Mediterranean as a refugium area. The presence of <b>Aesculus</b> aff. <b>hippocastanum</b> L. at the Iberian site at Cal Guardiola (Tarrasa, Barcelona, NE Spain) in the Lower– Middle Pleistocene transition helps to consolidate the remarkable role of the Iberian Peninsula in the survival of tertiary species during the Pleistocene. The palaeodistribution of the genus in Europe highlights a model of area abandonment for a widely-distributed species in the Miocene and Pliocene, leading to a diminished and fragmentary presence in the Pleistocene and Holocene on the southern Mediterranean peninsulas. Aesculus fossils are not uncommon within the series of Tertiary taxa. Many appear in the Pliocene and suffer a radical impoverishment in the Lower–Middle Pleistocene transition. Nonetheless some of these tertiary taxa persisted throughout the Pleistocene and Holocene up to the present in the Iberian Peninsula. Locating these refuge areas on the Peninsula is not an easy task, although areas characterised by a sustained level of humidity must have played an predominant role...|$|R
40|$|Urbanization {{affects the}} {{availability}} and diversity of floral resources (pollen and/or nectar) for wild pollinating insects. For example, urban green areas are characterized by an abundance of ornamental plant species. Increasingly, trees are planted to improve the aesthetics of urban streets and parks. These urban trees might offer important floral resources to pollinating insects. To examine the suitability of urban trees as resources for pollinating insects, we investigated the chemical composition of pollen and nectar {{as well as the}} amount of nectar produced by the nine major insect-pollinated tree species planted in cities of Western Europe, namely Acer pseudoplatanus, <b>Aesculus</b> carnea, A. <b>hippocastanum,</b> Robinia pseudoacacia, Tilia cordata, T. x euchlora, T. x europaea, T. platyphyllos and T. tomentosa. The analyses revealed that globally the Tilia trees provide pollen with lower contents of polypeptides, amino acids and phytosterols compared with the other species. Urban tree flowers offer abundant nectar with relatively high sugar contents (0. 16 – 1. 28 mg/flower); sucrose was the predominant sugar in all nectars. The investigated tree species could therefore be considered in future city plantings. Peer reviewe...|$|R

50|$|Most larvae are leaf miners, which feed on {{leaves and}} produce {{distorting}} tissue damage. Most larvae suck sap {{during their first}} three instars, and consume the leaves during their final two instar stages. Familiar pests in the subfamily include Cameraria ohridella, which feeds on horse chestnut (<b>Aesculus</b> <b>hippocastanum),</b> Phyllonorycter blancardella, which feeds on apples (Malus spp.), Cremastobombycia lantanella, which attacks lantana (Lantana camara). Some larvae produce galls on plants.|$|E
50|$|The nut of the {{horse-chestnut}} tree (Aesculus species, especially <b>Aesculus</b> <b>hippocastanum),</b> {{is called a}} conker in the British Isles. Conkers are inedible because they contain toxic glucoside aesculin. They are used in a popular children's game, known as conkers, where the nuts are threaded onto a strong cord and then each contestant attempts to break their opponent's conker by hitting it with their own. Horse chestnuts are also popular slingshot ammunition.|$|E
50|$|The {{horse-chestnut}} {{leaf miner}} (Cameraria ohridella) is a leaf-mining moth of the Gracillariidae family. The {{horse-chestnut leaf miner}} was first observed in Macedonia in 1984, and {{was described as a}} new species in 1986. Its larvae are leaf miners on the common horse-chestnut (<b>Aesculus</b> <b>hippocastanum).</b> The horse-chestnut leafminer was first collected and inadvertently pressed in herbarium sheets by the botanist Theodor von Heldreich in central Greece in 1879.|$|E
50|$|The garden {{contains}} fine {{specimens of}} Fagus sylvatica, Pinus nigra, and Tilia platyphyllos, {{as well as}} trees including Acer pseudoplatanus, <b>Aesculus</b> <b>hippocastanum,</b> Fraxinus excelsior, Platanus x acerifolia, Populus nigra, Prunus serrulata, Robinia pseudoacacia, Taxus baccata, and Tilia platyphylla, with lesser trees including Acer platanoides, Ailanthus altissima, Crataegus, Fagus sylvatica, Ginkgo biloba, Gleditsia triacanthos, Ilex aquifolium, Pinus griffithii, Pinus mugo, Pinus nigra, Pyrus communis, Salix alba, Sophora japonica, Taxus baccata, and Tilia americana.|$|E
50|$|The larvae feed on Acer campestre, Acer platanoides, Acer pseudoplatanus, <b>Aesculus</b> <b>hippocastanum,</b> Alnus, Betula, Carpinus betulus, Fagus sylvatica, Sorbus, Tilia cordata, Tilia platyphyllos and Tilia tomentosa. They {{mine the}} leaves of their host plant. The mine {{consists}} of a small, full depth, hook-like corridor, usually in a vein axil, with a proportionally large larval chamber. The remainder of the mine is almost entirely filled with frass. The larvae soon leave their mine and start living free on the leaf.|$|E
50|$|Red buckeye has hybridized {{with common}} {{horse-chestnut}} (<b>Aesculus</b> <b>hippocastanum)</b> in cultivation, the hybrid being named Aesculus × carnea, red horse-chestnut. The hybrid is a medium-sized tree to 45 - 55 ft tall, intermediate between the parent species in most respects, but inheriting the red flower color from A. pavia. It {{is a popular}} tree in large gardens and parks, most commonly the selected cultivar 'Briotii'. Hybrids of red buckeye with yellow buckeye (A. flava) have also been found, and named Aesculus × hybrida.|$|E
5000|$|... == Flora== Inspired {{by an old}} {{chestnut}} tree in the priory gardens two rows of <b>Aesculus</b> <b>hippocastanum</b> chestnuts were planted around the parking area on Klostergade. On the square Klostertorv a Acer platanoides maple was planted {{around the turn of}} the 20th century in a courtyard. The buildings around it has since been torn down and the area turned into a large open square. In 1973 a small square on the corner of Badstuegade was established with 3 lime trees, Tilia cordata.|$|E
5000|$|The tree is {{commonly}} called the [...] "chestnut", or [...] "sweet chestnut" [...] to {{distinguish it from}} the horse chestnut <b>Aesculus</b> <b>hippocastanum,</b> {{to which it is}} only distantly related. Other common names include [...] "Spanish chestnut", [...] "Portuguese chestnut" [...] and [...] "marron" [...] (French for [...] "chestnut"). The Latin sativa means [...] "cultivated by humans".Some selected varieties are smaller and more compact in growth yielding earlier in life with different ripening time: the Marigoule, the Marisol and the Maraval.|$|E
50|$|The wood {{is derived}} from the {{calcareous}} Ash-Wych Elm (southern variant) type but has been much planted with non-native species mainly Beech (Fagus sylvatica) and Sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus) but with some Horse Chestnut (<b>Aesculus</b> <b>hippocastanum)</b> and Cypress trees Cupressus. In the more natural areas of the wood Ash (Fraxinus excelsior) is dominant with occasional Pedunculate Oak (Quercus robur) standards. In such places the shrub layer is dominated by Field Maple (Acer campestre), Hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna), Elder (Sambucus nigra), Hazel (Corylus avellana) and young Wych Elm (Ulmus glabra).|$|E
50|$|The most {{familiar}} {{member of the}} genus worldwide is the common horse chestnut, <b>Aesculus</b> <b>hippocastanum.</b> The yellow buckeye, Aesculus flava (syn. A. octandra), is also a valuable ornamental tree with yellow flowers, but is less widely planted. Among the smaller species is the bottlebrush buckeye, Aesculus parviflora, a flowering shrub. Several {{other members of the}} genus are used as ornamentals, and several horticultural hybrids have also been developed, most notably the red horse chestnut Aesculus × carnea, a hybrid between A. hippocastanum and A. pavia.|$|E
