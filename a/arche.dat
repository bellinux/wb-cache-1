5|$|Most of the postwar's {{presidents of}} the Fifth Republic wanted to leave their own monuments in Paris; President Georges Pompidou started the Centre Georges Pompidou (1977), Valéry Giscard d'Estaing began the Musée d'Orsay (1986); President François Mitterrand, in power for 14 years, built the Opéra Bastille (1985–1989), the Bibliothèque {{nationale}} de France (1996), the <b>Arche</b> de la Défense (1985–1989), and the Louvre Pyramid with its underground courtyard (1983–1989); Jacques Chirac (2006), the Musée du quai Branly.|$|E
5|$|The {{centre of}} Paris {{contains}} the most visited monuments in the city, including the Notre Dame Cathedral and the Louvre {{as well as}} the Sainte-Chapelle; Les Invalides, where the tomb of Napoleon is located, and the Eiffel Tower are located on the Left Bank south-west of the centre. The banks of the Seine from the Pont de Sully to the Pont d'Iéna have been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1991. Other landmarks are laid out east to west along the historical axis of Paris, which runs from the Louvre through the Tuileries Garden, the Luxor Column in the Place de la Concorde, and the Arc de Triomphe, to the Grande <b>Arche</b> of La Défense.|$|E
5|$|The {{destruction}} of the Tuileries Palace affected the aesthetic relationship between the Palais du Louvre and the Arc de Triomphe, as it could now be seen that the two structures {{were not on the}} same axis. The Palais des Tuileries had served to disguise the fact that the Palais du Louvre is skewed slightly (6.33°) relative to the Axe historique (also known as the Voie Triomphale), a seven-kilometre straight line of structures and thoroughfares, including the Place de la Concorde, Champs-Élysées, the Arc de Triomphe and the Grande <b>Arche</b> de La Défense.|$|E
40|$|This review investigates two {{software}} packages, <b>ArchEd</b> and Stratigraph, {{which have}} been developed to assist with the recording and analysis of archaeological excavations. Both provide facilities for the automatic production of Harris matrix style diagrams from stratigraphic relationships. <b>ArchEd</b> limits itself to this single function. Stratigraph, on the other hand, attempts to take things further by incoporating its matrix-drawing capabilities into a full excavation recording database...|$|R
5000|$|Janssen {{presented}} {{the newly formed}} band to William Hanna and Joseph Barbera to finalize the production deal. Hanna-Barbera wanted Janssen to recast Patrice Holloway, because {{they had decided to}} portray [...] "Josie and the Pussycats" [...] as an all-white trio and had altered Valerie, who had been conceived as African-American and was already appearing as such in <b>Arche's</b> revamped Josie and the Pussycats comic book, to make her white. Janssen refused to recast Holloway and threatened {{to walk away from the}} project. After a three-week-long stand-off between Janssen and Hanna-Barbera, Hanna-Barbera finally relented and allowed Janssen to keep Holloway, and changed Valerie back to being African-American. The Valerie character was the first African-American female character on a regular Saturday morning cartoon series. The Hardy Boys drummer Pete Jones had been the first African-American male to appear on Saturday mornings a year earlier.|$|R

Initially there was no comment of any kind - Ford was lined up for the <b>Arché's</b> Salon to happen in October. However, in early October Ford appears in Kansas City - giving a talk on [...] "Russia" [...] (with front page coverage) and someone {{wrote a letter to}} the editor proclaiming her success in Chicago. Days later she presents [...] "Ibsen the Mystic's, Brand, and Peer Gynt". A week later she was speaking about [...] "Italian Masters" [...] a few states over in Fort Wayne, Indiana. Then two talks were announced in Chicago - the first on Turgenev and the second on Liszt. and then a week later another on American art. Then she spoke on Oliver Wendell Holmes for the Tuesday Club, Nathaniel Hawthorne and the Scarlet Letter to the Wildwood club, [...] "American Poets" [...] later in December, and [...] "George Meredith, His Poems and Works".

5|$|The pre-Socratic Greek {{philosophers}} and Indian philosophers developed {{some of the}} earliest philosophical concepts of the Universe. The earliest Greek philosophers noted that appearances can be deceiving, and sought to understand the underlying reality behind the appearances. In particular, they noted the ability of matter to change forms (e.g., ice to water to steam) and several philosophers proposed that all the physical materials in the world are different forms of a single primordial material, or <b>arche.</b> The first to do so was Thales, who proposed this material to be water. Thales' student, Anaximander, proposed that everything came from the limitless apeiron. Anaximenes proposed the primordial material to be air on account of its perceived attractive and repulsive qualities that cause the <b>arche</b> to condense or dissociate into different forms. Anaxagoras proposed the principle of Nous (Mind), while Heraclitus proposed fire (and spoke of logos). Empedocles proposed the elements to be earth, water, air and fire. His four-element model became very popular. Like Pythagoras, Plato believed that all things were composed of number, with Empedocles' elements taking the form of the Platonic solids. Democritus, and later philosophers—most notably Leucippus—proposed that the Universe is composed of indivisible atoms moving through void (vacuum), although Aristotle did not believe that to be feasible because air, like water, offers resistance to motion. Air will immediately rush in to fill a void, and moreover, without resistance, it would do so indefinitely fast.|$|E
25|$|In September, Hull House {{announced}} a series through the Fall, Winter {{and into the}} Spring, with Ford giving a talk once a month from October to March. The <b>Arché</b> club similarly announces a series of talks including Ford every other week into about January. The <b>Arché</b> coverage was noted in Nebraska.|$|E
25|$|In the {{prolongation}} of the Avenue des Champs-Élysées, a new arch, the Grande <b>Arche</b> de la Défense, {{was built}} in 1982, completing the line of monuments that forms Paris's Axe historique.

25|$|January 1900 {{began with}} a longer version, and more in her own words, of the ghost story in Ford's home - and carried in the New York Tribune. A {{little more than a}} week later Ford gave a talk on Bret Harte for the <b>Arché</b> club. In a couple days she shared a stage with another speaker on the Fabian Society, and another on Bret Harte.|$|E
25|$|In August {{she goes}} from a talk in Dubuque, Iowa, to a {{talk in the}} Alice Breed home in Lynn, Massachusetts where she did a series of some ten of her lecture {{subjects}} - and this noted in the Kansas City area as well. The Breed family would be one she would have many interactions with in coming years. From September to October is there a gap in coverage. She is next noted in Dubuque, Iowa in mid-October {{in the midst of}} a series of talks. She was announced in the season's talks of the Chicago Culture Club as well. She presented a talk for the <b>Arché</b> club later in October, among a larger list of speakers. A month later she spoke on Harriet Beecher Stowe for the <b>Arché</b> Club. In a few days she gave a talk in Kansas City, and was scheduled for a series in Dixon, Illinois in late November. Two weeks later in near mid-December she was listed as a guest at a breakfast while another presents a talk for the meeting.|$|E
25|$|As {{the central}} {{cohesive}} {{element of the}} Axe historique (historic axis, a sequence of monuments and grand thoroughfares on a route running from {{the courtyard of the}} Louvre to the Grande <b>Arche</b> de la Défense), the Arc de Triomphe was designed by Jean Chalgrin in 1806, and its iconographic program pits heroically nude French youths against bearded Germanic warriors in chain mail. It set the tone for public monuments with triumphant patriotic messages.|$|E

25|$|The {{evidence}} in the ancient sources does not make clear how {{the relation between the}} two principles should be understood. They do, however, consistently accord the One a higher status than the Indefinite Dyad and consider only the One as absolutely transcendent. This implies a monistic interpretation of the two principles and fits with assertions in the dialogues that suggest a monistic philosophy. Plato's Meno says that everything in nature is related, and the Republic states that there is an origin (<b>archḗ)</b> for all things, which can be grasped by reason.|$|E
25|$|The 20th century {{brought along}} new {{architectural}} styles; including expressionism, best {{exemplified by the}} designs of architect Peder Vilhelm Jensen-Klint, which relied heavily on Scandinavian brick Gothic traditions; and Nordic Classicism, which enjoyed brief popularity {{in the early decades}} of the century. It was in the 1960s that Danish architects such as Arne Jacobsen entered the world scene with their highly successful Functionalist architecture. This, in turn, has evolved into more recent world-class masterpieces including Jørn Utzon's Sydney Opera House and Johan Otto von Spreckelsen's Grande <b>Arche</b> de la Défense in Paris, paving the way for a number of contemporary Danish designers such as Bjarke Ingels to be rewarded for excellence both at home and abroad.|$|E
25|$|For documenta VI (1977), Serra {{designed}} Terminal, four 41-foot-tall trapezoids {{that form}} a tower, situated {{in front of}} the main exhibition venue. After long negotiations, accompanied by violent protests, Terminal was purchased by the city of Bochum and finally installed at the city's train station in 1979. Carnegie (1984–85), a 39-foot-high vertical shaft outside the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh, received high praise. Similar sculptures, like Fulcrum (1987), Axis (1989), and Torque (1992), were later installed in London's Broadgate, at Kunsthalle Bielefeld, and at Saarland University, respectively. Initially located in the French town of Puteaux, Slat (1985) consists of five steel plates - four trapezoidal and one rectangular - each one roughly 12 feet wide and 40 feet tall, that lean on one another to form a tall, angular tepee. Already in 1989 vandalism and graffiti prompted that town’s mayor to remove it, and only in December 2008, after almost 20 years in storage, Slat was re-anchored in La Défense. Because of its weight, officials chose to ground it in a traffic island behind the Grande <b>Arche.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{architecture}} of Denmark has {{its origins in}} the Viking age but became recognizable in the Middle Ages when first Romanesque, then Gothic churches and cathedrals sprang up throughout the country. Inspired by French castles and {{with the assistance of}} Dutch designers, architecture during the Renaissance flourished with magnificent royal palaces. Neoclassicism came to Denmark from France and, in the 19th century, slowly merged into the National Romantic style when Danish designers came into their own. It was, however, not until {{the last half of the}} 20th century that Danish architects entered the world scene with their highly successful Functionalism. This, in turn, has evolved into more recent world-class designers such as Johann Otto von Spreckelsen who designed the Grande <b>Arche</b> in Paris. Internationally, perhaps the most celebrated of all is the architect who designed the iconic Sydney Opera House, Jørn Utzon, but within Danish borders, it is the architect Arne Jacobsen who is perhaps held in highest esteem for developing the 'Danish Modern' style and furniture/interior design, such as the now world-famous and much sought-after Swan and Egg chairs. A new wave of young Danish architects are rising into international prominence, like Bjarke Ingels with works such as the Danish National Pavilion at the Shanghai 2010 Expo.|$|E
25|$|After rendezvousing with Chester, {{the party}} meets Trinicus D. Morrison, {{one of the}} four heroes who sealed Dhaos away years ago, who reveals that their parents were once his comrades and is shocked to {{discover}} that Cress and Mint's pendants were stolen. Following him to a nearby mausoleum, the group encounters Mars just as he uses the pendants to break the seal on Dhaos's tomb, setting him free. As Mars is killed by the dark sorcerer after asking for his power, Trinicus laments that no force in this time can possibly stop Dhaos, and uses his magic to send Cress and Mint back through time to seek out a means to do so while Chester stays behind to cover their escape. The two arrive one hundred years in the past to a time before Dhaos was initially sealed, where the villain is currently waging a war with his demon armies against the human kingdoms. Learning that only magic can harm him, they seek the aid of a young mage named <b>Arche</b> Klein, and summoner named Claus F. Lester, who accompany them to Dhaos's castle. After a fierce showdown, Dhaos escapes once again, and the party makes their way to an ancient city called Thor that houses a functional time machine to return to the future.|$|E
25|$|The {{second term}} {{was marked by}} the {{creation}} of the Insertion Minimum Revenue (RMI), which ensured a minimum level of income to those deprived of any other form of income; the restoring of the solidarity tax on wealth, which had been abolished by Chirac's cabinet; the institution of the Generalized social tax; the extension of parental leave up to the child's third birthday; the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy; the 1990 Gayssot Act on hate speech and Holocaust denial; the Besson law of 1990; the Mermaz Law of 1989;, the introduction of a private childcare allowance; the Urban Orientation Law of 1991; the Arpaillange Act on the financing of political parties; the reform of the penal code; the Matignon Agreements concerning New Caledonia; the Evin Act on smoking in public places; the extension of the age limit for family allowances to 18 years in 1990; and the 1989 Education Act which, amongst other measures, obliged local authorities to educate all children with disabilities. Several large architectural works were pursued, in what would become known as the Grands Projets of François Mitterrand with the building of the Louvre Pyramid, the Channel Tunnel, the Grande <b>Arche</b> at La Défense, the Bastille Opera, the Finance Ministry in Bercy, and the National Library of France. On 16 February 1993, President Mitterrand inaugurated in Fréjus a memorial to the wars in Indochina.|$|E
