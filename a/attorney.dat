5|$|Ace <b>Attorney</b> Investigations 2 was {{produced}} by Motohide Eshiro and directed by Takeshi Yamazaki, and features character designs by Tatsuro Iwamoto and music by Noriyuki Iwadare. Takuro Fuse, who would later become the character designer and art director for Ace <b>Attorney,</b> {{was in charge of}} the game's event images, and the opening and ending sequences to the episodes. While the original Ace <b>Attorney</b> Investigations had taken longer than usual for an Ace <b>Attorney</b> game to develop due to its several new gameplay systems that had to be created from scratch, Ace <b>Attorney</b> Investigations 2 went faster due to it already having a base game to build upon, resulting in the developers being able to put more focus on the game's story. According to Eshiro and Yamazaki, one of the major changes compared to the first Ace <b>Attorney</b> Investigations was the addition of an interrogation game mechanic; they chose to present it metaphorically as a game of chess, which was Edgeworth's favorite game. Another such change was the graphical improvements to the game's sprites and background art.|$|E

40|$|Historically, {{bankruptcy}} <b>attorneys</b> {{received the}} short end of the stick and were paid less for their services than <b>attorneys</b> in other fields of law. With the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, Congress attempted to reduce the discrepancy in compensation. However, after the Supreme Court’s decision in Baker Botts v. ASARCO; L. L. C., the playing field remains unequal for bankruptcy <b>attorneys.</b> Following this decision, if a debtor disputes their <b>attorney’s</b> fee application, <b>attorneys</b> are at a disadvantage and cannot recover fees for defending their fee application. As a result, bankruptcy <b>attorneys</b> take an effective pay cut if they are faced with a fee application dispute, because they must either settle or litigate. Without adequate safeguards in place, the Supreme Court has left bankruptcy <b>attorneys</b> defenseless. This Note argues that creating a higher standard for disputing fee applications, one involving the United States Trustee’s Office more, would protect bankruptcy <b>attorneys</b> from prejudicial treatment and fix the unfair situation they are currently placed in...|$|R
