The second ridge, of greater elevation, produces excellent crops of turnips and potatoes, with wheat, barley, and oats; and the interval between it and the third ridge is partly good meadow land, but chiefly moss, which might at a moderate expense be brought into tillage. The third ridge, and the highest, extends through the whole length of the parish; it is arable on the acclivities nearly to the summit, and though less fertile than the others, yields remunerating crops. The Nith, of which the water is beautifully limpid, abounds with salmon, grilse, and herlings, even beyond what is necessary for the supply of the surrounding district.

Current FACE systems employ control algorithms based on classically derived two- or three-term control laws with manually tuned parameters.

Nine fields with winter cereals (4 x wheat, 2 x spelt, 2 x barley, lx rye), three rape fields, five spring cultures (3 x maize, lx soybeans, lx potatoes) and an <b>arable</b> <b>meadow</b> were studied. In winter cereals, more carabid species were found than in spring cultures. In barley, we recorded fewer carabid species and individuals, larger numbers of hygrophilaus carabids and a more even population structure than in the other cereals.

In the springcultures, we found less species and individuals than in cereals or rape. but a lügher share of xerothermophilous carabid species. There were significant differences in the carabid populations on the two farms, which might be explained by the different farming methods. One farm is managed organically, while the other farm applies integrated production. Among others, organic farms are not allowed to use herbicides. Therefore, the weed flora on organic fields is generally richer than on other fields, and the microclimate on the soil smface can be favourable. From April to June, Poecilus CUJJreus was the most frequent carabid species on both farms. In July, P. cupreus was still the most abundant carabid on the organic farm, while Pterostichus melanarius became the most abundant carabid on the integrated farm. Due to the bigher weed diversity Amara plebeja, A. fami/iaris,Diachmmus germanus and Stenolophus teutonus occurred mostly more abundant on the organic fields...|$|E

A sequential fractional procedure was employed to separate the Fe into fractions: water soluble and exchangeable Fe (I), Fe specifically adsorbed with carbonates (II), reducibly releasable Fe in oxides (III), Fe bonded with organic matter (IV) and Fe structurally bonded in silicates (residual fraction) (V). The soil pH, cation exchange capacity, and size fractions (clay and silt) had a strongest influence {{on the distribution of}} the different forms of Fe. The different extraction methods showed similar patterns of the Fe content in <b>arable</b> and <b>meadow</b> soils. However, the DTPA iron did not correspond with the total iron, which confirms the widespread incidence of iron-deficiency in vertisols is independent of the total iron in soils. The amount of exchangeable (fraction I) and specifically adsorbed (II) iron showed no dependence on its content in the other fractions, indicating low mobility of iron in vertisols. The strong positive correlation (r = 0. 812 and 0. 956) between the content of iron in HNO 3 and HF and its contents in the primary and secondary minerals (fraction – V) indicate a low content of plant accessible iron in the vertisol.
