5|$|The rooms {{above the}} {{clockwork}} mechanism {{were used by}} the city administration for various purposes up until the late 20th century, including as archives, storerooms, as a firehose magazine and even as an <b>air</b> <b>raid</b> <b>shelter.</b> The interior was frequently remodelled in a careless, even vandalistic fashion; for instance, all but three of the original wooden beams supporting the intermediate floors were destroyed. Since 1979, the tower's interior is empty again. It is only accessed for maintenance {{and in the course}} of regular guided tours.|$|E
5|$|A {{scheme was}} devised during the Second World War to protect major cities from enemy bombing by {{lighting}} decoy fires on nearby open land. Manchester {{was protected by}} four of these Starfish sites as they were known, two of them on Chat Moss. RAF Balloon Command {{was responsible for the}} administration and manning of the sites, which were fully operational by 23January 1941. Each consisted of an <b>air</b> <b>raid</b> <b>shelter</b> for the crew along with various devices to simulate street lighting and the explosions of incendiary bombs. The effectiveness of the decoy sites is uncertain, and they were closed in 1943.|$|E
5|$|As KG 53 retreated out to sea, the German bombers dumped their bombs. Around 32 German bombs fell on {{the town}} of Shoeburyness. Two houses were {{destroyed}} and 20 damaged. One bomb landed on an Anderson <b>Air</b> <b>Raid</b> <b>Shelter,</b> killing {{a man and his}} wife. Another landed on the railway signal box, killing the signalman. Several bombs fell on a War Department gunnery range, causing no damage. Some 200 German bombs {{fell on the}} mud flats and sandbanks off Shoeburyness. Many were delayed-action bombs, and went off at irregular intervals.|$|E
50|$|During World War II, {{concerns}} about <b>air</b> <b>raids</b> by Japan {{resulted in the}} construction of many <b>air</b> <b>raid</b> <b>shelters</b> in Brisbane. Two <b>air</b> <b>raid</b> <b>shelters</b> were constructed at the eastern and western ends of Raymond Park. Although most <b>air</b> <b>raid</b> <b>shelters</b> were demolished after the war, the eastern and western <b>air</b> <b>raid</b> <b>shelters</b> in Raymond Park are among the handful to survive, albeit with their outer walls removed. They are listed on the Queensland Heritage Register.|$|R
50|$|The Public Works Department was {{responsible}} for the enforcement of orders issued under the National Security (General) Regulations, relating to the provision of <b>air</b> <b>raid</b> <b>shelters</b> {{for the protection of the}} public. Local authorities were responsible for the construction of public <b>air</b> <b>raid</b> <b>shelters,</b> as well as for enforcing orders relating to the provision of shelters by building owners. Hotels, flats and boarding houses occupied by 15 or more people, or buildings in which 30 or more worked, were required to provide <b>air</b> <b>raid</b> <b>shelters</b> for those people. Local authorities were responsible for the construction of public <b>air</b> <b>raid</b> <b>shelters</b> and in the event that this was not possible the Public Works Department would supply the men and materials required. However, in most circumstances the local authority carried out the works. A list of public <b>air</b> <b>raid</b> <b>shelters</b> required for construction by local governments was published in the Government Gazette on 23 December 1941.|$|R

5|$|In October 1941, Reggie {{was offered}} a post as {{lecturer}} at Farouk University in Alexandria. The couple moved from Cairo to share a flat with fellow teacher Robert Liddell. The Germans regularly bombed the city, and the raids terrified Manning, who irritated Reggie and Liddell by insisting that all three descend to the <b>air</b> <b>raid</b> <b>shelter</b> whenever the sirens wailed. Almost immediately after her arrival in Alexandria came devastating news of her brother Oliver's death in a plane crash. The emotional upset this caused prevented her from writing novels for several years.|$|E
5|$|Nearby is {{the former}} site of St. Mary's (Whitechapel Road) tube station. It opened in March 1884 but its close {{proximity}} to both Whitechapel and Aldgate East tube stations made it superfluous, leading to its closure in April 1938. It {{was used as an}} <b>air</b> <b>raid</b> <b>shelter</b> in the Second World War, but was destroyed by bombing in 1940. Opposite to the south {{is the former}} Royal London Hospital building, built in 1740. The hospital suffered significant structural damage during the Second World War, but much of the 18th and 19th centuries architecture still remains. A new building now sits adjacent to the original.|$|E
5|$|Grič Tunnel was not {{mentioned}} again in media until 1993, when {{it served as}} the site of the Under City Rave, one of the first raves in Croatia, which was organized by the staff of the TV show Top DJ Mag, and featured DJs from as far as Germany and the UK. At the time, the tunnel was under ownership of the Museum of Contemporary Art. The event was attended by over 3,000 people, far more than the organisers planned for and the tunnel infrastructure allowed for. In 1994, it was part of an exhibition celebrating Earth Day. During the Croatian War of Independence (1991–95), the tunnel saw some use in its intended capacity as an <b>air</b> <b>raid</b> <b>shelter.</b> During this time, temporary toilets were built at the Radić Street exit.|$|E

5|$|The first mass exterminations at Auschwitz {{took place}} in early September 1941, when 900 inmates were killed by {{gathering}} them {{in the basement of}} Block 11 and gassing them with Zyklon B. This building proved unsuitable for mass gassings, so the site of the killings was moved to the crematorium at Auschwitz I (Crematorium I, which operated until July 1942). There, more than 700 victims could be killed at once. In order to keep the victims calm, they were told they were to undergo disinfection and de-lousing. They were ordered to undress outside and then were locked in the building and gassed. After its decommissioning as a gas chamber, the building was converted to a storage facility and later served as an <b>air</b> <b>raid</b> <b>shelter</b> for the SS. The gas chamber and crematorium were reconstructed after the war using the original components, which remained on site. Some 60,000 people were killed at Crematorium I.|$|E
5|$|In 1934 the Cunard Steamship Company {{merged with}} the White Star Line to form Cunard White Star Line, which became the largest {{passenger}} steamship company in the world, helping to make Liverpool {{one of the most}} important centres of the British trans-Atlantic ocean liner industry. The Cunard building subsequently acted as the central headquarters for the newly merged firm, with both administrative and ship-designing facilities located within the building. Many ships and liners were developed and designed at the Cunard Building, including the RMS Queen Mary and RMS Queen Elizabeth. Given that Liverpool was a major trans-Atlantic port and due to the building's proximity to the River Mersey, the lower floors of the Cunard Building were allocated to provide space for cruise liner passengers, both prior to and after sailing. Within the building there were passenger facilities including separate waiting rooms for first, second and third class passengers, a booking hall, luggage storage space, and a currency exchange. The building also provided facilities for both land and sea based Cunard employees. During the Second World War, the sub-basement level of the Cunard Building was used as an <b>air</b> <b>raid</b> <b>shelter</b> for workers in the building and also for those from adjacent premises. The basement levels also served as the central Air Raid Precautions headquarters for the City of Liverpool during the war. Additional reinforced steel joists were fitted to further strengthen the basement in case of a direct hit on the building.|$|E

25|$|In the 19th century Edinburgh's second railway, the Edinburgh, Leith and Newhaven Railway, built {{a tunnel}} under the New Town to link Scotland Street with Canal Street (later absorbed into Waverley Station). After its closure, the tunnel {{was used to}} grow mushrooms, and during World War 2 as an <b>air</b> <b>raid</b> <b>shelter.</b>|$|E
25|$|The mill site {{contains}} {{a wide variety}} of subsidiary buildings, including stabling, a linhay, a gas retort house (see below), a carpenter's workshop, an <b>air</b> <b>raid</b> <b>shelter</b> from WWII, worker's cottages, and the manager's house. The tail race which takes the water away from the waterwheel is unusual in that it runs under the combing shed in a wide culvert, before briefly reappearing and then running underground again for some 200 metres.|$|E
25|$|Xining was {{subjected}} to aerial bombardment by Japanese warplanes in 1941, causing all ethnicities in Qinghai to unite against the Japanese. General Han Youwen directed {{the defense of the}} city of Xining during air raids by Japanese planes. Han survived an aerial bombardment by Japanese planes in Xining while he was being directed via telephone by Ma Bufang, who hid in an <b>air</b> <b>raid</b> <b>shelter</b> in a military barracks. The bombing resulted Han being buried in rubble, though he was later rescued.|$|E

25|$|Most gas {{chambers}} were dismantled {{or destroyed}} as the Soviet troops approached, {{except for those}} at Dachau, Sachsenhausen and Majdanek. The gas chamber at Auschwitz I was amongst those blown up. It was reconstructed after the war to stand as a memorial, albeit with the entry door and the wall that originally separated the gas chamber from a washroom removed. The door that had been added when the gas chamber was converted into an <b>air</b> <b>raid</b> <b>shelter</b> was left intact.|$|E
25|$|Starting {{with the}} {{construction}} of the B-Tunnel for the Frankfurt U-Bahn facilities in 1971, a subterranean level was added in front of the main building, featuring the city's first public escalator and including a large shopping mall, one station each for the U-Bahn and S-Bahn trains, an <b>air</b> <b>raid</b> <b>shelter</b> and a public car park. The subterranean stations were opened in 1978 and were built in the cut and cover method, which involved the demolition of the second northern hall and rebuilding it after the stations were completed.|$|E
25|$|Owned by Synter, {{the club}} {{originally}} opened on 16 January 1957 as a jazz-only club, {{which was one}} of three jazz clubs he managed. He styled the club after the Paris venue, Le Caveau, as the French club was also a cellar. The Cavern was an arched cellar built of bricks, under a seven-storey fruit warehouse. It had previously been used as a wine cellar, and as an <b>air</b> <b>raid</b> <b>shelter</b> during World War II. Because of its position underground, it was well known as being damp, and very hot when the club was full.|$|E

25|$|In Stockport, {{six miles}} south of Manchester, four sets of {{underground}} <b>air</b> <b>raid</b> <b>shelter</b> tunnels for civilian use were dug into the red sandstone on which the town centre stands. Preparation started in September 1938 and {{the first set of}} shelters was opened on 28 October 1939. (Stockport was not bombed until 11 October 1940.) The smallest of the tunnel shelters could accommodate 2,000 people and the largest 3,850 (subsequently expanded to take up to 6,500 people.) The largest of the Stockport Air Raid Shelters {{are open to the public}} as part of the town's museum service.|$|E

Although much reduced from its original size, it still offers features of historical significance and includes a grotto, the Hog Pit Pond, and a recently rediscovered <b>air</b> <b>raid</b> <b>shelter.</b> Hog Pit is now empty of water, and takes the form of an amphitheatre which is utilised as the main stage for the annual Environmental Fair, which the park plays host to - see Events.|$|E
25|$|In 1971, workers digging an <b>air</b> <b>raid</b> <b>shelter</b> for a {{hospital}} near Changsha unearthed {{the tomb of}} Xin Zhui, {{as well as the}} tombs of her husband and a young man who is most commonly thought to be their son. With the assistance of over 1,500 local high school students, archaeologists began a large excavation of the site beginning in January 1972. Xin Zhui's body was found within four rectangular pine constructs that sat inside one another which were buried beneath layers of charcoal and white clay. The corpse was wrapped in twenty layers of clothing bound with silk ribbons.|$|E
