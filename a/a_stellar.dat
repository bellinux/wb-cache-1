5|$|The mass of Beta Pictoris {{has been}} {{determined}} by using models of stellar evolution and fitting them to the star's observed properties. This method yields <b>a</b> <b>stellar</b> mass between 1.7 and 1.8 solar masses. The star's angular diameter has been measured using interferometry with the Very Large Telescope and {{was found to be}} 0.84 milliarcseconds. Combining this value with the distance of 63.4 light years gives a radius 1.8 times that of the Sun.|$|E
5|$|The {{rotation}} {{of a star}} produces an equatorial bulge due to centrifugal force. As stars are not solid bodies, they can also undergo differential rotation. Thus the equator of the star can rotate at a different angular velocity than the higher latitudes. These differences {{in the rate of}} rotation within a star may have {{a significant role in the}} generation of <b>a</b> <b>stellar</b> magnetic field.|$|E

50|$|Since the {{inclination}} of the orbit is unknown, only a lower bound on {{the mass of}} the planet can be determined. The object has at least 170% times the mass of Jupiter. However, these values for the semimajor axis and planetary mass are based on <b>an</b> adopted <b>stellar</b> mass of 2.17 times {{the mass of the}} Sun. More recent results by Jofré et al. (2015) give <b>a</b> lower <b>stellar</b> mass estimate of 1.20 solar masses.|$|R
5|$|Based on this star's {{kinematic}} properties, {{it appears}} to belong to <b>a</b> <b>stellar</b> association called the Castor Moving Group. However, Vega may be much older than this group, so the membership remains uncertain. This group contains about 16 stars, including Alpha Librae, Alpha Cephei, Castor, Fomalhaut and Vega. All {{members of the group}} are moving in nearly the same direction with similar space velocities. Membership in a moving group implies a common origin for these stars in an open cluster that has since become gravitationally unbound. The estimated age of this moving group is , and they have an average space velocity of 16.5km/s.|$|E
5|$|By 1508, {{construction}} work was completed {{at the north}} of the Loggia, which contained the staircase to access the upper level of the public building. The construction is designed as a body in itself, separated from the main building by a path and connected to it by a covered overpass, a configuration that has come down to us intact. The contribution of Cairano, who at that point returned to the Loggia after at least five years of <b>a</b> <b>stellar</b> career elsewhere, is the portal to the ground floor of the annex and in some ornamentation on the overpass.|$|E
5|$|In roughly 5billion years, the Sun will {{cool and}} expand outward to many times its current {{diameter}} (becoming a red giant), before casting off its outer layers as a planetary nebula and leaving behind <b>a</b> <b>stellar</b> remnant {{known as a}} white dwarf. In the far distant future, the gravity of passing stars will gradually reduce the Sun's retinue of planets. Some planets will be destroyed, others ejected into interstellar space. Ultimately, {{over the course of}} tens of billions of years, {{it is likely that the}} Sun will be left with none of the original bodies in orbit around it.|$|E

5|$|Kennedy {{was raised}} in the small Ontario town of Humberstone, now Port Colborne. Kennedy was born just eleven days after his father was killed in a hunting accident. His mother, left alone to raise four children, took a job at the local hockey arena which became Kennedy's second home. After <b>a</b> <b>stellar</b> junior hockey career, Kennedy first came to the {{attention}} of the Montreal Canadiens and attended their training camp while still in high school. However, after some disappointing experiences with Montreal management he signed shortly afterward with the Maple Leafs.|$|E
5|$|Over time {{intervals}} of around 30 trillion years, the Sun will undergo a close encounter with another star. As a consequence, {{the orbits of}} their planets can become disrupted, potentially ejecting them from the system entirely. If Earth is not destroyed by the expanding red giant Sun in 7.6 billion years and not ejected from its orbit by <b>a</b> <b>stellar</b> encounter, its ultimate fate will be that it collides with the black dwarf Sun due to the decay of its orbit via gravitational radiation, in 1020 (100 quintillion) years.|$|E
5|$|Riegels did play, and {{he turned}} in <b>a</b> <b>stellar</b> second half performance, {{including}} blocking a Tech punt. In addition, Lom passed for a touchdown and kicked the extra point, {{but that was not}} enough. Tech would ultimately win the game and their second national championship 8–7. Georgia Tech's safety score after the wrong way run made the difference in the outcome of the game, which increased the significance of Roy's mistake. In spite of the loss, the example of how the distraught Riegels was persuaded to pick himself up, return to the field and play so hard during the second half is sometimes used by motivational speakers to illustrate overcoming setbacks.|$|E

5|$|The {{most recent}} disk {{responsible}} for these phase changes was formed in 1972. What's intriguing, however, is that Pleione's long-term polarimetric observations show the intrinsic polarization angle has changed, providing direct evidence for a spatial motion of the disk axis. Because Pleione has <b>a</b> <b>stellar</b> companion with a relatively close orbit, the shift in the polarization angle {{has been attributed to}} the companion causing a precession (wobble) of the disk, with a precession period of roughly 81 years.|$|E
5|$|The {{science of}} stellar {{spectroscopy}} was pioneered by Joseph von Fraunhofer and Angelo Secchi. By comparing the spectra of {{stars such as}} Sirius to the Sun, they found differences in the strength and number of their absorption lines—the dark lines in <b>a</b> <b>stellar</b> spectra caused by the atmosphere's absorption of specific frequencies. In 1865 Secchi began classifying stars into spectral types. However, the modern version of the stellar classification scheme was developed by Annie J. Cannon during the 1900s.|$|E
5|$|The star is {{estimated}} to be less than a billion years old. Because of its relative youth, Epsilon Eridani has a higher level of magnetic activity than the present-day Sun, with <b>a</b> <b>stellar</b> wind 30 times as strong. Its rotation period is 11.2days at the equator. Epsilon Eridani is smaller and less massive than the Sun, and has a comparatively lower level of elements heavier than helium. It is a main-sequence star of spectral class K2, which means that energy generated at the core through nuclear fusion of hydrogen is emitted from the surface at a temperature of about , giving it an orange hue.|$|E
