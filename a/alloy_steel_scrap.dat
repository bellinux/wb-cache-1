40|$|Today, the <b>alloy</b> {{content in}} <b>steel</b> <b>scrap</b> {{deliveries}} in Sweden {{are determined by}} the waste management company by test melts. Random sampling analysis (RSA) is an alternative method, under development, to determine the <b>alloy</b> composition of <b>steel</b> <b>scrap.</b> This method evaluates the alloy composition of the steel delivery based on a number of randomly chosen <b>steel</b> <b>scrap</b> unit. RSA is a surface analysis, it is done on a distributed area where {{with the help of a}} grid, marks the random <b>steel</b> <b>scrap</b> units for evaluation. This means that the surface fraction determines the odds of analyzing the <b>steel</b> <b>scrap.</b> In a previous study of RSA, 100 random pieces of scrap units was evaluated for its alloy composition with Optical Emission Spectroscopy (OES). These scrap deliveries were thereafter sent to an Electric Arc Furnace for melting. This was done to compare the RSA analysis with samples taken after scrap melting. The RSA study however assumes that the scrap units have the same weight. In this study, the weights of the scrap units in the RSA was assumed to have a variance. Using MATLABÂ® and the alloy composition data acquired from the old study, a simulation was made where 100 pieces and 100 analyses was made to see what the margin of error in comparison to the old study. Another goal with this study was to see if the variance of the weight had any relation to the absolute deviation of each element in the alloy composition. The results showed that there was no relation between the absolute deviation of each element and the weight distribution in the population. This indicates that there are other factors involved other than the weight distribution in the samples. The average margin of error for all the elements was calculated to 5. 94 % for the weight distribution of 0. 1 : 0. 1 : 10 kg. This indicates that RSA is accurate or close in analysis for old <b>steel</b> <b>scrap</b> deliveries even if the weight distribution is 0. 1 : 0. 1 : 10 kg. The highest margin of error was obtained for W, Ce and Ti with a margin of error of 18. 6 %, 14. 89 % and 10. 71 % respectively. All the other elements had a margin of error beneath 10 %. This indicates that for RSA on old <b>steel</b> <b>scrap</b> deliveries a margin of error of 10 % would be a good benchmark on the accuracy of the analysis...|$|R

40|$|The {{results from}} this study show that it is {{possible}} to obtain data series on the <b>steel</b> <b>scrap</b> collection based on mass balance model on the crude steel production figures by steelmaking reactor type and additional knowledge on process metallurgy as well as information on inputs and outputs into the reactors with an area correlation coefficient of 0, 91 compared to data obtained from trade statistics. Furthermore, the study shows that based on a new method it is possible to calculate the time duration of mass flows on a continuous basis. Furthermore, two complementary statistical dynamic material flow models that can be used to calculate the societal recycling rates of steel was constructed. These statistical models contribute to a standardized way of obtaining consistent results. The new models are able to segregate the non-recirculated amounts of steel into the hibernating steel stock available for future collection from the amounts of losses based on statistics. The results show {{that it is possible to}} calculate the amounts of <b>steel</b> <b>scrap</b> available for steelmaking at a given point in time. In addition, based on the new models it is possible to calculate recycling trends in society. Also, the models are able to calculate robust forecasts on the long-term availability of <b>steel</b> <b>scrap,</b> and test if forecast demand of <b>steel</b> <b>scrap</b> exceeds a full recovery. This due to that the <b>steel</b> <b>scrap</b> generation is a function of the collection rate of <b>steel</b> <b>scrap.</b> Also, a method for obtaining representative samplings on the <b>alloy</b> content in <b>steel</b> <b>scrap</b> called random sampling analysis (RSA) was developed.
