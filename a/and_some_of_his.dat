5|$|After France surrendered, Marcinkus {{managed to}} make his way to the French colonies in Africa (Morocco and Algeria). He decided to go to Great Britain and {{continue}} fighting, but the French army's terms of armistice at Compiègne and tensions between Britain and France made this difficult. On 12 August 1940 he was finally demobilized from the French army. Marcinkus <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> associates concocted a daring plan to commandeer several aircraft without authorization and fly to England. The plan was not executed due to increased security at airfields and other circumstances. He finally received the necessary documents enabling him to go to Britain in autumn of 1940.|$|E
5|$|After Symeon's death his {{writings}} were kept alive by {{small groups of}} followers, eventually {{becoming one of the}} central teachings of the hesychast movement. Many copies of his works were made in the following centuries, particularly around the 14th century, and among the Eastern Orthodox monasteries on Mt. Athos. His recognition has always been greater outside the official church, its calendar and liturgy. Historians credit this to his zealous personality, his criticism of the church hierarchy, his emphasis on direct experience of God, <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> unorthodox teachings—including his belief that an unordained monk who had the direct experience of God was empowered to absolve others of their sins.|$|E
5|$|After the Battle of Culloden in 1746, it was rumoured that Prince Charles Edward Stuart <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> senior Jacobite aides {{had escaped}} to St Kilda. An {{expedition}} was launched, and {{in due course}} British soldiers were ferried ashore to Hirta. They found a deserted village, as the St Kildans, fearing pirates, had fled to caves to the west. When they were persuaded to come down, the soldiers discovered that the isolated natives knew nothing of the Prince and {{had never heard of}} King George II either. Paradoxically, Lady Grange's letters and her resultant evacuation from the island may have prevented her being found by this expedition.|$|E

5|$|Among her {{maternal}} ancestors was her great-great-great-grandmother, Melvinia Shields, a slave on Henry Walls Shields' 200-acre farm in Clayton County, Georgia. Melvinia's first son, Dolphus T. Shields, was biracial and {{born into}} slavery about 1860. Based on DNA and other evidence, in 2012 researchers {{said his father}} was likely 20-year-old Charles Marion Shields, son of her master. Melvinia did not talk to relatives about Dolphus' father. Dolphus Shields moved to Birmingham, Alabama after the Civil War, <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> children migrated to Cleveland, Ohio and Chicago.|$|E
5|$|Arriving in Brisbane for the Commonwealth Games, Brooks <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> fellow sprinters shaved their heads, {{something}} that received much {{attention from the}} Australian public. He won his heat of the 100m freestyle in a Commonwealth and Commonwealth Games record of 51.09s. He swam slower in the final, but his time of 51.14s was enough to secure {{the gold medal in}} a close contest. Just 0.43s separated him and the bronze and silver medallists Greg Fasala and Michael Delany, both of Australia.|$|E
5|$|But {{he became}} {{increasingly}} possessed by religious mysticism {{as he fell}} {{under the influence of}} the Polish philosopher Andrzej Towiański, whom he met in 1841. His lectures became a medley of religion and politics, punctuated by controversial attacks on the Catholic Church, and thus brought him under censure by the French government. The messianic element conflicted with Roman Catholic teachings, <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> works were placed on the Church's list of prohibited books, though both Mickiewicz and Towiański regularly attended Catholic mass and encouraged their followers to do so.|$|E

5|$|Chaplin {{developed}} {{a passion for}} music {{as a child and}} taught himself to play the piano, violin, and cello. He considered the musical accompaniment of a film to be important, and from A Woman of Paris onwards he took an increasing interest in this area. With the advent of sound technology, Chaplin began using a synchronised orchestral soundtrack – composed by himself – for City Lights (1931). He thereafter composed the scores for all of his films, and from the late 1950s to his death, he scored all of his silent features <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> short films.|$|E
5|$|Due to a {{constitutional}} quirk, Metcalfe's term {{was scheduled to}} begin eight days before the expiration of Desha's. Desha charged that Metcalfe was not allowing him to finish out his term and threatened not to vacate the governor's mansion until his term officially ended. Clark records as legend that, after drinking heavily at a local tavern, Metcalfe <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> supporters formed a mob {{and went to the}} governor's mansion to evict him by force. Accounts in the local newspapers of the time instead record that the Deshas left the mansion peacefully without intervention by Metcalfe.|$|E
5|$|During the half-time interval, a row erupted {{between the}} Birmingham manager <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> players about their fitness; in the Manchester City {{dressing}} room, a heated exchange {{took place between}} Barnes and Revie. Barnes had played defensively {{in the first half}} to counter the threat of Peter Murphy, but Revie urged him to play further forward. Meanwhile, manager Les McDowall exhorted his players to keep possession and make their opponents chase the ball.|$|E

5|$|Elements of Tristano's early playing – counterpoint, reharmonizing, {{and strict}} time – {{influenced}} Miles Davis' Birth of the Cool, and the playing of saxophonist Gerry Mulligan and pianist Dave Brubeck. Tristano's early, more feelings-based performances also influenced {{the style of}} pianist Bill Evans, who also used overdubbing and multitracking in his own recordings after Tristano had experimented with the techniques. Avant garde musician Anthony Braxton has often mentioned Tristano <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> students as influences.|$|E
5|$|Expectations for Schenn {{were high}} {{heading into the}} 2009–10 season. During {{training}} camp, Toronto Head Coach Ron Wilson named {{him as one of}} the team's top four defencemen. As the season progressed, however, Schenn's play was disappointing, and Wilson kept him out of the line-up for a game in October and again for a three-game stretch in December. Towards the end of the season, Schenn <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> younger teammates improved their play. In a game against the Ottawa Senators, Schenn posted his first career two-goal game, helping him finish the season with new career-highs in goals (5) and points (17) in 79 games played.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his term}} as governor, Powell {{was elected to}} the U.S. Senate. Before he could assume office, President James Buchanan {{dispatched}} Powell and Major Benjamin McCulloch to Utah to ease tensions with Brigham Young and the Mormons. Powell assumed his Senate seat on his return from Utah, just prior to the election of Abraham Lincoln as president. Powell became an outspoken critic of Lincoln's administration, {{so much so that the}} Kentucky General Assembly asked for his resignation <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> fellow senators tried to have him expelled from the body. Both groups later renounced their actions.|$|E
