5|$|<b>At</b> <b>room</b> <b>temperature,</b> it is a {{colourless}} gas, {{like all}} of the hydrogen halides except hydrogen fluoride, since hydrogen cannot form strong hydrogen bonds to the large and only mildly electronegative iodine atom. It melts at −51.0°C and boils at −35.1°C. It is an endothermic compound that can exothermically dissociate <b>at</b> <b>room</b> <b>temperature,</b> although the process is very slow unless a catalyst is present: the reaction between hydrogen and iodine <b>at</b> <b>room</b> <b>temperature</b> to give hydrogen iodide does not proceed to completion. The H–I bond dissociation energy is likewise {{the smallest of the}} hydrogen halides, at 295kJ/mol.|$|E

50|$|The Dulong - Petit law fails <b>at</b> <b>room</b> <b>temperatures</b> {{for light}} atoms bonded {{strongly}} to each other, {{such as in}} metallic beryllium, and in carbon as diamond.

5|$|The {{softness}} of copper partly explains its high electrical conductivity (59.6×106S/m) and high thermal conductivity, second highest (second only to silver) among pure metals <b>at</b> <b>room</b> <b>temperature.</b> This {{is because the}} resistivity to electron transport in metals <b>at</b> <b>room</b> <b>temperature</b> originates primarily from scattering of electrons on thermal vibrations of the lattice, which are relatively weak in a soft metal. The maximum permissible current density of copper in open air is approximately 3.1×106A/m2 of cross-sectional area, above which it begins to heat excessively.|$|E

5|$|Fluorine {{reacts with}} lead <b>at</b> <b>room</b> <b>temperature,</b> forming lead(II) fluoride.
