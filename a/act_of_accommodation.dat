40|$|Through {{the use of}} {{the recent}} {{litigation}} on renewable energy subsidies in the World Trade Organization (‘WTO’) as case-study, this paper highlights the importance of methodology in legal analysis and, in particular, of integrity, coherence and legitimacy. Reference is made to those cases where, in presence of pressing policy considerations, the adjudicator is led to commit serious errors in order to reach what is perceived as a just and desirable outcome. It is sometimes the case that adjudicators are called to distinguish a ‘good’ policy from a ‘bad’ one, and, if the regulatory framework is not sufficiently responsive to such distinctions, the <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>accommodation</b> of law and policy may lead to ‘ugly’ constructions of the law. The twist of this course of conduct is that the effects of legal interpretation tweaking might not be easily confined to the case at hand and may have broader, negative implications for the legal system at large. Rather than resolving into a simple criticism of adjudicating bodies, the paper argues that the ultimate responsibility for dispute settlement mistakes caused by policy pressures is that of law-makers and their inability to take the lead and reform the law...|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{distance}} that often separates grandparents from their young adult grandchildren, the abundance of new technologies provides numerous means of connection for the grandparent-grandchild (GP-GC) dyad. The {{purpose of this study}} was to understand how grandparents use technology, namely text messaging and Facebook, in relationships with their young adult grandchildren. Specifically, the aim was to understand grandparents' purposes for using these technologies with their grandchildren, their motivations for using these technologies, and their perceptions of these technologies. Qualitative interviews were conducted with 23 grandparent participants and analyzed according to the procedures delineated in grounded theory analysis. Both text messaging and Facebook emerged as important tools for connection, as text messaging encourages more frequent communication and Facebook helps grandparents "fill in the gaps" about their grandchildren's lives. Furthermore, results indicated that grandparents' uses of text messaging, and to a lesser extent Facebook, are <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>accommodation</b> to their grandchildren...|$|R
40|$|While many {{accounts}} of sex workers presume they lack agency, this project studies how people framed as powerless assert {{positions of power}} through social interactions, friendships, and organizing. I examine sex workers' politics and power {{from the perspective of}} a subset of female Costa Rican sex workers. I engage specifically with sex workers who organize, in order to theorize everyday experiences of politics, including solidarity building and <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>accommodation</b> or resistance vis-à-vis state interventions, health policies, and the police. Central theoretical bases for the project include Michael Hanchard and James Scott on "politics from below. " I also draw on the work of Michele Berger in order to advance Political Science literature and frameworks in regarding everyday and labor-related interactions, challenging and extending the field's understanding of the politics of work-related interactions. I position sex-work as a form of labor and analyze the role that informal interactions play in organizing. The project also engages a multi-disciplinary set of literatures, including key texts from feminist and gender studies as well as theoretical and empirical approaches to studies of race, ethnicity, discrimination, and social movements. I discuss the political valences of stigma against sex work by extending concepts of discrimination from African-American studies. This study examines micro and macro aspects of sex worker activism through resistance politics, empowerment strategies, and organizing. It also provides practical and theoretical insights on sex worker politics that can apply to other communities. The project's central questions are: 1) what kinds of political actions characterize sex workers' engagement in Costa Rica? and 2) how are informal and formal strategies used to organize sex workers? Unique among studies of sex work, I present a multi-level analysis of these perspectives in a Latin American context. As a case, Costa Rica highlights the diverse ways sex workers organize to resist the status quo. The dissertation examines three distinct but interconnected contexts: individual sex workers working in San José's zona roja (red zone); female sex workers who organize with the twenty-year-old sex worker project La Sala (The Living Room); and the international network of Latin American sex worker organizations, RedTraSex...|$|R
5000|$|One of the {{innovations}} from {{work with the}} Rehabilitation <b>Act</b> <b>of</b> 1973 as amended in 1978 was {{the application of the}} concept <b>of</b> reasonable <b>accommodations</b> to fields such as psychiatric disabilities. As part of deinstitutionalization efforts, now at the US Supreme Court's Olmstead Decision of 1999, [...] "long-term services and supports" [...] (LTSS) clients were seeking work in communities to support themselves (and sometimes families) in homes and daily lives. Systemic efforts were made to identify barriers to employment (e.g., Noble & Collignon, 1988), and legal avenues were also opened as described by Dr. Peter Blanck on the Americans with Disabilities <b>Act</b> <b>of</b> 1990. Reasonable <b>accommodation</b> [...] allowed modifications on the job, while still retaining the competitive job site and pay grades in the community. The term [...] "employment supports" [...] was also applied to efforts to assist individuals which may come to the rehabilitation system with a [...] "mental health diagnosis" [...] (Marrone, Bazell, & Gold, 1995). These efforts may resemble those termed [...] "natural supports" [...] since job retention (involving coworkers and supervisors), as opposed to job placement (a traditional rehabilitation counselor function) [...] may be key.|$|R

Methods The published literature since 1985 using randomized controlled studies <b>of</b> <b>ACT</b> was reviewed. In addition, site visits were made to several sites around the US to identify the range <b>of</b> <b>ACT</b> <b>accommodations</b> made.

40|$|We present {{organizational}} logics as a meso-level construct {{that lies}} between institutional theory's field-level logics and the sense-making activities of individual agents in organizations. We argue that an institutional logic can be operationalized empirically using {{the concept of}} a discourse – that is, a coherent symbolic system articulating what constitutes legitimate, reasonable, and effective conduct in, around, and by organizations. An organization may, moreover, be simultaneously exposed to several institutional logics that make up its broader ideational environment. Taking these three observations together enables us to consider an organizational logic as a spatially and temporally localized configuration of diverse discourses. We go on to show how organizational logics were transformed in the Australian Broadcasting Corporation between 1953 and 1999 by examining the changing discourses that appeared in the Corporation's annual reports. We argue that these discourses were modified through three main forms of discursive agency: (1) undertaking <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> ironic <b>accommodation</b> between competing discourses; (2) building chains of equivalence between the potentially contradictory discourses; and (3) reconciling new and old discourses through pragmatic <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> ‘bricolage’. We found that, using these forms of discursive agency, a powerful coalition of actors was able to transform the dominant organizational logic of the ABC from one where the Corporation's initial mission was to serve national interests through public service to one that was ultimately focused on participating in a globalized media market. Finally, we note that discursive resources could be used as the basis for resistance by less powerful agents, although further research is necessary to determine exactly how more powerful and less powerful agents interact around the establishment of an organizational logic...|$|R

The aim {{of the present study}} was to elucidate the biophysical mechanism <b>of</b> breakdown <b>of</b> <b>accommodation,</b> which at present is unknown.
