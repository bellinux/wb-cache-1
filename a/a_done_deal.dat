The Greens were seen to be stagnating, while the extraparliamentary parties faced difficulties with entering parliament, with the chances of LIF and the FRITZ intact.|$|E

The next day, the NBA, Hansen, and the Maloofs all released statements announcing the agreement, which also included the 12% minority stake of owner Robert Hernreich, and based the sale price on a team valuation of $525 million. Sacramento mayor Johnson offered a quick rebuttal to the announcement, stating that the agreement was not <b>a</b> <b>done</b> <b>deal</b> and that Sacramento would {{have the opportunity to}} present a counteroffer to the NBA.|$|E

25|$|Oxford (Harley) {{had refused}} to make a {{separate}} treaty between Britain and France, but ultimately he had excluded the Dutch from negotiating the preliminary articles of peace, which together with French ministers he would present to the States General as <b>a</b> <b>done</b> <b>deal.</b> After much cross-Channel diplomacy the final proposals were agreed. First, there were the vague public preliminaries made by Britain on behalf of itself and the Allies, namely: French recognition of Queen Anne and the Act of Settlement; a guarantee that the French and Spanish crowns would remain separate; a restoration of international commerce; protective 'barriers' for the Dutch Republic, Austria, and the Holy Roman Empire against future French aggression; and a secret agreement that France would cooperate in securing for the Duke of Savoy – Britain's close ally – those parts of Italy which the British deemed necessary to counter Habsburg domination. On top of these general concessions were the secret articles pertaining only to Britain, including negotiations for an Anglo-French commercial treaty, and the demolition of the privateer base of Dunkirk. There were also the advantages which Britain had previously hoped to gain by supporting the Habsburg cause in Spain and which were now to be granted by Philip V, including the cession of Gibraltar, Menorca, and the Asiento (slaving contract) for 30 years. The agreement was laid down as the Preliminary Articles of London, signed on 8 October 1711 (N.S.) by St. John and the Earl of Dartmouth for Great Britain, and Nicolas Mesnager for France.|$|E

500|$|In 2005 {{there was}} {{a tidal wave of}} new wizard rock bands. The {{brothers}} do-it-yourself musical ethos has caught on with bands forming as fellow Potter fans are picking up instruments for the first time. Like Harry and the Potters, these new bands also take on the persona, or dress as a Harry Potter-themed character. Though most fans of the music are previous fans of Harry Potter, some bands have attracted listeners outside of the Harry Potter fanbase. Paul and Joe are aware of around 200 other Harry Potter-related rock bands who at least record and post songs on the Internet. The Boston Phoenix wondered—in spite of fully booked calendars—how long wizard rock would last once there are no new stories to riff on, as their musical identity is contingent on the lasting success and popularity of a book series. [...] "In some ways," [...] said Paul, [...] "we want to tie things off and consider it <b>a</b> <b>done</b> <b>deal.</b> We’ve always viewed this as a project that had a finite life and end point." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 12 July 2017, Haye {{confirmed}} {{that had begun}} strengthening his ankle and he would slowly start training for his next fight which would likely take place in December 2017. On 24 July, negotiations had began for a rematch between Haye and Tony Bellew (28-2-1, 19 KOs) {{to take place in}} December 2017, although they were far from an agreement. Bellew made Haye of his preferred purse, which would reportedly make the rematch worth around £20 million. On 3 August, Hearn stated a rematch between Bellew and Haye was 'virtually dead', due to both fighters believing they are the A-side and have the right to demand ring walks, poster, changing rooms and split of purse. On 6 September, Hearn stated a deal could be made within seven days. According to Bellew's trainer, David Coldwell, both Haye and Bellew had held positive talks and looking more likely to agree to a fight, as long they stay on the same page and agree to the same terms. On 19 September, Haye agreed all the terms and tweeted Bellew to sign the contract. He said, [...] "It's taken months of negotiating but teams have finally agreed all terms for Haye-Bellew 2. Will Bellew put pen to paper?" [...] The fight was reported to take place on Sunday 17 December 2017. Promoter Eddie Hearn stated the fight was not <b>a</b> <b>done</b> <b>deal,</b> but he had hoped to confirm the fight within a week. Bellew replied the following day, tweeting, [...] "I OBLIGE YOU @mrdavidhaye , happy? Now leave me alone with my family please. I'll see you soon enough!" [...] The fight was officially confirmed on 29 September for the fight to take place at the O2 Arena in London. Bellew claimed the rematch wasn't personal anymore, just business and hoping to dedicate a win to his late brother-in-law, who had passed away in August. Haye stated that Bellew wouldn't win the lottery twice. Like the first fight, it was scheduled to be shown live on Sky Box Office.|$|E
