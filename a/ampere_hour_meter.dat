40|$|Six <b>ampere</b> <b>hour</b> {{individual}} {{pressure vessel}} nickel hydrogen cells were charge/discharge cycled to failure. Failure as used here is defined to {{occur when the}} end of discharge voltage degraded to 0. 9 volts.

Both cell designs were fabricated by the same manufacturer and represent {{current state of the}} art. A failure model was advanced which suggests both cell designs have inadequate volume tolerance characteristics. The limited existing data base at a deep depth of discharge (DOD) was expanded.
