25|$|Chief Justice John Marshall {{laid out}} in this opinion that the {{relationship}} between the Indian Nations and the United States is that of nations. He reasoned that the United States, in the character of the federal government, inherited the rights of Great Britain as they were held by that nation. Those rights, he stated, include the sole right to deal with the Indian nations in North America, to the exclusion of any other European power. This did not include the rights of possession to their land or political dominion over their laws. He acknowledged that the exercise of conquest and purchase can give political dominion, but those <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> the federal government, and individual states had no authority in American Indian affairs. Georgia's statute was therefore invalid.|$|E
500|$|Most of Scotland's castles, whether ruined or occupied, {{remain in}} private ownership, though many {{are open to}} the public at least occasionally. During the twentieth century a number of older castles were {{transferred}} into the care of the state, and these are now the responsibility of Historic Scotland, which was created as an agency in 1991. Historic Scotland cares for over 300 properties – all of which are publicly accessible – including around 65 castles. [...] These include some of Scotland's most famous castles including Edinburgh and Stirling, as well as numerous tower houses and ruined castles. The National Trust for Scotland (founded 1931) cares for several post-Medieval castles and estate houses, including Culzean and Craigievar that were still in occupation until the twentieth century. The Landmark Trust restores and operates historic buildings as holiday homes, including Saddell Castle and Roslin Castle. Several other castles <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> local government, for example Dudhope Castle in Dundee, and some are maintained by building preservation trusts and other charitable bodies, for example Sauchie Tower, Clackmannanshire.|$|E

Jeremy Freedman then appears on a TV screen in the ride cabin and assures the riders that their comfort and safety <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> highly qualified teens, like himself and explains the operators' requirements. He then tells the riders to enjoy themselves, but keep the screaming down so he can study for a math test, because if he does not get a C or higher, he will get kicked out of the audio-visual club. He then begins reading his textbook upside down (unknown to him) while quiet elevator music, utilizing part of the instrumental to [...] "The Simpsons Theme" [...] begins playing in the background. If the ride takes longer than usual to begin, a visual reading 'Krustyland, where fun takes a holiday," [...] with Krusty and Mr. Teeny dancing appears, and the music changes tempo, getting more upbeat.|$|E
500|$|Two stone flags—painted in {{the form}} of the Union Flag and the flags of the Royal Navy (the White Ensign), Merchant Navy (the Red Ensign), and Royal Air Force (the RAF Ensign)—appear to hang from each obelisk, draping around the cornices; each flag is surmounted by gold wreaths. Lutyens first {{proposed}} stone flags for use on the Cenotaph on Whitehall, but the proposal was rejected in favour of fabric flags (though they were used on several other memorials, including Rochdale Cenotaph and the Arch of Remembrance in Leicester). The stone is a monolith (carved from a single piece of rock), curved so slightly as to barely be visible to the naked eye, [...] long and devoid of any decoration beyond the inscriptions. Unusually, the Stone of Remembrance is inscribed on both faces. The east face bears the inscription Lutyens chose for all his Stones of Remembrance: [...] "THEIR NAME LIVETH / FOR EVERMORE", as suggested by Rudyard Kipling, truncated from a verse in the Book of Ecclesiastes; the west face is inscribed [...] "THE SOULS OF THE RIGHTEOUS / <b>ARE</b> <b>IN</b> <b>THE</b> <b>HANDS</b> <b>OF</b> GOD", from The Wisdom of Solomon.|$|E

2500|$|Justice Souter {{believed}} that {{the time had come}} to revisit the essential premise underpinning both the Court's opinion in United States v. Place and the majority's opinion in Caballes—that the sniff of a dog is infallible, and can reveal either the presence or absence of narcotics and nothing else. [...] "The infallible dog, however, is a creature of legal fiction.... Their supposed infallibility is belied by judicial opinions describing well-trained animals sniffing and alerting with less than perfect accuracy, whether owing to errors by their handlers, the limitations of the dogs themselves, or even the pervasive contamination of currency by cocaine." [...] Souter pointed to a study relied on by the State of Illinois in its reply brief, indicating that [...] "dogs in artificial testing situations return false positives anywhere from 12.5% to 60% of the time, depending on the length of the search." [...] If a dog is not infallible, then there is no logical basis for the sui generis rule underlying Place and Caballes, and every reason to investigate [...] "the actual function that dog sniffs perform." [...] Because the dogs <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> government agents determined to discover evidence of crime, the dog sniff is the [...] "first step in a process that may disclose intimate details without revealing contraband," [...] and hence is a [...] "search" [...] within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. In the context of a traffic stop, an additional search unrelated to the initial purpose of the stop requires reasonable suspicion. Since in this case the police did not have such suspicion, Justice Souter would have affirmed the decision of the Illinois Supreme Court.|$|E
