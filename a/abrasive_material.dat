500|$|Known to {{the ancient}} Greeks as ἀδάμας – adámas ("proper", [...] "unalterable", [...] "unbreakable") and {{sometimes}} called adamant, diamond is the hardest known naturally occurring material, scoring 10 on the Mohs scale of mineral hardness. Diamond is extremely strong owing {{to the structure of}} its carbon atoms, where each carbon atom has four neighbors joined to it with covalent bonds. The material boron nitride, when in a form structurally identical to diamond (zincblende structure), is nearly as hard as diamond; a currently hypothetical material, beta carbon nitride, may also be as hard or harder in one form. It has been shown that some diamond aggregates having nanometer grain size are harder and tougher than conventional large diamond crystals, thus they perform better as <b>abrasive</b> <b>material.</b> Owing to the use of those new ultra-hard materials for diamond testing, more accurate values are now known for diamond hardness. A surface perpendicular to the [...] crystallographic direction (that is the longest diagonal of a cube) of a pure (i.e., type IIa) diamond has a hardness value of 167GPa when scratched with an nanodiamond tip, while the nanodiamond sample itself has a value of 310GPa when tested with another nanodiamond tip. Because the test only works properly with a tip made of harder material than the sample being tested, the true value for nanodiamond is likely somewhat lower than 310GPa.|$|E

[...] Also, {{there are very few}} glues available specifically for gluing PP. However, solid PP objects not subject to undue flexing can be satisfactorily joined with a two part epoxy glue or using hot-glue guns. [...] Preparation is important and it is often helpful to roughen the surface with a file, emery paper or other <b>abrasive</b> <b>material</b> to provide better anchorage for the glue. [...] Also it is recommended to clean with mineral spirits or similar alcohol prior to gluing to remove any oils or other contamination. [...] Some experimentation may be required.

2500|$|Once Typhoons started {{operating}} from forward landing grounds in Normandy, {{it was found}} that the dust clouds stirred up by propeller wash consisted of over 80 percent of hard, <b>abrasive</b> <b>material</b> which was damaging the Sabre engines. The sleeve valves in particular were subject to excessive wear and it was calculated that engines would last for three take-offs. As a result, a [...] "dome deflector" [...] was designed and manufactured at great speed by Napier, and within a week most Typhoons had been fitted with it. In operational service these mushroom-shaped air filters, which became red hot, had a propensity for being blown off the air intake at high speed whenever a Sabre engine backfired. They were soon replaced by drum-shaped filters designed by the RAE and Vokes. These had [...] "cuckoo clock" [...] doors in front, which swung open with the pressure changes caused by engine backfires. This standardised filter became Typhoon Mod.420.|$|E
