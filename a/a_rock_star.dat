The family resides in an old milk carton in a suburban fly metropolis called Stickyfeet, which {{is located in a}} dump.

5|$|In {{the same}} year, Vogue did a spread called “Grunge & Glory” with fashion {{photographer}} Steven Miesel who shot supermodels Naomi Campbell and Kristen McMenamy in a savanna landscape wearing grunge-styled clothing. This shoot made McMenamy the face for grunge, {{as she had}} her eyebrows shaved and her hair cropped short. Designers like Christian Lacroix, Donna Karen and Karl Lagerfeld incorporated the grunge influence into their looks. In 1993, James Truman, editor of Details, said: “to me the thing about grunge is it’s not anti-fashion, it’s unfashion. Punk was anti-fashion. It made a statement. Grunge is about not making a statement, which is why it’s crazy for it to become a fashion statement.” The unkempt fashion sense defined {{the look of the}} “slacker generation”, who “skipped school, smoked pot... cigarettes and listened to music” hoping to become <b>a</b> <b>rock</b> <b>star</b> one day.|$|E
5|$|Veronica and Wallace (Percy Daggs III) watch a {{movie at}} her house. She {{questions}} him about Piz’s mood, while Keith enters and says he is currently unopposed in the Sheriff election. Piz runs up to Veronica and states {{that he has been}} chosen to be a guide for <b>a</b> <b>rock</b> <b>star</b> named Desmond Fellows. However, his show depends on some tapes Desmond is carrying with him, but when Piz checks him into his hotel room, they are missing. Piz calls Veronica for the case and runs into Logan in the elevator. Desmond points to several potential suspects. Logan asks Mac for study help, and he agrees. Piz starts his show with Desmond, and it goes terribly, as Desmond makes racial epithets and sexual advances. Veronica and Piz track down a teacher, who denies involvement, but the pair find a flyer for a group that threatened to boycott Desmond’s show. Piz and Desmond talk about his past and start to make progress, but he ends up going to a party with Dick (Ryan Hansen) instead of playing guitar with Piz.|$|E
5|$|When Néstor Kirchner {{refused to}} run for {{re-election}} in 2007 and proposed Cristina Kirchner instead, it was rumored that the couple might attempt {{to run for}} the presidency in alternate elections, to circumvent the constitutional limit of a single re-election. The death of Néstor Kirchner in 2010 derailed such a plan. She had a low positive image, below 30%. On 21 June 2011, Cristina Kirchner announced she would run for a second term as president. A few days later, she announced that her economic minister Amado Boudou would run for vice-president on her ticket. This selection was an unexpected one, as Boudou usually acted like <b>a</b> <b>rock</b> <b>star</b> instead of a politician. She personally chose most of the candidates for deputy in the Congress, favoring members of the Cámpora.|$|E

500|$|Fans ask me all {{the time}} {{what it is like to}} be <b>a</b> <b>rock</b> <b>star.</b> I can tell that they are dreaming, as I dreamed, when I was a kid, of someday ruling the world with a rock band. I tell them the same thing I would tell any young rock-star-to-be [...] you will get lonely. You will meet two hundred people every night, but each {{conversation}} will generally last approximately thirty seconds, and consist of you trying to convince them that no, you do not want their underwear. Then you will be alone again, in your motel room. Or you will be on your bus, in your little space, trying to kill the nine hours it takes to get to the next city, whichever city it is. This is the life of <b>a</b> <b>rock</b> <b>star.</b>|$|E

500|$|The Wall is a rock opera that explores {{abandonment}} and isolation, symbolised by {{a metaphorical}} wall. The songs create an approximate storyline {{of events in}} the life of the protagonist, Pink, a character based on Syd Barrett as well as Roger Waters, whose father was killed during the Second World War. Pink is oppressed by his overprotective mother, and tormented at school by tyrannical, abusive teachers. All of these traumas become metaphorical [...] "bricks in the wall". The protagonist eventually becomes <b>a</b> <b>rock</b> <b>star,</b> his relationships marred by infidelity, drug use, and outbursts of violence. As his marriage crumbles, he finishes building his wall, completing his isolation from human contact.|$|E
