The red line and associated field vectors represent how the magnitude {{and direction of the}} electric field varies along the direction of travel. For this plane electromagnetic wave, each vector represents the magnitude and direction of the electric field for an entire plane that is perpendicular to the direction of travel.

25|$|So at this moment, I begin my {{tenure in}} this Chamber, {{uncertain}} of what history will say of my tenure here. I come here green {{with only a}} desire to make our great country even greater. We have much work to do. In that spirit, I pledge to each of you that any disagreements we may have are just that and no more. Walking in each other's shoes takes effort and pause; however, it is my sincere hope that I never lose the patience to view each of you as human beings first, God's creatures, and foremost. I deeply <b>appreciate</b> <b>this</b> opportunity to serve with each of you. I very much look forward to getting to know you better.|$|E
25|$|Subtitle {{translation}} can {{be different}} from the translation of written text. Usually, during the process of creating subtitles for a film or television program, the picture and each sentence of the audio are analyzed by the subtitle translator; also, the subtitle translator {{may or may not have}} access to a written transcript of the dialog. Especially in the field of commercial subtitles, the subtitle translator often interprets what is meant, rather than translating the manner in which the dialog is stated; that is, the meaning is more important than the form—the audience does not always <b>appreciate</b> <b>this,</b> as it can be frustrating for people who are familiar with some of the spoken language; spoken language may contain verbal padding or culturally implied meanings that cannot be conveyed in the written subtitles. Also, the subtitle translator may also condense the dialog to achieve an acceptable reading speed, whereby purpose is more important than form.|$|E

25|$|On {{the right}} is an {{illustration}} of the electric field vectors of a circularly polarized electromagnetic wave. The electric field vectors have a constant magnitude but their direction changes in a rotary manner. Given {{that this is a}} plane wave, each vector represents the magnitude and direction of the electric field for an entire plane that is perpendicular to the axis. Specifically, given that this is a circularly polarized plane wave, these vectors indicate that the electric field, from plane to plane, has a constant strength while its direction steadily rotates. Refer to these two images in the plane wave article to better <b>appreciate</b> <b>this.</b> This light is considered to be right-hand, clockwise circularly polarized if viewed by the receiver. Since this is an electromagnetic wave each electric field vector has a corresponding, but not illustrated, magnetic field vector that is at a right angle to the electric field vector and proportional in magnitude to it. As a result, the magnetic field vectors would trace out a second helix if displayed.|$|E

500|$|The single's {{reception}} {{was generally}} positive. It reached number 35 on the UK Singles Chart. It also reached number 26 at the US Billboard Hot Modern Rock Tracks. The song remains, to this day, an audience favorite in live performances. It {{has earned the}} band praise from critics. Adrian Denning, in his review of the album, wrote, [...] "'Shiver' has a vocal that could be Jeff Buckley influenced, the soaring vocals are a joy over a reasonably guitar rock based instrumental track." [...] A review by David DeVoe in Hybridmagazine.com reads, [...] "'Shiver' is a delightfully laid back tune, full of that great guitar sound that I have come to <b>appreciate</b> <b>this</b> band for." [...] Spencer Owen of Pitchfork noted, [...] "It's the only truly decent song on Parachutes, but simultaneously, it's {{the only one that}} blatantly shows its influences. In fact, the influence can even be pinned to a single song: Jeff Buckley's 'Grace.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Cisneros {{breaks the}} {{boundary}} between what is a socially acceptable way for women to act and speak and what is not, using language and imagery that have a [...] "boisterous humor" [...] and [...] "extrovert energy" [...] and are even at times [...] "deliberately shocking". Not all readers <b>appreciate</b> <b>this</b> [...] "shocking" [...] quality of some of Cisneros’s work. Both female and male readers have criticized Cisneros for the ways she celebrates her sexuality, such as the suggestive photograph of herself on the My Wicked, Wicked Ways cover (3rd Woman Press, 1987). Cisneros says of this photo: [...] "The cover is of a woman appropriating her own sexuality. In some ways, that’s also why it’s wicked: the scene is trespassing that boundary by saying 'I defy you. I'm going to tell my own story.'" [...] Some readers [...] "failed to perceive the transgressive meaning of the gesture", thinking that she was merely being lewd for shock value, and questioned her legitimacy as a feminist. Cisneros’s initial response to this was dismay, but then she reports thinking [...] "Wait a second, where’s your sense of humor? And why can’t a feminist be sexy?" ...|$|E

Written and directed by Vishal Bharadwaj, Kaminey requires patience and attention but the pay off is more than worth it." [...] Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama rated the film 4 out of 5 and wrote [...] "Kaminey is bold, stark, funny and unpredictable and is a film with an attitude.

[...] The review also said, [...] "Kaminey is an engrossing flick that does not let you move from your seat!" [...] Kaveree Bamzai of India Today rated the film 4 out of 5 and said it [...] "is dark, melodramatic, poetic and ultimately operatic". He also said, [...] "Its lyrics are the blow-up-your-brains-out kind...and its music, composed by the multi-talented Bharadwaj is perfectly in sync with a narrative that doesn't pause for breath." [...] Namrata Joshi from Outlook gave {{a rating of}} 4 out 5 and called Kaminey [...] "a strikingly anarchic, unusually energetic, quirky and frenetic film". Sudhish Kamath of The Hindu gave the film 4 stars and wrote, [...] "Kaminey takes the post-postmodern noir genre to a whole new level, to a sophistication the Indian audience isn't used to. Watch it at least twice to fully <b>appreciate</b> <b>this</b> masterpiece."
