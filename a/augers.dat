S.C.A.T. {{was able to}} place agent Kelli Medd (Dana Plato) within the group as an {{undercover}} agent. The girls {{are not aware of}} her true identity. Also with the girls is Danny, Lisa's younger brother. What the gang does not know is the house is infested with <b>Augers,</b> vampiric beings that need blood to survive. The Martin family themselves {{are in the process of}} becoming vampires. The following events that take place and the ending vary widely depending on which characters the player is able to save from the <b>Augers.</b>|$|E
5|$|Allen soon {{resumed his}} place in the auger factory in Connecticut, where he {{remained}} until September 1, 1843, when he moved to Troy, New York. There he entered into partnership with O. W. Edson in manufacturing <b>augers.</b> The partnership continued until the following January when Allen purchased his partner’s share and continued in this business until the factory burned down in 1850.|$|E
5|$|After {{the path}} was {{finalized}} came the <b>augers</b> and drillers for the holes {{that served as}} foundations for the Vertical Support Members that held up the pipe. These holes were drilled and filled {{with a mix of}} water, gravel and dirt before a VSM was dropped into each hole. Because of the frozen ground, the gravel and dirt froze as hard as concrete, sealing the VSMs in place. The VSMs were laid in parallel, two at a time, and each had a semicircular rest for the pipeline segments. These were carried in 40-foot or 80-foot segments by crane or sideboom to the appropriate location, lowered into place, then welded together. The welds were then inspected via X-ray by quality control engineers who followed the welders.|$|E
30|$|The {{press is}} where the oil (and water) is {{extracted}} from the cake. Recall that the statistical analysis had shown that high PRESS PRESSURE and low <b>AUGER</b> SPEED were the best operating characteristics. The importance of high PRESS PRESSURE is entirely plausible, but the requirement for low <b>AUGER</b> SPEED is not so intuitive, and could not at first be explained by operators. The <b>AUGER</b> SPEED variable partly measures the rate of transfer of material from the cooker to the press.|$|R

5|$|Allen {{returned}} to Brunswick {{after the war}} and reopened the Planters' Hoe Company in association with George T. Lane. He ended the production of <b>augers,</b> which still made up a small percentage of production even after closing Millville Manufacturing. Allen put himself in charge of manufacturing and sales and he again secured a solid market share in the South. A prosperous trade resumed and was still strong at least until the 1880s. The company eventually expanded and began manufacturing lighter common hoes for the general public, adding to its heavy southern-style line of hoes. The Planters' Hoe Company was still a success as late as the 1890s, but it was extinct by the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|In January 1851, Allen {{purchased}} the Eagle flour mills, an historically important industrial {{building in the}} area, which eventually gave the hamlet of Eagle Mills its name. The factory {{had a long history}} of failed business attempts. It was built in 1821 by Daniel Sheldon to mill flour using wheat supplied from Troy. After brief success, the business closed and the building sat idle. It was sold to James Bumstead who reopened the building as a feed mill. He too had troubles and sold the building to James McChesney, who kept the building idle for some time before transferring the property to Catlin and Saxton, who began the manufacture of <b>augers</b> and bits. Also unsuccessful, Catlin and Saxton abandoned the business and James McChesney (whose name was still on the deed) sold the property to Groome and Shattuck, who began manufacturing monkey wrenches. This too failed and the property was sold to Paul Smith, a miller from nearby Cropseyville, who sold the property to Allen in 1851 because Smith later decided that he preferred to keep his mills consolidated in Cropseyville.|$|E
5|$|On December 9, 1993, a United States Senate {{committee}} held {{a hearing}} on the subject of video game violence. The hearing was led by senators Joe Lieberman and Herb Kohl and was covered in major newspapers including USA Today, The Washington Post and The New York Times. Throughout the hearing, the committee scrutinized Night Trap along with Midway's Mortal Kombat (1992). Lieberman, who admitted never playing the game, claimed Night Trap featured gratuitous violence and promoted sexual aggression against women. One game over scene considered particularly offensive involved the nightgown-clad character Lisa being captured by <b>Augers</b> attempting to drain her blood. Tom Zito attempted to explain the context of the nightgown scene in defense of the game, but he claims he was silenced. In the short documentary Dangerous Games (included with PC versions), the producers and some members of the cast explain that the plot of the game was to in fact prevent the trapping and killing of women. In addition, the blood draining device was intended to look very unrealistic to mitigate the violence. Despite scenes in which the girls are grabbed or pulled by enemies, no nudity or extreme acts of violence were ever filmed or incorporated into the game.|$|E

Forstner bits can cut {{on the edge of a}} block of wood, and can cut overlapping holes. Because of the flat bottom to the hole, they are useful for drilling through veneer already glued to add an inlay. Forstner bits were invented and patented by Benjamin Forstner in 1874.|$|E
25|$|The {{simplest}} {{survey technique}} is surface survey. It involves combing an area, usually on foot but sometimes {{with the use}} of mechanized transport, to search for features or artifacts visible on the surface. Surface survey cannot detect sites or features that are completely buried under earth, or overgrown with vegetation. Surface survey may also include mini-excavation techniques such as <b>augers,</b> corers, and shovel test pits. If no materials are found, the area surveyed is deemed sterile.|$|E
25|$|The bush {{carpenter}} historically possessed few tools, {{and rarely}} any specialized tools. Mann's Emigrant's Guide of 1849 suggests that those heading for Australia's unsettled areas take {{with them a}} plentiful supply {{of a wide variety}} of tools and fasteners, but he lists as the very minimum, 'A hand saw; Axe; Adze; Mortising chisel; Two <b>augers,</b> 1 and 11/4 inch; Two maul rings; Set of wedges; 1 Spade; Pick-axe; Two-foot rule; Chalk line; Square; A Plumb Bob.' A majority of early settlers had formerly been manual labourers, or servicemen, and brought with them a sound practical ability and aptitude for 'making do'; others observed or helped and copied their techniques.|$|E

Oats can be safely stored at 12-14% moisture; at higher moisture levels, they must be aerated or dried.|$|R

25|$|Early grain {{elevators}} and bins {{were often}} built of framed or cribbed wood, and were prone to fire. Grain-elevator bins, tanks, and silos are now usually {{made of steel}} or reinforced concrete. Bucket elevators are used to lift grain to a distributor or consignor, from which it falls through s and/or conveyors and into one or more bins, silos, or tanks in a facility. When desired, silos, bins, and tanks are emptied by gravity flow, sweep <b>augers,</b> and conveyors. As grain is emptied from bins, tanks, and silos it is conveyed, blended, and weighted into trucks, railroad cars, or barges, and shipped to grain wholesalers, exporters, and/or local end-users, such as flour mills, breweries, and ethanol and alcohol distilleries.|$|E
25|$|Helical {{symmetry}} is {{the kind}} of symmetry seen in such everyday objects as springs, Slinky toys, drill bits, and <b>augers.</b> The concept of helical symmetry can be visualized as the tracing in three-dimensional space that results from rotating an object at a constant angular speed while simultaneously translating at a constant linear speed along its axis of rotation. At any one point in time, these two motions combine to give a coiling angle that helps define the properties of the traced helix. When the tracing object rotates quickly and translates slowly, the coiling angle will be close to 0°. Conversely, if the rotation is slow and the translation is speedy, the coiling angle will approach 90°.|$|E
25|$|Infinite helical symmetry: If {{there are}} no {{distinguishing}} features {{along the length of}} a helix or helix-like object, the object will have infinite symmetry much like that of a circle, but with the additional requirement of translation along the long axis of the object to return it to its original appearance. A helix-like object is one that has at every point the regular angle of coiling of a helix, but which can also have a cross section of indefinitely high complexity, provided only that precisely the same cross section exists (usually after a rotation) at every point {{along the length of the}} object. Simple examples include evenly coiled springs, slinkies, drill bits, and <b>augers.</b> Stated more precisely, an object has infinite helical symmetries if for any small rotation of the object around its central axis there exists a point nearby (the translation distance) on that axis at which the object will appear exactly as it did before. It is this infinite helical symmetry that gives rise to the curious illusion of movement along the length of an auger or screw bit that is being rotated. It also provides the mechanically useful ability of such devices to move materials along their length, provided that they are combined with a force such as gravity or friction that allows the materials to resist simply rotating along with the drill or auger.|$|E

Nonetheless, {{to the extent to}} which it accurately represents the plant behaviour, it predicts that low FAT is more readily obtained with high PRESS PRESSURE and low <b>AUGER</b> SPEED. It is understandable that high PRESS PRESSURE should squeeze out more oil, hence low FAT. However, the mechanics whereby low <b>AUGER</b> SPEED could be causally connected to low FAT is non-intuitive, and we return to this later.|$|R
40|$|Four 460 -mm {{diameter}} <b>augered</b> cast-in-place piles {{were tested}} in static axial compression for two high-rise residential projects in Houston, Texas. Pile capacities were evaluated from the interpreted failure load determined from the load-displacement curve for each load test based on Davisson offset criteria. Test specific α values were calculated based on the analysis of side resistance data. Based {{on the results of}} load tests, higher α values were used in the design to calculate side resistance for the production piles. The load tests provided useful information on the load transfer behavior of soils present in Texas Gulf Coast, and confidence in the design and construction of <b>augered</b> cast-in-place piles. The <b>augered</b> cast-in-place piles proved to be more economical than other deep foundation systems commonly used in the Texas Gulf Coast soils...|$|R
25|$|Highwall mining {{is another}} form of surface mining that evolved from auger mining. In Highwall mining, the coal seam is {{penetrated}} by a continuous miner propelled by a hydraulic Pushbeam Transfer Mechanism (PTM). A typical cycle includes sumping (launch-pushing forward) and shearing (raising and lowering the cutterhead boom to cut the entire height of the coal seam). As the coal recovery cycle continues, the cutterhead is progressively launched into the coal seam for 19.72 feet (6.01 m). Then, the Pushbeam Transfer Mechanism (PTM) automatically inserts a 19.72-foot (6.01 m) long rectangular Pushbeam (Screw-Conveyor Segment) into the center section of the machine between the Powerhead and the cutterhead. The Pushbeam system can penetrate nearly 1,000 feet (300 m) into the coal seam. One patented Highwall mining system uses <b>augers</b> enclosed inside the Pushbeam that prevent the mined coal from being contaminated by rock debris during the conveyance process. Using a video imaging and/or a gamma ray sensor and/or other Geo-Radar systems like a coal-rock interface detection sensor (CID), the operator can see ahead projection of the seam-rock interface and guide the continuous miner's progress. Highwall mining can produce {{thousands of tons of}} coal in contour-strip operations with narrow benches, previously mined areas, trench mine applications and steep-dip seams with controlled water-inflow pump system and/or a gas (inert) venting system.|$|E
500|$|Ice cores are {{collected}} by cutting around a cylinder {{of ice in}} a way that enables it to be brought to the surface. [...] Early cores were often collected with hand <b>augers</b> and they are still used for short holes. A design for ice core <b>augers</b> was patented in 1932 and they have changed little since. [...] An auger is essentially a cylinder with helical metal ribs (known as flights) wrapped around the outside, {{at the lower end of}} which are cutting blades. [...] Hand <b>augers</b> can be rotated by a T handle or a brace handle, and some can be attached to handheld electric drills to power the rotation. [...] With the aid of a tripod for lowering and raising the auger, cores up to 50m deep can be retrieved, but the practical limit is about 30m for engine-powered <b>augers,</b> and less for hand <b>augers.</b> [...] Below this depth, electromechanical or thermal drills are used.|$|E
500|$|An ice core is a {{core sample}} that is {{typically}} removed from an ice sheet or a high mountain glacier. [...] Since the ice forms from the incremental buildup of annual layers of snow, lower layers {{are older than}} upper, and an ice core contains ice formed over a range of years. [...] Cores are drilled with hand <b>augers</b> (for shallow holes) or powered drills; they can reach depths of over two miles (3.2 km), and contain ice up to 800,000 years old.|$|E

40|$|Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECR) map at 60 EeV {{have been}} found {{recently}} by <b>AUGER</b> group spreading anisotropy signatures in the sky. The result have been interpreted {{as a manifestation of}} AGN sources ejecting protons at GZK edges mostly from Super-galactic Plane. The result is surprising due to the absence of much nearer Virgo cluster. Moreover, early GZK cut off in the spectra may be better reconcile with light nuclei (than with protons). In addition a large group (nearly a dozen) of events cluster suspiciously along Cen-A. Finally, proton UHECR composition nature is in sharp disagreement with earlier <b>AUGER</b> claim of a heavy nuclei dominance at 40 EeV. Therefore we interpret here the signals as mostly UHECR light nuclei (He, Be, B, C, O), very possibly mostly the lightest (He,Be) ones, ejected from nearest AGN Cen-A, UHECR smeared by galactic magnetic fields, whose random vertical bending is overlapping with super-galactic arm. The eventual <b>AUGER</b> misunderstanding took place because of such a rare coincidence between the Super Galactic Plane (arm) and the smeared (randomized) signals from Cen-A, bent orthogonally to the Galactic fields. Our derivation verify the consistence of the random smearing angles for He, Be and B, C, O, in reasonable agreement with the <b>AUGER</b> main group events around Cen-A. Only few other rare events are spread elsewhere. The most collimated from Cen-A are the lightest. The most spread the heavier. Consequently Cen-A is the best candidate UHE neutrino tau observable by HEAT and AMIGA as enhanced <b>AUGER</b> array at tens-hundred PeV energy. This model maybe soon tested by new events clustering around the Cen-A and by composition imprint study. Comment: 4 pages, 5 figures...|$|R

The ice showed signs of having extensively melted in the past, was about 3 metres thick and covering smooth rock which extended Northwards to become the harbour bottom.

500|$|Ready {{to begin}} work on a full game, the NEMO team {{returned}} {{to the idea of}} surveillance cameras, but wanted to make a more interactive and engaging experience. Zito originally had a plan for an interactive movie was based on the A Nightmare on Elm Street film series. After negotiations with the film studio fell through, Zito hired Terry McDonell to write an original script. A cross-functional team of writers, directors, game designers, and programmers discussed how to blend the art of film with the interactivity of video games to create a compelling interactive narrative. The initial idea was to take the basis of Scene of the Crime to an extreme with a billionaire leaving an extremely large sum of money alone in a large house, guarded by a state-of-the-art security system. In this concept, the billionaire's daughter is staying at the house with her teenage friends when the house is attacked by ninja burglars who are attempting to steal the money. Through much deliberation, the game evolved into the final vampire concept seen in Night Trap. Hasbro was concerned that the game may feature [...] "reproducible violence". As a result, Hasbro did not want the vampires, later dubbed <b>Augers,</b> to bite or move too quickly. In addition, the device used by the <b>Augers</b> to drain blood from their victims was purposely designed to pass Hasbro's non-reproducible violence requirements.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} stages of European {{colonization}} in northeastern North America, local Indigenous peoples showed the arriving colonists how to tap the trunks of certain types of maples during the spring thaw to harvest the sap. André Thevet, the [...] "Royal Cosmographer of France", wrote about Jacques Cartier drinking maple sap during his Canadian voyages. By 1680, European settlers and fur traders were involved in harvesting maple products. However, rather than making incisions in the bark, the Europeans used the method of drilling tapholes in the trunks with <b>augers.</b> During the 17th and 18th centuries, processed maple sap was used primarily as a source of concentrated sugar, in both liquid and crystallized-solid form, as cane sugar had to be imported from the West Indies.|$|E
40|$|Earliest 2007 UHECR {{anisotropy}} {{findings and}} ICRC <b>AUGER</b> updated maps and clustering confirms {{our understanding of}} CenA as the main nearby UHECR source. Those events are mostly lightest nuclei, as He. The events are spread by galactic fields. We argue that the main UHECR event bending, along CenA, is spreading vertically (respect to horizontal spiral galactic fields) by random (and a final coherent) Lorentz force. The He-nuclei dominance is also well probed by detailed <b>AUGER</b> composition data. The Lightest nuclei are still compatible with most recent Hires composition results. Such lightest UHECR nuclei are fragile and opaque even to nearest Universe. Offering a very narrow local (ten Mpc) view. This opacity explain the otherwise puzzling Virgo persistent absence. The He photo-disruption in flight should lead to halves energy tail clustering (along the same CenA group), events made by deuterium, He 3 and protons (or unstable neutrons). This tail anisotropy should be revaled. The consequent foreseen UHE neutrino by UHECR Lightest nuclei dissociation, at tens-a hundred PeV, may rise soon in <b>AUGER</b> and TA telescopes. Such neutrino signal are quite inclined upward fluorescent Tau air-showers at nearest (2 - 4 km) horizons, at middle-low telescope view zenith angles. Their air-showers will be opening and extending in widest azimuth angle and fastest angular velocity spread. Contrary to far EeV tau expected by popular GZK neutrinos. Even hard to observe these Tau Air-showers at tens and hundred PeVs may soon shine (in a peculiar way) at near telescope views and within a short (years) time, both in <b>AUGER,</b> HEAT and TA sky.
