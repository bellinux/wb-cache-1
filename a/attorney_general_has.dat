25|$|The Attorney General of Indonesia is {{responsible}} to advise the Government about law problems as well as execute Supreme Court's order. The office of <b>Attorney</b> <b>General</b> <b>has</b> the ranking and power on par with another ministries or departments in cabinet. The office {{is not part of}} Justice Department in cabinet, the cabinet has its own Law and Human Rights Department that focuses on more technical and regulation making rather than executing Supreme Court's order. The Attorney General is also a Solicitor General. So, the Attorney General can represent the Government in the Supreme Court. The <b>Attorney</b> <b>General</b> <b>has</b> the power to indict and prosecute outlaws and law breakers. The current Attorney General of Indonesia of Indonesia is HM Prasetyo, who assumed office since 2014.|$|E

40|$|Some {{prosecutors}} and <b>attorneys</b> <b>general</b> <b>have</b> lent {{the authority of}} their offices to others {{through the use of}} their letterhead, most often to debt collectors. In a similar and no less disturbing misuse of office, some <b>attorneys</b> <b>general</b> <b>have</b> sent letters on official letterhead substantially written by lobbyists or lawyers for corporations that have made campaign contributions to the <b>attorney</b> <b>general.</b> This ethics column explores the ethics of such practices...|$|R

25|$|The Office of the Missouri Attorney General {{was created}} in 1806 when Missouri {{was part of the}} Louisiana Territory. Missouri's first Constitution in 1820 {{provided}} for an appointed Attorney General, but since the 1865 Constitution, the <b>Attorney</b> <b>General</b> <b>has</b> been elected. To date there have been 42 attorneys general in Missouri.|$|E

40|$|Much as Justice Louis Brandeis {{imagined}} {{states as}} laboratories of the law, offices of state <b>attorneys</b> <b>general</b> <b>have</b> been laboratories of privacy enforcement. State <b>attorneys</b> <b>general</b> <b>have</b> been nimble privacy enforcers whereas federal {{agencies have been}} more constrained by politics. Local knowledge, specialization, multistate coordination, and broad legal authority have allowed AG offices to fill in gaps in the law. State <b>attorneys</b> <b>general</b> <b>have</b> established baseline fair-information protections and expanded the frontiers of privacy law to cover sexual intimacy and youth. Their efforts have reinforced and strengthened federal norms, further harmonizing certain aspects of privacy and data security policy. Although certain systemic practices enhance AG privacy policymaking, others blunt its impact, including an overreliance on weak informal agreements and a reluctance to issue closing letters identifying data practices that comply with the law. This Article offers ways state <b>attorneys</b> <b>general</b> can function more effectively through informal and formal proceedings. It addresses concerns about the potential pile-up of enforcement activity, federal preemption, capture, and the dormant Commerce Clause. It urges state enforcers to act more boldly {{in the face of}} certain shadowy data practices...|$|R
25|$|Under the Missouri Antitrust Law, the <b>attorney</b> <b>general</b> <b>has</b> the {{authority}} to represent the state or any of its political subdivisions, public agencies, school districts or municipalities in actions to prohibit monopolies and trade restraints. The attorney general also may act under federal antitrust statutes to bring civil actions {{in the name of}} the state and on behalf of Missouri residents to recover damages for injuries caused by certain antitrust violations.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Attorney</b> <b>General</b> <b>has</b> {{supervisory}} powers over {{the prosecution of}} criminal offences, but is not personally involved with prosecutions; however, some prosecutions (e.g. Riot) cannot be commenced without their consent, {{and they have the}} power to halt prosecutions generally. Criminal prosecutions are the responsibility of the Crown Prosecution Service, headed by the Director of Public Prosecutions. The Attorney General may appeal cases to the higher courts where, although the particular case is settled, there may be a point of law of public importance at issue.|$|E
25|$|In 1890 {{the ability}} of an Attorney General to {{continue}} practising privately was formally taken away, turning the office-holder into a dedicated representative of the government. Since {{the beginning of the}} twentieth century the role of the <b>Attorney</b> <b>General</b> <b>has</b> moved away from representing the Crown and government directly in court, and it has become more of a political and ministerial post, with the Attorney General serving as a legal adviser to both the government as a whole and individual government departments. Despite this change, until the passing of the Homicide Act 1957 the Attorney General was bound to prosecute any and all poisoning cases.|$|E
50|$|Several state <b>attorneys</b> <b>general</b> <b>have</b> begun {{investigating}} these practices, {{which may}} violate fair lending laws. The NAACP filed a class-action lawsuit charging systematic racial discrimination {{by more than}} a dozen banks.|$|R

25|$|As Attorney General, Spitzer {{stepped up}} {{the profile of}} the office. Traditionally, state {{attorneys}} general have pursued consumer rights cases, concentrating on local fraud while deferring national issues to the federal government. Breaking with this traditional deference, Spitzer took up civil actions and criminal prosecutions relating to corporate white-collar crime, securities fraud, Internet fraud, and environmental protection. The New York Attorney General's office has Wall Street (and thus many leading corporate and financial institutions) within its jurisdiction. Also, the New York Attorney General wields greater than usual powers of investigation and prosecution of corporations under New York State's General Business Law. In particular, under the Martin Act of 1921, the New York <b>Attorney</b> <b>General</b> <b>has</b> the power to subpoena witnesses and company documents pertaining to investigations of fraud or illegal activity by a corporation. Spitzer used this statute to allow his office to prosecute cases which have been described as within federal jurisdiction. Spitzer used this authority in his civil actions against corporations and criminal prosecutions against their officers. It proved useful in the wake of several U.S. corporate scandals that began with the collapse of Enron in 2001. Several of these corporations, as well as the brokerage houses that sold their stock, were accused of having inflated stock values by unethical means throughout the 1990s. When inquiries into these allegations by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Congress failed, Spitzer's office used its subpoena power to obtain corporate documents, building cases against the firms both in courtrooms and in public opinion.|$|E
500|$|Federal {{observers}} are tasked with observing poll worker and voter conduct at polling places during an election and observing election officials tabulate the ballots. The {{goal of the}} federal observer provision is to facilitate minority voter participation by deterring and documenting instances of discriminatory conduct in the election process, such as election officials denying qualified minority persons the right to cast a ballot, intimidation or harassment of voters on election day, or improper vote counting. Discriminatory conduct that federal observers document may also serve as evidence in subsequent enforcement lawsuits. Since 1965, the <b>Attorney</b> <b>General</b> <b>has</b> certified 153 local governments across 11 states, but given time and resource constraints, federal {{observers are}} not assigned to every certified jurisdiction for every election. Separate provisions allow for a certified jurisdiction to [...] "bail out" [...] of its certification.|$|E
500|$|Jurisdictions {{may seek}} preclearance through either an [...] "administrative preclearance" [...] process or a [...] "judicial preclearance" [...] process. If a {{jurisdiction}} seeks administrative preclearance, the Attorney General will consider whether the proposed change has a discriminatory purpose or effect. After the jurisdiction submits the proposed change, the <b>Attorney</b> <b>General</b> <b>has</b> 60 days to interpose an objection to it. The 60-day period may be extended an additional 60 days if the jurisdiction later submits additional information. If the Attorney General interposes an objection, then {{the change is}} not precleared {{and may not be}} implemented. The Attorney General's decision is not subject to judicial review, but if the Attorney General interposes an objection, the jurisdiction may independently seek judicial preclearance, and the court may disregard the Attorney General's objection at its discretion. If a jurisdiction seeks judicial preclearance, it must file a declaratory judgment action against the Attorney General in the U.S. District Court for D.C. A three-judge panel will consider whether the voting change has a discriminatory purpose or effect, and the losing party may appeal directly to the Supreme Court. Private parties may intervene in judicial preclearance lawsuits.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>attorney</b> <b>general</b> <b>has</b> the {{responsibility}} of protecting the public's interests in an open and honest marketplace. The Consumer Protection Division enforces Missouri's Consumer Protection Act and antitrust laws, and has {{the responsibility}} of representing the commissioner of securities {{of the secretary of}} state's office. Missouri's consumer protection statutes prohibit deception, fraud, unfair practices and misrepresentation or concealment of material facts in the sale or advertisement of goods or services. These laws authorize the attorney general to take action against such fraud and ensure that consumers' rights are protected.|$|E

[...] A statement by {{the directors of the}} American Association for the Advancement of Science said that [...] "scientists should not be subjected to fraud investigations simply for providing scientific results that may be controversial or inconvenient" [...] and that investigations such as those Cuccinelli has initiated against Mann [...] "could have a long-lasting and chilling effect on a broad spectrum of research fields that are critical to a range of national interests from public health to national security to the environment." ...|$|E
