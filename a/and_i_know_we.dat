6000|$|... "We can't eat {{half that}} luncheon, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>we</b> shall not need so many wraps. I wouldn't lumber the boat up so," [...] said Rose, who still had secret scares when on the water.|$|E
60|$|Near at hand {{were four}} rifles, {{where they had}} been left against a sapling while their owners took part in the dance of death, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> might add the prisoners, well armed, to our force.|$|R

6000|$|... "They won't {{have time}} to try that game more than once again before we'll be well out of their way," [...] I heard Darius say, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> had {{sufficient}} speed to render useless the work of towing, otherwise the two sailors would not have come aboard.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't come {{on these}} nights," [...] Frona whispered to Corliss at parting. [...] "We haven't spoken three words, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>we</b> shall be good friends. Did Dave Harney succeed in getting any sugar out of you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We needn't {{train with}} 'em. There {{will be at}} least a dozen white men with the crowd and we can go with them. I once met General Johnson. He's a big-hearted Irishman, full of hard, common sense, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>we</b> could get along with him. And when he heard our story he might put himself out to help us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Indeed, you {{are best}} away,” said my lady, laughing, {{as she put}} her hand on the boy’s head for a moment. “You shall stay in no such dull place. You shall go to college and {{distinguish}} yourself as becomes your name. That is how you shall please me best; and—and if my children want you, or I want you, you shall come to us; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>we</b> may count on you.” ...|$|E
60|$|The fellow whom Archie <b>and</b> <b>I</b> had {{stricken}} {{down was}} sprawled {{out on the}} floor upon his face, like one dead, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> had nothing to fear from him for some time to come, even if the life yet remained in his body, therefore I took a hand in the battle Hiram was waging so desperately.|$|R
5000|$|I'd {{written the}} lyric staying {{up all night}} at the Iroquois Hotel. I went down to Electric Lady <b>and</b> <b>I</b> just put the vocal down on tape, we {{finished}} about twenty to midnight. We took the E train from the Village up to Times Square.

Joe Strummer ...|$|R
60|$|HE [with quiet conviction] Your {{heart will}} tell you at the right time. I have thought deeply over this; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> what <b>we</b> two must do, sooner or later.|$|R
60|$|In our boyish want of {{discretion}} I dare say we took {{too much to}} drink, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>we</b> talked too much. We became particularly hot upon some boorish sneer of Drummle's, {{to the effect that}} we were too free with our money. It led to my remarking, with more zeal than discretion, that it came with a bad grace from him, to whom Startop had lent money in my presence but a week or so before.|$|E
6000|$|MAZZINI. Oh, we couldn't: {{we should}} ruin the {{business}} in a year. I've tried; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know.</b> <b>We</b> should spend too much on everything. We should {{improve the quality of}} the goods and make them too dear. We should be sentimental about the hard cases among the work people. But Mangan keeps us in order. He is down on us about every extra halfpenny. We could never do without him. You see, he will sit up all night thinking of how to save sixpence. Won't Ellie make him jump, though, when she takes his house in hand! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, I don't know," [...] said Adam; [...] "the squire's 'cute enough but {{it takes}} {{something}} else besides 'cuteness to make folks see what'll be their interest in the long run. It takes some conscience and belief in right and wrong, I see that pretty clear. You'd hardly ever bring round th' old squire to believe he'd gain as much in a straightfor'ard way as by tricks and turns. And, besides, I've not much mind to work under him: I don't want to quarrel with any gentleman, more particular an old gentleman turned eighty, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>we</b> couldn't agree long. If the captain was master o' th' estate, it 'ud be different: he's got a conscience and a will to do right, and I'd sooner work for him nor for any man living." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, it {{was found}} on you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have read it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> how <b>we</b> stand towards each other, and that perhaps you are my father; here is the letter." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Dan, I think Miss Pasmer is a {{beautiful}} girl, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>we</b> shall all like her, if you don't set us against her by your arrogance. Of course we don't know anything about her yet, and you don't, really; but she seems a very lovable little thing, and if she's rather silent and undemonstrative, why, she'll be all the better for you: you've got demonstration enough for twenty. And I think the family are well enough. Mrs. Pasmer is thoroughly harmless; and Mr. Pasmer is a most dignified personage; his eyebrows alone are {{worth the price of}} admission." [...] Dan could not help smiling. [...] "All that there is about it is, you mustn't expect to drive people into raptures about them, and expect them to go grovelling round on their knees because you do." ...|$|E
6000|$|Rebecca {{clasped her}} hands on her beating chest and looked round with dauntless eyes. [...] "Of his," [...] she said, [...] "who saved my life and your honor: of my dear, dear champion's. I never can be his, but I will be no other's. Give my money to my kinsmen; it is that they long for. Take the dross, Simeon and Solomon, Jonah and Jochanan, and divide it among you, and leave me. I will never be yours, I tell you, never. Do you think, after knowing him and hearing him speak,--after {{watching}} him wounded on his pillow, and glorious in battle" [...] (her eyes melted and kindled again as she spoke these words), [...] "I can mate with such as you? Go. Leave me to myself. I am none of yours. I love him--I love him. Fate divides us--long, long miles separate us; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>we</b> may never meet again. But I love and bless him always. Yes, always. My prayers are his; my faith is his. Yes, my faith is your faith, Wilfrid--Wilfrid! I have no kindred more,--I am a Christian!" ...|$|E
6000|$|We rattled through Scott's Bluffs Pass, by and by. It was along {{here somewhere}} that we first came across genuine and unmistakable alkali {{water in the}} road, and we cordially hailed it as a {{first-class}} curiosity, and a thing to be mentioned with eclat in letters to the ignorant at home. This water gave the road a soapy appearance, and in many places the ground {{looked as if it}} had been whitewashed. I think the strange alkali water excited us as much as any wonder we had come upon yet, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>we</b> felt very complacent and conceited, and better satisfied with life after we had added it to our list of things which we had seen and some other people had not. In a small way we were the same sort of simpletons as those who climb unnecessarily the perilous peaks of Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn, and derive no pleasure from it except the reflection that it isn't a common experience. But once in a while one of those parties trips and comes darting down the long mountain-crags in a sitting posture, making the crusted snow smoke behind him, flitting from bench to bench, and from terrace to terrace, jarring the earth where he strikes, and still glancing and flitting on again, sticking an iceberg into himself every now and then, and tearing his clothes, snatching at things to save himself, taking hold of trees and fetching them along with him, roots and all, starting little rocks now and then, then big boulders, then acres of ice and snow and patches of forest, gathering and still gathering as he goes, adding and still adding to his massed and sweeping grandeur as he nears a three thousand-foot precipice, till at last he waves his hat magnificently and rides into eternity on the back of a raging and tossing avalanche! ...|$|E
60|$|The cavalcade halted. Presently a fat eunuch {{glittering}} in his gold-wrought garments {{like some}} bronzed beetle in the sunlight, came waddling back towards me. He was odious <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>we</b> hated each other.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Now, sir,' {{said the}} little man, as he {{carefully}} closed the door, 'is there {{no way of}} accommodating this matter--step this way, sir, for a moment--into this window, Sir, where we can be alone--there, sir, there, pray sit down, sir. Now, my dear Sir, between you <b>and</b> <b>I,</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> very well, my dear Sir, that you have run off with this lady {{for the sake of}} her money. Don't frown, Sir, don't frown; I say, between you <b>and</b> <b>I,</b> <b>WE</b> <b>know</b> it. <b>We</b> are both men of the world, and <b>WE</b> <b>know</b> very well that our friends here, are not--eh?' ...|$|R
60|$|It was {{not much}} after the hour at which some people {{in that part of}} the country, when they have a reason for it, still believe that Sunday comes to an end, that the grocery boat left her pier with Captain Jabez, Abner, Walkirk, and me on board. There was nothing at all exhilarating in this expedition. I wanted to go rapidly, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> should go slowly. I had passed a dull day, waiting for the time to start, and, to avoid {{thinking}} of the slow progress we should make, I soon turned in.|$|R
60|$|Daylight {{showed us}} {{that between the}} stern of the skiff and {{destruction}} {{was no more than a}} score of feet. And how it did blow! There were times, in the gusts, when the wind must have approached a velocity of seventy or eighty miles an hour. But the anchors held, and so nobly that our final anxiety was that the for'ard bitts would be jerked clean out of the boat. All day the sloop alternately ducked her nose under and sat down on her stern; and it was not till late afternoon that the storm broke in one last and worst mad gust. For a full five minutes an absolute dead calm prevailed, and then, with the suddenness of a thunderclap, the wind snorted out of the southwest--a shift of eight points and a boisterous gale. Another night of it was too much for us, and we hove up by hand in a cross head-sea. It was not stiff work. It was heart-breaking. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>we</b> were both near to crying from the hurt and the exhaustion. And when we did get the first anchor up-and-down we couldn't break it out. Between seas we snubbed her nose down to it, took plenty of turns, and stood clear as she jumped. Almost everything smashed and parted except the anchor-hold. The chocks were jerked out, the rail torn off, and the very covering-board splintered, and still the anchor held. At last, hoisting the reefed mainsail and slacking off a few of the hard-won feet of the chain, we sailed the anchor out. It was nip and tuck, though, and there were times when the boat was knocked down flat. We repeated the manoeuvre with the remaining anchor, and in the gathering darkness fled into the shelter of the river's mouth.|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{very good}} of you, {{to take all}} this trouble, Mr. Ferris," [...] she said, giving him a {{friendly}} hand, [...] "and I suppose you are letting us encroach upon very valuable time. I'm quite ashamed to take it. But isn't it a heavenly day? What I call a perfect day, just right every way; none of those disagreeable extremes. It's so unpleasant to have it too hot, for instance. I'm the greatest person for moderation, Mr. Ferris, and I carry the principle into everything; but I do think the breakfasts at these Italian hotels are too light altogether. I like our American breakfasts, don't you? I've been telling Florida I can't stand it; we really must make some arrangement. To be sure, you oughtn't to think {{of such a thing}} as eating, in a place like Venice, all poetry; but a sound mind in a sound body, I say. We're perfectly wild over it. Don't you think it's a place that grows upon you very much, Mr. Ferris? All those associations,--it does seem too much; and the gondolas everywhere. But I'm always afraid the gondoliers cheat us; and in the stores I never feel safe a moment--not a moment. I do think the Venetians are lacking in truthfulness, a little. I don't believe they understand our American fairdealing and sincerity. I shouldn't want to do them injustice, but I really think they take advantages in bargaining. Now such a thing even as corals. Florida is extremely fond of them, and we bought a set yesterday in the Piazza, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>we</b> paid too much for them. Florida," [...] said Mrs. Vervain, for her daughter had reentered the room, and stood with some shawls and wraps upon her arm, patiently waiting for the conclusion of the elder lady's speech, [...] "I wish you would bring down that set of corals. I'd like Mr. Ferris to give an unbiased opinion. I'm sure we were cheated." ...|$|E
5000|$|Hurt dated Marlee Matlin for one year, {{and they}} cohabited for two years. In her 2009 {{autobiography}} I'll Scream Later, Matlin claimed that their relationship involved considerable {{drug abuse and}} physical abuse by Hurt. In response to the accusations aired on CNN on April 13, 2009, Hurt's agent declined to respond, but Hurt issued a statement the following day, which said: [...] "My own recollection is that we both apologized and both did {{a great deal to}} heal our lives. Of course, I did and do apologize for any pain I caused. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>we</b> have both grown. I wish Marlee and her family nothing but good." ...|$|E

5000|$|Fox's {{public image}} came under {{scrutiny}} when, on September 11, 2009, an unsigned letter from three crew members of Transformers defended Michael Bay against accusations made by Fox about his on-set behavior, including a comparison with Hitler.

Bay defended Fox, stating he does not condone the letter, and that while {{he also does not}} condone Fox's [...] "outlandish quotes", it is [...] "her crazy quips" [...] that [...] "are part of her crazy charm.
