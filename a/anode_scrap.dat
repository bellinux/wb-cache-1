40|$|The {{quality of}} carbon electrode-anode depends on {{characteristics}} of coke filler, {{coal tar pitch}} binder and <b>anode</b> <b>scrap,</b> which are the components of green anode mixture. Petroleum coke is a dominant component of anode, which finds application in the aluminium production. The interdependence of physical-chemical properties of the petroleum coke, coal tar pitch binder and <b>anode</b> <b>scrap</b> and their influence on the stability of anode are shown. The presence of insoluble substances in coal tar pitch exerts a strong influence upon the microstructure and other properties of carbon anode. The connection of the properties and microstructure of anode components and anode quality is discussed. Key words: petroleum coke, coal tar pitch, <b>anode</b> <b>scrap,</b> carbon anode 1...|$|E
40|$|The present {{technological}} {{cycle to}} produce secondary copper includes two main steps: a preliminary thermal refining to produce cast anodes having a copper content of about 99 %, followed by anode electrorefining to produce HSG copper. The new proposed process avoids the pyro-refining operation and produces anodes by cold compacting of granulated copper and copper alloy scrap. The direct electrorefining presents economical and environmental advantages due to furnace exclusion, {{but also to}} the possibility of using low-grade scrap. Once the electrorefining has been tested on a laboratory scale by using parameters similar to those used in traditional operations, the main critical aspects of the process have been analyzed. In particular technology of <b>anode</b> production, best <b>scrap</b> size, compacting parameters, anodic scrap residue and electrolyte purification process have been tested on a laboratory pilot plant...|$|R
40|$|Corrosion is {{process of}} {{degradation}} or destruction of material especially metal because of reaction with its environment. Corrosion represent as problem {{which is very}} harm full so that the corrosion rate must be prevented or controlled. One of the way is by using impressed current from external electric source or Impressed Current Cathodic Protection (ICCP). Metal which often used by is steel, and metal which is used in this research is steel of AISI 018. The purpose {{of this research is}} to know the effectiveness of current usage and anode usage at cathodic protection with impressed current. The method used is by giving current equal to 0, 14 mA and 0, 43 mA and also use different anode, that is with scrap steel and copper, plunged into solution of Nacl 3 % during 3, 6, and 9 day. And the result which is obtained from the corrosion rate of steel at solution of NaCl is 0, 1461 mm/yr. While the corrosion rate with cathodic protection using <b>scrap</b> steel <b>anode</b> at current 0, 43 mA and 0, 14 mA each of 0, 0198 mm/yr and 0, 0559 mm/yr. And at cathodic protection using <b>anode</b> of <b>scrap</b> steel and cooper at current 0, 43 mA and 0, 14 mA each of 0, 0180 mm/yr and 0, 0505 mm/yr. The advantage of this research is we know the effective of value of current and usage of anode so that can applied to controlled corrosion rate of metal structure...|$|R
40|$|The Bureau of Mines is {{conducting}} research to recover strategic and critical metals such as Ni, Co, and Cr from mixed contaminated super-alloy scrap. One approach being studied involves melt refining of superalloy <b>scrap</b> to produce <b>anodes</b> for electrolytic deposition of Ni-Co alloy. This melt refining of superalloy turnings is described based on melt-oxidation and oxidation-carburization experiments, using roasted superalloy grinding sludge {{to supply the}} 0 needed to oxidize Cr and other readily oxidized elements to the slag. Controlled melt-carburization subsequent to oxidation improved the metal phase recovery of Ni and Co to well over 90 pct and decreased electrolytic solubility of Cr, Mo, and W by carbide formation. Electrolytic refining experiments were conducted using a controlled-potential mode (preset cathode potential). Data show effects of Fe and Cr impurities, cation concentration, electrolyte pH, S 04 -Cl electrolyte ratio, temperature, cathode potential, and cation-selective membrane use on current efficiency, current density, and deposit composition. Disposition of Ni, Co, Cr, MO, W, and Fe is compared for melt-oxidized versus oxidized-plus-carburized anodes. Deposits containing > 97 pct Ni + Co (major impurity Fe) have been routinely obtained from <b>scrap</b> <b>anodes.</b> Research is continuing to improve deposit quality in sustained deposition and to recover Cr and other metals from refining slags and anode sludges...|$|R
40|$|Prior {{work at the}} Bureau of Mines {{resulted}} in the successful development of a bench-scale, combination electrorefining-electrowinning method for recycling the lead from scrap batteries using waste fluosilicic acid (H 2 SiF 6) as electrolyte. This paper describes larger scale experiments. <b>Anodes</b> cast from <b>scrap</b> battery lead were electrorefined in a 20 -L multielectrode cell for 3 to 7 days. The anodes, containing 2 to 2. 5 pct antimony, were ideal for obtaining firm and adherent slime blankets. Cathode deposits, assaying 99. 99 pct Pb, were obtained, with current efficiencies near 99 pct. Sludge leaching was done in 100 -L tanks followed by filtering in 61 cm square vacuum pan filtersu Lead of greater than 99. 99 -pct purity was recovered from the filtrate by electrowinning in a 20 -L multielectrode cell using insoluble Pb 02 -Ti (lead dioxide-coated titanium) anodes and pure lead cathodes. The fluo-silicic acid electrolyte depleted in lead was repeatedly recycled to leach more sludge, {{and there was no}} problem with impurity buildup. The amount of Pb 02 formed on the anodes during electrowinning was less than 1 pct of the total lead deposited on the cathodes, as long as the phosphorus concentration in the electrolyte was greater than 1. 3 giL. Emissions of lead in air were less than 10 ~g/m 3, well below the proposed OSHA limit of 50 ~g/m 3...|$|R
