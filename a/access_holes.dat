25|$|The most {{important}} precaution {{is to remove}} and reduce trash and rubbish from your property, such as woodpiles, boxes, plywood, tires, and trash cans—especially if they are stored {{right next to the}} house. With attached garages, block off house access by sealing cracks around doors and <b>access</b> <b>holes</b> for electrical conduits or plumbing. In the Midwest, some brown recluse bites occur when a sleeping person rolls over during the night, and the trapped spider bites. In the bedroom, move the bed away from the wall, remove any skirts or ruffles and remove all items stored under it. This minimizes chances that any spider can crawl onto the bed. Do not leave clothes and shoes on the floor, or shake them before dressing if they are left out. Apparel and equipment that is only occasionally worn should be stored in tightly closed plastic bags, especially if stored in the garage or other dark storage areas. Typically, pesticide control of spiders is difficult. There are various insecticides available in retail outlets labeled for spider control. However, spiders' perched legs allow them to walk over most pesticides, making the use of chemicals to eradicate the spiders impractical and unnecessarily toxic. A 2014 study indicates that fumigation may be more effective than previously believed. Sticky traps placed along floor boards offer a non-insecticidal way to trap spiders as well as provide an idea of population levels in the structure.|$|E

2500|$|The {{ship was}} {{prepared}} for scuttling during late 2009 and early 2010: her mast (which would have become a navigational hazard once the ship was scuttled) was removed, dangerous materials and toxins were removed, and <b>access</b> <b>holes</b> were cut in the ship's flanks. The ship {{was scheduled to be}} sunk on 27 March, [...] offshore from Avoca Beach, New South Wales, in [...] of water. Local resident action groups campaigned to prevent the scuttling, claiming that the wreck would affect tides and littoral sand drift, and that the removal of chemicals and hazardous materials in the ship had not been thorough enough, with the chance that marine life and people could be poisoned.|$|E
40|$|A custom {{version of}} the TerminatorBot is {{described}} for corebored inspection during search-and-rescue operations. “Corebored inspection ” refers to visual inspection of a void by passing a small camera through an <b>access</b> <b>hole</b> into the void. This is the classic “camera-on-a-stick ” approach. Sometimes the <b>access</b> <b>hole</b> occurs naturally. Sometimes a suspected void has no <b>access</b> <b>hole.</b> To gain <b>access,</b> a <b>hole</b> is bored through the rubble with a coring tool, hence the term “core-bored inspection. ” In either case, the camera, once inside, can articulate to look around, but is limited to line-of-sight. Occlusions can prevent a thorough inspection or force using/boring another hole. A small, agile robotic device could augment {{the use of such}} cameras. We propose the TerminatorBot as as a prototype limbed robot for studying such applications...|$|R

30|$|Nowadays, implant screw-retained {{prosthesis}} {{becomes a}} popular mode of implant supra-structure restoration. Cement retained implant restoration has issues including irretrievability and difficulty {{of controlling the}} cement excess beyond the abutment joint. The cement excess can be {{a major cause of}} peri-implantitis [13 – 15]. Screw-retained implant restoration has also some disadvantages including the difficulty to get a right positioning of the access-hole compatible with a suitable aesthetic appearance and the aesthetic result of the access-hole restoration [16]. Inclined abutment or angling the screw channel can be an option to ameliorate the aesthetical outcomes [17, 18]. Moving the <b>access</b> <b>hole</b> to an occlusal or palatal/lingual zone would increase the indication of screw retained implant restoration. The development of the computer-assisted implant surgery increases the use of the screw-retained prosthesis compared to the cement retained method [19, 20]. Nevertheless, the integrity of the filling of the <b>access</b> <b>hole</b> is necessary to preserve to occlusal function and the aesthetic outcomes. Moreover, the <b>access</b> <b>hole</b> filling contributes to reinforce the surrounding ceramic [9].|$|R

5000|$|DCCs {{are similar}} to compact cassettes, except {{that there are no}} [...] "bulges" [...] where the tape-access holes are located. The top side of a DCC is flat and there are no <b>access</b> <b>holes</b> for the hubs on there (they are not {{required}} because auto-reverse is a standard feature on all DCC decks), so this side can be used for a bigger label than can be used on an analog compact cassette. A spring-loaded metal shutter similar to the shutters on 3.5 inch floppy disks and MiniDiscs covers the tape <b>access</b> <b>holes</b> and locks the hubs while the cassette is not in use. Cassettes provide several extra holes and indentations so that DCC recorders can tell a DCC apart from an analog compact cassette, and so they can tell what the length of a DCC tape is. Also, there is a sliding marker on the DCC to enable and disable recording. Unlike the break-away notches on analog compact cassettes and VHS tapes, this marker makes it easier to make a tape recordable again, and unlike on analog compact cassettes, the marker protects the entire tape rather than just one side.|$|E

40|$|A neutron gauge must be {{calibrated}} {{before it}} can be used to measure volumetric water content. Calibration is a function of the design of the gauge's probe, the geometry of the <b>access</b> <b>hole,</b> and the composition of the material. It is typically derived from an empirical relationship between counts of neutrons and known water contents. For consolidated rocks, this empirical calibration is difficult. A calibration procedure based on a numerical model of a neutron gauge is developed to overcome the difficulties. The theory behind the model is the Three Group Diffusion theory. The input parameters are the gauge's design, the material's properties plus neutron cross sections, and the geometric proportionality factors for the <b>access</b> <b>hole.</b> The cross sections are determined in a graphite pile. The calibration is sensitive to the material's bulk density, thermal absorption and scattering cross sections. With this procedure a neutron gauge may be calibrated to any geologic material...|$|R
