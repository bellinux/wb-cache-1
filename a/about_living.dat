5|$|During {{the same}} year, the State of Texas {{announced}} it would provide $500,000 worth of grant funds to Gulfton-area agencies for crime prevention programs. The state targeted Gulfton because the zip code had 419 juvenile probation referrals, the highest for any zip code in Harris County. After the grant was established, GANO, the Shenandoah Civic Association, and GARC worked together to reduce juvenile crime. In 1995, Nelson Reyes, a counselor for immigrants from Mexico and El Salvador at the Gulfton Area Neighborhood Organization, said that local parents had positive attitudes <b>about</b> <b>living</b> in Gulfton as they made more money {{than they did in}} their home countries, but Gulfton-area children felt impacted by the area crime.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Hazel and Pipkin, the {{smallest}} {{member of the}} group, scout the nearby Nuthanger Farm, where they find two pairs of hutch rabbits. Despite their uncertainty <b>about</b> <b>living</b> wild, the hutch rabbits are willing to come to Watership. Hazel leads a raid on the farm the next day, during which he rescues both does but {{only one of the}} bucks. When the emissary returns soon after, Hazel and his rabbits learn that Efrafa is a police state led by the despotic General Woundwort. Holly and the other rabbits dispatched there have managed to return with little more than their lives intact.|$|E

5|$|Symeon {{taught that}} putting oneself under the {{guidance}} of a spiritual father was essential for those who were serious <b>about</b> <b>living</b> the spiritual life. That relationship was a historical tradition especially prominent among the Desert Fathers, who defined the qualifications for acting in the role of a spiritual father: personal experience; an interior life; purity of heart; the vision of God; insight; inspiration; discernment. Official ordination as a priest was not a requirement—Symeon's own spiritual father was a simple unordained monk who had many spiritual children. Symeon also taught that such teachers were empowered by their holiness to preach and to absolve others of their sins, a view that brought him into disagreement with church leaders of his time.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{many white}} Zimbabweans {{complained that they}} were {{suffering}} from racial discrimination. Many whites remained uneasy <b>about</b> <b>living</b> under the government of a black Marxist and they also feared that their children {{would be unable to}} secure jobs. There was a growing exodus to South Africa, and in 1980, 1700 whites—approximately a tenth of the white Zimbabwean population—emigrated. Mugabe's government had pledged support for the African National Congress and other anti-apartheid forces within South Africa, although did not allow them to use Zimbabwe as a base for their military operations. To protest apartheid and white minority rule in South Africa, Mugabe's government banned Zimbabwe from engaging South Africa in any sporting competitions. In turn, South Africa tried to destabilise Zimbabwe by blocking trade routes into the country and supporting anti-Mugabist militants among the country's white minority.|$|E

25|$|While the finds {{from other}} periods are of some interest, {{it is as}} an Anglo-Saxon site that Mucking is most significant.

The couple had numerous marital problems, notably Moore's alcoholism, insecurity <b>about</b> <b>living</b> {{in the shadow of}} Pickford's fame, and bouts of domestic violence. The couple lived together on-and-off for several years.|$|E

Clive Ruggles and Aubrey Burl suggest that this indicates that they were constructed to serve as local ritual centres for groups of subsistence farmers each inhabiting territories of <b>about</b> , <b>living</b> on an egalitarian basis without powerful leaders and possibly numbering no more than about twenty or thirty people per group.|$|E
25|$|In {{environmental}} terms, reuse {{ought to}} be more common than recycling and energy recovery, with both the financial and environmental costs of simple refurbishment of some products being a fraction of original manufacturing costs. If {{we are going to be}} serious <b>about</b> <b>living</b> in a Circular Economy we need to recognise the value of our waste and ensure resources are kept in the economy for longer, slow down the use of valuable raw materials and ensure that products are reused and materials are recycled rather than landfilled.|$|E

Charlie tells her he did not have such a liaison, and she believes him. Charlie was happy with the way his life with Nancy was and still is.

25|$|The {{events of}} 2011 greatly {{affected}} {{the writing process}} for the song, including the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami in March, the death of electronic musician Rei Harakami in July and turmoil in Yamaguchi's personal life. Yamaguchi wanted both the song and Documentaly {{to act as a}} record {{of what it was like}} to live in the post-earthquake period of 2011 in Japan, so expressed all of these events while writing the song. While questioning what were distinct things <b>about</b> <b>living</b> in 2011, Yamaguchi was inspired to write lyrics about online opinions. He noted that in YouTube-style commentary, people posted their opinions primarily as reactions to other peoples' opinions, while the majority of people had a third-person view of the entire process. He felt that this series of comments upon comments was a very particular aspect of living in 2011.|$|E
25|$|During the 1980s, {{crime rates}} in New York City were peaking after rising since 1966. Between 1966 and 1981, violent crime {{rates in the}} city had more than tripled from 325 to 1100 violent crimes per 100,000 people annually. By mid-decade, the city had a {{reported}} crime rate over 70% higher {{than the rest of}} the United States. In 1984, there were 2 homicides, 18 violent crimes, and 65 property thefts reported per 10,000 people. The subway became a symbol of the city's inability to control crime. In an opinion poll of New York City residents taken the month after the shootings, more than half of those surveyed said crime was the worst thing <b>about</b> <b>living</b> in the city; about a quarter said they or a family member had been a victim of crime in the last year; and two-thirds said they would be willing to pay for private security for their building or block.|$|E
25|$|Monasticism grew {{steadily}} and the monasteries {{quickly became}} major landowners with {{large population of}} peasants living their estates. It developed further under the reign of Emperor Peter I, accompanied with augmentation of their properties. Many high-ranking nobles {{and members of the}} ruling family tonsured and died as monks, including Boris I, his brother Doks, Peter I, the ichirgu-boila Mostich, etc. The growing opulence of monastic life led to an increase of asceticism among more pious monks. One of them, John of Rila, became a hermit in the Rila Mountains and his virtues soon attracted a number of followers, who founded the renowned Rila Monastery after his death. He preached <b>about</b> <b>living</b> in harmony and stressed the value of manual labour and the need the monks never to aspire to riches and power. John of Rila was revered as a saint while he was still alive and eventually became patron of the Bulgarian people.|$|E
