500|$|Alex's {{friendships with}} her fellow {{trainees}} also form {{the crux of}} the character as well as the series, especially her friendship with her roommate and best friend Shelby. Johanna Braddy, who plays Shelby, told TV Guide that Shelby's friendship with Alex {{is a big part of}} Quantico. Safran talked to Entertainment Weekly that the idea for their friendship came from the similarity between the characters. He said [...] "So for Alex and Shelby, you know, as roommates and as friends, we just really loved the idea of these two people from two different parts of the world, <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> don't touch upon each other, but they actually at their core are both very driven, successful, smart, and kind humans that find each other." [...] One of the other characters Alex is very close to, other than Shelby, was Simon, who is killed in the finale. Talking about losing a friend and its repercussions on the Season2, Chopra explained: [...] "She's extremely affected [...] doesn't believe in sharing her emotions or opening up with someone." ...|$|E
500|$|Aronofsky and cinematographer Matthew Libatique also {{discussed}} using a limited palette of colors, {{an approach that}} started with Aronofsky's Pi and continued with Requiem for a Dream. In The Fountain, the primary colors are gold and white. Gold represents [...] "the Mayans, a sort of fool's gold, a false truth"; Aronofsky explained the choice, [...] "When you see gold, it represents materialism and wealth and <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> distract us from the true journey that we're on." [...] White was chosen to represent mortality and truth. Weisz's characters are white, and wear white or are enveloped in white light to accentuate this presentation. Secondary colors are green, representing the color of life, and red, representing death. The director also used similar geometric constructs in the film to distinguish the three storylines. The 16th century conquistador's tale reflected triangles through pyramids and constellations, the 21st century researcher's period reflected rectangles through doors, windows, and computer screens, and the 26th century contemplative's journey reflected circles and spheres through the spacecraft and stellar bodies.|$|E

60|$|The {{result of}} <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> was <b>that</b> Tom Brixton settled {{down near the}} village where his mother dwelt, and Fred Westly, after staying long enough among the Sawback Mountains to dig out of them a sufficiency, {{returned}} home and bought a small farm beside his old chum.|$|R
500|$|In June 2010, Autumn {{released}} the acronym of her upcoming album, F.L.A.G., on her Twitter account, before revealing the full title as Fight Like a Girl. In her words, the meaning behind {{the title is}} [...] "about taking <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> make women the underdogs and using them to your advantage". Based on her fictional novel, The Asylum for Wayward Victorian Girls, the album {{has been described as}} [...] "an operatic feminist treatise set inside an insane asylum, wherein the female inmates gradually realize their own strength in numbers". On August 30, 2010, she announced that she would be undergoing jaw surgery, and recovered from it. In September 2011, she posted the full lyrics to the album's title track, [...] "Fight Like a Girl", on her Twitter account. Autumn appeared at the 2011 Harvest Festival in Australia, and had planned to debut two songs from Fight Like a Girl during those performances. On April 11, 2012, Autumn {{released the}} single [...] "Fight Like a Girl", with the song [...] "Time for Tea" [...] appearing as a B-side.|$|E
500|$|They met up in January 2001 in London {{to record}} the song. He went into a studio with only three tracks for the mix, and was {{impressed}} {{that there were many}} technicians and programmers that probably had been using a hundred. However, the singer was protecting the idea of the raw version, and said: [...] "This is how we wanted to be". They added two changes to the song and then {{spent the rest of the}} day recording Björk's vocals. They wanted to have only one take that really worked so that they did not have to edit different takes. They recorded 20 takes, and used the fifth or sixth, and because of that, the producer thought that [...] "this track is very intimate and personal because of the way the vocals were recorded". The way the song was recorded was [...] "kind of rough" [...] according to Knak; [...] "It's also very close to the mic; <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> you wouldn't normally keep. In that sense, it is very kind of, almost naked. In the structure and in the feeling because of the lyrics".|$|E
2500|$|In Luke 21:35-36, Jesus urges constant, unremitting {{preparedness}} on {{the part}} of his followers in light of the imminence of the end of history and the final intervention of God.

More happy than I have been here with you, for some time past; for one cannot but be very anxious, when one sees one's friends thrown into prison, and knows that you are opposed to <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>things,</b> and <b>that</b> it may be your turn next. Nothing would persuade me to leave you." ...|$|R

"When you're {{the first}} person to cross over this racial barrier, you're {{scrutinized}} for <b>all</b> <b>these</b> other <b>things</b> <b>that</b> {{have nothing to do with}} race, but they have everything to do with race—its a very strange thing", says Cho. Cho received heavy criticism for All-American Girl from the general public, from critics, and from Asian American viewers.|$|R
5000|$|After seeing Moon, Gyllenhaal {{lobbied for}} Jones to direct Source Code; Jones liked the fast-paced script; as he later said: [...] "There were {{all sorts of}} {{challenges}} and puzzles and I kind of like solving puzzles, so {{it was kind of}} fun for me to work out how to achieve <b>all</b> <b>these</b> difficult <b>things</b> <b>that</b> were set up in the script." ...|$|R
2500|$|In {{the wake}} of his defeat, Wallace adopted a hard-line segregationist stance and used this stand to court the white vote in the next gubernatorial {{election}} in 1962. When a supporter asked why he started using racist messages, Wallace replied, [...] "You know, I tried to talk about good roads and good schools and <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> have been part of my career, and nobody listened. And then I began talking about niggers, and they stomped the floor." ...|$|E
2500|$|Billy Corgan {{has said}} that he was {{inspired}} to write a story based 'the Fool's Journey' from the Tarot. [...] Corgan has explained his interpretation of this view: [...] "There's childlike innocence when you just don't really know anything in the world and it all seems sort of big and magical...the teen, aware but not really liking what's going on...the third person that's cynical, where you get kind of bitter because you feel so small and there's <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> are sort of happening and there's not much you can do about it...the fourth stage out of that would be finding a sort of spiritual place within yourself where you can live in reality, you can see it for what it is, but maybe you can find a deeper source of inspiration and peace." [...] In other words, the album finds Corgan [...] "looking past, present and future {{all at the same time}} and trying to have that perspective".|$|E

60|$|Now, {{let that}} teach you a lesson--I don't {{know just what}} it is. But at seventy years old I find that memory of {{peculiar}} value to me. I have been unconsciously guided by it <b>all</b> <b>these</b> years. <b>Things</b> <b>that</b> seemed pigeon-holed and remote are a perpetual influence. Yes, you're taught in so many ways. And you're so felicitously taught when you don't know it.|$|R
60|$|From <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> Foster judged <b>that</b> {{this was}} one of the women's apartments, and {{wondered}} much that he had been admitted into such a jealously-guarded sanctuary, but relieved his mind by setting it down to that eccentricity for which Ben-Ahmed was noted.|$|R
5000|$|It's {{really like}} sort of got-together chaos. Because we all panicked a little, even {{as soon as}} a month before the release date that we had planned, we really hadn't got {{anything}} put together. We had <b>all</b> <b>these</b> great <b>things</b> <b>that</b> we'd done, but we couldn't possibly put it out as an album. And so we just got them together, and did a little bit of editing here and there.|$|R
6000|$|One day {{the little}} maid {{sat for a}} long while silent after he had ended speaking. At last she drew a deep breath. [...] "And are <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> thou tellest me about the priests in their castle really true?" [...] said she.|$|E

6000|$|Conclusion Eighth.

6000|$|But I think, at {{this time}} especially, {{there is so much}} to be {{considered}} in the necessity the country will be under of having money, and the necessity of justice it is always under, to consider the physical and moral wants of the poor man's home, as to justify a man in saying: [...] "I must wait a little, all taxes are more or less objectionable, and so no doubt are these, but we must have some; and I have not made up my mind that <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> are mixed up together are taxes on knowledge in reality." ...|$|E

50|$|Think {{about all}} this, Cardinal, and consult with other {{leaders of the}} Church how you can support the great {{undertaking}} of National Socialism to prevent the victory of Bolshevism {{and how you can}} achieve a peaceful relationship to the state.

60|$|Nay, Grey Beaver himself {{sometimes}} tossed him a {{piece of}} meat, and defended him against the other dogs in the eating of it. And such {{a piece of}} meat was of value. It was worth more, in some strange way, then a dozen pieces of meat from the hand of a squaw. Grey Beaver never petted nor caressed. Perhaps it was the weight of his hand, perhaps his justice, perhaps the sheer power of him, and perhaps it was <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> influenced White Fang; for a certain tie of attachment was forming between him and his surly lord.|$|E

60|$|And {{there were}} others who {{had a vision of}} {{brooding}} watchers, and others who imagined great sentinels before a veiled figure, and some one who felt nothing more divine than a sensation of happiness and freedom such as one gets from a sudden burst of sunshine in the spring....
