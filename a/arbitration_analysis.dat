40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the current criticisms of Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) are ill-informed, and {{attempts}} at reforming the system are misguided. The definition of ISDS itself has been, for a long time, limited to investment quasi-judicial bodies or at best <b>arbitration.</b> <b>Analysis</b> of {{the roots of the}} ever growing backlash reveals that the main causes for concern are politically negotiated investment treaties, an inherently biased system, lack of transparency, and inconsistent decision-making. Examination of the core reasons behind these complaints leads {{to the conclusion that the}} EU Commission’s solution to reform ISDS through a permanent court raises more issues and will throw ISDS into disarray. A better approach is to accept the premise that the current system needs improvement. However, accepting this premise requires regulating disputes themselves, rather than simply regulating the resolution of cases, and establishing standards when unable to regulate these. The regulation of disputes would allow the work already begun by UNCITRAL through its notes on transparency to continue. This study will review how introducing mediation to regulate the process of Investor State Disputes (ISD) can improve and indeed complement the procedural gap evident in the current ISDS system. In particular, while considering more recent investment regimes, it will use the current effort by the Energy Charter Treaty Secretariat to facilitate mediation within the Treaty as an example of how this can be done...|$|E

40|$|Arbitration {{is one of}} the {{principal}} alternative dispute resolution forums utilized in unionized and in many nonunion organizations to achieve procedural justice. With arbitration of labor and employment disputes, there is an expectation that certain characteristics are present: representativeness, accuracy, consistency, freedom from bias, ethicality, and correctability (Leventhal, Karuza, & Fry, 1980). There also is an expecta-tion that arbitration will be a rapid and inexpensive final solution to workplace conflicts. It is intended to be the ultimate form of representativeness, in that both the process and the content of the dispute are to be based on negotiation between the two parties. However, in reality, there is concern that the procedure is not always viewed as just, diminishing employee and group voice (Lind & Earley, 1992). In addition, lack of acceptance of the outcome can subsequently diminish the consistency of arbitration. The parties may seek other resolutions in subsequent disputes, such as mediation (Bingham, Hallberlin, Walker, & Chung, 2009), and perhaps collective bargaining Keywords <b>arbitration,</b> content <b>analysis,</b> justice, vacate...|$|R

40|$|Since radio {{frequency}} identification (RFID) technology has become increasingly common in numerous applications, including large-scale supply chain management, improving the efficiency of RFID tag identification is an important task. In practical settings, the identification of RFID tags often occurs in a dynamic environment, in which tags move through a specific interrogation range. However, the literature contains few studies {{on the design of}} efficient identification protocols in dynamic environments. This study proposes a novel tag identification protocol that is particularly efficient in dynamic environments. the proposed protocol involves two anti-collision techniques: adaptive n-Resolution (AnR) and k-Collision Arbitration (kCA). These two techniques significantly improve the tag identification delay and communication overhead. This improvement is primarily due to the use of a newly designed challenge-response bit sequence mechanism and the information obtained from the previous tag identification procedure. As a result, AnR requires only a constant number of interrogation times regardless of the number of target tags, while kCA further improves the efficiency of tag identification with k-splitting collision <b>arbitration.</b> Rigorous <b>analysis</b> and simulation experiments show that this tag identification protocol significantly outperforms related methods (by at least 48. 85 % identification delay and 23. 87 % communication overhead can) ...|$|R

Risks associated with products and services have also increased, as have mass problems and mass damages, often in a transborder dimension. The US and the European Community, though battling against common problems, maintain different standard setting and enforcement regimes. This paper focuses on enforcement regimes, thereby distinguishing between administrative enforcement via agencies and judicial collective enforcement via European collective actions and US class actions. The existing theoretical framework depicting administrative and judicial enforcement as alternative strategies is contrasted against modern developments in the US and the EC. In the field of consumer protection administrative control and judicial collective enforcement are being understood more as functional complements than alternatives.

40|$|The present thesis {{argues that}} the current legal {{framework}} regulating online cross-border business-to-consumer arbitration reduces the consumer confidence in online <b>arbitration.</b> The <b>analysis</b> focuses on the law applying to online cross-border business-to-consumer arbitration in England and on the U. S. Federal level, as these are identified as main emerging legal systems in this field. The main points {{in support of the}} above argument are as follows: First, the current rules do not oblige the business to notify the consumer about the existence of the arbitration clause in the B 2 C e-commerce contract. Second, the current choice of law rules applicable to online cross-border B 2 C arbitration do not ensure the consumer that he will enjoy the protection awarded to him under the law of his country of domicile. Third, the current jurisdiction rules applicable to online B 2 C arbitration do not give the consumer the right to litigate disputes related to online arbitration agreements and processes in the Courts of his country of domicile. Fourth, the current rules governing the online arbitral procedures do not promote the consumer perception of fairness. Finally, this thesis concludes that consumer confidence is essential for the success of this form of electronic dispute resolution, and that it can be increased by the adoption of an international convention which resolves all the above mentioned problems.

40|$|The {{meaning of}} state {{sovereignty}} is changing, and international-relations scholars remain largely unable to explain, or even describe, {{exactly what it}} has become. Given the vague and over-analyzed nature of term, the difficulty of studying it is understandable. One unexplored method of analysis, used in this dissertation, is to ask how sovereignty is being spoken of in international legal disputes in three important legal tribunals: the International Court of Justice, the World Trade Organization Dispute Settlement Body, and the International Chamber of Commerce Court of <b>Arbitration.</b> What <b>analysis</b> of cases from these three bodies from the mid- 1970 s to the mid- 1990 s reflects is that Sovereignty is not a concrete and static attribute of states, but rather it is an ongoing process, constantly redefined by independent actions. For the period discussed, the sovereign state did not have one single form, but rather had many different “faces”: the Prince, the Protector, the judge, the Citizen, and the Merchant. These faces describe a dynamic of states 2 ̆ 7 competing roles based on three important tenets about international relations, politics, and law. First, historical context is relevant. Second, entities are not defined by one role. Third, process and the consequence of process are important factors in determining the role the state plays and the stage upon which that role is played. ...|$|R
40|$|Many {{collective}} {{decision-making and}} bargaining situations {{can be described}} through {{the set of the}} feasible joint evaluations of all conceivable settlements. Attention should then be restricted to that subset (Pareto-optimal frontier) from which no joint gains are possible. Hence, the focal issue becomes which element of the Pareto-optimal subset should be chosen as a solution to the dispute. This paper proposes an arbitration procedure to address this issue. The proposed approach, decision-analytic in its nature, is inspired by LaValle's (LaValle, I. H. 1978. Fundamentals of Decision Analysis. Holt, Rinehart and Winston, New York.) allocation-function approach (which is not specific on how to obtain an allocation function) and by Eliashberg and Winkler's (Eliashberg, J., R. L. Winkler. 1981. Risk sharing and group decision making. Management Sci. 27 (November) 1221 [...] 1235.) work (which does not accommodate probability differences within the group).

40|$|Several {{authors and}} {{practitioners}} have bemoaned {{the fact that}} in the current international commercial arbitration practice, there is an excessive use of discovery. International arbitration seems to be losing its cost-effectiveness and attractiveness, in comparison to court litigation. This study explores the reasons for this present tendency, and argues, as a tentative thesis, that the overuse of discovery is a consequence of cognitive illusions on the part of parties as well as arbitrators. Based on insights provided by “behavioral law & economics” studies on cognitive psychology and human behavior, it will be argued that arbitrators have failed to properly exercise their role as the gatekeepers of discovery. More specifically, it will be shown that heuristics and biases affect their decision-making process when it comes to discovery. In order to restore arbitration’s original efficiency and fundamental values, this study suggests that arbitration institutions should more strictly regulate the use of discovery, and at the same time, reduce arbitral discretion. The analysis is organized as follows. Part I provides a description of the originally limited scope of discovery in international arbitration, and the original intuitions that lie behind the procedural discretion granted to tribunals. Part II verifies whether the idea of limited use of discovery in arbitration is consistent with a cost and benefit analysis. To conduct this analysis, traditional “law and economics” theory will be used together with insights from “game theory” and “behavioral law and economics”. Part III examines the causes of the current tendency toward allowing broad discovery in international <b>arbitration.</b> This <b>analysis</b> will focus on the decision-making processes of arbitrators, arguing that they could be affected by “bounded rationality”. Part IV provides some possible solutions for restoring the original values of international arbitration, and offers concluding remarks...|$|R
40|$|This Article uses recent {{developments}} in the enforcement of arbitration agreements to illustrate {{one way in which}} strategic dynamics can drive doctrinal change. In a fairly short period of time, arbitration has grown from a method of resolving disputes between sophisticated business entities into a phenomenon that pervades the contemporary economy. The United States Supreme Court has encouraged this transformation through expansive interpretations of the Federal Arbitration Act. But not all courts have embraced arbitration so fervently, and therefore case law in this area is marked by tension and conflict. The thesis of this Article is that we can better understand developments in arbitration doctrine by viewing the case law as the product of an ongoing strategic interaction between courts with differing preferences regarding the spread of arbitration. As the Supreme Court has shut off most other means of resisting arbitration, the state law doctrine of unconscionability has {{in the last several years}} become a surprisingly attractive and successful tool for striking down arbitration agreements. The nature of unconscionability analysis is that it is flexible, which provides opportunities for courts skeptical of arbitration to use the doctrine to evade the Supreme Court’s pro-arbitration directives while simultaneously insulating their rulings from Supreme Court review. Sophisticated resistance to arbitration is just one side of the story, however. The approach employed in this Article examines the judicial system as a whole, including the ways pro-arbitration courts respond, sometimes indirectly, to what they perceive as manipulation of unconscionability. The suspicion that some courts are disfavoring arbitration drives pro-arbitration courts to change their strategies, such as by establishing new doctrine that facilitates monitoring and shifts decisionmaking authority. This strategic framework can help us make sense of otherwise puzzling trends in arbitration doctrine and can help us predict what moves will be next. Although the specific subject matter is <b>arbitration,</b> this <b>analysis</b> is also aimed at those interested in more general problems of judicial federalism...|$|R
40|$|This paper studies whether on-the-job {{performance}} of labor market participants responds {{to changes in}} relative compensation. I construct a matched dataset of arbitration cases involving compensation of police bargaining units in New Jersey and monthly arrest rates at the municipality level to test whether arrests rates depend on the <b>arbitration</b> outcome. The <b>analysis</b> shows that, while {{in the months before}} arbitration there was not a statistically significant difference in per capita arrest rate between cities where the arbitrator ruled in favor of the police and cities in which the arbitrator ruled against the police, in the months following arbitration there was about a 10 % difference, with winning police forces yielding more arrests than losing police forces. I also explore the determinants of the post-arbitration performance differences between winning and losing bargaining units. I find that the post-arbitration differential in arrests between police winning and police losing cities is increasing in the spread of the finaloffers. Additionally, this differential is also increasing in the difference between the expected award and the arbitrator award, suggesting that post-arbitration changes in arrests are most serious when the ruling is considered a relative surprise. These results indicate that New Jersey police officers reacted to disappointing outcomes {{in a way that is}} consistent with the officers having preferences over wages depending on a reference point...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} I analyze the {{following}} points {{from the standpoint}} of incentives for investors: (a) What functions does arbitration between investors and national governments with regard to investment treaties (investment treaty arbitration) fulfill; and (b) what is the significance of specific system design with regard to arbitration, in particular the allowance of a choice between arbitration and domestic court hearings. Following the rapid {{increase in the number of}} investment treaties in recent years, investment treaty arbitration is attracting attention as a general dispute resolution mechanism for investment treaties. There has, however, been insufficient study with regard to the functions that investment treaty arbitration fulfills and, more specifically, how its procedures should be designed. In this paper, I focus on two specific aspects of court hearings and arbitration: first, their neutrality; and second, the consistency of judgments and the possibility of predicting them. I analyze how incentives for investors are influenced by the differences between court hearings and arbitration regarding these two factors, and the possibility of choosing between court hearings and <b>arbitration.</b> What this <b>analysis</b> clearly shows is that while it is not always desirable for investors to use arbitration, it is always desirable for investors to be able to choose between arbitration and court hearings, although their usefulness differs from situation to situation. If the situation involves issues implicitly assumed by traditional investment treaties, for example "incompetent and unfair courts, and competent and fair arbitration tribunals," then both will produce desirable results for investors. But at present such an assumption is not necessarily valid. In view of this, it is necessary to reexamine the functions of arbitration itself and the most desirable form of its procedures. ...|$|R

Siekiant detaliai išanalizuoti pasirinktą temą, gilinamasi į įvairias situacijas, kylančias ar galinčias kilti praktikoje. Straipsnyje daugiausia remiamasi užsienio specialiąja literatūra, taip pat aktualia teismų praktika, Lietuvoje galiojantis teisinis reglamentavimas lyginamas su kitų valstybių teisiniu reguliavimu, stengiamasi pateikti siūlymus, kurie būtų tinkami, siekiant visapusiškos teismų pagalbos arbitrų skyrimo procese.

Arbitrator’s {{appointment}} {{is usually}} {{one of the}} most crucial aspects of arbitration, maybe even the most important after arbitration agreement itself. However, there are cases when arbitrator cannot be appointed in accordance with the agreed appointment mechanism. Therefore, both international and national laws foresee rules regulating the issue of arbitrator’s appointment. One of the possible scenarios to appoint arbitrator is to apply to a national court with a request of appointment. This scenario is also foreseen in Lithuanian law on Commercial Arbitration. The subject-matter {{of this article is to}} analyse the issues related to the role of the courts in arbitration proceedings when the court is requested to appoint the arbitrator. When UNCITRAL adopted its new Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration in 2006, Lithuania amended its Law on Commercial Arbitration in 2012. This new law provides for modern approach towards court assistance to arbitration and allows national court to help arbitration proceedings by appointing arbitrator. Nevertheless, after four years of the application of this new law, there is almost no case-law on the issue. However, the popularity of arbitration is growing in Lithuania. Therefore, it is necessary to analyse in what situations and on what grounds the court may assist <b>arbitration</b> proceedings. <b>Analysis</b> of the subject-matter of this article will be useful for both arbitration scholars and practitioners. In particular, the author examines cases when parties to arbitration proceedings have the right to apply to the court to appoint an arbitrator. The author also analyses which courts are competent in solving this category of disputes as well as whether the appointment of arbitrator in the court has any influence on the recognition or recourse proceedings. In order to reveal the subject-matter of this article author examines various situations which arise or may arise in the practice. The doctrine of foreign countries as well as case-law is the main source of this article. Legal regulation of Lithuania is compared to the regulation of foreign countries. After examining the abovementioned questions, author concludes that the provisions on arbitrator’s appointment of the Law on Commercial Arbitration should be interpreted broadly. In author’s opinion, court assistance to arbitration in arbitrator’s appointment should be possible not only in ad hoc arbitration but also when institutional arbitration is chosen because different interpretation of the law could make arbitration proceedings impossible. The author also concludes, that before appointing the arbitrator, the court should suggest, for the last time, the party to arbitration to appoint the arbitrator. Only if the passive party refuses to fulfil its duty, the court should appoint independent, neutral and qualified arbitrator...|$|R
40|$|In {{the recent}} years, {{e-commerce}} has gained much importance. Traditional commerce (in {{which case the}} customer physically goes to the merchant’s shop, purchases goods and/or services and makes a payment) is slowly being replaced with e-commerce and more people tend to prefer doing their shopping online. One {{of the main reasons}} for this attraction is the convenience the e-commerce provides. Customers can choose from a lot of different merchants at the convenience of their homes or while travelling by avoiding the hassle and stress of traditional shopping. However, e-commerce has lots of challenges. One key challenge is trust as transactions take place across territories and there are various legal & regulatory issues that govern these transactions. Various protocols and underlying e-commerce technologies help in the provision of this trust. One way to establish trust is to ensure fair exchange. There is also a question about traceability of transactions and customers’ need for privacy. This is provided by anonymity – making sure that the transactions are untraceable and that the customers’ personal information is kept secret. Thus the aim of this research is to propose a protocol that provides fair exchange and anonymity to the transacting parties by making use of a Trusted Third Party. The research is also aimed at ensuring payment security and making use of a single payment token to enhance the efficiency of the protocol. The proposed protocol consists of pre-negotiation, negotiation, withdrawal, purchase and <b>arbitration</b> phases. The <b>analysis</b> of the protocol proves that throughout all the phases of the e-commerce transaction, it is able to provide fair exchange and complete anonymity to the transacting parties. Anonymity provides the privacy of customers’ data and ensures that all Personally Identifiable Information of the transacting parties are kept hidden to avoid misuse. The protocol proposed is model checked to ensure that it is able to show that the fair exchange feature is satisfied. It is implemented using Java to show that it is ready-to-use and not just a theoretical idea but something {{that can be used in}} the real-world scenario. The security features of the protocol is taken care of by making sure that appropriate cryptographic algorithms and protocols are used to ensure provision of confidentiality and integrity. This research explores those areas that have not been covered by other researchers with the idea that there is still a lot of scope for improvement in the current research. It identifies these v opportunities and the ‘research gaps’ and focuses on overcoming these gaps. The current e-commerce protocols do not cover all the desirable characteristics and it is important to address these characteristics as they are vital for the growth of e-commerce technologies. The novelty of the protocol lies in the fact that it provides anonymity as well as fair exchange using a Trusted Third Party that is entirely trustworthy unlike certain protocols where the trusted third party is semi-trusted. The proposed protocol makes use of symmetric key cryptography wherever possible to ensure that it is efficient and light weight. The number of messages is significantly reduced. This overcomes the drawback identified in various other protocols which are cumbersome due to the number of messages. Anonymity is based on blind signature method of Chaum. It has been identified that usage of other methods such as pseudo-identifiers have resulted in the inefficiency of the protocol due to the bottlenecks created by these identifiers. It also ensures anonymity can never be compromised unlike certain protocols whereby an eavesdropper can find out the customer’s identity as the customer is required to disclose his/her public key during transactions. Further to this, the protocol also provides immunity against message replay attacks. Finally, the protocol always assumes that one or more parties can always be dishonest which is unlike certain protocols that assume only one party can be dishonest at any point. This ensures that all scenarios are taken into consideration and two parties cannot conspire against the other thus compromising on the fairness of the protocol. Detailed analysis, implementation, verification and evaluation of the protocol is done to ensure that the research is able to prove that the protocol has been carefully designed and the key goals of fair exchange and anonymity. All scenarios are taken into consideration to prove that the protocol will indeed satisfy all criteria. The research thus expects that the protocol could be implemented in real-life scenarios and finds a great potential in the e-commerce field...|$|R
40|$|Une première étude sur les décisions arbitrales dans le Québec, 1950 - 1952, a été publié antérieurement dans le numéro de mars dernier. Le même auteur essayait alors d'y déceler les principaux problèmes que considèrent les tribunaux d'arbitrage. Dans l'analyse précédente, les seules comparaisons possibles se faisaient avec les données des {{conventions}} collectives: dans cette analyse-ci l'auteur, compare le contenu des recommandations avec celles de l'an dernier. The labour disputes {{which go}} to arbitration increase {{from year to}} year in the Province of Quebec. This is not necessarily an alarming fact because of the various factors which help to explain it. The union memberships as well as the agreements in force have increased considerably during recent years. The keener economic competition, the harder struggle for markets and the decrease in the •consumer demand have strengthened the resistance of employers to union demands. The lack of confidence of union leaders in governmental services certainly make the workers' side touchy and brings to arbitration some disputes that could have, in a more peaceful atmosphere, been settled by conciliation. Among the union federations, the C. C. C. L. comes first with the highest proportion of arbitrations required by the unions affiliated with it. The grievances which have necessitated arbitration have increased {{because of the lack of}} technical training of the labour leaders, of the increasing complexity of the methods of production and ways of remuneration. The arbitrations recommend working conditions inferior to current conditions in the industry or if they contain similar advantages, it is after a certain delay. This is what might be called the "theory of readjustment" to define the economic function of arbitration. The recommendations in regard to wages in 1952 - 53 make a good example: whereas during the two preceding years when wages in industry had increased rapidly, the increases proposed by arbitration had been inferior to them; during the last year, when a certain wage, stabilization was under way, the arbitration boards have recommended increases higher than the average increase in industry. Retroactivity which is the best instrument for readjustment in working conditions was also included more often in the past year. The stipulations respecting holidays, hours of work and paid statutory holidays show the same tendencies as industry, but they are weaker or behind time. Only the arbitration recommendations for three weeks vacation require a shorter length of continuous service than the clauses to be found in agreements. The same phenomenon of increasing similarity between the proposals and arbitrations and the facts would be noticed in the union security clauses if it were not for the legalism which prevail against this point. The arbitration boards keep to, in their recommendations, clauses of which the legality is recognized and refuse more and more to grant formulas of the compulsory type. The compulsory clauses are proposed less frequently and are refused in a large number of cases. The union requests are also less exacting on this point. The employers attempt to change the favourable clauses that they had accepted in previous agreements. Union security raises the question of union liberty which is at the base of the labour laws of the Province. The object of the law is to protect the right of each worker to belong to the association of his choice. However, from the time a union is certified, it is recognized by the law as the sole bargaining agent in the enterprise concerned. During the whole year, except during the eleventh month of the agreement when the workers may change affiliation, the liberty of association for non-union workers consists in becoming, or not becoming, a member of the union legally certified or only in belonging to another union which for the present cannot act. The rapid turnover of the presidents of arbitration boards and their members shows the difficulty in securing qualified persons. The Province of Quebec has not succeeded in forming a body of competent arbitrators, qualified to acquire the confidence of the workers and the employers. The solution is to enlarge their field of knowledge, to furnish them with standards and statistics which will permit them to judge in a clearer way and finally to be able to hold meetings where a common analysis of the problems would help them to render more acceptable awards. The length of arbitration procedures is also another aspect to which some attention should be directed. Many boards take longer than the delay of three months fixed by law to give their award. The causes of delay should then be examined and a system organized which would result in more rapid procedure. The wording of the awards is often vague. The objects which have been discussed are badly defined or not sufficiently specified. Perhaps a uniform method of awards would help indicate the exact extent of points under litigation and would make it possible to carry on more extended research. Research of a scientific character should be undertaken on the function of arbitration. The study of cases would be valuable in determining the real objects in dispute in most arbitrations. At what point does arbitration constitute a notable step in the settlement of disputes, to what extent do the recommendations of the board serve as a basis or at least simplify the negotiations after <b>arbitration?</b> A systematic <b>analysis</b> after examination of methods used outside the Province, discussions and studies of similar problems would greatly help to come to a scientific method of procedure for solving labour disputes. It would be a sign of lack of responsibility to continue to allow to operate in such a way an arbitration system which often plays an important part in the settlement of disputes...|$|R
