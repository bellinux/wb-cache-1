5|$|The VB series {{retained}} 96percent of {{the preceding}} HZ Kingswood's interior space, despite being 14percent smaller in overall dimensions, although fivepercent larger than the Torana. With the Commodore dropping a full class below the Kingswood and its Ford Falcon competitor, the smaller Commodore was predictably more fuel-efficient. This downsizing was first seen as a major disadvantage for Holden, as they had effectively relinquished the potential of selling Commodores to the fleet and taxi industries. These sales losses {{were thought to be}} unrecoverable; however, the 1979 energy crisis saw Australian oil prices rise by 140percent, putting substantial strain on the <b>automotive</b> <b>industry</b> to collectively downsize, a change that Holden had already done.|$|E
5|$|Turkey has a {{sizeable}} <b>automotive</b> <b>industry,</b> which produced over 1.3 million motor vehicles in 2015, ranking as the 14th largest producer in the world.

5|$|Holden's second {{full-scale}} car factory, {{located in}} Fishermans Bend (Port Melbourne), {{was completed in}} 1936, with construction beginning in 1939 on a new plant in Pagewood, New South Wales. However, World War II delayed car production with efforts shifted {{to the construction of}} vehicle bodies, field guns, aircraft and engines. Before the war ended, the Australian Government took steps to encourage an Australian <b>automotive</b> <b>industry.</b> Both GM and Ford provided studies to the Australian Government outlining the production of the first Australian-designed car. Ford's proposal was the government's first choice, but required substantial financial assistance. GM's study was ultimately chosen because of its low level of government intervention. After the war, Holden returned to producing vehicle bodies, this time for Buick, Chevrolet, Pontiac and Vauxhall. The Oldsmobile Ace was also produced from 1946 to 1948.|$|E
5|$|In recent years, {{in order}} to {{minimize}} labor costs in high production manufacturing, industrial welding has become increasingly more automated, most notably with the use of robots in resistance spot welding (especially in the <b>automotive</b> <b>industry)</b> and in arc welding. In robot welding, mechanized devices both hold the material and perform the weld and at first, spot welding was its most common application, but robotic arc welding increases in popularity as technology advances. Other key areas of research and development include the welding of dissimilar materials (such as steel and aluminum, for example) and new welding processes, such as friction stir, magnetic pulse, conductive heat seam, and laser-hybrid welding. Furthermore, progress is desired in making more specialized methods like laser beam welding practical for more applications, such as in the aerospace and automotive industries. Researchers also hope to better understand the often unpredictable properties of welds, especially microstructure, residual stresses, and a weld's tendency to crack or deform.|$|E
5|$|In some instances, the <b>automotive</b> <b>industry</b> {{and others}} were {{directly}} responsible for the decline of public transportation. The Great American streetcar scandal saw GM, Firestone Tire, Standard Oil of California, Phillips Petroleum, Mack Trucks and other companies purchase a number of streetcars and electric trains in the 1930s and 1940s, such that 90percent of city trolleys had been dismantled by 1950. It was argued {{that this was a}} deliberate destruction of streetcars {{as part of a larger}} strategy to push the United States into automobile dependency. In United States v. National City Lines, Inc., many were found guilty of antitrust violations. The story has been explored several times in print, film and other media, for example in Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Taken for a Ride and The End of Suburbia.|$|E

5|$|North Philadelphia {{continued}} to grow during the early 20th century as a popular residential area for the nouveau riche rejected by old money society. Two ballparks (the Baker Bowl and Shibe Park) were located nearby, as were new cultural institutions and <b>automotive</b> <b>industry</b> buildings. In 1928, the Broad Street Subway was opened with a station at North Philadelphia, offering more frequent service to Center City. Its northern entrances were located {{at the intersection of}} Glenwood Avenue and North Broad Street, with an underground passage offering an easy connection to the PRR station. The Reading Company replaced Huntingdon Avenue station with North Broad Street station, a massive Classical Revival structure rivaling the PRR station in grandeur. 30th Street Station opened in 1933, reducing North Philadelphia's importance for north-south services. However, North Philadelphia {{continued to}} serve heavy commuter traffic and east-west long-distance trains.|$|E
5|$|Rapid {{economic}} development {{during the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries fostered the rise of many prominent industrialists. Tycoons like Cornelius Vanderbilt, John D. Rockefeller, and Andrew Carnegie led the nation's progress in railroad, petroleum, and steel industries. Banking became {{a major part of}} the economy, with J. P. Morgan playing a notable role. Edison and Tesla undertook the widespread distribution of electricity to industry, homes, and for street lighting. Henry Ford revolutionized the <b>automotive</b> <b>industry.</b> The American economy boomed, becoming the world's largest, and the United States achieved great power status. These dramatic changes were accompanied by social unrest and the rise of populist, socialist, and anarchist movements. This period eventually ended with the advent of the Progressive Era, which saw significant reforms in many societal areas, including women's suffrage, alcohol prohibition, regulation of consumer goods, greater antitrust measures to ensure competition and attention to worker conditions.|$|E

5|$|The 1980s were {{challenging}} for Holden and the Australian <b>automotive</b> <b>industry.</b> The Australian Government tried {{to revive the}} industry with the Button car plan, which encouraged car makers to focus on producing fewer models at higher, more economical volumes, and to export cars. The decade opened with the shut-down of the Pagewood, New South Wales production plant and introduction of the light commercial Rodeo, sourced from Isuzu in Japan. The Rodeo was available in both two- and four-wheel drive chassis cab models {{with a choice of}} petrol and diesel powerplants. The range was updated in 1988 with the TF series, based on the Isuzu TF. Other cars sourced from Isuzu during the 1980s were the four-wheel drive Jackaroo (1981), the Shuttle (1982) van and the Piazza (1986) three-door sports hatchback. The second generation Holden Gemini from 1985 was also based on an Isuzu design, although, its manufacture was undertaken in Australia.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, Reynolds and Reynolds signed {{agreements}} {{with the rest of}} the Big Three automotive manufacturers, several major insurers, General Electric and others. In 1986 the company acquired National Medical Computer Services and a business forms company called Arnold Corporation. By the end of that year, Reynolds had more than $200 million in annual revenue, 42 percent of which came from business forms. Reynolds acquired several smaller technology companies in the 1990s and further developed its software products. Reynolds and Reynolds acquired PD Medical Systems in 1994, forming Reynolds Healthcare Systems. Reynolds Healthcare Systems in turn later acquired a business document company, Fiscal Information, which serves radiologists. From 1994 to 1996, David Holmes led the acquisition of several other business forms and computer businesses outside the <b>automotive</b> <b>industry</b> for a total of $155 million. By 2000, Reynolds and Reynolds had revenues of $800 million and more than one-third of its users were General Motors dealerships. It sold the Information Solutions Group (ISG), which primarily sold business forms and supplies to non-automotive companies, that year to the Carlyle Group for $360 million.|$|E
