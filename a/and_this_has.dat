5|$|After 1948, the {{greatest}} impact came from the large migration of Jews from Turkey, Iraq, Kurdistan and Yemen, and Mizrahi Jews from North Africa, particularly Morocco. Typically, the staff of army kitchens, schools, hospitals, hotels and restaurant kitchens has consisted of Mizrahi, Kurdish and Yemenite Jews, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> had an influence on the cooking fashions and ingredients of the country.|$|E
5|$|Apart from {{arguments}} {{over whether or}} not austerity, rather than increased or frozen spending, is a macroeconomic solution, union leaders have also argued that the working population is being unjustly held responsible for the economic mismanagement errors of economists, investors, and bankers. Over 23 million EU workers have become unemployed {{as a consequence of the}} global economic crisis of 2007–2010, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> led many to call for additional regulation of the banking sector across not only Europe, but the entire world.|$|E
5|$|For centuries {{there has}} been a general market held each Friday in the Market Place. The market has been in decline for some years and in 2010 {{attempts}} were made to revitalise it. However, after initial interest, the number of stallholders slowly decreased. In recent months a number of suitcase traders have been supporting the market on a regular basis <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> attracted local interest.|$|E

5|$|However, {{justiciability}} is {{a concept}} that eludes precise categorization or definition, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> caused disquiet amongst some critics. The implication is that there may be some unfairness where questionable executive action remains unchallenged. Nonetheless, the concept of justiciability is useful in determining the likelihood of whether an executive action is within the purview of judicial review.|$|E
5|$|M. inclemens {{is one of}} the 11 {{species in}} genus Maevia. The species was first called Attus inclemens, and other names have been used. The two male forms look and behave so {{differently}} that they were originally considered two distinct species. In 1955 Robert Barnes chose M. inclemens, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> become the standard name.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the many}} medical imaging {{techniques}} available, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) {{appears to be}} superior in differentiating Alzheimer's disease from other types of dementia, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> been shown to give a greater level of accuracy compared with mental testing and medical history analysis.

5|$|Other related {{studies have}} also shown {{evidence}} of synaptic alterations and their loss, in the ageing brain. Changes in gene expression alter the levels of proteins in various pathways <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> {{been shown to be}} evident in synaptic contact dysfunction or loss. This dysfunction has been seen to affect many structures of the brain and has a marked effect on inhibitory neurons resulting in a decreased level of neurotransmission, and subsequent cognitive decline and disease.|$|E

5|$|The area drained by Pine Island Glacier {{comprises}} about 10% of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.

5|$|The {{atmospheric}} pressure decreases with altitude, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> {{an effect on}} the absolute pressure of the diving environment.

5|$|The natural {{hosts of}} {{influenza}} viruses are pigs and birds, {{although it has}} probably infected humans since antiquity. The virus can cause mild to severe epizootics in wild and domesticated animals. Many species of wild birds migrate <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> spread influenza across the continents throughout the ages. The virus has evolved into numerous strains and continues to do so, posing an ever-present threat.|$|E

5|$|The {{official}} version, as {{recorded by}} the Japanese Imperial Army, indicated that he was executed and then hung upside down from a cherry tree due to his 2 days of stubborn retaliation and for not surrendering. (Other accounts say {{that he might have}} been tied to the tree first, then repeatedly bayoneted to death.) British accounts have confirmed that his corpse was found hung upside down after the surrender <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> been repeated in a number of authoritative texts on the Malayan campaign.|$|E
5|$|The river has a {{long history}} of {{improvements}} to facilitate navigation from Bridgwater to Taunton, and has also been used to power mills along its length. These two objectives are often antagonistic, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> been the case on the River Tone.|$|E
5|$|As {{his sons}} had desired and planned, Wilberforce {{has long been}} viewed as a Christian hero, a statesman-saint held up {{as a role model}} for putting his faith into action. More broadly, he has also been {{described}} as a humanitarian reformer who contributed significantly to reshaping the political and social attitudes of the time by promoting concepts of social responsibility and action. In the 1940s, the role of Wilberforce and the Clapham Sect in abolition was downplayed by historian Eric Williams, who argued that abolition was motivated not by humanitarianism but by economics, as the West Indian sugar industry was in decline. Williams' approach strongly influenced historians for much of {{the latter part of the}} 20th century. However, more recent historians have noted that the sugar industry was still making large profits at the time of abolition, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> led to a renewed interest in Wilberforce and the Evangelicals, as well as a recognition of the anti-slavery movement as a prototype for subsequent humanitarian campaigns.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of the}} process, the Proprietors leased {{the canal}} to British Waterways in 2005. However, British Waterways had to {{withdraw}} from the scheme in 2008, due to financial difficulties, and the role of project leaders was taken over by Stroud District Council. Following the re-organisation, the Stroud Valleys Canal Company was established in March 2009. It is a limited company, with two independent directors and three directors representing Stroud District Council, the Proprietors, and the Cotswold Canals Trust. Its purpose is to hold the assets for the canals, and its charitable status means that stamp duty land tax {{does not have to be}} paid. The company will be responsible for management and maintenance of the canal once it is re-opened. The Department for Transport is in the process of reorganising how funding for major transport schemes is managed, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> enabled Stroud District Council to submit a bid for £1.5 million to the newly formed Gloucestershire Local Transport Board. This is to fund the replacement of Ocean railway culvert with a bridge. A second application for £650,000 has been made to enable part of the Thames and Severn Way long distance footpath to be created. The funding is for the section from Saul Junction to Chalford.|$|E
5|$|Cancers can {{be induced}} in animals at many sites. At {{sufficiently}} high doses TCDD has caused cancer in all animals tested. The most sensitive is liver cancer in female rats, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> {{long been a}} basis for risk assessment. Dose-response of TCDD in causing cancer {{does not seem to}} be linear, and there is a threshold below which it seems to cause no cancer. TCDD is not mutagenic or genotoxic, in other words, it is not able to initiate cancer, and the cancer risk is based on promotion of cancer initiated by other compounds or on indirect effects such as disturbing defense mechanisms of the body e.g. by preventing apoptosis or programmed death of altered cells. Carcinogenicity is associated with tissue damage, and it is often viewed now as secondary to tissue damage.|$|E
5|$|Cicadas are not major {{agricultural}} pests {{but in some}} outbreak years, trees may be overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of females laying their eggs in the shoots. Small trees may wilt and larger trees may lose small branches. Although in general, the feeding activities of the nymphs do little damage, during the year before an outbreak of periodic cicadas, the large nymphs feed heavily and plant growth may suffer. Some species have turned from wild grasses to sugar cane, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> affected the crop adversely, {{and in a few}} isolated cases, females have oviposited on food crops such as date palms, grape vines, citrus trees, asparagus and cotton.|$|E
