5|$|Jim Jones, {{the founder}} {{and leader of the}} Peoples Temple, tried to use Branham's fame to boost himself into the limelight. Jones, who was later known for the mass murder and suicide at Jonestown in November 1978, {{organized}} <b>a</b> <b>religious</b> convention that took place June 11 through June 15, 1956, at Cadle Tabernacle in Indianapolis. To draw crowds, Jones needed <b>a</b> <b>religious</b> headliner, so he arranged to share the pulpit with Branham.|$|E

25|$|One {{effect of}} {{segregation}} in churches may be continued segregation {{in other parts}} of U.S. society. <b>As</b> <b>religious</b> segregation furthers in-group homogeneity, it makes the racial divisions throughout all of society even more pronounced.|$|R
50|$|The Synod of Rathbreasail that {{established}} the Irish dioceses was held near Mountrath in 1111, moving the Church {{away from its}} monastic base. <b>As</b> <b>religious</b> orders with strong ties to Rome replaced older religious communities, the wooden buildings of the early Christian churches in Laois gave way to stone monasteries. The Augustinians and Dominicans established themselves at Aghaboe Abbey, while the Cistercians took over <b>an</b> older <b>religious</b> community at Abbeyleix.|$|R

5|$|The moral {{systems of}} religion, I think, are super important. We've raised our kids in <b>a</b> <b>religious</b> way; they've {{gone to the}} Catholic church that Melinda goes to and I {{participate}} in. I've been very lucky, and therefore I owe it to try and reduce the inequity in the world. And that's kind of <b>a</b> <b>religious</b> belief. I mean, it's at least a moral belief.|$|E
5|$|A large tumulus of {{uncertain}} {{origin and}} purpose stands approximately {{in the middle}} of the excavated area, between the old and new parts of the city. Various theories have been advanced to explain it, such as that it was a burial site, <b>a</b> <b>religious</b> structure of some kind, a funerary monument or a monument to a Roman victory. However, these remain unproven hypotheses.|$|E

5|$|After the English Reformation Northern England {{became a}} centre of Catholicism, and Irish {{immigration}} increased its numbers further, especially in North West cities like Liverpool and Manchester.

5|$|As an adult, Sibyl {{lived through}} King Stephen's {{turbulent}} reign, known to {{history as the}} Anarchy, in which her husband played a pivotal role.

2500|$|<b>As</b> <b>religious</b> literature, tracts {{were used}} {{throughout}} the turbulence of the Protestant Reformation and the various upheavals of the 17th century.

5|$|Besides poets, at {{high school}} Lewis met Sophie Carson, who {{eventually}} became his wife. Klein, their mutual friend, introduced them. Carson came from <b>a</b> <b>religious</b> Jewish family.

5|$|Davis {{experienced}} <b>a</b> <b>religious</b> awakening in 2011, {{following her}} mother-in-law's dying wish that she attend church. Since then Davis has identified {{herself as a}} Christian, belonging to the Apostolic Pentecostal movement, which favors what they describe as a literal interpretation of the Bible. She worships {{three times a week}} at the Solid Rock Apostolic Church near Morehead.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{experimental}} {{support for this}} hypothesis, it remains controversial. A common critique is that devoutness is easy to fake, such as simply by attending <b>a</b> <b>religious</b> service. However, the hypothesis predicts that {{people are more likely}} to join and contribute to <b>a</b> <b>religious</b> group when its rituals are costly. Another critique specifically asks: why religion? There is no evolutionary advantage to evolving religion over other signals of commitment such as nationality, as Irons admits. However, the reinforcement of religious rites as well as the intrinsic reward and punishment system found in religion makes it an ideal candidate for increasing intragroup cooperation. Finally, there is insufficient evidence for increase in fitness as a result of religious cooperation. However, Sosis argues for benefits from religion itself, such as increased longevity, improved health, assistance during crises, and greater psychological well being though both the supposed benefits from religion and the costly-signaling mechanism have been contested.|$|E
5000|$|Neo-Advaita is <b>a</b> New <b>Religious</b> Movement {{based on}} a modern, western {{interpretation}} of Advaita Vedanta, especially the teachings of Ramana Maharshi. According to Arthur Versluis, neo-Advaita is part of <b>a</b> larger <b>religious</b> current which he calls immediatism, [...] "the assertion of immediate spiritual illumination without much if any preparatory practice within <b>a</b> particular <b>religious</b> tradition." [...] Neo-Advaita is criticized for this immediatism and its lack of preparatory practices. Notable neo-advaita teachers are H. W. L. Poonja and his students Gangaji, Andrew Cohen,, and Eckhart Tolle.|$|R
