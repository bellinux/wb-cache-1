5|$|An intubating stylet is a {{malleable}} metal wire {{designed to be}} inserted into the endotracheal tube to make the tube conform better to the upper airway anatomy of the specific individual. This <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> commonly used with a difficult laryngoscopy. Just as with laryngoscope blades, there are also several types of available stylets, such as the Verathon Stylet, which is specifically designed to follow the 60° blade angle of the GlideScope video laryngoscope.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Nauru {{recognised}} Kosovo as {{an independent}} country, and in 2009 Nauru became the fourth country, after Russia, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, to recognise Abkhazia, a breakaway region of Georgia. Russia {{was reported to be}} giving Nauru $50million in humanitarian aid {{as a result of this}} recognition. On 15 July 2008, the Nauruan government announced a port refurbishment programme, financed with US$9million of development aid received from Russia. The Nauru government claims this <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> not related to its recognising Abkhazia and South Ossetia.|$|E
25|$|Disposable hearing <b>aids</b> <b>are</b> hearing <b>aids</b> {{that have}} a {{non-replaceable}} battery. These <b>aids</b> <b>are</b> designed to use power sparingly, so that the battery lasts longer than batteries used in traditional hearing aids. Disposable hearing <b>aids</b> <b>are</b> meant to remove the task of battery replacement and other maintenance chores (adjustment or cleanings).|$|R
50|$|The first hearing <b>aid</b> <b>was</b> {{created in}} the 17th century. The {{movement}} toward modern hearing aids began {{with the creation of}} the telephone, and the first electric hearing <b>aid</b> <b>was</b> created in 1898. By the late 20th century, the digital hearing <b>aid</b> <b>was</b> distributed to the public commercially. Some of the first hearing <b>aids</b> <b>were</b> external hearing <b>aids.</b> External hearing aids directed sounds in front of the ear and blocked all other noises. The apparatus would fit behind or in the ear.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the issues of}} foreign aid and its policies. The supposed justifications of foreign <b>aid</b> <b>are</b> introduced and examined. The morality and constitutionality of the many motives for foreign <b>aid</b> <b>are</b> weighed against reason, feeling, the Constitution and the Bible. Through thorough examination of foreign <b>aid,</b> it <b>is</b> shown that foreign <b>aid</b> funds <b>are</b> often dispensed nonchalantly and without proper motive {{on the part of}} the U. S. government. More significantly, proper motive and response to foreign <b>aid</b> among taxpayers <b>is</b> hindered. Even so, some aspects of foreign <b>aid</b> <b>are</b> not justified by the Constitution. Existing foreign <b>aid</b> should <b>be</b> modified as to be more effective and reduced to the most necessary instances...|$|R
5|$|Nauru has no armed forces, {{though there}} is a small police force under {{civilian}} control. Australia is responsible for Nauru's defence under an informal agreement between the two countries. The September 2005 Memorandum of Understanding between Australia and Nauru provides the latter with financial aid and technical assistance, including a Secretary of Finance to prepare the budget, and advisers on health and education. This <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> in return for Nauru's housing of asylum seekers while their applications for entry into Australia are processed. Nauru uses the Australian dollar as its official currency.|$|E

40|$|Adjunct <b>aids</b> <b>are</b> {{instructional}} interventions {{inserted in}} textbooks {{in view of}} supporting learners to process the information. Different types of adjunct <b>aids</b> <b>are</b> assumed to support different cognitive processes. Research on adjunct aids has focussed on the learning effects of single types of adjunct aids. In this study, the learning effects of combinations of adjunct <b>aids</b> <b>are</b> studied. After completing a pre-test, 255 students studied a text presented on 21 separate computer screens in one of eight conditions. Their use of the adjunct <b>aids</b> <b>was</b> logged. After studying the text, a post-test was administered. Results show no impact of conditions on either knowledge or transfer items.

5|$|When the Syndicate {{suspect that}} one of their members is passing {{information}} to Mulder and Scully, they organise a canary trap to find the leak, using information about the safety of Mulder's mother as bait. X's role as an informant is discovered, and he is shot dead, although he is able to pass along the name of another informant who can be of use to Mulder—Marita Covarrubias (Laurie Holden), the Special Representative to the Secretary-General of the United Nations. Covarrubias' <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> sought when Mulder attempts to reach Tunguska in Russia to investigate the source of a further black oil contamination. Whilst there, Mulder is held in a gulag and used as a successful test subject for a black oil vaccine. He escapes and is able to return to America, having found that Krycek is working with the Russians.|$|E
5|$|Syracuse University Ambulance, {{commonly}} referred to as SUA, is a SU Health Services-based student organization that responds to over 1,500 medical emergencies each year. Providing intermediate life support (ILS), rapid cardiac defibrillation, emergency and nonemergency transportation, and special event standby services, SUA operates two full-time transporting ambulances, a supervisor's fly car, and a MCI trailer for mass-casualty incidents. Additionally, SUA operates four transport vans for non-emergency transports. Advanced life support (ALS) mutual <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> provided by the City of Syracuse's private EMS provider, Rural/Metro Medical Services. SUA was formed in 1973 by a group of students out of a need for emergency medical services on campus. Starting with only a few members and meager equipment, the Syracuse University Medical Crisis Unit was formed. The organization has evolved greatly over time but, with 70+ volunteer students, remains a student-run organization to this day. SUA provides emergency and non-emergency services 24 hours a day, 7 days a week during the academic school year and is funded by a portion of the student health fee.|$|E
50|$|The first {{commercial}} digital hearing <b>aid</b> <b>was</b> created in 1987 by the Nicolet Corporation.

Two years later, in 1989, the behind-the-ear (BTE) digital hearing <b>aid</b> <b>was</b> launched.|$|R
