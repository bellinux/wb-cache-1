Explaining her motivation, she said she would often connect images, childhood memories, emotions and fantasies to songs she {{was in the midst of}} composing, and that she [...] "wanted people to hear the songs with the story that's in my head as that's what makes it mine". She highlighted the [...] "immersive experience" [...] of Michael Jackson's Thriller (1982) as the principal influence for creating a body work that would mean [...] "people would hear things differently and [...] <b>actually</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> see the whole vision of the album".|$|E
500|$|Conker's Bad Fur Day {{received}} critical acclaim, with {{an aggregate}} review score of 92 out of 100 at Metacritic. Many publications and websites declared the graphics {{were the best}} on the Nintendo 64. Critics noted that the game featured a number of technical effects that were uncommon at the time, especially for a Nintendo 64 game, such as dynamic shadowing, coloured lighting, large areas with a long draw distance, no distance fog, detailed facial animations, lip syncing, and individually rendered fingers on some characters. Shane Satterfield of GameSpot {{went so far as}} to say that the game [...] "makes other Nintendo 64 games look like 16-bit software." [...] IGN's Matt Casamassina praised the detailed 3D worlds, [...] "fantastic" [...] texture work, and cute character designs. He remarked that [...] "Conker himself is equipped with an in-game facial animation system that realistically portrays his different moods as he travels the lands. When he's scared, he looks it, and when he's pissed off players will <b>actually</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> see his teeth showing in a frown." [...] Reviewers noted occasional drops in the frame rate, but most agreed it did not interfere with the gameplay.|$|E
500|$|Originally, Descent 3 was {{intended}} to support both a software and a hardware renderer, implying that the rendering process of the game could take place either in the CPU or dedicated hardware like a video card. However, about six months after starting development, the team decided {{to go with a}} hardware-only renderer because it allowed them to create [...] "visually stunning" [...] graphics and maintain a solid frame rate without worrying about the limitations imposed by the software renderer. This was a difficult decision since the team had to scrap many tools and software rendering technology that were already developed. In addition, computers with hardware acceleration were not common at the time the decision was made. As the developers noted, [...] "We knew just by looking at our progress on the game under acceleration that we had a beautiful looking game with all the latest technologies — but would anyone <b>actually</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> play it?" [...] Fortunately, as development progressed, hardware acceleration became more popular with each passing year. The game natively supports the Direct3D, Glide and OpenGL rendering APIs for graphics, and the A3D and DirectSound3D technologies for sound.|$|E

500|$|Migratory birds may use two {{electromagnetic}} {{tools to}} find their destinations: one that is entirely innate and another that relies on experience. A young bird on its first migration flies in the correct direction according to the Earth's magnetic field, but {{does not know how}} far the journey will be. It does this through a radical pair mechanism whereby chemical reactions in special photo pigments sensitive to long wavelengths are affected by the field. Although this only works during daylight hours, it does not use the position of the sun in any way. At this stage the bird is in the position of a Boy Scout with a compass but no map, until it grows accustomed to the journey and can put its other capabilities to use. With experience it learns various landmarks and this [...] "mapping" [...] is done by magnetites in the trigeminal system, which tell the bird how strong the field is. Because birds migrate between northern and southern regions, the magnetic field strengths at different latitudes let it interpret the radical pair mechanism more accurately and let it know when it has reached its destination. There is a neural connection between the eye and [...] "Cluster N", the part of the forebrain that is active during migrational orientation, suggesting that birds may <b>actually</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> see the magnetic field of the earth.|$|E
500|$|The album {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics. The Guardian called it [...] "the kind of ambitious avant-pop hybrid that gets Björk rapturous acclaim". AllMusic wrote that [...] "Murphy keeps the alluring sensuality and unpredictable quirks that made Moloko unique, without sounding like she's rehashing where she's already been". Stylus Magazine said the album [...] "happily represents {{something of a}} midpoint between the downright oddity of Moloko's early albums...and the mix of disco sensibility and wrenching balladry of their swansong". PopMatters referred to the album as [...] "one {{of the best examples}} of production shaping but not overwhelming the artist's vision". The Guardian agreed, stating that because of Herbert's production, Murphy sounded [...] "sonically enticing and varied…at times sultry, rude, powerful and tender across white noise, waltz time signatures and jazz sass" [...] but was mixed on the album overall, adding that the pair [...] "their noodling eclipse the songs, leaving few you'll <b>actually</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> sing back to anyone". Pitchfork Media remarked that [...] "it's hard to imagine anyone not ranking this is the best thing Murphy has ever done" [...] and that [...] "when the songwriting is on, Ruby Blue seems perfect, the ultimate combination of human warmth and technological know-how". The publication listed the album at number forty-one in its list of the top fifty albums of 2005.|$|E

30|$|Even {{though the}} syllabuses {{prescribe}} {{a significant number}} of goals and skills, the findings suggest that a number of these skills are not acquired by the students during their participation in the project. At the same time, this study shows that students develop other kinds of competence that are not necessarily reflected within the course syllabuses. So, there are differences between the types of competence stated by the course syllabuses and what the students <b>actually</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> learn from this project.

40|$|Brushless DC drives {{are widely}} used in {{different}} fields of application because of their high efficiency and power density. Torque ripple can be {{considered one of the}} drawbacks of these drives. This paper proposes a method to reduce the torque ripple in BLDC drives.

This is done by computing an optimum reference current based on the phase back-EMF waveform. The proposed approach is implemented in a self-sensing drive so its applicability to self-sensing BLDC motor drives is verified. Simulation and experimental results are given and discussed to show that the proposed method <b>actually</b> <b>is</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> improve torque production...|$|R
