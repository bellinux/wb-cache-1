5|$|Oliver {{arrives at}} Holby City Hospital as an F1 doctor, {{alongside}} his sister Penny (Emma Catherwood). He acquires Penny's preferred rotation on the Acute <b>Assessment</b> <b>Unit</b> (AAU), where he develops a flirtatious relationship with ward sister Chrissie Williams (Tina Hobley). Within weeks, their relationship becomes sexual. Chrissie becomes pregnant, but later miscarries. They break up, and Oliver {{moves on to}} date ward sister Daisha Anderson (Rebecca Grant). A transfer to the cardiothoracic surgery ward has him working under registrar Jac Naylor (Rosie Marcel). While Daisha spends Christmas with her family in the Philippines, Oliver kisses Jac. Upon her return, Daisha learns of the tryst. Soon thereafter, she is shot during a hostage situation and Oliver struggles to cope. Although she recovers, she opts to leave Holby and {{move back to the}} Philippines.|$|E
5|$|Donna {{arrives at}} Holby City Hospital {{as a staff}} nurse on the general surgery ward, making a poor first {{impression}} by being disorganised and insolent. Mistakenly believing that living with her superior will ensure her an easy time at work, Donna invites herself {{to move in with}} nurse Lisa Fox (Luisa Bradshaw-White). The two have a strained relationship: within weeks, Donna is evicted for falling behind on her rent, and when she is later allowed to move back in, she lets bailiffs take Lisa's possessions after failing to keep up her own loan repayments. Forced to run a shift in charge of the hospital's Acute <b>Assessment</b> <b>Unit</b> as recompense, Donna struggles to manage and learns a new respect for Lisa. During this period, Donna has a friendship with midwife Mickie Hendrie (Kelly Adams). Mickie is questioning her sexuality, and the two have sex while drunk. Mickie is disappointed when Donna states that it was just a one-night stand, but they are able to reconcile their friendship. When the general surgery ward is downsized, Donna is forced to reapply for her job. Although she gives a good interview and impresses Lisa, other candidates have more experience, so she is unable to retain her position and has to work as a bank nurse.|$|E

40|$|This paper evaluates {{effects on}} tax {{compliance}} of simple reforms in personnel {{policy in the}} Indian income tax administration. Taxpayers voluntarily disclosing higher incomes are currently assigned to special <b>assessment</b> <b>units.</b> To avoid this, high income taxpayers have an added incentive to understate their incomes. Empirical evidence consistent with this hypothesis is found.

25|$|Holby City {{follows the}} {{professional}} and personal lives of medics at the fictional Holby City Hospital. Malick was introduced as a new member of the hospital's Acute <b>Assessment</b> <b>Unit</b> staff, after almost being fired for assaulting his boss. Conflict with his colleagues, anger management and a desire for career advancement formed a focal point of his early story-lines. The character gradually softened, and Akingbola portrays him as being fundamentally good-hearted. Malick is gay; he develops a rivalry with orthopaedic surgeon Dan Hamilton (Adam Astill), who later kisses him during a fight. His alpha male characterisation has attracted critical praise, while his pairing with Dan received a more mixed response, including viewer complaints about the kiss.|$|E
25|$|Malick is {{introduced}} {{on the verge}} of being fired from Holby City Hospital, after assaulting his boss on the Day Care Surgical ward. He explains to Director of Surgery Henrik Hanssen (Guy Henry) that it was necessary to save a patient: resuscitation had been abandoned, but after forcefully taking control of the situation, Malick was able to revive them. On the proviso that he attends anger management counselling, Hanssen gives Malick a final chance and attaches him to the Acute <b>Assessment</b> <b>Unit</b> (AAU). There, he soon clashes with the unit's staff: consultant Michael Spence (Hari Dhillon), Foundation doctor Penny Valentine (Emma Catherwood), and ward sister Frieda Petrenko (Olga Fedori). Relations begin to improve when Malick is left in charge of the unit for the day. Although he initially dismisses Penny's diagnoses and advice, ultimately he is forced to call on Michael for help and realises that she was right all along. He also becomes Frieda's mentor when she is accepted onto the Foundation programme. A racist patient makes a complaint about Malick; when her condition rapidly deteriorates in theatre, he walks out, causing the junior AAU staff to believe he has abandoned them. Malick soon returns with a crash team and saves the patient's life. Penny develops a crush on him, but Frieda informs her he is gay.|$|E

500|$|It was {{revealed}} that his return to Holby {{was part of a}} deal made with hospital manager, Christopher Sutherland.

Geological Survey (USGS) {{recently}} completed a study of undiscovered petroleum resources in the Russian Arctic {{as a part of}} its Circum-Arctic Resource Appraisal (CARA), which comprised three broad areas of work: geological mapping, basin analysis, and quantitative assessment. The CARA was a probabilistic, geologically based study that used existing USGS methodology, modified somewhat for the circumstances of the Arctic.

Probabilistic results for individual <b>assessment</b> <b>units</b> were statistically aggregated, taking geological dependencies into account. The U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) funds were used to support the purchase of crucial seismic data collected in the Barents Sea, East Siberian Sea, and Chukchi Sea for use by USGS in its assessment of the Russian Arctic.

500|$|Series {{producer}} Richard Stokes {{believes that}} the series' popularity {{stems from the fact}} the hospital setting presents numerous plotline opportunities, explaining: [...] "You have licence to create life-and-death situations every week, something you cannot do in any other set piece. The interaction of the characters can be sexy and social issues also permeate the writing. But, basically, hospital drama is successful because the viewers will forgive all the yukky bits for the wonder of a life saved." [...] The focus of the series has developed since its conception, expanding to cover extra wards, including a gynaecology ward, an acute <b>assessment</b> <b>unit</b> and a maternity ward. When the maternity ward and a special care baby unit were introduced during series four, Young explained that new wards were necessary to allow the crew to rotate sets, maximising filming potential.|$|E

She also supported him through his Non-Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosis, and enlisting his support in illegally proving a patient's death through negligence. In the show's tenth series, Maddy also formed a fast respect for the new head of the hospital's Acute <b>Assessment</b> <b>Unit,</b> Linden Cullen (Duncan Pow). Pow ruled out a romance between the two characters, however, stating: [...] "They're protective of each other, but they're more like brother and sister than anything else. I don't think he's ready for the relationship merry-go-round at Holby just yet". He added that: [...] "Any man would be a fool to turn down Maddy, but Linden wants his wife back". Similarly, Lewington has assessed that neither Sam nor Linden are Maddy's ideal man, and instead she is [...] "waiting for a new hunk!" ...|$|E

40|$|Doctor of Philosophy(PhD) Many {{people believe}} that ‘purpose-built’ {{facilities}} will diminish some of the challenging behaviours exhibited by older people with dementia or psychiatric conditions. This study aimed to explore and understand what hands-on nurses in psychogeriatric <b>assessment</b> <b>units</b> experience and think of the built environment {{as a part of}} their day to day work. Twenty-one unstructured interviews were conducted with nurses at three psychogeriatric <b>assessment</b> <b>units.</b> The units ranged in style from an ancient adapted building to a contemporary 'purpose-built' facility. A critical hermeneutics derived from Gadamer was used to explore the interviews. It found that nurses think of the built environment in relation to the care needs of their patients, and feel bureaucratic restrictions in using the built environment more keenly than the shortcomings of the built environment itself. Nurses saw themselves and their patients as 'outcasts' or victims of those with money and power. The study concludes with suggestions for challenging the status quo, but also considers that being regarded as 'outcasts' allows opportunities to avoid being overly impressed by technological marvels...|$|R

40|$|The {{integration}} of conservation area designs for aquatic and terrestrial species {{has been a}} challenge for planners. The difficulties of crafting a single suitability index which reflects the landscape condition relative to all species, terrestrial and aquatic, and choosing <b>assessment</b> <b>units</b> appropriate for both realms, have made integration especially problematic. Here I will introduce a new technique, vertical integration, which allows planners to analyze aquatic and terrestrial targets simultaneously by using separate layers of <b>assessment</b> <b>units,</b> crafted to match the natural boundaries of the targets being assessed, with suitability indices incorporating impacts specific to those targets. Conservation Areas identified through a vertically integrated solution are efficient, and offer specific information about where to capture each target group individually, and where to capture them together.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the origins and}} purpose of the land <b>assessment</b> <b>units</b> known as ouncelands and pennylands, known from those areas of Scotland which came under Norse rule prior to the Treaty of Perth in 1266. The study is interdisciplinary [...] drawing on archaeological, toponymic and numismatic material {{as well as on}} documentary evidence. The extent to which the ounceland and pennyland units may be based on pre-Norse systems of assessment is considered, as is the probability of their introduction as an offshoot of the Norwegian lei angr (ship levy) system, as has previously been argued. The broader European context for the development of land assessment and military obligation is also briefly discussed. The conclusions of the thesis are that the ounceland assessment may have been introduced as early as the 10 th- 11 th centuries, while the pennyland assessment was probably introduced in the mid- 11 th century. Both <b>assessment</b> <b>units</b> appear to have been superimposed onto pre-Norse land divisions, at least in some areas of the Norse settlements in Scotland. This dating would put the development of assessment systems in Norse Scotland later than much of Europe, but earlier than most of Scandinavia...|$|R
