5|$|Quatermass is {{rescued by}} a group of elderly people living in a scrap yard. At the hospital, the doctors are shocked when Isabel levitates off her bed and explodes in <b>a</b> <b>cloud</b> <b>of</b> <b>dust.</b> Elsewhere, the devastated Kapp is left alone in the ruins of his cottage and observatory. More and more young people are joining the Planet People, {{including}} the gangs that have been terrorising the cities and the soldiers assigned to keep them away from the Megalithic sites. Contact is restored with Chuck Marshall and with the Russians in the form of Gurov (Brewster Mason). Quatermass theorises {{that this is not the}} first time this has happened; megalithic sites such as prehistoric stone circles are in fact markers where beacons have been left by the alien force for its next visit. Quatermass believes the force is a sphere of energy surrounding the Earth. The Russians and the Americans send a space shuttle, commanded by Marshall, to make contact with the force. Quatermass is sceptical; he believes they are dealing not with an intelligence but with a machine constructed to harvest human protein. The space shuttle is destroyed but not before Marshall reports a giant beam of light stretching in all directions. Meanwhile, the Planet People are gathering at Wembley Stadium in the tens of thousands. Annie and Quatermass travel to the stadium but are powerless to prevent the Planet People from gathering. When they are attacked, Annie drives their car into the underground car park beneath the stadium where she crashes the vehicle and is killed. The lightning strikes the stadium.|$|E
25|$|An {{eyewitness}} {{described an}} incident during {{the pursuit of}} the Austrians. As the French cavalry advance guard approached Crema in <b>a</b> <b>cloud</b> <b>of</b> <b>dust,</b> the observer made out the leading horseman yelling at the Austrian stragglers whom he encountered on the road. It was Beaumont. The general dismounted his men, who were on their best behavior, and requested refreshment for his unit. At the time much of the army was on a plundering rampage, looting everything in sight.|$|E
25|$|The Khan also {{employed}} {{tactics that}} made his numbers seem greater than they actually were. During night operations he ordered each soldier to light three torches at dusk to give the illusion of an overwhelming army and deceive and intimidate enemy scouts. He also sometimes had objects tied to the tails of his horses, so that riding on open and dry fields raised <b>a</b> <b>cloud</b> <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> that gave the enemy the impression of great numbers. His soldiers used arrows specially notched to whistle as they flew through the air, creating a terrifying noise.|$|E

25|$|The Confederates {{were not}} the only ones to misjudge the situation, however. When Bragg learned that his men had not {{attacked}} as ordered, he came to Perryville himself to lead the attack. In realigning to an attack posture, the Confederates stirred such <b>a</b> <b>cloud</b> <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> that the approaching Union force believed they were retreating to Harrodsburg. This gave Bragg's men the advantage of surprise when they opened fire on McCook's forces at 2 PM on October 8. While McCook was being pushed back on the left flank, the Union center held strong until the right flank began to collapse.|$|E
25|$|In 1943, the Soviet {{astronomer}} Otto Schmidt {{proposed that}} the Sun, in its present form, passed through a dense interstellar cloud, emerging enveloped in <b>a</b> <b>cloud</b> <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> and gas, from which the planets eventually formed. This solved the angular momentum problem by assuming that the Sun's slow rotation was peculiar to it, and that the planets did not form {{at the same time}} as the Sun. Extensions of the model, together forming the Russian school, include Gurevich and Lebedinsky (in 1950), Safronov (in 1967,1969), Safronov and Vityazeff (in 1985), Safronov and Ruskol (in 1994), and Ruskol (in 1981), among others However, this hypothesis was severely dented by Victor Safronov who showed that the amount of time required to form the planets from such a diffuse envelope would far exceed the Solar System's determined age.|$|E
25|$|The X-Men {{return from}} their {{confrontation}} with Blob and Pyro {{to find the}} mansion in ruins and the Professor and Kitty unconscious. Xavier once again reads Magneto's thoughts, this time learning the full details of his plan. Magneto plans to redirect the passing Scorpio comet onto {{a collision course with}} Earth. This would send up <b>a</b> <b>cloud</b> <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> and debris, blocking out the Sun for years, plunging the planet into another Ice Age, which would leave normal humans weakened, allowing the mutants to take over. The X-Men leave at once for Magneto's orbiting sanctuary Asteroid M, but the X-Men instruct Kitty to stay, as the mission is far too dangerous and she has not been trained. Kitty, however, wanting to prove her worth and make amends for her previous failure, phases aboard the Blackbird and hides, with the Professor's blessing.|$|E

500|$|On 12 February 1991, at a {{distance}} of [...] from the Sun, Halley displayed an outburst that lasted for several months, releasing <b>a</b> <b>cloud</b> <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> 300,000km across. The outburst likely started in December 1990, and then the comet brightened from magnitude 24.3 to magnitude 18.9. Halley was most recently observed in 2003 by three of the Very Large Telescopes at Paranal, Chile, when Halley's magnitude was 28.2. The telescopes observed Halley, at the faintest and farthest any comet has ever been imaged, in order to verify a method for finding very faint trans-Neptunian objects. Astronomers are now able to observe the comet at any point in its orbit.|$|E
500|$|... "Barbette," [...] writes Cocteau, [...] "transforms {{effortlessly}} {{back and}} forth between man and woman. His female glamour and elegance Cocteau likens to <b>a</b> <b>cloud</b> <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> thrown into the eyes of the audience, blinding it to the masculinity of the movements he needs to perform his acrobatics. That blindness is so complete {{that at the end of}} his act, Barbette does not simply remove his wig but instead plays the part of a man. He rolls his shoulders, stretches his hands, swells his muscles...And after the fifteenth or so curtain call, he gives a mischievous wink, shifts from foot to foot, mimes a bit of an apology, and does a shuffling little street urchin dance – all of it to erase the fabulous, dying-swan impression left by the act." [...] Cocteau calls upon his fellow artists to incorporate deliberately this effect that he believes for Barbette is instinctive.|$|E

2500|$|Critics {{also suggest}} that a {{combination}} of clouds, atmospheric effects and natural sunlight could have created the reported visual phenomena. Steuart Campbell, writing for the edition of Journal of Meteorology in 1989, postulated that a cloud of stratospheric dust changed the appearance of the sun on 13 October, making it easy to look at, and causing it to appear to be yellow, blue, and violet, and to spin. In support of his hypothesis, Mr. Campbell reported that a blue and reddened sun was reported in China as documented in 1983. Paul Simons, in an article entitled [...] "Weather Secrets of Miracle at Fátima", stated that it is possible that some of the optical effects at Fátima may have been caused by <b>a</b> <b>cloud</b> <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> [...] from the Sahara.|$|E
2500|$|Dan Patch {{celebrated his}} ninth {{birthday}} in 1905, an {{age at which}} racehorses are considered past their prime. From this point onward, the expectation that he would set a new record on any given trial was lower, but the horse's popularity remained intact. Dan Patch made his first appearance {{of the year in}} September at the Minnesota State Fair before a crowd of 98,000, followed by a crowd of 55,000 at Indianapolis and more than 100,000 in Allentown. He then shipped to Lexington where he tied his own world record of 1:56 while surrounded by <b>a</b> <b>cloud</b> <b>of</b> <b>dust,</b> leading the New York Times to call him the [...] "Black Whirlwind". Two days later, Dan Patch outdid himself, setting his official record of 1:55, a time that would remain a record for over 30 years.|$|E
2500|$|Huygens {{landed at}} around 12:43 UTC on January 14, 2005 with an impact speed similar to {{dropping}} a ball on Earth from {{a height of}} about one meter (3 feet).

It slowed due to friction with the surface and, upon coming to its final resting place, wobbled back and forth five times. Each wobble was about half {{as large as the}} previous one. Huygens' sensors continued to detect small vibrations for another two seconds, until motion subsided about ten seconds after touchdown. The probe kicked up <b>a</b> <b>cloud</b> <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> (most likely organic aerosols that drizzle out of the atmosphere) which remained suspended in the atmosphere for about four seconds by the impact.|$|E
