5|$|Health-care {{coverage}} in the United States {{is a combination of}} public and private efforts and is not universal. In 2014, 13.4% of the population did not carry health insurance. The subject of uninsured and underinsured <b>Americans</b> <b>is</b> a major political issue. In 2006, Massachusetts became the first state to mandate universal health insurance. Federal legislation passed in early 2010 would ostensibly create a near-universal health insurance system around the country by 2014, though the bill and its ultimate effect are issues of controversy.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{scholars}} and readers {{have criticized the}} book for what are seen as condescending racist descriptions of the book's black characters, {{especially with regard to}} the characters' appearances, speech, and behavior, as well as the passive nature of Uncle Tom in accepting his fate. The novel's creation and use of common stereotypes about African <b>Americans</b> <b>is</b> significant because Uncle Tom's Cabin was the best-selling novel in the world during the 19th century. As a result, the book (along with illustrations from the book and associated stage productions) {{played a major role in}} permanently ingraining these stereotypes into the American psyche.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Tennessee {{after his}} presidency, Johnson sought {{political}} vindication, and gained {{it in his}} eyes {{when he was elected}} to the Senate again in 1875, making Johnson the only former president to serve in the Senate. He died just months into his term. While some admire Johnson's strict constitutionalism, his strong opposition to federally guaranteed rights for African <b>Americans</b> <b>is</b> widely criticized. He is regarded by many historians as one of the worst presidents in American history.|$|E

5|$|Because if we'd gone to Baghdad {{we would}} have been all alone. There wouldn't have been anybody else with us. There would have been a U.S. {{occupation}} of Iraq. None of the Arab forces that were willing to fight with us in Kuwait were willing to invade Iraq. Once you got to Iraq and took it over, took down Saddam Hussein's government, then {{what are you going to}} put in its place? That's a very volatile part of the world, and if you take down the central government of Iraq, you could very easily end up seeing pieces of Iraq fly off: part of it, the Syrians would like to have to the west, part of it—eastern Iraq—the Iranians would like to claim, they fought over it for eight years. In the north you've got the Kurds, and if the Kurds spin loose and join with the Kurds in Turkey, then you threaten the territorial integrity of Turkey. It's a quagmire if you go that far and try to take over Iraq. The other thing was casualties. Everyone was impressed with the fact we were able to do our job with as few casualties as we had. But for the 146 Americans killed in action, and for their families—it wasn't a cheap war. And the question for the president, in terms of whether or not we went on to Baghdad, took additional casualties in an effort to get Saddam Hussein, was how many additional dead <b>Americans</b> <b>is</b> Saddam worth? Our judgment was, not very many, and I think we got it right.|$|E

25|$|Because of {{the high}} {{frequency}} of American Indian alcoholism, a stereotype {{has been applied to}} all American Indians. As with most groups, the incidence of substance abuse is related to issues of poverty and mental distress, both of which may be, in part, the result of racial stereotyping and discrimination. Treatment for substance abuse by Native <b>Americans</b> <b>is</b> more effective when it is community-based, and addresses the issues of cultural identification.|$|E

25|$|Studies {{have shown}} a true {{association}} between history of chronic kidney disease in first- or second-degree relatives, and risk of disease. In addition, African Americans may have higher serum levels of human leukocyte antigens (HLA).

Lack of nocturnal reduction in blood pressure among groups of African <b>Americans</b> <b>is</b> also offered as an explanation, which lends further credence to a genetic cause of CKD racial disparities.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, African-American {{people have}} shorter life expectancies than their European-American counterparts. For example, white Americans born in 2010 are {{expected}} to live until age 78.9, but black Americans only until age 75.1. This 3.8-year gap, however, is the lowest {{it has been since}} 1975 at the latest. The greatest difference was 7.1 years in 1993. In contrast, Asian-American women live the longest of all ethnic groups in the United States, with a life expectancy of 85.8 years.

25|$|Contemporary {{preparation}} and {{usage of the}} black drink by Native <b>Americans</b> <b>is</b> less well documented. Online recipes for the black drink have been criticized by some Native Americans as potentially dangerous and potentially poisonous due those recipes leaving out key steps. The berries of the yaupon holly are poisonous. Kidney failure is one possible outcome of consuming beverages containing holly leaves. Adam Edwards and Bradley Bennett tested stems, roots, and leaves of the yaupon. They found that the only possible toxic substance was theobromine, an alkaloid, but the amounts of the chemical were so low that a single gram of cocoa contained over 2,255 times more theobromine than yaupon.|$|E
