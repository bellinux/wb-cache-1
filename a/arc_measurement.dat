The very possibility of deducing a single ellipticity for the earth remained questionable. While achieving his goal, Ivory made methodical mistakes which he gradually corrected. His final result, 0. 00333 < e < 0. 00338, compares favorably with the value e = 0. 00335 of the so-called Krasovsky ellipsoid.

40|$|Stellar mass plays {{a central}} role in our {{understanding}} of star formation and aging. Stellar astronomy is largely based on two maps, both dependent on mass, either indirectly or directly: the Hertzprung-Russell Diagram (HRD) and the Mass-Luminosity Relation (MLR). The extremes of both maps, while not terra incognita, are characterized by large uncertainties. A precise HRD requires precise distance obtained by direct measurement of parallax. A precise MLR requires precise measurement of binary orbital parameters, with the ultimate goal the critical test of theoretical stellar models. Such tests require mass accuracies of ~ 1 %. Substantial improvement in both maps requires astrometry with microsecond of <b>arc</b> <b>measurement</b> precision. Why? First, the 'tops' of both stellar maps contain relatively rare objects, for which large populations are not found until the observing horizon reaches hundreds or thousands of parsecs. Second, the 'bottoms' and 'sides' of both maps contain stars, either intrinsically faint, or whose rarity guarantees great distance, hence apparent faintness. With an extensive collection of high accuracy masses that can only be provided by astrometry with microsecond of <b>arc</b> <b>measurement</b> precision, astronomers will be able to stress test theoretical models of stars at any mass and at every stage in their aging processes.

40|$|BACKGROUND Fractures of the {{acetabulum}} occur {{primarily in}} young adults {{as a result}} of high-velocity trauma and in old age even with trivial trauma. Anatomic reduction and stable fixation of the fracture such that the femoral head is concentrically reduced under an adequate portion of the weight bearing dome of the acetabulum is the treatment goal in these difficult fractures. The aim of the study is: 1. To study the outcome after reconstruction of fracture of acetabulum. 2. To study the postoperative complications and failures. MATERIALS AND METHODS The present study was carried out from March 2015 to September 2016 at Orthopaedics Department, Aarupadai Veedu Medical College and Hospital. During this period, 25 patients of acetabular fracture (20 males and 5 females) were managed in our hospital surgically. The indication for surgery in acetabulum fracture was decided according to displacement of fracture and it is decided by measuring the roof <b>arc</b> <b>measurement</b> developed by Matta. If the fracture has been displaced medially or anteriorly or posteriorly to 45 ° or 25 ° or 70 °, then the fracture should be taken for surgery.

Reference values for the aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR) using ARC are still undefined. The objective {{of the present study}} was to determine the threshold of ARR using <b>ARC</b> <b>measurement</b> to screen for primary aldosteronism. Methods: A total of 211 subjects were included in the study, comprising 78 healthy normotensive controls, 95 patients with essential hypertension, and 38 patients with confirmed primary aldosteronism (20 with surgery-confirmed aldosterone-producing adenoma and 18 with idiopathic adrenal hyperplasia). Blood samples were drawn from ambulatory patients and volunteers in the mid-morning without specific dietary restriction for measuring plasma aldosterone concentration, ARC, and serum potassium. Results: Most normotensive controls and essential hypertension patients had ARR results below 100 pmol/ng, a value which corresponded to 3. 3 times the median of these two groups. Conclusion: Patients with ARR values above this level should be considered for further investigation (confirmatory tests) or for repeat testing should ARR values be borderline. This study indicates that ARC can be used reliably in determining ARR for primary aldosteronism screening.

40|$|The {{history of}} the study of Polar Motion began with the {{derivation}} of the equations for the rotation of a rigid body by Euler published in 1758. This was followed by further theoretical contributions made by Lagrange (1788) and Poinsot (1834). To confirm the existence of the polar motion of the Earth in terms of a variation of latitude, intensive efforts were undertaken at several observatories {{toward the end of the}} 19 th century. During the 7 th General Conference of the European <b>Arc</b> <b>Measurement</b> in Rome in October 1883, Fergola had already suggested to investigate the problem. The latitude variation was detected by Kuestner at the Berlin Observatory in 1888. Following this, during the Annual Conference of the Permanent Commission of the 'Internationale Erdmessung' in Salzburg in September 1888, Foerster proposed to consider the variation of latitude more systematically by a Special Commission. Activities began quickly, and after considerable effort the International Latitude Service (ILS) started in September 1899.
