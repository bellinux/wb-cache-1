5|$|Athletes {{train to}} achieve endurance, strength, speed, skill and {{flexibility}} {{at different levels}} of intensity. Offseason training often occurs on dry land, sometimes on roller skis.

40|$|Introduction: Previous {{research}} has stereotyped many overhead athletes as baseball pitchers. Due {{to the different}} physiological stresses in each overhead sport, {{it may not be}} appropriate to group all overhead athletes together. The objective {{of this study was to}} show sport specific physical adaptations in common overhead sports. Methods: Forty-three healthy, male athletes participated in this cross-sectional study; fifteen baseball pitchers, fifteen volleyball athletes, thirteen tennis athletes and fifteen control athletes. Internal rotation (IR) and external rotation (ER) shoulder range of motion (ROM), glenohumeral internal rotation deficit (GIRD), external rotation gain (ERG), posterior shoulder tightness (PST) (supine and side-lying methods), shoulder strength and scapular kinematics were assessed in a neuromuscular research laboratory. ROM was assessed with a goniometer while PST was assessed with a goniometer (supine) and carpenters' square (side-lying). Strength was assessed with an isokinetic dynamometer and scapular kinematics with an electromagnetic tracking device. Results: Pitchers had more dominant IR ROM than tennis athletes and less dominant IR ROM than control <b>athletes.</b> Tennis <b>athletes</b> <b>had</b> the lowest IR ROM of all groups included in this study. Volleyball <b>athletes</b> <b>had</b> less dominant IR ROM than control athletes. Pitchers and tennis <b>athletes</b> <b>had</b> more GIRD than control <b>athletes</b> <b>had.</b> Pitchers and tennis <b>athletes</b> <b>had</b> higher between limb differences with the supine method of assessing PST. With the supine assessment, tennis <b>athletes</b> <b>had</b> increased dominant PST compared to control athletes; additionally, all overhead <b>athletes</b> <b>had</b> decreased non-dominant PST. At 90 ° and 120 ° humeral elevation, pitchers had the most scapular elevation, volleyball <b>athletes</b> <b>had</b> more elevation than tennis athletes did, and tennis <b>athletes</b> <b>had</b> less elevation than control athletes did. There were no differences in external rotation ROM, total rotation ROM, or strength measures. Conclusion: Not all overhead <b>athletes</b> <b>had</b> the same physical characteristics. The differences between sports in each of the variables could be due to the different amount of physiologic stress on the shoulder in each sport. These results may help to show healthy, sport specific adaptations in each sport. Clinicians should develop sport specific rehabilitation protocols and return to play criteria for athletes to return to play earlier and stronger...|$|R

5|$|Liechtenstein competed at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 5 to 21 August 2016. Since the nation's {{official}} {{debut in}} 1936, Liechtensteinian <b>athletes</b> <b>have</b> appeared in every {{edition of the}} Summer Olympic Games, except for two occasions. Liechtenstein did not register any athletes at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, and eventually joined the United States-led boycott when Moscow hosted the 1980 Summer Olympics. The 2016 delegation included two swimmers, Christoph Meier and Julia Hassler, and tennis player Stephanie Vogt. Two of the athletes debuted in the London 2012 Games, with long-distance freestyle swimmer Julia Hassler leading the squad as the nation's flag bearer in the opening ceremony. Liechtenstein has yet to win a Summer Olympic medal.|$|E
5|$|Runners {{start the}} race from a {{standing}} position along a curved starting line and after hearing the starter's pistol they head towards the innermost track to follow the quickest route to the finish. In 800m races athletes begin at a staggered starting point before the turn in the track and they must remain in their lanes for the first 100m of the race. This rule was introduced {{to reduce the amount}} of physical jostling between runners in the early stages of the race. Physiologically, these middle-distance events demand that <b>athletes</b> <b>have</b> good aerobic and anaerobic energy producing systems, and also that they have strong speed endurance.|$|E
50|$|Other rule changes {{included}} a 'no false start rule' {{in all the}} track events. (Any athlete false starting would have been immediately disqualified and received no points, but this did not occur at the inaugural championships). Athletes in the high jump and pole vault events were permitted a maximum total of four fouls throughout the day's competition. Also, the jumping and throwing events featured elimination rounds: <b>athletes</b> <b>had</b> two trial attempts, then the six best-ranked <b>athletes</b> <b>had</b> a third attempt, then finally the top four <b>athletes</b> <b>had</b> a fourth attempt. The elimination rounds caused some upsets, with highly rated Russian hammer thrower, Aleksey Zagornyi failing to progress beyond the trial rounds.|$|R
