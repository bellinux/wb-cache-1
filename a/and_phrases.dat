5|$|Both {{the frames}} and {{pictorial}} {{areas of the}} diptych are heavily inscribed with lettering <b>and</b> <b>phrases</b> in Latin, Greek and Hebrew. Van Eyck's early works display a predilection for inscriptions, which serve a dual purpose.

Diptychs were usually commissioned for private devotion, and van Eyck would have expected the viewer to contemplate text and imagery in unison.|$|E

5|$|Devadasu was {{released}} on 26June 1953, and the Tamil version {{was released}} three months later, on 11September 1953. Both versions were critically and commercially successful. It has since achieved cult status, with terms <b>and</b> <b>phrases</b> from the film being widely cited. Both versions {{proved to be a}} major breakthrough in Nageswara Rao's career, although they also led to him being typecast in similar roles.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi also campaigned hard {{going from}} one rural corner of the Indian subcontinent to another.

These ideas sounded strange outside India, during his lifetime, but they readily and deeply resonated with the culture and historic values of his people.|$|E

5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{took place}} in and around Madras (now Chennai) and wrapped in December 1954. Missamma was released on 12 January 1955, two days before Missiamma theatrical debut. Both versions were commercially successful, completing 100-day theatrical runs. The bilingual film brought recognition to its cast and studio, and words <b>and</b> <b>phrases</b> from Missamma became part of Telugu vernacular. AVM Productions remade the film in Hindi as Miss Mary in 1957, Prasad's Bollywood directorial debut. Bapu, Mullapudi Venkata Ramana and Raavi Kondala Rao rewrote and adapted Missamma as Pelli Pustakam in 1991.|$|E

5|$|The {{rules by}} which signs can be {{combined}} to form words <b>and</b> <b>phrases</b> are called syntax or grammar. The meaning that is connected to individual signs, morphemes, words, phrases, and texts is called semantics.

40|$|The {{factor of}} failure in Arabic {{language}} learning in Indonesia {{is the lack}} of activities in language learning. One of language learning activities is identifying meaning or word meaning <b>and</b> <b>phrase</b> in dictionary. However, word <b>and</b> <b>phrase</b> index developed based on teaching materials at madrasah non-pesantren was not developed yet. Therefore, Research and Development is needed to apply. After having collected the word <b>and</b> <b>phrase</b> index that were collected from teaching materials of Arabic language at MI non-pesantren in Indonesia, then it was tested at MIN Malang. The result showed that: there was a development in Arabic language learning through word <b>and</b> <b>phrase</b> index; that was students’ competence to identify meaning and collaboration in understanding text and context in a sentence. After having applied the experiment, students’ average score increased from 52 with 19 failed students to 81, 26 with 5 failed students. DOI: 10. 24865 /ajas. v 1 i 2. ...|$|R

5|$|The various musical themes {{associated}} with the Rhinemaidens are regarded as among the most lyrical in the entire Ring cycle, bringing to it rare instances of comparative relaxation and charm. The music contains important melodies <b>and</b> <b>phrases</b> which are reprised and developed elsewhere in the operas to characterise other individuals and circumstances, and to relate plot developments {{to the source of}} the narrative. It is reported that Wagner played the Rhinemaidens' lament at the piano, on the night before he died in Venice, in 1883.|$|E
5|$|Based in Yokohama, Farsari {{formed a}} {{partnership}} with E. A. Sargent. Their firm, Sargent, Farsari & Co., dealt in smokers' supplies, stationery, visiting cards, newspapers, magazines and novels, Japanese and English conversation books, dictionaries, guidebooks, maps, and photographic views of Japan. The creator of these photographs remains unknown, but Farsari was the maker of {{at least some of}} the maps, notably of Miyanoshita (in the Hakone resort area) and Yokohama. After his partnership with Sargent ended, the company, now A. Farsari & Co., published successive editions of Keeling's Guide to Japan and Farsari himself wrote and published Japanese Words <b>and</b> <b>Phrases</b> for the Use of Strangers. The firm was among the most prolific publishers of materials to aid travellers, having produced its first guidebook to Japan by July 1880.|$|E
5|$|Caregivers use {{language}} {{to help children}} become competent members of society and culture. From birth, infants receive pragmatic information. They learn structure of conversations from early interactions with caregivers. Actions and speech are organized in games, such as peekaboo to provide children with information about words <b>and</b> <b>phrases.</b> Caregivers find many ways to help infants interact and respond. As children advance and participate more actively in interactions, caregivers adapt their interactions accordingly. Caregivers also prompt children to produce correct pragmatic behaviours. They provide input about what children are expected to say, how to speak, when they should speak, {{and how they can}} stay on topic. Caregivers may model the appropriate behaviour, using verbal reinforcement, posing a hypothetical situation, addressing children's comments, or evaluating another person.|$|E

5|$|French and Spanish {{language}} teachers {{assisted with}} {{development of the}} gameplay for both games, which concentrates on teaching French or Spanish using lessons and minigames. As the player progresses the lessons, the gameplay uses increasingly complex words <b>and</b> <b>phrases.</b> The games received praise and criticism from various video game publications; they praised the games' effectiveness in teaching the language, but lamented their repetitive nature. The next installments in the series, titled My French Coach Level 2: Intermediate and My Spanish Coach Level 2: Intermediate, also developed and published by Ubisoft, were released in Europe on November 23, 2007 alongside their Level 1 counterparts.|$|E
5|$|Jefferson's most {{immediate}} sources were two documents written in June 1776: his own {{draft of the}} preamble of the Constitution of Virginia, and George Mason's draft of the Virginia Declaration of Rights. Ideas <b>and</b> <b>phrases</b> from both of these documents appear in the Declaration of Independence. They were, in turn, directly influenced by the 1689 English Declaration of Rights, which formally ended the reign of King JamesII. During the American Revolution, Jefferson and other Americans looked to the English Declaration of Rights {{as a model of}} how to end the reign of an unjust king. The Scottish Declaration of Arbroath (1320) and the Dutch Act of Abjuration (1581) have also been offered as models for Jefferson's Declaration, but these models are now accepted by few scholars.|$|E
5|$|Syntax {{refers to}} {{patterns}} for combining words <b>and</b> <b>phrases</b> to make clauses and sentences. Verbal and nominal inflectional morphology {{are central to}} Ottawa syntax, as they mark grammatical information on verbs and nouns {{to a greater extent}} than in English (which has few inflections, and relies mainly on word order). Preferred word orders in a simple transitive sentence are verb-initial, such as verb–object–subject (VOS) and VSO. While verb-final orders are avoided, all logically possible orders are attested. Ottawa word order displays considerably more freedom than is found in languages such as English, and word order frequently reflects discourse-based distinctions such as topic and focus.|$|E

5|$|The {{specific}} {{access method}} {{will depend on}} the skills and abilities of the user. With direct selection a body part, pointer, adapted mouse, joystick, or eye tracking could be used, whereas switch access scanning is often used for indirect selection. Unlike direct selection (e.g., typing on a keyboard, touching a screen), users of Target Scanning can only make selections when the scanning indicator (or cursor) of the electronic device is on the desired choice. Those who are unable to point typically calibrate their eyes to use eye gaze as a way to point and blocking as a way to select desired words <b>and</b> <b>phrases.</b> The speed and pattern of scanning, as well as the way items are selected, are individualized to the physical, visual and cognitive capabilities of the user.|$|E
5|$|When {{described}} as a system of symbolic communication, language is traditionally seen as consisting of three parts: signs, meanings, and a code connecting signs with their meanings. The study {{of the process of}} semiosis, how signs and meanings are combined, used, and interpreted is called semiotics. Signs can be composed of sounds, gestures, letters, or symbols, depending on whether the language is spoken, signed, or written, and they can be combined into complex signs, such as words <b>and</b> <b>phrases.</b> When used in communication, a sign is encoded and transmitted by a sender through a channel to a receiver who decodes it.|$|E
5|$|Wobble, shimmy, tank-slapper, speed wobble, {{and death}} wobble are all words <b>and</b> <b>phrases</b> used to {{describe}} a rapid (410Hz) oscillation of primarily just the front end (front wheel, fork, and handlebars). Also involved is the yawing of the rear frame which {{may contribute to the}} wobble when too flexible. This instability occurs mostly at high speed and is similar to that experienced by shopping cart wheels, airplane landing gear, and automobile front wheels. While wobble or shimmy can be easily remedied by adjusting speed, position, or grip on the handlebar, it can be fatal if left uncontrolled.|$|E
