5|$|Barley's {{relationship}} with Morley was short-lived. By 1600, Morley {{had turned to}} East as his assignee, authorising him to print under his name for three years. Two years later, Morley died, and his music patent fell into abeyance. Unable {{to rely on the}} protections and privileges of Morley's monopoly, Barley most likely came under increasing pressure from the Stationers' Company. His financial circumstances also deteriorated after he was the target of a successful lawsuit by <b>a</b> <b>cook</b> named George Goodale, who was seeking payment of a debt of 80 pounds. As a result of the suit, many of Barley's goods were seized, including various books and reams of paper. Barley greatly reduced his output from 1601 to 1605, publishing only six works.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{the assumed}} role of these jamaat members cycle {{in a way}} that they may be engaged as a preacher, <b>a</b> <b>cook</b> or as a cleaner at other times. Among Tabligh Jamaat members, this is {{generally}} referred to as khidmat which essentially connotes to serving their companions and freeing them for tablighi engagements. The members of the Jamaat are assigned these roles based on the day's mashwara. The markaz keeps records of each jamaat and its members, the identity of whom is verified from their respective mosques. Mosques are used to assist the tablighi activities of individual jamaats that voluntarily undertake preaching missions. Members of a jamaat, ideally, pay expenses themselves so as to avoid financial dependence on anyone.|$|E
