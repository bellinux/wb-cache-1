To successfully achieve this transition, a fully-functional fuel cell automatic stack <b>assembly</b> robotic <b>station</b> is being developed. This document outlines both iterations of the robotic fuel cell <b>assembly</b> <b>stations,</b> other work to date, DFM and DFA lessons learned, and the anticipated future progression of automatic fuel cell stack <b>assembly</b> <b>stations.</b> Two individual robotic fuel cell <b>assembly</b> <b>stations</b> were constructed, including custom-built end effectors and parts feeders. The second station incorporated numerous improvements, including overlapping work envelopes, elimination of a shuttle cart, software synchronization, fewer axes, and a better end effector. Consequentially, the second workcell achieved a four-fold improvement in cycle time over the previous iteration. Future improvements will focus in part upon improving the reliability of the overall system. As the stack assembly workcell continues to improve, research will focus upon the ramifications and interplay of tolerances, stack failure modes, sealing, reliability, and the potential for component redesign specifically to optimize fuel cell manufacturing throughput...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{significant}} challenges in operating a mix-model assembly system is the feeding of parts to the productive units. In order to avoid production loss, assembly systems require uninterrupted availability of components to feed workstations. On the other hand, the feeding of assembly components has to be performed {{in a way that}} minimises the related costs. In the past, the feeding system most widely used was so-called 'line storage' in which the components were stored along the <b>assembly</b> <b>stations</b> in large quantities and were periodically refilled by the central warehouse. Following just-in-time principles, nowadays, assembly system feeding is undertaken by supermarkets, as in decentralised storage areas close to the assembly lines. From such kinds of warehousing, a growing number of manufacturers are adopting two other feeding strategies: the kanban system, which continuously refills the <b>assembly</b> <b>stations</b> through the pull kanban system, or the kitting system, in which kits of components are prepared and delivered following the product through the <b>assembly</b> <b>stations.</b> This paper aims to quantitatively analyse and compare these two recent feeding strategies, considering the production mix variation and the assembled models variety influence. Moreover, kanban-kitting feeding policy and the related optimization issues are considered as hybrid. The findings from an industrial case study and a simulation analysis are also reported. Finally, a decision-making tool that defines a series of 'convenience areas' for the different feeding policies is provide...|$|R

40|$|Following {{just-in-time}} principles, {{a growing}} number of manufacturers are adopting the so-called supermarket concept. Supermarkets are decentralised storage areas scattered throughout the shopfloor that serve as an intermediate store for parts required by nearby assembly lines. From these stores, a certain number of handling operators deliver parts from the supermarket to, and collect empty bins from, <b>assembly</b> <b>stations.</b> Finally, they return to the supermarket and are refilled for their next tours. The <b>assembly</b> <b>stations</b> in such supermarket/multiple mixed-model assembly line systems are typically refilled through the constant replacement of the consumed parts pulled by the kanban system. The aims of this paper are (i) to highlight how the supermarket/multi-mixed assembly line system presents specific attributes that prohibit the simple application of well-known kanban dimensioning formulations and (ii) to provide an innovative procedure to optimally set all decision variables related to such a feeding system...|$|R
40|$|This paper proposes the {{application}} of computer simulation methods in order to analyse the availability of resources, buffers {{and the impact of}} the allocation of workers on the throughput and work-in-progress of a manufacturing system. The simulation model of the production system is based on an existing example of a manufacturing company in the automotive industry. The manufacturing system includes both machining and assembly operations. Simulation experiments were conducted vis-à-vis the availability of the different manufacturing resources, the various allocations of buffer capacities and the number of employees. The production system consists of three manufacturing cells – each cell including two CNC machines – and two <b>assembly</b> <b>stations.</b> The parts produced by the manufacturing cells are stored in buffers and transferred to the <b>assembly</b> <b>stations.</b> Workers are allocated to the manufacturing cells and <b>assembly</b> <b>stations,</b> but the number of workers may be less than number of workplaces and are thus termed ‘multi-workstations’. Using computer simulation methods, the impact of the availability of resources, the number of employees and of the allocation of buffer capacity on the throughput and work-in-progress of the manufacturing system is analysed. The results of the research are used to improve the effectiveness of manufacturing systems using a decision support system and the proper control of resources. Literature analysis shows that the study of the impact of buffer capacities, availability of resources and the number of employees on assembly manufacturing system performance have not been carried out so far...|$|R

40|$|Paced or Synchronous {{assembly}} lines are a popular class of assembly systems {{consisting of a}} series of <b>assembly</b> <b>stations</b> arranged in tandem. Every job (or order) visits all <b>assembly</b> <b>stations</b> in the same sequence and spends {{the same amount of time}} (known as the production cycle) at each station. Industries such as aircraft, fire-engine, and automobile assembly have production cycles of a few hours and are labor intensive. In spite of increased automation in such industries, human capital remains the most expensive and important contributor to a flexible production system. In this article we formulate the cross-training problem on a paced assembly line with m stations (mCT). We assume that each worker possesses a number of skills referred to as a skill vector. Our objective is to schedule a set of work orders through the assembly system so as to minimize the size of the required workforce and/or the workforce cross-training costs. We analyze the complexity of mCT and identify polynomially solvable cases. A variety of lower bounds is developed based on optimization techniques. These lower bounds are used to develop a branch and bound algorithm as well as to evaluate our heuristics. A computational experiment reports the performance of all algorithms. Using these algorithms, we examine how the formation of skill vectors affects the workforce size and draw guidelines for cross-training programs in organizations with labor intensive assembly operations.
