5|$|Little Gidding is {{the fourth}} and final poem of T. S. Eliot's Four Quartets, a series of poems that discuss time, perspective, humanity, <b>and</b> <b>salvation.</b> It was first {{published}} in September 1942 after being delayed for over a year because of the air-raids on Great Britain during World War II and Eliot's declining health. The title refers to a small Anglican community in Huntingdonshire, established by Nicholas Ferrar in the 17th century and scattered during the English Civil War.|$|E
5|$|The central {{discussion}} {{within the}} poem is {{on the nature of}} time <b>and</b> <b>salvation.</b> Eliot emphasises the need of the individual to focus on the present moment and to {{know that there is a}} universal order. By understanding the nature of time and the order of the universe, mankind is able to recognise God and seek redemption. Many reviewers of Burnt Norton focused on the uniqueness and beauty of the poem. However, others complained that the poem does not reflect Eliot's earlier greatness and that the use of Christian themes harmed the poem.|$|E

5|$|The {{purpose of}} {{marriage}} in the Bahá'i faith is mainly to foster spiritual harmony, fellowship and unity {{between a man and}} a woman and to provide a stable and loving environment for the rearing of children. The Bahá'í teachings on marriage call it a fortress for well-being <b>and</b> <b>salvation</b> and place marriage and the family as the foundation of the structure of human society. Bahá'u'lláh highly praised marriage, discouraged divorce, and required chastity outside of marriage; Bahá'u'lláh taught that a husband and wife should strive to improve the spiritual life of each other. Interracial marriage is also highly praised throughout Bahá'í scripture.|$|E

25|$|Theology in the Flesh {{shows that}} biblical writers used {{a wide array}} of metaphors to {{understand}} topics such as sin, <b>salvation,</b> <b>and</b> God. <b>Salvation,</b> for example, is thought of in terms of release from slavery, as friendship with God, as healing, as returning from the dead, and as finding your way home to list but a few. No single metaphor says everything that we can say about <b>salvation</b> <b>and</b> so multiple metaphors are needed. There are often several legitimate ways, within constraints, for Christians to understand a topic. The book provides lots of examples of how different Christian communities, over time and across cultures, use different metaphors for <b>salvation</b> <b>and</b> so arrive at conflicting theological positions.|$|R
