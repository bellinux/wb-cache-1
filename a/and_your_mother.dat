And therefore you should not hide from me your debts whatsoever it be ... send me word in any wise of the whole sum of your debts, for I <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> will see them forthwith paid and whatsoever you do spend in the honest service of our master and for his honour, so you do not let wild and wanton men consume it, as I have been served in my days, you must think all is spent as it should be, and all that I have must be yours ...

500|$|Soegija and the {{students}} continued their education at Xaverius, receiving further instruction. According to Father G. Budi Subanar, a lecturer on theology at Sanata Dharma University, during this period one of the teachers taught the Fourth Commandment, [...] "Honour your father <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother,</b> that your days may be long in the land which the Lord your God gives you.", as relating not only to one's birth father and mother, but all who had come before; this left {{the students}} with nationalistic tendencies. On another occasion, a visit by a Capuchin missionary– who was physically {{quite different from the}} Jesuit teachers– led Soegija to consider becoming a priest, an idea which his parents accepted. In 1915 Soegija finished his education at Xaverius, but stayed on as a teacher. The following year he joined the on-site seminary, one of three native Indonesians who entered the seminary that year. He graduated in 1919, having studied French, Latin, Greek, and literature.|$|E
500|$|Just {{like the}} text—which was mostly written {{on top of}} {{photographs}}—the photographs on the book are highly sexual and depict nudity, [...] simulations of sexual acts, bondage, homosexuality and analingus, with accessories such as knives, whips, masks and chains; however, full intercourse is never shown. Aside from unknown models, featured in the book are actress Isabella Rossellini, rappers Big Daddy Kane and Madonna's then boyfriend Vanilla Ice, model Naomi Campbell, gay porn star Joey Stefano, actor Udo Kier, socialite Tatiana von Fürstenberg, and nightclub owner Ingrid Casares; however the heterosexual photos in the book involve only Madonna and Vanilla Ice. Madonna herself is featured partially or completely naked. One of the book's most famous photographs shows Madonna hitchhiking completely naked in Miami. The book also reflects a great part on Dita's perspective towards her own sexuality. Dita writes in Sex that her [...] "pussy" [...] is a temple of learning and that exposing it, is really a homage to it ("It's hard to describe it smells like a baby to me fresh and full of life. I love my pussy, it is the complete summation of my life"). Sex contains statements like [...] "ass fucking is the most pleasurable way to get fucked and it hurts the most too". Others include [...] "here is something comforting about being tied up. Like {{when you were a}} baby <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> strapped you in the car seat. She wanted you to be safe. It was an act of love" [...] and [...] "I wouldn't want a penis. It would be like having a third leg. it seems like a contraption that would get in the way. I think I have a dick in my brain". In Sex, Dita also pointed out that [...] "A lot of people are afraid to say what they want. That's why they don't get what they want". The book includes Madonna's perspective on pornography: ...|$|E

2500|$|Noting that in [...] Jacob asked Joseph, [...] "Shall I <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> [...] [...] [...] indeed come," [...] when Joseph's mother Rachel {{was then}} dead, Rabbi Levi {{said in the}} name of Rabbi Hama ben Haninah that Jacob {{believed}} that resurrection would take place in his days. But Rabbi Levi taught that Jacob did not know that Joseph's dream in fact applied to Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid, who had brought Joseph up like a mother.|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{was in the}} {{greatest}} affliction {{at the loss of}} my son, and was consumed by a desire to know what was his position in the other world. God deigned to comfort me. About a month after his death, during a very restless night, I saw, as it were, the ceiling opened, and Dominic appeared in the midst of dazzling light. I was beside myself at this sight, and cried out: [...] "O Dominic, my son, are you already in Paradise?" [...] "Yes," [...] he replied, [...] "I am in Heaven." [...] Then pray for your brothers and sisters, <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> and father, that we may all come to join you one day in Heaven."
