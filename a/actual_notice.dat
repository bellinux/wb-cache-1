25|$|Although {{for years}} {{it had been}} {{supposed}} that it was sufficient for the first mortgagee to have either actual or constructive notice of the second mortgage, in Westpac Banking Corporation v Adelaide Bank Limited it was held that constructive notice was not sufficient, and that a first mortgagee could tack future advances unless it had <b>actual</b> <b>notice</b> of the second ranking security.|$|E
25|$|The Court {{had last}} {{addressed}} the issue of notice in Dusenbery v. United States, , which held that the government need only take steps reasonably calculated to provide notice even if <b>actual</b> <b>notice</b> is not achieved. The four justices who dissented in Dusenbery now formed the majority with Roberts in Jones v. Flowers, distinguishing the prior case on the basis that the government in Dusenbery did not know that its method of notice had failed before the taking occurred. Justice Clarence Thomas, in dissent, believed the Court was instead undermining Dusenbery, which he argued implicitly dictated a result contrary to the majority's decision.|$|E

50|$|A {{dismissal}} may be lawful or wrongful (insufficient notice) at common law. It {{may or may}} {{not involve}} discrimination under statute.

Accordingly, discrimination, wrongful dismissal and constructive dismissal are best dealt with separately. This article addresses the statutory concept of fairness.|$|R

2500|$|Thomas {{believed}} the Court's holding in Dusenbery that <b>actual</b> <b>notice</b> {{is not required}} implied {{that the government is}} not required to take additional steps when it becomes aware that its attempt at notice has failed. He accordingly characterized the Court's ruling as [...] "little more than a thinly veiled attack on Dusenbery." [...] Thomas stated that the majority's logic would require a State to consider additional means every time a doubt is raised as to whether notice has been achieved, imposing a requirement with [...] "no natural end point" [...] that Thomas thought effectively required [...] "something close to actual notice." ...|$|E

"We {{appreciate}} {{the county of}} Los Angeles giving the Yes on S campaign some last-minute critical media attention, on our key issue: that developers of luxury towers evict poor and working-class Angelenos every day," [...] Stewart responded. A leader of one tenant group, the Eviction Defense Network, agreed, calling the tactic [...] "forceful". Stewart further speculated that the sheriff might have been acting {{at the behest of}} opponents of Measure S, since they had used the same political consulting firm. Later the CPLA refused to retract the mailer, calling it protected political speech, and expressing doubt that anyone could seriously have assumed it was an <b>actual</b> eviction <b>notice.</b>|$|R

2500|$|The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution {{requires}} a State {{to provide an}} owner with notice {{and an opportunity to}} be heard before it may take his property and sell it for unpaid taxes. The Court had recently ruled in Dusenbery v. United States, [...] that the government did not violate due process by sending notice to the jail where the property owner was imprisoned and allowing a prison official to sign for it, even though the prisoner never actually received the notice. Dusenbery established that due process did not require <b>actual</b> <b>notice</b> prior to a governmental taking of property, but instead only that the government attempt to give notice by a method [...] "reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances," [...] to inform all interested parties.|$|E
2500|$|Class {{members in}} Rule 23 {{certified}} classes are, generally, subject to an opt-out mechanism, {{meaning that they}} (once the class definition is certified) are participants in the matter unless they opt-out (i.e., affirmatively exclude themselves therefrom). This procedure is followed, and class members are bound, {{regardless of whether they}} received <b>actual</b> <b>notice,</b> so long as the notice issued met the requisite due process requirements. Conversely, some types of class actions or so-called [...] "collective actions" [...] (e.g., actions to enforce the federal Fair Labor Standards Act or the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967) are opt-in actions brought pursuant to 29 U.S.C. §216(b) (see, also 29 U.S.C. § 626(b)). In such [...] "216b" [...] actions, class members are not bound by the results of the collective action, and their claims are not tolled during the pendency thereof, until they opt-in by filing a Consent to join the litigation. Due to the tenuous rights of class members in collective actions prior to opt-in, certification in such actions is subject to a much lower standard.|$|E

30|$|This set of {{experiments}} represents {{a set of}} scenarios [21], {{in the sense that}} each experiment has its specific features and allows for the analysis of relevant working conditions that can be encountered in <b>actual</b> networks. <b>Notice</b> however that the use of scenarios in this context is not for the evaluation and development of alternative solutions (a technique often used in multiattribute models, as extensively analyzed in [21]), but rather to explore the different possibilities that may arise in the routing context, having in mind to test the robustness and effectiveness (in terms of performance) of the solution selection procedure. This is achieved by considering scenarios of implementation of static and dynamic versions of the model and the consideration of three situations of load/overload conditions.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to provide a {{scholarly}} analysis of mass media notice in federal Rule 23 (b) (3) class actions, the most prevalent form of class action in the federal courts today. The research question is how can contemporary advertising media planning theories, methods and data be utilized to evaluate and implement mass media notice plans in compliance with the requirements of constitutional due process and applicable civil rule provisions? The goal is to propose a normative framework that federal trial courts might utilize when evaluating for approval the mass media component of class action notice plans, specifically paid advertising. The approach is demonstrated by applying state-of-the-art advertising media planning data and procedures to an <b>actual</b> court-ordered <b>notice</b> plan. Implications are drawn for standards of constitutional due process and federal Rule 23, which requires the “best notice practical under the circumstances. ...|$|R
