5|$|A minor Army-Air Force fight {{then broke}} out about what targets {{would be used}} for the Kwajalein tests. The Army favored using its Jupiter design, fired from Johnston Atoll in the Pacific, while the Air Force {{recommended}} using Atlas fired from Vandenberg AFB in California. The Army had already begun converting the former Thor launchers to Jupiter when an Ad Hoc Panel formed by the Department of Defense considered the issue. On 26 May 1960 they decided in favor of Atlas, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> made official on 29 June when the Secretary of Defense ended pad conversion and additional Jupiter production earmarked for Zeus testing.|$|E

5|$|A.× cunninghamii (Albany Woollybush), {{a hybrid}} between A.cuneatus and A.sericeus, was first {{collected}} in 1827, and published as A.cunninghamii in 1845. Other than some dubious collections in the 1830s and 1840s, no further sightings {{are known to}} have been made until 1973, when Nelson rediscovered it. At the time it was regarded as a distinct species, but by 1995 it was thought to be a hybrid, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> confirmed by genetic analysis in 2002. In appearance it is very similar to A.sericeus, but its leaf segments are flat rather than cylindrical.|$|E

5|$|Alex George {{published}} a new taxonomic arrangement of Banksia in his 1981 monograph The genus Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae). Endlicher's Eubanksia became B.subg. Banksia, and {{was divided into}} three sections. B.serrata was placed in B.sect. Banksia, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> further divided into nine series, placing B.serrata in B.ser.

5|$|Anti-Napoleonic {{sentiment}} {{was high}} in Southern France, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> prominently {{displayed in the}} White Terror, which saw the purge of all important Napoleonic officials from government and the execution of others. The people of France committed barbarous acts against some of these officials. Guillaume Marie Anne Brune (a Napoleonic marshal) was savagely assassinated, and his remains thrown into the Rhône River. Louis XVIII deplored such illegal acts, but vehemently supported the prosecution of those marshals that helped Napoleon in the Hundred Days. Louis XVIII's government executed Napoleon's Marshal Ney in December 1815 for treason. His confidants Charles François, Marquis de Bonnay, and the Duke de La Chatre advised him to inflict firm punishments on the “traitors”.|$|E
5|$|Antonio Banderas was {{the first}} actor to secure {{a role in the}} film.

Before he left the project, Stone had considered casting Michelle Pfeiffer in the lead role of Eva, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> confirmed in July 1994. Pfeiffer left the production when she became pregnant with her second child. Parker also considered Glenn Close, along with Streep, to play Eva.|$|E

5|$|As England had {{a strong}} batting lineup, Bradman wanted a large range of {{specialist}} bowlers in the Tests, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> made possible as his preferred bowlers were skillful with the bat. Australia's bowling line-up consisted of Miller, McCool (leg spin), Johnson (off spin), Lindwall, George Tribe (both left arm orthodox and unorthodox) and Toshack. The only deviations were Lindwall missing one Test due to chickenpox, and leg spinner Dooland replacing left-arm spinner Tribe in two Tests.|$|E

5|$|As a child, Modi {{helped his}} father sell tea at the Vadnagar railway station, and later ran a tea stall {{with his brother}} near a bus terminus. Modi {{completed}} his higher secondary education in Vadnagar in 1967, where a teacher described him as an average student and a keen debater, {{with an interest in}} theatre. Modi had an early gift for rhetoric in debates, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> noted by his teachers and students. Modi preferred playing larger-than-life characters in theatrical productions, which has influenced his political image.|$|E
5|$|Based {{on current}} fossil {{evidence}} from dinosaurs such as Oryctodromeus, some ornithischian species {{seem to have}} led a partially fossorial (burrowing) lifestyle. Many modern birds are arboreal (tree climbing), <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> also true of many Mesozoic birds, especially the enantiornithines. While some early bird-like species may have already been arboreal as well (including dromaeosaurids such as Microraptor) most non-avialan dinosaurs seem to have relied on land-based locomotion. A good understanding of how dinosaurs moved {{on the ground is}} key to models of dinosaur behavior; the science of biomechanics, pioneered by Robert McNeill Alexander, has provided significant insight in this area. For example, studies of the forces exerted by muscles and gravity on dinosaurs' skeletal structure have investigated how fast dinosaurs could run, whether diplodocids could create sonic booms via whip-like tail snapping, and whether sauropods could float.|$|E
5|$|Because amateur botany {{was popular}} in Britain {{during the second}} half of the eighteenth century, The Botanic Garden, despite its initial high cost, was a bestseller. In 1799 it was in a fourth edition as The Botanic Garden; A Poem in Two Parts at a smaller and more {{affordable}} octavo size, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> another best-seller. There were three early Irish editions, and a second American edition had appeared by 1807. Despite the huge demand in 1799 and into the early 1800s, and cheaper pirated American and Irish imports, there was room in the market for another edition in Britain 1824 with a reprinting in 1825.|$|E

5|$|Branham {{became more}} {{controversial}} {{in his later}} years <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> particularly evident in his development of a theology that emphasized a few select doctrines. His theology seemed complicated and bizarre to many people who admired him personally. Although not always consistent with each other, his primary concerns were eschatology, the denial of an eternal hell, Oneness Pentecostalism, predestination, eternal security and the serpent's seed. Branham asserted that his doctrinal teachings were given to him by divine revelation.|$|E
5|$|Brunner {{retired in}} 1869 at the {{relatively}} young age of 46. He remained {{employed by the}} Nelson Provincial Council as a consultant surveyor and was also head of the Nelson Survey Department.

He also continued to seek private work and contributed to a report on the suitability of the Buller region for settlement <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> published in early 1873. On his retirement in 1869 he had retained his offices of sheriff, returning officer and registration officer but was relieved of these in 1872 in cost-cutting measures by the Nelson Provincial Council. This did not meet with the approval of locals.|$|E
