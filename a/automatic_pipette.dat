30|$|The {{outline of}} the gas {{preparation}} system is shown in Figure  1 b. All pipe line is made from internally polished stainless steel. In order to purify argon from the extracted gases, three SORB-AC getter pumps (NP 10) are used.

40|$|Aim: To {{investigate}} if free PSA (fPSA) {{and total}} PSA (tPSA) values obtained from simultaneously collected urine, fresh and dried on filter paper, reflect the serum free and total PSA. Materials and Methods : The sera and 20 cc first voided urine from 33 consecutive men aged between 40 and 84 (mean 61 ± 12), {{were collected in}} the morning and delivered to the laboratory. Three different aliquots of 100 microgram urine were taken with <b>automatic</b> <b>pipette</b> and dropped on 3 certain areas of a filter paper and allowed to dry for each patient. On each paper, borders of dried urine were marked. PSA values were obtained from the sera and fresh urine samples and recorded. Later on particular days dried urine samples were dissolved and eventually PSA values were derived and recorded again. The results were compared to each other. Correlations were evaluated by using an SPSS statistics program. Results: Serum PSA values correlated weakly (r 0. 75) among PSA values of dried urine samples of 1 -day, 7 - and 28 -days, were seen. Conclusions : We conclude that PSA values obtained from fresh and dried urine could not reflect serum PSA values.

Principles** The system, LS 6500, is designed for counting 14 C, 3 H, 32 P, and other soft-beta emitters. Radioactive samples measured with an H-number are subjected to quench correction to determine actual sample activity, so called DPM, disintegrations per minute. The standard curve is plotted with the data from quenched standards with known activity containing the same type of isotope as in the sample and H-number are measured for each standard. **IV. Calculations** - % E (efficiency) = [(CPM-background) /DPM] x 100 Where, - % E is calculated from correction curve, - CPM is obtained in sample, - DPM is 3. 92 × 104 [= (2. 2 × 106 DPM/µCi) x (0. 018 µCi) ] - Based on quench correction curve, %E is obtained to calculate DPM for any radioactive samples containing 14 C. - External standard curve: In order to plot standard curve for 14 C, quenched standards with known activity were measured. ![Table 1]([URL] "Table 1 ") ### References 1.

Use 1000 µL <b>automatic</b> <b>pipette</b> to add 760 µL of to HPLC (or ACS) grade 98 % sulfuric acid to the 4 L bottle; - 5. Use stir bar to degas the mixture. Shake the bottle upside down vigorously several times. - CM mixture:chloroform:methanol:butylated hydroxytolune (BHT) = 2 L: 1 L: 100 mg. - CM mixture:chloroform:BHT= 100 mL: 900 mL: 100 mg. ### Equipment HPLC priming: 1. Check if mobile phase is enough. - Check if the washing solvent bottle in 507 E autosampler is enough. It is recommended to use degassed methanol as washing solvent (Ref 3 : pp 2 - 9). - Wash the autosampler syringe to get rid of air bubbles. Click the button of “ 507 E wash” 2 - 3 times. - Check if the autosampler tubing is leaking. - Change to the method for use. Click “single run” botton. Check if the mobile phase line is in the right solvent bottle. - Prime the pumps (First prime lines, then prime pumps). - Check if batch file options are right. Check the shutdown method {{to make sure that it}} uses the same mobile phase as the running method. - Check the hard disk space in Windows File Manager. - Check if the waste solvent bottle is full. ### Procedure I. Total PL assay 1. Check the <b>automatic</b> <b>pipette</b> before sample pipetting. Add 100 µL lymph/bile/serum with <b>automatic</b> <b>pipette</b> into a 16 × 100 mm PTFE capped test tube, wash the pipette tip with 100 µL D. I. water, and add 4 mL of CM mixture with 5 mL dispenser. - Vortex the tube vigorously. Wait at least 1 h for proteins in the sample to denature. There will be white stuff emerging gradually. - Add 800 µL D. I. water into the tube. Shake the tube upside down 3 times. Wait until there are two clear layers. Siphon off the upper layer with the negative water pressure instrument. - Evaporate the tube under a gentle stream of N 2 at 40 C. - Add 400 µL chloroform to the tube. Cap tightly. Vortex the tube with Vortex-Genie gently 3 times at # 3. - Add 100 µL chromagenic solution and shake the tube 3 times with fingers. - Cap the tube tightly. Otherwise the chloroform will evaporate and the absorbance will be very high. Boil the tube in the boiling water bath for 1 min 10 sec. Wait 5 min for the tube to cool down to room temperature. - Add 4 mL of chloroform gently into the tube and shake the tube 3 times with fingers. (Crucial point!!!) - Allow the tube to stand for 30 min at room temperature. - Take the lower solution quickly with a pasteur pipette. - Determine the absorbance at 710 nm. Use chloroform as the blank. II. PL subclasses assay 1. Prepare a set of 16 × 100 mm tubes. - Use 100 µL autopipette to add 100 µL of lymph/bile/serum. Wash the pipette tip with 100 µL of fresh D. I. water. - Add 5 mL of CM (2 : 1) mixture to the tube. Vortex vigorously. - Use multiple <b>automatic</b> <b>pipette</b> to add 25 µL of concentrated HCl to lower PH. Lower PH to separate phospholipids from proteins and deactive proteins. Optimum amount of concentrated HCl needs to be determined in the future studies. - After overnight deproteinization, cotton-like residue will appear. - Add 1 mL of fresh D. I. water (20 %). Shake gently upside down. Don’t vortex vigorously to break the protein residue to make sure easy separation of the residue. - Wait until two clear layers appear. - Siphon off the upper water layer. - Wait 30 min to let the leftover clear, then some white residue will appear on the surface, siphon off the residue again. - Evaporate the lower CM mixture layer. Check the temperature of the evaporator before using. - After drying, add 500 µL of inject solvent to dissolve the lipids. Methanol causes a negative peak close to PE peak. Acetonitrile causes a negative peak close to chloroform peak. - Too much chloroform is detrimental to the column and cause big solvent peaks. Small amount of chloroform is needed to dissolve the PI and PS. - To the best knowledge of this lab, acetonitrile (10) :chloroform (1) (v/v) is considered the most suitable inject solvent. - Pour the final mixture into the autosampler vials for HPLC running.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this MA thesis {{is to find out}} whether the nucleic acid {{electrophoresis}} experiment should be implemented in primary schools, how successfully students pass the preliminary and final test on electrophoresis and how this teaching technique stimulates the students' interest in additional in-depth studying of chemistry. We conducted a thorough analysis with the aim of discovering potential differences in marks and long-term knowledge on electrophoresis between students with different levels of autonomous and controlled motivation. The aim of this MA thesis is also to ascertain how the students' different levels of chemistry study skills influence their test marks. For the purpose of this research we developed and optimised an experiment on the principle of DNA electrophoresis and DNA profiling which the students can perform independently. The experiment is suitable for laboratory work in primary schools and consists of electrophoresis with marker pigments or food pigments. We also constructed a device for electrophoresis that illustrates the method of conducting the electrophoresis procedure. We provided the necessary instruments (<b>automatic</b> <b>pipette)</b> for carrying out the DNA electrophoresis procedure so that the students could test their manual capabilities with unknown instruments. The empirical part of this research included 129 students of the 8 th and 9 th grade who attended optional subjects “Experiments in chemistry” and “Chemistry in everyday life” at primary schools in Ljubljana and its vicinity. Before conducting the experiment, the students filled out a questionnaire entitled “Reasons why students study chemistry” and passed a preliminary test. After finishing the experiment, they filled out another questionnaire entitled “Study session performance evaluation” and took a test on electrophoresis. Two months after the experiment, the students passed the same test again and the gathered data was quantitatively analysed with the SPSS statistical program. The research shows that students successfully passed both preliminary and final tests on electrophoresis despite the difficulty and abstract nature of the conducted experiment.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} in vitro sperm activation (ISA) using non-liquefied versus liquefied asthenozoospermic semen samples for improvement of sperm parameters. "nMaterials and Methods: Fifty six oligoasthenozoospermic (OA) patients (age range: 22 - 44 years; mean: 32. 089 years) were enrolled in this study. OA patients were classified according to type of infertility. Also, duration of infertility was recorded. Fifty six semen samples were collected, and seminal fluid analyses were done involving macroscopic and microscopic examinations were performed according to WHO methodology. Direct swim&ndash;up technique was used to separate the motile spermatozoa from seminal plasma. Minimum Essential Medium Eagle (MEME) enriched with 5 % Human serum albumin (HSA) was used. One mL of either non&ndash;liquefied or liquefied semen was layered beneath 1 mL of MEME enriched with 5 % HSA, and placed for incubation in an air incubator at 37 oC for 30 minutes. Then, one drop (10 &mu;L) from upper layer of culture medium was taken using <b>automatic</b> <b>pipette</b> to be examined under high power field (40 X) for assessment of sperm parameters. "nResults: According to type of infertility, infertile patients were classified into patients with either primary infertility (no. 46; 82. 15 %) or secondary infertility (no. 10; 17. 85 %). In contrast to other parameters, significant (P&lt; 0. 05) reductions were noticed in the percentages of sperm motility and progressive sperm motility for OA patients with primary infertility as compared to OA patients with secondary infertility. All sperm parameters were significantly (P&lt; 0. 001) enhanced after in vitro activation of liquefied and non-liquefied semen samples when compared to pre-activation. In the present study, best results were achieved for non-liquefied semen samples as compared to liquefied semen samples. "nConclusion: It was concluded that the outcome of ISA was enhanced in regard to sperm parameters when using non-liquefied semen of OA patients. Furthermore, some components of seminal plasma of OA patients may be have harmful effects on certain sperm functions when in vitro incubated for longer periods. Further study is recommended to investigate the effect of in vitro sperm activation from non-liquefied semen on successful rate of artificial insemination husband...|$|E

ISOLATION AND PRIMARY CULTURE OF BROWN FAT PREADIPOCYTES ### Rationale: To prepare primary brown preadipocytes for immortalization: {{useful for}} {{metabolic}} studies from knockout mice. This {{consists of the}} following five protocols. References: Fasshauer, M., J. Klein, K M. Kriauciunas, K. Ueki, M. Benito, and C. R. Kahn. 2001. Essential role of insulin substrate 1 in differentiation of brown adipocytes. *Mol Cell Biol* 21 : 319 - 329. Fasshauer, M., J. Klein, K. Ueki, K. M. Kriauciunas, M. Benito, M. F. White, and C. R. Kahn. 2000. Essential role of insulin substrate- 2 in insulin stimulation of glut 4 translocation and glucose uptake in brown adipocytes. *J. Biol Chem* 275 : 25494 - 25501. ### Reagents: ![Table 1]([URL] "Table 1 ") ### Protocol: Prepare: - shaking waterbath 37 °C - Thaw isolation buffer and add collagenase (1. 5 mg/ml) (Collagenase A, B&M; Roche, catalog # 103 578) vortex - Sterile PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline) - Reserve tissue culture hood - Warm up primary cell culture medium (which includes 20 mM HEPES and 20 % FBS) 1. Remove interscapular brown fat pad from mice (age late fetal to post natal day 2) - Dissect and mince tissue on parafilm with 500 ul PBS (sterile), use sterile pipette tips, indent parafilm in center so PBS will stay in the center. - Pipette tissue into 500 ul collagenase solution in Eppendorf vials (total volume now about 1000 ul). - Vortex for 10 seconds. - Put Eppendorf vials into shaking waterbath at 90 cycles/minutes (use plastic box and red weights) for 30 seconds and vortex for 10 seconds every 5 minutes - digestion should not exceed 40 minutes. - Filter digested tissue through 100 um filters (LABCOR PRODUCTS, INC. P. O. Box 7277, Gaithersburg, Maryland 20898 - 7277, catalog # 30 - 1, Sterile Nytex Membrane Filter, 38 x 38 mm, 100 Micron, 50 /pkg, Individually Wrapped, order from: PGC Scientific, 7311 Governors Way, Frederick, Maryland 21704, 800 - 424 - 3300, catalog # 358 - 201) into fresh, autoclaved Eppendorf vials. - Centrifuge Eppendorf vials at RT at 1500 rpm (Eppendorf centrifuge) for 5 minutes. - During centrifugation add 2 ml pre-warmed culture medium to 12 well plates. - Remove supernatant (use 1 ml <b>automatic</b> <b>pipette).</b> - Re-suspend pellet in 1 ml culture medium per sample (use 1 ml <b>automatic</b> <b>pipette)</b> and transfer into a 12 well plate. - Leave cells overnight to get plated (day 1). - Next day: wash cells with 3 mls culture medium and add 3 mls fresh culture medium (day 2). (N. B. Cells are sensitive to cold and aspirating therefore hand aspirate.) ### 2.) IMMORTALIZING BROWN FAT CELLS- ESTABLISHING CELL LINES After cells are plated overnight, (day 1), next day wash cells (day 2), on day 3 need to add virus (pBabe SV 40 Large T antigen puromycin). *(preparation of viral stock see protocol 3) * To each well add: VIRUS SOLUTION which consists of: 1) 50 % primary culture media, 2) 50 % viral stock, 3) 1 X polybreen- 8 mg/ml stock solution dissolved in ddH 2 O- final conc. 4 ug/ml(1 : 2000 dilution) (hexadimethrine bromide, Sigma, catalog # H- 9268) 1), 2), 3), should add up to approximately 0. 9 ml/well. For example: if there are 6 wells with cells to be immortalized you need 6 (X) (0. 9 ml) = 5. 4 ml total volume containing primary culture media, viral stock and polybreen. Thus, take 2. 7 mls of primary culture media, 2. 7 mls of viral stock, and 2. 7 ul of polybreen stock, mix by pipetting, filter sterile using a 0. 45 micron filter. Then, for each well, pipette off media, DO NOT USE VACUUM (vacuum will disrupt cells too much), rinse well with 2 mls pre-warmed primary culture media, pipette off rinsing media and add VIRUS SOLUTION VERY SLOWLY!!!!!!! NEXT DAY: split cells into 15 cm dishes - pipette off VIRUS SOLUTION - rinse well with 2 mls DMEM - high (without FBS) - pipette off, put in ≅ 0. 2 ml trypsin for ≅ 3 minutes (until cells just come off plate) - add 2 mls primary culture media, transfer to 15 cm dish containing 25 mls primary culture media. TWO DAYS LATER: start puromycin (Sigma, catalog # P 8833) selection (2 ug/ml puromycin into DMEM high (+) 20 % FBS). Leave in puromycin media for one week. (At this point some cells can be split off to differentiate or do some experiments with.) After puromycin selection cells need {{to be put into}} media directed against *mycoplasma* *infection* (BM Cyclin, Boehringer Mannheim, catalog # 799 050). This will take approximately 2 - 3 weeks. Once cells have been in puromycin and mycoplasma selection they can be frozen down. ### 3.) SV 40 LARGE T ANTIGEN VIRUS PRODUCTION Pharmacia’s Cell Phect protocol with slight modifications (Cell Phect Transfection Kit, Pharmacia Biotech, Cat. # 27 - 9268 - 01) -Grow φNX Cells (see below) in 15 cm plates, 50 - 70 % confluent 4 pm evening 1. Dissolve 15 ug of SV 40 T-pBabe-puro in 480 ul distilled water. - Add 480 ul buffer A - Vortex briefly and incubate for 10 minutes at room temperature. - Add 960 ul buffer B with blue pipette tip {{while at the same time}} you are “bubbling” the solution with an <b>automatic</b> <b>pipette.</b> - Incubate for 15 minutes at room temperature. - Add the precipitate to the φ cell culture (in 15 cm plates, 50 - 70 % confluent) as evenly as possible and support distribution by rotating the dish in a figure eight configuration a few times. Next morning (i. e. 10 a. m.) : 1. Aspirate the medium and rinse the cells CAREFULLY with 25 mls ROOM TEMPERATURE DMEM-H (no FBS) twice. - Add 25 mls ROOM TEMPERATURE DMEM-H + 10 % FBS to the cells. Same day (i. e. 4 pm.) : 1. Change the medium to 25 mls fresh ROOM TEMPERATURE DMEM-H + 10 % FBS. Next evening (24 hours later, i. e. 4 pm.) : First viral harvest: 1. Aspirate supernatant with a 50 cc sterile syringe + 18 G sterile needle. - Remove needle and put 0. 45 micron filter in front of the syringe. - Press the supernatant through the filter into a 50 ml blue top tube. - Add polybrene (4 ug per ml) to the supernatant and mix. - Freeze 1 ml aliquots in sterile freezing vials and store in (-) 80 °C freezer. - Add 25 mls fresh ROOM TEMPERATURE DMEM-H + 10 % FBS to the φ cells. Next evening (24 hours later, i. e. 4 pm.) : Second harvest exactly like the first one. **NOTES ON HANDLING φ NX CELLS** 1. The cells are grown in DMEM-High + 10 % FBS at 5 % CO 2. - The cells grow rapidly. - The cells come off of the dish very easily so be careful when washing/feeding them. - The cells are frozen in 90 % FBS + 10 % DMSO (dimethly sulfoxide) - It is recommended that the cells are not allowed to reach confluence and that they are periodically grown in selection media to maintain their retroviral packaging “goodies”. **φNX Cell Selection Media** DMEM-High + 10 % FBS + 300 ug/ml Hygromycin B + 1 ug/ml Diptheria Toxin A The cells will round up some, they don’t look very good but it’s OK. The cells need to be in selection only about 4 - 7 days, then place themback into regular media and allow them to “recover” to their normal morphology before using and/or freezing them. Additional information and more details regarding the φ NX cells can be found on the Nolan lab homepage at: www. Stanford. edu/group/Nolan/. ### 4.) CULTURING BROWN FAT CELLS ### Media: 1. DMEM high (+) 10 % FBS - DMEM high no FBS (for rinsing cells) -always use new pipette - DMEM high no FBS (for starving cells) - DMEM high (+) 10 % FBS (+) insulin and T 3 - Differentiation Media - Induction Media (see below) ### Typical Differentiation Time Course: - Day 1 - split into Differentiation Media - 2 - 3 - Day 4 - induce confluent cells - 5 - Day 6 - put back into Differentiation media - 7 - 8 - aspirate off old media and add fresh Differentiation media - 9 - Day 10 - fully differentiated cells ready to be used for: Oil Red O staining, RNA/DNA extraction, Western analysis etc. **MASTER PLATE** - one large dish 15 cm - Always in DMEM high (+) 10 % FBS **To split**: if confluent a 1 : 20 split (ie. - 1 ml cells plus 25 mls media will reach confluence in 3 days) - Aspirate off media - Rinse cells using DMEM high (no FBS) - fill 25 ml pipette to top- rinse each Master plate with 18 ml - Add 2. 5 mls trypsin/plate (always use new pipette) - Put back into CO 2 for at least 20 mins. (while trypsinizing label other plates/dishes) - (leave cells alone while trypsinizing- this seems to help avoid cells from clumping) **Preparation for “Splitting” Plates** - decide what kind and how many plates are needed: ie: - 6 well plate- gets 4 mls differentiation media plus 12 drops of cells - 12 well plate: gets 2 mls differentiation media - 10 cm dish- gets 8 mls Differentiation media (+) 3 ml cells- usually can get 2 - 4 mg protein - 15 cm dish- Master plate – ALWAYS gets 25 mls DMEM high (+) 10 % FBS **After labelling plates:** - Take out trypsinized Master Plate - Add 25 mls DMEM high (+) 10 % FBS, pipette up and down three times to disperse cells and break up clumps - add - 1 ml to Master plate, - 12 drops into 4 mls differentiation media- 6 well plate, - 3 mls cells into 8 mls differentiation media- 10 cm. Dish - while plating out one cell type-others can remain in trypsin in the hood - when done “splitting” cells take Master plate and 10 cm dish and “distribute” cells evenly by moving dishes in a “figure eight” configuration ten times (for 6 well plates use a “faster” figure eight) FREEZING CELLS- freeze cells in DMEM high (+) 20 % FBS (+) 10 % DMSO ![Table 2]([URL] "Table 2 ") INDUCTION MEDIA - when cells are confluent - prepare fresh – use only on the day you need it - Aspirate off differentiation media and add induction media- no rinsing - 11 mls per plate - For 200 mls Media: add 200 mls Differentiation media to top of 500 ml filter bottle add: 1. 0. 125 M indomethacin (1000 X) - 200 ul (Sigma, catalog # I- 7378) - 2 mg/ml dexamethasone-vortex (1000 X) - 200 ul (Sigma, catalog # D- 1756) - 0. 25 M IBMX (500 X) - 400 ul-(Sigma, catalog # I- 5879) must add immediately after thawing - thaw - vortex - add back to heating block - all three are dissolved in 100 % ethanol and stored frozen in (-) 20 freezer - 1) and 3) must be heated to 75 °C (use heating block) ### 5.) OIL RED O STAINING PROTOCOL This protocol is used to test for lipid accumulation in fully differentiated cells. Stock Oil Red O: 0. 5 g Oil Red O (Sigma, catalog # 0 - 0625) in 100 ml isopropanol 1. Rinse plates with PBS - Fix cells by covering with PBS + 10 % formaldehyde or with commercially available buffered formalin (Sigma, catalog # HT 50 - 1 - 640) - Let plates sit at least 15 min. or as long as overnight, at room temperature, alternatively plates can be left @ 4 °C until multiple plates are collected. - Prepare Oil Red O working solution (make fresh each time, as working solution is unstable) by adding 6 ml stock to 4 ml ddH 20. Mix and filter through Whatman # 1 filter paper. (The filtration step takes awhile; it is not advisable to hasten the process by applying a vacuum because there is too much stuff to filter out.) Make about 5 ml per 10 cm plate to be stained. - Remove fixation agent, add Oil Red O stain. - Sit 1 hour (or longer) at room temperature. - Rinse several times, carefully, with distilled water to remove excess stain and any precipitate that forms. - Maintain dishes in water if intact cells are desired. - Pour off distilled water and allow dishes to air dry. - Scan plate...|$|E

CM mixture: chloroform: methanol: butylated hydroxytolune (BHT) = 2 L : 1 L : 100 mg. - 0. 5 N methanolic sodium hydroxide (NaOH) (10 g NaOH in 500 mL methanol) : mix the solution for 15 minutes with a stir bar. Don’t heat the mixture because methanol is highly flammable. - 14 % Boron Trifluoride (BF 3) in methanol (commercially available from Sigma) - HPLC grade petroleum ether (3. 3 mg BHT in 100 mL petroleum ether) - Saturated aqueous sodium chloride (NaCl) : Add some NaCl into 500 mL D. I. water. Stir the solution until it is clear. Add more NaCl until it does not disappear any more. Wait until the NaCl crystal precipitate. Pour the clear solution into a glass bottle. - Anhydrous Na 2 SO 4 - Internal standard (10 mg nonadecanoic acid in 100 mL CM mixture 2 : 1 = 100 ng/µL, 200 mg heptadecanoic acid in 100 mL CM mixture 2 : 1 = 2000 ng/µL) As ISTD, C 17 : 0 is better than C 19 : 0 because {{the peak of the}} former one has better resolution than that of the latter one. Procedure: Weigh 10 mL beaker (about 8 g), add some nonadecanoic acid into it, weigh it again to get net weight of 10 mg. Add some CM mixture (2 : 1) into the beaker to dissolve the powder. Weigh 200 mg C 17 : 0 in the same way. Pool the solution into a 100 mL volumetric flask. Wash the beaker 10 times and pool the washing solution into the flask. Tip off the flask to the mark with CM mixture. Shake the flask to dissolve the nonadecanoic acid totally. Wrap the mouth of the flask with Teflon tape. Wrap the flask with alumnium foil. ### Procedure **I. External Standard Curve Setting Up** 1. Estimate the ranges of fatty acids species in the sample and determine calibration points. For example: ![E 1]([URL] "E 1 ") 2. Make standard FAME solutions for the calibration curves (FAME standards are from Nu-Chek-Prep, Inc.) : - Choice 1 : Weigh the 10 ml beaker, write down the value. Add about 100 mg 1 A in the 10 ml beaker, weigh again and write down the value. Wash the 10 ml beaker with petroleum ether more than 5 times. Collect the wash in a 100 ml volumetric flask. Weigh about 100 mg 3 A in the same way. Collect the wash in the same 100 ml volumetric flask. Tip to the marker with petroleum ether. Calculate the theoretic amount (ng/inj. vol.) - Choice 2 : Weigh the 10 ml beaker, write down the value. Add about 100 mg 68 A in the 10 ml beaker, weigh again and write down the value. Wash the 10 ml beaker with petroleum ether more than 5 times. Collect the wash in a 10 ml volumetric flask. Tip to the marker with petroleum ether. Calculate the theoretic amount (ng / inj. vol.) 3. Preparation and injection of different concentrations of standard FAMEs: Concentrate or dilute the standard FAMEs according to the values of the calibration points. At least 3 injections are needed at each concentration level for each fatty acid. Average the peak area for the injections. Type the theoretic amount and average peak area into the calibration table. Save the method. 4. Make standard FAME solutions for the determination of the retention time (RT) : Weigh the 10 ml beaker, write down the value. Add about 100 mg 68 D in the 10 ml beaker, weigh again and write down the value. Wash the 10 ml beaker with petroleum ether more than 5 times. Collect the wash in a 10 ml volumetric flask. Tip to the marker with petroleum ether. Calculate the theoretic amount (ng / inj. vol.). 68 D is better for the determination of the RT because it has a unique fatty acids profiles. **II Procedure**: i. Pre-experiment: 1. Turn on the boiling water bath, the evaporator’s water bath, and the centrifuge. - Check the tube mouth carefully and wash with CM mixture and dry. - Put the sample in ice. - Check the pipette or syringe accuracy before pipetting. ii. Extraction of fatty acids: - Proper amount of sample and internal STD should be determined for each kind of biological sample. If GC system conditions are changed, this step should be done also. Less sample amount won’t show all interested peaks, while greater sample amount will introduce some unknown peaks and affect the baseline and resolution. - The data should be in the range of calibration curves. Otherwise, the new calibration curve should be done. For lymph/bile/serum: 1. Use the 100 µL <b>automatic</b> <b>pipette</b> to add 100 µL lymph into the 16 × 100 mm tube. Wash the tip with 100 µL D. I. water. - Use 5 mL dispenser to add 4 mL CM mixture (2 : 1) into the tube. - Use 250 µL syringe to add 200 µL internal standard (C 19 : 0 or C 17 : 0) into the tube. Vortex vigorously 9 seconds. Wait 30 minutes. To denature protein and extract fatty acids. - There are two ways {{to get rid of the}} aqueous residue: - I. “Water Washing”: - Fill the dispenser with fresh D. I. water everyday. Use dispenser to add 900 µL D. I. water. Shake the tube upside down 3 times. - Let the tube stand at RT for 10 min until two distinct layers show. Siphon off the upper aqueous layer with negative pressure system. - Evaporate the lower solvent layer under N 2. - II. “Filtering”: - Apply 0. 45 mm PTFE filter to filter the lipid extract. - Evaporate the solvent under N 2. For tissue lipid extract: 1. Use the 500 µL syringe to add 500 µL tissue lipid extraction into the 16 × 100 mm tube. - Use 500 µL syringe to add 500 µL internal standard (C 19 : 0 or C 17 : 0) into the tube. Vortex vigorously 9 seconds. - Evaporate under the N 2. Typical applications for different tissues: ![Table 1]([URL] "Table 1 ") iii. Sample preparation: 5. Add 2 mL 0. 5 N methanolic NaOH into the tube. Vortex vigorously 9 seconds. Cap tightly. 6. Heat the tube in a boiling water bath for 15 minutes. 7. While waiting, prepare another set of 12 × 100 tubes. Add 0. 15 g anhydrous Na 2 SO 4. Prepare pasteur pipettes. 8. After cooling the tube for 5 minutes, add 2 mL 14 % BF 3. Vortex vigorously 9 seconds. Cap tightly. After using the BF 3, blow some N 2 into the BF 3 bottle and seal it. 9. Heat another 15 minutes. Cool down the tube in ice for 5 minutes. 10. Use a dispenser to add 2 mL petroleum ether and 2 mL <b>automatic</b> <b>pipette</b> to add 2 mL saturated aqueous NaCl into the tube. 11. Vortex the tube vigorously for 2 minute with the “vortex rack”. Centrifuge the tube for 5 minutes. 12. Use a pasteur pipette to transfer carefully the upper petroleum ether layer into the tube with anhydrous Na 2 SO 4. Cap the tube and vortex 9 seconds. Let the tube stand for 20 minutes. Petroleum ether is very easy to drop from the pipette. Be careful! Don’t take all of the upper layer. It is better not to disturb the lower layer. 13. While waiting, choose a set of brown color glass vials and check the mouth of the tube. Wash the tubes with CM mixture and Pet ether. The cap of the vial should be Teflon. 14. Transfer the solution with pasteur pipette into the vials. Wash the tubes once with 2 mL petroleum ether. Add the washing solution into the vials. Be careful not to transfer the aqueous layer, otherwise the evaporation will take much longer time and there will be NaSO 4 residue on the wall of the vial. The residue might affect the GC separation of fatty acids. 15. Evaporate the vials at 30 - 40 C under a very gentle stream of N 2. Stop evaporating immediately after the vials are dry because FAMEs are very easy to evaporate. 16. Take out the vial and put it into the ice box to cool down for 15 seconds. Put the bottle of petroleum ether with BHT in ice also to avoid evaporating. 17. Use 250 µL syringe to add exactly 100 µL petroleum ether with BHT into the vial. Vortex gently. Cap tightly. Wrap the cap with Teflon tape. 18. Wait 3 - 4 hours for GC injection, otherwise the recovery rate will be low. From my experience, overnight standing is OK. iv. GC injection: For the GC 6890 system, check handbooks for the installation and hardware information. Check the online tutorial and printout help files for the software information. 19. Check if the gas tanks are full. The tanks should be changed to avoid GC column contamination if the pressure is below 400 psi. 20. Before GC warming on, check if the septa need to be changed. To change the new septa, wash it with HPLC graded methanol and put it on the inlet. Set GC temperature to 250 °C for 30 min. to clean the residues from the new septa. 21. GC warming up. At least half an hour before the sample injection, click the icon “instrument 1 online” on the desktop. In the popup windows, type in the name of the operator. In the ChemStation desktop, click the menu “File” – “Load Method” to choose the right method. After the warming up, run the “Instrument” – “StartColumnComRun” to set blank injection. 22. Click the “RunControl” – “Sample Info” to change the name of the operator, file prefix, and subdirectory for the file storing, etc. 23. Before injection, wash the 10 µL GC syringe with D. I. water, then acetone, then petroleum ether. 24. Put the vials in ice. Apply “Hot Needle Solvent Flushing Method” to inject sample into the GC. Wash 10 µL GC syringe with petroleum ether, take 2 µL pet ether, pull the needle a lot bit more in the air to make a small air plug in the syringe, then take exactly 3 µL sample final solution into the syringe (try to avoid contacting the vial with bare hands), measure the amount exactly, wipe the syringe needle with tissue paper, pull again to take some air into the syringe to avoid evaporation of the solution. Push the syringe needle into the GC inlet. Count 9 (3 seconds) to make the needle hot. Inject the sample as fast as you can. Pull the syringe out quickly. Push the “Start” button on the GC panel. 25. For the purpose of quality control, inject external STD first, then inject samples, finally inject external STD again to check if the GC is stable. Inject one ESTD for every 10 samples. 26. After injection, wash the 10 µL GC syringe with D. I. water, then acetone. Detailed information regarding the Gas Chromatography Method can be found in the following Word Document.
