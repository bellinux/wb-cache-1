This gives two main advantages; firstly the {{signal to noise ratio}} (SNR) of a defect echo can be enhanced, secondly it can be used as an additional tool to help discriminate between ‘real' and ‘false' indications. However, there are disadvantages associated with this technique; firstly, the defect location must be known before the focusing can be applied, secondly, the separate data set required for the <b>active</b> <b>focusing</b> technique can also significantly reduce the time and cost efficiency of GWT.|$|R

50|$|As {{previously}} mentioned, the focusing technique {{can also}} be used to help discriminate between ‘real' and ‘false' indications, a ‘false' indication being a received signal that does not directly correspond to the position of a defect; such as those from reverberations or from incomplete cancellation of unwanted wave modes. If a ‘false' indication is present in the A-scan data, it will also be re-represented in any C-scan type results as this type of processing uses the same original data. As <b>active</b> <b>focusing</b> involves a separate data collection, focusing at the position of a ‘false' indication will give a negative result, whereas focusing on a ‘true' indication will give a positive result. Therefore, the <b>active</b> <b>focusing</b> technique can help overcome the propensity of ‘false calls' generated by guided wave testing systems.|$|R

5000|$|For an {{individual}} to become happier or to grow {{in a short period}} of time there needs to be a means for him or her to actively think, feel and act in ways that foster positive mental health. In the experience of Lifetrack, the ability to improve the subjective world far beyond a previous best requires an <b>active</b> <b>focus</b> of one's mental states throughout therapy. Ishizuka has found that using simple definitions of positive mental health as the objective of therapy and a subjective 10 point rating scale, one can track subjective responses to life events. For example, if you depend on your spouse or significant other at only a 5 on a 10-point scale, that implies that you can think, feel and act in ways that allow you to more graciously depend." [...] With his patients taking five to ten minutes daily to track self, intimacy and achievement spheres, as well as positive peaks of well-being (peace, friendliness, physical-health, happiness, mastery), negative peaks (anxiety, anger, physical symptoms, depression, psychosis), physical health, and proper use of food, beverage, or other substances, focus on incremental thinking, feeling and acting is encouraged. In therapy, Ishizuka actively uses setbacks as a means to promote growth in the three spheres. Together, the therapist and the patient use the definition of positive mental health and the subjective daily rating of the patient in 41 mental health parameters to focus weekly therapy sessions on overcoming setbacks and building health beyond a previous best level of adjustment.|$|E
