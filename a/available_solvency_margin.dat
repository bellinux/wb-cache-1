40|$|AbstractThis study {{presents}} {{the legislation that}} regulates the Romanian unit-linked life insurance market. The main document that regulates both the insurance business on Romanian market and the organizing and operating of the Insurance Supervisory Commission (CSA) is Law no. 32 / 2000 on insurance undertakings and insurance supervision, as amended and supplemented, which provides: organizing and operating of insurance, insurance/reinsurance and reinsurance undertakings, of mutual undertakings, {{as well as of}} insurance intermediaries; organizing and operating of the CSA; supervision of the insurance and reinsurance undertakings conducting business in or from Romania; supervision of the insurance and reinsurance intermediaries, as well as the supervision of other activities related to the insurance mediation. The legislation which regulates the Romanian insurance market includes: norms issued by CSA; laws and governmental ordinances that regulate the Romanian financial market; CSA draft regulations which are to be submitted to consulting with the players on the market; EU Directives in the insurance field; repealed or no longer in force legislative acts and international sanctions. According to Directive, 2002 / 83 /EC, unit-linked life insurance products were defined as insurance contracts where the benefits provided are directly linked to the value of units in undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) or to the value of assets contained in an internal fund owned by the insurance undertaking, usually divided into units, or a share index or some other reference value. The financial supervision shall include verification, with respect to the insurance undertaking's entire business, of its state of solvency, the establishment of technical provisions, including mathematical provisions, and of the assets covering them, in accordance with the rules laid down or practices followed in the home Member State pursuant to the provisions adopted at Community level. Each Member State shall require of every insurance undertaking whose head office is situated in its territory an adequate <b>available</b> <b>solvency</b> <b>margin</b> in respect of its entire business. In general the European Union requirements and the national requirements are common for all life insurance products offered by an insurance company and also there is not a very clear distinction between the legislation regarding unit-linked life insurance products and the one regarding traditional life insurance products. Policyholders want to enjoy the benefits of equity investment in conjunction with mortality protection, and insurers have developed unit-linked contracts to meet this challenge. Unit linked insurance products are life insurance policies with investment component. Although some unit-linked contract types pass most of the asset risk to the policyholder and involve little or no investment risk for the insurer, it was natural for insurers to incorporate payment guarantees in these new contracts...|$|E
40|$|<b>Solvency</b> <b>margin</b> {{standards}} for Insurers {{were introduced to}} Japan for application {{from the end of}} fiscal 1996, referring to the Risk-based capital system already used in the United States, etc. However, during the finan-cial crisis period, 1997 - 2000, 7 life insurance companies became bankrupt in spite of the their sufficient level of <b>solvency</b> <b>margin</b> ratios, the criti-sism has been growing that the present solvency standards incomplete and unreliable, should be reviewed and improved. The ”Program for Further Financial Reform,”published by the Finan-cial Services Agency (FSA) in December 2004, claimed the need to review the calculation standard for the <b>solvency</b> <b>margin</b> ratio in order to improve insurers’financial soundness and further optimize their risk management. The FSA will conduct deliberations in order to implement specific revi-sions of the calculation standard for the <b>solvency</b> <b>margin</b> ratio and realize solvency evaluation based on economic value, and pay careful attention to EU SolvencyII project.

40|$|Many {{statutory}} solvency requirements, e. g. {{the system}} prescribed by the EU, {{do not take}} into account the distribution of the investments. In practice, however, an adequate <b>solvency</b> <b>margin</b> of an insurance company depends strongly on the investment portfo-lio. This paper describes how the sufficient level of the <b>solvency</b> <b>margin</b> can be esti-mated. In this, only the margin depending on the company’s investments is dealt with and the margin for the insurance risk is not included. First, the paper describes the use of an asset liability simulation model for the calcula-tion for the <b>solvency</b> <b>margin.</b> Then some formulas are developed for approximating the simulation results. These formulas depend on the means, standard deviations and cor-relation coefficients of the investment yields, as well as on the chosen risk level. In addition, the interest rate applied to the reserves is taken into account. Finally, the paper describes the new formula for the statutory solvency requirements of the Finnish employment pension institutions...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} whether insurers base their <b>solvency</b> <b>margins</b> on risk factors even when operating under a supervisory regime where minimum solvency requirements {{do not fully}} take such risk factors into account. To do this, we use a dataset of about 350 Dutch insurers from all major lines of business during the pre-Solvency II period 1995 - 2005. We find that the levels of insurers' actual <b>solvency</b> <b>margins</b> are related to their risk characteristics and not to regulatory solvency requirements. Consequently, {{the vast majority of}} insurers hold much more capital than required, i. e. non-risk based capital requirements generally are not binding. Requirements are found to affect solvency adjustment behaviour, though. More specifically, below-target capital ratios are raised most rapidly by those insurers whose targets are relatively close to the regulatory minimum. One implication from our results is that, because insurers already follow a risk-based approach, the transition to the new European regulatory framework, Solvency II, is likely to be smooth.

40|$|In the Finnish {{statutory}} {{employment pension}} scheme all the pension institutions {{have a common}} technical interest rate for the pension reserves. This interest rate is determined for each year, and {{it may also be}} changed during the year. In all cases, the interest rate is decided in advance before the period in which it is applied and before the actual investment results are known for certain. The law prescribes that both the security of the pensions and the obtainable investment yield {{must be taken into account}} when the technical interest rate is determined. This paper describes the method that was developed by the Interest Rate Working Group in the year 1998. The maximum obtainable investment yield is estimated using the Markowitz efficient frontier model, which gives the optimal mean values of the investment yield associated with different standard deviations. The standard deviations are then connected with the level of the <b>solvency</b> <b>margin</b> by specifying the risk of fal-ling to a statutory solvency limit. The result is the expected value of the obtainable investment yield as a function of the level of the <b>solvency</b> <b>margin.</b> The interest rate is then calculated by including terms that take into account the growth rate of the reserves and the short term level of the yields. The method does not produce the technical interest rate directly but rather gives a basis to assist in determining the proper level of the interest rate. 395...|$|R
