40|$|The aim of {{this work}} {{was to examine the}} {{influence}} of growing conditions on heavy metal content in virginia (flue cured) and burley (<b>air</b> <b>cured)</b> tobacco type. Moreover, some of these metals could appear in the tobacco cigarette smoke. This fact may cause negative consequences for cigarette consumers. Examinations were carried out in five various production areas, for each tobacco type, during two years, 1998 and 1999; those were extreme years for production. Considering the results, it can be concluded: The most important factor for heavy metal content in tobacco leaves are weather conditions especially the amount of rainfall, since there is a direct correlation between the rainfall and size of roots, a dominant vegetation organ. It is inevitable that the metals content in flue cured and <b>air</b> <b>cured</b> tobaccos grown at different experimental lots, is still below the legally prescribed values. Tobacco leaves from Šabac production area have a little higher metal content than tobacco grown in other production areas, because a larger amount of copper was found.

40|$|Although air void or the {{porosity}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important factors that affect the performance of hardened concretes, it is generally not considered in the design and analysis because of the difficulties of its quantification; for example, the air void content determination using ASTM C 457 method proved to be expensive, time consuming and tedious. This paper presents an efficient and inexpensive technique to measure air void content in concretes through the use of semi-automated image analysis software. One of the main advantages of this software is that it provides image acquisition and documentation for each analysis. Plain concrete and fly ash concretes have been used for the air content measurement study. Three methods of curing of concretes namely air curing, sheet curing and pond curing have been used and the specimens have been tested at the ages of 3 days, 7 days and 28 days. A total of 108 specimens have been analysed using the image analysis technique. The study has shown that in both plain and fly ash concretes the void ratio decreases with the extended curing period. The plain and fly ash concretes exposed to pond curing for a period of twenty eight days have shown 60 % and 58 % less air voids respectively than their <b>air</b> <b>cured</b> counterparts. The significance of the fly ash additive has become evident from this investigation as there have been reductions in air voids after the normal curing period as follows: 29 % in <b>air</b> <b>cured</b> specimens and 25 % in pond cured specimens.

40|$|Abstract- Curing is {{essential}} if concrete is {{to perform the}} intended function over the design life of the structure while excessive curing time {{may lead to the}} escalation of the construction cost of the project and unnecessary delays. Where there is a scarcity of water and on sloping surfaces where curing with water is difficult and in cases where large areas like pavements have to be cured, the use of curing compound may be resorted to. The parameters of the study include the curing period [3, 7, 28 and 56 day], curing method [Air curing, plastic films, immersion under water] and the type of cement [Portland pozzolona Cement(PPC) 43 grade,]. In this study specimens i. e. cube, cylinders, Beams were cast and cured under different conditions before testing. Test curing by air, nearly the same results as that of Plastic film but by immersion under water curing strength increase by age. The study demonstrates that the method and duration of curing greatly affects the strength characteristics of concrete. Hence quality control for proper field curing is of the utmost importance. From the test results, it was observed that there was an increase of 41. 7 percent, 31. 7 percent and 42. 1 percent in compressive strength at 7 days when compared to its strength at 3 days for specimens <b>air</b> <b>cured,</b> cured with plastic film and immersion under water curing respectively.

Time-dependent relative humidity (RH) distributions of three mixture proportions subjected to three different curing methods (i. e., <b>air</b> <b>curing,</b> water curing, and membrane-forming compounds curing) and sealed condition were measured for 28 days. A one-dimensional nonlinear moisture diffusion partial differential equation (PDE) based on Fick’s second law, which incorporates the effect of curing in the Dirichlet boundary condition using a concept of curing factor, is developed to simulate the diffusion process. Model parameters are calibrated by a genetic algorithm (GA). Experimental results show that the RH reducing rate inside concrete under <b>air</b> <b>curing</b> is greater than the rates under membrane-forming compound curing and water curing. It is shown that the effect of water-to-cement (w/c) ratio on self-desiccation is significant. Lower w/c ratio tends to result in larger RH reduction. RH reduction considering both effect of diffusion and self-desiccation in early-age concrete is not sensitive to w/c ratio, but to curing method. Comparison between model simulation and experimental results indicates that the improved model is able to reflect the effect of curing on moisture diffusion in early-age concrete slabs...|$|R

This research is also with a view to recommending the production of blocks from cement laterized in supplementing sandcrete blocks in the building construction industry, especially for low cost or rural building. For sample preparations, the crushed laterite soil was sieved into three different grains sizes which are, 1. 18 mm, 600 micro and 150 micro sizes. Then, each soil sizes will be mixed with a mix ratio of 1 : 2 : 6 (cement: soil: sand). Sodium hydroxide, (NaOH) solution with concentration of 1, 2 and 3 molar will be added in the mix and then cast the cube samples for each curing method. The compressive strength of the cube samples were recorded at the age of 14 days and 28 days of curing. The effect and relationship between the soil grains size, alkaline solution concentration, and curing method can be seen clearly. It can be concluded that, for this soil sample and for the mix ratio of 1 : 2 : 6, only 1 mol of alkaline solution is recommended. Addition of higher concentration of alkaline solution will reduce the compressive strength of the cube. In term of grains size effect, control samples made from 600 micro sizes produce the highest average compressive strength which is 3. 602 MPa and 3. 745 MPa for <b>air</b> <b>curing</b> and oven dry curing respectively.
