The main site at Meyrin hosts a large computing facility, which is primarily used to store <b>and</b> <b>analyse</b> <b>data</b> from experiments, as well as simulate events. Researchers need remote access to these facilities, so the lab has historically been a major wide area network hub. CERN is also {{the birthplace of the}} World Wide Web.|$|E
