5|$|In June 1940, the Wehrmacht had conquered most of Western Europe and Scandinavia. At that time, {{the only}} major power {{standing}} in the way of a German-dominated Europe was the British Empire and the Commonwealth. After having several peace offers rejected by the British, Adolf Hitler ordered the Luftwaffe to destroy the RAF in order to gain air superiority or air supremacy <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>prelude</b> to launching Operation Sea Lion, an amphibious assault by the Wehrmacht (German armed forces) onto the British mainland.|$|E
5|$|With 1,300 deputies {{still in}} Cripple Creek, Sheriff Bowers {{was unable to}} control the army he had created. On June 5, the deputies moved into Altman, perhaps <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>prelude</b> to {{storming}} Bull Hill. The deputies cut the telegraph and telephone wires leading out of town, and imprisoned a number of reporters. Concerned that the paramilitary force might get out of hand, Waite again dispatched the state militia, this time {{under the command of}} General E.J. Brooks.|$|E
5|$|Following the Battle of France, the Luftwaffe {{started its}} attacks on Channel convoys <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>prelude</b> to the Battle of Britain. The primary task of JG 51 {{during this time}} was to provide fighter escort to these bomber missions. The {{commander}} of JG 51, Oberst Theo Osterkamp established a policy of unrestricted combat air patrol (freie Jagd) of fighter Staffeln providing loose protection rather than close escort to the bombers, actively seeking out Royal Air Force fighters. On 7 July 1940 Oesau claimed one Spitfire.|$|E
5000|$|The {{recitals}} {{also contain}} an express statement: [...] "the {{people of the}} territory of the Virgin Islands have over centuries evolved with a distinct cultural identity which is the essence of a Virgin Islander". This operates <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>preludes</b> to various provisions in the Constitution which reserve specific rights of privileges to Belongers.|$|R
50|$|In the {{confrontation}} of Beowulf and Unferð {{in the poem}} Beowulf, flytings were used <b>as</b> either <b>a</b> <b>prelude</b> to battle or <b>as</b> <b>a</b> form of combat in their own right.|$|R
5000|$|Georg Böhm {{also set}} the hymn twice <b>as</b> <b>a</b> chorale <b>prelude</b> (formerly misattributed to Bach as BWV 760 and 761), in {{addition}} to <b>a</b> setting <b>as</b> <b>an</b> organ partita.|$|R
5|$|Like {{other members}} of its family, the copper shark is viviparous, in which the yolk sac of the {{developing}} embryo, once depleted, is converted into a placental connection through which the mother delivers nourishment. Adult females have one functional ovary, on the right, and two functional uteruses. The male bites the female <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>prelude</b> to mating. In the Southern Hemisphere, mating takes place from October to December (spring and early summer), when both sexes have migrated into offshore waters at higher latitudes. Birthing seems to occur from June to January, peaking in October and November.|$|E
5|$|Males {{make two}} calls that are {{directed}} at females, sometimes <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>prelude</b> to mating. One is {{a sequence of}} short squeaks; the other {{is made up of}} consecutive ah notes with 0.1 second between each note. These calls can be brief or last up to several minutes. Nestlings make a noisy grating begging call when seeking or expecting food. An adult female may also make the call while incubating the eggs. Immature birds also make a grating call not associated with begging that parents ignore.|$|E
5|$|Operation Ladbroke was a glider landing by British {{airborne}} troops during the Second World War near Syracuse, Sicily, that began on 9July1943 {{as part of}} Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily. The first Allied mission using large numbers of the aircraft, the operation was carried out from Tunisia by glider infantry of the British 1st Airlanding Brigade, commanded by Brigadier Philip Hicks, with a force of 136 Waco Hadrians and eight Airspeed Horsas. The objective was to establish a large invasion force on the ground {{near the town of}} Syracuse, secure the Ponte Grande Bridge and ultimately take control of the city itself with its strategically vital docks, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>prelude</b> to the full-scale invasion of Sicily.|$|E
25|$|Dieterich Buxtehude set {{the melody}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> chorale-cantata in 1683 for soprano, alto and bass {{accompanied}} by two violins and continuo (BuxWV 52) and <b>as</b> <b>a</b> chorale <b>prelude</b> for organ (BuxWV 197) c. 1690.|$|R
5000|$|The penitential text, {{written in}} the Nuremberg of Hans Sachs and the Meistersingers where Spengler was town clerk, is {{concerned}} with [...] "human misery and ruin," [...] faith and redemption; it encapsulates some of the central tenets of the Lutheran Reformation. The melody, originally for a Reformation battle hymn of 1525, was first published with Spenglers text in 1535. Bach previously set it <b>as</b> <b>a</b> chorale <b>prelude</b> in the Kirnberger Collection (BWV 705) and Neumeister Collection (BWV 1101); the seventh verse also recurs in the closing chorales of cantatas BWV 18 and BWV 109. Dieterich Buxtehude had already set the hymn <b>as</b> <b>a</b> chorale <b>prelude</b> (BuxWV 183) prior to Bach.|$|R
50|$|While largely {{unchanged}} {{from the}} De Guzmán arrangement, the song has renditions by different composers and singers, notably by Lucio D. San Pedro (National Artist for music), Asin, and Freddie Aguilar. Aguilar's cover {{is one of}} the most famous renditions of the song; an often overlooked detail is that the instrumental section of this version is Pilipinas Kong Mahal, another Filipino patriotic song. Asin's rendition included another de Jesús work, Kay Sarap Mabuhay Sa Sariling Bayan, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>preluding</b> stanza to the main lyrics. Sung mostly by Leftist groups, the stanza is included as the bridge replacing Pilipinas Kong Mahal with the prelude of Ang Bayan kong Hirang.|$|R
5|$|Panofsky {{was one of}} {{the first}} art historians to abandon formalism. He built on Friedländer's {{attempts}} at attribution, but focused more on social history and religious iconography. Panofsky developed the terminology with which the Netherlandish paintings are usually described, and made significant advances identifying the rich religious symbolism especially of the major altarpieces. Panofsky was the first scholar to connect the work of Netherlandish painters and illuminators, noticing the considerable overlap. He considered the study of manuscripts to be integral to the study of panels, though in the end came to view illumination as less significant than panel painting – <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>prelude</b> to the truly significant work of the northern artists of the 15th and 16th centuries.|$|E
5|$|Pitt's {{administration}} {{took the}} guilty verdict in Paine's trial {{as a sign}} that further prosecutions for sedition were possible, and began many. In the 17 months following the trial, 11 publishers of the Rights of Man were prosecuted, receiving prison sentences of up to 4 years. These acted <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>prelude</b> to the 1794 Treason Trials, in which a dozen reformers were indicted for allegedly conspiring to bring about a revolution. Erskine played a prominent role in defending many of them, including Thomas Hardy, John Horne Tooke and John Thelwall, all three of whom were acquitted.|$|E
5|$|The American {{command in}} Saigon and the {{politicians}} in Washington were opposed to a wet season Hmong offensive, supporting instead a holding action {{on the edge of}} the Plain of Jars <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>prelude</b> to a possible cease-fire. Washington also insisted that U.S. airpower be used to interdict PAVN supply lines, not as close air support for ground operations. Vang Pao took up the offensive anyway, but his forces could only occupy half of the Plain before his offensive sputtered out at the end of July.|$|E
5000|$|The {{demand that}} Kosovo become the seventh {{republic}} of Yugoslavia was politically unacceptable to Serbia and the Socialist Republic of Macedonia. Some Serbs (and possibly some Albanian nationalists as well) saw the demands <b>as</b> being <b>a</b> <b>prelude</b> to <b>a</b> [...] "Greater Albania" [...] which could encompass parts of Montenegro, the Republic of Macedonia and Kosovo itself.|$|R
5000|$|The song is {{the second}} track on the album's second side, with the song [...] "Cinema" [...] serving <b>as</b> <b>a</b> form of <b>prelude.</b>|$|R
50|$|The conference {{resulted}} in a five-point statement that included a plea for ETA to renounce any armed activities and to demand instead negotiations with the Spanish and French authorities to end the conflict. It was seen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> possible <b>prelude</b> {{to the end of}} ETA's violent campaign for an independent Basque homeland.|$|R
5|$|The Third Perso-Turkic War was {{the third}} and final {{conflict}} between the Sassanian Empire and the Western Turkic Khaganate. Unlike the previous two wars, it was not fought in Central Asia, but in Transcaucasia. Hostilities were initiated in 627 AD by Khagan Tong Yabghu of the Western Göktürks and Emperor Heraclius of the Eastern Roman Empire. Opposing them were the Sassanid Persians, allied with the Pannonian Avars. The war was fought against the background of the last Byzantine-Sassanid War and served <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>prelude</b> to the dramatic events that changed the balance of powers in the Middle East for centuries to come (Battle of Nineveh, Islamic conquest of Persia).|$|E
5|$|The {{dictator}} of Paraguay, Francisco Solano López, {{took advantage}} of the Uruguayan situation during late 1864 to establish his nation as a regional power. On 11 November of that year, he ordered a Brazilian civilian steamship seized, triggering the Paraguayan War. Then in December, the Paraguayan army invaded the Brazilian province of Mato Grosso (currently the state of Mato Grosso do Sul). Four months later, Paraguayan troops invaded Argentine territory <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>prelude</b> to an attack upon the Brazilian province of Rio Grande do Sul.|$|E
5|$|American {{shipwreck}} hunter David Mearns {{first learned}} of the battle in 1996, and began to study it <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>prelude</b> to {{a search for the}} ships in 2001. Mearns, with the aid of other researchers, focused on primary sources (rediscovering several archive files and diaries in the process), and {{came to the conclusion that}} the German accounts were true, and that the ship would be found at the northern position. After attracting the interest of the RAN, Mearns entered into a partnership with HMAS Sydney Search, a not-for-profit company set up to administer and help fund an expedition to locate Sydney and Kormoran. State and Federal government grants totalling just under A$5 million, coupled with private and corporate donations, were used to fund a 45-day search from the end of February to early April 2008.|$|E
5000|$|Numerous composers {{used the}} hymn tune, some also the text. There are choral {{settings}} by Orlando di Lasso, Michael Praetorius and Samuel Scheidt. Johann Ulrich Steigleder composed 40 three-part {{variations on the}} hymn tune and published them <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Tabulaturbuch in Strasbourg in 1627. Amongst those who set it <b>as</b> <b>a</b> chorale <b>prelude</b> for organ are Michael Praetorius, Jacob Praetorius, Samuel Scheidt and Heinrich Scheidemann. Johann Pachelbel included <b>a</b> chorale <b>prelude</b> in his liturgical collection Erster Theil etlicher Choräle.|$|R
50|$|De-policing is an Americanism for {{a police}} {{industrial}} action strategy {{of a work}} place slowdown. A slowdown is an industrial action in which employees perform their duties but seek to reduce productivity or efficiency in their performance of these duties. A slowdown may be used <b>as</b> either <b>a</b> <b>prelude</b> or <b>an</b> alternative to <b>a</b> strike, <b>as</b> {{it is seen as}} less disruptive as well as less risky and costly for workers and their union.|$|R
50|$|The {{first and}} last {{movement}} serve <b>as</b> <b>a</b> brief <b>prelude</b> and postlude respectively. The middle two movements comprise the main bulk of the concerto. The andante is more reflective and expands with a romantic greatness. The sarcastic Moderato is in modified sonata-form. The concerto has an unusual ending, with the piano running up pianissimo to a very high B-flat7.|$|R
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>prelude</b> to his planned {{campaign}} in Greece, Philip went on {{campaign in}} the winter of 339 BC, against the Scythians living south of the Danube, near the river's mouth (in Dobruja). He defeated them in battle, taking many captive, and built a statue of Heracles to commemorate his victory. He then marched through the territory of the Triballi in a demonstration of force, which probably lay upstream along the course of the Danube. During a skirmish, he was severely wounded in the leg when a spear passed through it and killed the horse he was riding. Recovering from this wound may have delayed Philip's campaign in Greece, since he did not set off until the autumn of 339 BC.|$|E
5|$|As {{war with}} the British Empire threatened, Brazil had to turn its {{attention}} to its southern frontiers. Another civil war had begun in Uruguay as its political parties turned against each other. The internal conflict led {{to the murder of}} Brazilians and looting of their property in Uruguay. Brazil's government decided to intervene, fearful of giving any impression of weakness in the face of conflict with the British. A Brazilian army invaded Uruguay in December 1864, beginning the brief Uruguayan War, which ended in February 1865. Meanwhile, the dictator of Paraguay, Francisco Solano López took advantage of the situation to establish his country as a regional power. The Paraguayan army invaded the Brazilian province of Mato Grosso (the area known after 1977 as the state of Mato Grosso do Sul), triggering the Paraguayan War. Four months later, Paraguayan troops invaded Argentine territory <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>prelude</b> to an attack on Rio Grande do Sul.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other members}} of its family, the night shark is viviparous: once the {{developing}} embryos exhaust their supply of yolk, the depleted yolk sac is converted into a placental connection through which the mother delivers nourishment. Adult females have a single functional ovary (on the right) and two functional uteruses, which are divided into separate compartments for each embryo. Within the uterus the embryos lie lengthwise with their heads pointing {{the same direction as}} their mother. Most information known about the night shark's life history comes from the subpopulation off northeastern Brazil, and may not hold true {{in other parts of the}} species range. Northeastern Brazilian sharks mate throughout the summer, with the males biting at the female's body and fins <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>prelude</b> to copulation.|$|E
50|$|A tie-in novel, Star Wars Battlefront II: Inferno Squad, was {{released}} on July 25, 2017. Written by Christie Golden, it serves <b>as</b> <b>a</b> direct <b>prelude</b> to the game and follows the exploits of the Galactic Empire's titular squad as it seeks to eliminate {{what was left of}} Saw Gerrera's rebel cell after the events of the 2016 film Rogue One.|$|R
50|$|Most critics {{agree that}} Cousin Phillis is Gaskell's {{crowning}} {{achievement in the}} short novel. The story is uncomplicated; its virtues are {{in the manner of}} its development and telling. Cousin Phillis is also recognized <b>as</b> <b>a</b> fitting <b>prelude</b> for Gaskell's final and most widely acclaimed novel, Wives and Daughters, which ran in Cornhill Magazine from August 1864 to January 1866.|$|R
5000|$|The Gully Dwarves (June 1996), by Dan Parkinson, (...) , Note: Continues {{the short}} story [...] "The Promised Place" [...] from The War of the Lance. The {{connected}} short stories [...] "Off Day" [...] and [...] "Ogre Unaware" [...] from The Reign of Istar and The Cataclysm respectively serve <b>as</b> <b>an</b> indirect <b>prelude</b> to the The Promised Place and The Gully Dwarves.|$|R
5|$|Like other requiem sharks, {{the nervous}} shark is viviparous: once the embryos exhaust their initial supply of yolk, they are {{provisioned}} {{by the mother}} through a placental connection formed from the depleted yolk sac. Adult females have a single functional ovary, on the right, and two functional uteruses. The male bites {{at the sides of}} the female <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>prelude</b> to mating. After mating, the female stores the sperm for approximately four weeks prior to fertilization. In Darwin Harbor, mating occurs from January to March and birthing occurs in October and November following a gestation period of eight to nine months. In Shark Bay, mating occurs from late October to early November and birthing occurs around the same time the following year, following a gestation period of 11 months; this slower development likely reflects the cooler temperatures of Shark Bay.|$|E
5|$|Scott's Wabash Campaign was well-received both in Kentucky {{and by the}} Washington administration. On June 24, 1791, Arthur St. Clair {{encouraged}} the Board of War to organize a second expedition into the Wabash region and to remove their outposts along the Ohio River to free up manpower and finances <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>prelude</b> to his larger invasion. Scott questioned the wisdom of removing the outposts and convinced his fellow members of the Board of War to retain one at Big Bone Lick and one guarding an ironworks {{at the mouth of}} the Kentucky River. His instincts later proved to be right; a month later, Indian raiders tried to deny the frontier settlers access to salt by capturing Big Bone Lick, but they were repelled by the militia stationed at the outpost there. Scott also did not believe that 500 men, St. Clair's requested number for the second Wabash expedition, was sufficient for an effective operation.|$|E
5|$|The Molossian {{kingdom of}} Epirus {{had been an}} {{important}} subject ally of Macedon since 350 BC, when Philip had taken the son of king Arybbas, Alexander hostage. During this time at court, Alexander (brother of Philip's wife Olympias), had grown into an admirer of Philip, and Philip therefore decided to replace Arybbas with Alexander. The exact date this occurred is unclear; Cawkwell suggests this happened in early 342 BC, when Alexander would have been 20, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>prelude</b> to his Thracian campaign. Arybbas went into exile in Athens, where he was promised help to regain his kingdom; however, Alexander would remain on the throne (and loyal to Philip) {{until his death in}} 334 BC. Philip certainly campaigned against the Epirote Cassopaeans in early 342 BC, taking control of three cities to secure the southern regions of his kingdom.|$|E
5000|$|The chorale [...] "Wie schön leuchtet der Morgenstern", {{associated}} variously with Epiphany, Whit, Annunciation, and Sundays after Trinity, is set by Pachelbel <b>as</b> <b>a</b> three-voice <b>prelude</b> {{with the}} chorale in the bass voice. Pachelbel uses fore-imitation throughout the piece: whenever the next phrase of the chorale {{is about to}} begin, the upper voices anticipate its melodic contour in brief imitative passages.|$|R
5000|$|Although, {{with its}} {{references}} to the Holy Spirit, the hymn has relevance to Pentecost, its customary use in Sunday services almost certainly prompted Bach to compose several settings (BWV 622, BWV 655, BWV 709, BWV 726 and BWV 749). Johann Gottfried Walther, Bachs distant cousin and the organist in the Stadtkirche in Weimar, also set the hymn <b>as</b> <b>a</b> chorale <b>prelude</b> and <b>as</b> <b>a</b> partita with many variations.|$|R
5000|$|The novel {{has been}} {{described}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> [...] "Wagnerian <b>prelude</b> for <b>an</b> unplayed opera" [...] as it doesn't focus on telling a story but {{is first and foremost}} concerned with creating a mysterious, out-of-time atmosphere.|$|R
