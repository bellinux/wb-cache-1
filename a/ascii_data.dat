To realize the system, a data communication monitoring is needed between ground station and transponder so the user can monitor whether the data communication has been processed or not. In this final project, as the trial for transceiver and transponder, used two transceivers Adeunis Radio Frequency (ARF) 7429 B that will communicate each other as a secondary radar system. The communication of ARF 7429 B is <b>ASCII</b> character <b>data</b> communication.

This data sent and received in ARF transmitter that will compared with data received and sent in ARF receiver. The result of this final project showed that the data can be sent and received successfully even though the limit of software for sending one character. From the data signal monitoring, there is a delay between data sent and data received. Hopefully for future research, this delay time can be used for detecting position and distance of transponder as the application of secondary radar system.

50|$|IEC 61107 is a {{communication}} protocol for smart meters {{published by the}} IEC that is widely used for utility meters in the European Union. It is superseded by IEC 62056, but remains in wide use because it is simple and well-accepted. It sends <b>ASCII</b> <b>data</b> using a serial port. The physical media are either modulated light, sent with an LED and received with a photodiode, or a pair of wires, usually modulated by EIA-485. The protocol is half-duplex. IEC 61107 is related to, and sometimes wrongly confused with, the FLAG protocol. Ferranti and Landis+Gyr were early proponents of an interface standard that eventually became a sub-set of IEC1107.|$|E

5000|$|This {{left the}} problem of sending the <b>ASCII</b> <b>data</b> to the printer. While a serial port does so with the minimum of pins and wires, it {{requires}} the device to buffer up the data as it arrives bit by bit and turn it back into multi-bit values. A parallel port makes this simpler, the entire ASCII value is presented on the pins in complete form. In addition to the seven data pins, the system also needed various control pins as well as electrical grounds. Wang happened to have a surplus stock of 20,000 Amphenol 36-pin micro ribbon connectors that were originally used for one of their early calculators. The interface only required 21 of these pins, the rest were grounded or not connected.
