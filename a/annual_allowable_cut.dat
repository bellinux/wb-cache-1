40|$|AbstractAppropriate cutting {{cycles and}} <b>annual</b> <b>allowable</b> <b>cuts</b> {{are crucial to}} ensure {{sustainability}} of tropical selective logging, {{but there have been}} limited field data to verify long-term effects of different cutting cycles. This study reveals some evidence of forest degradation in selectively logged production forests of Myanmar, which are subject to inappropriate cutting frequency. We compared stand structure, commercial species composition, and incidence of illegal logging between two compartments with low (LCF; 1 time) and high (HCF; 5 times) cutting frequency over a recent 18 years. Prior to the latest cutting, LCF had 176 trees ha− 1 with an inverted-J shape distribution of diameter at breast height (DBH), including a substantial amount of teak (Tectona grandis) and other commercially important species in each DBH class. HCF prior to the latest cut had only 41 trees ha− 1 without many commercially important species. At HCF, nearly half the standing trees of various species and size were illegally cut following legal operations; this was for charcoal making in nearby kilns. At LCF, two species, teak and Xylia xylocarpa, were cut illegally and sawn for timber on the spot. More extensive and systematic surveys are needed to generalize the findings of forest degradation and illegal logging. However, our study calls for urgent reconsideration of logging practices with high cutting frequency, which can greatly degrade forests with accompanying illegal logging, and for rehabilitating strongly degraded, bamboo-dominated forests. To reduce illegal logging, it would be important to pay more attention on a MSS regulation stating that logging roads should be destroyed after logging operations...|$|R
30|$|As {{complementary}} {{resource use}} {{is the main}} cause of additional production, the most promising approach for enhancing volume (biomass) production is the mixing of light-demanding with shade-tolerant species, shallow-rooting with deep-rooting species, fast-growing with slow-growin or deciduous with evergreen species. The benefit of mixing may change with site conditions, however, as it likely depends on the potential of the species assemblage to compensate for the respective growth limiting factor of a given site. Thus, on moist and fertile sites, where light is the limiting factor, combinations of light-demanding and shade-tolerant species may be most beneficial. On dry and nutrient poor sites, in contrast, combinations of deep- and shallow-rooting species may remedy the soil-based resource limitations. Although reported overyielding in volume growth of about 10 – 30 % for commercial tree species in temperate and boreal zones appear moderate in comparison to overyielding of up to 50 % found in the subtropics and tropics and for atmospheric nitrogen fixing tree species (Forrester et al. 2006, 2007, Kelty 1992), they are nevertheless highly relevant because they can be obtained simply by a smart mixing design. In contrast, the benefits derived from thinning are often lower and require repeated silvicultural entries (Assmann 1970). Overyielding represents a higher efficiency of space use in that a given area of mixed stands yields more stem wood volume and fixes and stores more carbon than equivalent areas of monospecific stands. Of special interest for forest practitioners are mixed-species stands achieving transgressive overyielding, which could result in gains of up to 30 % if the tree species mixture is complementary (Pretzsch and Forrester 2017). As a consequence, <b>annual</b> <b>allowable</b> <b>cuts,</b> and the volumes removed and remaining standing, may change compared with monocultures.|$|R

40|$|A new {{approach}} to calculating parameters of the <b>annual</b> <b>allowable</b> <b>cut</b> for sustainable forest management in mature and over-mature exploitable forests and computer-based programs, developed on its base that allows to calculate {{the parameters of the}} <b>annual</b> <b>allowable</b> <b>cut</b> for sustainable forest management in these forests for a predetermined number of years are presented. The proposed approach is based on the simulation model of the age structure dynamics of the stand – from initial age classes of ("sapling stands ") to older ones ("mature stands"). The advantage of the proposed approach is that the procedure and the results of simulation are independent of any predefined formulas for calculating the allowable cut, thus {{it can be used to}} calculate allowable cut for exploitable forests with a variable initial age structure and intensity of forest management. Unlike currently applied formulas of the <b>annual</b> <b>allowable</b> <b>cut,</b> based on the thought model of the depletion of over-mature, mature, ripening and other stands in certain time, the simulation model enables to calculate in detail the process for all different age groups of trees.

40|$|Graduation date: 1986 The Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974 {{requires}} the U. S. Forest Service to periodically evaluate the U. S. timber situation. An {{important part of}} such studies is the determination of forest product imports from Canada through evaluation of Canadian log and product supply conditions. Other studies have projected these conditions for Canada as a whole, but have failed to directly consider either the impacts of forest resource characteristics on costs or the capability of Canadian forests to meet predicted harvests. 	This study develops procedures for projecting Canadian log and lumber production costs that explicitly consider resource characteristics and location through the identification of fifteen Timber Supply Regions expected to have relatively uniform logging conditions and the estimation of log and lumber production costs {{for each of these}} regions. Cost projections are linked to general economic conditions in Canada through estimation of labor costs as functions of gross national product. This study also evaluates the capability of the forest resource to meet predicted timber requirements. Achievable levels of production of four forest product groups are determined by comparing predicted harvest levels with estimates of economically accessible <b>annual</b> <b>allowable</b> <b>cuts</b> and reducing projected production levels when accessible timber supplies are limiting. 	A baseline simulation from 1980 to 2030 indicates that future log and lumber production costs in Canada may be less than previously projected and the predicted increases in production may no be attainable because of limited timber supplies. Gross sawmilling costs are projected to increase from 99. 88 /MBF in 1980 to 4123. 66 /MBF in 2030. These costs range from 15 /MBF to 65 /MBF lower than those used in TAMM, largely due to different estimates of delivered wood costs. Harvests increased from 50. 2 million cunits to 73. 6 million cunits but were unable to meet demands from 1984 to 2030 with shortfall reaching 13. 5 million cunits in 2030.

40|$|Crisis in {{supplying}} {{regions and}} the country related to available forest resources and low profitability of forest sector, as a whole, is an indicator of failure of the existing model of forest management and forest use organization in Russia at the present time. Many Russian regions, which are traditionally considered as forest industrial territories, {{face the challenge of}} lack of economically accessible forests. The forests are decreasing against a background of under exploitation of the <b>annual</b> <b>allowable</b> <b>cut.</b> This situation occurs in Siberia as well. In many cases, using calculated allowable cut will result in unsustainable harvest levels and a future decrease of accessible forest resources. Thus, the statement that «a volume of wood resource utilization is determined by allowable cut represented the scientifically grounded norm of sustainable forest use» is considered as no more than the declarative proposition. Modeling the normal forest, and using a formula of allowable cut calculation estimated for some decades based on the modeling, is totally unreliable and unreal. The long-term forecast should use analog methods, but it will hardly be sufficiently accurate and adequate to set norms. In order to estimate ecological and economic accessibility of forest resources, an algorithm was made, and a method and model were developed. This model is based on GIS-database and makes it possible to estimate accessibility of forest resources and to map it as well. The conclusion on necessity to determine <b>annual</b> <b>allowable</b> <b>cut</b> in two varieties was drawn following the procedures for calculating <b>annual</b> <b>allowable</b> <b>cut.</b> The first variety is silvicultural (according the currently used methods) and the other one is economically accessible allowable cut, which could provide economic effective use of tradable mature wood, taking in to account ecological and economic accessibility of forest resources...|$|E

Study of forest fund dynamics for a long-term period of time is an important indicator. Thus, the Krasnoyarsk forest dynamics for the last 50 years (1961 – 2011) shows extensive development of the regional forest complex.

Based upon a verified hypothesis, it is argued that, although partially a historical residue, trust can be established between actors with diverging self-interests. Conclusively, it is assumed that the actors of the industry themselves must participate in the establishment of trust, while the role of political institutions, such as the state, should be to provide the legal instruments necessary to protect the individual actor's own right to pursue his self-interest, in brief, to provide the constituents of a democratic system that can promote economic development. ...|$|E

Former Boksitogorsky, Tihvinsky and Sugozersky leshoses in the Tihvin and Boksitogorsk administrative districts have been selected for analysis. There are possibilities for intensification of forest resources utilisation in the region, as <b>annual</b> <b>allowable</b> <b>cut</b> and intermediate fellings are not fully used. Actual available volume of energy wood generated by fellings in the region is 424, 000 m³ yr>. Full utilisation of <b>annual</b> <b>allowable</b> <b>cut</b> would increase volume of available energy wood up to 637, 000 m³ yr - 1 or + 50 %. If also intermediate fellings are entirely utilised, available volume of energy wood could be increased up to 774, 000 m³ yr - 1 or + 83 % to actual available volume. Productivity and costs of cut-to-lenth, tree length, full tree and tree section harvesting methods in the 1 st and 2 nd commercial thinnings and in final fellings with the transport of energy wood up to 100 km were analysed. The supply systems based on manual felling in thinnings have lower costs of energy wood compared to the supply systems which utilise harvesters. Utilisation of harvesters becomes more feasible for final felling, where high productivity allows the cut-to-length method to be more efficient compared to the full tree and tree length methods with manual felling. Costs of energy wood harvesting per energy unit are competitive with the price of electricity and light oil as primary energy sources. Wood fuels can compete with the price of heavy oil in the case of short transporting distances up to 50 km.

The level of {{the potential}} <b>allowable</b> <b>cut</b> was compared to the cutting budgets based on the 7 th and 8 th National Forest Inventories (NFI 7 and NFI 8), to the combining of private forestry plans, and to the realized drain from non-industrial private forests. The potential <b>allowable</b> <b>cut</b> was calculated using the same MELA system as has been used in the calculation of the national cutting budget. The data consisted of the NIPF holdings (from the TASO planning system) that had been inventoried compartmentwise and had forestry plans made during the years 1984 - 1992. The NIPF landowners' choices of timber management strategies were clarified by a two-phase mail inquiry. The most preferred strategy obtained was "sustainability" (chosen by 62 % of landowners). The second in order of preference was "finance" (17 %) and the third was "saving" (11 %). "No cuttings", and "maximum cuttings" were the least preferred (9 % and 1 %, resp.). The factors promoting the choices of strategies with intensive cuttings were a) "farmer as forest owner" and "owning fields", b) "increase {{in the size of the}} forest holding", c) agriculture and forestry orientation in production, d) "decreasing short term stumpage earning expectations", e) "increasing intensity of future cuttings", and f) "choice of forest taxation system based on site productivity". The potential <b>allowable</b> <b>cut</b> defined in the study was 20 % higher than the average of the realized drain during the years 1988 - 1993, which in turn, was at the same level as the cutting budget based on the combining of forestry plans in eastern Finland. Respectively, the potential <b>allowable</b> <b>cut</b> defined in the study was 12 % lower than the NFI 8 -based greatest sustained <b>allowable</b> <b>cut</b> for the 1990 s. Using the method presented in this study, timber management strategies can be clarified for non-industrial private forest landowners in different parts of Finland. Based on the choices of timber managemet strategies, regular cutting budgets can be calculated more realistically than before...|$|R
40|$|The paper debriefs {{the current}} debates {{on the forest}} {{management}} and forest policy where environmental NGOs and logging companies are fighting: one the one hand, NGOs intervene in many technical {{issues related to the}} forest management planning and applied forestry where their expertise is patchy and, on the other hand, the logging companies accuse the nature protection measures, some of them adopted in due time, like the ones related to Natura 2000 network, where the management plans have been approved and endorsed. Since the stakes are very high the unprofessional messages delivered by many NGOs do not receive technically correct replies from the forest managers either because they are not able to communicate in simple words or simply because they are afraid of being labeled timber thieves: this defenseless attitude is not appropriate at all because the media is still talking about illegal clearfellings in spite of the very tough preventive measures undertaken by the Forest guards. Most of the allegations of illegal cuttings rest on the volume estimated by the NFI (the difference between the total yield and the <b>allowable</b> <b>cut)</b> while the same NFI allegedly gives high hopes for even higher <b>allowable</b> <b>cut</b> due to the first estimation of the total growth. The fake news here is that the total growth refers to the whole forest area, while the <b>allowable</b> <b>cut</b> refers to commercial forests only: there is no hint in the total growth unless the aggregated figure is not split into the two types of forests: commercial and not commercial (i. e. strictly protected forest areas). The core message delivered by the article is addressed to the management planning system, in charge with setting up the <b>allowable</b> <b>cut</b> and the cutting budgets. Some differences between the private forests and the public forests shall be made sensible in terms of maturity ages when stands of trees are to be harvested. However, it is also explained that reducing the forest rotation with 20 or even 40 years will not skyrocket the <b>allowable</b> <b>cut</b> because the reference level of the normal age class goes up and the overplus of harvestable wood will be used to compensate larger deficits brought about by the un-even actual age structure and the higher normal age class. The coppice with standards is also supported as a technical solution for harvesting more fuel wood for rural population...|$|R
