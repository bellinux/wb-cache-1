However, neither the particle size can reach the nanoscale, nor are the shapes uniform. LF-FSP directly produces nanopowders that are not possible via grinding. Uniform particle size distributions are obtained using LF-FSP {{as it is a}} vapor phase process.

30|$|In this study, {{low-temperature}} hydrogen bubbling (LTHB) {{was conducted}} to prepare Pt/reduced graphene oxide (RGO) with enhanced durability by the effect of self-catalyzed dehydration of the functional group. LTHB effectively removed the functional groups without the <b>agglomeration</b> <b>of</b> Pt <b>particles.</b> The LTHB-treated Pt/RGO showed highly improved long-term durability compared to the nontreated Pt/RGO after an accelerated durability test for 2  h, because <b>of</b> the less <b>agglomeration</b> <b>of</b> Pt <b>particles.</b> As the LTHB time increased, the long-term durability was improved. The physical and electrochemical characteristics of the fabricated catalysts were examined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry (CV), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) measurements.|$|R

30|$|The tensile {{strength}} and modulus of the composites using MCM- 41 as filler were remarkably {{higher than that}} of MCF and SBA. It {{may be due to the}} peculiar properties of MCM- 41 like, highly ordered periodic arrays of uniformly sized channels, narrow pore size distribution and long-range ordering. In the synthesis of polymer nanocomposite, <b>agglomeration</b> <b>of</b> <b>particles</b> or fillers is a major issue. Here also from the BET analysis, it is profoundly clear that SBA- 15 is having a high surface area in comparison with MCM- 41 which consequences the <b>agglomeration</b> <b>of</b> <b>particles,</b> end up with a drop in the {{tensile strength}} value. When the filler particles have very higher surface area, the filler–filler interaction increases and it would be higher than the polymer-filler interaction. At this point the particles will try to agglomerate and it will be difficult to be dispersed. The agglomerates of MCF fillers are visible in the SEM image of BR-MCF- 10, which shows minimum property improvement among the three types of MPSs (Fig.  5 c).

It is perceived that the addition of lime to the jarosite, results in agglomeration. This <b>agglomeration</b> <b>of</b> <b>particles</b> is attributed to the active/free aluminous and silicious minerals present in jarosite reacting with calcium found in lime to produce calcium silicates hydrate [C–S–H] and calcium aluminates hydrate [C–A–H] bonds.|$|E

40|$|In {{fluidized}} {{beds and}} pneumatic conveyors triboelectric charging is generally an undesirable phenomenon, as it causes <b>agglomeration</b> <b>of</b> charged <b>particles</b> on the walls. At worst, <b>agglomeration</b> <b>of</b> the <b>particles</b> and other side-effects of triboelectric charging {{can reduce the}} performance of a fluidized bed or a conveyor significantly. In the thesis, a triboelectric charging model built onto a CFD-DEM (Computational Fluid Dynamics-Discrete Element Method) model is utilized for simulating a small fluidized bed <b>of</b> monodisperse <b>particles.</b> In the model, charge transfer is governed by the effective work function difference between the particles and the wall. The simulation results are compared to experimental results measured in relative humidities ranging from 0 % to 60 %. It is found that the simulations capture qualitatively the most appreciable side-effect of triboelectric charging, as a layer <b>of</b> strongly charged <b>particles</b> is adhered to the wall. However, this phenomenon is not as pronounced as in the experiments, where multiple layers <b>of</b> <b>particles</b> agglomerate on the wall. This discrepancy between the simulations and the experiments reflects to other aspects as well: for example the pressure drop over a simulated bed shows almost no change during the fluidization, while in the experiments a significant decrease in pressure drop is observed due to particle agglomeration. For more realistic results, the <b>agglomeration</b> <b>of</b> the <b>particles</b> should be better captured by the computational model...|$|R

40|$|The {{preliminary}} laboratory-scale {{development of}} a gas-promoted, oil agglomeration process for cleaning coal advanced in three major research areas.

30|$|It is {{interesting}} to note that whereas the diluted filtrate had little toxicity, diluted unfiltered dispersions were toxic. This apparent contradiction reflects differences in the way samples below the highest test concentration were prepared. Each TiO 2 dispersion was prepared separately from powder, and the shape of the saturation curve (see Figs. 3 and 4) suggests there was a surplus of the smaller nanoparticles responsible for toxicity. In contrast, the diluted filtrates were prepared by serially diluting the sample with the highest test concentration, resulting in a concomitant reduction in the concentration of smaller, more toxic nanoparticles.
