5|$|A Miranda warning is an {{explanation}} of a suspect's rights that must be given by law enforcement before interrogation. It stems from the 1966 Miranda v. Arizona case, and is based primarily on the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. If <b>a</b> <b>defendant</b> <b>in</b> custody is not notified of their rights via a Miranda warning, any confession they give may not be admissible in court. If a defendant is not in police custody, however, police are free to question suspects without informing them of their rights, and their statements may still be admissible.|$|E
5|$|After the event, in {{response}} to Owen Hart's death, the WWF canceled the encore presentation of Over the Edge via pay-per-view, and they also canceled four live events in Canada and one in Illinois. Information about Over the Edge from the WWF (now named the WWE) is sparse because the event was never released on VHS or DVD due to Hart's death. In 2014, the event was shown in an edited form on the WWE Network. On May 24, 1999, the day following this event, a tribute to Hart was held on Raw is War in St. Louis, which the WWF called Raw is Owen. For this show, all storylines and rivalries were stopped, and wrestlers were given the option to wrestle or not. The show also featured interviews and testimonies from his coworkers and highlights of his professional wrestling career. Hart's funeral service was held on May 31, 1999, in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, and it was attended by family members, friends, and over 300 wrestlers who were acquainted with him. Following the funeral, Hart was buried in Calgary's Queens Park Cemetery later that day. Three weeks after the event, his widow, children, and parents sued the WWF for causing Owen's death with a poorly planned stunt; they claimed that the harness system was defective. After the court case had extended one-and-a-half years, a settlement was reached on November 2, 2000, when the WWF agreed to pay his widow, children, and parents US$18million. The manufacturer of the harness system had also been named as <b>a</b> <b>defendant</b> <b>in</b> the case but was dismissed from the case after the settlement was reached.|$|E
5|$|In June 2008, Apple {{was named}} among others as <b>a</b> <b>defendant</b> <b>in</b> a suit brought by {{plaintiff}} Typhoon Touch Technologies {{in the federal}} U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging patent infringement in portable touch screen technology. The suit illustrated the vagaries of litigating patent licensing and royalty collection issues in the commercial exploitation of intellectual property rights. Ultimately, Typhoon could not prevail against patent defense arguments of prior art and obviousness and earned itself {{a reputation as a}} patent troll. Typhoon acquired two pre-existing patents, (filed in 1993 and 1994 and issued in 1995 and 1997), in mid-2007 for $350,000 plus a percentage of collected licensing fees. The patents had languished for some time and were not being policed; shortly after Typhoon acquired the patents, it began enforcement by bringing suit against exploiters of the technology who had not paid licensing fees. Typhoon was successful in its patent infringement suits against some small companies, and then expanded its litigation to go after larger ones. Typhoon alleged that Apple and others used its patented technology inventions without permission. Typhoon originally filed the suit in December 2007 against Dell after settling with some smaller companies but, in mid-2008, amended its complaint to add Apple, Fujitsu, Toshiba, Lenovo, Panasonic, HTC, Palm, Samsung, Nokia, and LG. In 2010, Apple settled with Typhoon for an undisclosed sum and was then dismissed from the litigation as of September 2010. The other large companies were able to rebuff Typhoon's claims, and Typhoon ceased doing business in 2008 after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) suspended its trading in a fraud investigation.|$|E

25|$|Deck v. Missouri, , was a United States Supreme Court {{case that}} dealt with the {{constitutionality}} of shackling a prisoner during the sentencing phase of a trial.

25|$|Miranda v. Arizona, , was a {{landmark}} {{decision of the}} United States Supreme Court. In a 5–4 majority, the Court held that both inculpatory and exculpatory statements made in response to interrogation by <b>a</b> <b>defendant</b> <b>in</b> police custody will be admissible at trial only if the prosecution can show that the defendant was informed {{of the right to}} consult with an attorney before and during questioning and of the right against self-incrimination before police questioning, and that the defendant not only understood these rights, but voluntarily waived them.|$|E
25|$|The inquisitorial trial {{generally}} {{favored the}} prosecution (the Church). Confessing 'in full' {{was the best}} hope of receiving a lighter punishment - but with little hope of escaping at least some punishment. And a 'full' confession was one which implicated others, including other family members. It was acceptable to take testimony from criminals, persons of bad reputation, excommunicated people, and convicted heretics. The inquisitor could keep <b>a</b> <b>defendant</b> <b>in</b> prison for years before the trial to obtain new information, and could return them to prison if {{he felt that the}} witness had not fully confessed.|$|E
25|$|Both {{in common}} law and in civil law, a rebuttable {{presumption}} (in Latin, praesumptio iuris tantum) is an assumption {{made by a}} court, one that is taken to be true unless someone comes forward to contest it and prove otherwise. For example, <b>a</b> <b>defendant</b> <b>in</b> a criminal case is presumed innocent until proved guilty. According to law, in an International child abduction the left behind parent is legally the only victim, {{if the child is}} not returned before child custody ends at age 18. This is because child custody does not {{have anything to do with}} children’s rights or welfare only parental rights.|$|E

In separate action, a negligence claim was lodged in the ACT Supreme Court for damages against the NSW and Australian Capital Territory governments resulting from the 2003 Canberra bushfires. Koperberg was listed as <b>a</b> <b>defendant</b> <b>in</b> the Canberra bushfires legal proceedings in which the appellant claimed that he called the NSW Rural Fire Service Fire Control Centre 24 times over ten days, but was ignored.

25|$|While in Berlin, Schopenhauer {{was named}} as <b>a</b> <b>defendant</b> <b>in</b> a lawsuit {{initiated}} {{by a woman}} named Caroline Marquet. She asked for damages, alleging that Schopenhauer had pushed her. According to Schopenhauer's court testimony, she deliberately annoyed him by raising her voice while standing right outside his door. Marquet alleged that the philosopher had assaulted and battered her after she refused to leave his doorway. Her companion testified that she saw Marquet prostrate outside his apartment. Because Marquet won the lawsuit, Schopenhauer made payments to her for the next twenty years. When she died, he wrote on a copy of her death certificate, Obit anus, abit onus ("The old woman dies, the burden is lifted"). In 1819 the fortunes {{of his mother and}} sister, and himself, were threatened by the failure of the firm in Danzig in which his father had been a director and shareholder.
