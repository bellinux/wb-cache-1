5|$|Despite these differences, {{the leading}} causes {{of death in the}} United States <b>are</b> <b>remarkably</b> similar for men and women, headed by heart disease, which {{accounts}} for a quarter of all deaths, followed by cancer, lung disease and stroke. While women have a lower incidence of death from unintentional injury (see below) and suicide, they have a higher incidence of dementia (Gronowski and Schindler, Table I).|$|E
5|$|Like all blackwater {{streams in}} Florida, {{the color of}} most of the St. Johns is black, owing to the tannins in leaf litter and {{decaying}} aquatic plants. Spring fed streams, on the other hand, <b>are</b> <b>remarkably</b> clear and visibility is very high, even when the river bottom is dozens of feet below.|$|E
5|$|Hartebeest <b>are</b> <b>remarkably</b> {{alert and}} {{cautious}} animals with highly developed brains. Generally calm in nature, hartebeest can be ferocious when provoked. While feeding, one individual {{stays on the}} lookout for danger, often standing on a termite mound to see farther. At times of danger, the whole herd flees in a single file after an individual suddenly starts off. Adult hartebeest are preyed upon by lions, leopards, hyenas and wild dogs; cheetahs and jackals target juveniles. Crocodiles may also prey on hartebeest.|$|E
5000|$|Egregious—Originally {{described}} {{something that}} <b>was</b> <b>remarkably</b> good. The word {{is from the}} Latin egregius [...] "illustrious, select", literally, [...] "standing out from the flock", which is from ex—"out of" [...] + greg—(grex) [...] "flock". Now it means something that <b>is</b> <b>remarkably</b> bad or flagrant.|$|R

5|$|There is no {{recorded}} {{information on the}} Lānai hookbill's breeding behavior. However, the other Hawaiian honeycreepers <b>are</b> <b>remarkably</b> uniform in their breeding behavior, and it is therefore likely that the hookbills also bred from early winter {{through the end of}} summer in August, with pair bonding being completed by January or February. The males likely defended a territory that moved along with his bonded female and became a centered around the nest after the female constructed it. It is hypothesized that the hookbill laid two to three eggs and that its young were altricial.|$|E
5|$|Nick's older sister, Gabrielle, {{became a}} {{successful}} {{film and television}} actress. Both parents were musically inclined and each wrote pieces of music. Recordings of Molly Drake's songs, which have come to light since her death, <b>are</b> <b>remarkably</b> similar in tone and outlook to the later work of her son. Mother and son shared a similar fragile vocal delivery; both Gabrielle and biographer Trevor Dann have noted a parallel sense of foreboding and fatalism in their music. Encouraged by his mother, Drake learned to play piano {{at an early age}} and began to compose songs which he recorded on a reel-to-reel tape recorder she kept in the family drawing room.|$|E
5|$|The {{rings of}} Neptune {{are made of}} {{extremely}} dark material, likely organic compounds processed by radiation, similar to that found in the rings of Uranus. The proportion of dust in the rings (between 20% and 70%) is high, while their optical depth is low to moderate, at less than 0.1. Uniquely, the Adams ring includes five distinct arcs, named Fraternité, Égalité 1 and 2, Liberté, and Courage. The arcs occupy a narrow range of orbital longitudes and <b>are</b> <b>remarkably</b> stable, having changed only slightly since their initial detection in 1980. How the arcs are stabilized is still under debate. However, their stability is probably related to the resonant interaction between the Adams ring and its inner shepherd moon, Galatea.|$|E

5|$|Spotted hyena {{societies}} {{are more complex}} than those of other carnivorous mammals, and <b>are</b> <b>remarkably</b> {{similar to those of}} cercopithecine primates in respect to group size, structure, competition and cooperation. Like cercopithecine primates, spotted hyenas use multiple sensory modalities, recognise individual conspecifics, are conscious that some clan-mates may be more reliable than others, recognise third-party kin and rank relationships among clan-mates, and adaptively use this knowledge during social decision making. Also, like cercopithecine primates, dominance ranks in hyena {{societies are}} not correlated with size or aggression, but with ally networks. In this latter trait, the spotted hyena further show parallels with primates by acquiring rank through coalition. However, rank reversals and overthrows in spotted hyena clans are very rare. The social network dynamics of spotted hyenas are determined by multiple factors. Environmental factors include rainfall and prey abundance; individual factors include preference to bond with females and with kin; and topological effects include the tendency to close triads in the network. Female hyenas are more flexible than males in their social bonding preferences.|$|E

40|$|Serum {{prolactin}} {{values in}} S-D strain female rats with DMBA induced mammary tumors were measured by double antibody radioimmunoassay. Serum prolactin values {{before and after}} resected DMBA induced tumors were similar, but serum prolactin values of ovariectomized rats <b>were</b> <b>remarkably</b> fallen with reduced tumors. Serum prolactin values after both ovariectomy and adrenalectomy followd by administration of cortisol <b>were</b> <b>remarkably</b> rised, but <b>were</b> reduced...|$|R

25|$|There is some {{evidence}} that he did this. Combining the calculations of Book 2 and the account of Theon of Smyrna yields a lunar distance of 60.5 earth radii. Doing the same with the account of Cleomedes yields a distance of 61 earth radii. These <b>are</b> <b>remarkably</b> close to both Ptolemy's value and the modern one.|$|E
25|$|Given {{the overall}} size of trade between Mexico and the United States, there <b>are</b> <b>remarkably</b> few trade disputes, {{involving}} relatively small dollar amounts. These disputes are generally settled in WTO or NAFTA panels or through {{negotiations between the}} two countries. The most significant areas of friction involve trucking, sugar, high-fructose corn syrup, {{and a number of}} other agricultural products.|$|E

25|$|Beyond the rabbinic community, Jewish apocalyptists also {{engaged in}} visionary exegeses {{concerning}} the divine realm and the divine creatures which <b>are</b> <b>remarkably</b> {{similar to the}} rabbinic material. A small number of texts unearthed at Qumran indicate that the Dead Sea community also engaged in merkabah exegesis. Recently uncovered Jewish mystical texts also evidence a deep affinity with the rabbinic merkabah homilies.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{isolated}} {{areas in}} the High Alleghenies are well known for their open expanses of sphagnum bogs and heath shrubs (e.g., Dolly Sods, Cranberry Glades). Many plant communities are indeed {{similar to those of}} sea-level eastern Canada. But the ecosystems within the Alleghenies <b>are</b> <b>remarkably</b> varied. In recent decades, the many stages of ecologic succession throughout the area have made the region one of enduring interest to botanists.|$|E
25|$|The Maya closely {{observed}} and duly recorded the seasonal markers. They prepared almanacs recording past and recent solar and lunar eclipses, the {{phases of the}} moon, the periods of Venus and Mars, the movements of various other planets, and conjunctions of celestial bodies. These almanacs also made future predictions concerning celestial events. These tables <b>are</b> <b>remarkably</b> accurate, given the technology available, and indicate a significant level of knowledge among Maya astronomers.|$|E

25|$|The extreme {{age of the}} {{landscape}} has meant that the soils <b>are</b> <b>remarkably</b> infertile and frequently laterised. Even soils derived from granitic bedrock contain {{an order of magnitude}} less available phosphorus and only half as much nitrogen as soils in comparable climates in other continents. Soils derived from extensive sandplains or ironstone are even less fertile, nearly devoid of soluble phosphate and deficient in zinc, copper, molybdenum and sometimes potassium and calcium.|$|E
25|$|Both the Eastern {{practice}} of alchemy and the later Western practice <b>are</b> <b>remarkably</b> similar in their methods and ultimate purpose. To be sure, {{the desire to}} create an elixir of immortality was more appealing to the Taoists, but European alchemists were not averse to seeking out formulas for various longevity-boosting substances. The secret of transmuting one element into another, specifically base metals into gold or silver, was equally explored by both schools for obvious reasons.|$|E
25|$|Cannas <b>are</b> <b>remarkably</b> free of diseases, {{compared}} to many genera. However, they may {{fall victim to}} canna rust, a fungus resulting in orange spots on the plant's leaves, caused by over moist soil. They are also susceptible to certain plant viruses, {{some of which are}} Canna-specific, which may result in spotted or streaked leaves, in a mild form, but can finally result in stunted growth and twisted and distorted blooms and foliage.|$|E
