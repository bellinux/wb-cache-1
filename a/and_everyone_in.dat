5|$|McKellar {{was also}} {{considered}} a capable leader in combat. Aggressive and instinctive, his fighting spirit was {{an inspiration to}} his squadron but according to one biographer, he was highly strung, vociferous and blunt with members of his unit.

His dedication to {{his job as a}} fighter pilot and leader led him to refuse any leave from his Squadron while the Battle of Britain lasted. Invariably McKellar led from the front of his unit. He spent a large proportion of his time with his squadron practising combat tactics. While intensely loyal to anyone he considered a friend, McKellar's attitude to others outside the squadron was either of utmost friendliness or utter dislike. He is said to have tended to see everything <b>and</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>in</b> black and white.|$|E

Hard times have come to her people; the animals have disappeared, her father is unable to catch fish to sell, <b>and</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>in</b> the community is too weak from hunger to work. Calpurnia bravely leaves home with her little dog, Buggy-Horse, to find the secret river that her neighbor Mother Albirtha has told her about. She intends to catch fish for her father to sell in his shop. When she finds the river she politely asks it to allow her to catch some fish and uses her creativity, and the pink ribbons from her hair, to catch them. On her way home, an owl, a bear and a panther each challenge her, and she has to give away some of her catch to get home. She also shares some fish with Mother Albirtha and takes the rest to her father, who gives them to the starving people in return for future payment. Strengthened by the fish, people begin working again. When the crisis is past Calpurnia searches for the river again, but cannot find it, as she no longer really needs it. Still, she realizes nothing is lost to us forever, and the book ends with one of her poems, expressing this sentiment:Secret River is in my mind.|$|E

25|$|Lady Bu {{was known}} to be very {{accepting}} towards Sun Quan's other wives and she did not show any signs of jealousy towards them. As such, she remained in her husband's favour in the long term. In 229, when Sun Quan declared himself emperor and established the state of Eastern Wu, he wanted to instate Lady Bu as the empress even though his subjects nominated Lady Xu to be the empress instead. Sun Quan eventually agreed to his subjects' suggestion.

500|$|The {{song was}} {{featured}} in a McDonald's advert that aired during the 2002 Winter Olympics. Mercer elaborated on the song's in an interview: [...] "That whole thing was just an ad agency that McDonald’s hired to do a “hip commercial,” or whatever. So the kid who offered {{the whole thing up}} to us was a Shins fan." [...] Online message boards (many on Pitchfork.com) and fans of the Shins criticized the move as excessively commercialist. The band's hometown alt weekly ran an editorial titled [...] "McShins, New Corporate Suck-ass" [...] in reaction. The ad's aesthetics were criticized for straying from the company's typical upbeat themes, and fans of the band found its inclusion subversive, considering a set of the song's lyrics, which at times refer to [...] "the dirt in your fries." [...] The royalties Mercer earned from the commercial allowed him to purchase a home. In addition, the band used the money to finance a tour and relocate to Portland, Oregon, where they built a basement studio and recorded their second album, Chutes Too Narrow (2003). Mercer nevertheless [...] "recognized the detrimental capacity of linking music with advertising," [...] remarking, [...] "Imagine us playing [...] "New Slang," [...] <b>and</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>in</b> the audience going, 'That's the song from the McDonald's commercial — I'm loving it.'" ...|$|E

Elsewhere, there were big reveals and revenge kills that helped everything {{add up to a}} very surprising and satisfying season finale." [...] He continued by praising how the trial sequence played out on screen, writing [...] "The actual staging and pacing of the trial and violent reckoning was really cool, with everyone getting dressed and little puzzle pieces falling into place, little birds leading men to their deaths, and Ramin Djawadi's excellent score." [...] He gave the episode a 9.5 out of 10. Michael Calia of The Wall Street Journal similarly gave praise to the episode, writing [...] "It's a good thing... that the season finale was full of massive developments, tying up several plot threads while leaving some others dangling in the most tantalizing way. This was the most complete episode of Game of Thrones yet, and possibly the best." [...] He also wrote, [...] "Dany and her fleet are finally sailing to Westeros, her great dragons casting shadows over the waves. It's on." ...|$|E
