25|$|The <b>angonoka</b> {{tortoise}} (Astrochelys yniphora) is {{a critically}} endangered species of tortoise endemic to Madagascar. It {{is also known}} as the <b>angonoka,</b> ploughshare tortoise, Madagascar tortoise, or Madagascar angulated tortoise.|$|E
50|$|In March 2013, smugglers {{were arrested}} after {{carrying}} a single bag containing 54 <b>angonoka</b> tortoises and 21 radiated tortoises (Astrochelys radiata) through Suvarnabhumi International Airport in Thailand. The 54 <b>angonoka</b> tortoises {{might be as}} much as a tenth of the world's population of the species.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to its Red List listing, the <b>angonoka</b> tortoise is now protected under the national law of Madagascar and listed on CITES Appendix I, commercial trade in wild-caught specimens is illegal (permitted only in exceptional licensed circumstances). For the conservation of the <b>angonoka</b> tortoise, the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust created Project <b>Angonoka</b> in 1986. The Water and Forests Department, the Durrell Trust, and the World Wide Fund for Nature work together on this project. A captive-breeding facility was established for this species in Madagascar in 1986 by the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust (now the Durrell Trust) {{in collaboration with the}} Water and Forests Department. In May 1996, 75 tortoises were stolen from the facility. The thieves were never found, but 33 tortoises later appeared for sale in the Netherlands. The project ultimately was a success, achieving 224 captive-bred juveniles out of 17 adults in December 2004. After the 1990s, Project <b>Angonoka</b> started ecological research on the tortoise and the development of conservation plans that involved the communities surrounding the habitat. The work with the community involved local people in making firebreaks, along with the creation of a park proposed by the community to protect the tortoise and the forests. Monitoring of the <b>angonoka</b> tortoise in the global pet trade has continued to be advocated.|$|E

50|$|On 12 June 2016, it was {{reported}} that 6 <b>angonoka</b> tortoises and 72 radiated tortoises had gone missing from a breeding facility in Thailand.|$|E
50|$|Project <b>Angonoka</b> {{is one of}} the {{successful}} breeding programmes that has seen the rarest tortoise in the world, the <b>angonoka,</b> brought back from the brink of extinction. One of the rarest ducks in the world, the Madagascar teal, is now breeding successfully at the Trust’s headquarters in Jersey, and the Alaotran gentle lemur is starting to make a recovery, now that hunting and burning of its habitat have been dramatically reduced thanks to an education programme targeted at local villages and schools.|$|E

50|$|The name <b>angonoka</b> {{comes from}} the Malagasy word used as the local name of the species. The {{alternative}} common name, ploughshare tortoise, refers to {{the appearance of the}} gular scute of the plastron.|$|E
50|$|Males {{are larger}} than females, {{reaching}} a carapace length up to 17 in. The average length of an adult male <b>angonoka</b> tortoise is 414.8 mm and the average weight is 10.3 kg. Females measure at a 370.1 mm average and weigh 8.8 kg on average.|$|E
50|$|The <b>angonoka</b> {{tortoise}} (A. yniphora) and the {{radiated tortoise}} (A. radiata) {{are the only}} species in the genus Astrochelys. Astrochelys is attributed to John Edward Gray, who used the name in his 1873 book Hand-list of the specimens of shield reptiles in the British Museum. The parent family for Astrochelys is Testudinidae, the tortoise family.|$|E
50|$|The <b>angonoka</b> {{tortoise}} {{has been}} observed feeding on grasses found in open rocky areas of bamboo scrub. It is also known to eat shrubs, forbs, and herbs. While it has been seen eating dead bamboo leaves, {{it has never been}} observed eating living bamboo. As well as these plants, the tortoise has also been seen eating the dried feces of bushpigs and carnivores.|$|E
50|$|On 20 March 2016, the Custom {{officials}} at Mumbai airport seized 146 tortoises from a mishandled baggage of a Nepal citizen. This bag {{was said to}} belong to a transit passenger, who arrived from Madagascar and flew to Kathmandu leaving this bag behind. Out of the 146 tortoises, 139 were Radiated tortoises (Astrochelys radiata) and seven were <b>angonoka</b> tortoises (Astrochelys yniphora), both critically endangered tortoise species of Madagascar. Two radiated tortoises were found dead with broken shell.|$|E
50|$|It is {{expected}} to become sexually mature once reaching 15 years old. The tortoise can produce one to six eggs per clutch and up to four clutches every season. The reproductive season is from January 15 to May 30. The <b>angonoka</b> tortoise's reproductive patterns coincide with the seasonal rainfall patterns of the region, with both mating and hatching occurring {{at the onset of}} the rainy seasons. With a 71.9% fertility rate and a 54.6% hatching success rate, about 4.3 hatchlings are produced per female tortoise.|$|E
50|$|The {{population}} {{estimate for}} the <b>angonoka</b> tortoise {{in the wild}} is about 600 individuals, ranging from 440 to 770, but is still decreasing. The tortoise is at an extremely high risk of extinction; it is thought it will become extinct in the wild in the next 10 to 15 years. It {{can be found in}} five subpopulations, two east and three west of the Andranomavo River. The two to the east are Beheta and Sada; the three to the west are Ambatomainty, Andrafiafaly, and Betainalika.|$|E
50|$|The <b>angonoka</b> {{tortoise}} {{is often}} captured {{to be sold}} in the international pet trade. Though some enforcement of restrictions on illegal trade is successful, including the confiscation of the illegally obtained tortoises, they remain in incredibly high demand for the global pet trade. This is {{a major threat to}} the tortoises remaining in the wild. Conservationists mark the shells with identifying marks which mars the most attractive feature and make them less desirable to poachers and wealthy collectors. The engraving is a last-ditch effort to protect the animals.|$|E
50|$|The Baie de Baly National Park is {{the only}} known natural habitat of the {{critically}} endangered <b>Angonoka</b> tortoise or ploughshare tortoise (Astrochelys yniphora).Other rare animals found in this park is the Madagascan sideneck turtle (Erymnochelys madagascariensis), {{as well as the}} dugong, a marine mammal and the Madagascar fish eagle. There are also thirteen species of mammals, (six primates), 37 reptile species, eight amphibian species and 122 species of birds. There is also the Perrierbambus madagascariensis, an endemic bamboo. The poisonous tree, Erythrophleum couminga (locally named komanga) is also endemic to this region and can be found in and outside the park. It is a very hard wood but cannot be used for cooking as its fumes contain a poison.|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} one of the rarest land {{tortoises}} in the world, classified as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List. The principal threats to the species are believed to be fires started to clear land for cattle grazing, and collection for the pet trade. The tortoise has a restricted distribution, likely a result of past collection for food, the expansion of agriculture, and accompanying fires. An additional threat is predation by the bushpig. Fires made to clear land can get out of control, turning into wildfires, which cut back more of the <b>angonoka</b> tortoise's habitat. Following efforts to create firebreaks through controlled fires in savanna fringes by conservation groups, out-of-control fires have decreased, until less than 50 ha of its habitat were burnt in 2004.|$|E
50|$|The Turtle Conservancy’s in-country {{conservation}} strategies include habitat protection, {{restoration and}} stewardship, turtle and tortoise reintroduction and a fieldwork grant program. In South Africa the Turtle Conservancy owns and stewards more than 1,000 {{acres of land}} in the last remaining habitat for the critically endangered Geometric Tortoise in South Africa. This land is critical habitat needed to save this beautiful tortoise from extinction. In Mexico the Turtle Conservancy is working to protect 43,000 acres of what {{is believed to be the}} last stronghold for the Bolson Tortoise, the largest terrestrial reptile in North America. In Madagascar the Turtle Conservancy collaborates with Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust in protecting the Ploughshare Tortoise from extinction. The Turtle Conservancy engages in education of communities and animal marking to eliminate the illegal poaching of Ploughshare Tortoises. In addition, the Turtle Conservancy is a leading member of the International Ploughshare or <b>Angonoka</b> Working Group, which sets direction for Ploughshare Conservation worldwide. The Turtle Conservancy also supports field work in Nicaragua, Mexico, Guyana, Pakistan, India, the Philippines, Namibia, Indonesia, China, and Myanmar.|$|E
