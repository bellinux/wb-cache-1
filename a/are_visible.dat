30|$|All {{videos were}} coded {{by a team}} of trained coders. Each video was coded, first, to see if hands <b>were</b> <b>visible,</b> the face <b>was</b> <b>visible,</b> or both <b>were</b> <b>visible.</b> Those videos in which hands <b>were</b> <b>visible</b> <b>were</b> further coded as to how the hands were used.|$|R

5|$|Several burials (presumably of {{high-ranking}} benefactors and clergy) {{were made}} within the priory and 19th-century archaeologists found stone coffins during excavations. They <b>are</b> <b>visible</b> against the east wall, but their original location was not recorded. Two centrally placed grave slabs <b>are</b> <b>visible</b> below the east window. The priory once housed the Brus cenotaph, {{a memorial to}} its founders erected in 1521. It was removed in 1540 and dismantled. Most of its parts were recovered and reassembled in the 19th century, and the reconstructed cenotaph is displayed in Saint Nicholas' Church next to the ruins.|$|E

50|$|The entire transit <b>was</b> <b>visible</b> from Europe, most of Asia, {{and almost}} all of Africa. The {{beginning}} <b>was</b> <b>visible</b> before sunset from easternmost Asia and Australia. The end <b>was</b> <b>visible</b> after sunrise from the westernmost fringe of Africa, eastern North America, and much of South America. The transit <b>was</b> not <b>visible</b> at all from western North America, southern South America, Hawaii, or New Zealand. The regions from which the transit <b>were</b> <b>visible</b> <b>are</b> shown on the map to the right.|$|R
5|$|Sunspots <b>are</b> <b>visible</b> as dark {{patches on}} the Sun's photosphere, and {{correspond}} to concentrations of magnetic field where the convective transport of heat is inhibited from the solar interior to the surface. As a result, sunspots are slightly cooler than the surrounding photosphere, and, so, they appear dark. At a typical solar minimum, few sunspots <b>are</b> <b>visible,</b> and occasionally none {{can be seen}} at all. Those that do appear are at high solar latitudes. As the solar cycle progresses towards its maximum, sunspots tend form closer to the solar equator, a phenomenon known as Spörer's law. The largest sunspots can be tens of thousands of kilometers across.|$|E

5|$|Both the Mont Blanc massif, and the Aiguilles Rouges {{range to}} its north, now {{form part of}} the {{external}} zone of the Alps, effectively being the outermost layers of rock.

5|$|Consonants and vowel {{segments}} {{combine to}} form syllables, {{which in turn}} combine to form utterances; these can be distinguished phonetically as the space between two inhalations. Acoustically, these different segments are characterized by different formant structures, that <b>are</b> <b>visible</b> in a spectrogram of the recorded sound wave (See illustration of Spectrogram of the formant structures of three English vowels). Formants are the amplitude peaks in the frequency spectrum of a specific sound.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, the African dung beetle Scarabaeus zambesianus {{was shown}} to {{navigate}} using polarization patterns in moonlight, making it the first animal known to use polarized moonlight for orientation. In 2013, it was shown that dung beetles can navigate when only the Milky Way or clusters of bright stars <b>are</b> <b>visible,</b> making dung beetles the only insects known to orient themselves by the galaxy.|$|E
5|$|Laser {{data are}} also used {{horizontally}} in two dimensions. An algorithm provides a real-time position estimation of the robot when enough elements from the landing gears and engines <b>are</b> <b>visible.</b> A confidence index {{is calculated based on}} the number of items collected by lasers. If good data confidence is achieved, the position is updated. This mode is particularly used when the robot moves beneath the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Malta's fortifications are {{featured}} {{a number of}} times on the islands' heraldry. The coat of arms of Malta contains a mural crown in gold with a sally port and eight turrets (five of which <b>are</b> <b>visible),</b> which represents the fortifications as well as Malta's status as a city-state. The coats of arms of the five regions of Malta have a similar crown but with five turrets, all of which <b>are</b> <b>visible.</b> A mural crown with four visible turrets can be seen on the coats of arms of Valletta, Mdina and Birgu, indicating their status as capital city or former capitals.
