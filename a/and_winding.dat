5|$|From 1869 at the latest, {{the company}} owning the Walker Engine Works was Bells, Goodman & Co. In that year the firm made the {{tunnelling}} shield and iron castings to line the Tower subway tunnels. In 1871 the firm made pumping <b>and</b> <b>winding</b> engines for Seghill Colliery. In 1875 it made machinery to condense smoke and gases for Clyde Lead Works of Glasgow.|$|E
5|$|Live at the BBC, {{the first}} {{official}} release of unissued Beatles performances in seventeen years, appeared in 1994. That same year McCartney, Harrison and Starr collaborated on the Anthology project. Anthology {{was the culmination of}} work begun in 1970, when Apple Corps director Neil Aspinall, their former road manager and personal assistant, had started to gather material for a documentary with the working title The Long <b>and</b> <b>Winding</b> Road. Documenting their history in the band's own words, the Anthology project included the release of several unissued Beatles recordings. McCartney, Harrison and Starr also added new instrumental and vocal parts to two songs recorded as demos by Lennon in the late 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Martin oversaw {{post-production}} on The Beatles Anthology (which {{was originally}} entitled The Long <b>and</b> <b>Winding</b> Road) in 1994 and 1995, working again with Geoff Emerick. Martin {{decided to use}} an old 8-track analogue deck – which EMI learned an engineer still had – to mix the songs for the project, instead of a modern digital deck. He explained this {{by saying that the}} old deck created a completely different sound, which a new deck could not accurately reproduce. He also said he found the whole project a strange experience (and McCartney agreed), as they had to listen to themselves chatting in the studio, 25–30 years previously.|$|E
30|$|Increasing {{energy price}} {{is reduced by}} {{increasing}} solar <b>and</b> <b>wind</b> energy capacities that are supported by incentive and regulation which surpass increasing cost factors for solar <b>and</b> <b>wind</b> generations. When incentive and regulation lose their impacts {{on the cost of}} solar <b>and</b> <b>wind</b> energies at the medium period, newly generated energy capacities of solar <b>and</b> <b>wind</b> systems decrease in a few iterations but then they recover their increasing state. This state stems from increasing solar <b>and</b> <b>wind</b> energy capacities that cause the increase in energy demand and reduce of energy price and profits such that model reacts to balance the system by decreasing supports (incentive and regulation) on solar <b>and</b> <b>wind</b> energies.|$|R

40|$|PV <b>and</b> <b>wind</b> {{power are}} the major {{renewable}} power technologies in most regions on earth. Depending on the interaction of solar <b>and</b> <b>wind</b> resources, PV <b>and</b> <b>wind</b> power industry become competitors or allies. Time resolved geospatial data of global horizontal irradiation (GHI) <b>and</b> <b>wind</b> speeds are used to simulate the power feed-in of PV <b>and</b> <b>wind</b> power plants on every region of a 1 °x 1 ° mesh of latitude and longitude between 65 °N and 65 °S. An overlap of PV <b>and</b> <b>wind</b> power full load hours has been defined and identified as ranging between 5 % and 25 % of total PV <b>and</b> <b>wind</b> power feed-in. Critical full load hours have been defined and discussed. Energy losses that would appear if the grid was dimensioned only for one power plant of PV or wind, do not exceed 9 % of total feed-in but are mainly around 3 %- 4 %. Thus the two major renewable power technologies are characterized by complementing each other...|$|R
5|$|A long <b>and</b> <b>winding</b> route had to {{be taken}} to reach topside; the steerage-class accommodation, located on C through G decks, was at the extreme ends of the decks, and so was the {{farthest}} away from the lifeboats. By contrast, the first-class accommodation was located on the upper decks and so was nearest. Proximity to the lifeboats thus became a key factor in determining who got into them. To add to the difficulty, many of the steerage passengers did not understand or speak English. It was perhaps no coincidence that English-speaking Irish immigrants were disproportionately represented among the steerage passengers who survived. Many of those who did survive owed their lives to third-class steward John Edward Hart, who organised three trips into the ship's interior to escort groups of third-class passengers up to the boat deck. Others made their way through open barriers or climbed emergency ladders.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the {{new road}} proved far more {{difficult}} than first imagined. Workers followed an old Native American trail, wholly consumed by nature, between Delhi and Port Talbot. To get across the numerous swamps, felled trees were laid across the path to create a corduroy road, much {{to the chagrin of}} settlers. The outbreak of the War of 1812 would temporarily halt further construction. When it resumed in 1816, Talbot himself began directing the surveyor, ordering that the road remain on the highest ground possible. This led to an irregular <b>and</b> <b>winding</b> route between Aylmer and Delhi. By 1830, the corduroy logs had been removed and the road improved and extended from Amherstburg to Canborough.|$|E
5|$|Monster {{was founded}} in 1979 by Noel Lee as Monster Cable Products. Lee, an audiophile and engineer, was experimenting with {{different}} copper qualities, wire constructs <b>and</b> <b>winding</b> methods of audio cables in his family's garage and comparing them while listening to Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture. He became convinced that audio cables could be engineered to improve audio quality by conducting electricity more efficiently. Using a borrowed portion of somebody's booth at the 1978 Consumer Electronics Show, he did demonstrations of his cables in comparison to standard wires. After a positive reception at CES, he quit his job at Lawrence Berkeley Lab and started Monster Cable Products with $250,000 in bank financing. Monster's first cables were manufactured by Lee by hand and sold door-to-door.|$|E

5|$|B {{service was}} also cut due to {{financial}} {{problems in the}} late 1930s and again after World War II; by 1950, Pittsfield was served by eight Boston-Albany round trips per day. The four daily trips to North Adams ended in 1953. The opening of the Massachusetts Turnpike in 1957 and the Berkshire Thruway two years later provided {{for the first time}} an auto route to western Massachusetts superior to the narrow <b>and</b> <b>winding</b> Route 20; this effectively decimated long distance service on the B In January 1960 the NYC received permission to discontinue all B service that April, but public outcry prevented full cancellation. On April 24, 1960, stops west of Framingham except Worcester, Palmer, Springfield, and Pittsfield were closed; Boston-Albany service via Pittsfield was reduced to just 3.5 daily round trips. Still facing losses, the B was finally fully absorbed into the NYC in 1961, effectively subsidized by its popular New York commuter service. The crack New England States, introduced in 1938, was combined with the 20th Century Limited west of Buffalo on November 5, 1967. After the latter was discontinued on December 2, the New England States lost its named distinction on December 3.|$|E

30|$|Cost {{of solar}} (COSE)/wind (COWE) energy, {{technological}} applicability for solar (TASE)/wind (TAWE) energy and solar (SEI)/wind (WEI) energy incentive factors directly affect {{the amount of}} newly generated solar <b>and</b> <b>wind</b> energy capacities <b>and</b> also have indirect effects on other global factors. The cost of energy systems refers {{the total amount of}} cost that stem from investment cost, production, transmission and distribution costs. Technological applicability for energy systems represents the applicability of solar <b>and</b> <b>wind</b> energy technologies under the given geological, physical, and operational conditions for generation and distribution of the solar <b>and</b> <b>wind</b> energy. Other auxiliary factors around the solar <b>and</b> <b>wind</b> energy generations are an incentive and any type of governmental supports that encourage users and investors to direct the solar <b>and</b> <b>wind</b> energy usage <b>and</b> investments. Solar <b>and</b> <b>wind</b> energy incentive are monetary (e.g., zero-interest loan, tax relief, feed-in-tariff) or non-monetary (e.g., law, regulation, policies) encouragement programs whose special purposes are to increase the use of solar <b>and</b> <b>wind</b> energy-efficient equipment <b>and</b> reduce non-renewable energy usage.|$|R

40|$|Wave <b>and</b> <b>wind</b> {{impacts on}} {{short-term}} backshore processes were investigated {{in terms of}} backshore topography, sand grain size, and wave, tide, <b>and</b> <b>wind</b> conditions at an open-ocean dissipative beach in Japan from September 2004 to March 2005. Indices of wave <b>and</b> <b>wind</b> impacts were defined by wave run-up level and wind-driven sand transport rate, respectively. The results show that waves have larger effects than winds on backshore accumulation even {{in areas where the}} wave acts on a bed for only a few days a year. Furthermore, both waves <b>and</b> <b>winds</b> cause sand coarsening in the backshore. Run-up waves are the external force with the greatest impact on backshore processes, followed by landward strong <b>winds,</b> <b>and</b> mild <b>winds...</b>|$|R
30|$|Active {{factors in}} the initial state lose their effects on the other factors during the {{iteration}} process. Decreasing investments and new generation capacities of the solar <b>and</b> <b>wind</b> energies stimulate governments to take precaution for supporting these concepts by regulation and incentive. Also, decreasing cost of solar <b>and</b> <b>wind</b> energy systems are balanced by incentive and general energy demand and prices. Technical applicability for solar <b>and</b> <b>wind</b> energy are limited by solar <b>and</b> <b>wind</b> energy systems, so their positive active initial values decrease and reach steady states at zero values.|$|R
