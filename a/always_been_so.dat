25|$|Japanese {{responses}} to Sinocentric concepts have not <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> straightforward. The Mongol invasions in 1274 and 1281 evoked a national {{consciousness of the}} role of the kamikaze (神風) in defeating the enemy. Less than fifty years later (1339–43), Kitabatake Chikafusa wrote the Jinnō Shōtōki (神皇正統記, 'Chronicle of the Direct Descent of the Divine Sovereigns') emphasizing the divine descent of the imperial line. The Jinnō Shōtōki provided a Shinto view of history stressing the divine nature of Japan and its spiritual supremacy over China and India.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the number}} of Pomo basket weavers has decreased, their skill and artistic vision is still intact, and people pay a pretty penny {{to get their hands}} on the art. Today, new Pomo baskets might sell for as much as $1,000, and the more {{historical}} ones might sell for more than $10,000. Dealing of these baskets has not <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> lucrative and many have tried to exploit the artists and communities. Dealers and collectors may have exploited the lucrative basket market, but it still paid well enough to provide income to Pomo women where hunting and gathering were no longer feasible and money was needed for survival.|$|E

[...] Until recently, important pieces of the skeleton had not been discovered, including the radius, ulna, vertebrae, hand and foot bones, and the pelvis. [...] In 1936, Alice Carleton mistakenly associated postcranial remains of the diademed sifaka (Propithecus diadema) from Ampasambazimba with Mesopropithecus pithecoides {{and came to the}} false conclusion that its morphology was like that of a monkey.

500|$|It was {{followed}} that {{year by the}} neo-noir crime thriller Mulholland Falls, which featured the murder of Allison Pond (Connelly), mistress of General Timms (John Malkovich), and the investigation {{by a group of}} detectives led by Maxwell Hoover (Nick Nolte). New York magazine wrote about a clip that reveals the link between Timms and Pond: [...] "This footage is actually dirty. That is, it makes us feel like voyeurs when looking at it, but it's so juicily erotic that we can hardly look away". About nudity in the movie, Connelly said: [...] "It kind of shocked everyone who knows me that I wound up doing this movie, because I had <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> careful about nudity, it was {{very much a part of}} this character and I couldn't be coy or guarded or self-conscious--otherwise it wouldn't work.

500|$|Today Sappho, for many, is {{a symbol}} of female homosexuality; the common term lesbian is an allusion to Sappho. [...] However, she has not <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> considered. In {{classical}} Athenian comedy (from the Old Comedy of the fifth century to Menander in the late fourth and early third centuries BC), Sappho was caricatured as a promiscuous heterosexual woman, and it is not until the Hellenistic period that the first testimonia which explicitly discuss Sappho's homoeroticism are preserved. [...] The earliest of these is a fragmentary biography written on papyrus in the late third or early second century BC, [...] which states that Sappho was [...] "accused by some of being irregular in her ways and a woman-lover." [...] Denys Page comments that the phrase [...] "by some" [...] implies that even the full corpus of Sappho's poetry did not provide conclusive evidence of whether she described herself as having sex with women. These ancient authors do not appear to have believed that Sappho did, in fact, have sexual relationships with other women, and as late as the tenth century the Suda records that Sappho was [...] "slanderously accused" [...] of having sexual relationships with her [...] "female pupils".|$|E
500|$|As {{an island}} {{surrounded}} by marshes and meres, the fishing of eels was important {{as both a}} food and an income for the abbot and his nearby tenants. For example, to the abbot of Ely in 1086, Stuntenei was worth 24,000 eels, Litelport 17,000 eels and even the small village of Liteltetford was worth 3,250 eels. Prior to the extensive and largely successful drainage of the fens during the seventeenth century, Ely was a trade centre for goods made out of willow, reeds and rushes and wild fowling was a major local activity. Peat {{in the form of}} [...] "turf" [...] was used as a fuel and in the form of [...] "moor" [...] as a building material. Ampthill Clay was dug from the local area for the maintenance of river banks and Kimmeridge Clay at Roswell Pits for the making of pottery wares. In general, from a geological perspective, [...] "The district is almost entirely agricultural and has <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>so.</b> The only mineral worked at the present time is gravel for aggregate, although chalk, brick clay (Ampthill and Kimmeridge clays), phosphate (from Woburn Sands, Gault and Cambridge Greensand), sand and gravel, and peat have been worked on a small scale in the past".|$|E

500|$|Woodburne was {{initially}} against Susan developing the condition, {{but when she}} started researching it, she realised {{how much of a}} challenge the storyline would be and she changed her mind. The actress and the shows writers worked closely with the MS Society to make the storyline as realistic as possible and it was praised by both the society and viewers who have the condition. Jenna Litchfield of the MS Society said soap opera storylines in which characters are diagnosed with MS helped to highlight the condition and its effects. She added that the storyline had [...] "sparked interest." [...] Of the storyine, Woodburne stated [...] "It's a massive story and to take a character that has <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> strong and to challenge them physically and emotionally was terrific. I know that the writing department did an enormous amount of research." [...] Woodburne also explained that as Susan is such a strong person mentally, she goes through an emotional struggle when her body lets her down. Woodburne commented that she found the scenes distressing to play as she is so attached to her character. She told a writer for Inside Soap that it was a difficult storyline, but [...] "ultimately rewarding". On screen, Susan learnt how to keep her symptoms under control and Woodburne said she would occasionally have a relapse, as the condition does not go away. In 2011, Woodburne commented on the MS storyline, which she enjoyed, saying it was very challenging to tell a good story and make it authentic and real for people who have the condition.|$|E
500|$|... "Champion" [...] {{was written}} by Minaj, along with T-Minus, Nikhil S., Drake, Young Jeezy, and Nas, with {{production}} handled by T-Minus and Nikhil S., who had previously worked with Minaj on her debut studio album Pink Friday (2010). Minaj had wanted several artists {{to appear on the}} song, including fellow New York rapper Nas. She had stated that she did not think that she could get Nas on the song, saying [...] "He's <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> exclusive. He doesn't work with everybody and I respect people that are like that. They take pride in their craft." [...] Minaj told Vibe, [...] "I keep saying to be from Queens and to end up having him... We know how picky he is [...] He said 'I like the song, I'm a do it, you can wait 'til Monday and I got you' and he kept his word. He murked it, for me to wait for a feature and it be that and murk the song and finish the song that way... I was amazed." [...] After hearing the song, Nas agreed to be on the track, and sent his verse back to Minaj the following Monday. After collaborating, Nas said that he {{had fallen in love with}} the song: [...] "Nicki hit us up, I got love, so it was nothin'--I did the record....If I feel it, I can get on it. I heard the track. I felt it. I loved it." [...] Another artist Minaj wanted on [...] "Champion" [...] was long-time idol and fellow female rapper Lauryn Hill. [...] "I wanted to get her on 'Champion'... That would have been crazy, right? She was my fave. [...] Lauryn to me is the goddess. I'd love to meet her.

'Kathy' has <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> close to my heart and it's absolutely wonderful returning to the show and reprising the role." [...] It was then confirmed that Taylforth would reprise her role indefinitely. While Taylforth was initially only contracted to the series for six months, she said that she'd love {{to stay on the}} series for good. Of the return, Treadwell-Collins said [...] "Six months ago, we set ourselves that challenge of bringing Kathy back to the Square in a credible way. And I believe we have succeeded." [...] Taylforth revealed that she was initially hesitant about the storyline. [...] "I couldn't understand how they could work around the fact that she could do that to her children" [...] the actress explained. Taylforth said [...] "it had to be right." [...] In September 2015, Treadwell-Collins revealed to the Daily Mirror that the story was inspired by the real life John Darwin disappearance where John—also known as the Canoe man—with the help of his wife Anne faked his death in a canoe accident in March 2002 in order to claim the insurance. Kathy's husband Gavin Sullivan (Paul Nicholas) had convinced her to fake her death to keep her children safe.|$|E
