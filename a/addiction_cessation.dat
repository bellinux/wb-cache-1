40|$|Background Measurement of {{life quality}} as {{an index of}} health status has a {{widespread}} application in health care domain. Objectives The current study aimed to determine {{the quality of life}} of referents to <b>addiction</b> <b>cessation</b> centers of Iran. Patients and Methods In this cross-sectional study, 988 addicts who had referred to <b>addiction</b> <b>cessation</b> centers in Shahroud were studied through SF- 36 questionnaire. The data were analyzed using linear regression in structural equation modeling and STATA 12 statistical software. Results The mean ± SD age of the participants was 41. 2 ± 11. 8 years. Most of the referents used smoking followed by eating method of opium abuse. The mean ± SD score of life quality was 67. 8 ± 17. 2, the mean ± SD score of life quality in physical health dimension was 76. 9 ± 26. 7, and the mean ± SD score in mental health dimension was 64. 5 ± 18. 4. Univariate analysis showed a significant relationship between life quality and gender, place of residence, education, occupation, marital status, and income (P ≤ 0. 05). However, in multivariate analysis a significant relationship was observed only between gender, socioeconomic status, and quality of life score. Conclusions Although most studies have reported low and weak quality of life in addicts, the findings of this study shows that the life quality score of addicts is rather good. It seems that the maintenance treatment that addicts receive in <b>addiction</b> <b>cessation</b> centers has been effective in improving {{the quality of life of}} the patients. Hence, expanding methadone treatment centers can play a leading role in the improvement of life quality in addicts...|$|E
30|$|Dopamine D 3 receptors {{are thought}} to be the {{principal}} neural substrate in the dopaminergic mesolimbic circuit, the primary reward pathway in the mammalian brain. D 3 receptor dysfunction has been implicated in many diseases including drug addiction, Parkinson’s disease, and schizophrenia [1 – 4]. Selective imaging of dopamine D 3 receptors may reveal their role in diseases and could lead to more effective D 3 -specific therapies for <b>addiction</b> <b>cessation</b> [5 – 9] and schizophrenia [10]. Until now, determining the role of D 3 receptors in addiction and relapse has not been feasible, as current radioligands ([11 C]raclopride [11], [18 F]fallypride [12], and [11 C]PHNO [9]) are not sufficiently selective for distinguishing D 2 versus D 3 receptor subtypes [12 – 14]. In response to this need, the Mach laboratory developed [18 F]fluortriopride (FTP), a D 3 -specific radiotracer having a D 3 :D 2 selectivity of 163 [15, 16].|$|E
40|$|Background: Protecting {{households}} against {{financial risks}} {{is one of}} objectives of any health system. In this regard, Iran's fourth five year developmental plan act in its 90 th article, articulated decreasing household's exposure to catastrophic health expenditure to one percent. Hence, this study aimed to measure percentage of Iranian households exposed to catastrophic health expenditures and to explore its determinants. Methods: The present descriptive- analytical study was carried out retrospectively. Households whose financial contributions to the health system exceeded 40 % of disposable income were considered as exposed to catastrophic healthcare expenditures. Influential factors on catastrophic healthcare expenditures were examined by logistic regression and chi-square test. Results: Of 39, 088 households, 80 were excluded due to absence of food expenditures. 2. 8 % of households were exposed to catastrophic health expenditures. Influential factors on catastrophic healthcare were utilizing ambulatory, hospital, and drug <b>addiction</b> <b>cessation</b> services as well as consuming pharmaceuticals. Socioeconomics characteristics such as health insurance coverage, household size, and economic status were other determinants of exposure to catastrophic healthcare expenditures. Conclusion: Iranian health system has not achieved the objective of reducing catastrophic healthcare expenditure to one percent. Inefficient health insurance coverage, different fee schedules practiced by private and public providers, failure of referral system are considered as probable barriers toward decreasing households' exposure to catastrophic healthcare expenditures...|$|E

This {{dissertation}} contributes unified graph-based algorithms and models to help solve large-scale societal problems affecting millions of individuals' daily lives, from cyber-attacks involving malware to tobacco and alcohol addiction. The main thrusts of our research are: (1) Propagation-based Graph Mining Algorithms: We develop graph mining algorithms to propagate information between the nodes to infer important details about the unknown nodes. We present three examples: AESOP (patented) unearths malware lurking in people's computers with 99. 61 % true positive rate at 0. 01 % false positive rate; our application of ADAGE on malware detection (patent-pending) enables to detect malware in a streaming setting; and EDOCS (patent-pending) flags comment spammers among 197 thousand users on a social media platform accurately and preemptively. (2) Graph-induced Behavior Characterization: We derive new insights and knowledge that characterize certain behavior from graphs using statistical and algorithmic techniques. We present two examples: a study on identifying attributes of smoking and drinking abstinence and relapse from an <b>addiction</b> <b>cessation</b> social media community; and an exploratory analysis of how company insiders trade. Our work has already made impact to society: deployed by Symantec, AESOP is protecting over 120 million people worldwide from malware; EDOCS has been deployed by Yahoo and it guards multiple online communities from comment spammers.

This study determines if sustained treatment for Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome (AWS) might be based on the strategic choices and expectations of patients and health care providers alike, as well as the risk mitigation options available to them. Design/approach: AWS was modeled as a Stag Hunt to explain both risk and decision-making in medical treatments for detoxification, since it can deduce a set of equilibrium strategies available to both patient and provider. Modeling was based on a review of juried literature gathered from search engines with the use medical subject heading terms. Main findings: While {{there is little evidence that}} decision-making is shared between patient and physician in AWS treatments, the outcomes of their interactions depend on utility-maximizing choices each makes in anticipation of the other. Payoff-dominant and risk-dominant treatment outcomes are equally likely and equally cost-efficient, as conditioned by the presence (or absence) of mutual trust and assurance in reciprocal transactions. Conclusion/value: Simulation games, such as the Stag Hunt, offer a viable framework to understand patient and provider incentives and health-affecting behaviors during treatments for <b>addiction</b> <b>cessation.</b> If both anticipate indefinitely interacting in the absence of any predetermined or foreseeable final visit, they can maximize future payoffs from mutual cooperation and accountability, which fosters health promotion. However, this study suggests that the effect of cooperation is distinct from the effect of time in AWS and other addiction-cessation programs.

Recently, {{there has been a}} rapid {{increase in the number of}} females using substances and although usage tends to reduce during pregnancy, it is of critical importance to determine its exact level as substance use negatively impacts on the health of both the mother and infant.   Aim: The aim of the present study was to investigate the frequency of smoking, alcohol, {{and substance}} use, and quitting rates during pregnancy.   Method: This study was conducted on pregnant females in Sakarya, Turkey. A total of 1, 082 consecutively presenting females who agreed to participate in the study were evaluated. The study team prepared a sociodemographic data form and adapted the “Introduction” section, derived from the Addiction Profile Index, to cover substance use during pregnancy. Results: The substances most frequently used by pregnant females in their previous pregnancies and current pregnancies were cigarettes/tobacco products (11 % and 11. 8 %, respectively), alcohol (0. 6 % and 0. 4 %, respectively), and rarely, synthetic cannabinoids (0. 3 % and 0. 2 %, respectively). Daily tobacco smokers continued to smoke during pregnancy, with a rate of 42. 5 %. Based on research into predictors of smoking (cigarettes) in pregnancy, a correlation was found between lifetime smoking and smoking during a previous pregnancy. A similar link was found with respect to alcohol. Conclusion: Cigarettes are the most frequently used substance in pregnancy, and to a lesser extent, alcohol and synthetic cannabinoids, also considered to be risky substances. A high incidence of smoking regularly during pregnancy was found in daily smokers. It is recommended that physicians should sensitively ask pregnant females presenting at clinics about all forms of substance use, including alcohol and synthetic cannabinoids, and to include such questions in their routine enquiries.

40|$|ROLE OF MAGL INHIBITION IN NICOTINE WITHDRAWAL AND REWARD. A {{dissertation}} submitted in partial {{fulfillment of}} the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at Virginia Commonwealth University. by Pretal Ishvarlal Patel Muldoon Director: M. Imad Damaj, PhD Professor, Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology Tobacco use {{is one of the}} leading causes of preventable deaths worldwide. Nicotine, the main psychoactive component of tobacco, sustains and initiates tobacco <b>addiction.</b> <b>Cessation</b> of nicotine induces a dependence withdrawal syndrome. Recent in vivo studies indicate that the endocannabinoid (EC) system modulates both nicotine reward and withdrawal. The purpose of this proposal is to investigate the role of enhancing endogenous 2 -arachidonoylglycerol (2 -AG) and by blocking its degradative enzyme, monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) enzyme, in nicotine reward and dependence. The selective MAGL inhibitor JZL 184 dose-dependently reduced both precipitated and spontaneous somatic and aversive withdrawal signs in mice. These effects were blocked by rimonabant indicating a CB 1 receptor mechanism. Furthermore, repeated administration of JZL 184 for 6 days did not produce tolerance to the alleviation of withdrawal and the treatment did not induce alterations in CB 1 receptor levels or receptor-mediated G-protein activity in various brain regions. In addition, a decrease in 2 -AG levels was found in the nucleus accumbens in nicotine-dependent mice undergoing precipitated withdrawal, suggesting that a dysregulation of this EC signaling system occurs during nicotine withdrawal. Lastly, we tested the effectiveness of a combination of low-dose JZL 184 and high dose of the FAAH inhibitor PF- 3845 on spontaneous nicotine withdrawal. Indeed, the combination of low-dose JZL 184 and PF- 3845 significantly attenuated nicotine spontaneous withdrawal signs. MAGL inhibition by JZL 184 dose-dependently caused a significant blockade of nicotine reward as measured in the mouse conditioned place preference (CPP). In contrast to withdrawal, JZL 184 ’s effect on nicotine CPP was not CB 1 mediated. In addition, JZL 184 treatment did not cause significant alterations in CB 1 receptor levels or receptor-mediated G-protein activity in several brain regions involved in nicotine reward. The effects of JZL 184 on nicotine CPP was selective since the drug failed to alter food-induced CPP and LiCl-induced conditioned place aversion in the mouse. Interestingly, active doses of JZL 184 did not only cause an increases in 2 -AG levels but also induced a concomitant decrease in arachidonic acid (AA) levels in various brain regions suggesting an AA cascade dependent-mechanism. In line of these changes, a cox- 2 inhibitor, valdecoxib, dose-dependently blocked nicotine preference...|$|E
40|$|Nicotine {{addiction}} {{is the most}} common serious medical problem in the country. Tobacco use is responsible for 30 % of cancer deaths in the United States and 90 % of all lung cancer deaths. The physical addiction to nicotine explains why over 30 % of Americans continue to smoke or use tobacco despite their desires and efforts to quit. The testimony summarized in this paper recommends four broad strategies for preventing tobacco-caused cancers in the United States: a) mandating and reimbursing effective treatments for nicotine addiction; b) increasing Federal and state tobacco excise taxes and earmarking a fraction of tax revenues for tobacco prevention and cessation; c) enacting other policy changes to prevent tobacco use and addiction among children, including expanded clean indoor air legislation, comprehensive youth tobacco access legislation, and the regulation of tobacco products and their advertising and promotion; and d) expanding tobacco control research and critical Federal research support.

40|$|Background: Although {{perception}} predicts behaviours in general, it is {{less clear}} whether perceived peer smoking prevalence is associated with smoking among children. Although {{the harmful effects of}} smoking and secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure on health are well documented, {{little is known about the}} influence of SHS exposure on smoking behaviours, and the effects of smoking on perceived health. Objectives: This thesis aims to investigate the associations of (1) overestimation of peer smoking prevalence and smoking initiation, (2) self-rated health (SRH) with smoking and SHS exposure, and (3) SHS exposure at home with smoking initiation, tobacco <b>addiction</b> and smoking <b>cessation,</b> among an under-studied population of Chinese children in Hong Kong. Methods: A prospective study among primary school students (n = 2171) was conducted in 2006 (baseline) and followed up in 2008. A cross-sectional study on youth smoking (n = 36225) was conducted in 2003 / 4. Self-administered, anonymous questionnaires were used to collect information on socio-demographic characteristics, smoking status of the subjects, parents, siblings and other family members and SHS exposure at home and outside home. Other detailed information on smoking perceptions and behaviours were recorded among adolescents using standard questions adapted from the Global Youth Tobacco Survey. Self-reported smoking and SHS exposure were validated using hair nicotine tests. Logistic and linear regressions were used to yield adjusted odds ratio (AOR) and β-coefficients for poor SRH, smoking initiation, tobacco <b>addiction</b> and smoking <b>cessation</b> adjusting for socio-demographic characteristics and school clustering effects. Mediation of SHS exposure at home on the associations of smoking family with smoking initiation, tobacco <b>addiction</b> and smoking <b>cessation</b> were evaluated using standard mediation procedures. Results: Experimental smoking, ex-smoking and current smoking were associated with higher AORs for poor SRH than never-smoking among adolescents. Similarly, SHS exposure among never-smoking adolescents was linked to poor SRH. Overestimation of peer smoking prevalence significantly predicted smoking initiation (AOR: 1. 79, 95 % CI 1. 03 - 3. 13) among primary school students after 2 years, although SHS exposure did not predict overestimation. Living in smoking families and SHS exposure at home were significantly associated with smoking initiation and tobacco addiction, and hindered smoking cessation among adolescents (All p< 0. 05). The association between smoking family and child smoking was mediated by SHS exposure at home. Conclusions: This study provided the first evidence that overestimation of peer smoking predicted smoking initiation among young children, and smoking was associated with poor SRH among Chinese adolescents. The significant associations of SHS exposure at home with smoking behaviours should stimulate further investigations into the underlying psychosocial and physiological mechanisms. Future prospective studies with more comprehensive measurements of smoking and SHS exposure are warranted to confirm these results. Evidence-based interventions to correct misperceptions and promote smokefree homes are needed to protect children from smoking and exposure to SHS. published_or_final_versionCommunity MedicineDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

40|$|Diagnosis of {{head and}} neck {{squamous}} cell carcinoma (HNSCC) presents a multifarious problem. Late stage diagnosis, uncertainty regarding appropriate clinical treatment, {{as well as the}} high potential for disfigurement and functional loss resulting in diminished quality of life, contributes to the need for satisfactory patient participation in quality treatment decision-making (TDM). This qualitative study sought to explore the TDM process of older adults with newly diagnosed HNSCC, including laryngeal, esophageal, and oral cancers. Forty one patients completed in depth semi structured interviews. Using a grounded theory approach, transcripts were coded for key themes. Results indicated that HNSCC in older patients is often preceded by lifelong alcohol, tobacco, and substance use. Despite frequent interaction with health and substance abuse treatment professionals, very few patients had prior knowledge of HNSCC risk or had been screened for these cancers. Experience with addiction treatment programs appears to influence the decision making process. The following themes were identified: (1) dynamic time perspectives including taking time, making time, junk time and time out; (2) recovery from disease; (3) the role of Hope; (4) the role of healing vs. cure; and (5) patient 2 ̆ 7 s moving forward. Results of this investigation suggest that patients with a history of lifelong substance use and treatment participation could benefit from earlier detection and improved awareness and knowledge of HNSCC risk.

The consensus development process forms part of the activities performed by the UICC (International Union Against Cancer) Project Smoking Cessation, which is a project within the framework of the UICC Tobacco and Cancer Programme. The 1988 Report of the US Surgeon General states very clearly, that the use of tobacco products is not a matter of free choice, but is the result of an addiction as scientifically valid as the addiction to heroin and other narcotics.

40|$|SURVEY OF THE KNOWLEDGE AND CONFIDENCE OF RESPIRATORY THERAPY STUDENTS REGARDING TOBACCO SMOKING AND RESPIRATORY DISEASES by Delano S. DuCasse INTRODUCTION: Tobacco {{abuse is}} {{the main cause of}} illness and avoidable death in the world (World Health Organization, 2010). Smoking-related {{diseases}} claim an estimated 443, 000 American lives each year, including those affected indirectly, such as babies born prematurely due to prenatal maternal smoking and victims of 2 ̆ 2 secondhand 2 ̆ 2 exposure to tobacco’s carcinogens (American Lung Association, 2011). Of all healthcare providers, respiratory therapists are most often in contact with patients that are diagnosed with smoking related diseases. Therefore, students entering into the field should be well equipped with the knowledge, skills and attitude to educate patients about the importance of smoking prevention and cessation. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate students’ knowledge and confidence regarding tobacco <b>addiction</b> and <b>cessation</b> following enrollment in a pulmonary disease course. METHODS: Students enrolled in a bachelor’s degree respiratory therapy program at a southeastern university were surveyed prior to and following a required pulmonary disease course. Participation was completely voluntary and no incentives to participate were offered. A total of 31 students participated in the pre-tobacco education survey on January 24, 2013 and 24 students participated in the post-tobacco survey on April 29, 2013. DATA ANALYSIS: The data was analyzed using SPSS 19. 0. Descriptive statistics to include frequencies and percentages were used to evaluate the RT student’s responses to survey questions. RESULTS: Majority of the students only had 1 to 2 hours of lecture that focused on tobacco smoking. The actual tobacco education they received was not a clear cut topic within the pulmonary disease course itself; the topic tobacco smoking was only mentioned under diseases processes such as, COPD and Lung Cancer. The RT students’ confidence levels slightly improved after being enrolled in the pulmonary disease course. The pre surveyed RT students’ average was 55. 5...|$|R
40|$|Smoking is a {{significant}} cause of preventable mortality worldwide. Understanding the neural mechanisms of nicotine <b>addiction</b> and smoking <b>cessation</b> may provide effective targets for developing treatment strategies. In the present study, we explored whether smokers have white matter alterations and whether these alterations are related to cessation outcomes and smoking behaviors. Sixty-six smokers and thirty-seven healthy non-smokers were enrolled. The participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging scans and smoking-related behavioral assessments. After a 12 -week treatment with varenicline, 28 smokers succeeded in quitting smoking and 38 failed. Diffusion parameter maps were compared among the non-smokers, future quitters, and relapsers to identify white matter differences. We found that the future relapsers had significantly lower fractional anisotropy (FA) in the orbitofrontal area than non-smokers, and higher FA in the cerebellum than non-smokers and future quitters. The future quitters had significantly lower FA in the postcentral gyrus compared to non-smokers and future relapsers. Compared to non-smokers, pooled smokers had lower FA in bilateral orbitofrontal gyrus and left superior frontal gyrus. In addition, regression analysis showed that the left orbitofrontal FA was correlated with smoking-relevant behaviors. These results suggest that white matter alterations in smokers {{may contribute to the}} formation of aberrant brain circuits underlying smoking behaviors and are associated with future smoking cessation outcomes...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Nicotine {{replacement}} therapy (NRT) {{has been shown}} to increase 12 -month abstinence rates by as much as 50 % when compared with placebo; however, NRT seems to be underutilized in the acute cardiac setting. This study explores the attitudes and beliefs of healthcare professionals regarding the use of NRT in acute cardiac inpatients, in an effort to identify and expose barriers that may impede the use of this drug in the acute cardiac care environment. METHOD: Framework analysis formed the methodological foundation of the study and provided the structure for analysis of data generated via qualitative, semistructured one-on-one interviews. A purposive sample of healthcare professionals practicing in the acute cardiac care setting informed the study. RESULTS: Although health care professionals expressed strong views regarding the benefits of implementing NRT as a smoking cessation intervention, barriers were identified that hinder its use. Financial implications, lack of knowledge and safety issues all contributed to the institutional justification for rejecting hospital-based NRT as a secondary prevention intervention in the acute cardiac setting. CONCLUSION: To proactively reduce the incidence of secondary cardiac events, education of healthcare professionals concerning tobacco <b>addiction</b> and available <b>cessation</b> treatments in the acute cardiac patient is paramount. Nicotine replacement products require further investigation to ascertain their safety and financial viability in the acute cardiac setting. Findings may support the implementation of NRT in the inpatient cardiac setting, and ultimately help curb the incidence of smoking-related mortality owing to secondary cardiac events. Fiona C.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Electronic {{cigarettes}} (e-cigarettes) {{are increasingly}} used in adolescents with unknown impacts on conventional cigarette smoking. We examined the associations of e-cigarette use with smoking intention, nicotine <b>addiction</b> and smoking <b>cessation</b> in Chinese adolescents. METHODS: A total of 45, 128 students (age 14. 6 ± 1. 9; boys 51. 4 %) from 75 randomly selected schools in Hong Kong reported e-cigarette use (in the past 30 days), conventional cigarette use and socio-demographic characteristics in an anonymous questionnaire survey. Adjusted odds ratios (AORs) of intention to smoke, morning smoking urge, intention to quit and quit attempts; and beta-coefficient (β) of cigarette consumption per day were calculated {{in relation to}} e-cigarette use. RESULTS: E-cigarette use was associated with intention to smoke with an AOR (95 % CI) of 1. 74 (1. 30 - 2. 31) in all students, 2. 18 (1. 12 - 4. 23) in never and 2. 79 (2. 05 - 3. 79) in ever smokers (non-significant interaction by smoking status). The associations were also significant in experimental and former smokers but not in current smokers. In current smokers, e-cigarette use {{was significantly associated with}} heavier smoking (β 2. 54, 95 % CI 1. 28 - 3. 81) and morning smoking urge (AOR 2. 54, 95 % CI 1. 50 - 3. 11), and non-significantly associated with lower quit intention (0. 76, 0. 52 - 1. 09) and attempts (0. 80, 0. 56 - 1. 23). CONCLUSIONS: E-cigarette use was associated with smoking intention in never, experimental and former smokers in Hong Kong Chinese adolescents. In current smokers, e-cigarette use was associated with nicotine addiction but not quit intention and attempts. Prospective studies with detailed measurements on e-cigarette use are warranted for further studies. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. postprin...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{described in}} this thesis covers two fields of investigation: 1) Biaryl and styrene Synthesis by Cross-Coupling of Fluorous-tagged Photo-activated Arylgermanes and Towards the Preparation of Boscalid and Analogues Biaryls are generally prepared by cross-coupling between aryl metals. However, even the most robust of these aryl metal species cannot be carried through complex synthetic sequences due to their reactivity particularly towards electrophiles. In this thesis, the development of trialkylgermanes as ‘safety-catch’ coupling precursors for biaryl and styrene synthesis was achieved. The safety-catch germanes are fluorous-tagged to facilitate parallel synthesis using fluorous SPE techniques and are activated towards Pd(0) -catalysed cross-coupling with aryl bromides by oxidative photolysis using a UV lamp. The stability profile of the fluorous-tagged arylgermanes was examined. They are stable under strong basic, nucleophilic and reductive conditions but labile in acidic and oxidative environments. This stability profile provides unique opportunities for synthetic route design in target orientated syntheses by allowing the germane group to be installed early in the sequence but only activated for cross-coupling when required. This method {{has been applied to}} the synthesis of the plant anti-fungal agent boscalid® and its alkynyl derivatives. 2) Novel Protocol for Solid Phase Synthesis of Radio-iodinated Ligands for Imaging of Cannabinoid Receptors in the Brain Rimonabant® is a CB 1 receptor antagonist indicated for the treatment of obesity, metabolic syndrome, <b>addiction</b> and smoking <b>cessation.</b> Radio-labelled analogues are potential PET (Positron Emission Tomography) and SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) imaging agents for visualising the distribution of cannabinoid receptors in the brain for medical research. Conventional methods for the preparation of radio-iodinated cannabinoid receptor ligands employ organostannane precursors which undergo electrophilic ipso-iododestannylation with concomitant formation of toxic organostannane by-products. Rigorous removed of organostannane residues is necessary prior to injection the ligand for in vivo experiments. In this thesis, a novel, non-toxic, solid-supported and facile approach for the parallel synthesis of iodinated cannabinoid receptor ligands based on the skeleton of rimonabant has been demonstrated.

40|$|Background: Smoking {{cessation}} is {{the most}} important action to reduce mortality after a coronary event. Largely, it has previously been unknown whether a smoking cessation program applicable in an ordinary clinical setting has any impact on smoking cessation rates in patients with coronary heart disease, and whether such a program is cost effective. Objectives: To determine whether a nurse managed smoking cessation intervention changes abstinence rates in patients admitted for coronary heart disease, to assess the predictors of smoking cessation, to evaluate whether smoking cessation has any impact on Quality of Life, to estimate the cost effectiveness of the smoking cessation program, and to appraise the feasibility of a fear arousal message. Design: Randomised controlled trial of usual care compared with individual smoking cessation intervention. Setting: The cardiac ward in Sørlandet Sykehus, Kristiansand, Norway. Participants: 240 smokers under 76 years of age admitted for myocardial infarction, unstable angina or cardiac bypass surgery. 118 were randomly assigned to the intervention and 122 to usual care (control group). 218 patients (91 %) completed the study and were assessable at 12 months follow up. Methods: The intervention was based on an especially made 17 page booklet and focused on fear arousal and relapse prevention. Individual smoking cessation was delivered by cardiac nurses without special training. The intervention was initiated in hospital, and the participants were telephoned regularly for at least five months. Abstinence rates were determined by self report and biochemical verification. Survival data from previously published investigations, with life time extrapolation of the survival curves by survival function modelling, were {{used to be able to}} estimate the cost effectiveness of the program. Baseline characteristics were prospectively recorded, and health-related Quality of Life was measured at baseline and at 12 months follow up. The patient satisfaction was assessed at 12 months follow up. Results: 12 months after randomisation 57. 0 % and 37. 3 % were abstinent in the intervention and control groups, respectively (95 % confidence interval for the difference 6. 4 to 33. 0). The number needed to treat to get one additional quitter was 5. 1 (95 % CI 3. 0 to 15. 6). Assuming all drop outs returned to smoking at 12 months, the cessation rates were 50. 0 % and 37. 0 % in the intervention and control group, respectively (95 % CI for the difference 0. 4 to 25. 7). In a life time perspective, the incremental cost per year of life gained by the cessation program was Euro 280 and Euro 110 in the low and high risk group, respectively (2000 prices). These costs compare favourably to other treatment modalities in patients with coronary heart disease, being approximately 1 / 25 the cost of both statins in the low risk group and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in the high risk group. In a sensitivity analysis, the costs remained low in a wide range of assumptions. The participants were in general satisfied with the cessation program, indicating that implementing a fear arousal message is a feasible method. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, a high level of nicotine addiction was a strong negative predictor of smoking cessation in both the intervention and the control group. The quitters and sustained smokers had similar improvements in all Quality of Life domains from baseline to 12 months follow up. Further, after adjustment for differences in baseline characteristics, the Quality of Life at baseline was not significantly associated with smoking cessation at 12 months follow up. Conclusions: A smoking cessation program delivered by cardiac nurses without special training, significantly reduced smoking rates 12 months after hospitalisation for coronary heart disease. The program was very cost effective compared to other treatment modalities in patients with coronary heart disease in terms of cost per life year gained. Among those with a high level of nicotine <b>addiction,</b> more effective <b>cessation</b> programs are needed...|$|R
