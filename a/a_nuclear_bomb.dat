5|$|After being {{selected}} in April 1945, Hiroshima was spared conventional bombing {{to serve as}} a pristine target, where the effects of <b>a</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>bomb</b> on an undamaged city could be observed. While damage could be studied later, the energy yield of the untested Little Boy design could be determined only at the moment of detonation, using instruments dropped by parachute from a plane flying in formation with the one that dropped the bomb. Radio-transmitted data from these instruments indicated a yield of about 15 kilotons.|$|E
5|$|Afterwards Bond visits Valentin Zukovsky at {{a casino}} to acquire {{information}} about Elektra's attackers; he discovers that Elektra's head of security, Davidov, is secretly {{in league with}} Renard. Bond kills Davidov and boards a plane bound for a Russian ICBM base in Kazakhstan. He poses as a Russian nuclear scientist, meets American nuclear physicist Christmas Jones, and enters the silo. Inside, Renard is removing the GPS locator card and weapons-grade plutonium from <b>a</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>bomb.</b> Before Bond can kill him, Jones blows his cover. Renard drops a hint that he and Elektra are collaborating and flees with the plutonium, while Bond and Jones escape the exploding silo with the locator card.|$|E

5|$|Project A119, {{also known}} as A Study of Lunar Research Flights, was a top-secret plan {{developed}} in 1958 by the United States Air Force. The aim {{of the project was}} to detonate <b>a</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>bomb</b> on the Moon which would help in answering some of the mysteries in planetary astronomy and astrogeology. If the explosive device detonated on the surface, not in a lunar crater, the flash of explosive light would have been faintly visible to people on earth with their naked eye, a show of force resulting in a possible boosting of domestic morale in the capabilities of the United States, a boost that was needed after the Soviet Union took an early lead in the Space Race and was also working on a similar project.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not clear}} what happens to the Rocket Group {{immediately}} after this: the next time Quatermass is seen on screen (Quatermass, also released internationally as The Quatermass Conclusion and Quatermass IV, 1979) he has long been retired, living in retreat in the Scottish Highlands. He has recently become the guardian of his teenaged granddaughter Hettie after her parents were killed in a road accident in Germany. After Hettie runs away from home, he travels to London in search of her and finds a dystopian world there. Quatermass and the scientist Joe Kapp establish that an alien probe is causing the collapse of society by feeding on the world's youth, and Quatermass forms a plan to drive the intruder away by the detonation of <b>a</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>bomb.</b> He presses the button to detonate it himself, with Hettie's help, and they are killed in the blast as the planet is saved.|$|E
5|$|Quatermass deduces that {{an alien}} {{life-form}} {{which comes from}} one of the moons of Saturn, which lives on ammonia, hydrogen and methane, but to which oxygen is a deadly poison, travels to earth in the meteorites, and in the few seconds they spend out of their shells before dying they possess human minds, and transmit knowledge to each other in a collective consciousness. From this, they assume that it was the population of Winnderden Flats itself who demolished the village and built the plant. Quatermass decides that they can use the remaining Quatermass II rocket like <b>a</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>bomb</b> and destroy the asteroid, much to Leo's protest at the rocket being unsafe to fly. Fowler tries to steal information about the other plants from the ministry, but is overcome and possessed by a makeshift meteorite hidden inside a filing cabinet.|$|E
