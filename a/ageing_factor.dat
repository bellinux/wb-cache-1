50|$|<b>Aging</b> <b>factors</b> can {{be defined}} as {{irreparable}} damages to cellular components which ultimately contribute to the decreased fitness of the individual harbouring them. Putative <b>aging</b> <b>factors</b> include damaged DNA strands, old cell-surface material, and mis-folded or aggregated protein. The cell poles of replicating E. coli are often used as a proxy for <b>aging</b> <b>factors</b> as each bacterium inherits an old cell-pole (mother’s pole) and a newly synthesized new cell-pole. Inclusion bodies, masses of aggregated damaged or mis-folded proteins, have recently been shown to contribute to the aging of cellular organisms.Senescence in single celled organisms is thought to arise via the asymmetric partitioning of <b>aging</b> <b>factors</b> between daughter cells. It has long been argued that, on theoretical grounds, the preferential segregation of damage in unicellular organisms would contribute to the fitness of the overall population. The single celled eukaryotic organism, Sacchoaromyces cerevisiae, retains deleterious <b>aging</b> <b>factors</b> in the mother cell leading to rejuvenation of the daughter.|$|R

An experimental design {{has been set up}} and four <b>ageing</b> <b>factors</b> were varied at two levels. The four <b>ageing</b> <b>factors</b> studied were: fouling status of the membrane, cleaning agent concentration, magnitude of the back pulse and number of applied back pulses. The integrity of the membrane modules was evaluated by means of permeability testing, pressure decay tests and bubble tests. Also tensile tests were performed to investigate the mechanical properties of the membrane modules. The collected data was used for an analysis of variance to determine which <b>ageing</b> <b>factors</b> and which combination of <b>ageing</b> <b>factors</b> influence membrane life time.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the effect of}} population ageing on macroeconomic aggregates. The author´s objective is to verify, whether there exists any relationship of the population ageing factors and the GDP growth rate, social expenditures growth rate and the consumption growth rate. Econometric models are based on theoretical specifications of Faruqee´s life-cycle model and Prettner´s R&D model with overlapping generations. The degree of economic development is also taken into account. Furthermore, the author modified the R&D model by incorporation of the poverty indicator and its application on available datasets. The research is focused on five European countries in 1995 - 2013. The Ordinary Least Squares method is used to gain estimated results in regression analyses. The author managed to prove an existing relationship between the old age dependency ratio and the social expenditures in all countries except Switzerland. The impact of the population <b>ageing</b> <b>factor</b> on the consumption growth rate {{turned out to be}} significant in all of those countries. Substantial fluctuations are shown only in Bulgaria and in the Czech Republic.

40|$|Modelling of {{lithium-ion}} batteries calendar ageing is {{often based on}} a semi-empirical approach by using, for example the Arrhenius acceleration model.

Parameter identification is typically performed without {{taking into account the}} state-of-charge (SoC) drifting. However, even in rest condition, battery cells' SoC drifts because of capacity losses (self-discharge and capacity fade).

40|$|Lifespan {{distributions}} of populations of quite diverse {{species such as}} humans and yeast seem to surprisingly well follow the same empirical Gompertz-Makeham law, which basically predicts an exponential increase of mortality rate with age. This empirical law can for example be grounded in reliability theory when individuals age through the random failure {{of a number of}} redundant essential functional units. However, ageing and subsequent death can also be caused by the accumulation of "ageing factors", for example noxious metabolic end products or genetic anomalities, such as self-replicating extra-chromosomal DNA in yeast. We first show how Gompertz-Makeham behaviour arises when <b>ageing</b> <b>factor</b> accumulation follows a deterministic self-reinforcing process. We go then on to demonstrate that such a deterministic process is a good approximation of the underlying stochastic accumulation of ageing factors where the stochastic model can also account for old-age levelling off of mortality rate.

Migration tests and natural diffusion tests were executed, based on NT build 492 and NT Build 443, respectively. Consequently, chloride migration and chloride diffusion coefficients were calculated. Based on the experimental results, the difference between both diffusion coefficients, measured after single-ion attack of chlorides as well as after multi-ion attack of chlorides and sulphates, is obtained.

From measurements of the breakdown strength of samples of real and degraded cables it has been found that A-factors do not provide reliable estimates of XLPE cable condition. However, if semi-conducting material of the cable insulation is known and cables are classified according to semi-conducting material type it is possible to get better correlation between conditions of cables as indicated by A-factors and AC breakdown voltage.

Increased age results great increases in the probability of developing AD.

40|$|We study {{generalised}} {{anomalous diffusion}} processes whose diffusion coefficient D(x,t) ∼ D_ 0 |x|^αt^β depends {{on both the}} position x of the test particle and the process time t. This process thus combines the features of scaled Brownian motion and heterogeneous diffusion parent processes. We compute the ensemble and time averaged mean squared displacements of this generalised diffusion process. The scaling exponent of the ensemble averaged mean squared displacement is shown to be {{the product of the}} critical exponents of the parent processes, and describes both subdiffusive and superdiffusive systems. We quantify the amplitude fluctuations of the time averaged mean squared displacement as function of the length of the time series and the lag time. In particular, we observe a weak ergodicity breaking of this generalised diffusion process: even in the long time limit the ensemble and time averaged mean squared displacements are strictly disparate. When we start to observe this process some time after its initiation we observe distinct features of ageing. We derive a universal <b>ageing</b> <b>factor</b> for the time averaged mean squared displacement containing all information on the ageing time and the measurement time. External confinement is shown to alter the magnitudes and statistics of the ensemble and time averaged mean squared displacements. Comment: 19 pages, 10 figures, IOPLaTe...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} {{causes of}} cancer incidence increase. We identified and quantified a population <b>ageing</b> <b>factor,</b> a factor due to incidence trend of cancer sites with early-diagnosis interventions and a remainder factor (concerning all other cancer sites). METHODS: We calculated incidence rates for two calendar period (1993 - 95 and 2003 - 05). We used data from Cancer Registries {{with at least}} one incidence year available for each period (jointly for males and female). We compared crude and age-adjusted rates by the direct method for prostate cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, melanoma of the skin cancer, thyroid cancer, group of other cancer sites and for all cancer sites (but non-melanoma skin cancer). RESULTS: Since 1993 - 95 to 2003 - 05 all cancer crude incidence rates have been increasing 17. 9 % (from 555. 4 cases for 100, 000 inhabitants/years to 654. 8). If population age structure had remained the same, rates would have increased only 6. 6 % (from 555. 4 to 592. 0) : almost 2 / 3 of observed increasing are due to population ageing. The remainder part of the increasing is due to incidence trend of cancer sites with early-diagnosis interventions (that anticipates the diagnosis).

40|$|This thesis {{contributes}} to the reliability and aging studies of supercapacitors for more efficient use in EV/HEV applications. This thesis demonstrates the effect of aging/failure in supercapacitor cells and module cells using accelerated tests employed to expedite the aging process. The tests, as explained below were categorized based on operational and environmental <b>aging</b> <b>factors</b> associated with supercapacitor failure in EV/HEV applications to; •	Investigate supercapacitor cell performance at high temperature and constant voltage individual conditions, and also simultaneously (known as calendar test) •	Investigate the effect of voltage balancing/equalization circuits on supercapacitor module cells’ performance during constant current cycling tests under certain environmental and electrical factors •	Investigate supercapacitor module cells’ cycling performance in a lab-scale designed electrical DC programmable motor load system that emulates supercapacitor operational conditions in an EV/HEV application. The aging behaviors characterized by the three factors mentioned above are quantified in this thesis through the periodic monitoring of their electrical and electrochemical state of health with Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy, Cyclic Voltammetry, and Constant Current characterization tests. These tests help identity aging modes in supercapacitors, and {{it was observed that}} regardless of their aging factors; an increase in ESR and decrease of capacitance was determined. Although this information is required, the results from Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) tests revealed more details distinctive to each <b>aging</b> <b>factor.</b> From this distinction, the aging mechanisms in relation to the <b>aging</b> <b>factors,</b> which causes the deterioration in the supercapacitor electrical performance, are identified and summarized as the following: 1.
