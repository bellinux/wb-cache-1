This lamp was the single most important <b>article</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture</b> for the Eskimo peoples in their dwellings.|$|E
2500|$|Gong'an {{was itself}} {{originally}} a metaphor—an <b>article</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture</b> {{that came to}} denote legal precedents. For example, Di Gong'an (...) is the original title of Celebrated Cases of Judge Dee, the famous Chinese detective novel based on a historical Tang dynasty judge. Similarly, Zen kōan collections are public records of the notable sayings and actions of Zen disciples and masters attempting to pass on their teachings.|$|E

60|$|Elizabeth was adorably patient. She surreptitiously drew {{towards her}} a cane chair, a doubtful-looking <b>article</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture</b> upon which she seated herself slowly {{and with great}} care.|$|E
6000|$|... "I've caught ye!" [...] he bellowed. [...] "No, ye ain't goin' to git away nuther!" [...] And {{then came}} a crash as some <b>article</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture</b> was tipped over.|$|E

60|$|We went up {{together}} {{to the room}} of the tragedy. For convenience I append a plan {{of the room and}} the principal <b>articles</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture</b> in it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Stop, Chiltern," [...] said Phineas, {{stepping}} back, so {{that there}} was some <b>article</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture</b> between him and his adversary. [...] "I do not choose {{that there should be a}} riot here." ...|$|E
60|$|As {{she talked}} her eyes took in every <b>article</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture</b> in the room, and every {{little piece of}} fancywork and bric-a-brac. In fact, she {{reproduced}} the pattern {{of one of the}} tidies within two days.|$|E
6000|$|... "A round dinner-table," [...] said he {{with some}} heat, [...] "is the most abominable <b>article</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture</b> that ever was invented. I hope that Arabin has more taste than to allow {{such a thing}} in his house." ...|$|E
60|$|So saying, he ushered his {{prisoner}} into a cell, {{or rather}} a strong {{room of the}} better order, in which there were four chairs, a truckle-bed, {{and one or two}} other <b>articles</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture.</b>|$|R
60|$|The day passed uneventfully. Rand busied {{himself in}} his usual avocations, and {{constructed}} a temporary shelter for himself and Sol beside the shaft, besides rudely shaping a few necessary <b>articles</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture</b> for Mrs. Sol.|$|R
60|$|The {{process of}} {{fumigation}} had well-nigh suffocated {{the wife and}} daughter of the trader, but, {{as soon as the}} smoke cleared away, Cyril set them all to work to carry up <b>articles</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture</b> to another bedroom on the top floor.|$|R
60|$|The {{apartment}} did {{not contain}} a single <b>article</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture.</b> One small window admitted the light, and this was so heavily barred with wooden uprights that even with a sharp saw considerable time would have been required for the prisoner to cut through.|$|E
60|$|As he spoke, Peter Macnab {{missed his}} footing {{and came down}} on the table with a crash so {{tremendous}} that the crazy <b>article</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture</b> became something like what Easterns style a split-camel--its feeble legs spread outwards, and its body came flat to the ground.|$|E
6000|$|Of course, the men {{found nothing}} that could even {{remotely}} be termed compromising. Esther {{had been very}} prudent in deference to Kennard's advice; she also had very few possessions.

5000|$|In Rome, {{wood from}} this tree was called citrum, [...] "citrus wood". It was {{considered}} very valuable, {{and was used}} for making <b>articles</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture</b> by the Greeks and Romans. Craftsmen who worked in citrus wood and ivory had their own guild (collegium).|$|R
6000|$|... "Everything {{is just as}} it was then, Sir Cyril. A few fresh <b>articles</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture</b> {{have been}} added, but Mr. Harvey would have no general change made.

50|$|This was a 2009 solo {{exhibition}} of Agee’s {{in which the}} environment mirrored the set-up of her own Brooklyn apartment. Agee’s artwork was hung against bright walls and leaned against intricate <b>articles</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture</b> throughout the faux apartment. Aside from paintings, this exhibition also included hand-crafted vases, plates, and bowls resting on pieces <b>of</b> <b>furniture</b> and armatures.|$|R
60|$|When {{the girls}} had perched {{themselves}} on any available <b>article</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture,</b> they waited with respectful eagerness, while Sally retired to the hall for a moment, and Julia rolled her eyes, with her finger on her lips, looking {{as if she could}} tell much if she dared.|$|E
60|$|Before we {{had been}} awake three minutes came a {{clattering}} as if the table was overturned, and I distinguished sounds betokening the splintering of wood, telling that some <b>article</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture</b> had been destroyed, while above such noises came the trampling of heavy feet, and shouts, and cries.|$|E
60|$|Miss Crofton looked {{round the}} room with eyes of desperate scrutiny. They at once fell on a large old-fashioned screen, covered with engravings, which Merton had picked up {{for the sake of}} two or three old mezzotints, barbarously pasted on to this <b>article</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture</b> by some ignorant owner.|$|E
40|$|Objective: Semantic verbal fluency (SVF) {{tests are}} widely used in {{clinical}} neuropsychology. We propose the standardization and clinical validation of a new SVF test based on the production of names <b>of</b> birds and <b>articles</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture</b> (Birds and <b>Articles</b> <b>of</b> <b>Furniture</b> test-BAF). Methods: A sample of 268 subjects aged 40 years or more underwent the test. The clinical validation was conducted on subjects affected by amnesic Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI; N = 106), mild (N = 178), and moderate (N = 114) Alzheimer's disease (AD). Results: The BAF total score was influenced by both age and education, whereas the single scores obtained on BAF were also influenced by gender. The percentage of subjects with pathological score on BAF increased from aMCI (19 %) to mild (45. 5 %) and moderate (71. 1 %) AD, and receiver operating characteristic curves analysis showed that the BAF may be highly reliable in distinguishing aMCI and AD patients from healthy subjects. We also provide typicality norms for birds and <b>articles</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture</b> that could be useful {{in the assessment of}} qualitative features of words produced in semantic fluency tests. Conclusions: The BAF test could be a valid and reliable tool in both clinical practice and research on subjects affected by cognitive impairment...|$|R

60|$|As Nicholas and {{his sister}} were by this time {{compelled}} to superintend the removal <b>of</b> the few <b>articles</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture,</b> Miss La Creevy devoted herself to the consolation of the matron, and observed with great kindness of manner that she must really make an effort, and cheer up.|$|R
60|$|Then, {{having no}} choice, Cicely curtseyed, first {{to her father}} and next to Christopher, to whom she sent a message with her eyes that she dared not utter with her lips, and so {{vanished}} into the shadows, where presently she was heard stumbling against some <b>article</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture.</b>|$|E
60|$|Billy {{pulled the}} ancient <b>article</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture</b> beneath the opening, {{and in another}} moment {{the two men were}} in the stuffy {{atmosphere}} of the unventilated loft. Beneath them they heard Mrs. Shorter dragging the commode back to its accustomed place, and then the sound of her footsteps descending the stair.|$|E
60|$|And Comus {{indicated}} the chair that stood in sinister isolation {{in the middle}} of the room. Never had an <b>article</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture</b> seemed more hateful in Lancelot's eyes.

60|$|I saw the {{staircase}} with its extinguished lamps. I saw {{the shadows of}} the heavy stair-rails, thrown by the watchman's lantern on the wall.

60|$|A lath-and-plaster {{partition}} {{had been}} {{run across the}} passage six feet from the end, with a door cunningly concealed in it. It was lit within by slits under the eaves.
