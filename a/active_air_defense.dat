40|$|This thesis {{document}} was issued {{under the authority}} of another institution, not NPS. At the time it was written, a copy was added to the NPS Library collection for reasons not now known. It has been included in the digital archive for its historical value to NPS. Not believed to be a CIVINS (Civilian Institutions) title. Part I of this study will examine the evolution of the U. S. <b>active</b> <b>air</b> <b>defense</b> posture between 1946 - 1966. Active defense shall be defined as those military programs designed to destroy attacking aircraft and missiles after being launched from their bases, plus the associated warning, command, control and communication equipments and organizations. The specific examination of this evolution in Section C of Chapters 1 - 3 will consider, in turn, the roles and mission aspect (i. e. the organization and definition of air defense responsibilities among the services); the research, development and procurement of the systems themselves; and finally, the deployment of the systems and the operational capability of the overall posture. Accordingly, only minimal attention will be paid therein to other "damage-limiting" programs such as: counterforce offense to destroy pro-launched enemy forces; passive defense measures to reduce the vulnerability of population or property to the effects of delivered weapons; national intelligence programs, and theater force defense. As background for this discussion, Section A of Chapters 1 - 3 will be a review of the "signals" of strategic offensive capability and intent received from the Soviet Union, e. g., authoritative statements, studies disclosure of new weapons, redeployment of forces, and other less self-conscious improvements in Soviet strategic weapons systems. Section B will then discuss how those signals were perceived in the U. S. and the apparent effect of these perceptions on the developing defensive posture. The principal questions which Part I seeks to answer are (1) to what degree is the evolution of the U. S. air defense explained as a series of actions/reactions in a strategic "dialogue" with the USSR, (2) were there other U. S. factors, biases, and influences which operated to muffle or amplify significantly the reception of those Soviet signals and distort their feedback upon the defensive systems development, (3) to what extent was the evolving U. S. air defense posture be explained as a series of purely domestic bureaucratic decision which bore no perceptible relation to the changing Soviet threat, and (4) what were the values of air defense perceived to be within the context of America's overall strategic deterrence policy. Part II will consist of a similar undertaking [...] but in somewhat less detail [...] for the evolution of air defense in the Soviet Union between 1946 - 60 /[URL] United States Navy...|$|E

The squadrons of the 144th Fighter Group were retained by the Air National Guard and not deployed, however numerous pilots from {{all three of the}} group's squadrons volunteered for combat duty. The F-51Ds were exchanged for F-51H Mustangs in 1951, as the [...] "D" [...] model of the Mustang was needed for close air support missions in Korea. The F-51H was a Very Long Range version of the Mustang, which was developed to escort B-29 Superfortress bombers to Japan, but not considered rugged enough to be used in Korea. The increased range, however, was well-suited for <b>air</b> <b>defense</b> interceptor alert flights. During its years with the P-51H, the unit earned prominence as one of the Air Force's most respected aerial gunnery competitors. In June 1953, while still flying the Mustang, the unit qualified for the first all-jet, worldwide gunnery meet. Using borrowed F-86A Sabre jets, the 144th, whichWith the increased availability of jet aircraft after the Korean War, the squadron's aircraft were upgraded from the piston-engine, propeller driven F-51H to its first jet aircraft, the F-86A Sabre Day Interceptor in 1954. At the same time, the 194th relocated to Fresno Air Terminal, followed by the wing in 1957. On 7 July 1955, the 144th was re-designated as the 194th Fighter-Interceptor Wing, a designation kept by the squadron for the next 37 years.
