25|$|A 2014 Cochrane Review {{sought to}} {{determine}} the effectiveness of occlusion treatment on patients with sensory deprivation <b>amblyopia,</b> however no trials were found eligible {{to be included in}} the review. However, it is suggested that good outcomes from occlusion treatment for sensory deprivation <b>amblyopia</b> rely on compliance with the treatment.|$|E
25|$|<b>Amblyopia</b> {{begins by}} the age of five. In adults, the {{disorder}} is estimated to affect 1–5% of the population.|$|E
25|$|The {{cause of}} <b>amblyopia</b> {{can be any}} {{condition}} that interferes with focusing during early childhood. This can occur from poor alignment of the eyes, an eye being irregularly shaped such that focusing is difficult, one eye being more nearsighted or farsighted than the other, or clouding of the lens of an eye. After the underlying cause is fixed, vision is not restored right away, as the mechanism also involves the brain. <b>Amblyopia</b> {{can be difficult to}} detect, so vision testing is recommended for all children around the ages of four to five.|$|E
25|$|Ophthalmologic {{problems}} include strabismus. This requires early identification {{to avoid}} <b>amblyopia.</b> Surgery or patching are usually necessary to treat strabismus if diagnosed early. Refractive errors {{in patients with}} FXS are also common.|$|E
25|$|In {{refractive}} and accommodative <b>amblyopia,</b> when occlusion is {{not appropriate}} sometimes atropine is given to induce blur in the good eye. Evidence suggests that atropine penalization is just as effective as occlusion in improving visual acuity.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of patients remain symptom free and able to maintain binocularity with only a slight face turn. <b>Amblyopia</b> is uncommon and, where present, rarely dense. This can be treated with occlusion, and any refractive error can also be corrected.|$|E
25|$|<b>Amblyopia,</b> {{also called}} lazy eye, is a {{disorder}} of sight {{due to the}} eye and brain not working well together. It results in decreased vision in an eye that otherwise typically appears normal. It {{is the most common}} cause of decreased vision in a single eye among children and younger adults.|$|E
25|$|A study {{provided}} evidence that children treated for <b>amblyopia</b> with eye patching had lower self-perception of social acceptance. To avoid {{a child from}} being socially marginalized by its peers due to the wearing of an eye patch, atropine eye drops may be used instead. This induces temporary blurring in the treated eye.|$|E
25|$|Early {{detection}} improves treatment success. Eye glasses {{may be all}} {{the treatment}} needed for some children. If this is not sufficient, treatments which force the child to use the weaker eye are used. This is done by either using a patch or putting atropine in the stronger eye. Without treatment, <b>amblyopia</b> typically persists into adulthood. Evidence regarding treatments for adults is poor.|$|E
25|$|In ophthalmology, {{binocular}} retinal birefringence {{screening of}} the Henle fibers (photoreceptor axons that go radially outward from the fovea) provides a reliable detection of strabismus and possibly also of anisometropic <b>amblyopia.</b> Furthermore, scanning laser polarimetry utilises the birefringence of the optic nerve fibre layer to indirectly quantify its thickness, which is of use in the assessment and monitoring of glaucoma.|$|E
25|$|Game {{developer}} James Blaha, {{who developed}} his own crowd-funded {{version of a}} dichoptic VR game for the Oculus Rift together with Manish Gupta and is continuing to experiment with the game, experienced steropsis {{for the first time}} using his game. In 2011, two cases of adults with anisometropic <b>amblyopia</b> were reported whose visual acuity and stereoacuity improved due to learning-based therapies.|$|E
25|$|For decades, {{researchers}} {{assumed that}} humans had to acquire binocular vision, in particular stereopsis, {{in early childhood}} or they would never gain it. In recent years, however, successful improvements in persons with <b>amblyopia,</b> convergence insufficiency or other stereo vision anomalies have become prime examples of neuroplasticity; binocular vision improvements and stereopsis recovery are now active areas of scientific and clinical research.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{earliest}} systems of this kind has been proposed by a research group in Nottingham University {{with the aim of}} treating <b>amblyopia,</b> using virtual reality masks or commercially available 3D shutter glasses. The group also has worked to develop perceptual learning training protocols that specifically target the deficit in stereo acuity to allow the recovery of normal stereo function even in adulthood.|$|E
25|$|Neural {{factors that}} limit acuity {{are located in}} the retina or the brain (or the pathway leading there). Examples for the first are a {{detached}} retina and macular degeneration, to name just two. Another common impairment, <b>amblyopia,</b> is caused by the visual brain not having developed properly in early childhood. In some cases, low visual acuity is caused by brain damage, such as from traumatic brain injury or stroke. When optical factors are corrected for, acuity can be considered a measure of neural well-functioning.|$|E
25|$|A {{recent study}} found that adult rats with <b>amblyopia</b> {{improved}} visual acuity two weeks after being placed into an enriched environment. The same study showed that another two weeks after ending environmental enrichment, the rats retained their visual acuity improvement. Conversely, rats in a standard environment showed no improvement in visual acuity. It was thus concluded that environmental enrichment reduces GABA inhibition and increases BDNF expression in the visual cortex. As a result, the growth and development of neurons and synapses in the visual cortex were much improved due to the enriched environment.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{pointed out that the}} {{penalization}} of one eye by means of patching or atropine drops does not provide the conditions that are necessary in order to develop or improve binocular vision. Recently, efforts have been made to propose alternative treatments of <b>amblyopia</b> that do allow for the improvement of binocular sight, for example using binasal occlusion or partially frosted spectacles in place of any eye patch, using alternating occlusion goggles or using methods of perceptual learning based on video games or virtual reality games for enhancing binocular vision.|$|E
25|$|The most renowned case of regained {{stereopsis}} {{is that of}} neuroscientist Susan R. Barry, who had had alternating infantile esotropia with diplopia, but no <b>amblyopia,</b> underwent three surgical corrections {{in childhood}} without achieving binocular vision at the time, and recovered from stereoblindness in adult age after vision therapy with optometrist Theresa Ruggiero. Barry's case has been reported on by neurologist Oliver Sacks. Also David H. Hubel, winner of the 1981 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Torsten Wiesel for their discoveries concerning information processing in the visual system, commented positively on her case. In 2009, Barry published a book Fixing My Gaze: A Scientist's Journey into Seeing in Three Dimensions, reporting on her own and several other cases of stereopsis recovery.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} several {{attempts}} {{to make use of}} modern technology for enhanced binocular eye training, in particular for treating <b>amblyopia</b> and interocular suppression. In some cases these modern techniques have improved patients' stereoacuity. Very early technology-enhanced vision therapy efforts have included the cheiroscope, which is a haploscope in which left- and or right-eye images can be blended into view over a drawing pad, and the subject may be given a task such as to reproduce a line image presented to one eye. However, historically these approaches were not developed much further and they were not put to widespread use. Recent systems are based on dichoptic presentation of the elements of a video game or virtual reality such that each eye receives different signals of the virtual world that the player's brain must combine in order to play successfully.|$|E
25|$|Hydroxocobalamin {{is another}} form of B12 {{commonly}} encountered in pharmacology, but which is not normally present in the human body. Hydroxocobalamin is sometimes denoted B12a. This form of B12 is the form produced by bacteria, and is what is converted to cyanocobalmin in the commercial charcoal filtration step of production. Hydroxocobalamin has an avid affinity for cyanide ions and {{has been used as}} an antidote to cyanide poisoning. It is supplied typically in water solution for injection. Hydroxocobalamin is thought to be converted to the active enzymic forms of B12 more easily than cyanocobalamin, and since it is little more expensive than cyanocobalamin, and has longer retention times in the body, has been used for vitamin replacement in situations where added reassurance of activity is desired. Intramuscular administration of hydroxocobalamin is also the preferred treatment for pediatric patients with intrinsic cobalamin metabolic diseases, for vitamin B12 deficient patients with tobacco <b>amblyopia</b> (which is thought to perhaps have a component of cyanide poisoning from cyanide in cigarette smoke); and for treatment of patients with pernicious anemia who have optic neuropathy.|$|E
2500|$|Eye {{patching}} {{is used in}} the orthoptic {{management of}} children at risk of lazy eye (<b>amblyopia),</b> especially strabismic or anisometropic <b>amblyopia.</b> [...] These conditions can cause visual suppression of areas of the dissimilar images by the brain such as to avoid diplopia, resulting in a loss of visual acuity in the suppressed eye and in extreme cases in blindness in an otherwise functional eye. Patching the good eye forces the amblyopic eye to function, thereby causing vision in that eye to be retained. It is important to perform “near activities” (such as reading or handiwork) when patched, thereby exercising active, attentive vision.|$|E
2500|$|Atropine is a {{medication}} to treat {{certain types of}} nerve agent and pesticide poisonings {{as well as some}} types of slow heart rate and to decrease saliva production during surgery. It is typically given intravenously or by injection into a muscle. Eye drops are also available which [...] are used to treat uveitis and early <b>amblyopia.</b> The intravenous solution usually begins working within a minute and lasts half an hour to an hour. Large doses may be required to treat some poisonings.|$|E
2500|$|For instance, one author {{summarized}} the accepted scientific {{view of the}} time with the words: [...] "Stereopsis will never be obtained unless <b>amblyopia</b> is treated, the eyes are aligned, and binocular fusion and function are achieved before the critical period for stereopsis ends. Clinical data suggest that this occurs before 24 months of age, {{but we do not}} know exactly when it occurs, because crucial pieces of basic science information are missing." [...] For purposes of illustration, reference is made to a book of doctors' handouts for patients, written for the general public and published in 2002, which summarizes the limitations in the terms in which they, at the time, were fully accepted as medical state of the art as follows: [...] "If an adult has a childhood strabismus that was never treated, it is too late to improve any <b>amblyopia</b> or depth perception, so the goal may be simply cosmetic – to make the eyes appear to be properly aligned – though sometimes treatment does enlarge the extent of side vision." [...] It has only been accepted very recently that the therapeutic approach was based on an unquestioned notion that has, since, been referred to as [...] "myth" [...] or [...] "dogma".|$|E
2500|$|Some {{people may}} suffer from other visual problems, such as color blindness, reduced contrast, mild <b>amblyopia,</b> {{cerebral}} visual impairments, inability to track fast-moving objects, {{or one of}} many other visual impairments and still have [...] "normal" [...] visual acuity. Thus, [...] "normal" [...] visual acuity by no means implies normal vision. The reason visual acuity is very widely used {{is that it is}} easily measured, its reduction (after correction) often indicates some disturbance, and that it often corresponds with the normal daily activities a person can handle, and evaluates their impairment to do them (even though there is heavy debate over that relationship).|$|E
2500|$|An eyepatch is a {{small patch}} that is worn {{in front of one}} eye. It may be a cloth patch {{attached}} around the head by an elastic band or by a string, an adhesive bandage, or a plastic device which is clipped to a pair of glasses. It is often worn by people to cover a lost or injured eye, but it also has a therapeutic use in children for the treatment of <b>amblyopia.</b> (See orthoptics and vision therapy.) Eyepatches used to block light while sleeping are referred to as a sleep mask. [...] Eyepatches associated with pirates are a stereotype originating from fiction.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{system of}} dichoptic {{presentation}} for binocular vision therapy {{has been proposed}} by researchers of the Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre. Using a modified puzzle video game Tetris, the interocular suppression of patients with <b>amblyopia</b> was successfully treated with dichotomic training in which certain parameters of the training material were systematically adapted {{during the course of}} four weeks. Clinical supervision of such procedures is required to ensure that double vision does not occur. Most of the patients who underwent this treatment gained improved visual acuity of the weaker eye, and some also showed increased stereoacuity. Another study performed at the same institute showed that dichoptic training can be more effective in adults than the more conventional <b>amblyopia</b> treatment of an eye patch. For this investigation, 18 adults played the game Tetris for one hour each day, half of the group wearing eye patches and the other half playing a dichoptic version of the game. After two weeks, the group who played dichoptically showed a significant improvement of vision in the weaker eye and in stereopsis acuity; the eye patch group had moderate improvements, which increased substantially after they, too, were given the dichoptic training afterwards. Dichoptic-based perceptual learning therapy, presented by means of a head-mounted display, is amenable also to amblyopic children, as it improves both the amblyopic eye's visual acuity and the stereo function. The researchers at McGill University have shown that one to three weeks of playing a dichoptic video game for one to two hours on a hand-held device [...] "can improve acuity and restore binocular function, including stereopsis in adults". Furthermore, {{it has been suggested that}} these effect can be enhanced by anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS).|$|E
2500|$|Proper {{development}} of normal visual acuity {{depends on a}} human or an animal having normal visual input when it is very young. Any visual deprivation, that is, anything interfering with such input over a prolonged period of time, such as a cataract, severe eye turn or strabismus, [...] anisometropia (unequal refractive error between the two eyes), or covering or patching the eye during medical treatment, will usually result in a severe and permanent decrease in visual acuity and pattern recognition in the affected eye if not treated early in life, a condition known as <b>amblyopia.</b> The decreased acuity is reflected in various abnormalities in cell properties in the visual cortex. These changes include a marked {{decrease in the number}} of cells connected to the affected eye as well as cells connected to both eyes in cortical area V1, resulting in a loss of stereopsis, i.e. depth perception by binocular vision (colloquially: [...] "3D vision"). The period of time over which an animal is highly sensitive to such visual deprivation is referred to as the critical period.|$|E
60|$|I {{am afraid}} that, despite {{the urgent need}} for strict {{attention}} to business, I was inclined to neglect my duties about this time. I had got into the habit of wandering off, either to the links, where I generally found the professor, sometimes Phyllis, or on long walks by myself. There was one particular walk along the cliffs, through {{some of the most beautiful}} scenery I have ever set eyes on, which more than any other suited my mood. I would work my way through the woods till I came to a small clearing on the very edge of the cliff. There I would sit and smoke by the hour. If ever I am stricken with smoker's heart, or staggers, or tobacco <b>amblyopia,</b> or any other of the cheery things which doctors predict for the devotee of the weed, I shall feel that I sowed the seeds of it that summer in that little clearing overlooking the sea. A man in love needs much tobacco. A man thinking out a novel needs much tobacco. I was in the grip of both maladies. Somehow I found that my ideas flowed more readily in that spot than in any other.|$|E
50|$|Deprivation <b>amblyopia</b> (<b>amblyopia</b> ex anopsia) {{results when}} the ocular media become opaque, such {{as is the}} case with {{congenital}} cataract or corneal haziness. These opacities prevent adequate visual input from reaching the eye, and disrupt development. If not treated in a timely fashion, <b>amblyopia</b> may persist even after the cause of the opacity is removed. Sometimes, drooping of the eyelid (ptosis) or some other problem causes the upper eyelid to physically occlude a child's vision, which may cause <b>amblyopia</b> quickly. Occlusion <b>amblyopia</b> may be a complication of a hemangioma that blocks some or all of the eye. Other possible causes of deprivation and occlusion <b>amblyopia</b> include obstruction in the vitreous and aphakia. Deprivation <b>amblyopia</b> accounts for less than 3% of all individuals affected by <b>amblyopia.</b>|$|E
50|$|Tobacco <b>amblyopia</b> {{is a form}} {{of toxic}} <b>amblyopia</b> caused by tobacco {{containing}} cyanide. Tobacco <b>amblyopia</b> is marked by a gradual impairment of vision characterised by visual field defects and hindered central vision.|$|E
50|$|Stereotests {{like the}} Lang stereotest are not {{reliable}} exclusion tests for <b>amblyopia.</b> A patient who passes the Lang stereotest test {{is unlikely to}} have strabismic <b>amblyopia,</b> but could nonetheless have refractive or deprivational <b>amblyopia.</b> It {{has been suggested that}} binocular retinal birefringence scanning may be able to identify, already in very young children, <b>amblyopia</b> that is associated with strabismus, microstrabismus, or reduced fixation accuracy. Diagnosis and treatment of <b>amblyopia</b> as early as possible is necessary to keep the vision loss to a minimum.|$|E
50|$|Between 2 and 5% of the {{population}} in western countries have <b>amblyopia.</b> In the U.K., 90% of visual health appointments in the child are concerning <b>amblyopia.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Amblyopia,</b> {{also known}} as lazy eye, {{is the most common}} cause of vision {{impairment}} among children. <b>Amblyopia</b> occurs when one eye is weakened because the eye and brain are not working together. The standard treatment for <b>amblyopia</b> is patching: covering the stronger eye with a patch for two hours a day to improve vision in the weaker eye. However, a recent report by the Pediatric Eye Disease Investigators Group (PEDIG) suggested that extending the daily duration of patching from two to six hours a day is effective at treating persistent <b>amblyopia.</b> The research was funded by NEI.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Amblyopia</b> {{begins by}} the age of five. In adults, the {{disorder}} is estimated to affect 1-5% of the population. While treatment improves vision, it does not typically restore it to normal in the affected eye. <b>Amblyopia</b> was first described in the 1600s. The condition may make people ineligible to be pilots or police officers. The word <b>amblyopia</b> is from Greek ἀμβλύς amblys meaning [...] "blunt" [...] and ὤψ ōps meaning [...] "sight".|$|E
