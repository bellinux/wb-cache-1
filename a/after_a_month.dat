5|$|<b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>month</b> of preparation, {{just before}} he was to assault the Confederate works at Yorktown, McClellan learned that Johnston had {{withdrawn}} up the Peninsula towards Williamsburg. McClellan was thus required to give chase without any benefit of the heavy artillery so carefully amassed in front of Yorktown. The Battle of Williamsburg on May 5 is considered a Union victory—McClellan's first—but the Confederate army was not destroyed and a bulk of their troops were successfully moved past Williamsburg to Richmond's outer defenses while the battle was waged and for several days thereafter.|$|E

The Government did not pursue them; apparently its officials considered they had been sufficiently punished.|$|E
5|$|Norving (previously Varangfly) started {{offering}} {{flights to}} the closed-down military airport in 1970 using their newly delivered Britten-Norman Islander. The background was a landing at the airfield to transport {{a baby to}} Kirkenes Hospital. The Civil Aviation Administration stated {{that they were not}} opposed to building smaller ambulance airports, but that the state's priority was constructing a network of regional airports. The service started off with a daily round trip ordered by the district physician; patients had priority, but the airline would transport other passengers as well. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>month</b> a second daily round trip was introduced.|$|E

5|$|<b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>month</b> of {{classroom}} instruction in aviation, Shepard was posted to a destroyer, , in August 1944; it was US Navy policy that aviation candidates should first have some service at sea. At {{the time the}} destroyer was deployed on active service in the Pacific Ocean. Shepard joined it when it returned to the naval base at Ulithi on October 30. After just two days at sea Cogswell helped rescue 172 sailors from the cruiser , which had been torpedoed by a Japanese submarine, then escorted the crippled ship back to Ulithi.

5|$|<b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>month</b> {{with his}} new wife, Sing {{returned}} to the trenches in France in August 1917, but was in very poor health due to his battle wounds {{and the effects of}} gas poisoning.

For this action, he was awarded the Oorlogskruis (Belgian Croix de Guerre) in 1918, and was also recommended for the Military Medal—but never received it. In November 1917, he was confined to hospital again due to problems with his previously wounded leg. In mid-February 1918, he was hospitalised due to a gunshot wound in the back.

5|$|Bart and Milhouse {{convince}} Comic Book Guy {{to publish}} a comic book he wrote titled Everyman, in which the title character can absorb superpowers from the characters of comic book he touches. The comic becomes an instant hit, and many Hollywood studios become interested in making it into a movie. Comic Book Guy agrees to let Everyman become a movie, but only if he can pick the star. When Comic Book Guy sees Homer, he considers Homer perfect for the role, as he wants Everyman to be played by a middle-aged fat man. But the studio executives realize that audiences want a physically fit actor for the role, so they hire celebrity fitness trainer Lyle McCarthy to get Homer into shape. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>month,</b> Homer becomes fit and the movie begins production.|$|E
