At the meeting, Pope Paul VI called on {{the members of the}} clergy to revive the contemplative dimension of the Gospel in the lives of both monastic and laypeople. Believing in the importance of this revival, Fr.

Using this and other contemplative literature, Meninger developed a simple method of silent prayer he called The Prayer of the Cloud.|$|R
