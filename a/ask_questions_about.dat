Oglethorpe began to <b>ask</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> the {{treatment}} of debtor prisoners, {{and a group of}} debtors, perhaps at Oglethorpe's instigation, lodged a complaint about their treatment with the mayor of London and his aldermen, who interviewed the Fleet's warden on 21 December 1728.|$|E
5|$|Series creator David Wolstencroft {{believed}} that writing Tom {{was the most}} fun, yet the hardest work compared with other characters, because he was Spooks primary protagonist. Wolstencroft chose a job in Information Technology (IT) as the cover story Tom used in his relationship with Ellie, because he felt that in real life people are reluctant to <b>ask</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> IT work. To portray the character, actor Matthew Macfadyen followed the scripts, {{and did not want}} to deviate from them, as he did not believe doing so would be useful. Macfadyen was also keen to explore parts of Tom from within him for influence.|$|E
5|$|Quantitative {{methods are}} often used to <b>ask</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> a {{population}} that is very large, making a census or a complete enumeration of all the members in that population infeasible. A 'sample' then forms a manageable subset of a population. In quantitative research, statistics are used to draw inferences from this sample regarding {{the population as a}} whole. The process of selecting a sample is referred to as 'sampling'. While it is usually best to sample randomly, concern with differences between specific subpopulations sometimes calls for stratified sampling. Conversely, the impossibility of random sampling sometimes necessitates nonprobability sampling, such as convenience sampling or snowball sampling.|$|E

5|$|When the {{legislature}} {{met for the}} first time after the 1909 election, things seemed to be going well for Rutherford and his government. He controlled a huge majority, albeit slightly reduced from the 1905 election, and enjoyed widespread popularity. His government had achieved significant success in setting up a new province, and this success looked poised to continue. Early in this new legislative session, however, two signs of trouble appeared: Liberal backbencher John R. Boyle began to <b>ask</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> the agreement between the government and the Alberta and Great Waterways Railway Company, and Cushing resigned from cabinet over his views of this same agreement.|$|E
5|$|When Marseille {{returned}} to his unit he asked his friends Franzisket, Clade and Schröer, whether they had heard {{what was happening to}} Jews and if perhaps something was underway {{that they did not know}} about. Franszisket recalled that he had heard Jews were being relocated to territory gained in the East but no more. Marseille recounted how he had attempted to <b>ask</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> Jews who had vanished from his neighbourhood, including the family doctor that had delivered him at birth. Regardless of his hero status, when he attempted to bring the subject into any conversation with people who approached him, his enquiries were either met with awkward silences, or people changed the subject or even turned away. Franzisket noticed a change in Marseille's attitude toward his nation's cause. He never spoke of this with his comrades again.|$|E

Not fitting in and deterred from taking a Religion degree, Star dropped out, married and moved to Venezuela where she co-founded an organic commune. It was here that Star asked many of the questions that formed the basis of her research. Her work is guided by interests in both technology and feminism, and it was during this time that the women's movement and Kate Millett's Sexual Politics inspired her to <b>ask</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> technology, and the effects that both good and bad technology have on oneself and on the world.|$|E
25|$|On August 14, 1997, Schmitz {{created a}} Geocities website called Bookhouse's Previews of Upcoming Movies {{as a way}} to avoid having to repeat the same {{information}} in chat rooms and message boards when people would <b>ask</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> movies that had not been released yet, or that were rumored to be at some stage of development in Hollywood. The site quickly outgrew GeoCities, and was re-launched under the name of Upcomingmovies.com in early 1998. By October 1999, the site was earning enough of an income from advertising that Schmitz was able to quit his day job as a librarian. In 2001, Schmitz teamed up with Yahoo! Movies, bringing the site there under the new name of Greg's Previews of Upcoming Movies. Schmitz also moved to Santa Monica, California as part of the change, and during his time in California, he co-starred in a television pilot for MGM Television called The Movie Fan Show, was frequently quoted in publications like USA Today and The Chicago Sun-Times, and made several radio appearances, including The Howard Stern Show.|$|E

500|$|Aspasia ( [...] ; c. 470 BC [...] c. 400 BC) was an {{influential}} immigrant to Classical-era Athens {{who was the}} lover and partner of the statesman Pericles. The couple had a son, Pericles the Younger, but the full details of the couple's marital status are unknown. According to Plutarch, her house became an intellectual centre in Athens, attracting the most prominent writers and thinkers, including the philosopher Socrates. It has also been suggested that the teachings of Aspasia influenced Socrates. Aspasia is mentioned {{in the writings of}} Plato, Aristophanes, Xenophon, and others. [...] Though she spent most of her adult life in Greece, few details of her life are fully known. Some scholars suggest that Aspasia was a brothel keeper and a prostitute. Aspasia's role in history provides crucial insight {{to the understanding of the}} women of ancient Greece. Very little is known about women from her time period. One scholar stated that, [...] "To <b>ask</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> Aspasia's life is to <b>ask</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> half of humanity." ...|$|E
500|$|Clive Owen, {{discussing}} the film's relevance, said it [...] "ultimately does <b>ask</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> whether banks use people's money appropriately, and if they're completely sound institutions."

500|$|When Valkyrie premiered in New York City on December 15, 2008, it {{was shown}} in a private {{screening}} room at the Time Warner Center, rather than at a Lincoln Square theater. The venue was chosen in part to minimize the exposure to Scientology protesters gathered at the Time Warner Center. Protesters also appeared at the December 18 Los Angeles screening, where Cruise entered through a tunnel. While the US [...] "red carpet" [...] was held in private, Cruise interacted with fans in South Korea and Europe. There were small anti-Scientology protests at the European premiere in Berlin, where Cruise signed one protester's Guy Fawkes mask. Anti-Scientology protests also occurred at the London premiere, and Amsterdam where Scientologists in the crowd engaged the protesters. The NTV news report about the January 26 Moscow premiere noted that journalists had to sign a document promising not to <b>ask</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> Scientology, and their questions would be censored; to this, the reporter remarked, [...] "You can't help getting reminded of those historic times depicted in Operation Valkyrie." ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{the film}} is not {{essentially}} experimental, at several points it undermines the narrative reality. James Bernardoni notes Allen's way of opening the film by facing the camera, which immediately intrudes upon audience involvement in the film. In one famous scene, Allen's character, in line {{to see a movie}} with Annie, listens to a man behind him deliver misinformed pontifications on the significance of Fellini's and Marshall McLuhan's work. Allen pulls McLuhan himself from just off camera to personally correct the man's errors. Later in the film, when we see Annie and Alvy in their first extended talk, [...] "mental subtitles" [...] convey to the audience the characters' nervous inner doubts. An animated scene—with artwork based on the comic strip Inside Woody Allen—depicts Alvy and Annie in the guise of the Wicked Queen from Snow White. Although Allen uses each of these techniques only once, the [...] "fourth wall" [...] is broken several other times when characters address the camera directly. In one, Alvy stops several passers-by to <b>ask</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> love, and in another he shrugs off writing a happy ending to his relationship with Annie in his autobiographical first play as forgivable [...] "wish-fulfillment." [...] Allen chose to have Alvy break the fourth wall, he explained, [...] "because I felt many {{of the people in the}} audience had the same feelings and the same problems. I wanted to talk to them directly and confront them." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{allowing}} {{directors and}} writers {{to work within}} Marvel's shared universe concept, Joe Russo said that Feige has [...] "big pieces that he knows he wants to build towards, but {{the way that you}} get there is open to interpretation and improv a little bit." [...] For the Russos in The Winter Soldier, they {{had to deal with the}} idea of S.H.I.E.L.D. being infiltrated by Hydra, with Joe saying, [...] "how we get there is all up to us. And I think why Marvel has been so successful is because it's been such a clear plan, that everything is interconnected and they're building emotional capital with each movie that you can then trade off of in the next film." [...] Joe later elaborated that once each film's creative team [...] "come up with conceptually what we want to do" [...] for a film, then we will <b>ask</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> whether this would interfere with a storyline in another movie. Or, what's going on in that film, can we pull some of that into this film? That's where you start looking for the interconnectedness, but it's very important early on that the concept be created in a bubble because you have to protect the idea, it has to be driven by storytelling. Kevin's ... always in the mindset of [...] "let's just make this movie now and worry about the next movie when it comes." ...|$|E
