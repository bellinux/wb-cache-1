5|$|Congenital {{malformation}} or underdevelopment (hypoplasia) of the cerebellar vermis is {{a characteristic}} of both Dandy–Walker syndrome and Joubert syndrome. In very rare cases, the entire cerebellum may be absent. The inherited neurological disorders Machado–Joseph disease, <b>ataxia</b> telangiectasia, and Friedreich's <b>ataxia</b> cause progressive neurodegeneration linked to cerebellar loss. Congenital brain malformations outside the cerebellum can, in turn, cause herniation of cerebellar tissue, as seen in some forms of Arnold–Chiari malformation.|$|E

40|$|Cerebellar <b>ataxias</b> {{comprise}} {{a wide range}} of etiologies leading to central nervous system-related motor and non-motor symptoms. Recently, a large body of evidence has demonstrated a high frequency of non-motor manifestations in cerebellar <b>ataxias,</b> specially in autosomal dominant spinocerebellar <b>ataxias</b> (SCA). Among these non-motor dysfunctions, sleep disorders have been recognized, although still under or even misdiagnosed. In this review, we highlight the main sleep disorders related to cerebellar <b>ataxias</b> focusing on REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), restless legs syndrome (RLS), periodic limb movement in sleep (PLMS), excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), insomnia and sleep apnea...|$|R

5|$|Additional {{caution is}} {{required}} in the elderly, as they are {{more sensitive to the}} pharmacological effects of benzodiazepines, metabolise them more slowly, and are more prone to adverse effects, including drowsiness, amnesia (especially anterograde amnesia), <b>ataxia,</b> hangover effects, confusion, and falls.|$|E

40|$|The {{hereditary}} <b>ataxias</b> are a {{group of}} genetically defined neurological diseases, which are characterized by a heterogeneous clinical presentation. Their overall prevalence {{is estimated to be}} 3 - 9 / 100, 000. The autosomal dominant cerebellar <b>ataxias</b> (spinocerebellar <b>ataxias</b> - SCA), the recessive <b>ataxias</b> and the other forms of inherited <b>ataxias</b> often present with a core of cerebellar deficits (the so-called cerebellar syndrome) combining oculomotor disorders, dysarthria, dysmetria/kinetic tremor, and/or ataxic gait, although other signs of neurological involvement may predominate. During the last 20 years, there has been increasing debate about the possible non-motor roles of the cerebellar circuitry. In particular, cerebellar modules would be involved in fronto-executive functions, visuo-constructive skills, behaviour and affect/emotion. Numerous studies carried out in spontaneous or engineering mutant mice reinforce the idea that cerebellar damage affects both cognition and emotions-related behaviours. Clinical descriptions of hereditary <b>ataxias</b> report such cognitive deficits to variable extents, confirmed by neuropsychological studies. Deficits mainly fall in the following domains: executive control, attention, memory and learning, visuo-spatial abilities and language. The confrontation with imaging investigations and neuropathological studies, the comparison of the symptoms found in the various inherited <b>ataxias</b> as well as data obtained in animals suggest that these deficits result from disruption of cerebro-cerebellar connections. Data support the hypothesis that the cerebellar circuitry tunes and integrates the information in these networks in order to provide the necessary pre-processing and to increase the automaticity with the aim of reaching elaborate abstraction.

40|$|Cerebellar <b>ataxias</b> {{represent}} {{a group of}} disabling neurological disorders. Our understanding of the pathogenesis of cerebellar <b>ataxias</b> is continuously expanding. A considerable number of laboratory animals with neurological mutations have been reported and numerous relevant animal models mimicking the phenotype of cerebellar <b>ataxias</b> are becoming available. These models greatly help dissecting the numerous mechanisms of cerebellar dysfunction, a major step {{for the assessment of}} therapeutics targeting a given deleterious pathway and for the screening of old or newly synthesized chemical compounds. Nevertheless, differences between animal models and human disorders should not be overlooked and difficulties in terms of characterization should not be occulted. The identification of the mutations of many hereditary <b>ataxias,</b> the development of valuable animal models, and the recent identifications of the molecular mechanisms underlying cerebellar disorders {{represent a}} combination of key factors for the development of anti-ataxic innovative therapies. It is anticipated that the twenty-first century will be the century of effective therapies in the field of cerebellar <b>ataxias.</b> The animal models are a cornerstone to reach this goal.

5|$|Its {{toxicity}} {{is due to}} tetrodotoxin, {{which is}} concentrated particularly in the liver, ovaries, intestines and skin. Many species of pufferfish bear this toxin, obtaining it from tetrodotoxin-containing bacteria in their diet. Eating the fish can have fatal consequences. The symptoms of poisoning, which are predominantly neurological, include <b>ataxia,</b> in addition to numbness and/or paraesthesia (tingling) around the mouth, lips, and limb extremities. Cases of pets being poisoned have occurred when the fish have been left where they can eat them.|$|E

Jack Russells can live from 13 to 16 years given proper care. However, certain lines have been noted for having specific health concerns and, therefore, could occur in any line or generation because of recessive genes.

40|$|The {{cerebellar}} <b>ataxias</b> are a {{group of}} incurable brain disorders that are caused primarily by the progressive dysfunction and degeneration of cerebellar Purkinje cells.

Recent advances in the field of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology offer new possibilities to better understand and potentially reverse disease pathology. Given the neurodevelopmental phenotypes observed in several types of <b>ataxias,</b> iPSC-based models have the potential to provide significant insights into disease progression, as well as opportunities for the development of early intervention therapies. To date, however, very few studies have successfully used iPSC-derived cells to cerebellar <b>ataxias.</b> In this review, we focus on recent breakthroughs in generating human iPSC-derived Purkinje cells.

5|$|Although benzodiazepines {{are much}} safer in {{overdose}} than their predecessors, the barbiturates, {{they can still}} cause problems in overdose. Taken alone, they rarely cause severe complications in overdose; statistics in England showed that benzodiazepines were responsible for 3.8% of all deaths by poisoning from a single drug. However, combining these drugs with alcohol, opiates or tricyclic antidepressants markedly raises the toxicity. The elderly are {{more sensitive to the}} side effects of benzodiazepines, and poisoning may even occur from their long-term use. The various benzodiazepines differ in their toxicity; temazepam appears most toxic in overdose and when used with other drugs. The symptoms of a benzodiazepine overdose may include; drowsiness, slurred speech, nystagmus, hypotension, <b>ataxia,</b> coma, respiratory depression, and cardiorespiratory arrest.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Cerebellar <b>ataxias</b> are a {{group of}} {{disabling}} neurological disorders. Patients exhibit a cerebellar syndrome and can also present with extra-cerebellar deficits, namely pigmentary retinopathy, extrapyramidal movement disorders, pyramidal signs, cortical symptoms (seizures, cognitive impairment/behavioural symptoms), and peripheral neuropathy. Recently, deficits in cognitive operations have been unraveled. Cerebellar <b>ataxias</b> are heterogeneous both at the phenotypic and genotypic point of view. Therapeutical trials performed during these last 4 decades have failed in most cases, in particular because drugs were not targeting a deleterious pathway, but were given to counteract putative defects in neurotransmission. The identification of the causative mutations of many hereditary <b>ataxias,</b> the development of relevant animal models and the recent identifications of the molecular mechanisms underlying <b>ataxias</b> are impacting {{on the development of}} new drugs. We provide an overview of the pharmacological treatments currently used in the clinical practice and we discuss the drugs under development...|$|R
5|$|Canadian {{neurologist}} C. Miller Fisher {{described the}} variant {{that bears his}} name in 1956. British neurologist Edwin Bickerstaff, based in Birmingham, described the brainstem encephalitis type in 1951 with Philip Cloake, and made further contributions with another paper in 1957. Guillain had reported on some of these features prior to their full description in 1938. Further subtypes have been described since then, such as the form featuring pure <b>ataxia</b> and the type causing pharyngeal-cervical-brachial weakness. The axonal subtype was first described in the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Checkpoint Proteins can be {{separated}} into four groups: phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-like protein kinase, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-like group, two serine/threonine(S/T) kinases and their adaptors. Central to all DNA damage induced checkpoints responses {{is a pair}} of large protein kinases belonging to the first group of PI3K-like protein kinases-the ATM (<b>Ataxia</b> telangiectasia mutated) and ATR (Ataxia- and Rad-related) kinases, whose sequence and functions have been well conserved in evolution. All DNA damage response requires either ATM or ATR because they have the ability to bind to the chromosomes at the site of DNA damage, together with accessory proteins that are platforms on which DNA damage response components and DNA repair complexes can be assembled.|$|E
5|$|Frusciante {{wrote and}} {{recorded}} {{a plethora of}} songs {{during and after the}} By the Way tour. In February 2004, he started a side project with Joe Lally of Fugazi and Josh Klinghoffer, called <b>Ataxia.</b> The group was together for about two weeks, during which they recorded about ninety minutes of material. After two days in the recording studio, they played two shows at the Knitting Factory in Hollywood, and spent two more days in the studio before disbanding. Later that year, five songs provided by Frusciante appeared on The Brown Bunny soundtrack.|$|E
50|$|Despite dyschronometria's easily {{recognizable}} symptoms, {{the fact}} that they may also be present in other cerebellar <b>ataxias</b> can make diagnosis difficult. Other <b>ataxias</b> may also have symptoms that affect gait, speech, thought process, spatial awareness, and time orientation used in their diagnoses, covering up {{the fact that}} most of these patients also have dyschronometria. The most common <b>ataxias</b> dyschronometria has been seen to be evident in are dyssynergia, dysmetria, dysdiadochokinesia, dysarthria as well as <b>ataxias</b> effecting stance and gait. Dyslexia can be another problem in those individuals affected by dyschronometria, however it is uncertain whether dyslexia is developed or worsened by having it, or if it is the opposite in that having dyslexia increases the chance of developing dyschronometria. Another problem that dyschronometria faces in detection is that it is a relatively new term for this side effect and precursor to dementia, compared with other cerebellar <b>ataxias</b> such as those mentioned above. Even when dyschronometria is detected, it has usually progressed to the point where it cannot be reversed, and there is no benefit in taking the testing medication to either slow down the dyschronometria or the process of dementia setting in, which is what dyschronometria is a signal for.|$|R
40|$|Among the {{hereditary}} <b>ataxias,</b> {{autosomal recessive}} cerebellar <b>ataxias</b> (ARCAs) encompass {{a diverse group}} of rare neurodegenerative disorders in which a cerebellar syndrome is the key clinical feature. The clinical overlap between the different cerebellar <b>ataxias,</b> the occasional atypical phenotypes, and the genetic heterogeneity often complicate the clinical management of such patients. Despite the steady increase in newly discovered ARCA genes, many patients with a putative ARCA cannot be genotyped yet, proving that more genes must be involved.

5|$|In 1982, the US Mint began minting pennies {{coated in}} copper but {{containing}} primarily zinc. The new zinc pennies pose {{a risk of}} zinc toxicosis, which can be fatal. One reported case of chronic ingestion of 425 pennies (over 1kg of zinc) resulted in death due to gastrointestinal bacterial and fungal sepsis. Another patient who ingested 12grams of zinc showed only lethargy and <b>ataxia</b> (gross lack of coordination of muscle movements). Several other cases have been reported of humans suffering zinc intoxication by the ingestion of zinc coins.|$|E
5|$|In other diseases, {{defects in}} nuclear genes lead to {{dysfunction}} of mitochondrial proteins. This {{is the case}} in Friedreich's <b>ataxia,</b> hereditary spastic paraplegia, and Wilson's disease. These diseases are inherited in a dominance relationship, as applies to most other genetic diseases. A variety of disorders can be caused by nuclear mutations of oxidative phosphorylation enzymes, such as coenzyme Q10 deficiency and Barth syndrome. Environmental influences may interact with hereditary predispositions and cause mitochondrial disease. For example, there may be a link between pesticide exposure and the later onset of Parkinson's disease. Other pathologies with etiology involving mitochondrial dysfunction include schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, dementia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, stroke, cardiovascular disease, chronic fatigue syndrome, retinitis pigmentosa, and diabetes mellitus.|$|E

40|$|In recent decades, a {{long and}} {{increasing}} list of monogenic neurodegenerative <b>ataxias</b> has been identified, allowing for better characterization of the pathophysiology, phenotype and prognosis of this heterogeneous group of disorders, while also revealing potential new therapeutic targets. However, the heterogeneity {{and complexity of the}} genotype-phenotype relationships and the high costs of molecular genetics often make it difficult for clinicians to decide on a molecular investigation based on an unbiased rational plan. Clinical history is essential to guide the diagnostic workup, but often the phenotype does not hold enough specificity to allow for predicting the genotype. The Group of Neurogenetics of the Centro Hospitalar São João, a multidisciplinary team of neurologists and geneticists with special interest in neurogenetic disorders, devised consensus recommendations for the investigation of the genetic aetiology of neurodegenerative <b>ataxias</b> in clinical practice, based on international consensus documents (currently containing potentially outdated information) and published scientific evidence on this topic.
