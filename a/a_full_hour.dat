5|$|In late November 1918 the 4th Division began a road {{march of}} more than 125 miles from the French city of Metz toward the German city of Koblenz, on the Rhine River. The final {{destination}} of Middleton's 47th Regiment would be the town of Adenau, 35 miles due west of Koblenz. The road trip took fifteen days of moving through almost incessant rain and ended in a driving snowstorm on 15 December. During the march, Middleton broke character and rode a horse during most of each day, surveying his troops and occasionally dismounting to talk with them. The formation marched for fifty minutes of each hour, and rested for ten, with <b>a</b> <b>full</b> <b>hour</b> for lunch.|$|E
5|$|At {{first he}} took soft clay in his bill {{from the edge}} of the water and seemed to be {{smearing}} it on one leg near the knee. Then he fluttered away on one foot for a short distance and seemed to be pulling tiny roots and fibers of grass, which he worked into the clay that he had already smeared on his leg. Again he took some clay and plastered it over the fibers, putting on more and more till I could plainly see the enlargement, working away with strange, silent intentness for fully fifteen minutes, while I watched and wondered, scarce believing my eyes. Then he stood perfectly still for <b>a</b> <b>full</b> <b>hour</b> under an overhanging sod, where the eye could with difficulty find him, his only motion meanwhile being an occasional rubbing and smoothing of the clay bandage with his bill, until it hardened enough to suit him, whereupon he fluttered away from the brook and disappeared in the thick woods.|$|E

As Task Force 34 proceeded south they were further delayed when the battle force had to slow to 12 knots so that the battleships could refuel their escorting destroyers.

25|$|With the July move, {{many of the}} {{previously}} devoted viewers began abandoning the program. Jeopardy! became the seventh show since 1968 to fail at 1:30p.m. EST (12:30p.m. CST), and a cancellation notice was issued by November 1974. Its replacement was the expansion of Another World to <b>a</b> <b>full</b> <b>hour,</b> the first daytime serial to expand to that duration; in April 1975, another serial, Days of Our Lives began occupying that time slot and eventually brought success to NBC there. Jeopardy! broadcast the 2,753rd and final episode of its original network run on January 3, 1975. Some affiliates, including KNBC in Los Angeles, aired reruns in various other time slots through {{the first quarter of}} that year. To compensate Griffin for canceling the program, which still had a year left on its contract, NBC purchased Wheel of Fortune, another creation of his, which premiered on January 6, 1975 at 10:30a.m. Eastern (9:30 Central).|$|E
25|$|All My Children (often {{shortened}} to AMC) is an American television {{soap opera}} that aired on ABC for 41 years, from January 5, 1970, to September 23, 2011, and on The Online Network (TOLN) from April 29 to September 2, 2013, via Hulu, Hulu Plus, and iTunes. Created by Agnes Nixon, All My Children {{is set in}} Pine Valley, Pennsylvania, a fictional suburb of Philadelphia, which is modeled on the actual Philadelphia suburb of Rosemont. The original series featured Susan Lucci as Erica Kane, one of daytime television's most popular characters. The title of the series refers to the bonds of humanity. All My Children was the first new network daytime drama to debut in the 1970s. Originally owned by Creative Horizons, Inc., the company created by Nixon and her husband, Bob, the show was sold to ABC in January 1975. The series started at a half-hour in per-installment length, then was expanded to <b>a</b> <b>full</b> <b>hour</b> on April 25, 1977. Earlier, the show had experimented with the full-hour format for one week starting on June 30, 1975, after which Ryan's Hope premiered.|$|E
25|$|During the 1960s, General Hospital earned decent ratings {{against the}} likes of To Tell the Truth and The Secret Storm on CBS, {{but there was a}} decline as the 1970s came, {{especially}} when NBC's Another World became highly popular. For two years, it also faced CBS' The Price Is Right, already a major hit. After continued mediocrity in the Nielsen ratings, ABC was prepared to cancel General Hospital, but decided to give it a second chance in 1977 when it expanded the show to <b>a</b> <b>full</b> <b>hour,</b> from an experimental 45 minutes. However, the expansion came with an ultimatum to the producers that they had six months to improve the show's ratings. Gloria Monty was hired as the new executive producer, and on her first day, she spent an extra $100,000 re-taping four episodes. A miracle occurred thanks to Monty and head writer Douglas Marland; the show became the most watched daytime drama by 1979, marking a rare instance of a daytime serial's comeback from near-extinction. During the wedding of Luke and Laura Spencer on November 17, 1981, about 30 million people tuned in to watch them exchange vows and be cursed by Elizabeth Taylor's Helena Cassadine (later played by Constance Towers).|$|E

500|$|Around eleven, {{the five}} {{warships}} began a salvo of broadside fire that flattened the flimsy American breastworks and panicked the Connecticut militia.

Nearly eighty guns fired at the shore for <b>a</b> <b>full</b> <b>hour.</b> The Americans were half buried under dirt and sand, and were unable to return fire due to the smoke and dust.

500|$|Erik Adams of The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} episode a [...] "B‚Äì".

He felt that Michael's plot was funny, but had issues. He argued that the retooling of Michael's character made him a more likable character {{even when he was}} doing something inappropriate; in this episode, however, his behavior is too cringe-inducing. Adams praised the scene wherein Dwight emerged from the box, calling it one of [...] "The Offices first great sigh gags". Furthermore, he felt that the scene was symbolic, as it produced [...] "a stronger, deadlier, better character".|$|E
