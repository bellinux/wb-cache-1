5|$|Epacris impressa regenerates after bushfire by {{seed and}} resprouting. Fieldwork in {{heathland}} in the Otway Ranges {{in the years}} following the 1983 <b>Ash</b> <b>Wednesday</b> bushfires showed that large numbers of E. impressa seedlings appeared in some areas, and that flowering took place as early as the second year after the fire.|$|E

Hawke has directed two feature films, three Off-Broadway plays, and a documentary, and written the novels The Hottest State (1996), <b>Ash</b> <b>Wednesday</b> (2002), and Rules for a Knight (2015).|$|E
5|$|Muskrats have {{sometimes}} been a food resource for North Americans. In the southeastern portion of Michigan, a longstanding dispensation allows Catholics to consume muskrat as their Friday penance, on <b>Ash</b> <b>Wednesday,</b> and on Lenten Fridays (when the eating of meat, except for fish, is prohibited); this tradition {{dates back to}} at least the early 19th century.|$|E
5|$|On 24 February 1784, (<b>Ash</b> <b>Wednesday),</b> in {{a secret}} and well planned move, Tipu arrested {{a large number of}} Christians across the {{province}} of Canara and other parts of his kingdom. Accounts of the number of captives range from 30,000 to 80,000. According to historian Kranti Farias, all arrests may not have been made on a single day, but instead carried out in stages.|$|E
5|$|Major event tourism, {{especially}} events {{centred on}} Catholicism, {{is an important}} segment of the Maltese tourism sector. During Holy Week, processions and religious services dominate the country and food stalls are {{set up in the}} village squares of Malta. Another popular major event is Carnival, a five centuries-old traditional celebration lasting for the five days preceding <b>Ash</b> <b>Wednesday.</b> Celebrations for Carnival involve float-based pageants, street parties and street food stalls. They are mostly Roman Catholic.|$|E
5|$|Seton Hall offers {{multiple}} dining options {{ranging from}} a traditional cafeteria to a food court. Some options include Build Your Own Burgers (BYOB) and Dunkin Donuts. In 2013, University officials decided that meat would not be served in the cafeteria on <b>Ash</b> <b>Wednesday</b> and Fridays during the liturgical season of Lent in practice of the abstinence of meat during the Lenten season. In 2014, the policy was implemented to all on-campus eateries.|$|E
5|$|The Carnival {{season has}} {{expanded}} throughout the late fall and winter: {{balls in the}} city may be scheduled as early as November, with the parades beginning after January 5 and the Twelfth Day of Christmas or Epiphany on January 6. Carnival celebrations end at midnight on Mardi Gras, a moveable feast related to the timing of Lent and Easter. The next day is <b>Ash</b> <b>Wednesday</b> {{and the beginning of}} Lent, the 40-day penitential season before Easter.|$|E
5|$|One unique {{feature of}} the ELCA {{calendar}} {{is that it has}} given congregations the options of two dates for the Transfiguration. Following most other Western Churches, the ELCA moved the Transfiguration from its August 6 date to the Last Sunday after Epiphany (the Sunday immediately preceding <b>Ash</b> <b>Wednesday)</b> as an option to the traditional Last Sunday after Epiphany in an effort to encourage a wider observance of the Transfiguration within congregations. However, the traditional date of August 6 was left on the calendar. Congregations were given the option of observing Transfiguration on the Last Sunday after the Epiphany and August 6, thus leaving open the possibility that the Transfiguration could be commemorated twice within a calendar year. In Sweden, Transfiguration Day is celebrated on the seventh Sunday after Trinity Sunday, which is the eighth Sunday after Pentecost.|$|E
5|$|The Caribbean Carnival is an {{important}} part of Dominican culture. Originally featuring masquerade songs (chanté mas) and other local traditions, traditional Carnival, Mas Domnik, came to be dominated by imported calypso music and steel bands in the early 1960s; calypso appealed to Carnival-goers because the lyrical focus on local news and gossip was similar to that of chanté mas, despite a rhythmic pattern and instrumentation which contrast sharply with traditional Dominican Mas Domnik music. After a fire in 1963, the traditional Carnival was banned, though calypso and steelpan continued to grow in popularity. Modern Carnival on Dominica takes place on the Monday and Tuesday before <b>Ash</b> <b>Wednesday,</b> and is a festive occasion during which laws against libel and slander are suspended. The modern Dominican Carnival is heavily based on the Trinidadian celebration, but is not as commercialized due to a lack of corporate sponsorship.|$|E
5|$|In New York and {{northern}} New Jersey, the storm system left the most coastal damage since the 1944 Great Atlantic hurricane. Numerous boats were damaged or destroyed, killing two people off Staten Island. High winds swept a man off a bridge, killing him. High waves flooded {{the beach at}} Coney Island. In Sea Bright, New Jersey, waves washed over a seawall, forcing 200 people to evacuate. Further inland, the Hudson, Passaic, and Hackensack rivers experienced tidal flooding. Outside Massachusetts, damage was heaviest in southern New Jersey, where the cost was estimated at $75 million (1991 USD). Across the area, tide heights reached their highest since the 1944 hurricane, leaving severe coastal and back bay flooding and closing many roads. The storm caused significant beach erosion, with 500,000 cubic yards (382,000 cubic meters) lost in Avalon, as well as $10 million damage to the beach in Cape May. The presence of a dune system mitigated the erosion in some areas. There was damage to the Atlantic City Boardwalk. Fire Island National Seashore was affected, washing away an entire row of waterfront houses in towns like Fair Harbor. Following the storm, there was a moratorium on clamming in the state's bays, due to contaminated waters. Along the Delmarva Peninsula, there was widespread water damage to homes, including ten affected houses in Sandbridge Beach, Virginia. Tides in Ocean City, Maryland, reached a record height of , while elsewhere the tides were similar to the <b>Ash</b> <b>Wednesday</b> Storm of 1962.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Ash</b> <b>Wednesday</b> bushfires, {{known in}} South Australia as <b>Ash</b> <b>Wednesday</b> II, were {{a series of}} bushfires that {{occurred}} in south-eastern Australia on 16 February 1983, which was <b>Ash</b> <b>Wednesday</b> in the Christian calendar. Within twelve hours, more than 180 fires fanned by winds of up to 110km/h (68mph) caused widespread destruction across the states of Victoria and South Australia. Years of severe drought and extreme weather combined to create one of Australia's worst fire days in a century. The fires became the deadliest bushfire in Australian history until the Black Saturday bushfires in 2009.|$|E
25|$|In the Republic of Ireland, <b>Ash</b> <b>Wednesday</b> is National No Smoking Day. The {{date was}} chosen because quitting smoking ties in with giving up luxury for Lent. In the United Kingdom, No Smoking Day was held {{for the first time}} on <b>Ash</b> <b>Wednesday</b> 1984, but is now fixed as the second Wednesday in March.|$|E

25|$|<b>Ash</b> <b>Wednesday,</b> {{a day of}} fasting, is {{the first}} day of Lent in Western Christianity. It occurs 46 days (40 fasting days, if the six Sundays, which are not days of fast, are excluded) before Easter and can fall as early as February 4 or as late as March 10. <b>Ash</b> <b>Wednesday</b> is {{observed}} by many Western Christians, including Anglicans, Lutherans, Methodists, Presbyterians, and Roman Catholics.|$|E
25|$|Robin Knowles Wallace {{states that}} the {{traditional}} <b>Ash</b> <b>Wednesday</b> church service includes Psalm 51 (the Miserere), prayers of confession and the sign of ashes. No single one of the traditional services contains all of these elements. The Anglican Church's traditional <b>Ash</b> <b>Wednesday</b> service, titled A Commination, contains the first two elements, but not the third. On the other hand, the Catholic Church's traditional service has the blessing and distribution of ashes but, while prayers of confession and recitation of Psalm 51 (the first psalm at Lauds on all penitential days, including <b>Ash</b> <b>Wednesday)</b> {{are a part of}} its general traditional <b>Ash</b> <b>Wednesday</b> liturgy, they are not associated specifically with the rite of blessing the ashes. The rite of blessing has acquired an untraditional weak association with that particular psalm only since 1970, when it was inserted into the celebration of Mass, at which a few verses of Psalm 51 are used as a responsorial psalm. Coincidentally, it was only about the same time that in some areas Anglicanism resumed the rite of ashes.|$|E
25|$|By 2008 some Protestant {{churches in}} Houston began celebrating <b>Ash</b> <b>Wednesday</b> {{in order to}} {{increase}} spirituality in their followers and prepare them for Easter.|$|E
25|$|Ordinary Time {{continues}} {{through the day}} before <b>Ash</b> <b>Wednesday,</b> which falls between 4 February and 10 March (inclusive), and {{marks the beginning of}} the Season of Lent. Thus, for Roman Catholics, the period of Ordinary Time between Christmas and Lent may end amid the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, or ninth week of Ordinary Time. <b>Ash</b> <b>Wednesday</b> is a moveable feast which occurs on the 40th day (excluding Sundays) before the Solemnity of the Resurrection of the Lord (Easter Sunday).|$|E
25|$|In {{the medieval}} period, {{the day before}} <b>Ash</b> <b>Wednesday</b> was the {{required}} annual day of confessing one's sins and receiving absolution and instructions on the penances to be performed during Lent, the reason it was called Shrove Tuesday. Shrove Tuesday or Mardi Gras (Fat Tuesday) was also {{the last day of}} the Carnival season, which continues until Saturday in areas where the Ambrosian Rite, with its later Lent, is observed. Dutch tradition holds the custom to eat salted herring on <b>Ash</b> <b>Wednesday</b> to conclude the carnival in the Netherlands.|$|E
25|$|The {{celebrations}} begin {{early on}} Mardi Gras, which can fall on any Tuesday between February 3 and March 9 (depending {{on the date}} of Easter, and thus of <b>Ash</b> <b>Wednesday).</b>|$|E
25|$|The University of Southern Mississippi {{is one of}} the few {{universities}} to allow a two-day holiday each year for Mardi Gras. The university does not hold classes on the Monday and Tuesday before <b>Ash</b> <b>Wednesday.</b>|$|E
25|$|Although not as {{well known}} as the Carnival of Veracruz, a number of {{communities}} in the state hold Carnival celebrations {{in the days leading}} up to <b>Ash</b> <b>Wednesday.</b> These include Jiutepec, Tlaltizapán, Emiliano Zapata, Tepoztlán, Tlayacapan, Yautepec, and Xochitepec. What distinguishes carnivals in Morelos from others in Mexico is the participation of the Chinelos and bands with wind instruments. In Tepotzlan on the Sunday before <b>Ash</b> <b>Wednesday,</b> the traditional tianguis market is cleared away from the main square and hundreds of multicolored stands move onto the streets in order to make way for Carnival. The street stands mostly specialize in items needed to enjoy the event. Chinelo dancers dominate the event, many in costumes which have been very expensive to assemble. Other events during Carnival here are processions, including the principal one in which there are representatives of all the communities of the municipality. The events last from Sunday to midnight Tuesday, signaling the beginning of <b>Ash</b> <b>Wednesday</b> and Lent. Each day, the Chinelos dance more energetically than the last.|$|E
25|$|Historians {{note that}} the Catholic {{carnival}} date was rescheduled six days earlier in 1091 in the Council of Benevent, because the Sundays {{were excluded from the}} 40-day fasting period before Easter, making <b>Ash</b> <b>Wednesday</b> the first day of Lent. From then until the 16th century, the two carnival dates existed. The first one, ending on <b>Ash</b> <b>Wednesday,</b> was known as the Herren- or Pfaffenfasnacht (lords' or priests' carnival) and was observed by those members of the higher echelons of society. The second, one week later at the old time, was known as the Bauernfasnacht (farmers' carnival). Afterwards, only this second carnival was celebrated in Basel.|$|E
25|$|Lent {{is a time}} of {{purification}} and penance {{that consists}} of the 40 days in each calendar year, excluding Sundays, that begin with <b>Ash</b> <b>Wednesday</b> and end with Holy Saturday, the day before Easter Sunday.|$|E
25|$|Ordinary Time, {{which runs}} from the Monday after the Sunday that follows 6 January to the Tuesday before <b>Ash</b> <b>Wednesday,</b> resumes on the Monday after Pentecost Sunday, and concludes before First Vespers of the First Sunday of Advent.|$|E
25|$|Along with Cyclone Tracy, <b>Ash</b> <b>Wednesday</b> {{is arguably}} the natural {{disaster}} {{to have had the}} greatest impact on the Australian national psyche. For the next quarter century, it was used as the measure for all bushfire emergencies in Australia, most notably the 2003 Canberra bushfires, which experienced very similar severe fire weather. The disaster caused 75 deaths, which is the second highest death toll for a bushfire in Australia. The 2009 Black Saturday bushfire disaster has since surpassed <b>Ash</b> <b>Wednesday</b> on the list of disasters in Australia by death toll, with 173 confirmed fatalities as of 30 March 2009—although the 1983 fires still remain the worst in Australian history in terms of property loss.|$|E
25|$|Lent, {{the forty}} days from <b>Ash</b> <b>Wednesday</b> to the Thursday of Holy Week up to but not {{including}} the evening Mass of the Lord's Supper. Holy Week itself begins with what is called Palm Sunday of the Passion of the Lord.|$|E
25|$|The lasting {{impact of}} <b>Ash</b> <b>Wednesday</b> was {{highlighted}} in 2008, when its 25th anniversary received much public and media attention. Commemoration sites {{have been set}} up in areas that were hit worst by the fires, with museums hosting exhibits inviting survivors to tell their stories.|$|E
25|$|Third-class ferias: ferias in Lent from Thursday after <b>Ash</b> <b>Wednesday</b> to Saturday {{before the}} Second Sunday of the Passion (Palm Sunday) except Ember Days (these outranked third-class feasts), and ferias in Advent up to 16 December except Ember Days (these were outranked by third-class feasts).|$|E
25|$|On March 8, 1962, Seaside Park was {{affected}} by a nor'easter that had churned offshore for two days. The storm, which destroyed a learge section of the borough's boardwalk, is variously {{referred to as the}} <b>Ash</b> <b>Wednesday</b> Storm, the Five High Storm and the Great March Storm of 1962.|$|E
25|$|Wednesday 16 February— <b>Ash</b> <b>Wednesday</b> on the Christian calendar—dawned {{as another}} unrelentingly hot, dry day. The weather early on <b>Ash</b> <b>Wednesday</b> was complex {{and did not}} signify how the day would develop. A front {{separated}} hot, dry air {{coming in from the}} interior to the north, from cooler air moving eastwards from the Southern Ocean. Ahead of the front were hot, turbulent, gale force northerly winds. Temperatures around Melbourne and Adelaide quickly rose above 43°C, with winds gusting up to 100km/h and relative humidity plunging to as low as 6 per cent. From mid-morning, McArthur's fire danger index was in excess of 100 in several places in Victoria and South Australia. It {{would be one of the}} worst fire weather days in south-east Australia since the disastrous Black Friday bushfires in 1939.|$|E
25|$|Promptly at {{the stroke}} of midnight {{at the end of}} Fat Tuesday, a mounted squad of New Orleans police {{officers}} make a show of clearing upper Bourbon Street where the bulk of out-of-town revelers congregate, announcing that Carnival is over, as it is the start of Lent, commencing with <b>Ash</b> <b>Wednesday.</b>|$|E
25|$|After the Conquest, the Spanish {{destroyed}} the temples and shrines here and build Christian churches and shrines {{on top of}} them. The churches located on this hill {{are a result of}} that tradition. The first Franciscan evangelist here, Martin de Valencia had the pagan idol replaced with an image of a Black Christ within the cave in the 1540s. Since 1584, this image has been the object of much veneration in this area, especially during the week of <b>Ash</b> <b>Wednesday,</b> which is the closest Christian celebration to the old one for Tezcatlipoca. Hence the worship of this figure is a syncretism which can be best seen during the week of <b>Ash</b> <b>Wednesday</b> when many clad in Aztec dress dance and perform ancient rituals in front of the parish church below and the sanctuary church on the hill.|$|E
25|$|In the Ambrosian Rite, ashes {{are blessed}} {{and placed on}} {{the heads of the}} {{faithful}} not on the day that elsewhere is called <b>Ash</b> <b>Wednesday,</b> {{but at the end of}} Mass on the following Sunday, which in that rite inaugurates Lent, with the fast traditionally beginning on Monday, the first weekday of the Ambrosian Lent.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the worst}} bushfires in eastern Australia, such as the 1983 <b>Ash</b> <b>Wednesday</b> fires, {{accompany}} El Niño-Southern Oscillation events which tend to cause a warm, dry and windy climate. The worst bushfires in Australian history occurred on Black Saturday in February 2009. The human death toll of the disaster was 173, and over 2000 homes were lost.|$|E
