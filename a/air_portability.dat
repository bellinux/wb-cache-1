40|$|Ion Mobility Spectrometry (IMS) is a {{well known}} {{technique}} {{for the detection of}} trace gases in ambient <b>air.</b> <b>Portability</b> due to its small size, high sensitivity in the ppbv range combined with fast response times of a few seconds make IMS devices the preferred detectors for hazardous substances. These range from drugs and explosives over pollutants in e. g. industrial plants to chemical warfare agents. The analytes are ionized by positve and negative reactant ions which have been produced in ambient air with help of free electrons. Certain analytes are then present as positive ions, others as negative ions, depending on their chemical properties. While pollutants forming positive ions in the device have been intensitvely investigated in the last 20 years, the investigation for pollutant ions detected in the negative mode has concentrated mainly on the detection of explosives. This paper describes the characteristics of analytes in the negative mode of an IMS device when detected with a novel pulsed ion mobility spectrometer...|$|E
