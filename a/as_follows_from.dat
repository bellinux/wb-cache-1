5|$|An empty matrix is {{a matrix}} {{in which the}} number of rows or columns (or both) is zero. Empty {{matrices}} help dealing with maps involving the zero vector space. For example, if A is a 3-by-0 matrix and B is a 0-by-3 matrix, then AB is the 3-by-3 zero matrix corresponding to the null map from a 3-dimensional space V to itself, while BA is a 0-by-0 matrix. There is no common notation for empty matrices, but most computer algebra systems allow creating and computing with them. The determinant of the 0-by-0 matrix is 1 <b>as</b> <b>follows</b> <b>from</b> regarding the empty product occurring in the Leibniz formula for the determinant as 1. This value {{is also consistent with}} the fact that the identity map from any finite dimensional space to itself has determinant1, a fact that is often used as a part of the characterization of determinants.|$|E

However the interior of a Casson handle is diffeomorphic to R4; Casson handles differ from standard 2 handles only in the way the boundary is attached to the interior.|$|E

25|$|Several {{studies have}} {{examined}} whether certain types of alcohol cause worse hangovers. All four studies concluded that darker liquors, which have higher congeners, produced worse hangovers. One even showed that hangovers were worse and more frequent with darker liquors. In a 2006 study, an average of 14 standard drinks (330 ml each) of beer was needed to produce a hangover, but only 7 to 8 drinks was required for wine or liquor (note that one standard drink has {{the same amount of}} alcohol regardless of type). Another study ranked several drinks by their ability to cause a hangover <b>as</b> <b>follows</b> (<b>from</b> low to high): distilled ethanol diluted with fruit juice, beer, vodka, gin, white wine, whisky, rum, red wine and brandy.|$|E
25|$|During Court sessions, {{the justices}} sit {{according}} to seniority, with the Chief Justice in the center, and the Associate Justices on alternating sides, {{with the most}} senior Associate Justice on the Chief Justice's immediate right, and the most junior Associate Justice seated on the left farthest away from the Chief Justice. Therefore, the current court sits <b>as</b> <b>follows</b> <b>from</b> left to right, {{from the perspective of}} those facing the Court: Kagan, Alito, Ginsburg, Kennedy (most senior Associate Justice), Roberts (Chief Justice), Thomas, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Gorsuch. In the official yearly Court photograph, justices are arranged similarly, with the five most senior members sitting in the front row in the same order as they would sit during Court sessions (The most recent photograph includes Ginsburg, Kennedy, Roberts, Thomas, Breyer), and the four most junior justices standing behind them, again in the same order as they would sit during Court sessions (Kagan, Alito, Sotomayor, Gorsuch).|$|E
25|$|Education at Râmnic evolved <b>as</b> <b>follows</b> <b>from</b> the 16th to {{the early}} 19th century. During the 16th century, there was a bishop's school for cantors, with musical texts in Old Church Slavonic. It also trained copyists, grammarians and logothetes, who learned {{to read and write}} in the Romanian Cyrillic alphabet. In the 17th century, the bishop's school taught reading and writing in Slavonic; arithmetic, {{geometry}} and the basics of chronology and administration; and church music in Slavonic. In the 18th century, there was a Romanian school founded by Bishop Anthim (1705-1708). This was free, training priests, cantors and grammarians from the diocese and from Transylvania. After a break, it resumed in 1719, following the start of Austrian occupation over the region, under Bishop Damaschin (1708-1725). In 1726, a textbook of his, including prayers, liturgical texts and church music, was printed posthumously, followed in 1749 under Bishop Grigorie Socoteanu by a spelling book. The latter's well-developed structure was emulated in later editions at Iași, Vienna, Blaj, Sibiu, Buda and Cernăuți. From 1741 to 1755, there was a Slavonic school, established to counter Greek influence in the church. This was absorbed into the Romanian and Greek school, begun in 1746. Several of this school's graduates, such as Naum Râmniceanu, were authors during the premodern period of Romanian literature. Finally, during the 19th century (1800-1831), there was a Romanian school characterized by a certain amount of variation in curriculum and teachers' pay, unsurprising given the transitions of the period.|$|E

2500|$|This {{calculation}} {{suggests that}} the Cantor set cannot contain any interval of non-zero length. It may seem surprising {{that there should be}} anything leftafter all, the sum of the lengths of the removed intervals is equal to the length of the original interval. However, {{a closer look at the}} process reveals that there must be something left, since removing the [...] "middle third" [...] of each interval involved removing open sets (sets that do not include their endpoints). So removing the line segment (1/3,2/3) from the original interval [...] leaves behind the points 1/3 [...] and 2/3. Subsequent steps do not remove these (or other) endpoints, since the intervals removed are always internal to the intervals remaining. [...] So the Cantor set is not empty, and in fact contains an uncountably infinite number of points (<b>as</b> <b>follows</b> <b>from</b> the above description in terms of paths in an infinite binary tree).|$|E

2500|$|Ionization of charged {{groups has}} been {{neglected}} in continuum electrostatic models of implicit solvation, {{as well as}} in standard molecular mechanics and molecular dynamics. [...] The transfer of an ion from water to a nonpolar medium with dielectric constant of ~3 (lipid bilayer) or 4 to 10 (interior of proteins) costs significant energy, <b>as</b> <b>follows</b> <b>from</b> the Born equation and from experiments. [...] However, since the charged protein residues are ionizable, they simply lose their charges in the nonpolar environment, which costs relatively little at the neutral pH: ~4 to 7 kcal/mol for Asp, Glu, Lys, and Arg amino acid residues, according to the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, ΔG = 2.3RT (pH - pK). [...] The low energetic costs of such ionization effects have indeed been observed for protein mutants with buried ionizable residues. and hydrophobic α-helical peptides in membranes with a single ionizable residue in the middle. However, all electrostatic methods, such as PB, GB, or GBSA assume that ionizable groups remain charged in the nonpolar environments, which leads to grossly overestimated electrostatic energy. [...] In the simplest accessible surface area-based models, this problem was treated using different solvation parameters for charged atoms or Henderson-Hasselbalch equation with some modifications. [...] However even the latter approach does not solve the problem. [...] Charged residues can remain charged even in the nonpolar environment if they are involved in intramolecular ion pairs and H-bonds. [...] Thus, the energetic penalties can be overestimated even using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. [...] More rigorous theoretical methods describing such ionization effects have been developed, and there are ongoing efforts to incorporate such methods into the implicit solvation models.|$|E
