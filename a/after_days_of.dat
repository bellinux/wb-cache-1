5|$|On 8 May, <b>after</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> heavy aerial bombardment, {{the final}} German {{offensive}} in the Kerch Peninsula, Operation Bustard Hunt, began. The 44th Army quickly collapsed, and the 51st Army {{was forced to}} fight off frontal attacks while also defending its open left flank. The 390th, in reserve, was sent into battle at Arma-Eli, and its 789th Regiment delayed the German advance, gaining time {{for the rest of}} the division to set up a defensive line in preparation for a counterattack. However, Lvov and his command staff were killed in an airstrike on the army headquarters, and no counterattack took place. Furthermore, on 13 May, division commander Babayan was wounded and evacuated, further diminishing the army leadership. By 14 May the German advance reached the shores of Kerch Bay, cutting off the troops retreating towards Eltigen and Kamysh-Burun. At this point, the 789th Regiment, now commanded by its commissar, S. Sargsyan, launched a counterattack, throwing the German troops back on the slopes of Mount Mithridat. For three days the regiment, suffering heavy casualties, held its positions and delayed the German advance. However, German troops advanced into Kerch from the southwest and the situation became hopeless. Upon orders from the Crimean Front command, from 14 to 20 May, the 51st Army covered the evacuation of the troops. The remnants of the division were among those evacuated across the Kerch Strait, but the fighting left the division nearly destroyed. It was officially disbanded on 14 June 1942, along with other divisions destroyed in Crimea, and its survivors were used to provide the experienced core of new formations.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND Chlorantraniliprole {{belongs to}} the {{chemical}} group of anthranilic diamides. It has selectivity to beneficial arthropods and low mammalian toxicity. Laboratory bioassays were conducted to assess chlorantraniliprole as a potential grain protectant against Ephestia kuehniella Zeller larvae, Liposcelis bostrychophila Badonnel adults, Rhyzopertha dominica (F.) adults, Sitophilus oryzae (L.) adults and Tribolium confusum Jacquelin du Val adults and larvae. Factors such as dose (0. 01, 0. 1, 1 and 10 mg chlorantraniliprole kg(- 1) grain), exposure interval (7 and 14 days), formulation (chlorantraniliprole WG and chlorantraniliprole SC) and commodity (barley, maize, oats, peeled rice, whole rice and wheat) were evaluated for {{their impact on the}} insecticidal activity of chlorantraniliprole. Progeny production was assessed <b>after</b> 45 <b>days</b> <b>of</b> exposure in the case of L. bostrychophila adults and <b>after</b> 60 <b>days</b> <b>of</b> exposure in the case of R. dominica, S. oryzae and T. confusum adults. RESULTS For L. bostrychophila adults, <b>after</b> 7 <b>days</b> <b>of</b> exposure, mortality was lower in maize and whole rice in comparison with the other commodities. Increase in dose generally increased mortality. Similar trends were also noted <b>after</b> 14 <b>days</b> <b>of</b> exposure. Offspring emergence was higher in maize and whole rice in comparison with the other commodities. For E. kuehniella larvae, <b>after</b> 7 <b>days</b> <b>of</b> exposure, significant differences were noted among the tested commodities. Increase in dose only slightly increased mortality in all commodities. <b>After</b> 14 <b>days</b> <b>of</b> exposure, mortality was further increased, but did not reach 100 %. For R. dominica adults, <b>after</b> 7 <b>days</b> <b>of</b> exposure, increase in dose increased mortality significantly. <b>After</b> 14 <b>days</b> <b>of</b> exposure, mortality in barley, maize, whole rice and wheat exceeded 92 % at 10 mg chlorantraniliprole kg(- 1) grain. Offspring emergence was reduced, but 100 % progeny suppression was not achieved. For S. oryzae adults, <b>after</b> 7 <b>days</b> <b>of</b> exposure, mortality was generally low at dose rates of 1 mg chlorantraniliprole kg(- 1) grain. <b>After</b> 14 <b>days</b> <b>of</b> exposure, 100 % mortality was noted in whole rice. For T. confusum adults, <b>after</b> 7 <b>days</b> <b>of</b> exposure, mortality was low. <b>After</b> 14 <b>days</b> <b>of</b> exposure, mortality increased proportionately for all commodities. Most progeny production was noted in oats. For T. confusum larvae, <b>after</b> 7 <b>days</b> <b>of</b> exposure, mortality was generally higher in comparison with adults. <b>After</b> 14 <b>days</b> <b>of</b> exposure, mortality in maize was high. Generally, the two formulations performed alike for all the insects tested. CONCLUSIONS Based on {{the results of the present}} work, chlorantraniliprole is effective against major stored-product insect species. However, efficacy depends upon the type of commodity, the dose rate and the exposure interval. (c) 2013 Society of Chemical Industr...|$|R
