25|$|The {{island of}} Sumatra is renowned as <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> pepper, and {{throughout}} history ships {{have come to}} the island to trade for it. In 1831, the American merchantman Friendship under Captain Charles Endicott had arrived off the chiefdom of Kuala Batu in order to secure a cargo of pepper. Various small trading boats darted back and forth along the coast trading pepper with the merchant ships waiting offshore. On 7 February 1831, Endicott and a few of his men went ashore to purchase some pepper from the natives when three proas attacked his ship, murdered Friendships first officer and two others of her crew, and plundered its cargo.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} staple to {{the people}} who settled at Kintampo was the oil palm. The oil palm was used at Kintampo starting at least 4000 years ago. A very useful plant in many ways, it serves as a source of drink, food, and construction material. It was allowed to flourish in the region due to its preference for a constant warm climate and high rainfall. As a food, the oil can be extracted from the mesocarp which covers the plant, and the kernel which is also edible by itself. It is <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> vitamin A, which would have helped to support a growing population.|$|E
25|$|The {{withdrawal}} of the Bank of Spain's gold reserves to Moscow has been pointed {{out to be one}} of the main causes of the Spanish monetary crisis of 1937. While the gold became in practice <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> funding, its usage dealt a hard blow against the coined and printed currency of the country. Nationalist efforts to expose the exportation of the gold put the government's financial credibility in question, and caused general mistrust among the public. A decree issued by the Ministry of Finance on October 3, 1936, obliging Spaniards to yield all the gold they possessed, caused widespread alarm. Even though the government denied in January 1937 that it had deposited the gold reserves abroad (vide supra), it was forced to acknowledge that it had made various payments with such gold.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{content and}} {{composition}} of fatty acids in the seed oil from 4 blackberry varieties were compared in this paper to provide further guidelines for use of blackberry seeds. Blackberry seed oil contains rich α-linolenic and linoleic acid making it <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> dietary <b>source</b> <b>of</b> 18 : 3 n- 3 and essential fatty acids. The oil is a good dietary <b>source</b> <b>of</b> natural antioxidants for health promotion and disease prevention.

40|$|Manure or compost from {{beef cattle}} feedlots can be <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> {{nutrients}} and organic matter when added to soils, {{but they can}} also pollute runoff. We determined the effects of simulated rainfall on runoff losses of P and N, and EC and pH following application of manure and compost to a Sharpsburg silty clay loam (fine smectitic, mesic Typic Argiudoll) soil having grain sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] and winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) residues. Manure, compost, and fertilizer were applied to no-till fields at rates required to meet N or P requirements for corn (Zea mays L.) production and were either left on the soil surface or disked to 8 cm. There were also untreated checks. Runoff concentrations of dissolved P (DP), bioavailable P (BAP), and NH 4 —N were significantly greater when the soil was not disked. Total and particulate P concentrations in runoff were generally less under wheat than sorghum residue and were less for the no-till than the disked condition. In the disked system, N or P-based manure or compost application resulted in DP concentration 3 ̆c 1 mg L- 1. Manure and compost application resulted in greater runoff EC values than fertilizer application. Phosphorus concentration of runoff receiving P fertilizer or N-based manure and compost application can be an environmental concern when these sources are applied under no-till conditions without incorporation...|$|R

40|$|Studies on extremophiles, {{microorganisms}} able {{to survive}} in extreme environments, are very helpful for the comprehension of life evolution; in fact they are the unique organisms of the Earth at the origin of life. They lie into the three domains of life (Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya) {{and can be found}} in environmental niches on Earth such as in hydrothermal vents and springs, in salty lakes, in halite crystals, in polar ice and lakes, in volcanic areas, in deserts, or under anaerobic conditions. The existence of life forms beyond the Earth requires an extension of the classical limits of life: the resistance of extremophilic organisms to harsh conditions in terms of temperature, salinity, pH, pressure, dryness, and desiccation makes these living organisms good putative candidates to assess the habitability of other planets. The ability to survive and proliferate in extreme conditions (pH, temperature, pressure, salt, and nutrients) produces a variety of biotechnologically useful molecules such as lipids, enzymes, polysaccharides, and compatible solutes that are employed in several industrial processes. There are many extremophilic enzymes and also endogenous compounds that are used with success for food industry, for preparation of the detergents, for pharmacological applications, and also for genetic studies. In particular enzymes that derive from thermophiles, and for this reason called thermozymes, represent <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> new catalysts of interest in industrial sectors...|$|R

40|$|Common {{buckwheat}} (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench) is {{well known}} as <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> dietary <b>source</b> <b>of</b> proteins, minerals salts, dietary fibre and flavanoids (Ikeda, 2000).

These flavanoids were found to be effective in reducing blood cholesterol levels, keeping capillaries and arteries strong and flexible (Griffith et al, 1994).

40|$|Plasma jets {{have been}} proven to be <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>source</b> because <b>of</b> their several novel applications.

This paper presents the plasma dynamics and its properties obtained by time-resolved imaging and results of emission spectra in both feed gases. Addition of water vapor results in a decrease of the jet plume length and an increase of OH radical intensity in emission spectra. Therefore, DBD plasma jet is an efﬁcient source for OH radical production, where yield of radicals and plume length can be controlled by variation of water-vapor content in feed ga...|$|R
40|$|Antarctic krill Euphausia superba is <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> {{potential}} <b>source</b> <b>of</b> food protein.

The krill powder performed better preference, and was added to ramen sauce, which itself performed better than a commercial shrimp flavored sauce. In total, 47 and 39 volatile compounds were identified from krill con-centrate and powder, respectively. Both products contained many aldehydes and sulfur-containing compounds. The whisky flavor of aldehydes lowered the shrimp flavor of the krill concentrate. Sulfur-containing compounds were found in krill powder, confirm-ing the results from sensory evaluation...|$|R

Literary publishers in Canada face many challenges, none of which is more prominent than the struggle for financial survival. In order to survive, publishers of poetry and fiction must look at every potential sales avenue. One possible market that literary publishers may consider is the academic sector-that is, marketing to college and university instructors. By letting literature professors know about its activities and new books, publishers may successfully gain course adoptions for poetry and fiction titles that have limited sales potential in the trade market.
