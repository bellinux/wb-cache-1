In the case of Turkey, the long-term estimations of the price elasticities of exports <b>and</b> <b>imports,</b> <b>and</b> the respective cross elasticities, lead us to conclude that currency devaluation would, in the long run, improve the balance of trade.

5|$|The Main Cell Block {{was built}} in two stages. Construction of the {{southern}} half of the block began in 1853 {{and most of the}} masonry works were finished within a year.

However, iron fittings for the guardrails, which had been ordered from England three years previously, still had not arrived. Anxious for the new cell block to start being used, Henderson ordered that doors and rails be made locally, with iron salvaged from convict transport ships. The obvious transition between the local <b>and</b> <b>imported</b> railing now marks the boundary between the southern and northern wings.

Coins minted across the Roman empire were also found. The finds on the site indicate occupation from the late-1st or early-2nd centuries to the late-4th or early-5th centuries.

However, the only herd that became established outside France during this period was in New Caledonia, which continued to import Limousins. It was not until after the reform of Limousin breeding in France in 1962 that significant numbers were exported around the world. Limousins were reintroduced in Argentina (1966) and Brazil (1978), <b>and</b> <b>imported</b> to other European countries such as Spain (1965), Italy (1968), the Netherlands (1969), Denmark (1970), and the United Kingdom (1971). Their introduction to the United Kingdom provided opportunities for Australia and New Zealand to import semen in 1972. Soon after, New Zealand allowed the importation of Limousins from both Ireland and the United Kingdom, and the first Full French cattle were imported to Australia from New Zealand in 1975.|$|E
