5|$|Locus 011 and Locus 057 {{may have}} been watchposts, they were {{situated}} at the points where the Quiriguá and the Jubuco rivers entered the Motagua Valley <b>and</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> used to control passing traffic on these routes. Locus057 was situated {{on one of the}} most probable routes to Copán <b>and</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a watchpost to look out for enemy warriors after the defeat of Copán by K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat.|$|E

5|$|As {{the name}} suggests, an {{elliptical}} galaxy has the cross-sectional {{shape of an}} ellipse. The stars move along random orbits with no preferred direction. These galaxies contain little or no interstellar dust, few star-forming regions, and generally older stars. Elliptical galaxies are more commonly found {{at the core of}} galactic clusters, <b>and</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> formed through mergers of large galaxies.|$|E
5|$|Clegg Hall is a 17th century {{hall and}} Grade II* listed {{building}} situated in green space between Milnrow, Rochdale and Littleborough. It {{was constructed in}} about 1610 for Theophilus Aston <b>and</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> built {{on the site of}} a mediaeval house and inn.|$|E
5|$|In stone carving {{there are}} a number of simple stone heads from Scotland, like that found at Coupar Angus in Perthshire, that may date from the Iron Age.

5|$|Lake {{initially}} sought Earp out {{hoping to}} write a magazine article about him. Earp was also seeking a biographer {{at about the same}} time. Earp, who was 80, was concerned that his vantage point on the Tombstone story may be lost, <b>and</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> financially motivated, as he had little income in his last years of life.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about Macbeth's early life, {{although}} {{he was the son}} of Findláech of Moray <b>and</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a grandson of Malcolm II. He became Mormaer of Moray – a semi-autonomous lordship – in 1032, and was probably responsible for the death of the previous mormaer, Gille Coemgáin. He subsequently married Gille Coemgáin's widow, Gruoch, although they had no children together.|$|E

5|$|Over 400 souterrains {{have been}} {{discovered}} in Scotland, {{many of them in}} the south-east, and although few have been dated those that have suggest a construction date in the 2nd or 3rd centuries. Unfortunately the purpose of these small underground structures is also obscure. They are usually found close to settlements (whose timber frames are much less well-preserved) <b>and</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> for storing perishable agricultural products.|$|E
5|$|The Bruton Dovecote is a {{limestone}} tower {{that was}} built between the 15th and 17th century in Bruton in the English county of Somerset.

5|$|The {{ancestors}} of the Otarioidea and Phocoidea diverged 33mya. The Phocidae {{are likely to have}} descended from the extinct family Desmatophocidae in the North Atlantic. Desmatophocids lived 23–10 mya and had elongated skulls, fairly large eyes, cheekbones connected by a mortised structure and rounded cheek teeth. They also were sexually dimorphic <b>and</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> capable of propelling themselves with both the foreflippers and hindflippers.|$|E
5|$|The inquiry {{also found}} that while Perizzolo died almost instantly, Aylwin may have survived for up to 39 hours after the collapse, <b>and</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> found alive if HUSAR had not {{suspended}} its rescue operations.|$|E
5|$|The layout {{was unique}} {{within the city}} of Napa, <b>and</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> unique within California.

Many of the buildings shared walls or were built abutting each other, {{and two of the}} houses were built over a single basement.|$|E

5|$|The {{specimen}} {{had serious}} puncture wounds {{on the front}} of the skull, indicating that it had been preyed upon by a large carnivore. One puncture wound was on the right side of the braincase <b>and</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the fatal blow. There was also a bite mark on the frontal trigon.|$|E
5|$|After {{defeating}} Maxentius in 312, Constantine disbanded the Praetorian Guard, {{ending the}} latter's 300-year existence. Although the instant reason was the Guard's {{support for his}} rival Maxentius, a force based in Rome had also become obsolete since emperors now rarely resided there. The imperial escort role of the Guard's cavalry, the equites singulares Augusti, was now fulfilled by the scholae. These elite cavalry regiments existed {{by the time of}} Constantine <b>and</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> founded by Diocletian.|$|E
