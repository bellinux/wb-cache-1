25|$|Finally, {{rather than}} {{treating}} the essay as an honest {{analysis of a}} painful, complex issue, critics accused the AJC of stifling the debate. Such hysteria makes intellectuals look spoiled, thin-skinned and brittle. Best-selling authors like Noam Chomsky or billionaires like George Soros ritualistically applaud their own bravery and pretend they are lonely voices when joining the trendy intellectual pile-on against Israel. How it {{is that people who}} viciously criticize Israel and Zionism, who lecture the Jewish world about tolerating diverse opinions, suddenly cannot stomach vigorous debate when they are criticized? Nothing in the AJC essay advocates hate laws, suppressing free speech, shunning, or any other intimidation. Professor Rosenfeld did what thinkers <b>are</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> – identify, catalogue, analyze, explain, and challenge.|$|E
500|$|The {{gameplay}} was highlighted for {{the size}} of the game's worlds. Jes Bickham of GamesRadar described Banjo-Tooie as a game that requires a massive time-investment on the player's part, saying that [...] "Keeping track of what you can do next, or where you can re-visit to get something new, requires either a photographic memory or copious note-taking". Similarly, GamePro remarked that the game is so large that players might lose their way and forget what they <b>are</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> GameSpot's Shane Satterfield praised the game's level design and progression for constantly requiring players to collect Jiggies. Despite the praise, Edge concluded that Rare should have innovated more instead of simply copying the formula of Super Mario 64. At the 2000 GameSpot Game of the Year awards, Banjo-Tooie was awarded Best Platform Game.|$|E

[...] He also broadly praised the acting, styling and cinematography, writing: [...] "The film bears a magnificent look all through and the panoramic and exotic locales of America only make every frame stand out." [...] Daily News and Analysis gave it a rating of 3.5 out of 5, saying that it stood apart from [...] "other done-to-death rom-coms in Hindi cinema in the sheer exclusivity of its screenplay {{and the way the}} subject is developed ... Here, at last, is a romantic comedy from Bollywood that actually does what rom-coms <b>are</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Anjaana Anjaani tugs at your heartstrings {{while at the same time}} tickling your funny bone."

6000|$|Letter VI.--"Hallowed be Thy name." [...] How do we fulfil {{the hope}} in our lives? How do we betray it? Not in {{swearing}} only, {{as we are}} apt to think, but in the blasphemy of false and hypocritical prayer to, and praise of, preaching about God (last paragraph of the Letter). Clergymen, it is added, can prevent openly wicked men from being in their congregations (they <b>are</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so: Rubrics 2 and 3 before the Holy Communion Service); they can not only compel the wicked poor into, but expel the wicked rich out of, churches. God sees the heart: the clergy should look to the hands and lips.|$|E
6000|$|Then I {{abandoned}} {{hope and}} prepared to die. The process proved not altogether unpleasant. I did not see visions from my past life as drowning men <b>are</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> but--and this shows how strong was her empire over me--my mind flew back to Ayesha. I seemed to behold her and a man at her side, standing over me in some dark, rocky gulf. She was wrapped in a long travelling cloak, and her lovely eyes were wild with fear. I rose to salute her, and make report, but she cried in a fierce, concentrated voice--"What evil thing has happened here? Thou livest; then where is my lord Leo? Speak, man, and say where thou hast hid my lord--or die." ...|$|E

So it is; but I am made like that; I take things as they come, and somehow there is always some new thing to follow the last. In the second place, I should never propose to settle. I can't settle, my dear uncle; I 'm not a settler. I know that is what strangers <b>are</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> here; they always settle.

60|$|We buried poor Nombe decently in her {{own little}} hut where she used to {{practise}} her incantations. Zikali and his people wished apparently to throw her to the vultures for some secret reason {{that had to do}} with their superstitions. But Heda, who, now that Nombe was dead, developed a great affection for her not unmixed with a certain amount of compunction for which really she had no cause, withstood him to his face and insisted upon a decent interment. So she was laid to earth still plastered with the white pigment and wrapped in the bloodstained feather robe. I may add that on the following morning one of Zikali's servants informed me solemnly that because of this she had been seen during the night riding up and down the rocks on a baboon as Zulu umtagati <b>are</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> I have small doubt that as soon as we were gone they dug her up again and threw her to the vultures and the jackals according to their first intention.|$|E

Next I meet an unhappy slipshod gentleman with a cloak flung hastily over his shoulders, running a race with boisterous winds and striving to glide between the drops of rain. Some domestic emergency or other has blown this miserable man from his warm fireside in quest of a doctor. See that little vagabond!

6000|$|From hence I tread upon firm {{pavements}} {{into the}} centre of the town. Here there is almost as brilliant an illumination as when some great victory has been won, either on the battle-field or at the polls. Two rows of shops, with windows down nearly to the ground, cast a glow from side to side, while the black night hangs overhead like a canopy, and thus keeps the splendor from diffusing itself away. The wet sidewalks gleam with a broad sheet of red light. The rain-drops glitter, as if the sky were pouring down rubies. The spouts gush with fire. Methinks the scene is an emblem of the deceptive glare, which mortals throw around their footsteps in the moral world, thus bedazzling themselves, till they forget the impenetrable obscurity that hems them in, and that can be dispelled only by radiance from above. And after all, it is a cheerless scene, and cheerless are the wanderers in it.
