5|$|In 1922, Raymond {{had been}} {{admitted}} to Tokyo Golf Club and when it relocated to Asaka, Saitama in 1932, {{he was asked to}} design it. His links to golfer Shiro Akaboshi <b>also</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> several residential commissions.|$|E
5|$|In Sydney, fear of an {{impending}} Japanese invasion caused {{people to move}} west; housing prices in the Eastern Suburbs dropped, while those beyond the Blue Mountains rose significantly. The attack <b>also</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> {{a significant increase in}} the membership of volunteer defence organisations, and strengthening of defences in Sydney Harbour and Port Newcastle.|$|E
5|$|Increasing {{traffic levels}} across the Firth of Forth had <b>also</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> the {{construction}} of the Clackmannanshire Bridge adjacent to the existing Kincardine Bridge. This bridge opened in November 2008.|$|E

5|$|The Gomez {{incident}} <b>also</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> {{a review}} and proposal by the Federal Government in August 1993 to disband the Johor Military Force (JMF). However, {{the bill to}} disband the JMF was subsequently repealed by parliament.|$|E
5|$|The September 11 attacks <b>also</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> the U.S. wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, {{as well as}} {{additional}} homeland security spending, totaling at least $5 trillion.|$|E

5|$|A {{technique}} was developed that combined the front projection effect with specially designed zoom lenses. The illusion of movement {{was created by}} zooming in on Reeve while making the front projected image appear to recede. For scenes where Superman interacts with other people or objects while in flight, Reeve and actors were put {{in a variety of}} rigging equipment with careful lighting and photography. This <b>also</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> the creation of the Zoptic system.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{earliest}} historical records of Copenhagen {{are from the}} end of the 12th century, recent archaeological finds in connection with work on the city's metropolitan rail system revealed the remains of a large merchant's mansion near today's Kongens Nytorv from c. 1020. Excavations in Pilestræde have <b>also</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> the discovery of a well from the late 12th century. The remains of an ancient church, with graves dating to the 11th century, have been unearthed near where Strøget meets Rådhuspladsen.|$|E
5|$|Among these, the Morana and Unapana clans claimed {{superior}} {{status to}} Namudana, Ambilo and Ura clans. Seligman reported that Morana and Unapana clans considered {{the other three}} as their servile groups, a classification strongly denied by the others. This <b>also</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> so-called servile groups denying such clan association when questioned and claiming Morana or Unapana clan origins.|$|E
5|$|Aposematism has <b>also</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> the {{development}} of mimicry complexes of Batesian mimicry, where edible species mimic aposematic taxa, and Müllerian mimicry, where inedible species, often of related taxa, have evolved to resemble each other, so as to benefit from reduced sampling rates by predators during learning. Similarly, adult Sesiidae species (also known as clearwing moths) have a general appearance that is sufficiently similar to a wasp or hornet to make it likely that the moths gain a reduction in predation by Batesian mimicry.|$|E

5|$|Competition with {{fishermen}} <b>also</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> {{killer whales}} being regarded as pests. In {{the waters of}} the Pacific Northwest and Iceland, the shooting of killer whales was accepted and even encouraged by governments. As an indication of the intensity of shooting that occurred until fairly recently, about 25% of the killer whales captured in Puget Sound for aquarium through 1970 bore bullet scars. The U.S. Navy claimed to have deliberately killed hundreds of killer whales in Icelandic waters in 1956 with machine-guns, rockets, and depth charges.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the initial}} {{suspicion}} of foul play, the death was ruled an accident; {{a case of}} starvation and exposure as Barker was unable to escape the closet. Investigators concluded that Barker died on February 28, three days after her disappearance. As a result, the mayor ordered closet doors to open more easily. The press surrounding the Barker case <b>also</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> the first calls about the Boy in the Box.|$|E
5|$|Devadasu was {{released}} on 26June 1953, and the Tamil version {{was released}} three months later, on 11September 1953. Both versions were critically and commercially successful.
