40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} the post-contracting behavior of selected regional offices. It consists of making <b>amendments</b> <b>to</b> <b>contract</b> agreements between public submitters and suppliers. The Analysis uses the Inductive research approach, {{which is based on}} gathering data about the completed public <b>contracts</b> with focus <b>to</b> reveal negative impacts of the amendments. The analysis showed that the negative impacts on the final prices of public contracts were only marginal. Nevertheless the real problem with post-contracting behavior might be the lack of transparency regarding providing or releasing information...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to analyse the post-contractual {{behaviour}} in the procurement system, which I investigated {{in a sample of}} contracting authorities at the level of local counties government as well as central government in the Czech Republic. This is the third and {{the last part of the}} tender process, which begins with the closing of the contract with the winner of a public tender. Basically, the post-contractual phase involves additional changes in contracts that can significantly change the character of the original agreement and subsequently the tendered price. The theoretical part of this thesis describes the procurement cycle based on effective legislation. The main part of this work deals with the collection and analysis of data regarding differences between the tendered and the final price, <b>amendments</b> <b>to</b> <b>contracts</b> and penalties applied. Analysis of the data was carried out based on descriptive statistics and graphical analysis. The result is the fact that the central government and local counties government behave very similarly after the contract. Very important factor in their behaviour is a type of performance and the number of candidates competing for the contract...|$|R
