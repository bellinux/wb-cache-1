The rebel forces captured the outer defenses of the city unopposed, as no federal officer was willing to countermand the orders to hold fire. Instead, the troops withdrew deeper into the city.|$|E
5|$|For his part, Minh resented that he {{had been}} deposed by a younger officer whom he viewed as an unscrupulous upstart. Minh was also upset with the {{detention}} of his fellow generals and around 30 of his junior officers. The latter group was set free when Minh made this a condition for his serving as the figurehead chief of state. Khánh attempted to avoid the issue of substantiating the alleged neutralist plot for <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> and then tried to revive it by claiming that French agents were attempting to assassinate him and to enforce neutralism. Khánh offered no evidence, only claiming that the French had paid a hitman US$1300 to kill him, before later inflating the supposed reward for his assassination. American intelligence officials in Vietnam privately said that they were not aware of any such threat.|$|E

5|$|In June 1919, {{soon after}} the passage of Education Act 1918, the school {{successfully}} applied for grant-earning status and became partly state-funded. As a consequence, it became necessary to introduce a composite governing board (including public representatives) and to offer free places, equal to 25 percent of the normal number of admissions. In 1925, the school saw its first students enter the Oxbridge universities and changed its name to simply The Judd School. Evans retired in 1928 and was replaced by Welshman Cecil Lloyd Morgan who beat 164other applicants to a job which carried an annual salary of £650. He oversaw a change in the curriculum such that each form was divided into two streams, of which one took Latin, the other more vocational subjects. Morgan continued as many of the Judd customs <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> including the tradition of donating £20 per year to send a Barnardo boy to Australia or Canada.|$|E
5|$|While {{the royal}} army {{was in the}} north, Edward {{received}} news from London that the Earl of Lincoln had died on 6 February 1311. This meant that a moderating influence on the baronial party had been lost, {{at the same time}} as the antagonistic Earl of Lancaster – who was Lincoln's son-in-law and heir – emerged as the leader of the Ordainers. With the Ordainers ready to present their programme of reform, Edward had to summon a parliament. In late July he appointed Gaveston Lieutenant of Scotland, and departed for London. Bruce still evaded the English successfully, in early August even staging a raid into northern England, and shortly after this Gaveston withdrew to Bamburgh Castle in Northumberland. When parliament met on 16 August, the King was presented with a set of proposed reforms of the royal household, as well as specific attacks on individuals, including a demand for the renewed exile of Piers Gaveston. Edward initially offered to agree to the reforms as long as Gaveston was allowed to stay, but the Ordainers refused. The King held out for <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> but eventually had to agree to the Ordinances, which were published on 27 September. On 3 November, two days after the allotted deadline, Gaveston left England for the last time.|$|E
25|$|Before Charles could regroup, orders {{arrived from}} the Aulic Council, the {{imperial}} body in Vienna charged with conduct of war, to countermand his plan; Charles' troops were to leave Zurich in the supposedly capable hands of Korsokov, re-cross the Rhine and march north to Mainz. Charles stalled this operation <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> but eventually he had to concede to Vienna's orders. Consequently, the Russian troops under a novice general replaced the Austrian troops and their seasoned commander. Charles withdrew his force {{to the north of}} the Rhine. Although the order to Charles to recross the Rhine and march north was eventually countermanded, by the time such instructions reached him, they were too late to reverse.|$|E

Minh was also upset with the detention of his colleagues and around 30 of his junior officers.

Khánh attempted to avoid the issue of substantiating the alleged plot <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> and then claimed that French agents were attempting to assassinate him and implement neutralism.

25|$|Initially, Grothendieck {{attended}} Henri Cartan's Seminar at École Normale Supérieure, but {{he lacked}} the necessary background to follow the high-powered seminar. On the advice of Cartan and André Weil, {{he moved to the}} University of Nancy where he wrote his dissertation under Laurent Schwartz and Jean Dieudonné on functional analysis, from 1950 to 1953. At this time he was a leading expert in the theory of topological vector spaces. By 1957, he set this subject aside in order to work in algebraic geometry and homological algebra. The same year he was invited to visit Harvard by Oscar Zariski, but the offer fell through when he refused to sign a pledge promising not to work to overthrow the United States government, a position that, he was warned, might have landed him in prison. The prospect did not worry him, <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have access to books.|$|E
25|$|As Guy was a vassal of Richard I, King of England for his {{lands in}} Poitou, Richard {{supported}} {{him in this}} political struggle, while Conrad was supported by his cousin Leopold V of Austria and cousin once-removed Philip II, King of France. Conrad acted as chief negotiator in the surrender of Acre, and raised the kings' banners in the city. Afterwards, the parties attempted {{to come to an}} agreement. Guy was confirmed as king of Jerusalem, and Conrad was made his heir. Conrad would retain the cities of Tyre, Beirut, and Sidon, and his heirs would inherit Jerusalem on Guy's death. In July 1191 Conrad's kinsman, King Philip, decided to return to France, but before he left he turned over half the treasure plundered from Acre to Conrad, along with all his prominent Muslim hostages. King Richard asked Conrad to hand over the hostages, but Conrad refused <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could.</b> After he finally relented (since Richard was now leader of the Crusade), Richard had all the hostages killed. Conrad did not join Richard on campaign to the south, preferring to remain with his wife Isabella in Tyre — believing his life to be in danger. It was probably around this time that Conrad's father died.|$|E

25|$|The prince regent {{played a}} desperate game with France for time. For <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> he pretended an {{apparent}} submission to France, {{to the point}} of suggesting to King George III of the United Kingdom the declaration of a fictitious state of war between their countries, but he did not obey the dictates of Napoleon's Continental System (a blockade against Great Britain). A new secret treaty with the British guaranteed him help in case of an eventual flight of the royal family. The accord greatly favored the British and preserved their influence over the country, as the United Kingdom continued to make vast profits in trade with the Portuguese intercontinental empire. It fell to Portugal only to choose between obedience to France or to England, and the hesitancy to decide firmly placed Portugal at risk of war with not merely one of these powers, but with both. In October 1807, news arrived that a French army was approaching, and on 16 November, a British squadron arrived in the port of Lisbon with a force of seven thousand men with orders either to escort the royal family to Brazil or, if the government surrendered to France, to attack and conquer the Portuguese capital. The court was divided between Francophiles and Anglophiles, and after anguished consideration under pressure from both sides, John decided to accept British protection and leave for Brazil.|$|E
500|$|Cline, {{watching}} the clock nervously, attempted to call Connal back, {{only to find}} both lines busy. He waited <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> then made one final, unsuccessful attempt. Unknown to Cline, Connal was talking to Goodman, who had agreed to [...] "slide the network", that is, start Heidi as soon as Curt Gowdy signed off from the game. Connal called the game producer, Ellis, in Oakland, {{to tell him the}} news, then called the BOC supervisor in Burbank – who, not knowing Connal, refused his order, and insisted on speaking with Goodman directly. As Goodman had disconnected to allow Connal to call Oakland, this could not be done.|$|E
500|$|In August 1799, Archduke Charles {{received}} {{orders from}} his brother, the Emperor, {{to withdraw the}} Austrian army across the Rhine. [...] While Charles could see this to be unreasonable—Alexander Suvorov had not yet reached central Switzerland, and it was folly to think that Alexander Korsakov's force of 30,000 and Hotze's 20,000 could hold all of the region until {{the arrival of the}} rest of the Russian force—the order was emphatic. Charles delayed <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> but in late August he withdrew his force across the Rhine and headed toward Phillipsburg. When Suvorov heard of this breach of military common-sense, he wondered [...] "the owl [...] has either gone out of his mind, or he never had one." [...] The order was eventually reversed too late for the Archduke to stop his withdrawal.|$|E

500|$|This was Gazan's last field command. Gazan's pre-emptive {{withdrawal}} {{created a}} gap in French line, exposing D'Erlon's army in the center. D'Erlon held his position <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> but the line collapsed around him. Joseph's planned orderly withdrawal turned into a rout. Gazan abandoned all his artillery. The Allies captured the entire supply convoy, all the baggage and took many prisoners, including Gazan's wife and children, although they later managed to rejoin him. After losing their supply train, {{the plight of the}} French army was terrible. Gazan mentioned that general officers and subordinates alike [...] "were reduced to the clothes on their backs and most of them were barefoot," [...] but the rank and file of the army also suffered enormously from hunger, exposure, and disease. When Soult took command of the new Army of the Pyrenees, Gazan became his chief of staff until Napoleon's abdication.|$|E

Consequently, the Russian troops under a novice general replaced the Austrian troops and their seasoned commander in the strategically important city. Charles withdrew his force {{to the north of}} the Rhine and marched slowly toward Mainz. In Italy, the Russian generalissimo, Alexander Suvorov, was horrified when he heard this: [...] he depended upon a stable Austro-Russian presence in Switzerland to protect his flank and he expected to join this army by September or October at the latest. Although the order to Charles to recross the Rhine and march north was eventually countermanded, by the time such instructions reached him, he had gone too far to return to Zurich in time.|$|E
500|$|Holtz's {{first job}} at {{his alma mater}} was to serve as wide {{receivers}} coach, and he filled the position for two years. In 1992, the team began {{a search for a}} new offensive coordinator. Lou's first choice, Joe Moore, declined. Lou then asked Skip for recommendations to fill the position. Skip initially said he wanted the position but said of Lou, [...] "he couldn't do it at that time with me [...] being his son." [...] Skip then mentioned Mark Richt, who was then the offensive coordinator at Florida State. Lou Holtz called Coach Bowden to ask permission to speak to Mark Richt. Coach Bowden said Holtz could hire Richt <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> hire Skip. Coach Holtz said, [...] "Well, if I'm just going to switch coaches, I might as well hire Skip." [...] Skip became Notre Dame's offensive coordinator in 1992. Between 1992 and 1994, Skip and his father recorded 40 wins, eight losses, and one tie, an 82.7% winning percentage. Together, they coached Notre Dame to the Cotton Bowl Classic twice, beating Texas A both times. Skip had the third-best total offense in the NCAA during the 1992 football season.|$|E

500|$|By early 1972, Labor had {{established}} a clear lead in the polls; indeed, {{for the first time}} since 1955 its support was greater than the combined vote for the Coalition and DLP. Unemployment was at a ten-year peak, rising to 2.14percent in August (though the unemployment rate was calculated differently compared to the present, and did not include thousands of rural workers on Commonwealth-financed relief work). Inflation was also at its highest rate since the early 1950s. The government recovered slightly in the August Budget session of Parliament, proposing income tax cuts and increased spending. The Labor strategy for the run-up to the election was to sit back and allow the Coalition to make mistakes. Whitlam controversially stated in March that [...] "draft-dodging is not a crime" [...] and that he would be open to a revaluation of the Australian dollar. With the Coalition sinking in the polls and his own personal approval ratings down as low as 28 percent, McMahon waited <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> finally calling an election for the House of Representatives for 2 December.

500|$|The Appellants {{proceeded}} to prosecute those considered politically {{close to the}} King; this included Nicholas Brembre, and at the Merciless Parliament of 1388, he was condemned to death; Exton, having by now been re-elected Mayor (with, apparently, the King's support, or rege annuente) seems to have acquiesced in the proceedings against (and subsequent hanging of) his earlier ally. Although Exton had been a leading member {{in what has been}} called Brembre's [...] "Ricardian faction" [...] in London, and stayed with Brembre <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> (until March 1387), he deserted him decisively soon after that date. Exton was, it has been said, [...] "in a particularly difficult position." [...] Exton and other aldermen were questioned as to whether Brembre could be supposed to have realised that his actions were treasonous. To this, Exton is supposed to have replied that he [...] "supposed he [...] was aware rather than ignorant of them." [...] Bembre's fate was sealed by Exton and [...] "those that knew him best." [...] Exton had continued the tradition of loyalty to the crown demonstrated by his predecessor, but, significantly, [...] "within limits never acknowledged by the headstong Brembre." [...] As J. A.
