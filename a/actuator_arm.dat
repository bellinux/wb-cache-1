25|$|A {{hard disk}} drive (HDD), hard disk, hard drive or fixed disk is a data storage device that uses {{magnetic}} storage to store and retrieve digital information using one or more rigid rapidly rotating disks (platters) coated with magnetic material. The platters are paired with magnetic heads, usually arranged on a moving <b>actuator</b> <b>arm,</b> which read and write data to the platter surfaces. Data is accessed in a random-access manner, meaning that individual blocks of data can be stored or retrieved in any order and not only sequentially. HDDs are a type of non-volatile storage, retaining stored data even when powered off.|$|E
25|$|In modern drives, {{there is}} one head for each {{magnetic}} platter surface on the spindle, mounted on a common arm. An <b>actuator</b> <b>arm</b> (or access arm) moves the heads on an arc (roughly radially) across the platters as they spin, allowing each head to access almost the entire surface of the platter as it spins. The arm is moved using a voice coil actuator or in some older designs a stepper motor. Early hard disk drives wrote data at some constant bits per second, resulting in all tracks having {{the same amount of}} data per track but modern drives (since the 1990s) use zone bit recording – increasing the write speed from inner to outer zone and thereby storing more data per track in the outer zones.|$|E

40|$|MEMS {{manufacturing}} requires accurate positioning {{and high}} reproducibility. Lasers can be utilised in accurate post-fabrication adjustment, allowing for manufacturing processes with relatively large tolerances. Laser micro forming (LμF) {{is a process}} for the precision adjustment, shaping or correction of distortion in micro-scale metallic components {{through the application of}} laser irradiation without the need for permanent dies or tools. The non-contact nature of the process is also useful in accessing specific micro-components within a device which may be highly sensitive to mechanical force.

40|$|Thermal laser micro forming (LμF) is a {{non-contact}} {{process for}} the precise adjustment of micro-scale metallic components. Micro-electronic systems often comprise functional components which require highly accurate micro-scale adjustment after fabrication. Such functional components are typically difficult to access and highly sensitive to mechanical force. The application of lasers offers the potential for controlled and repeatable micro-adjustment of these components in a contact free process. The use of a picosecond pulsed laser source reduces the heat diffusion depth when compared to longer pulse durations, resulting in less thermal loading of the bulk substrate. When combined with high repetition rates, localized heat accumulation in micro-scale components can be achieved and utilized in a thermal forming process.

50|$|Edsinger and Weber {{collaborated on}} many other robots as well, and their {{experience}} working with the Kismet page and Cog projects influenced the design of Domo. Kismet was a robotic head developed by Cynthia Breazeal for experimenting with social expressions and cues. Edsinger's role in the project was helping to develop {{the early stages of}} Kismet's eye detection module, which allowed Kismet to make eye contact while interacting. The Cog project was intended to explore the way that intelligence is formed through social interaction. The Cog robot was designed to emulate the human body's motor points and limbs and to accept input stimuli from these so that it could use its limbs in a human-like way. Edsinger's contribution to the Cog project was a Series Elastic <b>Actuator</b> <b>arm</b> and controllers for the body of the robot. Though the research direction of these robots {{is very different from the}} Domo Project, the design of the eye detection module and the Series Elastic <b>Actuator</b> <b>arm</b> are integrated into Domo's design.|$|E
50|$|With {{rotating}} drives, the {{seek time}} measures {{the time it}} takes the head assembly on the <b>actuator</b> <b>arm</b> to travel to the track of the disk where the data will be read or written. The data on the media is stored in sectors which are arranged in parallel circular tracks (concentric or spiral depending upon the device type) and there is an actuator with an arm that suspends a head that can transfer data with that media. When the drive needs to read or write a certain sector it determines in which track the sector is located. It then uses the actuator to move the head to that particular track. If the initial location of the head was the desired track then the seek time would be zero. If the initial track was the outermost edge of the media and the desired track was at the innermost edge then the seek time would be the maximum for that drive. Seek times are not linear compared with the seek distance traveled because of factors of acceleration and deceleration of the <b>actuator</b> <b>arm.</b>|$|E

Essential to this plan is the Ares launch vehicle, NASA s next-generation spacecraft that will, in various iterations, be responsible for transporting all equipment and personnel to the Moon, Mars, and beyond for the foreseeable future. The Ares launch vehicle is powered by the J- 2 X propulsion system, with what will be the world s largest rocket nozzles. One of the conditions that engineers carefully consider in designing rocket nozzles particularly large ones is called separation phenomenon, which occurs when outside ambient air is sucked into the nozzle rim by the relatively low pressures of rapidly expanding exhaust gasses. This separation of exhaust gasses from the side-wall imparts large asymmetric transverse loads on the nozzle, deforming the shape and thus perturbing exhaust flow to cause even greater separation. The resulting interaction can potentially crack the nozzle or break <b>actuator</b> <b>arms</b> that control thrust direction. Side-wall loads are extremely difficult to measure directly, and, until now, techniques were not available for accurately predicting the magnitude and frequency of the loads. NASA researchers studied separation phenomenon in scale-model rocket nozzles, seeking to use measured vibration on these nozzle replicas to calculate the unknown force causing the vibrations. Key to this approach was the creation of a computer model accurately representing the nozzle as well as the test cell...|$|R

5000|$|A {{write head}} magnetises a region by {{generating}} a strong local magnetic field, and a read head detects the magnetisation of the regions.

As data density increased, read heads using magnetoresistance (MR) came into use; the electrical resistance of the head changed according {{to the strength of}} the magnetism from the platter. Later development made use of spintronics; in read heads, the magnetoresistive effect was much greater than in earlier types, and was dubbed [...] "giant" [...] magnetoresistance (GMR).

50|$|An {{external}} wastegate is {{a separate}} self-contained mechanism typically used with turbochargers {{that do not have}} internal wastegates. An external wastegate requires a specially constructed turbo manifold with a dedicated runner going to the wastegate. The external wastegate may be part of the exhaust housing itself. External wastegates are commonly used for regulating boost levels more precisely than internal wastegates in high power applications, where high boost levels can be achieved. External wastegates can be much larger since there is no constraint of integrating the valve or spring into the turbocharger and turbine housing. It is possible to use an external wastegate with an internally gated turbocharger. This can be achieved through a specially designed bracket that easily bolts on and restricts the movement of the <b>actuator</b> <b>arm,</b> keeping it from opening. Another route involves welding the internal wastegate shut which permanently keeps it from opening, but failure of the weld can allow it to open again.|$|E

As the need for faster and increasing capacity but smaller in size of a HDD increases, the reliability of a HDD becomes all the more important, especially preventing errors due to track mis-registration (TMR). In order to avoid TMR due to air induced vibrations of the <b>actuator</b> <b>arm,</b> the flow patterns within a HDD need to be investigated.
