5000|$|The Swiss Cheese {{model of}} <b>accident</b> <b>causation</b> {{is a model}} used in risk {{analysis}} and risk management, including aviation safety, engineering, healthcare, emergency service organizations, and as the principle behind layered security, as used in computer security and defense in depth. It likens human systems to multiple slices of swiss cheese, stacked side by side, in which {{the risk of a}} threat becoming a reality is mitigated by the differing layers and types of defenses which are [...] "layered" [...] behind each other. Therefore, in theory, lapses and weaknesses in one defense do not allow a risk to materialize, since other defenses also exist, to prevent a single point of weakness. The model was originally formally propounded by Dante Orlandella and James T. Reason of the University of Manchester, and has since gained widespread acceptance. It is sometimes called the cumulative act effect.|$|E
50|$|The AcciMap {{approach}} {{is useful for}} uncovering how factors in the {{various parts of the}} system contributed to an accident, and for arranging those factors into a logical causal diagram that illustrates how they combined to result in that event.The method also promotes a systemic view of <b>accident</b> <b>causation</b> as the AcciMap diagram extends well beyond the most immediate causes of the event to reveal the full range of higher-level factors that contributed to the outcome (or failed to prevent it from occurring). It therefore assists analysts in understanding how and why an accident took place, and prevents attention from focusing disproportionately on the immediate causes (such as errors made by front-line workers), because the factors that provoked or permitted those factors are also revealed. The approach therefore helps to avoid blaming frontline individuals for accidents and leaving the factors that contributed to their behaviour unaddressed. In extending to consider contributing factors at governmental, regulatory and societal levels, the approach also has the capacity to capture and address high-level contributing factors that are typically excluded from accident analyses developed using other methods.|$|E

The system can range in complexity from a manned spacecraft to an autonomous machine tool. The system safety concept helps the system designer(s) to model, analyse, gain awareness about, understand and eliminate the hazards, and apply controls to achieve an acceptable level of safety. Ineffective decision making in safety matters {{is regarded as the}} first step in the sequence of hazardous flow of events in the [...] "Swiss Cheese" [...] model of <b>accident</b> <b>causation.</b> [...] Communications regarding system risk have an important role to play in correcting risk perceptions by creating, analysing and understanding information model to show what factors create and control the hazardous process. For almost any system, product, or service, the most effective means of limiting product liability and accident risks is to implement an organized system safety function, beginning in the conceptual design phase and continuing through to its development, fabrication, testing, production, use and ultimate disposal. The aim of the system safety concept is to gain assurance that a system and associated functionality behaves safely and is safe to operate. This assurance is necessary. Technological advances in the past have produced positive as well as negative effects.|$|E

In relation to this it is also relevant to look into the definition successful operations. Method: The empirical study comprises of 10 interviews with people who work on board a drilling rig currently operating in Norway. The informants who participated in the interviews hold different positions and come from different companies represented on board the rig. The thesis does also include a literature review upon related theories. Results and conclusion: The findings in this study show that {{it can be difficult to}} characterise or define successful operations. The definition will be subjective; however there are some common features of successful operations. Maintaining the life and health of people are the number one priority. A successful operation should also result in the intended product even though it might take some more time than planned. A successful operation is created by many factors and conditions. This study identified 27 factors that might contribute to successful operations in terms of safety. It can be difficult to pin point exactly what factors that might create a successful operation. A lot of the theory focuses on informal factors related to humans and their actions, however the findings in this study implies that there must be both formal and informal factors present.

40|$|The Chinese {{construction}} industry is China's third biggest industrial killer. <b>Accidents</b> <b>causation</b> {{analysis revealed that}} more than 80 % of accidents are caused by unsafe human behaviour. The current research was focused on exploring and examining the factors affecting safety rule violations among Chinese construction workers through four main studies in which a combination of qualitative and quantitative methodologies were used. In the first study, on-site observation and organisational document analysis were conducted in fourteen construction companies to familiarise the author with the research settings and to obtain triangulation evidence for the following studies. It {{was followed by the}} second study in which interviews and focus groups were conducted among 97 managers, safety officers and workers in order to explore the factors associated with workers' rule violation. Thematic analysis revealed four main categories of factors, i. e., individual factors, managerial factors, sectoral and labour market factors, and national and cultural factors. The qualitative study was followed by questionnaire surveys (n = 700) to test in a larger management sample the qualitative study's results. Survey results complemented the qualitative study's findings. Based on the obtained results, a fourth study using the Delphi method and the modified G 1 method was conducted among 17 experts in order to calculate the importance levels of each factor in influencing workers' rule violation. Although managerial factor was ranked as the most influential factor compared with other categories, some extra-organisational factors and situations were ranked at high positions amongst 24 specific factors. The results suggested that workers' behaviour need to be scrutinised not only within the context of organisational safety management, but also from the particular background and characteristics of Chinese migrant workers, Chinese construction sector, as well as the society and the culture...|$|R

A theoretical framework based on a periodization scheme is introduced first.

According to this five age/three era framework; six theories and models have been used for explaining <b>accident</b> <b>causation,</b> and three approaches commonly used for managing OHS. The key premises of <b>accident</b> <b>causation</b> theories and models are that accidents can be associated with single factors, mostly caused by unsafe acts of humans, and the sequence of events which lead to them occurring involves a linear sequence of events. The three main strategies for managing OHS in this era included technical, regulatory and behavior-based safety; with only one of these being informed through research on <b>accident</b> <b>causation.</b> Limitations and implications for practice of these are discussed, together with some identified gaps in research and practice...|$|E

30|$|Many {{accident}} analysis methods and accident {{models have been}} proposed. The <b>accident</b> <b>causation</b> theory consists of the <b>accident</b> <b>causation</b> chain, accident attribution theory, and accident triangle theory (Fu et al. 2013). The <b>accident</b> <b>causation</b> chain can be classified as the classical, modern, and contemporary <b>accident</b> <b>causation</b> chain according to the depth of analysis (Fu 2013). The classical <b>accident</b> <b>causation</b> chain, i.e. accident proneness theory (Greenwood and Woods 1919) and energy transfer theory (Sui et al. 2005), analyzes accidents from two viewpoints: the fault of people and physical reasons. The modern <b>accident</b> <b>causation</b> chain adds education and management factors as the root cause, such as Wigglesworthâs education model (Fu 2013) and Birdâs (1974) <b>accident</b> <b>causation</b> model. However, these models do not give specific explanations for the management factors, which make them difficult to use for practical {{accident analysis}}. As an advanced theory, the contemporary <b>accident</b> <b>causation</b> chain classifies management factors into several categories, which is helpful for practice application. The âSwiss cheeseâ model (Reason 1990), Stewartâs accident cause model (Stewart 2011), the 24 Model (Fu et al. 2016 a), and the human factors analysis and classification system (HFACS) (Shappell and Wiegmann 2000) all belong to the contemporary causation chains. HFACS, {{as one of the}} most famous models, was proposed by Shappell and Wiegmann in 2000 and established on the basis of the âSwiss cheeseâ model. The 24 Model was proposed in 2005 (Fu et al. 2005 b) and has become a common accident cause analysis method through continuous improvement. Compared with the famous HFACS, what advantages and disadvantages the 24 Model actually has, as one of the latest accident cause chains, is what we need to focus on. However, until this time, few studies have researched the differences between the theories and applications of these two models. Mi et al. (2014) analyzed a fire accident to illustrate the advantages and disadvantages of the âSwiss cheeseâ model, HFACS, and the 24 Model. However, the 24 Model used in this study was not the latest version, and the comparison was not comprehensive.|$|E

For {{the purpose of this}} report they have been defined as Urban Personal Vehicles â Single Track (UPV- 1 T). A key characteristic of these vehicles are electrified powertrains, and it is expected that the vehicles will become cheaper and therefore more accessible to a greater proportion of the population but will be more powerful and lighter, therefore increasing the vehicles speed and acceleration. A detailed potential technology development path of these vehicle types, and therefore potential critical situation and collision conditions, are unknown. A study was undertaken to look at what type of UPV- 1 Tâs are currently available on the Swedish market and the current performance specifications of these vehicles. A picture of the current situation surrounding bicycle, moped and motorcycle <b>accidents</b> and <b>causation</b> factors were presented for the Swedish market.

An injury analysis was undertaken of young and older transport users from 5 years of injury surveillance data collected at participating trauma hospitals in Victoria, Australia. The analysis was undertaken {{for inclusion in}} the UK project on Improving the Safety for Older Public Transport Users. Details of injuries were recorded on attendance including the patientsâ account of the circumstances of the <b>accident</b> and <b>causation</b> factors. Results showed that injury risk was more common among bus passengers than those on either trams or trains. The most common injuries were to the head and face regions and upper and lower limbs. Chest injuries were especially problematic among older travellers and they sustained more multiple life-threating injuries than their younger counterparts. Entering or exiting the vehicle accounted for almost two-thirds of all injury-causing events. The most common mechanisms involved a slip, trip or fall while getting on and off the vehicle or while on-board or running to catch public transport. Being hit, struck or crushed by another person or an object was also noted. Injuries to older public transport users was positively correlated with increasing age. The majority of those injured required out-patient treatment at the participating hospital but was dependent on the participantâs age. Opportunities for intervention included improved boarding and exiting facilities at bus and tram stops and reducing hazardous structural members inside these vehicles would be helpful. A number of limitations in this study were noted and areas requiring further research were identified for future studies.

40|$|Under {{a rule of}} {{comparative}} <b>causation,</b> an <b>accident</b> loss is shared between a victim and a tortfeasor when the parties are either both negligent (as with comparative negligence) or when they are both non-negligent. When {{one or the other}} party is found solely negligent, the negligent party bears the entire <b>accident</b> loss. Comparative <b>causation</b> is the only tort regime that allows sharing of an accident loss between a non-negligent injurer and his non-negligent victim. By allowing the sharing of an accident loss in equilibrium, the comparative causation rule has efficiency and risk-allocation properties that are never observed under conventional negligence or strict liability regimes. With respect to efficiency, the comparative causation rule spreads activity level and R&D incentives between the parties, rather than concentrating them on one or the other party (the residual bearer). With respect to the allocation of risk, comparative causation avoids the all-or-nothing allocations of the residual loss that we observe under other legal rules. In doing so, comparative causation provides a mechanism of mutual insurance of victim and tortfeasor with a more equitable apportionment of the residual loss. In spite of these interesting attributes, the existing literature still falls short of establishing the compatibility {{of comparative}} causation with efficiency. In this paper, we show that loss sharing can be achieved while preserving optimal care incentives for both parties. ...|$|R

Data from the NCIS involved a collection of coronial data on deaths reported to the Australian coroner from 2000 onwards and contains details on the police report of death, autopsy reports, toxicology reports and coronial findings. The VEMD results showed that injury was more common among bus passengers than those on either trams or trains, especially when taking account of their relatively lower usage. The most common injuries from these incidents were to the head and face regions and upper and lower limbs. Chest injuries were especially problematic for older travellers: they sustained more multiple injuries especially those likely to be life-threatening than their younger counterparts. Getting on or off the vehicle accounted for almost two-thirds of all injury-causing events and the most common mechanisms involved a slip, trip or fall while getting on and off the vehicle or while onboard or running to catch public transport. Being hit, struck or crushed by another person or an object was also reported. Injuries to older public transport users appeared to be positively correlated with increasing age. The majority of those injured only required out-patient treatment at the participating hospital but this too was somewhat dependent on the participantâs age. The NCIS results further showed that for fatal outcomes to public transport users, self-harm was a predominant cause and older people seemed less involved than younger ones, albeit young-older groups. Males predominated over females and most mechanisms involved external impacts. Trains were heavily over-involved as a vehicle type and there were high proportions of multiple injuries, especially those judged to be intentional. A range of possible interventions to prevent these events and mitigate injury severity was identified and a number of limitations in this study were noted. Several areas requiring further research were identified for future studies, in particular, the need for more definitive in-depth studies of public transport injurious incidents was especially noteworthy...|$|R
