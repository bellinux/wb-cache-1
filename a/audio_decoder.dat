50|$|DTV {{broadcasters}} can broadcast multiple separate video programs {{over one}} channel frequency {{in a digital}} subchannel, so {{it is necessary for}} a portable radio equipped with a digital <b>audio</b> <b>decoder</b> to do more than simply tune in to the frequency as with older analog receivers. It also needs to provide a way for the listener to choose among these digital subchannels, usually labeled as *.1, *.2, *.3, etc., on digital televisions with ATSC tuners. This is possible using an analog tuning dial to tune in to a digital TV broadcast, coupled with a button to select the digital subchannel.|$|E
50|$|Each video- or <b>audio</b> <b>decoder</b> needs {{information}} about the used coding parameters, for instance resolution, frame rate and IDR (Random Access Point) repetition rate. In MPEG-4/AVC, mobile TV systems the receiver uses information from the Session Description Protocol File (SDP-File). The SDP-file is a format which describes streaming media initialization parameters. In ATSC-M/H, the SDP-File is transmitted within the SMT-Table. Most of the information is coded in binary, but some is coded in the original ASCII text format. The SMT-Table combines information that is typically in different tables and reduces the complexity for the network and the receivers. In case of signaling with ESG, the complete SDP-File is transmitted.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Most {{of the new}} {{embedded}} systems require high performance pro-cessors at low power. To cater to these needs, most semiconductor companies are designing multi-core processors, also known as chip-multiprocessors, while some are developing multi-chip boards with existing multi-core processors. Developing applications on these powerful architectures require specialized tools to obtain the optimum performance. Most applications running on these processors not only require high processing power, but also have tight resource constraints. For both, chip-multiprocessors and multi-chip boards, one faces some common problems while developing applications for them. To meet this end, we have developed tools to model high-performance embedded applications on these complex high-end systems. We have integrated these tools in the modeling framework of MILAN, and have modeled a real application, Mpeg- 2 <b>Audio</b> Video <b>Decoder.</b> For validation we have used Cradle Technologies MDSP multi-core chip as the target processor. ...|$|R
