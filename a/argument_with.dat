50|$|Studies on belief-bias effect {{were first}} {{designed}} by Jonathan Evans {{to create a}} conflict between logical reasoning and prior knowledge about the truth of conclusions. Participants are asked to evaluate syllogisms that are: valid <b>arguments</b> <b>with</b> believable conclusions, valid <b>arguments</b> <b>with</b> unbelievable conclusions, invalid <b>arguments</b> <b>with</b> believable conclusions, and invalid <b>arguments</b> <b>with</b> unbelievable conclusions. Participants are told to only agree with conclusions that logically follow from the premises given. The results suggest when the conclusion is believable, people erroneously accept invalid conclusions as valid more often than invalid arguments are accepted which support unpalatable conclusions. This is taken to suggest that System 1 beliefs are interfering with the logic of System 2.|$|R
