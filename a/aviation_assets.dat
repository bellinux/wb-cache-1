5|$|From 1997, the 166th Aviation Brigade {{has trained}} other {{aviation}} units for front-line service. As such, {{it has never}} seen combat, and has thus never earned any campaign streamers or unit awards. As the only brigade in the First Army responsible for training aviation units, the 166th Aviation Brigade is the principal unit for training Army Reserve and Army National Guard assets preparing to deploy to contingencies around the world, which means it is responsible for 47 percent of all Army <b>Aviation</b> <b>assets.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 2008, the brigade's combat service/combat {{sustainment}} support battalions took part in equipment testing and training in Rapid City, South Dakota. It tested the Multifunction Agile Remote Control Robot IV, a route clearance robot, {{with the assistance of}} the South Dakota National Guard. The bulk of the brigade spent the summer at Fort Sill, Oklahoma to train <b>aviation</b> <b>assets</b> for deploying units. In June 2008, the brigade trained the <b>aviation</b> <b>assets</b> of the 34th Infantry Division in air combat, air assault, and other tactics related to aviation. For this mission, the brigade was assisted by the 479th Field Artillery Brigade, which handled ground exercises. As part of a new training routine, the brigade trained the 34th Infantry Division's aviation units at Fort Rucker, spending a longer time training the unit because it continued to train the brigade as it mobilized and prepared to deploy. Other units trained with the Division, but none through the entire mobilization process. This process used new and never-before-used facilities to streamline training exercises. Purportedly, it gave the 166th Aviation Brigade much additional time for training, as the streamlining process made some programs more efficient, cutting time needed to prepare for them in half.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{with the}} July 5 Battle of Osan, US troops began a {{continuous}} and unsuccessful ground {{campaign against the}} North Koreans, {{and many of the}} US air assets were used in close air support and airstrike roles to aid the faltering ground troops. From this point on bombers mounted strategic bombing missions against military targets of all types supporting the North Korean ground troops, including ports, armor concentrations and supply stockpiles. A massive interdiction campaign ensued which would have implications for the upcoming conflicts. As more US Air Force, US Navy and US Marine Corps <b>aviation</b> <b>assets</b> arrived in the country, they increased their interdiction campaigns for several days striking bridges and strategic areas though going mostly unthreatened by the North Korean Air Force, though at least one F-80 was lost when it hit power lines during a bombing run.|$|E
50|$|In March 2010, the 101st Combat Aviation Brigade {{deployed}} {{again to}} Afghanistan as Task Force Destiny to Kandahar Airfield {{to be the}} <b>aviation</b> <b>asset</b> in southern Afghanistan.|$|R
50|$|In 2007, {{the group}} {{established}} <b>Aviation</b> <b>Asset</b> Management (now AviaAM Leasing). In June 2008, it signed its first third-party lease contract with Kazakh Scat Air. AviaAM leasing left {{the group in}} 2010. In 2013 AviaAM Leasing launched its IPO and now is listed on WSE.|$|R
50|$|Beginning in January 2002, {{the brigade}} {{responded to the}} call to arms in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan {{following}} the attacks on 9/11. The 101st was the first conventional <b>aviation</b> <b>asset</b> deployed after 9/11. The 101st would support the 187th Infantry Regiment (3rd BCT of the 101st Airborne Division), fighting Taliban and Al-Qaeda forces.|$|R
5|$|The {{mission of}} the ARVN central column was to advance down {{the valley of the}} Se Pone River, a {{relatively}} flat area of brush interspersed with patches of jungle and dominated by heights to its north and the river and more mountains to the south. Almost immediately, supporting helicopters began to take fire from the heights, which allowed PAVN gunners to fire down on the aircraft from pre-registered machine gun and mortar positions. Making matters worse for the advance, Route 9 was in poor condition, so poor in fact that only tracked vehicles and jeeps could make the westward journey. This threw the burden of reinforcement and resupply onto the <b>aviation</b> <b>assets.</b> The helicopter units then became the essential mode of logistical support, a role that was made increasingly more dangerous due to low cloud cover and incessant anti-aircraft fire.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, an interservice {{political}} struggle {{took place in}} the headquarters at Hue/Phu Bai, Saigon, and the Pentagon over who should control <b>aviation</b> <b>assets</b> supporting the entire American effort in Southeast Asia. Westmoreland had given his deputy commander for air operations, Air Force General William W. Momyer, the responsibility for coordinating all air assets during the operation to support KSCB. This caused problems for the Marine command, which possessed its own aviation squadrons that operated under their own close air support doctrine. The Marines were extremely reluctant to relinquish authority over their aircraft to an Air Force General. The command and control arrangement then in place in Southeast Asia went against Air Force doctrine, which was predicated on the single air manager concept. One headquarters would allocate and coordinate all air assets, distributing them wherever they were considered most necessary, and then transferring them as the situation required. The Marines, whose aircraft and doctrine were integral to their operations, were under no such centralized control. On 18 January Westmoreland passed his request for Air Force control up the chain of command to CINCPAC in Honolulu.|$|E
25|$|Aviation Combat Element (ACE): Consists of a {{composite}} medium tiltrotor (MV-22B Osprey) squadron containing transport <b>aviation</b> <b>assets</b> of various models and capabilities, attack helicopters and jets, air defense teams and all necessary ground support assets.|$|E
50|$|A powered {{parachute}} as {{operated in}} the observation platform role by the Ripon Police Department and other police departments has assisted with suspect captures, river rescues, critical infrastructure over-flights, crime scene photos, narcotics enforcement and crime suppression {{at a small}} fraction of the cost of a police helicopter. This low-cost <b>aviation</b> <b>asset</b> was procured from the US Department of Justice, Aviation Technology Program.|$|R

25|$|For some time, the Regiment of Artillery {{commanded}} a significantly {{larger share of}} the Army's personnel than it does now, as it was also responsible for air defense artillery and some <b>aviation</b> <b>assets.</b> The 1990s saw the formation of the Corps of Army Air Defence and the coalescing of all <b>aviation</b> <b>assets</b> into the Army Aviation Corps. The arm is now focused on field artillery, and supplies regiments and batteries to each of the operational commands. The home of the Regiment is in Nashik, Maharashtra, where their headquarters is located along with the service's museum. The School of Artillery of the Indian Army is located nearby in Devlali.|$|E
25|$|In March 1997, the Board of Inquiry {{into the}} Black Hawk Training Accident in June 1996 {{recommended}} that dedicated Army <b>aviation</b> <b>assets</b> be allocated {{in support of}} the counter terrorist and special operations capability and that the units be collocated during training, planning and the conduct of operations.|$|E
25|$|As closely {{neighboring}} countries, Israel and Cyprus {{have enjoyed}} greatly improving diplomatic relations since 2010. During the Mount Carmel Forest Fire, Cyprus dispatched two <b>aviation</b> <b>assets</b> to assist fire-fighting operations in Israel – {{the first time}} Cypriot Government aircraft were permitted to operate from Israeli airfields in a non-civil capacity. In addition, Israel and Cyprus have closely cooperated in maritime activities relating to Gaza, since 2010, and have reportedly begun an extensive sharing program of regional intelligence to support mutual security concerns. On 17 May 2012, it was widely reported that the Israeli Air Force had been granted unrestricted access to the Nicosia Flight Information Region of Cyprus, and that Israeli <b>aviation</b> <b>assets</b> may have operated over the island itself. Cyprus, as a former S-300 air-defense system operator, was speculated by Greek media to have assisted Israel in strategic planning to challenge such air-defense systems, alongside shorter-range SAM systems, although this remains unconfirmed.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{subsequent}} tests encompassed more broadly in combined amphibious/ground reconnaissance efforts, its aerial reconnaissance elements cannot be overlooked since aircraft were both tested for direct combat support and reconnaissance. The <b>aviation</b> reconnaissance <b>assets</b> {{did not see}} further scrutiny until {{the outset of the}} Korean War.|$|R

50|$|From Santo Domingo the {{squadron}} traveled to San Diego, California {{and became the}} first Marine squadron on the West Coast and was designated as the <b>aviation</b> <b>asset</b> to accompany Marine Expeditionary Forces. During the West Coast interlude, the late Major General Ross E. Rowell, then a Major and Commanding Officer concentrated on training in dive-bombing tactics. Such tactics were to prove invaluable to {{the squadron}} in Nicaragua, during July 1927, where the squadron had been ordered the previous February. Shortly after its redesignation on July 1, 1927 to VO-8M, the squadron participated in the Battle of Ocotal on 16 July when ten personnel of the squadron came to the rescue of the beleaguered Marine garrison at Ocotal and executed the first recorded dive bombing attack against an organized enemy, dispersing the insurgents and saving the garrison. Among the first Marine aviators ever to receive the Distinguished Flying Cross were Major Rowell and Lieutenant Hayne Boyden, to whom it was awarded for their participation in the Battle of Ocotal.|$|R
25|$|After World War I ended, {{there was}} a general {{interest}} in organizing <b>aviation</b> <b>assets</b> for the National Guard system. At the time, in the US force structure aircraft were organized into infantry units in a fashion similar to other weapons, like artillery. Guard units without their own aircraft units would need units from other forces to be sent to operate with them, a situation no-one thought was promising.|$|E
25|$|The XBQM-108 {{project was}} {{initiated}} in 1975 by the Aviation and Surface Effects Department of the U.S. Navy's David W. Taylor Naval Ship Research and Development Center. The project {{was intended to}} demonstrate the practicality of the 'Vertical Attitude Take-Off and Landing' (VATOL), or 'tailsitter' flight profile for remotely piloted vehicles, as the Navy believed the increasing threat posed by cruise missiles required that <b>aviation</b> <b>assets</b> be dispersed among additional ships of the fleet, which would possess limited space for aviation operations as opposed to conventional aircraft carriers.|$|E
25|$|After the Battle of Caporetto, Italian <b>aviation</b> <b>assets</b> had {{dwindled to}} 59 squadrons {{containing}} 378 craft, with {{slightly more than}} 100 being fighters. For aircrews, it could muster 497 pilots, 284 observers, and 152 gunners. It had also lost the use of 22 airfields, {{as well as other}} infrastructure that had fallen into enemy hands. The net effect of Caporetto was to set the Italian air effort back some one to two years. However, the Italian Air Force officially scored 170 aerial victories for 1917, in 700 combats.|$|E
50|$|The {{headquarters}} element, {{which included}} {{the majority of the}} task force's many <b>aviation</b> and intelligence <b>assets,</b> was based at Balad Air Base between Samarra and Baghdad; the four elements that it controlled, each commanded by a lieutenant colonel or equivalent, were spread across the country.|$|R
50|$|On 19 June, the day Operation Ganga Prahar became Operation Surya Hope, and the {{strength}} of the Army in the affected area was 5,600. By 27 June 2013, the Army's numbers in the mission area had increased to above 8,500. Army's disaster response units included infantry battalions, Army Service Corps units to provide Logistic and Supply support, signals regiment, engineer regiments, advance dressing stations and other medical units, special forces, specialised mountain troops, paratroopers, and army <b>aviation</b> corps <b>assets.</b> The Army <b>Aviation</b> Corps deployed 13 helicopters (nine on 19 June and an additional four the next day). This is the largest humanitarian mission by the Indian Army in several decades.|$|R

25|$|The Army of the Republic of Bosnia And Herzegovina {{was created}} on 15 April 1992 {{during the early}} days of the Bosnian War. Before the ARBiH was {{formally}} created, there existed Territorial Defence, an official military force of Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and a number of paramilitary groups such as the Green Berets, Patriotic League, and civil defense groups, as well as many criminal gangs and collections of police and military professionals. The army was formed under poor circumstances, with a very low number of tanks, APCs and no military <b>aviation</b> <b>assets.</b> The army was divided into Corps, each Corp was stationed in a territory. The first commander was Sefer Halilović.|$|E
25|$|In December 2003 the <b>aviation</b> <b>assets</b> of the Russian Ground Forces —mostly helicopters— were {{transferred}} to the VVS, following the shooting down of a Mi-26 helicopter in Chechnya on 19 August 2002, that claimed 19 lives. The former Army Aviation was in its previous form intended for the direct support of the Ground Forces, by providing their tactical air support, conducting tactical aerial reconnaissance, transporting airborne troops, providing fire support of their actions, electronic warfare, setting of minefield barriers and other tasks. The former Army Aviation was subsequently managed by the Chief of the Department of Army Aviation. However, by 2010, {{it was announced that}} the 2003 decision to transfer Ground Force Aviation to the Air Force was reversed, with the transfer back to the Ground Forces to occur sometime in 2015 or 2016.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} addesses {{events in}} Northern Afghanistan between April 2009 and 2014. While {{this part of}} the country had long been relatively peaceful compared to the all-out war zones of the south and east, tensions would flare up again in 2008 when the German soldiers deployed to the area came under attack more often, leading to the deaths of the several soldiers. Previously hindered by national caveats, the deteroriating security situation prompted the German-led Regional Command North to launch a series of operations to take on the rising insurgency. Concerted operations began after an insurgent attack on PRT Kunduz within minutes of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's departure from a visit. Within two years, the German presence would be doubled and additional reinforcements from the American ISAF contingent were called in, including heavy German armoured vehicles and US <b>aviation</b> <b>assets,</b> allowing for a more aggressive approach towards the insurgency.|$|E
50|$|January 17, 2006 - U.S. Customs and Border Protection {{consolidated}} all <b>aviation</b> {{and marine}} <b>assets</b> under the newly titled Office of Air and Marine, {{which has the}} responsibility of providing training, creating standard operating procedures, as well as procuring and maintaining equipment for the entirety of CBP's aviation and marine programs.

50|$|The Arkansas National Guard {{provided}} the first guard units from outside Louisiana {{to respond to}} the Louisiana Governor’s request for support when the 77th Theater <b>Aviation</b> Brigade deployed <b>assets</b> to New Orleans. A total of 3000 Arkansas National Guard Soldiers and Airmen were mobilized, with 1500 deployed to Louisiana at the peak of operations. The Arkansas National Guard assisted with processing over 10,000 evacuees through the Chaffee Maneuver Training Center (Fort Chaffee) at Fort Smith Arkansas. Arkansas National Guard units were among the last to leave Louisiana, finally handing off its missions to the Louisiana National Guard in February 2006.|$|R
25|$|All Jewish <b>aviation</b> <b>assets</b> {{were placed}} {{under the control of}} the Sherut Avir (Air Service, known as the SA) in November 1947 and flying {{operations}} began in the following month from a small civil airport on the outskirts of Tel Aviv called Sde Dov, with the first ground support operation (in an RWD-13) taking place on 17 December. The Galilee Squadron was formed at Yavne'el in March 1948, and the Negev Squadron was formed at Nir-Am in April. By 10 May, when the SA suffered its first combat loss, there were three flying units, an air staff, maintenance facilities and logistics support. At the outbreak of the war on 15 May, the SA became the Israeli Air Force. With its fleet of light planes it was no match for Arab forces during the first few weeks of the war with their T-6s, Spitfires, C-47s, and Avro Ansons.|$|E
25|$|There are {{currently}} four organizations {{at the airport}} that offer fixed based operator services for general aviation users. One name familiar to the area we live in also resides in Kalamazoo. Duncan Aviation, which {{is located on the}} west side of the airfield, offers a large variety of services as it is the only full-service fixed based operator on the field. Duncan handles the traditional FBO services such as fueling. Maintenance, hangaring, aircraft movement, and many other ground services while also providing weather equipment and crew rest areas for pilots. They also offer passenger service such as rental and courtesy cars, restrooms vending, and a lobby area. The Duncan facility is the terminal for entrance to the general aviation side of the airport. Kalamazoo Aircraft is another major fixed based operator at the airport that offers maintenance services to smaller general aviation aircraft; they offer inspections, maintenance, repairs, and alterations. The third FBO on the field is the Kalamazoo Pilots Association which operates a self-service fueling pump in the hangar area. The last fixed based operator is <b>Aviation</b> <b>Assets</b> which conducts a flight training school on the north side of the airport.|$|E
25|$|After {{the broken}} {{transmission}} from the SEAL reconnaissance and surveillance team, {{the position and}} situation of the SEALs became unknown. Members of SEAL Team 10, U.S. Marines, and aviators of the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment were prepared to dispatch a quick reaction force, but command for launch from higher special operations headquarters was delayed {{for a number of}} hours. A quick reaction force finally launched, consisting of two MH-47 Special Operations Aircraft of the 160th, two UH-60 conventional Army aviation Black Hawk helicopters, and two AH-64 Apache attack helicopters. The two MH-47s took the lead. Upon reaching Sawtalo Sar, the two MH-47s received small arms fire. During an attempt to insert SEALs who were riding in one of the MH-47 helicopters, one of Ahmad Shah's men fired an RPG-7 rocket-propelled grenade, which struck the transmission below the rear rotor assembly, causing the aircraft to immediately plummet to the ground, killing all eight 160th Army Special Operations Aviators and crew, and all eight Navy SEALs who were passengers. Both commanders of the 160th, Ground commander LCDR Erik S. Kristensen, of SEAL Team 10, and aviation element commander Major Stephen C. Reich, were killed in the shootdown. Command and control (C2) at this point was lost, and neither visual nor radio contact could be established with the SEAL reconnaissance and surveillance team. At this point, which was late in the afternoon, storm clouds were moving in over the region. The aircraft returned to their respective bases, and a massive search began, at first from the ground, and then with <b>aviation</b> <b>assets.</b>|$|E
