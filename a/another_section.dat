5|$|Before Michigan {{became a}} state, the first land {{transportation}} corridors were the Indian trails. The original Shore Trail ran roughly {{parallel to the}} route of the modern US23 from the Bay City area to Cheboygan. <b>Another</b> <b>section</b> of the current highway followed the Saginaw Trail between Flint and Saginaw.|$|E
5|$|In 2000/01, {{the track}} towards Portishead were relaid to allow rail access to Royal Portbury Docks. In 2010, <b>another</b> <b>section</b> of track was {{reinstated}} {{to allow the}} reopening of South Liberty Lane depot to handle Trans Ocean's wine import business, reducing road traffic. Seven trains terminate at the depot every week. The depot had closed in 1990 {{due to lack of}} demand for its facilities.|$|E
5|$|Most Scouts {{choose to}} work on the Explorer badge that is related to the section of Scouting their Troop belongs to, but {{there is no reason why}} a Scout can not do an Explorer badge from <b>another</b> <b>section.</b> The only {{difference}} between the three Explorer badges is the three compulsory interest badges that are required, and the design of the badge.|$|E

50|$|Ultimately, the {{majority}} of the study's recommendations were brought to fruition in some form or <b>another.</b> <b>Sections</b> of Hobart's three major radial highways—the Tasman Highway (Tasman Bridge to Airport), the Brooker Highway (North of Berriedale) and the Southern Outlet—were influenced in their construction by the study's recommendations for grade-separated, limited-access freeway designs.|$|R

5|$|The {{first section}} of I-496 was opened in December 1963, and ran from I-96 northerly to M-43/M-78 (Saginaw and Kalamazoo streets) between Lansing and East Lansing. The freeway, {{comprising}} the southern two-thirds, was designated I-496/M-78/BL I-96 while the northern portion was on city streets as M-78/BL I-96. Some 50men completed the work by year's end; they went entirely without vacation time to accomplish the feat. <b>Another</b> <b>section</b> of freeway was opened in 1966, and US127 was rerouted to follow I-496/M-78. BL I-96 was removed from I-496/US127/M-78 and routed along the former US127. The freeway segment north of the Trowbridge Road interchange continuing northward as part of US127 was opened in 1969. <b>Another</b> <b>section</b> opened {{at the same time}} was the western section from I-96 to Lansing Road (then US27) in 1969. The remaining section between M-99 (then Logan Street, now Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard) and I-496/US127 opened on December 18, 1970, completing construction.|$|E
5|$|M-72 {{was first}} {{designated}} as a state highway by 1919 along a segment of its current route. It was extended southward in the mid-1920s and westward in the 1940s. One section of the modern highway added to M-72 in 1940 previously existed as M-208 in the 1930s east of Grayling. <b>Another</b> <b>section</b> of highway near Empire was disconnected {{from the rest of}} M-72 until the gap was eliminated later in the decade. All of M-72 was completely paved by the early 1960s. The highway was rerouted in a few places in the 1950s, and the last new segment shifted in 1973 near Kalkaska.|$|E
5|$|Part of modern-day Route311 was {{originally}} the Philipstown Turnpike, a road built in 1815 {{to overcome a}} lack of transportation when the Hudson River froze during the winter months. The turnpike was a large business center for the county, though it was abandoned due to insufficient tolls to maintain it. <b>Another</b> <b>section</b> was constructed in the early 1900s, from the Patterson Baptist Church near the modern-day intersection of Route311 and Route164 to the Village of Patterson, {{by a group of}} Italian immigrants.|$|E

5|$|The eastern {{terminus}} of I-94 in the Port Huron {{area was}} dedicated on October 14, 1964, signaling {{the completion of}} the highway between Marysville and the Blue Water Bridge. Two years later, the gap between the Wayne–Macomb county line {{and the end of the}} freeway near Mount Clemens was filled in when <b>another</b> <b>section</b> of freeway opened. North of Albion, the route of the freeway previously crossed a branch of the New York Central Railroad at-grade; the crossing was eliminated when the tracks were removed in 1968.|$|E
5|$|After Winterbourne Stoke {{the route}} once again becomes dual {{carriageway}} from Yarnbury Castle {{and across the}} Wylye valley, meeting the A36 at Deptford. There is then <b>another</b> <b>section</b> of single carriageway road, {{coming out of the}} valley and up to the crest of the Great Ridge, before a further section of dual two lane road down from the hill crest near Berwick St Leonard. On reaching the valley, it reverts again to single carriageway and through the village of Chicklade, before following the terrain over to Mere, where it runs north of the town as another dual carriageway bypass. Continuing west, it passes south of Wincanton and then north of Sparkford to a roundabout where the road reverts once more to single carriageway.|$|E
5|$|Another {{part of the}} 5th Division had {{gathered}} unseen below Courtnay's Post, which was held by the 14th Battalion, and at 04:00 they rushed the trench, throwing hand grenades. The post was only defended by an Australian section, two of whom were killed and another two wounded; as the Turks occupied {{that part of the}} post the surviving Australians retreated. The Turks were now in a position to observe and bring fire down on Monash Valley. However, from <b>another</b> <b>section</b> of the post Private Albert Jacka led a small group of men in a counter-attack on the Turks. Jacka shot five of the Turks, bayoneted another two, and chased the rest out of the post. For this feat he was awarded the Victoria Cross.|$|E

5|$|At the split, MD 4 heads {{northwest}} on four-lane divided Southern Maryland Boulevard while MD 2 heads northeast on two-lane undivided Solomons Island Road. Shortly after splitting from MD 4, {{the route}} intersects the eastern terminus of MD 262 (Lower Marlboro Road) before heading into woodland with areas of residences and businesses. <b>Another</b> <b>section</b> of MD 765 called Wayside Drive loops {{to the west}} of MD 2 for a distance before MD 765 loops again to the east on Mt. Harmony Lane. MD 765 returns to MD 2 past this intersection and MD 778 then loops to the east of the route on Old Solomons Island Road. The route continues north to an intersection with MD 260 (Chesapeake Beach Road) near Owings.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth Courtauld, {{wife of the}} {{industrialist}} and art collector Samuel Courtauld, {{promoted a}} popular series of subscription concerts beginning in 1929 and on Schnabel's advice engaged Sargent as chief conductor, with guest conductors as eminent as Bruno Walter, Otto Klemperer and Stravinsky. The Courtauld-Sargent concerts, as they became known, were aimed at people who had not previously attended concerts. They attracted large audiences bringing Sargent's name before <b>another</b> <b>section</b> of the public. In addition to the core repertory, Sargent introduced new works by Bliss, Honegger, Kodály, Martinů, Prokofiev, Szymanowski and Walton, among others. At first, {{the plan was to}} engage the London Symphony Orchestra for these concerts, but the orchestra, a self-governing co-operative, refused to replace key players whom Sargent considered sub-standard. As a result, in conjunction with Beecham, Sargent set about establishing a new orchestra, the London Philharmonic.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, the New York State Legislature created Route36, an {{unsigned}} legislative {{route that}} extended from Owego to Seneca Falls via Candor, Ithaca, and Ovid. South of Romulus, Route36 utilized {{what is now}} NY96 and NY96B. When {{the first set of}} posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924, the Owego–Interlaken and Ovid–Romulus portions of legislative Route36 became part of NY15, which began in Owego and proceeded northwest from Romulus to Rochester by way of Waterloo, Phelps, Victor, Mendon, and Pittsford. From Mendon to Rochester, NY15 followed the path of legislative Route14, another highway dating back to 1908 that continued south from Mendon on what is now NY64 and used Monroe Avenue between Pittsford and Rochester. <b>Another</b> <b>section</b> of NY15—from the village of Phelps east to NY14—utilized what had been designated as part of legislative Route6-a from 1911 to 1921.|$|E

5|$|In Harrison, NY120 passes several mansions on {{both sides}} of the highway as it {{gradually}} turns northwestward and approaches I-287 (the Cross Westchester Expressway). The route parallels the western edge of the freeway for several blocks to Westchester Avenue, where NY120 meets the southern end of NY120A, an alternate route through the easternmost part of Westchester County. While NY120A heads east toward Port Chester, NY120 takes on the Westchester Avenue name as the two directions of the route split to follow collector/distributor roads running northwestward along both sides of I-287. The route remains on the frontage roads for about a half-mile (0.8km) to <b>another</b> <b>section</b> of Purchase Street, where NY120 turns to follow a slightly more northward track through another residential section of Harrison.|$|E
5|$|MD 177 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with MD 2 (Governor Ritchie Highway) in Pasadena {{just north of}} MD 2's interchange with MD 100 (Paul T. Pitcher Memorial Highway). The state highway heads east as a six-lane divided highway which drops to four lanes at its intersection with a ramp from southbound MD 10 (Arundel Expressway) and ramps to and from westbound MD 100. MD 177 passes under MD 10, spawns a ramp onto northbound MD 10, and meets {{the southern end of}} MD 648 (BaltimoreAnnapolis Boulevard) at Lipin's Corner. At the next intersection, unsigned MD 915 (Long Hill Road) splits to the south. MD 177 continues east as a two-lane road that regularly gains a center turn lane. The state highway intersects <b>another</b> <b>section</b> of MD 648 (Waterford Road), Catherine Avenue, and Edwin Raynor Boulevard on its way to Jacobsville. In the center of Jacobsville, MD 177 intersects MD 607, which heads south as Magothy Bridge Road and north as Hog Neck Road.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the bottle}} of {{messages}} from the raft, on which Michael, Sawyer, Jin and Walt Lloyd were travelling, washes ashore.

In the hatch, Jack and Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) inspect the mysterious concrete barricade blocking {{what appears to be}} a corridor to <b>another</b> <b>section</b> of the bunker. They discover that the barrier is very thick and that the corridor is also blocked on the foundation level. Later, Jack and Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) share a moment of sexual tension when she exits the shower wearing only a towel.|$|E

5|$|NSB Gjøvikbanen {{operates}} nine Class 69g three-car electric multiple unit. They {{were originally}} built by Strømmens Værksted in 1983 and 1984, and delivered {{as part of}} the D-series to NSB. They have since been operating as commuter trains. Prior to the PSO process, the trains were rebuilt by Danske Statsbaner in Denmark, and were completely renovated and refurbished, {{at the expense of the}} Ministry of Transport. The refurbishments included a new color design, where the deep red exterior was supplemented with details in silver and orange. The interior was also replaced, and consists of a silver scheme. Part of the end cars were converted into quiet zones, while <b>another</b> <b>section</b> is a comfort zone (first class), which has a NOK 90 price supplement. Beverages are available from vending machines. The trains were also fitted with two wheelchair lifts and a wheelchair accessible toilet.|$|E
5|$|Not all {{elements}} of the battalion suffered similar problems, however; on the same day, 9 January, B Company destroyed eleven German tanks advancing on the village of Rittershoffen, with four more the next day, while <b>another</b> <b>section</b> working with the 813th Tank Destroyer Battalion in Hatten nearby accounted for nine. These units remained with the infantry in the village for several days, unable to withdraw, and acquitted themselves well in close fighting. This {{was all the more}} of an achievement when it was considered that, leaving disciplinary problems aside, the battalion suffered from major training deficiencies and was entirely combat inexperienced. One member of the battalion was awarded the Silver Star, while the 79th Division recommended a crew which had fought in Hatten to receive Bronze Stars—it is unclear if these were ever awarded.|$|E
5|$|On March 3, in {{an effort}} to defuse the racial {{tensions}} caused by the sit-ins, Mayor West announced the formation of a Biracial Committee to seek a solution to the city's racial strife. The committee included the presidents of two of the city's black universities, but did not include any representatives from the student movement. The committee met several times over the next month and delivered its recommendations in a report on April 5. The committee recommended to partially integrate the city's lunch counters. Each store would have one section that was for whites only and <b>another</b> <b>section</b> for whites and blacks. This solution was rejected by the student leaders, who considered the recommendations to be morally unacceptable and based upon a policy of segregation. Less than a week after the Biracial Committee issued its report, the sit-ins resumed and the boycott of downtown businesses was intensified.|$|E
