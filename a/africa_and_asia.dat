5|$|Like all New World {{vultures}}, {{it is not}} {{closely related}} to the Old World vultures of Europe, <b>Africa,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Asia.</b> The two groups strongly resemble each other because of convergent evolution; natural selection often leads to similar body plans in animals that adapt independently to the same conditions.|$|E

5|$|Once safely {{established}} on Madagascar, with its limited mammalian population, the lemurs were {{protected from the}} increasing competition from evolving arboreal mammalian groups. Monkeys had evolved by the Oligocene, and their intelligence, aggression, and deceptiveness may have given them the advantage in exploiting the environment over the diurnal adapiform primates in <b>Africa</b> <b>and</b> <b>Asia,</b> ultimately driving them to extinction and leaving only the nocturnal lorisoids.|$|E
5|$|Percy Powell-Cotton {{was born}} in 1866, and was a Major in the Northumberland Fusiliers. His expeditions were {{conducted}} for scientific research, and would sometimes take 18 months.

5|$|The {{blackcap}} has a {{very large}} range, and its population in Europe is estimated at 25–49million breeding pairs.

DuBois made several trips to Europe, <b>Africa</b> <b>and</b> <b>Asia.</b> After World War I, he surveyed the experiences of American black soldiers in France and documented widespread prejudice in the United States military.|$|E

5|$|The bee-eaters are a {{group of}} near-passerine birds in the family Meropidae {{containing}} three genera and 27 species. Most species are found in <b>Africa</b> <b>and</b> <b>Asia,</b> with a few in southern Europe, Australia, and New Guinea. They are characterised by richly coloured plumage, slender bodies, and usually elongated central tail feathers. All have long down-turned bills and medium to long wings, which may be pointed or round. Male and female plumages are usually similar.|$|E

5|$|A mermaid is {{a legendary}} aquatic {{creature}} {{with the head}} and upper body of a female human and {{the tail of a}} fish. Mermaids appear in the folklore of many cultures worldwide, including the Near East, Europe, <b>Africa</b> <b>and</b> <b>Asia.</b> The first stories appeared in ancient Assyria, in which the goddess Atargatis transformed herself into a mermaid out of shame for accidentally killing her human lover. Mermaids are sometimes associated with perilous events such as floods, storms, shipwrecks and drownings. In other folk traditions (or sometimes within the same tradition), they can be benevolent or beneficent, bestowing boons or falling in love with humans.|$|E
5|$|During the summer, {{the black}} stork is found from Eastern Asia (Siberia and {{northern}} China) west to Central Europe, reaching Estonia in the north, Poland, Lower Saxony and Bavaria in Germany, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Italy and Greece in the south, with an outlying {{population in the}} central-southwest region of the Iberian Peninsula (Extremadura and surrounding provinces of Spain, plus Portugal). It is migratory, wintering in tropical <b>Africa</b> <b>and</b> <b>Asia,</b> although certain populations of black storks are sedentary or dispersive. An isolated population exists in Southern Africa, where the species is more numerous in the east, in eastern South Africa and Mozambique, and {{is also found in}} Zimbabwe, Swaziland, Botswana and less commonly Namibia.|$|E
5|$|In the {{developed}} world Campylobacter jejuni is {{the primary cause of}} bacterial gastroenteritis, with half of these cases associated with exposure to poultry. In children, bacteria are the cause in about 15% of cases, with the most common types being Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Shigella, and Campylobacter species. If food becomes contaminated with bacteria and remains at room temperature for a period of several hours, the bacteria multiply and increase the risk of infection in those who consume the food. Some foods commonly associated with illness include raw or undercooked meat, poultry, seafood, and eggs; raw sprouts; unpasteurized milk and soft cheeses; and fruit and vegetable juices. In the developing world, especially sub-Saharan <b>Africa</b> <b>and</b> <b>Asia,</b> cholera is a common cause of gastroenteritis. This infection is usually transmitted by contaminated water or food.|$|E
