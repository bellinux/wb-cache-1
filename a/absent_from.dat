Their revenues were assigned {{to pay for his}} studies, leaving poorly paid vicars to carry out the pastoral work.

5|$|Mayflies are {{distributed}} {{all over the}} world in clean freshwater habitats, though <b>absent</b> <b>from</b> Antarctica. They tend to be <b>absent</b> <b>from</b> oceanic islands or represented by one or two species that have dispersed from nearby mainland. Female mayflies may be dispersed by wind, and eggs may be transferred by adhesion to the legs of waterbirds. The greatest generic diversity is found in the Neotropic ecozone, while the Holarctic has a smaller number of genera but a high degree of speciation. Some thirteen families are restricted to a single bioregion. The main families have some general habitat preferences: the Baetidae favour warm water; the Heptageniidae live under stones and prefer fast-flowing water; and the relatively large Ephemeridae make burrows in sandy lake or river beds.|$|E

5|$|Most of the Sinhalese {{letters are}} curlicues; {{straight}} lines are almost completely <b>absent</b> <b>from</b> the alphabet. This is because Sinhala {{used to be}} written on dried palm leaves, which would split along the veins on writing straight lines. This was undesirable, and therefore, the round shapes were preferred.|$|E
5|$|Notably <b>absent</b> <b>from</b> the 2007 {{study were}} Belarus, Iceland, many African nations, Mongolia, North Korea, and Afghanistan.

5|$|Searls' novelization {{presents}} a continuity that combines elements from Peter Benchley's Jaws novel {{as well as}} the Jaws film series.

5|$|Shepseskare is {{completely}} <b>absent</b> <b>from</b> another king list {{dating to the}} same period: the Abydos king list, written {{during the reign of}} Seti I (1294–1279 BC). He is also <b>absent</b> <b>from</b> the Turin canon (reign of Ramses II), although in this case a lacuna affects the papyrus on which the list is written at the place where Shepseskare and Neferefre's names should have been. Of the two entries concerning Shepseskare and Neferefre on the king list, only one reign length is still legible and it has been variously read as one year, eleven years or one to four months. The damaged state of the papyrus also makes it impossible to decide safely whose reign length this is.|$|E

5|$|The {{range of}} this species is quite restricted, it being {{confined}} to thorn acacia country in southern Ethiopia near Yavello (Javello), Mega, and Arero.
