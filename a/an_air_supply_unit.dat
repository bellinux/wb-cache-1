40|$|Electro-pneumatic (EP) {{components}} are frequently used in brake systems of commercial vehicles. The simulation of EP brake systems {{is of great}} importance {{in order to understand}} their dynamics for developing a control logic being robust but fulfilling the modern functional demands. On the other hand, the simulation aids the design of EP components being able to execute the commands of a precision control. The paper presents a flexible computational simulation tool being applied in industrial research and development related to complex mechatronics in brake systems for commercial vehicles. The Electric Braking System (EBS) case study presented herein comprises <b>an</b> <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> <b>unit,</b> an EBS modulator, piping, a diaphragm brake chamber, and the connected brake mechanism. The simulation environment is AMESim ® 3. 0. Considering the complexity of the EP components and the related phenomena, special models have been elaborated for the solenoid valves, piping, and the diaphragm brake chamber. The simulation results show good agreement with measurement data. The comparative numerical and experimental study confirmed that the simulation tool can be effectively used in design, research and development of EP brake systems...|$|E

40|$|Online {{detection}} of {{volatile organic compounds}} is still a difficult topic, many tradeoffs have to be accepted regarding the selectivity, sensitivity and the suitability to analyze complex mixtures of volatile organic compounds (VOC), especially when portable systems are required. To analyze the emission of VOC from freshly produced surfaces an emission test cell with online detector was developed. The system consists of <b>a</b> mobile <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> <b>unit</b> to provide mass-flow-controlled, humidified inlet <b>air,</b> <b>a</b> surface test cell with laminar flow over the surface and a detector unit. To achieve a selective {{detection of}} a wide range of volatile organic compounds, a miniaturized ion mobility spectrometer with a multi-capillary column was utilized as online detector. Selected compounds could be measured with detection limits down to 10 mu g/m(3), but the limited resolution qualifies the system more for applications like production control, where VOC concentrations above 300 - 500 mu g/m(3) are to be expected...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPneumatic {{system is}} {{normally}} used {{to trigger the}} automatic spray gun for conventional spray operations. Highly skilled labors {{and a number of}} adjustable knobs are required to produce the high quality coating works using the conventional au-tomatic spray gun which is cost intensive. Therefore, linear motor operated multiple spray operations spray gun has been developed. This spray gun consists of two spray <b>units,</b> <b>an</b> <b>air</b> control and <b>supply</b> <b>unit</b> and a triggering unit to carry out the multiple spray operations. This paper focuses on the design optimization and fabrication of the housing of the spray units which hold fluid nozzles, <b>air</b> nozzles, <b>an</b> assembly cap, a needle valve or a ball valve. In the air less and air assisted airless spray systems, high pressurized liquid is passed through the nozzle which is held by the housing of the spray unit. Before entering into the nozzle, the high pressurized liquid is passed through the housing. For the simplicity of the analysis, it is assumed that the housing is an open-ended pressure vessel. From the analysis, dimensions and material selection have been optimized and finally the spray units have been fabricated and tested. During the performance test it is seen that satisfactory transfer efficiency of spray operation has been achieved by using newly developed spray housing of the spray units, which proves the stability of the spray housing during high pressure operation...|$|R
