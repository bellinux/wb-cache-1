25|$|Response to {{infection}} by Leishmania donovani varies a great deal, {{not only by}} the strength but also by the type of the patient's immune reaction. People with a history of infection by strains of leishmania that cause visceral leishmaniasis show a continuum of immune responses from protective to non-protective. Those who acquired protective immunity (skin test positive) without ever having visceral leishmaniasis have a strong type 1 CD4+ response to leishmania antigens. Antigen specific interferon-gamma and proliferation, as well as the ability to kill intracellular leishmania, are hallmarks of protective immunity. Because visceral leishmaniasis patients lack these responses to leishmania and other antigens, they usually die of secondary infections if left untreated. In addition, increased interleukin-10 secretion is characteristic of the disease. Addition of interleukin-12, anti-interleukin-10, or anti-interleukin-4 to peripheral blood mononuclear cells from acute patients sometimes increases interferon-gamma secretion and proliferation. <b>Acute</b> <b>patient</b> peripheral blood mononuclear cells include CD8+ T regulatory cells that decrease interferon-gamma secretion and proliferation responses to leishmania and other antigens and increase interleukin-10 secretion when added to autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells harvested after successful treatment. Thus, the CD8+ T regulatory cells reproduce the immune response characteristic of visceral leishmaniasis. CD8+ T regulatory cells are also associated with post kala azar dermal leishmaniasis. Addition of interleukin-12 or interferon-gamma does not prevent CD8+ T regulatory activity. The dominance of type 1 CD4+ T cells in skin test positive adults maybe explained by their secretion of factors that inhibit and kill CD8+ T regulatory cells. Successfully treated patients rarely develop visceral leishmaniasis a second time. Their peripheral blood mononuclear cells show a mixed T1/T2 CD4+ and CD8+ T suppressor response but do have the ability to kill intracellular leishmania.|$|E

40|$|It is {{paradoxical}} {{that most}} {{studies that have}} examined the efficacy of aphasia rehabilitation have involved patients with stable, chronic aphasia, while most clinicians treat patients whose aphasia is of much shorter duration and often more dynamic. Extending the results of treatment efficacy studies with chronic <b>patients</b> to <b>acute</b> <b>patients</b> requires that two essential presumptions be made: (1) a method that works with chronic patients will in fact work with acute patients; (2) the method is equally appropriate for both chronic and <b>acute</b> <b>patients.</b> These presumptions and problems that may arise when assessing treatment efficacy in acutely aphasic patients are discussed. Principles that may guide future studies are enumerated...|$|R
40|$|Increased {{understanding}} of immune responses influencing clinical severity during pandemic influenza infection {{is important for}} improved treatment and vaccine development. In this study we recruited 46 adult patients during the 2009 influenza pandemic and characterized humoral and cellular immune responses. Those included were either acute hospitalized or convalescent patients with different disease severities (mild, moderate or severe). In general, protective antibody responses increased with enhanced disease severity. In the <b>acute</b> <b>patients,</b> we found higher levels of TNF-α single-producing CD 4 +T-cells in the severely ill as {{compared to patients with}} moderate disease. Stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from a subset of <b>acute</b> <b>patients</b> with peptide T-cell epitopes showed significantly lower frequencies of influenza specific CD 8 + compared with CD 4 + IFN-γ T-cells in <b>acute</b> <b>patients.</b> Both T-cell subsets were predominantly directed against the envelope antigens (HA and NA). However, in the convalescent patients we found high levels of both CD 4 + and CD 8 + T-cells directed against conserved core antigens (NP, PA, PB, and M). The results indicate that the antigen targets recognized by the T-cell subsets may vary according to the phase of infection. The apparent low levels of cross-reactive CD 8 + T-cells cells recognizing internal antigens in <b>acute</b> hospitalized <b>patients</b> suggest an important role for this T-cell subset in protective immunity against influenza. ...|$|R
40|$|To {{improve the}} current {{knowledge}} on {{the involvement of}} peripheral lymphocytes in hepatitis E virus (HEV) associated pathogenesis, we analyzed alterations in (1) immunophenotypic expressions (by flow cytometry) and (2) gene expression patterns (by TaqMan Low Density Array) of activatory, inhibitory, integrin, homing, ectonucleotidase machinery, costimulatory, inflammatory markers, and T regulatory cells (Treg) associated cytokines on HEV rORF 2 p stimulated and unstimulated PBMCs of 43 <b>acute</b> HEV <b>patients,</b> 30 recovered individuals, and 43 controls. The phenotypic expressions of key molecules CTLA- 4, GITR, CD 103, CD 25, CD 69, IL 10 and TGF-β 1 in the <b>acute</b> <b>patients</b> and TGF-β 1 in the recovered individuals were significantly elevated on both unstimulated and stimulated PBMCs.

5000|$|The term {{hospital}}ist {{was first}} coined by Robert Wachter and Lee Goldman in a 1996 New England Journal of Medicine article. [...] The scope of hospital medicine includes <b>acute</b> <b>patient</b> care, teaching, research, and executive leadership {{related to the}} delivery of hospital-based care. Hospital medicine, like emergency medicine, is a specialty organized around a site of care (the hospital), rather than an organ (like cardiology), a disease (like oncology), or a patient’s age (like pediatrics). The emergence of hospital medicine has both similarities with and differences from acute medicine in the United Kingdom, reflecting health system differences.|$|E
5000|$|Emergency {{physicians}} are compensated {{at a higher}} rate in comparison to some other specialities, ranking 10th out of 26 physician specialties in 2015, at an average salary of $306,000 annually. [...] They are compensated in the mid-range (averaging $13,000 annually) for non-patient activities, such as speaking engagements or acting as an expert witness; they also saw a 12% increase in salary from 2014 - 2015 (which was not out of line with many other physician specialties that year). While emergency physicians work 8-12 hour shifts and do not tend to work on-call, the high level of stress and need for strong diagnostic and triage capabilities for the undifferentiated, <b>acute</b> <b>patient</b> contributes to arguments justifying higher salaries for these physicians. Emergency care must be available every hour of every day, and requires a doctor to be available on site 24/7, unlike an outpatient clinic or some other hospital departments that have more limited hours, and may only call a physician in when needed. The necessity to have a physician on staff along with all other diagnostic services available every hour of every day is thus a costly arrangement for hospitals.|$|E

40|$|Diagnosis {{of acute}} {{myocardial}} infarction (AMI) is based on clinical symptoms of chest pain and dyspnea in combination with electrocardiographic changes and a raise in myocardial-specific biomarkers.

40|$|Purpose – This study aims {{to explore}} the {{involvement}} of middle management in forming strategies tomanage variable <b>acute</b> <b>patient</b> flows at a hospital. Design/methodology/approach – Empirical evidence from a university hospital was gathered viainterviews, internal documents, observation and participation in meetings. The role of middle management inthe development of strategies was analyzed using literature on middle management involvement. Findings – In managing variable <b>acute</b> <b>patient</b> flows, middle management adopts a number of roles andbehavioral characteristics that have been previously described in research. The role of facilitator is the mostprominent, with middle managers prioritizing individual goals and strategies for the clinical departments thatthey manage before their collective responsibility for hospital performance. Unclear responsibilities andmandates within the organization, together {{with a lack of}} hospital-wide strategies concerning how the acutepatient flow should bemanaged, are contributing factors to this behavior. Research limitations/implications – The research is based on an explorative, single case studymethodology. Future research assessing the extent of different middle management roles in health care, inwhich more empirical data and quantitative analysis is conducted, is encouraged. Practical implications – There is a need for top management to establish long-term goals to enhancemiddle management roles when developing strategies for managing variable patient flows. Originality/value – Middle management involvement in developing strategies for managing variablepatient flows is a novel topic for research. The interface and division of tasks between top and middlemanagement is crucial for successful strategies in managing variable patient flows...|$|E
40|$|As the HIV {{epidemic}} {{has evolved}} {{to become a}} chronic, treatable condition the focus of HIV care has shifted from the inpatient to the outpatient arena. The optimal structure of HIV care in the outpatient setting is unknown. Using the HIV Research Network (HIVRN), a federally sponsored consortium of 21 sites that provide care to HIV-infected individuals, this study attempted to: (1) document key features {{of the organization of}} care in HIVRN adult clinics and (2) estimate variability among clinics in these parameters. A cross-sectional survey of adult clinic directors regarding patient volume, follow-up care, provider characteristics, <b>acute</b> <b>patient</b> care issues, wait times, patient safety procedures, and prophylaxis practices was conducted from July to December 2007. All 15 adult HIVRN clinic sites responded: 9 academic and 6 community-based. The results demonstrate variability in key practice parameters.
