5|$|By mid-morning, Hotze's {{advanced}} guard had encountered moderate French resistance first from Roget's brigade, and then, almost immediately, from Gazan's. The Austrian advance troops quickly overran Gazan's weak brigade and took {{possession of the}} woods surrounding the village of Islikon. After securing the villages of Gundeschwil, Schottikon, Wiesendangen, and Stogen, further west of Islikon, Hotze deployed two of his columns facing the French front, while a third <b>angled</b> <b>to</b> the French right, as Ney had expected he would.|$|E
5|$|Yorks {{design was}} based on the earlier County classes but was {{intended}} to be smaller and cheaper, although better armoured. She was easily distinguishable from her sister ship, , as the latter had straight masts and funnels, while those of York were <b>angled</b> <b>to</b> the rear. In addition, York also had a very tall bridge designed to clear the aircraft catapult originally planned to be carried on the superfiring ('B') gun turret forward.|$|E
5|$|Ark Royal {{had entered}} refit to {{accommodate}} the Phantom in 1967; this involved a major reconstruction, including several elements to allow the ship to operate the aircraft – the flight deck was increased in area and fully <b>angled</b> <b>to</b> 8½°, the arresting gear was replaced with a new water-spray system {{to accommodate the}} Phantom's higher weight and landing speed, and bridle catchers and water-cooled JBDs were fitted to the catapults. Once this work was complete, Eagle was scheduled to undergo a similar modernization. In 1969, the planned refit of Eagle was cancelled, and the options for seven additional FG.1s was not taken up. As a consequence, {{it was decided to}} further reduce the FAA's Phantom fleet to just 28 aircraft. The remaining 20 aircraft were then allocated to the Royal Air Force.|$|E
50|$|In {{the fourth}} match, Kurt Angle faced Chris Benoit in a 30-minute Ultimate Submission match. <b>Angle</b> forced Benoit <b>to</b> {{submit to a}} Leglock to make the score 1-0.

5|$|Hilde {{appears as}} a slender woman with long, red hair. Her primary {{appearance}} encases her fully in form-fitting body armor, with red and black fabric underneath. A wolf's head, the character's family symbol, extends from the right pauldron and covers her helmet's visor, while the left pauldron is covered by red fabric, fastened {{to the center of}} her breastplate's collar underneath a large brooch. Beneath the armor, a red coat covers her torso, the tail of which extends past her waist. Her alternate character design consists of a long, blue dress, extending to her feet and neck, exposing her shoulders and angled towards her right leg. White gloves, shoes, and stockings cover her arms and legs, while a darker colored sash surrounds her waist and midsection, also <b>angled</b> <b>to</b> the right.|$|E
5|$|While {{the border}} on land was firmly {{set in the}} early 20th century, the two states were still in {{disagreement}} {{on the path of}} the border to the east, in Lake Erie. In 1973, the two states finally obtained a hearing before the United States Supreme Court on their competing claims to the Lake Erie waters. In Michigan v. Ohio, the court upheld a special master's report and ruled that the boundary between the two states in Lake Erie was <b>angled</b> <b>to</b> the northeast, as described in Ohio's state constitution, and not a straight east–west line. One consequence of the court decision was that tiny Turtle Island just outside Maumee Bay and originally treated as being wholly in Michigan, was split between the two states.|$|E
25|$|Some gate-towers {{were also}} open-backed. A {{good example is}} the Böhmertor at Freistadt in Upper Austria. Here three levels of gun embrasures or {{openings}} can be seen, with those at the corner <b>angled</b> <b>to</b> cover the moat. The vertical slits for the drawbridge over the moat can also be seen.|$|E

25|$|A {{step drill}} bit is a drill bit {{that has the}} tip ground down to a {{different}} diameter. The transition between this ground diameter and the original diameter is either straight, to form a counterbore, or <b>angled,</b> <b>to</b> form a countersink. The advantage to this style is that both diameters have the same flute characteristics, which keeps the bit from clogging when drilling in softer materials, such as aluminum; in contrast, a drill bit with a slip-on collar {{does not have the}} same benefit. Most of these bits are custom-made for each application, which makes them more expensive.|$|E
25|$|Designed by Air New Zealand in {{consultation}} with US design studio IDEO, the new Premium Economy cabin uses a 2-2-2 seating configuration. The central pair of Spaceseats are slightly angled for those travelling with a colleague or partner, and the two arm rests can form a single table for shared in-flight dining. The pairs of outboard Spaceseats on either side are <b>angled</b> <b>to</b> enhance privacy for solo flyers. The seats are built around a hard shell so the passenger in front cannot recline into {{the space of the}} person sitting behind. Instead, the seat slides forward and angles up as it reclines into the shell, similar to an armchair.|$|E

25|$|The process uses a {{milling cutter}} with a {{cross-section}} that is slightly smaller than the final cross-section of the cut; {{it has the same}} diameter as the worm. The cutter is then <b>angled</b> <b>to</b> the gashing angle. The gashing angle is calculated from the lead and pitch diameter of the worm; often tables are available with the gashing angles for common diameters and leads. The cutter is centered over the blank and then plunged into it to the proper depth. The cutter is finally withdrawn and the blank indexed to the next tooth space and cut. This is repeated until all of the tooth spaces have been cut.|$|E

A day later, Hotze's force united with the main Austrian force of Archduke Charles.|$|E
25|$|Vertical bat or straight-bat shots can {{be played}} off either the front foot or the back foot {{depending}} upon the anticipated height of the ball at the moment it reaches the batsman. The characteristic position of the bat is a vertical alignment at point of contact. Vertical bat shots are typically played with the batsman's head directly above the point of contact so that {{he is able to}} accurately judge the line of the ball. At this point the bat can either be stationary and facing straight back down the wicket – known as a block or defensive shot; <b>angled</b> <b>to</b> one side – known as a glance or deflection; or travelling forwards towards the bowler – known as a drive.|$|E

25|$|While the Hawker Fury offered better performance, lower {{production}} volumes {{made it more}} expensive and therefore it remained available only in small numbers, so when a fighter version of the Hart was suggested, the Air Ministry selected the type as an interim fighter until higher-performance fighters could be bought in larger numbers. The new fighter variant added a second Vickers machine gun, while the coaming of the rear cockpit was <b>angled</b> <b>to</b> give a better field of fire, and a supercharged Kestrel IS engine was fitted. Evaluation of an initial batch of six aircraft, known as Hart Fighters by one flight of 23 Squadron during 1931 was successful, and larger orders followed for the fighter Hart, {{now known as the}} Hawker Demon. The Demon's first flight was on 10 February 1933.|$|E
25|$|Nor did the PAVN action end {{coincide}} with Operation Thao La's finish. Even as a purported 1,000 PAVN troops bombarded forward positions at Paksong with mortar fire, making them difficult to reinforce and resupply, they also <b>angled</b> <b>to</b> cut Route 23 to entrap the Royalists. There was little retaliatory air power available; most tactical air power {{was being used}} against Salavan or on the Plain of Jars. On the evening of 18 December, headlights were spotted outside Paksong. On the 19th, tank tread marks were spotted 14 kilometers north of town; at least three tanks were suspected. By 24 December, PAVN troops were spotted on Route 23 between Paksong and the Royalist home base of Pakse. During the next two days, a number of PAVN heavy machine guns moved in on Paksong, complicating Royalist-backed aerial traffic. The bombardment of the town's northern defenses increased.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the nose}} high {{attitude}} on the ground, propeller powered taildraggers are more {{adversely affected by}} P-factor – asymmetrical thrust caused by the propeller's disk being <b>angled</b> <b>to</b> the direction of travel, which causes the blades to produce more lift when going down than when going up due to the difference in angle the blade experiences when passing through the air. The aircraft will then pull {{to the side of}} the upward blade. Some aircraft lack sufficient rudder authority in some flight regimes (particularly at higher power settings on takeoff) and the pilot must compensate before the aircraft starts to yaw. Some aircraft, particularly older, higher powered aircraft such as the P-51 Mustang, cannot use full power on takeoff and still safely control their direction of travel. On landing this is less of a factor, however opening the throttle to abort a landing can induce severe uncontrollable yaw unless the pilot is prepared for it.|$|E

25|$|Firing {{continued}} {{around the}} Carter house and gardens for hours. Many in Brown's division were driven {{back to the}} Federal earthworks, where many were pinned down {{for the remainder of}} the evening, unable to either advance or flee. Each side fired through embrasures or over the top of the parapets at close range in an attempt to dislodge the other. Brown's division suffered significant losses, including Brown, who was wounded, and all four of his brigade commanders were casualties. Brown's brigade under Brig. Gen. George W. Gordon had <b>angled</b> <b>to</b> the right during the advance, joining Cleburne's division to the east of the pike. Their attack near the cotton gin was driven back from the breastworks and was then subjected to devastating cross fire from Reilly's brigade to their front and the brigade of Col. John S. Casement, on Reilly's right. Cleburne was killed in the attack and 14 of his brigade and regimental commanders were casualties.|$|E
25|$|Lagrange's {{division}} <b>angled</b> <b>to</b> {{the left}} toward Bannay, {{led by the}} 2nd Light Infantry Regiment and a marine battalion, while Ricard's division marched straight toward Baye. Olsufiev sent Evstafi Evstafievich Udom with two jäger infantry battalions to clear the French skirmishers out of Baye. As the French pressure increased, Udom was reinforced so {{that he had the}} 10th, 12th, 22nd and 38th Jäger Regiments and six guns. Around 11:00 am Ricard pressed Udom's troops back into Baye and the nearby woods. Olsufiev sent a brigade and six guns to hold the right flank while the bulk of his corps deployed between Baye and Bannay. The French brought 12 guns into action as more and more of their soldiers passed the bridge and arrived on the field. Pierre Pelleport's brigade led Lagrange's division as it assaulted Bannay. At 1:00 pm Olsufiev was still holding out on his forward position. At that hour, the Russian commander held a council of war in which his generals voted for a retreat to Étoges. Olsufiev refused, saying that he had specific orders to hold Champaubert.|$|E
25|$|Lighting {{designer}} Al Gurdon {{worked with}} Stufish and Tait Towers {{for the light}} setup, which was handled by PRG Group. The three main video screens were <b>angled</b> <b>to</b> give the side audience a better angle of vision. A Hippotizer V3 media server was used for content playback and operated by PRG Nocturne's Will Stinson, and five cameras were manned for this show. PRG used their newly invented GroundControl followspot devices which were attached as truss {{to the top of}} the screens, using Clay Paky Stormy Strobes. Fitted with high-definition cameras, they could be operated from backstage, who could simply use the cameras and direct the lights to illumate specific areas as required, without having to have knowledge about the physical stage. Console director Joshua Hutchings controlled their color, beams and shutters. Advantage of the followspot was to allow the lightning personnel to operate from a comfortable environment, rather than to climb on heights atop the stage. Hutchings explained the whole show was time-coded, going inline with the choreography.|$|E
