40|$|Graduation date: 1976 In {{previous}} research in Europe, <b>asulam</b> (methyl sulfanilylcarbamate) {{was found to}} be a potentially useful herbicide for controlling broadleaf dock Rumex obtusifolius L.) in permanent pastures. <b>Asulam</b> was also reported to have a low margin of safety when used on common pasture species. Field studies were conducted in western Oregon to examine broadleaf dock control obtained at <b>asulam</b> rates that would not reduce pasture yield and to determine the optimum time of <b>asulam</b> application for dock control. Field, greenhouse, and laboratory studies were conducted to determine the tolerance of perennial ryegrass, tall fescue, orchardgrass, bentgrass, white clover, and subclover to <b>asulam</b> and to examine a possible change in protein content of grass forage after <b>asulam</b> application. Control of broadleaf dock was studied at three rates and four application times of <b>asulam.</b> <b>Asulam</b> was applied at 1. 0, 1. 5, and 2. 0 lb/A in April, May, June, and July. Results from early applications were superior to later applications of <b>asulam.</b> The April treatments were applied to dormant or slowly growing dock in the crown period. Control was good at all rates. The May treatments were made to actively growing dock late in the crown period or early in the rising period. Season-long control was good, but control of regrowth was not acceptable, particularly at the lower rates. June and July <b>asulam</b> treatments gave poor control of broadleaf dock at all rates. Pasture species differed in tolerance to <b>asulam.</b> Perennial ryegrass was the most tolerant grass and white clover was the most tolerant legume examined. Perennial ryegrass, tall fescue, orchardgrass, and white clover showed adequate tolerance to <b>asulam,</b> especially at the 1. 0 and 2. 0 lb/A rates. These species suffered slight yield decreases at 4. 0 lb of asulam/A. Bentgrass and subclover were less tolerant to <b>asulam.</b> These species suffered more severe injury and yield reduction at all rates of <b>asulam</b> than did the other species. Field studies also showed that clipping affected pasture grass tolerance to <b>asulam.</b> The effect of clipping was greatest in grass species that were most tolerant to <b>asulam</b> treatment. Clipping before <b>asulam</b> application increased injury to the sward. Injury increased as the period between clipping and treatment decreased. Clipping after <b>asulam</b> application reduced injury to the sward and increased speed of recovery. Laboratory experiments were conducted to determine the effect of <b>asulam</b> on the crude protein of tall fescue. <b>Asulam</b> caused a temporary reduction in the rate of crude protein loss. This coincided with a temporary growth delay observed in tall fescue after treatment. <b>Asulam</b> did not reduce the crude protein content of tall fescue at any harvest dates examined. <b>Asulam</b> can successfully control broadleaf dock in western Oregon pastures when applied at 1. 0 to 2. 0 lb/A in early spring with little or no damage to swards containing a large percentage of tolerant pasture species. Swards containing a large percentage of bentgrass and subclover should not be treated with <b>asulam</b> unless serious yield reductions can be accepted...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} principally an {{investigation}} on behavioural aspects of bracken control herbicides in some plant and soil systems {{with a view}} to improving their effectiveness. The main chemicals investigated were <b>asulam</b> and aminotriazole. As the work developed broader aspects were studied, including the behaviour of iodide and thiocyanate in plants. The work can be sub-divided as follows:- 1. A brief discussion of bracken and its control was made with some emphasis being placed on its control by systemic herbicides and possible approaches to improving their efficiency. 2. An investigation into the mechanism of action of <b>asulam</b> in plants. The findings can be summarized as follows:- Preliminary work involving lAA-oxidase assays and plant growth studies revealed an interesting interaction between e-aminobenzoic acid and <b>asulam</b> which indicated sulphonamide-type activity for <b>asulam.</b> A series of experiments were carried out whereby a range of species sown in beakers containing vermiculite were treated with <b>asulam</b> solutions. This resulted principally in stunting of the root system which could be partially or totally overcome by the simultaneous addition of either e-aminobenzoic acid or folic acid. Compounds related to e-aminobenzoic acid had no such activity, indicating the specificity of the antagonism. The results led to the conclusion that a possible mechanism of action of <b>asulam</b> is the inhibition of folic acid synthesis resulting in impairment of biological methylations and hence inhibition of protein and nucleic acid synthesis. The selectivity of <b>asulam</b> may be due to differential e-aminobenzoate or folate concentrations. 3. An investigation into the possibility of achieving pre-emergence activity for <b>asulam</b> in bracken control. as follows:- An appraisal of <b>asulam</b> soil behaviour was made, whereupon it The results can be summarized was considered that the use of additives would probably be required to regulate movement and prolong persistence for sufficient quantities to achieve contact with the rhizome buds. <b>Asulam</b> adsorption experiments, carried out using surfactant solutions and three acid-organic soils found under bracken, revealed that, on the whole, the anionic surfactants employed (sodium dodecyl sulphate and sodium dodecylbenzene sulphonate) significantly reduced <b>asulam</b> adsorption, whilst cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (cationic surfactant) significantly increased adsorption. These trends were reflected in leaching experiments using a thick layer soil plate method.

It is also concluded that the frond cannot {{be used as an}} indicator of the rhizome system before or after treatment to achieve bracken control. An improved sampling strategy is proposed which increases the reliability of data collected and the validity of any conclusions drawn form such data. The structure of bracken rhizome systems, from separate stands on the North York Moors, were found to be distinct from one another and demonstrated intrinsic variation which could affect a differential response to control. The most important components of the rhizome system, when considering chemical control using <b>asulam</b> are: the number of buds likely to remain viable afterwards; the rhizome biomass which may effect herbicide dilution; and the origin of frond production which may affect herbicide distribution. The effect of <b>asulam</b> was to cause severe localised damage to buds and apices detectable one year after treatment but the rhizome dry weight remained unaffected. In one instance <b>asulam</b> appeared to have a stimulatory effect on bracken by breaking bud dormancy, this was related to the characteristics of the stand before treatment. It is recommended that the use of <b>asulam</b> is restricted to pioneer or building stands which have a high number of active buds in relation to dormant buds, and a low rhizome dry weight. Crushing bracken once a year effected a temporary reduction in rhizome dry weight, and an increase in frond number (which could improve <b>asulam</b> absorption). A combination of crushing and <b>asulam</b> reduced both bud number and rhizome dry weight and was thus the most successful treatment studied for reduction of bracken vigour. In particular, stands adjacent to valued plant communities should be targeted for control. It is suggested that bilberry {{could be used as a}} buffer zone between heather and invading bracken. The use of large-scale bracken control programmes in upland regions was questioned due to the apparent ineffectiveness of <b>asulam</b> on the rhizome system, and the difficulty of implementing a programme of successful follow-up and after-care management.

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Asulam</b> (p-aminobenzenesulphonylmethylcarbamate) is adsorbed by {{alkaline}} and alkaline-earth cation saturated montmorillonites at {{room temperature}} either by protonation or by physical forces. On heating itdecomposes to different products depending on the polarizing power of the exchange cation. On Mg-clay, sulphanilic and carbamic acid are obtained; the latter decomposes after equilibration at 100 ~ relative humidity. In Ba- and Ca-systems, sulphanilamide and sulphanilic acid are produced with minor amounts of p-aminobenzenesulphonylcarbamate anion.

Here we consider the effects of management-induced changes to plant communities and their soils during restoration within a 20 -year manipulative experiment where the aim was to change a late-successional community dominated by the weed, Pteridium aquilinum, to an earlier-successional grass-heath one. The ecological restoration treatments altered the above- and below-ground components of the community substantially. Untreated plots maintained a dense Pteridium cover with little understory vegetation, cutting treatments produce significant reductions of Pteridium, whereas herbicide (<b>asulam)</b> produced significant immediate reductions in Pteridium but regressed towards the untreated plots within 10 years. Thereafter, all asulam-treated plots were re-treated in year 11, and then were spot-sprayed annually. Both cutting and <b>asulam</b> treatments reduced frond density to almost zero and resulted in a grass-heath vegetation. There was also a massive change in biomass distribution, untreated plots had a large above-ground biomass/necromass that was much reduced where Pteridium was controlled. Below-ground in treated plots, there was a replacement of the substantive Pteridium rhizome mass with a much greater root mass of other species. The combined effects of Pteridium-control and restoration treatment, reduced soil total C and N as and available P concentrations, but increased soil pH and available N.

Concentrations of each pesticide were equal to 0 %, 0. 2 %, 0. 5 %, 2 %, and 5 % spray drift emission of label-recommended rates. Contribution of compounds to the toxicity of the pesticide package was established by expressing their concentrations as fractions of toxic units. The fate of the compounds in the water, and responses of phytoplankton, zooplankton, periphyton, macroinvertebrates, macrophytes, decomposition, and water quality were followed for 13 weeks. The half-lives of lambda-cyhalothrin, metamitron, and fluazinam were 1 to 2 d; that of <b>asulam</b> was > 30 d. No consistent effects could be demonstrated for the 0. 2 % treatment regime that was therefore considered the no-observed-effect concentrationcommunity (NOEC). The macroinvertebrate populations of Gammarus pulex, Asellus aquaticus, and Proasellus meridianus were the most sensitive end points, followed by species of copepods and cladocerans.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{adsorption}} of the <b>Asulam</b> herbicide (4 -aminobenzensulphonyl-methyl-carbamate) by AI- and H-montmorillonite {{has been}} studied by IR spectroscopy, thin layer chromatography and chemical analysis. This compound isadsorbed from CC 14 solution at room temperature through protonation ofthe NH 2 functional group bythe 'acidic ' water coordinated to the interlayer cation of the clay. After heating the complex at 75 ~ for 20 h, a hydrogen-bond between the C [...] O group of the <b>Asulam</b> and the water is established and the organic molecule decomposes to sulphanilic and carbamic acids. If the complex is equilibrated at 100 ~ relative humidity, the carbamic acid becomes unstable, andthe IR spectrum shows only the bands typical of the acidic montmorillonite-sulphanilic acid complex.

A survey through the summer of 1993 of people using the North York Moors, Dartmoor and the Quantock Hills in Somerset for both work and leisure activities revealed a very high proportion of people (76 % of respondents had not heard of Lyme disease) who were unaware of the risk of Lyme disease or of how they might reduce that risk. An examination of three moorland vegetation communities as optimal tick habitats suggested that immature ticks are less dense on heather dominated communities than on either bracken or on Vaccinium dominated communities, and that this may be influenced by the fauna using heather dominated areas. Vaccinium sites showed high densities of all life stages of the sheep tick, as did bracken dominated sites. Ticks were collected throughout the winter months on South Western sites, but not on the North York Moors, emphasising the year round risk from infected ticks in the South West of the U. K. Vegetation management practices as tick control or reduction options in these moorland areas were investigated. <b>Asulam</b> spraying on bracken almost totally removed the above ground frond cover, substantially reduced live buds on the rhizome, but failed to reduce the rhizome dry weight. The density of frond cover was not affected by cutting, height and dry frond weight were reduced, live rhizome buds reduced in number and rhizome dry weight reduced. Short term control of bracken fronds was achieved by both treatments, but neither treatment provided sufficiently conclusive results on which to base long term recommendations. Comprehensive plans for after care on treated sites need to be in place before treatment is carried out. Tick densities were recorded over a two year period on these treated bracken sites. There was a proportional reduction in all tick life stages between 1993 and 1994 on sites sprayed with <b>asulam</b> and on cut sites compared with control sites. Although not statistically significant these results suggested that the methods of bracken control investigated in this study could influence sheep tick densities in the short term...|$|E
40|$|Yellow Nutsedge (Cyperus esculentus L.) {{belongs to}} the family of Cyperaceae. It propagates {{exclusively}} with tubers in the ground. Its abundance has strongly increased in Switzerland in the last two decades. Main reasons for this increase are changing land use and production systems, a difficult herbicide control and a low awareness level among the farmers. The actual invasion is enhanced by unintended dislocation of tubers by machines or crops/crop waste, lack of knowledge of infested fields and missing supporting measures. An obligation to announce infested fields and to control Yellow Nutsedge is currently discussed in Switzerland. Such an obligation would help contractors and buyers of crops to reduce unintended dislocation of tubers. Cleaning up infested plots is quickly expensive and complex. Maleic acid hydrazide is actually used for preventing potato tubers to germinate in stock. We tested Fazor (maleic acid hydrazide) and Asulox (<b>asulam)</b> for its efficacy on preventing germination of Yellow Nutsedge tubers. The results of our pot trial in the greenhouse are clear. The expected efficiency was not observed. Furthermore the complexity of problems with this species in agriculture is discussed and some ideas for a control strategy are given in this paper...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} a {{pesticide}} mixture (<b>asulam,</b> fluazinam, lambda-cyhalothrin, and metamitron) on aquatic ecosystems were investigated in 20 outdoor aquatic microcosms. Ten of the microcosms simulated mesotrophic aquatic ecosystems dominated by submerged macrophytes (Elodea). The others simulated eutrophic ecosystems with a high Lemna surface coverage (Lemna). This paper describes {{the fate of the}} chemicals as well as their effects on the growth of Myriophyllum spicatum and the periphytic algal community. In the Elodea-dominated microcosms significant increase in the biomass and alterations of species composition of the periphytic algae were observed, but no effect on M. spicatum growth could be recorded in response to the treatment. The opposite was found in the Lemna-dominated microcosms, in which decreased growth of M. spicatum was observed but no alterations could be found in the periphytic community. In the Elodea-dominated microcosms the species composition of the periphytic algae diverged from that of the control following treatment with 0. 5 % spray drift emission of the label-recommended rate (5 % for lambda-cyhalothrin), while reduced growth of M. spicatum in the Lemna-dominated microcosms was recorded at 2 % drift (20 % for lambda-cyhalothrin). This study shows that the structure of the ecosystem influences the final effect of pesticide exposure. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|A presente pesquisa foi conduzida em um Latossol Roxo, com 3, 9 % de matéria orgânica, na Usina São Carlos, município de Jaboticabal - SP com o objetivo de verificar o comportamento das principais misturas de herbicidas aplicadas em pós-emergência e suas possíveis interferências nos teores de macronutrientes, e no desenvolvimento da variedade CB 41 - 14. Os tratamentos utilizados com as respectivas doses do ingrediente ativo em kg/ha foram: ametryne + 2, 4 - D (formulação comercial) a 1, 47 - 2, 03, diuron + 2, 4 -D a 1, 60 + 2, 16; ametryne + 2, 4 -D a 1, 60 + 2, 16; {{alachlor}} + 2, 4 -D a 1, 09 + 1, 80; <b>asulam</b> + ioxynil - 2, 4 -D a 2, 80 + 1, 75; MCPA + 2, 4 -D a 0, 83 + 0, 83; oxadiazon + 2, 4 -D a 0, 50 + 2, 16; ametryne + simazine + 2, 4 -D a 1, 25 + 1, 25 + 2, 16; ametryne + secbumetone + 2, 4 -D a 2, 00 + 2, 00 + 2, 16; diuron + hexazinone + surfatante a 0, 80 + 0, 45 + 0, 5 % e MCPA + 2, 3, 6 -TBA + pendimethalin + surfatante a 1, 50 + 0, 48 + 0, 66 + 0, 5 %. O controle das plantas daninhas foi avaliado através de contagens por espécie botânica e por avaliações visuais. Sobre a cultura os efeitos foram constatados pela contagem da brotação inicial, avaliações visuais dos efeitos fitotóxicos, análise dos teores de macronutrientes aos 5 e 8 meses, medidas do comprimento dos colmos, análise dos teores de fibra, pol, brix, % de cana e pureza, assim como valores de pol/ha, e peso de colmos por hectare. Não houve interferência das diferentes misturas de herbicidas na brotação inicial, no comprimento médio dos colmos, e nos teores de fibra, pol, brix e pureza por ocasião da colheita. Em relação às principais plantas daninhas presentes na área, que eram capim-colchão (Digitaria sanguinalis (L). Scop.) capim-coloniâo (Panicum maximum Jacq), beldroega (Portulacca oleracea L.) e caruru (Amaranthus spp), as melhores porcentagens de controle foram obtidas com as misturas de ametryne + 2, 4 -D, MCPA + 2, 4 -D, oxadiazon + 2, 4 -D, ametryne + secbumetone, diuron + hexazinone e MCPA + 2, 3, 6 -TBA + pendimethalin. Aos cinco meses o teor de P foi diminuido pela mistura de ametryne + secbumetone + 2, 4 -D, e o teor de Ca decresceu pelas misturas de diuron + 2, 4 -D, ametryne + 2, 4 -D, alachlor + 2, 4 -D, <b>asulam</b> + ioxynil + 2, 4 -D, MCPA + 2, 4 -D, oxadiazon + 2, 4 -D, ametryne + simazine + 2, 4 -D e ametryne + secbumetone + 2, 4 -D. Já aos oito meses não houve diferença estatística para qualquer dos nutrientes estudados. Os teores de pol/ha e produção de colmos/ha não foram significativamente afetados por qualquer dos tratamentos quando comparados com a testemunha com capina. Todavia, todos os tratamentos apresentaram produção inferior a esta, sugerindo certa precaução com as aplicações pós-emergentes em canade-açúcar. The {{present research}} was conducted in the São Carlos Sugar Mill. Jaboticabal - SP in a oxisol (Latossolic B) containing 3, 9 % organic matter. with the obje tive to study {{the behavior of the}} main post-emergence herbicide mixtures, in the sugarcane crop for weed control, and their interferences on the macronutrient levels and development of CB 41 - 14 variety. The treatments in kg of active ingredient per hectare were: ametryne + 2, 4 -D (comercial formulation) at 1, 47 -t 2, 03; diuron + 2, 4 -D at 1, 60 + 2, 16 : ametryne + 2, 4 -D at 1, 60 + 2, 16; alachlor + 2, 4 -D at 1, 09 + 1, 08; <b>asulam</b> + ioxynil 2, 4 -D at 2, 8 + 1, 75; MCPA + 2, 4 -D at 0, 83 + 0, 83; oxadiazon 2, 4 -D at 0, 50 + 2, 16; ametryne + simazine + 2, 4 -D at 1, 25 1, 25 + 2, 16; ametryn + secbumeton + 2, 4 -D at 2, 00 + 2, 00 + 2, 16; diuron + hexazinone + surfactant at 0, 80 + 0, 45 + 0, 5 % and MCPA + 2, 3, 6 -TBA + pendimethalin + surfactant at 1, 50 + 0, 48 + 0, 66 + 0, 5 %. The weed control was evaluated by counting the surviving weeds, and by visual evaluation according to the scale of the "AssociacionLatinoamericana de Malezas" (ALAM). The effects on the crop were evaluated by counting the fresh-emerging sugarcane plants, visual evaluating of herbicide injuries, analysis of macronutrients levels in the leaves at 5 and 8 months after planting, measures of the lenght of the culms, analysis of fibers, brix, purity and poi and the values of pot/ha and weight of culms/ha. Any interference of the herbicide mixtures. was not observed on the ini tial growth, the average lenght of the culms, the fiber, pol, brix or purity. The best weed control was obtained by the mixtures ametryn + 2, 4 -D, MCPA + 2, 4 -D, oxadiazon + 2, 4 -D, ametryn + secbumeton, diuron + hexazinone and MCPA + 2, 3, 6 TBA + pendimethalin, and the principal weeds present in the area were Digitaria sanguinalis (L.) Scop, Panicum maximum Jacq., Portulacca oleracea L. and Amaranthus spp. The P content level was reduced by ametryn + secbumeton t 2, 4 -D and the Ca reduced by diuron + 2, 4 -D, ametryn; 2, 4 -D, alachlor + 2, 4 -D, <b>asulam</b> + ioxynil + 2, 4 -D, MCPA + 2, 4 -D, oxadiazon + 2, 4 -D, ametryn + simazine + 2, 4 -D and ametryn + secbumeton + 2, 4 -D at 5 months. At 8 months no effect on the macronutrient levels was observed. The values of po l/ha and weight of culms/ha were not affected by the treatments when compared with the hoed control, but all treatments yielded less than the hoed control...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the construction of}} a carbon paste electrode (CPE) impregnated with nanoparticles of iron(II) phthalocyanine (nanoFePc). The new electrode (nanoFePc-CPE) revealed interesting electrocatalytic behaviour towards amitrole; pure catalytic diffusion-controlled process, with high Tafel slope (235 mV/decade) suggesting strong binding of amitrole with nanoFePc catalyst. The effects of catalyst loading, varying pH and electrolytes were studied. The mechanism for the interaction of amitrole with the nanoFePc is proposed to involve the Fe[superscript (III) ]Pc/Fe[superscript (II) ]Pc redox process. Using chronoamperometry (E = + 0. 42 V versus Ag/AgCl) technique, the sensor was reliably employed for amitrole assay at pH 12. 0 phosphate buffer (with sodium sulphate as the supporting electrolyte) for up to 12 nM amitrole with excellent sensitivity (ca. 3. 44 μA/nM) and low detection limit (3. 62 ± 0. 11 nM, i. e. 0. 305 μg L[superscript (− 1) ] using the YB + 3 σB criterion and 0. 85 ± 0. 03 nM, i. e. 70 ng/L with the Y[subscript B] + 2 [subscript σB] criterion) as well as satisfactory amperometric selectivity coefficient (K[subscript amp] ≈ 7. 4 × 10 [superscript (− 4) ] for ammonium thiocyanate, a component of many amitrole herbicides, and 3. 2 × 10 [superscript (− 3) ] for <b>asulam</b> pesticide). The surface of the electrode can easily be regenerated by simple polishing on an alumina paper, obtaining a fresh surface ready for use in a new assay. The proposed electrode was successfully applied in the quantification of amitrole in its commercial formulation as well as in tap water samples...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{contains}} a literature review of Holcus lanatus and records studies {{on both the}} growth and spread of the species and the response of it and of Lolium perenne to several management and edaphic factors. Holcus lanatus is an adaptable, competitive species with ecotypes growing {{in a wide range}} of environments. It is valuable on hill land, acid, low nutrient soils and to prevent erosion. Beef cattle grazing it have made greater liveweight gains than on L. perenne. Experiments used plants growing in pots and small field plots. A growth study of spaced H. lanatus plants showed they can produce up to 240, 000 seeds, most of which germinated shortly after being shed onto moist soil. Seedlings established poorly in a closed sward. Spaced plants produced runners in autumn whose plantlets established better when plants were cut regularly in spring. Holcus lanatus plants needed vernalization in order to flower. This was enhanced by and to a small extent replaced by short days. When H. lanatus plants in bud were cut, useful summer vegetative regrowth resulted. The New Zealand cultivar Massey Basyn was more productive than Oxfordshire H. lanatus in a pot trial. Holcus lanatus dominated a mixture with L. perenne in a glasshouse experiment, especially under high or infrequent cutting, but it was not so dominant in a field experiment. Cattle treading damaged H. lanatus more than it did L. perenne. Holcus lanatus responded to a high water table by producing adventitious and surface roots. Propyzamide at 2. 24 and linuron at 1. 12 kg a. i. /ha in early summer and <b>asulam</b> at 1. 12 or 2. 24 kg a. i. /ha in early September gave good control of established H. lanatus in L. perenne in preliminary trials. The agricultural significance of these results is discussed. </p...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe photophysics of {{the neutral}} {{molecular}} {{form of the}} herbicide <b>asulam</b> has been described in a joint experimental and theoretical, at the CASPT 2 level, study. The unique π → π* aromatic electronic transition (f, ca. 0. 5) shows a weak red-shift as the polarity of the solvent is increased, whereas the fluorescence band undergoes larger red-shifts. Solvatochromic data point to higher dipole moment in the excited state than in the ground state (μg < μe). The observed increase in pKa in the excited state (pKa* - pKa, ca. 3) {{is consistent with the}} results of the Kamlet-Abboud-Taft and Catalán et al. multiparametric approaches. Fluorescence quantum yield varies with the solvent, higher in water (f = 0. 16) and lower in methanol and 1 -propanol (approx. 0. 02). Room temperature fluorescence lifetime in aqueous solution is (1. 0 ± 0. 2) ns, whereas the phosphorescence lifetime in glassy EtOH at 77 K and the corresponding quantum yield are (1. 1 ± 0. 1) s and 0. 36, respectively. The lack of mirror image symmetry between modified absorption and fluorescence spectra reflects different nuclear configurations in the absorbing and emitting states. The low value measured for the fluorescence quantum yield is justified by an efficient nonradiative decay channel, related with the presence of an easily accessible conical intersection between the initially populated singlet bright 1 (La ππ*) state and the ground state (gs/ππ*) CI. Along the main decay path of the 1 (La ππ*) state the system undergoes an internal conversion process that switches part of the population from the bright 1 (La ππ*) to the dark 1 (Lb ππ*) state, which is responsible for the fluorescence. Additionally, singlet-triplet crossing regions have been found, a fact that can explain the phosphorescent emission detected. An intersystem crossing region between the phosphorescent state 3 (La ππ*) and the ground state has been characterized, which contributes to the nonradiative deactivation of the excitation energy...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Scouringrushes (Equisetum hyemale L.; E. xferrissii Clute; E. laevigatum L.) are ancient {{perennial}} seedless vascular plants historically {{associated with}} wetlands, low-lying roadsides or field margins with more plant available water. There {{has been little}} research conducted on scouringrush species {{in the context of}} agricultural production because traditional farming practices confined them to field margins and roadside depressions. An increasing amount of dryland winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) hectares in the inland Pacific Northwest have replaced summer tilled-fallow rotations with chemical fallow. Where chemical fallow rotations have become the standard practice, scouringrush has expanded out of its historical habitat into production fields and established at high enough densities to cause concern from growers. Research was conducted to identify control options that fit chemical fallow cropping systems, evaluate the magnitude of crop interference by scouringrush, and address how soil pH affects scouringrush growth and establishment, as soil acidification is another agronomic issue caused by intensive wheat production in the Pacific Northwest. Field studies located in Reardan, WA, and near The Dalles, OR, were established in commercial wheat production fields that evaluated 10 herbicide treatments for efficacy on scouringrush. An additional factor in the trials was to determine if pre-herbicide mowing affected herbicide efficacy. At both locations pre-herbicide mowing had no effect on efficacy and only chlorsulfuron plus MCPA-ester controlled scouringrush though the subsequent winter wheat rotation. A third herbicide trial determined that triclopyr or increased rates of chlorsulfuron plus 2, 4 -D and dicamba or <b>asulam</b> were able to effectively control scouringrush seven and 10 months after treatment at a non-crop site in eastern Oregon. Under field conditions wheat yield reductions were correlated with increasing scouringrush density, but in a controlled study scouringrush density had no effect on winter wheat development or grain yield. Disagreement between these results is hypothesized to be a function of nutrient deficiencies within production fields. Results from three greenhouse studies showed that scouringrush biomass production increased as soil pH increased from ≈ 4. 6 to ≈ 8. 0 and that scouringrush was able to establish and survive in soil pH conditions that are unsuitable for winter wheat production...|$|E
40|$|Poa trivialis is a {{perennial}} grass weed {{commonly found in}} perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) racetrack swards throughout New Zealand. Its presence is undesirable as it does not tolerate high wear and is susceptible to dying out over the summer. Two pot trials at Massey University and one field trial carried out at the Awapuni racecourse were conducted during winter and spring 1995 to test the relative susceptibility of Poa trivialis and perennial ryegrass {{to a wide range}} of herbicides. A bioassay was also conducted to determine whether herbicide residues from the field trial could affect the germination of perennial ryegrass seed sown soon after treatment. Results showed that none of the chemicals at their chosen respective rates could completely remove Poa trivialis from a racetrack sward in the spring without some damage being caused to perennial ryegrass. Propyzamide and fenoxaprop at rates of 0. 2 and 0. 15 kg/ha respectively showed the most potential of the chemicals, severely damaging Poa trivialis (causing 50 to 75 % reductions) with no adverse effect on perennial ryegrass 8 weeks after spraying. Propyzamide can also provide some control of Poa annua. Fenoxaprop was not improved by increasing the application rate or adding an oil. The performance of fenoxaprop was substantially reduced when applied with either MCPA or a picloram/triclopyr mix. Dalapon and <b>asulam</b> showed good potential to control Poa trivialis but at the high rates tested caused variable or harmful effects to perennial ryegrass. Ethofumesate and chlorpropham applied at rates of 2. 0 and 2. 5 kg/ha respectively gave inadequate control of Poa trivialis. None of the above herbicides, when used in the field trial resulted in residues which reduced the germination of perennial ryegrass seed sown 3 weeks after spraying. Herbicides tested in the pot trials which showed poor control of Poa trivialis were atrazine, dicamba, isoproturon/diflufenican, linuron, mecoprop, methabenzthiazuron, metsulfuron, pendimethalin, prometryne, thifensulfuron-methyl, triclopyr, and trinexapac-ethyl. Diuron applied at 2. 6 kg/ha provided good control of Poa trivialis but caused significant damage to perennial ryegrass. It is concluded that an integrated management approach that incorporates both cultural and chemical techniques will be required to control Poa trivialis on New Zealand racetracks. Future trial work should be carried out on propyzamide applied at rates of 0. 2 - 0. 3 kg/ha in autumn to establish the most appropriate time of year to apply this herbicide...|$|E
