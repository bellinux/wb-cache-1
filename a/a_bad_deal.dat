25|$|Cheatham Annex {{continued}} as a Navy supply depot after World War II. A {{portion of the}} bulk fuel storage facilities was transferred {{by the federal government}} to the Commonwealth of Virginia for use during the domestic fuel crisis periods of the 1970s. Due to extensive pollution, {{this turned out to be}} <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>deal</b> for the state. A portion of the former Penniman site was transferred to the National Park Service in 1979 and was added to the Colonial National Historical Park. The bucolic and historic Colonial Parkway is a prominent feature of this park.|$|E
25|$|In December 2007, UMG {{announced}} {{a deal with}} Imeem which allows users of the social network to listen to any track from Universal's catalogue for free with {{a portion of the}} advertising generated by the music being shared with the record label. Two weeks after the deal was announced Michael Robertson speculated on the secret terms of the deal and argued that ultimately this was <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>deal</b> for imeem. This speculation lead to a flame war on the Pho digital media email list as imeem representatives denied his claims and dismissed his theories as unfounded. All traffic was redirected to MySpace after the company acquired Imeem on December 8, 2009.|$|E
500|$|The European Union and the United States as well {{as other}} western {{countries}} remain critical of the Eurasian Economic Union, with analysts stating that without modernisation and real economic reforms, the union will have little impact. The popular magazine The Economist stated that the advantages of joining the union remain unclear and further remarked [...] "The agreement was vague, with technical details left unresolved, making it a political show rather than an economic one". Outlets have also stated that without Ukraine, the Eurasian Economic Union has lost a key member state necessary {{to the success of the}} union. Bloomberg's business magazine, Businessweek has affirmed that joining Putin's Eurasian Union looks like <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>deal,</b> including for Russia. The union [...] "won't really register on the radar of the global economy," [...] said an analyst at the EU's Institute for Security Studies in Paris.|$|E
25|$|Judge Anthony Petrillo (Charles Lane)—the judge {{presiding}} over Jessica's murder trial. Lost $40,000 in <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> investment <b>deal</b> because of Chester, and clearly holds a grudge against him for it.|$|R

2500|$|... (1962–1972) {{was between}} Carlo Gambino and Genovese family acting boss/front boss Thomas Eboli. The {{alliance}} was short-lived because Eboli was {{unable or unwilling}} to repay Gambino money from <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> narcotics <b>deal.</b> The alliance ended when Gambino ordered Eboli's murder on July 16, 1972.|$|R
500|$|The word [...] "Eggtown" [...] is not {{directly}} referenced in the episode, resulting in online speculation and confusion. [...] According to Lindelof and Cuse, it has been [...] "the most questioned title of the show". [...] Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly suggested that the title was {{a reference to the}} ancient cosmic egg concept or the chicken or the egg causality dilemma, while John Kubicek of BuddyTV guessed that it was a shout-out to the children's book and film called The Easter Egg Adventure, which depicts roosters attempting to steal Easter eggs from the animals of a place called Egg Town or that it was an allusion to the Great Depression slang term, which was used in the 1930s when describing <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>deal.</b> [...] Lindelof and Cuse confirmed that the episode was primarily named as such because Locke fries eggs for Ben's breakfast and secondarily because the story deals with Kate's possible pregnancy.|$|E
500|$|The SmartBike DC bike sharing service, a {{predecessor}} to Capital Bikeshare, {{debuted in}} 2008 with 10 stations and 120 bicycles. It {{was the first}} of its kind in the United States. D.C. Department of Transportation Director Gabe Klein came into office four months later and he eager to expand it, but found the private partner had a [...] "lackluster commitment." [...] Because the agreement specifically prohibited DDOT from paying for anything related to SmartBike, an expansion required DDOT to renegotiate the contract. But in his first meeting with Clear Channel he found that Clear Channel believed they had gotten <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>deal</b> on the original contract that created SmartBike; that following their purchase by Bain Capital they were no longer interested in [...] "municipal street furniture" [...] and that they had neither desire nor obligation to expand the program. In addition, it was difficult and expensive to install new stations, because they required the local utility company to bring electricity to each station. As a result, Klein chose to end the program and instead work with Arlington County, Virginia, to build a new, regional bikesharing program to be called Capital Bikeshare.|$|E
2500|$|... "I don't {{know what}} the {{manufacturing}} costs are, I don't {{know what the}} shipping costs are. I have no concept of that. I do know that {{for the amount of}} stuff we're putting in here, it is certainly not <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>deal.</b> There are literally thousands of hours of content in this game. It doesn't seem like a crazy price to me. But again, I have no idea what the proper margins are. If someone is saying 'What am I going to buy this month?' in November, I hope that our game is the one they pick out, because we're offering something that nothing else on the market is. But if they don't, I totally understand. There's a lot of really cool stuff. What I'm hoping is that as time goes on... These things are still {{going to be on the}} shelf, it's not like we're taking it away. Maybe they don't buy it day one, but maybe they buy it in February? Maybe they buy it in March? We're not going away, and obviously people want to play things the day they come out, if they possibly can, but sometimes they can't." ...|$|E
5000|$|Vacationing in Mexico, Massino {{immediately}} {{met with}} each of the Bonanno capos to tell them {{he did not know what}} happened to Sciascia and theorized it was <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> drug <b>deal.</b> However, in private, Massino reportedly remarked [...] "It served him right for telling me how to run the family." ...|$|R

5000|$|Hostilities between Finland and Soviet Russia {{came to an}} {{end with}} the signing of the Treaty of Tartu in 1920. In {{accordance}} with the treaty, Soviet Russia ceded Petsamo to Finland and guaranteed special freedoms to the Karelian SSR. In return, Finland had to give up the two previously annexed Karelian counties. This was seen by many Finns as <b>a</b> very <b>bad</b> <b>deal.</b> The peace treaty thus got a nickname, [...] "a Shame Peace" [...] (Häpeärauha in Finnish).|$|R
2500|$|May's public reticence {{during the}} {{referendum}} campaign resulted in tensions with David Cameron and his pro-EU team. Following the referendum and her election as party leader, May signalled {{that she would}} support full withdrawal from the EU and prioritise immigration controls over remaining within the single market, leading some to contrast this with her earlier remarks on the earlier economic arguments. She later {{went on to say}} before the 2017 UK general election that she would be willing to leave the EU without a deal, saying that [...] "no deal is better than <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>deal.</b> We {{have to be prepared to}} walk out". The Lib Dem leader, Tim Farron, said it was [...] "disappointing that Theresa May lacked the political courage to warn the public as she did a bunch of bankers in private about the devastating economic effects of Brexit. More disappointing is that now she is supposedly in charge, she is blithely ignoring her own warnings and is prepared to inflict an act of monumental self-harm on the UK economy by pulling Britain out of the single market." [...] Phil Wilson for the 'Open Britain' group said, [...] "It's good to know that privately Theresa May thinks what many of us have been saying publicly for a long time, leaving the single market would be bad for businesses and for our economy. Now she is prime minister, Theresa May is in an unrivalled position to act on her previous concerns, starting by putting membership of the single market at the heart of her government's negotiating position." ...|$|E

I {{can prove}} more in black an' white, an' with witness, than you can. Thet's my case. The deal I'd make is this.... Let's marry an' settle <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>deal</b> thet way." ...|$|E
50|$|May {{was accused}} of not having a plan if Brexit talks break down. There are fears if talks fail Britain could be left trading under WTO rules which it is feared would seriously damage jobs and {{livelihoods}} in Britain and Europe. May's ministers have repeatedly promised {{to walk away from}} <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> final <b>deal</b> but, it is argued, have no plans for how to manage without a deal.|$|R
5000|$|Smith {{was known}} for working with a hymn-singing parrot perched on her shoulder.

50|$|Various {{political}} entities, {{most notably}} Movement for Changes, {{had pointed out}} that selling the KAP was <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>deal</b> {{for the state of}} Montenegro.

50|$|After {{what seemed}} to be <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> {{business}} <b>deal</b> Henry Frawley had a breakdown in 1920 and went to Nebraska for treatment where he died in 1927. From 1920 Cristina ran the ranch as the matriarch until she died in 1942. Henry James Frawley, Sr. and the families of William and Honora Frawley jointly ran the ranch until Henry bought out the others in 1960. In 1962 Henry James Frawley, Jr. had completed college and joined his parents in running the ranch. In 1968 the state of South Dakota used eminent domain to gain a right-of-way for Interstate 90 through the northern pastures of the ranch. Tunnels were built so that livestock could cross under the interstate.|$|R
5000|$|In season two, Joe's role is expanded, {{and it is}} {{revealed}} that Joe relies on the Greek's smuggling ring to supply him with heroin through the Baltimore ports.

More developed countries in the TPP enjoy comparative advantages in terms of agricultural technology and state subsidies with which the agricultural industry of the Philippines is at a disadvantage.|$|E
