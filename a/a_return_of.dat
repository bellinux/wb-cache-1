50|$|As of July 5, 2013, the B400 had <b>a</b> 10-year annualized <b>return</b> <b>of</b> 9.9%, {{compared}} to <b>a</b> DJIA annualized <b>return</b> <b>of</b> 5.2%, <b>an</b> S&P500 <b>return</b> <b>of</b> 5.1%, <b>a</b> NASDAQ <b>return</b> <b>of</b> 7.5% and <b>a</b> DJUSTSM <b>return</b> <b>of</b> 6.0% {{for the same}} time period.|$|R
50|$|Ordinary {{returns and}} {{logarithmic}} returns are only equal {{when they are}} zero, but they are approximately equal when they are small. The difference between them is large only when percent changes are high. For example, <b>an</b> arithmetic <b>return</b> <b>of</b> +50% is equivalent to <b>a</b> logarithmic <b>return</b> <b>of</b> 40.55%, while <b>an</b> arithmetic <b>return</b> <b>of</b> -50% is equivalent to <b>a</b> logarithmic <b>return</b> <b>of</b> -69.31%.|$|R
50|$|Logarithmic {{returns are}} useful for {{mathematical}} finance. One of the advantages is that the logarithmic returns are symmetric, while ordinary returns are not: positive and negative percent ordinary <b>returns</b> <b>of</b> equal magnitude do not {{cancel each other out}} and result in a net change, but logarithmic <b>returns</b> <b>of</b> equal magnitude but opposite signs will cancel each other out. This means that an investment of $100 that yields <b>an</b> arithmetic <b>return</b> <b>of</b> 50% followed by <b>an</b> arithmetic <b>return</b> <b>of</b> -50% will result in $75, while an investment of $100 that yields <b>a</b> logarithmic <b>return</b> <b>of</b> 50% followed by <b>a</b> logarithmic <b>return</b> <b>of</b> -50% will come back to $100.|$|R
5|$|The endings {{of the two}} {{poems are}} the same but have {{opposite}} results: they both have a sunset and an exodus from the country, but the first deals with Wales and the second with the Aztec lands.

5|$|At {{the end of}} the 1950s, {{reflecting}} {{both the}} threat of possible invasion by the Soviet Union and the realities of nuclear warfare, Swiss military doctrine changed to that of a dynamic (mobile) defense that included missions for the Swiss Air Force outside of its territory, in order to defeat standoff attacks and nuclear threats, including the possibility of defensive employment of air-delivered nuclear weapons. However the inability to field an air force of sufficient capability to carry out such missions led to <b>a</b> <b>return</b> <b>of</b> traditional doctrine.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{were among}} the wild animals hunted for food before the Neolithic {{revolution}} {{and the development of}} agriculture. For example, in the Epipaleolithic of the Levant, between c. 14,500 and 11,500 BP, both waterfowl and migratory birds were eaten. Archaeologists have studied the return in terms of energy from captured food compared to the energy expended to capture it; birds provide a smaller return than larger game such as deer, but better than many plant materials. For example waterfowl captured in a drive can yield <b>a</b> <b>return</b> <b>of</b> around 2,000 kcal/hour, whereas an antelope can yield as much as 31,000 kcal/hour, and wild rye around 1,000 kcal/hour.|$|E
50|$|In Queensland, gaming {{machines}} in pubs and clubs must provide <b>a</b> <b>return</b> rate <b>of</b> 85% while machines located in casinos must provide <b>a</b> <b>return</b> rate <b>of</b> 90%. Most {{other states have}} similar provisions.|$|R

50|$|This {{pattern is}} not {{followed}} in the case <b>of</b> logarithmic <b>returns,</b> due to their symmetry, as noted above. <b>A</b> logarithmic <b>return</b> <b>of</b> +10%, followed by &minus;10%, gives <b>an</b> overall <b>return</b> <b>of</b> 10% - 10% = 0%, and <b>an</b> average rate <b>of</b> <b>return</b> <b>of</b> zero also.|$|R
5|$|During his presidency, Endara {{abolished}} the Panamanian military {{and replaced it}} with a national police force. Endara's term saw steady economic growth and <b>a</b> <b>return</b> <b>of</b> democratic institutions, but also high unemployment rates. His administration was marked by internal fighting and corruption scandals, and his popularity plummeted. He was succeeded by opposition candidate Ernesto Pérez Balladares on September 1, 1994.|$|E
5|$|In Syria {{difficulties}} in executing immunization {{programs in the}} ongoing civil war led to <b>a</b> <b>return</b> <b>of</b> polio, probably in 2012, acknowledged by the WHO in 2013. 15 cases were confirmed among children in Syria between October and November 2013 in Deir Ezzor. Later, two more cases, one each in rural Damascus and Aleppo, were identified. It was the first outbreak in Syria since 1999. Doctors and international public health agencies report more than 90 cases of polio in Syria, with fears of contagion in rebel areas from lack of sanitation and safe-water services.|$|E
5|$|In a major {{space policy}} speech in April 2010, Obama {{announced}} a planned change in direction at NASA, the U.S. space agency.

30|$|We {{assumed that}} the {{boulders}} were transported in rolling mode. However, if the boulders were transported in sliding mode, the required wave heights to move the boulders would be smaller than those with <b>a</b> <b>return</b> period <b>of</b> 50  years (Table  2). This suggests that the boulders could be moved by the small amplitude waves that have <b>a</b> <b>return</b> period <b>of</b> 50  years or less if the boulders were moved in sliding mode.

5|$|Neumann {{delivered}} {{a letter from}} the queen to Grover Cleveland, who began his second non-consecutive term as president on March 4. The Cleveland administration commissioned the Blount Report, and based on its findings, concluded that the overthrow of Liliʻuokalani was illegal, and that Stevens and American military troops had acted inappropriately in support of those who carried out the overthrow. On November 16, Cleveland sent his minister Albert S. Willis to propose <b>a</b> <b>return</b> <b>of</b> the throne to Liliʻuokalani if she granted amnesty to everyone responsible. Her first response was that Hawaiian law called for property confiscation and the death penalty for treason, and that only her cabinet ministers could put aside the law in favor of amnesty.|$|E
5|$|On 1 July 2006, Mertens officially {{signed for}} AGOVV Apeldoorn, who later {{dissolved}} in 2013, on a season-long loan with {{the option of}} purchase. He managed <b>a</b> <b>return</b> <b>of</b> 2 goals in 35 appearances during a season which saw him become a fan favourite amongst De Blauwen supporters. Mertens' form prompted AGOVV, led by new manager John van den Brom, to exercise the option to sign the Belgian permanently the following season. It was a move that paid off for the Dutch club as Mertens ended the season having 15 goals in 38 appearances for the club.|$|E
5|$|Soon after {{reaching}} his century during the afternoon, Compton edged to the slips from the bowling of Miller, but Johnson spilled the catch. Compton {{went on to}} make 184 and England were eventually out for 441 on the final day. Johnson sent down 42 overs for <b>a</b> <b>return</b> <b>of</b> 1/66. He had the best economy rate of 1.57 runs per over, ahead of Toshack's 1.81; Bradman used both in a defensive manner.

5|$|The {{allure of}} class respectability is another {{constant}} in Les Chouans, {{as it is}} for Balzac's entire oeuvre. Marie's birth as an illegitimate child contributes to her position {{at the start of the}} novel. The ups and downs of her young adult life land her in Corentin's hands, yearning for the 300,000-franc reward promised to her on the capture of Montauran. Marie's focus changes from money to marriage, a sign of hope amid the tragedy of circumstances. When she first considers Montauran, she recognizes that <b>a</b> <b>return</b> <b>of</b> the king would bring privileges; still, her oscillating actions follow the path of her passions, not rational self-interest.|$|E
5|$|The company's {{sales of}} MIS schemes, and its profits, both peaked in 2006, with over A$450million in sales, and a net {{profit after tax}} of A$133million. However, the 2006 harvest (of 1996 {{plantations}}) yielded <b>a</b> <b>return</b> <b>of</b> only A$1500 and $1750 for the woodlots that investors had bought for A$3000. These plantations had not been productive enough to yield a profit for investors, so Great Southern inflated the returns to A$4100 using its own funds.|$|E
5|$|The {{continuation}} of Octel Freight Traffic until 1993 ensured {{that not only}} was the trackbed kept whole, but the majority of the rail infrastructure was still in situ. As such, the Amlwch line was well suited to preservation as a heritage railway, or see <b>a</b> <b>return</b> <b>of</b> mainline services. The continued role of Llangefni as an administrative and commercial centre led British Rail and Gwynedd County Council to consider restoring passenger services between Llangefni and Bangor in the late 1980s, but the idea was turned down.|$|E
