5|$|Paths, arbors, and fences use {{traditional}} or antique looking materials. Wooden {{fences and}} gates, paths covered with locally made bricks or stone, and arbors using natural materials all give a more casual—and less formal—look and feel to <b>a</b> <b>cottage</b> garden.

5|$|In February 1834, Etty became seriously ill, and was {{incapacitated}} {{for four}} months. Unable to paint, he exhibited only two already-completed {{paintings in the}} 1834 Summer Exhibition, Elizabeth Potts and The Cardinal.

Weak and unable to concentrate, Etty painted very little, and spend {{the next few months}} visiting friends and touring the sights of Yorkshire.

After spending Christmas 1924 in Majorca he leased <b>a</b> <b>cottage</b> (formerly occupied by Foss) in the Kent village of Eynsford.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to its growing importance as a tourist centre, Keswick developed a reputation for its manufacture of pencils during the 19th century. It had begun on a modest scale in or about 1792, as <b>a</b> <b>cottage</b> industry, using graphite mined locally. This developed on more industrial lines in factories purpose-built by several companies. Pencil making was the town's most important manufacturing industry by the mid-19th century, textiles and leather goods having declined.|$|E

5|$|The North West Ambulance Service {{provides}} emergency {{patient transport}} in the area.

Dr Kershaw's Hospice, a registered charity, provides specialist palliative care for adults with non-curable life-threatening illnesses.|$|E

This installation lasted until 1955, when a new pumphouse was constructed to house two diesel pumps. The steam engine was retained for historical reasons, and is located in part of the new building. The diesel pumps were supplemented by an electric pump in 1983, and a programme of refurbishment was carried out in 2008, which included {{the construction of a new}} outfall into the river.|$|E

5|$|Arbroath smokies, {{for which}} Arbroath is {{well-known}} nationally and internationally, are made solely in Arbroath following the award of Protected Geographical Indication in 2004, which limits Arbroath smokie production to within 4km of Arbroath. Smokies {{are made from}} haddock using traditional methods {{dating back to the}} late 19th century where the fish are first salted overnight to preserve them, before being left tied in pairs to dry. Next, the dried fish are hung in a special barrel containing a hardwood fire and covered with a lid. After around an hour of smoking, the fish are golden brown and ready to eat. The preparation of smokies remains <b>a</b> <b>cottage</b> industry in Arbroath, centred almost exclusively at the harbour area. However, one larger processor, RR Spink, supplied Arbroath smokies to several UK supermarket chains. It appears that, nowadays, the firm concentrates on smoking other fish such as salmon or trout and no longer supplies the Arbroath Smokie. The company holds the Royal Warrant as a fishmonger to the Queen.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the 16th century, {{although}} {{agriculture and}} the dairy industry, particularly the production of Leigh cheese, sometimes known as Leigh Toaster, were important, spinning and weaving began to develop as <b>a</b> <b>cottage</b> industry. Work was supplied from Manchester by agents who brought work weekly often to an inn, and where they collected the finished cloth. At first the work was done to supplement the income of local farmers and their families. The cloth woven in Leigh was fustian, a sort of rough corduroy, and by {{the end of the}} 17th century middlemen, fustian masters, were dealing directly with weavers and selling the finished cloth in Manchester.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} they were ready for their first {{practical}} installation, they heard that one of their members, Girja Sharan, had obtained a grant to construct a dew condenser in Kothara, India. In April 2001, Sharan had incidentally noticed substantial condensation on the roof of <b>a</b> <b>cottage</b> at Toran Beach Resort in the arid coastal region of Kutch, where he was briefly staying. The following year, he investigated the phenomenon more closely and interviewed local people. Financed by the Gujarat Energy Development Agency and the World Bank, Sharan and his team went on to develop passive, radiative condensers for use in the arid coastal region of Kutch. Active commercialisation began in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Grant {{was nearly}} broke and worried {{constantly}} about leaving {{his wife a}} suitable {{amount of money to}} live on. Century magazine offered Grant a book contract with a 10 percent royalty, but Grant's friend Mark Twain, understanding how bad Grant's financial condition was, made him an offer for his memoirs which paid an unheard-of 75 percent royalty. To provide for his family, Grant worked intensely on his memoirs at his home in New York City. His former staff member Adam Badeau assisted him with much of the research, while his son Frederick located documents and did much of the fact-checking. Because of the summer heat and humidity, his doctors recommended that he move upstate to <b>a</b> <b>cottage</b> at the top of Mount McGregor, offered by a family friend.|$|E
