5|$|When Khánh {{heard of}} his ouster, he {{declared}} {{it to be}} illegal. After defying his colleagues and travelling {{around the country for}} a day in a fruitless attempt to rally support for a comeback, Khánh went into exile after being named to fill the meaningless post of <b>Ambassador-at-Large</b> and allowed an elaborate ceremonial military send-off to save face. Phát and Thảo were later sentenced to death in absentia. Thảo was hunted down and killed in July 1965, while Phát remained on the run for several years before turning himself in and being pardoned.|$|E

25|$|In December 1960, as the Kennedy Administration took shape, Melby {{tried to}} have his {{security}} clearance restored, encouraged by the appointment of Dean Rusk, who was familiar with his State Department work, as the new Secretary of State. His longtime friend Averell Harriman was becoming <b>ambassador-at-large.</b> Robert F. Kennedy blocked their efforts. Appeals to State Department officials responsible for administrative matters failed, as did the advocacy of Pennsylvania Senator Joseph S. Clark, Jr. on Melby's behalf. HUAC maintained a list of persons it considered ineligible for government employment that overrode State Department views. Melby dropped these efforts in 1966, {{when he moved to}} Canada.|$|E
25|$|During the funeral, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew, <b>Ambassador-at-Large</b> Tommy Koh and Dr. V K Pillay, an {{orthopaedic}} surgeon, delivered their eulogies.

Nathan and later to S. Vijayaratnam & S. Jothiratnam (nephews & Rajaratnam's closest relatives). The Singapore National Pledge was recited by the mourners in honour of Rajaratnam, who penned down the National Pledge {{against the backdrop of}} racial riots in the 1950s and 1960s to inculcate in all Singaporeans his vision of building one united Singapore regardless of race, language or religion.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} the evening, he was in Đà Lạt {{when his}} plane had no fuel left, and no pumps were open at the time, so he was marooned there for the night. Fearing a Khánh comeback, the AFC met again and {{unanimously}} resolved to make contingency plans to repel any counter-insurrection by Khánh. Westmoreland sent Colonel Wilson, Khánh's former confidant, to go to the military airport at Đà Lạt to convince the Vietnamese general to resign and allow a new military leadership to take the reins. Khánh finally agreed to leave if he was given a dignified send-off, so the other generals arranged a ceremony at Tan Son Nhut, where military bands serenaded him. He theatrically bent down and picked up some loose dirt before putting it in his pocket, saying that he was taking his beloved homeland with him. His enemies, the remaining Vietnamese officers and Taylor, all met him at the airport. He then left as <b>Ambassador-at-Large,</b> and was sent on a world tour, starting with a report at the United Nations in New York City.|$|E

500|$|Following {{a change}} in {{administration}} in Washington, in May 2017 {{it was reported that}} Cindy McCain was under consideration for a prominent role at the U.S. Department of State, possibly focusing on issues related to human trafficking. [...] In June 2017, there were further reports that after extensive recruiting by the chief executive following a recommendation from Ivanka Trump, she had agreed to become an <b>Ambassador-at-Large</b> dealing with matters of human trafficking, refugees, and humanitarian aid. [...] No official announcement has yet been made regarding this. [...] In July 2017 she faced the news that her husband had been diagnosed with a glioblastoma, an aggressive brain tumor. [...] She issued a public statement saying that, [...] "We as a family will face the next hurdle together. One thing I do know is he is the toughest person I know.

500|$|Luis CdeBaca, United States <b>Ambassador-at-Large</b> to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons, said, [...] "With the {{announcement}} of a new national action plan, Canada is showing the international community what an effective anti-trafficking strategy looks like."

500|$|Khánh {{finally agreed}} to leave if {{he was given a}} dignified send-off, so the other generals {{arranged}} a ceremonial farewell at Tan Son Nhut on February 24. Military bands played as he theatrically bent down and picked up some loose dirt before putting it in his pocket; Khánh said he was taking his beloved homeland with him, and vowed to one day return. His enemies, the remaining Vietnamese officers, most notably Kỳ and Thi, as well as Taylor, all met him at the airport. The foes managed smiles and handshakes for the media cameras. To make the coup [...] "appear as much as possible the doing of Vietnamese themselves", Taylor had not made any public statement after Khánh’s ouster, on orders from the State Department. Wearing his Grand Cross of the National Order, and carrying two more plastic bags filled with Vietnamese soil, Khánh then left as <b>Ambassador-at-Large,</b> and was sent on a meaningless world tour, starting with a report to the United Nations in New York City.|$|E
500|$|On 4 August, South Ossetian {{president}} Eduard Kokoity {{said that}} about 300 volunteers had arrived from North Ossetia to help fight the Georgians and thousands more were expected from the North Caucasus. On 5 August, Georgian authorities organised a tour for journalists and diplomats to demonstrate the damage supposedly caused by separatists. That day, Russian <b>Ambassador-at-Large</b> Yuri Popov declared that his country would intervene {{on the side of}} South Ossetia. The destruction of the village of Nuli was ordered by South Ossetian interior minister Mindzaev. About 50 Russian journalists had arrived in Tskhnivali. They were waiting for [...] "something to happen". A pro-government Russian newspaper reported on 6 August: [...] "Don Cossacks prepare to fight in South Ossetia". Nezavisimaya Gazeta reported that Russian military was being pulled to the Georgian border on 6 August and that [...] "there is no doubt that Russia thus demonstrates determination to protect its citizens in South Ossetia.

[...] On the evening of 6 August, an attempt by Saakashvili to contact Russian president Medvedev to discuss the conflict was curbed by the Russian Foreign Ministry, which said: [...] "the time for presidential negotiations has not yet arrived." ...|$|E
500|$|The film had its {{official}} premiere in Alice Tully Hall at the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York City on January 19, 2011. Melanne Verveer, United States <b>Ambassador-at-Large</b> for Global Women's Issues, gave a speech, saying, [...] "Each {{and every one}} of us is called to act. I hope that tonight each of us will make their own commitment." [...] Additional screenings were held in Los Angeles and Chicago later that month. That October, Not My Life had its international premiere in London. CNN International aired the film in two parts a few days later as part of the CNN Freedom Project. The Swedish premiere was attended by Crown Princess Victoria. Bilheimer recognized that people combatting human trafficking are in need of resources, so he considered various options with respect to the intellectual property of Not My Life, ultimately deciding to release the film at charge in addition to selling licenses for unlimited private screenings. On November 1, an 83-minute version of the film was released on DVD by Worldwide Documentaries, which also began digitally distributing the film and selling the unlimited licenses. LexisNexis, the governments of Arizona and Minnesota, and the U.S. Fund for UNICEF all purchased licenses. The latter organization planned to use the film as part of an anti-human-trafficking campaign.|$|E
500|$|On 13 November, Malaysia's Agent, <b>Ambassador-at-Large</b> Abdul Kadir Mohamad, {{alleged that}} [...] Singapore {{was trying to}} [...] "subvert" [...] a 150-year-old {{arrangement}} under which Singapore operated Horsburgh Lighthouse on Pedra Branca, which was Malaysia's territory. He also suggested that if permitted to do so, Singapore would upset the peace and stability of {{the area where the}} island is located. He said that if Singapore reclaimed land around Pedra Branca, [...] "uite apart from the possible effects on the environment and navigation in the Strait, this could lead to potentially serious changes to the security arrangements in the eastern entrance of the Strait". According to Malaysian Attorney-General Abdul Gani Patail, Singapore had first raised the issue of sovereignty over Pedra Branca on 13 April 1978 during a meeting between officials, saying it had [...] "incontrovertible legal evidence" [...] of its sovereignty over the island though it had never produced any documents in support. Prior to that, the sovereignty of the island had never been disputed. The 1980 statement by the then Malaysian Prime Minister Tun Hussein Onn concerning the [...] "unclear" [...] position of the island had also been premised on these documents which former Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew had claimed were in Singapore's possession. The statement was therefore merely a friendly and respectful statement of a visiting prime minister at a press conference which had no probative value in court. All Hussein Onn had meant was that the matter required further discussion between the two countries.|$|E
