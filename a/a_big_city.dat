25|$|The {{setting of}} Lullaby is {{constantly}} changing. In both {{the present tense}} narration and the story he is reflecting on, Streator is constantly moving in pursuit of something. He works in <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>city</b> atmosphere and lives in an apartment surrounded by other tenants who become symbolic of everything Streator hates. Soon after he meets Helen, they start their cross-country mission. Most of the towns they end up in are small, nowhere places that seem to represent the emptiness that the culling song creates in people lives. Similarly, the trucker stops that Streator and Helen drive through in their present-day adventure are representative of how the stories that they are chasing are temporary. The idea that a story is always told ‘after the fact’ seems to hint at a bigger picture: humans are a victim of their past.|$|E

In her bedroom, Lyra gazes upon the alethiometer and notices that it {{continuously}} points to a lady, a lightning bolt, and a baby. She {{does not know what}} to make of her observation, however, and says nothing of it to Mrs.Coulter. Despite initially projecting the image of a free-spirited woman, she reveals herself to be extremely respectful of the Magisterium and its function. One night, Lyra casually mentions Dust; this puts Mrs. Coulter on edge as she warns Lyra never to mention it again, and also insists that she stop carrying around the bag secretly containing the aleithiometer. Mrs.Coulter's dæmon (a golden monkey) attacks Pantalaimon, causing Lyra to give in. Lyra and Pantalaimon discover that Mrs.Coulter is head of the General Oblation Board, also known as the “Gobblers”, who have been kidnapping local children. Lyra also learns that her best friend Roger and her Gyptian friend Billy have been both taken by the Gobblers.|$|E

[...] The album artwork for the record was revealed on August 4, 2011, featuring the band name written atop a city skyline. The Neighborhoods sleeve contains many names close to the band, including Chloe (DeLonge's pet Labrador Retriever), [...] Ava and Jon (DeLonge's daughter Ava Elizabeth and son Jonas Rocket), Jack (Hoppus' son), Landon, Alabama and Ati (Barker's son, daughter and step-daughter, Atiana), G!

It was filmed between Mexico and Argentina, with the collaboration of children from 5 to 13 age old. Coambre commented about the video that [...] ""Puente" [...] for me is an array of images that tell the same story in opposite realities. Two boys exactly alike; one lives in an abandoned hotel on the beach and the other lives in <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>city</b> skyscraper, yet both are equally lonely. Miami and Havana are where those two boys are in their own worlds and see that the only way out of their realms are when they decide to encounter one another." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{underlying}} {{theme of}} [...] "City of Blinding Lights," [...] {{reflected in the}} chorus, is lost innocence. The theme was reinforced during an impromptu concert at Empire–Fulton Ferry State Park under the Brooklyn Bridge; Bono introduced the song by reminiscing about {{the first time the}} band arrived in New York City, calling it [...] "a song about innocence and naïvete." [...] Bono developed the opening stanza from a memory of his first trip to London with his future wife, Alison Stewart, when they were teenagers. The experience of walking through Piccadilly Circus and along Wardour Street put him in mind of [...] "discovering what <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>city</b> could offer you and what it could take away." [...] Although the first verse is set in London, the chorus is set in New York City. The verse, [...] "I've seen you walk unafraid / I've seen you in the clothes you've made / Can you see the beauty inside of me? / What happened to the beauty I had inside of me?" [...] was written as an expression of love for Alison, with a reflection on their life together as they grow older.|$|E
500|$|Album opener [...] "Human Behaviour" [...] {{features}} a [...] "bouncing riff" [...] sampled from Antônio Carlos Jobim, with [...] "its syncopated beat consigned to a venerable orchestral instrument, the timpani." [...] Its lyrics [...] refer to Björk's {{experience as a}} child, finding the behaviour of adults [...] "rather chaotic and nonsensical," [...] instead finding harmony with other children, nature and animals. Inspired by naturalist David Attenborough, she sings {{from the point of}} view of an animal, with its opening line being [...] "If you ever get close to a human/And human behaviour/Be ready, be ready to get confused". Following track [...] "Crying" [...] shows a contradiction between its [...] "bubbly, shiny-surfaced acid disco-pop" [...] sound and lyrics that describe the turmoil of feeling alienated in <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>city.</b> [...] "Venus as a Boy" [...] —considered an ambient track by Rolling Stone— reflected Björk's newly found interest in Bollywood, having befriended people of Indian origin in London, most notably Talvin Singh. In a spontaneous fashion, the song's strings —and also those of [...] "Come to Me"— were recorded by a fim studio orchestra in India. The lyrics of the track are about the sensitivity of her then boyfriend Dominic Thrupp, with lyrics that have been described as [...] "sweet and just the slightest bit naughty." [...] In the dancefloor-oriented [...] "There's More to Life Than This", Björk leaves romance behind, with [...] "her mischievous side [...] to the fore". Its lyrics were inspired by a party she attended and promptly left. [...] "Like Someone in Love" [...] is one of the several jazz standards the singer recorded with Corky Hale, with her voice [...] "cradled in harp and swoony strings." ...|$|E
500|$|Schwartz {{wrote in}} August 1980 that [...] "...the pilot episode manages to stuff nearly every imaginable aspect of low life into its first hour: prostitution, panhandling, pickpocketing, hostage taking, drug {{addiction}} and, finally, {{the murder of}} two policemen." [...] William Beamon of The Evening Independent noted that the opening episode introduces the audience to {{a vast array of}} characters masterfully intertwined in the storyline in a way that gives the series a [...] "powerful start". A review in the Spartanburg Herald-Journal commented that public defender Davenport's role adds professional intrigue that heightens the provocative nature of their illicit romance. However, The Miami News Jicha speculates that the romance was contrived to make the police show enticing to audiences. Jicha notes that the attack upon the police depicts the uncertainty of the daily life in law enforcement, but that the introduction of Belker's persona shows the writers are a bit out of touch with reality. Buckley's review in The New York Times claimed the episode [...] "veers back and forth between comic situations that aren't funny, serious matters that aren't that convincing and a romance that is merely silly" [...] and stated that various lighting and acting techniques were unsuccessful. The Boston Globe Henry III wrote that [...] "The redeeming virtue is a visual style reminiscent of documentaries — hand-held camera, saturated color, deliberately ragged editing." [...] He also described the show as [...] "a wacky, black-comic and frequently scary portrait of life in <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>city</b> police station". Buckley claimed that the show attempts to present an entire force of police officers with foibles that make them unfit for duty. Henry describes the shooting of the officers as an [...] "appallingly realistic random shooting", but since they were not found for hours, he describes their survival and recovery in the next episode, [...] "Presidential Fever", as miraculous.|$|E
