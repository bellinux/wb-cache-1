5|$|According to {{contemporary}} rumors, Verne and d'Ennery came to difficulties over {{the treatment of}} science in the play, with d'Ennery wanting to condemn scientific research and Verne advocating a more science-friendly <b>and</b> <b>hopeful</b> approach. Verne reportedly cut some especially negative lines out of the script, and protested when d'Ennery had them reinserted for the production. Journey Through the Impossible would be their last collaboration. The play is also Verne's only contribution to the féerie genre.|$|E
5|$|On a {{personal}} level, Grace was still unqualified {{as a doctor}} and had a growing family to support, his daughter Bessie being born in May. When not playing cricket, he had to study a backlog of medical theory. He did not qualify as a doctor {{until the end of}} the following year. He then needed a practice and this was effectively purchased for him by MCC in 1878 after they launched a National Testimonial on his behalf, though the underlying <b>and</b> <b>hopeful</b> purpose of the appeal was to terminate Grace's embarrassing mercenary activity.|$|E

A young student at St. Gall, Ulrich, is said to have visited Wiborada often. She {{supposedly}} prophesied his elevation to the episcopate of Augsburg.|$|E

25|$|Most of Repin's finest portraits were {{produced}} in the 1880s. Through the presentation of real faces, these portraits express the rich, tragical, <b>and</b> <b>hopeful</b> spirit of the period. His portraits of Aleksey Pisemsky (1880), Modest Mussorgsky (1881), and others created throughout the decade have become familiar to whole generations of Russians. Each is completely lifelike, conveying the transient, changeable nature of the sitter's state of mind. They give an intense embodiment of both the physical and spiritual life {{of the people who}} sat for him.|$|E
25|$|Fyodor Sologub was {{the first}} writer to {{introduce}} the morbid, pessimistic elements characteristic of fin de siècle literature and philosophy into Russian prose. His most famous novel, The Petty Demon (1902), {{was an attempt to}} create a living portrait of the concept known in Russian as poshlost' (an idea whose meaning lies somewhere between evil, trashy and banality or kitsch). His next large prose work, A Created Legend (a trilogy consisting of Drops of Blood, Queen Ortruda, and Smoke and Ash), contained many of the same characteristics but presented a considerably more positive <b>and</b> <b>hopeful</b> view of the world.|$|E

25|$|Waiting for {{confirmation}} from the leadership to execute their plans, <b>and</b> <b>hopeful</b> of a {{turn in the}} events, many of the remaining conspirators begin to congregate at the Elevator. Their appearance was scrutinized by a policeman, who became suspicious because the Elevator was ostensibly out of service. Calling for reinforcements, a group of officers detained and arrest the group of men, which included Afonso Costa, António Egas Moniz, Álvaro Poppe, Francisco Correia de Herédia (the Viscount of Ribeira Brava) and others. While José Maria de Alpoim was able to escape to Spain, in all 100 people arrested during the crackdown, including the Viscounts of Pedralva and Ameal, João Pinto dos Santos, Cassiano Neves and Batalha de Freitas. The coup was crushed.|$|E
25|$|During lunchtime, the rain-gods {{visited the}} Gabba and {{confined}} the players indoors till 4:20 pm. The next session of play after that {{was dominated by}} the Indians. Adam Gilchrist, the next batsman in, was usually known to reply with a furious fifty or hundred, but he too, did not hang around for too long, as he lasted for four balls and did not trouble the scorers at all and departed for a duck with the scoreline being 276/6. Again his manner of dismissal was familiar: caught Laxman, bowled Zaheer. Buoyant <b>and</b> <b>hopeful</b> of their prospects of cleaning up the tail after Gilchrist's wicket, the Indians scalped the wicket of Andy Bichel(11 runs) caught by Laxman again, off Agarkar's bowling, then Simon Katich, who had contributed 16 runs to the score, before his nervous stay at the wicket was ended by a tentative poke at a Zaheer delivery to wicket-keeper Parthiv Patel.|$|E

500|$|... "Savior" [...] {{was well}} {{received}} by critics.

Burgess felt that [...] "Savior" [...] was one of three Appeal to Reason tracks that would [...] "satisfy anyone still uneasy about Rise Against's radio aspirations".

In his introduction to the story, Rabkin stated that it [...] "takes the frenzy of exploration and science, paints it green, and frames it with stability." [...] He described the story as having an expansive <b>and</b> <b>hopeful</b> vision of a peaceful world, in contrast to the constant warfare of reality.

500|$|An early {{interpretation}} of the film uses dream analysis to explain that the first part is a dream of the real Diane Selwyn, who has cast her dream-self as the innocent <b>and</b> <b>hopeful</b> [...] "Betty Elms", reconstructing her history and persona into something like an old Hollywood film. In the dream, Betty is successful, charming, and lives the fantasy life of a soon-to-be-famous actress. The last one-fifth of the film presents Diane's real life, in which she has failed both personally and professionally. She arranges for Camilla, an ex-lover, to be killed, and unable {{to cope with the}} guilt, re-imagines her as the dependent, pliable amnesiac Rita. Clues to her inevitable demise, however, continue to appear throughout her dream.|$|E
500|$|Marion Cotillard plays [...] "Mal" [...] Cobb, Dom Cobb's {{projection}} of his guilt over his deceased wife's suicide. As the film's main antagonist, {{she is a}} frequent, malevolent presence in his dreams. Dom is unable to control these projections of her, challenging his abilities as an extractor. Nolan described Mal as [...] "the essence of the femme fatale", the key noir reference in the film. As a [...] "classic femme fatale" [...] her relationship with Cobb is in his mind, a manifestation of Cobb's own neurosis and fear of how little he knows about the woman he loves. DiCaprio praised Cotillard's performance saying that [...] "she can be strong and vulnerable <b>and</b> <b>hopeful</b> and heartbreaking {{all in the same}} moment, which was perfect for all the contradictions of her character".|$|E
500|$|Commentators have {{identified}} numerous works as textual influences, including [...] Eliot's Murder in the Cathedral and Ash Wednesday, [...] Goethe's [...] Faust and [...] Wilfred Owen's [...] poem [...] "The Seed". Tippett's biographer Ian Kemp equates {{the ending of}} the oratorio to the closing pages of Part I of John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress, in which Christian <b>and</b> <b>Hopeful</b> end their journey by crossing a deep and wide river to reach their heavenly home. The influence of Jungian themes is evident in the recurrent images of darkness and light, and the recognition and balancing of opposites. In a recent analysis of the work, Richard Rodda finds A Child of Our Time [...] "rooted in the essential dialectic of human life that Tippett so prized in Jung's philosophy—winter/spring, darkness/light, evil/good, reason/pity, dreams/reality, loneliness/fellowship, the man of destiny/the child of our time..." ...|$|E
