50|$|Q. Because {{they caused}} the righteous to be righteous <b>and</b> the <b>evil</b> to be <b>evil.</b> <b>And</b> {{therefore}} the <b>evil</b> get whipped? A. But {{there must have}} been witnesses who testified that the righteous were <b>evil.</b> <b>And</b> other witnesses came and caused the righteous to be known as righteous as they were before, and caused the previous witnesses to be known as <b>evil.</b> <b>And</b> therefore the <b>evil</b> get whipped.|$|R

5|$|Baldur's Gate II {{is set in}} {{the year}} 1369 DR (Dale Reckoning), and thus takes place not long after the Time of Troubles (1358 DR), when the Tablets of Fate, {{powerful}} magic items which maintain a balance between good <b>and</b> <b>evil,</b> were stolen. Lord Ao, the Overdeity, forced the gods to become mortal until the Tablets were found; some gods died while in this mortal state.|$|E
5|$|Freemasonry has {{attracted}} criticism from theocratic states and organised religions for supposed competition with religion, or supposed heterodoxy within the fraternity itself, and {{has long been}} the target of conspiracy theories, which assert Freemasonry to be an occult <b>and</b> <b>evil</b> power.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1997, Eastwood {{directed}} Midnight in the Garden of Good <b>and</b> <b>Evil,</b> {{based on}} the novel by John Berendt and starring John Cusack, Kevin Spacey, and Jude Law. The film met with a mixed critical response.|$|E

5|$|Like many ancient {{medicinal}} plants (Pliny the Elder describes {{it in his}} Naturalis Historia), great mullein was linked to witches, although the relationship remained generally ambiguous, and the plant was also widely held to ward off curses <b>and</b> <b>evil</b> spirits. The seeds contain several compounds (saponins, glycosides, coumarin, rotenone) that are toxic to fish, and {{have been widely used}} as piscicide for fishing.|$|E
5|$|Scholars of {{religion}} Paul Ingram and Frederick Streng {{argued that the}} teachings of Buddhism challenge Augustine's view of good <b>and</b> <b>evil,</b> proposing a dualism in which good <b>and</b> <b>evil</b> have equal value instead of casting good over evil, as Augustine did. This {{is similar to the}} Manicheist account of good and evil– that the two are equal and in conflict– though Buddhism teaches that the two will come to a final conclusion and transcend the conflict. Ingram and Streng argued that the Augustinian theodicy fails to account for the existence of evil before Adam's sin, which Genesis presents {{in the form of the}} serpent's temptation.|$|E
5|$|Set in Shandong, {{the story}} {{revolves}} around a Chinese scholar, Wang, who becomes infatuated by a demon in disguise as {{a beautiful young}} maiden. They develop a romantic relationship which goes awry after Wang discovers her true identity. Thereafter, a Taoist priest's skills are put {{to the task of}} exorcising the demon; a fight between good <b>and</b> <b>evil</b> ensues.|$|E

5|$|The War of Souls trilogy {{begins as}} a strange storm courses through Krynn, heralding the War of Souls. The {{end of the war}} brings the return of the gods, Takhisis's death, and the {{departure}} of Paladine as head of the good gods {{in order to maintain the}} balance between Good <b>and</b> <b>Evil.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{challenges}} and quests {{were developed to}} keep players occupied while playing through the story. Molyeux told Leach about the ways of good <b>and</b> <b>evil</b> and the system's reflection of the player's behaviour, and provided him with a digital copy of the Bible with instructions to study the concepts due to their connection with gods and men. Leach decided to supplement the idea of evil with mischief, as he thought being completely evil by annoying or killing followers was senseless. Molyneux wanted a conflict between good <b>and</b> <b>evil,</b> and for the enemy gods to have the opposite alignment to the player. As a method of introducing the player to miracles and combat, a god whose alignment {{is the same as}} the player's was added.|$|E
5|$|Written by Russell T. Davies. Planned for {{the sixth}} and seventh episodes of Series 6, it would have seen Bannerman Road being turned into an 'electric city' by Illy, a smart <b>and</b> <b>evil</b> alien.

50|$|Passus 7:Eventually, Truth sends Piers {{a pardon}} for the penitents sins; its main content is Do well and have well and God shall have your soul <b>and</b> Do <b>evil</b> <b>and</b> have <b>evil,</b> <b>and</b> expect {{nothing other than}} that after your death, the Devil shall have your soul. When {{challenged}} on the pardons validity by a priest, Piers angrily tears it in two. Will is awakened by their arguing and, musing on his dreams, decides to seek ‘Do-wel’.|$|R

5|$|A {{common theme}} in the fantasy genre is the battle between good <b>and</b> <b>evil,</b> which Martin rejects for not {{mirroring}} the real world. Attracted to gray characters, Martin instead endorses William Faulkner's view that only the human heart in conflict with itself was worth writing about. Martin explores the questions of redemption and character change in the Ice and Fire series. The multiple viewpoint structure allows characters to be explored from many sides, such that the supposed villains can provide their viewpoint.|$|E
5|$|A {{different}} view of the myth's end focuses on Horus's sole triumph. In this version, Set is not reconciled with his rival, but utterly defeated, and sometimes he is exiled from Egypt or even destroyed. His defeat and humiliation is more pronounced in sources from later periods of Egyptian history, when he was increasingly equated with disorder <b>and</b> <b>evil,</b> and the Egyptians no longer saw him {{as an integral part}} of natural order.|$|E

5000|$|Dualists {{believed}} that historical events {{were the result}} of struggle between a good force <b>and</b> an <b>evil</b> force <b>and</b> that <b>evil</b> ruled the world, though it could be controlled or defeated through asceticism and good works.|$|R
50|$|Dravidian deities are not consorts or {{wives of}} male deities. Poleramma is {{protector}} of borders of villages. She protects borders of villages from disease, drought <b>and</b> <b>evils.</b> Typically a small temple is built in outskirts of temple.|$|R
