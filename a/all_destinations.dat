5|$|Oslo Airport, Gardermoen {{opened on}} 8 October 1998, {{replacing}} the congested Fornebu. For the first time, an airline could receive sufficient landing slots to challenge SAS and Braathens on domestic routes. The low-cost carrier Color Air was established, and started flights from Oslo to Trondheim using Boeing 737-300 aircraft. SAS and Braathens {{also saw the}} opportunity to increase the frequency on the route, and the three airlines between them introduced 39 daily flights. This made the route the fourth-busiest in Europe {{in terms of the}} number of aircraft. During this period, there were 84 daily departures to <b>all</b> <b>destinations</b> from Værnes. Color Air filed for bankruptcy on 27 September 1999, ending a price war which had cost the airlines NOK 3 billion.|$|E

25|$|Milky Way DHDs {{have sparked}} {{numerous}} discussions as {{the design and}} operation of the device has resulted in contradiction. In the Milky Way, the Dial Home Device contains 38 of the 39 symbols on the Stargate, meaning {{there is always a}} missing glyph on each DHD. This missing glyph, however, is not the point of origin for the planet. This means that only certain addresses can be reached from specific positions in the galaxy safely. The only way to intervene and reach <b>all</b> <b>destinations</b> in the Milky Way from a specific stargate, is to manually dial the gate using an external power source. Another method for reaching any stargate is to use a Dialing computer like Stargate Command- however, this could lead to unforeseen side effects such as wormholes traveling through stars or solar flares. DHDs are designed to prevent these incidents from taking place by only allowing access to certain stargates from specific locations in the galaxy.|$|E
