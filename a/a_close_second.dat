5|$|At {{the end of}} August is {{the annual}} American celebration of Labor Day, the only holiday weekend during this period. Of all the year's holiday {{weekends}} it is reliably the weakest in terms of movie box office, with the top grosser for the weekend being the 2007 Rob Zombie-directed reimagining of Halloween, at $30.5 million. The Sixth Sense, then in its fourth week, is <b>a</b> <b>close</b> <b>second</b> after pulling in $29 million in 1999; in a distant second for opening weekends is yet another horror film, 2012's The Possession with $21.1 million.|$|E
5|$|Nixon {{entered his}} name on the New Hampshire primary ballot on January 5, 1972, {{effectively}} announcing his candidacy for reelection. Virtually assured the Republican nomination, the President had initially expected his Democratic opponent to be Massachusetts Senator Ted Kennedy (brother of the late president), but he was largely removed from contention after the 1969 Chappaquiddick incident. Instead, Maine Senator Edmund Muskie became the front runner, with South Dakota Senator George McGovern in <b>a</b> <b>close</b> <b>second</b> place.|$|E

On 2 February 2000, Philippe Binant realised the first digital cinema projection in Europe, with the DLP CINEMA technology developed by Texas Instruments, in Paris.|$|E
5|$|Teams {{choosing}} {{to develop new}} air vehicle types have never won, as they are disadvantaged in comparison to those which adapt existing, working, air vehicles, and can therefore concentrate on performing the mission rather than developing something that will fly at all. As a result, adaptations of conventional rotary wing and fixed wing entries {{have always been the}} overall winners, with airships and ducted fans <b>a</b> <b>close</b> <b>second.</b>|$|E
5|$|A popular product, {{with a lower}} screen {{resolution}} and performance than the two Retina models that followed it but a lighter build and longer battery life, it remained in the Apple line-up as an entry-level iPad model for three years until March 2014, latterly with a silent upgrade to a die-shrunk version of the A5 processor. Its basic design formed {{the core of the}} first iPad mini, which had the same screen pixel count and similar features at a smaller size. The iPad 2 has been able to run six major versions of iOS, from 4 to 9, the only iOS device {{to be able to do}} so. The iPhone 4S is <b>a</b> <b>close</b> <b>second</b> with support from iOS 5 to iOS 9, as well as the iPhone 5, which was supported from iOS 6 to iOS 10.|$|E

5|$|The most {{successful}} film to open during Super Bowl weekend is the 2008 concert film , which took in $31.1 million, {{almost half the}} total it would earn during a released limited to just that weekend and the following week. In <b>a</b> <b>close</b> <b>second</b> is Dear John, grossing $30.5 million in 2010, for the strongest Super Bowl weekend opening for a conventional release. Both films had strong appeal to female moviegoers, an audience more receptive to moviegoing on a weekend dominated by a sporting event. The 2008 action film Taken, which Cargill noted for its success in appealing to an older audience, took in $24.7 million on its opening weekend {{on its way to}} total receipts of over $100 million, making it a distant third.|$|E
