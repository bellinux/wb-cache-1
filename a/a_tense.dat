5|$|The {{main title}} music, <b>a</b> <b>tense,</b> hurtling piece, {{sets the tone}} of {{impending}} violence, and returns three times on the soundtrack. Though nothing shocking occurs during the first 15–20 minutes of the film, the title music remains in the audience's mind, lending tension to these early scenes. Herrmann also maintains tension through the slower moments in the film {{through the use of}} ostinato.|$|E
5|$|Argentina had <b>a</b> <b>tense</b> {{relationship}} with the United Kingdom because of the recently ended Falklands War. The British government banned all foreign ships from the exclusion zone of the islands in 1986. Argentina organised air and marine patrols, as well as military maneuvers in the Patagonia. However, this {{was not enough to}} placate the military hard-liners in Argentina. Alfonsín proposed the postponement the sovereignty discussions, instead negotiating for a de jure cease of hostilities, with a {{reduction in the number of}} military forces and a normalization of Argentina–United Kingdom relations. The United Kingdom did not trust the proposal, suspecting that it was a cover-up for sovereignty discussions.|$|E

5|$|As Buchenwald was {{a forced}} labor camp, the German {{authorities}} {{had intended to}} put the 168 airmen to work as slave-labor in the nearby armament factories. Consequently, Lamason was ordered by an SS officer to instruct the airmen to work, or he would be immediately executed by firing squad. Lamason refused to give the order and informed the officer that they were soldiers and could not and would not participate in war production. After <b>a</b> <b>tense</b> stand-off, during which time Lamason {{thought he would be}} shot, the SS officer eventually backed down.|$|E
5|$|Enterprising programmers {{were able}} to produce games for the ZX81 using nothing more than text {{characters}} and the machine's limited text semigraphics. Some ZX81 games achieved lasting fame, such as 3D Monster Maze, <b>a</b> <b>tense</b> first-person perspective game that involved the player escaping a labyrinth with a Tyrannosaurus rex in pursuit. Written in a combination of BASIC and machine code, its innovative design led it to be hailed as the first home computer 3D game and a landmark {{in the history of}} computer and video games.|$|E

5|$|In 1992, {{eight years}} after their last {{official}} series, South Africa hosted New Zealand in a one-off test match. The resumption of international rugby in South Africa came after {{the dismantling of the}} apartheid system, and was only done with permission of the African National Congress. With their return to test rugby, South Africa were selected to host the 1995 Rugby World Cup. After upsetting Australia in the opening match, South Africa continued to advance through the tournament until they met New Zealand in the final. After <b>a</b> <b>tense</b> final that went into extra time, South Africa emerged 15–12 winners, with then President Nelson Mandela, wearing a Springbok jersey, presenting the trophy to South Africa's captain, Francois Pienaar.|$|E

5|$|Newman {{himself had}} been {{regarded}} as a possible terrorist abduction target during the October Crisis, and armed guards had patrolled {{the headquarters of the}} NFB. Newman was concerned about the idea of releasing films with Quebec nationalist themes, such as Groulx's 24 heures ou plus, at such <b>a</b> <b>tense</b> political time, worried about what the Canadian public would think. Although it was Newman's deputy André Lamy who in some cases drew the monolingual Newman's attention to the controversial nature of French language productions, it was Lamy himself who later permitted the release of some of these same films after he succeeded Newman as Government Film Commissioner.|$|E
5|$|O'Neill was {{omitted from}} the squad that toured South Africa in 1966–67, ending his Test career.

He started the season with 117 against Western Australia, before scoring a pair of 78s in the return match, helping his team to <b>a</b> <b>tense</b> 13-run win.

5|$|According to Louis Philippe, the game's audio director, {{the team}} {{originally}} used intense music and sounds to create tension. However, the team decided to scrap this idea, {{realizing that the}} best way to create <b>a</b> <b>tense</b> atmosphere is to create the sounds of other players, which are often unexpected. The team created Navigation Sounds, in which the sound a player made is determined by their operators' weight, armor, and speed. Gadget deployment such as fortifying and breach-charging create louder sounds that may reveal the player's presence. The team thought that this would be enjoyable for players and influence their gameplay experience. The game's music was composed by Paul Haslinger, who had worked on the score of the previous Rainbow Six games and the Far Cry series. His co-composer was Ben Frost, who debuted his first video game soundtrack with Siege. Leon Purviance assisted Frost and Haslinger in composing the music.|$|E

However, he sandbags her prospective candidacy by endorsing a political ally's daughter, {{in order to keep}} Claire focused on his campaign. Claire retaliates on the day the South Carolina primary by covertly leaking a photo of Frank's father with a Klansman, imperiling Frank's candidacy. Frank figures out that she was behind the leak and confronts her. Claire calmly admits what she did and proposes that she join him in the ticket as his vice president. Frank rejects the idea.|$|E
5|$|Although Morton {{was able}} to keep the state united during {{the first phase of the}} war, once {{emancipation}} became an issue in 1862, the Republicans suffered a major defeat in the mid-term elections, and Morton lost the support of the strong Democratic majority in the legislature. Before the new legislature convened in 1863, Morton began circulating reports that the Democrats intended to seize control of the state government, secede from the Union, and instigate riots. The Democrats responded with harsh criticisms of Morton and Lincoln, the conduct of the war, and the issues of emancipation and the loss of constitutional rights, among others. Accusations on both sides created <b>a</b> <b>tense</b> atmosphere that only worsened relation between the two parties and guaranteed further confrontations.|$|E
50|$|In Georgian, a Kartvelian language, {{the main}} {{function}} of a preverb is to distinguish the present tenses and the future <b>tenses.</b> To turn <b>a</b> present <b>tense</b> verb into <b>a</b> future <b>tense,</b> <b>a</b> preverb {{is added to the}} verb compound.

40|$|AbstractHere a group algebra {{is always}} the group algebra of a finite group over a {{commutative}} field. We consider connections between three kinds of factorizations: writing {{the group as a}} direct product of subgroups; writing the group algebra as <b>a</b> <b>tenser</b> product of subalgebras; and writing the regular module (the group algebra viewed as a module over itself) as <b>a</b> <b>tenser</b> product of modules. In the principal result the field has prime characteristic, the group order is a power of this prime, and the group is abelian. If in these circumstances the regular module is isomorphic to <b>a</b> <b>tenser</b> product of two modules, then the group has a direct decomposition with one (direct factor) subgroup acting regularly on one of the (tenser factor) modules and the other subgroup acting regularly on the other module. Moreover, the module varieties of the tenser factors must be linear subspaces of the vector space which is the variety of the trivial module, and the two subspaces must form a direct decomposition of that space...|$|R
