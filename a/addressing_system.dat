When an international standard for address is developed, it shall be considered that <b>address</b> <b>systems</b> and <b>address</b> names are deeply related with cultural/historical/social/legal systems. Besides, it is noted that standardization of <b>address</b> <b>system</b> itself may not be so difficult in abstract level; however implementation and continual management of address database as an application of address standard may face challenges and difficulties. 1...|$|R
5000|$|Besides their {{practical}} implications, public <b>address</b> <b>systems,</b> including megaphones, {{also had}} a social impact. Public <b>address</b> <b>systems</b> helped promote women’s participation in society. In events like the National Republican and Democratic Conventions of 1920, when electronic public <b>address</b> <b>systems</b> were first becoming popularized, women used these amplifying technologies during roll call of participants. [...] Later, portable electric megaphones extended this equalizing influence to outdoor events.|$|R
25|$|The {{evolution}} {{towards the}} net/node addressing scheme was also useful for reducing communications costs between continents, where timezone differences on {{either end of}} the connection might also come into play. For instance, the best time to forward mail in the US was at night, but that might not be the best time for European hosts to exchange. Efforts towards introducing a continental level to the <b>addressing</b> <b>system</b> started in 1986.|$|E
25|$|The <b>addressing</b> <b>system</b> in Alexandria is not {{uniform and}} {{reflects}} {{the consolidation of}} several originally separate communities into a single city. In Old Town Alexandria, building numbers are assigned north and south from King Street and west (only) from the Potomac River. In the areas formerly {{in the town of}} Potomac, such as Del Ray and St. Elmo, building numbers are assigned east and west from Commonwealth Avenue and north (only) from King Street. In the western parts of the city, building numbers are assigned north and south from Duke Street.|$|E

The job involved not just the signing but given the complexity of horizontal and vertical streets intersecting, working out the most efficient <b>addressing</b> <b>system</b> {{for the benefit of}} the postmen and residents. The task was managed be Andrew Haig. The signs used a slab serif version of Margaret Calvert's Rail font, which was later called Calvert and used on the Tyne and Wear Metro in 1980.|$|E

25|$|The city is {{laid out}} on a grid-based street system. Streets run north-south and avenues run east-west. Streets are {{numbered}} by their block distance east or west of Main Street. Similarly, Avenues are numbered {{north and south of}} Central Avenue. There are four city quadrants (NW, SW, SE, NE) to describe the exact location of any given address. Main Street addresses are simply designated North and South. Central Avenue addresses are simply designated East and West. The grid <b>addressing</b> <b>system</b> carries over into the rural areas of Ward County, making the county one of only three that do not follow the statewide grid system in North Dakota (the others being Burleigh County and Grand Forks County).|$|E
25|$|As Japan and the Korean {{peninsula}} became politically centralized in the 7th century AD, those societies adopted Chinese grid-planning {{principles in}} numerous locations. In Korea, Gyeongju, {{the capital of}} Unified Silla, and Sanggyeong, the capital of Balhae, adapted the Tang Dynasty Chinese model. The ancient capitals of Japan, such as Fujiwara-Kyô (AD 694-710), Nara (Heijô-Kyô, AD 710-784), and Kyoto (Heian-Kyô, AD 794-1868) also adapted from Tang's capital, Chang'an. However, for reasons of defense, the planners of Tokyo eschewed the grid, opting instead for an irregular network of streets surrounding the Edo Castle grounds. In later periods, some parts of Tokyo were grid-planned, but grid plans are generally rare in Japan, and the Japanese <b>addressing</b> <b>system</b> is accordingly based on increasingly fine subdivisions, rather than a grid.|$|E

[...] While the system may appear complex, once learned it allows one to pinpoint not only where one is but also where and how far one may need to travel. For example, if one needed to find 633 A Street SE, the address informs that the address is southeast of the Capitol, with A Street one block south of East Capitol Street, and that the location on that street is on the 600 block, which is between 6th Street and 7th Street SE.|$|E
