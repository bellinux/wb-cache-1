60|$|Interrupted by {{an audible}} gasp of shock from a spinster-appearing female sunning herself hard by and <b>angularly</b> {{in the sand}} in a {{swimming}} suit monstrously unbeautiful, Lee Barton was aware of an involuntary and almost perceptible stiffening {{on the part of}} his wife.|$|E
60|$|Carina, long, {{internally}} deeply concave, <b>angularly</b> bent, {{the lower}} portion slightly longer and {{wider than the}} upper part; the two halves meet each other at about an angle of 135°; the upper half {{is parallel to the}} longer axis of the terga, between which it extends for three fourths of their length. The external surface is rounded, except near the umbo, where the edge is carinated; growth almost equally upwards and downwards; the parietes and tectum are not separated by ridges.|$|E
60|$|Carina, {{laterally}} broad, <b>angularly</b> bent; slightly widening {{from the}} apex to the base; internally, deeply concave. The {{position of the}} umbo varies, in young specimens it is seated at the uppermost point, and consequently in such there is no upward growth; in older specimens, from the junction and upward production of that part {{on each side of}} the valve, which I have called in fossil specimens the intra-parietes, the valve is added to above the umbo, but to a lesser degree than in S. vulgare. Slight ridges separate the roof from the parietes, and the parietes from the intra-parietes.|$|E
6000|$|I {{will only}} allude to one other case, already discussed. Now {{that we know}} that the wild parent of the ass {{commonly}} has striped legs, we may feel confident that the occasional appearance of stripes on the legs of the domestic ass is due to reversion; but this will not account for {{the lower end of the}} shoulder- stripe being sometimes <b>angularly</b> bent or slightly forked. So, again, when we see dun and other coloured horses with stripes on the spine, shoulders, and legs, we are led, from reasons formerly given, to believe that they reappear through reversion to the wild parent-horse. But when horses have two or three shoulder-stripes, with one of them occasionally forked at the lower end, or when they have stripes on their faces, or are faintly striped as foals over nearly their whole bodies, with the stripes <b>angularly</b> bent one under the other on the forehead, or irregularly branched in other parts, it would be rash to attribute such diversified characters to the reappearance of those proper to the aboriginal wild horse. As three African species of the genus are much striped, and as we have seen that the crossing of the unstriped species often leads to the hybrid offspring being conspicuously striped--bearing also in mind that the act of crossing certainly causes the reappearance of long-lost characters--it is a more probable view that the above-specified stripes are due to reversion, not to the immediate wild parent-horse, but to the striped progenitor of the whole genus.] ...|$|E
60|$|In some of {{the lower}} crustaceans, the {{right-hand}} anterior antenna of the male differs greatly in structure from the left-hand one, the latter resembling in its simple tapering joints the antennæ of the female. In the male the modified antenna is either swollen in the middle or <b>angularly</b> bent, or converted (fig. 3) into an elegant, and sometimes wonderfully complex, prehensile organ.[414] It serves, as I hear from Sir J. Lubbock, to hold the female, and for this same purpose {{one of the two}} posterior legs (b) {{on the same side of}} the body is converted into a forceps. In another family the inferior or posterior antennæ are “curiously zigzagged” in the males alone.|$|E
60|$|The first boat-load {{from the}} yacht emerged {{floating}} {{slowly into the}} pool of purple light wavering round the brig on the black water. Two men squeezed in the bows pulled uncomfortably; in the middle, on a heap of seamen's canvas bags, another sat, insecure, propped with both arms, stiff-legged, <b>angularly</b> helpless. The light from the poop brought everything out in lurid detail, and the boat floating slowly toward the brig had a suspicious and pitiful aspect. The shabby load lumbering her looked somehow {{as if it had}} been stolen by those men who resembled castaways. In the sternsheets Carter, standing up, steered with his leg. He had a smile of youthful sarcasm.|$|E
60|$|The {{occipital}} foramen (figure 10) presents some remarkable differences: in {{the wild}} rabbit, the lower edge between the condyles is considerably and almost <b>angularly</b> hollowed out, and the upper edge is deeply and squarely notched; hence the longitudinal axis exceeds the transverse axis. In the skulls of the lop-eared rabbits the transverse axis exceeds the longitudinal; for in none of these skulls was the lower edge between the condyles so deeply hollowed out; in five of them there was no upper square notch, in three there was a trace of the notch, and in two alone it was well developed. These differences {{in the shape of}} the foramen are remarkable, considering that it gives passage to so important a structure as the spinal marrow, though apparently the outline of the latter is not affected by the shape of the passage.|$|E
60|$|This species climbs well. The tendrils after {{clasping}} a stick become {{thicker and}} more rigid; but the blunt hooks do not turn and adapt {{themselves to the}} supporting surface, as is done in so perfect a manner by some Bignoniaceae and Cobaea. The tendrils of young plants, two or three feet in height, are only half the length of those borne by the same plant when grown taller, {{and they do not}} contract spirally after clasping a support, but only become slightly flexuous. Full-sized tendrils, on the other hand, contract spirally, {{with the exception of the}} thick basal portion. Tendrils which have caught nothing simply bend downwards and inwards, like the extremities of the leaves of the Corydalis claviculata. But in all cases the petiole after a time is <b>angularly</b> and abruptly bent downwards like that of Eccremocarpus.|$|E
60|$|The {{shoulder}} stripe on the ass {{is sometimes}} double, and Mr. Blyth has seen even {{three or four}} parallel stripes. (2/48. 'Journal As. Soc. of Bengal' volume 28 1860 page 231. Martin on the Horse page 205.) I have observed in ten cases shoulder-stripes abruptly truncated at the lower end, with the anterior angle produced into a tapering point, precisely as in the above dun Devonshire pony. I have seen three cases of the terminal portion abruptly and <b>angularly</b> bent; and have seen and heard of four cases of a distinct though slight forking of the stripe. In Syria, Dr. Hooker and his party observed for me no less than five similar instances of the shoulder- stripe plainly bifurcating over the fore leg. In the common mule it likewise sometimes bifurcates. When I first noticed the forking and angular bending of the shoulder-stripe, I had seen enough of the stripes in the various equine species to feel convinced that even a character so unimportant as this had a distinct meaning, and was thus led {{to attend to the}} subject. I now find that in the E. burchellii and quagga, the stripe which corresponds with the shoulder-stripe of the ass, {{as well as some of}} the stripes on the neck, bifurcate, and that some of those near the shoulder have their extremities bent <b>angularly</b> backwards. The bifurcation and angular bending of the stripes on the shoulders apparently are connected with the nearly upright stripes on the sides of the body and neck changing their direction and becoming transverse on the legs. Finally, we see that the presence of shoulder, leg, and spinal stripes in the horse,-- their occasional absence in the ass,--the occurrence of double and triple shoulder-stripes in both animals, and the similar manner in which these stripes terminate downwards,--are all cases of analogous variation in the horse and ass. These cases are probably not due to similar conditions acting on similar constitutions, but to a partial reversion in colour to the common progenitor of the genus. We shall hereafter return to this subject, and discuss it more fully.|$|E
6000|$|Professor E.S. Morse of Salem, Mass., {{found that}} most of the New England marine mollusca were protectively coloured; instancing among others a little red chiton on rocks clothed with red {{calcareous}} algae, and Crepidula plana, living within the apertures of the shells of larger species of Gasteropods and of a pure white colour corresponding to its habitat, while allied species living on seaweed or on the outside of dark shells were dark brown.[77] A still more interesting case has been recorded by Mr. George Brady. He says: [...] "Amongst the Nullipore which matted together the laminaria roots in the Firth of Clyde were living numerous small starfishes (Ophiocoma bellis) which, except when their writhing movements betrayed them, were quite undistinguishable from the calcareous branches of the alga; their rigid <b>angularly</b> twisted rays had all the appearance of the coralline, and exactly assimilated to its dark purple colour, so that though I held in my hand a root in which were half a dozen of the starfishes, I was really unable to detect them until revealed by their movements."[78] ...|$|E
60|$|Gashford, the secretary, was taller, <b>angularly</b> made, high-shouldered, bony, and ungraceful.

His manner was smooth and humble, but very sly and slinking. He wore the aspect {{of a man who was}} always lying in wait for something that WOULDN'T come to pass; but he looked patient--very patient--and fawned like a spaniel dog. Even now, while he warmed and rubbed his hands before the blaze, he had the air of one who only presumed to enjoy it in his degree as a commoner; and though he knew his lord was not regarding him, he looked into his face from time to time, and with a meek and deferential manner, smiled as if for practice.|$|E
6000|$|Since {{everything}} seemed lost in Sulaco (and {{that was the}} feeling of his waking), the idea of leaving the country altogether had presented itself to Nostromo. At that thought he had seen, like the beginning of another dream, a vision of steep and tideless shores, with dark pines on the heights and white houses low down near a very blue sea. He saw the quays of a big port, where the coasting feluccas, with their lateen sails outspread like motionless wings, enter gliding silently {{between the end of}} long moles of squared blocks that project <b>angularly</b> towards each other, hugging a cluster of shipping to the superb bosom of a hill covered with palaces. He remembered these sights not without some filial emotion, though he had been habitually and severely beaten as a boy on one of these feluccas by a short-necked, shaven Genoese, with a deliberate and distrustful manner, who (he firmly believed) had cheated him out of his orphan's inheritance. But it is mercifully decreed that the evils of the past should appear but faintly in retrospect. Under the sense of loneliness, abandonment, and failure, the idea of return to these things appeared tolerable. But, what? Return? With bare feet and head, with one check shirt and a pair of cotton calzoneros for all worldly possessions? ...|$|E
60|$|In the full-grown {{creature}} {{the skull}} will measure {{at least twenty}} feet in length. Unhinge the lower jaw, and the side view of this skull is as the side view of a moderately inclined plane resting throughout on a level base. But in life--as we have elsewhere seen--this inclined plane is <b>angularly</b> filled up, and almost squared by the enormous superincumbent mass of the junk and sperm. At the high end the skull forms a crater to bed {{that part of the}} mass; while under the long floor of this crater--in another cavity seldom exceeding ten inches in length and as many in depth reposes the mere handful of this monster's brain. The brain is at least twenty feet from his apparent forehead in life; it is hidden away behind its vast outworks, like the innermost citadel within the amplified fortifications of Quebec. So like a choice casket is it secreted in him, that I have known some whalemen who peremptorily deny that the Sperm Whale has any other brain than that palpable semblance of one formed by the cubic-yards of his sperm magazine. Lying in strange folds, courses, and convolutions, to their apprehensions, it seems more in keeping with the idea of his general might to regard that mystic part of him as the seat of his intelligence.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Nicholas Smith, while United States Consul at Liege, wrote, or caused to be written, an {{official}} report, wickedly, willfully and maliciously designed to abridge the privileges, augment the ills and impair the honorable {{status of the}} domestic dog. In {{the very beginning of}} this report Mr. Smith manifests his animus by stigmatizing the domestic dog as an [...] "hereditary loafer;" [...] and having hurled the allegation, affirms [...] "the dawn of a [Belgian] new era" [...] wherein the pampered menial will loaf no more. There is to be no more sun-soaking on door mats having a southern exposure, no more usurpation of the warmest segment of the family circle, no more successful personal solicitation of cheer at the domestic board. The dog's place in the social scale is no longer to be determined by consideration of sentiment, but will be the result of cold commercial calculation, and so fixed as best to serve the ends of industrial expediency. All this in Belgium, where the dog is already in active service as a beast of burden and draught; doubtless the transition to that humble condition from his present and immemorial social elevation in less advanced countries will be slow and characterized by bitter factional strife. America, especially, though ever accessible to the infection of new and profitable ideas, will be <b>angularly</b> slow to accept so radical a subversion of a social superstructure that almost may be said to rest upon the domestic dog as a basic verity.|$|E
60|$|The King's march, {{through the}} Forest of Reppen, {{was nothing like}} so expeditious as had been expected. There are thickets, intricacies, runlets, boggy oozes; {{indifferent}} to one man well mounted, but vitally important to 30,000 with heavy cannon to bring on. Boggy oozings especially,--there is one dirty stream or floss (HUNERFLIESS, Hen-Floss) which wanders dismally through those recesses, issuing from the far south, with dirty daughters dismally wandering into it, and others that cannot get into it (being of the lake kind): these, in their weary, circling, recircling course towards Oder,--FAULE LAACKE (Foul Lake, LITHER-MERE, as it were), Foul Bridge, Swine's Nook (SCHWEINEBUCKT), and many others,--occasion endless difficulty. Whether Major Linden was shot that day, or what became of him after, I do not know: but it was pity he had not studied {{the ground with a}} soldier's eye instead of a hunter's! Plumping suddenly, at last, upon Hen-Floss itself, Friedrich has to turn angularly; <b>angularly,</b> which occasions great delay: the heavy cannon (wall-guns brought from Custrin) have twelve horses each, and cannot turn among the trees, but have to be unyoked, reyoked, turned round by hand:--in short, it was eight in the morning before Friedrich arrived {{at the edge of the}} wood, on the Klosterberg, Walckberg, and other woody BERGS or knolls, within reach of Muhlberg, and behind the preliminary abatis there (abatis which was rather of service to him than otherwise);--and began privately building his batteries.|$|E
60|$|The {{leaves are}} of large size. Each bears {{three pairs of}} lateral {{leaflets}} and a terminal one, all supported on rather long sub- petioles. The main petiole bends a little <b>angularly</b> downwards at each point where a pair of leaflets arises (see fig. 2), and the petiole of the terminal leaflet is bent downwards at right angles; hence the whole petiole, with its rectangularly bent extremity, acts as a hook. This hook, the lateral petioles being directed a little upwards; forms an excellent grappling apparatus, by which the leaves readily become entangled with surrounding objects. If they catch nothing, the whole petiole ultimately grows straight. The main petiole, the sub-petioles, and the three branches into which each basi-lateral sub-petiole is generally subdivided, are all sensitive. The basal portion of the main petiole, between the stem and the first pair of leaflets, is less sensitive than the remainder; it will, however, clasp a stick with which it is left in contact. The inferior surface of the rectangularly bent terminal portion (carrying the terminal leaflet), which forms the inner side {{of the end of}} the hook, is the most sensitive part; and this portion is manifestly best adapted to catch a distant support. To show the difference in sensibility, I gently placed loops of string of the same weight (in one instance weighing only 0.82 of a grain or 53.14 mg.) on the several lateral sub-petioles and on the terminal one; in a few hours the latter was bent, but after 24 hrs. no effect was produced on the other sub-petioles. Again, a terminal sub-petiole placed in contact with a thin stick became sensibly curved in 45 m., and in 1 hr. 10m. moved through ninety degrees; whilst a lateral sub-petiole did not become sensibly curved until 3 hrs. 30 m. had elapsed. In all cases, if the sticks are taken away, the petioles continue to move during many hours afterwards; so they do after a slight rubbing; but they become straight again, after about a day's interval, that is if the flexure has not been very great or long continued.|$|E
60|$|She {{could not}} console him; he grieved over her changed {{circumstances}} {{with far more}} regret than she felt, and though glad for her sake {{that she should be}} with those whom he could trust, yet his connection with her employers seemed to him undutiful towards his late rector. All that she saw of them reassured her. The family manners were full of well-bred good-humour, full of fun, with high intelligence, much real refinement, and no pretension. The father was the most polished, with the scholarly courtesy of the dignified clergyman; the mother was the most simple and caressing; the daughter somewhat uncouth, readily betraying both her feelings and her cleverness and drollery {{in the style of the}} old friend whom Lucilla was amused to see treated as a youth and almost a contemporary of her pupil. What chiefly diverted her was the grotesque aspect of Dr. Prendergast and his daughter. Both were on a large scale, with immense mouths, noses turned up to display wide nostrils, great gray eyes, <b>angularly</b> set, yellow hair and eyebrows, red complexions, and big bones. The Doctor had the advantage of having outgrown the bloom of his ugliness; his forehead was bald and dignified, his locks softened by grizzling, and his fine expression and clerical figure would have carried off all the quaintness of his features if they had not been so comically caricatured in his daughter; yet she looked so full of life and character that Lucilla was attracted, and sure of getting on well with her. Moreover, the little elf felt the impression she was creating in this land of Brobdignag. Sarah was looking at her as a terra-cotta pitcher might regard a cup of egg-shell china, and Lucy had never been lovelier. Her mourning enhanced the purity of her white skin, and marked her slender faultless shape; her flaxen hair hung in careless wreaths of ringlet and braid; her countenance, if pale, had greater sweetness in its dejection, now and then brightened by gleams of her courageous spirit. Sarah gazed with untiring wonder, pardoning Cousin Peter for disturbing the contemplation of Domenichino's art, since here was a witness that heroines of romance were no mere myths, but that beings of ivory and rose, sapphire eyes and golden hair, might actually walk the earth.|$|E
6000|$|The two {{hundredth}} {{anniversary of}} Henry Fielding is very justly celebrated, even if, {{as far as}} can be discovered, it is only celebrated by the newspapers. It {{would be too much}} to expect that any such merely chronological incident should induce the people who write about Fielding to read him; this kind of neglect is only another name for glory. A great classic means a man whom one can praise without having read. This is not in itself wholly unjust; it merely implies a certain respect for the realisation and fixed conclusions of the mass of mankind. I have never read Pindar (I mean I have never read the Greek Pindar; Peter Pindar I have read all right), but the mere fact that I have not read Pindar, I think, ought not to prevent me and certainly would not prevent me from talking of [...] "the masterpieces of Pindar," [...] or of [...] "great poets like Pindar or Æschylus." [...] The very learned men are <b>angularly</b> unenlightened on this as on many other subjects; and the position they take up is really quite unreasonable. If any ordinary journalist or man of general reading alludes to Villon or to Homer, they consider it a quite triumphant sneer to say to the man, [...] "You cannot read mediæval French," [...] or [...] "You cannot read Homeric Greek." [...] But it is not a triumphant sneer--or, indeed, a sneer at all. A man has got as much right to employ in his speech the established and traditional facts of human history as he has to employ any other piece of common human information. And it is as reasonable for a man who knows no French to assume that Villon was a good poet as it would be for a man who has no ear for music to assume that Beethoven was a good musician. Because he himself has no ear for music, that is no reason why he should assume that the human race has no ear for music. Because I am ignorant (as I am), it does not follow that I ought to assume that I am deceived. The man who would not praise Pindar unless he had read him would be a low, distrustful fellow, the worst kind of sceptic, who doubts not only God, but man. He would be like a man who could not call Mount Everest high unless he had climbed it. He would be like a man who would not admit that the North Pole was cold until he had been there.|$|E
60|$|In short, {{not having}} taken my own pet {{national}} pint pot {{with me to}} this Fair, I was very well satisfied with the measure of simple enjoyment that it poured into the dull French-Flemish country life. How dull that is, I had an opportunity of considering--when the Fair was over--when the tri-coloured flags were withdrawn from {{the windows of the}} houses on the Place where the Fair was held--when the windows were close shut, apparently until next Fair-time--when the Hotel de Ville had cut off its gas and put away its eagle--when the two paviours, whom I take to form the entire paving population of the town, were ramming down the stones which had been pulled up for the erection of decorative poles--when the jailer had slammed his gate, and sulkily locked himself in with his charges. But then, as I paced the ring which marked the track of the departed hobby-horses on the market-place, pondering in my mind how long some hobby-horses do leave their tracks in public ways, and how difficult they are to erase, my eyes were greeted with a goodly sight. I beheld four male personages thoughtfully pacing the Place together, in the sunlight, evidently not belonging to the town, and having upon them a certain loose cosmopolitan air of not belonging to any town. One was clad in a suit of white canvas, another in a cap and blouse, the third in an old military frock, the fourth in a shapeless dress that {{looked as if it had}} been made out of old umbrellas. All wore dust-coloured shoes. My heart beat high; for, in those four male personages, although complexionless and eyebrowless, I beheld four subjects of the Family P. Salcy. Blue- bearded though they were, and bereft of the youthful smoothness of cheek which is imparted by what is termed in Albion a 'Whitechapel shave' (and which is, in fact, whitening, judiciously applied to the jaws with the palm of the hand), I recognised them. As I stood admiring, there emerged from the yard of a lowly Cabaret, the excellent Ma Mere, Ma Mere, with the words, 'The soup is served;' words which so elated the subject in the canvas suit, that when they all ran in to partake, he went last, dancing with his hands stuck <b>angularly</b> into the pockets of his canvas trousers, after the Pierrot manner. Glancing down the Yard, the last I saw of him was, that he looked in through a window (at the soup, no doubt) on one leg.|$|E
60|$|The bulk {{of solid}} rock {{which has been}} removed in the lower parts of the valleys of the Cordillera has been enormous. It is only by {{reflecting}} on such cases {{as that of the}} gravel beds of Patagonia, covering so many thousand square leagues of surface, and which, if heaped into a ridge, would form a mountain-range almost equal to the Cordillera, that the amount of denudation becomes credible. The valleys within this range often follow anticlinal but rarely synclinal lines; that is, the strata on the two sides more often dip from the line of valley than towards it. On the flanks of the range, the valleys most frequently run neither along anticlinal nor synclinal axes, but along lines of flexure or faults: that is, the strata on both sides dip in the same direction, but with different, though often only slightly different, inclinations. As most of the nearly parallel ridges which together form the Cordillera run approximately north and south, the east and west valleys cross them in zig-zag lines, bursting through the points where the strata have been least inclined. No doubt the greater part of the denudation was affected at the periods when tidal- creeks occupied the valleys, and when the outer flanks of the mountains were exposed to the full force of an open ocean. I have already alluded {{to the power of the}} tidal action in the channels connecting great bays; and I may here mention that one of the surveying vessels in a channel of this kind, though under sail, was whirled round and round by the force of the current. We shall hereafter see, that of the two main ridges forming the Chilean Cordillera, the eastern and loftiest one owes the greater part of its ANGULAR upheaval to a period subsequent to the elevation of the western ridge; and it is likewise probable that many of the other parallel ridges have been <b>angularly</b> upheaved at different periods; consequently many parts of the surfaces of these mountains must formerly have been exposed to the full force of the waves, which, if the Cordillera were now sunk into the sea, would be protected by parallel chains of islands. The torrents in the valleys certainly have great power in wearing the rocks; as could be told by the dull rattling sound of the many fragments night and day hurrying downwards; and as was attested by the vast size of certain fragments, which I was assured had been carried onwards during floods; yet we have seen in the lower parts of the valleys, that the torrents have seldom removed all the sea-checked shingle forming the terraces, and have had time since the last elevation in mass only to cut in the underlying rocks, gorges, deep and narrow, but quite insignificant in dimensions compared with the entire width and depth of the valleys.|$|E
60|$|Description.--The Capitulum is much compressed, and {{generally}} produced upwards; it is formed of from twelve to fifteen valves, which are rather thin, {{and with the}} exception of S. ornatum, almost entirely covered by membrane, bearing spines: the valves are seldom locked very closely together. A sub-rostrum exists only in S. villosum, which species leads on to Pollicipes; in S. vulgare the rostrum is rudimentary and hidden. The scuta, terga and carina, are much larger than the other valves: these five valves seem to differ essentially from the others in being at first developed under the form of the so-called primordial valves: the other valves commence by a small indistinct brown spot, very different from the hexagonal tissue of the primordial valves: I saw this very clearly in young specimens of S. vulgare. At first, the scuta, terga and carina, grow exclusively downwards (and permanently so in most fossil species), and therefore the growth of the scuta and carina is in an absolutely opposite direction to what it is in Lepas, Pæcilasma and Dichelaspis. After a short period the scuta are added to at their upper ends; the portion thus added, stands at a rather lower level, and projects in a rather different direction from the first-formed part of the valve, giving to it, in some respects, the appearance of having been broken and mended. This structure is common to S. vulgare, S. rostratum and S. Peronii. The upper Latera (except in S. villosum) grow in the same manner, namely, at first exclusively downwards, and then both upwards and downwards. The rostral and carinal latera (with the same exception of S. villosum) have their umbones seated laterally, at opposite ends of the capitulum,--the umbones of the rostral latera being close to the rostrum, and those of the carinal pair close to the carina, and consequently their chief growth is directed towards each other. The carina in all the species, except S. villosum, is either bowed or <b>angularly</b> bent; in the latter case the lower half is parallel to the peduncle, and the upper half, extending far up between the terga, is parallel to their longer axes. In some of the species the carina is added to almost equally at both ends; in S. ornatum it grows but little at the upper end, and to a varying degree in different individuals according to their age; in S. rutilum the umbo is at the apex, and there is consequently no upward growth; lastly, in S. villosum the carina widening much from the apex to the basal margin, grows exclusively downwards, and a portion of the apex projects freely,--characters all common to the carina in the genus Pollicipes. The upper latera occur in all the species; in the lower whorl there are either two or three pair of latera, in the former case the infra-median pair being absent. The latera differ considerably in shape in the different species.|$|E
