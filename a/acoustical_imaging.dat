Sensory experiments suggest a great degree of cross-modal integration in the processing of shapes between echolocative and visual areas of the brain.

However, these instruments have followed the traditional configuration and, for the most part, have remained shipboard mounted. The past five years has seen unprecedented growth in the development of low power digital microprocessor, storage and data acquisition technologies.

The semiotics of isolated sounds was evidenced by performing fundamental studies using a combined <b>acoustical</b> and brain <b>imaging</b> (Event Related Poten- tials) approach. The perceptual cues (which are known as invariants) responsible for the evocations elicited by the sounds generated by impacts, moving sound sour- ces, dynamic events and vehicles (car-door closing and car engine noise) were then identiﬁed based on physical and perceptual considerations.

Therefore this imaging modality combines advantageous features of optics and acoustics. To increase the intrinsic contrast in tissue, particular nanoparticles are of great interest because of their considerable capacity to absorb light at visible and near-infrared wavelengths. At a preliminary stage of in vivo measurements, the biocompatibility and suitability of the nanoparticles is tested in vitro. A technology platform for optoacoustic imaging down to diffraction limited resolution for in vitro investigation of nanoparticle-exposed cells was developed. Different nanoparticle types were investigated regarding their suitability as optoacoustic contrast agent...|$|R

A light weight handheld probe which integrates acoustic signal detection and laser light delivery allows convenient handling. Optimized reconstruction algorithms and a hardware with 128 channels allow data acquisition, processing and display at a repetition rate only limited by the laser PRF of 20 Hz.

40|$|Acoustic {{waves are}} a carrier of {{information}} mainly in environments where {{the use of}} other types of waves, for example electromagnetic waves, is limited. The term <b>acoustical</b> <b>imaging</b> is widely used in the ultrasonic engineering to imaging areas in which the acoustic waves propagate. In particular, ultrasound is widely used in the visualization of human organs – ultrasonography (Nowicki, 2010).

The paper suggests the researcher should take into account this interaction behavior - diffraction, to avoid any misrepresentation as investigating microstructures and imaging characterization, promoting the accuracy for materials characterization through the acoustical images by scanning acoustic microscopy technology (SAM), in the application field of non-destructive Testing / Evaluation (NDT/E) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} wave field {{synthesis}} (WFS) {{was introduced by}} Berkhout in 1988 [1]. It enables the generation of sound fields with natural temporal and spatial properties within a volume or area bounded by arrays of loudspeakers. Applications are found in real time performances {{as well as in}} reproduction of multitrack recordings. A logic next step was the formulation of a new wave field analysis (WFA) concept by Berkhout in 1997 [2], where sound fields in enclosures are recorded with arrays of microphones and analyzed with postprocessing techniques commonly used in <b>acoustical</b> <b>imaging.</b> This way, both the temporal and spatial properties of the sound field can be investigated and understood. WFS and WFA meet in auralization applications: sound fields measured (or modeled) along arrays of microphone positions can be generated by arrays of loudspeakers for perceptual evaluation. 1...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIt {{has been}} {{recently}} {{shown that it}} was possible to optimally recover the Green functions from a complex wave field despite of a non-isotropic distribution of noise sources. The method used is based on a particular use of the inverse filter (IF) formalism which is called the passive IF. Based on this formalism, we have investigated the possibility to control the spatio-temporal degrees of freedom in a reverberant cavity for the focusing of waves (active processes). The understanding of this phenomenon can be very useful in a lot of different applications like in <b>acoustical</b> <b>imaging,</b> seismology, or telecommunications. In the present work, the spatio-temporal focalization of ultrasounds in reverberant cavities is studied using medical arrays and water tanks. Through experiments, a complete spatio-temporal inversion is realized to synthesize optimized emitting signals. The result generalizes the focalization control over a spatial vector and during an arbitrary time window...|$|E
40|$|International audienceNoise {{pollution}} investigation {{takes advantage}} of two common methods of diagnosis: measurement using a Sound Level Meter and <b>acoustical</b> <b>imaging.</b> The former enables {{a detailed analysis of}} the surrounding noise spectrum whereas the latter is rather used for source localization. Both approaches complete each other, and merging them into a unique system, working in realtime, would offer new possibilities of dynamic diagnosis. This paper describes the :design of a complete system for this purpose: imaging in realtime the acoustic field at different octave bands, with a convenient device. The acoustic field is sampled in time and space using an array of MEMS microphones. This recent technology enables a compact and fully digital design of the system. However, performing realtime imaging with resource-intensive algorithm on a large amount of measured data confronts with a technical challenge. This is overcome by executing the whole process on a Graphic Processing Unit, which has recently become an attractive device for parallel computing...|$|E
40|$|For {{enhanced}} immersion into {{a virtual}} scene {{more than just}} the visual sense should be addressed by a Virtual Reality system. Additional auditory stimulation appears to have much potential, as it realizes a multisensory system. This is especially useful when the user does not have to wear any additional hardware, e. g., headphones. Creating a virtual sound scene with spatially distributed sources requires a technique for adding spatial cues to audio signals and an appropriate reproduction. In this paper we present a real-time audio rendering system that combines dynamic crosstalk cancellation and multi-track binaural synthesis for virtual <b>acoustical</b> <b>imaging.</b> This provides the possibility of simulating spatially distributed sources and, in addi-Digital Peer Publishing Licence Any party may pass on this Work by electronic means and make it available for download under the terms and conditions of the current version of the Digital Peer Publishing Licence (DPPL).
