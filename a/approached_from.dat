5|$|The castle stands precipitously above a loop of the River North Esk, {{which protects}} it on three sides. This rocky {{promontory}} was breached {{on the north}} side to form a ditch giving further protection. The castle is <b>approached</b> <b>from</b> Roslin across this ditch, via a precipitous bridge and through the ruined gatehouse.|$|E

5|$|Cleanup efforts {{after the}} storm were hastened as Hurricane Gonzalo <b>approached</b> <b>from</b> the south, amid {{concerns}} that strewn debris from Fay could become airborne and exacerbate future destruction. The unanticipated heavy damage from Fay prompted residents to prepare more thoroughly for Gonzalo, as evidenced by stores reporting an influx of customers purchasing emergency supplies. Two hundred Bermuda Regiment soldiers helped clear debris and began repairing structural damage. On October 13, crews of soldiers put tarpaulins on 30 homes with roof damage, as well as distributing another 150 tarps to homeowners.|$|E

5|$|The castle, {{situated}} on a headland overlooking Loch Ness, {{is one of}} the largest in Scotland in area. It was <b>approached</b> <b>from</b> the west and defended by a ditch and drawbridge. The buildings of the castle were laid out around two main enclosures on the shore. The northern enclosure or Nether Bailey includes most of the more intact structures, including the gatehouse, and the five-story Grant Tower at the north end of the castle. The southern enclosure or Upper Bailey, sited on higher ground, comprises the scant remains of earlier buildings.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} May 2013, a {{broad and}} diffuse {{cyclonic}} disturbance developed over eastern Mexico and northern Central America, incorporating the remnants of easternPacific Hurricane Barbara. As a tropical wave <b>approached</b> <b>from</b> the east, an inverted trough developed on {{the northern edge of}} the active region on June2, setting the stage for the formation of a weak surface low pressure system over the southern Gulf of Mexico the next day. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring the system in their Tropical Weather Outlooks, bulletins issued every six hours regarding the probability of tropical cyclone formation within 48hours. A nearby upper trough created unfavorable conditions for tropical cyclogenesis, subjecting the low to wind shear and abundant dry air that kept it indistinct and disorganized. On June5, the environment became less hostile, and the system began to improve in structure.|$|E

5|$|By 1200UTC on February14, Nancy {{attained}} {{its peak}} intensity with winds of 175km/h (110mph 10-minute winds) and a barometric pressure of 935hPa (mbar). Shortly after, the JTWC assessed Nancy to have peaked with winds of 230km/h (145mph 1-minute winds). Increasing forward motion {{to the southeast}} and increasing wind shear caused Nancy to weaken. Early on February15, the storm passed directly over Manuae. Continued weakening took place as a trough <b>approached</b> <b>from</b> the southwest. By February16, Nancy weakened below hurricane intensity {{and turned to the}} southwest as it began to undergo a Fujiwhara interaction with Cyclone Olaf to the north.|$|E
5|$|On 7 June, a {{combined}} force from Nos. 4 and 5 Troops under {{command of the}} second-in-command, Major John Pooley, carried out {{an attack on the}} Merville battery near the coast where there were still guns firing on the landing beaches. The battery had been taken the previous day by a force from the 9th Parachute Battalion, but had been reoccupied later by the Germans and it was heavily defended by mortars and landmines. Approaching from the south, No. 4 Troop moved across the open ground before taking up position behind the hedgerows 300 yards from the battery and from where laid down covering fire for No. 5 Troop which <b>approached</b> <b>from</b> the east with fixed bayonets.|$|E
5|$|Realising {{that his}} ship was doomed, Colvill {{attempted}} {{to save his}} men and sent out two boats to seek help from nearby merchant vessels. One boat overturned while returning to Romney, drowning the boat's crew. The other made for shore, hoping to summon assistance from the Dutch authorities. The following morning, and with Romney fast breaking up, Colvill supervised the construction and launching {{of a number of}} rafts. As the final raft was being launched, seven boats <b>approached</b> <b>from</b> shore. On reaching Romney, the Dutch commander of the boats called on Colvill to surrender, promising that he would endeavour to save the British sailors. Colvill agreed and the Dutch rescued the remaining members of the crew. The total loss of life in the wreck was between nine and eleven men.|$|E

5|$|Since medical {{literature}} began to describe homosexuality, {{it has often}} been <b>approached</b> <b>from</b> a view that sought to find an inherent psychopathology as the root cause, influenced by the theories of Sigmund Freud. Although he considered bisexuality inherent in all people, and said that most have phases of homosexual attraction or experimentation, exclusive same-sex attraction he attributed to stunted development resulting from trauma or parental conflicts. Much literature on mental health and lesbians centered on their depression, substance abuse, and suicide. Although these issues exist among lesbians, discussion about their causes shifted after homosexuality was removed from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual in 1973. Instead, social ostracism, legal discrimination, internalization of negative stereotypes, and limited support structures indicate factors homosexuals face in Western societies that often adversely affect their mental health.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Alexander at Issus {{is painted}} on a limewood panel {{measuring}} , and portrays {{the moment of}} Alexander the Great's victory. The vertical format was dictated by the space available in the room for which the painting was commissioned – each in William's set of eight was made {{to be the same}} size. At an unknown date, the panel was cut down on all sides, particularly at the top, so the sky was originally larger and the moon further from the corner of the scene. The scene is <b>approached</b> <b>from</b> an impossible viewpoint – at first only feet from the fray, the perspective gradually ascends to encompass the seas and continents in the background and eventually the curvature of the Earth itself.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{originally}} {{comprised the}} 12th- or 13th-century hall house, which was extended in the 15th century. In the 16th century the central range {{was built to}} the south of the tower house, and new inner and outer courtyard walls were constructed. The east part of the inner courtyard wall is reduced to foundations, but the base of a round tower and a porter's lodge survive. To the west, the inner courtyard wall remains, enclosing the former service courtyard, which comprises a brewery and bakehouse, with ovens. The east range was added in the 17th century, along the south edge of the outer courtyard. The castle was originally <b>approached</b> <b>from</b> the north, with the entrance moved to the west, along with the 17th-century gate, when the Aberdour railway line was constructed in 1890.|$|E

5|$|The former fishing {{hamlet of}} Holywell (local {{pronunciation}} ‘holly well’) was situated by the cliff on a ledge some 400 {{yards to the}} southwest of the public garden known as the Holywell Retreat. It was <b>approached</b> <b>from</b> what is now Holywell Road via the lane between the present Helen Gardens and StBede’s School {{which leads to the}} chalk pinnacle formerly known locally as ‘Gibraltar’ or the 'Sugar Loaf'. The ground around the pinnacle was the site of lime kilns also worked by the fishermen. The fishing hamlet at Holywell was taken over by the local water board in 1896 to exploit the springs in the cliffs. The water board's successors still own the site, and there is a pumping station but little evidence of the hamlet itself, as by now even most of the foundations of the cottages have gone over the cliff.|$|E
5|$|The halt was <b>approached</b> <b>from</b> {{the road}} by a path leading up the {{embankment}} on which the railway ran. To the west, a bridge carried the line over Northrepps Road from where it proceeded on another embankment before reaching Cromer Tunnel which was built by the Norfolk and Suffolk Joint Railway to take the line under the Great Eastern's Cromer High to Norwich route. Although only 61 yards long, the tunnel is notable as being {{one of only two}} standard gauge tunnels anywhere in Norfolk, the other being Barsham Tunnel on the Wells-on-Sea branch. However, as Barsham Tunnel was opened out before 1912, Cromer Tunnel is actually the only tunnel.|$|E
5|$|The player {{touches the}} screen to move Adam Jensen, a protagonist from the stealth combat, cyber-dystopian Deus Ex series, between nodes on a {{hexagonal}} grid towards an exit. If moved to a specific node, the character will stealthily take down guards, hack computers, and activate his human augmentations, such as invisibility. Enemies who spot Jensen will move towards and, if they reach his node, eliminate him. Alternatively, Jensen can eliminate enemies if <b>approached</b> <b>from</b> behind or their side. In the game's story, which is set before the events of , Jensen's sole mission is to save an important person, but is continually set back by puzzles—54 in total.|$|E

In the garbhagriha, the central icon of Rama {{along with his}} consort Sita and Lakshmana are carved as a {{composite}} image, out of a single rock. It is also inferred that the garbhagriha is itself carved out of a single block. The monkey-god Hanuman, Rama's devotee, who is generally shown with the trio is missing here. However, there is a separate temple for Hanuman here. There is also an image of Ganesha in a dancing posture in the mandapam.|$|E
5|$|Tourism {{has been}} a more {{successful}} industry in the area. For over two hundred years visitors have been drawn by the lake and mountain scenery of the Lake District, and many have {{made their way to}} the top of Helvellyn. Among the early visitors to Helvellyn were the poets Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth, both of whom lived nearby at one period. Many routes up the mountain are possible so that it may be <b>approached</b> <b>from</b> all directions. The view from the top is one of the most extensive over the Lake District, and on a clear day the view can also stretch from Scotland to Wales.|$|E
