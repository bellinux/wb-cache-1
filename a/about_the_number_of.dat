5|$|Lyons' admissions {{during the}} first {{interview}} were not very detailed, {{and many of the}} details provided did not match the evidence. Lyons gave incorrect information about the precise location of the killings and <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> weapons used. During the interview, he was confused <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> people that had been killed, and he thought that the women were awake, and moving about the house at the time, which conflicted with the forensic evidence.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} {{local governments have}} {{implemented}} tree and landscape ordinances, which will help communities by providing shade during summer. Tree protection is an ordinance that does not allow someone to prune or remove trees without a city permit. An example is the city of Glendale, California: Through the Indigenous Tree Ordinance, the city of Glendale protects the following species of trees, the California sycamore, the coast live oak, mesa oak, valley oak, scrub oak, California bay. Anyone who is planning on removing or trimming the trees has to obtain an indigenous tree permit. Within the permit they have to provide detailed information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> trees affected, trunk diameter {{and the health of}} the tree itself. They also have to submit photographs of the site, and a site plan sketch.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, {{plans to}} extend the freeway portion of SR 78 east from the Broadway {{interchange}} through Escondido were delayed by Caltrans director Jacob Dekema {{due to a lack}} of funding until 1980. However, in 1970, the community raised concerns <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> buildings that would need to be destroyed, as the freeway would go through a dense urban area. Other routes, including routing SR78 along I-15 south, were proposed. The majority of the Escondido City Council supported sending representatives to the upcoming California Coastal Commission meeting in January 1971 to expedite the process of construction.|$|E

5|$|On November 23, 1876, {{representatives from}} Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Columbia {{met at the}} Massasoit House in Springfield, Massachusetts to {{standardize}} a new code of rules based on the rugby game first introduced to Harvard by McGill University in 1874. The rules were based largely on the Rugby Football Union's code from England, though one important difference was the replacement of a kicked goal with a touchdown as the primary means of scoring (a change that would later occur in rugby itself, favoring the try as the main scoring event). Three of the schools—Harvard, Columbia, and Princeton—formed the Intercollegiate Football Association, {{as a result of}} the meeting. Yale did not join the group until 1879, because of an early disagreement <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> players per team.|$|E
5|$|The TRC {{concluded}} {{that it may be}} impossible to ever identify the number of deaths or missing children, {{in part because of the}} habit of burying students in unmarked graves. The work is further complicated by a pattern of poor record keeping by school and government officials, who neglected to keep reliable numbers <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> children who died or where they were buried. While most schools had cemeteries on site, their location and extent remain difficult to determine as cemeteries that were originally marked were found to have been later razed, intentionally hidden or built over.|$|E
5|$|Experts {{disagree}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> {{species in}} the genus Attalea (broadly defined). In 1965, Dutch taxonomist Jan Gerard Wessels Boer estimated {{that there may be}} as many as 100 {{species in the}} genus. In their 1996 Field Guide to the Palms of the Americas Andrew Henderson and coauthors recognised 29 species in the genus, while Sidney Glassman recognised 65 species in his 1999 treatment of the group. Largely following Glassman's lead, Rafaël Govaerts and John Dransfield recognised 67 species in their 2005 World Checklist of Palms. An important element of this disagreement is the decision by Glassman to define species more narrowly than Henderson. As a result, what Henderson interpreted as variation within species, Glassman took as differences between morphologically similar species. This problem is {{complicated by the fact that}} many of these species are poorly represented in herbarium collections. The large size of the leaves, inflorescences and fruit of many Attalea species makes them difficult to collect. In addition, many important collections, including type specimen, have been lost or destroyed. Sparse or incomplete collections make it difficult to differentiate variation within a single species from variation between different species.|$|E

2500|$|As with 1 Esdras, {{there is}} some {{confusion}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbering</b> <b>of</b> this book. <b>The</b> Vulgate of Jerome includes 1, 2, 3 and 4 Esdras. Protestant writers, after the Geneva Bible, called 1 and 2 Esdras of the Vulgate Ezra and Nehemiah, and called 3 and 4 Esdras of the Vulgate 1 and 2 Esdras which became common in English Bibles.|$|R
50|$|During {{her long}} period {{as part of}} the GSD government, Del Agua was {{involved}} in several controversies. Among other things, she was accused of lack of respect for the rights of disabled people, lying <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> children's dental care program and neglecting the working conditions of prison wardens as well as the escape of inmates in custody at HMP Moorish Castle.|$|R
5|$|The Cuban iguana is {{naturally}} distributed in rocky coastal areas on Cuba and throughout {{as many as}} 4,000 islets surrounding the Cuban mainland, including Isla de la Juventud off the southern coast, which {{has one of the}} most robust populations. Relatively safe populations are found on some islets along the north and south coasts and in isolated protected areas on the mainland. These include Guanahacabibes Biosphere Reserve in the west, Desembarco del Granma National Park, Hatibonico Wildlife Refuge, Punta Negra-Quemados Ecological Reserve, and Delta del Cauto Wildlife Refuge, all in eastern Cuba. Because of this wide distribution, accurate information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> distinct subpopulations of Cuban iguanas cannot be determined. The population on the US Naval Base at Guantánamo Bay has been estimated at 2,000 to 3,000 individuals, and the animals are treated well and protected by US forces stationed at the base. An unusual incident occurred when a detainee in the prison assaulted a guard with a bloody tail torn from a Cuban iguana in May 2005.|$|E
5|$|The {{air attacks}} on Japan caused {{hundreds}} of thousands of casualties, though estimates of the number who were killed and wounded vary considerably. The strategic attacks by the Twentieth Air Force caused most of the casualties and damage. The figures most frequently cited in the literature on the campaign are sourced from the USSBS report The Effects of Bombing on Health and Medical Services in Japan which estimated that 333,000 Japanese were killed and 473,000 wounded. Included in this figure were an estimated 120,000 dead and 160,000 injured in the two atomic bomb attacks. Another USSBS report, The Effects of Strategic Bombing on Japanese Morale, included a much higher estimate of 900,000 killed and 1.3million injured which was reached by a Japanese research team using a statistical sampling methodology. While this figure is also occasionally cited, the USSBS' investigators regarded the work of their statistical teams as unsatisfactory, and the researchers were unable to calculate the error rate of this estimate. The postwar Japanese government calculated in 1949 that 323,495 people had been killed by air attacks in the home islands. The destruction of buildings housing government records during air raids contributed to the uncertainty <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> casualties. The Twentieth Air Force lost 414 B-29s during attacks on Japan. Over 2,600 American bomber crew members were killed, including POWs who died in captivity, and a further 433 were wounded.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day Chief Inspector Tavares de Almeida of the Polícia Judiciária in Portimão signed a nine-page report concluding that Madeleine {{had died in}} apartment 5A {{as a result of}} an accident, that the meal in the tapas restaurant and apparent regular checks on the McCann children had been part of the cover-up, that the Tapas Seven had helped to mislead the police, and that the McCanns had concealed the body, then faked an abduction. An 11-page document from the Information Analysis Brigade in Lisbon analysed alleged discrepancies in the McCanns' statements. On 11 September the public prosecutor, José Cunha de Magalhães e Meneses, handed the 10-volume case file to a judge, Pedro Miguel dos Anjos Frias. Meneses applied for the seizure of Kate's diary and Gerry's laptop. The police also wanted to trace telephone calls the McCanns and Tapas Seven had made, and there were details in the report <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> suitcases the McCanns and their friends had taken back to England.|$|E

5|$|On {{the evening}} of 25 July, {{information}} arrived at Arrah that a disturbance {{was to be expected}} in the district. Wake had been told by a railway engineer stationed nearby that the boats used to cross the Son River would be destroyed; when Wake was informed {{on the morning of the}} 26th that the mutineers were crossing the river, he realised that the boats had in fact not been destroyed as promised. Wake, who had no information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> mutinying sepoys and other forces approaching Arrah, noted that the local police force had disappeared and he decided not to abandon the town. Eighteen civilians and fifty members of the Bengal Military Police Battalion moved into Boyle's fortified building and bricked themselves up inside. The building had stores of food, drink and ammunition (with gunpowder and lead to make more if required), entrenching tools and weapons the men had brought with them. The supplies were thought to be sufficient for a few days and, since they expected the mutineers to be followed by pursuing forces, the men anticipated a brief siege of no more than 48 hours. Throughout the entire siege Wake kept a diary by writing on the walls of the building so there would be a record of events if the besieged party did not survive. On the morning of 27 July the mutineers, joined by Kunwar Singh and his forces, arrived in Arrah. They released the prisoners from the jail and, joined by its guards, looted the treasury of 85,000 rupees. The mutineers and rebels (including the prison guards) then surrounded the house with drums and bugles playing, arranged themselves into formation and charged. When the mutineers were within 100 yards the men inside opened fire on them, killing eighteen instantly and forcing the rest to stop their charge and take shelter behind the surrounding trees and buildings.|$|E
