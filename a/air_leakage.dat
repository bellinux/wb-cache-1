5|$|Pleurodesis is a {{procedure}} that permanently eliminates the pleural space and attaches the lung to the chest wall. No long-term study (20 years or more) has been performed on its consequences. Good results {{in the short term}} are achieved with a thoracotomy (surgical opening of the chest) with identification of any source of <b>air</b> <b>leakage</b> and stapling of blebs followed by pleurectomy (stripping of the pleural lining) of the outer pleural layer and pleural abrasion (scraping of the pleura) of the inner layer. During the healing process, the lung adheres to the chest wall, effectively obliterating the pleural space. Recurrence rates are approximately 1%. Post-thoracotomy pain is relatively common.|$|E

25|$|Another {{important}} reliability {{problem is}} caused by <b>air</b> <b>leakage</b> into the tube. Usually oxygen in the air reacts chemically with the hot filament or cathode, quickly ruining it. Designers developed tube designs that sealed reliably. This was why most tubes were constructed of glass. Metal alloys (such as Cunife and Fernico) and glasses had been developed for light bulbs that expanded and contracted in similar amounts, as temperature changed. These {{made it easy to}} construct an insulating envelope of glass, while passing connection wires through the glass to the electrodes.|$|E
25|$|To reduce {{operating}} energy use, designers use {{details that}} reduce <b>air</b> <b>leakage</b> {{through the building}} envelope (the barrier between conditioned and unconditioned space). They also specify high-performance windows and extra insulation in walls, ceilings, and floors. Another strategy, passive solar building design, is often implemented in low-energy homes. Designers orient windows and walls and place awnings, porches, and trees to shade windows and roofs during the summer while maximizing solar gain in the winter. In addition, effective window placement (daylighting) can provide more natural light and lessen the need for electric lighting during the day. Solar water heating further reduces energy costs.|$|E

These are designed to provide a passage of air to the pharynx through the nose or mouth, respectively. Poorly fitted masks often cause nasal bridge ulcers, a problem for some patients. Face masks are also used for non-invasive ventilation in conscious patients. A full face mask does not, however, provide protection against aspiration.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a model-based method {{for the system}} identification of a rectangular enclosure with {{an unknown number of}} <b>air</b> <b>leakages</b> subjected to uniform external noise, according to the probabilistic approach. The method aims to identify the number and corresponding locations and sizes of <b>air</b> <b>leakages</b> utilizing a set of measured, interior, sound pressure data in the frequency domain. System identification of an enclosure with an unknown number of <b>air</b> <b>leakages</b> is not trivial. Different classes of acoustic models are required to simulate an enclosure with different numbers of leakages. By following the traditional system of identification techniques, the “optimal” class of models is selected by minimizing the discrepancy between the measured and modeled interior sound pressure. By doing this, the most complicated model class (that is, the one with the highest number of uncertain parameters) will always be selected. Therefore, the traditional system identification techniques found in the literature to date cannot be employed to solve this problem. Our proposed system identification methodology relies on the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) to identify accurately the number of leakages in an enclosure. Unlike all deterministic system identification approaches, the proposed methodology aims to calculate the posterior (updated) probability density function (PDF) of leakage locations and sizes. Therefore, the uncertainties introduced by measurement noise and modeling error can be explicitly addressed. The coefficient of variable (COV) of uncertain parameters, which can be easily calculated from the PDF, provides valuable information about the reliability of the identification results...|$|R

The stack damper also regulates the heat lost through the stack. As the damper closes, the amount of heat escaping the furnace through the stack decreases, but the pressure or draft in the furnace increases which poses risks to those working around it if there are <b>air</b> <b>leakages</b> in the furnace, the flames can then escape out of the firebox or even explode if the pressure is too great.|$|R

These spring-operated balancing mechanisms also typically permit the top of the windows to swing inward, permitting cleaning of the exterior of the IG window from inside the building.|$|E
25|$|Once in place, {{concrete}} offers great {{energy efficiency}} over {{the lifetime of}} a building. Concrete walls leak air far less than those made of wood frames. <b>Air</b> <b>leakage</b> accounts for {{a large percentage of}} energy loss from a home. The thermal mass properties of concrete increase the efficiency of both residential and commercial buildings. By storing and releasing the energy needed for heating or cooling, concrete's thermal mass delivers year-round benefits by reducing temperature swings inside and minimizing heating and cooling costs. While insulation reduces energy loss through the building envelope, thermal mass uses walls to store and release energy. Modern concrete wall systems use both external insulation and thermal mass to create an energy-efficient building. Insulating concrete forms (ICFs) are hollow blocks or panels made of either insulating foam or rastra that are stacked to form the shape of the walls of a building and then filled with reinforced concrete to create the structure.|$|E
25|$|Houseplants {{together}} with the medium {{in which they are}} grown can reduce components of indoor air pollution, particularly volatile organic compounds (VOC) such as benzene, toluene, and xylene. Plants remove CO2 and release oxygen and water, although the quantitative impact for house plants is small. Most of the effect is attributed to the growing medium alone, but even this effect has finite limits associated with the type and quantity of medium and the flow of air through the medium. The effect of house plants on VOC concentrations was investigated in one study, done in a static chamber, by NASA for possible use in space colonies. The results showed that the removal of the challenge chemicals was roughly equivalent to that provided by the ventilation that occurred in a very energy efficient dwelling with a very low ventilation rate, an air exchange rate of about 1/10 per hour. Therefore, <b>air</b> <b>leakage</b> in most homes, and in non-residential buildings too, will generally remove the chemicals faster than the researchers reported for the plants tested by NASA. The most effective household plants reportedly included aloe vera, English ivy, and Boston fern for removing chemicals and biological compounds.|$|E

5000|$|An {{inherent}} suction {{limitation of}} all suction pumps {{is that they}} can only lift a liquid through utilizing atmospheric pressure. For pure water the theoretical maximum lift is approximately 10.3 m (33.9 feet)). [...] However, due to the viscosity of fecal sludge it is possible to mix air into it either by sucking close from the surface or by adding air with a compressor through a separate hose. Through this the overall density of the sludge/air mixture can be reduced below that of pure water and thus a higher lift (10-15 m) can be reached under optimal conditions. Other factors affecting the possible lift and total length of the suction hose are that single stage vacuum pumps only reach a 85-90% partial vacuum, and that small <b>air</b> <b>leakages,</b> pipe friction losses and the viscosity of the liquid further reduce the possible lift.|$|R

2500|$|The glass {{panels in}} {{double-glazed}} windows transmit heat {{in both directions}} by radiation, across the panes by convection, and by conduction around the perimeter seals. The actual rates will vary with the conditions throughout the year, and while solar gain may be much welcomed in the winter (depending on local climate), it may result in increased air conditioning costs in the summer. The unwanted heat transfer can be mitigated by for example using curtains {{in the winter and}} using sun shades in the summer. In an attempt to provide a useful comparison between alternative window constructions the British Fenestration Rating Council have defined a [...] "Window Energy Rating" [...] WER, ranging from A for the best down through B and C etc. This takes into account a combination of the heat loss through the window (U value, the reciprocal of R-value), the solar gain (g value), and loss through <b>air</b> <b>leakage</b> around the frame (L value). For example, an A Rated window will in a typical year gain as much heat from solar gain as it loses in other ways (however the majority of this gain will occur during the summer months, when the heat may not be needed by the building occupant). This provides better thermal performance than a typical wall.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: According to the {{domestic}} energy fact file 2003, residential space heating constitutes a significant 60 % of the total domestic energy consumption. The age distribution of UK’s dwelling stock illustrates that three-fourths of the housing stock was built before 1975. Since newer dwellings are built to exacting standards of energy efficiency, there is scope for reduction of a considerable portion of the space heating demand by effective retrofitting of the existing older stock. This study looks at traditional English dwellings and investigates {{the extent to which}} available retrofitting options reduce heating demand, and examines the most affordable measures. The energy demand is calculated using thermal analysis software tools and Energy Index for a case study residence. Some of these measures are identified as night insulation and effective reduction of <b>air</b> <b>leakages.</b> A matrix of retrofitting measures based on effectiveness versus affordability is drawn by comparing various combinations of proposed improvements...|$|R

40|$|In {{one type}} of duct {{efficiency}} retrofit, additional insulation is added to a duct system that is already insulated. For example, a layer of R- 4 insulation might be: added to a duct system that already has R- 4 installed. It is possible that [...] either by chance or by design [...] the add-on layer, while not stopping duct leaks, might cause the <b>leakage</b> <b>air</b> to flow longitudinally for a distance, parallel to the duct, before it finds {{a way out of}} the newly added outer layer. This could happen by chance if the outer and inner layers of insulation have seams at different locations. Perhaps more usefully, if such longitudinal displacement of the <b>leakage</b> <b>air</b> turned out to be useful, it might be designed into the makeup of the outer insulation layer intended to be used in the retrofit. It is plausible that this <b>leakage</b> <b>air</b> might serve a useful function in keeping the insulation layer warmer (or, in the air-conditioning mode, cooler) than it would be in the absence of the leakage. By being held close to the ducts for a while, it might establish an artificially warmer (or cooler, in air conditioning) zone around the ducts. To the extent that this effect would reduce the heat losses from the ducts, the leakage should be credited with a ''thermal regain'' in the same way that leakage into buffer zones is credited with thermal regain when the <b>leakage</b> <b>air</b> warms (or cools) the buffer zone relative to the temperature it would have in the absence of such duct leakage. The purpose of this report is to investigate whether and to what extent such thermal regain exists. The model developed below applies to a situation where there are two distinct layers of insulation around the duct, with <b>leakage</b> <b>air</b> moving between them in a longitudinal direction for a distance before it finds its way out from the outer insulation layer. It may also apply approximately where there is a single insulation layer with an air barrier on the outside. <b>Leakage</b> <b>air</b> may pass into the insulation itself and thence longitudinally through the insulation material until it finds an opening in the air barrier through which it can escape...|$|R
