5|$|A {{leader of}} a party is chosen by the party, {{following}} an internal constitution unique to each party that comprises a framework to elect or appoint a leader. The leader, {{if he or she}} does not <b>already</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> seat, must then win a seat in a by-election or general election to sit in the Assembly. If a {{leader of a}} party does not have a seat, he or she must sit in the legislature gallery. While sitting in the gallery a premier cannot exercise any legislative powers.|$|E
5|$|Planarians, a {{subgroup}} of seriates, {{are famous for}} their ability to regenerate if divided by cuts across their bodies. Experiments show that, in fragments that do not <b>already</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> head, a new head grows most quickly on those closest to the original head. This suggests the growth of a head is controlled by a chemical whose concentration diminishes from head to tail. Many turbellarians clone themselves by transverse or longitudinal division, and others, especially acoels, reproduce by budding.|$|E
5|$|Romblon {{has been}} {{inhabited}} by aboriginal Filipinos {{prior to the}} arrival of the Spanish in 1569. Archaeological artifacts recovered by the National Museum in 1936 indicate that the aborigines of Romblon <b>already</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> rich and advanced culture. Under Spanish colonial rule, Romblon was initially administered under the newly established province of Arevalo, until 1716, when it was transferred to the jurisdiction of the newly created province of Capiz. With arrival of the Americans in 1901, Romblon was declared a province and placed under civilian rule. It lost its provincial status for a short while between 1907 and 1945, but regained it in 1946, just after World War II.|$|E

5|$|Van Overstraten {{is desperately}} keen for strong British counterattack. Either {{north or south}} of Leie could help restore the situation. Belgians expect to be {{attacked}} on the Ghent front tomorrow. Germans <b>already</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> bridgehead over canal west of Eecloo. There can be no question of the Belgian withdrawal to Yser. One battalion on march NE of Ypres was practically wiped out today in attack by sixty aircraft. Withdrawal over open roads without adequate fighter support very costly. Whole of their supplies are east of Yser. They strongly represent attempt {{should be made to}} restore the situation on Leie by British counter-attack for which opportunity may last another few hours only.|$|E
5|$|This series {{proved to}} be highly controversial, with many people {{complaining}} {{about the use of}} pitch correction software on the broadcast of contestants' auditions, the decision to form two groups out of rejected soloists, the rejection of popular contestant Gamu Nhengu at judges' houses and Cole's failure to vote to eliminate an act in week 5 of the live shows. Controversy also surrounded contestants Shirlena Johnson, who was axed over fears for her mental health, and Treyc Cohen, who was reported to <b>already</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> record deal when the live shows started. There were also accusations of fixing, which were denied by the show's producers. It was the most watched series to date, with an average of 14.13million viewers per episode. The final was watched by 17.71million people, making it the highest rated television episode of 2010 in the UK.|$|E

In 2009, the Justice Department reported that Mexican drug cartels distribute drugs in nearly 200 {{cities across the}} United States, including Los Angeles, Chicago and Atlanta. Gang-related activity and violence has increased along the U.S. Southwest border region, as US-based gangs act as enforcers for Mexican drug cartels.|$|E

25|$|Due to the {{similarities}} between the two universities, and to ease the burden of interviewing so many applicants each year, secondary school students are not normally allowed to apply to both Oxford and Cambridge in the same application cycle.

25|$|The Nurse Reinvestment Act of 2002 {{had many}} strategies. The law {{authorized}} and had provisions that included {{topics such as}} loan repayment programs and scholarships, providing more grants to the nursing students, making more public service announcements about nursing and educating the public on what a great profession it is and making nursing school more flexible by creating options {{for the people who}} <b>already</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> degree but would like to go into nursing.|$|E
50|$|Each {{player has}} seven {{followers}} of a colour; two fishing huts and five ordinary followers. Ordinary followers may {{be placed on}} any terrain feature (i.e. meadow, forest or river) as described above. Fishing huts may only be placed on a river segment or lake. Doing so claims ownership of the entire system of rivers (i.e. all bodies of water connected to the segment on which the hut is placed). Huts and ordinary followers do not influence each other's placement; thus a player may place a hut on a river in which any player <b>already</b> <b>has</b> <b>an</b> ordinary follower. Similarly, a player may place an ordinary follower on a river in which any player <b>already</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> hut. A hut may not be placed on a river system which <b>already</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> hut, but (as with forests, meadows and rivers), {{it is possible that}} two or more huts may share the same river system if the placement of a tile joins two or river systems, each of which <b>already</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> hut on it.|$|R

25|$|Discussion {{regarding}} destiny {{does not}} necessitate {{the existence of}} supernatural powers. Logical determinism or determinateness {{is the notion that}} all propositions, whether about the past, present, or future, are either true or false. This creates a unique problem for free will given that propositions about the future <b>already</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> truth value in the present (that is it is already determined as either true or false), and {{is referred to as the}} problem of future contingents.|$|E
25|$|Gibraltar {{is within}} the EU for some purposes, {{including}} free movement of persons.

Non EU citizens need both a work and resident permit, and are only likely to get these if they <b>already</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> job offer and their employer satisfies the Government that their skills are unique. However, special arrangements can be made for high-net-worth individuals.|$|E
