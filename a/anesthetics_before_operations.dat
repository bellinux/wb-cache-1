50|$|Overall, vinyl ether’s only {{strengths}} {{compared to}} ethyl ether are favorable induction and recovery. During anesthesia vinyl ether has no particularly wonderful properties and {{is harder to}} control than other agents. Therefore, vinyl ether was commonly used as a preliminary <b>anesthetic</b> <b>before</b> administration of diethyl ether. Additionally, vinyl ether was only used for short operations or analgesia, e.g. dentistry and obstetrics. Vinyl ether was used infrequently for long operations because of toxicity, cost, and superior alternatives.|$|R
50|$|Based on the Tabinid maggots's pupal casing, Hodgins {{determines that}} Nestor {{ingested}} a {{heavy dose of}} ketamine, a dissociative <b>anesthetic,</b> <b>before</b> he died. However, the team cannot be certain if the boy had taken the drug involuntarily but Dr. Brennan is able to give a scenario of Nestor's death involving the ketamine. Combined with the ketamine, the choking would have caused Nestor to regurgitate stomach acids, which would have been trapped in the throat and weakened the hyoid bone. The weight of Nestor's body could then break his hyoid.|$|R
40|$|Antimicrobial {{prophylaxis}} with agents active against aerobic and anaerobic micro-organisms {{leads to}} a significant reduction of infectious complications following colorectal surgery. A single dose (1600 mg) of tinidazole (a nitroimidazole derivate) and doxycycline (400 mg) will provide serum and tissue values well above minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for more than 24 hours. To reduce the unwanted side effects and cost of prolonged antimicrobial prophylaxis, a prospective controlled clinical multicenter study comparing {{the effect of a}} single dose <b>before</b> <b>operation</b> of tinidazole and doxycycline to five days of prophylaxis <b>before</b> <b>operation</b> in 234 patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery was undertaken. Six patients given a single dose of prophylaxis <b>before</b> <b>operation</b> (n = 118) developed infectious complication (5. 1 %). Prolongation of prophylaxis <b>before</b> <b>operation</b> for four days after operation (n = 116) did not lead to any further reduction of infectious complications. A single dose of tinidazole and doxycycline <b>before</b> <b>operation</b> is a simple and effective prophylaxis against infectious complications following elective colorectal surgery...|$|R

The aim {{of the study was}} to assess the effect of preincisional clonidine treatment on analgesic consumption and hemodynamic stability compared to clonidine administered at the end of the operation and control group. Ninety-one patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery were randomly assigned to four groups: peroral clonidine <b>before</b> <b>operation,</b> epidural clonidine <b>before</b> <b>operation,</b> epidural clonidine at the end of operation, and epidural saline <b>before</b> <b>operation</b> as a control group. After the operation, patient-controlled analgesia with epidural morphine was instituted. Analgesic consumption, blood pressure and heart rate were obtained at 1, 2, 6 and 24 h postoperatively, and the cumulative consumption of analgesics was assessed at the end of the study period. Significant differences (p < 0. 05) in postoperative systolic blood pressure, with highest hemodynamic stability was observed at 1 h and 6 h in the group of patients administered epidural clonidine <b>before</b> <b>operation.</b> In this group of patients we found significant reduction in analgesic consumption during the study period (p < 0. 05), compared to other groups. The cumulative consumption of analgesics assessed at the end of the study period was significantly reduced (p < 0. 05) in the group of patients administered epidural clonidine <b>before</b> <b>operation</b> (8. 40 +/- 3. 74, respectively) as compared with the peroral clonidine <b>before</b> <b>operation</b> (16. 79 +/- 5. 75, respectively), epidural clonidine at the end of the operation (11. 11 +/- 4. 24, respectively) and control group of patients (18. 00 +/- 6. 45, respectively). Preincisional administration of epidural clonidine was associated with a significantly lower analgesic use, lower cumulative analgesic consumption and greater hemodynamic stability, in comparison with other groups...|$|R

40|$|Sixty-one {{patients}} received nitrazepam 5 mg by {{mouth on}} the night <b>before</b> <b>operation,</b> followed by 2. 5 mg given {{on the morning of}} operation and were compared with 60 patients who received no premedication. All were undergoing either therapeutic abortion, by dilatation and curettage, or explorative curettage. The plasma concentrations of nitrazepam were determined by gas chromat-ography and compared with the clinical effects of the drug. The premedicated patients slept better {{on the night}} <b>before</b> <b>operation,</b> and were more sedated and less apprehensive. Headache was more frequent following nitrazepam. There {{was no significant difference between}} the groups in respect of dizziness and nausea. The unpremedicated patients had a faster average heart rate. There was no obvious relationship between the plasma concentration of nitrazepam and the quality of sleep, degree of sedation, apprehension, excitement or headache. Benzodiazepines have been shown to be as effective as morphine or promethazine for premedication, with fewer emetic and other sequelae (Haslett and Dundee, 1968). They produce anxiolysis without marked drowsiness (Dundee and Haslett, 1970).

40|$|In {{the present}} paper, {{efforts have been}} {{attempted}} to analyze alteration of the basal metabolism before and after gynecologic operation and {{to contribute to the}} treatment. The studies were made at the Dept. of Obstetrics and gymecology, Okayama University Medical School, on 77 cases of laparotomy. The basal metabolism was measured by Knipping's apparatus before and after the operation and the value obtained was referred to Harris-Benedict's table to determine the percentage of the basal metabolism. The summary of the results is as follows: 1. Normal value was discussed in the evaluation of 26 healthy nonpregnant woman who had not been suffered from any serious diseases. It was 11. 27 % 13. 16 ≧m≧ 9. 38 21. 07 ≧x(0) ≧ 1. 47 2. In 77 cases <b>before</b> <b>operation,</b> it was 17. 41 % on the average and was significantly increased compared with the normal value. 3. In the analysis of these values, the basal metabolism of cases with fibroma uteri and carcimoma of the cervix was significantly increased compared with those of the healthy women. On the other hand, those of the cases with benign ovarian tumors had no significant increase. 4. Each value which was measured on the 5 th, 10 th and 15 th day after operation, had a close relation with that <b>before</b> <b>operation.</b> That is, in cases which had high values <b>before</b> <b>operation,</b> basal metabolism dropped after operation and in cases with low values, it was accelerated after operation. These tendency was observed in all cases. 5. As to analysis of values of each disease, cases with fibroma uteri was accelerated significantly on the 10 th day after operation as compared with those <b>before</b> <b>operation</b> and of the 5 th day after operation. In cases with benign ovarian tumors no significant difference was obtained between values after and <b>before</b> <b>operation.</b> Measurements of patients with carcinoma of the cervix were taken on the 5 th, 10 th, 15 th, and 20 th after operation and {{there was no significant difference}} each other between these values. But the average value which was measured on discharge was significantly lower than those <b>before</b> <b>operation</b> and of the 20 th day after operation. 6.
