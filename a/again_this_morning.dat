The lugger came down this way first, but we made her out, and showed a blue light. She must have turned and gone back <b>again,</b> for <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> at daylight we made her out to the east. The cutter was giving chase, and at first ran down fast towards her. Then the smugglers got the wind, and the last we saw of them they were running up the Channel, the cutter some three miles astern.|$|R
50|$|On September 13, Field <b>again</b> wrote:Started <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> in {{expectation}} {{of a long}} drive across the plain before us, but when about four miles from camp met Meek’s wife in company with a friend, returning {{with the news that}} they had found no water as yet and requesting all who were at the spring to remain there until he found a camp and returned or sent word back for them to come on. Nothing remained for us to do but drive back to the camp we had just left, where we found Teatherow’s company also, so if misery loves company here is enough of it, for this small camping spot is nearly eaten out by our own large stock of cattle, and to add to all this there are some in the company nearly out of provisions.|$|R

I am quite willing to go anywhere; for, among the other strange fancies that have got possession of me, I have an idea that I shall feel more completely lost to Midwinter if I move out of the neighborhood in which his letters are addressed to me. I was awake and thinking of him <b>again</b> last night. <b>This</b> <b>morning</b> I have finally decided to write to him no more.|$|R

6000|$|... "Why, Kennedy, what {{on earth}} {{have you been doing}} to yourself? This is what comes of gallivanting about after dark. When we came round, {{yesterday}} evening, to go out with you as usual, you were not in. There was nothing very unusual in that, for these evening walks of yours are often prolonged; but we called again, on our return at eleven o'clock, and found you were still absent. This looked serious. We came round <b>again</b> at six <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> for we were anxious about you, and learned you had not been in all night, and, on enquiring, heard that Callaghan was also absent.|$|R
6000|$|I am nearly dead with dyspepsia, over-smoking, and unremunerative overwork. Last night, I {{went to bed}} by seven; woke {{up again}} about ten for a minute to find myself light- headed and {{altogether}} off my legs; went to sleep <b>again,</b> and woke <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> fairly fit. I have crippled on to p. 101, but I haven't read it yet, so do not boast. What kills me is the frame of mind {{of one of the}} characters; I cannot get it through. Of course that does not interfere with my total inability to write; so that yesterday I was a living half- hour upon a single clause and have a gallery of variants that would surprise you. And this sort of trouble (which I cannot avoid) unfortunately produces nothing when done but alembication and the far-fetched. Well, read it with mercy! ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Certainly,” said Will, laughing; “I {{had quite}} {{forgotten}} that I am clothed in strange garments. I am a midshipman {{belonging to the}} Tartar. One of my companions is a boatswain’s mate, {{and the other is}} an A.B. on the same ship. We were sent with a lieutenant and ten men to overhaul a craft which, though she was somewhat suspicious looking, seemed to have but a small crew. When we got alongside her, however, we found to our disgust that she was manned by at least a hundred Algerines. The lieutenant and seven of the crew were killed, and three others, my two companions, and myself were made prisoners and carried to Algiers. We three escaped, and, capturing the small craft which you will see lying by the side of your ship, made for the open sea. An Algerine nearly recaptured us in the gale yesterday, but fortunately she carried away her mast and we <b>again</b> escaped. <b>This</b> <b>morning</b> we saw two ships approaching us, and when we made out their nationalities we knew there was bound to be a fight. Naturally we made for your ship, and when we found that the French had boarded you we did our best to aid you to drive them back. My name is Gilmore.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think if}} I had {{the naming of}} the animals over <b>again,</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> I shouldn't call snakes 'snakes'; should you, Eve?" [...] laughed Basil in {{intricate}} acknowledgment of his happiness.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{they got}} drunk last night and, as they won't have fairly slept it off, {{they will be}} {{beginning}} <b>again</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> The old man will look them up, and get them off." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{have heard}} from the Kernel.[19] Wa'al, sir, sayin' as he minded to locate himself {{with us for a}} week, I {{expected}} to {{have heard from}} him <b>again</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> but have not. Beard comes to-morrow.|$|E
6000|$|Since I came to {{this place}} I have been very restless, wasting my {{energies}} in the futile beginning of ill-conceived books. One does not settle down very readily at two and forty to {{a new way of}} living, and I have found myself with the teeming interests of the life I have abandoned still buzzing like a swarm of homeless bees in my head. My mind has been full of confused protests and justifications. In any case I should have found difficulties enough in expressing the complex thing I have to tell, but it has added greatly to my trouble that I have a great analogue, that a certain Niccolo Machiavelli chanced to fall out of politics at very much the age I have reached, and wrote a book to engage the restlessness of his mind, very much as I have wanted to do. He wrote about the relation of the great constructive spirit in politics to individual character and weaknesses, and so far his achievement lies like a deep rut in the road of my intention. It has taken me far astray. It is a matter of many weeks now--diversified indeed by some long drives into the mountains behind us and a memorable sail to Genoa across the blue and purple waters that drowned Shelley--since I began a laboured and futile imitation of [...] "The Prince." [...] I sat up late last night with the jumbled accumulation; and at last made a little fire of olive twigs and burnt it all, sheet by sheet--to begin <b>again</b> clear <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b>|$|R
50|$|Football in Paris, October 28A rugby {{football}} {{match was}} played {{today at the}} Velodrome Municipal at Vincennes between Moseley Wanderers and a team representing the full strength of France. A crowd of 10,000 persons was present. The French team held the advantage from the first and ultimately gained victory by 27 points to 8. The defeat of the Moseley team which was a strong one may be attributed partly to the fatigue of the journey. They only arrived in Paris <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> and have to leave <b>again</b> <b>this</b> evening. - Reuters.|$|R

60|$|<b>This</b> Sunday <b>morning,</b> {{seeing the}} frost among the tangled, still savage bushes of Sardinia, my soul thrilled <b>again.</b> <b>This</b> {{was not all}} known. This was not all worked out. Life {{was not only a}} process of rediscovering backwards. It is that, also: and it is that intensely. Italy has given me back I know not what of myself, but a very, very great deal. She has found for me so much that was lost: like a {{restored}} Osiris. But <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> in the omnibus I realize that, apart from the great rediscovery backwards, which one must make before one can be whole at all, there is a move forwards. There are unknown, unworked lands where the salt has not lost its savour. But one must have perfected oneself in the great past first.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘We were; {{we had a}} very {{pleasant}} conversation; but we took perhaps a glass more than that fine fellow of a Prince has been accustomed to,’ said the Governor; ‘and I observe <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> that he seems a little off his mettle.
