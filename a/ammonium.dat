5|$|Treatment of hexachloroplatinic acid with an <b>ammonium</b> salt, such as <b>ammonium</b> chloride, gives <b>ammonium</b> hexachloroplatinate, {{which is}} {{relatively}} insoluble in <b>ammonium</b> solutions. Heating this <b>ammonium</b> {{salt in the}} presence of hydrogen reduces it to elemental platinum. Potassium hexachloroplatinate is similarly insoluble, and hexachloroplatinic acid has been used in the determination of potassium ions by gravimetry.|$|E
5|$|Thus, the <b>ammonium</b> ion, , {{plays the}} same role in liquid ammonia as does the {{hydronium}} ion in water and the amide ion, , {{is analogous to the}} hydroxide ion. <b>Ammonium</b> salts behave as acids, and amides behave as bases.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ammonium</b> heptamolybdate {{is used in}} {{biological}} staining.|$|E
5|$|Carl von Sickingen {{researched}} platinum {{extensively in}} 1772. He {{succeeded in making}} malleable platinum by alloying it with gold, dissolving the alloy in hot aqua regia, precipitating the platinum with <b>ammonium</b> chloride, igniting the <b>ammonium</b> chloroplatinate, and hammering the resulting finely divided platinum to make it cohere. Franz Karl Achard made the first platinum crucible in 1784. He worked with the platinum by fusing it with arsenic, then later volatilizing the arsenic.|$|E
5|$|In a {{chemical}} laboratory, it is prepared by treating an aqueous solution of <b>ammonium</b> chloride with sodium nitrite.|$|E
5|$|It {{was named}} by Wollaston in 1802 after the {{asteroid}} 2 Pallas, {{which had been}} discovered two months earlier. Wollaston found palladium in crude platinum ore from South America by dissolving the ore in aqua regia, neutralizing the solution with sodium hydroxide, and precipitating platinum as <b>ammonium</b> chloroplatinate with <b>ammonium</b> chloride. He added mercuric cyanide to form the compound palladium(II) cyanide, which was heated to extract palladium metal.|$|E
5|$|Nitrogen {{compounds}} have a {{very long}} history, <b>ammonium</b> chloride having been known to Herodotus. They were well known by the Middle Ages. Alchemists knew nitric acid as aqua fortis (strong water), {{as well as other}} nitrogen compounds such as <b>ammonium</b> salts and nitrate salts. The mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acids was known as aqua regia (royal water), celebrated for its ability to dissolve gold, the king of metals.|$|E
5|$|One {{suitable}} {{method for}} purification for the raw platinum, which contains platinum, gold, {{and the other}} platinum-group metals, is to process it with aqua regia, in which palladium, gold and platinum are dissolved, whereas osmium, iridium, ruthenium and rhodium stay unreacted. The gold is precipitated {{by the addition of}} iron(II) chloride and after filtering off the gold, the platinum is precipitated as <b>ammonium</b> chloroplatinate by the addition of <b>ammonium</b> chloride. <b>Ammonium</b> chloroplatinate can be converted to platinum by heating. Unprecipitated hexachloroplatinate(IV) may be reduced with elemental zinc, and a similar method is suitable for small scale recovery of platinum from laboratory residues. Mining and refining platinum has environmental impacts.|$|E
5|$|Along with {{carnotite}} and roscoelite, vanadinite {{is one of}} {{the main}} industrial ores of the element vanadium, which can be extracted by roasting and smelting. Vanadinite is also occasionally used as a source of lead. A common process for extracting the vanadium begins with the heating of vanadinite with salt (NaCl) or sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) at about 850°C to produce sodium vanadate (NaVO3). This is dissolved in water and then treated with <b>ammonium</b> chloride to give an orange-coloured precipitate of <b>ammonium</b> metavanadate. This is then melted to form a crude form of vanadium pentoxide (V2O5). Reduction of vanadium pentoxide with calcium gives pure vanadium.|$|E
5|$|Azotobacter {{species are}} free-living, nitrogen-fixing bacteria; in {{contrast}} to Rhizobium species, they normally fix molecular nitrogen from the atmosphere without symbiotic relations with plants, although some Azotobacter species are associated with plants. Nitrogen fixation is inhibited {{in the presence of}} available nitrogen sources, such as <b>ammonium</b> ions and nitrates.|$|E
5|$|Crushed {{minerals}} {{are treated}} with hot concentrated sulfuric acid to produce water-soluble sulfates of rare earths. Thorium precipitates out of solution as hydroxide and is removed. After that the solution is treated with <b>ammonium</b> oxalate to convert rare earths into their insoluble oxalates. The oxalates are converted to oxides by annealing. The oxides are dissolved in nitric acid that excludes {{one of the main}} components, cerium, whose oxide is insoluble in HNO3. Several rare earth metals, including lutetium, are separated as a double salt with <b>ammonium</b> nitrate by crystallization. Lutetium is separated by ion exchange. In this process, rare-earth ions are sorbed onto suitable ion-exchange resin by exchange with hydrogen, <b>ammonium</b> or cupric ions present in the resin. Lutetium salts are then selectively washed out by suitable complexing agent. Lutetium metal is then obtained by reduction of anhydrous LuCl3 or LuF3 by either an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{microwave}} synthetic {{methods have}} also been reported. Rhodocenium hexafluorophosphate forms after reaction of cyclopentadiene and rhodium(III) chloride hydrate in methanol following work-up with methanolic <b>ammonium</b> hexafluorophosphate; the reaction yield exceeds 60% with only 30 seconds of exposure to microwave radiation.|$|E
5|$|Office {{space was}} {{initially}} {{found in the}} Monsanto offices at 1515 Nicholas Rd, which became known as Unit I. Unit II was the Monsanto Rocket Propellant works off Betty Lane near Ohio State Route 741. While it was administered by Monsanto, it was not used by the Dayton Project. The site handled explosives including <b>ammonium</b> nitrate and <b>ammonium</b> picrate, but no radioactive materials were handled there. Work at Unit II ceased {{in the fall of}} 1945. Consideration was given to using it in December 1946, but this proposal was rejected in favor of erecting a Quonset hut at Unit III.|$|E
5|$|Operations {{during the}} 19th century {{focused on the}} {{production}} of kerosene, lamp oil, and paraffin; these products helped supply the growing demand for lighting that arose during the Industrial Revolution. Fuel oil, lubricating oil and grease, and <b>ammonium</b> sulfate were also produced.|$|E
5|$|Several {{chemical}} tests {{can be used}} to confirm the identify of the mushroom. A drop of ferrous sulfate (FeSO4) on the flesh turns it greenish, while potassium hydroxide (KOH) turns it brown. The cap cuticle turns yellow with nitric acid (HNO3), and yellow with <b>ammonium</b> hydroxide (NH4OH).|$|E
5|$|Sodium borates {{are used}} as a flux for {{soldering}} silver and gold and with <b>ammonium</b> chloride for welding ferrous metals. They are also fire retarding additives to plastics and rubber articles.|$|E
5|$|Actinium trichloride is {{obtained}} by reacting actinium hydroxide or oxalate with carbon tetrachloride vapors at temperatures above 960°C. Similar to oxyfluoride, actinium oxychloride {{can be prepared}} by hydrolyzing actinium trichloride with <b>ammonium</b> hydroxide at 1000°C. However, {{in contrast to the}} oxyfluoride, the oxychloride could well be synthesized by igniting a solution of actinium trichloride in hydrochloric acid with ammonia.|$|E
5|$|After production, the fermium must be {{separated}} from other actinides and from lanthanide fission products. This is usually achieved by ion-exchange chromatography, with the standard process using a cation exchanger such as Dowex50 or TEVA eluted with a solution of <b>ammonium</b> α-hydroxyisobutyrate. Smaller cations form more stable complexes with the α-hydroxyisobutyrate anion, and so are preferentially eluted from the column. A rapid fractional crystallization method has also been described.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{decomposes}} {{rapidly in}} solutions of <b>ammonium</b> acetate or the acetates, carbonates, citrates, or hydroxides of the alkali metals. It is stable in dry air, but gradually hydrolyses {{in contact with}} moisture to acetic and salicylic acids. In solution with alkalis, the hydrolysis proceeds rapidly and the clear solutions formed may consist entirely of acetate and salicylate.|$|E
5|$|Despite these successes, Parsons, {{the project}} {{engineer}} of Aerojet's Solid Fuel Department, remained motivated {{to address the}} malfunctions observed during the Ercoupe tests. In June 1942, assisted by Mills and Miller, he focused his attention on developing an effective method of restricted burning when using solid rocket fuel, as the military demanded JATOs that could provide over 100 pounds of thrust without any risk of exploding. Although solid fuels such as GALCIT-27 were more storable than their liquid counterparts, they were disfavored for military JATO use as they provided less immediate thrust {{and did not have}} the versatility of being turned on and off mid-flight. Parsons tried to resolve GALCIT-27's stability issue with GALCIT-46, which replaced the former's <b>ammonium</b> nitrate with guanidine nitrate. To avoid the problems seen with <b>ammonium</b> nitrate, he had GALCIT-46 cooled and then heated prior to testing. When it failed the test, he realized that the fuel's binding black powders rather than the oxidizers had resulted in their instability, and in June that year had the idea of using liquid asphalt as an appropriate binding agent with potassium perchlorate as oxidizer.|$|E
5|$|Hafnium was {{separated}} from zirconium through repeated recrystallization of the double <b>ammonium</b> or potassium fluorides by Valdemar Thal Jantzen and von Hevesey. Anton Eduard van Arkel and Jan Hendrik de Boer {{were the first to}} prepare metallic hafnium by passing hafnium tetraiodide vapor over a heated tungsten filament in 1924. This process for differential purification of zirconium and hafnium is still in use today.|$|E
5|$|In {{medicine}} and chemistry, SRI developed dry-powder drugs, laser photocoagulation (a treatment for some eye maladies), remote surgery (also known as telerobotic surgery), bio-agent detection using upconverting phosphor technology, the experimental anticancer drugs Tirapazamine and TAS-108, <b>ammonium</b> dinitramide (an environmentally benign oxidizer for safe and cost-effective disposal of hazardous materials), the electroactive polymer ("artificial muscle"), new uses for diamagnetic levitation, and the antimalarial drug Halofantrine.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} since the bombing, scientists, {{security}} experts, and the ATF have called on Congress to develop legislation that would require customers to produce identification when purchasing <b>ammonium</b> nitrate fertilizer, and for sellers to maintain records of its sale. Critics argue that farmers lawfully use large quantities of the fertilizer, and as of 2009, only Nevada and South Carolina require identification from purchasers. In June 1995, Congress enacted legislation requiring chemical taggants to be incorporated into dynamite and other explosives so that a bomb could be traced to its manufacturer. In 2008, Honeywell announced that it had developed a nitrogen-based fertilizer that would not detonate when mixed with fuel oil. The company got assistance from the Department of Homeland Security to develop the fertilizer (Sulf-N 26) for commercial use. It uses <b>ammonium</b> sulfate to make the fertilizer less explosive.|$|E
5|$|Oil shale is {{used for}} cement {{production}} by Kunda Nordic Cement in Estonia, by Holcim in Germany, and by Fushun cement factory in China. Oil shale {{can also be used}} for production of different chemical products, construction materials, and pharmaceutical products, e.g. <b>ammonium</b> bituminosulfonate. However, use of oil shale for production of these products is still very rare and in experimental stages only.|$|E
5|$|Protactinium iodides {{result from}} the oxides and {{aluminium}} iodide or <b>ammonium</b> iodide heated to 600°C. Protactinium(III) iodide was obtained by heating protactinium(V) iodide in vacuum. As with oxides, protactinium forms mixed halides with alkali metals. Among those, most remarkable is Na3PaF8 where protactinium ion is symmetrically surrounded by 8 F− ions which form a nearly perfect cube.|$|E
5|$|Selected {{heavy metals}} {{are used as}} {{catalysts}} in fuel processing (rhenium, for example), synthetic rubber and fibre production (bismuth), emission control devices (palladium), and in self-cleaning ovens (where cerium(IV) oxide in the walls of such ovens helps oxidise carbon-based cooking residues). In soap chemistry, heavy metals form insoluble soaps {{that are used in}} lubricating greases, paint dryers, and fungicides (apart from lithium, the alkali metals and the <b>ammonium</b> ion form soluble soaps).|$|E
5|$|Several {{chemical}} tests {{can be employed}} {{in the field to}} aid in the identification of S.pungens. With an application of a drop of KOH, the flesh will turn vinaceous (the color of red wine), the tubes red, the cap cuticle black, and the stipe cuticle pale vinaceous. With <b>ammonium</b> hydroxide (NH4OH), the flesh becomes very pale vinaceous, and the tubes turn bright red. Iron(II) sulfate (FeSO4) turns the flesh gray, the tubes dark gray to black, and the stipe cuticle light gray.|$|E
5|$|Several {{chemical}} tests {{can be used}} to distinguish I.torosus from other similar boletes, such as I.rhodopurpureus. I.torosus displays the following characteristic colour changes with tests performed on cut flesh less than 12 hours old: <b>ammonium</b> hydroxide (NH4OH)–yellow centre bordered by a blue circular outer ring; potassium hydroxide (KOH)– deep buff (instantly); ferrous sulphate (FeS04)–no change; Melzer's reagent–dark blue; phenol–blue green (very slow); formalin–mid blue (slow).|$|E
5|$|Several {{chemical}} tests {{can be used}} to help identify the mushroom. A drop of <b>ammonium</b> hydroxide solution turns the cap cuticle a greenish to bluish colour. Application of iron(II) sulphate solution causes the flesh to stain a dull bluish-green, while the pores turn golden brown with a drop of dilute potassium hydroxide.|$|E
5|$|Several {{chemical}} tests {{can be used}} to help verify an identification of L.rugosiceps. A drop of <b>ammonium</b> hydroxide solution turns the cap cuticle a reddish color or is unreactive, and yellow or unreactive on the flesh. A drop of dilute potassium hydroxide (KOH) turns the cap surface red, and the flesh yellowish to orangish. Application of iron (II) sulphate solution produces a gray color on the cap surface, and greenish-gray to olive coloration on the flesh.|$|E
5|$|The Haber-Bosch {{method for}} synthesizing <b>ammonium</b> nitrate {{represented}} {{a major breakthrough}} and allowed crop yields to overcome previous constraints. It was first patented by German chemist Fritz Haber. In 1910 Carl Bosch, while working for German chemical company BASF, successfully commercialized the process and secured further patents. In the years after World War II, the use of synthetic fertilizer increased rapidly, {{in sync with the}} increasing world population.|$|E
5|$|To extract plutonium, neutron-irradiated uranium is {{dissolved}} in nitric acid, and a reducing agent (FeSO4, or H2O2) {{is added to}} the resulting solution. This addition changes the oxidation state of plutonium from +6 to +4, while uranium remains in the form of uranyl nitrate (UO2(NO3)2). The solution is treated with a reducing agent and neutralized with <b>ammonium</b> carbonate to pH = 8 that results in precipitation of Pu4+ compounds.|$|E
5|$|Trace {{amounts of}} ammonia, acetylene, ethane, propane, {{phosphine}} and methane {{have been detected}} in Saturn's atmosphere. The upper clouds are composed of ammonia crystals, while the lower level clouds appear to consist of either <b>ammonium</b> hydrosulfide (NH4SH) or water. Ultraviolet radiation from the Sun causes methane photolysis in the upper atmosphere, leading {{to a series of}} hydrocarbon chemical reactions with the resulting products being carried downward by eddies and diffusion. This photochemical cycle is modulated by Saturn's annual seasonal cycle.|$|E
5|$|Separation of {{trivalent}} actinides from lanthanide {{fission products}} {{can be done}} by a cation-exchange resin column using a 90% water/10% ethanol solution saturated with hydrochloric acid (HCl) as eluant. It is usually followed by anion-exchange chromatography using 6 molar HCl as eluant. A cation-exchange resin column (Dowex-50 exchange column) treated with <b>ammonium</b> salts is then used to separate fractions containing elements 99, 100 and 101. These elements can be then identified simply based on their elution position/time, using α-hydroxyisobutyrate solution (α-HIB), for example, as eluant.|$|E
5|$|Several {{chemical}} tests {{can be used}} to help verify an identification of L.holopus. A drop of <b>ammonium</b> hydroxide solution turns the cap cuticle a pinkish color, but has no reaction with the flesh. A drop of dilute potassium hydroxide (KOH) has no reaction on the cap surface, and either no reaction or a brownish reaction with the flesh. Application of iron (II) sulphate solution does not have a reaction on the cap surface, and either no reaction to slightly olive coloration on the flesh.|$|E
25|$|Treatment with an <b>ammonium</b> salt, such as <b>ammonium</b> chloride, {{precipitates}} solid <b>ammonium</b> hexachloroplatinate,. Heating the <b>ammonium</b> salt in hydrogen reduces it to elemental platinum. Platinum {{is often}} isolated from ores or recycled from residues thus.|$|E
