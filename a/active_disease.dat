5|$|A {{number of}} factors make people more {{susceptible}} to TB infections. The most important risk factor globally is HIV; 13% of all people with TB are infected by the virus. This is a particular problem in sub-Saharan Africa, where rates of HIV are high. Of people without HIV who are infected with tuberculosis, about 5–10% develop <b>active</b> <b>disease</b> during their lifetimes; in contrast, 30% of those coinfected with HIV develop the <b>active</b> <b>disease.</b>|$|E
5|$|Herpes simplex is a {{viral disease}} {{caused by the}} herpes simplex virus. Infections are {{categorized}} based {{on the part of the}} body infected. Oral herpes involves the face or mouth. It may result in small blisters in groups often called cold sores or fever blisters or may just cause a sore throat. Genital herpes, often simply known as herpes, may have minimal symptoms or form blisters that break open and result in small ulcers. These typically heal over two to four weeks. Tingling or shooting pains may occur before the blisters appear. Herpes cycles between periods of <b>active</b> <b>disease</b> followed by periods without symptoms. The first episode is often more severe and may be associated with fever, muscle pains, swollen lymph nodes and headaches. Over time, episodes of <b>active</b> <b>disease</b> decrease in frequency and severity. Other disorders caused by herpes simplex include: herpetic whitlow when it involves the fingers, herpes of the eye, herpes infection of the brain, and neonatal herpes when it affects a newborn, among others.|$|E
5|$|In many people, the {{infection}} waxes and wanes. Tissue destruction and necrosis are often balanced by healing and fibrosis. Affected tissue {{is replaced by}} scarring and cavities filled with caseous necrotic material. During <b>active</b> <b>disease,</b> some of these cavities are joined to the air passages bronchi and this material can be coughed up. It contains living bacteria, so can spread {{the infection}}. Treatment with appropriate antibiotics kills bacteria and allows healing to take place. Upon cure, affected areas are eventually replaced by scar tissue.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Interferon-gamma release assays {{may be used}} as an {{alternative}} to the tuberculin skin test for detection of M. tuberculosis infection. However, the risk of <b>active</b> tuberculosis <b>disease</b> following screening using interferon-gamma release assays in immigrants is not well defined. To address these uncertainties, we determined the incidence rates of <b>active</b> tuberculosis <b>disease</b> in a cohort of high-risk immigrants with Class B TB screened with interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) upon arrival in the United States. Methods Using a retrospective cohort design, we enrolled recent U. S. immigrants with Class B TB who were screened with an IGRA (QuantiFERON ® Gold or Gold In-Tube Assay) at the San Francisco Department of Public Health Tuberculosis Control Clinic from January 2005 through December 2010. We reviewed records from the Tuberculosis Control Patient Management Database and from the California Department of Public Health Tuberculosis Case Registry to determine incident cases of <b>active</b> tuberculosis <b>disease</b> through February 2015. Results Of 1233 eligible immigrants with IGRA screening at baseline, 81 (6. 6  %) were diagnosed with <b>active</b> tuberculosis <b>disease</b> as a result of their initial evaluation. Of the remaining 1152 participants without <b>active</b> tuberculosis <b>disease</b> at baseline, 513 tested IGRA-positive and 639 tested IGRA-negative. Seven participants developed incident <b>active</b> tuberculosis <b>disease</b> over 7730 person-years of follow-up, for an incidence rate of 91 per 100, 000 person-years (95  % CI 43 – 190). Five IGRA-positive and two IGRA-negative participants developed <b>active</b> tuberculosis <b>disease</b> (incidence rates 139 per 100, 000 person-years (95  % CI 58 – 335) and 48 per 100, 000 person-years (95  % CI 12 – 193), respectively) for an unadjusted incidence rate ratio of 2. 9 (95  % CI 0. 5 – 30, p[*]=[*] 0. 21). IGRA test results had a negative predictive value of 99. 7  % but a positive predictive value of only 0. 97  %. Conclusions Among high-risk immigrants without <b>active</b> tuberculosis <b>disease</b> at the time of entry into the United States, risk of progression to <b>active</b> tuberculosis <b>disease</b> was higher in IGRA-positive participants compared with IGRA-negative participants. However, these findings did not reach statistical significance, and a positive IGRA at enrollment had a poor predictive value for progressing to <b>active</b> tuberculosis <b>disease.</b> Additional research is needed to identify biomarkers and develop clinical algorithms that can better predict progression to <b>active</b> tuberculosis <b>disease</b> among U. S. immigrants...|$|R

The patient group consisted of 180 patients with <b>active</b> TB <b>disease</b> (culture-positive for MTB) and 50 screening contacts with LTBI-positive response to the QFT- 2 G test. We prospectively performed a tuberculin skin test (TST) and a QFT- 2 G test for all subjects.

25|$|Ulcerative colitis {{patients}} typically {{present with}} rectal bleeding, diarrhea, tenesmus (urgent desire {{to evacuate the}} bowels but {{with the passage of}} little stool), and lower abdominal pain. The severity of disease at clinical presentation is important in determining the appropriate therapy. Patients with mildly <b>active</b> <b>disease</b> will have fewer than 4 bowel movements daily and no signs of toxicity. Individuals with moderate-severity UC have more frequent bowel movements with bleeding. Approximately 70% of patients with ulcerative colitis will have moderately <b>active</b> <b>disease</b> at presentation. Patients with severely <b>active</b> <b>disease</b> will have signs of toxicity with fever, tachycardia, and anemia. Patients with fulminant or toxic colitis or toxic megacolon often have more than 10 bowel movements in a day, continuous bleeding, abdominal distention and tenderness, and radiologic evidence of edema and, in some cases, bowel dilation. These people most often require immediate colectomy because 10% have perforated colon at the time of surgery.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND—Crohn's {{disease is}} a chronic {{inflammatory}} disease of the alimentary tract. Azathioprine is an effective agent {{in the management of}} chronic <b>active</b> Crohn's <b>disease</b> leading to long term remission of disease activity. Such treatment leads to limited efficacy or side effects in a small subset of patients.  AIMS—To compare efficacy and side effects of treatment with azathioprine plus corticosteroids versus mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) plus corticosteroids in patients with chronic <b>active</b> Crohn's <b>disease.</b>  METHODS—Seventy patients with chronic <b>active</b> Crohn's <b>disease</b> (Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) greater than 150) were randomised for treatment with azathioprine/cortisone or MMF/cortisone. Corticosteroid dosage was tapered according to a standard protocol. Disease activity was monitored by clinical scores after one, two, three, and six months.  RESULTS—Treatment of patients with moderately active (CDAI 150 - 300) Crohn's disease with MMF/cortisone led to a significant reduction in clinical activity scores comparable to treatment with azathioprine/cortisone. Treatment of patients with highly <b>active</b> Crohn's <b>disease</b> (CDAI greater than 300) with MMF/cortisone caused significant suppression of clinical activity earlier than azathioprine/cortisone treatment. Treatment with MMF/cortisone was associated with few adverse effects.  CONCLUSION—Treatment of chronic <b>active</b> Crohn's <b>disease</b> with MMF plus cortisone appears to be effective and well tolerated and should be considered in patients allergic to azathioprine or in whom azathioprine has failed. ...|$|R

25|$|Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a {{long-term}} condition that results in inflammation and ulcers of the colon and rectum. The primary symptom of <b>active</b> <b>disease</b> is abdominal pain and diarrhea mixed with blood. Weight loss, fever, and anemia may also occur.

Complications may include megacolon, inflammation of the eye, joints, or liver, and colon cancer.|$|E
25|$|Management of {{ulcerative}} colitis involves first treating the acute {{symptoms of the}} disease, then maintaining remission.

40|$|Aims To characterise the {{predominant}} species of bacterial populations associated with duodenal biopsies of paediatric patients with active and treated coeliac disease. Methods 20 biopsy specimens from patients with <b>active</b> coeliac <b>disease,</b> 12 from patients with treated coeliac disease, and eight from age-matched controls were evaluated for comparative purposes. Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium and {{lactic acid bacteria}} (LAB) populations were analysed by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis using group-specific primers. Results Bacteroides diversity was higher in biopsy specimens from controls than in those from patients with active and treated coeliac disease. Bacteroides distasonis, Bacteroides fragilis/Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides uniformis and Bacteroides ovatus were more abundant in controls than in patients with coeliac disease (p< 0. 05). Bacteroides vulgatus was more frequently detected in controls than in patients with treated coeliac disease (p< 0. 01). Bacteroides dorei was more common in patients with <b>active</b> coeliac <b>disease</b> than in those with treated coeliac disease and control children (p< 0. 01). Bifidobacterium diversity was higher in patients with coeliac disease than in controls.
