5|$|The {{songs on}} Devil's Halo {{featured}} an eclectic fusion of styles, including alternative rock, soul, and jazz-rock. Ndegéocello's spiritually complex <b>and</b> <b>ambiguous</b> lyrics spoke of romantic love and loneliness, among other themes. Released by Downtown Records on October 6, 2009, Devil's Halo charted modestly but was well received by most critics.|$|E
5|$|For {{the size}} of limitanei units, opinion is divided. Jones and Elton suggest from the scarce <b>and</b> <b>ambiguous</b> {{literary}} evidence that border legiones numbered c. 1,000 men and that the other units contained {{in the region of}} 500 men each. Others draw on papyrus and more recent archaeological evidence to argue that limitanei units probably averaged about half the Jones/Elton strength i.e. c. 500 for legiones and around 250 for other units.|$|E
5|$|Shiloh {{has three}} sequels, Shiloh Season, Saving Shiloh, and A Shiloh Christmas {{published}} in 1996, 1997, and 2015 respectively. In Shiloh Season, Naylor renews the strife by restoring Judd's hostility and aggravating {{it with a}} bout of drinking issues. Marty fears Judd will take back Shiloh and be faithless to the deal they made. Whereas in Shiloh Marty confronts the confusing <b>and</b> <b>ambiguous</b> concept of morality, in Shiloh Season he must face the notion of wickedness.|$|E

5|$|The {{demarcation}} between carnivorous and protocarnivorous is blurred by {{the lack}} of a strict definition of botanical carnivory <b>and</b> <b>ambiguous</b> academic literature on the subject. Many examples of protocarnivorous plants exist, some of which are counted among the ranks of true carnivorous plants as a matter of historical preference. Further research into these plants' carnivorous adaptations may reveal that a few protocarnivorous plants do meet the more rigid definition of a carnivorous plant.|$|E
5|$|After signing to Mercury Records, the New York Dolls {{recorded}} the album at The Record Plant in New York with producer Todd Rundgren, {{who was known}} for his sophisticated pop tastes and held a lukewarm opinion of the band. Despite stories of conflicts during the recording sessions, lead singer David Johansen and guitarist Sylvain Sylvain later said Rundgren successfully captured how the band sounded live. Their music on the album incorporates carefree rock and roll, Brill Building pop influences, and campy sensibilities, while Johansen's colloquial <b>and</b> <b>ambiguous</b> lyrics explore themes of urban youth, teen alienation, adolescent romance, and authenticity.|$|E
5|$|Anson {{argues that}} some Hellenic authors {{expressed}} complex or even ever-changing <b>and</b> <b>ambiguous</b> {{ideas about the}} exact ethnic identity of the Macedonians, who were considered by some such as Aristotle in his Politics as barbarians and others as semi-Greek or fully Greek. Roger D. Woodard asserts {{that in addition to}} persisting uncertainty in modern times about the proper classification of the Macedonian language and its relation to Greek, ancient authors also presented conflicting ideas about the Macedonians. Any preconceived ethnic differences between Greeks and Macedonians faded by 148BC soon after the Roman conquest of Macedonia and then the rest of Greece with the defeat of the Achaean League by the Roman Republic at the Battle of Corinth (146 BC).|$|E

5|$|Yuri on Ice {{has raised}} {{discussion}} concerning its {{depiction of a}} same-sex relationship between its protagonists, with some critics praising it for covering homosexuality {{in a way that}} differs from most anime and manga such as yaoi, and for dealing with homosexuality in a country and sport that has present-day issues with homophobia; others criticised its depiction for being unrealistic <b>and</b> <b>ambiguous.</b> The series has also been praised for its depiction of anxiety, and also raised a brief controversy concerning a similar figure skating-based title to be released in the United States in 2017.|$|E
5|$|The novel {{begins the}} day before an {{audience}} that Ai has obtained with Argaven Harge, the king of Karhide. Ai manages this through the help of Estraven, the prime minister, who seems to believe in Ai's mission, but {{the night before the}} audience, Estraven tells Ai that he can no longer support Ai's cause with the king. Ai begins to doubt Estraven's loyalty because of his strange mannerisms, which Ai finds effeminate <b>and</b> <b>ambiguous.</b> The behavior of people in Karhide is dictated by shifgrethor, an intricate set of unspoken social rules and formal courtesy. Ai does not understand this system, thus making it difficult for him to understand Estraven's motives, and contributing to his distrust of Estraven. The next day, as he prepares to meet the King, Ai learns that Estraven has been accused of treason, and exiled from the country. The pretext for Estraven's exile was his handling of a border dispute with the neighboring country of Orgoreyn, in which Estraven was seen as being too conciliatory. Ai meets with the king, who rejects his offer to join the Ekumen. Discouraged, Ai decides to travel through Karhide, as the spring has just begun, rendering the interior of the country accessible.|$|E
5|$|The second {{episode in}} Bismarck's {{unification}} efforts occurred in 1866. In {{concert with the}} newly formed Italy, Bismarck created a diplomatic environment in which Austria declared war on Prussia. The dramatic prelude to the war occurred largely in Frankfurt, where the two powers claimed to speak for all the German states in the parliament. In April 1866, the Prussian representative in Florence signed a secret agreement with the Italian government, committing each state to assist {{the other in a}} war against Austria. The next day, the Prussian delegate to the Frankfurt assembly presented a plan calling for a national constitution, a directly elected national Diet, and universal suffrage. German liberals were justifiably skeptical of this plan, having witnessed Bismarck's difficult <b>and</b> <b>ambiguous</b> relationship with the Prussian Landtag (State Parliament), a relationship characterized by Bismarck's cajoling and riding roughshod over the representatives. These skeptics saw the proposal as a ploy to enhance Prussian power rather than a progressive agenda of reform.|$|E

5|$|Just as {{with its}} land counterpart, the exact {{size of the}} Byzantine navy and its units {{is a matter of}} {{considerable}} debate, owing to the scantness <b>and</b> <b>ambiguous</b> nature of the primary sources. One exception are the numbers for the late 9th and early 10th century, for which we possess a more detailed breakdown, dated to the Cretan expedition of 911. These lists reveal that during the reign of Leo VI the Wise, the navy reached 34,200 oarsmen and perhaps as many as 8,000 marines. The central Imperial Fleet totalled some 19,600 oarsmen and 4,000 marines under the command of the droungarios of the basilikon plōimon. These four thousand marines were professional soldiers, first recruited as a corps by Basil I in the 870s. They were a great asset to the Imperial Fleet, for whereas previously it had depended on thematic and tagmatic soldiers for its marines, the new force provided a more reliable, better trained and immediately available force at the Emperor's disposal. The high status of these marines is illustrated {{by the fact that they}} were considered to belong to the imperial tagmata, and were organized along similar lines. The Aegean thematic fleet numbered 2,610 oarsmen and 400 marines, the Cibyrrhaeot fleet stood at 5,710 oarsmen and 1,000 marines, the Samian fleet at 3,980 oarsmen and 600 marines, and finally, the Theme of Hellas furnished 2,300 oarsmen with a portion of its 2,000 thematic soldiers doubling as marines.|$|E
