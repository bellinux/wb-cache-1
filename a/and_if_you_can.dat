500|$|Rayner {{described}} Scherger as [...] "the most quoted {{and best}} known of contemporary military leaders" [...] in Australia from 1957 to 1966, recognised and admired by civilian and soldier alike. Detractors accused him of cunning and excessive politicking, Air Marshal Williams declaring that Scherger favoured his friends in the service and later in TAA and CAC, and Prime Minister John Gorton famously calling him [...] "a politician in uniform". Scherger was also labelled a self-publicist, but argued [...] "...you can't sell your ideas unless you can sell yourself, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> sell yourself you're half way to selling the ideas that you've got". The newest of the northern air bases he proposed while CAS, near Weipa in Cape York, was opened in 1998 and named RAAF Base Scherger in his honour. His name is also borne by Sir Frederick Scherger Drive in North Turramurra, New South Wales.|$|E
500|$|The California Angels {{selected}} Wiggins as {{the eighth}} overall {{pick of the}} January 1977 MLB amateur draft. In 1977, Wiggins played junior college baseball at Pasadena City College, where he was teammates with future major leaguers Matt Young and Rod Booker. Bodet, who {{had moved to the}} Angels scouting staff just before the draft, joined other Angels staff members and worked out with Wiggins after they selected him. Angels coach Bob Clear told Wiggins that his excellent speed would help him to a high batting average even if his hitting skills were not that strong. [...] "If you can hit [...]200, you can run the other eighty points. <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> hit [...]280, you can lead off for anybody," [...] Clear said. Wiggins signed with the Angels in May for $2500 after what Bodet described as [...] "a tough negotiation". According to Bodet, Wiggins' mother [...] "did not trust easily".|$|E

500|$|When writing lyrics for {{previous}} releases, Moore would [...] "start mumbling and I try {{to figure}} out what I'm saying and then try to make it make sense". With Blood, he [...] "really wrote them down and tried to make them coherent. I didn't want it to be like 'Oh, you get your own impression of the lyrics. Everybody has their own idea!' I wanted to have an idea that I wanted to communicate, and something communicable." [...] Moore noted that he did occasionally use his [...] "mumbling" [...] method as it [...] "puts you in the right direction as far as sounds, vowel sounds, and stresses on certain syllables. <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> write some words and lyrics that match that, sometimes it flows really well." [...] He described all the songs as based on [...] "personal experiences". [...] "I'll start writing a song that has a little bit of a world view or political view or something," [...] he said, [...] "but then by the time I'm finished the lyrics it'll be about a relationship or something like that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Non-Scientologists Joel Sappell and Robert Welkos {{described}} in a 1990 article in the LA Times how Scientologists believe that when a person dies—or, in Scientology terms, when a thetan abandons its physical body—they go to a [...] "landing station" [...] on the planet Venus, where the thetan is re-implanted and told lies about its past life and its next life. The Venusians take the thetan, [...] "capsule" [...] it, and {{send it back to}} Earth to be thrown into the ocean off the coast of California. They quote Hubbard as saying, [...] "If you can get out of that, and through that, and wander around through the cities and find some girl who looks like she is going to get married or have a baby or something like that, you're all set. <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> find the maternity ward to a hospital or something, you're OK. And you just eventually just pick up a baby." ...|$|E
2500|$|Powell {{described}} {{joining the}} Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) during college {{as one of}} the happiest experiences of his life; discovering something he loved and could do well, he felt he had [...] "found himself." [...] According to Powell: It was only once I was in college, about six months into college when I found something that I liked, and that was ROTC, Reserve Officer Training Corps in the military. And I not only liked it, but I was pretty good at it. That's what you really have to look for in life, something that you like, and something that you think you're pretty good at. <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> put those two things together, then you're on the right track, and just drive on. Cadet Powell joined the Pershing Rifles, the ROTC fraternal organization and drill team begun by General John Pershing. Even after he had become a general, Powell kept on his desk a pen set he had won for a drill team competition.|$|E

2500|$|In a blog post, he {{expanded}} on this, {{discussing the}} film's symbolism, imagery and Trier's intentions, calling him [...] "one {{of the most}} heroic directors in the world" [...] and Antichrist [...] "a powerfully-made film that contains material many audiences will find repulsive or unbearable. The performances by Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg are heroic and fearless. Trier's visual command is striking. The use of music is evocative; no score, but operatic and liturgical arias. <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> think beyond what he shows to what he implies, its depth are [...] frightening." [...] Duane Dudek of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel called Antichrist [...] "Trier's most visually lush and technically rigorous film; it captures things at a molecular level and in a slow motion that all but brings the world to a halt... But paradoxically, this is his most unwatchable film, and many will find its violence and cruelty, including scenes of genital mutilation, repellent. I cannot recommend Antichrist, but {{in a culture that}} hemorrhages death and torture nightly on shows like 24 or , I can understand it." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the 2012 {{presidential primary}} campaign, {{when asked what}} the federal government’s role should be in {{responding}} to natural disasters, Romney suggested that responsibility for handling disasters should be taken from FEMA, the federal agency dedicated to disaster relief, and given to the states, or outsourced to the private sector: [...] "Every time you have an occasion to take something {{from the federal government}} and send it back to the states, that's the right direction. <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> go even further, and send it back to the private sector, that's even better. Instead of thinking in the federal budget, what we should cut -- we should ask ourselves the opposite question. What should we keep? We should take all of what we're doing at the federal level and say, what are the things we're doing that we don't have to do? And those things we've got to stop doing, because we're borrowing $1.6 trillion more this year than we're taking in." [...] Asked whether by that he specifically meant disaster relief, he replied, “we cannot afford to do those things without jeopardizing the future for our kids. It is simply immoral, in my view, for us to continue to rack up larger and larger debts and pass them on to our kids, knowing full well that we'll all be dead and gone before it's paid off. It makes no sense at all.” ...|$|E
