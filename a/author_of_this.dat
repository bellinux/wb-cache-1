5|$|A repeat {{performance}} of BWV243a may have accompanied the first performance of BWV10 on 2July 1724. The libretto of the cantata performed in Leipzig at {{the feast of}} the Visitation of 1725 survives. Maria Aurora von Königsmarck is the possible <b>author</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> Magnificat paraphrase. Around a decade before the libretto was reprinted in Leipzig it had already been set by Reinhard Keiser and Johann Mattheson. It is not known whether Bach set the libretto, neither which setting of the libretto was used for the 1725 Visitation feast in Leipzig. A year later Bach performed Der Herr wird ein Neues im Lande, JLB13, a Visitation cantata by his second cousin Johann Ludwig Bach. Picander's libretto for the Visitation cantata of 1728 may have been set as part of Bach's fourth cantata cycle: the libretto, surviving without music, starts with a dictum quoted from Luther's German translation of Luke1:46–47.|$|E
5|$|Although Tacitus {{is usually}} {{considered}} to be the most reliable <b>author</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> era, his views on Domitian are {{complicated by the fact that}} his father-in-law, Gnaeus Julius Agricola, may have been a personal enemy of the Emperor. In his biographical work Agricola, Tacitus maintains that Agricola was forced into retirement because his triumph over the Caledonians highlighted Domitian's own inadequacy as a military commander. Several modern authors such as Dorey have argued the opposite: that Agricola was in fact a close friend of Domitian, and that Tacitus merely sought to distance his family from the fallen dynasty once Nerva was in power.|$|E

25|$|Judging {{from the}} early Tang influences, the present day {{consensus}} {{on the time of}} creation of the paintings is end of 7th century.

25|$|In a meta-analytic {{study from}} 2005, {{it was found}} that SSRIs and TCAs are equally {{effective}} in treating dysthymia.

However, the <b>author</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> study cautions that MAOIs should not necessarily be {{the first line of defense}} in the treatment of dysthymia, as they are often less tolerable than their counterparts, such as SSRIs.|$|E

25|$|There {{had been}} {{an idea for a}} tour to England for some time and {{following}} the twin tours of Lord Hawke and Priestley to the West Indies in 1896-97 this idea was further developed and in June 1899 a combined West Indian eleven was invited to visit England. Lord Hawke was the <b>author</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> invitation and he then arranged a series of matches for the summer of 1900. The initial selection of the West Indies team took place after the 1899-1900 Inter-Colonial Tournament in January 1900.|$|E
25|$|Several {{studies have}} {{documented}} health and economic benefits related to smoking bans. A 2009 {{report by the}} Institute of Medicine concluded that smoking bans reduced the risk of coronary heart disease and heart attacks, but the report's authors were unable to identify {{the magnitude of this}} reduction. Also in 2009, a systematic review and meta-analysis found that bans on smoking in public places were associated with a significant reduction of incidence of heart attacks. The lead <b>author</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> meta-analysis, David Meyers, said that this review suggested that a nationwide ban on smoking in public places could prevent between 100,000 and 225,000 heart attacks in the United States each year.|$|E
25|$|Most {{scholars}} do {{not consider}} Apostle Thomas the <b>author</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> document and the author remains unknown. J. Menard produced {{a summary of the}} academic consensus in the mid-1970s which stated that the gospel was probably a very late text written by a Gnostic author, thus having very little relevance {{to the study of the}} early development of Christianity. Scholarly views of Gnosticism and the Gospel of Thomas have since become more nuanced and diverse. Paterson Brown, for example, has argued forcefully that the three Coptic Gospels of Thomas, Philip and Truth are demonstrably not Gnostic writings, since all three explicitly affirm the basic reality and sanctity of incarnate life, which Gnosticism by definition considers illusory and evil.|$|E

25|$|Despite this evidence, the {{surviving}} Hittite texts {{do not provide}} an independent account of the Trojan War. The Manapa-Tarhunda letter is about {{a member of the}} Hittite ruling family, Piyama-Radu, who gained control of the kingdom of Wilusa, and whose only serious opposition came from the <b>author</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> letter, Manapa-Tarhunda. King Muwatalli of the Hittites was the opponent of this king of Troy, and the result of Muwatalli's campaign is not recorded in {{the surviving}} texts. The Ahhiyawa, generally identified with the Achaean Greeks, are mentioned in the Tawagalawa letter as the neighbors of the kingdom of Wilusa, and who provided a refuge for the troublesome renegade Piyama-Radu. The Tawagalawa letter mentions that the Hittites and the Ahhiyawa fought a war over Wilusa.|$|E
25|$|Soon after {{becoming}} Chief Justice, Marshall changed {{the manner in}} which the Supreme Court announced its decisions. Previously, each Justice would author a separate opinion (known as a seriatim opinion) as was done in the Virginia Supreme Court of his day and is still done today in the United Kingdom and Australia. Under Marshall, however, the Supreme Court adopted the practice of handing down a single opinion of the Court, allowing it to present a clear rule. As Marshall was almost always the <b>author</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> opinion, he essentially became the Court's sole spokesman in important cases. Marshall also got rid of the tradition that U.S. Supreme Court justices had inherited from the British of wearing ornate powdered wigs and red robes with ermine trim.|$|E
25|$|It {{is hardly}} probable, however, {{that the present}} Book of Jubilees is incomplete, and a much more {{plausible}} view of Epstein's is that which regards the Midrash Tadshe {{as the work of}} Rabbi Moses ha-Darshan. Either on account of its beginning, or for some other reason, R. Phinehas ben Jair was regarded as the <b>author</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> midrash, and Num. R. xiii. 10 and xiv. 12, 18 contain several expositions and maxims from it cited under the name of that tanna. The midrash, from which Yalḳuṭ excerpted several passages and which has been cited by various authors, has been edited according to manuscript sources by Adolf Jellinek (B. H. iii. 164-193) and by A. Epstein (Beiträge zur Jüdischen Alterthumskunde, Vienna, 1887).|$|E

25|$|The {{history of}} Uqair is multi-faceted. The {{irrigation}} channels north of Uqair {{could be the}} abandoned city of Gerrha. And it is alternatively possible the lost city lay beneath the subkha near the ruined Islamic city of Uqair. But Bibby's efforts to dig the channels and beneath the walls of Uqair proved fruitless {{in the search for}} Gerrha. (Looking for Dilmun, Geoffrey Bibby, p. 372). It is the belief of the <b>author</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> article that the fort at Uqair is of Islamic origin and constructed by Arabs in defense and in anticipation of foreign attack, that eventually arrived in form of the Portuguese. Despite the lack of conclusively identifying its original builders, Uqair stands in quiet aura as a testimony to a mysterious and diverse cultural landscape that flourished in its proximity.|$|E
25|$|For the {{standard}} LH the 41-seat Plaxton coach and 43-seat ECW bus were most widely used; the bus bodies manufactured in Belfast by Alexander for Ulsterbus had 45 seats, East Midland Motor Services' ten 1969 buses {{were the only}} ones with Willowbrook bodies, as built they had 45 seats but with a 3+2 seating arrangement in three rows forward of the rear bench, making room for a pram pen, they were also unusual in carrying no grille badge, which puzzled the <b>author</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> sentence when he first came across a seemingly unidentifiable bus as a schoolboy in the mid 1970s. The LHS was produced as both buses and coaches with 26 to 35 seats. The LHL had up to 53 seats as a coach or 55 as a bus. Between 1975 and 1982 Vanplan built eight with delivery van bodies.|$|E
25|$|Kyriazis was {{a member}} of the National Council of Cyprus. As a member of the St Lazarus Committee he founded the Museum of St Lazarus church in Larnaca. One of his {{greatest}} achievements was the salvage and subsequent publication of many historical details concerning Cyprus through the ages. He started publishing articles on this subject from 1909, and over a period of 47 years he published several books and over 370 articles and studies. He participated in the publication of the monumental ‘Cyprus Chronicles’ (Kypriaka Chronica) a scientific/historical magazine (1923–1937) consisting of 4200 pages. These Chronicles were under the auspices of a four-member committee (the Bishop of Kition Nikodemos Mylonas, prof. Ioannis Sykoutris, Loukis Z Pieridis, and Neoklis Kyriazis), and covered every aspect of the history of Cyprus from the ancient times through to the Turkish and subsequently British occupation. Kyriazis was the only, or nearly only, <b>author</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> periodical from 1929–1937.|$|E
