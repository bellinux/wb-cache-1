5|$|A {{critical}} edition {{was published}} by Breitkopf, edited by Eva-Maria Hodel. Another {{was published by}} Carus in 2008, edited by Wolfram Enßlin, which <b>also</b> <b>provided</b> <b>a</b> singable English version.|$|E
5|$|A 2003 {{attempt by}} Christopher Brochu {{included}} Albertosaurus, Alectrosaurus, Alioramus, Daspletosaurus, Gorgosaurus, Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus in the definition. Holtz redefined the clade in 2004 {{to use all}} of the above as specifiers except for Alioramus and Alectrosaurus, which his analysis could not place with certainty. However, in the same paper, Holtz <b>also</b> <b>provided</b> <b>a</b> completely different definition, including all theropods more closely related to Tyrannosaurus than to Eotyrannus. The most recent definition is that of Sereno in 2005, which defined Tyrannosauridae as the least inclusive clade containing Albertosaurus, Gorgosaurus and Tyrannosaurus.|$|E

5|$|Observations of sunspots were {{recorded}} during the Han Dynasty (206 BC–AD 220) by Chinese astronomers, who maintained records of these observations for centuries. Averroes <b>also</b> <b>provided</b> <b>a</b> description of sunspots in the 12th century. The {{invention of the}} telescope in the early 17th century permitted detailed observations of sunspots by Thomas Harriot, Galileo Galilei and other astronomers. Galileo posited that sunspots were {{on the surface of}} the Sun rather than small objects passing between Earth and the Sun.|$|E
5|$|Pang's book of photographs, Instamatic Karma, was {{published}} in 2008. Besides the candid personal portraits, the book contains some historically important photographs, such as Lennon signing the official dissolution of The Beatles' partnership, and the last known photograph of Lennon and Paul McCartney together. Cynthia Lennon <b>also</b> <b>provided</b> <b>a</b> back cover endorsement, acknowledging Pang's role in reuniting Lennon with his estranged first son, Julian.|$|E

5|$|The Burnham on Sea Cricket {{club was}} {{established}} in 1861 and has played continuously since then. The Club currently plays in the Somerset Cricket League Premier Div.The ground is situated in Stoddens Road and boasts fine facilities. The best-known player in the club's history is Sammy Woods, who played Test cricket for England and Australia during the 1890s. The club has <b>also</b> <b>provided</b> <b>a</b> number of players for Somerset in the County Championship competition.|$|E
5|$|After Bara's {{contract}} with Fox ended, Woods approached her about appearing in a play. She had performed on stage {{early in her}} career, working with touring companies and in summer stock, but had not performed on Broadway. Bara told a reporter that she was offered a few scripts to consider, and chose The Blue Flame (at that time titled The Lost Soul) because it allowed her to play {{two versions of the}} character, one good and the other bad. She also hoped moving to the stage would bring her new career opportunities. Woods gave Bara a lucrative contract. Each week she received a salary of $1500. This was considerably less than the $4000 per week she had earned in her last year with Fox, but Bara was also promised half the production's net profits. For example, the play's two-week run in Boston netted Bara $10,700. Woods <b>also</b> <b>provided</b> <b>a</b> finely appointed private railroad car to take her from city to city when the show toured.|$|E
5|$|Although the Battle of Pelagonia has {{frequently}} {{been described as}} a decisive turning point, Michael VIII Palaiologos' gains were rapidly reversed and his rivals quickly regained their strength, with both the Epirotes and Manfred of Sicily reclaiming most of the territories they had lost. Nevertheless, the effects of the battle were not wholly undone: Palaiologos' victory, gained with the assistance of John Doukas, not only prevented the Epirote–Latin league of 1259 from taking Thessalonica and much of Nicaea's European domains, but <b>also</b> <b>provided</b> <b>a</b> valuable breathing space in the lead-up to the eventual recovery of Constantinople in 1261, which led to the re-establishment of the Byzantine Empire under the Palaiologan dynasty.|$|E

5|$|Amtrak's {{decision}} to discontinue the NP trains caused consternation in Montana. Mike Mansfield (D-Montana), then Senate Majority Leader, {{pointed out that}} the Empire Builder bypassed Montana's major population centers, and had no difficulty in making his displeasure felt. The new company reacted to the pressure and announced a resumption of service over the ex-Northern Pacific, to begin on June 14. This service took the form of an unnamed section of the Empire Builder running separately between Minneapolis and Spokane, Washington. Mansfield's intervention earned the train the nickname “Mike Mansfield Limited”. The Northern Pacific route, which included the Yellowstone River, Homestake Pass and Bitterroot Mountains, was praised for its scenery. Amtrak considered the route one of the company's six most beautiful. The train <b>also</b> <b>provided</b> <b>a</b> convenient connection to Yellowstone National Park at Livingston, Montana.|$|E
5|$|Apart from {{originating}} {{theories on}} the entrepreneur and spatial economics, Cantillon <b>also</b> <b>provided</b> <b>a</b> dedicated theory on population growth. Unlike William Petty, who believed there always existed {{a considerable amount}} of unused land and economic opportunity to support economic growth, Cantillon theorised that population grows only {{as long as there are}} economic opportunities present. Specifically, Cantillon cited three determining variables for population size: natural resources, technology, and culture. Therefore, populations grow only as far as the three aforementioned variables allowed. Furthermore, Cantillon's population theory was more modern than that of Malthus in the sense that Cantillon recognised a much broader category of factors which affect population growth, including the tendency for population growth to fall to zero as a society becomes more industrialised.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1946, the Montreal Laboratory was {{estimated}} to have cost US$22,232,000, excluding {{the cost of the}} heavy water. The NRX reactor provided Britain, the United States and Canada with a source of fissile plutonium and uranium-233. It <b>also</b> <b>provided</b> <b>a</b> means of efficiently producing medical isotopes like phosphorus-32, research facilities that for a time were superior to those in the United States, and a wealth of technical information related to reactor design and operation. With the passage of the Canadian Atomic Energy Act of 1946, the responsibility for the Chalk River Laboratories passed to the Atomic Energy Control Board.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to these preventable issues, GWA studies have attracted more fundamental criticism, mainly because of their assumption that common genetic variation plays {{a large role in}} explaining the heritable variation of common disease. This aspect of GWA studies has attracted the criticism that, although it could not have been known prospectively, GWA studies were ultimately not worth the expenditure. Alternative strategies suggested involve linkage analysis. More recently, the rapidly decreasing price of complete genome sequencing have <b>also</b> <b>provided</b> <b>a</b> realistic alternative to genotyping array-based GWA studies. It can be discussed if the use of this new technique is still referred to as a GWA study, but high-throughput sequencing does have potential to side-step some of the shortcomings of non-sequencing GWA.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries, a {{significant}} number of lynchings occurred in the Southern United States, primarily of African Americans in the states of Georgia, Mississippi, and Texas. Between 1890 and 1920, about 3,000 African Americans were killed by lynch mobs, usually after whites were the victims of crimes purportedly committed by blacks. Supporters of lynching justified the practice as a way to assert dominance over African Americans, to whom they attributed a criminal nature. Lynching <b>also</b> <b>provided</b> <b>a</b> sense of white solidarity in a culture with changing demographics and power structures. Although lynching was tolerated by much of southern society, opponents of the practice emerged, including some religious leaders and the nascent National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1980s, Valiente {{began writing}} an {{autobiography}} {{in which she}} focused on her own place within Wiccan history. It would be published by Hale in 1989 as The Rebirth of Witchcraft. In this work she did not dismiss the Murrayite witch-cult theory, but she did undermine the belief that Wicca was the survival of it by highlighting the various false claims made by Gardner, Cochrane, and Sanders, instead emphasising what she perceived as the religion's value for the modern era. She <b>also</b> <b>provided</b> <b>a</b> foreword for Witchcraft: A Tradition Renewed, a book published in 1990 by Hale. It had been written by Evan John Jones, {{a former member of}} the Clan of Tubal Cain who also lived in Brighton. Heselton has expressed the view that Valiente likely did more than this, and that she wrote a number of the chapters herself.|$|E

5|$|Lyon later {{apologized to}} the House as a whole, {{claiming}} he had not known it was in session when he confronted Griswold, and meant no breach of decorum or disrespect to the body; he <b>also</b> <b>provided</b> <b>a</b> written letter of apology. Not satisfied with the apology, on February 15, 1798, Griswold retaliated by attacking Lyon with a wooden cane, beating him about the head and shoulders in view of other representatives on the House floor. Lyon retreated to a fire pit and defended himself with the tongs until other Congressmen broke up the fight, with several pulling Griswold by his legs {{to get him to}} let go of Lyon. Although the committee appointed to investigate recommended censure of both Lyon and Griswold, the House as a whole rejected the motion. The issue was resolved when both Lyon and Griswold promised the House that they would keep the peace and remain on good behavior.|$|E
5|$|Newspapers {{reported}} that Myers had {{a monopoly on}} the making of hydrogen gas balloons and was the only producer in the United States of these balloons for the government. A loft in the Myers house was made available for a sewing area of balloon materials to make the large balloons. The fabric material was patterned, sewed together into large strips, and made ready for varnishing. He had a patent of a fabric made from sea island cotton that {{was used for the}} varnish application. Myers' patented varnish formula made the fabric impervious to hydrogen. The varnish used to seal the fabric material for the balloon envelopes was prepared in a low pit outdoors in a ravine behind the house. This was below ground level so the fabric being prepared was sheltered from the wind. It <b>also</b> <b>provided</b> <b>a</b> fire-pit in case the flammable material caught on fire. There was a water-hose handy for putting out a fire.|$|E
5|$|On 6 October, Pastor Maldonado and {{the manager}} and {{assistant}} manager he shared with Bianchi—namely, Nicolas Todt and Alessandro Alunni Bravi, respectively—also visited the hospital. Bianchi's parents arrived later that day and were joined, three days later, by their other children, Mélanie and Tom, as well as Jules' best friend, Lorenz Leclerc. The family released a statement the next day, expressing appreciation for the outpouring {{of support from the}} public and for the presence of professor Gerard Saillant, president of the FIA Medical Commission, and professor Alessandro Frati, neurosurgeon of the Sapienza University of Rome, who travelled to Japan at the request of Scuderia Ferrari. They <b>also</b> <b>provided</b> <b>a</b> medical update, confirming that the injury suffered was a diffuse axonal injury and that Bianchi was in a critical but stable condition.|$|E
