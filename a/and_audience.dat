5|$|As with {{cultural}} studies, media {{study is a}} distinct discipline that owes to the convergence of sociology and other social sciences and humanities, in particular, literary criticism and critical theory. Though the production process or the critique of aesthetic forms {{is not in the}} remit of sociologists, analyses of socializing factors, such as ideological effects <b>and</b> <b>audience</b> reception, stem from sociological theory and method. Thus the 'sociology of the media' is not a subdiscipline per se, but the media is a common and often-indispensable topic.|$|E
5|$|It did {{not seem}} to Dietz as if there was any {{relationship}} between critical praise <b>and</b> <b>audience</b> enthusiasm for January films. The best-rated, Disney's 2004 animated musical Teacher's Pet, was a commercial failure, as was 2001's The Pledge. Cloverfield, the third entry, was a success, and behind it Freedom Writers had ridden its good reviews to do some modest box office in 2007; however How She Move had flopped that same year.|$|E

5|$|Other {{influences}} {{included the}} composer Niccolò Jommelli and his maître de ballet at Stuttgart, Jean-Georges Noverre. Noverre's Lettres sur la danse (1760) called for dramatic effect over acrobatic ostentation; Noverre was himself {{influenced by the}} operas of Rameau and the acting style of David Garrick. The considerable quantity of ballet in Orfeo ed Euridice {{is thought to be}} due to his influence.

5|$|The {{origin of}} modern botanical gardens is {{generally}} {{traced to the}} appointment of professors of botany to the medical faculties of universities in 16th century Renaissance Italy, which also entailed the curation of a medicinal garden. However, the objectives, content, <b>and</b> <b>audience</b> of today’s botanic gardens more closely resembles that of the grandiose gardens of antiquity and the educational garden of Theophrastus in the Lyceum of ancient Athens.|$|E
5|$|In January 2010, Metacritic editor Jason Dietz {{undertook}} a {{statistical analysis of}} whether films released in that month were, as perceived, inferior.

January averaged the fewest releases of the three, and the lowest average scores. Of the 88 films released {{in the first month}} of the year during that decade, only six earned above a 61 average on the site's scale of 0 to 100, the lowest of any of the three winter months, even accounting for the increase in releases as the spring becomes closer.|$|E

5|$|The play first premiered at The Chestnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia on April 6, 1808.

However, other sources suggest it was a benefit for a Mrs. Woodham. In any case, {{it is clear that the}} performance was interrupted by an offstage commotion which may have cut the performance short. Mr. Webster, a tenor who played the role of Larry, was an object of public scorn at the time because of his effeminate manner and dress, <b>and</b> <b>audience</b> members rioted in outrage at his participation, causing Barker himself to order the curtain to be dropped. The play was subsequently performed again in Philadelphia on February 1, 1809, although it was advertised for January 25.|$|E
