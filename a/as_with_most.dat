5|$|<b>As</b> <b>with</b> <b>most</b> breeds of dog, the Russian Toy {{can suffer}} from patellar luxation, {{which is where}} the knee cap slips out of place when the knee bends as the groove that {{normally}} holds it in place is too shallow. It is usually an inherited defect, which occurs during the development of the foetus and rarely by trauma.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>with</b> <b>most</b> fungi, little {{information}} {{is available on the}} threat of extinction for Russulaceae species, and they have not been assessed in the International Union for the Conservation of Nature's Red List. However, national lists contain some species of Lactarius, Lactifluus and Russula, indicating that they have small populations and are endangered, e.g. in Great Britain, Switzerland, the Czech Republic, and New Zealand.|$|E

5|$|Some reviewers {{praised the}} scenery and overall {{production}} quality, considering the film {{an improvement over}} staged adaptations of the novel. Others found the scenery irrelevant and the story confusing. Despite mixed reviews, the film was financially successful, reportedly setting box office records.

5|$|About 19 {{isotopes}} and 8 {{nuclear isomers}} {{are known for}} americium. There are two long-lived alpha-emitters, 241Am and 243Am with half-lives of 432.2 and 7,370years, respectively, and the nuclear isomer 242m1Am has a long half-life of 141years. The half-lives of other isotopes and isomers range from 0.64microseconds for 245m1Am to 50.8hours for 240Am. <b>As</b> <b>with</b> <b>most</b> other actinides, the isotopes of americium with odd number of neutrons have relatively high rate of nuclear fission and low critical mass.|$|E
5|$|Actinium reacts rapidly {{with oxygen}} and {{moisture}} in air forming a white coating of actinium oxide that impedes further oxidation. <b>As</b> <b>with</b> <b>most</b> lanthanides and actinides, actinium {{exists in the}} oxidation state +3, and the Ac3+ ions are colorless in solutions. The oxidation state +3 originates from the 6d17s2 electronic configuration of actinium, with three valence electrons that are easily donated to give the stable closed-shell structure of the noble gas radon. The rare oxidation state +2 is only known for actinium dihydride (AcH2); even this may in reality be an electride compound like its lighter congener LaH2.|$|E

Four years later, Sherman was a delegate to the Whig National Convention where the eventual winner Zachary Taylor was nominated. <b>As</b> <b>with</b> <b>most</b> conservative Whigs, Sherman supported the Compromise of 1850 as the best solution to the growing sectional divide. In 1852, Sherman was again a delegate to the Whig National Convention, where he supported the eventual nominee, Winfield Scott, against rivals Daniel Webster and incumbent Millard Fillmore, who had become president following Taylor's death.|$|E

5|$|<b>As</b> <b>with</b> <b>most</b> bats, {{the little}} brown bat is mostly active {{at night and}} leaves its roost at dusk and {{the next two or}} three hours are peak {{activity}} periods. They are also active before dawn. Since little brown bats live in a temperate zone, they must find some way of dealing with winter. Most temperate bats either migrate or hibernate, but little brown bats do both. In summer, the males and females live apart, the females raise the young. When fall comes, both sexes fly south to a hibernaculum, where they mate and then hibernate. Little brown bats undergo a prolonged period of hibernation during the winter due to the lack of food. They hibernate in caves as a community.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>with</b> <b>most</b> of the Great White Fleet ships, Kentucky was modernized on her return. She was {{decommissioned}} at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard on 28 August 1909, and her modernization {{was completed}} in 1911, {{at a cost of}} $675,000. The ship received cage masts, new water-tube boilers, and another four 5-inch guns. The 1-pounder guns were removed, as were sixteen of the 6-pounders. On 4 June 1912, she was recommissioned in the Second Reserve, and on 31 May 1913 she was transferred to the Atlantic Reserve Fleet in Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>with</b> <b>most</b> of {{the other}} GNP stations, the station {{building}} was designed by Leslie Green, though at Holborn the station frontage was, uniquely, constructed in stone rather than the standard red glazed terracotta. This was due to planning regulations imposed by the London County Council which required the use of stone for façades in Kingsway. The station entrance and exit sections of the street façade were constructed in granite with {{the other parts of}} the ground and first floors in the same style, but using Portland stone. The rest of the building above first floor level was constructed contemporaneously with the station. Access to the platform levels of the station was provided by trapezium-shaped electric lifts manufactured by Otis in America. These operated in pairs in shared circular shafts, with an escape stair in a separate, smaller shaft.|$|E

Despite the political failure they remained the basis of international law. After World War II the legal principles were incorporated in the UN Charter and a host of international human rights treaties.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>with</b> <b>most</b> other volcanoes in the Cascade Range, Mount St.Helens {{is a large}} eruptive cone {{consisting}} of lava rock interlayered with ash, pumice, and other deposits. The mountain includes layers of basalt and andesite through which several domes of dacite lava have erupted. The largest of the dacite domes formed the previous summit, and off its northern flank sat the smaller Goat Rocks dome. Both were destroyed in the 1980 eruption.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>with</b> <b>most</b> small birds, {{mortality}} {{in the first}} year of life is high, but adults aged three to four years are regularly recorded, and the record is more than seven years. Eggs, chicks and fledglings of this ground-nesting species are taken by stoats, weasels and crows such as the European magpie, and the adults are hunted by birds of prey, particularly the sparrowhawk. Small birds are also at the mercy of the weather, particularly when migrating, but also on the breeding and wintering grounds.|$|E
