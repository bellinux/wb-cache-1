500|$|When, in September 1943, Joseph Goebbels was {{informed}} that the German army had {{to withdraw from the}} Katyn area, he wrote a prediction in his diary. His entry for 29 September 1943 reads: [...] "Unfortunately we have had to give up Katyn. The Bolsheviks undoubtedly will soon 'find' that we shot 12,000 Polish officers. That episode is one that is going to cause us quite <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>trouble</b> in the future. The Soviets are undoubtedly going to make it their business to discover as many mass graves as possible and then blame it on us".|$|E
500|$|Forty-four {{seconds after}} Moosally's order, Lieutenant Buch {{reported}} that Turret Two's right gun was loaded {{and ready to}} fire. Seventeen seconds later, he reported that the left gun was ready. A few seconds later, Errick Lawrence, in Turret Two's center gun room, reported to Ziegler over the turret's phone circuit that, [...] "We have a problem here. We are not ready yet. We have a problem here." [...] Ziegler responded by announcing over the turret's phone circuit, [...] "Left gun loaded, good job. Center gun is having <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>trouble.</b> We'll straighten that out." [...] Mortensen, monitoring Turret Two's phone circuit from his position in Turret One, heard Buch confirm that {{the left and right}} guns were loaded. Lawrence then called out, [...] "I'm not ready yet! I'm not ready yet!" [...] Next, Ernie Hanyecz, Turret Two's leading petty officer suddenly called out, [...] "Mort! Mort! Mort!" [...] Ziegler shouted, [...] "Oh, my God! The powder is smoldering!" [...] At this time, Ziegler may have opened the door from the turret officer's booth {{in the rear of the}} turret into the center gun room and yelled at the crew to get the breech closed. About this same time, Hanyecz yelled over the phone circuit, [...] "Oh, my God! There's a flash!" ...|$|E

500|$|Madness {{frequently}} discovers itself {{merely by}} unnecessary {{deviation from the}} usual mode of the world. My poor friend Smart shewed the disturbance of his mind, by falling upon his knees, and saying his prayers in the street, {{or in any other}} unusual place. Now although, rationally speaking, it is greater madness not to pray at all, than to pray as Smart did, I am afraid there are so many who do not pray, that their understanding is not called in question.Concerning this unfortunate poet, Christopher Smart, who was confined in a mad-house, he had, at another time, the following conversation with Dr [...] Burney:– Burney. 'How does poor Smart do, Sir; is he likely to recover?' Johnson. 'It seems as if his mind had ceased to struggle with the disease; for he grows fat upon it.' Burney. 'Perhaps, Sir, that may be from want of exercise.' Johnson. 'No, Sir; he has partly as much exercise as he used to have, for he digs in the garden. Indeed, before his confinement, he used for exercise to walk to the ale-house; but he was carried back again. I did not think he ought to be shut up. His infirmities are not noxious to society. He insisted on people praying with him; and I'd as lief pray with Kit [...] Smart as any one else. Another charge was that he did not love clean linen; and I have no passion for it.'– Johnson continued. 'Mankind have a great aversion to intellectual labour; but even supposing knowledge to be easily attainable, more people would be content to be ignorant than would take even <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>trouble</b> to acquire it.' ...|$|E

2500|$|Double Indemnitys first {{theatrical}} engagement {{was at the}} Keith's in Baltimore, on July 3, 1944. The film {{then opened}} nationwide on July 6, 1944, and was an immediate hit with audiences – despite a campaign by singer Kate Smith imploring the public to stay away on moral grounds. As James M. Cain recalled, [...] "there was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>trouble</b> caused by this fat girl, Kate Smith, who carried on a propaganda asking people {{to stay away from}} the picture. Her advertisement probably put a million dollars on its gross." ...|$|E
2500|$|Vaughn had <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>trouble</b> {{adapting}} to film: the film had no studio. The big studios doubted {{the success of}} an adaptation as a violent superhero, which made the film be independently financed, but this gave him the freedom to make the film the way he imagined, without {{having to worry about}} high-censorship. Vaughn believed enough in the project to raise the money himself. Christopher Mintz-Plasse (Red Mist) said that the creators of the film were wondering whether a distributor would pick up the movie. On the set Vaughn jokingly referred to Kick-Ass as something {{that was going to be}} [...] "the most expensive home movie I ever made".|$|E

[...] Peter Kirsten was another Gough victim, caught behind by Steven Rhodes, and although Jonty Rhodes put on 75 with his skipper, both fell {{just before the}} close, leaving the honours relatively even at 244/6.

2500|$|William {{appears in}} Scottish {{records for the}} first time in the 1180s, {{appearing}} as a royal clerk. In 1193, the royal patronage he had earned brought him his first known ecclesiastical post, as Archdeacon of Lothian. He was made the king's Chancellor probably on 8 September 1199, and was elected to the Bishopric of Glasgow in October the same year. He was consecrated at Lyon by Reginald de Forez, Archbishop of Lyon, in September 1200. [...] However, two years later in the same month, he was translated to the higher ranking Bishopric of St. Andrews. William got into <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>trouble</b> for exercising his episcopal powers before his episcopate had been confirmed by the Pope, then Innocent III; a charge was brought against him by one of his canons, a man named Eustace. The charge was heard by the Papal legate, John of Salerno, who held a council at Perth in December 1201, before leaving for business in Ireland. Legate John once again visited Scotland on his way back from Ireland, staying for more than fifty days at Melrose. However, nothing came of the charge.|$|E
