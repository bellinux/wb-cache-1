When private non-financial firms borrow in foreign currency, they face currency mismatch in their balance sheets. Statistical analyses of <b>aggregated</b> <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> data of non-financial sector revealed that the negative gap between firms’ dollarized assets and liabilities has been increasing considerably in Turkey. This creates financial exposure by private non-financial sector.

The main findings are twofold. First, {{in each of the four}} countries a change in the user cost of capital, which in turn is affected by interest rates, has both statistically and economically significant effects on investment.

40|$|In a {{world with}} {{imperfect}} competition, market externalities or asymmetric information, the impact of money and monetary policy on the real sector depends on the way money is created. Two conflicting views of money supply can be distinguished in the literature: the endogeneity view and the exogeneity view. In this paper, both views are discussed and compared from a theoretical and from an empirical point of view. An industrial organization model of the money-creating sector with endogenous money is presented and compared to the money multiplier approach. The concept of a heterogeneous oligopoly is used to model the credit market and the deposits market. Using the <b>aggregated</b> <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> of the banking sector, endogenous money is explained by its counterparts, especially loans. The monetary base is determined endogenously, too, and a money multiplier equivalent expression can be derived. A cointegrated vector autoregressive model {{for the development of}} the nominal money stock in Germany in the period of monetary targeting from 1975 to 1998 is estimated. The implications of the theoretical model are compared to the properties of the estimated VAR.

40|$|In this paper, I {{examine the}} {{exchange}} rate exposure of Hungarian enterprises from a financial stability perspective. In connection with the recent growth in FX loans to enterprises, the central bank assesses {{the vulnerability of the}} banks' loan portfolio to changes in {{the exchange rate}}. To collect company-level data, two surveys were carried out on exchange rate exposure and exchange rate risk management practices. The first survey carried out in 2005 showed that the majority of small and medium-sized enterprises are exposed to exchange rate depreciation, but that exchange rate risk management techniques are almost unknown to them. In the 2007 survey, which is summarized here, large enterprises were also examined, as well as motives for borrowing in foreign currency and the lack of FX risk management tools. Based on the results, the main motive for raising FX debt is lower interest rates, while at large enterprises natural hedging also appears as a factor. The main reason for ignoring FX risks is that FX risk management tools are thought to be expensive, complicated or ineffective. The majority of enterprises think there are no suitable tools to manage FX risks or they expect external solutions, such as the introduction of the euro to decrease their risks. Based on calculations on <b>aggregated</b> <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> data, exchange rate depreciations would improve the profitability of the corporate sector as well as its capability to repay the debts. However, micro-level calculations suggest that exchange rate depreciations increase the ratio of loss-making enterprises to a larger degree than exchange rate appreciations. These calcuations do not take competitiveness and other long-term effects of exchange rate changes into consideration, thus, the results have to be treated with caution...|$|E
40|$|Management of {{agricultural}} soils may determine soil carbon emission {{to the atmosphere}} (source) or soil carbon sequestration (sink). Conventional agriculture is tillage-based (TA) in industrialised as well as developing countries and relies, as a key procedure for seedbed preparation, on mechanical soil tillage with no organic mulch cover. Generally, it seems {{to speed up the}} loss of Soil Organic Matter (SOM), by increasing its mineralization and through soil loss by erosion. In addition, soil tillage is a high energy-consuming operation that uses large amounts of fossil fuel per hectare in mechanised systems. In contrast to tillage-based systems, Conservation Agriculture (CA) is considered to be an agro-ecological approach to resource-conserving agricultural production that requires compliance with three linked practical principles, namely: i) minimum mechanical soil disturbance (with no-till and direct seeding); ii) maintenance of permanent organic soil cover (with crops, cover crops and/or crop residues); and iii) species diversification through crop rotations and associations (involving annual and/or perennial crops including tree and pasture crops) Corsi et al. (2012). CA facilitates good agronomy, such as timely operations, and improves overall land husbandry for rained and irrigated production and is complemented by other good practices, {{such as the use of}} quality seeds and integrated pest management (Pisante et al., 2012). There is evidence that, in the medium term, the most effective way for adaptation to climate change is represented by a rational management of the biosphere and in particular of the agricultural sector: by the adoption of specific agricultural practices. Agriculture is potentially able to reduce its emission with minor costs with respect to other activities, to increase carbon sequestration and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In fact, agricultural activities play a fundamental role in soil carbon sequestration and reduction of emissions, mainly because of the high stock capacity of this element associated with long retention time in the soil. The cultivated land (arable and tree crops) occupy 28 % of the Italian territory, for a total of 10. 9 million ha which can stock massive reserves of carbon by putting in place agronomic measures and/or agro-ecological infrastructure useful to reduce the amount of CO 2 in the atmosphere. The net balance of the two processes on an annual basis can result in positive net flows (emissions) or negative (sequestration). However, the <b>aggregated</b> <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> of carbon for agricultural soils is subject to significant uncertainties with estimates that can vary greatly depending on the method and data sources. The average European values, for example, range from losses of - 0. 17 ± 0. 33 Mg C ha- 1 y- 1 (emissions), when calculated from data in the inventory {{of agricultural}} soils (available for 33 % of the European cultivated land) to values of accumulation of 0. 15 ± 0. 15, or loss of - 0. 08 Mg C ha- 1 y- 1 when calculated with simulation models. It is estimated that in Italy over the past 70 years, the intensification of agricultural activities has caused a net loss of soil organic carbon by 39 % compared to the initial content. The extent of actual SOC sequestration achieved on Italian cultivated land will crucially depend on future policies which could contemplate the inclusion of agriculture in an emissions trading scheme, either as a covered sector, or as an offset provider. It is important to face some research questions mainly aimed at removing this barrier to inclusion of soil carbon in emissions trading. Complementary measures, such as research, development and technology transfer to improve the extension to improve adoption of existing techniques or direct financing to accelerate the adoption of conservation farming systems, should be carried out...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{demonstrate}} how Japanese bank “performance” has improved markedly since fiscal 2003 but to caution against over-optimism. Design/methodology/approach – The methodological approach adopted involves using <b>aggregate</b> <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> data dating from around 1990 to identify the trends in industry performance with respect to profitability, asset quality and capital adequacy. Findings – The bursting of the asset price bubble in the early 1990 s clearly had a major adverse impact on “performance”, as measured by the above-mentioned indicators, but, after fiscal 1992, the industry's fortunes began to improve. Problems on each front, however, remain to be resolved. Practical implications – By identifying the main problems still besetting the Japanese banks, both the industry and their supervisors are given advice as to which areas they need to focus on to improve future bank performance. Originality/value – The paper clearly explains the nature of, and reasons for, the recent improvement in Japanese bank performance whilst highlighting the areas on which they still have to focus if they are to regain their former glory within the international banking community. It should be of interest to all serious scholars of the Japanese banking system and interested commentators alike.

Using three different datasets, <b>aggregate</b> <b>balance</b> <b>sheets,</b> <b>aggregate</b> flows of funds {{and a large}} panel of individual firms followed up during 10 years, {{we are able to}} give some empirical evidence for the importance of institutional features in the choice of corporate financing decisions. At the aggregate level, large firms are generally more highly levered; however, in the past ten years we observe a clear reduction in bank debt and a sharp increase in financial assets. Small firms on the other hand are less highly levered but have shifted toward greater long-term debt in recent years. Using flows of funds, we find that small firms have corporate financing decisions that remain roughly constant through time with a clear dominance of self-finance. In contrast we note for large firms an increased reliance on external sources of finance. Possible explanations of these patterns are investigated in our econometric study of panel data. We find that Belgian firms rely primarily on internal funds which seems to confirm the ''pecking order'' story of Myers and Majluf (1984). We also find that the emergence of coordination centers in the late 1980 's explain much of the changing financial structure of large Belgian firms. These structures allow a higher leverage while they reduce the proportion of bank finance. Finally, control considerations are shown to explain the high level of financial assets on large firms' <b>balance</b> <b>sheets.</b> Capital structure; Belgium...|$|R
40|$|Reconstructing {{patterns}} of interconnections from partial information {{is one of}} the most important issues in the statistical physics of complex networks. A paramount example is provided by financial networks. In fact, the spreading and amplification of financial distress in capital markets is strongly affected by the interconnections among financial institutions. Yet, while the <b>aggregate</b> <b>balance</b> <b>sheets</b> of institutions are publicly disclosed, information on single positions is mostly confidential and, as such, unavailable. Standard approaches to reconstruct the network of financial interconnection produce unrealistically dense topologies, leading to a biased estimation of systemic risk. Moreover, reconstruction techniques are generally designed for monopartite networks of bilateral exposures between financial institutions, thus failing in reproducing bipartite networks of security holdings (, investment portfolios). Here we propose a reconstruction method based on constrained entropy maximization, tailored for bipartite financial networks. Such a procedure enhances the traditional capital-asset pricing model (CAPM) and allows to reproduce the correct topology of the network. We test this ECAPM method on a dataset, collected by the European Central Bank, of detailed security holdings of European institutional sectors over a period of six years (2009 - 2015). Our approach outperforms the traditional CAPM and the recently proposed MECAPM both in reproducing the network topology and in estimating systemic risk due to fire-sales spillovers. In general, ECAPM can be applied to the whole class of weighted bipartite networks described by the fitness model...|$|R

Abstract: This study {{uses the}} <b>aggregate</b> <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> and income {{statement}} of South African banks {{to implement a}} risk aggregation model that aggregates credit, market and operational risks {{with the aim of}} generating total risk estimates using both Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) as risk measures. The results are thereafter used to determine the supplemental Pillar II economic capital required {{in order to maintain the}} capital adequacy of the South African banking industry. We first model the return distributions due to credit and market risk using a multivariate risk factors sensitivity model, with the macroeconomic risk factors’ dynamics modelled through an asymmetric GARCH (generalize Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) model designed by Baba, Engle, Kraft and Krona (1990) (i. e. BEKK). Operational risk losses are assumed to follow a lognormal distribution. The Gaussian copula and t-copulas are then used to aggregate the three loss distributions (i. e. credit, market and operational risk distributions). The total risk given by copulas is compared to the total risk calculated through the less complex simple additive and variance-covariance methods. Our results suggest that the South African banking sector’s Pillar I regulatory capital as at end of December 2015 should be supplemented by an amount of approximately 52 billion ZAR when using as a benchmark the Gaussian copula risk aggregation model measured through the ES metric at 99. 9 % confidence level.

40|$|In 2001, Statistics New Zealand {{conducted}} a major {{survey of the}} assets and liabilities of New Zealanders called the Household Savings Survey (HSS). This paper {{presents the results of}} an analysis of ownership and investment in housing {{based on the results of}} that survey. International comparisons suggest that the rates of home ownership, investment in property and housing debt levels in New Zealand are broadly comparable with those in Australia and the United States and with a wider set of countries. An exception is that younger age groups in New Zealand hold more investment property than their counterparts in the USA and Australia. In New Zealand almost one in ten couples owned rental property in 2001, while one in five owned some form of investment property. We examine the factors that govern tenure choice and gearing. Of note is the fact that 44 % of couples and 56 % of individual home owners have debt free residential properties. Households' <b>balance</b> <b>sheets</b> reflect the importance of housing for both assets and liabilities. We complement the analysis of the cross-sectional unit record data from the HSS with an analysis of housing taken from the households' <b>aggregate</b> <b>balance</b> <b>sheets</b> from 1978 to 2004 from the Reserve Bank of New Zealand. We use these data to form a measure of household saving based on the stock of net equity. We then adjust this measure of savings for changes in house prices, and find that this adjustment explains almost two thirds of the difference between the stock and flow measure of household savings, the latter taken from the Household Income and Outlay Accounts. Furthermore we find that from 1980 to 2005 the annual average rate of household saving based on these estimates from household <b>balance</b> <b>sheets</b> was 12. 4 % of personal disposable income, after removing the effect of changes in house price. Arguably this is a preferable measure of household saving to the widely cited negative rates of household saving based on national income accounts.

40|$|The paper {{contrasts}} {{the pattern}} of returns to human capital in different economic sectors. As job mobility, especially across sectors, is limited, {{it is argued that}} coefficients of experience in earnings regressions may capture or be interpreted as the growth rate – net of depreciation – of earnings ability propitiated by schooling when years of education are also included in the right hand-side of the equation. As a consequence, under long-term contracts, labor market equilibrium is compatible with different “gross” rates of return to schooling, provided initial earnings levels allow for the same accumulated present value. That implies a special relation between the intercept and experience coefficient of earnings regressions performed for different sectors. Additionally, implications of (log-stable) nonstationary environments for rate of return inference from log-earnings regressions – appropriate for pooled (or panel) estimation and nominal earnings information - are also investigated. Then, the trend coefficient measures the (steady-state) nominal productivity growth; the experience coefficients approximate individuals’ earnings profiles growth rates net of the human capital depreciation rate; schooling’s, the nominal rate of return in the economy net of the nominal productivity growth rate. Tests of the hypothesises are provided, along with the inspection of the determinants – including financial ratios and productive organization indicators, calculated from <b>aggregate</b> <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> information - of the observed differences across industries. A study of the estimated variances of rate of return estimates was also conducted, as an attempt to capture features of financial risk in human capital investment.

40|$|We {{examine a}} novel, but {{economically}} important, characterization of trade credit relationships in which large investment-grade buyers borrow from their smaller suppliers. Using a matched sample of large retail buyers and their much smaller suppliers, {{we find that}} slower payment terms by large retailers are associated with lower investment at the supplier level. The effects are sharpest during periods of tight bank credit and for firms which we might otherwise characterize as financially constrained. The opportunity cost of extending credit to large buyers appears to be positive and sharply increasing in the financial frictions facing a firm. (JEL G 20, G 30, G 31, G 32) As of 2009, trade payables—financing {{for the purchase of}} goods extended by suppliers to their customers—represented the second largest liability on the <b>aggregate</b> <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> of nonfinancial businesses in the United States (U. S. Flow of Funds Account 2011). Yet relative to its volume as a source of corporate funding, there has been limited research on the effects of trade credit relationships on other financial and real activities of the firm. Why is so much financing in a well-developed capital market done by nonfinancial firms? The existing literature on trade credit suggests that financial constraint may play an important role, with evidence that small, young firms lean on their larger suppliers for funding when access to traditional financial markets is limited (Meltzer’s 1960; Schwartz 1974; Petersen and Rajan 1997). Yet at the same time, we also observe the inverse relationship, one which is harder to reconcile with a story based on financial constraint. Large, highly rated borrowers with unfettered access to capital markets may also borrow via trade credit, often from smaller, weaker suppliers. Walmart, for example, borrows more from its considerably smaller suppliers via trade credit than it does in bank and bon...|$|R
