Though described by contemporaries as fearfully {{devoted to the}} Queen, {{to the point that}} she did not have <b>a</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> her own, she actively campaigned for women's rights, a field the Queen abhorred. Nevertheless, both she and Beatrice remained closest to the Queen, and Helena remained close to her mother's side until the latter's death. Her name was the last to be written in the Queen's seventy-year-old journal.|$|E
5|$|The AWS has <b>a</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> its own {{at times}} and reaches peak {{performance}} with the owner who is dedicated to teaching the dog just {{what is expected of}} it. The breed takes well to training, and especially excels at training that offers some variety rather than routine training drills. However, members of the breed can may have issues with food possessiveness. They can be stubborn, and mentally are slow to mature from puppyhood. Some lines of the breed still retain dominant and aggressive temperaments; other than these lines, the AWS gets on well with children and enjoys playing with them. Even though they were originally bred to hunt, due to their size, they are suitable for apartment living as long as they receive enough exercise.|$|E

At one point it enters his classroom, causing an uproar from his classmates. The noise alerts the principal, who becomes angry with him and locks him up in his office until school is over.

It becomes the donkey that takes Joseph, Mary and Jesus into Egypt, once knowing by instinct when Herod's soldiers are near and hiding them.|$|E

500|$|Principal {{photography}} for Deep Blue Sea {{began on}} August 3, 1998. Most {{of the film}} was shot at Fox Baja Studios in Rosarito, Mexico, where the production team constructed sets above the large water tanks that had been built for James Cameron's 1997 film Titanic. Some of the sets were designed {{so that they could}} be submerged, while others were built on sound stages with fishtanks used as windows. At Fox Baja Studios, the cast worked with sharks that were either animatronic or computer generated. As the shark used in Jaws was 25 feet long, Harlin decided to increase their animatronic shark to 26 feet. Jackson recalled, [...] "When they first brought it into the lab we were all in awe of the size of this machine [...] It was a real monster. I would walk up to it slowly and touch it and they said it felt like a real shark. The gills moved and it had <b>a</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> its own sometimes." [...] As an added homage to Jaws, the license plate pulled from the shark's teeth by Carter is the same plate found in the tiger shark carcass from Spielberg's film.|$|E

500|$|Marceline the Vampire Queen (voiced by Olivia Olson) {{approaches}} Princess Bubblegum (voiced by Hynden Walch) {{and asks}} her to cure {{her of her}} vampirism, as she no longer wants to be immortal. Bubblegum agrees to perform an experimental procedure which extracts the vampiric essence from Marceline's body, but is unsure of whether it has worked or not. As Marceline recovers, the extracted essence gains <b>a</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> its own and escapes. Meanwhile, Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada) and Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio) are called out to investigate livestock being attacked by a bloodsucking creature. Suspecting Marceline, Finn and Jake confront of her, only to discover the extracted essence has transformed into the vampire attacking the livestock. However, as Finn and Jake chase the vampire, a mob of angry villagers capture Marceline and leave her to be destroyed by the rising sun. As the light engulfs her body, Marceline begins reliving memories of her past. As a child, she's comforted by a lullaby sung by her mother (voiced by Rebecca Sugar), entitled [...] "Everything Stays." [...] She witnesses Simon leaving her {{to protect her from}} himself. As a teenager, she hunts vampires and discovers she can absorb their powers. Later she befriends a tribe of Hyoomans, who are constructing a boat to escape the continent and avoid an impending catastrophe they fear will happen. Marceline helps fight off more vampires, and tells the Hyoomans to flee when the Vampire King arrives. Back in the present, everybody is shocked when they see that the sunlight doesn't kill Marceline, meaning that she has been cured of her vampirism. Meanwhile, Jake encounters the vampires Marceline had previously killed, now resurrected from Marceline's freed vampiric essence.|$|E
500|$|No {{artist was}} ever more true to his aim. Ideals resolutely pursued {{are apt to}} provoke the resentment of the world, and Burne-Jones encountered, endured and conquered an {{extraordinary}} amount of angry criticism. Insofar as this was directed against the lack of realism in his pictures, it was beside the point. The earth, the sky, the rocks, the trees, {{the men and women of}} Burne-Jones are not those of this world; but they are themselves a world, consistent with itself, and having therefore its own reality. Charged with the beauty and with the strangeness of dreams, it has nothing of a dream's incoherence. Yet it is a dreamer always whose nature penetrates these works, a nature out of sympathy with struggle and strenuous action. Burne-Jones's men and women are dreamers too. It was this which, more than anything else, estranged him from the age into which he was born. But he had an inbred [...] "revolt from fact" [...] which would have estranged him from the actualities of any age. That criticism seems to be more justified which has found in him a lack of such victorious energy and mastery over his materials as would have enabled him to carry out his conceptions in their original intensity. Yet Burne-Jones was singularly strenuous in production. His industry was inexhaustible, and needed to be, if it was to keep pace with the constant pressure of his ideas. Whatever faults his paintings may have, they have always the fundamental virtue of design; they are always pictures. His designs were informed with <b>a</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> romantic temper, apt in the discovery of beautiful subjects, and impassioned with a delight in pure and variegated colour.|$|E
500|$|Belle has {{garnered}} widespread acclaim from film critics, {{several of}} whom voiced their {{preference for the}} character over her predecessor, Ariel from The Little Mermaid. Hal Hinson of The Washington Post described Belle as a [...] "compelling" [...] character who is [...] "more mature, more womanly and less blandly asexual" [...] than Ariel, as well as [...] "a more worldly girl", describing her as [...] "a bookworm, with gumption and <b>a</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> her own." [...] Similarly comparing Belle to Ariel, John Hartl of The Seattle Times wrote that, in Beauty and the Beast, [...] "there's rarely a sense of deja vu, perhaps because the heroine is so different from 'Mermaid's' dependent Ariel, and her dilemma is more poignant," [...] while Boxoffice scribed, [...] "Undoubtedly in response to criticism that the cute little 'Mermaid' Ariel {{was nothing more than}} a precocious sexpot, the idea-people behind this beauty—aptly named Belle ... chose to make her an icon of self-reliance and a voracious reader with a curiosity and love for everything around her." [...] Jennie Punter of The Globe and Mail extolled Belle as a [...] "smart, courageous ... 'take-charge kind of gal'," [...] while crowning her the [...] "main attraction of Beauty and the Beast." [...] Emma Cochrane of Empire hailed Belle as [...] "a feminist heroine who [...] more rounded than previous Disney characters", while Paste's Annlee Ellingson similarly enjoyed the character's [...] "feminist kick." [...] Stephen Hunter of The Baltimore Sun wrote that [...] "Belle ... is no passive fairy tale princess, but a real live girl, with a spunky personality and her own private agenda." [...] TV Guide wrote that [...] "The familiar narrative is strengthened by the independent, self-assured character of Belle," [...] concluding, [...] "Unlike Disney heroines from Snow White through Ariel, Belle is smart, knows what she wants, and doesn't spend her time pining away for the love of a handsome prince." [...] Marc Bernardin of Entertainment Weekly praised Belle's heroism, dubbing her [...] "the hero" [...] of Beauty and the Beast, while Entertainment Weekly's Christian Blauvelt opined, [...] "Unlike previous Disney heroines who needed to be rescued by a prince themselves, Belle not only saves the Beast's life, she saves his soul." [...] TLC's Vicki Arkoff received Belle as a [...] "smart" [...] and [...] "sharp-tongued" [...] heroine, crediting the character for [...] "break Disney's passive-princess mold." [...] About.com's David Nusair described Belle as an [...] "admirable" [...] heroine. AllMovie's Don Kaye and Perry Seibert echoed each other's reviews of the character, with Kaye describing both Belle and the Beast as [...] "three-dimensional ... complex individuals who defy stereotyping and change over the course of the story," [...] and Seibert calling Belle a [...] "strong female character" [...] who [...] "sidesteps most of the clichés surrounding Disney heroines." [...] Common Sense Media hailed Belle as [...] "one of Disney's smartest, most independent heroines." ...|$|E
