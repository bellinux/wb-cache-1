5|$|The North American {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Chris Milk and filmed in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in March 2005. The music video, however, was discarded by the record label, though this version won four Annual MVPA Awards. The video begins with Bedingfield waking up next to a boombox, dressing, brushing her teeth and leaving her home with the boombox. While performing {{on a beach in}} New York City, she kicks her boombox, which comes alive and begins to dance, and she leaves the beach and walks down the street. The video concludes with Bedingfield arriving back home to <b>a</b> <b>house</b> <b>full</b> of dancing boomboxes in the bedroom.|$|E
5|$|On July 23, 1864, Anderson led 65 men to Renick, Missouri, robbing {{stores and}} tearing down {{telegraph}} wires on the way. They {{had hoped to}} attack a train, but its conductor learned of their presence and turned back before reaching the town. The guerrillas then attacked Allen, Missouri. At least 40 members of the 17th Illinois Cavalry and the Missouri State Militia were in town but took shelter in a fort. The guerrillas were only able to shoot their horses before reinforcements arrived, killing three of Anderson's men. In late July, the Union military sent a force of 100 well-equipped soldiers, and 650 other men, after Anderson. On July 30, Anderson and his men kidnapped the elderly father of the local Union militia's commanding officer. They tortured him until he was near death and sent word to the man's son in an unsuccessful attempt to lure him into an ambush, before releasing the father with instructions to spread word of his mistreatment. On August 1, while searching for militia members, Anderson {{and some of his}} men stopped at <b>a</b> <b>house</b> <b>full</b> of women and requested food. While they rested at the house, a group of local men attacked. The guerrillas quickly forced the attackers to flee, and Anderson shot and injured one woman as she fled the house. This action angered his men, who saw themselves as the protectors of women, but Anderson dismissed their concerns, stating that such things were inevitable. They chased the men who had attacked them, killing one and mutilating his body. By August 1864, they were regularly scalping the men that they killed.|$|E

In April 1901, Hobens moved less than five miles to Glen Ridge Golf Club and George Thomson from North Berwick took over at Yountakah. In 1907 Hobens married an Irish girl, Delia Agnes Lally (1881–1969), and together they would have <b>a</b> <b>house</b> <b>full</b> of children, eight in all.

500|$|Piccard was {{the mother}} of <b>a</b> <b>house</b> <b>full</b> of boys. Robert R.

It seems like there was a dozen.... I remember the youngest one took the corn flake box and dumped it on his father's head. Of course, Piccard just brushed it off his head and said, 'No, no.'" [...] "He was very gentle. He loved his boys, and he thought boys would be boys, I guess." [...] The Piccards had three sons of their own, John, Paul, and Donald (who would become a famous balloonist and ballooning innovator in his own right), as well as foster children. The Piccard family archive in the Library of Congress mentions correspondence from foster children whom the Piccards took in, although nothing else seems to be known about them.|$|E

[...] The yard was visited by Peter the Great, Tsar of Russia, in 1698. He stayed in nearby Sayes Court, which had been temporarily let furnished by John Evelyn to Admiral John Benbow. During the Tsar's stay, Evelyn's servant wrote to him to report [...] "There is <b>a</b> <b>house</b> <b>full</b> of people and right nasty. The Tsar lies next your library, and dines in the parlour next your study.

[...] Peter studied shipbuilding techniques and practices at the dockyard.|$|E

[...] As the game progresses, Chris has the {{possibility}} of developing a romantic relationship with one of the girls; at first this is limited to the three sisters: Ai, Mai and Mii, but after completing at least one of their routes, five other girls will be accessible. Since the visual novel revolves around him, the only time his character is seen is during event sequences; however, in the fan disc, his image is visually represented along with the other characters.|$|E

2500|$|With Presley's {{explosion}} in popularity in 1956, pressure {{was put on}} Jones to cut a few rockabilly sides and he reluctantly agreed. [...] His heart was never in it, however, and he quickly regretted the decision; in his autobiography he joked, [...] "During the years, when I've encountered those records, I've used them for Frisbees." [...] He explained to Billboard in 2006: [...] "I was desperate. [...] When you're hungry, a poor man with <b>a</b> <b>house</b> <b>full</b> of kids, you're gonna do some things you ordinarily wouldn't do. [...] I said, 'Well, hell, I'll try anything once.' [...] I tried 'Dadgum It How Come It' and 'Rock It', a bunch of shit. [...] I didn't want {{my name on the}} rock and roll thing, so I told them to put Thumper Jones on it and if it did something, good, if it didn't, hell, I didn't want to be shamed with it." [...] Jones went on to say he unsuccessfully attempted to buy all the masters to keep the cuts from surfacing later, which they did.|$|E
2500|$|... "Antique Sandy" [...] was {{the result}} of a songwriting {{experiment}} between all four members of The Byrds and their percussionist/road manager Jimmi Seiter. [...] The song's inspiration was Seiter's then girlfriend, who did indeed live in the woods in <b>a</b> <b>house</b> <b>full</b> of antiques, as the song's lyrics indicate. [...] The Bob Rafkin-penned [...] "Lazy Waters" [...] featured a melodramatic lead vocal from Battin, which was enhanced during the song's refrain by The Byrds' trademark crystal clear harmonies. [...] Despite being a cover, the song's wistful yearning for the simpler days of a bucolic childhood had personal significance for Battin, as he explained during a 1979 interview: [...] "'Lazy Waters' was a serious song. I was living in the Mendocino woods and working on the road. I'd known the song a long time. It expressed my feelings about life in the country and life on the road." [...] The band also elected to cover The Fiestas' 1959 hit single [...] "So Fine" [...] on the album, at the suggestion of Clarence White. [...] The addition of [...] "So Fine", along with other rock 'n' roll-influenced songs, such as [...] "Tiffany Queen", [...] "Get Down Your Line", and [...] "B.B. Class Road", provided the album with a 1950s-flavored thematic unity. [...] The final track on Farther Along was a Gene Parsons and Clarence White-penned bluegrass instrumental titled [...] "Bristol Steam Convention Blues". [...] The song had been inspired by Parsons' frustration and disappointment at having narrowly missed the Bristol Steam Convention during both of The Byrds' last two visits to England.|$|E
