The Royal Academy of Sciences of Lisbon noticed their overwhelming notoriety in the Minho coast and considered Povoans to be the most expert fishermen from Cape St. Vincent to Caminha, with a sizable number of fishermen, ships and high sea fishing.

25|$|After {{the first}} stage of <b>aggradation</b> and {{sediment}} transport, the Kobuk began a new phase of erosion and landform development. The river exhausted its supply of easily erodible sediment upstream, thus decreasing its sediment load and increasing its load carrying capacity downstream.

50|$|Around {{the year}} 1180 some street {{levels in the}} city were raised by up to three metres with layers of gravel. Unlike in many other {{settlements}} this was not done to protect against floods since the riverbed of the Dreisam is {{significantly lower than the}} city. It is now believed that the entire system of Bächle was instead elevated in order to supply newer parts of the city with water. Thus, houses from {{the first half of the}} twelfth century are in line with a lower street level and all constructions after 1175 with a higher one. Those <b>aggradations</b> made the ground floor of a lot of houses impassable from the street, so that they were either raised or simply had front doors built at the level of their upper floors - which were then at street level. The amount of newly constructed buildings around 1175 thus surpassing the number expected by natural population growth, presumably also because the <b>aggradations</b> were used to substitute wooden constructions with stone ones.|$|R

The sequence {{from the western}} part of the former Solent river system is one of the longest in Britain, with 18 mapped terrace <b>aggradations.</b> A set of 23 optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dates aim to provide dated tie-points within the lower part of the sequence at five stratotype locations.

In 1920 the Rivers Commission estimated that 300 million cubic yards of material had been moved by mining activity in the Clutha river catchment. At that time an estimated 40 million cubic yards had been washed out to sea with a further 60 million in the river. (The remainder was still on riverbanks).

25|$|As {{the glacier}} first retreated and melted, {{large amounts of}} highly erodible, {{fine-grained}} sediment dropped out in relatively high mountain valleys. The availability of this fine-grained, loose sediment combined with a high gradient to turn a newly forming Kobuk River into a fast-working sediment transport system. The river picked up glacial till from its upper reaches and transported it downstream until the gradient diminished. When the river encountered flatter ground, it deposited its sediment load resulting {{in the creation of}} broad, flat floodplains, alluvial fans, and meander bends through <b>aggradation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Further {{down in the}} Kobuk watershed, {{the river}} worked {{in concert with the}} wind to create one of the more famous landforms in Alaska: the Kobuk Dunes.

In moister climates, the river has more water, and thus more power, and cuts down through a sandy bed. In times of drier climate, wind dominates and blows a lot of sediment into a weaker fluvial system, leading to <b>aggradation</b> and floodplain re-distribution.|$|E

The model provides the temporal dynamics of the river width and bed quote.

Initially ascribed to the Rissian glaciation, our dating shows that the terrace was abandoned at 18 ± 2 kyr. In reference to the Late Pleistocene climatic chronology, two kinds of terraces can be distinguished: high-standing fill terraces probably deposited during glacial events and lower cut-in-fill and strath terraces cut during the postglacial river incision. A part of the terrace <b>aggradations</b> could have occurred during the Würmian glacial episodes. Hence, the dated terrace fits in with the prevailing view of incision during climate transitions.

40|$|Luminescence dating has truly {{transformed}} {{the science of}} deserts and drylands and has necessitated a revision of conventional interpretation of sedimentary records and stratigraphic correlations. This contribution discusses key questions in palaeoclimatology of global deserts, {{the meaning of a}} luminescence age on desert sand and presents a review of luminescence-dated aeolian sand records from the deserts in the two hemispheres. Luminescence dating has in fact transformed dryland palaeoclimatology from a qualitative science into a quantitative one. Processes ranging from past sedimentation rates to dune migration rates and the changes in surface winds can now be quantified. A key inference is that, during the past, aeolian sedimentation occurred episodically and for limited time durations. Accentuated aeolian <b>aggradations</b> occurred during specific climatic regimes, the timing of which was determined by an optimal combination of sediment supply, transport and preservation or erosion. This fact has important implications for global climatology and aspects such as albedo changes through time.

40|$|The sedimentological and lithostratigraphic {{record from}} north-central Bir Tarfawi {{documents}} {{the presence of}} Pleistocene basin-fill deposits.

The oldest and highest sedimentary remnant is associated with Acheulian artifacts and may reflect spring-fed pond and marsh conditions during a Middle Pleistocene wet climate episode. Lithofacies for a lower stratigraphic sequence (the “White Lake”) documents deposition in a perennial lake that varied in extent and depth and is associated with Middle Paleolithic artifacts. A third episode of deflation created a topographic low that has been filled with Late Pleistocene sediments that are associated with Middle Paleolithic artifacts and fossil remains. Lateral and vertical variations in the lithofacies of this basin-fill sequence and the sediments of the “grey-green” lake phases provide a record of changing hydrologic conditions.

40|$|Abstract: Kosi {{is highly}} braided river and notorious for its vagaries. During its last two hundred years, {{it has been}} {{shifting}} laterally towards western direction. It has shifted across a width of over 100 km. The river Kosi has been provided with levees along the banks, at a width ranging from 6 km to 16 km to minimize further shifting of river. The general bed level at many places has risen by 0. 1 to 3 m {{over a period of}} 50 years due to inadequate velocities in the river for carrying out the sediment. For the minimizing the silting and lateral shifting, it is desirable to explore the possibility of channelizing the river Kosi, which is thought {{to be one of the}} method by which the velocities in the river could be increased thereby increasing the sediment carrying capacity of the river. This paper presents the analysis of hydraulic aspects of channelizing the river by using 1 D mathematical model HEC-RAS 4. 1.

Rather than depending on warm?cold or cold?warm transitions, {{it is suggested that}} bedrock planation, ?working depths? of gravel and later-stage (relatively shallow) <b>aggradations</b> are all dominantly of cold-climate origin. Basal sediments show active incorporation of plucked and periglacially-shattered materials, whilst super-incumbent units incorporating up-catchment and slope-derived materials demonstrate later cold-stage sediment influx and consequent cessation of active bedrock erosion. Channel activity effecting both planation and deposition are reviewed, together with the detailed sedimentology of gravelly sediments which show evidence of both autogenic processes (bar migration, channel switching and infilling, and truncation of upper sedimentation units), cold-climate indicators (turbation, ice-wedge casts, and frozen block transport), and (specifically for the last glacial?interglacial cycle) varying sediment flux as climates changed. Both interglacial and ?transitional? activities are believed to be of lesser morphological significance, whilst prior uplift is taken as enabling rather than being a generator of terrace within the timescale of a glacial?interglacial cycle.

50|$|After {{the removal}} of the dams, 10.5 million metric tons of {{sediment}} was released from two reservoirs through the Elwha river system. The sudden increase of sediment supply caused bed <b>aggradation</b> of ~1 meter, resulting in a change of channel morphology from pool-riffle to braided, and decreased the slope of the lowermost river. Widespread bed <b>aggradation</b> forced flow through floodplain channels, depositing additional sediment in the side channels of the Elwha river floodplain. Mainstream <b>aggradation</b> also formed numerous bars, further establishing braided morphology. The river system showed a greater geomorphic response to dam removal than it had to a 40-year flood event four years before dam removal. The dams had virtually eliminated bed-material sediment supply to the river downstream, forming large deltas upstream of each reservoir. Once released, the sediment travelled downstream to the mouth of the river where a new estuary is believed to be forming. These geomorphic alterations have important ecological implications, affecting aquatic habitat structure, benthic fauna, salmonid spawning and rearing potential, and riparian vegetation.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Seismic facies {{analysis}} and seismic geomorphology are important tools {{for the analysis}} of depositional elements in subsurface. This paper aimed to investigate the character and genesis of depositional elements and erosive features associated with an Eocene progradational shelf margin in northern Santos Basin. Identified seismic facies are interpreted as shelf-margin deltas/shoreface deposits, tangential (oblique) clinoforms, sigmoidal clinoforms, topset reflectors, mass-transport deposits and turbidites. These facies are grouped into four associations representing periods of relatively constant environmental conditions. Association 1 is composed of shelf-margin deltas/shoreface deposits, tangential clinoforms and extensive sand-rich turbidites disposed as submarine channels and frontal splays. A progressive increase in clinoform angle within this association has been identified, culminating in high-relief sigmoidal clinoforms with less voluminous turbidites of facies association 2. Association 3 is composed by subparallel to divergent topset reflectors, interpreted as continental to shelfal deposits placed during base-level rises. These are always truncated basinward by slump scars, formed as a consequence of sediment overload at the shelf margin during <b>aggradations.</b> Association 4 is composed of sigmoidal clinoforms, mass-transport deposits and turbidites. Early clinoforms are steeper {{as a consequence of the}} topography of the slump scars. Subsequently, dip angles become progressively gentler as the system approach to the equilibrium profile. The steep physiography was favorable for canyon incision, which played an important role in turbidite deposition.

This paper {{is focused on}} the Late Pleistocene and Holocene geomorphic evolution of southeast Spain, one of the driest regions in Europe. Late Pleistocene and Holocene chronosequences of river terraces were established for the Antas and Aguas valleys, respectively. The deposition of up to four fluvial terraces during isotope stage 2 points to important erosion and accumulation processes at the end of Late Pleistocene in the Vera basin. In contrast to the stage 2 deposits, the Holocene terraces are composed of point bar deposits accumulated by meandering rivers with less sediment discharge. According to the obtained 14 C-dating and extracted pottery fragments, Holocene terrace deposition occurred during the Atlantic period, early Middle Ages, Little Ice Age (LIA) and the 20 th century. The most outstanding site in southern Spain for studying Holocene glacier shifts (up to five end-moraines) is the Veleta cirque in Sierra Nevada, where the southernmost glacier of Europe persisted during the Little Ice Age.
