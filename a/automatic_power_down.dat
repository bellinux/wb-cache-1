40|$|AbstractStepper motors {{are very}} well suited for {{positioning}} applications since they can achieve very good positional accuracy without complicated feedback loops associated with servo systems. In this paper, an intelligent five-phase stepping motor driver of business card size proposed. Constant current chopping technique was applied {{for the purposes of}} high torque, high velocity and high efficiency. The driver was designed to drive a middle-sized hybrid stepping motor with wire current rating from 0. 4 to 1. 5 A. An up-to-dated translator of five-phase stepping motor was used to drive the gates of N- channel MOSFET array. The resolution in full/half mode is 0. 72 / 0. 36 degrees/step. Moreover, an <b>automatic</b> <b>power</b> <b>down</b> circuit was used to limit the power consuming as the motor stops. Additionally, a self-testing program embedded in a 80 C 31 -CPU (PCL 838) can self-test whether the driver is normal or not. This embedded program including linear acceleration and deceleration routines also can serve as a positioning controller. The dimension of this driver is approximate 70 x 65 x 35 millimeters, which is smaller than a business card. Experimental results demonstrate that the responses of the driver can reach 60 kilo pulses per second...|$|E

We report on a method for estimating the signal strength based on measurement of the total output power and the SOA drive current.
