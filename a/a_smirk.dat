500|$|The video {{begins with}} Spears wearing a sparkly black dress at a {{dressing}} table, putting mascara and Circus Fantasy on. Then, it cuts to her holding her hair up and singing the first lines {{in front of}} a white background. There are also black and white scenes of her wearing a white leotard behind a foggy glass.

500|$|Kunis was {{nominated}} for multiple awards, including her first Golden Globe, for the 2010 film Black Swan. She played a rival ballet dancer to the main character, played by Natalie Portman. Director Darren Aronofsky cast Kunis in the film based on her performance in Forgetting Sarah Marshall, and {{on the recommendation of}} co-star and close friend Natalie Portman. She underwent a training regimen that included cardiovascular exercise, a 1,200-calorie a day diet (she lost 20pounds that she regained after filming ended), and ballet classes for four hours a day, seven days a week. During the demanding production, she suffered injuries including a torn ligament and a dislocated shoulder. Black Swan received widespread acclaim from critics and {{was nominated}} for five Academy Awards, including Best Picture. The film grossed over $106.9million in the United States and Canada while grossing over $329 million worldwide. Reviews of Kunis's performance were positive, with Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter stating, [...] "Kunis makes a perfect alternate to Portman, equally as lithe and dark but <b>a</b> <b>smirk</b> of self-assurance in place of Portman's wide-eyed fearfulness." [...] Guy Lodge of In Contention also praised Kunis, saying, [...] "it's the cool, throaty-voiced Kunis who is the surprise package here, intelligently watching and reflecting her co-star in such a manner that we're as uncertain as Nina of her ingenuousness." [...] Kunis's performance won her the Marcello Mastroianni Award for Best Young Actor or Actress at the 67th Venice International Film Festival, and earned her Golden Globe Award and Screen Actors Guild Award nominations for Best Supporting Actress. At the 37th annual Saturn Awards, she was also honored with the Best Supporting Actress award for her performance.|$|E

500|$|... "Smile" [...] was {{met with}} mixed to {{positive}} reviews from music critics. According to Heather Phares of Allmusic, the song [...] "has a silky verse melody that just barely conceals [...] spite", while she keeps [...] "her revenge sweet, the extra sting being given to it {{by the way she}} sounds like she's singing about how ice cream or puppies or being in love makes her smile". Blender reporter Jon Dolan claims that Allen [...] "deploys a sugary melody as a Trojan horse for a smackdown on a douche-bag ex-boyfriend", as Rob Webb from Drowned in Sound called [...] "Smile" [...] an [...] "infectious slice of bouncing, carnival reggae that punches hard with its opening line: 'When you first left me / I was wanting more / But you were fucking that girl next door / What you do that for?,'" [...] and {{went on to say that}} the theme of the song is melancholy, [...] "set against breezy beats", and while not being [...] "an obvious TOTP contender on the surface, [...] is good but far from one of the LP's choice cuts". Rob Sheffield from Rolling Stone gave a rather negative review, claiming the singer [...] "doesn't sound as if she's trying too hard", singing the song with a [...] "breezy sha-la-la lilt that just made the song seem even nastier". Later, he called Allen a [...] "theoretical pop princess, who just entered the breakup-song hall of fame". Dom Passantino of Stylus suggested that [...] "'Smile' gets burned off the lights by both Sean Paul and Abs when it comes to facsimiles of 'Uptown Top Ranking,' but neither of them could bring the quality of lyricism the singer does," [...] while Slant Magazine reporter Sal Cinquemani was baffled as to why the song, which she [...] "sings without <b>a</b> <b>smirk</b> of irony", is a UK chart-topper.|$|E
2500|$|Many of the animators {{who worked}} on the film were {{professionals}} that Bakshi had previously worked with at Terrytoons, including Jim Tyer, John Gentilella, Nick Tafuri, Martin Taras, Larry Riley, and Cliff Augustine. According to Bakshi, it took quite a long time to assemble the right staff. Those who entered with <b>a</b> <b>smirk,</b> [...] "wanting to be very dirty and draw filthy pictures", did not stay very long, and neither did those with a low tolerance for vulgarity. One cartoonist refused to draw a black crow shooting a pig policeman. Two female animators quit; one because she could not bring herself to tell her children what she did for a living, the other because she refused to draw exposed breasts.|$|E

500|$|Hilary Mantel in The Spectator {{dismissed}} the film. [...] "It {{is a very}} noisy film. There is a weary and repetitive note to the frenzy.

6000|$|... "Not so-not so," [...] {{said the}} mercer, with <b>a</b> <b>smirking</b> laugh--"not {{altogether}} so--but curiosity, thou knowest, and {{a strain of}} compassion withal; for the poor young lady sees nothing from morn to even but Tony Foster, with his scowling black brows, his bull's head, and his bandy legs." ...|$|R

60|$|Mr. Caryll {{looked at}} her out of his level gray-green eyes; a hot answer quivered on his tongue, an answer that had crushed her venom {{for some time and}} had {{probably}} left him with a quarrel on his hands.

He was, she judged, another victim ripe for immolation on the altar of her goddessship. And Mr. Caryll, who had taken her measure very thoroughly, seeing something of how her thoughts were running, bethought him of a sweeter vengeance.|$|E
60|$|George {{felt the}} ground with his feet, and blew a speck of dust off his barrels, {{and the smell of}} the oil sent a delicious tremor darting through him. Everything, even Helen Bellew, was forgotten. Then in the silence rose a far-off clamour; a cock pheasant, {{skimming}} low, his plumage silken in the sun, dived out of the green and golden spinney, curled to the right, and was lost in undergrowth. Some pigeons passed over at a great height. The tap-tap of sticks beating against trees began; then with a fitful rushing noise a pheasant came straight out. George threw up his gun and pulled. The bird stopped in mid-air, jerked forward, and fell headlong into the grass sods with a thud. In the sunlight the dead bird lay, and <b>a</b> <b>smirk</b> of triumph played on George's lips. He was feeling the joy of life.|$|E
