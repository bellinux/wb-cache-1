5000|$|The {{ability of}} the {{electronic}} nose to detect odourless chemicals makes it ideal {{for use in the}} police force, such as the ability to detect drug odours despite other <b>airborne</b> <b>odours</b> capable of confusing police dogs. However this is unlikely in the mean time as the cost of the electronic nose is too great and until its price drops significantly it is unlikely to happen.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Among invertebrates, {{specific}} pheromones elicit inherent (fixed) behavioural {{responses to}} coordinate social behaviours such as sexual recognition and attraction. By contrast, {{the much more}} complex social odours of mammals provide {{a broad range of}} information about the individual owner and stimulate individual-specific responses that are modulated by learning. How do mammals use such odours to coordinate important social interactions such as sexual attraction while allowing for individual-specific choice? We hypothesized that male mouse urine contains a specific pheromonal component that invokes inherent sexual attraction to the scent and which also stimulates female memory and conditions sexual attraction to the <b>airborne</b> <b>odours</b> of an individual scent owner associated with this pheromone. Results Using wild-stock house mice to ensure natural responses that generalize across individual genomes, we identify a single atypical male-specific major urinary protein (MUP) of mass 18893 Da that invokes a female's inherent sexual attraction to male compared to female urinary scent. Attraction to this protein pheromone, which we named darcin, was as strong as the attraction to intact male urine. Importantly, contact with darcin also stimulated a strong learned attraction to the associated airborne urinary odour of an individual male, such that, subsequently, females were attracted to the airborne scent of that specific individual but not to that of other males. Conclusions This involatile protein is a mammalian male sex pheromone that stimulates a flexible response to individual-specific odours through associative learning and memory, allowing female sexual attraction to be inherent but selective towards particular males. This 'darcin effect' offers a new system to investigate the neural basis of individual-specific memories in the brain and give new insights into the regulation of behaviour in complex social mammals.

40|$|Feeding chitons {{were lifted}} and {{replaced}} in new positions to deny them {{the use of}} their outbrowsed trail in returning to their homesites. In 35 trials, homing occurred with a frequency of 0. 66. Experiments were carried out to investigate the roles of the following: (a) <b>airborne</b> <b>odour</b> from the homesite, (b) topographical memory, (c) chemical cues from the current outward trail, (d) chemical cues from old browsing trails, and (e) “foreign” trails. Homesites whose immediate surroundings had been broken up retained an attraction which is not adequately explained. The appreciation of cues from old trails and a topographical memory are discussed as two possible factors involved in the homing mechanism...|$|R
40|$|Flying {{insects are}} well known for <b>airborne</b> <b>odour</b> {{tracking}} and have evolved diverse chemoreceptors. While ionotropic receptors (IRs) are found across protostomes, insect odorant receptors (ORs) have only been identified in winged insects. We therefore hypothesized that the unique signal transduction of ORs offers an advantage for odour localization in flight. Using Drosophila, we found expression and increased activity of the intracellular signalling protein PKC in antennal sensilla following odour stimulation. Odour stimulation also enhanced phosphorylation of theORco-receptorOrco in vitro, while site-directed mutation of Orco or mutations in PKC subtypes reduced the sensitivity and dynamic range of OR-expressing neurons in vivo, but not IR-expressing neurons. We ultimately show that these mutations reduce competence for odour localization of flies in flight. We conclude that intracellular regulation of OR sensitivity is necessary for efficient odour localization, which suggests a mechanistic advantage {{for the evolution of}} the OR complex in flying insects...|$|R
50|$|Added {{advantages}} of the convectant drying system are that the system controls the environment being dried, removing the potential for mold proliferation and expelling <b>airborne</b> particulates, <b>odours</b> and mold spores to the outside. In addition to {{the benefits of a}} faster drying process, use of the process can result in significant reduction in: the need to strip out structural components, secondary damage, environmental impacts, overall cost savings relating to the incident - in particular when being used on more severe water damage or construction drying projects.|$|R
