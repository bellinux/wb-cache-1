5|$|Historian Michael Crawford {{attributes}} {{the disappearance of}} much of Tiberius Gracchus' support to the reduced level of citizen participation due to dispersal far from Rome, and sees his tribunate as marking <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Hellenization of Roman aristocracy. Crawford asserts that Gaius Gracchus' extortion law shifted {{the balance of power}} in Rome and that the Gracchi made available a new political armoury which the oligarchy subsequently sought to exploit.|$|E
5|$|The number 1 (expressed as a {{fraction}} 1/1) is {{placed at the}} root of the tree, and the location of any other number a/b can be found by computing gcd(a,b) using the original form of the Euclidean algorithm, in which each step replaces the larger of the two given numbers by its difference with the smaller number (not its remainder), stopping when two equal numbers are reached. A step of the Euclidean algorithm that replaces the first of the two numbers corresponds to <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tree from a node to its right child, and a step that replaces the second of the two numbers corresponds to <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tree from a node to its left child. The sequence of steps constructed in this way does not depend on whether a/b is given in lowest terms, and forms a path from the root to a node containing the number a/b. This fact can be used to prove that each positive rational number appears exactly once in this tree.|$|E
5|$|Abduction of marriage-age {{women was}} common during the Liao dynasty. Khitans men of all social classes {{participated in the}} activity, and the abductees were both Khitan and Han. In some cases, this was <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{courtship}} process, where the woman would agree to the abduction and the resulting sexual intercourse, and then the abductor and abductee {{would return to the}} woman's home to announce their intention to marry. This process was known as baimen (拜門). In other cases, the abduction would be non-consensual and would result in a rape.|$|E

5|$|Lethbridge's {{next book}} was ESP – Beyond Time and Distance, {{published}} in 1965. It {{dealt with the}} theme of extra-sensory perception and articulated Lethbridge's argument that rays of energy were transmitted from every object, {{and that they could}} be detected using pendulum dowsing. In 1966 he published <b>A</b> <b>Step</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Dark, which repeated many of his theories regarding pendulum dowsing present in earlier works. Early that year, Lethbridge first began struggling against heart disease, an affliction that had resulted from his obesity. In both his books and private letters from this period he regularly ranted against modern life and society, while in other correspondences with individuals in the United States he championed the authenticity of the Kensington Runestone and Westford Knight.|$|E
5|$|The Science Behind Pixar is a {{travelling}} exhibition that first opened on June 28, 2015, at the Museum of Science in Boston, Massachusetts. It {{was developed by}} the Museum of Science in collaboration with Pixar. The exhibit features forty interactive elements that explain the production pipeline at Pixar. They are divided into eight sections, each demonstrating <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> filmmaking process: Modeling, Rigging, Surfaces, Sets & Cameras, Animation, Simulation, Lighting, and Rendering. Before visitors enter the exhibit, they watch a short video at an introductory theater.|$|E
5|$|For grieving {{parents who}} form {{emotional}} bonds with reborn dolls, some child bereavement counselors advise against parents substituting their deceased child with the dolls. Reborn mothers contend {{that they are}} not replacing children but remembering them. Psychiatrist Sue Varma, teacher at the NYU school of medicine, says mothering reborn dolls rather than just collecting them can become a problem when it is used as prop and becomes the person's only form of socializing. Psychiatrist Gail Saltz with New York Presbyterian Hospital supports the use of reborns for people who do not want to make the commitment of having a real child, and also to comfort bereaved parents. She offers that in this case the reborn may symbolize <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> grieving process. Concern should only come if someone who lost a baby grows too attached to their reborn because it could indicate their grief is not getting resolved. In this case, the likeness of the doll to the deceased child risks being harmful as a permanent replacement for the grieving parents. Ian James, a doctor at the Centre for the Health of the Elderly at Newcastle General Hospital in the U.K., said that holding the dolls helps calm elderly residents, helping them feel peaceful and quiet.|$|E

5|$|The {{simplest}} {{structure that}} can be implemented is <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> characteristic impedance of the line, which introduces a discontinuity in the transmission characteristics. This is done in planar technologies by {{a change in the}} width of the transmission line. Figure 4(a) shows a step up in impedance (narrower lines have higher impedance). A step down in impedance would be the mirror image of figure 4(a). The discontinuity can be represented approximately as a series inductor, or more exactly, as a low-pass T circuit as shown in figure 4(a). Multiple discontinuities are often coupled together with impedance transformers to produce a filter of higher order. These impedance transformers can be just a short (often λ/4) length of transmission line. These composite structures can implement any of the filter families (Butterworth, Chebyshev, etc.) by approximating the rational transfer function of the corresponding lumped element filter. This correspondence is not exact since distributed element circuits cannot be rational and is the root reason for the divergence of lumped element and distributed element behaviour. Impedance transformers are also used in hybrid mixtures of lumped and distributed element filters (the so-called semi-lumped structures).|$|E

This geometric representation is called {{integrated circuit}} layout. This step is usually split into several sub-steps, which include both design and verification and validation of the layout.|$|E

25|$|In astronomy, Galactocentrism is {{the theory}} that our sun is {{at or near the}} center of the galaxy.

Although proved incorrect by Harlow Shapley in 1918, the theory was <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> development of cosmological models as the speculation of the existence of other galaxies, comparable in size and structure to our own, placed the earth in its proper perspective with respect to the rest of the universe.|$|E

In fact, the linguistic situation in Luxembourg was characterised by trilingualism: Lëtzebuergesch was the spoken vernacular language, German the written language, in which Luxembourgers were most fluent, and French the language of official letters and law.|$|E

Goldmann {{called for an}} extraordinary Zionist conference in 1942 to form a cohesive strategy to attenuate the devastating effects of Nazi policies on European Jews, and the outcome was the Biltmore Program, which called for, among other things, unrestricted Jewish immigration to Palestine. In his address to the conference, Goldmann warned that Nazi rhetoric was to be taken seriously, {{and that there were}} foreseeable genocidal consequences for European Jews, were the Nazis to press on with their policies. At the May 1943 American Emergency Committee meeting, Goldmann, along with Abba Hillel Silver, was an advocate of the rationale that the struggle against the MacDonald White Paper was <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> establishment of the Jewish commonwealth.|$|E

25|$|As human {{machines}} {{being made}} up of cells controlled by our brain to influence aspects of our behaviour, {{there must be some}} influence of biology on our consumer behaviour and how we purchase as well. The nature versus nurture debate {{is at the core of}} how much biology influences these buying decisions, because it argues the extent to which biological factors influence what we do, and how much is reflected through environmental factors. Neuromarketing is of interest to marketers in measuring the reaction of stimulus to marketing. Even though we know there is a reaction, the question of why we consume the way we do still lingers, but it is <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> right direction. Biology helps to understand consumer behaviour as it influences consumption and aids in the measurement of it.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the idea}} of the grid was present in Hellenic {{societal}} and city planning, it was not pervasive prior to the 5th century BC. However, it slowly gained primacy through the work of Hippodamus of Miletus, who planned and replanned many Greek cities in accordance with this form. The concept of a grid as the ideal method of town planning had become widely accepted by the time of Alexander the Great. His conquests were <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> propagation of the grid plan throughout colonies, some as far-flung as Taxila in Pakistan, that would later be mirrored by the expansion of the Roman Empire. The Greek grid had its streets aligned roughly in relation to the cardinal points and generally looked to take advantage of visual cues based on the hilly landscape typical of Greece and Asia Minor. This was probably best exemplified in Priene, in present-day western Turkey, where the orthogonal city grid was based on the cardinal points, on sloping terrain that struck views out towards a river and the city of Miletus.|$|E
