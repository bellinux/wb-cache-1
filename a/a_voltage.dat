5|$|<b>A</b> <b>voltage</b> doubler is an {{electronic}} circuit which charges capacitors from the input voltage and switches these charges {{in such a}} way that, in the ideal case, exactly twice the voltage is produced at the output as at its input.|$|E
5|$|The {{first use}} of SiC was as an abrasive. This was {{followed}} by electronic applications. In {{the beginning of the}} 20th century, silicon carbide was used as a detector in the first radios. In 1907 Henry Joseph Round produced the first LED by applying <b>a</b> <b>voltage</b> to a SiC crystal and observing yellow, green and orange emission at the cathode. Those experiments were later repeated by O. V. Losev in the Soviet Union in 1923.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>voltage</b> {{applied to}} a human body causes an {{electric}} current through the tissues, and although the relationship is non-linear, the greater the voltage, the greater the current. The threshold for perception varies with the supply frequency and with {{the path of the}} current, but is about 0.1mA to 1mA for mains-frequency electricity, though a current as low as a microamp can be detected as an electrovibration effect under certain conditions. If the current is sufficiently high, it will cause muscle contraction, fibrillation of the heart, and tissue burns. The lack of any visible sign that a conductor is electrified makes electricity a particular hazard. The pain caused by an electric shock can be intense, leading electricity at times to be employed as a method of torture. Death caused by an electric shock is referred to as electrocution. Electrocution is still the means of judicial execution in some jurisdictions, though its use has become rarer in recent times.|$|E

The measuring unit is configured to measure <b>a</b> threshold <b>voltage</b> {{of at least}} one sensing transistor of the circuit unit, and to measure <b>a</b> threshold <b>voltage</b> {{of at least one}} reference transistor of the reference circuit. <b>A</b> differential <b>voltage</b> generator is configured to generate <b>a</b> differential <b>voltage</b> from outputs of the measuring unit and a bulk connection of the transistor devices in the circuit unit to which the differential voltage is fed as <b>a</b> biasing <b>voltage...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Voltage {{regulators}} (including {{voltage regulators}} having {{pulse width modulation}} or PWM and a low drop out or LDO modes) as well as <b>a</b> hybrid <b>voltage</b> regulator containing <b>a</b> switching regulator and a linear regulator for converting <b>an</b> unregulated <b>voltage,</b> such as <b>a</b> battery <b>voltage,</b> to <b>a</b> regulated DC <b>voltage</b> of <b>a</b> desired value.|$|R
5|$|Each pair of antennas was {{connected}} to a motorized switch that rapidly switched between the pairs, a technique known as lobe switching. Both signals were then sent to a cathode ray tube (CRT) for display, {{with one of them}} passing through <b>a</b> <b>voltage</b> inverter. If the target was to the left, the display would show a longer blip on the left than the right. When the target was dead ahead, the blips would be equal length. There was an inherently limited accuracy to such a solution, about five degrees but it was a practical solution in terms of limiting the antenna sizes.|$|E
5|$|In 1879, Edwin Herbert Hall {{working at}} the Johns Hopkins University {{discovered}} <b>a</b> <b>voltage</b> developing across conductors transverse to an electric current in the conductor and magnetic field perpendicular to the current. This phenomenon arising {{due to the nature}} of charge carriers in the conductor came to be termed the Hall effect, but it was not properly explained at the time, since the electron was experimentally discovered 18 years later. After the advent of quantum mechanics, Lev Landau in 1930 developed the theory of landau quantization and laid the foundation for the theoretical explanation for the quantum Hall effect discovered half a century later.|$|E
5|$|Scientific {{quantities}} {{are often}} expressed as logarithms of other quantities, using a logarithmic scale. For example, the decibel is {{a unit of}} measurement associated with logarithmic-scale quantities. It {{is based on the}} common logarithm of ratios—10 times the common logarithm of a power ratio or 20 times the common logarithm of <b>a</b> <b>voltage</b> ratio. It is used to quantify the loss of voltage levels in transmitting electrical signals, to describe power levels of sounds in acoustics, and the absorbance of light in the fields of spectrometry and optics. The signal-to-noise ratio describing the amount of unwanted noise in relation to a (meaningful) signal is also measured in decibels. In a similar vein, the peak signal-to-noise ratio is commonly used to assess the quality of sound and image compression methods using the logarithm.|$|E

5|$|The {{capacitor}} is {{a development}} of the Leyden jar and is a device that can store charge, and thereby storing electrical energy in the resulting field. It consists of two conducting plates separated by a thin insulating dielectric layer; in practice, thin metal foils are coiled together, increasing the surface area per unit volume and therefore the capacitance. The unit of capacitance is the farad, named after Michael Faraday, and given the symbol F: one farad is the capacitance that develops a potential difference of one volt when it stores a charge of one coulomb. A capacitor connected to <b>a</b> <b>voltage</b> supply initially causes a current as it accumulates charge; this current will however decay in time as the capacitor fills, eventually falling to zero. A capacitor will therefore not permit a steady state current, but instead blocks it.|$|E
5|$|The {{electrical}} {{discharge machining}} (EDM) or spark erosion process has become widely used in mould making. As well as allowing the formation of shapes {{that are difficult to}} machine, the process allows pre-hardened moulds to be shaped so that no heat treatment is required. Changes to a hardened mould by conventional drilling and milling normally require annealing to soften the mould, followed by heat treatment to harden it again. EDM is a simple process in which a shaped electrode, usually made of copper or graphite, is very slowly lowered onto the mould surface (over a period of many hours), which is immersed in paraffin oil (kerosene). <b>A</b> <b>voltage</b> applied between tool and mould causes spark erosion of the mould surface in the inverse shape of the electrode.|$|E
5|$|The {{inductor}} is a conductor, {{usually a}} coil of wire, that stores energy in {{a magnetic field}} {{in response to the}} current through it. When the current changes, the magnetic field does too, inducing <b>a</b> <b>voltage</b> between the ends of the conductor. The induced voltage is proportional to the time rate of change of the current. The constant of proportionality is termed the inductance. The unit of inductance is the henry, named after Joseph Henry, a contemporary of Faraday. One henry is the inductance that will induce a potential difference of one volt if the current through it changes at a rate of one ampere per second. The inductor's behaviour is in some regards converse to that of the capacitor: it will freely allow an unchanging current, but opposes a rapidly changing one.|$|E

50|$|In <b>a</b> {{constant}} <b>voltage</b> mode with <b>an</b> input <b>voltage</b> source at VIN at 34 V and <b>a</b> desired output <b>voltage</b> of 5 V, {{the maximum}} output current will be PMAX / (VI-VO) = 0.98 / (34-5) = 32 mA.|$|R
5|$|The new Dunston B Power Station was {{designed}} by consulting engineers Merz & McLellan. Its design {{was different from the}} design of other power stations at the time because it enclosed the machinery in a steel frame clad with glass. This was a departure from the usual power station designs, which normally enclosed the machinery in a concrete or brick wall. Dunston B is thought to be the first power station in the UK and possibly even the world to be built in this way. The station was also the first in the world to use metal clad switchgear at <b>a</b> <b>voltage</b> as high as 66,000V.|$|E
5|$|The {{solution}} adopted was electrical power, provided via a {{third rail}} beneath the train, but offset {{to the west}} of centre for clearance reasons. Although the use of electricity to power trains had been experimented with during the previous decade, and small-scale operations had been implemented, the C was the first major railway in the world to adopt it as a means of motive power. The system operated using electric locomotives built by Mather & Platt collecting <b>a</b> <b>voltage</b> of 500 volts (actually +500volts in the northbound tunnel and −500volts in the southbound) from the third rail and pulling several carriages. A depot and generating station were constructed at Stockwell. Owing to the limited capacity of the generators, the stations were originally illuminated by gas. The depot was on the surface, and trains requiring maintenance were initially hauled up via a ramp although, following a runaway accident, a lift was soon installed. In practice, most rolling stock and locomotives went to the surface only for major maintenance.|$|E
5|$|Heavy metals {{or their}} {{compounds}} {{can be found}} in electronic components, electrodes, and wiring and solar panels where they may be used as either conductors, semiconductors, or insulators. Molybdenum powder is used in circuit board inks. Ruthenium(IV) oxide coated titanium anodes are used for the industrial production of chlorine. Home electrical systems, for the most part, are wired with copper wire for its good conducting properties. Silver and gold are used in electrical and electronic devices, particularly in contact switches, {{as a result of their}} high electrical conductivity and capacity to resist or minimise the formation of impurities on their surfaces. The semiconductors cadmium telluride and gallium arsenide are used to make solar panels. Hafnium oxide, an insulator, is used as <b>a</b> <b>voltage</b> controller in microchips; tantalum oxide, another insulator, is used in capacitors in mobile phones. Heavy metals have been used in batteries for over 200 years, at least since Volta invented his copper and silver voltaic pile in 1800. Promethium, lanthanum, and mercury are further examples found in, respectively, atomic, nickel-metal hydride, and button cell batteries.|$|E
25|$|Standard supercapacitors with aqueous {{electrolyte}} normally are specified with <b>a</b> rated <b>voltage</b> of 2.1 to 2.3V and capacitors {{with organic}} solvents with 2.5 to 2.7V.

5|$|Herta retired on lap 55 when {{he slowed}} on the frontstrech after his car {{developed}} <b>a</b> <b>voltage</b> regulator problem which caused his engine to cut out. Da Matta moved back into first {{place on the}} next lap, but Gidley reclaimed the position four laps later. Tracy slowed on the backstraight on lap 64 and drove to pit road to retire {{with a loss of}} engine power. On the 72nd lap, Vasser took over the lead from Papis. Franchitti lost engine power after leaving turn one and drove down the backstraight to retire, necessitating the second caution. All drivers chose to make pit stops under caution. The race resumed on lap 80 with da Matta passing Castroneves to move back into first place. Da Matta fell to fourth after he was passed by Vasser around the outside of turn one and Castroneves moved into second five laps later. Papis retook the first position on lap 86. Castroneves pulled off the track at turn four and stopped at the pit road exit to retire with an engine failure on the following lap. Mears moved into the lead on lap 87, but lost it to Papis two laps later. Da Matta and Papis traded the first position over laps 91 to 98. Tagliani took over the lead on the 99th lap.|$|E
